The pathological mechanism of IBMPFD is not clear and there is no treatment. We show that endogenous VCP negatively regulates Mitofusin, which is required for outer mitochondrial membrane fusion. Because 90% of IBMPFD patients have myopathy, we generated an <i>in vivo</i> IBMPFD model in adult <i>Drosophila</i> muscle, which recapitulates disease pathologies. We show that common VCP disease mutants act as hyperactive alleles with respect to regulation of Mitofusin. Importantly, VCP inhibitors suppress mitochondrial defects, muscle tissue damage and cell death associated with IBMPFD models in <i>Drosophila</i>. These inhibitors also suppress mitochondrial fusion and respiratory defects in IBMPFD patient fibroblasts. These results suggest that VCP disease mutants cause IBMPFD through a gain-of-function mechanism, and that VCP inhibitors have therapeutic value."

The pathological mechanism of IBMPFD is not clear and there is no treatment. We show that endogenous VCP negatively regulates Mitofusin, which is required for outer mitochondrial membrane fusion. Because 90% of IBMPFD patients have myopathy, we generated an <i>in vivo</i> IBMPFD model in adult <i>Drosophila</i> muscle, which recapitulates disease pathologies. We show that common VCP disease mutants act as hyperactive alleles with respect to regulation of Mitofusin. Importantly, VCP inhibitors suppress mitochondrial defects, muscle tissue damage and cell death associated with IBMPFD models in <i>Drosophila</i>. These inhibitors also suppress mitochondrial fusion and respiratory defects in IBMPFD patient fibroblasts. These results suggest that VCP disease mutants cause IBMPFD through a gain-of-function mechanism, and that VCP inhibitors have therapeutic value."

The disease is caused by mutations in a gene that codes for Valosin-Containing Protein (VCP) \u2013 a protein that carries out many different roles in cells.

Studying flies that have mutations that affect the gene can therefore help researchers to understand how these mutations might affect humans. Zhang et al. have now engineered fruit flies whose muscle cells made a mutant form of VCP. These flies showed many of the symptoms of IBMPFD (such as the death of muscle cells). In addition, the mitochondria in the muscle cells were smaller and more fragmented than normal. This led Zhang et al. to look at a protein called Mitofusin that controls how mitochondria fuse. VCP normally degrades Mitofusin; the mutant form of VCP caused Mitofusin to degrade excessively. This resulted in mitochondria experiencing reduced levels of fusion, leading to cell malfunction and death."

Recent studies have uncovered the\u00a0roles of mitochondria fusion and fission defects in the pathogenesis of multiple neurodegenerative disorders (<a href=\"#bib14\">Davies et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Chen et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Wakabayashi et al., 2009</a>), particularly Parkinson's disease, the second most common neurodegenerative disorder (<a href=\"#bib23\">Guo, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Pickrell and Youle, 2015</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib17\">Deng et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Yang et al., 2008</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib44\">Poole et al., 2008</a>, <a href=\"#bib45\">2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Park et al., 2009</a>). In mammals, homologous proteins Mitofusin 1 and 2 (Mfn1 and Mfn2) mediate mitochondrial outer membrane fusion, with loss of function of Mfn 1 and 2 resulting in fragmented mitochondria and multiple defects in mitochondrial function (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chen et al., 2003b</a>). In Hela cells, VCP promotes Mfn 1 degradation (<a href=\"#bib64\">Xu et al., 2011</a>). VCP also mediates Mfn\u00a01\u00a0and\u00a02 degradation when mitophagy is stimulated in mammalian cells, and overexpression of VCP in <i>Drosophila</i> leads to\u00a0downregulation of a tagged Mfn-transgene (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kim et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Kimura et al., 2013</a>). These observations led us to investigate the mitochondrial basis and molecular mechanisms for VCP disease mutants function using both <i>Drosophila</i> and IBMPFD patient cell models. As IBMPFD show the highest penetrance in muscle, with 90% of patients manifesting phenotypes in this tissue, we generated <i>Drosophila</i> models of IBMPFD in muscle, which recapitulate disease pathologies. We provide evidence in both <i>Drosophila</i> and human patient cells that VCP disease mutants have an enhanced ability to promote Mfn degradation, loss of which is associated with defects in mitochondrial fusion and physiology. Consistent with the hypothesis that VCP disease phenotypes are due to increased activity on substrates, we find that VCP ATPase activity inhibitors such as NMS-873 and ML240 can significantly rescue mitochondrial defects, disrupted muscle integrity and muscle cell death <i>in vivo</i> in <i>Drosophila</i>, and mitochondrial fusion and respiration defects in IBMPFD patient fibroblasts."

The <i>Drosophila</i> adult indirect flight muscle (IFM) is a non-essential, post-mitotic, and energy-intense tissue containing a high density of mitochondria. It also shows strong and consistent phenotypes in response to altered expression of genes required for mitochondrial fusion, fission and quality control (<a href=\"#bib12\">Clark et al., 2006</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib17\">Deng et al., 2008</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib66\">Yang et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Poole et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Park et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Poole et al., 2010</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib69\">Yun et al., 2014</a>). Using the UAS-Gal4 system (<a href=\"#bib4\">Brand and Perrimon, 1993</a>), we expressed VCP under the control of an IFM promoter derived from the <i>flightin</i> gene we previously generated (<a href=\"#bib69\">Yun et al., 2014</a>). While expression of VCP under the control of the pan-muscle Gal4 drivers 24B-Gal4 or Mef2-Gal4 resulted in 100% adult lethality, expression of wildtype VCP under IFM control, which provides a pulse of expression in late pupal stages and early adulthood, gave rise to viable flies with intact and healthy muscle following adult eclosion. We utilized mitochondrially targeted GFP (mitoGFP) as a mitochondrial marker, as well as transmission electron microscopy (EM) at the ultrastructual levels for enhanced resolution particularly for cristae morphology. In 2-day-old flies, expression of VCP results in muscle with small mitochondria with intact cristae (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013B\u2019</a>). Similar phenotypes are also observed in muscle from 6-day-old VCP-expressing flies (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A\u2013B\u2019\u2019</a>). Conversely, expression of UAS-VCP RNAi under IFM control (VCP RNAi flies) results in mitochondria with an elongated phenotype (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C\u2013C\u2019\u2019</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C and C\u2019</a>).

As an alternative, we focused on the <i>Drosophila</i> female germline, in which a <i>vcp</i> loss-of-function mutant can be monitored in individual nurse\u00a0cells, which are relatively large and offer great resolution for examining mitochondrial morphology. <i>vcp<sup>K15502</sup></i> is a strong loss-of-function allele that has a P element insertion at the 5\u2019-UTR of <i>Drosophila VCP</i> gene (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chang et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Ruden et al., 2000</a>) and has been used to generate <i>vcp</i> loss-of-function clones in imaginal discs (<a href=\"#bib72\">Zhang et al., 2013</a>). The <i>Drosophila</i> ovary consists of numerous developing egg chambers. Each egg chamber develops from stage 1 to stage 14 and has three types of cells: follicle cells, nurse cells and the oocyte (<a href=\"#bib20\">Frydman and Spradling, 2001</a>). The germline complement of each egg chamber (15 nurse cells and the oocyte) derives from four sequential divisions of a single daughter of a stem cell. We utilized the FLP/FRT system (<a href=\"#bib56\">Theodosiou and Xu, 1998</a>) to create mitotic recombinants in which nurse cells were either wildtype (+/+), heterozygous (<i>vcp<sup>K15502</sup>/+</i>) or homozygous (<i>vcp<sup>K15502</sup>/vcp<sup>K15502</sup></i>) for the <i>vcp</i> loss-of-function mutation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). In this system wildtype and heterozygous <i>vcp</i> loss-of-function mutant cells carry 2 or 1 copies of ubi-mRFP.NLS (RFP) respectively, whereas the homozygous <i>vcp</i> mutant cells are RFP negative (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). Anti-ATP5A antibody is used to visualize mitochondrial morphology in nurse cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E\u2019</a>). Mitochondria in wildtype and heterozygous <i>vcp</i> mutant cells have a punctate morphology (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F and G</a>). In contrast, in homozygous <i>vcp</i> loss-of-function mutants mitochondria are more tubular and clumped (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H and I</a>). Together, these results suggest that endogenous VCP negatively regulates mitochondrial fusion or positively regulates fission."

First, we examined the expression levels of Mfn in the female germline, using mosaic analysis, as above. We used a tagged genomic rescue transgene (pCasper-Mfn-eGFP, a transgene construct with a GFP tagged Mfn under the control of its endogenous promoter,\u00a0a kind gift from Dr. CK Yao) to monitor the endogenous Mfn level as the existing anti-Mfn antibody lacked sufficient sensitivity. As expected, the genomic rescue Mfn-eGFP signal colocalizes with the mitochondria marker ATP5A in the nurse cells (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>). This signal is eliminated following Mfn RNAi, indicating that genomic rescue Mfn-eGFP is a reliable marker for endogenous Mfn (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>). In each egg chamber, <i>vcp</i> loss-of-function cells are adjacent to wildtype cells, providing an ideal opportunity to unambigously compare the levels of Mfn. As shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1J\u2013J\u2019\u2019</a>, nurse cells homozygous for a <i>vcp</i> loss-of-function mutant have greatly increased Mfn levels compared to wildtype and heterozygous <i>vcp</i> loss-of-function cells. The findings that endogenous VCP regulates Mfn <i>in vivo</i> are unexpected and important, as VCP is a highly abundant cytosolic protein with many targets and VCP does not show appreciable localization to mitochondria in unstressed cells."

VCP overexpression also caused a decrease in the levels of Mfn when Mfn was overexpressed (Mfn OE) using the IFM promoter, suggesting that VCP regulates Mfn post transcriptionally (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Conversely, VCP RNAi resulted in an increase in endogenous Mfn levels in a wildtype background, and an increase in total Mfn levels in the presence of Mfn OE (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). In contrast, VCP overexpression does not alter the levels of pro-fission protein DRP1 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>).

Indeed, full length VCP strongly interacts with Mfn (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). This is consistent with previous findings (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kim et al., 2013</a>). VCP has been shown to interact with substrate through the D1 ATPase domain, with the presence of the N domain being essential for the interaction (<a href=\"#bib34\">Meyer et al., 2012</a>). As shown in\u00a0<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a> , this is also the case with\u00a0the VCP-Mfn interaction. When the N domain of VCP is deleted, the strength of VCP-Mfn interaction is decreased, and it is undetectable when N and D1 are both deleted. In contrast, removal of the D2 domain has no effect on interaction between VCP and Mfn. Interestingly, Mfn levels in the input blot are decreased under conditions when VCP and Mfn interact, but not under conditions in which interactions are not observed, consistent with the hypothesis that direct interaction between VCP and Mfn is required for Mfn degradation. Together, these observations suggest that Mfn is a specific, direct target of VCP."

We and others\u00a0have shown that <i>PINK1</i> and <i>Parkin</i> function in the same pathway, with <i>PINK1</i> positively regulating <i>Parkin</i> to control mitochondrial integrity and quality control in <i>Drosophila</i> (<a href=\"#bib12\">Clark et al., 2006</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib65\">Yang et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Park et al., 2006</a>). Importantly, levels of Mfn are significantly increased in <i>PINK1</i> and <i>parkin</i> null mutants and downregulation of Mfn protein levels suppresses phenotypes in both mutants (<a href=\"#bib17\">Deng et al., 2008</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib66\">Yang et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Park et al., 2009</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib68\">Yu et al., 2011</a>). The results presented above suggest that expression of VCP, by decreasing the level of Mfn, could also suppress <i>PINK1/parkin</i> phenotypes.

This, along with their observation that VCP levels at mitochondria increased following expression of Parkin in the presence of CCCP, suggested a model in which VCP action on mitochondria requires recruitment by Parkin (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kim et al., 2013</a>). Because the EDTP-Gal4 driver used in these earlier experiments does not express at significant levels in flight muscle (<a href=\"#bib53\">Seroude et al., 2002</a>) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3J</a>, see GFP signals), we reexamined this issue.

VCP OE completely suppressed tissue damage and mitochondrial defects (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C\u2013C\u2019\u2019\u2019 and E\u2013E\u2019\u2019\u2019</a>).

The suppression observed by Kim, et al. is probably due to non-disjunction of the <i>PINK1</i> null flies. As predicted for a mechanism of VCP action that occurs through regulation of Mfn, VCP OE significantly reduced the accumulation of Mfn normally observed in both mutants (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>)."

MUL1 (MULAN/MAPL) is a RING-containing E3 ligase that acts as a negative regulator of Mfn in both <i>Drosophila</i> and mammals (<a href=\"#bib69\">Yun et al., 2014</a>). When overexpressed, it suppresses <i>PINK1</i> and <i>parkin</i> null mutant phenotypes by degrading Mfn, while loss of <i>mul1</i> leads to increased levels of Mfn. Thus, <i>parkin mul1</i> double null mutants have strikingly more severe mitochondrial phenotypes than those observed in flies lacking <i>parkin</i> alone (<a href=\"#bib69\">Yun et al., 2014</a>). Remarkably, expression of VCP resulted in a dramatic rescue of mitochondrial morphology due to lack of both <i>parkin</i> and <i>mul1</i> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G\u2013I\u2019</a>). Together, these results suggest that VCP-dependent suppression of <i>PINK1</i> null, <i>parkin</i> null and <i>parkin mul1</i> double phenotypes occurs through downregulaton of Mfn levels (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3K</a>). Together, our observations argue that VCP regulates Mfn levels under non-stress conditions. They also show that VCP-dependent regulation of Mfn does not require PINK1 or Parkin. However, these results do not exclude the possibility that Parkin activation further promotes VCP-dependent Mfn degradation under some situations."

                                "text": "To explore the basis of myopathy induced by VCP disease mutants we sought to create a model of IBMPFD in <i>Drosophila</i> muscle, as 90% of the IBMPFD patients show muscle phenotypes. Since <i>VCP</i> disease mutations are autosomal dominant, we characterized the consequences of disease mutant overexpression. The pathologies observed in IBMPFD patient muscle, and in muscle from VCP disease mutant transgenic and mouse knock-in models, include muscle cell death, changes in mitochondrial morphology, damaged tissue integrity, TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP43) mislocalization to the cytosol, and formation of autophagic marker p62 and ubiquitin aggregates, signs of multisystem proteinopathy (<a href=\"#bib25\">Ju et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Ritson et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Nalbandian et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Ritz et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Nalbandian et al., 2015b</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Weihl, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Ahmed et al., 2016</a>). Previous studies of VCP disease mutants in <i>Drosophila</i> muscle showed effects on tissue integrity and mitochondria cristae structure (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chang et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Kim et al., 2013</a>), but not other pathologies. We thus investigated the pathologies due to mutant VCP expression. We focused on expression of VCP R152H and A229E (corresponding to Human VCP R155H and A232E, hereafter referred to as VCP RH and VCP AE), as they are the most frequent and the most severe mutations identified, respectively (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Anti-VCP antibody blotting shows that VCP WT, VCP RH and VCP AE are expressed at comparable level in the fly's thorax (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). In wildtype flies, flies with IFM-Gal4 insertion, and flies with VCP WT expression, the muscle structure was healthy and intact 6 days after eclosion. No cell death was observed and mitochondria were densely packed and contained high levels of MitoGFP (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,D and D\u2019</a>). Muscles also displayed a well-aligned myofibril structure (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E and E\u2019</a>). Together these observations indicate that increased expression of VCP is not overtly toxic. In contrast, muscle from flies expressing VCP RH or VCP AE under IFM-Gal4 control (thereafter called VCP RH or VCP AE flies) showed extensive cell death (97\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.6% and 95.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.1% muscle are TUNEL-positive), defective MitoGFP signals (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D\u2019\u2019 and D\u2019\u2019\u2019</a>), and severely disrupted muscle integrity (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E\u2019\u2019 and E\u2019\u2019\u2019</a>). In addition, while in wildtype and VCP WT flies TDP43 was found in IFM nuclear and sarcoplasmic compartments, IFMs from VCP RH and AE flies showed a decrease in the intensity of the nuclear signal, and an increase in the intensity of staining associated with puncta in the sarcoplasmic area (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,F\u2013F\u2019\u2019\u2019</a>). Muscle from VCP RH and AE flies also contained large aggregates of anti-p62 and anti-ubiquitin staining. These were not observed in wildtype or VCP WT flies (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G\u2013H\u2019\u2019\u2019</a>). Importantly, the pathologies observed in flight muscle at day 6 post eclosion were not present at day 2 (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), suggesting the degenerative nature of the pathology, as with the human disease and mouse models (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kimonis et al., 2008a</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Custer et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Nalbandian et al., 2012</a>). Together, these observations indicate that IFM-specific expression of VCP RH and AE recapitulates a broad spectrum of IBMPFD disease pathologies and forms the strong basis for further investigation of disease mechanisms and treatment studies."

Since <i>mfn</i> overexpression results in significant mitochondrial phenotypes, tissue disintegration and cell death on its own (<a href=\"#bib69\">Yun et al., 2014</a>), we are unable to address this question completely due to a technical limitation. We were, however, able to bring about a mild increase in Mfn levels through addition of 2 copies of an <i>mfn</i> genomic rescue transgene in the background of VCP RH and AE expressing flies. Interestingly, this resulted in a suppression of the mitochondrial fragmentation and cristae phenotypes in 2-day-old VCP RH and AE flies (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) but not the pathology observed in VCP RH and AE fly muscles at 6 days (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3</a>).

To explore the functional significance of this decrease, we carried out mitochondrial fusion assays using fibroblasts from healthy controls and patients. Both cell populations were transfected with a plasmid encoding a mitochondrial matrix targeted, photoactivated GFP (PA-GFP). Following photoactivation of GFP within a region of the cell, the GFP fluorescence signal spreads and the intensity decreases as these mitochondria fuse with non-activated neighboring mitochondria. Thus, in this assay an increased rate of fluorescence loss corresponds to increased mitochondrial fusion activity (<a href=\"#bib36\">Mishra et al., 2014a</a>). In control cells, PA-GFP gradually decreases after photoactivation; in the VCP RH IBMPFD patient cells, the GFP signal decrease is significantly delayed (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C\u2013D\u2019, E</a>). These data suggest that the VCP RH mutation results in a decrease in Mfn 1 and 2 levels that lead to impaired mitochondrial fusion.

Various concentrations of drug or DMSO were included in food during the first to third larval instars, and muscle mitochondrial morphology was characterized at 2 and 6 days after eclosion. NMS-873 or ML240 feeding resulted in dramatic mitochondrial elongation in wildtype animals as visualized with MitoGFP using light microscopy (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A\u2013A\u2019\u2019</a>) and at the ultrastructural level using EM (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B\u2013B\u2019\u2019\u2019</a>). These phenotypes are similar to those observed following VCP RNAi (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C\u2013C\u2019\u2019</a>). In another respect, drug-treated animals developed normally (data not shown). The smaller mitochondria phenotype associated with overexpression of VCP WT was also significantly suppressed following feeding with 30 \u00b5M NMS-873 or 30 \u00b5M ML240 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C\u2013C\u2019\u2019\u2019</a>).

Strikingly, NMS-873 and ML240 feeding largely prevented muscle cell death caused by expression of VCP RH or AE (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A\u2013B\u2019\u2019</a>).

This partial suppression further suggests that these mutants are hyperactive. Finally, we note that VCP inhibitor feeding also resulted in significant rescue of a number of other phenotypes in VCP RH and AE expressing flies, including those associated with p62, ubiquitin and TDP43 (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8G\u2013L\u2019\u2019</a>).

Next, we explored the effects of these drugs on these changes in IBMPFD patient fibroblasts. In patient cells, a high concentration of ML240 (10 \u00b5M, with IC50 of 110 nM) or NMS-873 (10 \u00b5M, with IC50 of 30 nM) led to cell death, and NMS-873 directly inhibits mitochondrial respiration (data not shown). However, when lower concentrations of ML240 are used, robust rescue effects are observed (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>). As shown in <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>, immortalized IBMPFD patient fibroblasts have decreased Mfn 1 levels, and these are increased by treatment with 250 nM ML240 for 6 hr. Overall mitochondrial morphology of IBMPFD fibroblasts does not change in response to inhibitor treatment (<a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). However, in a more sensitive assay in which rates of fusion are measured directly, mitochondrial fusion defects in IBMPFD patient fibroblasts were significantly rescued after 6 hr\u00a0of treatment with 250 nM ML240 (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>). Finally, 50 nM and 100 nM ML240 treatment for 4 days also significantly enhanced the basal and maximal oxygen consumption rate (OCR) in patient fibroblasts (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C</a>). Similarly, 1 nM and 10 nM NMS-873 treatment for 6 days significantly enhanced the maximal oxygen consumption rate (OCR) in patient fibroblasts as well (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9D</a>). The fact that two inhibitors with different mechanisms generate similar results in terms of rescuing IBMFPD pathologies reduces the likelihood that these are off-targeting effects. Together, these data strongly support the effects of VCP inhibitors as potential therapeutic tools for IBMPFD disease."

VCP physically interacts with Mfn via domains that are also used to bind its substrates in other contexts. Thus, it is likely that Mfn is an endogenous VCP substrate. Here we provide the first <i>in vivo</i> evidence in muscle, the major disease tissue in IBMPFD, that Mfn is a specific endogenous target of VCP. Regulation of endogenous Mfn by VCP is unexpected, given that VCP is an abundant protein implicated in multiple cellular processes, but has not been shown to localize to mitochondria that are not depolarized by CCCP. We show that VCP-dependent removal of Mfn does not require Parkin or Mul1, E3 ligases known to ubiquitinate Mfn. How VCP brings about Parkin and Mul1-independent removal of Mfn requires further investigation."

We generated an IBMPFD disease model in adult <i>Drosophila</i> muscle, and used this system to monitor tissue pathology, and investigate the\u00a0molecular mechanisms by which VCP disease mutants function. We show that compared to VCP WT, expression of VCP disease mutants results in tissue damage, mitochondrial fusion defects and decreased levels of Mfn (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10B</a>). These phenotypes are opposite to those associated with decreased levels of VCP, or expression of an ATPase defective mutant version of VCP. Expression of VCP disease mutants, but not a VCP ATPase defective mutant or VCP RNAi, also suppresses the mitochondrial defects mediated by accumulation of Mfn in <i>PINK1</i> null<i>, parkin</i> null, and <i>parkin mul1</i> double null mutants. Taken together, these results suggest that VCP disease mutants do not function as loss-of-function or dominant negative mutants, but rather as dominant activated mutants in regulating Mfn levels and bringing about mitochondrial fusion defects. This conclusion is further supported by our findings that mitochondrial fusion and Mfn levels are also decreased in VCP disease mutant fibroblasts."

Together, these observations show that VCP-dependent regulation of Mfn does not require <i>PINK1</i> or <i>parkin</i>. The VCP-dependent degradation of Mfn we observe is also specific and unlikely to be mediated through a more general process such as mitophagy, as levels of several other mitochondrial proteins are not altered by VCP overexpression.

This also is consistent with models in which VCP mutants have increased activity (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chang et al., 2011</a>). In contrast, in cell culture studies Bartolome, et al showed that VCP disease mutant expression led to mitochondria respiratory chain defects, as did VCP RNAi (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bartolome et al., 2013</a>); Ritz, et al showed that VCP disease mutant expression impaired endocytosis to the same extent as that of VCP ATPase defective mutants (<a href=\"#bib49\">Ritz et al., 2011</a>). While the above studies can be interpreted as showing that VCP disease mutants function as loss-of-function or dominant negative mutants, these results do not rule out the possibility that disease mutants are hyperactive alleles. For example, an alternative interpretation of the impairment of respiratory chain function observed following VCP disease mutant expression or following VCP RNAi is that either an increase or a decrease in the levels of VCP activity leads to mitochondrial defects, which is what we observed in this study."

Importantly, suppression includes phenotypes beyond mitochondria (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10C</a>), involving TDP43, p62 and ubiquitin, suggesting that these inhibitors are likely to be effective in therapeutic settings. Of course, in order for VCP inhibitors to be useful as therapeutics, it will be necessary to inhibit mutant forms of VCP to an extent sufficient to suppress disease without bringing about a deleterious decrease in the activity of wildtype VCP. Our observation that <i>Drosophila</i> fed inhibitors are suppressed with respect to VCP disease phenotypes, but otherwise develop normally, suggests that this therapeutic goal may be possible. Finally, VCP disease mutants are associated with sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abramzon et al., 2012</a>), and hereditary spastic paraplegia (<a href=\"#bib15\">de Bot et al., 2012</a>) and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (<a href=\"#bib22\">Gonzalez et al., 2014</a>).

Flies carrying pCasper-Mfn-eGFP and pUASt-VCP RNAi two constructs were created through injection in a <i>w<sup>1118</sup></i> genetic background (pCasper-Mfn-eGFP, X chromosome; VCP RNAi line 2, second chromosome, Rainbow Transgenic Flies, Inc.). <i>vcp<sup>K15502</sup></i>, hsFLP22, neoFRT42D, and Ubi-mRFP.NLS, neoFRT42D were obtained from Bloomington stock center. <i>Drosophila</i> strains were maintained in a 25\u00b0C humidified incubator or at room temperature."

VCP is a type II ATPase that has predicted functions in many processes such as mitochondrial function, cell cycle regulation, DNA repair, ERAD, endolysosomal sorting, autophagy, and organelle biogenesis. This manuscript shows that overexpression of VCP in <i>Drosophila</i> indirect flight muscles resulted in smaller mitochondria whereas VCP RNAi caused mitochondria to elongate. Similarly, mitochondria in nurse cells with loss of function VCP alleles are more elongated or clumped. Muscle lysates with higher VCP levels displayed less Mfn expression and Nurse cells with loss of function VCP alleles showed increased Mfn levels. All these results are consistent with prior reports in mammals and flies that VCP mediates degradation of mitofusins. The authors do correct an apparent error in the literature by showing VCP OE rescues muscle phenotypes caused by both PINK1 and Parkin loss. In general, the paper is well written, the figures are nice, and the data are compelling. However, some data sets are not novel, and the reader has a hard time distinguishing what is novel and what is not. In addition, a number of important issues remain to be addressed."
