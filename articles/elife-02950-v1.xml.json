A major challenge is to determine how these components control the specificity and directionality of Notch signaling in developmental contexts. Here, we analyzed same-cell (<i>cis</i>) Notch-ligand interactions for Notch1, Dll1, and Jag1, and their dependence on Fringe protein expression in mammalian cells. We found that Dll1 and Jag1 can <i>cis</i>-inhibit Notch1, and Fringe proteins modulate these interactions in a way that parallels their effects on <i>trans</i> interactions. Fringe similarly modulated Notch-ligand <i>cis</i> interactions during <i>Drosophila</i> development. Based on these and previously identified interactions, we show how the design of the Notch signaling pathway leads to a restricted repertoire of signaling states that promote heterotypic signaling between distinct cell types, providing insight into the design principles of the Notch signaling system, and the specific developmental process of <i>Drosophila</i> dorsal-ventral boundary formation."

A major challenge is to determine how these components control the specificity and directionality of Notch signaling in developmental contexts. Here, we analyzed same-cell (<i>cis</i>) Notch-ligand interactions for Notch1, Dll1, and Jag1, and their dependence on Fringe protein expression in mammalian cells. We found that Dll1 and Jag1 can <i>cis</i>-inhibit Notch1, and Fringe proteins modulate these interactions in a way that parallels their effects on <i>trans</i> interactions. Fringe similarly modulated Notch-ligand <i>cis</i> interactions during <i>Drosophila</i> development. Based on these and previously identified interactions, we show how the design of the Notch signaling pathway leads to a restricted repertoire of signaling states that promote heterotypic signaling between distinct cell types, providing insight into the design principles of the Notch signaling system, and the specific developmental process of <i>Drosophila</i> dorsal-ventral boundary formation."

This mechanism releases the Notch intracellular domain (NICD), which translocates to the nucleus and interacts with the CSL complex (CBF1/Suppressor of Hairless/Lag1; also known as RBP-J\u03ba) to initiate transcription of target genes (<a href=\"#bib2\">Artavanis-Tsakonas et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Fortini, 2009</a>). In addition, Notch receptors and DSL ligands interact within the same cell in a process called <i>cis</i>-inhibition (<a href=\"#bib18\">del Alamo et al., 2011</a>). Overexpression and loss of function studies have revealed that DSL ligands can <i>cis-</i>inhibit the ability of a cell to receive a Notch signal, and that this effect depends on the interaction of the extracellular domains of the receptors and ligands in the same cell (<a href=\"#bib28\">Jacobsen et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">D'Souza et al., 2008</a>). Additionally, Notch receptors can reciprocally block DSL ligands in the same cell from sending signal (<a href=\"#bib3\">Becam et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">del Alamo and Schweisguth, 2009</a>). Previous in vitro studies support a simple model in which ligand <i>cis-</i>inhibition of receptors and receptor <i>cis-</i>inhibition of ligands represent a single process, with ligands and receptors in the same cell forming an inactive complex that prevents them both from interacting in <i>trans</i> with neighboring cells (<a href=\"#bib42\">Sprinzak et al., 2010</a>)."

To illustrate, we analyze the Notch signaling state of a cell, defined by the cell's quantitative ability of a cell to send or receive signal using a given ligand. We consider a cell expressing one type of ligand and one type of Notch receptor. If the cell produces more receptor than ligand, <i>cis</i> interactions efficiently remove most or all ligand but leave an excess of free receptor, enabling the cell to receive, but not send, Notch signals (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, top left). On the other hand, if the cell produces more ligand than receptor, <i>cis</i> interactions sequester the receptor, leaving an excess of free ligand, and permitting the cell to send, but not receive, signals (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, top right). In this simple case, the relative levels of ligand and receptor expression produce a sharp threshold between sending and receiving signaling states and thereby regulate the strength and direction of signaling between neighboring cells (<a href=\"#bib42\">Sprinzak et al., 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib43\">2011</a>). Consistent with the ratiometric nature of this model, many Notch-dependent developmental processes are highly sensitive to changes in receptor and ligand gene dosage, and show haploinsufficient mutant phenotypes (<a href=\"#bib14\">de Celis et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">de Celis and Bray, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Duarte et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Phng and Gerhardt, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Sprinzak et al., 2011</a>)."

Each ligand\u2013receptor pair can have a different interaction strength. For example, Dll4 interacts more strongly with Notch1 in <i>trans</i> than Dll1 (<a href=\"#bib1\">Andrawes et al., 2013</a>). Moreover, in vertebrates, Notch signaling processes typically utilize combinations of multiple receptors and ligands. For example, during angiogenesis, the sprouting of new blood vessels depends on complex spatial expression of Notch1, Dll4, and Jag1 (<a href=\"#bib5\">Benedito et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Phng and Gerhardt, 2009</a>).

On the other hand, Rfng increases the <i>trans</i> response to both ligands (<a href=\"#bib29\">Ladi et al., 2005</a>). Despite this work, the effects of Fringe on <i>cis</i> interactions, if any, remain unknown. Given the central role of <i>cis</i> interactions in determining signaling states, it is therefore essential to determine whether and how Fringes influence these interactions."

In the first stage of boundary formation, cells within the dorsal and ventral compartments of the wing disc signal to one another, forming a sharp stripe of Notch activation at the interface between the two cell populations. This Notch activity drives the expression of the Notch target genes E(spl), Wingless, and Cut, which together refine the expression patterns of Notch ligands and regulate the spatial pattern of Notch activation in subsequent stages (<a href=\"#bib12\">de Celis and Bray, 1997</a>). For this discussion, we focus on the initial step before these feedback mechanisms become active. Dorsal cells express Notch, Delta, Serrate, and Fringe, while ventral cells express Notch and Delta only (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). Because Fringe blocks Serrate-Notch <i>trans</i> signaling, dorsal cells do not signal to one another with Serrate, but can signal with Serrate to ventral cells (<a href=\"#bib27\">Irvine, 1999</a>).

The data presented here suggest that in dorsal cells, Fringe should strengthen <i>cis</i>-inhibition between Delta and Notch, while weakening <i>cis</i>-inhibition between Serrate and Notch. Because dorsal cells are initially in a receiving state (<a href=\"#bib12\">de Celis and Bray, 1997</a>), Delta expressed by these cells should not efficiently activate Notch in neighboring dorsal cells. Indeed, <i>Delta</i> mutant clones in the dorsal compartment do not affect adult wing margin formation (<a href=\"#bib19\">Doherty et al., 1996</a>), indicating that Delta-mediated signaling among dorsal cells, which occurs at most very weakly (<a href=\"#bib30\">Lei et al., 2003</a>), is dispensable for normal wing margin formation. The formation of a mutually inactivating, <i>cis</i>-inhibitory interaction between Delta and Notch could explain why dorsal cells do not strongly activate one another even though they express and are responsive to Delta (<a href=\"#bib19\">Doherty et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Lei et al., 2003</a>). At the same time, Fringe could allow Serrate and Notch to both remain available simultaneously (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>, dorsal), a state resembling that in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a> (far right panel). Thus, in the first phase, signaling would occur only from dorsal to ventral, as observed (<a href=\"#bib45\">Troost and Klein, 2012</a>). It is worth mentioning that the dynamic and complex expression patterns of Notch, ligands and Fringe in developmental contexts could superimpose additional layers of regulation on the effects of Fringe on <i>cis</i> and <i>trans</i> interactions between Notch and ligands."

In this second phase, ventral cells can <i>trans</i>-activate dorsal cells, which remain responsive to Delta. In principle, ventral sender cells could send to adjacent ventral cells; however it seems that at least in flies, Delta cannot send efficiently to cells that lack Fringe expression, and therefore in the flanking ventral cells Notch activity cannot achieve high enough levels to induce Cut and Wingless expression (<a href=\"#bib12\">de Celis and Bray, 1997</a>). This interpretation requires Fringe modulation of <i>cis</i> interactions, as observed here, and implies that signaling during boundary formation is heterotypic (<a href=\"#bib45\">Troost and Klein, 2012</a>). It will be interesting to see if other Notch-dependent boundary formation processes involve similar Notch signaling states and dynamics (<a href=\"#bib27\">Irvine, 1999</a>)."

Given that multiple Fringe proteins are co-expressed in many systems, we will need to examine how Fringe proteins combine to influence Notch signaling. Fringe proteins are also known to modify the DSL ligands (<a href=\"#bib38\">Panin et al., 2002</a>); however, a functional role for sugar modifications of the DSL ligands has not been forthcoming (<a href=\"#bib36\">Muller et al., 2014</a>). A potential effect of these modifications on <i>cis</i> interactions, if it exists, would also need to be accounted for in a more complete model. Finally, additional components beyond ligands, receptors, and Fringes may need to be considered in developing a more predictive view of Notch signaling. We anticipate that the experimental approaches developed here can be generalized to address these questions and provide a deeper understanding of the basic design principles of the Notch signaling system."

The cell suspension was screened for single-cell forward and side scatter and fluorescence intensity on a MacsQuant VYB instrument (Miltenyi Biotech, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). Data was imported into Matlab 2012 for analysis. Analysis included imposing a gate on the forward and side-scatter area to omit dead cells and doublets and then analyzing the single-cell fluorescence intensity for each channel."

For the real-time PCR reactions, 2 \u03bcl of cDNA was added to one reaction of SsoFast Probes Supermix (Bio-Rad). Each reaction was performed in triplicate. In parallel, three real-time PCR reactions were performed to measure \u03b2-actin levels in the sample, allowing us to compute a delta\u2013delta CT value for the gene of interest in our cell lines.

Instead, what we observed was a worsening of the wing margin loss phenotype, consistent with a further loss of Notch signaling. The phenotypes observed in the 1X Notch 3X Serrate 1X fringe animals are not simply an addition of the 1X Notch 1X fringe and 1X Notch 3X Serrate phenotypes; instead, we observe a qualitatively new phenotype \u2013 the \u201cClass 3\u201d L3 and L4 wing margin loss, that we had previously only seen among 1X Notch 4X Serrate animals. This defect is never observed in the 1X Notch 3X Serrate animals or in 1X Notch 1X fringe animals. Thus, the effect of Fringe loss in this background is only consistent with a picture where Fringe blocks the cis inhibition of Notch signaling by Serrate."

We examined the outcomes of removing a copy of fringe from 2X (wild-type) Notch 4X Serrate or 2X Notch 4X Delta flies. With two copies of fringe, these animals exhibit no wing margin abnormalities. However, removing a copy of fringe from the 4X Serrate animals results in Notch loss of activity phenotypes at the wing margin which was more severe than 3X Serrate 1X fringe animals shown in the original manuscript (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6K</a>). By contrast, removing a copy of fringe from the 4X Delta animals did not result in wing margin phenotypes. To reiterate the point above: if Fringe only affected Serrate-Notch trans activation, one would expect that removing a copy of fringe would lead to gain of Notch signaling defects, such as wing outgrowth, due to an increase in Serrate-Notch signaling. But not only did we not observe any gain of Notch signaling effects, we instead observed loss of Notch signaling phenotypes in a proportion of the animals that worsens as we increase the Serrate gene dosage. These results are consistent with a model in which the normal role of Fringe is to block Serrate-Notch cis-inhibition."

We directly compared the effects of transient expression of tagged and untagged ligands on Notch1 availability. We found that both the CFP-tagged ligands and untagged ligands fully reduced Notch1 availability to background levels, indicating that both ligands are capable of cis inhibition. Further, co-expression of Lfng preserved the ability of both tagged and untagged Dll1 to cis-inhibit Notch1, but weakened both tagged and untagged Jag1 cis-inhibition of Notch1. These results indicate that these key qualitative conclusions of the paper hold for untagged as well as tagged ligands. Together, these results show that the tagged ligand-fluorescent protein fusions proteins behave qualitatively similarly to their untagged counterparts, at least for these experiments."

In the Doherty et al. reference (an important paper that we now cite in the manuscript), the authors reported that ectopic Dl expression could activate Notch in dorsal cells.

In their <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H-H'</a> we see 3 Dl- clones. Clone 1 is large, spans both the dorsal and ventral compartments, and loses Serrate expression, most likely because the positive feedback loop between ventral Delta and dorsal Serrate is lost. Clone 2 is small and does not affect Serrate expression. Clone 3 is dorsal and seems to mildly affect Serrate expression. The authors interpret this as Delta trans-activation in the dorsal compartment. However, the effect is weak at best for a few reasons: First, the loss of Delta expression on the dorsal side does not lead to any wing margin defects in their work, indicating no physiological role for this putative homotypic signaling. Second, you can still see Serrate expression in the clone, indicating that it is at most a partial effect. Third, it appears to be based on only a single clone. Thus, the results in Lei et al do not provide strong evidence for signaling among dorsal cells and suggest that if it does occur it is certainly a less important effect than the heterotypic signaling between dorsal and ventral during boundary formation."
