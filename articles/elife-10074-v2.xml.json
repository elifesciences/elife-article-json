While many imprinted genes have been identified in plants, the functional roles of most of them are unknown. In this study, we systematically examine the functional requirement of paternally expressed imprinted genes (<i>PEGs</i>) during seed development in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. While none of the 15 analyzed <i>peg</i> mutants has qualitative or quantitative abnormalities of seed development, we identify three <i>PEGs</i> that establish postzygotic hybridization barriers in the endosperm, revealing that <i>PEGs</i> have a major role as speciation genes in plants. Our work reveals that a subset of <i>PEGs</i> maintains functional roles in the inbreeding plant <i>Arabidopsis</i> that become evident upon deregulated expression."

While many imprinted genes have been identified in plants, the functional roles of most of them are unknown. In this study, we systematically examine the functional requirement of paternally expressed imprinted genes (<i>PEGs</i>) during seed development in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. While none of the 15 analyzed <i>peg</i> mutants has qualitative or quantitative abnormalities of seed development, we identify three <i>PEGs</i> that establish postzygotic hybridization barriers in the endosperm, revealing that <i>PEGs</i> have a major role as speciation genes in plants. Our work reveals that a subset of <i>PEGs</i> maintains functional roles in the inbreeding plant <i>Arabidopsis</i> that become evident upon deregulated expression."

Recent screening of the seed transcriptome in various plant species revealed dozens to several hundreds of novel candidate imprinted genes in maize, rice, castor bean, and <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> (<a href=\"#bib14\">Gehring et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Hsieh et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Luo et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Waters et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Wolff et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Pignatta et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Xu et al., 2014</a>). While few reports demonstrate genes to be temporally imprinted in the plant embryo (<a href=\"#bib22\">Jahnke and Scholten, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Raissig et al., 2013</a>), the vast majority of imprinted genes has been observed in the endosperm, the ephemeral triploid tissue derived after fertilization of the diploid central cell with a haploid sperm cell. In most angiosperms the endosperm initially develops as a syncytium and cellularizes after a defined number of mitotic divisions (<a href=\"#bib29\">Li and Berger, 2012</a>). The right timing of endosperm cellularization is crucial for proper seed development, its failure results in deficient nutrient supply, which causes embryo arrest and eventually seed abortion (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hehenberger et al., 2012</a>). In <i>Arabidopsis</i>, endosperm cellularization is regulated by, among others, the type I MADS-box transcription factor AGL62. Loss of <i>AGL62</i> leads to precocious endosperm cellularization (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kang et al., 2008</a>), whereas increased <i>AGL62</i> expression correlates with delayed or failed cellularization (<a href=\"#bib12\">Erilova et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Tiwari et al., 2010</a>). Similar effects on endosperm development have been observed in response to interploidy hybridizations. While maternal excess hybridizations cause precocious endosperm cellularization and reduced seed size, the reciprocal cross leads to endosperm cellularization failure and seed abortion in an accession-dependent frequency (<a href=\"#bib36\">Scott et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Dilkes et al., 2008</a>). This phenomenon establishes a postzygotic reproductive barrier by preventing the formation of viable triploid seeds and has been termed \u2018triploid block\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib31\">Marks, 1966</a>). Dosage-sensitivity of the endosperm has been proposed to be a consequence of deregulated imprinted genes that are responsible for interploidy hybridization failure (<a href=\"#bib16\">Haig and Westoby, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Gutierrez-Marcos et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Kinoshita, 2007</a>). Indeed, in response to interploidy hybridizations many imprinted genes are deregulated (<a href=\"#bib23\">Jullien and Berger, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Tiwari et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Wolff et al., 2011</a>) and the paternally expressed imprinted gene <i>ADMETOS</i> (<i>ADM</i>) has been identified to be a causative gene responsible for abortion of triploid seeds upon paternal excess hybridizations in <i>Arabidopsis</i> (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kradolfer et al., 2013</a>). While the identification of <i>ADM</i> provided first evidence that imprinted genes can establish reproductive barriers, the question whether this is a more general phenomenon applying to other imprinted genes as well, remained unresolved."

We randomly selected 10 <i>PEGs</i> that were, with the exception of <i>VIM5,</i> strongly up-regulated in triploid seeds (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), and generated double mutants with the <i>omission of second division1</i> (<i>osd1</i>) mutant. The <i>osd1</i> mutation causes the formation of unreduced (2n) male gametes at a frequency of almost 100% (<a href=\"#bib8\">d'Erfurth et al., 2009</a>). Therefore, using <i>osd1</i> as pollen donor leads to the formation of almost 100% triploid seeds. We used pollen from plants homozygous for both mutations for crosses with wild-type Col mothers. Strikingly, 3 out of ten <i>peg</i> mutants were able to rescue triploid seed abortion; while crosses of Col x <i>osd1</i> gave rise to 8% non-collapsed seeds, crosses of Col with <i>suvh7 osd1</i>, <i>peg2 osd1</i> and <i>peg9 osd1</i> increased levels of non-collapsed seeds to 53%, 86% and 54%, respectively (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). The majority of non-collapsed triploid seeds germinated (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) and developed into viable seedlings (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Independent mutant alleles for <i>suvh7</i> and <i>peg9</i> introduced into the <i>osd1</i> background caused a similar rescue effect on triploid seeds (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). As for <i>peg2</i> no second mutant allele could be identified, we complemented the mutant phenotype with a genomic <i>PEG2::PEG2</i> construct that restored triploid seed inviability, revealing that the <i>peg2</i> phenotype is indeed caused by failure of PEG2 function (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). To test whether maternal loss of PEG function would impact on triploid seed rescue, we pollinated either <i>osd1</i> or <i>peg osd1</i> mutant pollen onto maternal plants mutant for the corresponding <i>peg</i>. However, no maternal effect on triploid seed rescue could be detected (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>), revealing no impact of the maternal alleles of <i>SUVH7</i>, <i>PEG2</i> and <i>PEG9</i> on the triploid block. Consistently, <i>SUVH7</i> and <i>PEG2</i> remained imprinted in triploid seeds (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). <i>PEG9</i> has no polymorphism between Col and L<i>er</i> accessions and could not be tested."

Galactose is a major constituent of the <i>Arabidopsis</i> endosperm cell wall in the form of pectic homogalacturan (<a href=\"#bib28\">Lee et al., 2012</a>) and altered <i>PEG9</i> activity could impact on cell wall composition. We tested whether rescue of triploid seed viability by <i>suvh7</i>, <i>peg2</i> and <i>peg9</i> was associated with restored endosperm cellularization. While the endosperm of triploid seeds was completely uncellularized at 8 DAP, endosperm cellularization in triploid <i>suvh7</i>, <i>peg2</i> and <i>peg9</i> seeds was almost complete at 8 DAP; only the over-proliferated chalazal cyst remained uncellularized (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>).

To test whether triploid rescue is generally connected with decreased expression of <i>AGLs</i> and <i>PEGs</i>, we generated whole-genome transcriptome data of seeds from triploid <i>adm</i>, <i>suvh7</i> and <i>peg2</i> mutants and analyzed expression of <i>AGLs</i> and <i>PEGs</i> that had increased mRNA levels in triploid seeds. Triploid seed rescue by <i>adm</i> and <i>suvh7</i> was associated with a similar decrease of mRNA levels of many <i>AGLs</i> and <i>PEGs</i> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>), suggesting that ADM and SUVH7 share a common mode of action. Strikingly, while <i>peg2</i> had the strongest effect on triploid seed rescue (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), the effect on gene expression was weakest among the three mutants. In particular, <i>AGLs</i> and <i>PEGs</i> that were strongly affected in <i>adm</i> and <i>suvh7</i> triploid seeds were only weakly affected in <i>peg2</i> triploid seeds (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>). This suggests that <i>peg2</i>-mediated triploid seed rescue occurs independently of normalized <i>AGL</i> and <i>PEG</i> expression and may affect a pathway downstream of either <i>AGLs</i> or <i>PEGs</i>. In support of this view, most genes down-regulated in triploid <i>peg2</i> seeds were similarly down-regulated in triploid <i>adm</i> and <i>suvh7</i> seeds (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 1</a>), suggesting that all three mutants affect a common downstream pathway. Genes commonly down-regulated in all three mutants were significantly enriched for genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism and in particular genes encoding for polygalacturonases (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Polygalacturonan is the backbone of the major primary cell wall component pectin, which is degraded by polygalacturonases (<a href=\"#bib3\">Atmodjo et al., 2013</a>). Pectin degradation is assumed to be a key step in the deconstruction of plant cell walls (<a href=\"#bib43\">Xiao et al., 2014</a>), therefore suppression of pectin hydrolysis in <i>adm</i>, <i>suvh7</i>, <i>peg2</i>, and <i>peg9</i> may be the key mechanism to induce endosperm cellularization and restore triploid seed viability. In agreement with this notion, <i>PEG9</i> encodes an enzyme that acts on galactose, the carbohydrate building pectin."

                                "text": "To test the hypothesis that endosperm cellularization failure in triploid seeds is a consequence of disturbed pectin degradation pathways, we analyzed expression of 173 genes acting in pectin degrading pathways (pectate lyases (GO:0030570), pectin methylesterases (GO:0030599) and polygalacturonases (GO:0004650)). Of those, 33 genes were upregulated in triploid seeds (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). In contrast, expression of pectin biosynthesis genes (<a href=\"#bib3\">Atmodjo et al., 2013</a>) was not negatively affected in triploid seeds (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), suggesting that pectin degradation rather than pectin biosynthesis is disturbed in triploid seeds. Most of the 33 pectin degradation genes remained repressed until the heart stage of embryo development in wild-type seeds (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>) and became expressed at the cotyledon stage of embryo development, concomitantly with endosperm degradation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). In concordance with restored endosperm cellularization in triploid <i>peg</i> mutants, expression of 27 out of 33 pectin degradation genes that were upregulated in triploid seeds was normalized in at least one of the <i>peg</i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Pectins are polymerized and methylesterified in the golgi and secreted into the cell wall as highly methylesterified forms. Subsequently, they can be modified by pectinases such as pectin methylesterases that catalyse the demethylesterification of homogalacturonans releasing acidic pectins, which can be visualized by ruthenium red binding (<a href=\"#bib10\">Downie et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Micheli, 2001</a>). Before endosperm cellularization, the ruthenium red signal was similar between diploid and triploid seeds (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>; <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), suggesting that there were no major differences in pectin synthesis and degradation between diploid and triploid seeds. At 6 DAP the wild-type endosperm was largely cellularized and only a weak ruthenium red signal could be detected (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>; <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), in agreement with pectin being deposited in the cell wall in a highly methylesterified form that is less intensively stained by ruthenium red (<a href=\"#bib32\">Micheli, 2001</a>). Consistent with the expression of genes encoding for pectin degrading enzymes in 6 DAP triploid seeds (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>), the ruthenium red signal in the uncellularized endosperm at 6 DAP seeds was substantially weaker compared to the signal in 4DAP seeds (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>; <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

Furthermore, there is only weak support for the claim that, in agreement with parental conflict theory, <i>PEGs</i> function as growth regulators. If these <i>PEGs</i> functioned as positive regulators of embryo growth during parental conflict, would one not expect <i>PEG</i> mutations to have paternal effects on embryo growth (i.e. reduced resources/growth of embryos)?"

A paternally imprinted gene in <i>Arabidopsis</i>, <i>ADMETOS</i> (<i>ADM</i>), influences endosperm cellularization and contributes to seed abortion in interploidy crosses, a phenomenon known as the triploid block. In this manuscript, the authors show that three additional paternally imprinted genes contribute to the triploid block. They hypothesise that the triploid block is circumvented by the suppression of pectin degradation. The identification of four imprinted genes that contribute to the triploid block in plants gives important insight into this developmental process and it is potentially influential to the field of imprinting."

Although they did not find obvious functions of these genes in wild-type seeds, clever genetic experiments revealed that at least three <i>PEGs</i> are required for the so-called triploid block, a post-zygotic reproductive barrier that originates in the endosperm. These results substantiate their earlier findings that imprinted genes, such as <i>ADM</i>, can establish post-zygotic hybridization barriers and thus may be key speciation genes. However, they do not establish a strong connection between their genetic results and expression analyses. If the authors want to make the claim summarized in the second to last sentence in the Abstract, then more work is needed with either existing resources or new experiments. That is, while the pathways appear to converge on genes that decrease pectin degradation, which may increase cellularization and subsequent embryo viability, it is impossible to evaluate how likely this is a cause or correlation based on the presented data. Overall, I agree that this work advances the understanding of the functional roles of imprinted genes in plants, but think more could be presented to get an idea of the underlying molecular mechanism."

This seems like an important aspect of their manuscript, but GO enrichments of commonly down-regulated genes are not necessarily strong indicators of common functions. For instance, they should mention how many genes were commonly down-regulated in the three triploid mutants (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a> shows 70 but this was only for genes up-regulated in triploid seeds). And they should show the levels of the 18 (?) commonly down-regulated genes suggested to be involved in pectin degradation (18 based on <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2013figure supplement 1</a>, but perhaps some of these may be overlapping?) in wild-type, triploid and triploid <i>peg</i> mutant backgrounds. It would be interesting to see the transcript levels of these pectin degradation genes in wild-type endosperm and these should be available from the microarray datasets generated by the Harada and Goldberg labs (Belmonte (2013) PNAS). Finally, they should stain the triploid seeds/endosperm (and controls) with a pectin dye such as Ruthenium Red to test for decreased pectin levels at multiple time points prior to cellularization. This may address whether decreased pectin is a cause or consequence of increased cellularization in the triploid mutants."

The use of multiple alleles, or complementation, and more detailed expression analyses builds a solid case for their hypothesis.

Recent genome-wide efforts discovered dozens to several hundreds of imprinted genes in various plant species; however, our understanding of the functional role of imprinted genes remained sparse. In this study we tested whether paternally expressed imprinted genes (<i>PEGs</i>) have a functional role during seed development in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. We report that loss of function of 15 <i>PEGs</i> did not impair seed development and neither caused a quantitative effect on seed size. Strikingly however, we identified three <i>PEGs</i> that establish postzygotic hybridization barriers, preventing successful hybridizations of plants that differ in ploidy. Therefore, together with the previously identified <i>PEG ADM,</i> we have discovered four <i>PEGs</i> in <i>Arabidopsis</i> that establish barriers to interploidy 2 hybridizations, revealing that PEGs have a major role as speciation genes in plants. Based on genome-wide transcriptome studies of three <i>peg</i> mutants we reveal that bypass of the hybridization barrier likely occurs by different mechanisms that converge on suppression of endosperm cell wall formation by suppressing pectin degradation. Collectively, our work reveals that a subset of <i>PEGs</i> maintains functional roles in the inbreeding plant <i>Arabidopsis</i> that become evident upon deregulated expression. We strongly believe that our results are of general interest to a broad public."
