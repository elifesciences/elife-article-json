In this study, we visualise epidermal ERK activity in living mice using an ERK FRET biosensor. Under steady-state conditions, the epidermis occasionally revealed bursts of ERK activation patterns where ERK activity radially propagated from cell to cell. The frequency of this spatial propagation of radial ERK activity distribution (SPREAD) correlated with the rate of epidermal cell division. SPREADs and proliferation were stimulated by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) in a manner dependent on EGF receptors and their cognate ligands. At the wounded skin, ERK activation propagated as trigger wave in parallel to the wound edge, suggesting that ERK activation propagation can be superimposed. Furthermore, by visualising the cell cycle, we found that SPREADs were associated with G2/M cell cycle progression. Our results provide new insights into how cell proliferation and transient ERK activity are synchronised in a living tissue."

In this study, we visualise epidermal ERK activity in living mice using an ERK FRET biosensor. Under steady-state conditions, the epidermis occasionally revealed bursts of ERK activation patterns where ERK activity radially propagated from cell to cell. The frequency of this spatial propagation of radial ERK activity distribution (SPREAD) correlated with the rate of epidermal cell division. SPREADs and proliferation were stimulated by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) in a manner dependent on EGF receptors and their cognate ligands. At the wounded skin, ERK activation propagated as trigger wave in parallel to the wound edge, suggesting that ERK activation propagation can be superimposed. Furthermore, by visualising the cell cycle, we found that SPREADs were associated with G2/M cell cycle progression. Our results provide new insights into how cell proliferation and transient ERK activity are synchronised in a living tissue."

ERK activation is triggered by the activation of epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFRs) through binding to their cognate ligands (<a href=\"#bib31\">Yuspa, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Sibilia et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Schneider et al., 2008</a>). Precursors of EGFR ligands including EGF, transforming growth factor \u03b1 (TGF\u03b1), and heparin binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF), are generated as membrane-bound proteins and are released through cleavage by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) including ADAM17 (<a href=\"#bib18\">Massagu\u00e9 and Pandiella, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Sahin et al., 2004</a>). The critical role of MMP-mediated release of EGFR ligands is corroborated by the close resemblance of the phenotypes among knockout mice of TGF\u03b1, ADAM17, and EGFR (<a href=\"#bib17\">Luetteke et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Peschon et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Franzke et al., 2012</a>).

During long-time time lapse imaging of the steady-state mouse skin, we noticed the epidermis occasionally appear with bursts of ERK activation patterns, where ERK activation is propagated from cell to cell in a radial wave. We named this new phenomenon as Spatial Propagation of Radial ERK Activity Distribution (SPREAD) and investigated characteristics, mechanisms, and roles of SPREAD. Single-cell analysis of SPREAD demonstrated that ERK activation in SPREAD originated from a cluster of a few cells and propagated up to about 50 \u03bcm with an average velocity of 1.5 \u03bcm/min. The amplitude of ERK activation and efficiency in propagation gradually decreased until SPREAD disappeared. Interestingly, the frequency of SPREAD was spatio-temporally associated with that of cell division. SPREADs were significantly stimulated by topical treatment of mitotic stimulation, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA). The induction was dependent on EGF receptors and the production of their cognate ligands by MMPs. The role of SPREAD in cell cycle progression was studied with Fucci mice, in which G0/G1 cells and S/G2/M cells are visualised by the expression of mKO2-Cdt1 and mAG-Geminin, respectively (<a href=\"#bib24\">Sakaue-Sawano et al., 2008</a>). Inhibition of SPREAD in Fucci mice led to significant delay of entry to G0/G1 phase from S/G2/M phase under TPA treatment, suggesting the role of SPREAD in G2/M progression of cell cycle."

In Eisuke mice used in this study, the nuclear ERK biosensor is expressed ubiquitously under the control of the CAG promoter (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). We imaged mainly ear epidermis of anaesthetised mice by two-photon excitation microscopy. The ear skin was stabilized between thermo-conductive silicon gum sheet and a cover glass to avoid movement derived from heart pulses and respirations (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Images were acquired every 5 min with a viewfield of 0.213 mm<sup>2</sup> in 2\u20133 \u03bcm steps using a 25X/1.05 water-immersion objective lens (XLPLN 25XWMP; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). In our imaging settings for two photon microscopy, skin cells were clearly imaged from hair follicles to the outer epidermal layers (stratum corneum). The level of FRET was analysed by the FRET/CFP ratio image and shown in intensity modulated display mode; eight colours from red to blue are used to represent the FRET/CFP ratio and the 32 grades of colour intensity are used to represent the signal intensity of the CFP image. The warm and cold colours indicate high and low FRET levels, namely ERK activity, respectively. Epidermal layers and dermis were clearly discerned by cellular size and collagen fibres visualised by second harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C\u2013D</a>). Autofluorescence was negligible in the skin of control mice on the same background (FVB/N) (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

Among eight SPREADs (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), \u2018SPREAD 6\u2019 is shown as the example of analysis (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). The centres of SPREADs were tentatively determined by visual inspections, which were optimised in later analyses. A square region was set to encompass the entire area of each SPREAD and individual cells were recognised by a segmentation programme (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Then, we attempted to fit the FRET/CFP value of each cell to a flat line of the average FRET/CFP value during the analysed period. If the line fitting was successful, the cell of interest was classified as a non-responder, otherwise the cell was fit to one to three sine curve(s) and was classified as a responder (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B\u2013C</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Based on the fitted data, the peak time and the amplitude of ERK activation were determined for each cell. The mean duration of the activation wave was 47 \u00b1 15 min (n = 582). By plotting the peak time against the distance from the centre of the SPREAD, the velocity of ERK propagation was determined as 1.93 \u03bcm/min (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). The mean velocity of the eight SPREADs was 1.5 \u00b1 0.3 \u03bcm/min (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). We also applied the square root fitting, which yielded similar coefficient determination values; therefore, we could not conclude whether the wave slows down during propagation (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). The amplitude of ERK activation of each responder cell decreased inversely with the distance of the cell from the origin of the SPREAD (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). The number of responders reached the zenith around 5 min after the initiation of SPREAD and subsequently decreased (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). The radius of SPREAD was determined as the distance from the SPREAD centre to the inflection point of the plotting of the fraction of responder cells. In the current analysis set-up, the duration and the radius of SPREADs were 30.5 \u00b1 5.6 min and 47.7 \u00b1 10.2 \u03bcm, respectively (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1F</a>). We performed this analysis in 8 SPREADs (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) and found that the size of SPREAD is positively correlated with the Max ERK activity in SPREAD and the wave velocity (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H\u2013I</a>)."

There are some differences between the propagation of ERK activation in vitro and in vivo, that is, SPREADs. First, the amplitudes of ERK activation in vitro are relatively constant during propagation, whereas in SPREADs the amplitudes of ERK activation decay during propagation. Second, ERK activation was propagated initially to almost all neighbouring cells in SPREADs, whereas ERK activity was propagated stochastically in vitro to the neighbouring cells. Third, SPREAD seems to emerge from a small fraction of cells, which is not the case in vitro."

Furthermore, we counted cell divisions by visual inspection of time lapse images and found that cell divisions were also more abundantly observed in the periods with frequent SPREADs than those with less frequent SPREADs. For example, while mice #102, #107, #112, #115, and #117 showed frequent SPREADs and cell divisions, mice #113, #114, and #120 showed much less SPREADs and cell divisions (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013B</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>).

The size of SA was inferred from the data shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>. Cell division in SAs was twice as frequent as that in Non-SAs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). It is noteworthy that about 50% of SPREADs emerged from within 50 \u03bcm of hair follicles, which occupied 26% of ear skin on average, indicating that SPREADs were initiated preferentially in, but not necessarily restricted to the para-hair follicle regions. To examine statistically whether there are hot spots for SPREAD generation, we tested the null hypothesis that the origins of SPREADs are distributed randomly. In this test, we adopted, as a test statistic, average distance of from the centre of each SPREAD to the nearest neighbour. Then, we generated the histogram on the null hypothesis by 100,000 trials of Monte Carlo simulations. We found that actual value of the test statistic was significantly lower than the expectation based on the histogram (p &lt; 0.01 in one-sided test), indicating that the SPREADs were significantly clustered (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>).

Upon topical TPA treatment, ERK activity was gradually stimulated, reaching a plateau approximately 6 hr later. ERK activity remained high for more than 24 hr and gradually decreased to the basal state by 48 hr (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Unexpectedly, we failed to observe an increase in the frequencies of SPREAD and cell division following a single TPA treatment (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G\u2013H</a>, TPA1). However, when we applied a second dose of TPA, according to the established protocol for tumorigenesis (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abel et al., 2009</a>), the frequencies of SPREAD and cell division were significantly increased 10\u201318 hr later (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C\u2013F</a>, and <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). This observation suggests that the increase in SPREAD frequency requires the induction and/or synchronization of cells in the replicating cycle upon the second TPA treatment. It has been shown that a single EGF pulse induces cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase by p53-mediated mechanisms and two EGF pulses promote cell cycle progression in mammary epithelial cells (<a href=\"#bib32\">Zwang et al., 2011</a>). Although the interval between the two EGF stimulations is only 7 hr in this in vitro study, similar mechanism may operate in the mouse epidermal cells, where the cell cycle period is markedly longer than in tissue mammary epithelial cells."

To examine if a similar mechanism operates in SPREADs, Eisuke mice were topically pre-treated with TAPI-1, an MMP inhibitor, or PD153035, an EGFR inhibitor, before the second TPA treatment in the double-TPA stimulation protocol (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Both inhibitors significantly decreased the frequency of SPREADs as well as that of cell division (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G\u2013H</a>). This is in line with the studies showing that TPA drives cleavage of pro-EGFR-ligands in a MMPs-dependent manner (<a href=\"#bib9\">Dethlefsen et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Izumi et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Le Gall et al., 2003</a>).

To examine the spatial and temporal variation in the proportion of cycling cells, images of 120 viewfields were acquired at various locations and times from 12 mice with ages ranging between 8 to 20 weeks. In each viewfield, 723 cells on average were classified into G0/G1 or S/G2/M phase based on the fluorescence intensities of mKO2-Cdt1 and mAG-Geminin (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). While the average proportion of S/G2/M cells was 12.2%, 2.5% of the viewfields showed more than 50% of S/G2/M cells, which might correspond to the periods of frequent SPREADs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, double-asterisk, and <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>, right panel). We then performed the double TPA treatment experiments with Fucci mice. In a preliminary experiment, we found that the fraction of S/G2/M cells after the second TPA application was increased from 61% to 95% by reducing the interval from 48 hr to 24 hr. Because high synchronization of cell cycle is helpful to examine the effect of inhibitors clearly, we applied this modified protocol to the following experiments (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Single TPA treatment alone drove a maximum of ca. 40% cells into the S/G2/M phase at 30 hr after treatment (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>, black line), followed by gradual decrease of the proportion of the S/G2/M phase. In contrast, the second TPA treatment increased the proportion of S/G2/M cells up to 95% within 12 hr (36 hr after the first TPA), which decreased to about 20% at 58 hr after the first TPA (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>, red line). PD0325901, a MEK inhibitor, cancelled the effect of the second TPA treatment (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>, green line). In contrast to the MEK inhibitor, TAPI-1 did not suppress the increase in the S/G2/M cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>, blue line). Surprisingly and importantly, however, the percentage of S/G2/M cells remained very high until 58 hr, indicating that TAPI-1 inhibited exit from the S/G2/M phase and entry to the G0/G1 phase (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D\u2013E</a>). Together with the reduced frequency of cell division in the TAPI-1-treated Eisuke mice (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>), this observation suggests that SPREADs play an important role in G2/M progression."

SPREADs were frequently observed in regions ca. 200 \u03bcm from the wound edge (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A\u2013D</a>, <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>). The induction of SPREADs during wound healing again raises the possibility that stem cell activation is involved in their emergence (<a href=\"#bib12\">Jones et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Arwert et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Blanpain and Fuchs, 2014</a>). As with TPA-induced SPREADs, both SPREADs and cell divisions during wound healing were significantly reduced by TAPI-1 or PD153035 treatment (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E,F</a>). Interestingly, in regions within about ca. 100 \u03bcm from the wounded edge, we found another type of ERK activation propagation pattern (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a> and <a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a>). Here, repetitive waves of ERK activation parallel to the wound edge emerged and propagated to cells ca. 100 \u03bcm from the wound edge (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). The ERK activation waves from the wound edge were suppressed by TAPI-1 treatment, suggesting the involvement of the similar mechanisms as that of SPREAD (<a href=\"#media5\">Video 5</a>). Single-cell analysis of the ERK activation waves from the wound was performed with segmentation and sine curve fittings as performed for SPREADs in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A\u2013C</a>). The velocity of ERK activity propagation was determined as 1.4 \u03bcm/min, which is similar to that in SPREAD (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a>). In contrast to ERK propagation in SPREAD, ERK activation waves from the wound edge maintained high ERK activity and propagation efficiency (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E\u2013F</a>), suggesting that ERK activation propagation can be synchronized and superimposed to generate trigger waves if a number of ERK activation pulses are evoked in close temporal and spatial proximity. These similarities and differences between SPREADs and ERK activation waves from the wound edge suggest the possible modification of the amplitude and efficiency in propagation depending on the surrounding environment of the cells."

ERK plays a central role as a downstream target of a variety of growth signal pathways and its tight regulation in time, place, and degree of activation determine cell behaviours such as cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation (<a href=\"#bib20\">Pouyss\u00e9gur et al., 2002</a>). Aberrant activation of ERK has been reported in many types of cancers especially by the oncogenic mutation of Ras and Raf (<a href=\"#bib22\">Roberts and Der, 2007</a>). Despite the significance of ERK activity regulation, technical limitations have obscured how growth signal activation is generated and propagated throughout the tissue."

Our long time lapse imaging of intact epidermis revealed radial propagation of ERK activity, where ERK activation originates from a few cells and propagate radially up to a radius of about 50 \u03bcm over 30 min until disappearance. We named this novel phenomenon as SPREAD and investigated its mechanism of ERK propagation and its role in cell cycle progression."

Our single cell analysis of SPREAD and inhibitor treatment revealed similarities and differences between the two patterns of ERK activation in vitro and in vivo. While they share in common the dependence of EGFRs and the production of their cognate ligands for ERK activation propagation, they differ in the efficiency and amplitude of ERK activation during propagation. Together with the difference in ERK propagation manner between SPREADs in steady-state skin and ERK activation waves, this suggests that ERK propagation pattern might be altered depending on the surrounding environment of the cells, including the involvement of stem cells, cellular density, and pathological conditions. The induction of SPREADs by double TPA treatment raises the possibility that the alterations in SPREADs could be involved in tumorigenesis. Thus, it will be of special interest to observe SPREADs in various pathological conditions including cancer."

Unlike the ERK activation propagation in tissue culture cells, however, we could not conclude whether the inhibitors against EGFRs and MMPs suppress ERK activation in the initiator cell or abrogate intercellular propagation of the ERK activation. This is because we cannot clearly identify the ERK activation pulse at single cell resolution due partly to the long interval of image acquisition in vivo and low signal-to-noise ratio of in vivo FRET imaging."

On the other hand, excessive ERK activation in G2 phase arrests cells in G2-phase. High ERK activity due to BRCA1 mutation, lack of Vaccinia H1-related (VHR) dual-specific protein tyrosine phosphatase, or stimulation by TPA induces G2-phase arrest (<a href=\"#bib30\">Yan et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Dangi et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Rahmouni et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Chambard et al., 2007</a>). Intriguingly, ERK activity is high around the G2/M phase in synchronized cells, but low when cells are arrested in M phase (<a href=\"#bib28\">Torii et al., 2006</a>). These previous reports together with our findings show that exquisite regulation of ERK activation in terms of time, place, and degree is required for cell cycle progression and the localised transient activation of ERK in SPREAD can contribute to it. To validate the causal relationship between SPREADs and cell cycle progression, we need to develop methods to control cell cycle and/or ERK activity with the single cell resolution in the tissues."

However, we speculate that the difference of the mouse strain will not affect our interpretation significantly by the following reasons. First, we observed significant increase of cell division in TPA-treated C57BL/6 mice, indicating that TPA promotes cell cycle in C57BL/6 as in FVB/N (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). Second, we observed SPREADs in C57BL/6 mice as in FVB/N, although quantitative data analysis was hampered by the fluorescence from the melanin granule."

Briefly, the level of FRET was shown by the FRET/CFP ratio image in intensity modulated display mode; eight colours from red to blue are used to represent the FRET/CFP ratio and the 32 grades of colour intensity are used to represent the signal intensity of the CFP image. The warm and cold colours indicate high and low FRET levels, respectively. For better presentation of SPREADs, a 3 \u00d7 3 median filter was applied to the FRET/CFP ratio images, and the resulting images were represented by a gold pseudo-colour. Both SPREADs and cell divisions were scored by visual inspections of time-lapse images.

First, on the CFP image a square region was set around the origin of the SPREAD. In the selected region, nuclei were automatically recognized with a segmentation program. With each nucleus, the FRET/CFP ratio was calculated for all time frames. Second, the FRET/CFP values of each nucleus were smoothened by 15-min moving averages. The smoothed values in each cell were fit with a flat line first. If the coefficient for the difference between the experimental data and the approximated data is less than 0.003, the cell was defined as a non-responder. Otherwise, values were fit with increasing number of sine curves until the coefficient became less than 0.003. The fitting was ended if the number of sine curves reached three. Cells fit by sine curve(s) were defined as responder cells. For the responder cells, the approximated sine curves were used to obtain the following parameters; peak time, the time when the FRET/CFP ratio reaches the zenith; amplitude, the FRET/CFP ratio at the peak time; duration, the duration during which the FRET/CFP ratio was higher than 50% of the peak ERK activity. Third, for each nucleus of the responder cells, the distance from the origin of the SPREAD was plotted against the peak time. The location of SPREAD origin was optimised by changing the ordinates of the SPREAD origin between \u221210 and 10 pixels and finding the position that gave the highest correlation efficiency between the data and the linear regression curve. Fourth, circles with increasing radius were drawn and the fraction of responder cells therein was obtained. When the fraction of responder cells became less than 50%, the obtained value was defined as the radius of the SPREAD. The data analysis was performed with MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick, MA)."

The second occurs in response to wounding, and is characterized by repeated, self-organizing wave fronts of ERK activation that do not decrease in amplitude. Both of these types of waves depend upon metalloprotease activity and MEK activation.
