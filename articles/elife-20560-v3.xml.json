Current methodologies, such as electron microscopy (EM) and super-resolution imaging techniques, can provide the precise localization of proteins, but are often limited to a small number of one-time observations with narrow spatial and molecular coverage. The diversity of synaptic proteins and synapse types demands synapse analysis on a scale that is prohibitive with current methods. Here, we demonstrate SubSynMAP, a fast, multiplexed sub-synaptic protein analysis method using wide-field data from deconvolution array tomography (ATD). SubSynMAP generates probability distributions for that reveal the functional range of proteins within the averaged synapse of a particular class. This enables the differentiation of closely juxtaposed proteins. Using this method, we analyzed 15 synaptic proteins in normal and Fragile X mental retardation syndrome (FXS) model mouse cortex, and revealed disease-specific modifications of sub-synaptic protein distributions across synapse classes and cortical layers."

Current methodologies, such as electron microscopy (EM) and super-resolution imaging techniques, can provide the precise localization of proteins, but are often limited to a small number of one-time observations with narrow spatial and molecular coverage. The diversity of synaptic proteins and synapse types demands synapse analysis on a scale that is prohibitive with current methods. Here, we demonstrate SubSynMAP, a fast, multiplexed sub-synaptic protein analysis method using wide-field data from deconvolution array tomography (ATD). SubSynMAP generates probability distributions for that reveal the functional range of proteins within the averaged synapse of a particular class. This enables the differentiation of closely juxtaposed proteins. Using this method, we analyzed 15 synaptic proteins in normal and Fragile X mental retardation syndrome (FXS) model mouse cortex, and revealed disease-specific modifications of sub-synaptic protein distributions across synapse classes and cortical layers."

It builds protein localization profiles of the average synapse that reveals the multiplexed, functional distributions of dozens of proteins. ATD uses a combination of physical sectioning and deconvolved wide-field imaging to generate an unparalleled combination of acquisition speed, volumetric resolution (100 nm by 100 nm by 50\u201370 nm) and molecular multiplexing (<a href=\"#bib47\">Wang and Smith, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Micheva and Smith, 2007</a>).

While individual synapses can vary greatly in their structure and molecular composition, on average, the synapse remains an ordered structure with a\u00a0specific distribution of protein populations (<a href=\"#bib25\">Heuser and Reese, 1977</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Chen et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Dani et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">De Camilli, 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Hunt et al., 1996</a>). These protein distributions are dictated by their functions (<a href=\"#bib38\">Park et al., 2012</a>). Thus, the\u00a0presynaptic proteins required for transmitter release, such as bassoon (BSN), are on average located closer to the active zone;\u00a0andproteins that\u00a0are\u00a0required to load transmitter into vesicles, such as vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGluT1), are distributed broadly within the presynaptic vesicle pool (<a href=\"#bib14\">Dani et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Micheva et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">El Mestikawy et al., 2011</a>).

This method extracts the averaged protein distributions within molecularly defined synapses drawn from large populations, and allows for the sub-synaptic visualization of multiplexed proteins. For example, in accordance to previous EM and STORM measurements (<a href=\"#bib14\">Dani et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Mineur et al., 2002</a>), BSN and VGlut1 distributions pre-synaptically peaked 25 and 60 nm, respectively, from the cleft, whereas GluR2 peaked 20 nm post-synaptically from the cleft. These spatial distributions are also useful for the characterization of novel proteins within specific synapse populations. We found that FMRP is distributed both pre- and post-synaptically, while its autosomal homologs FXR1 and FXR2 are predominantly distributed post-synaptically. Interestingly, in fragile X mental retardation 1 knock out mice (<i>Fmr1</i> KO), a well-accepted model of FXS (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bear et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bassell and Warren, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Graziano et al., 2008</a>)\u00a0in\u00a0whichFMRP is no longer expressed, we found that synaptic FXR2 distribution is disrupted while FXR1 remains unperturbed. This suggests that proper synaptic FXR2 localization requires FMRP and a FXR2 deficit could be part of the pathophysiology of FXS synapse dysfunction."

Specific synaptic proteins can be used to\u00a0define synaptic axes with a defined orientation (post-synaptic to presynaptic) by connecting centers of mass from post-synaptic density protein 95 (PSD95) to presynaptic synapsin-1 (SYN) for glutamatergic synapses (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>), and post-synaptic gephyrin (GPHN) to presynaptic vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT) for GABAergic synapses. The centers of mass are calculated from segmented puncta objects as defined by a thresholded, three-dimensional (3D)\u00a0connected component analysis (see 'Methods').

To facilitate the interpretation and analysis of these volumes, two-dimensional\u00a0(2D) histograms are created by rotationally projecting all the centers of a single protein into a 2D plane. The bins of these 2D histograms are half slices of a spherical shell (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Rotational projection is used to insure that the distance of all centers from the origin is maintained in the histogram (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Moreover, these histograms are generated as a half distribution because there is no rotational constraint along the synaptic axis (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>).

VGluT1 is one of two presynaptic glutamate transporters that\u00a0are\u00a0essential to the loading of glutamate into cortical synaptic vesicles, the other being VGluT2 (<a href=\"#bib20\">Fremeau et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Kaneko and Fujiyama, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Siksou et al., 2007</a>). The presynaptic localization of VGluT1 is reflected by the histogram (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E\u00a0and F</a>). Moreover, the histogram is also able to resolve the exclusion of VGluT1 from the post-synaptic zone, which is demonstrated by the below background dark area in the post-synaptic region (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E\u00a0and F</a>). To further confirm the fidelity of the method in characterizing synaptic protein distributions, the association of the VGluT1 centers and their synaptic axes were randomized. The resulting random raw histogram appears similar to the bin volume histogram (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D\u00a0and G</a>), as the probability that a center will\u00a0falls within a bin in an unbiased dataset is solely dependent upon the volume of the bin, thus the resulting normalized density histogram is flat and featureless (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H</a>)."

This generates an estimated percent probability that a protein center can be found at a position in space in the average synapse of that class; for example, a probability that VGluT1 proteins will be found in VGluT1 class synapses in layer 4 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). The shape of the VGluT1 empirical probability distribution in Layer 4 VGluT1 synapses is asymmetrical in regards to the synaptic axis (PSD95 to SYN), with a wider distribution along the axis and a narrower distribution perpendicular to it (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). This is\u00a0likely to\u00a0reflect a distribution of synaptic vesicles in\u00a0which the major pool of vesicles, in excitatory synapses, resides axially behind the active zone (<a href=\"#bib25\">Heuser and Reese, 1977</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Park et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Mineur et al., 2002</a>). To further simplify the visualization and statistical comparison of these distributions, the 2Dprobability histograms are rotationally projected to a one-dimensional (1D)\u00a0plot (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). In this plot, the origin is the PSD95 centers of the nearly 40,000 VGluT1 synapses registered in the dataset. The putative synaptic cleft (red dashed line,\u00a0<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>)is\u00a050\u00a0nm from the origin,\u00a0as estimated from previous EM and super-resolution measurements (<a href=\"#bib14\">Dani et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Mineur et al., 2002</a>). Assessing the plot, the VGluT1 distribution dips in the post-synaptic zone, demonstrating the expected anti-correlation of VGluT1 localization to the post-synapse. Furthermore, the distribution peaks at\u00a0~125\u2013200 nm from PSD95 or about 75\u2013150 nm from the cleft (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). These measurements corroborate previous analysis of presynaptic vesicle pools using EM (<a href=\"#bib35\">Mineur et al., 2002</a>) or super-resolution microscopy, demonstrating that this method provides an accurate visualization of protein distribution in synapses."

More importantly, while the empirical glutamate receptor distributions are similar to each other, they are significantly different from the empirical presynaptic protein distributions (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013F</a>, Chi-square test p\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.01, see 'Methods').

FXS is a leading cause of congenital mental retardation that is mediated by the loss of FMRP, an RNA-binding protein that inhibits activity dependent translation in dendrites (<a href=\"#bib15\">Darnell et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Huber et al., 2002</a>). Canonically, FMRP is considered to be a post-synaptic protein, but recent reports also suggest that it can be detected in presynaptic terminals (<a href=\"#bib11\">Christie et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Akins et al., 2012</a>). In our analysis, FMRP is indeed localized post-synaptically in both VGluT1 and VGluT2 synapse classes across Layers 4 and 5 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A and\u00a0B</a>). Moreover, the empirical distribution of post-synaptic FMRP, unlike that\u00a0of the post-synaptic glutamate receptors, peak away from the synaptic cleft (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A\u00a0and B</a>), which concurs with its role as a post-synaptic regulatory molecule (<a href=\"#bib15\">Darnell et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Huber et al., 2002</a>). Interestingly, in Layer 4 synapses only, a second FMRP peak can be detected presynaptically (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A\u00a0and B</a>, black arrows). This peak is not pronounced in the empirical distribution of Layer 5 synapses (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A\u00a0and B</a>), which suggests that although post-synaptic FMRP localization is a general feature, the bulk of presynaptic FMRP is directed to Layer 4 rather\u00a0than\u00a0to Layer 5."

Four datasets were generated (for\u00a0Layers 4 and 5 of both WT and <i>Fmr1</i> KO mice), each covering a volume of 60 \u00b5m x 10 \u00b5m x 210 nm and consisting of both EM and light level immunohistochemistry (VGluT1, FMRP and FXR2). Using hand classification, we identified 115 WT Layer 4 synapses, 199 WT Layer 5 synapses, 113 KO Layer 4 synapses and 118 KO Layer 5 synapses. After the alignment of EM and light level data (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C and\u00a0D</a>), pre- and post-synapses are identified in EM using the presence of synaptic vesicles and the PSD (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E F</a>). Using conjugate FMRP light level data in combination with hand-classified synapses, FMRP-containing synapses were identified (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E and F</a>). The distance to cleft from the FMRP punctum center\u00a0was measured and graphed on a histogram (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G and H</a>). The histogram of FMRP distance to cleft in EM (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G and H</a>) clearly reproduces the wide-field, synapse alignment result (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). The EM histograms are narrower in distance because the EM volumes in the z-axis are significantly smaller than an actual synapse (210 nm), whereas this is not the case in the wide-field dataset (EM volumes are 2.8 \u00b5m). In our EM data, Layer 4 clearly has more presynaptic FMRP (230% more) than layer 5, which corroborates our SubSynMAP analysis."

Yet, their involvement in FXS and their synaptic localization and function is mostly unknown. The application of our synapse analysis method demonstrates that, across synapse classes and cortical layers, FXR1P and FXR2P unlike FMRP are preferentially localized to the post-synaptic region (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A\u2013D</a>, <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013D</a>); but like FMRP, the distributions of FXR1P and FXR2P peak away from the synaptic cleft (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A\u2013D</a>\u00a0and <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013D</a>). Furthermore, by assessing the\u00a0distributions of these proteins in <i>Fmr1</i> KO animals, we reveal that the loss of FMRP does not affect the synaptic localization of FXR1P (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1, p</a>\u00a0&gt;\u00a00.01), but causes a significant depletion of post-synaptic FXR2P in both Layers 4 and 5, as measured both in SubSynMAP (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A\u2013D</a>, p &lt; 0.01) and EM (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E and F</a>, <a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). This suggests that the synaptic localization of FXR2P depends on FMRP. However, we do not know whether this coupling of expression proceeds through the FXR2P\u2013FMRP heteromeric complexes (<a href=\"#bib11\">Christie et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Tamanini et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Ceman et al., 1999</a>) or through FMRP regulation of FXR2P mRNA (<a href=\"#bib4\">Ascano et al., 2012</a>).

SubSynMAP uses the statistical power of large datasets to reveal discrete variations in the sub-synaptic distribution of synaptic proteins. For example, we can differentiate presynaptic vesicular proteins (such\u00a0as\u00a0SYNPH, VGluT1) from presynaptic active zone proteins (such\u00a0as\u00a0BSN). The comparison of these distributions can provide meaningful insight into the potential function of these proteins. For example, the greater\u00a0localization to the synaptic cleft\u00a0region\u00a0of GLAST as compared to GLT1\u00a0suggests that GLAST plays a more important role in the direct clearing of glutamate in the cleft, whereas GLT1 localization reflects its known function as a peri-synaptic regulator of metabotropic glutamate receptor signaling (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bar-Peled et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Tzingounis and Wadiche, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Reichelt and Kn\u00f6pfel, 2002</a>). Furthermore, our method is dramatically faster and more cost effective than traditional sub-synaptic protein analysis.\u00a0Our\u00a0work using\u00a0EM to optimize, image and analyze 545 synapses for two\u00a0proteins (FMRP and FXR2P)\u00a0took over a year and tens of thousands of dollars , whereas\u00a0the optimization, imaging and analysis of over 500,000 synapses for 15 proteins, took less than 1 month using SubSynMAP."

Methods such as EM provide detailed visualization of sub-synaptic proteins with exceptional resolution (&lt;5 nm), SubSynMAP cannot be measured along those traditional resolution metrics, nor can its data be interpreted along those lines. In SubSynMAP, the resolution does not come from a single high-resolution snap shot, but rather from the combined distribution of tens of thousands of observations at lower resolution (100 nm<sup>3</sup>). The distributions in SubSynMAP are not meant to represent the location of any one protein at any one time, which is information that EM can\u00a0provide. Instead, it represents the likelihood of finding that protein in that location of the prototypical synapse of a specific class if you make many observations. Thus, it does not resolve a protein\u2019s location per se, as one would in immunoEM, which can be used to resolve a protein on synaptic vesicles. SubSynMAP can,\u00a0however, tell you,\u00a0by comparing\u00a0the distribution of a particular protein with\u00a0that\u00a0of known vesicle proteins, whether a protein is likely to be a vesicle protein."

In this paper, all excitatory synapses use an axis described by a line drawn from the center of a PSD95 puncta to a synapsin puncta, whereas inhibitory synapses use a line from gephyrin to VGAT. In practice, we found no difference in resultant SubSynMAP histograms from axes generated from PSD95 to vesicle proteins; for example, there are no differences in the histogram for synaptic vesicle protein 2\u00a0(SV2) and that for vesicle pool related structural proteins such as synapsin. Nevertheless, one cannot fully rule out the possibility that data generated from different synaptic axes are not identical. Thus, comparison across such different axes should be verified with EM when possible."

Traditional super-resolution or ultra-structural analysis routinely involves small sample sizes in terms of animals, synapse number and imaged volume. In this study, over a half million synapses from 20 animals across two cortical layers were analyzed, creating an overall image that is more likely to reflect the reality of the synapses studied. The extent of the coverage, both in numbers and in space, allows the analysis of synapse classes that are rare in relation to the total synapse population. For example, Layer 5 VGluT2 synapses only represent about eight percent of the total synapse population, and of that eight percent, only about a quarter have FMRP in them. Thus, a direct sample of 100 synapses in Layer 5 using traditional methods will yield, at most, two VGluT2 synapses with FMRP, a quantity that is mostly anecdotal. In our study, we are able to analyze a total of 487 Layer 5 VGluT2 FMRP synapses, which provides a more robust measure of their structure."

This data gap is caused by the potential diversity of synapse modifications in neurological diseases, which requires large sample sizes to obtain significant numbers of similarly perturbed synapses. This is extremely challenging for current methods of structural analysis. Our method can fill this data gap. We demonstrated in <i>Fmr1</i> KO mice that we are able to reveal specific changes in protein\u00a0locations mediated by FMRP loss within defined synapse classes. We localized proteins\u00a0(FXR1P and FXR2P), within normal and diseased contexts, whose synapse localization was previously unknown. Finally, the large-scale quantification of small, complex, stereotypically structured protein complexes is not just a problem in neuroscience, but in biology in general. SubSynMAP, while designed for synapse analysis, can be generalized to a much wider array of cellular structures and should provide a new level of analytical power for other disciplines such as immunology and cancer\u00a0studies that require subcellular resolution\u00a0investigations\u00a0of large tissues."

While the 3D weighted centroid calculations do provide sub-pixel coordinates, the very nature of the calculation being made on a discrete dataset increases the probability of certain sub pixel distances. The reason why these halos are more apparent in some instances is because the background is higher for those proteins; and the reason for a higher background is caused by: (1) fewer pooled synapses, some synapses are rarer and thus their histograms involve smaller\u00a0protein numbers; and (2) some proteins have more background, because all protein centers within a 1 \u00b5m radius sphere are incorporated into the histogram. This means that even protein puncta not associated with that particular synapse can be included.

In short, classification occurs in a 1 \u00b5m radius sphere centered on the origin (PSD95 for excitatory synapses and gephyrin for inhibitory synapses). For example, a VGluT1 synapse will have PSD95 at the postsynaptic termini and synapsin at the presynaptic termini. Moreover, VGluT1 will be closer to synapsin than to\u00a0PSD95. Thus, the algorithm will require the third point (VGluT1) to be closer to synapsin by a specified factor than it is to PSD95 in\u00a0order\u00a0for it to classify the grouping as a synapse. In some instances, after this initial classification step, a synaptic axis still retains more than one third point (VGluT1 puncta). If that is the case, then the algorithm looks through the entire dataset and removes sharing of the third point in a manner that maximizes the number of possible synaptic axis with third points. If a decision must be made regarding a single third point that is shared by two synaptic axes, then the axis that is the closest to the third point is selected. Finally, once the ownership of the third point has reached parsimony, a final check is applied to ensure that there is no duplication of the synaptic axis. This situation is rare in practice, but if it does occur, the axis with the smallest magnitude is preferred."

All PSD95 or gephyrin centroids were placed at the origin of the x,y,z coordinate system, and the centroids of a synaptic vesicle protein in each synapse were each placed at an appropriate position x, along the x-axis. Thus, the x axis is equivalent to the 'synaptic axis' in the coordinate system. The positions of other protein centroids within a 1 \u00b5m sphere of the origin of each synapse were rotated in the same way to appropriate positions in the x,y,z coordinate system. To provide a visual representation of the 2D distributions of these proteins in the x,y plane, with respect to the synaptic axis, the centroids of proteins were binned in the x,y plane as follows. The x coordinate of a centroid was given as its distance from the origin along the x-axis (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). The y coordinate was given as its distance from the origin along the y-axis. The x coordinates of the centroids were binned within semi-circular bins of fixed width centered on the y-axis, and the y-coordinates were binned within semi-circular bins of the same fixed width centered on the x-axis. The semi-circular bins were mirrored along the x-axis (synaptic axis) to produce a circular image (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). This creates a projection of centroids with x,y coordinates that are binned into circular bins of fixed width centered on the origin. To correct for the fact that the circular bins effectively draw from spherical bins in 3D, the number of centroids in each bin is divided by the volume of the corresponding spherical bin to give the density of centroids in each bin. This normalization ensures that the random probability of a centroid falling within each bin is equal."

This is because the explanations in the Results and Materials and methods section are unclear and often ambiguous. The verbal descriptions of <a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2</a>, <a href=\"#fig3\">3,</a> and <a href=\"#fig4\">4</a>, their respective figure legends, and the work flow described in the methods section all must be thoroughly revised to make more clear the nature of the coordinate systems and the axes along which projections are made. After much re-reading, here is our understanding of what was done. The synaptic vectors formed by connecting the centroids of PSD-95 staining, or gephyrin staining and the centroids of staining for a vesicle protein were aligned in an x,y,z coordinate system. All PSD-95 or gephyrin centroids were placed at the origin of the x,y,z coordinate system, and the centroids of a synaptic vesicle protein in each synapse were each placed at an appropriate position x, along the x-axis. Thus, the x axis is equivalent to the \"synaptic axis\" in the coordinate system. The positions of other protein centroids within a 1 \u00b5m sphere of the origin of each synapse were rotated in the same way to appropriate positions in the x,y,z coordinate system. To provide a visual representation of the 2D distributions of these proteins in the x, y plane, with respect to the synaptic axis, the centroids of proteins were binned in the x-y plane as follows. The x coordinate of a centroid was given as its distance from the origin along the x-axis (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). The y coordinate was given as its distance from the origin along the y-axis. The x coordinates of the centroids were binned within semi-circular bins of fixed width centered on the y-axis, and the y-coordinates were binned within semi-circular bins of the same fixed width centered on the x-axis. The semi-circular bins were mirrored along the x-axis (synaptic axis) to produce a circular image (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). This creates a projection of centroids with x,y coordinates that are binned into circular bins of fixed width centered on the origin. To correct for the fact that the circular bins effectively draw from spherical bins in 3D, the number of centroids in each bin is divided by the volume of the corresponding spherical bin to give the density of centroids in each bin. This normalization ensures that the random probability of a centroid falling within each bin is equal. If the above description is not correct, the authors need to clarify the work flow further. In several figures, the density distributions are represented on a percentage scale, but the exact calculation by which the percentages were determined needs to be stated explicitly. The explanation of this process in a revised manuscript needs to be as clearly written as explanations of other methods were in earlier papers by the same authors."

The error rate was first measured using computer to hand classification comparisons (Wang et al., 2014)[Supplemental Figure 1 \u2013 of that paper], and then reconfirmed using EM fiducials (<a href=\"#fig8\">Author response image 1</a>). In terms of marker colocalization, having looked at thousands of multiplexed images in 3D, it is not uncommon to find a VGluT1 and Synapsin colocalization without it being at a synapse. This due to the nature of the proteins where VGluT1 and Synapsin are more broadly expressed in neurons while a protein such as PSD95 are mostly localized to the synapse. This would biologically suggest two things, the site of production of these proteins (produced in the cell body and shipped to the synapses) and that biologically transport vesicles might harbor both proteins. The causes of false positive and negatives for the PSD95 and Synapsin antibodies used in this study have been explored using conjugate AT and EM (Collman et al., 2015)[Figures 9 and 10 \u2013 of that paper]. In short, false negative rates are due to failure of antibody detection, and false positives are due to circumstantial colocalization which occurs at low probability."

In short, in these distributions we are not resolving individual proteins at high resolution, as one would with EM, we are combining tens of thousands of observations that each individually have an amount of uncertainty attached (the original resolution is 100 nm<sup>3</sup>) but together provides an unequivocal localization map of that protein within the synapse. Thus, it would be difficult to place an exact number on the resolution, as traditional methods of visualizing a standard or ruler does not apply here. Thus, throughout the paper we have toned down the nanometer claims, e.g., first sentence of paragraph three in Discussion section \u201cdescription of the nanometer substructure\u2026\u201d is now \u201cdescription of the substructure\u201d."

As to the question regarding the post-synaptic marker being outside of the imaged volume, there are two answers. In terms of synapse classification, this is not possible, without post-synaptic PSD95 the algorithm will not classify a synapse. Thus, if there is a synapse with a PSD label outside of the search area then it will be a false negative that would be revealed in the above error analysis (<a href=\"#fig8\">Author response image 1</a>). However, outside of the definition of the synapse and the synaptic axis there is the possibility that a PSD protein lies outside of the 1um radius sphere we are focusing on. This would be a false negative in the sense that it won\u2019t contribute to the 3D histogram, but in our tests using larger spheres, this does not contribute to the signal we see.
