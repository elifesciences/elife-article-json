Here, we demonstrate that autophagy is essential for maintenance of balanced CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses in the intestine. Selective deletion of <i>Atg16l1</i> in T cells in mice resulted in spontaneous intestinal inflammation that was characterised by aberrant type 2 responses to dietary and microbiota antigens, and by a loss of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T<sub>reg</sub> cells. Specific ablation of <i>Atg16l1</i> in Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T<sub>reg</sub> cells in mice demonstrated that autophagy directly promotes their survival and metabolic adaptation in the intestine. Moreover, we also identify an unexpected role for autophagy in directly limiting mucosal T<sub>H</sub>2 cell expansion. These findings provide new insights into the reciprocal control of distinct intestinal T<sub>H</sub> cell responses by autophagy, with important implications for understanding and treatment of chronic inflammatory disorders."
