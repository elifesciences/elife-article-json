Here we report that CNS-specific <i>Snx6</i> knockout mice exhibit deficits in spatial learning and memory, accompanied with loss of spines from distal dendrites of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells. SNX6 interacts with Homer1b/c, a postsynaptic scaffold protein crucial for the synaptic distribution of other postsynaptic density (PSD) proteins and structural integrity of dendritic spines. We show that SNX6 functions independently of retromer to regulate distribution of Homer1b/c in the dendritic shaft. We also find that Homer1b/c translocates from shaft to spines by protein diffusion, which does not require SNX6. Ablation of SNX6 causes reduced distribution of Homer1b/c in distal dendrites, decrease in surface levels of AMPAR and impaired AMPAR-mediated synaptic transmission. These findings reveal a physiological role of SNX6 in CNS excitatory neurons."

Here we report that CNS-specific <i>Snx6</i> knockout mice exhibit deficits in spatial learning and memory, accompanied with loss of spines from distal dendrites of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells. SNX6 interacts with Homer1b/c, a postsynaptic scaffold protein crucial for the synaptic distribution of other postsynaptic density (PSD) proteins and structural integrity of dendritic spines. We show that SNX6 functions independently of retromer to regulate distribution of Homer1b/c in the dendritic shaft. We also find that Homer1b/c translocates from shaft to spines by protein diffusion, which does not require SNX6. Ablation of SNX6 causes reduced distribution of Homer1b/c in distal dendrites, decrease in surface levels of AMPAR and impaired AMPAR-mediated synaptic transmission. These findings reveal a physiological role of SNX6 in CNS excitatory neurons."

Mice that have been genetically modified to lack SNX6 in their brains have fewer spines on their dendrites compared with normal mice. This was particularly true for dendrites that contain AMPAR, a protein that receives signals sent across synapses. Niu, Dai, Liu et al. showed that SNX6 interacts with another protein called Homer1b/c and is responsible for distributing this protein in dendrites far from the cell body. The Homer1b/c protein helps to stabilize dendritic spines and to regulate the number of AMPAR proteins within them. Mice that lack SNX6 therefore have less Homer1b/c in the dendrites furthest from the cell body, and fewer spines on these dendrites too. These mice also have fewer AMPAR proteins at their synapses than control mice."

The retromer complex functions in endosomal protein sorting and trafficking. It is composed of the VPS26-VPS29-VPS35 core complex and a SNX subunit or subcomplex (<a href=\"#bib22\">Gallon and Cullen, 2015</a>). In mammalian epithelial cells, SNX6 serves as dynein adaptor in retromer-mediated vesicular transport to regulate both cargo recognition and release via its interaction with the motor and the target membrane. SNX6 contains an amino-terminal Phox Homology (PX) domain that is evolutionarily conserved among SNXs and a carboxyl-terminal Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs (BAR) domain that allows for dimerization with BAR domains of other proteins. It dimerizes with the SNX1 subunit of retromer through its BAR domain and binds to dynactin p150<sup>Glued</sup> through its PX domain, linking the dynein\u2212dynactin motor complex to retromer-associated vesicular cargoes (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hong et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Wassmer et al., 2009</a>). Its PX domain also interacts with the TGN-enriched phospholipid PtdIns(4)P, which inhibits the interaction between SNX6 and p150<sup>Glued</sup> to facilitate dissociation of the retrograde motor from the retromer-associated cargo at the TGN (<a href=\"#bib55\">Niu et al., 2013</a>). Although retromer is involved in endosomal sorting and trafficking of amyloid precursor protein (APP) (<a href=\"#bib19\">Fjorback et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Sullivan et al., 2011</a>), and transport, surface expression and endocytic recycling of AMPAR (<a href=\"#bib11\">Choy et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Munsie et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib84\">Zhang et al., 2012</a>) in neurons, the biological function of SNX6 in the CNS, whether retromer-dependent or not, remains to be explored."

They are highly specialized postsynaptic structures containing transmembrane neurotransmitter receptors and proteins with signaling and scaffolding functions. Among them, scaffold proteins of the postsynaptic density (PSD) play crucial roles in glutamatergic neurotransmission by organizing glutamate receptors and signaling molecules at the postsynaptic terminal. One group of PSD scaffold proteins is the PSD95 membrane-associated guanylyl kinase (MAGUK) family proteins that anchor glutamate receptors to the PSD (<a href=\"#bib16\">Elias and Nicoll, 2007</a>). Another group is the Homer and Shank family proteins. They interact with each other and form a high-order complex with a mesh-like network structure, which is believed to serve as a\u00a0structural platform of the PSD essential for the structural integrity of dendritic spines (<a href=\"#bib26\">Hayashi et al., 2009</a>). The Homer family proteins also regulate trafficking and signaling of the group one metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR1/5) and synaptic plasticity (<a href=\"#bib3\">Ango et al., 2001</a>, <a href=\"#bib4\">2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Gerstein et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Mao et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Roche et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Ronesi and Huber, 2008</a>). Moreover, Homer1b and 1c, the long isoforms encoded by the Homer1 gene that are differentiated by an insertion of 12 amino acid (aa) residues at aa 177 in Homer1c (<a href=\"#bib82\">Xiao et al., 1998</a>), regulate surface expression of \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPAR) at synaptic sites through endocytic recycling (<a href=\"#bib45\">Lu et al., 2007</a>). Although mechanisms underlying glutamate receptor trafficking to dendrites as well as their local trafficking into and out of synaptic sites have been intensively studied (<a href=\"#bib2\">Anggono and Huganir, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Hoerndli et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Horak et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Huganir and Nicoll, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Lad\u00e9p\u00eache et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Setou et al., 2000</a>, <a href=\"#bib65\">2002</a>), the molecular basis for dendritic distribution and spine localization of most PSD scaffolding proteins including Homer remains largely unexplored."

Ablation of SNX6 in the CNS causes deficits in spatial learning and memory, decrease in spine density of the distal dendrites of hippocampal CA1 neurons and impairment of their AMPAR-mediated synaptic transmission, suggesting a role for SNX6 in synaptic structure and function. SNX6 interacts with Homer1b/c and loss of SNX6 leads to a\u00a0reduction in its distribution in distal dendrites. Intriguingly, although SNX6 is required for the motility of a subpopulation of Homer1c on vesicles in dendritic shaft, live imaging and FRAP analyses indicate that Homer1c enters dendritic spines via protein diffusion but not SNX6-dependent active transport. Overexpression of SNX6 or Homer1c restores the spine density and AMPAR surface levels of <i>Snx6</i><sup>-/-</sup> neurons. These findings uncover a physiological function for SNX6 in hippocampal CA1 excitatory neurons."

We focused on the morphology of CA1 and CA3 pyramidal cells for two reasons: first, neurons in the CA1 and CA3 region were sparsely labeled by EGFP and hence easily distinguishable from neighboring ones for the purpose of morphological assessment; second, changes in the morphology and density of dendritic spines have been linked to synaptic function and plasticity. For quantification of spine number and morphology, we imaged segments of dendrites that are easily distinguishable from those of neighboring neurons, i.e., the oriens/distal branches of the basal and radiatum/thin branches of the apical dendrites of CA1 neurons, and secondary/tertiary branches of the basal and apical dendrites of CA3 neurons in stratum oriens and stratum radiatum, respectively (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Quantitative analysis showed that, although spine morphology did not change in either CA1 or CA3 pyramidal cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C\u2013F</a>), there was a decrease in the spine density of the distal portion of apical dendrites of <i>Snx6</i><sup>-/-</sup> CA1 neurons (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,D</a>). In contrast, no change in spine density was detected in <i>Snx6</i><sup>-/-</sup> CA3 neurons (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E,F</a>). Consistently, ultrastructural analysis revealed a decrease in the number of asymmetric/excitatory synapses in the CA1, but not in the CA3 region of <i>Nestin-Cre; Snx6<sup>fl/fl</sup></i> mouse brain (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G,H</a>).

As the first step to investigate its molecular function, we determined the subcellular distribution of SNX6 in dendrites by co-immunostaining of SNX6 and vesicular markers in cultured mature hippocampal neurons. Confocal microscopy revealed that the majority of SNX6 signals colocalized with EEA1 and Rab5B, the early endosome markers (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>). SNX6 also partially colocalized with the late endosome marker Rab7 and Rab4, marker for the fast recycling pathway, though to a lesser extent, but not Rab11 recycling endosomes (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>). Intriguingly, although SNX6 signals did not colocalize with Golgin97, a TGN resident protein, they overlapped partially with TGN46 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>), a protein involved in membrane traffic to and from the TGN (<a href=\"#bib59\">Ponnambalam et al., 1996</a>), suggesting that SNX6 associates with endosomes and transport carriers in the\u00a0dendrite."

We performed pull down experiment from mouse brain lysates using a His-tagged SNX6 N-terminus (aa 1\u2013181, encompassing the PX domain) immobilized on Ni-NTA agarose. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed six matching peptides with 24% sequence coverage corresponding to Homer1b/c, a postsynaptic scaffold protein (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Immunoblotting analysis verified that Homer1b/c, not Homer1a, the shorter isoform encoded by the <i>Homer1</i> gene, was pulled down by the N-terminus of SNX6 but not SNX1 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D,E</a>). Moreover, in vitro binding assays showed that SNX6-N interacted directly with the coiled-coil domain of Homer1b/c (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>), which is not present in Homer1a. In contrast, neither Homer2b nor Homer3, the longer isoforms of other Homer family members, interacted with SNX6-N (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>). Further, mEmerald-Homer1c co-immunoprecipitated with Flag-tagged SNX6 in transiently transfected HEK293T cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H</a>). Consistently, reciprocal co-immunoprecipitations of endogenous proteins from mouse brain lysates verified that SNX6 and Homer1b/c interact with each other (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4I</a>, left and center panels). Moreover, immunoisolation of SNX6-positive vesicles from membrane fractions of mouse brain lysates detected Homer1b/c together with p150<sup>Glued</sup> and dynein intermediate chain (DIC), subunits of the dynein\u2212dynactin complex (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4I</a>, right panel). In contrast, neither Homer1a nor subunits of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) were detected on SNX6-positive vesicles (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4I</a>, right panel). In dendrites, Homer1b/c not only colocalized with SNX6 on vesicular structures (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4J,K</a>), but also colocalized with EEA1 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4L,M</a>). Both wide-field microscopy with deconvolution and superresolution fluorescence microscopy revealed colocalization of EEA1, Homer1b/c and SNX6 in dendrites (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4N</a>, <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>), indicating that SNX6 associates with Homer1b/c on endosomes."

To determine whether SNX6 regulates Homer1b/c distribution in dendrites, we examined Homer1b/c expression and subcellular distribution in <i>Snx6</i><sup>-/-</sup> hippocampal neurons by immunofluorescence staining. Indeed, although no change in the protein levels of Homer1b/c was detected in the hippocampi of <i>Nestin-Cre; Snx6<sup>fl/fl</sup></i> mice (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), quantitative analysis revealed not only a decrease in the number of Homer1b/c puncta in dendritic segments (30\u2013120\u00a0\u03bcm from the cell body) of <i>Snx6</i><sup>-/-</sup> neurons as compared with that of <i>Snx6</i><sup>+/+</sup>, but also a significant reduction in the fluorescence intensity of Homer1b/c puncta in spines (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>). Overexpression of EGFP-SNX6 rescued both puncta number and spine distribution of Homer1b/c in <i>Snx6<sup>-/-</sup></i> neurons (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>). In contrast, neither the number nor the fluorescence intensity of PSD95 puncta was significantly affected in <i>Snx6<sup>-/-</sup></i> neurons (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,D</a>). Further, quantification of the Homer1b/c signal intensity over distance from the cell body revealed a decrease in both shaft and spines of the\u00a0distal dendrites and concurrent accumulation in the soma of <i>Snx6<sup>-/-</sup></i> neurons, which was rescued by mCherry-SNX6 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E,F</a>).

To this end, we transfected hippocampal neurons with constructs expressing mEmerald-Homer1c and mCherry-SNX6 (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) and performed live-cell imaging by total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIR-FM) to monitor their movement in dendrites. Indeed, we observed movement of SNX6-, Homer1c-double positive puncta in the shaft of both proximal and distal dendrites (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A\u2013C</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2A,B</a>, <a href=\"#media2\">Videos 2</a> and <a href=\"#media3\">3</a>). A retrospective staining of MAP2 right after live imaging verified dendrite identity of the distal branch (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Quantitative analysis revealed that, similar to mobility characteristics of PSD95 clusters in dendrites (<a href=\"#bib23\">Gerrow et al., 2006</a>), the majority (~90%) of Homer1c puncta (1022 out of 1128 puncta from 31 neurons) were stationary. Of note, the majority of motile SNX6-, Homer1c-positive puncta were smaller than 0.3\u00a0\u03bcm<sup>2</sup> in size (&lt;600\u00a0nm in apparent diameter), whereas most of the immotile ones were larger (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>), suggesting that the moving structures were vesicles rather than large protein aggregates. The SNX6-, Homer1c-positive puncta moved bidirectionally in the dendritic shaft, with the mean velocity of 0.416\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.037\u00a0\u03bcm/s, over distances ranging from 2.026\u00a0to\u00a018.324\u00a0\u03bcm (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2D\u2013F</a>). Movement of SNX6-, Homer1b-double positive puncta in the dendritic shaft was also observed by live imaging (<a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a>). In contrast, in neurons overexpressing EGFP fusion of the GluN1 subunit of NMDAR, no comovement of SNX6- and GluN1-positive vesicles in dendrite was observed (<a href=\"#media5\">Video 5</a>). Moreover, we performed live imaging of mEmerald-Homer1c in <i>Snx6</i><sup>-/-</sup> neurons and found that compared with wild-type, there was a dramatic decrease in the fraction of motile Homer1c fluorescent puncta (29 motile puncta out of 311 from 10 <i>Snx6</i><sup>+/+</sup> neurons vs. 10 out of 1217 from 40 <i>Snx6</i><sup>-/-</sup> neurons)."

First, we imaged neurons coexpressing EEA1-YFP and mCherry-SNX6 and observed movement of EEA1-, SNX6-double positive vesicles in the dendritic shaft (<a href=\"#media6\">Video 6</a>). In neurons coexpressing EEA1-YFP and mCherry-Homer1c, more than 90% of EEA1 vesicles also contained Homer1c (461/482\u00a0=\u00a095.6%from 20 <i>Snx6</i><sup>+/+</sup> and 796/872\u00a0=\u00a091.3 % from 26 <i>Snx6</i><sup>-/-</sup> neurons), whereas the majority of Homer1c puncta were also EEA1-positive (461/690\u00a0=\u00a066.8 % from 20 <i>Snx6</i><sup>+/+</sup> and 796/1249\u00a0=\u00a063.7% from 26 <i>Snx6</i><sup>-/-</sup> neurons). Live imaging detected not only movement of EEA1-, Homer1c-double positive vesicles in the dendritic shaft (<a href=\"#media7\">Video 7</a>), but also a significant decrease in the fraction of motile EEA1-positive vesicles in <i>Snx6</i><sup>-/-</sup> neurons (total EEA1-positive vesicles: 58/482 motile\u00a0=\u00a012% from 20 <i>Snx6</i><sup>+/+</sup> neurons vs. 37/872 motile\u00a0=\u00a04.2% from 26 <i>Snx6</i><sup>-/-</sup> neurons; EEA1-, Homer1c-double positive vesicles: 53/461 motile\u00a0=\u00a011.5% from 20 <i>Snx6</i><sup>+/+</sup> neurons vs. 25/796 motile\u00a0=\u00a03.1% from 26 <i>Snx6</i><sup>-/-</sup> neurons). In contrast, in dendrites of neurons coexpressing Homer1c and the late endosome marker Rab7, neither comovement of Rab7- and Homer1c-positive structures was observed (<a href=\"#media8\">Videos 8</a> and <a href=\"#media9\">9</a>), nor the fraction of motile Rab7-labeled structures changed significantly when SNX6 was ablated (331/601 motile\u00a0=\u00a055.1% from 27 <i>Snx6</i><sup>+/+</sup> neurons vs. 341/647 motile\u00a0=\u00a052.7% from 22 <i>Snx6</i><sup>-/-</sup> neurons). Together, these data indicate that SNX6 is required for the motility of EEA1-positive early endosomes or early endosome-derived vesicles carrying Homer1b/c."

To determine whether association of Homer1b/c and the motor complex on vesicles requires SNX6, we attempted immunoisolation of Homer1b/c and dynein\u2212dynactin-associated vesicles from mouse brain. Although antibodies to Homer1b/c failed to isolate Homer1b/c-positive vesicles from membrane fractions of mouse brain lysates, western blotting of vesicles immunoisolated with antibodies to both p150<sup>Glued</sup> and DIC detected Homer1b/c signals in wild-type but not CNS-SNX6 KO mice (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6K</a>). Moreover, we performed immunostaining and colocalization analysis of Homer1b/c on <i>Snx6</i><sup>+/+</sup> and <i>Snx6</i><sup>-/-</sup> neurons. Quantitative analysis of confocal images showed that there was a decrease in colocalization of Homer1b/c with p150<sup>Glued</sup> and DIC, but not with EEA1, in <i>Snx6</i><sup>-/-</sup> neurons (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6L,M</a>).

Moreover, ablation of SNX6 did not cause complete loss of Homer1/c from distal dendrites, suggesting that SNX6-independent mechanism(s) is required for Homer1b/c distribution in dendritic regions far from the cell body.

First, we determined whether or not shaft-localized Homer1b/c puncta enter spines. In our live imaging experiments using mEmerald-Homer1c, we did not detect entry of Homer1c puncta into spines in either wild-type or <i>Snx6</i> KO neurons. We also imaged dendritic segments of neurons expressing mCherry-Homer1c (<i>Snx6</i><sup>+/+</sup>: 30\u00a0cells, 50 dendritic segments, 791 spines; <i>Snx6<sup>-/-</sup></i>: 30\u00a0cells, 50 dendritic segments, 547 spines). Under the experimental condition we used, most motile fluorescent puncta moved in shaft (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a> and <a href=\"#media13\">Video 13</a>), only one event of Homer1c particle entry into spine was observed (<a href=\"#media14\">Video 14</a>). Since the plus ends of microtubules transiently invade dendritic spines (<a href=\"#bib36\">Jaworski et al., 2009</a>) and dynein is a minus end-directed motor, it is conceivable that dynein-driven transport is not involved in transfer of Homer1b/c from shaft to spines. Moreover, we reasoned that if delivery of Homer1b/c from shaft to spines requires SNX6, there would be a decrease in spine distribution of Homer1b/c signals in dendrites of <i>Snx6</i> KO neurons. Quantitative analysis showed that, although both total and spine Homer1b/c signals decreased in distal dendrites (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>), its spine:shaft ratio remained constant throughout the dendrite and did not change in <i>Snx6</i><sup>-/-</sup> neurons (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>), indicating that in steady-state neurons, SNX6 is not involved in local trafficking of Homer1b/c from shaft to spines."

Consistent with previous findings on Homer1c turnover rates measured by FRAP using EGFP-Homer1c (<a href=\"#bib40\">Kuriu et al., 2006</a>), following full synapse photobleaching of fluorescent signals, 7\u00a0~\u00a09 % of recovery after 10\u00a0s was observed in both wild-type and <i>Snx6</i> KO neurons (8.09 \u00b1\u00a00.91% in <i>Snx6</i><sup>+/+</sup> and 8.14 \u00b1\u00a00.73% in <i>Snx6</i><sup>-/-</sup> neurons, <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C,D</a>), indicating that although the fraction of fast fluorescence recovery in spines attributable to entry of soluble cytosolic proteins (<a href=\"#bib7\">Blanpied et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Kerr and Blanpied, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Kuriu et al., 2006</a>) is minor, diffusion of Homer1c protein molecules into spines does not require SNX6. After 10\u00a0min, about half of Homer1c fluorescence was recovered in both wild-type and <i>Snx6</i> KO neurons with similar recovery half-time (Recovery level R<sub>final</sub>\u00a0=\u00a054.55 \u00b1\u00a04.03%, \u03c4<sub>1/2</sub> =\u00a0108.4 \u00b1 9.4 s in <i>Snx6</i><sup>+/+</sup> and R<sub>final</sub>\u00a0=\u00a052.63 \u00b1\u00a03.53%, \u03c4<sub>1/2</sub> =\u00a0107.2 \u00b1 13.1 s in <i>Snx6</i><sup>-/-</sup>, <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C,D</a>). Further, similar results were obtained by fitting a single-exponential recovery curve to the average recovery time trace (\u03c4<sub>1/2</sub> = 117.6 \u00b1 11.3 s, R<sub>final</sub>\u00a0=\u00a051.63 \u00b1\u00a00.86% in <i>Snx6</i><sup>+/+</sup> and \u03c4<sub>1/2</sub> = 108.9 \u00b1 9.1 s, R<sub>final</sub>\u00a0=\u00a048.57 \u00b1\u00a00.73% in <i>Snx6</i><sup>-/-</sup>). These results are in good agreement with previous findings that there are immobile and mobile fractions of Homer1c in spines (<a href=\"#bib40\">Kuriu et al., 2006</a>) and indicate that the dynamic turnover of Homer1c in spines is not affected by ablation of SNX6. Taken together, these data indicate that in steady-state neurons, neither SNX6 nor vesicular transport is required for recruitment of Homer1b/c from shaft to spines, and that synaptic Homer1b/c exchanges with the soluble protein pool that enters the spine by diffusion."

We eliminated the <i>Snx6</i> gene in a small subset of hippocampal neurons by injection of organotypic hippocampal slice culture from <i>Snx6<sup>fl/fl</sup></i> mouse with recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV) coexpressing EGFP and the Cre recombinase (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a> and <a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). By simultaneous recording the evoked EPSCs (eEPSCs) on infected and adjacent uninfected CA1 pyramidal neurons, we found that AMPAR-mediated eEPSCs were significantly impaired by about 50% with ablation of SNX6 (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>), whereas NMDAR-mediated eEPSCs and the pair-pulse ratio of AMPAR eEPSCs were unaffected (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C,D</a>), indicating that the impairment of AMPAR eEPSCs is due to decrease in the number of AMPARs in the postsynaptic membrane but not reduction of presynaptic glutamate release. Indeed, no change in surface expression of the GluN2B subunit of NMDAR was detected in <i>Snx6<sup>-/-</sup></i> neurons by immunostaining and quantitative analysis (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9E,F</a>). In contrast, there was a decrease in the surface expression of GluA1 and GluA2, components of AMPAR, which was fully rescued by overexpressing SNX6 or Homer1c (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9G\u2013J</a>)."

Indeed, there was an increase in surface levels of mGluR5 in <i>Snx6</i><sup>-/-</sup> neurons (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9K</a>, <a href=\"#fig9s2\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplements 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig9s3\">3</a>), which was restored by overexpression of SNX6 or Homer1c but not Homer1c-C (<a href=\"#fig9s2\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Moreover, ratiometric analysis of internalized and surface AMPAR detected an increase in the rate of AMPAR endocytosis in <i>Snx6</i><sup>-/-</sup> neurons ( <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9L,M</a> ). To test the possibility that loss of Homer1b/c leads to decrease in surface AMPAR via increased surface levels and/or constitutive activation of mGluRs, we treated neurons with inverse agonists for mGluR1/5 and determined surface levels of GluA1 and GluA2 by immunostaining. Quantitative analysis indicated that inhibition of mGluRs did rescue surface expression of AMPAR in <i>Snx6</i><sup>-/-</sup> neurons (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9N\u2013Q</a>). Together, these data indicate that dendritic loss of Homer1b/c caused by ablation of SNX6 leads to increase in mGluR surface expression and mGluR-regulated AMPAR endocytic trafficking."

In the dendritic spine, an EZ adjacent to the PSD captures and retrieves AMPAR diffusing out of the synapse through local endocytic trafficking (<a href=\"#bib8\">Blanpied et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Lu et al., 2007</a>), which is crucial for the supply of a mobile pool of receptor molecules required for synaptic transmission and potentiation (<a href=\"#bib45\">Lu et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Petrini et al., 2009</a>). To determine whether ablation of SNX6 caused uncoupling of the EZ from the PSD, we performed co-immunostaining of PSD95 and clathrin heavy chain, a marker for the EZ. Indeed, ablation of SNX6 caused\u00a0~2\u00a0fold increase in the fraction of EZ (clathrin)-negative synapses (<a href=\"#fig9s4\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 4</a>), indicating that the\u00a0coupling of the EZ to the PSD is impaired in <i>Snx6</i><sup>-/-</sup> neurons, which might also contribute to lower surface levels of AMPAR in dendritic spines."

                                "text": "Previous studies have established a role for SNX6 as cargo adaptor in retromer-mediated vesicular transport (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hong et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Wassmer et al., 2009</a>). To test whether retromer is involved in SNX6-regulated dendritic distribution of Homer1b/c, we depleted VPS35, a core component of the retromer complex, by siRNA-mediated RNA interference in hippocampal neurons (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10A,B</a>\u00a0and <a href=\"#fig10s1\">Figure 10\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Immunofluorescence staining and quantitative analysis of confocal images indicated that depletion of VPS35 in mature neurons caused a decrease not only in surface GluA1 but also in the number of Homer1b/c puncta in dendrites (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10C\u2013E</a>), possibly resulted from reduced spine density as VPS35 has been found to promote spine formation and maturation (<a href=\"#bib76\">Tian et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Wang et al., 2012</a>). Nevertheless, compared with the phenotypes of <i>Snx6</i><sup>-/-</sup> neurons, there was decrease in Homer1b/c signals throughout the cell body and dendrites, but no change in spine distribution of Homer1b/c or surface levels of mGluR5 when VPS35 was depleted (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10C and E\u2013H</a>), indicating that it serves distinct function(s) from SNX6 in dendritic distribution of postsynaptic proteins. Moreover, live imaging of hippocampal neurons coexpressing mEmerald-Homer1c and VPS35-mCherry did not detect comovement of Homer1c- and VPS35-labeled vesicles in dendrite (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10I,J</a> and <a href=\"#media15\">Videos 15</a> and <a href=\"#media16\">16</a>). Further, retrospective staining of MAP2 and VPS35 right after live imaging confirmed the dendrite identity and absence of endogenous VPS35 at the base of the spine where a Homer1c-positive structure stopped (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10J</a>, rightmost panels). To further confirm that SNX6 does not cooperate with the retromer to regulate motility of Homer1b/c vesicles, we performed coimmunostaining of Homer1b/c and VPS35 on <i>Snx6</i><sup>+/+</sup> and <i>Snx6</i><sup>-/-</sup> neurons. Quantitative analysis showed that colocalization between Homer1b/c and VPS35 was very little compared with that between Homer1b/c and SNX6 or EEA1. Moreover, it was not affected by ablation of SNX6 (<a href=\"#fig10s2\">Figure 10\u2014figure supplement 2A,B</a>). Conversely, no change in colocalization between Homer1b/c and SNX6 was detected in VPS35-depleted neurons either (<a href=\"#fig10s2\">Figure 10\u2014figure supplement 2C,D</a>). Taken together, these data indicate that SNX6 functions independent of retromer to regulate dendritic distribution of Homer1b/c."

We also show that SNX6 directly interacts with Homer1b/c, a PSD scaffolding protein crucial for the structural and functional integrity of dendritic spines, and that there is decrease in Homer1b/c distribution in distal dendrites in <i>Snx6</i><sup>-/-</sup> neurons.

Although Homer1b/c is widely expressed in the brain, in the hippocampus it is predominantly distributed to the CA1 region (<a href=\"#bib67\">Shiraishi et al., 2004</a>), which partially explains why ablation of SNX6 function causes a decrease in spine density of CA1 distal apical dendrites and impairs hippocampal-dependent spatial learning and memory that mainly involves the Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses. Whether there are other SNX6-interacting proteins that are also required for CA1 neuron function awaits further investigation. As spatial learning and memory involve not only the hippocampus but also other cortical areas such as the entorhinal cortex and the medial prefrontal cortex (<a href=\"#bib37\">Jo et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Nagahara et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Nakazawa et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Steffenach et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib86\">Zhou et al., 1998</a>), it also remains to be determined whether and how ablation of SNX6 affects the synaptic structure and function of neurons in other parts of the cortex."

                        "text": "PSD scaffolding proteins interact, anchor and stabilize glutamate receptors. Change in their protein content in dendritic shaft and spines influences synaptic transmission through receptor localization and distribution at synaptic sites. Among the PSD scaffolding proteins, PSD95 has been intensively studied. Dendritic trafficking and synaptic targeting of PSD95 requires a C-terminal tyrosine-based signal, palmitoylation of the N-terminus and its interaction with both Myosin V and dynein through binding of GKAP to these molecular motors (<a href=\"#bib13\">Craven and Bredt, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">El-Husseini et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Hruska et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Naisbitt et al., 2000</a>). Synaptic localization of Shank also requires GKAP (<a href=\"#bib52\">Naisbitt et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Sala et al., 2001</a>), whilst recruitment of Homer1b to dendritic spines requires synaptically targeted Shank (<a href=\"#bib63\">Sala et al., 2001</a>). We found that the motility of Homer1c-associated vesicles in dendritic shaft requires SNX6, and that ablation of SNX6 or inhibition of dynein-dynactin activity causes reduction in the amount of Homer1b/c in distal dendrites. Previously imaging assays and quantitative modeling have established that dynein-driven bidirectional transport contributes to the\u00a0polarized targeting of dendrite-specific cargo (<a href=\"#bib38\">Kapitein et al., 2010</a>). Therefore, lack of dynein\u2012dynactin-driven transport in the dendritic shaft provides a possible mechanism for the Homer1b/c distribution phenotype in <i>Snx6</i><sup>-/-</sup> neurons. However, since the majority of Homer1c puncta are immobile in dendrites of steady-state neurons, and little is known about the cellular functions of SNX6 apart from its role as dynein cargo adaptor, it is also possible that SNX6 regulates the distribution of Homer1b/c in dendrites via mechanism(s) distinct from dynein\u2012dynactin-driven transport. Moreover, ablation of SNX6 does not cause complete loss of Homer1b/c from distal dendrites, indicating that mechanism(s) other than SNX6-mediated transport contributes to its localization to dendritic shaft far from the cell body. Since disruption of the secretory pathway does not affect Homer1b/c localization to dendritic shaft and spines, alternative mechanisms for its distribution in dendrites include diffusion of free protein molecules, cotransport with protein(s) other than the PSD95-GKAP-Shank complex or vesicular transport mediated by different motor(s) and/or adaptor(s)."

In dendrites, several mechanisms exist for the\u00a0transfer of postsynaptic components from shaft to synaptic sites in spines, including cytosolic diffusion, exocytosis of transmembrane proteins at the plasma membrane and their lateral diffusion to synaptic sites, and active transport by molecular motors. The AMPARs enter dendritic spines via both lateral diffusion and actin-based, Myosin V-driven transport of recycling endosomes (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adesnik et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Correia et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Makino and Malinow, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Wang et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Yudowski et al., 2007</a>). Since Homer1b/c is a scaffolding protein, its entry into spines might rely on diffusion of free molecules, possibly released from endosomal carriers or from the cytosolic pool in the shaft, or transport of the vesicular cargo directly from the shaft by a different motor. Our results from live imaging, FRAP and quantitative analyses show that direct spine entry of Homer1c puncta is an extremely rare event, and that the dynamic turnover of Homer1c in spines is not affected by ablation of SNX6. Collectively, these data indicate that in steady-state neurons, Homer1b/c enters spines by cytosolic diffusion, and SNX6 is not required for its spine localization."

Our study not only shows that SNX6 directly interacts with Homer1b/c, but also provides evidence that SNX6-regulated distribution of Homer1b/c in dendritic shaft is retromer-independent. The CSC is involved in retrieval of APP from endosomes to the TGN and plasma membrane delivery and endocytic recycling of the AMPAR in dendritic spines (<a href=\"#bib11\">Choy et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Fjorback et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Munsie et al., 2015</a>). SNX27, another member of the SNX family and a component of retromer (<a href=\"#bib75\">Temkin et al., 2011</a>), interacts with both NMDAR and AMPAR and regulates their recycling to the cell surface (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cai et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Hussain et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Loo et al., 2014</a>). It remains to be determined whether or not SNX6 functions in retromer-mediated dendritic transport. Notably, SNX6 shares the highest sequence similarity (85%) with SNX32, another SNX with unknown function. The mild neurodevelopmental phenotype exhibited by <i>Nestin-Cre; Snx6<sup>fl/fl</sup></i> mice suggests functional redundancy among the SNX family members. Further studies are needed to characterize the\u00a0roles of evolutionarily conserved SNXs, including SNX6 and SNX32, in sorting and trafficking of neuronal proteins and their functions in synaptic development and activity."

The PSD-95-pTagRFP was a generous gift from Johannes Hell (Addgene plasmid # 52671). The FUmGW construct expressing membrane bound GFP (mGFP) was a generous gift from Connie Cepko (Addgene plasmid # 22479). The mCherry-Homer1C construct was generated by cloning full-length Homer1c amplified from mEmerald-Homer1c into pmCherry-C2\u00a0(Clontech Laboratories, Inc., Mountain View, CA). The mEmerald-Homer1b construct was derived from mEmerald-Homer1c by deletion of its aa 177\u2013188. EGFP-Homer1C-N/C constructs were generated by cloning Homer1c N-terminus (aa1-187)/C-terminus (aa188-366) amplified from mEmerald-Homer1c into pEGFP-C2\u00a0(Clontech Laboratories, Inc.). His-sumo fusion of full-length Homer1c, Homer1c-N (aa1-111), Homer1c-M1 (aa111-177), Homer1c-M2 (aa111-187) and Homer1c-C (aa188-366) were generated by cloning fragments amplified from mEmerald-Homer1C into pET28a-sumo. His-sumo-Homer2b (NCBI Accession: AF093260.1) and Homer3 (NCBI Accession: NM_001146153.1) constructs were generated by PCR amplification of full-length Homer2b and Homer3 from mouse brain cDNA and cloning into pET28a-sumo. The GluN1-EGFP (NR1-EGFP) construct was a generous gift from A. Kimberley McAllister (Department of Neurology, University of California at Davis, USA). The EEA1-YFP construct was a generous gift from Li Yu (Tsinghua University, China). The Rab7-RFP construct was a generous gift from Hong Tang (Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China). The pEGFP-PKD-K618N construct was a generous gift from Vivek Malhotra (Center for Genomic Regulation, Spain). pEGFP-N3-p150<sup>Glued</sup>-N (aa 1\u20131060) and constructs expressing full-length SNX1, SNX2, SNX5, and SNX6 fused with EGFP, mCherry or FLAG tag were described previously (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hong et al., 2009</a>). To obtain expression constructs for His-SNX1-N, His-SNX6-N, GST-SNX1-N and GST-SNX6-N, N termini of SNX1 (aa 1\u2013271) and SNX6 (aa 1\u2013181) were PCR-amplified from the full-length constructs and subcloned into pET28a and pGEX-4T-1, respectively. To avoid disrupting the subunit interactions of VPS35-VPS29-VPS26\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib50\">Munsie et al., 2015</a>), VPS35-6G-EGFP was constructed by PCR amplifying human VPS35 coding sequence from HeLa cDNA with a pair of primers in which nucleotides encoding six glycines were added to the reverse primer and inserting into pCMV-EGFPN3.To construct VPS35-6G-mCherry, EGFP sequence of VPS35-6G-EGFP was replaced by mCherry coding sequence from pCMV-mCherryC1. Viral particles of adeno-associated virus (AAV) carrying pAOV-CaMKII\u03b1-EGFP-2A-Cre and the control construct pAOV-CaMKII\u03b1-EGFP-2A-3FLAG were purchased from Obio Technology (Shanghai) Corp.

                                "text": "The Morris water maze procedure consists of hidden platform acquisition training, probe trial testing and recall training. The water tank is a 120\u00a0cm diameter circular pool with a circular goal platform submerged 0.5\u00a0cm below the water surface. Water temperature was about 22\u00b0C\u00a0to\u00a024\u00b0C. Cues with different shapes and colors were pasted on the wall of the tank above the\u00a0water surface in four different directions. A circular black curtain around the tank eliminated competing environmental cues. The mouse trajectory in the pool was monitored and analyzed by an automated system (Smart 3.0, Panlab SMART video tracking system,\u00a0Barcelona, Spain). The day before the\u00a0experiment, the\u00a0mouse was gently placed into the\u00a0pool without a\u00a0platform to freely swim for 90\u00a0s for pre-adaptation. Acquisition training was then performed for eight days and four trials per day with different water-entering the\u00a0site (at north, south, east, and west positions adjacent to the pool wall). During each trial, mouse must learn to use cues to navigate a path to the hidden platform within 90\u00a0s. If failed to find the platform, mouse will be led to the platform with a stick, and kept on it for 10\u00a0s. The escape latency (the average value of the\u00a0time duration from entering the\u00a0water to finding the platform of four trials per day) was calculated for each mouse. After acquisition training, the hidden platform was removed and probe testing was performed for five days and one trial each day at the distal water-entering site away from the platform. A 1.5x platform circle area where the platform was placed was monitored. The latency to first enter 1.5x area (time duration from entering the\u00a0water to first enter the 1.5x area) and numbers of crossing 1.5x platform circle area of each mouse within 90 s were analyzed. For recall training, after a 20 day-rest, mouse was placed in the same pool without a\u00a0platform to examine memory extinguishment. Similarly, the latency to first enter 1.5x area and numbers of crossing 1.5x area of each mouse within 90\u00a0s were analyzed. Afterward, the platform was placed back to the\u00a0pool and recall training was performed for one day with four trials with different water-entering sites. The second day, the platform was removed again, and the\u00a0mouse was placed in the\u00a0pool at the farthest water-entering site away from the platform. The latency to first enter 1.5x area and numbers of crossing 1.5x area of each mouse was analyzed."

Two-dimensional, background-subtracted, maximum projection reconstructions of Z-stack images were used for morphologic analysis and quantification. To examine the size, number, and fluorescence intensity of signal puncta in shaft and spines, the EGFP- or DsRed-labeled dendrites or spines were outlined manually. Numbers of puncta were measured manually and the size of Homer1 puncta as well as the\u00a0mean intensity of fluorescent signals in individual spines was measured using the ImageJ function \u2018Analyze\u00a0&gt;\u00a0measure\u2019. Quantification of spine:shaft ratios of Homer1b/c was conducted as described (<a href=\"#bib69\">Smith et al., 2014</a>).

All image analyses were conducted blind to the genotype. For quantitative analysis of VPS35 knockdown in neurons, the fluorescence intensity or VPS35 puncta from EGFP-expressing neurons in each group was normalized by that of untransfected neurons in the same group. The normalized values in each VPS35 siRNA group were further presented as relative values to the scrambled siRNA group."

For quantitative analysis of 3D-SIM images with three colors/triple channels, first raw images were committed to costes auto-threshold subtraction for unbiased background subtraction as previously described (<a href=\"#bib14\">Dunn et al., 2011</a>). Then Biobprob ImageJ plugin was used to measure the colocalilzation of triple channels (<a href=\"#bib20\">Fletcher et al., 2010</a>). The statistical significance of triple colocalization was determined by comparing the values of voxel colocalization of the original images with those of images generated by randomizing spatial locations of signals in the original ones (i.e., colocalization occurred by chance), which was illustrated with <i>p</i> values produced by Biobprob ImageJ plugin (parameters: voxel size: 40, 40, 125\u00a0nm; confidence interval: 95; p&lt;0.05 means significantly more colocalization than chance)."

Briefly, hippocampal neurons were transfected with constructs expressing mEmerald-Homer1c and pLL3.7.1-DsRed as spine volume marker on DIV13 and FRAP was performed on DIV15\u00a0~ 16. Photobleaching of entire spines with synaptic Homer1c signals was achieved using 50\u00a0~\u00a060% 488\u00a0nm laser power, while the following acquisition immediately after bleaching was achieved using 5\u00a0~\u00a06% 488\u00a0nm laser power. To analyze the recovery of fluorescence, raw images were background subtracted frame-by-frame. The bleached spine and an additional \u2018control\u2019 spine were targeted as ROI. The\u00a0recovery rate was calculated as R = (I(t)-I(0))/(I(before bleaching)-I(0)), with I(0) being the intensity immediately after bleaching. After normalization using the \u2018control\u2019 spine, recovery trace of each bleached spine over time was drawn. The fluorescence recovery at the end of recording time was determined as the R<sub>final</sub>. After averaging the intensity of five time points, the first time point at which the intensity recovered to the half of R<sub>final</sub> was determined as the half-time. By averaging all individual recovery traces and fitting a single exponential recovery curve using \u2018Graphpad Prism 5&gt;analysis&gt;fit&gt;exponential&gt;one-phase association&gt;least squares fit\u2019, the value of R<sub>final</sub> and half-time obtained through the exponential fitting curve are similar to the average values obtained from each individual recovery trace."

GFP-positive neurons were identified by epifluorescence microscopy. All paired recordings involved simultaneous whole-cell recordings from one GFP-positive neuron and a neighboring GFP-negative neuron. The stimulus was adjusted to evoke a measurable, monosynaptic eEPSC in both cells. AMPAR eEPSCs were measured at a holding potential of \u221270\u00a0mV, and NMDAR eEPSCs were measured at\u00a0+40\u00a0mV 150\u00a0ms after the stimulus, at which point the AMPAR eEPSC has completely decayed. All paired recording data were analyzed statistically with a Wilcoxon Sign Rank Test for paired data. A\u00a0p value of\u00a0&lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant.

However, this comparison is not fair, because a SNX6 knockout and VPS35 knockdown are used, and the data are thus not directly comparable. The observation that VPS35 and Homer1b/c do not colocalize may be due to the fact that the two proteins do not bind directly but only through SNX6, which becomes limiting when both VPS35 and Homer1b/c are overexpressed. Is colocolalization of VPS35 and Homer1b/c observed when SNX6 is overexpressed as well? Altogether, the authors should either provide additional data showing that SNX6-dependent distribution of Homer1b/c does not require retromer, or remove this conclusion."

The authors should be much more explicit on this issue, as other molecules have been implicated in endosome transport. If Homer1b/c and SNX6 are transported on early endosomes, then SNX6 knockout should affect endosome motility. This should be easy to measure, and such data should be included. Alternatively, if SNX6 in complex with dynein transports the non-endosomal Homer1 population, what kind of vesicles are these, and what is then the relevance of colocalization of Homer1 with endosomes?"

In contrast, the endogenous Homer1b/c is well known to show a synaptic localization. It is thus possible that the non-synaptic fluorescently tagged Homer 1b/c is present in aggregates, and that loss of SNX6 affects the very infrequent motility of these aggregates. The motility of fluorescent Homer1b/c particles might then be irrelevant to the distribution of synaptic Homer1. It is possible that the synaptic localization of Homer1b/c actually depends on protein diffusion and not on microtubule-based transport, an option that is not even properly discussed. The authors should use FRAP to investigate the turnover of the synaptic population of Homer1b/c in order to find out whether synaptic Homer1 exchanges with the soluble cytosolic pool of the protein or traffics into synapses as particles, and whether any of these processes are affected by the loss of SNX6."

The results most relevant to the overall message of the paper are that the labeled Homer1c structures only very rarely enter spines and that photobleached Homer1c in spines shows SNX6-independent recovery by 50% within 10 minutes through exchange with the soluble pool. These are very significant results, because together, they provide strong support for the view that Homer1c is not delivered into spines on endosomes but simply exchanges with the soluble pool in a SNX6-independent manner, which is not unexpected. Since most of dendritic Homer1c is present in spines, but vesicular transport is not responsible for delivering Homer1c into spines, the role of SNX6-dependent vesicle transport in \"dendritic delivery of Homer1b/c\" becomes confusing. Is it needed to redistribute soluble Homer1c through dendrites, so that it can then diffuse into spines? Or does Homer1c on endosomes represent part of a Homer1c pathway distinct from Homer1c function in dendritic spines? Based on the data presented in the paper, these questions are impossible to address. However, the data as they stand now certainly bring the importance of the observed SNX6-dependent transport of Homer1c on endosomes into question."

Although the interaction between SNX6 and Homer1b/c is pretty strong in both in vitro binding assay (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D\u2013F</a> in the original manuscript) and coIP with overexpressing proteins (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a> in the original manuscript), given the fact that the interaction between dynein\u2212dynactin and SNX6 is weak and transient, and can only be detected when both proteins (endogenous) are associated with membranes, which is well documented in our previous studies (Hong et al., 2009; Niu et al., 2013), it is not practical to coIP all three proteins with buffer containing detergent. Therefore, we decided to take an alternative approach to determine whether SNX6 is required for association of Homer1b/c cargo with dynein\u2212dynactin: we performed immunoisolation experiment of membrane fractions from mouse brain with antibodies to Homer1b/c, p150<sup>Glued</sup> or DIC and examined whether these proteins still associate with the same vesicles in the absence of SNX6. Although the anti-Homer1b/c antibody failed to immunoisolate/enrich Homer1b/c-positive vesicles, we are very pleased that Homer1b/c was detected on p150Glued- or DIC-positive vesicles isolated from wild-type but not SNX6 knockout mouse brain (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6H</a>).

First, it has been well established that early endosomes serve as carrier that is transported from the cell body to dendrites to provide membrane supply and other materials for dendrite development (Satoh et al., 2008; Zheng et al., 2008). As we have discussed in the original manuscript, microtubules in the dendrite are of mixed polarity and dynein serves as the motor to transport cargoes from the cell body to dendrite, our data that Homer1b/c transport is driven by dynein is in full agreement with previous studies (Satoh et al., 2008; Zheng et al., 2008; Kapitein et al., 2010). Second, in our initial analysis of Homer1b/c distribution in dendrite, we quantified mean intensity of Homer1b/c in dendritic segments ranging from 30 to 120 \u03bcm from the cell body, and focused on spine localization of Homer1. In light of reviewer\u2019s comments we have performed quantitative analysis of confocal images to determine whether its dendritic distribution decreases towards the distal end of dendrites. We are very pleased to find that indeed, similar to phenotypes caused by inhibition of dynein\u2212dynactin activity (new <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D\u2013G</a>), the signal intensity of Homer1b/c decreases in distal dendrites in SNX6 knockout neurons, accompanied with its accumulation in the cell body, which was rescued by overexpression of mCherry-SNX6 (new <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5H\u2013I</a>, please refer to Response to Comment #2). These data together indicate that transport of Homer1b/c from the cell body to dendrite requires dynein\u2212dynactin, which support and greatly strengthen our original conclusions and are added to the manuscript as <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5H\u2013I</a>."

However, this comparison is not fair, because a SNX6 knockout and VPS35 knockdown are used, and the data are thus not directly comparable. The observation that VPS35 and Homer1b/c do not colocalize may be due to the fact that the two proteins do not bind directly but only through SNX6, which becomes limiting when both VPS35 and Homer1b/c are overexpressed. Is colocolalization of VPS35 and Homer1b/c observed when SNX6 is overexpressed as well?

Since we do not have the Vps35+/m mice, based on the previous findings on VPS35 haploinsufficiency and the role of the retromer core complex in neuronal survival and degeneration (Wen et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2014; Tang et al., 2015), i.e., even ~50% reduction in VPS35 protein levels causes severe phenotypes in neuronal function and survival, we chose to transiently knockdown its expression in hippocampal neurons to assess its role in dendritic transport of Homer1b/c. Quantitative analysis shows that the VPS35 knockdown efficiency is 70-80% (<a href=\"#fig11\">Author response image 1</a>).

Since Homer and Shank are binding partners in the PSD, and genes encoding Shank family members are causative genes for autism spectrum disorders (ASD) (Hulbert and Jiang, 2016), it is natural to reason that changes in Homer1 functions/levels/distribution might also cause autism-like phenotypes in mice. We searched literature and found that intriguingly, although mutations or deletion of Shank family members causes abnormal social and repetitive behaviors in mouse models (Jiang and Ehlers, 2013), no link between Homer and human ASD has been reported (Hulbert and Jiang, 2016). Interestingly, previous studies report that Homer1 knockout mice that lack both long and short isoforms in the brain spent more time in social interaction with a na\u00efve WT stranger in the social dyad test than wild-type and no difference in repetitive behaviors (Yuan et al., 2003; Jaubert et al., 2007). Though counterintuitive, this might be explained by functional redundancy among the Homer family members and/or distinct molecular and cellular functions of Homer and Shank besides their common role in PSD scaffolding. Nevertheless we performed social interaction and repetitive behavior assays on the SNX6 KO mice. The results show that the KO mice did not behave significantly different from the wild-type in these assays (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F and G</a>), indicating that ablation of SNX6 did not affect exactly the same higher brain functions involving Homer1 and its interaction partner Shank in brain regions other than the hippocampus. As we have pointed out in the Discussion, among the Homer family members, Homer1b/c is predominantly expressed in the hippocampal CA1 region (Shiraishi et al., 2004). Homer1 knockout mouse exhibited similar phenotypes in spatial learning and memory as SNX6 knockout, which could be rescued by AAV-mediated Homer1c expression in the hippocampus (Gerstein et al., 2012). Furthermore, AAV-mediated delivery of Homer1c also improved the spatial learning deficits in a rat model of cognitive learning (Gerstein et al., 2013). Based on the previous findings on Homer1 involvement in hippocampal-dependent spatial learning and memory and our data, we conclude that ablation of SNX6 specifically impairs Homer1 functions in the hippocampus."

We agree with the reviewer that to thoroughly investigate physiological changes in the CNS caused by SNX6 knockout, we should analyze spine morphology and synapse structure in other regions of the brain including the cerebral cortex. However, technically it is very difficult because currently we have no clue other than deficits in spatial learning and memory to help us locate the exact regions or neural circuits in the cortex for analyses at cellular and subcellular levels. Like identifying other vesicular cargoes mediated by SNX6 or other neural circuits affected by SNX6 knockout, it is our long-term goal to analyze brain regions of the KO mice other than the hippocampus and is beyond the scope of this manuscript."

Please note that since Homer1b/c is a scaffold protein, the cystosolic distribution of overexpressed protein generates diffuse signals in the cell in addition to puncta, which could be extracted with the mild detergent digitonin before IF staining, while transmembrane proteins or proteins associated with membranous structures remain in the cytoplasm. First of all, to determine whether the fluorescent proteins overexpressed in cultured neurons faithfully recapitulate the distribution of endogenous proteins, we transfected neurons with corresponding constructs and performed immunofluorescence staining. To remove overexpressed proteins in cytosol we conducted digitonin extraction of live neurons before fixation and staining (please see Immunofluorescence staining, confocal image acquisition and analysis in Materials and methods for details). Confocal images indicate that mEmerald-Homer1c indeed partially colocalizes with both the endosomal marker EEA1 and endogenous SNX6 in dendrites; conversely, mCherry-SNX6 colocalizes with EEA1 and endogenous Homer1b/c. Moreover, both mEmerald-Homer1c and mCherry-SNX6 also partially overlapped with PSD95, indicating that like the endogenous proteins, the overexpressed fluorescent fusion proteins could localize to dendritic spines.

Unlike mitochondria (~30% are motile) or endosomes (Yap et al., 2008), which are actively transported in neuronal cells to fulfill their cellular functions, both Homer1c and PSD95 are scaffold proteins that stay anchored to the postsynaptic cytomatrix once they have been delivered to the postsynaptic site. Since we performed live imaging of neurons in which the fusion protein has been overexpressed to levels high enough to detect the fluorescent signals, by the time of imaging most of the protein molecules might have already been delivered to the spines. Nevertheless, in light of reviewer\u2019s comments, we performed live imaging of mEmerald-Homer1c in Snx6+/+ and Snx6-/- neurons. We are very pleased to find out that compared with wild-type neurons, there was approximately 10-fold decrease in the fraction of motile Homer1c puncta in Snx6-/- neurons (29 out of 311 mEmerald-Homer1c puncta from 10 Snx6+/+ neurons are motile, whereas only 10 out of 1217 puncta from 40 Snx6-/- neurons are motile). These data indicate that the dendritic vesicular transport of Homer1c is indeed SNX6-dependent, which further strengthened our original conclusion.

However, we would like to respectfully point out that we have addressed the issue already in the original manuscript with significant amount of experimentation. We determined whether SNX6-mediated dendritic transport of Homer1b/c is dynein-dependent with two approaches: 1) we treated hippocampal neurons with ciliobrevin D, an inhibitor of dynein activity, and analyzed dendritic distribution of Homer1b/c by IF staining and confocal microscopy; 2) we overexpressed the N-terminal fragment of p150Glued, a dominant negative mutant that disrupts SNX6-p150Glued interaction, in hippocampal neurons and analyzed distribution of Homer1b/c in dendrites. Quantification results indicate that indeed, inhibition of dynein activity caused decrease in synaptic distribution of Homer1b/c (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5J\u2013K</a>), and disruption of motor-adaptor interaction caused accumulation of Homer1b/c in the cell body and its decrease in distal dendrites (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5L\u2013M</a>). Moreover, in the revised manuscript, to further confirm that dynein\u2212dynactin drives Homer1b/c transport from the cell body to dendrites, we repeated the ciliobrevin D treatment experiment and compared the subcellular distribution of Homer1b/c in the cell body and dendritic segments. The results show that, consistent with data in the original manuscript, inhibition of dynein activity causes accumulation of Homer1b/c in the cell body and its decrease in the distal region of dendrites. Further, we performed two new experiments to determine whether SNX6 serves as cargo adaptor to link the dynein-dynactin motor complex to Homer1b/c vesicular cargo: 1) colocalization analysis of Homer1b/c and dynein\u2212dynactin in SNX6 knockout neurons; 2) immunoisolation of Homer1b/c- and dynein\u2212dynactin-double positive vesicles from SNX6 knockout mouse brain. The results show that 1) the colocalization between Homer1b/c with DIC and p150Glued is decreased when SNX6 is ablated, whereas the colocalization between Homer1b/c and EEA1 is not affected; 2) although the antibodies against Homer1b/c did not work for immunoisolation, antibodies to both p150Glued and DIC worked and western blotting detected Homer1b/c on DIC- or p150Glued-positive vesicles from wild-type but not SNX6-/- mouse brain. All together, these cell biological and biochemical data indicate that SNX6-mediated dendritic transport of Homer1b/c requires dynein\u2212dynactin activity.

Since Homer1b/c is a scaffold protein, the cystosolic distribution of overexpressed protein generates diffuse signals in the cell in addition to puncta, which could be extracted with the mild detergent digitonin before IF staining, while transmembrane proteins or proteins associated with membranous structures remain in the cytoplasm. To determine whether the fluorescent proteins overexpressed in cultured neurons faithfully recapitulate the distribution of endogenous proteins, we performed immunofluorescence staining of digitonin-extracted neurons transfected with corresponding constructs. Confocal images indicate that mEmerald-Homer1c indeed partially colocalizes with both the endosomal marker EEA1 and endogenous SNX6 in dendrites; conversely, mCherry-SNX6 colocalizes with both EEA1 and endogenous Homer1b/c (Please see below). Moreover, since digitonin extraction removes cytosolic proteins, we could not use overexpressed cytosolic GFP or RFP as volume marker to determine whether or not mEmerald-Homer1c and mCherry-SNX6 also distribute in dendritic spines. Instead, we performed immunostaining of the postsynaptic marker PSD95 on transfected neurons. We are very pleased to report that both mEmerald-Homer1c and mCherry-SNX6 signals partially colocalize with PSD95 (Please see below), indicating that like the endogenous proteins, the overexpressed fluorescent proteins localize in both dendritic shaft and spines.

One would like to see proof that SNX6 really connects Homer1b/c to dynein, for example, by showing a reduced colocalization or a reduced biochemical interaction between Homer1b/c and the dynein complex in SNX6 knockout. Alternatively, you might consider a possibility that SNX6 participates in transporting Homer1b/c by simply recruiting it to endosomes, which then bind to microtubule motors independently of SNX6.

We apologize for the confusion/misunderstanding that might have been caused by our failure to make this aspect of the paper clearer. Based on the data that Homer1b/c and SNX6 colocalize on early endosomes and dendritic transport of Homer1b/c requires SNX6 and dynein\u2012dynactin, we propose that SNX6 serves as dynein cargo adaptor to mediate vesicular transport of Homer1b/c. In the absence of SNX6, the link between the motor and Homer1b/c-associated vesicles is missing, so that there is a decrease in colocalization between Homer1 and dynein. Please note that we did not claim that SNX6 links Homer1 to endosomes. Instead, current data support that SNX6 recognizes the endosomal carrier for Homer1b/c via its direct interaction with the cargo molecule. Indeed, it is an excellent question how active transport of endosomes carrying different cargoes is regulated by their cargo adaptors. In fact, during the study on SNX6\u2019s role in dendrite we searched the literature on dendritic trafficking. We found that 1) most studies focus on recycling endosomes and receptor trafficking to the postsynaptic site, mechanisms for long-range transport of endosomal cargoes and their adaptors for molecular motors remain to be identified; 2) the motility of endosomes labeled by different cargoes is not the same. Research conducted by Dr. Bettina Winckler and her colleagues at University of Virginia has identified Neep21 as a regulator for early endosomal sorting and trafficking in dendrites (Yap et al., 2008). Intriguingly, they found by live imaging that only 7% of EEA1-positive endosomes are motile, compared with 63% of Neep21-positive endosomes (Lasiecka et al., 2014). Moreover, the run length and velocity of these two types of vesicles are also quite different from each other (Lasiecka et al., 2014). These findings suggest that there are multiple mechanisms underlying endosomal transport. To make sure we have not missed any most recent progress on this topic, we consulted an expert about endosome motility in dendrites, who was very nice to provide us the following information based on their published and unpublished imaging data:"

That is to say, they do not represent all early endosomes or endosome-derived vesicles carrying different cargoes. Given the heterogeneity of early endosomes in composition and motility and the various transport pathways they might adopt (recycling to the plasma membrane, retrograde transport to the TGN, and trafficking to, conversion to late endosome and fusion with lysosomes, etc.), even if we carry out the live imaging experiment with a well-known endosomal marker protein, e.g., EEA1 or Rab5, questions still remain as to whether EEA1- or Rab5-labeled vesicles represent a proportion or all types of endosomal carriers derived from early endosomes, and whether SNX6 mediates transport of all endosomal carriers derived from EEA1- or Rab5-positive endosomes.

We apologize for not being able to explain explicitly that our current findings do not suggest that SNX6 is directly responsible for transport of Homer1b/c, whether it associates with vesicles or not, from dendritic shaft to spines. Besides the live imaging data showing that the motility of Homer1b/c vesicles is greatly impaired in SNX6 knockout neurons, IF staining and microscopy analysis show that Homer1b/c distribution in distal dendrites is reduced in the absence of SNX6, indicating that long-range vesicular transport of Homer1b/c from the cell body to dendrite is SNX6-dependent. To verify that failure of Homer1b/c transport to distal dendrites leads to its loss from dendritic spines and decrease in spine density of distal dendrites, we went back to the original confocal images and quantified spine localization of Homer1b/c over distance from the soma. The results are as expected and are in good agreement with a decrease in Homer1b/c signals in distal dendrite (<a href=\"#fig12\">Author response image 2</a>), which we would incorporate in the manuscript. Although we did detect SNX6 signals in spines by IF staining, we have not obtained any direct evidence showing that transport of Homer1b/c into spines, whether microtubule- and dynein-dependent or not, is mediated by SNX6.

We appreciate the editor/reviewer suggesting the FRAP experiment to determine whether Homer1b/c enters dendritic spine by active transport or diffusion. However, since overexpressed Homer1c-EGFP is in excess, in addition to its presence on vesicles, lots of the molecules are cytosolic, and those that have been delivered to spine incorporate into the PSD, forming higher-order polymerized complex with Shank that is necessary for the structural and functional integrity of spines (Bosch et al., 2014; Hayashi et al., 2009; Meyer et al., 2014), As a consequence of overexpression, there would be three pools of Homer1c-EGFP, namely vesicular, cytosolic and PSD-associated. Given that Homer1 in spines complexes with other PSD scaffold proteins to form a matrix structure, for neurons at steady state, it is highly unlikely the PSD-associated Homer1 exchanges with the free molecules in the cytosolic pool. Instead, we would rather expect addition of Homer1 to the expanding PSD during synaptic plasticity when the spine head expands. However, testing this idea is beyond the scope of this manuscript. Besides, if there are plenty of proteins in the cytosol, most likely those free molecules enter and leave spines by diffusion, which might just be an overexpression artifact. So we would expect that FRAP measures the diffusion rate of cytosolic Homer1 in spine and shaft area adjacent to the spine, rather than exchange between the synaptically incorporated and the cytosolic pools. As for vesicular Homer1, since we have already found that only ~ 10% of Homer1 puncta are motile (similar to PSD95 puncta in the 2006 Gerrow paper), considering the limited number of spines in the viewfield of high magnification lens under microscope, it is technically very difficult to catch those vesicles entering spines if there are any, let alone monitor the exchange of the motile puncta with synaptic Homer1 by FRAP. Moreover, previous studies using FRAP to measure mobility of PSD95 bound in the PSD do not provide strong support for the presumption that there is rapid exchange between synaptic and cytosolic PSD scaffold protein molecules (Blanpied et al., 2008). Again, we appreciate the wonderful question and suggestion from reviewers, and we would be more than happy to try our best to do the FRAP experiment. However, with the caveats and potential problems discussed above, FRAP results might not provide useful information to answer the question whether SNX6 is required for delivery of Homer1 from shaft to spine but rather means for investigation of Homer1 turnover in spine."

The results most relevant to the overall message of the paper are that the labeled Homer1c structures only very rarely enter spines and that photobleached Homer1c in spines shows SNX6-independent recovery by 50% within 10 minutes through exchange with the soluble pool. These are very significant results, because together, they provide strong support for the view that Homer1c is not delivered into spines on endosomes but simply exchanges with the soluble pool in a SNX6-independent manner, which is not unexpected. Since most of dendritic Homer1c is present in spines, but vesicular transport is not responsible for delivering Homer1c into spines, the role of SNX6-dependent vesicle transport in \"dendritic delivery of Homer1b/c\" becomes confusing. Is it needed to redistribute soluble Homer1c through dendrites, so that it can then diffuse into spines? Or does Homer1c on endosomes represent part of a Homer1c pathway distinct from Homer1c function in dendritic spines? Based on the data presented in the paper, these questions are impossible to address. However, the data as they stand now certainly bring the importance of the observed SNX6-dependent transport of Homer1c on endosomes into question.</i> "

Previously imaging assays and quantitative modeling have established that dynein-driven bidirectional transport contributes to polarized targeting of dendrite-specific cargo (Kapitein et al., 2010). Therefore, lack of dynein\u2012dynactin-driven transport in the dendritic shaft provides a possible mechanism for the Homer1b/c distribution phenotype in Snx6<sup>-/-</sup> neurons. However, since the majority of Homer1c puncta are immobile in dendrites of steady-state neurons, and little is known about the cellular functions of SNX6 apart from its role as dynein cargo adaptor, it is also possible that SNX6 regulates the distribution of Homer1b/c in dendrites via mechanism(s) distinct from dynein\u2012dynactin-driven transport. Moreover, ablation of SNX6 does not cause complete loss of Homer1b/c from distal dendrites, indicating that mechanism(s) other than SNX6-mediated transport contributes to its localization to dendritic shaft far from the cell body.

In dendrites, several mechanisms exist for transfer of postsynaptic components from shaft to synaptic sites in spines, including cytosolic diffusion, exocytosis of transmembrane proteins at the plasma membrane and their lateral diffusion to synaptic sites, and active transport by molecular motors. The AMPARs enter dendritic spines via both lateral diffusion and actin-based, Myosin V-driven transport of recycling endosomes (Adesnik et al., 2005; Correia et al., 2008; Makino and Malinow, 2009; Wang et al., 2008; Yudowski et al., 2007). Since Homer1b/c is a scaffolding protein, its entry into spines might rely on diffusion of free molecules, possibly released from endosomal carriers or from the cytosolic pool in the shaft, or transport of the vesicular cargo directly from the shaft by a different motor. Our results from live imaging, FRAP and quantitative analyses show that direct spine entry of Homer1c puncta is an extremely rare event, and that the dynamic turnover of Homer1c in spines is not affected by ablation of SNX6. Collectively these data indicate that in steady-state neurons, Homer1b/c enters spines by cytosolic diffusion, and SNX6 is not required for its spine localization.\u201d"
