However, the mechanisms that regulate ion channels abundance remain poorly understood. Here we show that <i>pickpocket 29</i> (<i>ppk29</i>), a gene that encodes a <i>Drosophila</i> degenerin/epithelial sodium channel (DEG/ENaC), regulates neuronal excitability via a protein-independent mechanism. We demonstrate that the mRNA 3\u2032UTR of <i>ppk29</i> affects neuronal firing rates and associated heat-induced seizures by acting as a natural antisense transcript (NAT) that regulates the neuronal mRNA levels of <i>seizure</i> (<i>sei</i>), the <i>Drosophila</i> homolog of the human <i>Ether-\u00e0-go-go</i> Related Gene (hERG) potassium channel. We find that the regulatory impact of <i>ppk29</i> mRNA on <i>sei</i> is independent of the sodium channel it encodes. Thus, our studies reveal a novel mRNA dependent mechanism for the regulation of neuronal excitability that is independent of protein-coding capacity."

These signals are generated when a stimulus causes sodium and potassium ion channels in the cell membrane to open, leading to an influx of sodium ions, followed by an efflux of potassium ions. Changes in temperature affect the rate at which ion channels open and close, and thus affect how easy it is for a stimulus to trigger an action potential. In response to a sudden rise in temperature, neurons must adjust the number of ion channels in their membranes to ensure that they do not become hyperexcitable, which could result in epilepsy."

In the fruit fly, <i>Drosophila</i>, a gene for a potassium channel is found on the same chromosomal location as a gene for a sodium channel, and some of the genetic elements that regulate the expression of these two genes even overlap. However, the genes are on opposite strands of the DNA double helix. This means that when the genes are transcribed to produce molecules of messenger RNA (mRNA), which is usually single stranded, some of the mRNA molecules will pair up to form double-stranded mRNA molecules. This is significant because such RNA \u2018duplexes\u2019 have been shown to inhibit the translation of conventional single-stranded mRNA molecules into proteins, or to lead to their complete degradation."

However, insects with mutations in the sodium channel gene are not affected because, surprisingly, they have a higher than expected number of potassium channels. It turns out that the mutant sodium channel mRNA molecules are unable to form RNA duplexes with potassium channel mRNA molecules: these duplexes would normally limit the number of potassium channels so, in their absence, the number of potassium channels increases, and this protects the flies from seizures."

Thus, the failure of neurons to adjust their physiological properties in response to a fast rise in temperature can lead to neurological disorders such as febrile seizures (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bassan et al., 2013</a>). Previous theoretical and experimental studies suggested that one of the main mechanisms for maintaining normal neuronal excitability, circuit integrity, and behavioral robustness under varying environmental temperatures depends on changes in the abundance and membrane half-life of various voltage-dependent ion channels (<a href=\"#bib23\">Marder and Prinz, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">O\u2019Leary et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Rinberg et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Rosati and McKinnon, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Tang et al., 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib37\">2012</a>).

Although the function of the majority of NATs is still unknown, evidence suggests that at least some <i>cis</i>-NATs are likely to act as regulatory RNAs of protein-coding transcripts (<a href=\"#bib6\">Borsani et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Okamura et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Watanabe et al., 2008</a>), including a recent report about a non-coding NAT that regulates a neuronal potassium channel (<a href=\"#bib46\">Zhao et al., 2013</a>).

                                "text": "Using this approach, we found that the gene <i>seizure</i> (<i>sei</i>), which encodes the sole fly homolog of the human <i>Ether-\u00e0-go-go</i> Related Gene (hERG) inward rectifying K<sup>+</sup> channel (<a href=\"#bib40\">Titus et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Wang et al., 1997</a>), is located downstream of the degenerin/epithelial sodium channel (DEG/ENaC) <i>ppk29</i> (<a href=\"#bib19\">Liu et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Thistle et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Zelle et al., 2013</a>). The two genes are convergently transcribed on opposite DNA strands, and have complementary 3\u2032UTRs that overlap by 88 nucleotides, which we confirmed by fully sequenced cDNAs deposited in NCBI and 3\u2019RACE analysis (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). The two opposing physiological functions of <i>sei</i> and <i>ppk29</i> (K<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> channels respectively), and the realization that their transcripts could form natural sense/antisense RNA duplexes (<a href=\"#bib16\">Katayama et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Czech et al., 2008</a>) led us to hypothesize that the mRNAs of <i>sei</i> and <i>ppk29</i> may regulate each other via the formation of natural endogenous dsRNAs. Since mRNA-dependent interaction between <i>sei</i> and <i>ppk29</i> requires that the two genes will be co-transcribed we first analyzed expression data from the modENcode (<a href=\"#bib8\">Cherbas et al., 2011</a>) and the FlyExpress (<a href=\"#bib33\">Robinson et al., 2013</a>) projects. Although previous studies suggested that <i>ppk29</i> function might be a sensory-specific (<a href=\"#bib19\">Liu et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Thistle et al., 2012</a>), our analysis revealed that <i>sei</i> and <i>ppk29</i> are co-expressed in neuronal cell lines (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>) and are both enriched in the fly central nervous system (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). <i>In situ</i> hybridization in the fly brain also demonstrated neuronal co-expression (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B\u2013D</a>). Furthermore, we used cell-specific mRNA enrichment (<a href=\"#bib39\">Thomas et al., 2012</a>) to demonstrate that both genes are co-expressed in motor neurons <i>in vivo</i> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>).

Thus, as a first test of our hypothesis that these two ion channels might interact antagonistically to regulate the neuronal response to heat we measured the relative expression levels of both genes in wild type animals that were adapted to variable environmental temperatures. In agreement with our hypothesis, we found that when animals adapted to high temperature (37\u00b0C) the transcripts levels of <i>sei</i> went up and <i>ppk29</i> went down relative to their levels at 25\u00b0C. In contrast, adaptation to colder temperature (13\u00b0C) led to an opposite effect on the expression of both genes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). We conclude that both <i>sei</i> and <i>ppk29</i> are likely to play opposite roles in the regulation of neuronal activity in response to changes in ambient temperature, and that the possible interaction between these two genes is physiologically relevant."

Based on our model presented in Figure 6, such a protective effects for <i>ppk29</i> mutations may arise from the loss of sodium currents or alternatively due to the upregulation of SEI-dependent potassium currents. As was previously reported, we found that multiple independent mutations in <i>sei</i> lead to rapid seizures and paralysis in response to acute heat stress (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). In contrast, flies carrying independent insertional alleles of <i>ppk29</i> demonstrated protection from the effects of heat stress relative to wild type and <i>sei</i> mutant animals (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>; <i>ppk29</i><sup>P1</sup> and <i>ppk29</i><sup>P2</sup> are described in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>).

Therefore, we hypothesized that mutations in <i>ppk29</i> will lead to a hypoexcitable neuronal phenotype under heat stress. We found that the spontaneous neuronal activity of larval motor neurons is not different between <i>ppk29</i>, <i>sei</i> and wild type animals at 25\u00b0C. In contrast, at 38\u00b0C wild type neurons show a small but significant increase in neuronal activity, while <i>sei</i> mutant neurons become hyperexcitable. In contrast to <i>sei</i> null and wild type animals, <i>ppk29</i> mutants are unable to increase neuronal firing rates in response to heat stress, which is consistent with a hypoexcitability phenotype (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,C</a>). We also confirmed that the larval excitability phenotypes of <i>sei</i> and <i>ppk29</i> mutants are correlated with behavior. As in our neurophysiological studies, we found that at 25\u00b0C all genotypes show normal larval locomotion (<a href=\"#media1\">Videos 1\u20133</a>). However, exposure to 38\u00b0C lead to an abnormal seizure-like locomotion in wild type animals (twitching and rolling). This phenotype is significantly higher in <i>sei</i> mutant and RNAi knockdown larvae but completely absent in <i>ppk29</i> mutant larvae (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1E,F</a>; <a href=\"#media4\">Videos 4\u20136</a>). We conclude that <i>sei</i> and <i>ppk29</i> affect the behavioral sensitivity to heat stress via the contrasting regulation of neuronal excitability in both larval and adult stages."

Therefore, we investigated whether the protection from heat stress in <i>ppk29</i> mutants is mediated by the loss of PPK29 channel activity or the up-regulation of <i>sei</i> mRNAs (As shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E,F</a>). To test this we first blocked SEI channel activity in wild type and <i>ppk29</i> mutant animals by using two different hERG channel blockers (<a href=\"#bib2\">Afrasiabi et al., 2010</a>). These studies reveal that blocking SEI activity in wild type animals phenocopies the heat sensitivity phenotype of the <i>sei</i> mutation, which indicate that the drugs are successfully blocking SEI channels in the fly. Similar to wild type animals, blocking SEI activity in <i>ppk29</i> mutants reduce their resistance to heat stress to a level comparable to wild type animals in a dose-dependent manner (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). These data are in agreement with the expression data (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E,F</a>), and strongly indicate that the <i>ppk29</i>-mediated protection from heat stress is due, at least in part, to increased SEI K<sup>+</sup> channel activity rather then the loss of <i>ppk29</i>-dependent Na<sup>+</sup> currents."

To test directly this hypothesis we generated transgenic fly lines that can express the cDNAs of either <i>sei</i> or <i>ppk29</i> with or without their endogenous 3\u2032UTR, or their 3\u2032UTRs alone (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>) by using the UAS-GAL4 system. Remarkably, we found that the expression of the <i>ppk29</i> endogenous 3\u2032UTR alone or the cDNA with the 3\u2032UTR is sufficient to rescue the <i>ppk29</i> mutation. In contrast, expression of <i>ppk29</i> cDNA alone is not sufficient to completely rescue the phenotype of the <i>ppk29</i> mutation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). In agreement with the pharmacological studies, these data demonstrate that the main protective effect of <i>ppk29</i> mutations is mediated via 3\u2032UTR-dependent regulation of SEI, independent of PPK29 channel functions. Nevertheless, we also found that a complete rescue of the <i>ppk29</i> mutation phenotype require the expression of the <i>ppk29</i> cDNA with its endogenous 3\u2032UTR. Therefore, PPK29 channel activity may also contribute neuronal excitability independent of <i>sei</i> regulation. In addition, since the observed effects of <i>ppk29</i> transgenes on <i>sei</i> function are <i>in trans,</i> these data show that the two genes can interact at the transcript level independent of their chromosomal proximity. Unlike for <i>ppk29</i>, the neuronal expression of <i>sei</i> cDNA with or without its endogenous 3\u2032UTR, but not the 3\u2032UTR alone, is sufficient to rescue the <i>sei</i> mutation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>).

Thus, via mechanisms that are not fully understood, RISC treats only one of the strands as a guide (<a href=\"#bib41\">Tomari et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Rand et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Betancur and Tomari, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Noland and Doudna, 2013</a>).

For example, the double-stranded RNA helicase <i>maleless</i> (<i>mle</i>) regulates the <i>Drosophila</i> voltage-gated sodium channel <i>paralytic</i> (<i>para</i>) via A-to-I RNA editing. Mutations in <i>mle</i> lead to aberrant editing of <i>para</i>, splicing errors, and subsequent low channel activity (<a href=\"#bib31\">Reenan et al., 2000</a>).

In this regard, our studies provide an additional layer of regulatory complexity, and support the idea that mRNAs, which are typically thought to solely act as the template for protein translation, can also serve as regulatory RNAs, independent of their protein-coding capacity. Thus, the abundance of convergent transcription of protein-coding genes in eukaryotic genomes suggests that many other mRNAs might serve dual functions that are not necessary associated with the same cellular or physiological processes. Furthermore, although the phenomenon of mRNA-dependent interaction between the two genes we describe here occurs in <i>cis</i> (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>), we currently have no reason to assume that similar interactions between RNAs cannot occur in <i>trans</i> as well. Consequently, it is likely that some of the evolutionary changes observed in mRNAs, including those that are considered \u2018neutral\u2019, should be re-evaluated in light of the possible regulatory function that some mRNAs might exert independently of the proteins they encode."

We preferentially recorded from segmental nerves that innervate the anterior segments with a polished glass electrode to suck up the nerves. Neuronal signals were filtered by a high-pass filter set at 100 Hz and a low-pass filter set at 10 kHz (Clampex software package). The extracellular temperature was manipulated in the recording chamber by using a temperature-control perfusion system (Multi Channel Systems MCS, Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, Germany) using the following protocol: (1) Recording of neuronal activity started once the perfusion system was stable at 25\u00b0C for at least 1 min. Neuronal spikes were recorded at baseline for 3 min. (2) To acutely raise the temperature, perfusion was turned off until it reached 38\u00b0C stabley for at least 1 min.

We interpret our data to indicate that when <i>seizure</i> mRNA levels are high due to a mutation in <i>ppk29</i> it leads to an increase in baseline resistance to heat. Thus, we predict that the slow adaptation to heat as seen in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> is the natural process in which flies slowly become desensitized to the effects of slowly increasing temperatures by increasing <i>seizure</i> expression and lowering <i>ppk29</i> expression. We now make this distinction clearer in our Discussion."
