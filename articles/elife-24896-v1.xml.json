When a fly perceives an approaching object, such as a fly swatter, it repositions itself and executes an escape strategy in less time than the blink of an eye (<a href=\"#bib2\">Card and Dickinson, 2008</a>). Flies produce an impressive repertoire of visual behaviors, including escape, with a brain that contains a relatively small number of neurons. <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, the fruit fly, has become an enormously useful model for studying visual behavior, yet the neural mechanisms for transforming object signals (such as an approaching swatter) into motor actions (escape) remain poorly understood."

The processing in these optic lobes happens in a retinotopic fashion: in other words, signals from neighboring facets are passed through the optic lobes by neighboring columns of neurons. The signals are first processed by an optic lobe called the lamina, followed by the medulla, and then the lobula and the lobula plate (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). The last two lobes collate retinotopic information from all the inputs and project axons that carry filtered signals to structures elsewhere in the brain."

Now, in eLife, Aljoscha Nern, Gerald Rubin and colleagues at the Janelia Research Campus \u2013 including Ming Wu and Nern as joint first authors \u2013 report the results of a series of anatomical and behavioral experiments to understand the architecture and functions of these neurons (<a href=\"#bib8\">Wu et al., 2016</a>).

Wu et al. first screened large collections of genetically modified flies to find lines in which it is possible to fluorescently label all the retinotopic neurons of a given VPN class that project from the lobula to the center of the brain. Then they stochastically labeled a few individual neurons in each of the 22 VPN classes with different fluorescent colors. This systematic approach allowed them to take high-resolution pictures of input dendrites and output axon terminals, and to demonstrate that each VPN class had a characteristic number of cells, dendritic span, and axon output location (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Whereas the input dendrites in each class were organized in a retinotopic fashion, the axon terminals were fully intermingled to form an optic glomerulus. Strikingly, it would appear that the spatial information contained in the inputs is thrown away because it is not contained in the outputs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>)."

Activation of two classes (called LC6 and LC16) resulted in significant jumping and backward walking, which are hallmarks of visual escape behavior. In further tests strong calcium currents were detected in both classes when the flies were presented with a looming stimulus (like an approaching fly swatter). It would appear that LC6 and LC16 neurons transform looming visual information into the motor control of a rapid escape behavior (also see <a href=\"#bib6\">von Reyn et al., 2014</a>)."

This means that activating a given class may be sufficient to provoke a specific behavior, but silencing the same class does not necessarily quell that behavior. What gives rise to the apparent redundancy within the brain? 4) We recently performed a complimentary comprehensive physiological characterization of one these VPN classes: this study revealed complex spatial inhibitory interactions, indicating that only a fraction of the neurons in this class are activated by the salient visual stimulus (<a href=\"#bib3\">Kele\u015f and Frye, 2017</a>). Therefore, as Wu et al. note, the use of optogenetic techniques to simultaneously activate the whole population of neurons does not mimic what happens naturally. How does the output sent to the glomerulus reflect the spatial dynamics of the inputs?"

In flies and mammals, the spatial pattern of olfactory glomeruli can signal the identity and intensity of an odorant (<a href=\"#bib7\">Wang et al., 2003</a>). Perhaps something similar is happening here, with the pattern of activation across different optic glomeruli signaling particular features of visual objects rather than their motion or location. The approaches developed by Wu et al. are likely to prove very useful for exploring this hypothesis and for studying how visual representations are transformed into behavioral commands more generally."
