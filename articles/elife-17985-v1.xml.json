We now describe an unexpected role of Pask in promoting the differentiation of myogenic progenitor cells, embryonic stem cells and adipogenic progenitor cells. This function of Pask is dependent upon its ability to phosphorylate Wdr5, a member of several protein complexes including those that catalyze histone H3 Lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) during transcriptional activation. Our findings suggest that, during myoblast differentiation, Pask stimulates the conversion of repressive H3K4me1 to activating H3K4me3 marks on the promoter of the differentiation gene myogenin (<i>Myog</i>) via Wdr5 phosphorylation. This enhances accessibility of the MyoD transcription factor and enables transcriptional activation of the <i>Myog</i> promoter to initiate muscle differentiation. Thus, as an upstream kinase of Wdr5, Pask integrates signaling cues with the transcriptional network to regulate the differentiation of progenitor cells."

We now describe an unexpected role of Pask in promoting the differentiation of myogenic progenitor cells, embryonic stem cells and adipogenic progenitor cells. This function of Pask is dependent upon its ability to phosphorylate Wdr5, a member of several protein complexes including those that catalyze histone H3 Lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) during transcriptional activation. Our findings suggest that, during myoblast differentiation, Pask stimulates the conversion of repressive H3K4me1 to activating H3K4me3 marks on the promoter of the differentiation gene myogenin (<i>Myog</i>) via Wdr5 phosphorylation. This enhances accessibility of the MyoD transcription factor and enables transcriptional activation of the <i>Myog</i> promoter to initiate muscle differentiation. Thus, as an upstream kinase of Wdr5, Pask integrates signaling cues with the transcriptional network to regulate the differentiation of progenitor cells."

The principal modality by which mammalian Pask appears to exert metabolic control is the regulation of gene expression. For example, Pask was shown to regulate the synthesis of fatty acids and triglycerides in the liver via activation of Sterol Regulatory Element Binding Protein-1 (SREBP-1) transcriptional activity in response to feeding and insulin (<a href=\"#bib66\">Wu et al., 2014</a>). Probably related to this function, pharmacologic inhibition or genetic ablation of Pask resulted in decreased liver fat content and improved insulin sensitivity in rodent models of diabetes and obesity (<a href=\"#bib19\">Hao et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Wu et al., 2014</a>). In pancreatic \u03b2-cells, Pask responds to extracellular glucose and stimulates the transcription of the gene encoding insulin via regulation of the PDX-1 transcription factor (<a href=\"#bib1\">An et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Semache et al., 2013</a>). In spite of these observations, it has remained unclear how Pask coordinates these seemingly diverse transcriptional responses in different cell types."

Interestingly, we noticed an\u00a0elevated <i>Pask</i> mRNA abundance in stem or progenitor cell types in several transcriptome datasets. Using genetic and pharmacologic means of modulating Pask activity, we have uncovered a novel function of Pask in regulating the differentiation of stem and progenitor cells into neuronal, adipocytes or myocytes lineages. The mechanism underlying this role depends upon direct phosphorylation of Wdr5, which is a component of several chromatin modifying complexes, including mixed lineage leukemia (Mll) histone H3 Lysine 4 (H3K4) methyltransferase complexes (<a href=\"#bib50\">Ruthenburg et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Wysocka et al., 2005</a>). Wdr5 is a histone H3 binding protein (<a href=\"#bib67\">Wysocka et al., 2005</a>) that is postulated to present the H3\u2009N-terminal tail to the Mll or Set1 enzymes for methylation at lysine 4 (<a href=\"#bib51\">Ruthenburg et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Schuetz et al., 2006</a>)."

H3K4me1 is typically found at enhancers, which are binding sites for regulatory DNA-binding transcription factors (<a href=\"#bib45\">Rada-Iglesias et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Shlyueva et al., 2014</a>). However, a recent study demonstrated that H3K4me1 functions as a transcriptional repressive mark at the promoters of lineage specifying genes (<a href=\"#bib13\">Cheng et al., 2014</a>). In contrast, H3K4me3 marks are usually associated with transcriptionally active promoters, or with poised promoters when found together with repressive H3K27me3 marks (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bernstein et al., 2006</a>). These histone modifications collaborate with pioneering transcription factors to elicit programs of gene expression that drive differentiation of stem and progenitor cells (<a href=\"#bib72\">Zaret and Carroll, 2011</a>). Using myogenic progenitor cells as a model of inducible differentiation, we show that phosphorylation of a single Wdr5 serine by Pask is necessary and sufficient for the conversion of repressive H3K4me1 marks to activating H3K4me3 marks at the lineage-specifying myogenin (<i>Myog</i>) promoter. This concomitantly enhances MyoD recruitment and chromatin remodeling of the <i>Myog</i> promoter and stimulates transcription of <i>Myog</i> to initiate terminal differentiation. Taken together, our results establish Wdr5 phosphorylation by Pask as an important node in the signaling and transcriptional network that initiates and executes differentiation."

Importantly, this effect appears to be cell autonomous as only that fraction of cells in the population that express WT Pask (WT<sup>+</sup>) show rescue of the fusion defect, whereas cells not expressing hPask within the same culture (WT<sup>-</sup>) remained mono-nucleated and fusion defective. Additionally, <i>Mylpf</i> (myosin light chain) and <i>Acta1</i> mRNAs, which are both markers of myoblast differentiation, failed to be induced in <i>Pask</i> knockdown cells.

In response to differentiation cues, myoblasts derived from WT mice efficiently formed multi-nucleated myotubes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>, quantified in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>). In contrast, genetic elimination of Pask (i.e. myoblasts derived from germline <i>Pask<sup>-/-\u00a0</sup></i>mice) caused a ~60% decrease in differentiation efficiency. Interestingly, the effect of Pask inhibition in WT cells was much more pronounced, almost completely eliminating myotube formation. BioE-1197 had no effect, however, on <i>Pask</i><sup>-/-</sup> myoblasts (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>, quantified in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>). This result demonstrates that the effects of the BioE-1197 Pask inhibitor are completely dependent on the presence of Pask, a clear indication that these effects are mediated by Pask inhibition. Moreover, these results demonstrate that myoblasts derived from germline <i>Pask<sup>-/-\u00a0</sup></i>mice exhibit a Pask-independent compensation that appears, at least in vitro, to partially rescue myotube formation."

During muscle regeneration, satellite cells become activated, proliferate and eventually fuse in response to differentiating signals to restore mature myotubes. We observed that as early as 3 days post injury, PASK mRNA (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>) and protein (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1I</a>) expression was robustly upregulated. This is consistent with high Pask expression in stem cells compared with differentiated cells (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>), since muscle stem cells begin to proliferate upon muscle injury before eventually fusing to replenish the injured myotome. To test the functional relevance of increased <i>Pask</i> expression during muscle regeneration, we compared the kinetics of muscle regeneration in WT and <i>Pask</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice. As shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1I</a>, whereas Myh3, a marker of regenerative myogenesis, was robustly induced as early as Day 5 in WT animals, <i>Pask</i><sup>-/-</sup> animals showed very little induction of Myh3 expression. Similarly, WT animals show robust induction of Myh3 immunohistochemical staining, but this was blunted in <i>Pask</i><sup>-/-</sup> muscle (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1J</a>, quantified in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1K</a>). Taken together, our data suggest that mammalian Pask plays an important role in the differentiation of stem cells across many lineages in vitro and during muscle regeneration in vivo."

Addition of differentiation medium (DM) further enhanced myoblast differentiation in hPask-expressing cells, as evidenced by the elevated expression of <i>Myog</i> and <i>Mylpf</i> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2L</a>). Together, these data establish Pask as necessary for the timely execution of the terminal differentiation program in myoblasts and as sufficient to initiate that program even in the absence of extrinsic differentiation signals."

Interestingly, previous ChIP-Seq data had suggested that MyoG, and to a lesser extent MyoD, occupies the <i>Pask</i> promoter during C2C12 differentiation coincident with H3K4me3 modification and RNA-PolII recruitment (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib71\">Yue et al., 2014</a>). We independently validated that MyoG was indeed recruited to the proximal <i>Pask</i> promoter upon initiation of differentiation (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>) and that MyoG expression stimulates expression from a <i>Pask</i> promoter-driven reporter gene (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3C</a>). These data suggest the possibility that <i>Pask</i> expression in differentiating myoblasts might be driven by MyoG to further support commitment to differentiate. Thus, taken together, our data show that Pask and MyoG engage in a positive, self-reinforcing feedback loop to enforce the terminal differentiation program once it has been signaled to initiate."

Because Pask protein expression correlated most strongly with that of MyoG and MyoG is known to repress Pax7 expression (<a href=\"#bib41\">Olguin et al., 2007</a>), we hypothesized that Pask collaborates with MyoD to induce MyoG expression. MyoD is a pioneering transcription factor that is sufficient to induce a myogenic cell fate even in non-muscle progenitor cells. C3H10T1/2 mesenchymal stem cells normally express the Peroxisome proliferator-receptor activated gamma 2 (PPAR\u03b32) adipogenic transcription factor and efficiently differentiate into adipocytes in response to adipogenic differentiation cues (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, ) (<a href=\"#bib73\">Zhao et al., 2013</a>). The myogenic transcriptional program is epigenetically silenced in C3H10T1/2 cells, but it can be activated in response to MyoD expression (<a href=\"#bib43\">Penn et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Tapscott et al., 1988</a>). MyoD stimulates MyoG expression, which then collaborates with MyoD to establish myogenic commitment and repress <i>Ppar\u03b32</i> expression (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>)."

Moreover, <i>Ppar\u03b32</i> expression, which was lost in control cells due to myogenic lineage conversion, was maintained in cells treated with BioE-1197 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 1</a>). In addition, as assessed by immunofluorescence microscopy, the fraction of MyoG<sup>+</sup> cells at either Day 1 or Day 2 of differentiation was markedly decreased by Pask inhibition, while MyoDpositivity was unaffected (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, quantified in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>; <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013B</a>, <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 1</a>). In addition to the loss of MyoG expression, cells treated with BioE-1197 exhibited a profound failure in the formation of multi-nucleated myotubes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). Based on these results, we hypothesized that the differentiation failure of Pask-inhibited cells was not due to failed inactivation of Pax7, which is not expressed in C3H10T1/2 cells, but instead is due to an inability of MyoD to induce MyoG expression in the absence of Pask. Indeed, we found that ectopic expression of rat MyoG was sufficient to bypass the Pask requirement for <i>Mylpf</i> expression even though endogenous mouse <i>Myog</i> remained suppressed in BioE-1197 treated cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>).

We concluded, therefore, that Pask-dependent phosphorylation of one or more specific substrates must be required for the\u00a0myogenic gene expression and differentiation. Since none of the known Pask substrates are likely to serve this role, we sought to identify new substrates that might mediate the effects of Pask on differentiation. We employed a strategy that combines experimental and bioinformatics approaches. Specifically, we identified all proteins that had been described to physically interact with Pask in high-throughput protein-protein interactome datasets (BIOGRID: Pask) and were identified in our own unpublished Pask interactome studies. We then filtered this dataset for proteins that contain the consensus phosphorylation motif for Pask ([HKR]-X-[KR]-X-X-[ST]) that we previously identified (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kikani et al., 2010</a>). Wdr5 was the single candidate substrate protein that emerged, based on its interaction with Pask in our dataset and in a global affinity capture screen (<a href=\"#bib18\">Ewing et al., 2007</a>)."

To properly place the Pask-Wdr5 interaction within these complexes and to determine if Pask associates with any intact Wdr5-containing complexes, we expressed exclusive members of each of the major Wdr5- containing complexes. This included Menin (Mll1/2 complex), PTIP (Mll3/4 complex), GCN5 (Kat2A Histone Acetyltransferase (HAT) complex) and Set9 (Setd7a \u2013 H3K4me3 complex) as well as Rbbp5, which is a member of the core Wdr5 sub-complex that is common to all Mll and Set complexes. Among these, only Wdr5 was able to co-purify endogenous Pask (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), suggesting that Pask is not a stable member of intact Wdr5-containing complexes, but might associate selectively with free Wdr5. Supporting this notion, the interaction between Pask and Wdr5 appears to be direct as GST-tagged Wdr5, purified from bacteria, bound to Pask purified from insect cells (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Furthermore, while overexpressed Pask was cytoplasmic (typically perinuclear) in the majority of cells (<a href=\"#bib52\">Rutter et al., 2001</a>), with only ~10% of cells exhibiting nuclear Pask in absence of Wdr5 co-expression, Wdr5 co-expression with Pask significantly enhanced the nuclear accumulation of Pask (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). To define the minimal region of Pask that is responsible for Wdr5 interaction, we generated a series of N- and C-terminal Pask truncation mutations and assessed their ability to co-purify Wdr5. We found that the N-terminal 914 residues of Pask were dispensable for Wdr5 binding (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). The interaction was lost, however, upon deletion of residues 915\u2013948, suggesting that Wdr5 likely interacts with Pask just upstream of the canonical protein kinase domain."

BioE-1197 also robustly blunted the in situ phosphorylation of Pask and Pask-bound Wdr5 using in-cell <sup>32</sup>P labeling (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). As Pask association with Wdr5 was enhanced at the onset of differentiation, we asked if Pask activity towards Wdr5 is stimulated at this time. Consistent with our previous report (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kikani et al., 2010</a>), Pask exhibits modest activity in the absence of stimulation in C2C12 myoblasts (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>). At 12\u2009hr post-addition of insulin containing differentiation media, however, Pask was activated as assessed by increased autophosphorylation and Wdr5 phosphorylation, thus suggesting that Pask kinase activity is stimulated during differentiation."

That site, with Serine 49 as the putative phospho-acceptor residue, is strikingly similar to that of the best-characterized substrate of yeast Pask, Ugp1 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>), which is also robustly phosphorylated by human Pask (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kikani et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Rutter et al., 2002</a>). In particular, the -5His and -3Lys residues, which were shown to be the most important for determining Pask phosphorylation (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kikani et al., 2010</a>), are present in this putative Wdr5 phosphorylation motif. As expected, we found that Ser49 is required for phosphorylation by Pask since mutation to either glutamate (Glu) or alanine (Ala) nearly abolished phosphorylation in vitro (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H</a>). Pask-associated WT Wdr5 was phosphorylated in cells as shown above, but the S49A mutant showed a marked reduction in <sup>32</sup>P incorporation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4I</a>). Together, these results suggest that Pask interacts with Wdr5 and phosphorylates it at Ser49 both in vitro and in cells."

We found that the association with endogenous Pask is weakened with Wdr5<sup>S49E</sup> and strengthened with Wdr5<sup>S49A</sup> compared with Wdr5<sup>WT</sup>. These data are consistent with the common observation that an unphosphorylated substrate (mimicked by the Ala mutant) engages with its kinase with higher affinity compared to its phosphorylated forms (mimicked by the Glu mutant). When examining components of the Mll1-4, SET1 and KAT2a complexes, we found that Wdr5<sup>WT</sup>, WDR<sup>S49A</sup> and Wdr5<sup>S49E</sup> all bound to each member of these complexes equivalently, suggesting that Wdr5 phosphorylation by Pask does not alter recruitment of Wdr5 into its many chromatin-modifying complexes."

If so, one might expect that expression of a Wdr5 variant that constitutively mimicked the phosphorylated form would reverse the effects of Pask inactivation and rescue the differentiation defect. Indeed, we found that expression of Wdr5<sup>S49E</sup>, but not Wdr5<sup>WT</sup> or Wdr5<sup>S49A</sup>, rescued the morphological features of C2C12 differentiation, including multinucleated myofibers (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

As we observed previously in microscopy experiments, expression of WT, but not KD, hPask completely rescued H3K4me3 occupancy of the <i>Myog</i> promoter (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Moreover, expression of Wdr5<sup>S49E</sup> restored H3K4me3 occupancy, whereas Wdr5<sup>S49A</sup> and Wdr5<sup>WT</sup> had no or modest effects, respectively (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). One potential mechanism whereby Wdr5 phosphorylation might stimulate H3K4me3 occupancy of the <i>Myog</i> promoter is through enhanced Wdr5 promoter recruitment. To test this hypothesis, we performed Flag-Wdr5 ChIP-qPCR analysis on these same samples to determine Flag-Wdr5 occupancy on the <i>Myog</i> promoter. Consistent with that hypothesis, Wdr5<sup>WT</sup> modestly occupied the <i>Myog</i> promoter and this was decreased for the S49A mutant and increased for the S49E mutant (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). Neither WT nor KD Pask occupied the <i>Myog</i> promoter (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>), consistent with our observation that Pask is not a stable member of any Wdr5-containing complexes. We also examined the Pask-dependence of endogenous Wdr5 occupancy of the <i>Myog</i> promoter and found that the increased binding of Wdr5 to the <i>Myog</i> promoter in response to differentiation cues observed in control cells was blunted in Pask-siRNA cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). Wdr5 binding to the <i>Myod</i> promoter, on the other hand, was neither significantly induced upon differentiation, nor was it affected by <i>Pask</i> knockdown (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>), consistent with the observation that Pask is not required for expression of MyoD (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2D\u2013E</a>)."

MyoD is recruited to the <i>Myog</i> promoter during differentiation and then in turn orchestrates the chromatin remodeling process to promote transcriptional activation of <i>Myog</i> (<a href=\"#bib42\">Palacios and Puri, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Rampalli et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Saccone and Puri, 2010</a>). We examined whether Pask plays a role in this process by assessing whether MyoD occupancy on the <i>Myog</i> promoter during differentiation was affected by <i>Pask</i> knockdown. Indeed, we found that <i>Pask</i> knockdown completely blocked the differentiation-stimulated increase in MyoD occupancy of the <i>Myog</i> promoter (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>, <a href=\"#SD5-data\">Figure 6\u2014source data 1</a>). This requirement for Pask is due to Wdr5 phosphorylation as expression of Wdr5<sup>S49E</sup> increased MyoD occupancy of the <i>Myog</i> promoter at Day 1 of differentiation, whereas Wdr5<sup>S49A</sup> blocked it (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G</a>, <a href=\"#SD5-data\">Figure 6\u2014source data 1</a>). Interestingly, Wdr5<sup>S49E</sup> increased the MyoD occupancy of the <i>Myog</i> promoter even in the absence of differentiation cues (Day 0) to a level similar to that found in control cells at Day 1 of differentiation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G</a>, <a href=\"#SD5-data\">Figure 6\u2014source data 1</a>). This result is consistent with our observation that Wdr5<sup>S49E</sup> expression is sufficient to induce MyoG expression in the absence of differentiation cues (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5H</a>). Thus, it appears that Pask and/or phospho-Wdr5 are necessary and sufficient to stimulate the myogenic transcriptional cascade, and perhaps that MyoD occupancy and H3K4me3 modification synergize to maximize expression from the <i>Myog</i> promoter during differentiation."

These marks are converted to H3K4me3 marks in response to differentiation cues through an unknown mechanism (<a href=\"#bib13\">Cheng et al., 2014</a>). Pask is activated by these same differentiation cues and expression of either WT Pask or phospho-mimetic Wdr5 is sufficient to bypass the requirement of differentiation cues. Hence, we asked whether Pask-Wdr5 signaling regulates H3K4me1 to H3K4me3 conversion on the <i>Myog</i> promoter in response to differentiation cues. In control cells, H3K4me1 marks were progressively depleted from the <i>Myog</i> promoter over the differentiation time-course (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>, <a href=\"#SD6-data\">Figure 7\u2014source data 1</a>), most likely due to further methylation to H3K4me3 (see <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). <i>Pask</i> knockdown severely blunted that loss of H3K4me1, in concert with blunting the appearance of H3K4me3 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>, <a href=\"#fig6\">6B</a>). This H3K4me1 to H3K4me3 conversion was accompanied by a decrease in total histone H3 density at the <i>Myog</i> promoter in control cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>), suggestive of a transition from a transcriptionally inactive or closed (nucleosome rich) to a transcriptionally accessible or open (nucleosome depleted) state that might facilitate MyoD recruitment in control cells. This loss of H3 density during differentiation was abolished by <i>Pask</i> knockdown (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>, <a href=\"#SD6-data\">Figure 7\u2014source data 1</a>). Because H3K4me1 is commonly found at enhancers, we also asked whether Pask is required for H3K4me1 occupancy at the <i>Myog</i> enhancer. However, unlike the proximal <i>Myog</i> promoter, H3K4me1 to H3K4me3 conversion at the <i>Myog</i> upstream enhancer is not impaired by <i>Pask</i> knockdown, nor is the appearance of H3K27ac (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Interestingly, MyoD recruitment to the enhancer during differentiation is impaired similarly to the proximal promoter by <i>Pask</i> knockdown, possibly due to the interdependence of the enhancer and promoter for optimal activation (<a href=\"#bib55\">Sanyal et al., 2012</a>). Like <i>Myog,</i> the <i>Mybph</i> and <i>Acta1</i> promoters, but not <i>Myod</i> were reported to undergo H3K4me1 to H3K4me3 conversion during differentiation in C2C12 myoblasts (<a href=\"#bib13\">Cheng et al., 2014</a>) and this is also Pask-dependent (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1C,D</a>)."

Focusing on myoblast differentiation as a powerful and facile model system, we show that Pask phosphorylation of Wdr5 promotes several molecular events that together enable the expression of <i>Myog</i>, which encodes the critical myogenic transcription factor Myogenin. Pask activity or expression of Wdr5<sup>S49E</sup>, which mimics the Pask phosphorylated form of Wdr5, is necessary and sufficient to drive H3K4me1 to H3K4me3 conversion, MyoD recruitment and transcription at the <i>Myog</i> promoter. Based on the data presented herein, we propose a model for C2C12 cells wherein under proliferative conditions, MyoD is unable to bind stably to the <i>Myog</i> promoter due to a repressive chromatin configuration enforced by H3K4me1 marks (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>). As a result, <i>Myog</i> is not expressed and differentiation is prevented. Differentiation cues, including insulin, stimulate Pask kinase activity, Pask-Wdr5 association and Pask phosphorylation of Wdr5 at Ser49. Phosphorylation of Wdr5, which is a component of histone methylation complexes, facilitates the conversion of H3K4me1 to H3K4me3 at the <i>Myog</i> promoter resulting in chromatin remodeling, stable MyoD recruitment, transcription initiation and establishment of the differentiation program. Once this program initiates, it is buttressed by MyoG, likely in collaboration with MyoD, stimulating <i>Pask</i> expression while suppressing <i>Pax7</i> expression (<a href=\"#bib41\">Olguin et al., 2007</a>). This self-reinforcing transcriptional circuit, driven by interlocking positive and negative feedback loops, creates stable commitment to the myogenic cell fate (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>)."

Moreover, we found that myoblasts from <i>Pask<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice had acquired resistance to Pask inhibitor-mediated suppression of myocyte differentiation, indicating that constitutive knockout results in a pro-differentiation compensatory response that is Pask-independent. Similarly, <i>Pask</i>-siRNA or PASK-inhibited cells typically exhibited modest induction of <i>Myog</i>, its target genes and H3K4me3 abundance upon differentiation, suggesting the presence of <i>Pask-</i>independent mechanisms to drive myogenin induction. It\u2019s noteworthy that <i>Pask</i><sup>-/-</sup> myoblasts exhibit elevated expression of <i>Myf5</i> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), which has been shown to be able to compensate for the loss of MyoD function (<a href=\"#bib15\">Conerly et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Rudnicki et al., 1992</a>). Thus, it is possible that Myf5 and other transcriptional regulators drive some of the Pask-independent activation of the <i>Myog</i> promoter.

Utilizing the myoblast differentiation system, we have identified and described Wdr5 as a Pask substrate that mediates these differentiation effects. Wdr5 has been previously implicated in controlling stem cell maintenance. For example, Oct4 associates with Wdr5 and recruits H3K4me3 complexes to its target promoters to induce transcriptional activation and maintenance of pluripotency (<a href=\"#bib2\">Ang et al., 2011</a>). In C2C12 myoblasts, Wdr5 was shown to interact with Pax7 to enforce myogenic specification (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kawabe et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">McKinnell et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Rudnicki et al., 2008</a>). Our results provide a new regulatory role for Wdr5 in promoting differentiation via the expression of key target genes. More importantly, these results define a novel regulatory paradigm wherein the function of Wdr5 is modulated by Pask-dependent phosphorylation. While we deem it likely, it remains to be established whether Wdr5 phosphorylation is a conserved and required mechanism whereby Pask promotes the differentiation of other stem and progenitor cells."

While a pioneering transcription factor like MyoD can occupy its target promoters in a sequence-specific manner, the full activation of the MyoD transcriptional response depends upon signaling from differentiation cues (<a href=\"#bib7\">Berkes and Tapscott, 2005</a>). These cues, including those used in vitro treatment with insulin, are thought to enhance MyoD binding to its target promoters and recruit histone modifying proteins to initiate the expression of differentiation genes (<a href=\"#bib7\">Berkes and Tapscott, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Blum and Dynlacht, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Braun and Gautel, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Dilworth and Blais, 2011</a>).

These data raise the possibility that Pask might be a critical node in the signaling network connecting differentiation cues with myogenic gene expression. Consistent with that hypothesis, we found that Pask activity was stimulated by differentiation cues as was the Pask-Wdr5 interaction (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>). We therefore believe that differentiation cues act, at least in part, to drive the myogenic transcriptional program via Pask activation and phosphorylation of Wdr5. It remains unknown how Pask activity and the Pask-Wdr5 interaction are stimulated by differentiation cues, but we suggest that these phenomena are likely central components of this signaling pathway."

In response to differentiation cues, H3K4me1 is further methylated to H3K4me3 on these promoters to initiate their expression. H3K4 monomethylation is catalyzed by the Wdr5-containing Mll3/Mll4 complexes (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hu et al., 2013</a>), while the Wdr5-containing Mll1/Mll2 complexes catalyze H3K4 trimethylation (<a href=\"#bib61\">Shilatifard, 2012</a>). Thus, it has been predicted that differentiation cues promote a Mll3/Mll4 to Mll1/Mll2 switch on myogenic promoters via an unknown mechanism (<a href=\"#bib13\">Cheng et al., 2014</a>). We speculate that Pask phosphorylation of Wdr5 might be required for this process. For example, Pask silencing prevented the H3K4me1 to H3K4me3 conversion on the <i>Myog</i> promoter in response to differentiation cues and silencing of Mll3 rescued the defect in the induction of <i>Myog</i> expression caused by <i>Pask</i> silencing. Interestingly, H3K4me1 and H3K4me3 was unaffected at the <i>Myod</i> promoter or at the <i>Myod</i> and <i>Myog</i> enhancers during differentiation in <i>Pask</i>-silenced condition. This suggests that Pask and Wdr5 phosphorylation are not required for the enzymatic activity of the Mll1/2 or Mll3/4 complexes, but only for their activity on specific promoters like <i>Myog, Acta1</i> and <i>Mybph</i>. These promoters are repressed during proliferation and required to be derepressed at the onset of differentiation. Our data suggest that Pask mediates chromatin remodeling including H3K4me1 to H3K4me3 conversion, resulting in enhanced MyoD binding and transcriptional activation during differentiation via Wdr5 phosphorylation. Future studies will determine whether Pask-mediated Wdr5 phosphorylation promotes switching of the Mll3/4 and Mll1/2 complexes at the <i>Myog</i> promoter."

Because the myocyte differentiation epigenetic program is similar to those found in other differentiation paradigms, including those we show to be Pask dependent, we speculate Pask likely functions through similar mechanisms in other systems. Specifically, we suggest that Pask phosphorylates Wdr5 to promote H3K4me1 to H3K4me3 conversion on the promoters of lineage-specifying genes to facilitate chromatin remodeling, gene expression and differentiation. As a known component of hormonal and nutrient signaling pathways, future studies of Pask functions in stem cells have the promise of opening exciting new avenues that combine metabolic signaling and stem cell fate determination with the control of terminal differentiation."

The data are thorough, comprehensive and the approach elegant and convincing. The data provide a significant step forward in understanding commitment to terminal differentiation and will have a major impact on research in skeletal muscle.

In C2C12 myoblasts, Wdr5 silencing resulted in stunted cell proliferation (<a href=\"#fig8\">Author response image 1</a>). When myoblasts were induced to differentiate, control myoblasts efficiently differentiated, however, Wdr5 silenced myoblasts failed to form multi-nucleated myofibers (<a href=\"#fig9\">Author response image 2</a>)and induce myogenin and MHC- two markers of differentiation we have used in this manuscript (<a href=\"#fig10\">Author response image 3</a>). More important for this question, we did not see any myogenin or MHC expression at Day 0 (in proliferative condition) when Wdr5 was silent. Thus, at least in myoblasts in our hands, Wdr5 knockdown is not sufficient to cause exit from self-renewal and differentiation. Our data show that Wdr5 is required for both the proliferative phase and differentiation process in myoblasts. This is not surprising since Wdr5 is an essential intermediate in many transcriptional events during both proliferation and differentiation states. For example, in myoblasts, Wdr5 has been shown to associate with Pax7 and regulate myoblast proliferation. During differentiation, MyoD and other transcription factors are known to recruit MLL, KAT2A-B and Set complexes of which Wdr5 is a core member to the <i>Myog</i> promoter to promote differentiation. We have included the data here, but have not included it in the manuscript per se, because it seemed a bit tangential to the logic of the already complex story. At the discretion of the editor and reviewers, we could include it in the paper."

                    "text": "This is a very interesting mechanistic question. While the interplay between MyoD and pWdr5 is an important and complex area, we have tried to address this question partially here. MyoD is extensively involved in remodeling of the <i>Myog</i> promoter at the onset of differentiation by recruiting MLL complexes, HATs and SWI/SNF complexes. MyoD serves a pioneering function at the <i>Myog</i> promoter to activate its transcription in response to differentiation signaling (Cao et al., 2006). While MyoD occupies <i>Myog</i> promoter during the proliferative phase, signaling inputs are required to stimulate chromatin remodeling and activation of MyoG transcription (Cao et al., 2006). On the other hand, inhibition of MyoD aborts the differentiation process. Thus, we hypothesize that MyoD acts synergistically with signaling inputs such as those that activate the PASK-Wdr5 pathway to remodel <i>Myog</i> promoter. We tested this by examining levels of H3K4me3 on the <i>Myog</i> promoter in control or <i>Myod1</i>- silenced C2C12 before and after the onset of differentiation. This was done in cells expressing WT, S49A and S49E Wdr5 as a surrogate for activation or inactivation of PASK signaling (<a href=\"#fig12\">Author response image 5</a>). We observed that knockdown of <i>Myod1</i> partially prevented H3K4me3 induction on the <i>Myog</i> promoter in all samples, including Wdr5<sub>S49E</sub>. We also examined the effect of <i>Myod1</i> knockdown on differentiation in Wdr5 WT, S49A or S49E cells. Again, we noticed that in non-targeting siRNA (Control) samples, Wdr5<sub>S49E</sub> expressing cells made robust myofibers and Wdr5<sub>S49A</sub> expressing cells were defective in myotube formation (<a href=\"#fig13\">Author response image 6</a>). <i>Myod1</i> knockdown, however, significantly suppressed myotube formation in Wdr5<sub>S49E</sub> expressing cells. Hence, we think that Wdr5 phosphorylation is not sufficient to overcome the loss of MyoD function and that MyoD acts synergistically with phosphorylated WDR5 to induce epigenetic changes at the <i>Myog</i> promoter."
