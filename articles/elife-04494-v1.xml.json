Patients with mutations in <i>HOIL1</i> (<i>RBCK1</i>) present with amylopectinosis-associated myopathy with or without hyper-inflammation and immunodeficiency. We report that barrier-raised HOIL-1-deficient mice exhibit amylopectin-like deposits in the myocardium but show minimal signs of hyper-inflammation. However, they show immunodeficiency upon acute infection with <i>Listeria monocytogenes</i>, <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> or <i>Citrobacter rodentium</i>. Increased susceptibility to <i>Listeria</i> was due to HOIL-1 function in hematopoietic cells and macrophages in production of protective cytokines. In contrast, HOIL-1-deficient mice showed enhanced control of chronic <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> or murine \u03b3-herpesvirus 68 (MHV68), and these infections conferred a hyper-inflammatory phenotype. Surprisingly, chronic infection with MHV68 complemented the immunodeficiency of HOIL-1, IL-6, Caspase-1 and Caspase-1;Caspase-11-deficient mice following <i>Listeria</i> infection. Thus chronic herpesvirus infection generates signs of auto-inflammation and complements genetic immunodeficiency in mutant mice, highlighting the importance of accounting for the virome in genotype-phenotype studies."

Patients with mutations in <i>HOIL1</i> (<i>RBCK1</i>) present with amylopectinosis-associated myopathy with or without hyper-inflammation and immunodeficiency. We report that barrier-raised HOIL-1-deficient mice exhibit amylopectin-like deposits in the myocardium but show minimal signs of hyper-inflammation. However, they show immunodeficiency upon acute infection with <i>Listeria monocytogenes</i>, <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> or <i>Citrobacter rodentium</i>. Increased susceptibility to <i>Listeria</i> was due to HOIL-1 function in hematopoietic cells and macrophages in production of protective cytokines. In contrast, HOIL-1-deficient mice showed enhanced control of chronic <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> or murine \u03b3-herpesvirus 68 (MHV68), and these infections conferred a hyper-inflammatory phenotype. Surprisingly, chronic infection with MHV68 complemented the immunodeficiency of HOIL-1, IL-6, Caspase-1 and Caspase-1;Caspase-11-deficient mice following <i>Listeria</i> infection. Thus chronic herpesvirus infection generates signs of auto-inflammation and complements genetic immunodeficiency in mutant mice, highlighting the importance of accounting for the virome in genotype-phenotype studies."

These mice, when raised in a clean barrier facility that reduces their exposure to viruses, were severely immunodeficient and died when infected by certain bacteria and parasites, including <i>Listeria monocytogenes.</i> However, they were able to tolerate infections with a herpesvirus or the bacterium that causes tuberculosis. The immunodeficiency to <i>L. monocytogenes</i> was linked to problems producing protective molecules called cytokines, which form a crucial part of the immune response. Unexpectedly, MacDuff et al. found that a chronic herpesvirus infection substantially protected these very immunodeficient animals from infection with <i>Listeria monocytogenes</i>, and the mice were able to efficiently produce protective cytokines."

Macduff et al. suggest that the chronic herpesvirus infection stimulates the immune system, and so allows it to compensate for the lack of cytokine production associated with various immunodeficiencies, including those caused by mutations in the <i>HOIL-1</i> gene. This suggests that the presence of viruses or other long-term infections may be responsible for some of the variability seen in the symptoms of different individuals with the same genetic immunodeficiency. This is an important concept since essentially all humans have life-long chronic infections from various herpesviruses, as well as other viruses that form the human virome."

Recently, HOIL-1/LUBAC was also shown to be important for activation of the NLRP3/ASC inflammasome in macrophages via linear ubiquitination of ASC (<a href=\"#bib22\">Rodgers et al., 2014</a>). These data suggest that HOIL-1 plays multiple roles in inflammation and infection. In mice, SHARPIN deficiency results in auto-inflammation involving multiple organs including the liver, esophagus, lung and, most noticeably, chronic proliferative dermatitis of the skin (<a href=\"#bib27\">Seymour et al., 2007</a>). The development and organization of secondary lymphoid organs and antibody isotype switching are also impaired in these mice (<a href=\"#bib11\">HogenEsch et al., 1999</a>). Loss of HOIP catalytic activity in B cells results in the impaired development of B1 B cells and antibody responses to antigen (<a href=\"#bib25\">Sasaki et al., 2013</a>).

We first found that, in na\u00efve mice, HOIL-1 is essential during infection with <i>Listeria monocytogenes</i>, <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> and <i>Citrobacter rodentium</i> and for efficient induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines that are known to be essential for resistance to lethal infection by hematopoietic cells during <i>Listeria</i> infection. In contrast, HOIL-1 knock-out (KO) mice, with null mutations in the <i>Rbck1</i> gene that encodes HOIL-1, were resistant to infection with murine \u03b3-herpesvirus 68 (MHV68) and <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>. Although HOIL-1 KO mice raised in a barrier facility did not display signs of auto-inflammation, chronic infection with MHV68 or <i>M. tuberculosis</i> resulted in elevated inflammatory cytokines circulating in the serum, similar to that observed in some patients with mutations in <i>RBCK1</i> (<i>HOIL1</i>). Interestingly, latent infection with MHV68 rescued HOIL-1 deficient mice from lethality during <i>Listeria</i> infection and induced high levels of the protective cytokine, interferon-gamma (IFN\u03b3). MHV68 latency also protected IL-6, Caspase-1 and Caspase-1;Caspase-11 deficient mice from <i>Listeria</i>-induced lethality, indicating that the ability of latent infection to complement a genetic immunodeficiency is not restricted to mutation of <i>Hoil-1</i>. These data indicate that chronic infections can modify the clinical presentations of genetic variations, thereby opening a new avenue for the analysis and interpretation of human genotype-phenotype association studies. We speculate that the protective effect of chronic herpesvirus infection is due to the stimulation of the function of the innate immune system in a manner that compensates for deficient early cytokine responses associated with multiple immunodeficiencies."

One patient with HOIL-1-associated immunodeficiency showed signs of recovery from hyper-inflammation after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (<a href=\"#bib4\">Boisson et al., 2012</a>). In mice, reciprocal bone marrow transplantation revealed that expression of HOIL-1 in radiation-sensitive hematopoietic cells was critical for resistance to <i>Listeria</i> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We noted that control mice that received control bone marrow were slightly more susceptible to infection than non-irradiated control mice (compare with <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), suggesting that reconstitution does not fully restore the immune system of a lethally irradiated mouse to that of a non-irradiated animal. Despite this caveat, irradiated wild-type control mice that received HOIL-1 KO bone marrow and were challenged with 10<sup>5</sup> <i>Listeria</i> 8 weeks later succumbed to infection at the same rate as HOIL-1 KO mice that had received HOIL-1 KO bone marrow. HOIL-1 KO mice that received control bone marrow had an increased survival rate, but still succumbed more readily than control mice that received control bone marrow.

Indeed, HOIL-1-deficient mice succumbed to infection at the same rate regardless of the presence or absence of the adaptive immune system (compare <a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1A and 2B</a>). Further, HOIL-1 KO mice immunized with a low dose of <i>Listeria</i> were capable of mounting a protective adaptive response to a high dose secondary challenge with <i>Listeria</i> 28 days later (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

These cytokines are each well recognized to be essential for survival after <i>Listeria</i> infection (<a href=\"#bib36\">Unanue, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Williams et al., 2012</a>) through their role in coordinating activation of NK cells, NKT cell and T cells to produce IFN\u03b3 required for the bactericidal activity of phagocytic cells. Therefore, to further define a role for HOIL-1 in the innate immune system, we determined whether HOIL-1 KO bone marrow-derived macrophages (macrophages herein) produced cytokines in response to <i>Listeria</i> infection with or without IFN\u03b3 treatment. Compared to control cells, HOIL-1 KO macrophages secreted only 50%, 20% and 10% of the expected levels of TNF\u03b1, IL-6 and IL-12p70 protein, respectively (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Consistent with a role for HOIL-1 in the activation of the NF-\u03baB transcription factor following TLR stimulation, <i>Listeria-</i>infected HOIL-1 KO macrophages expressed decreased levels of <i>Tnf</i>, <i>Il6</i> and <i>Il12b</i> mRNA (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). The defects in cytokine transcript levels were of smaller magnitude than the decreases in secreted protein, particularly for <i>Tnf</i>, suggesting that HOIL-1 may also be involved in cytokine translation or secretion. However, HOIL-1 KO macrophages killed <i>Listeria</i> after activation with IFN\u03b3 as effectively as control cells, indicating the selectivity of HOIL-1 effects on macrophage function (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

This reduction in cytokine transcripts could not be explained by a decrease in macrophage numbers (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Surprisingly, <i>Il12b</i> transcript levels were similar in HOIL-1 KO mice, with a significant difference being detected at only 6 hr after infection. Similar decreases in <i>Tnf</i> and <i>Il6</i> mRNA were observed in mice on the <i>Rag1</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> background at 3 hr post-infection, confirming that these differences are due to a defect in innate immunity in the absence of HOIL-1 (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). We also noted that fewer NK cells and neutrophils were present in the peritoneum 6 hr after <i>Listeria</i> infection, suggesting delayed recruitment or proliferation of these cell types (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). These decreases in cytokine production and delayed cell recruitment likely synergize with defects in IL-1\u03b2 and TNF\u03b1 signaling observed by others (<a href=\"#bib30\">Tian et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Haas et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Tokunaga et al., 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib32\">2011</a>) to compromise antibacterial immunity, and may contribute to the impaired induction of <i>Ifng</i> mRNA observed by 12 hr (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>).

To assess the generality of this phenotype we infected HOIL-1 KO mice with murine \u03b3-herpesvirus 68 (MHV68), a genetic relative of the common persistent human herpesviruses, Epstein\u2013Barr virus and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (EBV, KSHV) (<a href=\"#bib1\">Barton et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Speck and Ganem, 2010</a>). HOIL-1 KO mice survived MHV68 infection for at least 3 months. MHV68 replication was unaffected by HOIL-1 deficiency in cultured macrophages, and was suppressed only slightly in vivo (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Despite normal establishment of latency as determined by the number of cells carrying MHV68 genome 28 days after infection (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), the efficiency of MHV68 reactivation from latency in explanted peritoneal cells was significantly impaired (approximately 50-fold, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Similarly, HOIL-1 KO mice failed to succumb to infection with <i>M. tuberculosis</i> over 70 days of infection, and in fact exhibited lower bacterial colony counts in the spleen while counts in the lung were no different than controls (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Thus HOIL-1 KO mice are fully able to control, and may have an enhanced ability to control, specific aspects of acute and chronic MHV68 and <i>M. tuberculosis</i> infection, in striking contrast to the immunodeficiency apparent after infection with <i>Listeria, Toxoplasma</i>, and <i>Citrobacter</i>."

Notably, patients with HOIL-1 deficiency and hyper-inflammation exhibited increased expression of IL-6 and TNF\u03b1 in the serum and increased expression of mRNA for <i>Il6</i> in blood cells (<a href=\"#bib4\">Boisson et al., 2012</a>). We therefore examined the serum of MHV68-infected HOIL-1 KO mice for cytokines essential for resistance to <i>Listeria</i> but deficient in <i>Listeria</i>-infected HOIL-1 KO mice. As previously observed (<a href=\"#bib2\">Barton et al., 2007</a>), latent infection of control mice with MHV68 was associated with an increase in circulating levels of TNF\u03b1, IL-6, IL-12 and IFN\u03b3 compared with uninfected mice (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). In HOIL-1 KO mice, MHV68 latently resulted in small but significant increases in TNF\u03b1, IL-6 and IL-12p70 levels, and a more striking increase in IFN\u03b3 levels compared to latently infected controls. HOIL-1 KO mice chronically infected with <i>M. tuberculosis</i> also exhibited increased expression of both IL-6 and TNF\u03b1 in serum at 70 days post-infection (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Therefore, there is an overlap between cytokines expressed in hyper-inflammatory patients and in chronically-infected HOIL-1 KO mice."

Expression of HOIL-1 was critical in innate, hematopoietic-derived cells during <i>Listeria</i> infection in vivo<i>.</i> The requirement of HOIL-1 for the induction of protective inflammatory cytokines, TNF\u03b1, IL-6 and IL-12, following infection of macrophages with <i>Listeria</i> in vitro is consistent with reports that LUBAC is required for efficient NF-\u03baB activation following TLR engagement (<a href=\"#bib47\">Zak et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Boisson et al., 2012</a>), but not with a recent report that NF-\u03baB activation following stimulation of TLR4 and TNF-R1 on macrophages by LPS and TNF\u03b1, respectively, is unaffected by HOIL-1 deficiency (<a href=\"#bib22\">Rodgers et al., 2014</a>). These apparently conflicting results suggest that HOIL-1 and LUBAC may not only have cell-type specific functions (<a href=\"#bib4\">Boisson et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Rodgers et al., 2014</a>), but also stimulus-specific roles that vary between different cell types. This may be further highlighted by the excessive inflammatory response and enhanced control of MHV68 and <i>M. tuberculosis</i> infection\u2014two pathogens that also infect macrophages\u2014by HOIL-1-deficient mice. It has been proposed that low levels of viral reactivation during MHV68 latency are responsible for the low level of constant immune activation and cytokine production (<a href=\"#bib2\">Barton et al., 2007</a>). It is paradoxical, then, that reactivation is almost undetectable in HOIL-1-deficient animals, and yet their inflammatory response is elevated. Since the negative regulator of NF-\u03baB signaling, A20, binds to linear ubiquitin chains (<a href=\"#bib33\">Tokunaga et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Verhelst et al., 2012</a>), HOIL-1/LUBAC may also be important for recruiting A20 to receptor signaling complexes to turn off signaling. Therefore, receptor signaling may be sustained in cells in HOIL-1 KO mice, resulting in the increase in TNF\u03b1, IL-6 and IL-12, and ultimately IFN\u03b3 protein, observed in the serum of chronically infected mice. Decreased viral reactivation may be the result of this increased IFN\u03b3, the inability of latently infected cells to response to a stimulus of reactivation or a combination thereof."

This might be due to HOIL-1/LUBAC having differential roles in transducing signals from different immune sensors stimulated by different infections. Other possibilities include a differential requirement for the innate immune system to hold the acute infection in check while an adaptive response is being generated, the speed at which the pathogen replicates, the tissues that it damages, and whether pathology during acute infection is mostly immune- or pathogen-derived. Further studies will be required to address these possibilities."

As reported previously (<a href=\"#bib2\">Barton et al., 2007</a>), MHV68 latency was associated with increased basal levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF\u03b1, IL-6, IL-12 and IFN\u03b3 in the serum of wild-type animals, which were further increased in HOIL-1 KO mice. These cytokines appear to increase the activation status of the innate immune system such that their induction following <i>Listeria</i> infection is no longer as important as would be the case in a na\u00efve mouse. Indeed, MHV68 infection did not enhance the transcription of <i>Tnf</i>, and only marginally enhanced the transcription of <i>Il6</i> and <i>Il12b</i> even in control mice following <i>Listeria</i> infection, and did not rescue the defect in <i>Tnf</i> and <i>Il6</i> induction observed in HOIL-1 KO mice. Conversely, transcription of <i>Ifng</i> and the effector molecule, <i>iNOS (</i>encoded by <i>Nos2)</i>, was elevated in cells from latently infected mice and enhanced substantially by both HOIL-1 KO and control animals very rapidly following infection with <i>Listeria</i>. Macrophages require priming with IFN\u03b3 to induce IL-12 in response to <i>Listeria</i> infection. In a latently infected animal, IFN\u03b3 is already present and so IL-12 and additional IFN\u03b3 may be induced more rapidly. Furthermore, as reported previously for wild-type mice (<a href=\"#bib2\">Barton et al., 2007</a>), MHV68 latency enhanced the ability of peritoneal macrophages from control and HOIL-1 KO mice to kill <i>Listeria</i>. Together, these data suggest that the constant presence of low levels of IFN\u03b3 driven by latent virus infection results in an increase in the basal expression levels of downstream effector molecules and the priming of cells for the enhanced immediate killing of <i>Listeria</i> upon infection, as well as for a more rapid further induction of IFN\u03b3 and its effector molecules in response to the bacterial challenge. In this sense, chronic virus infection sets the level of innate immunity to subsequent infection."

Most humans are infected life-long with multiple herpesviruses (<a href=\"#bib40\">Virgin et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Virgin, 2014</a>), and many also carry other chronic or latent infections such as tuberculosis. Importantly, we observed complementation of immunodeficiency to <i>Listeria</i> by chronic herpesvirus infection in four different strains of immunodeficient mice, revealing virus infection as one possible environmental factor that might alter the genotype-phenotype relationship for patients with mutations in immune system genes. HOIL-1 KO mice chronically infected with either a herpesvirus or <i>M. tuberculosis</i> also exhibited increases in some of the same cytokines reported in the serum of HOIL-1 deficient humans. At least three of the HOIL-1 mutant patients were infected with at least one herpesvirus (<a href=\"#bib4\">Boisson et al., 2012</a>), and it is likely that other chronic infections were present. However, in the absence of data regarding the complete infection status of the HOIL-1 mutant patients, the relevance of the mouse studies to the human phenotypes is unclear. Nevertheless, perhaps the presence of the virome, and potentially variations in the virome or other chronic infections between people, confers significant phenotypic variation by complementing mutations in host genes responsible for innate immunity (<a href=\"#bib38\">Virgin, 2014</a>)."

Survival from infection requires a trade-off between alleles that promote or limit inflammation to balance immunity vs immunopathology. We speculate that the virome or other chronic infections hide or enhance the effects of genetic variations in immune responsiveness by complementing chromosomal variations in immune response genes. As the nature of the virome changes in persons growing up in different cultural and economic environments, it is possible that the immunophenotype of the host changes, and the beneficial or deleterious effects of existing genetic variation are unmasked by removal of complementation provided by chronic virus infection. It is also plausible that the striking auto-inflammation observed in humans with a variety of immune defects could be due to even well controlled herpesvirus infection alone or in combination with other chronic infections. Our data suggest that analysis of the metagenome, including the virome, may be of value in linking human phenotype and genotype (<a href=\"#bib38\">Virgin, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Virgin and Todd, 2011</a>).

While we are shown modest decreases in MTB loads in lung and spleen in Hoil knockouts, we are not shown whether MHV68 viral load is affected by Hoil-1 deficiency, but rather that similar levels of latently infected cells are present in the peritoneum, that MHV68 reactivates less efficiently with Hoil-1 deficiency, and that MHV68 results in increased pro-inflammatory cytokine production with hoil deficiency (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>)."

What is the intrinsic mechanism of how latent infection with \u03b368 protects mice from subsequent challenge with <i>listeria</i>? Is it a phenomenon that exists during acute herpesvirus infections? By analogy with human infectious mononucleosis, MHV68-infected mice are likely immune-stimulated by acute herpes virus infections at 28 days post-infection. Does protection from listeriosis persist at later timepoints following MHV68 infection (the situation in most humans with asymptomatic/chronic herpes virus infections), or is it merely a transient phenomenon of acute infection? Since Hoil-1 knockout mice survive for at least 3 months after MHV68 infection, repeating the experiments at that timepoint would add something to the study."

It is also likely that Hoil-1 deficient human patients had additional chronic herpes viral infections, given that EBV, HHV6 and 7 are acquired within the first two years of life for most individuals. Despite these chronic herpes viral infections, they suffer from severe and recurrent bacterial infection. Thus, the results reported in the mouse model, while interesting, do not appear to be broadly applicable to human disease.

For example, macrophages require IFN\u03b3 to make IL-12 in response to <i>Listeria</i> infection. In a latently infected animal, IFN\u03b3 is already present and so IL-12 is induced much more rapidly and IFN\u03b3 is further up regulated faster than in a non-latently infected animal."
