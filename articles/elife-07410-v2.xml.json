In <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>, the onset of centriole formation requires notably the proteins SAS-5 and SAS-6, which have functional equivalents across eukaryotic evolution. Whereas the molecular architecture of SAS-6 and its role in initiating centriole formation are well understood, the mechanisms by which SAS-5 and its relatives function is unclear. Here, we combine biophysical and structural analysis to uncover the architecture of SAS-5 and examine its functional implications in vivo. Our work reveals that two distinct self-associating domains are necessary to form higher-order oligomers of SAS-5: a trimeric coiled coil and a novel globular dimeric <i>Implico</i> domain. Disruption of either domain leads to centriole duplication failure in worm embryos, indicating that large SAS-5 assemblies are necessary for function in vivo."

In <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>, the onset of centriole formation requires notably the proteins SAS-5 and SAS-6, which have functional equivalents across eukaryotic evolution. Whereas the molecular architecture of SAS-6 and its role in initiating centriole formation are well understood, the mechanisms by which SAS-5 and its relatives function is unclear. Here, we combine biophysical and structural analysis to uncover the architecture of SAS-5 and examine its functional implications in vivo. Our work reveals that two distinct self-associating domains are necessary to form higher-order oligomers of SAS-5: a trimeric coiled coil and a novel globular dimeric <i>Implico</i> domain. Disruption of either domain leads to centriole duplication failure in worm embryos, indicating that large SAS-5 assemblies are necessary for function in vivo."

In resting cells, centrioles are usually found near the plasma membrane where they organize the formation of flagella and cilia, whereas in proliferating cells centrioles typically reside adjacent to the nucleus, where they recruit pericentriolar material to form the centrosome, the major microtubule organizing center of animal cells. Centrosomes play a major role in directing cellular architecture during interphase and bipolar spindle assembly during mitosis. Centriole numbers are tightly regulated, with centriole duplication occurring only once per cell cycle, in concert with replication of the genetic material (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib22\">Firat-Karalar and Stearns, 2014</a>). Abnormalities in centriole formation can impair cell signaling and motility owing to defective cilia or flagella, as well as cause spindle positioning defects and genome instability due to aberrations in centrosome numbers and/or sizes. Thus, it is not surprising that centriolar defects are at the root of multiple medical conditions, including primary microcephaly, male sterility and possibly cancer (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib49\">Nigg and Raff, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Arquint et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Chavali et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Godinho and Pellman, 2014</a>; and <a href=\"#bib48\">Nachury, 2014</a>)."

To tackle this problem, we constructed a bacterial expression vector system harboring 13 different solubility-tags, which allowed us to obtain soluble SAS-5<sub>FL</sub> fused to MsyB (<a href=\"#bib76\">Zou et al., 2008</a>) in quantities sufficient for biophysical analysis (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, which shows all recombinant proteins in this study). Characterization of such purified SAS-5<sub>FL</sub> using circular dichroism (CD) revealed the presence of protein aggregates (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A,B</a>), a conclusion also supported by size-exclusion chromatography multi-angle light scattering (SEC-MALS, <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>) and negative-stain electron microscopy (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2D</a>). We sought to locate the motif in SAS-5 that causes aggregation by expressing a series of MsyB-tagged C-terminal truncation constructs, and observed a significant increase in solubility when comparing a construct encompassing residues 2\u2013279 with one containing residues 2\u2013296 (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Secondary structure prediction suggested a \u03b2-strand between residues 282 and 295 (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). Excising this region from untagged SAS-5<sub>FL</sub> (SAS-5<sub>\u0394282\u2013295</sub>) or replacing it with a Gly-Ser-Ala-rich flexible linker of equal length (SAS-5<sub>FLEX</sub>) resulted in proteins with CD spectra characteristic of mainly \u03b1-helical proteins (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). These results suggest that the predicted \u03b2-strand between residues 282\u2013295 of SAS-5 drives formation of large protein aggregates."

Sequence-based prediction suggested the presence of a coiled coil spanning residues 125\u2013180, as well as of three tightly-spaced \u03b1-helices (residues 210\u2013265); these two elements are separated from each other by a presumed disordered linker of \u223c30 residues (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). We expressed both the coiled coil (SAS-5<sub>CC</sub>) and the predicted helical region (SAS-5<sub>Imp</sub> for <i>Implico</i>, see below) and performed CD analysis. SAS-5<sub>CC</sub> displayed a double-minimum spectrum (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>) characteristic of \u03b1-helical coiled coils, and exhibited moderate thermal stability in isolation (apparent melting transition temperature, T<sub>m</sub> \u223c 37\u00b0C, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). In contrast, CD of SAS-5<sub>Imp</sub> revealed a very stable (T<sub>m</sub> \u223c 72\u00b0C) \u03b1-helical domain (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D,E</a>). A SAS-5 construct that combined both the coiled coil and the \u03b1-helical domain (SAS-5<sub>125\u2013265</sub>, residues 125\u2013265) showed CD spectra and a two-step thermal unfolding profile highly similar to that of SAS-5<sub>\u0394282\u2013295</sub> and SAS-5<sub>FLEX</sub> (compare <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F,G</a> with <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a>). We attribute the first melting transition of SAS-5<sub>125\u2013265</sub> (T<sub>m</sub> of \u223c50\u00b0C) to unfolding of the coiled-coil domain and the second (T<sub>m</sub> of \u223c70\u00b0C) to unfolding of the <i>Implico</i> domain. Moreover, CD spectra of isolated SAS-5 N-terminal (residues 2\u2013122) or C-terminal (269\u2013404) fragments showed no persistent secondary structure or cooperative thermal unfolding (<a href=\"#fig1s5\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5</a>), consistent with similar previous analysis of the SAS-5 N-terminus (<a href=\"#bib65\">Shimanovskaya et al., 2013</a>). Overall, these findings led us to conclude that the segment between residues 125\u2013265 contains two independently folded domains and encompasses all structured elements of SAS-5."

Native crystals of SAS-5<sub>CC</sub> diffracted to 1.8 \u00c5 resolution, whilst phases for structure solution were determined by single anomalous dispersion (SAD) using trimethyl lead acetate derivatized crystals (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Tables 1, 2</a>). The structure of SAS-5<sub>CC</sub> suggested a parallel trimeric coiled coil, although this arrangement is distorted by crystal packing that intercalates the ends of successive triple helical bundles (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). To correct for these distortions, we performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations starting from the crystallographic structure of SAS-5<sub>CC</sub>, which rapidly converged to a trimeric coiled-coil structure (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B\u2013D</a>). SEC-MALS analysis of a slightly longer coiled-coil construct (SAS-5<sub>CC-L</sub>, residues 101\u2013206) demonstrated formation of a trimer in solution in a concentration-dependent manner, with apparent K<sub>d</sub> of \u223c3 \u03bcM (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G,H</a>). Both the crystallographic model and MD simulations show a series of hydrophobic residues (W133, M137, L141, I144, I148, L159, M167 and M171) forming the core of the coiled coil and enabling trimer formation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E,F</a>). Interestingly, we found that all these residues are conserved or conservatively substituted in SAS-5 homologs in other <i>Caenorhabditis</i> species, suggesting functional relevance (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). To investigate the stability of the coiled-coil domain across nematode evolution, we expressed constructs corresponding to SAS-5<sub>CC-L</sub> from <i>Caenorhabditis brenneri</i>, <i>Caenorhabditis briggsae</i>, <i>Caenorhabditis remanei</i>,<i> Caenorhabditis</i> <i>sinica</i> and <i>Caenorhabditis</i> <i>tropicalis</i>. In all cases, SEC-MALS analysis showed similar oligomerization properties and apparent affinities as for <i>C. elegans</i> SAS-5<sub>CC-L</sub> (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Taken together, these data suggest that the trimeric coiled coil is an evolutionary conserved feature of nematode SAS-5 proteins."

We found that this newly recognized domain is highly conserved amongst <i>Caenorhabditis</i> species (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Importantly, SEC-MALS experiments revealed that SAS-5<sub>Imp</sub> forms a stable dimer (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Crystals of SAS-5<sub>Imp</sub> diffracted to 1.0 \u00c5 resolution and experimental phases were determined by SAD from mercury acetate derivatized samples (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). The SAS-5<sub>Imp</sub> structure revealed a dimer composed of interlocked chains arranged in an antiparallel fashion (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Each chain features three \u03b1-helices (A1 to A3 and B1 to B3) that interact in a pairwise manner (A1\u2013B3, A2\u2013B2 and A3\u2013B1). Proline residues at the linkers between helices allow for tight 90\u00b0 turns (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>), resulting in a very compact dimer of just \u223c4 nm in diameter. The dimer interface (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>) involves the majority of hydrophobic core residues (I219, I225, A229, L230, I232, I233, L237, F243, I247, V250, L251); thus, breaking the dimer is expected to unfold the SAS-5<sub>Imp</sub> domain. Given the high thermal stability of SAS-5<sub>Imp</sub> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>), this suggests formation of stable dimers even at very low protein concentrations. This interlocked tight dimer is a novel structural feature that we named <i>Implico</i>, from Latin <i>to entangle</i>."

We envision that SAS-5 would readily dimerize even at low concentrations via the <i>Implico</i> domain, as oligomerization of this domain is tighter compared to that of the SAS-5 coiled coil. Such SAS-5 dimers could then come together to form higher-order configurations. To test this possibility, we performed SEC-MALS experiments on MsyB-tagged SAS-5<sub>FLEX</sub>, which revealed concentration-dependent oligomerization of SAS-5 from dimers to an approximately equimolar population of tetramers and hexamers (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>). Analogous results were obtained with a MsyB-tagged SAS-5 construct that lacks the disordered protein C-terminus (SAS-5<sub>2\u2013265</sub>) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,D</a>). Moreover, native mass-spectrometry of SAS-5<sub>2\u2013265</sub> also supported the presence of higher-order protein assemblies up to hexamers in solution (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). Taken together, these data support the notion that the SAS-5 coiled coil promotes the association of protein dimers towards higher-order assemblies. Furthermore, our results are consistent with an earlier SEC-MALS analysis of MBP-tagged SAS-5 constructs of residues 1\u2013260, which showed formation of tetramers at an unspecified protein concentration (<a href=\"#bib65\">Shimanovskaya et al., 2013</a>)."

Substituting an additional core hydrophobic residue of the coiled coil (SAS-5<sub>2\u2013265</sub> L141E/M167E) effectively abrogated coiled coil formation, again with no effect on the <i>Implico</i> domain (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>).

To this end, we generated <i>C. elegans</i> transgenic animals expressing either GFP-SAS-5 (wild-type), or GFP-SAS-5 L141E or GFP-SAS-5 I247E mutant versions. All exons of the <i>sas-5</i> sequence were recoded in the transgenic constructs to confer resistance to RNAi directed against endogenous <i>sas-5</i>. Worms were subjected to <i>sas-5</i> RNAi and the resulting embryos analyzed by time-lapse differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy as a means to assay centriole formation. In wild-type embryos (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a> and <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>), the sperm contributes the sole pair of centrioles to the newly fertilized embryo. Following the first round of centriole duplication in the zygote, the two centrosomes, now each with a pair of centrioles, direct assembly of a bipolar spindle during the first mitotic division. At the two-cell stage, centrioles separate and duplicate, leading to bipolar spindle assembly in each blastomere and resulting in a signature 4-cell stage configuration following mitotic exit (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a> and <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). In <i>sas-5</i>(<i>RNAi</i>) embryos, the sperm, which is not affected by RNAi under these experimental conditions, contributes two normal centrioles to the zygote; these paternally contributed centrioles each recruit pericentriolar material and direct bipolar spindle assembly during the first mitotic division (<a href=\"#bib17\">Delattre et al., 2004</a>). However, due to depletion of the maternal pool of SAS-5, centriole duplication does not occur, leading to monopolar spindle assembly in each blastomere at the second cell cycle (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>, <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). As a result, a four-cell configuration is never observed in <i>sas-5</i>(<i>RNAi</i>) embryos (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>)."

Rescue of endogenous <i>sas-5</i> depletion upon dual RNAi treatment depended on the level of exogenous GFP-SAS-5 expression. Importantly, note that levels of GFP-SAS-5 below those of either of the GFP-SAS-5 mutants, reduced using <i>gfp</i> RNAi, were able to rescue the <i>sas-5</i> (<i>RNAi</i>) phenotype, indicating that the lack of rescue in the latter two strains is not due to insufficient expression levels. To rule out the possibility of <i>sas-5 (RNAi)</i> rescue being due to dilution of the <i>sas-5</i> RNAi with <i>gfp</i> RNAi, embryos expressing GFP-SAS-5 L141E were scored under the same conditions, with all embryos showing the <i>sas-5 (RNAi)</i> phenotype (data not shown) Furthermore, GFP-SAS-5 levels at only \u223c5% of the levels in the <i>sas-5 (RNAi)</i> condition, failed to rescue, further indicating that <i>sas-5 (RNAi)</i> is functional under these conditions. (<b>H</b>) Western blots of 50 adult worms from each indicated strain probed with antibodies against SAS-5 or GFP, as indicated, and against \u03b1-tubulin as loading control. Molecular weight markers are indicated as black dashes. Endogenous SAS-5 exists as two isoforms: the long 404 amino acid isoform and a shorter 288 amino acid isoform, which is likely the result of trans-splicing (Wormbase, F35B12.5c). Note that exogenous <i>gfp::sas-5</i> results in the expression of the longer isoform only."

Importantly, using time-lapse DIC microscopy to analyze the three transgenic lines generated in this study, we found that expression of GFP-SAS-5 fully rescued the <i>sas-5(RNAi)</i> phenotype, allowing all analyzed embryos to progress to the 4-cell stage (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a> and <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>), as in untreated wild-type embryos. In stark contrast, GFP-SAS-5 mutants that disrupt either the coiled coil (L141E) or the <i>Implico</i> oligomerization domain (I247E) were unable to rescue the <i>sas-5</i>(<i>RNAi</i>) phenotype, such that all embryos underwent monopolar spindle assembly in each blastomere at the second cell cycle and thus failed to result in a 4-cell configuration (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D,E</a>, and <a href=\"#media4\">Videos 4, 5</a>). We conclude that both SAS-5 oligomerization interfaces, and hence formation of SAS-5 assemblies larger than merely dimers or trimers, are essential for SAS-5 function in vivo."

Whereas GFP-SAS-5 was observed in foci at centrosomes (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), foci were not seen for either of the oligomerization mutant versions (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1C,D</a>). In order to investigate the localization of the fusion proteins using a more sensitive approach, we analyzed fixed one-cell stage embryos by immunofluorescence with antibodies against GFP and the centriolar marker IFA (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F\u2013H</a>). We found that whereas GFP-SAS-5 is enriched at centrioles (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F,I</a> and <a href=\"#bib17\">Delattre et al., 2004</a>), as was also observed by live imaging, the situation differed for both oligomerization interface mutants. In the case of GFP-SAS-5 L141E, only \u223c30% of centrosomes exhibited a clear GFP focus, with the remaining centrosomes exhibiting either no GFP focus, or only a weak focus (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G,I</a>). In the case of GFP-SAS-5 I247E, the vast majority of embryos exhibited no detectable GFP focus at centrioles (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6H,I</a>). We conclude that SAS-5 oligomerization is important for centriole localization, with the <i>Implico</i> domain playing a particularly critical role in this respect. Moreover, the presence of GFP-SAS-5 L141E at centrioles in one third of embryos, combined with the fact that this mutant completely failed to rescue the phenotype, raises the possibility that formation of higher-order SAS-5 assemblies is essential for function even if centriolar localization has been achieved."

Previous biophysical analysis of the SAS-5/SAS-6 interaction was performed using relatively short C-terminal SAS-5 peptides (<a href=\"#bib60\">Qiao et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Hilbert et al., 2013</a>), as full-length SAS-5 proved difficult to purify. Our results show that SAS-5 aggregates in vitro due to a \u223c20 amino acid segment that may form a \u03b2-strand (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>); this site is outside the SAS-5 region implicated in SAS-6 binding (<a href=\"#bib60\">Qiao et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Hilbert et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Lettman et al., 2013</a>). Although we cannot exclude the possibility that SAS-5 multimerization through this predicted \u03b2-strand is physiologically relevant, we do not favor such interpretation. The aggregates formed by full-length SAS-5, as visualized by EM, are proportional in size to <i>C. elegans</i> centrioles even at very low protein concentrations (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2D</a>). Thus, if present in vivo, the large size of such aggregates would leave little, if any, space for other centriolar components, including SAS-6, SAS-4 and microtubules. Rather, we postulate that in vivo SAS-5 forms a complex with a yet unidentified partner using the \u223c20 amino acid segment identified here, and that this complex protects SAS-5 from aggregation in the cell. It is intriguing to speculate whether Protein Phosphatase 2A, which binds SAS-5 in vivo and controls SAS-5 levels (<a href=\"#bib68\">Song et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Kitagawa et al., 2011a</a>), may interact with SAS-5 in this region."

                        "text": "Structural and biophysical analysis suggests that SAS-5 can form tight dimers through its <i>Implico</i> domain, a novel dimerization interface with no known homologs outside SAS-5 proteins (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). These dimers cannot be disrupted even when diluting the protein to concentrations as low as 20 nM (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013D</a>). By comparison, the dimer mediated by the SAS-6 coiled coil is approximately 50-times weaker (<a href=\"#bib39\">Kitagawa et al., 2011b</a>), yet the human orthologue HsSAS-6 readily forms dimers in cells (<a href=\"#bib35\">Keller et al., 2014</a>). By extension, it appears reasonable to assume that SAS-5 forms dimers in the cytoplasm of <i>C. elegans</i> embryos. Such dimers would associate with SAS-6 (<a href=\"#bib17\">Delattre et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Qiao et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Hilbert et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Lettman et al., 2013</a>) and possibly SAS-4 (<a href=\"#bib14a\">Cottee et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Hatzopoulos et al., 2013</a>), given the moderate interaction strengths of these associations. Our work shows that formation of these tight SAS-5 dimers through the <i>Implico</i> domain is necessary for SAS-5 localization to centrioles (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6H,I</a>). This suggests that the localization mechanism either recognizes the <i>Implico</i> domain itself, or depends on a protein association that needs two copies of a distinct SAS-5 epitope, and hence the SAS-5 dimer. Multivalent protein interactions increase the apparent strength (avidity) of association, and are common in biology (<a href=\"#bib46\">Mammen et al., 1998</a>). It is possible that the interaction of SAS-5 with SAS-6, known to be necessary for localization of both proteins to centrioles (<a href=\"#bib17\">Delattre et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Qiao et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Lettman et al., 2013</a>), benefits from such an avidity effect. It will be interesting to determine whether the L141E and I247E SAS-5 mutants prevent SAS-6 recruitment to the nascent centriole assembly site or rather prevent SAS-6 from being organized properly thereafter. In either case, this would likely hinder downstream recruitment of SAS-4, and therefore centriole formation (<a href=\"#bib15\">Dammermann et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Delattre et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Qiao et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Lettman et al., 2013</a>)."

Our SEC-MALS results show that SAS-5 forms tetramers already at 1 \u03bcM concentration and a mixture of tetramers and hexamers at 10 \u03bcM (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Although the SAS-5 architecture, with two independent oligomerization interfaces, could theoretically sustain the formation of open-ended protein chains or networks, we believe it is more likely that higher-order SAS-5 assemblies cap at a hexameric size. Such hexamers, formed through the sequential association of three SAS-5 dimers (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>), should be both kinetically and entropically favored compared to open-ended SAS-5 chains. Hexamer breakdown would require simultaneous disruption of two SAS-5 coiled coils, a rarer event compared to the disruption of a single coiled coil in an open-ended SAS-5 oligomer. Further, in the sequential assembly model of <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>, once the first coiled-coil sequence of a SAS-5 dimer has associated into a folded coiled-coil structure, the degrees of freedom of the second SAS-5 coiled-coil sequence would be reduced, and thus its association into the second folded coiled-coil structure would become entropically favored."

Although some GFP-SAS-5 L141E may be provided from centrioles contributed by the sperm where endogenous SAS-5 is present, we anticipate that any paternal SAS-5 will rapidly exchange with the much larger maternal protein pool (<a href=\"#bib17\">Delattre et al., 2004</a>). Thus, we expect that GFP-SAS-5 L141E visualized at centrioles (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G,I</a>) is the maternal protein localized there."

However, FRAP experiments show rapid shuttling of SAS-5 between centrioles and the cytoplasm (<a href=\"#bib17\">Delattre et al., 2004</a>), which seemingly conflicts with such a postulated structural role.

SAS-5 assemblies could bind multiple SAS-6 dimers and bring them together in a confined space (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). ZYG-1, which interacts with SAS-6 independently of SAS-5 and is also located at the duplication site (<a href=\"#bib44\">Lettman et al., 2013</a>), may provide additional enhancement of local SAS-6 concentration. As the interaction affinity for the assembly of SAS-6 oligomers is weak (K<sub>d</sub> \u223c 100 \u03bcM, [<a href=\"#bib39\">Kitagawa et al., 2011b</a>]) this increase in local SAS-6 concentration may provide a trigger for SAS-6 oligomerisation. Furthermore, if SAS-5 forms defined hexamers as argued above, these hexamers could recruit up to six SAS-6 dimers (<a href=\"#bib60\">Qiao et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Hilbert et al., 2013</a>) at the initiation site of SAS-6 oligomerisation. This number of SAS-6 moieties would be sufficient for just over one turn of the proposed SAS-6 spiral (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hilbert et al., 2013</a>), but not for a SAS-6 ring (<a href=\"#bib39\">Kitagawa et al., 2011b</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Van Breugel et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Van Breugel et al., 2014</a>). Thus, a hexameric SAS-5 architecture would provide an initial structural guide for the configuration of the SAS-6 oligomer.

However, the specific structural features of SAS-5 are likely restricted to close homologs of this protein, as we were unable to identify sequences homologous to the SAS-5 coiled-coil and <i>Implico</i> domains in either STIL or Ana2. Further, no SAS-5 homolog has been identified in <i>Trichinella spiralis</i>, a nematode that may feature SAS-6 cartwheels, rather than spirals, at its centrioles (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hilbert et al., 2013</a>).

Both Ana2 and STIL tetramerize through their coiled-coil domains. It remains to be determined whether the different SAS-5 and Ana2/STIL architectures reflect a divergence in centriole architecture between these organisms."

Formation of defined SAS-5 hexamers is thus a conjecture, and as such we have moved their mention from the Results section to the Discussion of the revised manuscript.

Firstly and primarily, SAS-5 oligomers could bind multiple SAS-6 dimers, bringing them close together in space and thereby increasing the SAS-6 local concentration. This type of avidity effect is very likely necessary for SAS-6 oligomerisation, as the self-assembly interaction strength of this protein is weak (K<sub>d</sub> \u223c100 \u03bcM, see Kitagawa et al. Cell, 2011). In addition to the mechanism above, if SAS-5 oligomers do not readily exceed the tetrameric/hexameric states seen in solution, this would imply a close approach of up to four or six SAS-6 dimers per SAS-5 oligomer. This number of SAS-6 moieties would be sufficient for a turn of the SAS-6 spiral to form (4.5 SAS-6 dimers/turn), but not for a complete SAS-6 ring (9 SAS-6 dimers/ring). In the revised discussion we present this line of thought more clearly, but also stress that it is simply a hypothesis."

In both <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2013figure supplement 2</a>, the SAS-5 coiled coils can be clearly seen to be capped at the trimer size over the last two / three data series (typically from an on-column concentration of 60 \u03bcM and higher). We believe this is a strong argument for the trimeric nature of this coiled coil; the MD analysis was performed to \u201cundo\u201d the crystal packing distortions of the coiled coil, rather than to prove its trimerisation. Finally, the broad black peaks of <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a> (and similar ones in <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2013figure supplement 2</a>) are the result of overloading the size exclusion column with protein in our last one or two data series. In these cases the broadness of the SEC-MALS peak does not represent protein equilibria, as the reviewers suggest, but simply a protein overload. For example, the protein on-column concentration over the flat MW section of the broad peak in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a> is always in excess of 30 \u03bcM, as calculated from the differential refractive index.

This is especially valuable when comparing wild-type and mutant proteins, as in <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2013figure supplement 1</a>, where CD deconvolution can assist readers with less expertise in interpreting the raw CD data. Thus, we would prefer not to remove the CD deconvolution bars from the figures, but we rather explicitly state in figure legends that this type of analysis is semi-quantitative."

The strong centriole/cell division phenotype seen in the L141E and I247E mutants might be due to the fact that not enough SAS-6 is recruited to the nascent daughter centriole, rather than SAS-6 not being organized properly once delivered there.

Unfortunately, however, an immunofluorescence experiment using antibodies directed against SAS-6 cannot ascertain whether or not SAS-6 is recruited in the L141E and I247E mutant conditions. Indeed, SAS-6 at centrioles inherited from sperm is extremely stable, as recently reported (PMID 25906994). Moreover, due to the minute size of centrioles in <i>C. elegans</i>, the nascent centriole in one-cell stage embryos cannot be resolved by confocal microscopy from the paternally contributed centrioles. Thus, two SAS-6 foci are observed in both wild type and <i>sas-5(RNAi)</i> one-cell stage embryos. Therefore, discriminating between a scenario in which the protein is not recruited at all from one in which it is recruited initially but not organized properly thereafter in the mutant conditions is not possible by this means. An alternative that could be envisaged would be to use a transgenic line expressing a detectable fusion protein between SAS-6 and a fluorescent protein other than GFP (e.g. mCherry-SAS-6), but this is not available. In the absence of such experiments, we now indicate the possibility mentioned by the reviewers in the revised manuscript (paragraph two, Discussion section)."
