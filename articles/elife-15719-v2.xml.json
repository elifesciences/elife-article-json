Yet, little is known about the organization of the single neuron network or its relationship to the synchronization processes that are essential for its formation. Here, we show that the functional single neuron network of three fronto-parietal areas during active behavior of macaque monkeys is highly complex. The network was closely connected (small-world) and consisted of functional modules spanning these areas. Surprisingly, the importance of different neurons to the network was highly heterogeneous with a small number of neurons contributing strongly to the network function (hubs), which were in turn strongly inter-connected (rich-club). Examination of the network synchronization revealed that the identified rich-club consisted of neurons that were synchronized in the beta or low frequency range, whereas other neurons were mostly non-oscillatory synchronized. Therefore, oscillatory synchrony may be a central communication mechanism for highly organized functional spiking networks."

Authorization for conducting this study has been granted by the regional government office, the Animal Welfare Division of the Office for Consumer Protection and Food Safety of the State of Lower Saxony, Germany (permit no. 032/09). Monkey handling also followed the recommendations of the Weatherall Report of good animal practice. Animals were pairhoused in a spacious cage (well exceeding legal requirements) and were maintained on a 12-hour on/off lighting schedule. Housing procedures included an environmental enrichment program with access to toys, swings, and hidden treats (e.g., seeds in sawdust). Monkeys had visual and auditory contact to other monkeys. They were fed on a diet of enriched biscuits and fruits. Daily access to fluids was controlled during training and experimental periods to promote behavioral motivation. All surgical procedures were performed under anesthesia, and all efforts were made to minimize post-surgical pain or suffering. Institutional veterinarians continually monitored animal health and well-being."

Yet, little is known about the organization of the single neuron network or its relationship to the synchronization processes that are essential for its formation. Here, we show that the functional single neuron network of three fronto-parietal areas during active behavior of macaque monkeys is highly complex. The network was closely connected (small-world) and consisted of functional modules spanning these areas. Surprisingly, the importance of different neurons to the network was highly heterogeneous with a small number of neurons contributing strongly to the network function (hubs), which were in turn strongly inter-connected (rich-club). Examination of the network synchronization revealed that the identified rich-club consisted of neurons that were synchronized in the beta or low frequency range, whereas other neurons were mostly non-oscillatory synchronized. Therefore, oscillatory synchrony may be a central communication mechanism for highly organized functional spiking networks."

Authorization for conducting this study has been granted by the regional government office, the Animal Welfare Division of the Office for Consumer Protection and Food Safety of the State of Lower Saxony, Germany (permit no. 032/09). Monkey handling also followed the recommendations of the Weatherall Report of good animal practice. Animals were pairhoused in a spacious cage (well exceeding legal requirements) and were maintained on a 12-hour on/off lighting schedule. Housing procedures included an environmental enrichment program with access to toys, swings, and hidden treats (e.g., seeds in sawdust). Monkeys had visual and auditory contact to other monkeys. They were fed on a diet of enriched biscuits and fruits. Daily access to fluids was controlled during training and experimental periods to promote behavioral motivation. All surgical procedures were performed under anesthesia, and all efforts were made to minimize post-surgical pain or suffering. Institutional veterinarians continually monitored animal health and well-being."

In order to understand the basis of these processes, especially in highly complex networks such as the primate brain, it is essential to know their network structure, termed topology. Graph theoretical approaches have enabled analysis of the brain\u2019s network topology (<a href=\"#bib65\">Watts and Strogatz, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Bullmore and Sporns, 2009</a>). Using such approaches in EEG, MEG, DTI or fMRI studies, anatomical regions have been grouped into functional and anatomically strongly connected modules, which are segregated from each other (<a href=\"#bib11\">Bullmore and Sporns, 2009</a>). Still, every region can be reached by bypassing a few others (small-world), a topology which is robust and allows efficient information processing (<a href=\"#bib30\">Hilgetag et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Stephan et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Bullmore and Sporns, 2009</a>). A few regions of the brain are highly connected and centrally located within the network (<a href=\"#bib60\">van den Heuvel and Sporns, 2013a</a>) (hubs) as well as strongly connected to each other (<a href=\"#bib59\">van den Heuvel et al., 2012</a>) (rich-club). This rich-club forms a global communication pathway across the network, thereby cross-linking segregated modules (<a href=\"#bib61\">van den Heuvel and Sporns, 2013b</a>)."

While neuronal modules, hubs, and rich-club organization have been shown in organotypic slices of rats (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bonifazi et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Shimono and Beggs, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Schroeter et al., 2015</a>), hardly anything is known about single neuron network topology in the intact brain during behavior. Limitations in recording high number of single neurons in parallel, incorporating distance-dependent connectivity, and addressing subsampling and firing rate biases makes it difficult to assess these networks. Only small-world topology has been debated (<a href=\"#bib67\">Yu et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Gerhard et al., 2011</a>) and rich-club topology has been shown recently in mice (<a href=\"#bib44\">Nigam et al., 2016</a>)."

Previous research has revealed oscillatory synchrony in time as a crucial feature of functional coordination (<a href=\"#bib20\">Fries, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Buzs\u00e1ki and Wang, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Womelsdorf et al., 2014</a>). Different distinct frequency bands for information transmission and functional network coordination have been identified, such as gamma (40\u2013100\u00a0Hz) and theta (4\u20138 Hz) in the visual areas and up to frontal cortex for coordinated attention selection (<a href=\"#bib50\">Roelfsema et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Bosman et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Gregoriou et al., 2012</a>), and beta (18\u201335\u00a0Hz) and delta (1\u20134 Hz) in fronto-parietal regions for network coordination during decision and working memory processes (<a href=\"#bib10\">Brovelli et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Pesaran et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Haegens et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Salazar et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">N\u00e1cher et al., 2013</a>). Recently, gamma and theta oscillations have been proposed as feedforward communication frequencies across large parts of the visual network, while beta oscillations have been proposed for feedback communication (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bastos et al., 2015</a>). However, firing rate correlations have also been found, independent of oscillatory synchronization, to be of importance for communication in the behaving brain (<a href=\"#bib21\">Fujisawa et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Smith and Kohn, 2008</a>). Yet, how functional network topology, described by graph theoretical approaches, relates to oscillatory and non-oscillatory synchronization remains unclear. This question must be answered at the level of single neurons, where oscillatory synchrony can be distinguished from non-oscillatory synchrony."

Across the three cortical areas we found modular, small-world topology with a clear presence of hubs that were organized as a rich-club. Moreover, rich-club hub neurons predominantly spiked and communicated by oscillatory synchrony in the beta and low frequency range, while the remainder of the network predominately communicated by non-oscillatory synchrony, suggesting that oscillatory synchrony is a central coordination mechanism for functional network topology."

It is important to stress that the functional connections we describe here do not necessarily represent monosynaptic connections, but merely the influence of one unit onto another. For each neuron pairing one single CCH was estimated over all task epochs and grasp types, since we were interested in the general network interaction and not grasp type or time specific modulations of the network. A general problem of all connectivity measures is common drive to the network, such as stimulus- or movement-locked, but not pairwise, correlations, causing an overestimations of connections. We corrected these biases by subtracting surrogate CCHs (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>)."

Interestingly, the maximum peak or trough time lag distribution showed an exponential decay, with most of the peaks or troughs having a very short time lag (45.67% &lt; 10\u00a0ms, and 85.12% &lt; 100\u00a0ms), indicating predominantly direct influences of the units on each other. In case of oscillatory synchronized single units, as strongly present in the data, the classification of the maximum peak or trough time lags was more complex. Given that the maximum peak or trough time lag could be greater than half a cycle of the underlying frequency, it became unclear which unit is leading and which lagging, due to the presence of side lobes (e.g., see <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a> top panel). Since we found high numbers of oscillatory synchronized single units, predominantly in the beta (20\u00a0Hz) and in the low frequency range (4\u00a0Hz), as described in detail below, we analyzed the distribution of maximum peaks or troughs phase with respect to the underlying oscillatory frequency (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4B</a>), and also found an exponential decay, similar to the maximum time lag peak or trough distribution. The majority of phase lags were within half a cycle around the zero time lag for both frequencies (beta connections: 77.70% &lt; \u03c0, low frequency connections: 87.66% &lt; \u03c0), suggesting that for most oscillatory synchronized connections we could accurately determine which unit was leading and which unit was lagging."

Each circle represents a single neuron and is scaled based on the degree of connectivity. VOS aims to find locations in a low-dimensional space (in this case 2D) in such a way that the distance between each node reflects the similarity between these nodes. Similarity is typically found by calculating the association strength (also known as proximity index) on the co-occurrence matrix of items, which is in this case the weighted network connectivity matrix. Association strength is simply the co-occurrence of two items divided by the product of the number of occurrences of each item. The location of each node is then found by minimizing the sum of the squared distance between all nodes, weighted by the computed similarity between each node. To avoid trivial solutions in which all nodes are assigned the same location, there is an additional constraint that the average distance between all pairs of items must be equal to one. Mathematically, VOS bares much similarity to the method of multi-dimensional scaling (<a href=\"#bib62\">Van Eck et al., 2010</a>). All implementations of VOS were performed using the freely available software, Pajek (<a href=\"http://mrvar.fdv.uni-lj.si/pajek/\">http://mrvar.fdv.uni-lj.si/pajek/</a>), and then plotted in Matlab."

Similar to degree centrality, the betweenness centrality distribution (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>) was heavy-tailed and best described by a PL model, with an estimated exponent of \u03b3 = 2.212 (PL: adjusted R<sup>2</sup> = 0.9753; EXPTPL: adjusted R<sup>2</sup> = 0.9745; EXP: adjusted R<sup>2</sup> = 0.9593; GAUS: adjusted R<sup>2</sup> = \u22120.1509). The betweenness centrality distribution of surrogate networks was also heavy-tailed and was best described by an EXPTPL model (EXPTPL: adjusted R<sup>2</sup> = 0.99; PL: adjusted R<sup>2</sup> = 0.9771; EXP: adjusted R<sup>2</sup> = 0.9061; GAUS: R<sup>2</sup> = \u22120.5511). Still, in contrast to the PL model, the EXPTPL model had smaller values in the high and low betweenness centrality range. Statistically networks showed a significantly higher number of single units in the low and fewer units in the intermediate betweenness range than surrogate networks (cluster-based permutation test, p&lt;0.05). These findings confirm the presence of hub neurons for betweenness centrality. Units with high degree centrality also tended to have high betweenness centrality (r = 0.75, p&lt;0.001, Spearman correlation), suggesting a coherent group of hub units. We found no significant differences in number of hubs per area (normalized k \u2265 9, g \u2265 0.03; Tukey's honest significant difference test on average group ranks, p&lt;0.05), indicating a distributed hub topology with no area acting as a network center. Together, we have shown that centrality of single units is strongly heterogeneous in the network, with a large group of units being marginally involved in the network and a small group of spatial distributed hub units being extremely central. The presence of hubs provides further evidence of a complex network topology at the single unit level."

Since the detected firing rates varied approximately across two orders of magnitude (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), this could lead to an underestimation of degree for low spiking units and an overrepresentation of high firing units as hubs. Therefore, we performed a careful examination of the influence of firing rates on degree and betweenness centrality based on our equal rate model (see Materials and methods). Two sets of networks were tested, simple networks (SNs) and complex networks (CNs), as mentioned previously. SNs had normally distributed connectivity based on the best fitting Gaussian model for the surrogate network degree centrality distribution, while connectivity for CNs were set to precisely resemble the EXPTPL model for the average degree centrality distribution of the measured networks. CNs additionally had a small-world and rich-club topology, as described in the following section."

We simulated a neuronal layer of 32,000 neurons with the same distance-dependent connectivity density as detected in our data (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>), but with Poisson distributed connectivity (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>; see Materials and methods). Subsampling was performed in correspondence with our array configuration down to the number of neurons we recorded for real datasets, showing no change to the shape of the degree distribution (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). Only when we decreased the connection density of the model below the detected connectivity in our data was a false heavy-tailed degree distribution apparent (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>), which was highly correlated with the networks breaking apart into unconnected components (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.93). Additionally, this effect could not be present in our analyzed data since we only analyzed the largest component of the single unit networks. Theses controls suggest that the existence of hubs can neither be explained by distance-dependent connectivity, differences in firing rates, or subsampling."

Frequency spectra of ACHs of all units and of CCHs that had a significant connection were tested for significant frequency bins above chance (cluster-based surrogate test, p&lt;0.05). We found beta (18\u201335 Hz) and low frequency (3\u20137 Hz) oscillations predominantly present in the spiking patterns of all datasets (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1C\u2013E</a>).

At this point, it is important to emphasize that we first tested for significant connectivity independent of oscillatory behavior and only in a second step these connections were tested for their oscillatory behavior as described in the Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods section. This ensured that any detected connection is based on a significant amount (or suppression) of coincidental spikes without any selective sensitivity for oscillatory coupling. As an additional test, we simulated pairs of neurons either with an oscillatory or non-oscillatory firing pattern (see Materials and methods). Since peaks and troughs in CCHs reflect a systematic time lag in spiking between units across trials we simulated different degrees of coupling strengths by systematically varying the trial-wise time offset in spiking for both firing pattern types. Synchronization strength was simply a function of the variation in spike timing offsets between the two neurons and not whether the firing pattern was oscillatory or not (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), confirming that oscillatory coupling is not a priori more detectable than non-oscillatory coupling."

Thresholds were chosen to give, as closely as possible, the same number of beta and low frequency oscillators as statistical methods. Using this method all three groups had a higher degree and betweenness centrality than non-oscillators, similar to statistical detection (Tukey-Kramer test for rank, p&lt;0.001). To rule out that firing rate dependent detectability of functional connections could cause a spurious inter-dependence of high centrality and detection of oscillatory synchrony, we repeated testing for differences in centrality only with units having a firing rate of 10\u00a0Hz and above, confirming that oscillators had significantly higher centrality values (Tukey-Kramer test for rank, p&lt;0.001). Similar results were obtained when we tested the data of each monkeys individually (Tukey-Kramer test for rank, p&lt;0.01). To our knowledge, the current results represent the first evidence that oscillators have a higher centrality in the single unit network than non-oscillators. Consequently, the rich-club of all networks overlapped significantly with oscillating single units (permutation test, p&lt;0.05), highlighting oscillators as the backbone (<a href=\"#bib59\">van den Heuvel et al., 2012</a>) of single unit functional connectivity (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>)."

It is well known that oscillatory synchrony in frontal and motor areas appears in short bursts of only a couple of cycles with variable length and amplitude (<a href=\"#bib40\">Murthy and Fetz, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Lundqvist et al., 2016</a>). We used this property of oscillatory synchrony to split up our data into two equal blocks with high oscillatory and low oscillatory synchrony to investigate the effect on rich-club topology. Since a minimum number of trials are required to properly estimate the functional connectivity for topological analyses, we used the two datasets from monkey M were we recorded more than 900 trials (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). The data was split into two blocks with equal number of trials per condition to prevent any biases by different epochs or conditions. Instead of calculating unit-wise ACHs we pooled the activity of all units and estimated single trial population ACHs spectra, reflecting the trial-wise level of oscillatory synchronization. Single trial population ACHs calculations and frequency analyses were performed the same way as for single unit ACHs (see Materials and methods) and divided by their average power in the beta (18\u201335 Hz) and low frequency (3\u20137 Hz) band (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). After separation into two blocks, the estimation of functional connectivity and network topological analyses were repeated as if they were two separate datasets. For a valid statement about changes in rich-club topology, the network structure and in particular the degree distribution, should not be changed. For both datasets the unit-wise degree as well as the degree distribution were very similar (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3B,C</a>), as well as the betweenness centrality distribution (data not shown). However, when comparing the rich-club level there was a striking difference for higher rich-club levels (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3D</a>). In both datasets, the high oscillatory state network showed a clear rich-club topology, whereas the low oscillatory state network hardly showed any rich-club effect. These results suggest that a rich-cub topology is only present when there is a high level of oscillatory synchrony in the network."

Each CCH can be understood as a transfer function of spike rates between two units, describing the coincidences per spike at every time point relative to each other. Negative time bins bin reflect input from the reference unit to the target unit while positive time bins reflect the output. To predict the firing rate of a unit, we convolved the spike trains of all units having a significant connection to the corresponding unit with their respective CCHs (output part). Assuming single units to be simple linear integrators, we summed up the individual convolved spike trains (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>) and correlated these estimated signals with the original spike trains of the target units smoothed with a Gaussian kernel (SD: 3.66 ms), identical to the CCH smoothing. Ninety-nine percent of predicted firing rate curves were positively correlated with the real firing rates of the corresponding target units (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>)."

Three different permutation tests were applied: shuffling of trials, shuffling of the output parts of CCHs, and shuffling of input units. Only if the correlation coefficient significantly exceeded all three permutation distributions (p&lt;0.05), the correlation\u00a0was considered significant. Remarkably, 45% of the firing rate patterns of our single units could be significantly predicted by their inputs. The differences between grasp types and decision conditions could be significantly predicted in 9% of all cases (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>; positive correlation: 79%; shuffling of the transfer kernels and input units, p&lt;0.05), even using this simple approach that involved no parameter fitting. The functional network topology presented here allows a surprisingly accurate prediction of temporal firing dynamics, suggesting that the network captured in our recordings, despite being a small subset of the entire network, accurately represents a large portion of the relevant communication in the fronto-parietal grasping network."

The network was structured as a complex network (<a href=\"#bib11\">Bullmore and Sporns, 2009</a>) with a modular SW topology, and highly central hub-units localized in all three areas forming a rich-club. The advantage of such a topology is that it allows for fast and dynamical information processing combined with high robustness against errors (<a href=\"#bib3\">Barab\u00e1si and Oltvai, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Bassett and Bullmore, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Bullmore and Sporns, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">van den Heuvel et al., 2012</a>). More detailed analyses of the kind of synchronization processes within the network revealed that the population of single units could be divided into two groups: oscillatory spiking and synchronized units in the low frequency range or in the beta range, and a group of non-oscillatory spiking units. Importantly, the hubs and therefore the rich-club consisted predominantly of oscillators, while the peripheral neurons were predominantly non-oscillators."

More and more evidence supports the hypothesis that information is propagated not only as a simple rate code, but by feed-forward coincidence detection accomplished by oscillatory synchrony (<a href=\"#bib20\">Fries, 2009</a>), meaning that phase-synchronization of neurons with one another is used as a selection mechanism for information transmission. The advantage of this mechanism is not only a reduction of energy cost, but also rhythmic gain modulation. By changing the phase of a synchronous neural population, such as in high-order areas, the input of one group of neurons can be selectively amplified as inputs to another group of neurons, allowing for high selectivity and high flexibility, which are exactly the requirements a hub has to fulfill (<a href=\"#bib60\">van den Heuvel and Sporns, 2013a</a>). While feed-forward coincidence detection can theoretically also be accomplished by non-oscillatory processes (<a href=\"#bib20\">Fries, 2009</a>), the coordination of a network spanning different areas requires a larger group of neurons to fire in a coherent manner (<a href=\"#bib14\">Buzs\u00e1ki and Wang, 2012</a>). A rich-club of oscillating neurons is exactly that, a coherent structure cross-linking functionally segregated modules (<a href=\"#bib61\">van den Heuvel and Sporns, 2013b</a>), suggesting oscillators act as a backbone promoting and coordinating functional communication across different cortical areas (<a href=\"#bib59\">van den Heuvel et al., 2012</a>). This hypothesis is also in accordance with the finding that synchronization over larger distances (&gt;2\u00a0mm) is almost always oscillatory, whereas synchronization over short distances occurs also in the absence of oscillations (<a href=\"#bib31\">K\u00f6nig et al., 1995</a>)."

Parietal and motor areas have been found to communicate via ~20\u00a0Hz beta synchronization (<a href=\"#bib47\">Pesaran et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Brovelli et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Pesaran et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Dean et al., 2012</a>) and an increment in beta band activity seems related to the maintenance of the current sensorimotor or cognitive state, in agreement with findings in the basal ganglia (<a href=\"#bib19\">Engel and Fries, 2010</a>). Oscillatory synchrony in the low frequency range (1\u20134\u00a0Hz) has been shown to be important for communication within and between the prefrontal and motor areas (<a href=\"#bib56\">Siegel et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">N\u00e1cher et al., 2013</a>) and as a potential population mechanism of movement generation in motor and premotor cortex during reach initiation (<a href=\"#bib15\">Churchland et al., 2012</a>). Therefore, beta seems to be a stabilizing signal, low frequencies a global coordination signal, and both are involved in movement initiation with opposing roles. One possibility is that a function of the rich-club, composed of beta and low frequency oscillators spanning parietal and prefrontal cortex, is coordinating movement generation and initiation. Another possible explanation is that the power of fast oscillations is modulated by the phase of slow oscillations, termed cross-frequency phase-amplitude coupling, which could serve as a neuronal syntax for information transmission (<a href=\"#bib12\">Buzs\u00e1ki, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Buzs\u00e1ki and Mizuseki, 2014</a>). Our observation of oscillators in both frequency ranges simultaneously (third row of <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,D</a>, and <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,D</a>) supports this concept."

This is in line with the previous findings that information via beta band is primarily transmitted from the parietal to the frontal regions and not vice versa (<a href=\"#bib10\">Brovelli et al., 2004</a>). In areas that are hierarchically lower than the parietal lobe, such as the visual system, beta was identified as a top-down communication frequency (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bastos et al., 2015</a>). Therefore, the parietal lobe might be a center of beta generation. Low frequency oscillatory synchrony during active behavior has been found predominantly in prefrontal areas (<a href=\"#bib56\">Siegel et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">N\u00e1cher et al., 2013</a>). We speculate that the center of low frequency oscillation could be in the prefrontal cortex, suggesting that different anatomical regions generate and communicate with different frequencies. The exact reason for the presence of distinct frequency bands for communication and their detailed interplay needs to be addressed in future studies."

Furthermore, we demonstrated on a model that subsampling from a huge network with the same distance-dependent connectivity density as detected in our data did not affect the shape of the degree distribution (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

Our method to detect functional connectivity corrects for common drive due to stimulus- and movement-locked inputs as well as for trial-wise fluctuations in spiking. Nevertheless, there are two possible additional sources of common drive. The first is the possibility that two neurons receive input from a third neuron while themselves being functionally uncoupled, resulting in a significant peak in the CCHs due to their input similarity. We investigated this possibility using our equal rate model, which included physiologically plausible firing rates and pairwise correlations. Common drive pairs of simulated simple or complex networks were detected as being significant in only around 1% of all cases, suggesting that, irrespective of the underlying topology, our method for detecting functional connectivity is hardly biased by pairwise common drive. The second possibility is that cortical columns or areas could receive common drive input that would cause these neurons to fire in a synchronized fashion even if they were functionally uncoupled. In such a scenario two things would be expected: first, units on the same electrode, as well as units in the same area, should show a similar connectivity pattern. Second, all neurons in the network should show a similar number of functional connections, since they are synchronized by common drive, resulting in a uniform degree centrality distribution. However, we found 43% of all neurons on the same electrode to be not connected, and only sparse connectivity was found in the same area with strongly connected pairs of neurons next to unconnected pairs (e.g., <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"#fig2s2\">2</a>). Most importantly, the degree distribution of the measured networks was highly heterogeneous and heavy-tailed in contradiction to what would be expected by a strong influence of column- or area-specific common drive. Therefore, it is unlikely that event unrelated common drive can account for a significant amount of the detected functional connections. Further evidence arises from the fact that we found beta, low frequency, and non-oscillatory synchronization with different maximum peak or trough time time and phase lags (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), present simultaneously across all areas, also not consistent with a global common drive bias."

Surrogate CCHs contain the same stimulus locked correlation, but no pairwise temporal correlation. To this end, peri-stimulus time histograms (PSTH) were calculated for the same two time windows and alignments (Cue and Movement onset) as mentioned above, separately for each single unit and task condition (smoothed with a Gaussian kernel, SD: 3.66 ms). Artificial spike trains were generated from an inhomogeneous Poisson process using the PSTHs as the rate function (<a href=\"#bib49\">Ramalingam et al., 2013</a>). These artificial spike trains preserved the number of trials and the number of spikes per trial, but varied in the timing of individual spikes (surrogate data; e.g., <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Since the number of spikes per trial was preserved for all units recorded simultaneously, any trial-wise common drive is equally present and therefore accounted for in the surrogate data (<a href=\"#bib57\">Smith and Kohn, 2008</a>). From these surrogate data, surrogate CCHs were calculated by replacing <math id=\"inf15\"><mrow><msubsup><mi>x</mi><mi>n</mi><mi>i</mi></msubsup></mrow></math> with the trials of the artificial spike trains for the corresponding single unit (surrogate CCHs).

Cluster-based tests are tests for dependent variables, which consider contiguous values fulfilling a certain criterion as a cluster. Instead of calculating a test statistic for individual values, the accumulated values of clusters are tested against a null distribution of accumulated cluster values by chance. In our case, adjacent time lags are not independent, since functional coupling of neurons does not follow millisecond precision. We checked significance for a time window of \u2212200\u00a0ms to 200\u00a0ms. Calculation of this test statistic involved the following steps:"

All surrogate networks were created by shuffling the connectivity matrix. Since connectivity is a function of distance (<a href=\"#bib57\">Smith and Kohn, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Gerhard et al., 2011</a>), distance dependency was reflected in our surrogate data. During shuffling, the number of connections for single units on the same electrode, the same array, the same cortical area, and the different inter-area connections were always held constant (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). For all surrogate networks, the total number of single units, number of connections, and the distance-dependent ratio of bi- and uni-directional connections were kept as similar as possible to the original connectivity matrix with only the required network parameter shuffled. We used these sets of surrogate networks to test the small-world coefficient, the degree centrality distribution, and the betweenness centrality distribution. Statistical testing of the rich-club coefficient and conservative testing of modularity requires surrogate networks with a matched degree centrality distribution. To this end, we generated a second set of surrogates networks with the degree distribution preserved. One issue that could arise due to shuffling is that the connectivity matrix of some units or groups of units could become disconnected from the main part of the network, since the calculation of most network measures requires a fully connected, not segregated, network. For this purpose, each surrogate network was tested for segregation into different components. If a network was segregated, it was discarded and the process repeated until 1000 non-segregated networks were generated."

Briefly, this test evaluates the t-statistic (independent samples) between centrality or rich-club distributions and their surrogate distributions over all data points exceeding a critical alpha-level set to 0.05. In a second step, adjacent degree, betweenness values, or rich-club coefficients exceeding the set alpha-level are considered as clusters, extracted, and their t-value summed. A test distribution was generated by randomly permuting the centrality or rich-club distributions across recording days and monkeys with the corresponding surrogate distributions by randomly reassigning them to one of the two groups while maintaining the group size. For each partition (1000 partitions) the t-statistics and clustering was repeated. From every partition the largest cluster-level statistic was used to generate a largest chance cluster distribution. For each real cluster-level statistic a nonparametric statistical test was performed by calculating a p-value under the largest chance cluster distribution. Thus, the multiple comparisons for each sample are replaced by a single comparison, replacing the need to make multiple comparisons."

To this end, we calculated the pairwise physical distance between all pairs of electrodes based on an anatomical diagram (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>) and defined distance groups with a stepsize of 3.6\u00a0mm including 0\u00a0mm as one group. The physical distance between AIP and the two other areas is misleading, since the neuronal axons have to pass the central sulcus. Therefore, we set all distances between AIP and the two other areas as a separate maximum distance group. Note that we had to define groups to be able to shuffle connections. Nevertheless, the categorical distance dependent shuffling was subdivided into 8 groups, which is more conservative than the 6 groups defined in the original analysis. All statistics for network measures gave nearly identical results, with no case where a measure was significant when it was not for categorical distance dependent shuffling, and vice versa for non-significant measures. In addition, the normalized rich-club coefficient, which depends on the surrogate networks, was highly correlated (r = 0.98) between the two different ways of distance dependent shuffling."

The average degree of their analyzed networks was 2.19 (SD = 0.45, min = 1.84, max = 2.98), in contrast to our average (non-normalized) degree of 8.28 (SD = 5.73, min = 3.87, max = 25.59). Note that the highest average degree of their analyzed networks was smaller than the lowest average degree of our analyzed networks. More importantly, the underlying networks of their study were strongly fragmented into components (min = 70, max = 591 components), while we excluded all single units which were not part of the largest component, resulting in one component for analysis, while their largest average component size was 20.2. Our network analysis was done on average on 70 single units (min 30, max 148 single units). Based on these different network parameters we concluded that the detected topology, in particular falsely detected power law degree distribution, could be due to the fragmentation into different components. To evaluate this, we created neuronal planes with distance dependent connection density of 1/5, 1/4, 1/3, 1/2, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 times of the empirically collected data. After subsampling, we estimated the goodness of fit for the power law model to the degree centrality distribution, the size of the largest component relative to the whole network, and the level of compartmentalization, described by"

Since different oscillation frequencies could be present, we computed power spectra of all corrected CCHs and ACHs (<a href=\"#bib39\">Mure\u015fan et al., 2008</a>). The power spectrum gives the magnitude of a signal as a function of frequency. To avoid distortions by sharp peaks with small delays that are occasionally present in CCHs (<a href=\"#bib21\">Fujisawa et al., 2008</a>), which cause a broad band increase in power due to their impulse like properties, we cut out the time range from \u22125\u00a0ms to 5\u00a0ms and interpolated the segment linearly. Importantly, sharp peaks were only removed for spectral analyses and not for functional connectivity analyses. Frequency spectra were computed using a discrete Fourier transform algorithm (<a href=\"#bib56\">Siegel et al., 2009</a>) (100 logarithmically scaled frequencies from 3 to 100 Hz). Note that computing power spectra of CCHs and ACHs instead of raw spike trains reduced the influence of firing rate on the power spectrum as well as the problem of frequency leakage due to the binary properties of the spike train (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bair et al., 1994</a>). In analyzing such a large range of frequencies we had to take the specific characteristics of CCHs into account. Underlying oscillation frequencies in physiology are not phase stable, which leads to a limited number of side lobes in the CCH or ACH. The number of side lobes are also strongly frequency dependent, which makes the ideal window length for Fourier transformation around the 0 time lag frequency dependent. We used Hanning windows of four times the frequency of interest period (with a maximum of 1000\u00a0ms and a minimum of 150\u00a0ms) aligned on the 0 time bin of the CCHs (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), resulting in approximately 1/frequency and half octave spectro-temporal bandwidth. Each frequency bin was divided by its window length for correct scaling of all frequency bins. To determine significance, we repeated spectral analysis on the corrected surrogate CCHs and ACHs, subtracted their mean spectra from the corresponding spectra of real data and used a cluster-based surrogate test as described before to evaluate the significance of the underlying frequencies in the CCHs."

Spike trains of neurons were generated as a probabilistic process. In case of oscillatory firing neurons, the probability function was a 20\u00a0Hz sinusoid. For non-oscillating neurons, we first randomized the 20\u00a0Hz sinusoid, in a second step filtered it with a non-causal 50 Hz low-pass filter (Butterworth filter, fourth order) in order to produce a similar decay in spiking probability, and in a last step the filtered probability vector was variance matched with the 20\u00a0Hz sinusoid to have a maximum degree matching between the two kinds of probability functions. For each trial the same probability function was used for both neurons with a spiking probability of 0.05 per ms to stay in a physiological range. Independent Poisson distributed noise was added to both neurons representing background stochastic firing, resulting in an average rate of around 5 Hz per neuron. Varying the different parameters within physiological ranges did not alter the results. To simulate different degrees of coupling strengths we systematically varied the trial-wise time offset in spiking of the pair of neurons to each other from completely synchronized to a jitter of a complete cycle (50\u00a0ms) in steps of 1 ms."

Neuronal activity was recorded in three Macaque monkeys while they performed a grasping task. The recording activity was used to infer directed connections amongst pairs of neurons, and the resulting connectivity matrix served as the basis for subsequent analyses. The authors find that this single neuron network is modular and has not only a small world, but also a rich-club structure. Remarkably, rich-club neurons showed oscillatory synchronisation in the beta and low frequency (&lt; 7 Hz) range, while the remaining neurons tended to show non-oscillatory synchrony. These results imply that topological and functional properties of single neurons are related, and that oscillatory and non-oscillatory interactions assume distinct roles at the network level."

The latter consists of estimates of directed functional connectivity, obtained from analysing cross-correlation histograms (CCHs) with regard to signatures of temporal precedence, including a correction for common driving input by subtraction of surrogacy CCHs. While CCHs are not an uncommon statistic in electrophysiology, we wondered whether your specific approach to extract directed functional connectivity estimates from CCHs has been examined and validated in previous literature?

Instead of using our LFP recordings to dissociate periods of high and low levels of oscillatory synchrony, we calculated single trial population ACH spectra. In order to avoid bias by the time course of the trial or different conditions, we split the data based on the amount of single trial beta and low frequency power into two blocks with an equal number of trials per condition, and repeated our functional connectivity and topological analyses.

For all three datasets recorded from monkey M we estimated physical distance based on the anatomical diagram (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>) and defined distance groups and repeated all statistics for network measures, as suggested. All statistics for network measures yielded nearly identical results, with no case where a measure was significant when it was not for categorical distance dependent shuffling, and vice versa for non-significant measures, as described in detail in the Methods section (Subsection \u201cStatistics for network measures\u201d)."

Interestingly, most troughs/peaks had very short time lags (45.67% &lt; 10 ms, and 85.12% &lt; 100 ms) in agreement with what is physiologically expected.

Nevertheless, for spectral analyses they cause a broad band increase in power due to their impulse-like properties, which does not reflect any oscillatory synchrony, and were therefore removed sharp peaks for spectral analyses. For clarification, we added a sentence to the Methods section."
