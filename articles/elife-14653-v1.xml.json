                    "text": "PAK1 inhibitors are known to markedly improve social and cognitive function in several animal models of brain disorders, including autism, but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. We show here that disruption of PAK1 in mice suppresses inhibitory neurotransmission through an increase in tonic, but not phasic, secretion of endocannabinoids (eCB). Consistently, we found elevated levels of anandamide (AEA), but not 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) following PAK1 disruption. This increased tonic AEA signaling is mediated by reduced cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and COX-2 inhibitors recapitulate the effect of PAK1 deletion on GABAergic transmission in a CB1 receptor-dependent manner. These results establish a novel signaling process whereby PAK1 upregulates COX-2, reduces AEA and restricts tonic eCB-mediated processes. Because PAK1 and eCB are both critically involved in many other organ systems in addition to the brain, our findings may provide a unified mechanism by which PAK1 regulates these systems and their dysfunctions including cancers, inflammations and allergies."

We show here that disruption of PAK1 in mice suppresses inhibitory neurotransmission through an increase in tonic, but not phasic, secretion of endocannabinoids (eCB). Consistently, we found elevated levels of anandamide (AEA), but not 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) following PAK1 disruption. This increased tonic AEA signaling is mediated by reduced cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and COX-2 inhibitors recapitulate the effect of PAK1 deletion on GABAergic transmission in a CB1 receptor-dependent manner. These results establish a novel signaling process whereby PAK1 upregulates COX-2, reduces AEA and restricts tonic eCB-mediated processes. Because PAK1 and eCB are both critically involved in many other organ systems in addition to the brain, our findings may provide a unified mechanism by which PAK1 regulates these systems and their dysfunctions including cancers, inflammations and allergies."

Recent studies indicate that GABA-mediated synaptic inhibition is particularly important to maintain an appropriate E/I ratio and that inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) mediated by GABA receptors are frequently altered in various brain diseases and their animal models (<a href=\"#bib4\">Braat and Kooy, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Lewis et al., 2005</a>). Although subjected to multiple regulations, GABA transmission is strongly inhibited by endocannabinoids (eCBs), a group of neuromodulatory lipids known to affect a wide range of physiological processes and medical conditions (<a href=\"#bib23\">Katona and Freund, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Morena et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Piomelli, 2003</a>). In the brain, eCBs are produced and secreted from postsynaptic neurons and activate presynaptic cannabinoid 1 (CB1) receptors to reduce the release of a multitude of neurotransmitters, including GABA (<a href=\"#bib23\">Katona and Freund, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Morena et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Piomelli, 2003</a>). Two types of eCB-mediated suppression of GABA release have been studied: tonic eCB release that regulates basal synaptic transmission, and phasic eCB release, induced by postsynaptic depolarization or receptor-mediated eCB production, which mediates transient decreases in synaptic transmission during short-term plasticity (<a href=\"#bib23\">Katona and Freund, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Morena et al., 2016</a>). Although the metabolic process of the eCBs and the enzymes involved in their regulation have been a focus of extensive research (<a href=\"#bib23\">Katona and Freund, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Morena et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Piomelli, 2003</a>), cellular signaling mechanisms that regulate eCB signaling, particularly tonic eCB signaling, remain poorly understood."

                        "text": "p21-activated kinases (PAKs) are a family of serine/threonine protein kinases that are activated by multiple synaptic proteins including Ras and Rho GTPases. Extensive studies have indicated that PAKs are involved in a number of cellular processes, particularly in the regulation of gene expression and cellular cytoskeleton (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bokoch, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Zhao and Manser, 2012</a>). Accordingly, changes in PAKs are found to be associated with a wide range of physiological and pathological conditions including various forms of cancers and PAK inhibitors are being actively exploited as therapeutic agents to treat these diseases (<a href=\"#bib25\">Kelly and Chernoff, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Kumar et al., 2006</a>). Recent human studies have also revealed that PAKs are linked to a number of devastating neurological and mental disorders including autism, intellectual disability, Huntingtin\u2019s diseases and Alzheimer\u2019s diseases (<a href=\"#bib13\">Gilman et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Ma et al., 2012</a>). Animal studies have indeed shown that PAKs, particularly PAK1, the predominant member of the PAK family expressed in the brain, are involved in the regulation of excitatory synaptic function, including spine structure, synaptic plasticity and memory formation (<a href=\"#bib1\">Asrar et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Hayashi et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Huang et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Meng et al., 2005</a>). Most remarkably, more recent studies demonstrate that inhibition of PAK1, either genetically or pharmacologically, can ameliorate the cognitive and social deficits in several animal models of neurodevelopmental disorders, particularly autism, including genetic models targeting fragile X syndrome and neurofibromatosis (<a href=\"#bib9\">Dolan et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Hayashi et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Molosh et al., 2014</a>). However, the mechanism by which PAK1 exerts such diverse therapeutic effects remains elusive. Quite interestingly, many of these same animal models of neurodevelopmental disorders also exhibit pronounced alterations in eCB signaling (<a href=\"#bib11\">F\u00f6ldy et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Jung et al., 2012</a>), and several reports have now suggested that, like PAK1, targeting eCB signaling may provide benefit in these conditions (<a href=\"#bib5\">Busquets-Garcia et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Qin et al., 2015</a>). As these animal models share a common deficit in E/I balance, which appear to involve critical roles of both PAK1 and eCB signaling, we have hypothesized that PAK1 might be a critical player in the regulation of E/I homeostasis through an interaction with eCB signaling. Consistent with this hypothesis, our data indicate that PAK1 restricts tonic eCB signaling in the hippocampus through the regulation of synaptosomal cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression, a non-canonical but relevant pathway in the metabolism of eCB signaling. In turn, this ability of PAK1 to restrict tonic eCB signaling confers an alteration in the E/I homeostasis of the hippocampus through the regulation of tonic GABA transmission. Given the overlapping importance of PAK1, COX-2 and eCB signaling in an array of physiological and pathophysiological processes, the identification of this functional signaling interaction likely has significant implications for a multitude of disease processes, such as autism, inflammatory conditions and cancer."

Excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs and IPSCs) were pharmacologically isolated by using respective inhibitors specific to glutamate or GABA receptors (i.e. EPSC recorded by including 100\u2009\u03bcM GABA\u03b1 receptor antagonist picrotoxin and IPSC by including 10\u2009\u03bcM AMPAR antagonist NBQX plus 50\u2009\u03bcM NMDAR antagonist D-APV). First, we measured the E/I ratio by sequentially recording evoked synaptic responses (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b</a>), first in the absence of any inhibitors to obtain total synaptic currents (i.e. eEPSC+eIPSC), then in the presence of NBQX/APV to obtain eIPSC, and finally in the presence of NBQX/APV/picrotoxin to verify the eIPSC component. As shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1c</a>, the E/I ratio was significantly increased in PAK1 KO compared to the WT littermates. Because PAK1 KO mice show no deficits in basal excitatory synaptic strength\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib1\">Asrar et al., 2009</a>), the increased E/I ratio in the KO mice is likely due to impaired inhibitory transmission. To test this possibility directly, we performed input/output experiments of eIPSC and as shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1d</a>, the amplitude of eIPSC was significantly smaller in the KO compared to the WT control over a wide range of stimulus intensities. To exclude the possibility that the KO mice may have suffered developmental compensations that could contribute to the reduced eIPSC, we tested the effect of the group1 PAK inhibitor IPA3 (10\u2009\u03bcM) (<a href=\"#bib42\">Rudolph et al., 2013</a>). As shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1e</a>, bath application of IPA3 caused a rapid and significant decrease in the amplitude of eIPSC in WT, but not in PAK1 KO neurons. To further corroborate this result, we employed an independent short peptide known to specifically inhibit PAK1 (<a href=\"#bib43\">Shin et al., 2013</a>). As shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1f</a>, inclusion of this peptide in the postsynaptic neurons (20\u2009\u03bcg/ml) also significantly decreased the amplitude of eIPSC in WT, but not in PAK1 KO neurons. The fast acting nature of these inhibitors (within minutes) indicate that the effect of PAK1 on eIPSC is not likely due to a developmental effect but rather direct involvement of PAK1 at the synapse. These results also indicate that PAK1 disruption specifically in the postsynaptic CA1 neurons is sufficient to cause impaired inhibitory synaptic transmission."

As shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a\u2013f</a>, the frequency of sIPSC (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2c</a>) and mIPSC (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2f</a>) was significantly reduced in PAK1 KO compared to WT neurons. The amplitude of sIPSC (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2b</a>) and mIPSC (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2e</a>) were not altered in the KO mice. Consistent with previous results (<a href=\"#bib1\">Asrar et al., 2009</a>), neither the frequency nor the amplitude of spontaneous or miniature excitatory synaptic currents (sEPSC or mEPSC) was altered in PAK1 KO mice (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2g\u2013i</a>). To test whether these changes were specific to PAK1 KO mice, we analyzed KO mice lacking ROCK2 (<a href=\"#bib48\">Zhou et al., 2009</a>), a closely related kinase also activated by the Rho family small GTPases, but found no significant changes in any of these parameters in these mice (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). These results suggest that the release property at the inhibitory synapse is selectively impaired in PAK1 KO neurons. To investigate this further, we examined transmitter release induced by sustained high frequency stimulations. As shown in <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>, synaptic depression induced by 3\u2009min of 5\u00a0Hz stimulations was significantly slower in PAK1 KO mice compared to the WT littermates. These results indicate that PAK1 regulates inhibitory synaptic transmission likely through a presynaptic mechanism."

Again the drug was included in the recording electrode to specifically inhibit PAK1 in the postsynaptic neurons. As shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a\u2013c</a>, inclusion of IPA3 caused a significant decrease in the frequency (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3c</a>), but not the amplitude (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b</a>) of sIPSC in WT neurons.

Importantly, IPA3 had no effect on the frequency of sIPSC and\u00a0mIPSC\u00a0in PAK1 KO mice (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a,c,d,f</a>), again confirming that the effect of IPA3 is mediated by PAK1.

                                "text": "Although the above results that postsynaptic inhibition of PAK1 causes a reduction in the frequency, but not the amplitude of IPSCs, suggest a presynaptic mechanism, it is possible that a reduction in postsynaptic GABA receptors, which could result in silent synapses, may also lead to a reduced frequency in sIPSC and mIPSC. To address this possibility, we first examined the number of GABA-positive neurons and inhibitory synapses, and the level of GABA receptor associated proteins, but found no significant differences between WT and PAK1 KO mice (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a\u2013e</a>; also see <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). To determine if GABA receptors were functionally equivalent, we recorded IPSCs evoked by a brief puff of GABA (1\u2009mM, 100 ms) in a co-culture system where WT and PAK1 KO neurons were grown on the same coverlips in order to minimize the differences in culturing conditions between genotypes (see Materials and methods), but again found no differences between WT and PAK1 KO neurons (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4f,g</a>). To further examine if other postsynaptic processes could contribute to the effect of PAK1, we analyzed the effect of cytochalasin D (5\u2009\u03bcM) and NSC23766 (250\u2009\u03bcM), pharmacological inhibitors for actin polymerization and Rac1\u00a0activation respectively. Both actin and Rac1 are key targets of PAK1 signaling (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bokoch, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Zhao and Manser, 2012</a>). As shown in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5a\u2013f,</a> no effect on sIPSCs was observed for either inhibitor. It is important to note that consistent with previous results (<a href=\"#bib32\">Meng et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Zhou et al., 2011</a>), these two inhibitors (at the same concentrations used here) had profound effects on excitatory synaptic function, including basal synaptic transmission (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5g\u2013i</a>) and metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR)-dependent long-term depression induced by 50\u2009\u03bcM DHPG (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5j,k</a>). Taken together, we concluded that postsynaptic PAK1 regulates inhibitory synaptic transmission likely through a retrograde mechanism to modulate GABA release."

                                "text": "Endocannabinoids (eCB) are known to be generated and secreted from postsynaptic pyramidal neurons to act as a retrograde messenger to inhibit GABA release (<a href=\"#bib23\">Katona and Freund, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Piomelli, 2003</a>). While the tonic secretion of eCB affects basal synaptic transmission, its phasic secretion induced by postsynaptic depolarization regulates synaptic plasticity (<a href=\"#bib23\">Katona and Freund, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Morena et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Piomelli, 2003</a>). An enhanced tonic signaling would reduce the probability of GABA release, and thus decrease IPSC frequency similar to what we observed in neurons of PAK1 KO mice or in WT neurons loaded with PAK1 inhibitors. Thus, we hypothesized that disruption of PAK1 would enhance tonic eCB signaling. To test this hypothesis, we first examined the effect of AM251, a CB1 receptor antagonist and inverse agonist. In WT, bath application of AM251 (5\u2009\u03bcM) increased eIPSCs to approximately 150% of the baseline response (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6a</a>), reflecting disinhibition of GABA release by blocking tonically active CB1 receptors (<a href=\"#bib36\">Neu et al., 2007</a>). Remarkably, in PAK1 KO mice, AM251 enhanced eIPSC amplitudes to 250% of the baseline response (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6a</a>). Acute inhibition of postsynaptic PAK1 by IPA3 (10\u2009\u03bcM) or by the PAK1 inhibitory peptide (20\u2009\u03bcg/ml) prior to the AM251 application produced similar results as shown in PAK1 KO mice (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6b,c</a>). These findings indicate that tonic eCB signaling is restricted by PAK1 and that disruption of PAK1 causes a robust increase in tonic eCB effect. Consistent with this, an increase in tonic eCB signaling could explain why the frequency of sIPSC/mIPSC is reduced in PAK1 KO mice as shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig3\">3</a>. To further investigate whether the enhanced eCB signaling in the KO mice is due to changes in CB receptors and/or their downstream signaling processes in the presynaptic terminal, we examined the protein level of CB1 receptors, but found no differences in either total brain lysates (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6d</a>) or synaptosomal fractions (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6e</a>). In addition, bath application of the CB1 receptor agonist WIN (5\u2009\u03bcM), designed to maximally activate the receptor, depressed synaptic responses to the same degree in both WT and PAK1 KO mice (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6f</a>), suggesting that CB1 receptors and their downstream events are intact in the KO mice. It is important to note that DMSO (the dissolvent for many of the pharmacological agents in this study) had no effect on eIPSC (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

To investigate whether this interaction occurs in PAK1 KO mice, we analyzed phasic suppression of inhibition induced by postsynaptic depolarization (DSI) and found that the amplitude of DSI was significantly reduced in the KO compared to WT mice (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7c</a>), supporting the idea that elevated AEA competes with 2-AG, resulting in reduced phasic 2-AG signaling. Together, these data create a compelling argument that disruption of PAK1 selectively augments tonic AEA signaling to dampen constitutive synaptic GABA transmission."

Consistent with the fact that there were no changes in 2-AG, the enzymes involved in the generation and metabolism of 2-AG, including monoacylglycerol lipase (MGL) and diacylglycerol lipase (DGL), were not altered in PAK1 KO mice (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7d\u2013g</a>). Surprisingly, however, both total and synaptosomal protein levels of the enzyme primarily involved in AEA metabolism, fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), were also not altered in PAK1 KO mice (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7h,i</a>). As several reports have identified that COX-2 can be an important regulator of AEA signaling (<a href=\"#bib14\">Glaser and Kaczocha, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Hermanson et al., 2013</a>), we examined if PAK1 deletion could impact AEA signaling through a COX-2 mediated mechanism. Notably, we found that although the total protein level of COX-2 was not altered (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7j</a>), its synaptosomal fraction was significantly reduced in the KO brain (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7k</a>, <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), suggesting that PAK1 is specifically important for COX-2 expression at the synapse and/or during synaptic activity. Together these results suggest that the enhanced eCB signaling, due to the disruption of PAK1, might be mediated by reduced COX-2 and subsequently elevated AEA."

As shown in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8a</a>, application of Nimesulide (30\u2009\u03bcM) in WT neurons depressed IPSCs to approximately 45% of the baseline response, presumably due to increased eCB production, but this Nimesulide-induced depression was significantly reduced (to 70% of the baseline response) in PAK1 KO neurons, consistent with an already reduced COX-2 level in the KO mice. Following Nimesulide application and after the depressed responses became stabilized, we then treated the neurons with the CB1 receptor antagonist AM251 (5\u2009\u03bcM). As shown in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8b</a>, both WT and PAK1 KO neurons now showed equally enhanced responses (250% of the baseline response) that were similar to PAK1 KO neurons treated with AM251 alone as shown in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6a</a>.

Finally, to provide further evidence that this increase in tonic eCB signaling in PAK1 KO mice is mediated by a selective increase in AEA, and not 2-AG, signaling, we examined the effects of specific AEA and 2-AG hydrolysis inhibitors. Similar to what was seen following COX-2 inhibition, the ability of the FAAH inhibitor URB597 (1\u2009\u03bcM) to reduce eIPSC was reduced in PAK1 KO mice relative to WT mice (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8c</a>) and the effect of AM251 (5\u2009\u03bcM) on eIPSC was no longer different between the two genotypes after the FAAH treatment (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8d</a>), consistent with the fact that there is already an elevated AEA tone. Importantly, the effect of the MGL inhibitor JZL184 was not altered in PAK1 KO mice; that is, bath application of JZL184 (5\u2009\u03bcM) depressed eIPSC to the same degree in both WT and KO neurons (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8e</a>) and had no effects on the degree of disinhibition by AM251 (5\u2009\u03bcM) (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8f</a>). Therefore, we conclude that the increased inhibition of GABA transmission by eCB signaling in PAK1 KO mice is caused by reduced COX-2 expression and consequential elevation in AEA, but not 2-AG, signaling at GABA synapses in the CA1 region of the hippocampus."

Specifically, genetic or pharmacological disruption of PAK1 signaling reduces synaptic COX-2 levels and increases tonic AEA signaling to reduce constitutive GABAergic synaptic transmission in the hippocampus. Importantly, this effect of PAK1 disruption on GABA transmission is replicated by the direct application of a COX-2 inhibitor, which is also dependent on the activation of presynaptic CB1 receptors. While several reports have identified COX-2 as a regulator of eCB signaling, these data represent the first demonstration of a physiological substrate (PAK1 in this case), which can mobilize COX-2 to the synaptic compartment to modulate eCB signaling in real time. In addition, these data provide some of the first data regarding intracellular signaling mechanisms that can regulate tonic AEA signaling and, importantly, could potentially have significant implications for a wide range of pathologies that involve dysregulation of this cascade."

In fact, basal excitatory synaptic transmission is not altered in PAK1 KO mice, possibly due to the existence of other functionally redundant PAKs (e.g. PAK2 and PAK3) (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bokoch, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Huang et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Kelly and Chernoff, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Meng et al., 2005</a>). In contrast, disruptions of PAK1, either by genetic deletion or pharmacological blockade, dramatically reduces GABAergic transmission, indicating that the primary role of PAK1 is to facilitate inhibitory but not excitatory synaptic function. This selective effect of PAK1 disruption is rather surprising because it has been shown previously that expression of a dominant negative form (i.e. the autoinhibitory domain) of PAK1 affects the excitatory synaptic morphology (<a href=\"#bib16\">Hayashi et al., 2004</a>). One possible explanation is that the expression of this mutant PAK1 may affect other members of the PAK family, including PAK3, which is also highly expressed in the brain (<a href=\"#bib33\">Meng et al., 2005</a>). Indeed, the double KO mice lacking both PAK1 and PAK3 display severe deficits in spines and the actin cytoskeleton (<a href=\"#bib20\">Huang et al., 2011</a>). These results together suggest that while PAK1 and PAK3 are functionally redundant at the excitatory synapses, PAK1 is a unique regulator at the inhibitory synapses, which may not be readily replaced by other members of the PAK family. Therefore, the ability of the PAK1 inhibitors in ameliorating the deficits associated with models of fragile X syndrome and neurofibromatosis (<a href=\"#bib9\">Dolan et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Hayashi et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Molosh et al., 2014</a>)\u00a0may be mediated by its effect on the GABA function.

The reduction in the frequency is not caused by changes in the number of inhibitory neurons or synapses because none of these parameters are altered in the KO mice. The lack of changes in synapse number is also consistent with the observations that the frequency reduction can be rapidly induced (within mins) by infusion of the PAK1 inhibitors, a perturbation that is not likely to cause any changes in the number of neurons or synapses. Our data also indicate that although the frequency reduction is induced by postsynaptic inhibition of PAK1, it is independent of postsynaptic GABA receptors or the actin cytoskeleton. Therefore, postsynaptic PAK1 affects GABA transmission through a retrograde messenger to modulate neurotransmitter release. Several lines of evidence support that eCBs are the retrograde messenger to mediate such an effect here. First, the effect the CB1 receptor antagonist AM251 is greatly enhanced by the loss of PAK1; application of AM251 potentiates eIPSC three times greater in PAK1 KO or IPA3 treated neurons than in WT neurons. The simplest interpretation of this result is that loss of PAK1 results in increased tonic eCB signaling and therefore a greater inhibition of GABA release. Thus, blocking eCB inhibition causes a greater potentiation of GABA release and eIPSC in the absence of PAK1. There are at least two possibilities by which the eCB signaling can be enhanced: an increase in the signaling pool of eCB molecules and/or altered signaling processes triggered by activation of the CB1 receptors. Because neither the expression level of CB1 receptors nor the effect of a CB1 receptor agonist are enhanced, a straightforward interpretation would be that eCB secretion is elevated in the absence of PAK1. Consistent with this, biochemical analysis of hippocampi from PAK1 KO mice indicate a significant increase in the tissue level of the eCB AEA, but not 2-AG. While 2-AG has been found to mediate the majority of phasic eCB processes, such as DSI and LTD, AEA is believed to mediate the tonic signaling actions of the eCB system (<a href=\"#bib23\">Katona and Freund, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Morena et al., 2016</a>). As such, the selective increase in AEA is consistent with the fact that tonic, but not phasic, eCB signaling is enhanced by disruption of PAK1. In fact, a recent report has suggested that elevations in AEA signaling reduce the ability of 2-AG signaling to modulate GABAergic transmission in the hippocampus (<a href=\"#bib28\">Lee et al., 2015</a>), and again consistent with this finding, our data demonstrate that DSI, a measure of activity-dependent, phasic eCB signaling that is mediated by 2-AG, is reduced in PAK1 KO mice. Finally, PAK1 KO mice exhibit no alteration to the synaptic response of a 2-AG hydrolysis inhibitor, but do demonstrate reduced responses to a AEA-hydrolysis inhibitor, which is to be expected if PAK1 deletion selectively increases AEA, and not 2-AG, signaling. Taken together, these results suggest that PAK1 normally restricts tonic AEA level to enhance GABA release and maintains sufficient inhibitory transmission."

If PAK1 disruption reduced AEA hydrolysis, however, one would expect an occlusion to the addition of an AEA-hydrolysis inhibitor. As the latter, and not the former, is what the current data indicate, this leads us to investigate how PAK1 was modulating AEA clearance, not synthesis. FAAH is the primary enzyme responsible for AEA hydrolysis, however our biochemical analysis did not reveal any difference between total or synaptic expression of FAAH protein in PAK1 KO mice. A growing body of work has identified that aside from the canonical metabolism of AEA by FAAH, COX-2 represents an additional mechanism of AEA clearance (<a href=\"#bib14\">Glaser and Kaczocha, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Hermanson et al., 2013</a>). Notably, the impact of COX-2 inhibition on AEA levels (<a href=\"#bib18\">Hermanson et al., 2013</a>) is roughly comparable to the increase we documented herein in PAK1 KO mice. Consistent with this, we found that PAK1 KO mice did exhibit reductions in COX-2 protein. It is important to emphasize that only synaptic, but not total COX-2 is affected in PAK1 KO mice, implying that PAK1 is particularly important for COX-2 regulation at the synapse. Furthermore, although COX-2 is expressed at both excitatory and inhibitory synapses, the effect of PAK1 deletion on COX-2 appears to be specific to inhibitory synapses, which may contribute to the specific effect of PAK1-COX-2 signaling on inhibitory synaptic transmission. The mechanism by which PAK1 regulates COX-2 localization is unknown, but it is possible that local regulation of COX-2, both at the level of protein synthesis and/or trafficking, could be targeted by PAK1."

For example, PAK1 deletion has been shown to normalize synaptic and behavioral deficits in the Neurofibromatosis model of autism (<a href=\"#bib34\">Molosh et al., 2014</a>). Specifically, deletion of PAK1 resulted in a reduction of mIPSC in the amygdala (similar to what was found within the hippocampus within the current study) that was associated with an improvement in social behaviors (<a href=\"#bib34\">Molosh et al., 2014</a>). In line with this, elevating AEA signaling within the amygdala (which has been shown to dampen GABA release in the amygdala [<a href=\"#bib2\">Azad et al., 2004</a>]) has been shown to improve social interaction and increase social behavior (<a href=\"#bib45\">Trezza et al., 2012</a>). More so, a recent report has indicated that the neuroligin-3 mutation related to autism causes a disruption in tonic eCB signaling within the hippocampus (<a href=\"#bib11\">F\u00f6ldy et al., 2013</a>), resulting in an increase in GABA release and a shift in the E/I balance of the hippocampus that is the exact opposite of what was produced by PAK1 disruption. Finally, PAK1 disruption has also been shown to normalize behavioral changes in the Fragile X model of autism (<a href=\"#bib9\">Dolan et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Hayashi et al., 2007</a>), which parallels recent behavioral work similarly demonstrating that administration of AEA, but not 2-AG, hydrolysis inhibitors, can normalize some of the same behavioral deficits seen in Fragile X mice (<a href=\"#bib40\">Qin et al., 2015</a>). Taken together, while speculative at this time, these data collectively create a compelling picture that impairments in tonic AEA signaling may relate to the pathology of neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism, and that inhibition of PAK1 may exert its potentially beneficial effects by enhancing tonic AEA signaling. Future research will need to investigate this mechanism more directly, but these data establish a framework to approach this question. More so, as PAK1 has been associated with other disease states (<a href=\"#bib13\">Gilman et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Kelly and Chernoff, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Kumar et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Ma et al., 2012</a>),\u00a0the relationship between PAK1, COX-2 and AEA signaling could prove to be highly relevant for a wide array of pathological processes, given that COX-2 and AEA have similarly been implicated in the etiology of these disease processes (<a href=\"#bib19\">Hermanson et al., 2014</a>)."

Briefly, mouse brains were quickly dissected and transferred to ice-cold artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) saturated with 95% O2/5% CO2 and sliced to 360\u2009\u03bcm sagittal slices. The slices were recovered at 32\u00b0C for at least 2\u2009hrs before a single slice was transferred to the recording chamber. ACSF contained (in mM): 120 NaCl, 3.0 KCl, 1.0 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 26 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 11 D-glucose, 2.0 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 1.2 MgSO<sub>4</sub>. To obtain evoked synaptic responses, the stimulation electrode was placed near the stratum pyramidal layer of the CA1 area to execute 0.1Hz stimulation. Whole cell recordings were performed under the voltage clamp mode with a holding potential of \u221270\u00a0mV except in those to construct I/V curves of synaptic currents. Series resistance was monitored by a \u22123\u00a0mV step throughout the entire experiment of whole cell access and if it fluctuated more than 20%, the data were excluded from the analysis. For the E/I ratio experiments, slices were first perfused by ACSF to record total postsynaptic current (PSC) for 10\u2009min, then 10\u2009\u03bcM NBQX/50\u2009\u03bcM APV were added to specifically record inhibitory postsynaptic current (IPSC), and finally 100\u2009\u03bcM picrotoxin was added to verify the inhibitory response. The E/I ratio was calculated as (PSC-IPSC)/IPSC. Spontaneous IPSC (sIPSC) and miniature IPSC(mIPSC) were recorded by including 10\u2009\u03bcM NBQX plus 50\u2009\u03bcM APV with or without 1\u2009\u03bcM TTX in ACSF respectively. Spontaneous EPSC (sEPSC) and miniature EPSC (mEPSC) were recorded with 100\u2009\u03bcM picrotoxin with or without 1\u00a0\u03bcM TTX respectively. For the E/I ratio and s/mIPSC/EPSC (except sIPSC with NSC) experiments, whole-cell recordings were made using glass pipettes (3\u20135 M\u03a9) filled with an intracellular solution containing (in mM): 130 CsMeSO<sub>4</sub>, 5 NaCl, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.05 EGTA, 10 HEPES, 1 Mg-ATP, 0.3 Na<sub>3</sub>-GTP, and 5 QX-314 (pH 7.25) (280\u2013300 mOsm), and for all other measurements, the recordings were made with an intracellular solution containing (in mM): 110\u2009K-gluconate, 25 KCl, 10 Na<sub>2</sub>-creatine phosphate, 0.2 EGTA, 10 HEPES, 2 Mg-ATP and 0.3 Na<sub>3</sub>-GTP(pH 7.25) (280\u2013300 mOsm) (<a href=\"#bib15\">Hashimotodani et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Huang and Woolley, 2012</a>). Some of the experiments were repeated in a high Cl intracellular solution containing (in mM): 130 CsCl, 5 NaCl, 10 HEPES, 0.5 EGTA, 5 QX314, 4 Mg-ATP and 0.3 Na<sub>3</sub>-GTP (pH 7.2\u20137.4) (280 mOsm) and similar results were obtained, but the data were not included in this study. For whole cell infusion of chemical inhibitors (e.g. peptide, IPA3, and NSC23766), the stock solutions or control vehicle were added to the intracellular solution right before the start of the experiments. The sequence of the PAK1 inhibitory peptides are as follows: active peptide: KKEKERPEISLPSDFEHT; ctrl peptide: GPPARNPRSPVQPPP (final concentration at 20\u00a0\u03bcg/ml, Genscript). For the DSI experiments, the stimulation frequency was increased to 0.33\u00a0Hz and the depolarization was from \u221270\u00a0mV to 0\u00a0mV lasting 5 s. For the FAAH inhibitor URB597 experiments, the summary graphs (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8c,d</a>) represented pooled data from both females and males (the ratio of females vs males was balanced between WT and PAK1 KO mice). Because the effect of URB597 is more prominent in female rats (<a href=\"#bib44\">Tabatadze et al., 2015</a>), we also repeated the URB597 experiment shown in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8c</a> in female mice only and the result was the same as the pooled data (data not shown). Synaptic depression in response to sustained high frequency stimulation was induced by 5\u2009Hz lasting 3\u00a0min. All data acquisition and analysis were done with pCLAMP and MiniAnalysis programs. All evoked data were normalized to the average of the baseline response."

Confocal images were obtained on Zeiss LSM 700 at 2048 \u00d7 2048 pixels using Zeiss 63\u00d7 (NA 1.4) objective under the same settings and configurations within each experiment. ImageJ (NIH) software was used for measurements of total fluorescence intensity and puncta staining. 10x30\u2009\u03bcm sections of primary dendrites were randomly taken for puncta (with an area of greater than 0.1\u00a0\u03bcm<sup>2</sup>) counting. All images were analyzed by experimenters blind to the treatment or genotype of the images. For each experiment, 3 independent cultures from three animals were used for analysis."

Each reviewer provided several positive comments on the study and commented that there are innovative molecular insights into how endocannabinoid signaling is regulated in the hippocampus. The finding that PAK1 limits endocannabinoid signaling through tonic GABAergic transmission is of interest. However, there were several major concerns that were brought up by the reviewers that dampened enthusiasm."

The second half of the paper focuses on the role of COX-2 as a downstream mediator of PAK1. The reviewers indicated that the data to support a COX-2 mechanism could be strengthened. For example, the western blot data in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a> is not entirely convincing. A major issue is the need for additional support for the localization of COX-2. In particular, there needs to be additional evidence to show COX-2 is working specifically at GABAergic synapses. A related issue is more evidence should be provided for the regulation of COX-2 and how also PAK1 changes COX-2 localization. One suggestion is that PAK1 should be co-localized with gephyrin and PSD-95, as a comparison."

The authors first found that PAK1 deletion or postsynaptic acute inhibition reduced inhibitory transmission via a presynaptic mechanism, thus increasing E/I balance in CA1 hippocampal neurons. Although they found canonical signaling downstream of PAK1, including actin cytoskeletal remodeling, was not involved in the modulation of GABAergic transmission induced by PAK1 deletion, their data implicate endocannabinoid signaling in this process. In support of this novel mechanism, CB1 blockade reveals a larger endocannabinoid tone at CA1 GABAergic synapses after PAK1 deletion or acute postsynaptic pharmacological inhibition. In addition, AEA but not 2-AG levels were increased in PAK1 KO mice. No changes in CB1 receptor function or expression were observed. Based on these data the authors conclude disruption of PAK1 augments AEA tonic signaling to dampen constitutive GABA release. The data to this point are rigorous and compelling and provide a novel molecular mechanism regulating tonic endocannabinoid signaling at CA1 hippocampal GABAergic synapses."

In addition, PAK1 was also colocalized with COX-2 (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C</a>). Second, we showed that COX-2 was colocalized with PSD95 (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9D</a>), indicating that COX-2 was also expressed at excitatory synapses, but the amount of COX-2 colocalized with PSD95 was not altered in PAK1 KO compared to WT neurons (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9D-H</a>).

We have not been able to analyze the phosphorylation level of COX-2 because we do not have access to phospho-specific antibodies against COX-2."

Neurosci. 37 (2008) 682-695). Also, COX-2 is not selective for anandamide (Kozak et al., J. Biol. Chem. 275, 33744-33749, 2000; Kozak et al., J. Biol. Chem 277, 44877-44885, 2002).</i>"

                    "text": "See response to specific demand #1 for explanation of specific effect of PAK1 deletion on GABAergic responses. In brief, although PAK1 and COX-2 are present at both excitatory and inhibitory synapses (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>), the effect of PAK1 deletion on COX-2 expression appears to be specific to COX-2 at the inhibitory synapse (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>). Thus, the level of colocalization of COX-2 with gephyrin, but not with PSD95, was reduced in PAK1 KO compared to WT neurons (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>). Therefore, although COX-2 may function at both inhibitory and excitatory synapses as shown in Yang et al., Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 37 (2008) 682-695, PAK1 deletion leads to reduced COX-2 only at the inhibitory synapse, thus only reduced IPSC, but not EPSC, was observed in PAK1 KO mice. In the present study, the effects of PAK1 deletion and reduced COX-2 expression seem to relate to an exclusive elevation in AEA signalling, but not 2-AG (based on both biochemical analysis of endocannabinoid content and the occlusion of the effects of a FAAH inhibitor, but not a MAGL inhibitor). While the references the reviewer has included do demonstrate that COX-2 has the ability to regulate 2-AG signalling, the work of the Patel and Marnett group examining COX-2 regulation of endocannabinoid signalling (Hermanson et al., 2013 16, 1291-98) has demonstrated that the magnitude of the effect of COX-2 inhibition of AEA signalling is far more robust than what is seen for 2-AG signalling. In fact, the increase in 2-AG content from COX-2 inhibition was only about 5%, while the increase in AEA content was more than double of baseline values (Hermanson et al., 2013). Thus, while we cannot entirely exclude the possibility that the ability of COX-2 activity is capable of producing subtle alterations in 2-AG signalling, our data are consistent with the reports of Hermanson and colleagues in that the impact of reducing COX-2 activity is much more profound for AEA signalling than 2-AG signalling. Alternatively, other pathways targeting COX-2 that are independent of PAK1 may function to regulate 2-AG and these pathways are not altered in PAK1 KO mice. It would be interesting to identify these pathways in the future."

These results suggest that PAK1 regulates COX-2 not likely through affecting its transcription or translation, but rather post-translation mechanisms (such as protein trafficking) specifically at the synapse. The exact mechanism by which PAK1 regulates synaptic COX-2 is unclear, but is not likely through a direct protein-protein interaction because we were not able to show that PAK1 and COX-2 exist in one immunocomplex in the Co-IP experiments."
