To elucidate the mechanisms by which the translational machinery adapts to such changes, we perturbed the tRNA pool of <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> by tRNA gene deletion. We then evolved the deletion strain and observed that the genetic adaptation was recurrently based on a strategic mutation that changed the anticodon of other tRNA genes to match that of the deleted one. Strikingly, a systematic search in hundreds of genomes revealed that anticodon mutations occur throughout the tree of life. We further show that the evolution of the tRNA pool also depends on the need to properly couple translation to protein folding. Together, our observations shed light on the evolution of the tRNA pool, demonstrating that mutation in the anticodons of tRNA genes is a common adaptive mechanism when meeting new translational demands."

To elucidate the mechanisms by which the translational machinery adapts to such changes, we perturbed the tRNA pool of <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> by tRNA gene deletion. We then evolved the deletion strain and observed that the genetic adaptation was recurrently based on a strategic mutation that changed the anticodon of other tRNA genes to match that of the deleted one. Strikingly, a systematic search in hundreds of genomes revealed that anticodon mutations occur throughout the tree of life. We further show that the evolution of the tRNA pool also depends on the need to properly couple translation to protein folding. Together, our observations shed light on the evolution of the tRNA pool, demonstrating that mutation in the anticodons of tRNA genes is a common adaptive mechanism when meeting new translational demands."

And since there are only 20 amino acids, two or more different codons can specify the same amino acid (for example, AGU and AGC both specify serine), and two or more different transfer RNA molecules can take this amino acid to the ribosome. Moreover, some codons are found more often than others in the messenger RNA molecules, so the genes that encode the related transfer RNA molecules are more common than the genes for other transfer RNA molecules."

At first this mutation resulted in slower growth of the yeast cells, but after being allowed to evolve over 200 generations, the rate of growth matched that of a normal strain with all transfer RNA genes. Yona et al. found that the gene for a more common transfer RNA molecule, corresponding to the codon AGA, which also specifies arginine, had mutated to AGG. As a result, the mutated yeast was eventually able to produce proteins as quickly as wild type yeast. Moreover, further experiments showed that the levels of some transfer RNAs are kept deliberately low in order to slow down the production of proteins so as to ensure that the proteins assume their correct structure."

Although differential use of codons can be the result of neutral processes such as mutational biases and the genomic GC content (<a href=\"#bib66\">Urrutia and Hurst, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Rao et al., 2011</a>), natural selection also influences codon usage bias. Indeed, it has been demonstrated that codon choice affects expression level, protein folding, translational accuracy, and other translational features (<a href=\"#bib1\">Akashi, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Parmley and Hurst, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Zhou et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Hudson et al., 2011</a>). Since both neutral and selective processes govern codon usage bias, the balance between selection, mutational bias and drift is crucial in shaping the codon usage of each species (<a href=\"#bib9\">Bulmer, 1991</a>). Importantly, although the selective advantage offered by alternative synonymous codons is considered to be moderate, it was recently demonstrated that selection can still shape codon usage patterns in vertebrates even with their small effective population sizes (<a href=\"#bib17\">Doherty and McInerney, 2013</a>)."

Importantly, it has been experimentally observed for <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> (<a href=\"#bib65\">Tuller et al., 2010</a>) and <i>Escherichia coli</i> (<a href=\"#bib18\">Dong et al., 1996</a>) that the cellular concentrations of each tRNA family in the cell (i.e., the tRNA pool) correlate with its genomic tRNA copy number (<a href=\"#bib47\">Percudani et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Kanaya et al., 1999</a>). Notably, the rate-limiting step of polypeptide elongation is the recruitment of a tRNA that matches the translated codon (<a href=\"#bib67\">Varenne et al., 1984</a>).

It was previously suggested that translational selection acts to maintain a balance between codon usage and tRNA availability. On the one hand, there is a selective pressure to increase the frequency of preferred codons in highly expressed genes. On the other hand, changes in the tRNA pool may also occur, for example duplication of tRNA genes for which high codon demand exists. Thus, codon frequencies and tRNA copy numbers coevolve toward a supply versus demand balance that facilitates optimal protein production (<a href=\"#bib24\">Higgs and Ran, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Gingold et al., 2012</a>)."

Encoding genes with optimal codons might not always lead to higher protein expression levels (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kudla et al., 2009</a>). Similarly, the use of \u2018slow codons\u2019 may not always result in lower levels of protein expression as they could have functional roles in improving expression, for example when enriched at the beginning of a transcript in order to reduce the energy of the RNA structure (<a href=\"#bib23\">Goodman et al., 2013</a>) or to efficiently allocate ribosomes along the mRNA (<a href=\"#bib65\">Tuller et al., 2010</a>). Additionally, it has been proposed that non-optimal codons may play a role in governing the process of cotranslational folding by slowing down translation, which supports proper folding between domain boundaries (<a href=\"#bib63\">Thanaraj, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Kramer et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Cabrita et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Wilke and Drummond, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Pechmann and Frydman, 2012</a>).

To this end, we genetically perturbed the tRNA pool of the budding yeast <i>S. cerevisiae</i>. In this yeast, the genetic code is decoded by 42 different tRNA families that make up a total of 274 tRNA genes (<a href=\"#bib12\">Chan and Lowe, 2009</a>). Each tRNA gene family ranges from 1\u201316 copies, with 6 tRNA families consisting of only a single copy. In a recent study (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bloom-Ackermann et al., In press</a>), we have systematically manipulated the tRNA pool in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> by individually deleting most tRNA genes from its genome. Here, we focus on one particular deletion strain that showed the most extreme fitness reduction among the viable deletion mutants in this tRNA deletion library. This tRNA exists in only one copy in the genome, thus after its deletion the cell is left without a tRNA with the corresponding anticodon. Lab-evolution experiments performed on this strain demonstrated that the translational balance was rapidly restored by mutations in other tRNA genes that compensated for the tRNA deletion. An extensive bioinformatic analysis revealed that a similar evolutionary trend is widespread in nature too, suggesting that the anticodon mutations we observed in the lab recapitulate an existing mechanism that shapes the tRNA pool. To shed light on the constraints that shape the size of tRNA gene families, we artificially overexpressed singleton tRNAs, rather than deleting them. We found that when low copy tRNAs were overexpressed, the protein quality control machinery was challenged due to increased proteotoxic stress. This observation suggests that low tRNA availability for particular codon can serve an essential means to ensure proper cotranslation folding of proteins."

To confirm that a single point mutation in the anticodon of tRNA<sup>Arg</sup><sub>UCU</sub> is sufficient to fully compensate for the growth defect of \u0394tRNA<sup>Arg</sup><sub>CCU</sub>, we artificially inserted the same T\u2192C mutation into the deletion \u0394tRNA<sup>Arg</sup><sub>CCU</sub> mutant.

A complete deletion of this gene family is lethal, indicating that the tRNA<sup>Ser</sup><sub>GCU</sub> is essential in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>. Although we could not evolve that strain, we did find that this quadruple deletion strain was viable when supplemented with a centromeric plasmid carrying the tRNA<sup>Ser</sup><sub>GCU</sub> gene. Thus, the lethality is conferred directly from the tRNA loss and is not due to other indirect effects (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We hypothesized that, as with tRNA<sup>Arg</sup><sub>CCU</sub>, other chimeric serine tRNAs that carry a GCU anticodon, yet with the scaffold of another tRNA for serine, would also prevent the observed lethality. Indeed, a strain carrying a chimeric tRNA with a scaffold of tRNA<sup>Ser</sup><sub>CGA</sub> and the GCU anticodon is viable on the background of the tRNA<sup>Ser</sup><sub>GCU</sub>-family deletion (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Therefore, we concluded that the identity of the anticodon is essential for the function of the tRNA<sup>Ser</sup><sub>GCU</sub> gene family.

To address this question, we performed a systematic bioinformatics screen for tRNA switching events in nature. We defined an anticodon-switching event as a case of a tRNA whose nucleotide sequence is closer to a tRNA gene with a different anticodon than to a tRNA gene with the same anticodon. To this end, we downloaded all the known tRNA sequences from the Genomic tRNA Database (<a href=\"#bib12\">Chan and Lowe, 2009</a>), a collection that stores the tRNA pools of 524 species. We masked the anticodon triplet as \u2018NNN\u2019 in all tRNA genes, aligned all tRNA sequences from each species individually and inferred a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree for each alignment. For each tRNA sequence, we calculated the shortest phylogenetic distance to another tRNA with the same anticodon (designated d<sub>same</sub>) and the shortest distance to another tRNA with a different anticodon (designated d<sub>diff</sub>). For each species, we defined its set of tRNA switching events as those in which d<sub>diff</sub><d<sub>same</d<sub> (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 1</a>)."

In the first example, the phylogeny of tRNA sequences with glutamic acid anticodons is presented (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Notably, six out of the eight tRNAs with a UUC anticodon in <i>M. musculus</i> were clustered together in our analysis, while two other copies of the same anticodon identity were clustered closer to tRNA genes with a CUC anticodon (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). The second example demonstrates a switching event for tRNA genes encoding for valine anticodons. In this study, a tRNA with a UAC anticodon was clustered with CAC and AAC tRNA genes and not with the other four UAC tRNAs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D,E</a>). Interestingly, the CAC and AAC tRNA genes are intermixed in the tree, suggesting that anticodon switching was prevalent in the evolution of CAC and AAC tRNA genes in <i>H. sapiens</i> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D,E</a>). Also of interest, the switching events shown in mouse were not found in human and vice versa. Thus, in each of these two mammals the switching examples shown here probably occurred after they split from their common ancestor. In general, inspecting the relationship across species between the size of the tRNA pool and the number of detected switching events revealed a modest correlation, and in particular species with same size of tRNA repertoire manifested tRNA switching to different extents (not shown). This analysis suggests that future examination of the tRNA switching phenomenon in individual species could be of interest."

The switching events that we observed (from tRNA<sup>Arg</sup><sub>UCU</sub> to tRNA<sup>Arg</sup><sub>CCU</sub>) suggest that the effective gene copy number of each tRNA anticodon set can change during evolution, presumably due to demand-to-supply changes. Given that a single point mutation can functionally convert one tRNA into another, an interesting question emerges: why does the genome maintain a single copy of tRNA<sup>Arg</sup><sub>CCU</sub>? T to C mutations must have occurred in evolution but they appear to have been selected against so as to preserve only a single copy of the CCU anticodon tRNA. Consistent with this hypothesis is the observation that other yeast species maintain tRNA<sup>Arg</sup><sub>CCU</sub> at a single copy (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 1C</a>). We thus reasoned that an artificial increase in the copy number of a rare tRNA, but not of an abundant one, might result in a deleterious effect on the cells."

Fluorescently tagged VHL that is present as aggregated puncta (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), and not as a disperse cytosolic localization (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>), indicates that the protein quality control machinery is saturated due to high levels of misfolding in the cell\u2019s endogenous proteins.

In our evolution experiments, a translational imbalance was imposed by a tRNA gene deletion that compromised growth and drove the tRNA pool to adapt to a novel translational demand. Importantly, organisms may experience equivalent imbalances when their gene expression changes due to altered environmental conditions or upon migrating to a new ecological niche (<a href=\"#bib22\">Gingold et al., 2012</a>). This scenario is particularly feasible given that the genes needed in various environments do show differences in codon usage, for example respiration as opposed to fermentation in yeast (<a href=\"#bib37\">Man and Pilpel, 2007</a>)."

To maintain optimal protein production, the tRNA pool is under pressure to restore the translational balance by accommodating the new translational demands. On a short timescale, the tRNA pool might respond non-genetically by changing expression profiles of the tRNAs (<a href=\"#bib65\">Tuller et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Saikia et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Pavon-Eternod et al., 2013a</a>, <a href=\"#bib45\">2013b</a>). Yet, if changes in demand-to-supply persist, a genetic change in the tRNA pool might become beneficial evolutionarily. In this work, we demonstrate how anticodon mutations provide a rapid mechanism to alter the tRNA pool. We propose that during evolution, novel translational requirements can be addressed by anticodon shifting of tRNA copies more readily than by duplications and deletions of tRNA genes. The tRNA pool can evolve to meet new translation demands by adjusting the ratios of tRNA families that code for the same amino acid. Within a single mutational event, anticodon switching holds the potential to rapidly change the ratios of tRNAs within the pool, by increasing the copy number of one tRNA family at the expense of a counterpart. A similar solution could be obtained by a sequence of genomic duplications and deletions of tRNA genes. These alternatives are likely to fixate less frequently than anticodon switching, as they may carry negative effects due to duplications or deletions of adjacent unrelated genetic features. Furthermore, our systematic search for tRNA switching events throughout the tree of life revealed the prevalence of tRNA anticodon mutations in nature. This observation is consistent with the results of our lab-evolution experiment and may be the evolutionary outcome to novel translational demands in the wild."

Yet, the initiator and the elongator represent extreme cases of tRNAs that are used at different stages in translation. The present chimeric tRNAs that emerged in our lab-evolution experiments successfully replaced the deleted tRNA, despite differences in 20 nucleotide positions between the 2 tRNA scaffolds. If tRNA scaffolds are interchangeable in terms of the effect of their function on the fitness, what can explain the high sequence similarity observed among tRNA gene copies of the same family in yeast? It is possible that the sequence of the tRNA scaffold is indeed important under specific conditions that were not examined in this work, or that our measurements were not sensitive enough to detect small selective disadvantages that can act against chimeric tRNAs in nature. Under these scenarios, the high sequence similarity can be explained by purifying selection that maintains sequence identity within tRNA families. Yet, there is also a possibility that the sequence similarity is not due to purifying selection but the result of \u2018concerted evolution\u2019, an evolutionary process that maintains sequence identity by frequent recombination events among copies of the same gene family (<a href=\"#bib41\">Munz et al., 1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Amstutz et al., 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Teshima and Innan, 2004</a>). This possibility implies that the high conservation observed within tRNA gene families is not due to functionality, but is rather the result of neutral evolution. At present, it is not possible to determine which of the two possibilities explains best the observed sequence identity."

In contrast, we took a different approach, in which no protein coding gene sequence is modified, but rather the tRNA supply is manipulated. Thus, the effect we generated could be exerted on all genes, and we could indeed detect it as a global proteotoxic stress in the cell. Our observations are consistent with the theory that programmed pauses in the translation process could promote proper folding during translation (<a href=\"#bib63\">Thanaraj, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Kramer et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Cabrita et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Wilke and Drummond, 2010</a>). The overexpression of the rare tRNA could have thus impaired with cotranslation folding. Yet, there could be additional reasons for the observed proteotoxic stress, which are not necessarily mutually exclusive. First, overexpression of tRNA<sup>Arg</sup><sub>CCU</sub> may result in misincorporation of arginine into non-arginine codons. Second, other aminoacyl tRNA synthetases may aminoacylate an incorrect amino acid to the highly expressed tRNA. Misloading will result in the incorporation of a different amino acid instead of arginine. A potential part of the observed proteotoxic stress due to misincorporation still remains to be studied. Yet, such an effect should be relevant not only for the overexpression of the rare tRNA<sup>Arg</sup><sub>CCU</sub> but also for the overexpression of the abundant tRNA<sup>Arg</sup><sub>UCU</sub>. Our results show a sever proteotoxic stress only upon expression of the rare tRNA, thus landing more support to the intriguing hypothesis, that the proteotoxic phenotypes observed are due to converting a slow translating codon, scattered in many genes in the genome, into a fast one. This notion is consistent with and complementary to the picture that emerges from single gene-based analyses."

Notably, the plasticity of the tRNA genes is constrained by the need to maintain proper protein folding (<a href=\"#bib20\">Drummond and Wilke, 2008</a>).

This assay provides an indication for the protein unfolding stress in cells by assessing the load on the protein quality control machinery. In this assay, the cells were introduced with a high copy number plasmid that contains the human gene VHL fused to a fluorescent tag (mCherry). VHL is a naturally unstructured protein and is dependent on two additional proteins (Elongin B and C) for proper folding in human cells. Expressing VHL in yeast cells, which lack VHL\u2019s complex partners, leads to misfolding of the translated proteins. Under normal conditions, the misfolded VHL proteins are handled by the cell\u2019s quality control machinery. When the quality control machinery is not saturated, the fluorescently tagged VHL appears in the cytosol. However, under stress, in which the quality control machinery is fully occupied, misfolded proteins in the cytosol are processed into dedicated inclusions (JUNQ and IPOD) and form punctum structures. Hence, a punctum phenotype of the VHL-mCherry construct is an indication for cells that experience proteotoxic stress and saturation of the protein quality control machinery."

The sequences in this database were discovered with the tRNAscan algorithm (<a href=\"#bib36\">Lowe and Eddy, 1997</a>), which finds tRNA sequences by scanning genomic DNA. We removed psuedogene tRNAs, which are defined as those tRNAs with a COVE score less than 40.0 (<a href=\"#bib36\">Lowe and Eddy, 1997</a>) . For each remaining tRNA sequence, we masked its anticodon triplet as \u2018NNN\u2019. We next grouped all tRNA sequences by their species, and then aligned the sequences for each species using Muscle with default settings (<a href=\"#bib21\">Edgar, 2004</a>). For each species, we inferred a maximum likelihood phylogeny of its tRNA sequences using RAxML with the GTRCAT model (<a href=\"#bib59\">Stamatakis, 2006</a>). We calculated statistical support for tree branches using SH-like approximate likelihood ratio test (<a href=\"#bib3\">Anisimova and Gascuel, 2006</a>). We next interrogated each species\u2019 tRNA phylogeny using DendroPy (<a href=\"#bib61\">Sukumaran and Holder, 2010</a>). Specifically, we identified those tRNA sequences harboring an anticodon that appears in the genome more than once; for each of these tRNA sequences, we found the shortest distance to another tRNA with the same anticodon (d<sub>same</sub>) and the shortest distance to another tRNA with a different anticodon (d<sub>diff</sub>).

The general consensus was that the results provide important new insights into the evolution of tRNAs and represents a nice example of the power of experimental evolution to provide novel biological insights. There are, however, several concerns about the writing and interpretation of a few things that we felt warranted revision. More generally, there was a concern that the paper felt like a loose collection of vignettes and better writing to integrate them would serve the reader well. Each of these concerns about the writing must be dealt with through changes in the text. There is also one experiment that is straightforward that would be necessary to bolster one of the primary claims made in the text (item #1 below) and one experiment (item #6 below) that a reviewer suggests (it's not essential, but could really enhance the paper).
