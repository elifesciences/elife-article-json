Reiterations of endothelial-tip-cell selection, sprout extension and anastomosis are the basis for vascular network generation, a process governed by the VEGF/Notch feedback loop. Here, we find that <i>temporal</i> regulation of this feedback loop, a previously unexplored dimension, is the key mechanism to determine vascular density. Iterating between <i>computational</i> modeling and in vivo live imaging, we demonstrate that the rate of tip-cell selection determines the length of linear sprout extension at the expense of branching, dictating network density. We provide the first example of a host tissue-derived signal (Semaphorin3E-Plexin-D1) that accelerates tip cell selection rate, yielding a dense network. We propose that <i>temporal</i> regulation of this critical, iterative aspect of network formation could be a general mechanism, and additional temporal regulators may exist to sculpt vascular topology."

Reiterations of endothelial-tip-cell selection, sprout extension and anastomosis are the basis for vascular network generation, a process governed by the VEGF/Notch feedback loop. Here, we find that <i>temporal</i> regulation of this feedback loop, a previously unexplored dimension, is the key mechanism to determine vascular density. Iterating between <i>computational</i> modeling and in vivo live imaging, we demonstrate that the rate of tip-cell selection determines the length of linear sprout extension at the expense of branching, dictating network density. We provide the first example of a host tissue-derived signal (Semaphorin3E-Plexin-D1) that accelerates tip cell selection rate, yielding a dense network. We propose that <i>temporal</i> regulation of this critical, iterative aspect of network formation could be a general mechanism, and additional temporal regulators may exist to sculpt vascular topology."

This feedback mechanism enables a new sprout to form by forcing cells present around a newly formed tip cell to become stalk cells.

                        "text": "The unique vascular topology of different organs exists for organ-specific functions. Different vascular network densities determine the specific amount of oxygen and nutrients to be delivered to each host tissue. Development of new vascular networks depends upon two types of specialized endothelial cells that work together: (1) The endothelial 'tip cell', which is located at the front of a growing vessel and guides its extension by sensing and responding to environmental cues, analogous to the axonal growth cone (<a href=\"#bib13\">Gerhardt et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Kurz et al., 1996</a>). (2) 'Stalk cells', which trail behind the tip cell and elongate the sprout. Tip and stalk cell identities are primarily controlled by the Dll4-Notch lateral inhibition pathway, which is activated in endothelial cells in response to VEGF from the local environment. VEGF-induced Dll4 activates Notch1 on the neighboring cell, leading to the down-regulation of VEGF receptor levels (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib18\">Hellstr\u00f6m et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Leslie et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Lobov et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Suchting et al., 2007</a>),(<a href=\"#bib4\">Benedito et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Phng et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Roca and Adams, 2007</a>). Thus, lateral inhibition between endothelial cells generates an alternating pattern of active tip cells (Dll4 high) and inhibited stalk cells (Dll4 low). Moreover, tip cell selection is a dynamic process, and tip cell identity is transient (<a href=\"#bib2\">Arima et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Jakobsson et al., 2010</a>). Reiteration of tip cell selection, sprout extension, and connection of neighboring sprouts (anastomosis) is the basis for building a sophisticated vascular network (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adams and Eichmann, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Carmeliet, 2000</a>). Although this VEGF/Notch signaling pathway has been well studied and found to be conserved among different vascular beds and species, how this central pattern generator is modified by various target tissue-specific signals to yield diverse network topologies is not known."

Integrated simulations predict that as cell neighborhoods change, due to anastomosis or cell rearrangement events, lateral inhibition patterns will necessarily be disrupted, requiring continual re-selection of new tip cells (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bentley et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">2014a</a>). In fact, mouse genetics experiments demonstrated that tip cell numbers are positively correlated with the branching points of the network (<a href=\"#bib18\">Hellstr\u00f6m et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Kim et al., 2011</a>). Therefore, the <i>length of time</i> it takes to establish (and re-establish) the alternating pattern of tip and stalk cells may be a missing, critical determinant of vascular topology (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bentley et al., 2014b</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">2014c</a>). Here, we took an integrated approach combining computational modeling, mouse genetics, and in vivo endothelial cell tracking to determine whether tip/stalk patterning can be temporally modulated to generate different topologies. We hypothesize that the frequency of tip cell selection determines the length of linear extension vs. branching, thus dictating the density of the network."

Previously, we used static analyses of the postnatal mouse retina as a model to understand how neural signals shape vascular topology (<a href=\"#bib21\">Kim et al., 2011</a>). We discovered that retina ganglion cell-derived Semaphorin3E (Sema3E) and its receptor Plexin-D1, which is expressed in endothelial cells at the front of actively sprouting blood vessels, control the VEGF/Notch pathway via a feedback mechanism. Mice lacking either Sema3E or Plexin-D1 exhibited an uneven vascular growth front and a reduction of tip cells that resulted in a less branched network compared to their wildtype littermate controls (<a href=\"#bib21\">Kim et al., 2011</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). However, it is not clear how this phenotype is generated: specifically, how the Sema3E-Plexin-D1 feedback mechanism regulates VEGF/Notch signaling at a dynamic cellular level, and whether changes in temporal modulation of this pathway lead to the overall vascular topology phenotype."

                        "text": "To begin to understand how Sema3E-Plexin-D1 signaling modifies vascular topology formation in a dynamic, spatiotemporal manner, we took advantage of an existing agent-based computational model (the 'MemAgent-Spring Model' or MSM) that simulates the cellular processes during tip cell selection making explicit the time it takes for gene expression (e.g. transcription/translation) changes to occur (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a> \u2013 note time delay parameters D1 and D2) (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bentley et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">2009</a>). The MSM has been tested against numerous independent experimental data sets and validated as predictive of new mechanisms in vivo/in vitro (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bentley et al., 2014a</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Guarani et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Jakobsson et al., 2010</a>). To now simulate tip cell selection in the context of Sema3E-Plexin-D1 crosstalk signaling with VEGF/Notch signaling (<a href=\"#bib12\">Fukushima et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Kim et al., 2011</a>) the MSM model was extended by adding four new parameters (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>\u2013<a href=\"#media5\">5</a>), with sensitivity analyses and calibration simulations performed, which include modulation of the existing parameter (\u03b4) representing the induction level of Dll4 by VEGFR-2 activation (See methods section). These four new parameters represent the time delay for induction of Plexin-D1 by VEGF (D3), the time delay (D4) and strength (s) of the reduction of Dll4 levels in response to Sema3E-Plexin-D1 signaling, based on the experimental data previously shown\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib21\">Kim et al., 2011</a>), as well as the degradation rate of Plexin-D1 (r3). Loss of Sema3E-PlexinD1 signaling was simulated by setting all Plexin-D1 levels to zero. Loss of function simulations recapitulated the two prominent features of <i>Plxnd1<sup>-/-</sup></i> and <i>Sema3e<sup>-/-</sup></i> mutant retinal vasculature remarkably closely: In vivo, mutant vascular networks exhibit fewer tip cells and 1.5\u20132 fold reduction in branching points, as well as an uneven growth front (compare <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> with 1C [red boxes]) (<a href=\"#bib21\">Kim et al., 2011</a>). Furthermore, the dynamic nature of the simulations provided a novel insight to explain how this phenotype is generated. Simulations predict that higher Dll4 levels in the cells generates a shift towards synchronized Dll4 fluctuations overtime in contiguous cells, as they collectively battle more strongly via lateral inhibition negative feedback, causing an overall delay in amplification of differences needed to select the alternating pattern of tip and stalk cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C\u2013E</a>, <a href=\"#media6\">Video 6</a>,<a href=\"#media7\">7</a>). Therefore, computational simulations suggest that Sema3E-Plexin-D1 signaling enhances the speed and frequency of tip cell selection and thus increases the density of retinal vascular networks."

A <i>Plxnd1<sup>-/-</sup></i> cell will behave differently in competition with a second <i>Plxnd1<sup>-/-</sup></i> cell than in competition with a wildtype cell. Thus, we investigated whether the cell autonomous function of Sema3E-Plexin-D1 signaling in the direct competition process between two neighboring endothelial cells can drive changes to the tip cell selection dynamics. In a simulated mosaic vessel, where cells lacking Sema3E-Plexin-D1 signaling are intermingled with normal cells, the contribution of cells lacking Sema3E-Plexin-D1 signaling to the tip cell population was predicted to increase to 68\u201374% (robustly across a range of parameter values: \u03b4 =4\u20136, s=2\u20134) in comparison to control cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>, <a href=\"#media8\">Video 8</a>), with an increased speed of patterning compared to a vessel entirely lacking Sema3E-Plexin-D1 signaling. This result suggests that normally, Plexin-D1 cell-autonomously suppresses the tip cell phenotype."

In the sprouting front of the wildtype retina, cells expressing Plexin-D1 were equally distributed at both tip cell and the adjacent stalk cell positions (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, left panel, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>), showing they have no preference for either position. However, at approximately 45% of <i>Plxnd1<sup>-/-</sup></i> mosaicism, 75% of the <i>Plxnd1<sup>-/-</sup></i> cells became tip cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, middle panel, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>) indicating that these cells do have a competitive advantage over Plexin-D1 expressing wildtype cells during tip cell selection. In contrast, in control experiments using mice with tamoxifen inducible expression of GFP (<i>Cdh5-Cre-ER<sup>T2</sup>; Z/EG<sup>+</sup></i>), GFP positive cells showed no preference for either position (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, right panel, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>), demonstrating that preferential tip cell occupancy of mutant cells is due to lack of Sema3E-Plexin-D1 signaling. Taken together, in silico prediction and in vivo mosaic retinal analyses demonstrate that Sema3E-Plexin-D1 signaling suppresses the tip cell phenotype in a cell-autonomous manner. Interestingly, this cell-autonomous effect at single cell level contrasts with the effect of Sema3E-Plexin-D1 signaling at the collective level, where more new tip cells are selected in the presence than in the absence of Sema3E-Plexin-D1 signaling (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). This finding highlights the differences between collective and cell autonomous behaviors, and the challenge of intuiting one from the other."

Here, we used a new 'MSM-CPM' model that has been previously extended, parameterized and experimentally validated to simulate tip/stalk patterning together with cellular rearrangements within a vascular sprout (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bentley et al., 2014a</a>). In this model, a cell can move within the adhered collective of the sprout powered by multiple local junctional movements. By incorporating the newly calibrated Sema3E-PlexinD1 signaling extension the MSM-CPM model we simulated cell rearrangements in vascular sprouts in the presence or absence of Sema3E-Plexin-D1 signaling (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>, <a href=\"#media9\">Video 9</a>,<a href=\"#media10\">10</a>). Simulations predicted that in the presence of Sema3E-Plexin-D1 signaling, the tip cell is repeatedly overtaken by another cell. In contrast, in the absence of Sema3E-Plexin-D1 signaling, tip cell overtaking frequency is reduced by factor of 1.26; a given tip cell occupies the tip cell position for a longer time (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Given the MSM is a qualitative not quantitative model we also performed simulations over a range of parameters and found that if the strength of Dll4 upregulation by VEGF (\u03b4) is increased then this delay in overtaking is further exaggerated; a given tip cell occupies the tip cell position longer (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>)."

Previously, live imaging with single cell resolution has mainly been described in sprouting assays using aortic rings (<a href=\"#bib2\">Arima et al., 2011</a>) or embryoid bodies (EBs) generated from ES cells (<a href=\"#bib19\">Jakobsson et al., 2010</a>). However, those assays primarily give rise to simple linear sprouts with less frequent branching than observed during retinal angiogenesis. To better mimic in vivo temporal and spatial events within a highly branched network, we developed a new ex vivo system, using explants from embryonic lungs. Whole embryonic lungs (E12.0) were embedded within a collagen matrix in a tissue culture dish containing medium supplemented with recombinant human VEGF. After one day, endothelial sprouts grow out of the explant (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>) with tip cells extending filopodia into the collagen matrix (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). We observed branching events at various positions of the sprouts (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), as well as anastomosis (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>), showing that all steps of the in vivo\u00a0angiogenic sprouting process are recapitulated in our system even though there is no gradient of VEGF signaling. Lung explants endogenously express <i>Sema3e</i> and <i>Plxnd1</i> (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). We could also detect Plexin-D1 and Dll4 in sprouting endothelial cells (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1E,F</a>). We next performed long-term live imaging of wildtype and <i>Plxnd1<sup>-/-</sup></i> explants and analyzed tip cell selection frequency. In contrast to the computational model where a tip cell selection event can only occur via a switch between two cells at the tip of the sprout (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>), in the live imaging assay, tip cell selection events occur in the following distinct categories (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>): a positional switch between a tip and a stalk cell in a linear sprout (switch), the selection of a new tip cell at the front of the sprout (branch, type I) or at more proximal sites (branch, type II). Single cells were tracked manually using a nuclear live stain. Consistent with the computational model prediction, in vivo live imaging data indeed showed a significant delay in the selection of new tip cells in <i>Plxnd1<sup>-/-</sup></i> vascular sprouts compared to wildtype sprouts. The overall appearance of new tip cells, i.e. the tip cell selection frequency, was slowed down by factor 1.5 in the mutants (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,D</a>, <a href=\"#media11\">Video 11,12</a>). When analyzing the different categories separately, the number of events per total imaging time was significantly reduced in the categories 'switch' and 'branch, type II' in the absence of Sema3E-Plexin-D1 signaling (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>)."

Using a computational method (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a> and detailed description in the material and methods section) to analyze the number of branching points in an unbiased way we found a significant reduction in branching points of the network (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F,G</a>).

For example, during somitogenesis, Delta-Notch oscillations determine the frequency of new somite formation ('the somite clock') (<a href=\"#bib3\">Aulehla and Pourqui\u00e9, 2008</a>). In endothelial cells, we propose that modulation of any of the components of the central pattern generator will result in an altered pace of Delta-notch oscillations and an altered vascular patterning. Deceleration of the Delta-notch feedback loop (by a 'slow molecular metronome') will lead to the selection of fewer tip cells within a certain time frame and thus to the formation of a less dense network with bigger pore sizes. Acceleration of the selection process (by a 'fast molecular metronome') would result in an overly dense network (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). However, complex nonlinear feedback dynamics are often hard to intuit, and further careful simulation integrated with experimentation will be required to fully elucidate the temporal modulations and topological outcomes possible."

Our computational modeling predictions, mouse genetics mosaic analysis, and live imaging of individual cell dynamics in actively forming blood vessel networks and computational quantification of branching points show that the lack of Sema3E-Plexin-D1 signaling slows down the rate of tip cell selection and rearrangement, resulting in a less branched vascular network. Therefore, the Sema3E-Plexin-D1 pathway represents a 'faster molecular metronome' that results in a relatively dense network. These data suggest that <i>temporal</i> regulation of this critical, iterative aspect of network formation could be a general mechanism, and additional temporal regulators with varying pace (fast vs. slow) may exist to sculpt vascular topology in different tissues. Furthermore, our findings may provide insights into our understanding of morphogenesis in general, and aid in efforts to develop therapeutic approaches for tissue engineering and control of tumor progression and vascular diseases."

The memAgents have dynamic internal levels of proteins, which enable them to sense protein levels in the local extracellular environment (primarily VEGF ligands). The endothelial cell integrates this local spatial information to determine its behavior (e.g. extension of filopodia) and perform genetic regulatory processes (e.g. Dll4-Notch) after a time delay representing the processes of transcription and translation (parameters D1 and D2 in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). As the time delay for Notch/VEGF gene expression is not currently known in the mouse, the model was calibrated to match the known Notch periodicity (30 min) of the zebrafish somite clock (<a href=\"#bib14\">Guidicelli and Lewis, 2004</a>) so D1=D2=28 time steps (representing 7 min of real time) as it was previously shown that, consistent with period/delay relations in the Notch somite clock models (<a href=\"#bib14\">Guidicelli and Lewis, 2004</a>), the periodicity of Notch/VEGF signaling in the MSM model = 2 x (D1+D2+R1+R2), where R1 and R2 are the recovery delays, representing degradation rates, which were both set to 1 (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bentley et. al., 2008</a>)."

To investigate the effects of varying the temporal regulation of Plexin-D1 on tip cell selection a sensitivity analysis was performed simulating with different delay settings for the new parameters D3 and D4 (a full analysis of varying delays D1 and D2 is given in [<a href=\"#bib6\">Bentley et al., 2008</a>]). It was found that the lateral inhibition mechanism is strictly sensitive to the values of these new delay parameters relative to the existing delays D1 and D1. In the model, only a setting of D3+D4 =D1 would allow for normal tip cell selection in control conditions (<a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). Even a delay with D3 or D4 = \u00b1 1 timestep in the model (representing 15 s) would disrupt the process and tip cells could not be selected and the system falls into unrealistic 'flashing' oscillations as the cells instantly raise and then lower dll4 each time step through the Notch/VEGF negative feedback loop resulting in a counter intuitive hypersprouting rather than inhibited phenotype as no cell is under the inhibition long enough to become a stalk cell (<a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>, <a href=\"#media3\">3</a>). Interestingly if all delay parameters are set to zero, representing the null hypothesis that no time delays are required to explain the phenotype, the same system behavior occurs as in <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a> and <a href=\"#media3\">3</a> illustrating the importance of explicitly representing the amount of time that gene expression takes in computational models."

According to the suggested model, inhibition of Dll4 expression due to Plexin-D1 activation by Sema3E result in reduced lateral inhibition of tip cell phenotype in neighboring stalk cells. This, in turn, results in more tip cell selection and more complex vasculature development. To support the model, the authors use two experimental systems.

Second, they use lung explant to monitor the dynamics of endothelial sprout development in the presence or absence of Plexin-D1 signaling.

If we step through and consider it logically however we arrive at the current depiction of the figure being sufficient, though we agree it worth considering carefully. Firstly, the phenotype of a retina with high VEGF is known and previously published (e.g. by ourselves in Bentley K et al. Nature Cell biology 2014). A key element of the high VEGF retinal phenotype is the switch from branching to drastic expansion and widening of the leading edge, which mimics the expansion of abnormal vessels in pathologies with high VEGF, furthermore large patches of over-activated cells can be observed in certain regions (also made clear in Bentley et al. 2008). Therefore, given the phenotype here exhibits no such expansion, no over activated regions and branching, though reduced, continues as normal when initiated we can consider that even if there is an elevation in VEGF it is not sufficiently high to overcome the reduction in activation triggered by Semaphorin/Plexin-D1 loss and so not useful to include in a parsimonious model of the primary factors affecting this phenotype."

Biol (2009) and in all subsequent papers, there was actually always a time delay component to gene expression, this isn\u2019t a new feature of this study, however re-reading our modeling introduction we understand why it may have come across that it was. Time delays were present in the original model to capture the regulation that VEGF activation has on Dll4 (delay D1 in the original model) and Notch activation has on VEGFR-2 (delay D2) as gene expression takes on the on the order of half an hour to multiple hours and the model time steps represent 15 seconds these need to be included to be true to the biological case. Thus when extending the model here to include Semaphorin-Plexin signaling it was necessary to also include the corresponding time delay parameters (the new ones being D3 and D4) but time delay wasn\u2019t a novel feature of this study per se, rather the inclusion of Semaphorin effects on Dll4 was the novelty.

So, even though it must be stressed such an assumption could never be a realistic alternative to the proposed model as it is not biologically plausible for gene expression to happen in an instant, we re-simulated the model with gene expression changes occurring instantaneously (removing D1-D4). As suggested by the reviewer, S needs to then be increased to compensate for the accumulation of Dll4 effects over time when time delays are present. The result is that the system behavior looks almost exactly like that in <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>, where the time delays were instead mismatched. In a KO simulation without time delays (where \u03b4 is high to account for the high S) the cells flash rapidly between high and then low dll4 levels, as big changes in gene expression occur instantaneously every time step, the cells swing rapidly from strong inhibition to release that inhibition and back (when dll4 is high VEGFR-2 expression drops instantaneously at the next timestep driving an instant drop in Dll4 production at the next timestep which breaks the inhibition and allows the VEGFR-2 receptor levels to rise instantaneously) The negative feedback essentially causes an oscillation with period 1 timestep. The phenotypic result is interesting, as can be seen in <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>, no cell is then continually inhibited so every other timestep extension of filopodia can continue, so the phenotype is counter intuitively one of hypersprouting, rather than inhibition. Therefore, we can reject the null hypothesis that a model without time delays in gene expression could still account for the Plexin KO phenotype, which of course does not hypersprout or hyposprout. To clarify this point the text \u201cCalibrating time delay parameters D3 and D4\u201dhas been added to the Methods section on calibrating the time delays."
