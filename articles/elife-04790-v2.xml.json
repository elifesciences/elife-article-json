Unfavorable TBI outcomes result from primary mechanical injuries to the brain and ensuing secondary non-mechanical injuries that are not limited to the brain. Our genome-wide association study of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> revealed that the probability of death following TBI is associated with single nucleotide polymorphisms in genes involved in tissue barrier function and glucose homeostasis. We found that TBI causes intestinal and blood\u2013brain barrier dysfunction and that intestinal barrier dysfunction is highly correlated with the probability of death. Furthermore, we found that ingestion of glucose after a primary injury increases the probability of death through a secondary injury mechanism that exacerbates intestinal barrier dysfunction. Our results indicate that natural variation in the probability of death following TBI is due in part to genetic differences that affect intestinal barrier dysfunction."

Unfavorable TBI outcomes result from primary mechanical injuries to the brain and ensuing secondary non-mechanical injuries that are not limited to the brain. Our genome-wide association study of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> revealed that the probability of death following TBI is associated with single nucleotide polymorphisms in genes involved in tissue barrier function and glucose homeostasis. We found that TBI causes intestinal and blood\u2013brain barrier dysfunction and that intestinal barrier dysfunction is highly correlated with the probability of death. Furthermore, we found that ingestion of glucose after a primary injury increases the probability of death through a secondary injury mechanism that exacerbates intestinal barrier dysfunction. Our results indicate that natural variation in the probability of death following TBI is due in part to genetic differences that affect intestinal barrier dysfunction."

Katzenberger et al. subsequently found that the breakdown of this barrier after brain injury permits bacteria and glucose to leak out of the intestine. Treating flies with antibiotics did not increase survival, whereas reducing glucose levels in the circulatory system after brain injury did. Thus, Katzenberger et al<i>.</i> conclude that high levels of glucose in the circulatory system, a condition known as hyperglycemia, is a key culprit in death following TBI."

Important challenges remain, including understanding precisely how the brain and intestine communicate, how injury to the brain leads to disruption of the intestinal barrier, and why elevated glucose levels increase mortality after brain injury. Answers to these questions could help pave the way to new therapies for TBI."

Death following TBI is not only due to primary injuries, that is, mechanical injuries that occur at the moment of impact to the brain, but also to secondary injuries, that is, non-mechanical injuries that evolve over time in response to primary injuries (<a href=\"#bib61\">Masel and DeWitt, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Blennow et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Prins et al., 2013</a>). Because secondary injuries are non-mechanical and are delayed relative to primary injuries they may be sensitive to therapeutic interventions. For example, secondary injuries to the intestine can rapidly follow primary injuries to the brain, and interventions that block intestinal injuries may prevent bacterial translocation and subsequent sepsis (<a href=\"#bib44\">Hang et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Feighery et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Jin et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Bansal et al., 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib8\">2010</a>).

Our fly model uses the high-impact trauma (HIT) device, consisting of a metal spring with a stationary end attached to a board and a free end positioned over a polyurethane pad, to inflict traumatic injury (<a href=\"#bib52\">Katzenberger et al., 2013</a>). A plastic vial containing unanesthetized flies is connected to the free end. When the spring is deflected and released, the vial rapidly strikes the pad, and a mechanical force is delivered to the flies as they impact the vial wall. A high-speed movie shows that a strike from the HIT device causes flies to hit the vial wall multiple times with their head and body, probably inflicting traumatic injury to multiple organs, including the brain (<a href=\"#bib5\">Balsiger et al., 2014</a>). Closed-head TBI may result from impacts to the head or body that cause the fly brain to ricochet and deform against the head capsule, similar to what happens to humans in falls and car crashes (<a href=\"#bib23\">Davceva et al., 2012</a>). Accordingly, flies treated with the HIT device display phenotypes consistent with brain injury, including temporary incapacitation followed by ataxia, gradual recovery of mobility, neurodegeneration over time, and death within 24 hr (<a href=\"#bib52\">Katzenberger et al., 2013</a>). However, as in polytraumatic injuries in humans (e.g., blast injuries), damage to organs other than the brain may contribute to morbidity (<a href=\"#bib81\">Scott et al., 2006</a>). Therefore, we provisionally use the term traumatic injury to refer to the primary injury. One goal of this study is to identify the injured body part or parts that cause death within 24 hr."

Previously, we found that genotype and age at the time of traumatic injury affect the MI<sub>24</sub> (<a href=\"#bib52\">Katzenberger et al., 2013</a>). Younger flies have a lower MI<sub>24</sub> than older flies, suggesting that aging-related processes promote death following traumatic injury. In addition, genotype can affect the MI<sub>24</sub> many fold, indicating the existence of genes that suppress or enhance the secondary injury mechanisms that cause death following traumatic injury. We also found that the innate immune response is activated shortly after primary injuries. In flies, the Toll and Immune deficiency (Imd) innate immune response pathways are responsible for defense against pathogens such as bacteria (<a href=\"#bib54\">Lemaitre and Hoffmann, 2007</a>). Both pathways upregulate the transcription of antimicrobial peptide (AMP) genes, which encode small, secreted peptides that contribute to the elimination of pathogens. The innate immune response pathways are also activated in response to various types of stress, including oxidative stress and tissue damage. Here, we further investigate the roles of aging, genotype, and the innate immune response in mortality following traumatic injury."

Several of the genes have functions related to septate junctions, which are similar to tight junctions in vertebrates (<a href=\"#bib36\">Furuse and Tsukita, 2006</a>). Septate junctions and tight junctions serve as barriers in the intestine, brain, and other tissues that prevent pathogen invasion and restrict the paracellular transport of materials. These junctions are constructed of transmembrane proteins such as Claudins, which interact between neighboring cells, and intracellular proteins such as PDZ (<span class=\"underline\">P</span>SD-95, <span class=\"underline\">D</span>iscs-large, <span class=\"underline\">Z</span>O-1) domain proteins, which interact with the cytoplasmic tail of transmembrane proteins. Mutation of the septate junction-associated, PDZ domain-containing protein Big Bang (BBG) permits bacteria from the intestinal lumen to cross the intestinal epithelial barrier and activate the innate immune response (<a href=\"#bib14\">Bonnay et al., 2013</a>). In addition, aging-related death in flies is highly correlated with intestinal barrier dysfunction and activation of the innate immune response (<a href=\"#bib77\">Rera et al., 2012</a>). In light of these links among tissue barrier dysfunction, the innate immune response, and aging-related death, we investigated the role of tissue barrier dysfunction in death following traumatic injury. Our findings indicate that traumatic injury to the brain is a major cause of death in our model and that mortality from brain injury is dependent on genetic and environmental effects on intestinal barrier permeability."

Following a 10 min recovery period after the last strike, flies were transferred to a new vial containing molasses food and were incubated at 25\u00b0C. The number of dead flies was counted after 24 hr. To control for death not due to injuries during this time, a vial of flies not subjected to injury was equivalently processed. Every experiment consisted of at least three independent trials, and the MI<sub>24</sub> represents the average percent death for flies with injuries minus the average percent death for flies without injuries. We found that the MI<sub>24</sub> had a continuous distribution among the RAL lines, over a wide range from 6.7 \u00b1 0.8 to 57.5 \u00b1 1.7 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>).

We found that progeny from crosses between RAL892 and RAL lines with a low MI<sub>24</sub> (RAL352, RAL907, and RAL774) had an intermediate MI<sub>24</sub> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). In contrast, progeny from crosses between RAL892 and RAL lines with a high MI<sub>24</sub> (RAL707, RAL73, RAL799, and RAL161) maintained a high MI<sub>24</sub>. Variation in the MI<sub>24</sub> could be due to many genes or environmental factors. However, the fly lines were cultured under the same conditions (temperature, humidity, diet, light/dark cycle, and density), which limited the contribution of environmental factors. Thus, the continuous distribution over a wide range of the MI<sub>24</sub> among wild-type fly lines and the intermediate MI<sub>24</sub> of progeny from crosses between fly lines with significantly different MI<sub>24</sub>s suggest that the probability of death following traumatic injury is a quantitative trait affected by many genes (<a href=\"#bib31\">Falconer and Mackay, 1996</a>)."

This analysis revealed that 216 unique SNPs located in or near 98 genes were associated with the MI<sub>24</sub> at a discovery significance threshold of p &lt; 10<sup>\u22125</sup> (<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 3</a>). However, despite the small p-values, some of the associations may be false positives because the minor allele frequency cut-off of the DGRP Freeze 1 algorithm was 4 lines, allowing the p-value to be driven by a few extreme lines. Reanalysis using the DGRP Freeze 2 algorithm that has a minor allele frequency cut-off of 10 lines revealed significant associations of SNPs in only 10 of the 98 genes (<a href=\"#bib49\">Huang et al., 2014</a>). The discrepancy between the Freeze 1 and 2 analyses is illustrated by SNPs in <i>grainyhead</i> (<i>grh</i>), which were significantly associated with the MI<sub>24</sub> in the Freeze 1 analysis but were not identified in the Freeze 2 analysis because they occurred in fewer than 10 lines (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). At the time that we obtained the MI<sub>24</sub> data for the RAL lines, the Freeze 2 algorithm had not been developed, so we moved forward based on the Freeze 1 data, initially focusing on <i>grh</i> because it contained the SNP that was most significantly associated with the MI<sub>24</sub> (p = 1.15 \u00d7 10<sup>\u221210</sup>) as well as three other significant SNPs. The four SNPs in <i>grh</i> were located in a 523 bp region of intron 10 suggesting that they have similar effects on the regulation of <i>grh</i> expression (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib86\">St Pierre et al., 2014</a>). Alternatively, since three of the four SNPs (red, blue, and yellow dots in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) are shared by three lines (RAL73, RAL161, and RAL892), linkage disequilibrium may account for their significant association with the MI<sub>24</sub>. These data indicate that flies carrying particular <i>grh</i> alleles are more likely to die within 24 hr of a traumatic injury than flies lacking these alleles."

In humans, one of the three <i>grh</i> orthologs, <i>Grainyhead-like 2</i> (<i>Grhl2</i>) activates the expression of <i>claudin</i> genes, and in mice, <i>Grhl3</i> knockout reduces the expression of <i>claudin</i> genes (<a href=\"#bib103\">Yu et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib98\">Werth et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Senga et al., 2012</a>). In flies, misexpression of <i>grh</i> in a tissue that normally lacks septate junctions is sufficient to induce expression of septate junction proteins (<a href=\"#bib63\">Narasimha et al., 2008</a>). Thus, we hypothesized that the four SNPs in <i>grh</i> affect the function of septate junctions by altering the expression of genes encoding septate junction proteins. In support of this hypothesis, SNPs in <i>bbg</i> and <i>scribbled</i> (<i>scrib</i>), which encode PDZ domain-containing, septate junction-associated proteins, were also associated with the MI<sub>24</sub> (<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary files 3, 4</a>) (<a href=\"#bib11\">Bilder and Perrimon, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Bonnay et al., 2013</a>). <i>bbg</i> remained significantly associated with the probability of death (p = 2.36 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22126</sup>) when the data from <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> were reanalyzed using the DGRP Freeze 2 algorithm (<a href=\"#bib49\">Huang et al., 2014</a>). Additional support for the hypothesis comes from the finding that direct mechanical damage to the brain in rodent TBI models causes disruption of the intestinal barrier and a decrease in expression of tight junction proteins (<a href=\"#bib44\">Hang et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Feighery et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Jin et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Bansal et al., 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib8\">2010</a>).

Thus, we tested this hypothesis by examining the permeability of tissue barriers following traumatic injury."

If the intestinal barrier is functional, the dye remains in the digestive tract (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). In contrast, if the intestinal barrier is disrupted, the dye crosses the barrier into the hemolymph and disperses throughout the body, a process referred to as \u2018Smurfing\u2019.

This phenotype is similar to the symptoms of a concussion in humans (<a href=\"#bib38\">Giacino et al., 2014</a>). It is also similar to temporary paralysis observed in bang-sensitive <i>Drosophila</i> mutants following mild mechanical shock that disrupts normal electrical activity in the brain (<a href=\"#bib35\">Fergestad et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Parker et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Burg and Wu, 2012</a>). These observations are consistent with the idea that at least a fraction of the flies subjected to the HIT device suffer a brain injury that temporarily disturbs normal neuronal function resulting in temporary paralysis. These observations also raise the question of whether this presumptive brain injury contributes to the observed mortality of treated flies. To address this question, we determined the correlation between temporary incapacitation and the MI<sub>24</sub> following traumatic injury. Individual flies were subjected to a single strike from the HIT device and were scored as incapacitated if they were motionless immediately after injury. As previously observed, incapacitated flies did not die immediately (<a href=\"#bib52\">Katzenberger et al., 2013</a>). Of the 600 flies examined, 64 (10.7%) were incapacitated, and all, except one, recovered mobility within 5 min. Nonetheless, incapacitated flies had an \u223cfivefold higher MI<sub>24</sub> than non-incapacitated flies, indicating that injuries that cause incapacitation also contribute significantly to the cause of death within 24 hr (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Although we cannot rule out other possibilities, these data taken together with data in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> are consistent with a model in which death following traumatic injury inflicted by the HIT device is dependent on intestinal barrier dysfunction, which is evoked by damage to the brain via an unknown mechanism."

Using the scale shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>, we qualitatively scored the intensity of fluorescence in various RAL lines before and after subjecting flies to injury. We found that the percent of flies with a leaky BEB following traumatic injury, that is, those scored + to ++++, was comparable among different RAL lines, as was the distribution of flies among the scale categories, irrespective of whether a particular line had a low MI<sub>24</sub> (RAL352 and RAL774) or a high MI<sub>24</sub> (RAL161 and RAL892) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>).

Leakage of bacteria across the intestinal barrier would be one way that traumatic injury could trigger the innate immune response. If so, this response should be dampened in antibiotic-fed flies. We used qRT-PCR to quantify AMP gene expression following traumatic injury in flies treated with antibiotics compared to controls. We found that 2 hr after treatment of 0\u20137 day old <i>w</i><sup><i>1118</i></sup> flies with the standard injury protocol, both antibiotic-fed flies and flies without antibiotics had higher levels of expression of the AMP genes <i>Attacin C</i> (<i>AttC</i>), <i>DiptB</i> (<i>Diptericin B</i>), and <i>Metchnikowin</i> (<i>Mtk</i>) than equivalently treated flies that were not subjected to the standard injury protocol (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplements 1, 3</a>).

Thus, antibiotics reduce the level of activation of the innate immune response but do not affect the MI<sub>24</sub>, indicating that death following traumatic injury is not influenced by activation of the innate immune response. On the other hand, the level of AMP gene expression does correlate with the MI<sub>24</sub>. For example, the correlation coefficient (r) between <i>AttC</i> expression and the MI<sub>24</sub> for the eight RAL lines examined was 0.75 (p = 0.03) for antibiotic-fed flies and 0.74 (p = 0.03) for flies without antibiotics. The respective r-values for <i>DiptB</i> were 0.52 (p = 0.19) and 0.51 (p = 0.20) and for <i>Mtk</i> were 0.81 (p = 0.02) and 0.63 (p = 0.09).

For the \u2018before\u2019 treatment, we cultured 0\u20136 day old <i>w</i><sup><i>1118</i></sup> flies in vials with water-soaked filter paper for 24 hr, subjected flies to the standard injury protocol, transferred them to vials containing molasses food, and determined the MI<sub>24</sub>. We found that the MI<sub>24</sub> of flies fed water before traumatic injury did not differ significantly from that of molasses food-fed flies (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). For the \u2018after\u2019 treatment, flies were cultured on molasses food prior to the standard injury protocol and then transferred to vials containing water-soaked filter paper. We found that feeding the flies water rather than molasses food after traumatic injury significantly reduced the MI<sub>24</sub>. Feeding water rather than molasses food after injury also reduced the MI<sub>24</sub> of RAL lines with a low (RAL774) or high (RAL707) MI<sub>24</sub> (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). These data indicate that death following traumatic injury is dependent on a secondary injury mechanism that involves ingestion of molasses food after the primary injury. However, the present data do not rule out the possibility that water provides protection against death following traumatic injury. In either case, since death following traumatic injury was not completely eliminated by substituting water for molasses food, these data indicate that other independent mechanisms also contribute to mortality after traumatic injury. Consistent with these observations and the correlation between the SI<sub>24</sub> and mortality after injury, we found that flies fed water after traumatic injury had a significantly lower SI<sub>24</sub> than molasses food-fed flies (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). These data indicate that ingestion of molasses food after a primary injury promotes intestinal barrier disruption."

The concentrations of sugars tested were based on molasses food, which is 10% molasses vol/vol (approximately 0.33 M sugar, that is, 0.13 M sucrose, 0.1 M glucose, and 0.1 M fructose) (<a href=\"#bib27\">Dionex, 2003</a>).

In contrast, flies cultured on 0.6 M sucrose, 1.0 M glucose, or 0.8 M fructose had an MI<sub>24</sub> that was significantly higher than the MI<sub>24</sub> of flies cultured on water. The effective concentrations of the individual sugars are higher than they are in molasses suggesting that sugars in combination have a synergistic effect on the MI<sub>24</sub> or that another component of molasses food is important. <a href=\"#fig7\">Figures 7C\u2013E</a> also indicate that the effect of sugars on the MI<sub>24</sub> is saturable. For example, flies cultured on 0.8, 1.0, or 1.2 M sucrose had statistically similar MI<sub>24</sub> values. We also found that flies fed 1.2 M sucrose after a primary injury had a significantly higher SI<sub>24</sub> than flies fed water after a primary injury (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>), indicating that sugar ingested after a traumatic injury promotes intestinal barrier disruption. Together, these data indicate that ingestion of sugar beyond a certain threshold after traumatic injury increases the probability of death by exacerbating intestinal barrier dysfunction and that the secondary injury mechanism by which sugar promotes death is saturable."

Insulin signaling through the insulin receptor (InR) leads to phosphorylation and activation of the Akt kinase and inactivation of the FOXO transcription factor (<a href=\"#bib90\">Teleman, 2009</a>).

Initial or primary damage from impact forces results in brain dysfunction manifested by a variety of symptoms, including loss of consciousness, seizure, and other behavioral and cognitive impairments. Subsequently, additional non-mechanical secondary injuries can arise over time in response to the primary injuries resulting in further pathological consequences, which in the most severe cases includes death. The biological pathways linking primary and secondary injuries and the proximate cause of death following TBI are poorly understood at present. We have recently developed a traumatic injury model in <i>Drosophila</i> that replicates many of the key features of TBI in humans (<a href=\"#bib52\">Katzenberger et al., 2013</a>). Here, we investigate the link between primary and secondary injuries in this model and determine which pathophysiological manifestations correlated with death 24 hr after injury. Our results suggest that subjecting flies to collision impact by the HIT device results in primary TBI that triggers secondary injuries, including damage to the intestinal barrier. The resulting increased intestinal permeability is highly correlated with mortality within 24 hr after injury and is very likely to be one of the main causative factors of death."

Nonetheless, our results are consistent with the supposition that at least some fraction of the flies subjected to the HIT device have suffered an injury analogous with TBI in humans. They exhibit diagnostic features associated with human TBI, notably temporary loss of motor activity with flies lying incapacitated on their back or side, with no evidence of external mechanical damage (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Motor activity recovers gradually over a 5-min period, although ataxia persists for a longer period. In addition to these immediate impairments, over a more extended period, the injured flies also manifest a shortened lifespan, behavioral deficits, and onset of neurodegeneration in the central brain (<a href=\"#bib52\">Katzenberger et al., 2013</a>). These phenotypes are all indicative of brain dysfunction, which is the defining characteristic of TBI. Indeed, screens in <i>Drosophila</i> for reversible, conditional loss of motor activity, resulted in the isolation of mutants with defects in neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission, which were further enriched for neurodegenerative phenotypes (<a href=\"#bib83\">Siddiqi and Benzer, 1976</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Littleton et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Palladino et al., 2002</a>, <a href=\"#bib65\">2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Fergestad et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Gnerer et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Babcock et al., 2015</a>). Activation of the innate immune response in the brain following treatment by the HIT device is a further indication of injury to the brain (<a href=\"#bib52\">Katzenberger et al., 2013</a>). Moreover, because flies become paralyzed immediately after mechanical injury, this must be a primary injury response. The high-speed movie shows that flies subjected to the HIT device could sustain primary injuries to the brain through multiple mechanisms: acceleration-deceleration forces on the brain due to contact of the head with the vial, coup contrecoup forces on the brain due to rebounding of the spring, or sheer forces on the brain due to unrestricted head movements that accompany contact of the body with the vial (<a href=\"#bib5\">Balsiger et al., 2014</a>). Thus, although we cannot rule out other more complicated interpretations, as a working hypothesis, we believe our data indicate that some percentage of flies subjected to mechanical impact by the HIT device suffer a brain injury that shares significant features with TBI in humans."

Since flies that die within this period do not do so immediately after the primary injury, there must be some secondary effect that amplifies the initial injury to cause death. Unexpectedly, our results point to intestinal barrier dysfunction as a physiological consequence following TBI that is a major factor in subsequent mortality. Four lines of evidence support this conclusion. (1) GWA analysis for variation in the MI<sub>24</sub> uncovered genes linked to the function of septate junctions (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>), including <i>grh</i>, which encodes a transcription factor required for epithelial barrier formation, and <i>bbg</i> and <i>scrib</i>, which encode PDZ domain-containing, septate junction-associated proteins (<a href=\"#bib11\">Bilder and Perrimon, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Narasimha et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Bonnay et al., 2013</a>).

Moreover, we found that direct injury to the brain via a crushing injury, is sufficient to trigger intestinal barrier dysfunction (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). This conclusion is supported by the observation that flies immediately incapacitated following injury by the HIT device, which are the ones most likely to have suffered a brain injury, had a significantly higher probability of death, which is associated with intestinal barrier dysfunction, than non-incapacitated flies (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

Moreover, increased intestinal permeability occurs in rodent TBI models in which injury is inflicted exclusively to the brain, demonstrating that increased intestinal permeability can result from direct mechanical injury to the brain (<a href=\"#bib44\">Hang et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Feighery et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Jin et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Bansal et al., 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib8\">2010</a>).

However, thus far, modulating blood glucose levels by intensive insulin treatment in humans has had no effect on the probability of death within 6 months of a primary injury (<a href=\"#bib12\">Bilotta et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib101\">Yang et al., 2009</a>). Thus, additional research is still need to understand the mechanistic relationship between blood glucose levels and the probability of death following TBI.

                                "text": "Physiological phenotypes of flies that die from TBI are shared with those of flies that die from old age. <a href=\"#bib77\">Rera et al. (2012)</a> found that, regardless of chronological age, a few days prior to death, <i>w</i><sup><i>1118</i></sup> flies show increased intestinal permeability and increased activation of the innate immune response. They also found that <i>w</i><sup><i>1118</i></sup> flies had reduced insulin signaling, which we observed with <i>w</i><sup><i>1118</i></sup> flies cultured on molasses food, but, paradoxically, not with other fly lines or under other conditions (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). In addition, we previously found that the probability of death following TBI increases with age in flies, and others have found that the probability of death within one or 6 months of a primary injury increases with age in TBI patients (<a href=\"#bib87\">Susman et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Hukkelhoven et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Dhandapani et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Katzenberger et al., 2013</a>). Taken together, these data suggest that as flies and humans age, events such as breakdown of the intestinal epithelial barrier progressively become more severe until they are sufficient to cause death. Thus, as has been suggested for neuropathologies in human TBI (<a href=\"#bib85\">Smith et al., 2013</a>), TBI may cause death in young flies by triggering secondary injury mechanisms that parallel the defects that otherwise occur as part of the normal aging process. Older flies would then be more susceptible to death following TBI than younger flies because some critical physiological mechanism such as breakdown of the intestinal epithelial barrier would already be compromised to the point where it would require less of a subsequent insult to push the impairment beyond the threshold for lethality."

                                "text": "Our results demonstrate that the probability of death following TBI is a quantitative trait likely to be affected by many genes. This discovery was possible because we were able to examine many genetically diverse wild-type fly lines under conditions where factors known to affect the probability of death following TBI, that is, the force, number, and timing of primary injuries, age at the time of the primary injury, and environmental conditions, were kept constant (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Furthermore, through GWA analysis, we were able to identify 216 SNPs in 98 genes that are significantly associated with the probability of death following TBI (<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 3</a>). Presumably, these SNPs create a physiological state that alters the severity of primary and/or secondary injuries. For example, SNPs in genes that affect the function of septate junctions (<i>grh</i>, <i>bbg</i>, and <i>scrib</i>) or glucose homeostasis (<i>sxc</i>, <i>pgant2</i>, <i>miR-14</i>, and <i>CG7882</i>) may generate intestinal epithelial barriers that are sensitive to disruption by cellular and molecular mechanisms triggered by TBI. Genotype is likely to play an equally important role in humans since variation in several genes has already been shown to be associated with the probability of death of severe TBI patients (<a href=\"#bib22\">Dardiotis et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Garringer et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Failla et al., 2015</a>). These data suggest that SNPs in orthologs of genes such as <i>grh</i> will correlate with the probability of death of TBI patients and could be used for genetic susceptibility testing to identify individuals at high risk of death following TBI."

We attempted to determine this for <i>grh</i> by examining the MI<sub>24</sub> of existing <i>grh</i> mutant fly lines. We found that the MI<sub>24</sub> ranged from 18.9 \u00b1 2.8 to 31.6 \u00b1 0.9 for 0\u20137 day old flies that were heterozygous for different <i>grh</i> mutant alleles, two lethal P-element alleles and three lethal EMS alleles. However, determining whether and how these <i>grh</i> mutations affect the MI<sub>24</sub> requires comparison with isogenic flies that are wild-type for <i>grh</i>, which unfortunately do not exist. Moreover, we do not yet know how the identified SNPs affect <i>grh</i> expression or function. For example, if the SNPs increase <i>grh</i> expression or alter only a subset of <i>grh</i> functions then <i>grh</i> loss-of-function mutations would not be expected to have the same effect on the MI<sub>24</sub>. Use of the CRISPR technology in future experiments will help resolve these issues (<a href=\"#bib41\">Gratz et al., 2013</a>)."

Although occurrence of these events is not correlated with the probability of death following TBI, we hypothesize that they are not benign. One likely possibility is that they are associated with unfavorable long-term TBI outcomes in flies and humans that survive for an extended period after injury. For example, since activation of the innate immune response in the brain causes neurodegeneration in flies and is a common feature of human neurodegenerative diseases, it may be an important factor for neurodegeneration in the fly TBI model and for chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a form of neurodegeneration, in TBI patients (<a href=\"#bib89\">Tan et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Arroyo et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Chinchore et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Petersen et al., 2012</a>, <a href=\"#bib69\">2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Cao et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Baugh et al., 2014</a>). In support of this idea, the \u03b2-lactam antibiotic ceftriaxone has neuroprotective effects in a rat TBI model (<a href=\"#bib96\">Wei et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Goodrich et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Cui et al., 2014</a>).

There is considerable evidence that diet after a primary injury influences the outcomes of TBI patients (<a href=\"#bib42\">Greco and Prins, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Scrimgeour and Condlin, 2014</a>). For example, zinc supplementation reduces the probability of death of severe TBI patients, and the amount of nutrition in the first 5 days after a primary injury affects the probability of death of severe TBI patients (<a href=\"#bib102\">Young et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">H\u00e4rtl et al., 2008</a>). Our results in <i>Drosophila</i>, suggest that limiting sugar intake immediately after TBI in humans may be worth investigating as a therapeutic option to reduce the probability of death. Moreover, evolutionary conservation of the intestinal response to TBI between flies and humans suggests that elucidation of the underlying genotype- and age-dependent mechanisms in flies will have clinical relevance."

The authors previously used the DGRP1 analysis pipeline from the Mackay lab, finding 98 genes with associations, including SNPs at <i>grh</i>: one of the candidate genes that led them down the path of considering intestinal barrier problems as a cause of death in their TBI model, and a gene discussed at length in the manuscript. In the response, but critically not in the manuscript, they acknowledge that a re-analysis of the GWAS with the DGRP2 analysis pipeline (which accounts for relatedness, along with a couple of other changes that should make associations more robust) finds only 10 of the previous 98 genes with associations. The set of 10 does not include <i>grh</i>. There simply must be a detailed discussion in the paper of the differences between the results with the two pipelines. Since the previous list of 98 genes included several (<i>grh</i>, <i>bbg</i>, and <i>scrib, and sxc</i>, <i>pgant2</i>, <i>miR-14</i>, and <i>CG7882</i>) with a priori interesting functional roles, it is also critical to specifically state whether these genes were replicated in the new pipeline. I appreciate that the GWAS was basically used as a guide to the kinds of pathways that are involved in the trait, but if few of the genes are replicated between pipelines that is a problem for the paper and for the argument."

We believe that our new data support the conclusion that flies subjected to mechanical impact by the HIT device suffer a primary brain injury that triggers secondary intestinal barrier dysfunction, which is major factor in subsequent mortality. In addition, our new data provide additional evidence that the physiological consequences of HIT device treatment of flies are similar to those of TBI in humans. First, we have included new data indicating that injury exclusively to the fly brain is sufficient to increase intestinal permeability (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Specifically, we found that compression of the head using forceps causes Smurfing (a reporter of intestinal permeability) within 24 hours. Communication between the injured brain and the intestine is conserved in mammals. Several groups have shown using rodent TBI models that direct injury to the brain causes increased intestinal permeability. Thus, these data indicate that TBI induced by the HIT device could cause secondary injures to the intestine that increase barrier permeability and that this finding is relevant to mammals. Second, our new data on incapacitated flies (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2013figure supplement 1</a>) indicate that flies subjected to the HIT device receive TBI and die from these injuries. Incapacitation in flies is similar to the symptoms of a concussion in humans. It is also similar to temporary paralysis observed in bang-sensitive <i>Drosophila</i> mutants following mild mechanical shock that disrupts normal electrical activity in the brain. These observations are consistent with the idea that at least a fraction of the flies subjected to the HIT device suffer a brain injury that temporarily disturbs normal neuronal function resulting in temporary paralysis. Furthermore, we found that incapacitated flies had a significantly higher probability of death following the primary injury than non-incapacitated flies, indicating that the injuries to the brain that cause incapacitation also contribute significantly to mortality within 24 hours. Third, we have included new data that indicate that intestinal dysfunction is a secondary injury (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4B and C</a>). <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a> shows that the HIT device-induced increase in glucose level in the hemolymph does not occur until 1-2 hours after the primary injury from the HIT device, suggesting that increased intestinal permeability is not a direct consequence of mechanical damage from the HIT device but rather a secondary consequence of molecular and cellular events evoked by the mechanical damage. In addition, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, which analyzes hemolymph glucose levels in flies fed water rather than molasses food after the primary injury, shows that the increase in glucose levels is due to food ingested <i>after</i> the primary injury, further supporting the conclusion that intestinal dysfunction is a secondary injury. These data, taken together with data in the original manuscript, support the conclusion that primary TBI triggers secondary intestinal barrier dysfunction. Consequent leakage of sugars across the impaired intestinal barrier causes further impairment of this barrier and ultimately death through an unknown proximal event."

Nonetheless, our results are consistent with the supposition that at least some fraction of the flies subjected to the HIT device have suffered an injury analogous with TBI in humans. In addition, the fact that primary injuries inflicted by the HIT device are not limited to the brain can be viewed as an advantage of the system because polytrauma (traumatic injury to multiple body parts) often accompanies TBI and is thought to modulate TBI phenotypes. In the revised Discussion section, we have added two sections at the beginning that lay out all of the evidence that brain injury is causal for mortality following treatment with the HIT device. We have also made revisions to the Results section that address how individual pieces of data impact the claim that the primary injuries to the brain cause death in the fly model."

Two suggestions: the authors could use the protocol detailed here,</i> <a href=\"http://www.jove.com/video/2722/insulin-injection-hemolymph-extraction-to-measure-insulin-sensitivity\">http://www.jove.com/video/2722/insulin-injection-hemolymph-extraction-to-measure-insulin-sensitivity</a><i>, or make careful use of a capillary needle, to extract hemolymph without disrupting the gut. Glucose homeostasis can change very rapidly, and glucose release from other damaged tissues, or a reduction in glucose uptake as a result of whole-fly trauma, cannot be ruled out. This latter part can be addressed by careful rewriting, but an alternative to the centrifugation method is essential at least as a control</i>."
