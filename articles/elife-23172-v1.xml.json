Ambra1 regulates the targeting of active phospho-Src away from focal adhesions into autophagic structures that cancer cells use to survive adhesion stress. Ambra1 binds to both FAK and Src in cancer cells. When FAK is present, Ambra1 is recruited to focal adhesions, promoting FAK-regulated cancer cell direction-sensing and invasion. However, when Ambra1 cannot bind to FAK, abnormally high levels of phospho-Src and phospho-FAK accumulate at focal adhesions, positively regulating adhesion and invasive migration. Spatial control of active Src requires the trafficking proteins Dynactin one and IFITM3, which we identified as Ambra1 binding partners by interaction proteomics. We conclude that Ambra1 is a core component of an intracellular trafficking network linked to tight spatial control of active Src and FAK levels, and so crucially regulates their cancer-associated biological outputs."

Ambra1 regulates the targeting of active phospho-Src away from focal adhesions into autophagic structures that cancer cells use to survive adhesion stress. Ambra1 binds to both FAK and Src in cancer cells. When FAK is present, Ambra1 is recruited to focal adhesions, promoting FAK-regulated cancer cell direction-sensing and invasion. However, when Ambra1 cannot bind to FAK, abnormally high levels of phospho-Src and phospho-FAK accumulate at focal adhesions, positively regulating adhesion and invasive migration. Spatial control of active Src requires the trafficking proteins Dynactin one and IFITM3, which we identified as Ambra1 binding partners by interaction proteomics. We conclude that Ambra1 is a core component of an intracellular trafficking network linked to tight spatial control of active Src and FAK levels, and so crucially regulates their cancer-associated biological outputs."

Cells bind to the matrix using structures called focal adhesions. However, cells do not always stay in one place: in young animals, certain cells need to move around the body to reach their final destination. Adult animals also have some cells that are able to move, for example, to close wounds. The cells move when the focal adhesions that hold these cells in place are taken apart and then rebuilt. These processes are very dynamic and happen all the time when cells move. They are normally tightly controlled to ensure that cells only migrate under appropriate conditions. However, focal adhesions are less well regulated in cancer cells, allowing the cells to migrate away from a tumour to form new tumours elsewhere in the body."

In order to better understand how focal adhesions are taken apart, Schoenherr et al. wanted to discover new proteins that interact with FAK in skin cancer cells from mice. The experiments show that FAK binds to a protein called Ambra1, which is known to control how other proteins move around inside cells. Ambra1 and FAK work together to regulate the movement of Src away from focal adhesions and into the cell. Furthermore, Ambra1 belongs to a larger network of proteins within the cancer cells that regulates the location of Src. By changing the levels of Src and FAK at focal adhesions, Ambra1 and its other binding partners can control whether the cancer cells are attached to the extracellular matrix or are free to migrate."

It is an autophagy regulator, binding to Beclin1 and playing a role in the initiation of autophagy, which is required for neurogenesis (<a href=\"#bib11\">Fimia et al., 2007</a>). When autophagy is not initiated, the Ambra1-Beclin1-Vps34 complex is bound to the dynein motor complex. Upon induction of autophagy, Ambra1 gets phosphorylated by the kinase ULK1, resulting in its release from the dynein complex (<a href=\"#bib9\">Di Bartolomeo et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Strappazzon et al., 2011</a>). Ambra1 function is negatively regulated by mTOR phosphorylation, which suppresses its binding to the E3-ligase TRAF6 and ULK1 ubiquitylation, thus controlling ULK1 stability and function (<a href=\"#bib23\">Nazio et al., 2013</a>). During apoptosis, Ambra1 expression is regulated by caspase-mediated cleavage as well as degradation by calpains (<a href=\"#bib26\">Pagliarini et al., 2012</a>), and a recent study reported the ubiquitylation and subsequent degradation of Ambra1 by RNF2 (<a href=\"#bib41\">Xia et al., 2014</a>). Further, Ambra1 has been reported to support the binding of c-Myc to the phosphatase PP2A, leading ultimately to c-Myc degradation and reduced cell proliferation and tumourigenesis (<a href=\"#bib6\">Cianfanelli et al., 2015</a>), whilst a different study implied that Ambra1 overexpression in cholangiocarcinoma has been correlated with invasion and poor survival (<a href=\"#bib24\">Nitta et al., 2014</a>)."

We therefore investigated the role of Ambra1 in tumour-associated phenotypes regulated by the Src/FAK pathway in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cells derived from the DMBA/TPA model of carcinogenesis (driven by mutated oncogenic H-Ras) (<a href=\"#bib27\">Quintanilla et al., 1986</a>). We have previously shown that FAK-dependent phenotypes include cancer cell polarisation and directional migration, depending primarily on FAK\u2019s protein scaffolding activities, including binding to actin regulators like Eps8, Arp3 and RACK1 (<a href=\"#bib30\">Schoenherr et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Serrels et al., 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib33\">2007</a>). In particular, genetic depletion of FAK, or detachment of FAK-expressing cells, cause active Src to be trafficked from focal adhesions at the cell periphery to intracellular puncta containing autophagy proteins. We termed this \u2018adhesion-stress-induced autophagy\u2019, and it is FAK and adhesion dependent rather than nutrient dependent, in contrast to the classical, starvation-induced autophagy. It provides a novel mechanism for coping with high levels of active Src, and other oncogenic kinases like Ret, which are not spatially controlled in the usual way by their binding to FAK (<a href=\"#bib28\">Sandilands et al., 2012a</a>, <a href=\"#bib29\">2012b</a>)."

In FAK-depleted SCC cells, Ambra1 controls the targeting of active Src to intracellular autophagic puncta. This is mediated by the novel Ambra1-binding proteins Dynactin 1 (Dctn1; also known as p150Glued) and interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3), which together with Ambra1, are critical to trafficking processes that control spatial Src activity and Src-dependent phenotypes. A FAK mutant that is not able to bind Ambra1 promotes increased cell adhesion and invasion by retaining more phospho-FAK (pFAK) and phospho-Src (pSrc) at focal adhesions \u2013 showing that Ambra1 can both positively and negatively regulate the amount of active Src at cellular adhesion sites. Overall, these data imply a novel role for the autophagic protein Ambra1, and its key interacting partners Dynactin 1 and IFITM3, at the heart of an intracellular trafficking network that, in turn, acts as a \u2018spatial rheostat\u2019 for phospho-Src and Src/FAK-mediated cancer processes."

In both SCC FAK-WT and FAK -/- cells, Ambra1 displayed diffuse cytoplasmic localisation with some at focal adhesions (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>).

                                "text": "We previously showed that active Src is localised to intracellular puncta containing autophagy proteins in FAK -/- SCC cells, allowing FAK-deficient cancer cells to cope with high levels of \u2018untethered\u2019 active Src (and other FAK-interacting tyrosine kinases, e.g. Ret) (<a href=\"#bib28\">Sandilands et al., 2012a</a>, <a href=\"#bib29\">2012b</a>). Other FAK- and Src-interacting proteins, like the actin regulator Eps8, are also involved in this spatial localisation of active Src (<a href=\"#bib30\">Schoenherr et al., 2014</a>). Since Ambra1 is a recognised autophagy regulator, we addressed whether it was required for the trafficking of Src to autophagosomes in FAK-deficient cells. Ambra1 and Src, including active phospho-Src (pSrc; pY416), formed a biochemical complex both in FAK-expressing and -deficient SCC cells as shown by co-immunoprecipitation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>). Using immunofluorescence, we found that Ambra1 localised to intracellular puncta that contain autophagy-regulating proteins like LC3B (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,D</a>). We noted that Ambra1 also appeared to localise to nuclei, and although we confirmed this by probing nuclear proteins isolated after cell fractionation and sucrose gradient purification of nuclei, we do not know its significance (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). In FAK-deficient SCC cells, Ambra1 co-localised with pSrc, indicating that active Src and Ambra1 localised to the same intracellular puncta, described previously to contain autophagy proteins (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). The localisation of Ambra1 in these autophagosomes was consistent with co-immunoprecipitation with LC3B, providing evidence that they were present in the same biochemical complex (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). We note that there was a reduced steady state level of the lipidated form of LC3B (LC3B II) in the SCC FAK -/- cells (the significance of this is unknown; [<a href=\"#bib28\">Sandilands et al., 2012a</a>]). We are not able to discern which isoform of LC3B is binding to Ambra1 or whether there is any difference between them."

Dctn1 (Dynactin 1) is a component of the dynactin complex and is involved in dynein-mediated transport along microtubules, enhancing motor processivity (<a href=\"#bib7\">Culver-Hanlon et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">King and Schroer, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Waterman-Storer et al., 1995</a>), and mediating trafficking and maturation of EGFR and lysosomes (<a href=\"#bib17\">Kedashiro et al., 2015b</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Li et al., 2014</a>).

IFITM3, which forms a central node linking the Ambra1, pSrc and FAK trafficking networks (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>), is known to block cellular entry of viruses (<a href=\"#bib1\">Amini-Bavil-Olyaee et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Brass et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Feeley et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Huang et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Lu et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Weidner et al., 2010</a>), to traffic with Rab7 and LAMP1, and to interact with v-ATPase on endosomes to enable clathrin localisation (<a href=\"#bib10\">Feeley et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Wee et al., 2012</a>). IFITM3 is highly expressed in many cancers (<a href=\"#bib2\">Andreu et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Hu et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Li et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Yang et al., 2013</a>) and has been variously implicated in tumour cell proliferation, migration and invasion (<a href=\"#bib13\">Hu et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Li et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Yang et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Zhao et al., 2013</a>). We confirmed the interaction between Ambra1 and IFITM3 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>), FAK and IFITM3 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>), and pSrc and IFITM3 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>) by co-IPs. The interactions between IFITM3 and both Ambra1 and pSrc appeared to be enriched in FAK-expressing cells due to increased IFITM3 expression levels, caused by FAK-dependent IFITM3 transcription (not shown; (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>), and we believe that IFITM3 is present at focal adhesions, shown by immunoblotting of isolated focal adhesion preparations (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>)."

While knockdown of IFITM3 did not affect the Ambra1-pSrc interaction (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B,C</a>), IFITM3 depletion reduced the interaction between FAK and active pSrc, indicating that IFITM3 is involved in the optimal association of Src to FAK (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1D,E</a>), likely through regulating their precise localisation.

We therefore knocked down Ambra1, and found that there was significant loss of polarisation towards a monolayer wound in FAK-expressing SCC cells, as judged by the direction of the Golgi apparatus (stained with GM130). This was in contrast to FAK-deficient cells, in which knockdown of Ambra1 had no further effect on the already suppressed polarisation of cells towards a wound (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A,B</a>). The role of Ambra1 in polarisation was confirmed using Ambra1 +/+ and -/- MEFs (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>). In addition, we found that Ambra1 was required for chemotactic invasion into growth factor-reduced Matrigel in FAK-expressing cells (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2D,E</a>), whilst there was no effect in FAK-deficient cells, which, as we described previously, do not invade into Matrigel (<a href=\"#bib31\">Serrels et al., 2012</a>).

Therefore, we performed adhesion assays on fibronectin-coated dishes (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>) or on plastic (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). We found that after 20 and 60 min, FAK P875A/P881A and FAK -/- cells attached to a higher degree than FAK-WT cells. Furthermore, in already adhered FAK P875A/P881A cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>, middle panels), we found that there was more intense pSrc staining at focal adhesions when compared to FAK-WT cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>, top panels) or FAK -/- cells, in which pSrc was present at intracellular autophagic puncta (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>, lower panels). Quantification of the relative intensity of pSrc at focal adhesions (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>) and of pSrc in intracellular puncta (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>) is shown. While there was more intense staining of active pSrc at focal adhesions in FAK P857A/P881A cells, there were no significant changes in the number or size of focal adhesions (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1C,D</a>). The increased staining of pSrc (and pFAK Y397; <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>) in FAK P875A/P881A cells was confirmed by immunoblotting isolated focal adhesion preparations (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>, right panels, red dots; quantified as phospho/total Src (and phospho/total FAK) in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5H</a>), demonstrating that both active pSrc and pFAK were elevated relative to total Src and FAK, respectively. This was true also of pPaxillin Y118 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>, right panels), reflecting specific retention of phospho- and activated- focal adhesion components at focal adhesions when FAK cannot bind to Ambra1. This implies that the FAK\u2013Ambra1 complex is crucial to orchestrate the\u00a0selective removal of active focal adhesion components from focal adhesions or to promote their turnover at these adhesion sites. The elevated levels of active components retained at focal adhesions when the binding of FAK to Ambra1 is impaired may contribute to the enhanced adhesion at early times after plating on extracellular matrix (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>)."

                                "text": "To determine whether there were other biological consequences of the aberrant accumulation, or retention, of active pSrc and pFAK at focal adhesions when FAK binding to Ambra1 was impaired, we examined chemotactic invasion into growth factor-reduced Matrigel and proliferation in three-dimensional (3D) culture. We found that elevated active pSrc and pFAK at focal adhesions in FAK P875A/P881A cells was associated with enhanced invasive migration (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>) and increased proliferation in 3D compared to FAK-WT cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C,D</a>), without affecting the Src-FAK interaction (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2E</a>). As we found the Ambra1 binding partners Dynactin 1 and IFITM3 to regulate the trafficking of active Src in FAK-deficient SCC cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>), we asked whether they also influenced mis-regulation of active pSrc and pFAK levels at focal adhesions when FAK can no longer bind to Ambra1. We therefore transiently knocked down endogenous Dynactin 1 or IFITM3 expression using siRNA, and we found that the \u2018over-invasion\u2019 of FAK P875A/P881A-expressing cells was restored to similar, or lower, invasion levels than FAK-WT-expressing cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E\u2013G</a>). Additionally, elevated active pSrc levels in the FAK P875A/P881A SCC cells were restored to normal (wildtype) levels by knocking down Dynactin 1 (not shown). These results demonstrate that Ambra1 binding to FAK is required for the maintenance of normal steady-state levels of active pSrc and pFAK at focal adhesions. When this binding is perturbed so that pSrc and pFAK are elevated, the resultant enhanced invasion requires the Ambra1-interacting trafficking proteins Dynactin 1 and IFITM3, which are therefore crucial mediators of active Src trafficking."

In FAK-deficient cells, Ambra1 controls the targeting of active Src away from focal adhesions into autophagic structures that the cells use to cope with toxic levels of active Src when it is not \u2018tethered\u2019 at adhesion sites by FAK (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Sandilands et al., 2012a</a>). When Ambra1 is unable to bind to FAK (as is the case in FAK P875A/P881A-expressing cells), this causes over-retention (lack of removal or turnover) of active Src (and FAK) from focal adhesions, promoting cell adhesion and enhanced invasive migration (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). Ambra1 is therefore a novel spatial regulator of the active Src/FAK complex at sites of cell-matrix adhesion, controlling downstream biological effects in cancer cells. It does this by scaffolding trafficking proteins, for example, Dynactin 1 and IFITM3, which themselves lie at the heart of a network of scaffolding proteins that are needed for optimal trafficking of active Src (and FAK), maintaining appropriate and tolerated levels."

The role of Ambra1 in cancer is less clear. One study suggested that Ambra1 may have a tumour suppressor role, as it is involved in the degradation of c-Myc induced by dephosphorylation by PP2A, resulting in reduced proliferation and tumourigenesis (<a href=\"#bib6\">Cianfanelli et al., 2015</a>). However, another study implied that Ambra1 may have tumour-promoting functions, since Ambra1 overexpression correlated with invasion and poor survival in cholangiocarcinoma (<a href=\"#bib24\">Nitta et al., 2014</a>). The new findings we present here show that Ambra1 contributes to SCC cell behaviour by scaffolding both Src and FAK, and intracellular trafficking proteins, controlling steady-state levels and spatial distribution of the activated forms of Src and FAK at focal adhesions. In this context, therefore, Ambra1 is a scaffold protein that promotes cancer cell phenotypes driven by the Src/FAK pathway, including cancer cell polarisation and chemotactic invasion. This central trafficking scaffold function of Ambra1, and the discovery that it is a crucial \u2018spatial rheostat\u2019 for Src/FAK signalling, adds to the number of important physiological functions for Ambra1, and defines a new level of regulation of the Src/FAK signalling axis. It is interesting to note that while knockdown of Ambra1 caused reduced cancer cell polarisation towards the denuded area of a wounded monolayer, and suppressed chemotactic invasive migration in FAK-expressing cancer cells, there was no effect in FAK-deficient cells, which display intrinsically low polarisation and invasion capacity. We conclude that Ambra1 is a FAK scaffold required for FAK-dependent cancer cell phenotypes, most likely by controlling the localisation of active FAK, and its upstream regulator Src, at focal adhesions."

Dynactin 1 is thought to be involved in retrograde trafficking and maturation of trafficking vesicles (<a href=\"#bib15\">Jovasevic et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Kedashiro et al., 2015a</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Li et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Ohbayashi et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Verissimo et al., 2015</a>), implying that these may be involved in the redistribution of active Src from focal adhesions to autophagosomal puncta in FAK-deficient cells. We noted that Dynactin 1 knockdown resulted in enlarged late endosomes (not shown), while the number of late endosomes was not altered (not shown), implying that impaired trafficking/maturation of vesicles may be responsible for the block to autophagic targeting of active Src upon Ambra1 and Dynactin 1 knockdown. Further, IFITM3 has been reported to localise to late endosomes/lysosomes and overexpression expands Rab7- and LAMP1-positive structures (<a href=\"#bib10\">Feeley et al., 2011</a>), and loss of IFITM3 blocks clathrin-mediated phagocytosis by removing clathrin from membranes (<a href=\"#bib39\">Wee et al., 2012</a>). Knockdown of IFITM3 also significantly impaired the trafficking of active Src to autophagic puncta. In proteomic network analyses, we found that IFITM3 interacts both with FAK and active Src, as well as Ambra1, thereby linking the Ambra1-, FAK- and pSrc-interacting trafficking protein networks together. Furthermore, IFITM3 appears to be important for the interaction of active pSrc with FAK as well as to a lesser extent of Ambra1 with FAK (not shown), but not Ambra1 with pSrc. These findings suggest that IFITM3 is involved in regulating FAK\u2019s interaction with Ambra1 and pSrc. Overall, these data place IFITM3 at the centre of a larger trafficking protein network linking Ambra1, FAK and active Src sub-networks. The full range of the Src/FAK/Ambra1-interacting trafficking proteins from the interactome network (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>) that play a role in pSrc trafficking are unknown at present."

This Ambra1 binding-impaired mutant FAK protein caused increased steady-state levels of active pSrc and pFAK at focal adhesions, and enhanced adhesion, proliferation in 3D and chemotactic invasive migration, without affecting Src/FAK binding. Enhanced invasion was reversed by knockdown of the Ambra1-binding trafficking proteins Dynactin 1 and IFITM3, demonstrating that these Ambra1-scaffolded proteins are involved in the dynamic regulation of active pSrc and pFAK, presumably by trafficking them to and from focal adhesions. Indeed, we found that FAK-driven invasion in the SCC cells was hugely dependent on IFITM3, implying that its crucial role at the heart of trafficking protein networks linking Ambra1, FAK and active Src is vital to Src/FAK-mediated invasion. One caveat of interpreting the data with the FAK P875A/P881A mutant protein is that this mutant is also impaired in binding p130Cas, although to a much lesser extent than Ambra1; importantly though, and in contrast to knockdown of Ambra1, knockdown of p130Cas did not significantly affect invasion (not shown)."

As a result, Ambra1 and its interacting partners control cancer cell adhesion, polarisation, proliferation in 3D and chemotactic invasion. Deregulation of these trafficking components of focal adhesion complexes inhibits Src/FAK-dependent biological processes in cancer cells. Our work demonstrates the importance of tight dynamic control of trafficking of active Src, in particular, to and from focal adhesions."

Quantification is shown (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). As always, a significant reduction in the steady\u2010state level of cellular active pSrc correlates with autophagic removal from focal adhesions when FAK is absent. This is restored to equivalent FAK\u2010WT cell levels when Ambra1 is knocked down. Total Src levels are elevated in FAK \u2010/\u2010 cells, and we have found this to be a transcriptional response to the loss of pSrc in FAK null cells via autophagy (not shown)."

We initially also selected Dynactin 1 as an example of an Ambra1\u2010interacting protein involved in trafficking, which, appeared to be enriched in FAK\u2010deficient cells in which pSrc was being trafficked via autophagy. In support of the hypothesis, knock down of both of these interacting partners of Ambra1 influenced the spatial localization of pSrc, allowing us to conclude that Ambra1\u2019s role in pSrc cellular localisation is likely via trafficking complexes. We have now explained this more clearly in the text of the manuscript (subsection \u201cAmbra1 is part of a network of trafficking proteins linked to active Src and FAK\u201d)."

It is, however, linked to restoration of normal pSrc levels in FAK\u2010deficient cells, which are not invasive in any case. In the situation of the mutant FAK protein that cannot bind Ambra1 \u2013 the only case in which there is excessive active pSrc at focal adhesions \u2013 there is enhancedinvasion.
