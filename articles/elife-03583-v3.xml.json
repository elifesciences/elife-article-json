We determined the structures of the archaeal sodium/proton antiporter MjNhaP1 in two complementary states. The inward-open state was obtained by x-ray crystallography in the presence of sodium at pH 8, where the transporter is highly active. The outward-open state was obtained by electron crystallography without sodium at pH 4, where MjNhaP1 is inactive. Comparison of both structures reveals a 7\u00b0 tilt of the 6 helix bundle. <sup>22</sup>Na<sup>+</sup> uptake measurements indicate non-cooperative transport with an activity maximum at pH 7.5. We conclude that binding of a Na<sup>+</sup> ion from the outside induces helix movements that close the extracellular cavity, open the cytoplasmic funnel, and result in a \u223c5 \u00c5 vertical relocation of the ion binding site to release the substrate ion into the cytoplasm."

We determined the structures of the archaeal sodium/proton antiporter MjNhaP1 in two complementary states. The inward-open state was obtained by x-ray crystallography in the presence of sodium at pH 8, where the transporter is highly active. The outward-open state was obtained by electron crystallography without sodium at pH 4, where MjNhaP1 is inactive. Comparison of both structures reveals a 7\u00b0 tilt of the 6 helix bundle. <sup>22</sup>Na<sup>+</sup> uptake measurements indicate non-cooperative transport with an activity maximum at pH 7.5. We conclude that binding of a Na<sup>+</sup> ion from the outside induces helix movements that close the extracellular cavity, open the cytoplasmic funnel, and result in a \u223c5 \u00c5 vertical relocation of the ion binding site to release the substrate ion into the cytoplasm."

Using X-ray crystallography, Paulino, W\u00f6hlert et al. uncovered the structure of the antiporter in the presence of sodium ions and in alkaline conditions. Under these conditions the sodium/proton antiporter adopts an \u2018inward-open\u2019 state, where the substrate-binding site\u2014the region where the ions bind to be transported\u2014of the transporter is open towards the cell interior. Paulino, W\u00f6hlert et al. also used electron cryo-microscopy to investigate the antiporter's structure under acidic conditions in the absence of salt. This revealed an \u2018outward-open\u2019 state, where the substrate-binding site of the transporter is open towards the space outside of the cell. The main difference between this and the inward-open state is the movement of a bundle of six helices within the antiporter. This activating structural change occurs when a sodium ion binds to the antiporter rather than by a change in acidity."

CPA antiporters are conserved across all biological kingdoms and play crucial roles in pH, ion and volume homeostasis (<a href=\"#bib35\">Padan, 2013</a>). The CPA1 branch of the family includes the archaeal NhaP antiporters from <i>Methanocaldococcus jannaschii</i> (MjNhaP1) and <i>Pyrococcus abyssii</i> (PaNhaP) and the medically important human NHE sodium proton exchangers (<a href=\"#bib13\">Donowitz et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Fuster and Alexander, 2014</a>). CPA1 antiporters are electroneutral and exchange one Na<sup>+</sup> against one H<sup>+</sup> (<a href=\"#bib6\">Calinescu et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">W\u00f6hlert et al., 2014</a>).

MjNhaP1 shares significant sequence homology of functionally important regions with the mammalian NHEs (<a href=\"#bib19\">Goswami et al., 2011</a>). MjNhaP1 and NHE1 are both thought to use a sodium gradient to maintain the intracellular pH by expelling protons from the cell (<a href=\"#bib31\">Lee et al., 2013b</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Paulino and K\u00fchlbrandt, 2014</a>), but the mechanism by which this happens has remained unknown."

H10 of MjNhaP1 is much shorter and does not protrude into the cytoplasm. MjNhaP1 has no equivalent for His292 in H10, a key residue for transport in PaNhaP (<a href=\"#bib48\">W\u00f6hlert et al., 2014</a>). On the cytoplasmic side of the MjNhaP1 dimer interface, a line of ionic and polar residues parallel to the membrane surface maintains tight interactions between protomers. On the extracellular side, dimer interactions are mediated largely by the hydrophobic H1, although deletion of this helix, which is necessary for function, did not abrogate dimer formation (<a href=\"#bib19\">Goswami et al., 2011</a>). Mutational analysis indicates that the first 15 N-terminal residues of H1 are dispensable for activity (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). On the dimer interface of MjNhaP1 there is a deep, hydrophobic cavity, which, unlike that in PaNhaP, spans nearly the entire thickness of the membrane and is covered on the extracellular side (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). As in PaNhaP, this cavity contains density indicative of co-purified, flexible lipids, which was however not sufficiently well-defined for building an atomic model."

Other key residues in the ion-binding site are Ser157 and Asp161 in H6 (Ser155 and Asp159 in PaNhaP; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). MjNhaP1 lacks an equivalent of the ion-coordinating Glu73 in H3 of PaNhaP, which is however not essential for transport (<a href=\"#bib48\">W\u00f6hlert et al., 2014</a>). Instead, Thr76 in H3 of MjNhaP1 interacts with Glu154 in H6, which may guide the substrate ion from the binding site to the cytoplasm. Asn160 in H6 is part of the characteristic ND motif in the CPA1 antiporters (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Comparison with PaNhaP suggests that Asn160 is unlikely to coordinate the substrate ion directly. Rather, it forms a hydrogen bond to the hydroxyl group of Thr131, which in PaNhaP does participate in substrate-ion coordination via its main-chain carbonyl. Nevertheless, changing N160 to alanine renders MjNhaP1 inactive (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). A mutant in which N160 is exchanged against aspartate has reduced activity but is not electrogenic (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,C</a>)."

We therefore determined the structure of the sodium-free state at low pH by electron cryo-crystallography of 2D crystals grown at pH 4 without NaCl (<a href=\"#bib36\">Paulino and K\u00fchlbrandt, 2014</a>). Amplitudes and phases obtained from 128 images were merged to yield a 3D map (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>) with an in-plane resolution of 6 \u00c5 (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The unit cell contained two dimers, with one protomer in the asymmetric unit. The MjNhaP1 x-ray structure was fitted manually to the EM map to obtain an atomic model (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). A 3D difference map calculated between the experimental 6 \u00c5 EM density and the x-ray map truncated to this resolution indicated clear changes in the orientation of key helices (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). Of the interface helices, only H10 required a tilt of \u223c6\u00b0 about the helix center. Within the 6-helix bundle, H6 was tilted by \u223c14\u00b0 and H12<sub>E</sub> by \u223c15\u00b0. H5<sub>C</sub> and H5<sub>E</sub> changed direction by \u223c15\u00b0 and \u223c7\u00b0, respectively. The 6-helix bundle as a whole tilted by \u223c7\u00b0 towards the dimer interface on the cytoplasmic side and away from the dimer interface on the extracellular side, about an axis in the membrane plane roughly parallel to the dimer interface. On the cytoplasmic side of the EM model, H5<sub>C</sub> and H6 are closer to the interface than in the x-ray structure and obstruct access to the substrate-binding site. On the extracellular side, the tilt of the 6-helix bundle, especially of H6 and 12<sub>E</sub>, widens and deepens the exterior funnel. Whereas the x-ray structures of MjNhaP1 and PaNhaP (<a href=\"#bib48\">W\u00f6hlert et al., 2014</a>) both show the inward-open conformation, the EM structure of MjNhaP1 is closed on the cytoplasmic and open on the extracellular side (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>). We refer to this conformation as an \u2018outward-open\u2019 state of MjNhaP1. In the transition from inward-open to outward-open, the ion-binding site moves towards the extracellular side by about 5 \u00c5 (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>)."

It is instructive to compare this difference map to Figure 5 of an earlier paper that describes substrate-ion induced conformational changes in MjNhaP1 (<a href=\"#bib36\">Paulino and K\u00fchlbrandt, 2014</a>). <a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a> shows that the positions and relative strength of difference peaks between the inward-open and outward-open state are nearly identical to those that are observed when the 2D crystals of MjNhaP1 are taken from 0 mM NaCl to 500 mM NaCl, either at pH 8 or at pH 4. Together with the 3D data presented here, this allows us to conclude that an increase in NaCl concentration converts the antiporter from the outward-open conformation in the absence of salt to the inward-open conformation in the presence of salt."

The inward-open model of TtNapA implied that the 6-helix bundle moves up and down by 10 \u00c5 and rotates by 21\u00b0 about an axis roughly perpendicular to that in MjNhaP1 and ASBT. The similarity of the MjNhaP1 EM structure to the TtNapA x-ray structure suggests however that the inward-open state of TtNapA closely resembles the x-ray structure of MjNhaP1 rather than that of EcNhaA.

CPA2 antiporters, such as EcNhaA and TtNapA, exchange two protons against one Na<sup>+</sup>. One of the predicted motifs for the electrogenic transport is the DD motif in helix V in place of the ND motif in H6 of CPA1 antiporters, such as MjNhaP1 and PaNhaP (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). In CPA2 antiporters the two conserved aspartates have been proposed to each bind one of the translocated protons (<a href=\"#bib40\">Taglicht et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Hunte et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Arkin et al., 2007</a>). However, replacing N160 in the ND motif does not render MjNhaP1 electrogenic (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). The inactive N160A mutant (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>) shows that this sidechain is important for ion translocation, even though it does not participate in ion coordination directly. The reduced activity of the N160D mutant (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,C</a>) suggests a possible role in stabilizing the proton or substrate-bound state, which can also be fulfilled by an aspartate. Note that an asparagine in this position renders EcNhaA and TtNapA inactive (<a href=\"#bib24\">Inoue et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Lee et al., 2013a</a>), probably because it cannot form an ion bridge, as observed for Lys305 and Asp156 in TtNapA (<a href=\"#bib32\">Lee et al., 2013a</a>), which may be important for protein stability (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). In MjNhaP1 and PaNhaP the arginine replacing this lysine does not interact with the ND motif but forms an ion bridge to the neighboring conserved glutamate in H6 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), which would stabilize the 6-helix bundle. In terms of its overall structure, TtNapA is more similar to MjNhaP1 and PaNhaP than to EcNhaA (<a href=\"#bib23\">Hunte et al., 2005</a>), especially with respect to the relative position of the dimer interface with the seven helices. The tertiary structure of CPA antiporters thus does not correlate with their transport stoichiometry. There appear to be two types, one of which, represented by MjNhaP1, PaNhaP and TtNapA, is more common than the other type, that seems to be confined to EcNhaA and its close relatives."

Earlier studies (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hellmer et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Vinothkumar et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Goswami et al., 2011</a>) had found that MjNhaP1 is active at pH 6 but inactive at pH 7.5 or above. This discrepancy is due to the C-terminal affinity tag on the construct that was used in previous transport measurements (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hellmer et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Goswami et al., 2011</a>). We repeated the measurements with this tagged construct under symmetrical pH conditions and found that it was indeed inactive at pH 8 but active at pH 6 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Apparently the affinity tag at the C-terminus of H13, which is part of the 6-helix bundle, impairs the mobility of the bundle at elevated pH. This movement is an integral feature of the transport mechanism. For reliable functional measurements on flexible, conformationally active membrane transporters it is therefore advisable to use untagged proteins. <sup>22</sup>Na<sup>+</sup> uptake by untagged MjNhaP1 reconstituted at a high lipid/protein ratio into proteoliposomes acidified by an ammonium gradient also avoids other potential problems associated with the limited pH range of fluorescent dyes, everted vesicles energized by a process that is itself pH-dependent (<a href=\"#bib37\">Reenstra et al., 1980</a>), or with leaky proteoliposomes produced at low lipid/protein ratio (<a href=\"#bib43\">Tsai et al., 2013</a>)."

Our finding that proton-driven Na<sup>+</sup> uptake drops at decreasing external pH (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>) is in good agreement with the inverse experiment, which showed that Na<sup>+</sup> efflux in MjNhaP1 proteoliposomes increases under these conditions (<a href=\"#bib6\">Calinescu et al., 2014</a>). In the Na<sup>+</sup> uptake experiment, substrate ions bind less well from the outside at low external pH due to proton competition.

At any higher temperature, transport was too fast to be reliably recorded. The measured rate of 1.68 ions per second per protomer is more than 400 times higher than the transport rate of PaNhaP extrapolated to 0\u00b0C. The difference is most likely due to an extra acidic sidechain (Glu73) in the ion-binding site of PaNhaP, which has no equivalent in MjNhaP1. Removal of this sidechain in PaNhaP increases the transport rate, because the substrate ion is released more readily (<a href=\"#bib48\">W\u00f6hlert et al., 2014</a>). Although compared to EcNhaA (<a href=\"#bib40\">Taglicht et al., 1991</a>), neither MjNhaP1 nor PaNhaP are particularly fast at ambient conditions, the activity of PaNhaP increases exponentially with temperature to an extrapolated turnover number of 5000 ions per second at 100\u00b0C (<a href=\"#bib48\">W\u00f6hlert et al., 2014</a>).

The close resemblance of the MjNhaP1 and PaNhaP x-ray structures proves that there is no pH-induced conformational switch to regulate either antiporter. This is in excellent agreement with a recent study (<a href=\"#bib36\">Paulino and K\u00fchlbrandt, 2014</a>), which indicated that a change in pH in the absence of substrate ions has only minimal effects on the conformation of MjNhaP1, whereas Na<sup>+</sup>-binding induces helix movements that are similar in the entire activity range and consistent with the changes in helix orientation described here (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>).

They maintain an intracellular neutral pH by utilizing the inward Na<sup>+</sup> gradient that is always present in their native saline habitat. In PaNhaP, Na<sup>+</sup> coordination stabilizes the inward-open state, whereas the apo or proton-bound state of MjNhaP1 adopts the outward-open conformation (<a href=\"#bib36\">Paulino and K\u00fchlbrandt, 2014</a>). Thus, their default resting state is inward-open with a sodium ion in the binding site. As suggested for EcNhaA (<a href=\"#bib33\">Mager et al., 2011</a>) and recently shown for MjNhaP1 (<a href=\"#bib6\">Calinescu et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Paulino and K\u00fchlbrandt, 2014</a>), protons and Na<sup>+</sup> compete for a single binding site in the protomer. When the intracellular pH drops, the binding site becomes protonated and the Na<sup>+</sup> ion is released into the cytoplasm. The conformational changes we observe are consistent with a rocking bundle mechanism, as proposed for other secondary transporters (<a href=\"#bib16\">Forrest and Rudnick, 2009</a>). The rocking movement of the 6-helix bundle controls alternating access to the ion-binding site from the outside medium or from the cell interior (<a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>)."

Antiport activity of MjNhaP1 establishes a \u0394pH across the membrane, observed as acridine orange quenching. As a control, (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> was added to a final concentration of 25 mM at the end of the reaction to dissipate the pH gradient. Measurements were performed at 25\u00b0C and acridine orange fluorescence was monitored at 530 nm (excitation: 495 nm) in a Hitachi fluorimeter."

Transport was stopped by filtering the proteoliposomes on 0.2 \u00b5m nitrocellulose filters and washing with 3 ml ice-cold <sup>22</sup>Na-free reaction buffer. Before counting, filters were transferred to counting tubes and 4 ml scintillation cocktail (Rotiszint, Roth, Germany) was added.

Figure 8\u2013figure supplement 1D in our revised manuscript is an adaptation of <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> in that paper (top row, 500 mM NaCl, brought to the same phase origin for consistency). The virtually identical positions and intensities of difference peaks in the two maps indicate clearly that the difference between no salt and 500 mM NaCl at pH8 (or at pH4, for that matter, see bottom row in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> of Paulino &amp; K\u00fchlbrandt, <i>eLife</i> 2014) is the same as between the inward-open and outward-open conformation of MjNhaP1. This allows us to relate the conformational changes we observed in response to ionic conditions in the earlier paper to the 3D structures of the inward-open or outward-open state presented in the present manuscript. Note that this was not possible before, because the earlier paper (Paulino &amp; K\u00fchlbrandt, <i>eLife</i> 2014) did not contain any 3D information.

In particular the conformational changes in MjNhaP1 and the structurally related bile acid symporter ASBT, for which high-resolution x-ray structures of both the inward-open and the outward-open state are available, are strikingly similar, as shown in <a href=\"#media3\">supplementary video 3</a>.

Therefore this structure represents the inward-open state of MjNhaP1. In the inward-open state, the extracellular funnel in MjNhaP1 is both deeper and wider than that of PaNhaP, but it does not extend to the ion-binding site, as shown in <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>. In the outward-open EM structure the extracellular funnel deepens and widens further, making the substrate-binding site accessible from the extracellular side. In this state, access from the cytoplasm is blocked by the cytoplasmic halves of helices 5 and 6. Hence the EM structure obtained at pH4 in absence of sodium is in the outward-open state.

To avoid any possible confusion, we have omitted the former <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a> from the revised manuscript, which did show acridine orange measurements, but had been included only to demonstrate transport under symmetrical pH conditions."

This is a useful finding of this study and an excellent counter to the criticism that both structures reported in accompanying paper of Wohlert et al. represent the inactive transporter. In this respect, it would have been helpful to see the MjNhaP and PaNhaP structures presented side by side in the same paper</i>."

It is noted that the replacement of this His with Cys crosslinks the dimer interface in PaNhaP, with corresponding loss of function, but it was not shown that formation of the disulfide bond is pH dependent. Therefore, the attribution of non-cooperativity in MjNhaP to the absence of this His, or to stable salt bridges, is speculative and could have been tested more thoroughly</i>."
