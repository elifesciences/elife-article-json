The force for constriction is thought to involve actin polymerization by the ER-anchored isoform of the formin protein inverted formin 2 (INF2). Unknown is the mechanism triggering INF2-mediated actin polymerization at ER-mitochondria intersections. We show that a novel isoform of the formin-binding, actin-nucleating protein Spire, Spire1C, localizes to mitochondria and directly links mitochondria to the actin cytoskeleton and the ER. Spire1C binds INF2 and promotes actin assembly on mitochondrial surfaces. Disrupting either Spire1C actin- or formin-binding activities reduces mitochondrial constriction and division. We propose Spire1C cooperates with INF2 to regulate actin assembly at ER-mitochondrial contacts. Simulations support this model's feasibility and demonstrate polymerizing actin filaments can induce mitochondrial constriction. Thus, Spire1C is optimally positioned to serve as a molecular hub that links mitochondria to actin and the ER for regulation of mitochondrial division."

The force for constriction is thought to involve actin polymerization by the ER-anchored isoform of the formin protein inverted formin 2 (INF2). Unknown is the mechanism triggering INF2-mediated actin polymerization at ER-mitochondria intersections. We show that a novel isoform of the formin-binding, actin-nucleating protein Spire, Spire1C, localizes to mitochondria and directly links mitochondria to the actin cytoskeleton and the ER. Spire1C binds INF2 and promotes actin assembly on mitochondrial surfaces. Disrupting either Spire1C actin- or formin-binding activities reduces mitochondrial constriction and division. We propose Spire1C cooperates with INF2 to regulate actin assembly at ER-mitochondrial contacts. Simulations support this model's feasibility and demonstrate polymerizing actin filaments can induce mitochondrial constriction. Thus, Spire1C is optimally positioned to serve as a molecular hub that links mitochondria to actin and the ER for regulation of mitochondrial division."

Spire1C is found on the outer membrane of mitochondria; it interacts with INF2 to drive the formation of actin filaments that constrict mitochondria. These results suggest that Spire1C bridges the endoplasmic reticulum with the network of actin filaments. Further experiments then showed that increasing Spire1C levels in cells resulted in the mitochondria becoming fragmented due to increased constriction. On the other hand, depleting Spire1C had the opposite effect and caused mitochondria to become unusually elongated. Following on from this work, the next challenge is to see if Spire1C is used differently or similarly in the different processes that involve mitochondrial fission."

Scission is mediated by the dynamin-related protein, Drp1, which self-assembles on the surface of the mitochondrial outer membrane into helices that drive final mitochondrial division (<a href=\"#bib33\">Lackner and Nunnari, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Archer, 2014</a>).

Because of its alternative ExonC sequence, we named the Spire1 isoform Spire1C (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). After determining that Spire1C mRNA was present in multiple mouse tissues (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), we examined its presence and conservation among species. Using the UCSC Genome Browser, we searched for additional DNA or mRNA sequences that contain Spire1C (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kent et al., 2002</a>). When compared to mouse, we found striking identity in ExonC for rat, rabbit, human, dog, elephant, opossum, platypus, and chicken. It is not found in the annotated zebrafish sequence. Compared to our amplified mouse sequence of 58 amino acids, human ExonC differs by 2 residues (96% identical), platypus by 8 residues (86% identical), and chicken by 12 residues (79% identical). Sequence homology is strongest among mammals, but chicken maintains conservation that is unlikely to be solely due to chance. Conservation among species extends beyond the coding exon and into the upstream and downstream intronic regions of the gene, stretching \u223c150 bases in the 3\u2032 direction (data not shown). These conserved extensions are likely involved in splicing regulation of the exon. The high level of conservation within and surrounding ExonC suggests that its role is indispensible for the health of the organism."

GFP was fused to the N-terminus of Spire1C (GFP-Spire1C), the N-terminus of ExonC (GFP-ExonC), or to the C-terminus of ExonC (ExonC-GFP) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). The constructs were then co-expressed in cells with OMI-mCherry, a mitochondrial intermembrane space (IMS) protein (<a href=\"#bib42\">Mu\u00f1oz-Pinedo et al., 2006</a>). Thereafter, the plasma membrane of the cells was gently permeabilized with digitonin, followed by treatment with trypsin to extinguish cytoplasmic GFP fluorescence. Because mitochondrial membranes are not permeabilized by digitonin treatment, we reasoned that only if the fluorescent tag from these constructs faced the cytoplasm would their fluorescence be abolished by the trypsin. Both GFP-Spire1C and GFP-ExonC lost nearly all their fluorescence within 60 seconds of trypsin treatment. By contrast, fluorescence from ExonC-GFP was protected, similar to that seen for co-expressed OMI-mCherry, which as a mitochondrial IMS protein should be insensitive to trypsin (<a href=\"#bib42\">Mu\u00f1oz-Pinedo et al., 2006</a>) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>; <a href=\"#media1 media2 media3\">Videos 1\u20133</a>). These results suggest that the WH2 and KIND domains of Spire1C face the cytoplasm (since both reside N-terminal to ExonC) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>), a topology where they could participate in formin-binding and actin-nucleation activity. The data further suggest that the C-terminus of ExonC is not exposed to the cytoplasm. This raises the possibility that ExonC is embedded in the outer membrane, either as a transmembrane or hairpin protein."

To test this directly, we assessed the effect of Spire1C overexpression, mutation and depletion on mitochondrial morphology, length, and fission. While all cells in all conditions in this study displayed a combination of fragmented and tubular mitochondria, overexpression of Spire1C resulted in a significant shift towards fragmented mitochondria compared to control cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, +Spire1C). In contrast, overexpression of Spire1C mWH2 or Spire1C\u0394KIND resulted in a shift towards tubular mitochondria (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Depletion of Spire1C using shRNA also resulted in a shift towards tubular mitochondria (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). To quantify these changes, we measured mitochondrial lengths in each of these conditions, and found that Spire1C overexpression resulted in shorter mitochondria on average, whereas mutation or depletion of Spire1C resulted in longer mitochondria (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, left graph, and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), resembling the effect of disrupting mitochondrial fission due to the depletion of Drp1 or INF2 from cells (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bleazard et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Labrousse et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Wakabayashi et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Korobova et al., 2013</a>, <a href=\"#bib31\">2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Hatch et al., 2014</a>). To determine whether these morphological changes were a result of altered mitochondrial fission dynamics, we counted the number of mitochondrial fission events in each of these conditions. We found that fission events increased in frequency when cells were overexpressing Spire1C, whereas overexpression of Spire1C mWH2 or Spire1C\u0394KIND decreased the frequency of fission events (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, right graph). Similarly, shRNA-mediated knockdown of Spire1C decreased the frequency of fission events (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, right graph). Taken together, our results show Spire1C promotes mitochondrial fission via Spire1C's actin-nucleating and formin-binding capabilities."

To test this hypothesis, we first asked whether removing the KIND domain from Spire1C blocks the increase in mitochondrial division associated with overexpressing a constitutively active INF2 mutant, INF2 A149 (<a href=\"#bib30\">Korobova et al., 2013</a>, <a href=\"#bib31\">2014</a>). Consistent with previous reports (<a href=\"#bib30\">Korobova et al., 2013</a>, <a href=\"#bib31\">2014</a>), we found that overexpressing INF2 A149 resulted in significant shortening of mitochondria (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C,E</a>; A149 alone). Similarly, co-overexpression of INF2 A149 and Spire1C or INF2 A149 and Spire1C mWH2 resulted in very short, fragmented mitochondria (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C,E</a> +Spire1C or +Spire1C mWH2). By contrast, overexpression of INF2 A149 and Spire1C\u0394KIND significantly disrupted INF2 A149-mediated mitochondrial fragmentation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>, +Spire1C\u0394KIND). These results suggest that while Spire1C actin-nucleating activity may be unnecessary for mitochondrial fission when INF2 is constitutively active, INF2 binding to the Spire1C KIND domain is necessary for INF2 to maximally induce mitochondrial fission. In further confirmation of the hypothesis that Spire1C and INF2 jointly work to drive mitochondrial fission, we found that siRNA-mediated knockdown of INF2 disrupted Spire1C-mediated upregulation of mitochondrial fission (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). Taken together, the results suggest that Spire1C interacts with INF2 via Spire1C's KIND domain, and that this interaction promotes mitochondrial fission."

To test this hypothesis, we employed confocal fluorescence imaging of ER and mitochondria to examine mitochondrial constriction sites in cells co-expressing the ER marker Ii33-mCherry and different variants of Spire1C. Mitochondria constriction was visible at sites of ER-mitochondria crossover slightly more frequently in cells overexpressing Spire1C compared to cells not overexpressing the construct (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,B</a>, Spire1C, see arrows for ER-mediated mitochondrial constrictions, and arrowheads for ER-mitochondria intersections that didn't result in constrictions). Notably, cells overexpressing Spire1C mWH2 displayed significantly fewer mitochondrial constrictions at ER-mitochondria intersections (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,B</a>, Spire1C mWH2). Similarly, cells overexpressing Spire1C\u0394KIND showed a decrease in the frequency of constrictions at ER-mitochondria intersections (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,B</a>, Spire1C\u0394KIND). RNA-mediated Spire1C knockdown also resulted in decreased constrictions (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,B</a>, Spire1C shRNA). Finally, overexpressing Spire1C in cells treated with INF2 siRNA showed a significant reduction in mitochondrial constrictions (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,B</a>, INF2 siRNA + Spire1C). Taken together, our results suggest that Spire1C and INF2 work together to promote mitochondrial division by driving ER-mediated mitochondrial constriction, and that this process is dependent on Spire1C's ability to nucleate actin filaments on mitochondrial surfaces, as well as the ability for Spire1C and INF2 to interact via the Spire1C KIND domain."

Given this, Spire proteins are potential candidates for regulating the actin polymerization activity of INF2 on mitochondrial membranes. In searching for such a protein, we identified a specific isoform of Spire1, Spire1C, which resides on mitochondria and interacts with INF2. Spire1C is distinct from other Spire proteins in having mitochondrial outer membrane localization. This localization is a result of Spire1C's unique ExonC domain, which serves as a mitochondria-targeting sequence. Spire1C undergoes lateral diffusion on the mitochondrial outer membrane, and is oriented with its formin-binding and actin-nucleating domains facing the cytoplasm. Spire1C promotes actin assembly on mitochondrial outer membranes; when Spire1C is overexpressed a massive buildup of actin around mitochondria is observed. The actin buildup is dependent on Spire1C's actin-nucleating WH2 domain, but not its formin-binding KIND domain. Therefore, Spire1C's canonical actin-nucleating domain drives actin accumulation on mitochondria independently of its interactions with formin proteins."

Overexpressing Spire1C increases mitochondrial division rates while depleting Spire1C has the opposite effect, causing mitochondria to become highly elongated. Because the increased fission seen in cells overexpressing Spire1C depends not only on Spire1C's actin-nucleating WH2 domain but also its formin-binding KIND domain, we reasoned that Spire1C-mediated mitochondrial fission also depended on formin proteins. Given INF2's previously established role as a formin protein involved in ER-mediated mitochondrial constriction and division (<a href=\"#bib30\">Korobova et al., 2013</a>, <a href=\"#bib31\">2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Hatch et al., 2014</a>), we hypothesized that Spire1C could be working together with INF2. We postulated that Spire1C could be promoting mitochondrial division by interacting with ER-anchored INF2, in order to enable mitochondria to come into close proximity with the ER so that actin-nucleation by Spire1C could enhance actin assembly mediated by INF2. Supporting this possibility, we found in GST pulldown and fluorescence anisotropy assays that the Spire1C KIND domain directly binds to INF2. In cells overexpressing Spire1C lacking its KIND domain-mediated INF2-binding activity (Spire1C\u0394KIND) or its actin-nucleating activity (Spire1C mWH2), ER-mitochondria associations leading to mitochondrial constrictions were significantly decreased. Moreover, overexpressing Spire1C\u0394KIND prevented mitochondria from dividing in cells expressing a constitutively active INF2 mutant (INF2 A149) that normally induces dramatic mitochondrial fission (<a href=\"#bib30\">Korobova et al., 2013</a>, <a href=\"#bib31\">2014</a>). Finally, Spire1C overexpression in cells lacking INF2 failed to induce mitochondrial fission."

In this scheme, Spire1C:actin complexes on mitochondria associate with INF2 on the ER, acting together with other ER-mitochondria tethering complexes (<a href=\"#bib58\">Rowland and Voeltz, 2012</a>) to draw the two organelles together. This results in the ER wrapping around the mitochondria. Once this occurs, actin filaments nucleated by Spire1C are elongated by the actin polymerization activity of INF2, similar to the \u2018rocket launcher\u2019 mechanism shown for other actin nucleating and formin proteins (<a href=\"#bib9\">Breitsprecher et al., 2012</a>). Because INF2 can both polymerize and sever actin filaments, a complex meshwork of actin grows between the ER and mitochondria, which may be further impacted by myosin-II dimer recruitment (<a href=\"#bib21\">Hatch et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Korobova et al., 2014</a>) as well as perhaps other actin-regulatory proteins such as cofilin or Arp2/3 (<a href=\"#bib15\">Derivery et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Liu et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Li et al., 2015</a>). The growing actin meshwork between the ER and mitochondria then exerts pressure on the mitochondrial outer membrane causing its constriction. Our computational modeling of this process confirmed that polymerizing actin filaments from this meshwork has sufficient force to bend and constrict the mitochondrial membrane once the filaments abut the mitochondria surface."

First, a better understanding of how Spire1C and INF2 interact with and regulate one another's activities during mitochondrial constriction is required. The relatively low affinity between Spire1C's KIND domain and INF2 detected in our assays, if applicable to living cells, is consistent with Spire1C:INF2 dissociation once INF2 begins to elongate actin filaments. Second, as several proteins are known to tether ER-mitochondrial membranes (<a href=\"#bib58\">Rowland and Voeltz, 2012</a>), the role of these proteins in promoting or disrupting Spire1C's interaction with INF2 also needs to be studied. Such interactions may underlie differences in the mode of mitochondrial division seen in cells undergoing apoptosis, mitophagy, mitosis, or in response to toxins such as LLO from <i>Listeria</i> (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chan, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Hoppins and Nunnari, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Youle and van der Bliek, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Stavru et al., 2013</a>). Finally, the precise organization of the actin meshwork responsible for constricting mitochondria needs to be characterized at higher resolution. This will help determine whether the actin meshwork constricts mitochondria by myosin-mediated contraction, by elongating filaments pushing, or by a combination of both."

This list is almost certainly not exhaustive; there may yet be other known and unknown roles for the actin cytoskeleton in mitochondrial biology, and vice versa. Interestingly, Spire1C directly interacts with the tail domain of myosin Va (data not shown), an actin-binding motor protein that has been shown to be involved in both mitochondrial and ER movement in neurons (<a href=\"#bib66\">Wagner et al., 2011</a>). In other cellular systems myosin Vb, Rab11a, and Spire proteins cooperate to drive actin-based vesicle movements and dynamics (<a href=\"#bib60\">Schuh, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Montaville et al., 2014</a>)\u2014perhaps similar mechanisms exist for mitochondrial movements. Along these lines, it is interesting to note that Rab11a has also been implicated in mitochondrial dynamics (<a href=\"#bib34\">Landry et al., 2014</a>)\u2014exploring these findings in the context of Spire1C function may provide new insight towards mitochondrial movements and dynamics, and perhaps the relationship between actin-dependent motility and actin-dependent fission. Finally, the recent discovery of a role for the ER in mediating endosomal constriction and division raises the possibility that endosomal isoforms of Spire (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kerkhoff, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Liu et al., 2009</a>) are playing a similar role in promoting ER/actin/INF2-mediated endosomal fission. In fact, results from previous studies suggest that overexpression of the endosomal Spire2 protein lacking its KIND domain may result in endosome elongation (<a href=\"#bib16\">Dietrich et al., 2013</a>), which would be analogous to what we have observed for Spire1C\u0394KIND overexpression and mitochondria."

Five angles of the excitation grid with five phases each were acquired for each channel and each z-plane, which were spaced at 110 nm each. SIM processing was performed using the SIM module of the Zeiss Zen software package. 16-bit grayscale tiffs were subsequently exported to ImageJ for quantification and processing into rendered colored images. Channels in maximum projection images were aligned in the xy-plane using maximum projection images of fluorescent beads."

When calculating Pearson's values, the mitochondria channel was used as a mask for colocalization. ER-mitochondria intersection sites were visually identified as regions where ER tubules could be clearly visualized crossing mitochondria\u2014these regions were always in the periphery of the cell, significantly restricting the total number of intersections that could be reliably identified. Mitochondria constriction sites were visually identified as regions defined by relative narrowing of mitochondria diameter or reduced fluorescence. Magnifications of boxed regions were generated using ImageJ. Color images of merged 16-bit tiffs exported from the microscope were generated using the ImageJ \u2018merge channels\u2019 function. Statistical analysis was performed using Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, Washington). p-values were determined using the unpaired Student's <i>t</i>-test or ANOVA, as appropriate."

Here Manor et al. show that a specific splice-variant of an actin nucleating protein Spire (named Spire1C) localizes to the mitochondria outer membrane through a specific a-helical motif encoded by its alternate exon C. Importantly, they demonstrate that Spire1C promotes actin filament assembly at the mitochondrial surfaces and modulates mitochondrial fission through its actin-binding WH2 domains and its KIND domain, which specifically binds to INF2 formin. Collectively, these studies provide evidence that Spire1C and INF2 cooperate to form mitochondria-ER intersections, and to promote efficient actin filament assembly specifically at these sites."

While the average mitochondrial lengths significantly changed depending on Spire or INF2 activities, nearly every cell has some mitochondria that are very short, and at least a couple that are longer. For the sake of clarity in some of our experiments (for example the FRAP data in Figure 2, actin accumulation on mitochondria in Figure 3, or the ER-mitochondria intersection data in Figure 5), we used cells with longer mitochondria in order to be able to make measurements as necessary (i.e. photobleaching only a small segment of very short mitochondria is nearly impossible, measuring ER-mitochondria intersections in cells where all the mitochondria are already fragmented is similarly impossible, and actin around fragmented mitochondria is more difficult to detect than on tubulated mitochondria where a continuous line of actin accumulation is more easily detectable within the already large amount of F-actin throughout the cytoplasm). In order to clarify our data in this regard, we have added as a supplemental figure a histogram showing the distribution of mitochondrial lengths for each condition (Figure 4\u2013figure supplement 1)."

While our FPP assay leaves us confident that the C-terminus of ExonC is protected from the cytoplasm, we were unable to draw any conclusions from these assays as to the localization of the Spire1C C-terminus. While the secondary protein structure prediction software PHYRE identifies two putative alpha-helices within ExonC, only one of those helices was predicted to be a transmembrane domain by predictive software, so we chose not to postulate that there are two transmembrane domains in ExonC. However, we agree that the hairpin model the reviewers have proposed is just as likely to be correct, and is furthermore appealing since this would allow for the C-terminal domain of Spire1C to interact with other cytoplasmic proteins."

In order to address the reviewers\u2019 comments, we performed an additional FPP assay using a new Spire1C-GFP construct with GFP on the C-terminus. Unfortunately, when we expressed this construct, the protein no longer localized properly to mitochondria, instead displaying a mostly cytoplasmic localization pattern (with barely detectable accumulation on mitochondria). Due to this disrupted localization pattern, we were unable to draw any conclusions from an FPP assay; upon addition of digitonin, all of the GFP fluorescence was almost immediately depleted, even without subsequent addition of trypsin. While this result may give some clue as to how Spire1C localizes to the OM, many more experiments that go beyond the scope of this work would have to be performed in order to determine what this result is telling us. Thus, we have mentioned these latest findings in the text, and modified our interpretation of our FPP data to include the likely possibility that Spire1C\u2019s ExonC localizes in a hairpin or horizontal fashion on the outer leaflet of the outer mitochondrial membrane."
