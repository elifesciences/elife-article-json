We used DamID to establish a robust set of target genes for NKX2-5 wild type and disease associated NKX2-5 mutations to model loss-of-function in gene regulatory networks. NKX2-5 mutants, including those with a crippled homeodomain, bound hundreds of targets including NKX2-5 wild type targets and a unique set of \"off-targets\", and retained partial functionality. NKX\u0394HD, which lacks the homeodomain completely, could heterodimerize with NKX2-5 wild type and its cofactors, including E26 transformation-specific (ETS) family members, through a tyrosine-rich homophilic interaction domain (YRD). Off-targets of NKX2-5 mutants, but not those of an NKX2-5 YRD mutant, showed overrepresentation of ETS binding sites and were occupied by ETS proteins, as determined by DamID. Analysis of kernel transcription factor and ETS targets show that ETS proteins are highly embedded within the cardiac gene regulatory network. Our study reveals binding and activities of NKX2-5 mutations on WT target and off-targets, guided by interactions with their normal cardiac and general cofactors, and suggest a novel type of gain-of-function in congenital heart disease."

We used DamID to establish a robust set of target genes for NKX2-5 wild type and disease associated NKX2-5 mutations to model loss-of-function in gene regulatory networks. NKX2-5 mutants, including those with a crippled homeodomain, bound hundreds of targets including NKX2-5 wild type targets and a unique set of \"off-targets\", and retained partial functionality. NKX\u0394HD, which lacks the homeodomain completely, could heterodimerize with NKX2-5 wild type and its cofactors, including E26 transformation-specific (ETS) family members, through a tyrosine-rich homophilic interaction domain (YRD). Off-targets of NKX2-5 mutants, but not those of an NKX2-5 YRD mutant, showed overrepresentation of ETS binding sites and were occupied by ETS proteins, as determined by DamID. Analysis of kernel transcription factor and ETS targets show that ETS proteins are highly embedded within the cardiac gene regulatory network. Our study reveals binding and activities of NKX2-5 mutations on WT target and off-targets, guided by interactions with their normal cardiac and general cofactors, and suggest a novel type of gain-of-function in congenital heart disease."

The cardiomyocyte GRN is controlled by lineage-restricted transcription factors (TFs), which interact to form a recursively wired sub-network termed the cardiac \u2018kernel\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib18\">Davidson and Erwin, 2006</a>). Kernel TFs, such as NKX2-5, GATA4, TBX5/20, and serum response factor (SRF), show regionally restricted expression and act as selector proteins that help define developmental and organ-specific territories. A well-studied kernel TF is NKX2-5, a member of the NK-2 homeodomain (HD) factor subclass that plays an early role in development of hearts and heart-like organs of diverse species (<a href=\"#bib24\">Elliott et al., 2010</a>). Loss of <i>Nkx2-5</i> in mice leads to arrested heart morphogenesis due to blocked progenitor growth, defective chamber and conduction system development, and a deranged GRN (<a href=\"#bib63\">Prall et al., 2007</a>). In humans, NKX2-5 is one of the most commonly mutated single genes in congenital heart disease (CHD), with dominant alleles causing atrial septal defect and atrioventricular conduction block most commonly, and a host of more severe defects at lower penetrance (<a href=\"#bib24\">Elliott et al., 2010</a>). Many CHD-causing NKX2-5 mutations are located within the conserved HD (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), which serves as both a sequence-specific DNA-binding domain and protein-binding interface for interactions with other kernel TFs (<a href=\"#bib24\">Elliott et al., 2010</a>). It is widely assumed that CHD is caused by haploinsufficiency and an inability of mutant proteins to recognise target genes. However, we know little about disease causation at the genome level, and in fact, most CHD mutations lie outside of the HD (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), often in conserved domains with largely unknown functions."

We applied the technique of DNA adenine methyltransferase identification (DamID) (<a href=\"#bib81\">Vogel et al., 2006</a>) to identify target genes of NKX2-5 wild type and NKX2-5 mutant proteins mimicking those found in patients with CHD. While binding of severe NKX2-5 mutants to targets was compromised, they nonetheless associated with hundreds of targets, including many normally bound by NKX2-5 wild type, and could regulate a subset of these in cellular assays. We demonstrate that severe NKX2-5 mutant proteins retained an ability to interact with NKX2-5 wild type and other cardiac TFs via a novel tyrosine-rich protein:protein interface in NKX2-5 that lies outside of the HD. NKX2-5 mutant proteins also bound hundreds of \u2018off-targets\u2019 not bound by NKX2-5 wild type, via altered DNA-recognition or via interactions with previously unrecognised cofactors. These cofactors, which include members of the ETS family, are embedded in the cardiac GRN, indicating a broad role for ubiquitous TFs in cardiac network logic and mechanism of CHD."

                                "text": "DamID is a sensitive enzymatic method developed to identify protein:DNA interactions (<a href=\"#bib80\">van Steensel and Henikoff, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">van Steensel et al., 2001</a>). It is complementary to chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) but avoids artifacts associated with chromatin crosslinking and poor-quality ChIP antibodies (<a href=\"#bib84\">Waldminghaus and Skarstad, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Teytelman et al., 2013</a>). DamID involves creation of a fusion between a chromatin-binding protein of interest and <i>Escherichia coli</i> DNA adenine methyltransferase (Dam). When expressed, Dam fusions bind to DNA, whereby Dam locally methylates adenine within its target sites (5\u2032GATC3\u2032). Target DNA can then be released using <i>Dpn</i>I, a nuclease specific for the methylated Dam site, and analysed on arrays (<a href=\"#bib81\">Vogel et al., 2006</a>)."

Mouse <i>Nkx2-5</i> cDNAs were cloned into a lentiviral Dam vector carrying heat shock and ponasterone A-inducible promoters (<a href=\"#bib81\">Vogel et al., 2006</a>). Only N-terminal Dam fusions (Dam-NKX2-5) were analysed because C-terminal fusions were sterically compromised (data not shown). Ponasterone A induction after viral transduction of HEK Ecr-293 cells confirmed nuclear localisation and the correct size of fusions (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Transduction of HL-1 cells was efficient (\u223c97%; <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). DamID fusions were expressed from the uninduced <i>heat shock protein 68</i> promoter at very low levels (undetectable by western blotting), which was sufficient for Dam enzymatic activity on chromatin (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>) but avoided skewing of the network. DamID is dependent on the density of <i>Dpn</i>I sites (5\u2032GATC3\u2032), which occur on average every 260 bp in the mouse genome, as in the fly genome (<a href=\"#bib80\">van Steensel and Henikoff, 2000</a>). After <i>Dpn</i>I digestion of virus-transduced HL-1 cell DNA, PCR-amplification lead to fragments of \u223c200-2000 bp (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). We determined that of all perfect NKX2-5 high-affinity binding sites (NKE; 5\u2032AAGTG3\u2032) in the mouse genome, 90% had a <i>Dpn</i>I site within 1 kb upstream and downstream (median of \u223c289 bp), suggesting that DamID captures the vast majority of NKX2-5 direct targets."

De novo motif discovery using <i>Weeder</i> or <i>Trawler</i> (<a href=\"#bib61\">Pavesi and Pesole, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Haudry et al., 2010</a>) revealed that the top 3 over-represented motifs were 5\u2032AAGTG3\u2032, identical to the NKE; 5\u2032GATAA3\u2032, identical to the GATA-binding motif; and 5\u2032TGCCAA3\u2032, similar to the binding motif of Nuclear Factor 1 (NF1) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). After counting of their exact sequences, the NKE was present in 79% of NKX2-5 peaks, with half of these bearing over 2 and up to 12 NKEs. The GATA- and NF1-binding motifs were present in 59% and 36% of peaks, respectively (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). These results suggest that the majority of NKX2-5 WT targets are directly bound via the NKE and also support the combinatorial action of NKX2-5 with GATA factors on many targets (<a href=\"#bib21\">Durocher et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">He et al., 2011</a>). NKX2-5 did not bind directly to the NF1-like site in vitro (<a href=\"#fig1s6\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 6</a>), suggesting that NKX2-5 could act in combination with NF1 in HL-1 cells. Using a yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) assay, we showed that NKX2-5 interacted with NF1-B1 and NF1-B3 but not NF1-A or NF1-X (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>), as for the related family members NKX2-1 and NF1 in lung (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bachurski et al., 2003</a>). This suggests that NF1-B1/3 regulate a subset of target genes in combination with NKX2-5 in cardiomyocytes."

Gene Ontology (GO) analysis of DamID NKX2-5 targets showed that the most enriched biological processes were <i>heart development</i> and <i>muscle contraction</i> (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>), attesting to the specificity of DamID. The most represented words amongst the top 50 GO terms, were <i>muscle</i>, <i>development</i>, <i>regulation</i>, <i>cardiac</i>, and <i>cell</i>. Other enriched processes included <i>cytoskeleton organisation</i> and related terms, and metabolic GO terms such as <i>regulation of cellular carbohydrate catabolic process</i>, <i>regulation of glycolysis</i>, and <i>regulation of generation of precursor metabolites and energy</i>, indicating that NKX2-5 exerts high-level network control over metabolic processes."

We first constructed N-terminal Dam fusions for the human CHD mutation NKX2-5Y191C (<a href=\"#bib3\">Benson et al., 1999</a>), which disrupts tyrosine 54 of the HD, necessary for the unique binding site specificity of the NK-2 homeoprotein sub-class to the NKE (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). In vitro, NKX2-5Y191C dimerises normally with co-factors but shows 80-fold reduced binding to the NKE (<a href=\"#bib45\">Kasahara et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Kasahara and Benson, 2004</a>). We also created NKX2-5\u2206HD, in which the HD was deleted and replaced by a glycine-linker. We anticipated that NKX2-5\u2206HD would be functionally dead, since the HD has been shown to serve as both DNA-binding domain and interface for homo- and hetero-dimerisation (<a href=\"#bib24\">Elliott et al., 2010</a>). However, we were interested in testing whether the presence of other conserved domains in NKX2-5 and often mutated in NKX2-5-related CHD (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) could confer any functionality to the NKX2-5 mutants. Both mutants were stable (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplements 1, 6</a>) and, as anticipated, did not bind efficiently to the NKE of the known target <i>Nppa</i> (natriuretic peptide precursor A) (<a href=\"#bib22\">Durocher et al., 1996</a>) in vitro (<a href=\"#fig1s6\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 6</a>)."

NKX2-5Y191C peaks also showed over-representation of the motif 5\u2032TAATC3\u2032, which is similar to the binding sites of many non-NK-2 class HD proteins, including HOX proteins, as well as that of NK-2 proteins that lack HD tyrosine 54, such as NKX1-2 (<a href=\"#bib4\">Berger et al., 2008</a>). NK-2 class proteins which do carry Y54 in their HDs, including NKX2-5, also bind to this HOX-like site, albeit with a 10-fold-reduced affinity compared to that of the NKE (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chen and Schwartz, 1995</a>).

Hence we sought to confirm using an independent approach that these mutants could interact with chromatin in vivo. We employed photoactivatable fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (paFCS) (<a href=\"#bib48\">Kaur et al., 2013</a>), measuring the diffusion dynamics of NKX2-5 WT and mutants within individual HL-1 nuclei (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Expression vectors encoding NKX2-5 proteins fused to photoactivatable GFP (paGFP) were introduced by transfection. As for other TFs, NKX2-5 WT showed a biphasic behaviour, with a freely diffusing fraction similar to paGFP (adjusted for molecular mass) and a slower, chromatin-interacting fraction. NKX2-5 WT displayed slower diffusion (dwell time \u03c4D<sub>slow</sub> = 121 ms) than that mutants (NKX2-5Y191C: \u03c4D<sub>slow</sub> = 64 ms; NKX2-5\u0394HD: \u03c4D<sub>slow</sub> = 11 ms), which diffused more slowly than paGFP alone (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B-D</a>). This confirmed that NKX2-5Y191C and NKX2-5\u0394HD physically interact with chromatin (<a href=\"#bib48\">Kaur et al., 2013</a>) and suggests that a gradation in chromatin tethering correlates with the apparent severity of the NKX2-5 mutation (WT&gt;Y191C&gt;\u0394HD&gt;paGFP)."

The NKE was significantly enriched in both A and B sets, showing that A and B sets contain direct NKX2-5 targets. A- and B-sets also exhibited distinct enrichment signatures for many known TF motifs, for example, those for cardiac kernel TFs GATA4, HAND1, and MEF2 were only enriched in the B-set of the NKX2-5 WT/\u2206HD comparison. Thus, both mutants can bind a subset of direct WT targets despite crippled DNA binding. This likely occurs via dimerisation with endogenous NKX2-5 WT and/or its cofactors (see below and [<a href=\"#bib45\">Kasahara et al., 2000</a>]). Indeed, for NKX2-5\u2206HD, which completely lacks a DNA-binding domain, our data suggest that a protein:protein interface within NKX2-5 that is distinct from the HD can guide the mutant protein to NKX2-5 WT targets."

NKX25\u2206HD was nuclear in only 15% of cells at day 6 (likely due to deletion of the nuclear localisation signal within the HD; <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>) and had no effect on cardiac or endothelial cell differentiation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E-F</a>) and so was not considered further. NKX2-5Y191C was nuclear and, while showing no effects on myocardial progenitors or endothelial cells in three independent experiments, showed a trend towards inhibition of cardiomyocyte numbers at day 8 (\u223c44%; p = 0.079), suggesting that it also retained some repressive activity in this assay."

The majority of both A (8/12) and B (12/13) set genes tested were modulated &gt;1.5 fold by NKX2-5 WT (total 20/25), providing strong evidence that DamID selects NKX2-5 WT developmental targets. Within B-set genes, most were repressed by NKX2-5 WT, consistent with the repression of cardiogenesis by NKX2-5 WT at early stages of cardiac lineage specification (<a href=\"#bib63\">Prall et al., 2007</a>). A subset of A and B set genes was also regulated by NKX2-5Y191C (A-set: 3/12; B-set: 4/13; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>), despite no change in early myocardial progenitors in the NKX2-5Y191C line, with regulation by Y191C being in the same direction as for NKX2-5 WT.

While dimerisation to NKX2-5 WT has been demonstrated for NKX2-5Y191C (<a href=\"#bib43\">Kasahara and Benson, 2004</a>), it was surprising for NKX2-5\u0394HD because the HD has been previously described as being essential for NKX2-5 homodimerisation (<a href=\"#bib24\">Elliott et al., 2010</a>). Transfected NKX2-5\u2206HD was largely cytoplasmic in CV-1 cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), which lack endogenous NKX2-5. This is likely a consequence of the deletion of the NKX2-5 nuclear localisation signal located in the amino terminus of the HD (<a href=\"#bib44\">Kasahara and Izumo, 1999</a>). However, NKX2-5\u2206HD became nuclear when co-expressed with NKX2-5 WT, which itself was nuclear when transfected alone (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Cofactors GATA4, TBX5, and TBX20, which have been reported to bind NKX2-5 WT via the HD also induced nuclear translocation of NKX2-5\u2206HD (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In HL-1 cells, which express endogenous NKX2-5 and its cardiac cofactors, transfected NKX2-5\u2206HD was predominantly nuclear although some protein was present in the cytoplasm (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). These data demonstrate that NKX2-5 WT and its cofactors are able to carry NKX2-5\u2206HD into the nucleus via an unknown protein:protein interaction not involving the HD."

The C-terminal peptide could also interact with itself. The conserved tyrosine-rich domain (YRD), present within the C-terminal region (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), was essential for the interaction between full-length NKX2-5 and the C-terminus, being blocked by the NKX2-5YRD<sup>Y\u2212A</sup> mutation in which all 9 tyrosines of the YRD are mutated to alanine. We have previously shown that NKX2-5YRD<sup>Y\u2212A</sup> does not affect DNA binding, although it has a strong dominant-negative activity leading to lethal CHD-like phenotypes in high-level heterozygous ES cell chimaeras, and when placed over the null allele creates a phenocopy of NKX2-5 loss-of-function (<a href=\"#bib25\">Elliott et al., 2006</a>). Mutation of other conserved domains within the C-terminus (NK2-specific domain; Nkx2-5 box) had no affect on the interaction (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>). While the NKX2-5 HD is known to be a homophilic interaction domain (<a href=\"#bib24\">Elliott et al., 2010</a>), our Y2H data identify the YRD as a novel dimerisation interface within NKX2-5. This YRD-dependent interaction, demonstrated in both yeast and mammalian cells, provides the mechanism for heterodimerisation of NKX2-5 WT with NKX2-5\u2206HD, as well as homodimerisation of NKX2-5\u2206HD."

We focused on the enrichment of TF-binding sites in the C-set of NKX2-5\u2206HD, based on the hypothesis that DNA-binding cofactors of NKX2-5 guide NKX2-5\u2206HD to its off-targets. The motifs for E\u221226 transformation-specific (ETS) TFs occurred most frequently in NKX2-5\u2206HD C-set peaks (42%) and were significantly enriched compared to random peaks, suggesting that ETS factors could play a role in guiding NKX2-5\u2206HD to its off-targets. ETS factors are broadly expressed TFs that are activated by phosphorylation downstream of tyrosine kinase receptors. They are important for extracellular signal-gating in specification of cardiac progenitors in <i>Ciona</i> (<a href=\"#bib17\">Davidson et al., 2006</a>), eve-positive extra-cardiac progenitors in <i>Drosophila</i> (<a href=\"#bib30\">Halfon et al., 2000</a>), and for specification of vascular endothelial cells and <i>Gata4</i> expression in endocardial cushions in mammals (<a href=\"#bib67\">Schachterle et al., 2011</a>).

NKX2-5 WT also interacted with ETS-family members ELK3, ETS1, ERF, and GABP\u03b1 (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). psFRET confirmed the NKX2-5/ELK1 interaction in both the nucleus and cytoplasm in CV-1 cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E\u2013F</a>), demonstrating that the interaction was independent of ELK1 phosphorylation and chromatin binding. SRF is a well-described cofactor of both NKX2-5 and ELK1, albeit in different contexts (<a href=\"#bib74\">Treisman, 1994</a>). SRF is an effector of several signalling pathways and plays a specific role during early heart formation via its combinatorial action with NKX2-5 and GATA4 on target genes. To test whether the NKX2-5/ELK1 interaction was mediated by SRF, we utilised <i>R</i>luc-PCA. The ELK1 B-box mutation Y159A, which disrupts the interaction between ELK1 and SRF (<a href=\"#bib53\">Ling et al., 1998</a>), still interacted with NKX2-5 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>) and, as for ELK1 WT, could induce nuclear translocation of NKX2-5\u2206HD or retain NKX2-5 WT in cytoplasmic inclusions (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

Our results are consistent with previous data showing that a tyrosine-rich region within NK2 class homeo-protein NKX3-1 mediates interaction with prostate-derived ETS factor (<a href=\"#bib13\">Chen and Bieberich, 2005</a>).

B-sets included direct and indirect NKX2-5 WT target genes and were enriched in heart- and muscle-related GO terms. In the ES cell system, NKX2-5 mutant proteins retained WT-like functionality on some B-set genes. We propose that B-sets are recognised by mutants via dimerisation with cofactors or with NKX2-5 WT. The NKX2-5 HD is a recognised interface for NKX2-5 homo-dimerisation and interactions with cofactors, such as GATA4, HAND1, TBX5/20, and MEF2. NKX2-5\u2206HD lacks the HD and embedded nuclear localisation domain and represents a severe mutation that has lost the ability to bind to the majority (81%) of normal NKX2-5 WT targets (A-set). However, even this severe mutant retained binding to a subset of direct and indirect NKX2-5 WT targets (B-set). NKX2-5\u2206HD binding to B-set peaks could <i>only</i> occur through heterodimerisation with NKX2-5 WT or cofactors. We have shown using a number of approaches that NKX2-5\u2206HD retained its ability to interact with NKX2-5 WT, GATA4, and TBX5/20, and we identified the YRD located within the C-terminus of NKX2-5 as a novel interface that collaborates with the HD to support these interactions. Our characterisation of the YRD as a novel homophilic and heterophilic interaction domain provides the molecular mechanism that explains dimerisation of NKX2-5\u2206HD to NKX2-5 WT or its cofactors in the absence of the HD. We predict that the HD and YRD act supportively and synergistically in the assembly of macromolecular TF complexes. The YRD is an ancient domain that has coevolved with the NK2-class HD and is essential for NKX2-5 function in early mouse embryogenesis (<a href=\"#bib25\">Elliott et al., 2006</a>). In humans, half of NKX2-5 mutations associated with CHD are outside of the HD, and three frame-shift mutations located within the YRD have been identified (<a href=\"#bib3\">Benson et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Gutierrez-Roelens et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Ikeda et al., 2002</a>)."

NKX2-5\u2206HD off-targets were associated with GO terms <i>chromatin organisation</i> and <i>cell cycle</i>, and peaks were enriched in the binding sites for ETS family and many other broadly expressed TFs, attesting to an underlying logic in their selection. A high percentage of NKX2-5 mutant off-targets (14.2% for NKX2-5\u2206HD and 6.5% for NKX2-5Y191C) were occupied by ELK1/4 in HL-1 cells, compared to &lt;1% when randomly generated peaks were overlapped. Furthermore, only 3% of C-set peaks of the NKX2-5YRD<sup>Y\u2212A</sup> mutant were bound by ELK1/4.

Studies of the <i>Ciona intestinalis</i> cardiac GRN demonstrated that ETS family gene <i>Ets1/2</i> is activated by FGF/MAP Kinase signalling, which specifies the identity of founder cells of the cardiac lineage (<a href=\"#bib17\">Davidson et al., 2006</a>). Interestingly, most overrepresented in candidate Ets1/2 target genesis was the motif 5\u2032ATTA3\u2032, (<a href=\"#bib17\">Davidson et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib89\">Woznica et al., 2012</a>), which is similar to the HOX-like motif overrepresented in NKX2-5Y191C off-target peaks in HL-1 cells, potentially indicating a conserved FGF/MAP Kinase-activated synergy between ETS and HD factors at the earliest stages of cardiac lineage specification."

This interaction provides a mechanism for how severe NKX2-5 mutants lacking a functional HD can be directed to a sub-set of off-targets via interaction with broadly expressed TFs. Severe NKX2-5 mutants may be drawn to off-targets due to the breakdown of compelling cardiac specificity on true targets."

The cardiac GRN kernel is traditionally conceptualised as a set of cardiac-restricted TFs that are critical for defining organ territories and imposing organ specificity to GRN logic. However, the cardiac kernel is likely to have evolved in the context of a host of ancient TFs controlling ubiquitous cellular processes such as metabolism, cell cycle, chromatin dynamics, and cytoskeleton. Furthermore, it is well known that TFs are amongst the targets of the complex paracrine signalling pathways that underpin pattern formation, tissue specification, and differentiation in metazoans. Our genome-wide studies suggest that ELK1/4 interact with, regulate, and are regulated by, cardiac TFs, and are therefore recursively wired into the cardiac kernel at a high level. Other studies show that organ-restricted NK-2 class HD TFs collaborate with ETS factors on specific target genes (<a href=\"#bib13\">Chen and Bieberich, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Lin et al., 2006</a>) or provide signal gating for decisions affecting lineage fate within developmental fields (<a href=\"#bib30\">Halfon et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Hollenhorst et al., 2011</a>). ELK1/4 bind and potentially regulate a large number of genes in HL-1 cells involved in ubiquitous cellular processes, most prominently metabolism. However, smaller gene sets, most significantly those encoding heart developmental and cytoskeletal genes, were co-bound by NKX2-5 and ELKs, SRF and ELKs, or ELK1/4, NKX2-5, and SRF. One interpretation is that subsets of ELK1/4 targets, potentially those at critical hubs, have been drawn into the cardiac GRN to exert strategic (signal-gated) and fine network control over its outputs. Considering the implications of this and related studies more broadly, network links between cardiac and canonical signal-gated TFs are likely to be much greater than currently appreciated and generate massive potential for regulatory coding that needs to be tested in future studies."

                        "text": "Our results may have implications for the mechanism of CHD. While we acknowledge that our findings are derived from studies in a cell culture system, they compellingly suggest that NKX2-5 mutants, even those lacking DNA-binding ability, can bind to a subset of normal targets and off-targets, where they could affect transcription either positively or through dominant-negative action. Importantly, both NKX2-5\u2206HD and NKX2-5Y191C retained some functionality on select B- and C-set targets in vitro, an activity driven by heterodimerisation with cofactors. Our results confirm the inability of severe mutants to bind most normal targets, and therefore that haploinsufficiency is likely the dominant component of CHD mechanism. However, we predict that allele-specific dominant-negative and gain-of-function effects arising from dysregulation of the hundreds of off-targets will further destabilise the cardiac GRN and could contribute to disease. We have not yet analysed the expression of off-targets in mouse models or human CHD samples. Defining the targets and off-targets of a range of human CHD mutations and analysing their expressions in appropriate animal and human models will be needed to rigorously test the hypothesis."

RB_AW10.CEL was found to have elevated RLE (median away from 0) and an artifact identified by pseudoimage decomposition of the microarray. Log2 transformed microarray sample probe set intensities normalised via Robust Multichip Average and followed by complete linkage clustering (Pearson correlation) also identified RB_NS12.CEL as an outlier. RB_AW10.CEL and RB_NS12.CEL were removed from subsequent analyses. Probe remapping to NCBI Build 37 (mm9) was performed using the Starr R package (<a href=\"#bib91\">Zacher et al., 2010</a>). Inputs to Starr for remapping were the probe mappings for the Affymetrix Promoter 1.0R Array and all chromosomes from the NCBI Build 37 (mm9) in Fasta format downloaded from the UCSC ftp server. Array normalisation and peak identification were performed using the CisGenome software package version 2.0 (<a href=\"#bib40\">Ji et al., 2008</a>).

It leads to a shift in the conceptual framework, from the conventional view that mutations in NKX2-5 result in a failure of the transcription factor to correctly activate its downstream targets to the idea that the mutant factor participates in promiscuous interactions that lead to inappropriate activation of genes that are not normally NKX2-5 targets. This is a very data rich study that represents a technical tour de force. The results are complex and the manuscript densely written. In order to make it more accessible, some simplifications and clarifications are required in the text. Further experimentation is not required. However the authors should strengthen the validation of their results by more comparative analyses of data and tone down some of their conclusions.

The point is that these ancient TFs are broadly or ubiquitously expressed and are not wholly dedicated to the cardiac-specific functions. However, they have been co-opted to regulate certain cardiac genes. It is our hypothesis that ubiquitous factors of this sort provide vital signalling inputs into the cardiac network.
