Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), generated from the patient\u2019s keratinocytes, were differentiated into multi-layer eyecup-like structures with features of human retinal precursor cells. The inner layer of the eyecups contained photoreceptor precursor cells that expressed photoreceptor markers and exhibited axonemes and basal bodies characteristic of outer segments. Analysis of the <i>USH2A</i> transcripts of these cells revealed that one of the patient\u2019s mutations causes exonification of intron 40, a translation frameshift and a premature stop codon. Western blotting revealed upregulation of GRP78 and GRP94, suggesting that the patient\u2019s other USH2A variant (Arg4192His) causes disease through protein misfolding and ER stress. Transplantation into 4-day-old immunodeficient <i>Crb1</i><sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> mice resulted in the formation of morphologically and immunohistochemically recognizable photoreceptor cells, suggesting that the mutations in this patient act via post-developmental photoreceptor degeneration."

Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), generated from the patient\u2019s keratinocytes, were differentiated into multi-layer eyecup-like structures with features of human retinal precursor cells. The inner layer of the eyecups contained photoreceptor precursor cells that expressed photoreceptor markers and exhibited axonemes and basal bodies characteristic of outer segments. Analysis of the <i>USH2A</i> transcripts of these cells revealed that one of the patient\u2019s mutations causes exonification of intron 40, a translation frameshift and a premature stop codon. Western blotting revealed upregulation of GRP78 and GRP94, suggesting that the patient\u2019s other USH2A variant (Arg4192His) causes disease through protein misfolding and ER stress. Transplantation into 4-day-old immunodeficient <i>Crb1</i><sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> mice resulted in the formation of morphologically and immunohistochemically recognizable photoreceptor cells, suggesting that the mutations in this patient act via post-developmental photoreceptor degeneration."

Usher syndrome is caused by mutations in any of more than ten genes, but the most commonly affected is <i>USH2A</i>, which encodes a protein called usherin.

First, they support the idea that stem cell-derived retinal photoreceptor cells, generated from patients with unknown mutations, can be used to identify disease-causing genes and to interrogate disease pathophysiology. This will allow for a more rapid development of gene therapy strategies. Second, they demonstrate that <i>USH2A</i> mutations cause retinitis pigmentosa by affecting photoreceptors later in life rather than by altering their development. This suggests that it should, via early intervention, be possible to treat retinitis pigmentosa in adult patients with this form of the disease. Third, the technique could be used to generate animal models in which to study the effects of specific disease-causing mutations on cellular development and function. Finally, this study suggests that skin cells from adults with retinitis pigmentosa could be used to generate immunologically matched photoreceptor cells that can be transplanted back into the same patients to restore their sight. Many questions remain to be answered before this technique can be moved into clinical trials but, in the meantime, it will provide a new tool for research into this major cause of blindness."

The combination of hearing loss and retinitis pigmentosa in Usher syndrome creates an unusual opportunity for the development of effective gene replacement therapy. Unlike many other forms of retinitis pigmentosa in which a large fraction of the photoreceptors have already been lost by the time a diagnosis is made, newborn hearing tests coupled with increasingly sensitive molecular testing have the potential to identify patients affected with Usher syndrome early enough that the majority of their photoreceptors are still amenable to gene replacement therapy."

Large genes also frequently harbor a number of rare variants of uncertain pathogenicity in the population, and these can make it difficult to establish a molecular diagnosis with sufficient certainty to undertake a therapy as invasive as subretinal injection of therapeutic viruses. Another obstacle to treatment is the relative paucity of information about the normal function of the protein encoded by <i>USH2A</i> (usherin) and the degree to which it can be overexpressed in human cells without causing harm."

As clearly demonstrated in a variety of recent publications, early passage iPSCs tend to retain an epigenetic profile that is characteristic of their somatic tissue of origin (<a href=\"#bib35\">Marchetto et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Kim et al., 2011</a>). An excellent example of how epigenetic memory can influence retinal differentiation is the recent study by Clegg et al. (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hu et al., 2010</a>), who showed that iPSCs generated from retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) would preferentially re-differentiate into mature RPE. Although viable retinal tissue suitable for iPSC generation would be difficult to obtain for the purpose of patient-specific disease modeling and therapy, accessible somatic cells from the same germ lineage as the neural retina are readily available in the form of keratinocytes."

We and others have shown that following transplantation, iPSC-derived photoreceptor precursor cells give rise to rod and cone photoreceptor precursors, which integrate within the dystrophic retina, form synapses with host bipolar cells, and induce a partial restoration of electrophysiological and anatomical correlates of retinal function (<a href=\"#bib24\">Lamba et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Tucker et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Homma et al., 2013</a>). Isolation of specific cell types from two-dimensional iPSC-derived eyecups followed by transplantation into animal eyes provides a means for exploring human retinal pathophysiology in unprecedented detail, as well as a means for efficiently evaluating gene-based and cell-based therapies."

In addition, we were able to show that the patient\u2019s iPSC-derived rod photoreceptor precursor cells could integrate within the immune suppressed developing mouse retina and give rise to morphologically and immunohistochemically recognizable photoreceptor cells. These findings suggest that the <i>USH2A</i> mutations in this patient act via post-developmental photoreceptor degeneration rather than an early developmental abnormality."

This experiment yielded 71 million uniquely mapped paired-end sequences, each end 50 bp in length. These sequences were aligned to the reference human genomic sequence (hg19) using BWA (<a href=\"#bib26\">Li and Durbin, 2009</a>) and BFAST (<a href=\"#bib15\">Homer et al., 2009</a>). Departures from the reference were identified with GATK (<a href=\"#bib9\">DePristo et al., 2011</a>). More than 20,000 sequence variations were detected (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1B</a>). These variants were prioritized using the following criteria: GATK variation quality score greater than 50, presence in coding sequence or within 5 bp of a splice junction, annotated frequency of less than 2% in all available population databases, presence in two or fewer exome sequences from other individuals analyzed by our laboratory, predicted to alter protein structure, and lack of complete genotype sharing with the proband\u2019s unaffected sibling (as determined by genomewide SNP genotyping) (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1B</a>). After applying these filters to the data, more than 400 plausible disease-causing sequence variations, in more than 300 genes, remained for further consideration. There were no instances of two plausible disease-causing variants in a gene previously associated with RP, but two human retinal degeneration genes (<i>ABCA4</i> and <i>USH2A</i>) each harbored a single plausible disease-causing variant (Thr1428Met ACG&gt;ATG and Arg4192His CGC&gt;CAC, respectively). Sanger sequencing of the entire coding sequence of both of these genes confirmed the presence of the heterozygous variants identified by exome sequencing but failed to detect a second disease-causing variation in either gene. We then began evaluating genes that had not been previously associated with human retinal disease that contained two protein-altering variants in the proband. As we were screening additional RP patients and controls for these variants, two things occurred that re-directed our attention to <i>USH2A</i>. First, we discovered a second RP patient with the Arg4192His variant in <i>USH2A</i>, and this individual had a second well-established disease-causing mutation on the opposite <i>USH2A</i> allele. More importantly, <a href=\"#bib62\">Vach\u00e9 et al. (2012)</a> published their discovery of a disease-causing variant in intron 40 of <i>USH2A</i>. Sanger sequencing of intron 40 in our patient revealed this intronic variant to be present in <i>trans</i> to his Arg4192His mutation."

                        "text": "To derive retinal neurons from these iPSCs for pathophysiologic studies and the development of patient-specific therapy, a slightly modified version of our previously published stepwise differentiation protocol was used (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib59\">Tucker et al., 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib61\">2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib58\">2013</a>). This protocol is designed to maximize the percentage of retinal cells produced by taking into account: (1) the role of bone morphogenic protein (BMP) and Wnt signaling pathway inhibition in neuroectodermal development (noggin and DKK1, respectively) (<a href=\"#bib23\">Lamb et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Mukhopadhyay et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Anderson et al., 2002</a>); (2) the role of IGF-1 in anterior neural/eye field development (<a href=\"#bib49\">Pera et al., 2001</a>); and (3) Notch pathway inhibition (DAPT\u2014gamma secretase inhibitor) in photoreceptor cell development (<a href=\"#bib18\">Jadhav et al., 2006</a>). Although retinal differentiation in mouse can be accomplished in 30 days (<a href=\"#bib59\">Tucker et al., 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib58\">2013</a>), retinal differentiation of human cells takes significantly longer. During differentiation, these keratinocyte-derived iPSCs formed eyecup-like structures with clearly defined layers of pigmented RPE and non-pigmented neural retina (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B\u2013E</a>). This was a clear departure from our previous experience with fibroblast-derived iPSCs, which never develop eyecup-like structures under very similar culture conditions. The eyecups began as small pigmented foci that could be detected as early as 45 days post-differentiation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Following passage and continued differentiation, these pigmented clumps expanded and elongated over 150 days (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>) and were eventually joined by a clump of neural rosettes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, arrow) on one side of the pigmented structure. In some cases, these RPE/neural units extended into C-shaped eyecup-like structures (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D,E</a>) while in others, the central cavity did not form and the structure consisted of a circular sheet of neural cells surrounded by a pigmented epithelium (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In many cases, multiple eyecups at different developmental stages were present within the same well of a differentiating six-well plate (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>, arrows). The reason that these eyecup-like structures develop in a planar fashion instead of the spheres reported by both Meyer et al. and Eiraku et al. is that we grow these cells under adherent conditions in tissue culture dishes coated with collagen, laminin, and fibronectin, while spheres are grown in suspension (<a href=\"#bib38\">Meyer et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Eiraku and Sasai, 2012</a>). Although there will undoubtedly be advantages of both approaches in different situations, two advantages of this planar system is that the neural cells in the center of the eyecup do not necrose for lack of oxygen, and the firm attachment to the underlying substrate allows homogeneous biopsies to be taken from the eyecups for subculture and analysis."

The ability to transplant such cells into animals with retinal degeneration will also be valuable as part of the vision scientist\u2019s armamentarium for exploring the pathophysiologic mechanism of specific mutations that are identified in patients. To test whether patient-specific photoreceptor precursor cells isolated from the neural retina layer of human iPSC-derived eyecups could give rise to new photoreceptor cells in animals for the latter purpose, a series of transplantation experiments were performed. It has been previously shown that the optimal cell type for retinal transplantation is the post-mitotic photoreceptor precursor cell (<a href=\"#bib32\">MacLaren et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Pearson et al., 2012</a>). Prior to transplantation, 150-day neural rosettes were dissected free from their surrounding tissues and plated onto fresh tissue culture plates to determine whether these cells would maintain a photoreceptor cell identity following dissociation. To test this, cell cultures were infected 3 days after plating with a lentiviral vector driving expression of GFP under control of the rhodopsin kinase promoter. 2 weeks after plating, post-mitotic rhodopsin kinase positive photoreceptor precursor cells were abundant (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,B</a>). In many instances, clusters of the rhodopsin kinase positive cells realigned in a polarized photoreceptor cell fashion and extended axon-like projections (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>, arrowhead) and outer-segment-like processes (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>, arrow).

These cells will allow scientists to explore the pathophysiology of human diseases in ways that were previously possible only in animal models. They will also be useful for evaluating potential therapies ranging from high-throughput screens of small molecule drugs to the comparison of gene replacement constructs containing different promoters or packaged in different vectors. For rare autosomal recessive disorders such as <i>USH2A</i>-associated RP, there is often little statistical evidence for the pathogenicity of one or both of a patient\u2019s putative disease-causing mutations. In such cases, iPSC-derived retinal cells may be useful for confirming the pathogenicity of an unusual genotype before embarking upon an invasive therapy like subretinal administration of viral-mediated gene therapy."

Exome sequencing of this individual revealed more than 400 plausible disease-causing sequence variations in more than 300 genes. Two of these were present in genes known to cause autosomal recessive RP (an Arg4192His variant in <i>USH2A</i> and a Thr1428Met in <i>ABCA4</i>), but a second disease-causing allele could not be found in either of these genes despite Sanger sequencing of the entire coding sequence. We were fortunate that Vach\u00e9 et al. identified and reported the <i>USH2A</i> variant in IVS 40 that proved to be our patient\u2019s second disease-causing allele. Non-exomic mutations are not an uncommon cause of recessive diseases. In some instances (e.g., <i>CEP290</i>-associated LCA) they account for the largest proportion of disease-causing alleles (<a href=\"#bib54\">Stone, 2007</a>). As the iPSC technology becomes more routine, the evaluation of RNA from iPSC-derived retina may become a common step in the analysis of exome sequencing data when two clearly disease-causing alleles cannot be identified in known disease genes. To confirm the pathogenicity of the <i>USH2A</i> variants we observed in our patient, <i>USH2A</i> transcripts were analyzed using RNA isolated from iPSC-derived photoreceptor precursor cells obtained from the proband, an unaffected control and human donor retina. The suspected splice site mutation within IVS40 was shown to cause exonification of the intron, a translation frameshift and a premature stop codon. The transcription of the patient\u2019s <i>USH2A</i> missense mutation was confirmed in a similar fashion. In combination, these mutations resulted in an upregulation of the markers GRP78 and GRP94 indicative of protein misfolding and subsequent ER stress."

This finding is compatible with our patient\u2019s history of normal vision until the third decade of life; that is, his <i>USH2A</i> mutations do not appear to cause a gross developmental abnormality of photoreceptor cells. It is also noteworthy that transplantable photoreceptor precursor cells could be generated from the skin of a patient in the seventh decade of life. The transplantation of photoreceptor precursor cells derived from early postnatal retina or embryonic stem cells has been accomplished before by other groups (<a href=\"#bib32\">MacLaren et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">La Torre et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Pearson et al., 2012</a>), but to our knowledge, this is the first time that photoreceptor precursor cells have been derived from an adult human RP patient and successfully transplanted into mice. However, much work remains to be done before such transplants could be considered evidence for the feasibility of sight-restoring iPSC-derived treatments in humans. For example, synaptic connectivity will need to be demonstrated ultrastructurally and electrophysiologically, and useful vision in treated animals will need to be demonstrated with an array of psychophysical approaches. Longevity of the transplanted cells will be important to demonstrate as will the cells\u2019 lack of tumorigenicity. For such transplants to have practical clinical utility it will also be important to show that the transplanted cells can integrate and function in the retinas of animals with advanced stages of many different molecular types of retinal degeneration."

The coding sequence of <i>USH2A</i> is &gt;18 kb, and the packaging limits of AAV and EIAV vectors are about 3 kb and 10 kb, respectively. For genes such as <i>USH2A</i>, vectors with large carrying capacities such as HSV1, which can accommodate inserts of up to 40 kb in size (<a href=\"#bib57\">Thomas et al., 2003</a>), may be useful. In addition to the vector limitations, the proper stoichiometry of the delivered message will also be critical for some genes. It is possible that patients like the one reported here, with a truncated protein encoded by one allele and a misfolded protein encoded by the other, may require a different promoter and multiplicity of infection than a different patient who harbors two stop mutations in <i>USH2A</i>. Patient-specific iPSC-derived retinal cells may be useful in choosing the optimal gene therapy strategy for each individual."

In some cases, correcting the genetic defect responsible for the photoreceptor degeneration will be necessary before transplanting photoreceptor cells into the patient. The development of site specific TALEN- or CRISPR-based genome editing approaches, which allow for the targeted correction of patient-specific cells in vitro, is proving to have great utility for endogenous gene correction (<a href=\"#bib14\">Hockemeyer et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Ding et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Wang et al., 2013</a>). For instance, Hockemeyer et al. recently demonstrated that for the five genomic sites targeted, pluripotent iPSC clones carrying transgenes solely at TALEN-specified loci could be obtained (<a href=\"#bib14\">Hockemeyer et al., 2011</a>). Similarly using the CRISPR/CAS-9 system, Wang et al. recently demonstrated the ability to simultaneously manipulate five separate genetic loci in mouse ES cells (<a href=\"#bib63\">Wang et al., 2013</a>). A major advantage of these approaches is that unlike exogenous gene addition in which promoter strength and multiplicity of infection may require patient-specific adjustment, TALEN- and CRISPR-mediated correction have the advantage that the gene remains under the control of the endogenous promoter. For recessive diseases such as <i>USH2A</i>-associated RP, correction of a single disease-causing allele should be sufficient for a therapeutic effect. One could test this directly by transplanting corrected cells into retinal degenerative mice and determining whether cells with both alleles corrected behave differently than those with one or neither allele corrected."

This approach is currently in clinical trial for the treatment of Stargardt macular dystrophy and age-related macular degeneration (AMD) (<a href=\"#bib52\">Schwartz et al., 2012</a>). In these studies, ES cell-derived retinal-pigmented epithelial cells are delivered to immune suppressed patients as subretinal bolus cell injections (<a href=\"#bib52\">Schwartz et al., 2012</a>). However, there are considerable disadvantages to using allogeneic cells. Retinas injured by inherited disease often have a loss of integrity of the blood retinal barrier, which would allow the patient\u2019s peripheral immune system access to the transplanted cells. This type of transplant approach would likely require life-long immunomodulation, (<a href=\"#bib12\">Hambright et al., 2012</a>) putting patients at further risk."

Finally, we showed that these patient-derived retinal precursor cells have the ability to integrate into the developing mouse retina and to form morphologically and immunohistochemically recognizable photoreceptor cells.

In the Abstract and Discussion, the authors refer to the transplanted photoreceptors as \u201cmorphologically normal rod photoreceptors\u201d, but absent a more detailed characterization that is over-stating the data. We also note that a complete analysis would include functional assays, such as single cell recording of the light response.

However, the primary goal of the current study was to demonstrate that photoreceptor precursor cells could be generated from the skin of a patient in the seventh decade of life affected with a rare inherited retinal disease (retinitis pigmentosa), and that these cells could be used to demonstrate the pathogenicity of a recently described non-exomic mutation in a large retina-specific gene (<i>USH2A</i>). Given this, we have decided to remove the words \u201cand treatment\u201d from the title, because we now realize that these words would suggest to some readers that the types of transplantation detail asked for by the reviewers would be found in this paper."
