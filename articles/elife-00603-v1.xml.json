Here, we used a phylogenetic framework to measure mRNA profiles in 15 yeast species from the phylum <i>Ascomycota</i> and reconstruct the evolution of their modular regulatory programs along a time course of growth on glucose over 300 million years. We found that modules have diverged proportionally to phylogenetic distance, with prominent changes in gene regulation accompanying changes in lifestyle and ploidy, especially in carbon metabolism. Paralogs have significantly contributed to regulatory divergence, typically within a very short window from their duplication. Paralogs from a whole genome duplication (WGD) event have a uniquely substantial contribution that extends over a longer span. Similar patterns occur when considering the evolution of the heat shock regulatory program measured in eight of the species, suggesting that these are general evolutionary principles."

Here, we used a phylogenetic framework to measure mRNA profiles in 15 yeast species from the phylum <i>Ascomycota</i> and reconstruct the evolution of their modular regulatory programs along a time course of growth on glucose over 300 million years. We found that modules have diverged proportionally to phylogenetic distance, with prominent changes in gene regulation accompanying changes in lifestyle and ploidy, especially in carbon metabolism. Paralogs have significantly contributed to regulatory divergence, typically within a very short window from their duplication. Paralogs from a whole genome duplication (WGD) event have a uniquely substantial contribution that extends over a longer span. Similar patterns occur when considering the evolution of the heat shock regulatory program measured in eight of the species, suggesting that these are general evolutionary principles."

In the 1970s Mary-Claire King and Allan Wilson proposed that a process called gene regulation\u2014which determines when, where and how genes are expressed as proteins\u2014is responsible for this diversity. Four decades later, the central role of gene regulation in evolution has been confirmed in a wide range of species including bacteria, fungi, flies and mammals, although the details remain poorly understood. In recent years it has been suggested that the duplication of genes\u2014and sometimes the duplication of whole genomes\u2014has had a crucial influence on the part played by gene regulation in the evolution of many different species."

Moreover, their genomes are relatively small, which simplifies the task of working out how it has changed over the course of evolution. It is also known that species in this branch of the tree of life diverged before and after an event in which a whole genome was duplicated."

Normal cells, on the other hand, use glucose primarily for energy and tend not to divide rapidly."

Importantly, evolutionary changes in regulators, facilitated by protein modularity, in cooperative binding with other factors and shifts in protein\u2013DNA interactions contribute toward different paths through a \u2018hybrid\u2019 regulatory state for the ancestral regulatory network to be resolved in to generate the diversity of regulatory network structures observed in modern species (<a href=\"#bib2\">Baker et al., 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib1\">2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Tuch et al., 2008a</a>)"

An important challenge is to collect experimental data in such a way that would minimize irrelevant differences, for example, due to growth conditions, and allow focusing on true evolutionary distinctions. Expanding the experimental scope to cover a broader phylogenetic range and density can help study the divergence of expression in individual genes and gene modules in order to answer questions on the extent of conservation of transcriptional programs, its relation to phylogenetic distance, the emergence of new regulatory patterns across modules of co-regulated genes, and the specific contribution of gene duplication and divergence\u2014through both sporadic and whole genome duplication\u2014to regulatory evolution."

While the module\u2019s expression patterns are conserved across species, their gene membership diverges, proportionally to phylogenetic distance. Gene duplication events significantly contribute to regulatory divergence, in particular close to their phylogenetic point of duplication. This contribution is more pronounced and more prolonged for WGD paralogs. These patterns also characterize the evolution of the transcriptional response to heat shock, supporting their generality (<a href=\"#bib44\">Roy et al., 2013</a>). Our framework for comparative functional genomics is applicable to any complex phylogeny, and can help test these principles of regulatory evolution in other responses and species."

In principle, the lower conservation of the lag phase profiles in these and other species could have been merely due to the fact that this is the only phase sampled at the same absolute time (30 min). However, the repletion process is known to be fast (<a href=\"#bib71\">Zaman et al., 2008</a>), metabolite profiling in each species at this time point shows the least difference between species (MS, DAT and AR, unpublished results), and additional profiling in some of the most divergent species at finer increments did not change this finding (data not shown), ruling out this possibility. Nevertheless, some functional groups of genes do exhibit conserved induction or repression in the lag phase across most species (e.g., growth genes such as mRNA splicing genes are enriched among the highly induced genes [p&lt;10<sup>\u22125</sup>, FDR, \u2018Materials and methods\u2019] possibly to support splicing of transcripts encoding ribosomal proteins)."

Arboretum uses a generative probabilistic model of the evolution of module membership of a given gene, starting from the last common ancestor (LCA) of a set of species and probabilistically propagating this membership down the branches of the phylogenetic tree to the leaf nodes. Arboretum uses the phylogeny to link the module IDs at each phylogenetic point to the modules of the LCA, and uses the structures of gene trees (as defined from genome sequences; <a href=\"#bib62\">Wapinski et al., 2007a</a>) during module identification. This allows Arboretum to simultaneously infer ancestral and extant module assignments, and to systematically handle complex orthology and paralogy relationships that arise from gene duplication and loss. Arboretum allows genes to change their module assignment during evolution, but at any ancestral or extant species, every gene (if present in that species) must be assigned to exactly one module for a particular response."

It is associated with the shifting of binding sites for key activators of amino acid and purine biosynthesis genes (e.g., Bas1, Met32, Gzf3, Gln3, Met28, Met4, and Gat1) from nucleosome-free to nucleosome-occluded positions (<a href=\"#bib56\">Tsankov et al., 2010</a>) in rich media post-WGD (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). Conversely, the phylogenetic pattern of Sfp1 motif enrichment is less conclusive in these genes (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>)."

Mitochondrial genes link respiration to purine metabolism. Glycolysis is linked to purine salvage by the metabolic intermediate 3-P-glycerate. De novo purine metabolism is linked to the pentose shunt through ribulose-5-phosphate. The genes in red are induced post-shift in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> and other post-WGD species, but their orthologs are repressed in pre-WGD species. Both <i>Schizosaccharomyces</i> species have three copies of <i>ZWF1</i> (purple) that are strongly induced. (<b>B</b>) Shown are the major carbon pathways involved in the fermentation or respiration of glucose and their interconnectivity. Both WGD and other duplicate genes in each pathway are indicated. The genes in red are induced post-shift in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> and most of the other post-WGD species while those in green are repressed similar to their pre-duplication orthologs. Differences in <i>trans</i> regulators may further contribute to the reassignment of their targets between modules. While many of the regulators of glucose repression in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> are present across the phylogeny (<a href=\"#bib13\">Flores et al., 2000</a>), the regulation of some has changed at the WGD and at the ancestor of the <i>Schizosaccharomyces</i>, consistent with the reassignment of their targets. For example, the glucose repressing <i>MIG</i> genes and the <i>TUP1-CYC8</i> complex are strongly repressed following glucose depletion in most post-WGD species, whereas some respiration activators are strongly induced (<i>CAT8</i> and <i>HAP2,4,5</i> and <i>SIP2</i> post-WGD, <i>HAP2</i>, <i>MOT3</i>, and <i>SIP2</i> in <i>S. pombe</i>, data not shown). We observed no such changes in the expression of known regulators of amino acid and purine metabolism (data not shown). In some cases, duplication of key regulators followed by reassignment to a new module may have further contributed to new regulatory functions. For example, <i>TPK1</i> and <i>TPK3</i> are two WGD-derived paralogs encoding catalytic subunits of PKA, a major regulator of carbohydrate metabolism and stress responses (<a href=\"#bib71\">Zaman et al., 2008</a>). <i>TPK1</i> in strongly induced in the <i>sensu stricto</i> species, as is the single <i>TPK</i> gene in the <i>Schizosaccharomyces. TPK3</i> is repressed in those species, conserving the expression pattern of its ortholog in all the respiratory pre-duplication species (data not shown)."

During the learning process, Arboretum uses a soft probabilistic assignment of module membership allowing a gene to contribute to the mean expression profile of different modules. At the end of the learning, the gene is assigned to the single module with the highest probability. In the majority of cases, this \u2018hard assignment\u2019 is well supported in our dataset, such that the probability that a gene belongs to its assigned module is much higher than its probability to belong to the next-best module (<a href=\"#fig13\">Figure 13A,B</a>) In some cases, however, a \u2018soft\u2019 probabilistic assignment may be preferable, to reflect the pleiotropic action of genes.

We chose a relatively small number (k = 5) as a conservative choice, which may under-estimate divergence relative to conservation, since genes with minor differences in expression between species would still likely belong to the same module. This choice increases our confidence in those divergence events that are highlighted, but may miss other divergence events. Several lines of evidence support the validity of our choice including the correspondence between the overall trends based on the direct expression levels (e.g., <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B\u2013F</a>) and those based on inferred modules (e.g., <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>), the substantial proportion of variance (65\u201370%) explained by 5 modules (<a href=\"#fig14\">Figure 14</a>), and the lack of additional clear temporal patterns or distinct functional enrichments at higher <i>k\u2019</i>s (<a href=\"#fig14s1\">Figure 14\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Our companion manuscript (<a href=\"#bib44\">Roy et al., 2013</a>) provides user guidelines for choosing <i>k</i>. Notably, Arboretum does not model dependencies between different time points, modeled each time point with a separate mean and variance. It is possible that by explicitly modeling temporal dependencies we can capture finer-grained dynamic differences. This is a direction of future research."

In particular, the module assignments at the point of duplication are two independent draws of module membership, one each for copy, ensuring that the orthogroup has the same module assignment before the duplication and allowing it the freedom to change assignment after duplication. We used these features to characterize the role of gene duplication in the evolution of gene regulation, substantially expanding on previous analyses based on comparing paralog expression in on one or two species. We found that paralogs significantly contribute to divergence, mostly during a short window of opportunity after duplication, with a more prolonged contribution from WGD paralogs. This may be explained by the fact that segmental duplication rarely preserves the entire regulatory region resulting in immediate expression divergence (<a href=\"#bib34\">Lynch and Katju, 2004</a>) whereas duplicates from WGD events preserve the regulatory inputs and thus may take longer to diverge."

There are well-known similarities in glycolysis and respiration between the two states that enable both cancer and yeast cells to direct glucose to biosynthesis, supporting their rapid growth and proliferation. However, both the causes of this metabolic signature and its connection to biosynthesis are not fully understood. The observation that genes encoding enzymes in the nucleotide salvage and glycine biosynthesis pathways are strongly induced post-diauxic shift in respiro-fermentative post-WGD species is analogous to recently identified changes in these pathways in cancer cells that display the Warburg Effect (<a href=\"#bib14\">Gaglio et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Jain et al., 2012</a>), suggests that rewiring of nucleotide biosynthetic pathways contributes to this phenotype and points to fundamental metabolic principles that are independent of evolutionary descent."

Even in our new medium, there is still substantial variation in growth between species, likely indicating real physiological differences (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Thus, a second challenge was to identify physiologically-comparable time points across species critical for distinguishing true inter-specific variation from temporal shifts due to growth rate differences. We therefore determined in real-time the growth rate, glucose, and ethanol levels for each species (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), and chose physiologically comparable (but potentially physically different) time points for each species for isolating RNA from lag, mid-log, late log, \u2018diauxic shift\u2019 (the point at which glucose is depleted), post-shift, and plateau. The Lag phase time point was taken 30 min after inoculation for all species. Log phase was defined as the mid-point of exponential growth. Diauxic Shift is the point at which glucose levels reached 0. To choose the remaining time points, we chose two time points before the diauxic shift (Early Late Log and Late Log) and two time points after the diauxic shift (Post Shift and Late Post Shift) for each species at times proportional to the maximum growth rate in exponential phase in each species. Finally, the Plateau time point was defined as approximately 2 hr after growth had plateaued. A pilot expression study was performed using the same species-specific microarrays in which expression profiles were measured for each of the eight time points (described above) for one biological replicate for each species. These data were then used to determine the final six time points used in the larger study (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

The OD<sub>600</sub> was measured every 15\u201360 min using a Thermo Spectronic Genesys 20 spectrophotometer, and media samples were taken to measure glucose and ethanol levels on a YSI Biochemistry Analyzer Model 2700. These data were used to determine when each species was at a particular phase of growth to choose comparable physiological time points. The Lag phase time point was taken 30 min after inoculation for all species. Log phase was defined as the mid-point of exponential growth. Diauxic Shift is the point at which glucose levels reached 0. Two time points before the diauxic shift, Early Late Log, Late Log, and two time points after, Post Shift, Late Post Shift, were chosen for each species at a times proportional to the maximum growth rate in exponential phase in each species. Finally, the Plateau time point was defined as approximately 2 hr after the growth had plateaued). A pilot expression study was performed using the species-specific microarrays (described below) in which expression profiles were measured for each of the eight time points (described above) for one biological replicate for each species. These data were used to finalize the six time points used in the larger study (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

To this end, we used two methods to align the measured growth curves. In the first method, samples from different experiments in the same species were manually aligned by overlaying growth curves for each experiment. Samples were then categorized into time point classes (LAG, LL, DS, PS, PLAT) by their position on the growth curve and their expression profiles. In the second method, we applied two transformations to align growth curves. First, in each species sampling times for growth curves of biological replicates were shifted in order to align the exponential growth phase. As expected, the doubling time for each replicate was consistent. Next, a line was fitted to the exponential growth phase using all replicate data in order to get an average growth curve. This average growth curve for each species was then aligned to the <i>S</i>. <i>cerevisiae</i> growth curve, adjusting for the doubling time (slope) and speed (shift along x axis) during exponential growth. Finally, we plotted dextrose depletion and used it to manually align the DS time such that it matches <i>S</i>. <i>cerevisiae</i>. Sampling times were then extracted from the aligned growth curve. With few exceptions, the two approaches matched and were consistent with the original sampling choice."

Arboretum is based on a generative probabilistic model of module evolution via transition matrices (e.g., <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>), and models expression generation at extant species via Gaussian mixture models, with a mean and variance for each time point of measurement in each species. Arboretum takes as input the genome-wide transcriptional profiles for all species measured, as well as a species tree, and all gene trees (as defined from genome sequences (<a href=\"#bib62\">Wapinski et al., 2007a</a>, <a href=\"#bib63\">2007b</a>). As output it provides module membership of genes in all extant and ancestral species, mean and variance of gene expression in each module in each extant species, and transition matrices at each species (extant or ancestral, except the LCA) that specify the probability of genes in each module to preserve or change their module membership in that species compared to their assignment in its immediate ancestor. During the module identification procedure, Arboretum uses the gene tree structure to trace the evolution of gene membership from ancestral modules to extant ones. If a gene changes it\u2019s module membership compared to its immediate ancestor, the ancestral module is considered to have contracted, while simultaneously the new module of the gene is considered to have expanded. Explicitly incorporating the gene trees enables Arboretum to handle complex orthology and paralogy relationships that arise from gene duplications and losses. The model parameters are learned using an Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm, which on convergence provides maximum likelihood estimates of the transition matrices, module mean and variance and module assignments in both extant and ancestral species."

For these reasons, we ran Arboretum with five different random initializations, where each run was seeded with an initial clustering with merged expression data across all species. We selected a particular random initialization for our final results based on manual inspection of the transition matrices, and did not have any arbitrary module permutations. Results for different random initializations were very comparable in terms of the module expression patterns and the transition matrices. In particular, the average F-score similarity of modules between any pair of random initializations ranged from 78% to 99% for the extant species, and from 88% to 96% for ancestral species for the non-duplication case. Similarly, for the case when we included duplications, the average F-score similarity of modules between any pair of random initializations ranged from 76% to 99% for the extant species, and ranged from 77% to 98% for ancestral species. A more detailed analysis of Arboretum\u2019s stability and sensitivity is described in (<a href=\"#bib44\">Roy et al., 2013</a>).

Using this process the number of modules asymptotes at <i>k = 9.</i> We next inspected the patterns associated with each module, which entailed plotting the mean expression profile of each module and selecting <i>k</i> to reflect the most distinct temporal patterns. Using this process we determined that <i>k = 5</i> gave us the most meaningful and distinct set of profiles in terms of the GO processes enriched in different modules and the patterns associated with each module.

To assess if any of these classes were specifically associated with a particular expression module, we used a Hyper-geometric distribution that tests the probability that <i>k</i> or more genes from module <i>i</i>, have fate <i>f</i>, given that there are <i>x</i> genes in module <i>i</i>, <i>t</i> genes in all that are associated with fate <i>f</i>, and there are a total of <i>T</i> genes that can have any of the fates at the pre-duplication ancestral nodes. We performed this test at the pre-duplication ancestor and the post-duplication child node separately, as the total number of genes are different at these phylogenetic points."

Similarly, we calculated enrichment of instances outside the NFR by comparing the number of genes in our query set with instances that were outside the NFR to the total number of genes that had instances outside the NFR.

In early studies with a higher number of modules, we do see separation of genes, which we know to be co-regulated by a shared mechanism (e.g., in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>), into separate modules. We therefore opted for a more conservative approach, with fewer parameters (modules) and possibly under-estimating divergence.

First, the choice of a large number of genes in principle <i>reduces</i> the chance of splitting genes with similar expression to distinct bins, as noted above. Furthermore, Arboretum <i>does</i> provide a quantitative model of expression at the leaves (extant species) with two parameters (mean and variance of a Gaussian). Arboretum does not provide, however, a model of expression evolution (only of co-expression evolution, by evolving module assignment). Defining models of expression evolution is an important (and challenging) future goal. We point this out in the revised Discussion. Finally, we examined the expression levels of the 45 genes pointed out by the reviewers (<a href=\"#fig17\">Author response image 3</a>). We find that the mean induction for these genes is indeed lower in <i>S. mikatae</i> than in <i>S. bayanus,</i> consistent with the distinct module assignment by Arboretum, although visually these changes are hard to see in the heat map in our paper with a saturation level of \u22122 and +2 (but are discernible by eye when viewed at a larger range of log ratio-3 and 3; <a href=\"#fig17\">Author response image 3</a>). Most (32/45) of the genes are significantly lower in <i>S. mikatae</i> based on a paired one-sided t-test (p&lt;0.1)."
