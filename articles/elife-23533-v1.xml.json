Here, we identified a small molecule that inhibits human pre-mRNA splicing at an intermediate stage during conversion of pre-catalytic spliceosomal B complexes into activated B<sup>act</sup> complexes. Characterization of the stalled complexes (designated B<sup>028</sup>) revealed that U4/U6 snRNP proteins are released during activation before the U6 Lsm and B-specific proteins, and before recruitment and/or stable incorporation of Prp19/CDC5L complex and other B<sup>act</sup> complex proteins. The U2/U6 RNA network in B<sup>028</sup> complexes differs from that of the B<sup>act</sup> complex, consistent with the idea that the catalytic RNA core forms stepwise during the B to B<sup>act</sup> transition and is likely stabilized by the Prp19/CDC5L complex and related proteins. Taken together, our data provide new insights into the RNP rearrangements and extensive exchange of proteins that occurs during spliceosome activation."

Here, we identified a small molecule that inhibits human pre-mRNA splicing at an intermediate stage during conversion of pre-catalytic spliceosomal B complexes into activated B<sup>act</sup> complexes. Characterization of the stalled complexes (designated B<sup>028</sup>) revealed that U4/U6 snRNP proteins are released during activation before the U6 Lsm and B-specific proteins, and before recruitment and/or stable incorporation of Prp19/CDC5L complex and other B<sup>act</sup> complex proteins. The U2/U6 RNA network in B<sup>028</sup> complexes differs from that of the B<sup>act</sup> complex, consistent with the idea that the catalytic RNA core forms stepwise during the B to B<sup>act</sup> transition and is likely stabilized by the Prp19/CDC5L complex and related proteins. Taken together, our data provide new insights into the RNP rearrangements and extensive exchange of proteins that occurs during spliceosome activation."

Spliceosomes assemble de novo on the pre-mRNA substrate in a stepwise manner by the sequential recruitment of five small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (snRNPs) and numerous non-snRNP factors (reviewed by <a href=\"#bib97\">Will and L\u00fchrmann, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib91\">Wahl et al., 2009</a>). Initially, the U1 snRNP binds to the 5\u2019 splice site (SS) and the U2 snRNP interacts stably with the branch site (BS) of the pre-mRNA, forming the A complex. Subsequently, association of the U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP generates the B complex that remains catalytically inactive until it undergoes extensive compositional and conformational rearrangements, including the dissociation of U1 and U4, resulting in the formation of the B<sup>act</sup> complex. The latter is converted into a catalytically active spliceosome (designated B*) by the action of the RNA helicase Prp2 (<a href=\"#bib42\">Kim and Lin, 1996</a>). The B* complex catalyses the first step of splicing, generating the cleaved 5' exon and intron-3' exon lariat intermediates, and at this stage the spliceosomal C complex is generated. After additional RNP rearrangements, the C complex catalyses the second step, resulting in the ligation of the 5' and 3' exons and release of the intron in the form of a lariat."

At the A complex stage, the U1 snRNA base pairs with the 5\u00b4SS of the pre-mRNA and the U2 snRNA basepairs with the BS. Upon integration of the U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP, in which the U6 and U4 snRNAs are base paired and form two extended RNA helices (U4/U6 stem I and stem II) (<a href=\"#bib3\">Agafonov et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Nguyen et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib93\">Wan et al., 2016b</a>), the 5\u2019 end of U2 snRNA base pairs with the 3\u2019 end of U6 snRNA, forming U2/U6 helix II (<a href=\"#bib50\">Madhani and Guthrie, 1992</a>), and stem loop I of U5 snRNA interacts with exon nucleotides near the 5\u00b4SS (<a href=\"#bib59\">Newman and Norman, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib98\">Wyatt et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Sontheimer and Steitz, 1993</a>). The U1 snRNA is displaced from the 5\u00b4SS of the pre-mRNA by the DEAD-box protein Prp28 (<a href=\"#bib85\">Staley and Guthrie, 1999</a>), allowing the base pairing interaction between the 5\u00b4SS and the conserved ACAGA box sequence of the U6 snRNA (<a href=\"#bib77\">Sawa and Abelson, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib95\">Wassarman and Steitz, 1992</a>). A key step during the spliceosome activation phase is the unwinding of the U4/U6 helices by the RNA helicase Brr2 (<a href=\"#bib45\">Laggerbauer et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Raghunathan and Guthrie, 1998</a>). This enables U6 to form short duplexes with U2 (U2/U6 helix Ia and helix Ib), and a catalytically important U6 internal stem loop (that\u00a0is, the U6 ISL), which together coordinate the metal ions important for splicing catalysis (<a href=\"#bib24\">Fica et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Hang et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Galej et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib101\">Yan et al., 2016</a>). The catalytic RNA-RNA network involving U2, U6, and U5 snRNA, that is ultimately established in the spliceosome is comprised of RNA structural elements very similar to the catalytic core of group II self-splicing introns (<a href=\"#bib13\">Chan et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Fica et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Hang et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Galej et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Rauhut et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib92\">Wan et al., 2016a</a>; <a href=\"#bib101\">Yan et al., 2016</a>).

During the B to B<sup>act</sup> transition, about 30 proteins leave the human spliceosome (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bessonov et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Agafonov et al., 2011</a>), including the U4/U6-specific and Lsm proteins, and also the B-specific proteins.

The function of most of the B-specific proteins is not clear, but they are not required for stable integration of the tri-snRNP during B complex formation (<a href=\"#bib9\">Boesler et al., 2016</a>), and instead likely contribute to the activation process, as has been demonstrated for Prp38 (<a href=\"#bib99\">Xie et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Sch\u00fctze et al., 2016</a>)."

The yeast equivalent of the human Prp19/CDC5L complex - the NTC - has been shown to play an essential role in spliceosome activation, with NTC proteins stabilizing the interaction of U5 and U6 with the spliceosome after U4 has been released (<a href=\"#bib12\">Chan et al., 2003</a>). Furthermore, NTC/NTC-related proteins are in intimate contact with the catalytically active RNA network within the B<sup>act</sup>, C and post-catalytic ILS spliceosomes (<a href=\"#bib100\">Yan et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Galej et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Rauhut et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib92\">Wan et al., 2016a</a>; <a href=\"#bib101\">Yan et al., 2016</a>).

However, it is presently not clear whether all of the proteins exchanged at this stage are released/interact concomitantly or stepwise during the B to B<sup>act</sup> transition, and thus whether there is a coordinated handover of one set of proteins with another. Given the extensive exchange of proteins during the transition from the B to B<sup>act</sup> there are likely to be numerous additional, intermediate assembly stages in which only a subset of those proteins exchanged during these transitions are released or recruited. Information about the order of protein recruitment and release, and their temporal relationship to changes in the structure of the spliceosome's catalytic RNA, may shed light on the function of these proteins during activation."

Given the link between splicing and human diseases, including cancer (reviewed by <a href=\"#bib63\">Padgett, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Singh and Cooper, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Scotti and Swanson, 2016</a>), small molecules that modulate the splicing process are also potentially of therapeutic value (<a href=\"#bib10\">Bonnal et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Ohe and Hagiwara, 2015</a>). Although the number of inhibitors of pre-mRNA splicing continues to grow, there remains a limited number of known compounds that stall pre-mRNA splicing at a defined stage.

Several other splicing inhibitors have been reported (<a href=\"#bib64\">Patil et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Samatov et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Effenberger et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Pawellek et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Effenberger et al., 2015</a>), including inhibitors of protein acetylation/deacetylation (<a href=\"#bib44\">Kuhn et al., 2009</a>) and of DNA topoisomerase I (<a href=\"#bib88\">Tazi et al., 2005</a>). Finally, compounds that inhibit the kinase activity of members of the Clk/Sty, SRPK, or DYRK protein families, which phosphorylate serine-arginine-rich SR splicing factors and other spliceosomal proteins, were also identified and shown to modulate alternative splicing patterns in vivo (reviewed by <a href=\"#bib62\">Ohe and Hagiwara, 2015</a>)."

Spliceosomal complexes stalled by this compound (designated B<sup>028</sup>) can be chased into catalytically active complexes by supplementing them with MN-digested nuclear extract, demonstrating that B<sup>028</sup> is not a dead-end complex, but rather a functional spliceosome intermediate. A detailed characterization of the B<sup>028</sup> complexes reveals that the large exchange of proteins that occurs during the conversion of the spliceosomal B complex to\u00a0the activated B<sup>act</sup> complex proceeds stepwise, with the release of U4/U6 proteins occurring prior to and independently of the exchange of other spliceosomal proteins. RNA structure probing suggests that the U2/U6 RNA network in the B<sup>028</sup> complex differs from that of the spliceosomal B<sup>act</sup> complex, consistent with a role for Prp19/CDC5L complex proteins in generating the catalytic RNA network that is ultimately established in B<sup>act</sup>. Our studies underscore the power of small molecule inhibitors of pre-mRNA splicing to study splicing mechanisms and to dissect the highly complex spliceosome activation process."

To check if the stability of the U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP is affected by cp028, we incubated HeLa nuclear extract under splicing conditions (without addition of pre-mRNA) in the presence of DMSO or cp028, and then separated the spliceosomal snRNPs by glycerol gradient centrifugation and determined their distribution by Northern blotting. In the DMSO control, tri-snRNPs peaked in fractions 15 to 18, based on the presence of the U4, U5 and U6 snRNAs (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). In the presence of cp028, tri-snRNPs sedimented as a broader peak in fractions 15 to 21, suggesting that they may be more prone to aggregation (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), and only a small increase in the amount of free U5 and U4/U6 snRNPs was observed in the upper fractions of the gradient, indicating that most of the tri-snRNP remains intact. We also performed immunoprecipitations at different salt concentrations with antibodies directed against the U5-116K/Snu114 protein and determined the extent of coprecipitation of U4 and U6 snRNA (indicating tri-snRNP formation). In the presence of cp028 only a small to moderate decrease in the amount of U4/U6 snRNP that coprecipitated with U5 was observed at 190 and 290 mM salt, compared to the DMSO control (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Thus, cp028 has only a moderate affect on tri-snRNP stability, with most tri-snRNPs still intact under splicing conditions."

Abundant proteins of purified B<sup>028</sup> complexes, as determined by 2D gel electrophoresis, are summarized in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>. U4/U6 proteins, such as Prp3, Prp4 and Prp31, are present in very low amounts in B<sup>028</sup>, consistent with loss of the U4 snRNA (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). In addition, only minor amounts of the tri-snRNP-specific proteins hSnu66 (110K) and hSAD1 (65K) are detected in B<sup>028</sup>. In contrast, the U6-associated Lsm 2\u20138 proteins, which like the U4/U6 and tri-snRNP-specific proteins are normally lost during the conversion of B to B<sup>act</sup>, are still abundant based on the total spectral counts of peptides sequenced by MS (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>) and also on immunoblotting with antibodies against the Lsm4 protein (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). B<sup>act</sup>-specific proteins, which are only abundant in the B<sup>act</sup> complex but not in C, and Prp19/CDC5L complex and related proteins, as well as other B<sup>act</sup> proteins, which are recruited or more stably associated in B<sup>act</sup> complexes (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bessonov et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Agafonov et al., 2011</a>), are absent or highly underrepresented in B<sup>028</sup>. The U2 snRNP SF3b155 protein is hyperphosphorylated during catalytic activation of the spliceosome (<a href=\"#bib94\">Wang et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Girard et al., 2012</a>). Immunoblotting with anti-SF3b155 antibodies that recognize both non-phosphorylated SF3b155 and its slower-migrating, hyperphosphorylated form, as well as with an antibody specific for phosphorylated SF3b155, demonstrated that SF3b155 is not hyperphosphorylated in B<sup>028</sup> complexes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Taken together, these results indicate that B<sup>028</sup> complexes are stalled at an intermediate stage between B and B<sup>act</sup>, after displacement of U4 snRNA by Brr2 and loss of the U4/U6-specific proteins, but before release of the B-specific and Lsm proteins, and recruitment/stable integration of B<sup>act</sup>-specific and Prp19/CDC5L proteins. Assuming that the B<sup>028</sup> complex does not represent an atypical assembly intermediate, these data indicate that the large exchange of proteins during the B to B<sup>act</sup> transition occurs stepwise, with the release of U4/U6 proteins occurring prior to and independently of the exchange other spliceosomal proteins (see Discussion)."

To elucidate the nature of the spliceosomal RNA-RNA network in the B<sup>028</sup> complex, we first performed UV-induced psoralen crosslinking. For comparative purposes, we also analysed purified B and B<sup>act</sup> complexes in parallel. To purify sufficient amounts of the latter complexes, it was necessary to use a truncated pre-mRNA substrate lacking a 3' exon and containing a shortened polypyrimidine tract (that\u00a0is, PM5-10) (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

RNA-RNA crosslinks were analysed via Northern blotting by sequentially incubating with <sup>32</sup>P-labeled probes against U1, U2, U4, and U6 snRNAs, and also by autoradiography of the <sup>32</sup>P-labeled PM5-10 pre-mRNA on which the B, B<sup>028</sup> and B<sup>act</sup> complexes were assembled.

A U2/U6 crosslink, which based on its migration behaviour is U2/U6 helix II (<a href=\"#bib4\">Anokhina et al., 2013</a>), was detected in all complexes, albeit less efficiently in B and B<sup>028</sup>, indicating base pairing between the 5' and 3' end of U2 and U6, respectively. The reduced efficiency of the U2/U6 crosslink in B and B<sup>028</sup> might be due to the presence of the Lsm proteins, which are located in the human tri-snRNP near the region of U6 that forms U2/U6 helix II and thereby may hinder crosslinking (<a href=\"#bib3\">Agafonov et al., 2016</a>). Likewise, a U6/pre-mRNA crosslink, consistent with a U6 ACAGA box/5'SS base pairing interaction, was also detected in all three complexes, but less efficiently in B<sup>028</sup> (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

                                "text": "Previous work from our lab showed that the catalytically important U2/U6 snRNA interaction forms a three helix (three-way) junction in B<sup>act</sup> complexes (<a href=\"#bib4\">Anokhina et al., 2013</a>) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). However, an alternative U2/U6 conformation\u2014that\u00a0is, a four helix (four-way) junction, was also previously proposed (<a href=\"#bib86\">Sun and Manley, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Sashital et al., 2004</a>) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). In the latter, the U6 ISL forms an extended lower stem, which precludes formation of U2/U6 helix Ib, and U2 instead forms an internal stem-loop (SL1). Most nucleotides comprising the U6 ISL loop (G67-A70) are accessible in B<sup>act</sup>, whereas nucleotides forming the stem (U57-U64 and A70-A77) are not accessible or only very weakly accessible (with the exception of A70 and G75), consistent with the formation of the ISL (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). U6 ISL loop nucleotides (A69, C68, C66) are also accessible in B<sup>028</sup>, but to a lower extent compared to those in B<sup>act</sup>; this enhanced protection of ISL loop nucleotides in B<sup>028</sup> could potentially be due to shielding by bound proteins. Nucleotides of the ISL stem are highly protected in B<sup>028</sup>, suggesting that the ISL stem is indeed formed. Interestingly, U6 nts 79\u201381 are protected in B<sup>028</sup>, but not in B<sup>act</sup>, suggesting that the lower part of the ISL stem is extended in B<sup>028</sup> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>), consistent with the formation of a four-way U2-U6 junction (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>), in contrast to the three-way junction that forms in B<sup>act</sup>. The base pairing partners of U6-G80 and U6-C81 in the four-way junction model\u2014that\u00a0is, U6-C55 and U6-G54 - are also protected in B<sup>028</sup>; however, this would also be the case if U2/U6 helix Ib were formed, as is observed with B<sup>act</sup>. The U2 chemical modification pattern in this region is consistent with the formation of both U2/U6 helix Ib (three-way) and the U2 SL1 (four-way), given that the observed, moderate modification of its loop-closing G-C base pair (C14 and G19) is attributed to breathing of this short U2 helix (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). U6 nts A50-U52 involved in U2/U6 helix Ia formation are relatively well-protected in both B<sup>028</sup> and B<sup>act</sup>, with only weak modification of A50, while G49 is accessible in both B<sup>act</sup> and B<sup>028</sup> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). In addition, U2 nts involved in helix Ia formation (G25-C28) are also protected against modification (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), consistent with the formation of U2/U6 helix Ia in both the B<sup>028</sup> and B<sup>act</sup> complex. Taken together, our results indicate that the U6 ISL and U2/U6 helix Ia are formed in B<sup>028</sup>, but that the conformation of the U2/U6 junction in B<sup>028</sup> differs from that in B<sup>act</sup>, possibly forming a four-way as opposed to a three-way junction. This, in turn, is consistent with the idea that the catalytic RNA network of the spliceosome is rearranged in multiple steps during catalytic activation."

When affinity-purified B<sup>028</sup> complexes were incubated under splicing conditions in the absence of extract, no splicing was observed (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). However, when micrococcal nuclease (MN) treated nuclear extract\u2014in which all endogenous snRNPs were degraded\u2014was added, both catalytic steps of splicing were observed, at levels similar to that observed with purified B complexes plus MN-treated extract (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Splicing was not observed when pre-mRNA alone was incubated under splicing conditions with MN-treated extract (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Thus, purified B<sup>028</sup> can be chased into a mature spliceosome that catalyzes both steps of splicing, demonstrating that it is a functional intermediate. However, when cp028 was added to the MN-treated extract, no splicing was observed after incubation with both B and B<sup>028</sup> complexes (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). This suggests that cp028 binds to and/or inactivates a splicing factor required for the conversion of the B/B<sup>028</sup> complexes into catalytically active spliceosomes."

To elucidate its structure, we analysed affinity-purified B<sup>028</sup> complexes by negative-stain electron microscopy (EM) after gradient fixation (GraFix). An overview of the negatively-stained raw images revealed a homogeneous population of monodisperse particles of the same basic morphology with a maximum length of\u00a0~40 nm (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). The majority of B<sup>028</sup> particles exhibit a roughly triangular shape, with a lower foot-like protrusion. Classification and class averaging of these single particle images (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>) revealed that in the most dominant classes (comprising ca. 40%) the B<sup>028</sup> complex exhibits a triangular shape with a long density element on the left and an upper more globular domain (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>, columns 1\u20132). Classes with a mushroom-like shape (columns 3\u20134, rows 1\u20133) were observed much less frequently (in ca. 20% of the class averages), as were classes showing both mushroom and triangular shape features (columns 3\u20134, last row; ca. 20%). The basic morphology of the various EM views of the B<sup>028</sup> complex indicates that it shares similarities with the spliceosomal B complex, when the triangular views are considered, and similarities with the B<sup>act</sup> complex, when the mushroom views are compared. That is, the human B complex exhibits a triangular or rhombic shape, with a foot region and elongated density element along one side (the so-called foot-stump axis), similar to B<sup>028</sup>. The upper end of this main axis appears somewhat different in both complexes. In addition, the head domain of the B complex points more upward compared to B<sup>028</sup>, generating a more rhombic shape in the vast majority of classes, whereas the globular (head) domain in B<sup>028</sup> is orientated more toward the central region of the particle, leading to its isosceles triangle shape. Thus, despite many similarities, there appear to be clear structural differences between B<sup>028</sup> and B complexes. Although in some cases B<sup>028</sup> exhibited a mushroom-like shape typical for the human B<sup>act</sup> complex, structural similarities between B<sup>act</sup> and B<sup>028</sup> are limited in the predominant views of the latter, and structural details seen in B<sup>028</sup> are not recognizable in B<sup>act</sup>. This may in part be due to differences in their adsorption to the carbon film, which would lead to different views of B<sup>028</sup> versus B<sup>act</sup>."

Whereas most of the structural variations of the <i>p</i>-fluorophenyl group had little or no effect on activity (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplements 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s2\">2</a>), introducing fluorine or chlorine at the meta-position of the fluorophenyl group (analogues 343867 and 343871) compared to fluorine at the para-position (as found in cp028), enhanced slightly the splicing inhibition effect (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplements 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s2\">2</a>). Replacing the fluorine of the <i>p</i>-fluorophenyl group with a phenyl group (analogue 343868) or replacing the <i>p</i>-fluorophenyl group by a piperidine (analogue 344353) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplements 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s2\">2</a>) abolished inhibition activity completely. In addition, removing the furan group also reduced the potency dramatically (analogues 343878 and 343879). Thus, the fluorophenyl group and the furan group are required for inhibiting pre-mRNA splicing in vitro and likely play an important role in target recognition. Nearly all modifications in the ethylphenyl group (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplements 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s2\">2</a>), or its omission (analogue 343135), had only minimal or no substantial effect on the potency of cp028, suggesting that this structural feature it is not essential for splicing inhibition in vitro. Thus, this site could potentially be used to introduce a tag to identify the target(s) of compound 028 in the splicing reaction. Notably, reduction of the conjugated double bond (analogue 343139, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>) completely abolished splicing inhibition, suggesting that cp028 likely exerts its inhibitory activity by covalently modifying one or several target proteins and/or that the rotational freedom afforded by a single bond may be deleterious for its inhibition activity."

One of the confirmed hit compounds, termed cp028, inhibited splicing in HeLa nuclear extract with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 54 \u00b5M. Cp028 not only hindered spliceosome assembly at the A complex stage, but also led to the accumulation of a novel spliceosome assembly intermediate (B<sup>028</sup>), stalled during the extensive rearrangements of the B complex that ultimately yield the B<sup>act</sup> complex. Importantly, purified B<sup>028</sup> complexes could be chased into catalytically active complexes by supplementing them with MN-digested nuclear extract, indicating that B<sup>028</sup> is not a dead-end complex, but rather a functional spliceosome intermediate. However, we cannot rule out that B<sup>028</sup> might represent an atypical intermediate that is not normally formed during the spliceosome activation phase, but that nonetheless can be chased into an active spliceosome. Cp028 stalls the spliceosome assembly process at a novel stage during activation, distinguishing it from previously reported small molecule inhibitors of splicing that block spliceosome assembly at earlier stages (<a href=\"#bib61\">O'Brien et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Kuhn et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Roybal and Jurica, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Corrionero et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Folco et al., 2011</a>) or first during the catalytic steps of splicing (<a href=\"#bib5\">Berg et al., 2012</a>). Thus, cp028 represents a new tool to study pre-mRNA splicing mechanisms, in particular to dissect/modulate the highly complex spliceosome activation process."

                                "text": "Our knowledge about the spliceosome's highly complex compositional dynamics is hampered by the limited number of distinct spliceosomal complexes that can be biochemically detected or isolated. The progression from a precatalytic B to B<sup>act</sup> spliceosomal complex involves multiple RNP rearrangements, and the recruitment and release of a large number of proteins in both higher and lower eukaryotes. During this step the U4 snRNA, U4/U6 proteins, U6-associated Lsm proteins and so-called B-specific proteins are destabilized/released from the spliceosome, whereas B<sup>act</sup>-specific proteins, components of the Prp19/CDC5L complex, and a group of proteins designated Prp19/CDC5L-related are recruited. Whether these remodelling events occur concomitantly or in a stepwise fashion, and the order of protein requirement and release has remained unclear. Our MS and 2D gel analyses of purified B<sup>028</sup> complexes, together with western blotting, suggest that the loss of the U4/U6 proteins (hPrp3, hPrp4, hPrp31, 20K and 15.5K), presumably during the Brr2-mediated unwinding of the U4/U6 duplex, can occur independently of the release of the U6 Lsm proteins or B-specific proteins. Likewise, the recruitment of the human Prp19/CDC5L complex and related proteins, as well as B<sup>act</sup>-specific proteins, appear to occur after the release of the U4/U6-specific proteins. However, the order of these subsequent compositional changes remains unclear. A number of studies including very recent single molecule studies in yeast, indicate that the recruitment of the NTC occurs after release of the U4 snRNA (<a href=\"#bib87\">Tarn et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Chan et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Hoskins et al., 2016</a>), which is consistent with U4/U6 protein release preceeding recruitment of the vast majority of the Prp19/CDC5L complex. Release of the U6 snRNA from U4 allows rearrangements in the structure of the U6 snRNA. The formation of a rearranged U6 structure, including formation of the U6 ISL, may provide new binding sites that enable the recruitment/stable binding of the Prp19/CDC5L complex and related proteins, and/or B<sup>act</sup> proteins. In yeast, the NTC was reported to be required for the release of the Lsm proteins from the 3\u2032-end of U6 snRNA (<a href=\"#bib12\">Chan et al., 2003</a>), thus the interaction or stable association of the Prp19/CDC5L complex and related proteins with the spliceosome may be a prerequisite for the subsequent loss of the Lsm proteins from the spliceosome during activation. Indeed, recent cryo-EM studies of the <i>S. cerevisiae</i> spliceosomal B<sup>act</sup> complex, revealed that several NTC proteins (e.g. Syf1, Syf2 and Syf3) are close to U2/U6 helix II and thus to the 3' end of the U6 snRNA (<a href=\"#bib70\">Rauhut et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib101\">Yan et al., 2016</a>). As the Lsm proteins bind the 3' end of U6 (<a href=\"#bib1\">Achsel et al., 1999</a>), it is likely that their binding and that of the aforementioned NTC proteins is mutually exclusive."

This frees U6 snRNA to engage in new intra- and inter-molecular base pairing interactions, leading to the catalytically active RNA network within the spliceosome. Our structure probing data (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>) suggest that in B<sup>028</sup> the U6 snRNA has rearranged and formed the functionally important ISL, but that the lower stem of the U6-ISL is extended by three base pairs. This would prevent formation of U2/U6 helix Ib and is consistent with the formation of a U2/U6 four-way (four RNA helix) junction. As U2 and U6 have been shown to form a three-way junction in human B<sup>act</sup> complexes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>)(<a href=\"#bib4\">Anokhina et al., 2013</a>), the apparently different structure of U2/U6 in B<sup>028</sup> may represent an intermediate conformation that forms directly after release of U6 from the U4 duplex by Brr2.

U2/U6 four-helix junction formation had been documented previously only with protein-free snRNAs (<a href=\"#bib76\">Sashital et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Guo et al., 2009</a>), and it is thus likely that spliceosomal proteins promote the formation of a U2/U6 three-helix junction. Subsequent conversion of the apparent U2/U6 four-way junction observed in B<sup>028</sup>, to a three-way junction, may require the interaction of proteins normally recruited/stabilized during activation, and/or the loss of the Lsm or B-specific proteins, that are normally released prior to B<sup>act</sup> formation. In the yeast B<sup>act</sup> complex, the catalytic U2/U6 RNA network is contacted not only by the U5 Prp8 protein, but also by Cef1 (CDC5L in human) and Prp46 (Prl1 in human), which are present in the human Prp19/CDC5L complex, and the Prp19/CDC5L-related proteins Syf3, Prp45 (SKIP/SNW1 in human) and Cwc2 (RBM22 in human) (<a href=\"#bib69\">Rasche et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Rauhut et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib101\">Yan et al., 2016</a>). Given the multiple contacts that the Prp19/CDC5L complex and related proteins make with the catalytic RNA network of the spliceosome already at the B<sup>act</sup> stage, it is very likely that they act as chaperones that help to form/maintain the active conformation of the RNA network. Indeed, genetic experiments in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> indicate that Cwc2 helps to stabilize U2/U6 helix 1 (<a href=\"#bib36\">Hogg et al., 2014</a>). As the U2/U6 three and four helix conformations are competing structures, and B<sup>028</sup> complexes lack the Prp19/CDC5L complex and related proteins, these proteins may shift the equilibrium toward the three helix structure once they are stably incorporated into the spliceosome."

This suggests that it targets or interferes with one or more spliceosomal components (or potentially the posttranslational modification thereof) that is/are specifically involved in splicing in higher eukaryotes. Indeed, while there is conservation of the core spliceosomal components between yeast and man, mammalian spliceosomes contain a large number of proteins not found in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> (<a href=\"#bib22\">Fabrizio et al., 2009</a>)."

Indeed gradient centrifugation and co-immunoprecipitation experiments indicated that most tri-snRNPs are intact under splicing conditions. The conversion of the spliceosomal A complex into a B complex with stably associated U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP is dependent not only on an intact tri-snRNP, but also on several splicing factors, including SPF30 (<a href=\"#bib68\">Rappsilber et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Meister et al., 2001</a>), the U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP proteins 65K/hSAD1 and 110K/hSART1 (<a href=\"#bib52\">Makarova et al., 2001</a>), SR proteins (<a href=\"#bib72\">Roscigno and Garcia-Blanco, 1995</a>), the kinases hPrp4K (<a href=\"#bib78\">Schneider et al., 2010</a>) and SRPK2 (<a href=\"#bib55\">Mathew et al., 2008</a>) and the DEAD-box helicase Prp28 (<a href=\"#bib85\">Staley and Guthrie, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Mathew et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Boesler et al., 2016</a>). Thus, one or more of these proteins are potentially targeted directly or indirectly by cp028. It is also conceivable that cp028 affects the structure or composition of the A complex such that stable tri-snRNP integration is impaired. However, the protein composition of affinity-purified A<sup>028</sup> complexes was nearly identical to that of A complexes formed in the absence of cp028, except A<sup>028</sup> no longer contained stoichiometric amounts of the DEAD box protein Prp5 and the splicing factor SPF45, both of which are not involved in B complex formation (<a href=\"#bib74\">Ruby et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Lallena et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Liang and Cheng, 2015</a>)."

Release of the Lsm proteins and B-specific proteins is blocked, as well as recruitment/stable association of B<sup>act</sup> proteins and Prp19/CDC5L complex and related proteins. Thus, one or more of these proteins may be targetted by cp028, or alternatively the binding partners of these proteins in the B complex may be affected/compromised. Our structure-activity relationship studies revealed chemical groups that do not contribute to the inhibition activity of cp028, such as the primary ethyl group. Thus, modified versions of cp028 containing a tag at this position can be generated and potentially used in future experiments to identify its target(s) in the spliceosome."

The COMAS library mainly consists of commercial screening compounds, which were chosen according to diversity and drug-likeness, but also contains natural-product-like substances and known drugs. Prior to screening, the amount of antibody, washing volumes and the concentration of the nuclear extract were optimized to yield a screening-ready assay with an assay window of approximately 9 and a Z\u2019 value of ca. 0.5. For high throughput screening, black 384 well Greiner Fluotrac 600 high-binding microplates (Cat. No. 781077) were first coated with rabbit anti-MBP antibodies in 20 mM HEPES-KOH (pH 7.9) (0.02 mg/ml, 10 \u00b5l/well) by incubating at 27\u00b0C overnight with shaking. The plates were subsequently washed twice using 50 \u00b5l bottom wash and 50 \u00b5l well washing options (Elx405 Washer, Biotek, VT, USA) with crosswise final aspiration of washing buffer (1 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 0.075 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 7.5 mM NaCl, 0.005% Tween20). Next, 50 nl of compound (10 mM in DMSO) were added by acoustic dispensing technology (Echo520, Labcyte Inc., Sunnyvale, Ca, USA). Directly after that, 10 \u00b5l of a splicing mixture containing 40% (v/v) HeLa nuclear extract (containing Flag-tagged Abstract protein), 0.1 \u00b5g/ml anti-FLAG-HRP antibodies, 0.1 pmoles of PM5 pre-mRNA (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bessonov et al., 2008</a>) bound by MS2-MBP, 24 mM HEPES-KOH (pH 7.9), 65 mM KCl, 2 mM ATP, 20 mM creatine phosphate, 3.0 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 0.1% Tween 20, were dispensed into the assay plates (Multidrop Combi, Thermo Fisher\u00a0Scientific, MA, USA). PM5 pre-mRNA containing MS2 aptamers was pre-incubated with MS2-MBP for 30 min on ice (in 100 mM Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9). The plates were shaken briefly using a Teleshake (Inheco, Germany) and the splicing mixtures were incubated for 2 hr at 25\u00b0C. Plates were subsequently washed twice with washing buffer using 300 \u00b5l bottom wash and 50 \u00b5L well wash options of the Elx405 Washer with crosswise final aspiration. Subsequently, 10 \u00b5l of SuperSignal ELISA Femto Substrate (Pierce, cat. no. 37075) were dispensed into the assay plates (Multidrop Fisher Combi, Thermo Scientific, MA, USA) and the luminescence signal was read after 8 min incubation using a Spectramax Paradigm reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, Ca, USA). Positive and negative controls were included on every plate. The positive control contained all assay components, except 50 nl DMSO alone was added, and in the negative control the PM5 pre-mRNA was omitted. Primary screening identified ca. 2700 compounds that reduced the luminescence signal to less than 50% compared to the DMSO-treated positive control. These primary hit compounds were retested in duplicate using the same assay conditions. Thirty of these reduced the luminescence signal to less than 50% of the DMSO control in both replicates and were thus further analyzed in standard in vitro splicing reactions using the MINX pre-mRNA substrate (<a href=\"#bib103\">Zillmann et al., 1988</a>), leading to the identification of eight small molecule inhibitors of splicing (that\u00a0is, a false positive rate of ca 1.6%)."
