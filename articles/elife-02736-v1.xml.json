Recently, memory reconsolidation was suggested to reinforce or integrate new information into reactivated memory. Here, we show that reactivated inhibitory avoidance (IA) memory is enhanced through reconsolidation under conditions in which memory extinction is not induced. This memory enhancement is mediated by neurons in the amygdala, hippocampus, and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) through the simultaneous activation of calcineurin-induced proteasome-dependent protein degradation and cAMP responsive element binding protein-mediated gene expression. Interestingly, the amygdala is required for memory reconsolidation and enhancement, whereas the hippocampus and mPFC are required for only memory enhancement. Furthermore, memory enhancement triggered by retrieval utilizes distinct mechanisms to strengthen IA memory by additional learning that depends only on the amygdala. Our findings indicate that reconsolidation functions to strengthen the original memory and show the dynamic nature of reactivated memory through protein degradation and gene expression in multiple brain regions."

Recently, memory reconsolidation was suggested to reinforce or integrate new information into reactivated memory. Here, we show that reactivated inhibitory avoidance (IA) memory is enhanced through reconsolidation under conditions in which memory extinction is not induced. This memory enhancement is mediated by neurons in the amygdala, hippocampus, and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) through the simultaneous activation of calcineurin-induced proteasome-dependent protein degradation and cAMP responsive element binding protein-mediated gene expression. Interestingly, the amygdala is required for memory reconsolidation and enhancement, whereas the hippocampus and mPFC are required for only memory enhancement. Furthermore, memory enhancement triggered by retrieval utilizes distinct mechanisms to strengthen IA memory by additional learning that depends only on the amygdala. Our findings indicate that reconsolidation functions to strengthen the original memory and show the dynamic nature of reactivated memory through protein degradation and gene expression in multiple brain regions."

Previous studies have presented evidence that memory retrieval is a dynamic process during which memories can be made stronger, weaker, or their content altered (<a href=\"#bib26\">Misanin et al., 1968</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Schneider and Sherman, 1968</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Lewis, 1979</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Mactutus et al., 1979</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Gordon, 1981</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Nader et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Nader and Hardt, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Dudai, 2012</a>). Recent studies have shown that reactivated memory becomes labile after retrieval and is re-stabilized through a gene expression-dependent process known as memory reconsolidation. Memory reconsolidation after retrieval may be used to maintain or update long-term memories, reinforcing or integrating new information into them (<a href=\"#bib29\">Nader et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Dudai, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Tronel et al., 2005</a>). However, the function of memory reconsolidation still remains unclear; especially, whether memory reconsolidation strengthens the original memory (<a href=\"#bib43\">Tronson et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Inda et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Pedroso et al., 2013</a>). Importantly, the reinforcement of traumatic memory after retrieval (i.e., re-experience such as flashbacks or nightmares) may be associated with the development of emotional disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)."

Therefore, in the majority of reconsolidation paradigms, reactivation also includes extinction learning, which could confound how reconsolidation functions; the dominance of the original or new memory traces is thought to determine the fate of memory through their competition (<a href=\"#bib6\">Eisenberg et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Pedreira and Maldonado, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Suzuki et al., 2004</a>).

In the IA task, mice receive an electrical footshock after they enter a dark (shock) compartment from a light (safe) compartment and form a memory to avoid the dark compartment. Re-exposure to the light compartment could elicit fear memory without giving the mice the opportunity to acquire extinction of the dark compartment memory. This is because the mice can only learn that the dark compartment does not lead to shock only after they have experienced this event by re-entering the dark compartment. This procedural control allows this paradigm to discriminate the reconsolidation and extinction phases at the time point when the mice enter the dark compartment from the light compartment. In the present study, we established a mouse model in which fear memory is enhanced after retrieval using the IA task and investigated the mechanisms of fear memory enhancement through reconsolidation."

The following four groups were used in this experiment: two groups which were trained with a footshock (Trained [T] groups) and the remaining two groups which did not receive a footshock (Untrained [U] groups). During Reactivation, the animals were either returned to the light compartment (T/R and U/R) or not (T/NR and U/NR).

We performed a similar experiment as in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, except that the mice received a micro-infusion of ANI or VEH into the amygdala, hippocampus, or mPFC immediately after Reactivation. Similarly with the results for the systemic injection of ANI (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), inhibition of protein synthesis in the amygdala resulted in the disruption of the reactivated IA memory (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). Interestingly, protein synthesis inhibition in the hippocampus or mPFC failed to disrupt the reactivated IA memory, but blocked its enhancement (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F,G</a>); the ANI groups displayed comparable crossover latency between Reactivation and PR-LTM. It is important to note that protein synthesis inhibition in both the hippocampus and mPFC blocked the enhancement of IA memory, but did not disrupt IA memory; furthermore, mice infused with ANI to the hippocampus or mPFC displayed a comparable enhancement of IA memory at PR-LTM-2 at 48 hr after PR-LTM-1 compared to the VEH group at PR-LTM-1 (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Thus, these observations suggest that the inhibition of protein synthesis in the hippocampus or mPFC at Reactivation simply blocks the enhancement of IA memory without modulating it. These results are consistent with a previous finding that protein synthesis in the amygdala, but not the hippocampus, is required for the reconsolidation of IA memory (<a href=\"#bib41\">Taubenfeld et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Milekic et al., 2007</a>), but more interestingly, suggest distinct roles for the amygdala and hippocampus/mPFC in the enhancement and reconsolidation of IA memory; new gene expression in the amygdala is required for the reconsolidation and enhancement of IA memory, while new gene expression in the hippocampus and mPFC is required only for its enhancement."

This phosphorylation is thought to alter the function of AMPAR and contribute to the expression of LTP and LTD. To examine the possibility that synaptic plasticity was changed following Reactivation, the phosphorylation of Ser831 and Ser845 in the synaptic membrane fraction of the amygdala, dorsal hippocampus, and mPFC regions was measured at 30 min after Reactivation. Significant increases in Ser831 and Ser845 phosphorylation were observed in the amygdala, hippocampus, and mPFC regions of the T/R groups compared to the control groups (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H,I</a>). Furthermore, time course analyses indicated that increases in Ser831 and Ser845 phosphorylation in the T/R groups peaked at 30 min and returned to basal levels by 180 min after Reactivation (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a>).

Therefore, we investigated the roles of this protein degradation process in the brain systems regulating reconsolidation/enhancement. To do this, we compared c-fos induction and Lys48-linked poly-ubiquitin chain (Ub-Lys48), an activation marker of proteasome-dependent protein degradation, in the amygdala, hippocampus, and mPFC using immunohistochemistry. Consistent with the results shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, we observed increases in the number of c-fos-positive cells in the LA and BA of the amygdala, CA1 and CA3 of the hippocampus, and PL and IL of the mPFC only in the T/R group (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013F</a>). Interestingly, significant increases in the number of Ub-Lys48-positive cells were observed in the same regions of the T/R group where c-fos was induced (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013F</a>).

To compare the mechanisms of memory enhancement through retrieval and additional training, we examined the mechanisms of IA memory enhancement by additional training in our experimental condition (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). We performed a similar experiment as in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, except that the mice received a footshock at Reactivation (Training-2) at 5 s after they entered the dark compartment and then received micro-infusions of drugs immediately after Training-2 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Crossover latency increased dramatically in the VEH group at PR-LTM (3940 \u00b1 571.5 s) at 48 hr after Training-2 compared to following Reactivation (without a footshock in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), suggesting that additional training enhanced IA memory more than retrieval without a footshock. Similarly with a previous report, inhibition of protein synthesis in the amygdala disrupted IA memory, whereas inhibition of proteasome-dependent protein degradation with or without protein synthesis inhibition blocked the enhancement and disruption induced by ANI, respectively, of IA memory (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). These results were consistent with previous findings that protein degradation and synthesis in the amygdala are required for strengthening fear memory mediated by additional training. More interestingly, in contrast to the results shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, the inhibition of protein synthesis in the hippocampus or mPFC did not affect the enhancement of IA memory by additional training (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,D</a>). Taken together, our observations that gene expression in the hippocampus and mPFC is required only for IA memory enhancement following retrieval indicate that these brain regions contribute to the enhancement of fear memory following retrieval, but not additional training, and more importantly, memory enhancement by retrieval utilizes a mechanism distinct from that used for additional learning."

In this study, we developed IA paradigms in which the retrieval of fear memory triggers reconsolidation without inducing memory extinction; the reconsolidation and extinction phases are discriminated at the time point when the mice enter a dark compartment from a light compartment. Using this paradigm, we found that memory retrieval enhances IA memory through reconsolidation. In contrast to the mechanisms for the reinforcement of contextual fear memory by additional learning, the enhancement of IA memory by retrieval required CREB-mediated gene expression and calcineurin-induced proteasome-dependent protein degradation not only in the amygdala but also in the hippocampus and mPFC. Consistently, IA memory retrieval was suggested to induce synaptic plasticity in these brain regions through the phosphorylation of AMPAR. Interestingly, we further found that the amygdala is required for the reconsolidation and enhancement of IA memory, whereas the hippocampus and mPFC are required for the enhancement, but not reconsolidation, of IA memory. These findings suggest that an IA memory is enhanced/reconsolidated through the reactivation of memory circuits consisting of multiple brain regions including the amygdala, hippocampus, and mPFC and that the amygdala plays central and distinct roles from the hippocampus and mPFC in the enhancement/reconsolidation of IA memory. It is important to investigate further the differences in the roles of the hippocampus and mPFC in the enhancement of an IA memory."

We found that the amygdaloid neurons reactivated by the retrieval of an IA memory activated proteasome-dependent protein degradation and gene expression, suggesting that these reactivated neurons regulate the destabilization and re-stabilization of IA memory. Importantly, our finding that inhibition of CaN blocked proteasome-dependent protein degradation, but not gene expression, suggests that destabilization and re-stabilization are regulated independently at the early stages of the signal transduction pathways activated after memory retrieval. Furthermore, our finding that the activation of gene expression and proteasome-dependent protein degradation in the hippocampus and mPFC is required for the enhancement, but not reconsolidation, of an IA memory also suggests that the activation of proteasome-dependent protein degradation is not only required for the destabilization of a reactivated memory but also plays additional roles in the modification or alteration of memory without the induction of destabilization."

These findings suggest that destabilization and extinction, both of which are triggered by memory retrieval, share similar signal transduction cascades. It is important to investigate further and compare the molecular mechanisms that underlie the destabilization and extinction of reactivated fear memory. Understanding such mechanisms will enable the identification of the mechanism by which the fate of a memory is determined, that is, reconsolidation or extinction."

Moreover, the authors show the dependence of the memory enhancement on CREB-dependent transcription and calcineurin-induced proteasome activation. The authors use various behavioural, biochemical, genetic and immunochistochemical techniques in the study. To our knowledge, this manuscript represents one of the most important contributions to memory enhancement through memory reconsolidation. It outlines the contributions of several brain regions (amygdala, hippocampus and medial prefrontal) and signaling systems (CREB transcription and CaN-dependent protein degradation) to this important process. Central to this impressive paper is the behavioral approach the authors developed for studies of memory reconsolidation."
