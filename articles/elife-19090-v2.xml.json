Here, we present a complete sequence assembly of the germline genome and analyze multiple features of its structure and its relationship to the somatic genome, shedding light on the mechanisms of genome rearrangement as well as the evolutionary history of this remarkable germline/soma differentiation. Our results strengthen the notion that a complex, dynamic, and ongoing interplay between mobile DNA elements and the host genome have shaped <i>Tetrahymena</i> chromosome structure, locally and globally. Non-standard outcomes of rearrangement events, including the generation of short-lived somatic chromosomes and excision of DNA interrupting protein-coding regions, may represent novel forms of developmental gene regulation. We also compare <i>Tetrahymena</i>\u2019s germline/soma differentiation to that of other characterized ciliates, illustrating the wide diversity of adaptations that have occurred within this phylum."

Here, we present a complete sequence assembly of the germline genome and analyze multiple features of its structure and its relationship to the somatic genome, shedding light on the mechanisms of genome rearrangement as well as the evolutionary history of this remarkable germline/soma differentiation. Our results strengthen the notion that a complex, dynamic, and ongoing interplay between mobile DNA elements and the host genome have shaped <i>Tetrahymena</i> chromosome structure, locally and globally. Non-standard outcomes of rearrangement events, including the generation of short-lived somatic chromosomes and excision of DNA interrupting protein-coding regions, may represent novel forms of developmental gene regulation. We also compare <i>Tetrahymena</i>\u2019s germline/soma differentiation to that of other characterized ciliates, illustrating the wide diversity of adaptations that have occurred within this phylum."

Some cases mediate the generation of protein products specific to a differentiated cell type, such as sigmaK of the <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> mother cell (<a href=\"#bib82\">Kunkel et al., 1990</a>) or the vast diversity of vertebrate immunoglobulins (<a href=\"#bib120\">Schatz, 2004</a>). Other cases result in genome-wide chromosome restructuring, as was first recognized by microscopic observation of parasitic nematodes over 125 years ago (<a href=\"#bib17\">Boveri, 1887</a>) and since documented in several eukaryotic branches, including vertebrates (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bachmann-Waldmann et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib128\">Smith et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib131\">Sun et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib141\">Wang and Davis, 2014</a>). This large-scale phenomenon has been most thoroughly studied in the phylum Ciliophora, or ciliates, a deep-branching and diverse group of protozoa (<a href=\"#bib18\">Bracht et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Chalker and Yao, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Coyne et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib138\">Vogt et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib147\">Yao et al., 2014</a>). Although unicellular, ciliates carry two distinct nuclei that display a remarkable form of germline/soma differentiation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>; <a href=\"#bib106\">Orias et al., 2011</a>); the smaller, diploid, transcriptionally silent germline nucleus (micronucleus or MIC) contains the genetic material transmitted across sexual generations, whereas the larger, polyploid, actively expressed somatic nucleus (macronucleus or MAC) supports all the vegetative functions of the cell. Despite differing in several fundamental features of eukaryotic nuclei, the MAC is derived from a mitotic sibling of the MIC during sexual reproduction in a process that involves extensive, genome-wide programmed DNA rearrangements."

Cross-sequence alignment is represented by vertical dotted lines. Inter-scaffold assembly gaps are indicated by letters a, b, and c, for gaps in the MIC, MAC and both assemblies, respectively. The ends of MAC chromosome scaffolds terminating in telomere repeats are indicated by the letter d. When the ends of two MIC scaffolds align to adjacent regions of the same MAC scaffold (letter a), we may infer that these ends are adjacent in the MIC genome (unlike certain ciliates with highly 'scrambled' MIC genomes, <i>T. thermophila</i>'s MAC chromosomes are nearly always colinear with their MIC counterparts). The same principle applies to joining MAC scaffolds and chromosomes (letters b and d). This process could partially be carried out computationally, but human judgments (performed independently in two labs) were necessary in many cases to resolve alternative joining paths resulting from repetitive sequences or apparent MIC genome mis-assemblies (see <a href=\"#SD5-data\">Supplementary file 1C</a>). Unfortunately, both assemblies often 'break' in the same region (letter c), leaving no 'bridge' to the next scaffold in either. This occurred most often in regions abundant in smaller scaffolds, which we later found tend to be located near the middle of MIC chromosomes. Combining tiling and other data, as described in the main text, we constructed \u2018best approximation\u2019 MIC chromosome super-assemblies that incorporate 97% of the MIC genome assembly."

In the widely studied model organism, <i>Tetrahymena thermophila</i>, the five MIC chromosomes are fragmented at sites of the 15 bp Chromosome breakage sequence (Cbs) (<a href=\"#bib151\">Yao et al., 1990</a>) into about 200 MAC chromosomes (<a href=\"#bib44\">Eisen et al., 2006</a>). Other characterized ciliates also undergo extensive chromosome fragmentation but do not display a conserved cis-acting breakage signal. It has been suggested that the evolutionary advantage of chromosome fragmentation may relate to the high ploidy of MACs (~45N for all but one chromosome in <i>Tetrahymena</i>,\u00a0~800\u00a0N in <i>Paramecium</i>,\u00a0~2000\u00a0N in <i>Oxytricha</i>) and their amitotic division mechanism, which could damage larger chromosomes or be physically constrained by their entanglement (<a href=\"#bib34\">Coyne et al., 1996</a>). This amitotic mechanism also results in unequal chromosome segregation, which can lead to the generation of phenotypic diversity among the vegetative descendants of a single cell ('phenotypic assortment', documented in <i>Tetrahymena</i> (<a href=\"#bib107\">Orias and Flacks, 1975</a>). In addition, fragmentation permits differential copy number control (observed in <i>Tetrahymena</i> (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib146\">Yao et al.

In <i>Paramecium tetraurelia</i>, a fellow oligohymenophorean ciliate distantly related to <i>Tetrahymena</i> (<a href=\"#bib11\">Baroin-Tourancheau et al., 1992</a>), partial assembly of the MIC genome has revealed the presence of about 45,000 short, unique copy IESs, many lying within the MIC progenitors of MAC genes (<a href=\"#bib4\">Arnaiz et al., 2012</a>). The more distantly related spirotrichous ciliate, <i>Oxytricha trifallax</i> undergoes an extreme type of genome rearrangement. Roughly 16,000 MAC chromosomes (most carrying only a single gene) (<a href=\"#bib132\">Swart et al., 2013</a>) are derived from a MIC genome ten times the size of the MAC genome, in a process that also involves extensive 'unscrambling' of non-contiguous MIC genome sequences (<a href=\"#bib32\">Chen et al., 2014</a>)."

In some cases, this involvement is as an agent of the event, through domesticated gene products (e.g. Rag recombinases [<a href=\"#bib55\">Fugmann, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Jones and Gellert, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Kapitonov and Koonin, 2015</a>], HO endonuclease [<a href=\"#bib80\">Koufopanou and Burt, 2005</a>]); in other cases, mobile elements are a target of programmed rearrangement events (e.g. the <i>B. subtilis</i> Skin element that interrupts the sigK gene [<a href=\"#bib133\">Takemaru et al., 1995</a>]). It has long been recognized that many ciliate IESs contain transposable elements (TEs) and/or their remnants and hypothesized that their elimination is a form of MAC genome self-defense (<a href=\"#bib79\">Klobutcher and Herrick, 1997</a>). In both <i>Tetrahymena</i> and <i>Paramecium</i>, IES elimination requires the action of proteins domesticated from piggyBac transposases (<a href=\"#bib13\">Baudry et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Cheng et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib124\">Shieh and Chalker, 2013</a>), as well as proteins and histone modifications associated with epigenetic TE silencing in other organisms (<a href=\"#bib29\">Chalker et al., 2013</a>). In <i>Oxytricha</i>, germline-limited transposons mediate their own excision and also contribute to other programmed rearrangement events (<a href=\"#bib105\">Nowacki et al., 2009</a>). The evolutionary origins of chromosome fragmentation are less clear, but, at least in <i>Tetrahymena</i>, features of Cbs suggest a possible link to mobile elements ([<a href=\"#bib5\">Ashlock et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Fan and Yao, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Hamilton et al., 2006b</a>] and this study).

Here, we report the sequencing, assembly, and analysis of the 157 Mb MIC genome of <i>T. thermophila</i> strain SB210, the same strain whose 103 Mb MAC genome sequence we have previously characterized (<a href=\"#bib37\">Coyne et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Eisen et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Hamilton et al., 2006a</a>). We constructed full-length super-assemblies of all five MIC chromosomes, providing a unique resource for ciliate genome analysis. By mapping a set of germline deletions against these super-assemblies, we delimited the locations of the five MIC centromeres. We mapped 225 instances of the Cbs, which define the ends of all 181 stably maintained MAC chromosomes as well as several short-lived, \u2018Non-Maintained Chromosomes\u2019 (NMCs), some of which contain a number of active genes. Additionally, we report multiple cases of short and long-range Cbs duplications in <i>T. thermophila</i> and the conservation of Cbs sequence and location in three other <i>Tetrahymena</i> species. We showed that approximately one third (54 Mb) of the MIC genome is eliminated in the form of around 12,000 IESs, and mapped the precise locations of over 7500, revealing their enrichment at the centers and ends of MIC chromosomes. Our comparative analysis of MIC-limited TEs shows that the majority are related to DNA (Class 2) transposons from a variety of families and suggests multiple invasions of the genome and potentially recent transpositional activity. We analyzed IES junctions and excision variability genome-wide, greatly extending previous reports of their imprecision (e.g. [<a href=\"#bib6\">Austerberry et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib88\">Li\u00a0and\u00a0Pearlman, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib142\">Wells et al., 1994</a>]), and yet we also report a very limited number of unusual, precisely excised IESs that interrupt protein-coding regions. Our results provide the first genome-wide picture of programmed DNA rearrangements in <i>T. thermophila</i>, and support a view of the germline genome as a complex and dynamic entity, on both developmental and evolutionary timescales."

The final assembly is 157 Mb in length and composed of 1464 scaffolds, whereas the MAC genome assembly is 103 Mb and contains 1158 scaffolds. To fully understand the inter-relationship of the MAC and MIC genomes, it is essential to join the scaffolds of each separate assembly into complete MAC and MIC chromosomes. Extensive genome closure and HAPPY mapping efforts have produced super-assemblies of every MAC chromosome ([<a href=\"#bib37\">Coyne et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Hamilton et al., 2006a</a>]; <a href=\"#SD5-data\">Supplementary file 1B</a>) but considerable uncertainty remains as to scaffold placement and/or orientation on several chromosomes. Likewise, although genetic mapping can assign some MAC chromosomes/scaffolds to locations on one of the five MIC chromosomes, their order and orientation can be hard to determine. By a MIC-MAC cross-alignment \u2018tiling\u2019 method (described in Materials and methods and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), we used each assembly to improve the other. By this process, most of the larger MIC scaffolds were linked into five chromosome-length super-assemblies that together incorporate 152 Mb of the total 157 Mb MIC assembly (<a href=\"#SD5-data\">Supplementary file 1C,D</a>; also see \u2018MIC-scaff\u2019 and corresponding \u2018MAC-scaff\u2019 schematic concatenations in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). While the super-assemblies are admittedly not perfect, their uncertainties are on a small scale, and thus the maps allow observations of general trends in MIC chromosome architecture. To our knowledge, these are the first assemblies of nearly full-length ciliate MIC chromosomes and thus represent novel resources for genomic analyses. We have incorporated them into a browser (<a href=\"http://www.jcvi.org/jbrowse/?data=tta2mic\">http://www.jcvi.org/jbrowse/?data=tta2mic</a>) that relates the MIC and MAC genomes and includes many other features described below."

We mapped the extent of the deletions relative to Cbs\u2019s spread along the length of each MIC chromosome. The figure shows mapping of Chromosome 5 deletions as a representative example. The extents of left arm deletions are indicated by orange lines; right arm deletions by blue lines. Six independent deletions removed all the Cbs\u2019s on the left arm while three others removed all the Cbs\u2019s on the right arm (the precise endpoints have not yet been mapped, as indicated by the dotted line termini).

We plotted the densities along each MIC chromosome of both simple sequence repeats (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, purple lines) and putative TEs and their remnants (blue lines; see below for a description of TE characterization) and found that both types of repetitive sequence are more prevalent in the putative centromeric regions than in the chromosome arms. These observations of large, repeat-rich centromeric regions are consistent with the 'meiotic drive' hypothesis (<a href=\"#bib45\">Elde et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib93\">Malik and Henikoff, 2002</a>, <a href=\"#bib94\">2009</a>)\u2014that in organisms, such as <i>Tetrahymena</i>, that undergo exclusively female meiosis (in which only one of the four meiotic products becomes a gamete), competition between sister chromosomes for transmission during meiosis will result in rapid evolution and expansion of centromeric sequences."

The close, linear packing of MAC chromosome precursors along the entire length of MIC chromosomes and the presence of retained, macronuclear-destined sequences (MDSs) interspersed throughout the <i>Tetrahymena</i> centromere regions suggests that IES removal is sufficient to account for this centromere loss. In <i>Paramecium</i>, IESs found in MIC regions that give rise to MAC chromosomes are generally very short and non-repetitive (<a href=\"#bib4\">Arnaiz et al., 2012</a>), thus not resembling typical centromeric DNA. However, these regions are separated by large (and as yet unassembled) blocks of repetitive DNA (<a href=\"#bib4\">Arnaiz et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Le Mou\u00ebl et al., 2003</a>), which seem more likely to represent centromeres. Centromeric histone H3 also disappears during MAC differentiation in <i>Paramecium</i>, and this disappearance is dependent on factors required for IES excision (<a href=\"#bib86\">Lhuillier-Akakpo et al., 2016</a>), suggesting that the centromeres of both organisms, despite their apparent dissimilarities, are eliminated as IESs."

Among these organisms, many details of the process differ markedly (<a href=\"#bib3\">Amar, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Baird and Klobutcher, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Caron, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Duret et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Forney and Blackburn, 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Herrick et al., 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Le Mou\u00ebl et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib123\">Scott et al., 1993</a>). <i>Tetrahymena</i> carries out chromosome breakage and telomere addition with high specificity and reliability. In <i>T. thermophila</i> and related species (<a href=\"#bib38\">Coyne and Yao, 1996</a>), these processes are driven by the necessary and sufficient cis-acting DNA element, Cbs (Chromosome breakage sequence), a highly conserved 15-mer (<a href=\"#bib48\">Fan and Yao, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Hamilton et al., 2006b</a>; <a href=\"#bib151\">Yao et al., 1990</a>).

Positioning this complete set of breakage signals on the MIC chromosome super-assemblies makes <i>T. thermophila</i> the first ciliate in which the complete linear relationship between MIC and MAC chromosomes has been defined (see \u2018Super-Asm\u2019 schematic in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). As expected, the majority of MAC chromosomes are generated by cleavage at Cbs's that are consecutively spaced along MIC chromosomes. However, we identified seven complex MAC chromosomes that are generated not simply by conventional fragmentation, but also by the site-specific joining of non-contiguous segments of germline DNA. The non-contiguity has been experimentally confirmed for three cases, eliminating the possibility that they are genome assembly artifacts. The formation of these complex chromosomes is currently under investigation and will be reported in detail separately. The rearrangement events have been accounted for in the MIC/MAC comparative genome browser described above (<a href=\"http://www.jcvi.org/jbrowse/?data=tta2mic\">http://www.jcvi.org/jbrowse/?data=tta2mic</a>)."

Pot2p is the first factor shown to associate specifically with Cbs regions in vivo, at the time of chromosome breakage (<a href=\"#bib39\">Cranert et al., 2014</a>). Pot2p is a paralog of Pot1p, which is required for telomere maintenance. Pot2p may recruit factor(s) required for chromosome breakage and/or de novo telomere addition. As previously noted for the consensus sequence (<a href=\"#bib152\">Yao et al., 1987</a>), every functional Cbs contains a permuted copy (C<sub>2</sub>A<sub>2</sub>C<sub>2</sub>) of the <i>T. thermophila</i> telomeric repeat C<sub>4</sub>A<sub>2</sub>. More generally, the Cbs consensus shares with <i>Tetrahymena</i> telomeric repeats a striking C vs. G strand asymmetry; of the 117 non-consensus functional Cbs sequences, only one contains a substitution on the C-rich strand to a G (at position 13) whereas 27 contain a substitution to C (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). The likelihood of this ratio being due to chance alone is low (probability of chi square\u00a0&lt;&lt;\u00a00.01). Whether these sequence parallels between Cbs and telomeres are coincidental or related to Cbs function may be established when the mechanisms of chromosome breakage and telomere addition are better understood."

Earlier studies of this group (<a href=\"#bib38\">Coyne and Yao, 1996</a>) showed strong evolutionary conservation of the Cbs sequence, but only one or two Cbs's per species were sequenced. To examine the evolutionary conservation of Cbs sequences and their locations within the germline genome, we conducted a pilot study of 12 consecutive breakage site locations in <i>T. thermophila</i> and three other <i>Tetrahymena</i> species, using the strategy described in Materials and methods (a more comprehensive study will be published separately). Strikingly, MAC chromosome ends were highly conserved in all four species, indicating strong conservation of breakage sites. Indeed, with just one exception in <i>T. borealis</i>, the location of every chromosome breakage site in the four species has remained identical since their divergence, down to the MIC genome interval between the same two consecutive homologous genes (<a href=\"#SD6-data\">Supplementary file 2C</a>). The only detected differences are the deletion of DNA sequences surrounding <i>T. borealis</i> Cbs 3L-25 and a novel breakage site in <i>T. malaccensis</i>, between Cbs 3L-24 and 3L-25 (numbered according to <i>T. thermophila</i>). MAC chromosome lengths in this region are also strongly conserved among all four species (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, <a href=\"#SD6-data\">Supplementary file 2D</a>)."

No previously unidentified Cbs variants were observed in the 26 sequenced Cbs's (which include four locally duplicated Cbs's, see below). Importantly, there was consistency in the specific Cbs isoform found at a given breakage site in all four species, as expected if they represent a clade descended from a common ancestral Cbs at that site (see <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). This conclusion is further supported by the observation that Cbs\u2019s at a given homologous breakage site display the same orientation with respect to MAC-retained flanking regions, with the single exception of <i>T. borealis</i> Cbs 3L-22 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B and C</a>). In contrast to the conservation of the Cbs itself, there is little or no conservation of the 200 bp of adjacent sequence (not shown). Assuming the most parsimonious number of mutations to explain the Cbs variants observed at these nine homologous breakage sites, the rate of fixation of functional Cbs mutations is low; 11 mutations can account for all the Cbs variation observed at 31 independently sequenced sites (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>).

Further speculations on the possible nature of such selection are presented in the Appendix. The conservation of Cbs locations, and consequently the lengths of MAC chromosomes, is quite remarkable in contrast to the extremely variable locations of IESs, even in <i>T. malaccensis</i>, the species most closely related to <i>T. thermophila</i> (<a href=\"#bib74\">Huvos, 2007</a>)."

There are also reported cases of inter-species Cbs inversions (above and [<a href=\"#bib38\">Coyne and Yao, 1996</a>]). Further analyses of such events may shed light on aspects of Cbs evolutionary history. We searched for Cbs-associated germline rearrangements genome-wide and identified a large number of both local, tandem repeat duplications and long-range duplications/translocations (<a href=\"#SD6-data\">Supplementary file 2E</a>; summarized in <a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>). Forty-nine Cbs-containing segments (23% of the 225) have at least one duplicate in the MIC genome. Evidence for an earlier duplication/translocation of the entire rDNA locus, including flanking Cbs\u2019s, is described in the Appendix. This high frequency of Cbs-associated germline rearrangements supports the previous suggestion (<a href=\"#bib38\">Coyne and Yao, 1996</a>) that some mechanism increases the likelihood of such events in the vicinity of Cbs, perhaps as a result of occasional missorting of the chromosome breakage machinery to the germline nucleus. Tandem repeat duplications appear concentrated within and at the margins of putative centromeres, perhaps reflecting an increased tendency of that chromatin domain to engage in such illegitimate recombination events, or a higher tolerance for their consequences."

Long-range duplications result in widely separated duplicate Cbs pairs, on either the same or different MIC chromosomes. Such events would increase the maintained chromosome number (unless translocation occurs to the neighborhood of a pre-existing Cbs). As an example noted above, a novel breakage site in <i>T. borealis</i> was possibly introduced by long-range duplication. More complete analysis of MAC synteny among several <i>Tetrahymena</i> species, revealing genome-wide patterns of chromosome breakage conservation, will be presented separately. Future availability of MIC genome assemblies of these species will allow greater understanding of the frequency and consequences of long-range Cbs duplications."

Some of these events probably occurred fairly recently, judging by the high-sequence identity of the Cbs-flanking regions. Within 14 out of 15 clades, members either have the same Cbs isoform (seven clades) or differ by a single substitution (seven clades). At least two mutations are required to explain the variation within the remaining clade. The doubly substituted 11C,13A Cbs is a relatively rare isoform found in more than one clade, suggesting they may form a \u2018super-clade\u2019. Further observations on Cbs duplication, including evidence for at least one, and possibly two, super-clades, and a model of Cbs-mediated chromosome breakage evolution are presented in the Appendix. By back-extrapolation, the identification of clades and possible superclades supports the suggestion that all current Cbs's are derived from one, or a few, founder copies present in a tetrahymenine ancestor. As described above, this founding event may have resulted from the invasion of the germline genome by a mobile element, followed by the domestication of an element-encoded gene to take over the mechanism of chromosome breakage from a pre-existing, less precise mechanism, such as that which persists in <i>Paramecium</i>."

A number of developmental events occur during this interval, including programmed genome rearrangement, the establishment of MAC chromosome copy number (<a href=\"#bib41\">Doerder and DeBault, 1978</a>), and the transition from sexual immaturity to maturity (<a href=\"#bib15\">Bleyman and Simon, 1967</a>; <a href=\"#bib117\">Rogers and Karrer, 1985</a>). Because NMCs may play a role in these events, or serve as a model for their study, we undertook a genome-wide survey to identify more candidate NMCs and examine their properties. Using our MIC chromosome super-assemblies, we identified a total of 33 NMCs (<a href=\"#SD6-data\">Supplementary file 2F</a>), operationally defined as MIC DNA segments delimited by two consecutive Cbs\u2019s and absent from the MAC genome assembly."

We identified 47 predicted genes, distributed among 10\u00a0NMCs (<a href=\"#SD6-data\">Supplementary file 2G</a>). Some of them are homologous to genes found in the MIC-limited TEs REP and Tlr (<a href=\"#bib51\">Fillingham et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib143\">Wuitschick et al., 2002</a>), and others were annotated as transposases; therefore, the regions bearing these genes are likely recognized by the mechanism for IES removal and may, in fact, be processed as such, even though their flanking regions are not retained in the mature MAC. Nonetheless, RNA-seq evidence suggests that some NMC genes are expressed (see <a href=\"#SD6-data\">Supplementary file 2G</a>) and may give rise to protein products that function during late conjugation and/or subsequent vegetative multiplication, until the NMCs are lost. For example, the five predicted genes with annotated transposase domains (one a piggyBac transposase, related to the domesticated transposase required for IES excision) may be involved in programmed somatic genome rearrangement (see below). The existence of expressed genes in transiently maintained NMCs may provide a novel mechanism for developmental gene regulation."

We demonstrated that, in exconjugants at 24 hr post-mixing, all 20 NMCs longer than 1 kb have acquired telomeres (data not shown). Thus, telomere addition is not sufficient to fully stabilize these chromosomes. Moreover, whole genome sequencing data (not shown) from 24 hr exconjugants shows that all of the 13 largest NMCs (the only ones with sufficient read density for this determination) undergo developmental DNA endoduplication in concert with maintained MAC chromosomes, but it is currently unknown how rapidly NMC copy numbers decrease subsequently. The eventual loss of NMCs may result from the wide spacing of replication origins in the <i>Tetrahymena</i> genome. A recent study (<a href=\"#bib56\">Gao et al., 2013</a>) identified roughly 7000 DNA segments that likely represent MAC DNA replication origins, an average of one per 15 kb, which corresponds to about 22.5 kb in the MIC genome, after adjusting for the average genome-wide IES fraction; only three NMCs are larger than this size. By contrast, in spirotrichous ciliates, a run-away evolutionary process, consistent with in silico predictions (<a href=\"#bib100\">Morgens et al., 2013</a>), has led to extreme MAC chromosome fragmentation -- down to gene-sized \u2018nanochromosomes\u2019. This outcome was enabled by the evolution of independent DNA replication origins in association with nearly every gene in these ciliates. A lower origin density may have precluded such extreme chromosome fragmentation in <i>Tetrahymena</i>."

Recent Cbs duplication appears to be intimately connected to the evolutionary origin of most currently observed NMCs; roughly 80% (26/33) of NMCs have Cbs's from the same clade on both sides (<a href=\"#SD6-data\">Supplementary file 2F</a>). More than a third (13/33) of NMCs are short (1 kb or less) and contain no predicted genes; they likely have transient evolutionary existence, as their flanking, tandemly repeated Cbs\u2019s are functionally redundant and mutations are statistically almost certain to eventually inactivate one of the flanking Cbs\u2019s without penalty. However, it is possible that some very short NMCs could be maintained by selection if a defective Cbs near a newly broken end interfered with de novo telomere addition. Potentially, more interesting from an evolutionary perspective are the longer NMCs. A duplicated and translocated Cbs would have split a MAC chromosome into two fragments. The smaller one would become an NMC if it lacked cis-acting elements required for normal MAC chromosome maintenance. The resulting progeny would be viable if the NMC carried no genes essential for long-term vegetative multiplication. Over time, some of these developmentally short-lived MAC genes could undergo neo-functionalization for roles limited to post-zygotic and/or early post-conjugational development. Such NMC\u2019s likely would have greater longevity on an evolutionary time scale."

These results were confirmed by alignment of MIC sequencing reads to the MAC genome assembly (see <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). (<b>A</b>) TDR length. Numbers of junctions with TDRs of the indicated lengths, showing that IESs with no TDR constitute the largest class. (<b>B</b>) A+T richness. For each of the five TDR classes between 0 and 4 bp, the direct repeat (or two flanking bases, in the case of no overlap) plus six bases on either side were extracted from the MIC genome sequence and aligned (MAC-destined sequence to the left; MIC-limited sequence to the right). Each arrow indicates the center of the TDR (or, in the case of No TDR, the junction point). Sequence logos derived from the alignments show that the TDRs are more AT-rich than surrounding sequence. Bases within the four, three, and two base direct repeats are approximately 97% AT overall and the one base direct repeats are 92% AT, whereas the two bases flanking the 'zero overlap' junctions are 80% AT, similar to the adjacent sequence composition. (<b>C</b>) Sequence pattern bias. In addition to overall AT-richness, the sequence patterns of the TDRs are not entirely random. We compared the frequency of each of the possible TDRs between 2 and 4 bp in length that consist of only As and Ts. Reverse complementary sequences were found to have approximately equal frequencies, as expected because the orientation of the sequenced strand is random, and they were grouped together. This makes for 10 groupings of 4 bp TDRs, 4 groupings of 3 bp TDRs, and 3 groupings of 2 bp TDRs. As shown in this panel, the frequencies of each grouping are unequal; the most common are: 4-mer TTAA (palindromic), 3-mer TTA/TAA, and 2-mer TT/AA (the latter two are pairs of reverse complementary sequences). Furthermore, it is notable that the four most common groupings of 4-mers all contain one member with a 5' TT dinucleotide (red font) and together account for two thirds of the total 4-mers. Likewise, the two (out of four total) 3-mer groupings containing a 5' TT dinucleotide account for two thirds of 3-mers, and the single TT/AA 2-mer grouping accounts for over three quarters of all 2-mers. These findings suggest that IES junctions have a slight bias in favor of beginning with TT and an extended weak consensus of 5'-TT(A)(A)\u22123', the most common 2, 3, and 4 bp TDRs (but far from the majority) including successively more of the consensus, from left to right."

The MIC-limited regions of other ciliates also contain many TEs and TE-related sequences, supporting the hypothesis that programmed DNA elimination acts as a form of self-defense against genomic parasites (<a href=\"#bib36\">Coyne et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Klobutcher and Herrick, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib138\">Vogt et al., 2013</a>). Thus, we analyzed our MIC genome assembly to determine the extent to which IESs are related to TEs and the nature of these relationships. This annotation revealed that putative TEs and their remnants make up approximately 18.6 Mb (12.6%) of the total MIC genome assembly, and 10.9 Mb (41.7%) of the high-confidence IES set (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 6\u2014source data 1</a>, <a href=\"#SD3-data\">2</a> and <a href=\"#SD4-data\">3</a>, <a href=\"#SD7-data\">Supplementary files 3B, 3C</a>). It is likely that an even higher proportion of IES sequences are ancestrally related to TEs, but have diverged too greatly for this relatedness to be detected using our criteria. Although 95% of putative TE sequences are removed through IES excision during the development of the new MAC, about 1 Mb of putative TE sequences appear to be retained in the MAC (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>; <a href=\"#SD7-data\">Supplementary file 3C</a>). In some instances, we noticed a retention bias toward the terminal regions of the consensus of manually curated TE sequences (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This suggests that sometimes the removal of TE sequences by IES excision is incomplete, leaving terminal sequences in the MAC."

As expected, virtually all the high-confidence IESs are removed from predicted intergenic (6182, 82%) and intronic (1168, 16%) regions, where imprecise excision would not cripple gene function. The remaining 2% mapped within putatively protein-coding gene sequences, but on closer inspection, most of these cases represent apparent annotation errors.

We observe the reverse pattern on chromosome arms (although for unknown reasons, Chromosome 2 arms display higher IES density and correspondingly lower gene density than the other four). These results are consistent with the fact that shorter MIC scaffolds predominate at the middle and the ends of the MIC chromosomes, presumably because repetitive sequences in these regions make them difficult to assemble. The central regions, spanning approximately 7 to 12 Mb or about one quarter to one third of the chromosome lengths, share essentially the same range as the repeat-rich putative centromeric regions identified above. Thus, although <i>Tetrahymena</i> germline chromosomes are transcriptionally silent and carry dispersed elements destined for programmed elimination from the somatic genome, the general abundance of repetitive sequences and scarcity of genes in pericentromeric and sub-telomeric regions is similar to that observed in other eukaryotes (<a href=\"#bib112\">Plohl et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib115\">Pryde et al., 1997</a>)."

We previously reported (<a href=\"#bib102\">Noto et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib121\">Schoeberl et al., 2012</a>) the existence of two distinct classes of scnRNAs, present at different stages of <i>Tetrahymena</i> conjugation. Early-scnRNAs recognize not just the IESs they stem from, but other IESs in trans. Early-scnRNAs also induce the production of Late-scnRNAs, and both types are cooperatively involved in DNA elimination (<a href=\"#bib102\">Noto et al., 2015</a>). Early-scnRNAs are produced primarily from shorter MIC scaffolds, whereas Late-scnRNAs originate from both large and small MIC scaffolds, but the locations of these scaffolds on MIC chromosomes was previously unknown. We found that, whereas Late-scnRNAs originate from locations throughout the MIC chromosomes (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>), Early-scnRNA primarily map to the middle and end regions (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). The increased number of IESs in these regions (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>) does not fully explain this phenomenon, because many IESs are located within chromosomal arm regions, but most do not give rise to Early-scnRNAs.

Despite this shortening, there are relatively few documented cases of IES loss in <i>Paramecium</i> (<a href=\"#bib4\">Arnaiz et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Catania et al., 2013</a>). In contrast, in the few cases studied, <i>Tetrahymena</i> IES positions appear to be highly variable between species, even those most closely related (<a href=\"#bib73\">Huvos, 1995</a>, <a href=\"#bib74\">2007</a>). We hypothesize that <i>Tetrahymena</i> IESs proliferate in the MIC genome by TE movement (which our results suggest to be an ongoing process fueled by multiple invasions of diverse TEs), selectively constrained by the imprecise IES excision mechanism to intergenic and intronic positions. Unlike in <i>Paramecium</i>, there is not strong selection for a reduction in IES size. As <i>Tetrahymena</i> TE sequences gradually degenerate (and in the absence of both a precise excision mechanism and selective constraint on the precision of excision), the boundaries of IES removal shift, giving rise to the observed inter-species variability. Still, the small-RNA-mediated trans recognition network we have previously described and further refined above ensures that the overall pattern of IES excision is robust and reproducible from one sexual generation to the next. Because of the whole genome MIC/MAC comparison step in DNA elimination, this robustness is most likely necessary to avoid a complete breakdown in reproducibility, an event that might lead to reproductive isolation and speciation."

Previous small-scale studies have shown that breakpoints do not share a strong consensus sequence and display frequent heterogeneity (<a href=\"#bib6\">Austerberry et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib88\">Li\u00a0and\u00a0Pearlman, 1996</a>). In some cases, IESs have short terminal direct repeats (TDRs) at their ends, one repeat remaining in the MAC following excision. The domesticated <i>piggyBac</i> transposase Tpb2p, required in vivo for IES excision, can introduce breaks in vitro of the expected geometry, and with a relaxed sequence preference (<a href=\"#bib33\">Cheng et al., 2010</a>). To shed further light on this process, we examined thousands of additional IES junctions and conducted a genome-wide study of excision variability (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>)."

We aligned the sequencing reads to SB210 MIC scaffolds (as in <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) to identify excision endpoints from multiple independent rearrangement events. Quantifying the degree of endpoint variation in a progeny pool depends on the experimental setup as well as the choice of validation criteria (as described in <a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3</a> legend), making it hard to assign precise values. Nevertheless, even using conservative validation criteria, the great majority of IES sites exhibited variability, with up to 14 different junctions per site (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>). Even for IESs that at first appeared to have no, or exceptionally low, variability, closer visual inspection of alignment data revealed that nearly all exhibited some endpoint variability. The scnRNA-mediated genome rearrangement mechanism involves whole genome comparison of the parental and newly developing MACs, with the state of the pre-rearranged parental genome influencing events in the progeny in a locus-specific manner (<a href=\"#bib98\">Mochizuki and Gorovsky, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib148\">Yao and Chao, 2005</a>). Therefore, we examined the relationship of progeny to parental IES excision endpoints. Progeny endpoints were most often identical to those of the parent (26.6%), with most variations (83.3%) falling within 20 bp of the parental position (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>). This observation is consistent with the proposal that cis-acting \u2018boundary elements\u2019 act to prevent the spread of chromatin marks specific to MIC-limited sequences (<a href=\"#bib28\">Chalker et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Godiska et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib118\">Li\u00a0and\u00a0Pearlman, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib110\">Patil and Karrer, 2000</a>). The progeny endpoint distribution shows a small spike at a distance of 4 bp from the parental endpoint. This would be consistent with the use of the same breakpoint, followed by differential repair of the four base overhang generated by Tpb2p, using either the 'right' or 'left' overhang as template."

We propose three testable hypotheses: first, this particular terminal sequence may allow these IESs to be processed by Tpb2p with unusually high fidelity. Second, an additional trans-acting factor may increase Tpb2p's specificity for these IES junctions. Finally, precise excision of these IESs may rely on one of the other p<i>iggyBac</i> transposase homologs identified in the <i>Tetrahymena</i> genome (<a href=\"#bib33\">Cheng et al., 2010</a>), one of which we have shown resides on a NMC (see above) and is expressed during conjugation."

It was suggested, in the case of the LIA2 coding region IES (<a href=\"#bib49\">Fass et al., 2011</a>), that its excision may represent a novel form of gene regulation, turning on or off expression or allowing the expression of different protein products before and after rearrangement. We note that the five genes containing coding region IESs share certain intriguing features, suggesting that such regulation could serve relevant function(s) (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). The expression of all five is conjugation-specific (<a href=\"#bib97\">Miao et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib144\">Xiong et al., 2012</a>), peaking at approximately the same time point (8\u201310 hr post-mixing; <a href=\"http://tfgd.ihb.ac.cn/\">http://tfgd.ihb.ac.cn/</a>), near the time of IES excision. In addition, the predicted protein sequences contain functional domains of potential relevance to the regulation of gene function and/or MAC development, including zinc finger, bromodomain, and DEAD-DEAH helicase (Lia2p). Perhaps, the emergence of an efficient yet imprecise excision mechanism in <i>Tetrahymena</i>, based primarily on the epigenetic scnRNA mechanism to identify IESs and determine their boundaries, has driven selection against almost all coding region IESs that existed in a common ancestor of <i>Tetrahymena</i> and <i>Paramecium</i>, with the few remaining <i>Tetrahymena</i> cases persisting for gene regulatory purposes. Future studies of these five genes and six IESs will test this hypothesis."

Consistent with the deep evolutionary branching of the phylum (<a href=\"#bib11\">Baroin-Tourancheau et al., 1992</a>), comparisons between <i>Tetrahymena</i>, <i>Paramecium</i>, and <i>Oxytricha</i> reveals the extraordinary diversity and adaptability of ciliate germline/soma nuclear differentiation. Further comparative germline genomic analyses, including additional species closely related to the model organisms <i>T. thermophila</i>, <i>P. tetraurelia</i>, and <i>O. trifallax</i>, will help elucidate further details of this remarkable process. Because genome-wide DNA elimination occurs in phylogenetically diverse eukaryotes and is mechanistically related to nearly universal chromosomal functions mediated by small RNAs, the implications of this area of research are expected to be wide-ranging. The genome sequence, super-assemblies, and analyses presented here provide valuable information and resources for future investigations of programmed genome rearrangement and the relationship between chromosome structure and function in germline and somatic nuclei."

We found evidence suggesting a number of cases of MIC scaffold mis-assembly (<a href=\"#SD5-data\">Supplementary file 1D</a>), but only two cases of MAC scaffold mis-assembly.

In four cases, the segments contained two or three Cbs\u2019s, as adjacent Cbs were less than 400 bp apart. In such cases, we used a region that contained all such Cbs plus 200 bp flanking the outer Cbs\u2019s. We used two independent methods to align and cluster Cbs segments. In method 1, the 225 segments were aligned with one another in all pairwise combinations using the \u2018Align two sequences\u2019 option of NCBI Blast (<a href=\"http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi\">http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi</a>; RRID:<a href=\"https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_004870\">SCR_004870</a>). Default parameters were used with the following exceptions: word size\u00a0=\u00a07, low complexity filter = OFF, and expect value threshold\u00a0=\u00a01E-15 Word size was set to seven because every functional Cbs has nine consecutive, absolutely conserved nucleotides. This choice ensured catching every alignment, and thus all segmental duplications that included the Cbs. The low complexity filter was set to OFF because non-genic portions of the <i>T. thermophila</i> genome are highly A+T-biased (the entire set of Cbs-flanking 400 bp segments is 86.6% A+T). Setting the low complexity filter to ON generally reduced the alignment to a small number of nucleotides on either side of the Cbs sequence and increased by one order of magnitude the exponent of the expected value of the best alignments. The 1E-15 threshold was empirically chosen by comparing expect values for alignments of the set of 225 Cbs segments with each other and with sets of randomized sequences; using this expect value threshold reduced spurious alignments between real and randomized sequences to a modest number. Randomized sequences were obtained as follows. For each Cbs segment, the Cbs was kept intact, but the 200 bp of flanking sequence on each side were randomized, while retaining the nucleotide frequency of the original sequence. Three independent randomized sets were generated. The center Cbs was kept intact to make the simulation equivalent to the real analysis. This was necessary because inclusion of a 15 bp highly conserved Cbs sequence results in a spurious decrease in the expect value of the alignment between any pair of Cbs segments."

Smaller groups of the same sequences were used as \u2018query\u2019. We confirmed that the expect value of the alignment of a given Cbs region was not affected by how many Cbs segments were simultaneously used as query. Since we were interested in duplications that include the Cbs, alignments were considered only if Cbs\u2019s aligned with one another. In a minority of cases (involving 11 Cbs\u2019s), consecutive Cbs are less than 400 bp apart. Because of sequence overlaps in the 415 bp segments centered on such closely-spaced Cbs\u2019s, the resulting self-matches would spuriously inflate the statistical significance of certain alignments and could lead to meaningless clusters. To deal with this issue, the individual Cbs-containing repeat units of closely-spaced-Cbs segments were split into non-overlapping pieces based on preliminary alignments and aligned with the 225 Cbs segments. As a consequence, some of the Cbs segments were significantly shorter than 415 bp, which raises the minimum expect values of their alignments. Cbs segments that aligned with at least one other segment with expect value equal or less than 1E-18 were clustered. We chose this threshold to exclude most false positives, based on the distribution of expect values for all-by-all alignments of the real sequences to the corresponding distribution for randomized vs. real sequences."

All but one of the 11 MAC chromosomes derived from this region initially assembled from telomere to telomere, and therefore, the region is unlikely to contain many repetitive sequences. This region is located on MIC chromosome 3 and contains 12 consecutive Cbs (3L-26 to 3L-15). To locate the chromosome breakage sites and identify the <i>T. thermophila</i> MAC chromosome scaffolds derived from this region, the MAC scaffold database at the NCBI <i>T. thermophila</i> Nucleotide Blast page (<a href=\"http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PAGE_TYPE=BlastSearch&amp;PROG_DEF=blastn&amp;BLAST_PROG_DEF=megaBlast&amp;BLAST_SPEC=OGP__5911__12563\">http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PAGE_TYPE=BlastSearch&amp;PROG_DEF=blastn&amp;BLAST_PROG_DEF=megaBlast&amp;BLAST_SPEC=OGP__5911__12563</a>) was searched with the two MIC supercontigs.

Next, guided by the <i>T. thermophila</i> MIC chromosome 3 super-assembly, we constructed pseudo-assemblies of the homologous MIC chromosome segments for each of the other three species (called pseudoassemblies because they lack IES\u2019s, whose absence does not affect the connectivity of the MAC-destined sequences). Based on the assumption that these pseudoassemblies are colinear with the <i>T. thermophila</i> super-assemblies, we predicted the location of MIC Cbs. A more complete analysis of synteny between these and other <i>Tetrahymena</i> species will be presented in a later paper."

With one exception, PCR products were sequenced from both strands or from reactions with different primer combinations.

(<a href=\"#bib65\">Hamilton et al., 2005</a>). The presence of a single (or major) PCR product, consistent with the predicted product size, was taken as evidence for the presence of telomeres at that chromosome end.

By these criteria, we identified 29,794 simple repeats (constituting 2.9 Mb, or 1.9% of the MIC scaffold sequence, excluding Ns). However, this number is likely an underestimate of the overall MIC genome repeat content. Because of the numerous gaps in the MIC genome assembly, approximately 6.4% (constituting 10.0 Mb) consists of Ns. Because repeat-rich sequences are difficult to assemble, the unassembled parts of the genome are likely to contain many more repeats. By comparison, the MAC genome assembly, which is much more complete, contains far\u00a0fewer Ns. Using the same Tandem Repeat Finder parameters as for the MIC, we identified 22,216 simple sequence repeats (constituting 3.5 Mb, or 3.4% of the MAC assembly, excluding Ns). Although the number of repeats is lower in the MAC than the MIC, there were many longer repeats. Thus, as first described by <a href=\"#bib44\">Eisen et al.

An important criterion for inclusion in the high-confidence set is that the precise junction positions must be identified; internal assembly gaps are permitted, but gaps at IES/MDS junctions are not. In contrast to IES mapping method number one above, the other two mapping methods frequently identified putative IESs with terminal assembly gaps or, in many cases, consisting entirely of gap regions. These gaps are likely the result of two factors: (1) repetitive sequences within the IESs and (2) minor contamination of the MIC sequencing libraries with MAC DNA (the resulting mixture of inconsistent short reads at IES/MDS junctions causing the assembly algorithm to introduce 'breaks'). Nevertheless, manual curation indicates that IESs likely exist at the great majority of these sites. Each of the latter two methods identified about 12,000 IESs in total, twice the number previously estimated based on extrapolation from a highly limited subset (<a href=\"#bib149\">Yao et al., 1984</a>) or low-coverage MIC genome sequencing (<a href=\"#bib49\">Fass et al., 2011</a>)."

To build the latter, we used RepeatScout (<a href=\"#bib113\">Price et al., 2005</a>) (RRID:<a href=\"https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_014653\">SCR_014653</a>) with default parameters (&gt;3 copies) to generate consensus repeat sequences. Those with greater than 90% sequence identity and a minimum overlap of 100 bp were assembled using Sequencher (v 4.07; RRID:<a href=\"https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_001528\">SCR_001528</a>). Repeats were classified into TE families using multiple lines of evidence, including detection of conserved TE protein domains (<a href=\"#bib95\">Marchler-Bauer et al., 2011</a>), homology to known elements, presence of Terminal Inverted Repeats (TIRs), and detection of Target Site Duplications (TSDs). Homology-based evidence was obtained using RepeatMasker Protein Mask (<a href=\"#bib127\">Smit et al., 2015</a>) (RRID:<a href=\"https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_012954\">SCR_012954</a>), as well as the homology module of the TE classifying tool RepClass (<a href=\"#bib50\">Feschotte et al., 2009</a>) (RRID:<a href=\"https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_014654\">SCR_014654</a>). Repclass was also used to identify some of the signatures of transposable elements (TIRs, TSDs). We then eliminated non-TE repeats (simple repeats or gene families). First, consensus sequences were labeled as simple repeats or low complexity if 80% of their length could be annotated as such by RepeatMasker (masking of the library with the option \u2013noint; RRID:<a href=\"https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_012954\">SCR_012954</a>).

Two non-exclusive criteria were used to select sequences for manual annotation: highest genome coverage or lowest divergence between copies (e.g. potentially recently active elements), based on a preliminary repeat annotation of the genome with RepeatMasker. Presumably, because of the large size and complex structure of <i>Maverick</i>/Tlr elements (<a href=\"#bib114\">Pritham et al., 2007</a>), we could not identify any complete elements in the MIC assembly (the only copy that we could annotate within a unique scaffold was lacking some internal domains). Lastly, we further classified the remaining unclassified repeats (1480/1674), using a k-mer-based method and were able to assign classification for an additional 161 repeats. The use of this k-mer based tool (<a href=\"#bib53\">Flygare et al., 2016</a>) (RRID:<a href=\"https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_014655\">SCR_014655</a>; available at <a href=\"https://github.com/Yandell-Lab/taxonomer_0.5\">https://github.com/Yandell-Lab/taxonomer_0.5</a>) allowed us to test whether each copy of all unclassified repeats (query) could be classified as any copies of any classified repeats (database). The query's classification was updated to reflect the classification of the majority of its copies with significant scores. Repeats that showed inconsistent classification (such as DNA or LINE1 depending on copies) remained unclassified. Most repeats (1319) remain unclassified and may correspond to either TEs or to non-TE repeats: therefore, we refer to this custom library as putative TEs."

Gene models were updated using PASA and the RNAseq assemblies described above as well as approximately 60,000 previously generated, Sanger ESTs (<a href=\"#bib37\">Coyne et al., 2008</a>). Omissions and structural differences between the three models (the new and previous [<a href=\"#bib37\">Coyne et al., 2008</a>] JCVI annotations and the Broad Institute annotation) were assessed using GSAC (Gene Structure Annotation Comparison, unpublished), a JCVI in-house tool that evaluates coordinate differences between two gff3 (generic feature format version 3) files. Models present in either of the latter two annotations, but absent from the the new JCVI annotation, were evaluated and included in the final set if they met either of the following criteria: significant homology to a predicted gene in NCBI's non-redundant protein database (nr) or microarray evidence of transcription (<a href=\"#bib97\">Miao et al., 2009</a>). Manual annotation steps were performed to correct cases of gene model overlap on the same or opposite strand, to edit or add genes curated on TGD (<a href=\"http://www.ciliate.org\">www.ciliate.org</a>), and to correct translation of genes encoding selenocysteine-containing proteins (<a href=\"#bib37\">Coyne et al., 2008</a>). Ab initio models that were fewer than 50 codons in length and lacked support from transcriptomic, protein homology or domain evidence were deleted. Functional gene product names were assigned by implementation of a JCVI pipeline designed to weigh multiple sources of sequence evidence, select the best supported names, and homogenize nomenclature within paralogous families."

Both are whole-genome homozygous cell lines of <i>T. thermophila</i> inbred strain B (<a href=\"#bib1\">Allen and Gibson, 1973</a>). Many fissions after they last conjugated, both strains were subcloned from a single cell, ensuring that essentially every MAC locus has become homozygous through phenotypic assortment, eliminating parental MAC IES excision endpoint variation; our sequence analysis verified this prediction. Mating exconjugants were selected for resistance to cycloheximide (the allele for which is found in the MIC genome of SB1969 and only expressed in true progeny) in 96-well plates at a dilution that limited the number of independent resistant progeny pairs in each well to an average of two. After 3 days growth in cycloheximide, resistant cells from 330 wells were pooled. This pool contained the vegetative descendants of about 660 mating pairs, or 1320 individual progeny. In each progeny cell, two MACs develop and undergo programmed genome rearrangement; thus, the pool represents about 2640 independently derived MACs, but given that IES excision occurs when the MAC ploidy is about 8\u00b0C, the diversity of excision endpoints is potentially even greater. To expand the cell population for MAC DNA purification, the pooled cells were grown for approximately eight cell divisions in a large volume of medium to minimize competition. MACs from the progeny pool, as well as both parental strains, were purified by standard procedures (<a href=\"#bib59\">Gorovsky et al., 1975</a>) and DNA prepared from the nuclei. Illumina (San Diego, CA) sequencing libraries, with a fragment size of about 600 bp, were prepared from each DNA sample and sequenced (2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0100 base paired-end reads) using an Illumina HiSeq2000 instrument following manufacturer\u2019s recommendations.

Furthermore, the repeat length is very short and there are no predicted genes within these repeats. This raises the question of why this clade contains five Cbs\u2019s that have retained functionality when just one would suffice.

The matching segment in chromosome 4R includes one functional Cbs, 4R-25, as well as 381 bp which matches a segment at the 5\u2019 end of the MAC rDNA, including the 112 bp region containing the M-repeat copies and their non-palindromic spacer (see alignment and sequences in <a href=\"#SD8-data\">Supplementary file 4</a>, section A3). The duplicated/translocated sequence most likely had only 2 Cbs\u2019s at this end, as the expected value of a chance BlastN alignment further decreases by at least 4 orders of magnitude if the 45 bp 1L-17 repeat unit is deleted (data not shown). Given the nearly complete sequence identity of the Cbs 1L-17 and 18 repeat units, it seems likely that they were generated by a more recent duplication than the 1L-4R duplication/translocation event. Cbs 4R-25 is probably homologous to Cbs 1L-19 because both share a 13A substitution. The 13A substitution is not seen in Cbs 1L-18 or the degenerate (non-functional) Cbs that occupies the corresponding location on 4R (compare the MIC sequences of the 5\u2019 rDNA region and the region including Cbs 4R-24 and 25). Remarkably, the sequence adjacent to the Cbs at the other (3\u2019) end of the rDNA sequence, Cbs 1L-16, matches the sequence adjacent to Cbs 4R-24, the nearest neighbor of Cbs 4R-25, separated from it by only 656 bp (see alignment of Cbs 4R-24 and 3\u2019 rDNA end and their sequences in <a href=\"#SD8-data\">Supplementary file 4</a>, section A3). The matching sequence includes 129 bp of sequence similar to the non-transcribed segment at the 3\u2019 end of the rRNA gene."

As can be seen in the sequence (<a href=\"#SD8-data\">Supplementary file 4</a>, section A3), the segments that match the rDNA 5\u2019 (dark gray) and 3\u2019 (light gray) ends are only 27 bp apart. If the duplication/translocation went from 1L to 4R, the probability of two independent duplications/translocations ending up 27 bp apart in a\u00a0&gt;150 Mb genome are remote. Conversely, if independent duplication/translocations went from 4R to 1L, and given that the M-repeats sequence is dispensable for the cell but their inverted deployment is required for rDNA palindrome formation, it is not easy to explain why both segments were in 4R, unless they already flanked a complete, functional copy of the rDNA. Consistent with the single translocation hypothesis, the homologous Cbs\u2019s have the same orientation with respect to one another and Cbs duplication-and-translocations to a different chromosome tend to be rarer than to the same chromosome (main text, <a href=\"#SD6-data\">Supplementary file 2E</a>)."

Subsequently, an internal segment, representing most of the rDNA, was deleted from the 4R copy. The excision site can be pinpointed to the 27 bp gap between the 5\u2019 and 3\u2019 matching segments in the sequence interval between Cbs\u2019s 4R-24 and 25 (see sequence in <a href=\"#SD8-data\">Supplementary file 4</a>, section A3). Since MAC rDNA palindrome copy number is regulated at nearly 10,000 copies per cell (<a href=\"#bib111\">Pearlman et al., 1979</a>), neither the putative rDNA gene duplication nor its subsequent deletion need have affected final rDNA copy number in the MAC. Furthermore, since a naturally occurring mutation can cause differential replication/maintenance of one allelic form and complete replacement of the other form in heterozygotes (<a href=\"#bib108\">Pan et al., 1982</a>), a redundant copy could readily become entirely superfluous."

It follows that this difference must have arisen after these two species lineages diverged from the <i>T. thermophila</i> lineage. The same must be true for the 1R-4R rDNA duplication described above, as Cbs 4R-24 shows the same orientation with respect to the remnants of the flanking rDNA homologous DNA sequence. Not enough MIC sequence is available from the two other species to determine if the resulting inversion was an \u2018in situ\u2019 inversion or whether some other duplicated Cbs was translocated to the sequence adjoining the rDNA 3\u2019end. Partial MIC sequences, adjacent to the 5\u2019 end of the rRNA gene, are available for two <i>Tetrahymena</i> species (<i>T. pigmentosa</i> and <i>T. hegewischi</i>) (<a href=\"#bib38\">Coyne and Yao, 1996</a>); no evidence of sequence similarity is observed in this region between these species and <i>thermophila</i>. By analogy to the 3\u2019 end Cbs, it seems very likely that the Cbs tandem repeat duplication in <i>thermophila</i> occurred after its divergence from the <i>pigmentosa</i> and <i>hegewischi</i> lineages."

Furthermore, there has been little divergence in the Cbs sequence itself within the tetrahymenine lineage (<a href=\"#bib38\">Coyne and Yao, 1996</a> and this study). It is therefore likely that the Cbs-mediated mechanism for chromosome breakage was introduced fairly recently into the tetrahymenine lineage, after its divergence from that of ciliates in closely related groups, such as <i>Paramecium</i>. Additional lines of evidence consistent with this view have been presented in main text. How could the Cbs-mediated mechanism have taken over an ancestral mechanism of chromosome breakage?"

The tetrahymenine branch diverged from ciliates that already had highly evolved MAC biology, including programmed chromosome breakage, and by inference, an ancestral chromosome breakage system already optimized by natural selection. This suggests that the spread of Cbs\u2019s may have been largely restricted to pre-existing breakage sites. In any case, rampant spread of breakage sites in the germline would certainly be deleterious to progeny survival. Transposons often display adaptations that avoid damaging host fitness; for example, the yeast Ty1 transposon inserts almost exclusively at \"safe\" sites upstream of promoters for RNA polymerase III-transcribed genes, by virtue of its targeting through association with a subunit of that enzyme (<a href=\"#bib19\">Bridier-Nahmias and Lesage, 2012</a>). It is conceivable that the invading Cbs mobile element was targeted to preexisting sites of chromosome breakage by association of its transposase with one of the recognition factors involved in that ancestral process. Of course, in order to be heritable, this targeting would need to occur in the germline, where breakage does not normally occur, but perhaps the putative association drew the complex from its normal site of action, in the macronuclear anlage, into the germline nucleus, much as an HIV pre-integration complex can traverse the interphase nuclear membrane (<a href=\"#bib20\">Bukrinsky, 2004</a>). Once in the micronucleus, mobile element integration at multiple pre-existing chromosome breakage sites might proceed (without resulting in germline chromosome breakage). In time, the Cbs endonuclease would be domesticated and all traces of the original mobile element, with the exception of the 15 bp Cbs, would degenerate by random mutation. Presuming a selective advantage for the highly precise and reliable Cbs-mediated breakage mechanism over the ancestral state, the new state would become fixed in the population."

It is notable that a homolog of a telomerase subunit, Pot2, was recently found to associate with chromosome breakage sites in <i>T. thermophila</i> (<a href=\"#bib39\">Cranert et al., 2014</a>). It may take part in the telomerase-dependent healing of the newly broken ends. Perhaps it may serve as the bait by which other components of the breakage complex may be identified. Alternatively, screening of homing endonuclease- and transposase-related genes in the <i>Tetrahymena</i> genome may trigger discovery of an association with programmed chromosome breakage."

It was suggested that this inverse correlation could be accounted for by biased gene conversion, indicating that MAC chromosomes could be proportional in size to MIC chromosome arms (since the MIC chromosomes are the ones undergoing meiotic recombination). More recently, work on Paramecium centromeres was published, so it would be wise to remove the speculative statement and refer only to the centromere paper. Moreover, I think that it is too soon to say that there is a fundamental difference in germline chromosome architecture at least as concerns centromeres, since it may turn out that centromeres are lost through each organism's usual IES elimination process."

Publishing our analysis of <i>Tetrahymena</i> IES sequences back-to-back with the current manuscript, as suggested by the reviewer, was our original intent. The <i>eLife</i> editors decided not to fully review the IES manuscript, as originally submitted, but offered the option of moving \u201ckey results\u201d into the first manuscript. Initially, we decided to move forward with full submission of the first manuscript, but after reading the reviews and consulting with Reviewing Editor Kathleen Collins, we decided to take the original advice and move key results on IES analysis into a comprehensive (but substantially condensed and thoroughly reorganized) manuscript on genome structure and rearrangement. The second suggestion was to incorporate the chromosomal deletion mapping data into this manuscript. The deletion mapping study has been a multi-year effort led Dr. Donna Cassidy-Hanley and involving many undergraduate researchers. Only a small subset of the deletions identified were informative about centromere locations. We are concerned that full publication of the methods and partial results from this effort would compromise the ability of Dr. Cassidy-Hanley and colleagues to publish the full story in a high quality journal and receive the attention and exposure that this story deserves. We do not feel that the omission of these detailed results detracts from our manuscript. However, we have included a new <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a> showing how a set of deletions were used to delimit the centromere region of Chromosome 5. The other centromeres were delimited in a similar fashion. We feel that this figure clarifies how the deletion analysis was performed, without compromising future publication of the entire study."

We have added text to the relevant section (Materials and methods in response to point #1) clarifying this issue.

We clearly acknowledge that some contamination exists, which is unavoidable given experimental constraints, but as stated in the first paragraph of the Materials and methods, \u201cBy microscopic counting of purified nuclei (taking into account the relative nuclear ploidy), we estimate that contamination with macronuclear genomic DNA was less than 2%\u201d. We are confident that this contamination did not significantly affect MIC genome assembly in any way that would affect the conclusions of this paper. Therefore, the text identified by the reviewer has been modified to explain the poor assembly of telomeric regions as being the result of their repetitive nature, as observed in the genome assemblies of many other organisms."

It was suggested that this inverse correlation could be accounted for by biased gene conversion, indicating that MAC chromosomes could be proportional in size to MIC chromosome arms (since the MIC chromosomes are the ones undergoing meiotic recombination). More recently, work on Paramecium centromeres was published, so it would be wise to remove the speculative statement and refer only to the centromere paper. Moreover, I think that it is too soon to say that there is a fundamental difference in germline chromosome architecture at least as concerns centromeres, since it may turn out that centromeres are lost through each organism's usual IES elimination process.</i>"

But the genome-wide frequencies (and associated bits of conservation) include coding sequence frequencies that have higher than average G+C content. Retaining the true conservation level of the non-coding Cbs-adjacent sequence provides a meaningful internal control. We prefer to retain the presentation of the conservation measurements in an assumption-free way, which does not, for example, give a distorted view of the difference in conservation between the T\u2019s at Cbs position 1 and 15."
