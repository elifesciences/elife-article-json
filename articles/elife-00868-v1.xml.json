In a multicellular context, <i>Myxococcus</i> cells can share outer membrane (OM) materials by an unknown mechanism involving the <i>traAB</i> genes and gliding motility. Using live imaging, we show for the first time that transient contacts between two cells are sufficient to transfer OM materials, proteins and lipids, at high efficiency. Transfer was associated with the formation of dynamic OM tubes, strongly suggesting that transfer results from the local fusion of the OMs of two transferring cells. Last, large amounts of OM materials were released in slime trails deposited by gliding cells. Since cells tend to follow trails laid by other cells, slime-driven OM material exchange may be an important stigmergic regulation of <i>Myxococcus</i> social behaviors."

In a multicellular context, <i>Myxococcus</i> cells can share outer membrane (OM) materials by an unknown mechanism involving the <i>traAB</i> genes and gliding motility. Using live imaging, we show for the first time that transient contacts between two cells are sufficient to transfer OM materials, proteins and lipids, at high efficiency. Transfer was associated with the formation of dynamic OM tubes, strongly suggesting that transfer results from the local fusion of the OMs of two transferring cells. Last, large amounts of OM materials were released in slime trails deposited by gliding cells. Since cells tend to follow trails laid by other cells, slime-driven OM material exchange may be an important stigmergic regulation of <i>Myxococcus</i> social behaviors."

Importantly, when cells that had swapped fluorescent membrane components moved apart, they appeared to remain connected by tubular structures, suggesting that an inter-membrane junction must form to allow proteins and lipids to be transferred between the cells. This junction is referred to as an outer-membrane synapse."

In particular, starvation triggers a developmental program where thousands of cells coordinate their motility, moving into aggregation centers to build multicellular fruiting bodies where the cells form metabolically-inert spores. This multicellular response requires an arsenal of intercellular signals, including diffusible long-range signals as well as contact-dependent signals (<a href=\"#bib10a\">Konovalova et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib12a\">Mauriello et al., 2009</a>). One intriguing cell\u2013cell communication mechanism involves the cell-to-cell transfer of outer membrane (OM) proteins between <i>Myxococcus</i> cells. This phenomenon was originally unmasked by mixing experiments where certain motility mutants were shown to rescue other motility mutants in a process called stimulation (<a href=\"#bib16\">Nudleman et al., 2005</a>). Stimulatable mutants all carried mutations in genes encoding predicted OM proteins (termed <i>cgl</i> or <i>tgl</i>). Experiments with the Tgl and the CglB OM lipoproteins suggested that stimulation is transient and does not involve the exchange of genetic material, but results from the physical transfer of Tgl/Cgl proteins from donor Tgl<sup>+</sup>/Cgl<sup>+</sup> cells to recipient Tgl<sup>\u2212</sup>/Cgl<sup>\u2212</sup> cells (<a href=\"#bib16\">Nudleman et al., 2005</a>)."

Gliding (A\u2212)motility has been shown to be important for transfer, but rather indirectly by promoting the formation of dense regions of aligned cells and favoring intimate cell\u2013cell contacts (<a href=\"#bib16\">Nudleman et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Pathak et al., 2012</a>). The transfer process itself depends on two specific proteins, TraA and TraB (<a href=\"#bib18\">Pathak et al., 2012</a>). TraA is a protein with hallmarks of yeast floculins, a class of cell surface adhesins that mediate cell\u2013cell interactions leading to flocculation (<a href=\"#bib23\">Smukalla et al., 2008</a>) and TraB is a secreted protein of unknown function with a possible peptidoglycan-binding domain. TraA and TraB must be expressed both by donor and recipient cells for transfer to occur. Consequently, Wall and colleagues proposed that when adjacent cells engage Tra-dependent surface interactions (i.e., homotypic interactions or interactions with other surface ligands), the OMs fuse locally and OM materials are exchanged (<a href=\"#bib26\">Wei et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Pathak et al., 2012</a>). However, because transfer was studied in bulk assays this hypothesis could not be tested directly. Therefore, other mechanisms remained possible, for example long-range exchange of OM vesicles or even local cell lysis. In this study, we investigated the transfer mechanism at the single cell level to gain more insights into the transfer mechanism."

However, no information was obtained about the increase in fluorescence intensity in the recipient cells. Thus, in a prelude to this study, we repeated the <a href=\"#bib26\">Wei et al. (2011)</a> experiment and further measured fluorescence fluctuations in recipient cells. For completion and to test the transfer of soluble periplasmic proteins, we also constructed a periplasmic probe, fusing mCherry to the <i>Escherichia coli phoA</i> signal sequence (PERI<sub>mCherry</sub>) (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019 and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Consistent with previous works and OM specific protein transfer, only OM<sub>mCherry</sub> was transferred significantly between cells. As observed by <a href=\"#bib26\">Wei et al.

Transfer remained active for the next 36 hr because although the total number of recipient cells became stable after 24 hr, the fluorescence intensity of recipient cells increased regularly until it reached a plateau at 36 hr (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). After 36 hr of co-incubation, 20% of the recipient cells displayed a high level of fluorescence, showing that some cells acquire exogenous OM content with very high efficiency (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). A low amount of PERI<sub>mCherry</sub> transfer was detected after 48 hr (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), suggesting that periplasmic proteins may also be exchanged but with a near background level efficiency. These findings confirm results from previous studies that transfer is a highly efficient OM-specific process."

Although most of the recipient cells are stained after 12 hr, the staining is generally weak and both brilliance and the fast-bleaching of mCherry prevented single cell transfer analysis with the OM<sub>mCherry</sub> probe. Therefore, to maximize our chances to observe a transfer event, we constructed a new probe where super-folder GFP (sfGFP), a fast folding bright variant of GFP (<a href=\"#bib19\">P\u00e9delacq et al., 2006</a>), is fused to the type II signal sequence (OM<sub>sfGFP</sub>). In a bulk transfer assay, OM<sub>sfGFP</sub> and OM<sub>mCherry</sub> were transferred with similar efficiencies, showing that OM<sub>sfGFP</sub> could be used in a single cell assay (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). To this aim, <i>Myxococcus</i> donor cells expressing OM<sub>sfGFP</sub> were mixed with recipient cells expressing IM<sub>mCherry,</sub> and the emergence of dual color cells was monitored over time by time-lapse fluorescence microscopy. As observed in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>, unlabeled recipient cells became fluorescent when they came in contact with OM<sub>sfGFP</sub> donor cells (<a href=\"#media1\">Videos 1,2</a>). Several lines of evidence argue that the observed fluorescence increase results from the physical transfer of OM<sub>sfGFP</sub>: (i), Fluorescence transfer was very rapid, approximately a third of the total donor fluorescence appeared in the recipient strain after 12 min of contact (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). (ii), Fluorescence initially appeared at the contact zone and subsequently diffused throughout the cell body (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Additionally, green fluorescence was enhanced at the recipient cell periphery, reflecting a membrane localization (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>).

While indeed a moderate decrease of sfGFP fluorescence is observed in the donor cell (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), the steepness of this decrease is likely compensated by the high level of newly synthesized OM<sub>sfGFP</sub> expressed from the strong pilin (<i>pilA)</i> promoter. To circumvent this limitation, we made use of the observation that lipids are also exchanged during transfer (<a href=\"#bib18\">Pathak et al., 2012</a>) and tested the transfer of DiO, a small C<sub>18</sub> backbone hydrophobic lipid dye that intercalates in lipid membranes. DiO-labelled cells contain a finite amount of DiO and given that it is highly diffusible, its dilution upon transfer should be obvious. Importantly, DiO-transfer is Tra-dependent (<a href=\"#bib18\">Pathak et al., 2012</a>) and thus its exchange between cells would also reflect the transfer dynamics. In a cell mixing experiment, DiO-stained cells were observed to transfer DiO to unlabeled cells upon physical contact (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,D</a>; <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>). In the example shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,D</a>, DiO-transfer is also observed to a third cell that is not immediately in contact with the DiO-donor cell but is adjacent to the first transferred cell. Remarkably, the fluorescence of the DiO-labeled cell decreased very rapidly, concomitant with the gradual increase of fluorescence in the adjacent unlabeled cells as if all three cells were connected like communicating vessels (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,D</a>). Transfer must require specific contacts (i.e., collision of TraA proteins) because unlabeled cells do not systematically acquire fluorescence when they establish a direct contact with a DiO-donor (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,D</a>; red contoured cell). In total, the OM<sub>sfGFP</sub> and the DiO-staining experiments strongly suggest that we were able to capture transfer events at the single cell level. Transfer can occur between more than two cells, potentially explaining why it is facilitated by cell\u2013cell alignment."

While imaging OM<sub>sfGFP</sub> expressing cells or DiO stained cells, we frequently observed tubular structures that appeared when two connected cells moved apart (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, <a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a>). These tubes were exclusively derived from the OM because they were only stained by sfGFP when observed in two-color cells expressing both OM<sub>sfGFP</sub> and IM<sub>mCherry</sub> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>).

                                "text": "Motile transferring cells may fuse their OMs locally, forming an \u2018OM synapse\u2019. If such synapses are not resolved when the cells physically separate due to motility, OM tubes would appear because of the tight physical connection. This would predict that tube formation is linked to the transfer mechanism. We first tested whether a tube and the cell OM are continuous. For this, we took advantage of the rapid diffusion of DiO and performed fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments targeting a tube connected to a single DiO<sup>+</sup> cell. DiO fluorescence showed a quick recovery, implying rapid exchange between the tube and the cell DiO pool (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>). We then aimed to capture tube formation between transferring cells. Since the tubes are relatively short lived, we also used DiO staining for these experiments. In the example shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a> and <a href=\"#media5\">Video 5</a>, DiO is exchanged upon contact between two cells, a tube becomes apparent when the cells move apart, strongly suggesting that tubes are formed between transferring cells. Last, if two cells linked by a tube have continuous OMs, they should exchange DiO, even if they are not immediately in contact. <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a> and <a href=\"#media6\">Video 6</a>, show a DiO-stained tube formed between a brightly fluorescent cell and a weakly fluorescent cell within a larger group of cells. Remarkably, in the cell with weak fluorescence, the level of fluorescence increased steadily as long as the tube connection was maintained, even though the two cells were not in immediate contact (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). When the tube was ruptured the fluorescence decreased due to photo-bleaching (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). Fluorescence transfer was strictly confined to the tube-connected cells and no fluorescent fluctuations were observed in the other cells of the group (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,D</a>). Thus, tubes allow the rapid exchange of DiO and must be continuous between two connected cells."

Cell alignment in densely packed <i>Myxococcus</i> swarms promotes cell-cell transfer, likely because it favors tight interactions between cells (<a href=\"#bib16\">Nudleman et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Wei et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Pathak et al., 2012</a>). However, Cryo-EM studies on the <i>Myxococcus</i> biofilm and our TEM and live observations of the lipid tubes also suggests that large amounts of OM materials may be released in the biofilm matrix, which may constitute a significant transfer reservoir (<a href=\"#bib17\">Palsdottir et al., 2009</a>). Interestingly, when we observed gliding cells on cellulose pre-coated EM grids (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019), we found that cells deposit vesicular/tubular material in their wake (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This material was also observed by fluorescence microscopy and must be derived from the OM because dual labeled OM<sub>sfGFP</sub>/IM<sub>mCherry</sub> cells deposited trails that were labeled with OM<sub>sfGFP</sub> but not with IM<sub>mCherry</sub> (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Gliding <i>Myxococcus</i> cells are known to deposit slime, a self-deposited sugar polymer of unknown composition that facilitates cell adhesion to the underlying substratum (<a href=\"#bib9\">Ducret et al., 2012</a>). The slime polymer can be detected selectively by addition of fluorescent Concanavalin A (ConA-FITC) in a microfluidic gliding assay (<a href=\"#bib9\">Ducret et al., 2012</a>). To test whether the OM materials are specifically associated with the deposited slime, we observed slime trails deposited by an OM<sub>mCherry</sub>-expressing strain in the presence of ConA-FITC. <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a> shows that such cells deposited numerous mCherry<sup>+</sup> dots and tubular structures that co-localized with ConA<sup>+</sup> trails. EM analysis using gold-labeled ConA confirmed that the deposited OM material is embedded in a sheath of slime polymer (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019 and <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). All together, these results suggest that gliding <i>Myxococcus</i> cells shed a significant amount of their OM during motility and that this material remains attached to the underlying slime polymer. Since gliding <i>Myxococcus</i> cells have long been known to follow trails left by other cells (<a href=\"#bib3\">Burchard, 1982</a>), a tantalizing possibility is that the transfer of OM materials could also occur when cells follow slime trails, harvesting vesicles and tubes embedded in the slime. Unfortunately, we could not test this possibility directly because the amount of OM<sub>sfGFP</sub>/OM<sub>mCherry</sub> labeled material remains too weak to detect a significant transfer to gliding cells by fluorescence microscopy."

Specifically, we found that the physical contact between two adjacent cells is sufficient to promote transfer of OM proteins and lipids at high efficiency. This explains the results from bulk transfer experiments (from previous works and reported herein) suggesting that transfer is a remarkably efficient process. The formation of transient OM tubes between cells is a major indication that transfer indeed occurs by OM fusion: the tubes are continuous extension of cell OM, they form between transferring cells and allow the rapid exchange of lipids. Importantly, the <i>Myxococcus</i> OM transfer system is distinct from reported bacterial nanotubes, which seem to connect the cytosolic contents of connected cells and involve a yet uncharacterized machinery (<a href=\"#bib6\">Dubey and Ben-Yehuda, 2011</a>). In <i>Myxococcus</i>, the transfer process is restricted to OM proteins and lipids. Transfer only occurs in a subset of cell contact events, suggesting that it is provoked by specific contacts, for example if TraA interactions brought OMs in close apposition locally. OM<sub>sfGFP</sub>/OM<sub>mCherry</sub> are fused to type II signal sequences and thus insert in the OM as OM lipoproteins. Since, OM lipoproteins are inserted in the inner leaflet of the OM (<a href=\"#bib13\">Nakayama et al., 2012</a>), transfer must involve the fusion of both leaflets of the OM membrane, suggesting that the entire OM is exchanged locally between cells. The formation of OM synapses must therefore create continuity between the periplasmic content of transferring cells. The size of the OM synapse may be estimated from the size of the tubes (\u223c50 nm), suggesting that the diameter of the periplasmic lumen may reach up to 20 nm (for an OM of 10\u201315 nm thickness [<a href=\"#bib2\">Bayer, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Palsdottir et al., 2009</a>]), providing ample space for periplasmic exchange. However, the PERI<sub>mCherry</sub> probe was poorly if at all exchanged and there is currently no evidence for the physiological transfer of periplasmic proteins, suggesting that OM synapses are not very permeable to periplasmic proteins."

The shedding of large amounts of membrane materials on the underlying substrate is a common byproduct of surface motility both in eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. For example, crawling keratinocytes also deposit their plasma membrane due to the activity of acto-myosin motors in focal adhesions (<a href=\"#bib10\">Kirfel et al., 2003</a>). In <i>Myxococcus,</i> gliding (A\u2212)motility is thought to involve OM dynamics in the form of energized deformations and/or protein movements (<a href=\"#bib15\">Nan et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Luciano et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Nan et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Sun et al., 2011</a>). Thus, OM fragments may detach to the substrate due to the interaction between the motility machinery and slime. It is possible that acquisition of the <i>traAB</i> genes allowed <i>Myxococcus</i> cells to recycle this \u2018waste\u2019 and co-opt it for cell\u2013cell signaling.

Contrary to known contact dependent protein transfer systems, the type VI secretion (<a href=\"#bib22\">Silverman et al., 2012</a>) or intercellular nanotubes (<a href=\"#bib6\">Dubey and Ben-Yehuda, 2011</a>), the distribution of TraA suggests that Tra-dependent OM fusion is restricted to the deltaproteobacteria (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Interestingly, even in <i>Myxococcus xanthus</i> strains, the predicted extracellular N-terminal PA14 domain of TraA shows variability, while the C-terminal region, presumably involved in anchoring to the cell surface is highly conserved (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6B\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Importantly, TraA acts as both key and lock for transfer to occur (<a href=\"#bib18\">Pathak et al., 2012</a>). Therefore, as already suggested, OM-transfer may have evolved to regulate interactions between cells of the same kin. <i>tra</i> mutants do not show motility or developmental defects in pure culture and thus the contribution of OM transfer to <i>Myxococcus</i> social behaviors is unclear (<a href=\"#bib18\">Pathak et al., 2012</a>). Interestingly however, mixing <i>tra</i> mutants with WT cells perturbs motility and development profoundly, consistent with a role in the control population dynamics (<a href=\"#bib18\">Pathak et al., 2012</a>). OM exchange by transient fusion may be more widespread than suspected, especially because it is not easily unmasked and likely does not employ a conserved molecular system. Indeed, membrane vesicles and tubes have been observed in other biofilm-forming proteobacteria (<a href=\"#bib20\">Schooling and Beveridge, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Schooling et al., 2009</a>) and could well be involved in OM exchange behaviors."

Microscopic analysis was performed using an automated and inverted epifluorescence microscope TE2000-E-PFS (Nikon, Champigny sur Marne, France). The microscope is equipped with \u2018The Perfect Focus System\u2019 (PFS) that automatically maintains focus so that the point of interest within a specimen is always kept in sharp focus at all times, in spite of any mechanical or thermal perturbations. Photobleaching was performed with a 488 nm laser. The bleach region of interest (ROI) was a circular region \u223c1 \u00b5m diameter. The ROI was uniformly bleached with a 200 ms laser exposition at 100% intensity. Images were recorded with a CoolSNAP HQ 2 (Roper Scientific, Roper Scientific SARL, France) and a 100x/1.4 DLL objective. All fluorescence images were acquired with appropriate filters with a minimal exposure time to minimize bleaching and phototoxicity effects. Cell tracking was performed automatically using a previously described macro under the METAMORPH software (Molecular devices, Evry, France) (<a href=\"#bib7\">Ducret et al., 2009</a>). Typically, the images were equalized, straightened and overlaid under both ImageJ 1.40g (National Institute of Health, United States) and METAMORPH. Kymographs display the maximum intensity values of green or red signal along the long axis of the cell for each frame, using a 0.2 \u00b5m wide region. The Y-axis of each kymograph represents the relative position along the cell body, where 0 represents the mid-cell and 1 or \u22121 the cell poles. The \u22121 pole is always the pole closer to the bottom of the frames shown in panel."

Briefly, carbon-coated copper grids were covered with 30 \u00b5l of carboxymethylcellulose sodium salt (Medium viscosity, Sigma-Aldrich, Inc., St Louis, MO) diluted in ultrapure water. After 15 min of incubation at room temperature, the coating solution was removed by performing two successive washes with ultrapure water. Carbon-coated copper grids were then covered with the cell suspension previously washed and resuspended in TPM containing 100 mM of CaCl<sub>2</sub> (TPM-Ca<sup>2+</sup>). After 1 or 15 min incubation, unattached cells were removed by performing two successive washes with TPM. For Lectin-Gold staining procedure, carbon-coated copper grids were first covered for 30 min with 30 \u00b5l of ConcanavalinA (ConA)-Biotin conjugated (ConA-Biotin; Sigma-Aldrich, Inc.) diluted in TPM-Ca<sup>2+</sup> to a final concentration of 100 \u00b5g/ml and then washed four times with TPM-Ca<sup>2+</sup>. The grids were then incubated for 15 min with 10 nm gold-conjugated streptavidin (Invitrogen, Saint Aubin, France) diluted in TPM-Ca<sup>2+</sup> (1/500) and then washed four times with TPM-Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Grids were postfixed with 1% glutaraldehyde, washed once with TPM, washed four times with water, stained with 1% (wt/vol) uranyl acetate, dried, and imaged with a JEM-1011 transmission electron microscope operated at 100 kV. Cells were first observed on standard TEM grids. As observed in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, tubes appear as continuous and flexible structures emerging from the cell surface. Unattached tubes and vesicles were also observed in the vicinity of cells suggesting that this material was also released by cells in the media. On standard uncoated TEM grids <i>Myxococcus</i> cells do not glide (data not shown) precluding any observation of these structures when cells were moving. To deal with this limitation we pre-coated the TEM grids with cellulose, a linear polysaccharide composed of \u03b2(1\u21924) linked D-glucose units and previously known to support gliding motility of <i>M. xanthus</i> (<a href=\"#bib8\">Ducret et al., 2013</a>). As observed on <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,D</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>, linear depositions of tubes and vesicles were observed in the wake of motile cells when cells were deposited on pre-coated TEM grids and incubated for 20 min before fixation. Linear depositions were not observed (i) when motile cells were fixed directly after deposition, (ii) with non-motile cells, and (iii) with A\u2212 cells (A<sup>\u2212</sup>S<sup>+</sup> strain), strongly suggesting that these depositions are specifically associated with the A-motility. Since gliding <i>Myxococcus</i> cells are known to deposit slime, a self-deposited sugar polymer that facilitates cell adhesion to the underlying substratum, we then tested if the deposited material is associated with slime. The slime polymer can be detected selectively by addition of Concanavalin A (ConA). When ConA was added to the TEM grids, electron-dense trails appeared in the wake of motile cells. The tubes and vesicles were clearly embedded in these trails. To verify that the trails are indeed labeled by ConA, we use Biotinylated ConA and colloidal gold-streptavidin. As observed on <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>, gold particles were exclusively associated with the trail proving that vesicles and tubes are associated with the slime polymer."

The presentation made it more difficult than needed to discriminate the contributions from previous work published by Wall\u2019s group. As written it could be viewed as a clear confirmation of the Wall findings. We believe you have made important contributions beyond the Wall papers and by revising your manuscript you can make these contributions clear. Wall predicted outer membrane tubes connecting cells and allowing transfer of material. You clearly show these tubes and characterize them (length, diameter, etc). You also provide information about the rather rapid rate of transfer from one cell to another during connection (presumably through the tubes). You also show that there is OM material in the slime trails left in the path of a cell. Although you don\u2019t know the biological significance of this yet, it is something that we believe might be very important. It seems the work advances our understanding of signaling in <i>Myxococcus</i> and it seems that it is at least as important to those interested in OM vesicles and signaling, an emerging area on microbiology. One of the reviewers suggested that by breaking your manuscript into sections with subheadings, the special contributions of your work would become more evident."

The Results section was also re-organized into paragraphs separated by subheadings. In addition, we also significantly rewrote many sections, mainly in the Introduction and Discussion sections. In the Introduction, the second paragraph now presents previous contributions from other laboratories and the proposed transfer mechanism in detail to clarify knowledge of the transfer mechanism prior to this work. Similarly, in the Discussion section, the first two paragraphs have been rewritten to discuss the extensions that our results provide to the understanding of the transfer mechanism and its biological role."
