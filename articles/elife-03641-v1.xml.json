To this end we present an approach termed PRIME for generating cell-specific genome-scale metabolic models (GSMMs) based on molecular and phenotypic data. We build &gt;280 models of normal and cancer cell-lines that successfully predict metabolic phenotypes in an individual manner. We utilize this set of cell-specific models to predict drug targets that selectively inhibit cancerous but not normal cell proliferation. The top predicted target, <i>MLYCD</i>, is experimentally validated and the metabolic effects of MLYCD depletion investigated. Furthermore, we tested cell-specific predicted responses to the inhibition of metabolic enzymes, and successfully inferred the prognosis of cancer patients based on their PRIME-derived individual GSMMs. These results lay a computational basis and a counterpart experimental proof of concept for future personalized metabolic modeling applications, enhancing the search for novel selective anticancer therapies."

To this end we present an approach termed PRIME for generating cell-specific genome-scale metabolic models (GSMMs) based on molecular and phenotypic data. We build &gt;280 models of normal and cancer cell-lines that successfully predict metabolic phenotypes in an individual manner. We utilize this set of cell-specific models to predict drug targets that selectively inhibit cancerous but not normal cell proliferation. The top predicted target, <i>MLYCD</i>, is experimentally validated and the metabolic effects of MLYCD depletion investigated. Furthermore, we tested cell-specific predicted responses to the inhibition of metabolic enzymes, and successfully inferred the prognosis of cancer patients based on their PRIME-derived individual GSMMs. These results lay a computational basis and a counterpart experimental proof of concept for future personalized metabolic modeling applications, enhancing the search for novel selective anticancer therapies."

Now Yizhak, Gaude et al. have used a range of data, including gene expression data, to create computer models of the metabolic phenotypes of 60 different types of human cancer cell.

One gene that was predicted to provide such a drug target encodes an enzyme that is needed to make and break down fatty acid molecules.

The use of molecular data to personalize cancer treatment and differentiate one type of cancer from another can facilitate the use of highly tailored therapies and offers tremendous potential for improved prognoses (<a href=\"#bib47\">Simon and Roychowdhury, 2013</a>). A fundamental stepping-stone towards this goal is the ability to derive large-scale functional physiological models of specific cells that capture their unique cellular behavior. These models can then be utilized to identify drug targets that differentiate one cancer type from the other, and most importantly, distinguish them from their normal counterparts thus achieving treatment response selectivity."

In recent years, two Genome-Scale Metabolic Models (GSMMs) of human metabolism were published (<a href=\"#bib15\">Duarte et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Ma et al., 2007</a>), and their utility in predicting human metabolic phenotypes has been demonstrated in a wide range of studies (<a href=\"#bib45\">Shlomi et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Lewis et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Folger et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Frezza et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Agren et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Yizhak et al., 2013</a>). Recently, more comprehensive versions of the generic human model were published (<a href=\"#bib50\">Thiele et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Mardinoglu et al., 2014</a>). While these generic models are not specific to any cell- or tissue-type, they have successfully served both as a basis for generating context-specific models of tissues (<a href=\"#bib45\">Shlomi et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Jerby et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Agren et al., 2012</a>) and for studying cancer metabolism (<a href=\"#bib19\">Folger et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Frezza et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Shlomi et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Agren et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Facchetti et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Wang et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Dolfi et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Agren et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Yizhak et al., 2014</a>). Importantly, methods for building context-specific models do not take into account subtle differences in levels of expression of a particular enzyme, but rather its presence or absence. This coarse discretization makes these methods less applicable for the task of building cell-specific models, in cases where a high similarity in transcriptomics levels of different samples is observed. Namely, when the inter-individual variations in the molecular signatures of different cells are too small, this type of methods would lead to nearly identical models with little specific predictive value. Alternatively, absolute expression levels can be used to constraint the model's solution space, as previously done by E-Flux for studying bacterial metabolism (<a href=\"#bib11\">Colijn et al., 2009</a>). Nonetheless, the applicability of E-Flux for studying human metabolism has not been established."

We aimed to construct such models for the human NCI-60 and HapMap cell line collections, where the similarity in expression levels of different cell lines is quite high. We began our investigation by testing the suitability of two existing model-building approaches towards this end. The moderate performance achieved by existing methods (see next section) have led us to develop a new cell-specific model building method termed PRIME (Personalized ReconstructIon of Metabolic models), which utilizes both molecular and phenotypic data for tailoring cell-specific GSMMs. We applied PRIME to reconstruct &gt;280 GSMMs of cancer and normal proliferating cells, which are tested by their ability to predict metabolic phenotypes such as proliferation rate, drug response and biomarkers on an individual level. We then utilized the models of normal and cancer cell lines to predict cancer selective drug targets. We validate experimentally that the top predicted gene target, Malonyl-CoA decayboxylase (<i>MLYCD</i>), induces a clear selective effect on cell growth when tested in both leukemia and renal cancer cell lines, vs normal lymphoblast and renal cell lines. Furthermore, we used PRIME to reconstruct personalized metabolic models of breast and lung cancer patients successfully inferring their prognosis. We therefore suggest that PRIME can be applied in the future to a variety of personalized medicine applications where molecular and phenotypic data can be coupled together to find metabolic drug targets."

As these datasets contain both gene expression information and growth rate for each cell line, our goal has been to use the gene expression to build cell-specific models that can predict an array of metabolic phenotypes using the measured proliferation rates for initial testing and validation. The difference in the gene expression of HapMap and NCI-60 datasets is very subtle (mean Spearman R &gt; 0.92, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, upper panel), which may in turn imply that discretization-based methods would result here with nearly identical models that will fail to differentiate between their phenotypes. We therefore hypothesized that the integration of absolute expression levels would possibly be more suitable for our goal. To this end, we examined the performance of the two representative previously published methods on these datasets, one accepting discretized expression as inputs (iMAT [<a href=\"#bib45\">Shlomi et al., 2008</a>]) and one analyzing the raw, non discretized expression data (E-Flux [<a href=\"#bib11\">Colijn et al., 2009</a>])."

PRIME aims to reconstruct distinct, phenotype-based cell-specific metabolic models (PBCS) based on sample-specific molecular data. This is achieved by setting maximal flux capacity constraints <i>on a selected subset of reactions</i> in the generic species model, according to their associated gene expression levels and phenotypic data. PRIME's starting point is similar to E-Flux. While both methods utilize the rather straightforward notion of adjusting reactions' bounds according to expression levels, few key differences between them help PRIME generate more accurate models: (1) since modifying the reactions' bounds is considered to be a hard constraint, one should aim to avoid over-constraining the network based on irrelevant or noisy information. Clearly, only a subset of the metabolic genes affects a specific central cellular phenotype. Accordingly, PRIME identifies this set in the wild type unperturbed case and modifies the bounds of only the relevant set of reactions; (2) while a common assumption is that expression levels and flux rates are proportional, this is known to hold only partially (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bordel et al., 2010</a>). PRIME therefore utilizes the additional phenotypic data to determine the direction (sign) of this relation and modifies the bounds accordingly (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019); (3) PRIME modifies reactions' bounds within a pre-defined range where the modification is known to have the greatest effect on a given phenotype (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019). Importantly, E-Flux has only been utilized to build models of two different bacterial conditions, by aggregating the expression levels of all samples associated with each condition. In this study we employ the principles described above to build individual cell models from the human metabolic model based on a <i>single sample</i> gene expression signature of each cell."

It then proceeds as follows: (1) A set of genes that are significantly correlated with the key phenotype of interest is determined (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2A</a>); (2) The maximal flux capacity of reactions associated with the genes identified in (1) is modified according to the <i>directionality and level</i> of their corresponding gene expression level. Importantly, to assure that bound modifications would have an effect on the models' solution space, reactions' flux bounds are modified within an effective flux range.

Applying a partial correlation analysis between <i>in silico</i> predicted and measured drug response while controlling for the experimentally measured proliferation rate (as growth rate itself has been implicated as a predictor of drug response, e.g., for cytotoxic drugs), we still find a significant association between predicted and measured drug response for the HapMap and CEU datasets, and in some cases even higher than before (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1D\u2013E</a>).

                                "text": "The array of models built for both normal and cancer cells provides us with a unique opportunity not only to predict cell-specific drug target effects, but more importantly, to find drug targets that inhibit proliferation across all cancer cells but have no effect on the non-transformed counterpart. To this aim we simulated all knock downs of individual reactions in the 224 normal lymphoblasts and 60 cancer cell models, and quantified their selective effect on cell proliferation (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019). The set of predicted <i>non-selective</i> targets was highly enriched with current cytostatic drugs (<a href=\"#bib55\">Wishart et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Folger et al., 2011</a>) (mean hypergeometric p-value = 7.28e-4, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1G</a>). Second, the predicted selective targets were enriched with targets of newly developed drugs (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>): Out of the five metabolic enzyme drug targets reported in (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cheong et al., 2012</a>), our analysis identified three as being <i>selective</i> (Hypergeometric p-value = 3.98e-4; <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2C</a>). To further validate these findings, we examined the clinical relevance of our predicted selective targets on a cohort of 1586 breast cancer patients (<a href=\"#bib13\">Curtis et al., 2012</a>). A Cox multivariate regression analysis shows that this set is enriched (Hypergeometric p-value = 2.1e-5) with genes whose lower expression is significantly associated with improved survival (Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p-values with FDR and \u03b1 = 0.1, \u2018Materials and methods\u2019), when examined together with known prognostic variables such as patients' clinical stage, histological grade, tumor size, lymph node status and estrogen receptor status. A similar analysis for the set of predicted <i>non-selective</i> targets yielded either borderline or insignificant results (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1G</a>). A top predicted selective target is Malonyl-CoA Decarboxylase (<i>MLYCD</i>) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). While the highest ranked predicted reaction is catalyzed by isoenzymes and therefore more difficult to target experimentally, and the second ranked reaction occurs spontaneously, <i>MLYCD</i> is the first prediction that could be tested from a practical, experimental point of view (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2C</a>). Of note, the knock down of MLYCD is predicted by E-Flux to reduce both normal and cancer cell proliferation by less than 10%, suggesting that without including phenotype-based constraints, this candidate gene would have not been revealed (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). Interestingly, this enzyme has been recently proposed as potential anticancer target for breast cancer (<a href=\"#bib59\">Zhou et al., 2009</a>), however its selective effects on other tumor types have not been assessed. Therefore, we decided to further investigate the role of MLYCD as selective target for cancer therapy."

Therefore, to experimentally validate the <i>cancer versus normal</i> selectivity, we initially used leukemia cells, the only hematological tumor type in the NCI-60 database. In line with PRIME's predictions, the small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated silencing of <i>MLYCD</i> significantly inhibited the proliferation of the leukemia cell lines RPMI-8226 and K562 cells, but had no effect on HapMap cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013B</a>). To further corroborate the <i>cancer versus normal</i> selectivity, we tested the effects of <i>MLYCD</i> depletion on two renal cancer cell lines, TK-10 and CAKI-1, using the non-transformed renal cell line HK-2 as <i>normal</i> control (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Of note, the silencing of <i>MLYCD</i> suppressed proliferation of renal cancer cell lines without affecting the non-transformed counterpart (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Importantly, the anti-proliferative effects of MLYCD suppression could not be explained by the different expression of the enzyme among the different cell lines (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). These results substantiated PRIME's prediction that MLYCD is a cancer selective drug target."

To this aim, we generated a leukemia cell line that stably expresses a doxycycline-inducible short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting <i>MLYCD</i>. The incubation with doxycycline resulted in efficient silencing of <i>MLYCD</i> and led to a significant growth inhibition (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1\u20132</a>), in line with the siRNA experiments. Previous reports have shown that MLYCD depletion leads to the accumulation of malonyl-CoA, which blocks fatty acid oxidation by allosteric inhibition of the mitochondrial enzyme Carnitine-Palmitoyl-Transferase (CPT1) (<a href=\"#bib59\">Zhou et al., 2009</a>). These observations prompted us to investigate the effects of the loss of MLYCD on fatty acid oxidation. To this aim, cells were incubated with <sup>13</sup>C<sub>16</sub>-palmitate and the abundance of <sup>13</sup>C-labelled palmitoyl-carnitine and of TCA cycle metabolites was measured by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LCMS) (see <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a> for a schematic of the experiment). We observed a significant decrease in the <sup>13</sup>C-labelling of palmitoyl-carnitine (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>) and of the m+2 isotopologues of TCA cycle intermediates (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>, and <a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3</a> for the full isotopologue analyses of these metabolites), indicating that fatty acid oxidation is reduced in MLYCD-depleted cells. Of note, this marked decrease in fatty acid oxidation only partially affected the overall abundance of TCA cycle intermediates (<a href=\"#fig5s4\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). We also noticed a striking accumulation of succinate and a decrease in fumarate and malate in MLYCD-depleted cells (<a href=\"#fig5s4\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 4)</a>. These results are consistent with the inhibition of the TCA cycle enzyme succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), which may be caused by malonyl-CoA-derived malonate. Taken together, these results show that the silencing of <i>MLYCD</i> is sufficient to inhibit fatty acid oxidation and alter TCA cycle."

                                "text": "We then used the PRIME-derived models to systematically assess the metabolic changes that occur upon MLYCD inactivation. Of note, the model predicted that upon <i>MLYCD</i> suppression, part of the accumulated malonyl-CoA is diverted to fatty acid biosynthesis. Since this process requires NADPH as source of reducing power, the aberrant activation of fatty acid synthesis caused by the loss of MLYCD would impair redox homeostasis of the cell (<a href=\"#bib3\">Berg, 2002</a>) (<a href=\"#fig5s5\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 5</a> and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1H</a>). We validated this hypothesis by first assessing fatty acid synthesis. To this aim, cells were incubated with <sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>-glucose and the abundance of <sup>13</sup>C-labelled TCA cycle intermediates and palmitate were analyzed by LCMS (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). While the labeling of citrate, the main lipogenic precursor, was, if any, slightly decreased (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>), the m+4 and m+6 isotopologues of palmitate were significantly increased in MLYCD-depleted cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>), suggesting that fatty acid synthesis is accelerated in these cells. Of note, the reduction of the m+2 and m+4 isotopologues of TCA cycle intermediates suggested that the oxidative capacity of the TCA cycle is intact, albeit reduced, in MLYCD-depleted cells (<a href=\"#fig5s6\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 6</a>). To validate the prediction that MLYCD-depleted cells increase the demand of NAPDH to fuel fatty acid synthesis, we measured the activity of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), the major source of cytosolic NADPH (<a href=\"#bib18\">Fan et al., 2014</a>). To this end, cells were incubated with 1,2-<sup>13</sup>C<sub>2</sub>-glucose and the amount of singly (m+1) or doubly (m+2) labeled lactate was used as measure of PPP or glycolysis activity, respectively (see <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a> for a representation of the experiment). As predicted by PRIME, PPP flux was increased in MLYCD-depleted cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5H\u2013I</a>). Together, these results corroborate the prediction made by PRIME that the loss of MLYCD increases fatty acid synthesis and impinges on the PPP for generation of reducing power. Finally, we tested whether the observed activation of fatty acid synthesis, by draining NADPH, impairs the capacity of cells to maintain redox homeostasis. In line with this hypothesis, MLYCD-depleted cells exhibited a lower GSH/GSSG ratio compared to control cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5I</a>). Furthermore, the incubation of cells with the antioxidant N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) fully restored the proliferation defects observed in MLYCD-depleted cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5J</a>). Taken together, these results suggest that the suppression of cancer cell proliferation caused by the loss of MLYCD depends, at least in part, on the aberrant activation of fatty acid synthesis, which leads to a reduced ability of cells to maintain redox homeostasis. Overall, this investigation showed the benefits of PRIME to predict and investigate metabolic liabilities of cancer cells, based on cell-specific metabolic models."

Importantly, growth rate measurements are not available for these datasets. Nonetheless, a possible way to overcome this hurdle and to build personalized metabolic models for cancer patients is to use phenotypic data measured for one set of cells to reconstruct models of a different set of cells or clinical samples. To examine this approach we utilized the set of growth-associated genes derived from the NCI-60 collection to build personalized GSMMs of more than 700 breast and lung cancer clinical samples (<a href=\"#bib35\">Miller et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Chang et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Okayama et al., 2012</a>). A Kaplan\u2013Meier survival analysis (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kaplan and Meier, 1958</a>) showed that patients with predicted low growth rate had significantly improved survival compared to those with a predicted high growth rate (logrank p-values are: 0.01, 1e-3 and 0.02 for Miller et al., Chang et al. and Okayama et al. respectively, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1I</a>, \u2018Materials and methods\u2019).

To the best of our knowledge, PRIME is the first method able to generate human cell-specific GSMMs that can predict metabolic phenotypes in an individual manner, including growth rates and drug response. The set of normal and cancer PRIME-derived models is utilized to identify a set of drug targets that can inhibit the proliferation of specific cell lines, as well as metabolic targets that can selectively block cancer but not normal cells growth.

Third, PRIME relies on the measurement of a specific phenotype that is not always available for a given set of cells or samples. Here we introduced a possible way to overcome this hurdle, as demonstrated by PRIME's ability to utilize clinical data and build cell-specific GSMMs tailored for each individual patient. However, while this analysis provided significant results, the obtained signal is mild and the question whether and how best one can identify a universal set of growth-associated genes still requires further study. Given the results obtained, one can confidently expect that follow-up work analyzing richer datasets, and most importantly, incorporating additional kinds of omics data (such as enzyme sequence data) will significantly improve the predictive power of PRIME further."

MLYCD is an important enzyme of fatty acid metabolism, which role in cancer therapy has been recently suggested (<a href=\"#bib59\">Zhou et al., 2009</a>). However, the selectivity across cancer types, and the mechanism of action of its inhibition have not been fully investigated. Our results show that the silencing of <i>MLYCD</i> has an anti-proliferative effect across multiple cancer cell lines but spares the non-transformed counterparts, confirming PRIME's predictions. We have also shed some light on the functional effects of inactivation of MLYCD in cancer cells. The toxic effects of MLYCD inhibition have been previously attributed to the accumulation of malonyl-coA and to the inhibition of fatty acid oxidation (<a href=\"#bib59\">Zhou et al., 2009</a>). Our results suggest that, besides turning off fatty acid oxidation and partially deregulating TCA cycle, the loss of MLYCD stimulates fatty acid synthesis, which drains reducing equivalents and sensitize cells to oxidative stress. Therefore, our results not only confirmed the <i>cancer versus normal</i> selectivity of MLYCD inhibition but also elucidated a novel liability of cancer cells based on the pharmacological inhibition of fatty acid metabolism. Of note, both these features were accurately predicted by PRIME. Importantly, in humans, the loss of MLYCD leads to methylmalonic aciduria, an extremely rare autosomal recessive disorder. Nevertheless, in vivo experiments in rodents and pigs (<a href=\"#bib16\">Dyck et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Wu et al., 2014</a>), ex vivo experiments in human skeletal muscle (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bouzakri et al., 2008</a>), and in MRC-5 non-transformed fibroblasts (<a href=\"#bib59\">Zhou et al., 2009</a>) suggest that the inhibition of MLYCD is well tolerated, as our results indicate. It is therefore possible that the inhibition of the enzyme has no detrimental effects on normal cells and tissues, and that other factors contribute to the severity of MLYCD deficiency in humans, including a toxic effect of the mutated protein (<a href=\"#bib40\">Polinati et al., 2014</a>)."

In this study we focused on drugs that: (1) have an inhibitory effect; (2) the majority of their targets are metabolic; (3) are not associated with dead-end reactions. The drug response data used in this analysis was measured in various ways: (a) ATP concentrations (HapMap dataset): In this case the <i>in silico</i> drug response is computed via MOMA in two steps; (1) obtaining a wild-type flux distribution via Flux Balance Analysis in which the corresponding drug target reaction is initially forced to be active (the pre-drug condition). Enforcing the target reaction to be active is necessary in order to get an effect on the resulting flux distribution following the inhibition simulated in the next step. Here we enforced a positive flux through the target reactions that is 50% of the maximal flux rate it is able to carry (our results are robust to various activation thresholds; <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1D</a>). (2) Next, the knock out flux distribution is computed via MOMA (<a href=\"#bib44\">Segre et al., 2002</a>) while constraining the flux through the corresponding reactions to zero. This process is repeated for each personalized model separately and the predicted ATP production is used to estimate the cell response to the simulated drug. A robustness analysis is carried out by using 1000 different wild-type flux distributions (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1D</a>); (b) AC50 values (CEU dataset): AC50 values represent the concentration in which the drug exhibits 50% of its maximum efficacy. In this case, <i>in silico</i> AC50 values are calculated by estimating the maximal flux rate carried by the target reaction when the growth rate is set to 50% of the drug's maximal response (a value that is available in the dataset used [<a href=\"#bib32\">Lock et al., 2012</a>]); (c) IC50 values (NCI-60 dataset): IC50 values represent the concentration of drug needed in order to reduce the growth rate to 50% of its maximal value. In this case, <i>in silico</i> IC50 values are calculated by estimating the maximal flux rate carried by the target reaction when growth rate is set to 50% of its maximal value. In all cases of drug response simulations the permutation test is carried out by permuting the measured data 1000 times and re-estimating the resulting correlation for each permuted vector."

The knock down of each tested reaction was simulated by inhibiting the target reaction by at least 75% of its maximal flux, then maximizing cellular growth under this perturbation. To increase specificity, we focused on reactions that are: (1) catalyzed by a single gene, and (2), their catalyzing gene does not catalyze more than three different reactions. Reactions were then ranked based on the variance in their knock down predicted growth rate across the four cell line models. 13 top predicted genes were selected for further experimental validation based on their high ranking in the list (i.e., high variance) and their association with diverse metabolic pathways (excluding transport reactions which their catalyzing enzymes are less specific).

Although we were not able to reliably detect malonyl-CoA and malonate in our experiments, we have now shown that the silencing of MLYCD leads to a significant decrease in fatty acid oxidation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A-C</a>) and to increased <i>de novo</i> fatty acid synthesis (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D-F</a>).

It is worth mentioning that we investigated the deregulation of redox homeostasis as an experimental validation of PRIME\u2019s predictions on the global metabolic effects of MLYCD depletion. These predictions indicated that the silencing of MLYCD causes a redox imbalance due to an increased demand of NAPDH to support accelerated lipid synthesis. We have now strengthened this hypothesis by: (1) confirming that fatty acid synthesis is increased in MLYCD-depleted cells (see comment above); and (2) measuring the activity of the pentose phosphate pathway, the major source of cytosolic NADPH [1]. To this aim, we performed an isotope tracing experiment with 1,2-<sup>13</sup>C<sub>2</sub>-Glucose, which enables us to distinguish between glycolysis and PPP fluxes (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>). Reassuringly, we observed a significant increase in the PPP upon MLYCD inhibition (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G-H</a>). These results are in line with the hypothesis that aberrant fatty acid synthesis drains redox equivalents, exposing cells to higher oxidative stress."

Nevertheless, <i>in vivo</i> experiments in rodents and pigs [2, 3], <i>ex vivo</i> experiments in human skeletal muscle [4], and in MRC-5 non-transformed fibroblasts [5] suggest that the inhibition of MLYCD is well tolerated, as our results indicate. It is therefore possible that the inhibition of the enzyme has no detrimental effects on normal cells and tissues, and that other factors contribute to the severity of MLYCD deficiency in humans, including a toxic effect of the mutated protein [6]. We agree with the referees that more experiments are required to assess the therapeutic window of MLYCD inhibition <i>in vivo</i>, but we believe that these experiments are beyond the scope of this manuscript. In light of the referees\u2019 comment, however, a brief discussion along these lines has now been added."

Following, two different approaches can be taken to estimate the effect of a perturbation on the network: (1) via Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) [7] where maximization of growth rate is defined as the cellular objective function (<math id=\"inf3\"><mrow><mtext>max</mtext><msub><mi>V</mi><mrow><mi>b</mi><mi>i</mi><mi>o</mi></mrow></msub></mrow></math>); (2) Minimization of Metabolic Adjustment (MOMA) [8] where the minimization of the Euclidean distance between a wild-type flux distribution (<math id=\"inf4\"><mrow><msub><mi>V</mi><mrow><mi>w</mi><mi>t</mi></mrow></msub></mrow></math>) and the post-perturbation flux distribution (<math id=\"inf5\"><mrow><msub><mi>V</mi><mrow><mi>K</mi><mi>O</mi></mrow></msub></mrow></math>) is set as the cellular objective function <math id=\"inf6\"><mrow><mi>m</mi><mi>i</mi><mi>n</mi><msqrt><mrow><munderover><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\"><mo>\u2211</mo></mstyle><mi>i</mi><mi>n</mi></munderover><msup><mrow><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><msub><mi>V</mi><mrow><mi>w</mi><mi>t</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>i</mi></mrow></msub><mo>\u2212</mo><msub><mi>V</mi><mrow><mi>K</mi><mi>O</mi><mo>,</mo><mi>i</mi></mrow></msub></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow></msqrt></mrow></math>.
