                    "text": "One of the major unanswered questions in evolutionary biology is when and how the transition between diderm (two membranes) and monoderm (one membrane) cell envelopes occurred in Bacteria. The Negativicutes and the Halanaerobiales belong to the classically monoderm Firmicutes, but possess outer membranes with lipopolysaccharide (LPS-OM). Here, we show that they form two phylogenetically distinct lineages, each close to different monoderm relatives. In contrast, their core LPS biosynthesis enzymes were inherited vertically, as in the majority of bacterial phyla. Finally, annotation of key OM systems in the Halanaerobiales and the Negativicutes shows a puzzling combination of monoderm and diderm features. Together, these results support the hypothesis that the LPS-OMs of Negativicutes and Halanaerobiales are remnants of an ancient diderm cell envelope that was present in the ancestor of the Firmicutes, and that the monoderm phenotype in this phylum is a derived character that arose multiple times independently through OM loss."

The Negativicutes and the Halanaerobiales belong to the classically monoderm Firmicutes, but possess outer membranes with lipopolysaccharide (LPS-OM). Here, we show that they form two phylogenetically distinct lineages, each close to different monoderm relatives. In contrast, their core LPS biosynthesis enzymes were inherited vertically, as in the majority of bacterial phyla. Finally, annotation of key OM systems in the Halanaerobiales and the Negativicutes shows a puzzling combination of monoderm and diderm features. Together, these results support the hypothesis that the LPS-OMs of Negativicutes and Halanaerobiales are remnants of an ancient diderm cell envelope that was present in the ancestor of the Firmicutes, and that the monoderm phenotype in this phylum is a derived character that arose multiple times independently through OM loss."

Yet, bacteria show substantial differences in their cell envelope architectures, among which the most dramatic one is the presence of one (monoderm) or two (diderm) membranes (<a href=\"#bib72\">Sutcliffe, 2010</a>). The study of cell envelope architecture has been mostly narrowed to the Firmicutes and the Gammaproteobacteria as textbook examples of monoderm and diderm bacteria, respectively. In <i>Bacillus subtilis</i>, teichoic and lipoteichoic acids are embedded in a thick peptidoglycan wall, while in <i>Escherichia coli</i> a thin peptidoglycan layer is surrounded by an outer membrane (OM) whose biogenesis and functioning involve a complex system of synthesis and transport for LPS, lipoproteins, and OM proteins (OMPs) (<a href=\"#bib68\">Silhavy et al., 2010</a>)."

The fact that the majority of phyla seem to possess two membranes might favor the <i>diderm-first</i> scenario, although the actual diversity of cell envelopes in Bacteria remains largely unexplored (<a href=\"#bib72\">Sutcliffe, 2010</a>). However, the lack of a robustly resolved phylogeny for Bacteria, notably the uncertainty on its root and the nature of the earliest branches, has left the relationships between diderm and monoderm phyla unclear, and not allowed to define in which direction and how many times this transition occurred."

The Negativicutes have been identified in various anaerobic environments, such as soil and lake sediments, industrial waste, and animal digestive tract (<a href=\"#bib80\">Vos et al., 2009</a>). Their best-characterized member is <i>Veillonella</i>, first described in 1898 by Veillon and Zuber (<a href=\"#bib77\">Veillon and Zuber, 1898</a>). Curiously, the very first observation and use of the term 'outer membrane' has been based on studies of <i>Veillonella</i> (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bladen and Mergenhagen, 1964</a>). <i>Veillonella</i> is one of the most abundant components of the human oral flora (<a href=\"#bib73\">Tanner et al., 2011</a>), and a common inhabitant of the intestinal microbiome (<a href=\"#bib76\">van den Bogert et al., 2013</a>). Together with other gut microbes, it has been recently associated with maturation of the immune system and partial protection of asthma in infants (<a href=\"#bib3\">Arrieta et al., 2015</a>), but can also develop into an opportunistic pathogen (<a href=\"#bib31\">Hirai et al., 2016</a>). Several other Negativicutes members such as <i>Dialister, Selenomonas, Mitsuokella,</i> and <i>Anaeroglobus</i> show increased incidence in oral tract disease linked to biofilm formation (<a href=\"#bib24\">Griffen et al., 2012</a>) and involvement in other infections (<a href=\"#bib81\">Wang et al., 2015</a>). Very little experimental data is available on the nature of the diderm cell envelope of Negativicutes. In <i>Selenomonas ruminantium</i> the abundant OmpM protein appears to replace the important function of Braun\u2019s lipoprotein in anchoring the OM to the cell peptidoglycan through a link with cadaverine (<a href=\"#bib37\">Kojima et al., 2010</a>)."

Recently, Tocheva and colleagues analyzed the sporulation process in the Negativicute <i>Acetonema longum</i> by cryoelectron microscopy (<a href=\"#bib75\">Tocheva et al., 2011</a>). They showed that, while an outer membrane forms only transiently during sporulation in classically monoderm Firmicutes such as <i>Bacillus subtilis</i>, it is retained in <i>A. longum</i> leading to its diderm phenotype (<a href=\"#bib75\">Tocheva et al., 2011</a>). This study provided the first experimental support for the hypothesis that the bacterial OM could have initially evolved in an ancient sporulating monoderm bacterium (<a href=\"#bib15\">Dawes et al., 1980</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Errington, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Vollmer, 2012</a>). Moreover, a phylogenetic tree of the essential Omp85 protein family for proteins insertion in the outer membrane, although largely unresolved, did not show the Negativicutes as emerging from any specific diderm phylum (<a href=\"#bib75\">Tocheva et al., 2011</a>). The authors speculated that the OM of Negativicutes was not acquired by horizontal gene transfer but was already present in the ancestor of Firmicutes and would have been lost in the other members of this phylum, although it remained unclear when and how many times this would have occurred (<a href=\"#bib75\">Tocheva et al., 2011</a>). In contrast, a recent analysis of the genome of the Negativicute <i>Acidaminococcus intestini</i> revealed that as much as 7% of the BLAST top hits were from Proteobacteria, the majority of which corresponded to functions related to OM biogenesis, concluding to a possible acquisition of the OM in Negativicutes by horizontal gene transfer (<a href=\"#bib7\">Campbell et al., 2014</a>)."

The Halanaerobiales are a poorly studied group of moderate halophilic, strictly anaerobic Firmicutes that were isolated from saline environments such as lake and lagoon sediments, and oil reservoirs (<a href=\"#bib57\">Oren, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Roush et al., 2014</a>). Similarly to the Negativicutes, they display a diderm-type cell envelope, with a thin peptidoglycan and an outer membrane (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cayol et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib86\">Zeikus et al., 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib87\">Zhilina et al., 1992</a>, <a href=\"#bib88\">Zhilina et al., 2012</a>). When analyzing the first sequenced genome of a member of Halanaerobiales, <i>Halothermothrix orenii</i>, Mavromatis and colleagues identified a number of OM markers, suggesting the presence of an LPS-diderm cell envelope homologous to the one of Negativicutes and other diderm bacteria (<a href=\"#bib45\">Mavromatis et al., 2009</a>).

In fact, no Halanaerobiales were present in the analysis of Tocheva (<a href=\"#bib75\">Tocheva et al., 2011</a>). Mavromatis et al. built a tree from the combined analysis of the genes coding for LPS, which showed a clustering of Halanaerobiales and Negativicutes, leading the authors to propose a horizontal gene transfer of the OM between these two lineages (<a href=\"#bib45\">Mavromatis et al., 2009</a>). However, the sequenced genome of only one member of Halanaerobiales and one of Negativicutes were available at the time, and the LPS tree was largely unresolved (<a href=\"#bib45\">Mavromatis et al., 2009</a>). Moreover, current phylogenies of the Firmicutes have been unclear with respect to the relationships between Negativicutes and Halanaerobiales. The Negativicutes have been alternatively indicated as branching within Clostridia (<a href=\"#bib85\">Yutin and Galperin, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Mavromatis et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Vesth et al., 2013</a>) or at the base of Bacilli (<a href=\"#bib38\">Kunisawa, 2015</a>). The phylogenetic placement of Halanaerobiales remains also uncertain, as they have been assigned either to Class Clostridia (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cayol et al., 1994</a>), as a deep branch in the Firmicutes (<a href=\"#bib45\">Mavromatis et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Vos et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Kunisawa, 2015</a>), or left unresolved (<a href=\"#bib85\">Yutin and Galperin, 2013</a>).

Furthermore, pilus-like structures could be detected, as well as another electron dense layer outside the OM, which might correspond either to the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or an S-layer. Thin sections of <i>H. saccharolyticum</i> also revealed a diderm cell envelope with a densely packed cytoplasm enclosed by a membrane surrounded by a relatively electron lucent periplasm so that the thin line representing the peptidoglycan is clearly visible (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). For both organisms, in some cases the periplasm appeared inflated (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C and D</a>), which was most likely caused by a preparation artifact due to swelling of the cells in the freeze substitution process.

We assembled the 47 ribosomal proteins into a large concatenated dataset (5551 amino acid characters) and carried out Bayesian analysis with a sophisticated site-heterogeneous model of protein evolution (CAT) that allows each site to evolve under its own substitution matrix and is robust against tree reconstruction artifacts that frequently affect deep phylogenies (<a href=\"#bib41\">Lartillot and Philippe, 2004</a>). The Bayesian tree was well resolved at most nodes (Posterior Probabilities (PP) &gt;\u00a00.95, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). Despite the weak signal and the stochastic errors frequently associated to small proteins such as ribosomal ones, topology congruence tests on individual markers showed a largely congruent phylogenetic signal, especially at high rank taxonomy level, justifying their combined analysis (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and Materials and methods). Maximum Likelihood (ML) analysis of the same concatenated dataset and the site-homogeneous LG model (<a href=\"#bib42\">Le and Gascuel, 2008</a>) gave a largely consistent topology although it was much less resolved, especially at deep nodes (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). With respect to previous analyses, the relative placement of Negativicutes and Halanaerobiales in the Firmicutes phylogeny was robustly resolved (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>).

This placement is consistent with previous analyses, although performed with less taxa (<a href=\"#bib85\">Yutin and Galperin, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Mavromatis et al., 2009</a>).

                                "text": "Such clustering is unusual as in <i>E. coli</i> for example these genes are scattered in different regions of the genome. However, the genes coding for the first four steps of LPS synthesis (<i>lpxABCD</i>) display a conserved synteny in diderm Bacteria at very large evolutionary distances, suggesting that they have similar evolutionary histories (<a href=\"#bib56\">Opiyo et al., 2010</a>). Accordingly, synteny is also conserved in Halanaerobiales and Negativicutes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). We therefore searched for these four core LPS genes (<i>lpxABCD</i>) in a local databank of 121 genomes representative of 30 major bacterial phyla (Materials and methods and <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>). As compared to what could be previously inferred from available genomic data (<a href=\"#bib72\">Sutcliffe, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Opiyo et al., 2010</a>), we show the presence of homologues of the four core LPS coding genes in 26 major bacterial phyla, eight of which evidenced for the first time: Thermodesulfobacteria, Fibrobacteres, Ignavibacteria, Nitrospina, Chrysiogenetes, Cloacimonetes, Atribacteria, and Armatimonadetes (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>). This suggests that LPS-diderm cell envelopes might be even more widespread in Bacteria than currently thought, leaving only four major phyla that appear to lack the coding capacity for LPS: Thermotogae, Caldiserica, Chloroflexi/Thermomicrobia, and Actinobacteria (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>). We assembled the four core LPS protein homologues into a concatenated dataset (898 amino acid characters) also including Halanaerobiales and Negativicutes, and obtained a Bayesian tree with the CAT+GTR+\u0393<sub>4</sub> evolutionary model (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, Materials and methods). In agreement with their conserved synteny, congruence tests showed that these four core LPS genes have a consistent phylogenetic signal at large evolutionary distances, in particular concerning the monophyly of major bacterial phyla, justifying their combined analysis (Materials and methods and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Consistently with the notorious difficulty in resolving the global phylogeny of Bacteria, the tree is not completely resolved. However, it is largely in agreement with bacterial systematics, showing the monophyly of major phyla (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). This pattern indicates that the core LPS genes were present in the ancestor of each of these diderm phyla, and that inter-phylum horizontal gene transfers were surprisingly rare during bacterial evolution. Consistently, the Halanaerobiales and Negativicutes also form a well-supported monophyletic cluster (PP\u00a0=\u00a01, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>), with internal branching pattern matching their respective reference species phylogeny shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>."

The inclusion of a second diderm lineage in our analysis allows us to strengthen and extend this scenario, and to infer that present-day monoderm Firmicutes would have emerged from diderm ancestors via not less than five independent losses of the OM (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). The two alternative topologies that were not rejected by AU tests do not affect the inference of a diderm ancestor and imply four and three independent OM losses, respectively (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a> and Additional Data)."

To this aim, we investigated a few key processes that are related to OM biogenesis and functioning and are shared between Negativicutes and Halanaerobiales. Because OM markers frequently display low sequence conservation or are part of large membrane-related protein families often preventing the building of robust phylogenies, we helped tentative annotation by merging information obtained from homology to known OM markers, the presence of specific protein domains, and genomic synteny. In this respect, the presence of the conserved OM locus helped annotation greatly and provided important insights into the unique nature of the cell envelopes of Negativicutes and Halanaerobiales, which show both specific characteristics as well as an intriguing combination of diderm and monoderm features (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>)."

Although LPS can be very heterogeneous in bacteria, it has an overall conserved structure composed of a membrane-anchored hydrophobic domain (lipid A, or endotoxin), an oligosaccharide (inner and outer core), which can be extended with a distal polysaccharide (O-antigen) (<a href=\"#bib82\">Wang et al., 2010</a>). The Lipid A-core portion (known as 'rough' LPS) and the O-antigen have independent pathways for their synthesis and transport. If O-antigen is produced, it is ligated to the lipid A-core by an integral membrane ligase, generating 'smooth' LPS. Then, the transport of LPS to the OM is carried out by a dedicated system (the Lpt pathway) and is independent from O-antigen presence (<a href=\"#bib82\">Wang et al., 2010</a>)."

Moreover, the <i>lpx</i> gene cluster also includes a <i>fabZ</i> homologue, which encodes an enzyme involved in a key step of fatty acid synthesis and is also present in monoderm Firmicutes (<a href=\"#bib58\">Parsons and Rock, 2013</a>). Similarly to what is observed in <i>E. coli</i>, this <i>fabZ</i> homologue shows a conserved position on the chromosome next to <i>lpxC</i>, which catalyzes the first committed step in lipid A biosynthesis and is subject of tight regulation by the protease FtsH (<a href=\"#bib21\">F\u00fchrer et al., 2006</a>). Because FabZ acts on a substrate that is shared with the lipid A pathway, its conserved genomic proximity with LpxC is a strong indication that these two proteins interact in diderm Firmicutes, likely in a common process that regulates the phospholipid/LPS balance of the OM as described in <i>E. coli</i> (<a href=\"#bib34\">Klein et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Ogura et al., 1999</a>)."

In Proteobacteria, a close paralogue of BamA was recently discovered, called TamA, which has one POTRA domain only, and was shown to be anchored to the OM and to form a two-pathway system together with the IM protein TamB to promote T5SS autotransporter assembly and secretion (<a href=\"#bib65\">Selkrig et al., 2012</a>). Based on the large taxonomic distribution of TamB homologues, it has been recently proposed that this protein was present very early in bacterial evolution, and functioned with BamA, while TamA would have arisen more recently in Proteobacteria through gene duplication (<a href=\"#bib30\">Heinz et al., 2015</a>)."

They are assembled via post-translational modifications after translocation through the inner membrane in both diderm and monoderm bacteria. The lipid modification occurs on a 'lipobox' signal near the N-terminus at the cytoplasmic membrane where the pre-lipoprotein diaglycerol transferase Lgt adds a diacylglycerol moiety. The lipobox signal is then cleaved off by the lipoprotein signal peptidase LspA, which allows anchoring of the lipoprotein to the outer face of the plasma membrane. A second lipoprotein N-acetyltransferase, Lnt, can add a third amide fatty acid onto the N-terminus of lipoproteins. Tri-acylated lipoproteins are preferentially targeted to the OM in diderm bacteria via the Lol machinery. This is a multiprotein system formed by an IM-spanning ABC-like transporter component (LolCDE) that captures lipoproteins from the IM and delivers them to the carrier LolA utilizing ATP hydrolysis. LolA then translocates the lipoprotein to the structurally related LolB, which inserts it into the OM by an unclear mechanism."

The main issue mostly\u00a0revolves around the question of how and when an OM originated in Bacteria, and whether monoderm cell envelopes predate diderm cell envelopes or instead derived from them. The complexity of the diderm cell envelope with respect to a perceived more 'rudimentary' monoderm type, together with its higher resistance toward antibiotics, are arguments usually put forward to propose that the OM is a relatively late invention in Bacteria (<a href=\"#bib36\">Koch, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Gupta, 2011</a>). However, it is now evident that diderm phyla outnumber monoderm ones, and span a large fraction of bacterial diversity, including early emerging lineages (<a href=\"#bib72\">Sutcliffe, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Errington, 2013</a>). Unfortunately, the evolutionary relationships among monoderm and diderm bacterial phyla are presently unclear, and do not allow to clarify OM origins. In this respect, the existence of a major bacterial phylum \u2013the Firmicutes- including both diderm and monoderm lineages, and whose evolutionary relationships can be resolved, provides a unique opportunity to address the issue."

Although previously suggested (<a href=\"#bib75\">Tocheva et al., 2011</a>), the inclusion of both Halanaerobiales and Negativicutes in our analysis strengthens and extends this scenario. Our robust phylogeny of the Firmicutes indicates that Halanaerobiales and Negativicutes form two distinct lineages, each related to different monoderm relatives. This allows inferring that the OM was lost from three to five times independently in the Firmicutes, and is therefore not a unique event in the history of Bacteria that would have led to all present-day monoderm lineages, as proposed earlier (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cavalier-Smith, 2006</a>). The deep branching of Halanaerobiales and the still limited genomic coverage for this group makes them a priority target for further exploration as their cell envelopes may retain ancestral characters."

Indeed, we show that the core enzymatic apparatus for producing LPS is even more widespread than previously thought, and that the LPS-OM is an ancient feature that emerged once and was largely inherited vertically during bacterial evolution, including in Halanaerobiales and Negativicutes. This is unusual for cytosolic enzymes, and underlines the key importance of maintaining cell-envelope function. Clearly, the availability of genomic data from an ever-wider sampling of bacterial diversity is sensibly changing perspective on the evolution of bacterial cell envelopes. For example, by revealing the presence of an LPS-OM in the ancestor of Deinococcus/Thermus we show that this phylum does not represent a monoderm-to-diderm intermediate (<a href=\"#bib27\">Gupta, 2011</a>), but rather that LPS was lost in some of their members, a process similar to what likely occurred in Thermotogae (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cavalier-Smith, 2006</a>).

Given the distinct branching of the two diderm lineages in the Firmicutes phylogeny, and the pattern of LPS inheritance similar to all other diderm bacterial phyla, the gene transfer hypothesis would imply a complex scenario consisting of two independent transfers of a very large genomic region, a first one to the ancestor of Halanaerobiales or to the ancestor of Negativicutes, and a second one between these two ancestors, which would have had to coexist at the same time and in the same environment. The sudden acquisition of an OM has been already discussed as mechanistically complicated (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cavalier-Smith, 2006</a>). This would have in fact required the dramatic modification of an originally monoderm cell envelope through the concerted acquisition of several complex systems at once, not to mention the replacement of the native inner membrane components of these systems or their coordination with the newly acquired ones. Moreover, not all OM systems involved in OM biogenesis and function in Negativicutes and Halanaerobiales are part of the gene cluster, and their detailed annotation suggests that their cell envelopes share characteristics with deep-emerging bacterial phyla (e.g. the OmpM porin instead of Braun\u2019s lipoprotein for OM tethering), and present a peculiar combination of monoderm/diderm features (e.g. flagella, pili). The OM gene cluster may therefore represent an ancestral genomic locus for OM\u2013related functions, and it becomes essential to obtain further experimental characterization of the OM of Halanaerobiales and Negativicutes, as well as many other poorly explored deep emerging bacterial phyla. Nevertheless, we have analyzed here only a few OM systems shared between Halanaerobiales and Negativicutes in order to infer the nature of the ancestral diderm cell envelope in the Firmicutes. There are surely additional components that are lineage-specific and may have been acquired from diderm bacteria thriving in the same environment. This is an important future area of investigation, as it could inform on how the presence of an OM in a Firmicutes background may have helped adaptation to specific niches, including the human environment."

Alternatively, we speculate that mutations may have affected the ancestral OmpM, causing a de-regulation of OM-PG attachment. This transition may have been made easier during the process of sporulation, where an OM is transiently formed and lost when the vegetative cell matures. <a href=\"#bib75\">Tocheva et al.

Additional searches with tblastn (<a href=\"#bib1\">Altschul et al., 1997</a>) were used to identify eventually misannotated homologues in some genomes. Because it is unclear which bacterial phylum is closest to the Firmicutes, we included as outgroup 13 taxa representatives of eight major bacterial phyla (2 Actinobacteria; 2 Cyanobacteria; 1 Deinococcus; 2 Proteobacteria; 1 Spirochaetes; 3 Flavobacteria/Bacteroidetes/Chlorobi; 2 Plactomyces/Chlamydia).

Profile-based homology searches of specific OM markers were performed by using the HMMER package (<a href=\"#bib32\">Johnson et al., 2010</a>). Initial searches were conducted by HMM on the local Firmicute genome databank by using standard Pfam domain models corresponding to a given protein of interest. The top-scoring hits were used to build new HMM models and perform a novel search. This process was iterated until no new hits were found. The resulting homologues were aligned and manually inspected in order to confirm homology and to\u00a0eliminate divergent, partial or non-homologous sequences. Additional searches with tblastn (<a href=\"#bib1\">Altschul et al., 1997</a>) were used to identify eventually misannotated homologues in some genomes. Protein domains were inspected by querying the Conserved Domain Database (CDD) at NCBI (<a href=\"#bib44\">Marchler-Bauer et al., 2015</a>). Genomic synteny was investigated using the interactive web-based visualization tool SyntTax (<a href=\"#bib53\">Oberto, 2013</a>). Local genomic alignments were generated using EasyFig (<a href=\"#bib70\">Sullivan et al., 2011</a>) with a BLAST cutoff E-value of 0.0001. For localization prediction, we used the PSORT v3.0 server (<a href=\"http://www.psort.org/psortb/\">http://www.psort.org/psortb/</a>, <a href=\"#bib84\">Yu et al., 2010</a>) with default settings for Gram-negative Bacteria.

One factor for which there was consensus is that the paper does not do a thorough enough job of discussing the differences in this paper compared to previous papers on the same general topic. Thus if this paper is revised we recommend that the authors make a more thorough comparison to prior work including a comparison of phylogenetic results, statistical support for results, and inferences about the evolution of diderms and monoderms. This should include a discussion of the papers referenced in the reviews (e.g., Jensen, Tocheva et al. 2011, Errington 2013, Vollmer 2011, Yutin and Galperin 2013) and others to cover the history of theories on this topic and also a paper just published recently \"Evolutionary relationships of completely sequenced Clostridia species and close relatives\" see <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2641069\">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2641069</a>.

Furthermore, the authors show that like classical gram-negative bacteria these taxa retain a number of the molecular machines that function with the outer membrane in 'diderm' bacteria. Their phylogenetic positions, as assessed by a 47 ribosomal protein super-matrix, indicate that they emerge from within two distinct clades in the Firmicutes suggesting that the 'monoderm' nature of other Firmicutes has evolved multiple times from 'diderm' firmicute ancestors. The authors go on to describe features of the outer membrane which must be ancestral to Firmicutes and lost separately in the monoderm members (flagellar genes, LPS genes and pilus genes). These are extremely interesting findings and are important contributions to the understanding of bacterial genome and cell evolution."

However, these days there is a lot of talk about lateral gene transfer in bacterial genome evolution and I think it is important to do some kind of analyses to show that the authors believe that all of these proteins have evolved 'vertically' \u2013 i.e. demonstrate that their single phylogenies are generally congruent with each other. There are a number of published methods to do this rigourously that are very involved (e.g. as reviewed by Leigh et al. (2011) Genome Biol. Evol. 3:571-87). However I think simpler methods could also be used. For example, the authors could report the proportion of genes in the concatenate that support each of the splits in the ML tree that they show. They could also check to see whether any of the single gene trees conflict with the concatenated tree with &gt;70% bootstrap support for the conflicting split. Another measure that the authors could consider is 'internode certainty' (IC) that has recently been extended to the case where single gene trees do not contain all taxa of the full tree (i.e. deal with missing data) \u2013 see Kobert et al. (2016) Mol. Biol. Evol. (advanced access); this method has been implemented in RAxML and could be easily applied to the data set."

If they are bootstrap values, then the fact that they are sometimes quite a bit lower than the posterior probability should be acknowledged in the discussion of the phylogenetic positions of the Halanaerobiales and Negativicutes. For example, the latter taxa maybe 'nested' within the Clostridia implying many independent losses of LPS as shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, yet all of the backbone branches in the tree seem to be supported by very weak bootstrap values (if this values are what they seem to be). This is highly relevant to the discussion and should be mentioned. Specifically, the authors should specify a range of independent numbers of losses of LPS for <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b</a>. Furthermore, probably the authors should do topology tests (e.g. AU tests) to see if a 'basal' branching position of the Negativicutes within the Clostridia can be excluded statistically. I suspect not. It would also be useful to see bootstrap values on the LPS tree since posterior probabilities don't adequately capture the uncertainty in branching patterns."

However, these analyses are very similar to already published data and support published conclusions. In particular, previous phylogenetic analyses by Grant Jensen of the lps synthesis pathway, Omp85, TolC, and the flagellar genes <i>flgH</i> and <i>flgI</i> have already shown \"no evidence to suggest that recent lateral gene transfer played a role in its acquisition of an OM. The possibility of convergent evolution of the OM in the Veillonellaceae is ruled out by the presence of many unambiguous homologs of different subsystems associated with OM biogenesis and function in other Gram-negative phyla.\" Please refer to Figure S7 and the Discussion of Tocheva et al. 2011 Cell \"Peptidoglycan remodeling and conversion of an inner membrane into an outer membrane during sporulation\". A phylogenetic tree of the Omp85 analysis shows the relationship between all diderm phyla and the lack of relationship with any one particular diderm phylum indicating that the Omp85 in A. longum (member of Veillonellaceae/Negativicutes) is an ancient feature. This is exactly what Antunes et al. claim with their more extensive analysis and present the idea as novel. It is important to note that the following hypothesis was also put forward by Jensen and co-authors: \"We are only proposing that a single membraned last common ancestor of both Firmicutes and Gram-negatives possessed some primitive sporulation/phagocytotic-like ability, which gave rise to the OM. From this double-membraned sporulation ancestor many phyla could have diverged. Any one of these could have lost the OM and given rise to the Firmicutes. Other phyla could have lost the ability to sporulate at different times, giving rise to the current models of microbial phylogeny.\" These findings were further discussed and supported by reviews and articles written by Errinton 2013 Open Biol \"L-form bacteria, cell walls and the origins of life\", Vollmer 2011 Nat Chem Biol \"Bacterial outer membrane evolution via sporulation?\" and Yutin and Galperin 2013 Evniron Microbiol \"A genomic update on clostridial phylogeny: Gram-negative spores formers and other misplace clostridia.\""

Furthermore, the authors show that like classical gram-negative bacteria these taxa retain a number of the molecular machines that function with the outer membrane in 'diderm' bacteria. Their phylogenetic positions, as assessed by a 47 ribosomal protein super-matrix, indicate that they emerge from within two distinct clades in the Firmicutes suggesting that the 'monoderm' nature of other Firmicutes has evolved multiple times from 'diderm' firmicute ancestors.

There are a number of published methods to do this rigourously that are very involved (e.g. as reviewed by Leigh et al. (2011) Genome Biol. Evol. 3:571-87). However I think simpler methods could also be used. For example, the authors could report the proportion of genes in the concatenate that support each of the splits in the ML tree that they show. They could also check to see whether any of the single gene trees conflict with the concatenated tree with &gt;70% bootstrap support for the conflicting split. Another measure that the authors could consider is 'internode certainty' (IC) that has recently been extended to the case where single gene trees do not contain all taxa of the full tree (i.e. deal with missing data) \u2013 see Kobert et al. (2016) Mol. Biol. Evol. (advanced access); this method has been implemented in RAxML and could be easily applied to the data set.</i> "

To our knowledge, none of the previous analyses on the phylogeny of Firmicutes (and in general all recently published large-scale phylogenies) contain such individual gene congruence tests (see for example Yutin et al.; Kunisawa. etc.). However, we agree that such analyses can strengthen our results. It has to be noted, nevertheless, that no congruence test is perfect, in particular those based on strict topology comparison, and there is still much room for development of strategies and methodologies. Thank you for providing precise suggestions on possible software. We have used IC tests as they deal with different taxonomic sampling in the single gene datasets. Of course, ribosomal proteins being mostly small, the phylogenetic signal carried by each single marker is accordingly weak. As a result, most single gene trees were largely unresolved, and most topological differences among trees are likely due to stochastic errors rather than true incongruent signal. However, we found very few split conflicting with the concatenate tree at &gt;70% BV, as you suggested (IC&lt;1), and these do not concern any major high rank nodes, i.e. those leading to the monophyly of major classes and orders, which are important to our discussion.

Moreover, these four genes display conserved synteny across large taxonomic distances, strongly suggesting that they carry a congruent signal. Indeed, the resulting tree is fully consistent with the previous one based on 11 genes, and moreover it recovers monophyly of a few additional phyla. Congruence among the four markers was confirmed by IC tests, which showed no strong conflicting splits concerning the monophyly of major bacterial phyla at &gt;70% BV (now shown in <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

If they are bootstrap values, then the fact that they are sometimes quite a bit lower than the posterior probability should be acknowledged in the discussion of the phylogenetic positions of the Halanaerobiales and Negativicutes. For example, the latter taxa maybe 'nested' within the Clostridia implying many independent losses of LPS as shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, yet all of the backbone branches in the tree seem to be supported by very weak bootstrap values (if this values are what they seem to be). This is highly relevant to the discussion and should be mentioned. Specifically, the authors should specify a range of independent numbers of losses of LPS for <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b</a>. Furthermore, probably the authors should do topology tests (e.g. AU tests) to see if a 'basal' branching position of the Negativicutes within the Clostridia can be excluded statistically.

We nevertheless ran AU tests with the LG site homogeneous model on 12 alternative topologies where Negativicutes or Halanaerobiales were moved \u201cup and down\u201d the n nodes separating them (N<sub>1</sub>-N<sub>6</sub> for the topologies involving moving the Negativicutes; H<sub>1</sub>-H<sub>6</sub> for the topologies moving the Halanaerobiales, <a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a> and supplementary data). These alternative topologies imply a range of losses from 2 to 5. The Bayesian topology (H<sub>0</sub>N<sub>0</sub>) was the preferred one (5 losses). Then, two topologies only could not be rejected by the data, where the Negativicutes branched a bit earlier in the Clostridia (N<sub>1</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>, implying 4 and 3 losses respectively). Importantly, the alternative topologies presenting monophyly of Halanaerobiales and Negativicutes for these ribosomal markers was strongly rejected, as well as all the topologies where the Halanaerobiales were moved away from the root of the Firmicute tree. This is consistent with the separate origins of the two diderm lineages, and with the hypothesis of a diderm ancestor for the Firmicutes.

The possibility of convergent evolution of the OM in the Veillonellaceae is ruled out by the presence of many unambiguous homologs of different subsystems associated with OM biogenesis and function in other Gram-negative phyla.\" Please refer to Figure S7 and the Discussion of Tocheva et al. 2011 Cell \"Peptidoglycan remodeling and conversion of an inner membrane into an outer membrane during sporulation\". A phylogenetic tree of the Omp85 analysis shows the relationship between all diderm phyla and the lack of relationship with any one particular diderm phylum indicating that the Omp85 in A. longum (member of Veillonellaceae/Negativicutes) is an ancient feature. This is exactly what Antunes et al. claim with their more extensive analysis and present the idea as novel. It is important to note that the following hypothesis was also put forward by Jensen and co-authors: \"We are only proposing that a single membraned last common ancestor of both Firmicutes and Gram-negatives possessed some primitive sporulation/phagocytotic-like ability, which gave rise to the OM. From this double-membraned sporulation ancestor many phyla could have diverged. Any one of these could have lost the OM and given rise to the Firmicutes. Other phyla could have lost the ability to sporulate at different times, giving rise to the current models of microbial phylogeny.\" These findings were further discussed and supported by reviews and articles written by Errinton 2013 Open Biol \"L-form bacteria, cell walls and the origins of life\", Vollmer 2011 Nat Chem Biol \"Bacterial outer membrane evolution via sporulation?\" and Yutin and Galperin 2013 Evniron Microbiol \"A genomic update on clostridial phylogeny: Gram-negative spores formers and other misplace clostridia.\"</i> "

According to the comments of the other two reviewers, we now give more detail in both the introduction and Results section on the analyses presented by Tocheva et al., as well as the other papers that dealt with the issue. However, we gently disagree with the claim that our analyses are very similar to the ones presented in that paper and do not provide any novel significant contribution. We present a lot of novel data that complement and extend previous studies including that of Tocheva et al. and provide much more robust results. To our knowledge, the only tree of an OM marker that was shown in Tocheva et al. was that of Omp85, while the other markers were only mentioned but not shown, so it is difficult to compare our results to theirs. In order to facilitate discussion and comparison with our results, we include in this response the Supplementary Figure S7 of Tocheva et al. that is mentioned above, for your convenience."
