In characterizing early transcriptional changes following drug treatment of mutant EGFR-addicted cells, we identified the stem cell transcriptional regulator SOX2 as being rapidly and specifically induced, both in vitro and in vivo. Suppression of SOX2 sensitizes cells to erlotinib-mediated apoptosis, ultimately decreasing the emergence of acquired resistance, whereas its ectopic expression reduces drug-induced cell death. We show that erlotinib relieves EGFR-dependent suppression of FOXO6, leading to its induction of SOX2, which in turn represses the pro-apoptotic BH3-only genes <i>BIM</i> and <i>BMF</i>. Together, these observations point to a physiological feedback mechanism that attenuates oncogene addiction-mediated cell death associated with the withdrawal of growth factor signaling and may therefore contribute to the development of resistance."
