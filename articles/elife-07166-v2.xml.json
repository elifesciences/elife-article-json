The jawless lampreys provide a unique opportunity to constrain the timing of this advance, as their line diverged \u223c505 Ma and later displayed high-morphological stability. We recorded with patch electrodes the inner segment photovoltages and with suction electrodes the outer segment photocurrents of <i>Lampetra fluviatilis</i> retinal photoreceptors. Several key functional features of jawed vertebrate rods are present in their phylogenetically homologous photoreceptors in lamprey: crucially, the efficient amplification of the effect of single photons, measured by multiple parameters, and the flow of rod signals into cones. These results make convergent evolution in the jawless and jawed vertebrate lines unlikely and indicate an early origin of rods, implying strong selective pressure toward dim-light vision in Cambrian ecosystems."

The rods allow us to see in dim light by amplifying weak light signals and transmitting information to other cells, including the cones themselves. It is thought that the rod cell evolved from the cone cell in the common ancestors of mammals, fish, and other animals with backbones and jaws at least 420 million years ago."

They have changed relatively little since that time so they provide a snapshot of what our ancestors' eyes might have been like back then. Like the rod and cone cells of jawed animals, the eyes of adult lampreys also have two types of photoreceptors. However, it was not clear whether the lamprey photoreceptor cells work in a similar way to rod and cone cells. Asteriti et al. collected lampreys in Sweden and France during their breeding season and used patch and suction electrodes to measure the activity of their photoreceptor cells. The experiments show that the short photoreceptor cells are more sensitive to light than the long photoreceptors and are able to amplify weak light signals. Also, the short photoreceptors send signals to the long photoreceptors in a similar way to how rod cells send information to cone cells."

Therefore, Asteriti et al. conclude that the ability to see in low light evolved before these groups of animals diverged about 505 million years ago. The picture that emerges is one in which our remote ancestors inhabiting the Cambrian seas already possessed dim-light vision. This would have allowed them to colonize deep waters or to move at twilight, an adaptation suggestive of intense competition or predation from other life forms."

Lampreys, the only surviving jawless vertebrates together with the related hagfish (<a href=\"#bib34\">Heimberg et al., 2010</a>), are a pivotal resource for gaining further insight into early vertebrate vision. In fact, their line diverged during the Cambrian (\u223c505 Ma [<a href=\"#bib21\">Erwin et al., 2011</a>]) and they later remained remarkably stable. This is true both of their external morphology, as revealed by fossil specimens (<a href=\"#bib37\">Janvier and Arsenault, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Gess et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Janvier et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Chang et al., 2014</a>), and of their anatomy, as demonstrated by primeval features such as the absence of bilateral limbs and of myelinated axons, and by their possession of the simplest nervous system among vertebrates. Adult lampreys have camera-type eyes with layered retinas containing all the major neuronal classes present in jawed vertebrates (<a href=\"#bib47\">Lamb, 2013</a>) and sending retinotopically organized projections to the tectum (<a href=\"#bib40\">Jones et al., 2009</a>), as well as a photosensory pineal organ (<a href=\"#bib68\">Pu and Dowling, 1981</a>). Researchers have debated the rod or cone nature of lamprey retinal photoreceptors since the middle of the 19th century (relevant literature reviewed by <a href=\"#bib80\">Walls, 1935</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Govardovskii and Lychakov, 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Collin et al., 2009</a>) to ascertain whether, in vertebrates, cones pre-dated rods or vice versa. Current molecular genetic evidence indicates that modern rods evolved from an ancestral cone (<a href=\"#bib62\">Okano et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Yokoyama, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Lamb et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Kawamura and Tachibanaki, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Shichida and Matsuyama, 2009</a>), implying that vision in near darkness is a relatively recent acquisition (<a href=\"#bib47\">Lamb, 2013</a>) and causing the point of contention to become that of the timing of rod evolutionary emergence. This advance must have occurred (<i>i</i>) after the appearance of the precursor of rhodopsin and of other rod-specific phototransduction proteins isoforms and (<i>ii</i>) before the initial diversification of extant jawed vertebrates (\u223c420 Ma; <a href=\"#bib21\">Erwin et al., 2011</a>) endowed with modern rods. Phylogenetic analysis of visual opsins constrains time bound <i>i</i> to have occurred anywhere between the divergence of ascidians (\u223c610 Ma; <a href=\"#bib21\">Erwin et al., 2011</a>) and that of the lamprey line (\u223c505 Ma; <a href=\"#bib21\">Erwin et al., 2011</a>): the sea squirt <i>Ciona intestinalis</i> has only one jawed vertebrate-related visual opsin (<a href=\"#bib44\">Kusakabe et al., 2001</a>), while some lamprey species have all five major classes (<a href=\"#bib82\">Yokoyama, 2000</a>) including an Rh1 rhodopsin ortholog (<a href=\"#bib67\">Pisani et al., 2006</a>) (but see <a href=\"#bib14\">Collin et al., 2003</a>). Recently, strong evidence has emerged indicating that these five opsin classes (and the rod-specific molecular toolbox) emerged in the context of two rounds of whole-genome duplication called \u20182R\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib43\">Kuraku et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Lagman et al., 2013</a>). Furthermore, analysis of the whole sea lamprey genome suggests that the lamprey line diverged from the main vertebrate line <i>shortly after</i> 2R (<a href=\"#bib76\">Smith et al., 2013</a>). Therefore, unveiling the functional properties of lamprey photoreceptors may shed light on the evolution of dim-light vision in the critical time period following 2R (<a href=\"#bib13\">Collin et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Lamb, 2013</a>)."

This nomenclature is based on the entire length of the photoreceptors that of the outer segments showing instead the reverse pattern. Importantly, SPs express an Rh1 rhodopsin ortholog (<a href=\"#bib67\">Pisani et al., 2006</a>) and some of their phototransduction protein isoforms examined thus far clade with those of rods (<a href=\"#bib58\">Muradov et al., 2008</a>), but they also have molecular and morphological features of cones including outer segment discs that appear continuous with the plasma membrane (<a href=\"#bib19\">Dickson and Graves, 1979</a>). Thus, while they retain archaic features of a cone progenitor, SPs are homologues of jawed vertebrate rods (<a href=\"#bib47\">Lamb, 2013</a>). LPs, on the other hand, express an LWS red cone opsin and have a molecular fingerprint consistent with cones (<a href=\"#bib58\">Muradov et al., 2008</a>). Here, we examined single lamprey photoreceptors at the levels of their inner and outer segments using two different recording techniques that provide complementary information, to establish the extent to which SPs operate like jawed vertebrate rods. We found multiple striking similarities that, taken together, argue against convergent evolution, implying that middle Cambrian vertebrates possessed functionally advanced rod precursors."

Input resistances were 518 \u00b1 41 M\u2126 (n = 8; SPs) and 442 \u00b1 68 M\u2126 (n = 9; LPs). The membrane time constants, obtained by fitting single exponentials to the early rise of a current step response, were 31.9 \u00b1 4.9 ms (n = 8; SPs) and 12.9 \u00b1 1.3 ms (n = 9; LPs) (p &lt; 0.001), equivalent to low-pass filtering with cut-off frequencies of \u223c5 Hz for SPs and \u223c12 Hz for LPs. Thus, the electrical properties of the inner segments of SPs seem adapted to process slower photocurrent changes than those of LPs.

The amplitudes of the flash responses from SPs were described by exponential saturation functions (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,E</a>). From the curves, we obtained a ratio of 4.4 \u00b1 0.9 (n = 5) for the sensitivities of these photoreceptors at 520 nm and 590 nm. This value is in reasonably good agreement with the ratio of 5.6 predicted by an 11A<sub>1</sub> visual pigment template (<a href=\"#bib29\">Govardovskii et al., 2000</a>) having a \u03bb<sub>max</sub> of 517 nm (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), the absorbance maximum of SP outer segments found with microspectrophotometry (<a href=\"#bib30\">Govardovskii and Lychakov, 1984</a>), and is thus consistent with the expression of an Rh1 visual pigment. For LPs, the flash responses displayed two components (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D,F</a>): the first component had kinetics, sensitivity, and spectral preference similar to SPs; the second component had faster kinetics, lower sensitivity, and a ratio of sensitivities at 520 nm and 590 nm of 1.1 \u00b1 0.04 (n = 6). This ratio agrees with the value of 1.1 predicted by an 11A<sub>1</sub> template (<a href=\"#bib29\">Govardovskii et al., 2000</a>), whose \u03bb<sub>max</sub> is set at 555 nm (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), the absorbance maximum of LP outer segments (<a href=\"#bib30\">Govardovskii and Lychakov, 1984</a>), consistent with their expression of an LWS pigment. It is likely that the first component of the flash response from LPs represents input from SPs, probably mediated by gap junctions; this arrangement would represent in lamprey retina an arrangement homologous to rod-cone coupling in jawed vertebrates (<a href=\"#bib3\">Asteriti et al., 2014</a>). In support of this interpretation, we observed with Lucifer Yellow injection thin <i>telodendria</i> emanating from the synaptic pole of the photoreceptors and extending laterally into the inner plexiform layer (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>): the only known function of these processes in jawed vertebrates is that of forming inter-photoreceptor junctional contacts (<a href=\"#bib61\">O'Brien et al., 2012</a>). We attempted to uncouple these cells pharmacologically with MFA (100 \u00b5M) or 2-APB (10\u201320 \u00b5M), known blockers of retinal gap junctions, but unfortunately these agents produced marked non-specific effects (not shown)."

We thus wondered whether some of the visual pigment in our preparations might have been in a bleached state (i.e., devoid of its light-sensing chromophore). Clarifying this point was a crucial prerequisite to our subsequent assessment of single photon processing by SPs, for reasons explained in the rest of this paragraph. In jawed vertebrates, bleached rod and cone opsins constitutively activate the phototransductive cascade at a very low rate (<a href=\"#bib15\">Cornwall and Fain, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Cornwall et al., 1995</a>). Due to this property in rods, in which pigment regeneration is much slower than in cones, bleaches of even a small fraction of the total pigment pool caused by bright light lead to a significant and long-lasting desensitization, which is much larger than what is expected from the simple decrease in light-sensitive visual pigment molecules (<a href=\"#bib25\">Fain et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Lamb and Pugh, 2004</a>). Bleaching desensitization thus leads to a reduction in phototransduction gain, and therefore, in the single photon response amplitude. Assuming that lamprey opsins behave similarly to those of jawed vertebrates, the possible presence of bleached visual pigment in our experiments (see above) raises the possibility that SPs were desensitized relative to their full potential."

The sensitivity at 520 nm of two SPs, recorded both in control and during delivery of 9-cis-Retinal, increased by 2.0 and 2.5-fold (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Moreover, sensitivity was higher (p &lt; 0.01) in regenerated than in control SPs: half-maximal response at 520 nm evoked with flashes (<i>i</i><sub><i>1/2</i></sub>) of 63 \u00b1 11 photons\u00b7\u00b5m<sup>\u22122</sup> (n = 12; regenerated) vs 149 \u00b1 25 photons\u00b7\u00b5m<sup>\u22122</sup> (n = 10; control). Thus, some of the visual pigment molecules in SP outer segments were indeed bleached. The ratio of sensitivities at 520 and 590 nm did not differ significantly (p = 0.42) between regenerated and control SPs: 5.6 \u00b1 1.0 (n = 5; regenerated) vs 4.4 \u00b1 0.9 (n = 5; control). To test whether such bleaching was associated to desensitization, we examined dim-flash integration time (<a href=\"#bib39\">Jones et al., 1996</a>). In one SP, integration time increased by 2.6-fold after superfusion with 9-cis-Retinal and the same parameter was significantly higher (p &lt; 0.001) in regenerated than in control SPs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>): 0.81 \u00b1 0.14 s (n = 9; regenerated) vs 0.32 \u00b1 0.05 s (n = 13; control).

Specifically, the ratio of sensitivities at 520 and 590 nm went from 1.1 to 1.7 in the single LP treated with 9-cis-Retinal (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, compare large and small circles) and was significantly higher (p &lt; 0.01) in regenerated than in control LPs: 1.8 \u00b1 0.1 (n = 7; regenerated) vs 1.1 \u00b1 0.04 (n = 6; control)."

Regenerated SPs were highly sensitive, with absolute and fractional dim-flash sensitivities in patch clamp of 0.61 \u00b1 0.17 mV\u00b7photons<sup>\u22121</sup>\u00b7\u00b5m<sup>2</sup> (n = 8) and 3.0 \u00b1 0.6%\u00b7photons<sup>\u22121</sup>\u00b7\u00b5m<sup>2</sup> (n = 8). We obtained a first estimate of their fractional single photon response of 2.6 \u00b1 0.5%\u00b7R<sup>* \u22121</sup> (n = 8) by dividing the fractional dim-flash sensitivity with a theoretical effective collecting area of 1.18 \u00b5m<sup>2</sup>\u00b7R<sup>*</sup>\u00b7photons<sup>\u22121</sup> (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). A search for quantal responses using the patch-clamp technique proved inconclusive, as also observed in similar recordings of photoreceptors from those jawed vertebrates having extensively coupled rods (<a href=\"#bib24\">Fain, 1975</a>). We thus performed suction electrode photocurrent recordings from the conical outer segments of SPs, in retinae pretreated with 9-cis-Retinal (100 \u00b5M for 20\u201325 min): this recording technique only measures the current flowing through the membrane enclosed in the pipette and is thus ideally suited to examine phototransduction in a given photoreceptor without an appreciable contribution of its electrically coupled neighbors (<a href=\"#bib6\">Baylor et al., 1979a</a>). Under these conditions, responses to repeated delivery of dim flashes were highly variable in amplitude (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). We estimated the absolute amplitude of the single photon response (<i>a</i>) to be 0.41 \u00b1 0.04 pA (n = 10), by dividing the increase in the time-dependent variance by the mean response for each SP (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib71\">Rieke and Baylor, 1998</a>) (for details on the use of variance analysis in single photon response estimation see the \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). The normalized time-dependent squared mean responses and variance increases overlapped (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib71\">Rieke and Baylor, 1998</a>), consistent with the single photon responses being governed by Poisson statistics. The fractional amplitude of the single photon response (<i>a</i><sub><i>%</i></sub>), determined for each SP on the basis of its maximal response to a single saturating flash delivered prior to the dim flash trains, was 2.6 \u00b1 0.3%\u00b7R<sup>* \u22121</sup> (n = 10), in line with the independent estimate obtained with patch (see above). Lastly, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), determined for each SP as the ratio of <i>a</i> over the standard deviation of the biological component of dark noise measured between consecutive dim flashes (0.5\u201320 Hz), was 1.5 \u00b1 0.1 (n = 10). Importantly, the values of <i>a</i>, <i>a</i><sub><i>%</i></sub>, and SNR in SPs are within the range reported for jawed vertebrate rods (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). In these experiments, we: (<i>i</i>) recorded only from intact outer segments (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, inset), (<i>ii</i>) observed similar dark currents (maximum current change with a saturating flash) with patch clamp (13 \u00b1 3 pA, n = 4) and suction electrodes (16 \u00b1 1 pA, n = 10), and (<i>iii</i>) measured similar collecting areas (0.83 \u00b1 0.17 \u00b5m<sup>2</sup>\u00b7R<sup>*</sup>\u00b7photons<sup>\u22121</sup>, n = 10; ratio of the squared mean response over the product of the variance increase and the flash strength [<a href=\"#bib71\">Rieke and Baylor, 1998</a>]) to theoretical prediction (1.18 \u00b5m<sup>2</sup>\u00b7R<sup>*</sup>\u00b7photons<sup>\u22121</sup>). From this, it is highly likely that we had complete suction of the outer segment, and as such, we could make reliable estimates of <i>a</i><sub><i>%</i></sub> and SNR."

A similar conclusion can be made for bleaching adaptation, which we confirmed to be present in SPs. In jawed vertebrates, this phenomenon is the result of a very low-constitutive activity of free opsin and occurs in both rods and cones exposed to bleaching lights (<a href=\"#bib15\">Cornwall and Fain, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Cornwall et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Fain et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Lamb and Pugh, 2004</a>). To assess whether SPs, the phylogenetic homologues of rods (<a href=\"#bib67\">Pisani et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Muradov et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Lamb, 2013</a>), also operate like rods, we focused on multiple properties both at the level of single photon detection in the outer segment and of downstream signal processing in the inner segment. The rationale behind this approach is that, even if individual functional parameters of SPs and rods could have evolved independently towards a common present state (convergent evolution), this becomes quite unlikely if multiple common features are observed."

The likely anatomical substrate of this signal crossover is represented by the thin telodendrial processes that we observed to extend laterally from the synaptic pole of the photoreceptors. Telodendria are ubiquitous in jawed vertebrates and their only known function is to form gap junctional contacts with nearby photoreceptors (<a href=\"#bib61\">O'Brien et al., 2012</a>). While in mammals these processes are known to extend only from cone pedicles, in cold-blooded vertebrates they are also formed by rods (<a href=\"#bib23\">Fadool, 2003</a>). Since rod-cone coupling is thought to provide a secondary route for rod signals when the high-gain output synapse of rods is saturated (<a href=\"#bib4\">Attwell et al., 1987</a>), the question arises of whether lamprey SPs have properties of synaptic transmission similar to those of rods and a dedicated postsynaptic circuitry for scotopic signaling. Furthermore, in mammalian photoreceptors, the I<sub>h</sub> current has been proposed to assist rod-cone signaling via gap junctions (<a href=\"#bib74\">Seeliger et al., 2011</a>), a role it could also play in the lamprey retina given the presence of telodendria and SP\u2013LP signal flow."

Here, it is important to note that while the fractional single photon response <i>a</i><sub><i>%</i></sub> and the SNR are potentially subject to overestimation due to the fact that their denominators (the circulating current in darkness for <i>a</i><sub><i>%</i></sub> and the biological dark noise for the SNR) appear smaller if the outer segment is damaged or is not fully within the recording pipette (see however the evidence above that these conditions were respected in our experiments), this issue does not exist when estimating the absolute amplitude <i>a</i>."

Recent evidence indicates that the lamprey line diverged <i>soon after</i> (<a href=\"#bib76\">Smith et al., 2013</a>) the occurrence of two rounds of whole-genome duplication in stem vertebrates (2R) (<a href=\"#bib17\">Dehal and Boore, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Putnam et al., 2008</a>), which led to the diversification of the ancestral visual opsin and phototransduction protein repertoire (<a href=\"#bib46\">Lagman et al., 2013</a>). Therefore, dim-light vision appears to have been acquired rapidly once a dedicated set of genes became available for specializing a type of cone into the rod (<a href=\"#bib62\">Okano et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Yokoyama, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Lamb et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Kawamura and Tachibanaki, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Shichida and Matsuyama, 2009</a>). Admittedly, one cannot definitively exclude that such performance was refined independently in the two branches following their split \u223c505 Ma (<a href=\"#bib21\">Erwin et al., 2011</a>): to do so, one would need to resurrect (<a href=\"#bib77\">Thornton, 2004</a>) the full ancestral phototransductive cascade and then characterize its function. However, our data provide compelling support for the view that the evolution of the modern rod was already well under way at the time of divergence of the two branches: (<i>i</i>) the similarities between SPs and rods are multiple and extend from phototransduction to downstream processing, (<i>ii</i>) the photoreceptors specialized for scotopic vision in lampreys and in jawed vertebrates derive from one and the same precursor (and not from different ancestral cones), (<i>iii</i>) some of the phototransduction protein isoforms examined thus far in SPs clade with those of rods. This newly evolved ability to operate in dim light would have provided a significant advantage to early vertebrates faced with intense competition in a rapidly evolving ecological landscape (<a href=\"#bib66\">Paterson et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Lacalli, 2012</a>)."

In the fitting procedure, the brightest saturating flashes delivered to SPs were excluded since they showed diminishing response amplitudes due to incomplete recovery from the previous flash in the 13-s interval used in our protocols. Since the low-sensitivity response component of LPs untreated with 9-cis-Retinal did not reach saturation with the flash strengths used in this study, fits were performed (<i>i</i>) by using the saturating amplitude observed after delivery of 9-cis-Retinal (when this was available) or (<i>ii</i>) by assuming a conservative saturating amplitude of 16 mV (i.e., the smallest value observed in LPs). The second assumption implies that we likely underestimated the half-maximal flash strength of unregenerated LPs (low-sensitivity component). Precise estimates of SP dim-flash sensitivity were obtained by dividing the amplitude of the mean response to many dim flashes by the strength of these flashes."

Specifically, for each SP, the <i>net</i> mean response and time-dependent variance were calculated, from an ensemble of at least 50-dim flashes, as follows: (<i>i</i>) the <i>gross</i> mean response and variance were calculated after aligning the raw flash response records by subtracting their average value in the 1.1-s interval before the flash; (<i>ii</i>) the mean and variance in darkness were calculated from the 2-s interval prior to each flash, again after aligning the raw dark records by subtracting their average value in the first 1.1 s; (<i>iii</i>) the <i>net</i> mean response and variance were obtained by subtracting those in darkness from the <i>gross</i> ones, and therefore, include only the first 0.9 s after the flash: this, however, was sufficient to encompass the peak of the dim-flash response (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). In those SPs in which dim flashes of two strengths were delivered, the final estimate of <i>a</i> was the average of the two separate estimates, weighed by their respective number of flashes. As in other rod studies in which <i>a</i> was small relative to total recorded dark noise, we could not perform a reliable analysis of the single photon response with amplitude histograms (notably, only 6 of the 26 estimates of <i>a</i> plotted in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a> included histogram analysis). However, when both the variance and histogram techniques were employed, similar values of <i>a</i> were found (<a href=\"#bib7\">Baylor et al., 1979b</a>, <a href=\"#bib9\">1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Vogalis et al., 2011</a>). Biological dark noise was taken as the square root of the difference between the recorded dark noise variance (integral within 0.5\u201320 Hz of the average power spectrum in the 2.1 s before the dim flashes) and the expected thermal noise variance (<a href=\"#bib7\">Baylor et al., 1979b</a>, <a href=\"#bib9\">1984</a>) (using the measured pipette seal resistance). The amplification constant of phototransduction was estimated by fitting the rising phase of the average dim-flash response with Equation 23 in <a href=\"#bib69\">Pugh and Lamb (1993)</a>. For these fits, a delay t<sub>eff</sub> of 23 ms was used, which was separately estimated by fitting Equation 20 in <a href=\"#bib69\">Pugh and Lamb (1993)</a> to full families of flash responses. The average number of photoisomerizations/flash was a result of the single photon response analysis."

In addition, the statement that bleached opsin is key determinant of the very slow time course of dark adaptation is misleading. Dark adaptation is regulated by the regeneration of visual pigment and the supply of chromophore (e.g. Lamb TD, Pugh EN Jr. Prog Retin Eye Res. 2004 23:307-80), which occur significantly slower for rods than for cones."

Otherwise, the authors would come across as trivializing the phenomenon of bleaching adaptation (whereas it is in fact far from trivial). For LP cells, having done just one experiment is also unacceptable. In any case, what is the bottom line of this section in relation to the overall paper?

The problem is that rods and cones cannot be defined as clearly as the authors indicate. Ancestral photoreceptor cell types may be guessed from those of present-day lampreys, hagfishes, sea-squirts and lancelets, but we really don't know what they actually looked like. Photoreceptor cells in these modern organisms are the evolutionary products of the geological time scale and can differ significantly from those of their ancestors. The oft-discussed <i>Anolis carolinensis</i> with supposedly pure-cone retinas and <i>Gekko gecko</i> with presumably pure-rod retinas express \u201ctypical\u201d rod- and cone-specific pigments, respectively.
