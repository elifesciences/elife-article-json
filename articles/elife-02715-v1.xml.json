Pairs of heads move along microtubules (yellow cylinders) towards the plus end. The \u03b1-helices intertwine in a parallel coiled coil structure, and they swap partners in the BASS domain, which plays a key role in making the motor protein work. Scholey et al. have determined the structure of the BASS domain (shown here by the multicoloured helices, which are taken from Figure 2 of <a href=\"#bib8\">Scholey et al., 2014</a>). When kinesin-5 is attached to only one microtubule (top), the structure of the BASS domain discovered by Scholey et al. predicts that the two ends of the tetramer are rotated by 90\u00b0. When kinesin-5 motors slide antiparallel microtubules apart (bottom), the motor domains must also be antiparallel to each other. The resulting torque in the attached tetramer might help to flag the mutual binding state and turn the motor on. The twist that would have to occur in the tetramer in this situation is not shown as it is not known where it would be localised."

This is primarily because it turned out to be difficult to crystallize and, possibly, because researchers expected it to be a rather boring \u03b1-helical coiled coil. However, the many roles that the stalk performs require a more complex structure. The stalk needs to transmit tensile force between the two pairs of heads when they move apart on their respective microtubule tracks. It also needs to provide torsional rigidity to orient the heads properly (<a href=\"#bib10\">van den Wildenberg et al., 2008</a>). Last, but not least, it needs to be able to convey mechanical signals between the two heads. Now, in <i>eLife</i>, Jawdat Al-Bassam of the University of California, Davis and co-workers\u2014Jessica Scholey and Stanley Nithianantham, as joint first authors, and Jon Scholey\u2014report that the central part of the stalk of a kinesin-5 motor contains an unexpected and intriguing structural element called a bipolar assembly (BASS) domain (<a href=\"#bib8\">Scholey et al., 2014</a>)."

The \u03b1-helices of the motors switch partners, jumping from a parallel partner coil to an antiparallel partner coil at precisely defined locations to again form a tetramer. The two opposing coils in a pair, and the two pairs themselves, interact by a precisely engineered pattern of seven alternating hydrophobic and ionic patches over a record length of 26 nm: this is the longest helical minifilament structure determined to date. Mutational analysis shows that the precise arrangement of these patches is necessary to form the tetramer."

Compressional forces immediately lead to the stalks buckling."

This implies that the heads would also be twisted by 90\u00b0 with respect to each other when viewed along the long axis of the tetramer (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Scholey et al. speculate that this particular geometry, taken together with the expected high torsional stiffness of the whole structure, might explain why kinesin-5 prefers to bundle and move antiparallel microtubules."

                        "text": "Like the whole process of cell division, the activity of kinesin-5 motors must be tightly regulated as the cell divides to make sure that nothing goes wrong. Some regulatory mechanisms have been observed. It was found, for example, that certain kinesin-5 motors only become active and move when both ends are connected to a microtubule, and only when those two microtubules are antiparallel (<a href=\"#bib4\">Kapitein et al., 2008</a>). Even more intriguingly, a kinesin-5 from budding yeast switches its direction of motion when reaching an antiparallel overlap zone (<a href=\"#bib2\">Gerson-Gurwitz et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Roostalu et al., 2011</a>). It is therefore tempting to speculate further on the ways that this motor protein works."

This should cause torsional stress and strain that might serve as a mechanism to turn on the motors or, in the case of the yeast, to change direction. Since torsional stress can be transmitted even along a rod that is flexible to bending, as seen in the cable of a dentist\u2019s drill, such a mechanism could explain how signalling occurs over the extraordinarily long distances seen in the kinesin-5 motors. If this model is correct, it leads to an interesting prediction: when two microtubules are connected by a single kinesin-5 motor they should spontaneously orient at 90\u00b0. If an external force is then used to change this angle to 180\u00b0, the motor should turn on. This prediction could be tested in experiments that use optical tweezers to apply the external force."

If the antiparallel coupling of two motor monomers is rapid and strong, and is then followed by two of those dimers joining into a tetramer, it would explain why the formation of tetramers is so efficient. It would also explain why a large sub-population of parallel dimers is not also created. Such dynamic consequences of the newly discovered surprising structure of the motor stalks will have to be explored in future experiments."
