                    "text": "Many animal species, including insects, are capable of acoustic duetting, a complex social behavior in which males and females tightly control the rate and timing of their courtship song syllables relative to each other. The mechanisms underlying duetting remain largely unknown across model systems. Most studies of duetting focus exclusively on acoustic interactions, but the use of multisensory cues should aid in coordinating behavior between individuals. To test this hypothesis, we develop <i>Drosophila virilis</i> as a new model for studies of duetting. By combining sensory manipulations, quantitative behavioral assays, and statistical modeling, we show that <i>virilis</i> females combine precisely timed auditory and tactile cues to drive song production and duetting. Tactile cues delivered to the abdomen and genitalia play the larger role in females, as even headless females continue to coordinate song production with courting males. These data, therefore, reveal a novel, non-acoustic, mechanism for acoustic duetting. Finally, our results indicate that female-duetting circuits are not sexually differentiated, as males can also produce \u2018female-like\u2019 duets in a context-dependent manner."

The mechanisms underlying duetting remain largely unknown across model systems. Most studies of duetting focus exclusively on acoustic interactions, but the use of multisensory cues should aid in coordinating behavior between individuals. To test this hypothesis, we develop <i>Drosophila virilis</i> as a new model for studies of duetting. By combining sensory manipulations, quantitative behavioral assays, and statistical modeling, we show that <i>virilis</i> females combine precisely timed auditory and tactile cues to drive song production and duetting. Tactile cues delivered to the abdomen and genitalia play the larger role in females, as even headless females continue to coordinate song production with courting males. These data, therefore, reveal a novel, non-acoustic, mechanism for acoustic duetting. Finally, our results indicate that female-duetting circuits are not sexually differentiated, as males can also produce \u2018female-like\u2019 duets in a context-dependent manner."

                        "text": "Studies of acoustic communication focus on the production of acoustic signals by males and the arbitration of mating decisions by females. However, for many species of primates (<a href=\"#bib22\">Haimoff, 1986</a>), birds (<a href=\"#bib23\">Hall, 2004</a>), frogs (<a href=\"#bib58\">Tobias et al., 1998</a>), and insects (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bailey, 2003</a>), females also produce songs, and duets are common; moreover, recent studies suggest that female song production may be ancestral (<a href=\"#bib65\">Wiens, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Odom et al., 2014</a>). Animal duets involve predictable response latencies between the calls of males and females; that is, males and females do not sing simultaneously, as human duetters do, but rather interchange acoustic signals (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bailey and Hammond, 2003</a>). Duetting species can be grouped into two classes: those that answer their partner's song without fine-scale coordination of song syllables or elements (polyphonal duetters) and those that synchronize within a song bout (antiphonal duetters) (<a href=\"#bib24\">Hall, 2009</a>). Regardless of duet type, each individual must adjust the rate and timing of his/her courtship songs relative to each other. Therefore, duetting requires speed and accuracy in both detection of a partner's signal and the production of a response. Latencies between male and female songs are reported to be as short as tens of milliseconds for some birds (<a href=\"#bib32\">Logue et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Fortune et al., 2011</a>) and insects (<a href=\"#bib25\">Heller and von Helversen, 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Rheinlaender et al., 1986</a>). For example, the antiphonal duets of plain-tailed wrens are so rapid that they sound as if produced by a single animal (<a href=\"#bib34\">Mann et al., 2006</a>). Both male and female wrens display differences in inter-syllable intervals when singing alone vs with a partner, indicating that sensory perception plays an ongoing role in shaping song timing (<a href=\"#bib19\">Fortune et al., 2011</a>). In support of this, recordings from pre-motor areas of the wren brain (HVC) reveal auditory responses that are tuned to duets (<a href=\"#bib19\">Fortune et al., 2011</a>); that is, neural centers that drive song production also directly integrate auditory information. For polyphonal duetting bushcrickets, which like many insects produce sounds via their wings, auditory information is transmitted not only to the brain but also directly to wing-controlling neural ganglia; thus, similar to birds, this suggests that song pattern-generating circuits (housed in these ganglia) directly integrate auditory information to shape duets (<a href=\"#bib47\">Rheinlaender et al., 1986</a>)."

                        "text": "While auditory perception appears to play an important role in producing duets, no studies to date have investigated a role for non-acoustic cues. However, for many other behaviors, the use of multisensory cues is proposed to improve signal detection (<a href=\"#bib51\">Rowe, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Mirjany et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">McMeniman et al., 2014</a>), synchronization (<a href=\"#bib14\">Elliott et al., 2010</a>), or decision-making abilities (<a href=\"#bib30\">Kulahci et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Raposo et al., 2012</a>). For example, mosquitos locating human hosts rely on both thermal and olfactory cues; this dual requirement increases the fidelity of host-seeking (<a href=\"#bib36\">McMeniman et al., 2014</a>). Similarly, bees have been shown to make faster and more accurate-foraging decisions when choosing between flowers that differ in multiple modalities (vs a single modality) (<a href=\"#bib30\">Kulahci et al., 2008</a>). These studies (and others) lend support to the idea that acoustic-duetting behaviors, which are under tight temporal control, might also benefit from the use of multimodal sensory processing. Moreover, because many species produce songs that are not stereotyped (<a href=\"#bib29\">Kovach et al., 2014</a>), the use of multiple sensory cues should aid in response timing."

                        "text": "To test this hypothesis, we developed <i>Drosophila virilis</i> as a new model system for the study of acoustic coordination. Song production (via wing vibration) is an integral component of the courtship ritual among Drosophilid flies (<a href=\"#bib15\">Ewing and Bennet-Clark, 1968</a>), but typically, as in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, only males produce song (<a href=\"#bib12\">Dickson, 2008</a>). The presence of female song has been reported in only a handful of <i>Drosophila</i> species (<a href=\"#bib13\">Donegan and Ewing, 1980</a>), and it is not known if any of these species duet. Here, by combining a battery of specific sensory manipulations, quantification of a large number of courtship songs, and statistical modeling, we not only show that <i>D. virilis</i> males and females duet but also uncover the underlying mechanisms. We find that females integrate both auditory (male song) and tactile (male contact with her abdomen and genitalia) cues for song production and coordination. Moreover, the precise timing of male tactile cues predicts female song timing, revealing a novel, non-acoustic, mechanism for acoustic coordination. Finally, we also address the importance of male and female song production for courtship success, and demonstrate, by comparing duets produced in male\u2013male pairings, that acoustic-duetting behavior in females is not sexually differentiated."

By combining video and audio recordings, we matched <i>D. virilis</i> male and female wing movements with acoustic signals to accurately classify male and female song (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A\u2013C</a> and <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). We recorded song in a multi-channel recording apparatus (<a href=\"#bib1\">Arthur et al., 2013</a>). We chose <i>virilis</i> strain 15010\u20131051.47, because males and females of this strain sang robustly in our courtship chambers (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Consistent with previous reports (<a href=\"#bib26\">Huttunen et al., 2008</a>), we found that <i>virilis</i> males (when paired with a virgin female) produce highly stereotyped bouts of pulses via unilateral wing vibration (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,D</a>). We define a bout as a stretch of song from either a male or female, which is separated from the next stretch of song by more than 150 ms. Each male bout contains 6.9 \u00b1 1.2 pulses with an inter-pulse interval (IPI) of 21.2 \u00b1 1.9 ms (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). Females (when paired with a virgin male), in contrast, use bilateral wing vibration to generate variable-length bouts of pulses separated by longer (and more variable) IPIs (7.2 \u00b1 6.2 pulses per bout, with IPIs of 55.2 \u00b1 26.3 ms) (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). The frequency spectra of individual male pulses show a peak at higher frequencies relative to individual female pulses (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>).

To determine if <i>virilis</i> males and females duet during their courtship ritual, we characterized response times between male bouts (which are highly stereotyped, see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>) and female pulses and vice versa. The distribution of female response times (relative to the onset of a male bout) is peaked at 409 ms and is significantly different from the distribution of response times calculated from randomized versions of the data set in which either male bout times or female pulse times were shuffled (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a> and see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). Thus, female song is temporally coordinated with male song. Male response times to female song have not been examined previously in any insect. We calculated the delay between the onset of male bouts and the center of each pulse in the preceding female bout (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Male response times to the first, second, penultimate, and last pulse in a female bout were all significantly different from response times from randomized data, with responses to the last pulse showing the largest difference (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). We, therefore, defined male response times as the latency between the onset of the male bout and the previous female pulse (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>) and found that the distribution of male response times is peaked at short delays (110 ms), compared with female response times (even when accounting for differences in how response times are calculated for males and females). To the best of our knowledge, these data represent the first quantitative evidence of acoustic duetting in a Drosophilid species."

Intact females maintained their response timing in pairings with arista-cut (AC) males (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, peak at 407 ms); however, song bouts from AC males no longer followed female pulses with a predictable response latency (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). Instead, AC male response times were not significantly different from response times from randomized versions of the data (p = 0.24). This effect was specific to response timing, because AC males maintained wild-type (WT) levels of song production (Figure 4B, manipulation 3), and showed no change in inter-bout interval (IBI) or pulse frequency (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Thus, males rely on hearing their partner's song for acoustic coordination. In contrast, AC females paired with intact males maintained coordination (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>, peak at 408 ms), even though this manipulation caused an up-regulation in song production (Figure 4E, manipulation 3) and a shift in IPI and pulse frequency (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). This result suggests that females may use a non-auditory cue to coordinate song production with their partner."

Removal of either appendage did not reduce courtship rates (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). However, removing either the production of male song (in pairings between WT females and wing-cut (WC) males) or the detection of male song (in pairings between WT males and AC females) dramatically reduced the percentage of copulating pairs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). These results indicate that male song is required for mating success, consistent with data from other closely related species (<a href=\"#bib2\">Aspi and Hoikkala, 1993</a>). Because females increase song production rates (a parameter distinct from IPI, see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019) in the absence of male song (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), increased female song production might cause the observed decrease in copulation rates.

However, deaf males, which cannot detect female song, still copulated at WT rates when paired with WT females (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, light blue solid vs light\u00a0blue dashed control). Because <i>virilis</i> females indicate their receptivity via wing spreading (<a href=\"#bib64\">Vuoristo et al., 1996</a>), deaf males may use this visual signal (produced by intact females) to drive mating in the absence of acoustic cues. To prevent males from observing female wing spreading, we allowed deaf males to court WT females in the dark and subsequently observed a 29% reduction in copulation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, black solid vs black dashed control, p = 0.08). The lack of significance of the reduction in courtship success may be due to the ability of males to still detect female wing spreading in the dark (e.g., using mechanosensation). Because AC males do not coordinate their song production with females (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>) but still maintain high-copulation success (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>), our data also suggest that females don't require coordinated duetting for mating when paired with a single male. Duetting, however, may be important for mate selection in the context of competition as has been suggested for other insects and some species of birds (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bailey, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Hall, 2004</a>)."

To test this hypothesis, we compared courtship success and song production rates (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019) of virgin females and mated females. Mated <i>D. melanogaster</i> females show a reduction in copulation rates following mating; this is due to the effects of a sex peptide transferred from males to females during copulation (<a href=\"#bib62\">Villella and Hall, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Yapici et al., 2008</a>). Similarly, we found that mated <i>virilis</i> females show significantly lower copulation rates (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). We, therefore, investigated the association between song production and state of the female. Both virgin <i>virilis</i> males and females sang more if they copulated within the 30-min experimental window vs if they did not copulate (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). After correcting for this difference (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019), we still observed a significant reduction in song production in mated <i>virilis</i> females compared with virgin females (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>); this reduction was specific to female song, as males who courted mated vs virgin females produced similar amounts of song. Finally, we observed that <i>virilis</i> females, on average, increased song production over the 400 s leading to copulation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). These data collectively argue that female song production (and therefore duetting) is not required for mating, but rather is a positive cue that promotes mating."

We next examined the sensory stimuli and pathways that influence male bout and female pulse rates in <i>D. virilis</i>. We examined the rate of male bouts and female pulses, because male bouts are highly stereotyped while female bouts are not (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>); see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 for a description of how song rates were calculated. We manipulated sensory structures relevant for courtship (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a> and see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019) and used statistical modeling to predict song rates from data sets containing all possible combinations of sensory organ manipulations to the male or female (each paired with a WT partner). Based on the interactions we observed in videos of <i>virilis</i> courtship (<a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>), we manipulated the following sensory structures: (i) aristae (to block the detection of acoustic signals [<a href=\"#bib21\">Gopfert and Robert, 2002</a>]), (ii) antennae (to block the detection of volatile pheromones [<a href=\"#bib6\">Benton, 2007</a>]), (iii) tarsi (to block the detection of contact pheromones [<a href=\"#bib57\">Thistle et al., 2012</a>]), and (iv) female genitalia (to block male contact with the lower abdomen, which is known to be important for <i>D. virilis</i> courtship [<a href=\"#bib64\">Vuoristo et al., 1996</a>]; see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). To block visual cues, we placed flies in the dark. We used generalized linear models (GLMs) to predict male or female song rates based on the sensory manipulations (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). The GLM weights or coefficients reveal the contribution of each sensory channel to song production. We first fit the GLM to data from pairings between manipulated males and WT females and found that bilateral removal of the male tarsi was the only significant predictor of male bout rate (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This result contrasts with results from <i>D. melanogaster</i>, where tarsal removal enhances courtship activity in males (<a href=\"#bib17\">Fan et al., 2013</a>). We also found that sensory organ manipulation of males has similar effects on female song production (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), suggesting that either female song production is dependent on the presence of male song or that some male manipulations also impact sensory perception in females (for example, removal of male tarsi may block a mechanosensory cue to the female; see below)."

Removal of the aristae up-regulates female pulse rate (as does removing male song [<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>]), while blocking the female genitalia down-regulates pulse rate. These results establish a role for multisensory cues in female song rate and indicate that information sensed via the female genitalia and aristae is combined to fine-tune how much song the female produces. We, therefore, next focused on these two sensory pathways to test their role in regulating female song timing relative to her partner."

To further investigate the role of auditory cues in duetting, we examined female acoustic coordination with playback of recorded male song (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). Previous studies of the <i>D. virilis</i> species group showed that females respond to the playback of male song by spreading their wings (<a href=\"#bib49\">Ritchie et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Isoherranen et al., 1999</a>), but these studies did not characterize female song production. We were unable to detect any female song in response to either playback alone or to playback in the presence of a decapitated male that does not interact with the female (data not shown). However, females produced abundant song in the presence of a WC male (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). For these pairings, we calculated female response times relative to the playback stimulus and found the distribution to be significantly different from response times from shuffled data (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>, p &lt; 0.001). However, the distribution of female response times to playback does not resemble the WT distribution (compare with <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Due to issues (in only the playback experiments) with identifying female pulses that overlap with the male playback (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019), we also calculated female response times from the end of the male bout (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a> inset). We found that this distribution more closely matched the distribution of response times from shuffled data (although they are still significantly different, p &lt; 0.05). Additionally, we performed the same experiment with AC females and saw similar trends in response time curve shape and significance values (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). These results, therefore, suggest that auditory cues, when uncoupled with the male behavior, have little influence on female response timing (vs their influence on female song rate [<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>]). Any relationship between female song and the acoustic playback must be due to indirect effects on the WC male. We, therefore, hypothesized that another cue provided by the WC male influenced female song timing. To test the role of contact cues provided by the male, we next examined pairings between intact males and headless females."

From higher speed videos taken of the ventral side of the courting flies (<a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>), we observed that males rub their tarsi on ventral tergites A3\u2013A5 of the female abdomen while also licking (with their extended proboscis) the female genitalia (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). We, therefore, quantified the temporal dynamics of these motor programs (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 and <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>) to determine if either behavior predicted male and female song timing. We again used GLMs to predict female pulse and male bout times from male behaviors. More specifically, we predicted the presence/absence of female or male song based on the temporal pattern of behaviors preceding each time point during courtship interactions. The resulting set of coefficients for each behavior combine to produce temporal filters for predicting song (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). Since these behaviors are correlated in time and with each other, we used a sparse prior on the GLM coefficients that penalize non-predictive filter components (<a href=\"#bib10\">Coen et al., 2014</a>)."

The associated filters had their peaks within 16 milliseconds of female song, indicating low-latency coupling of male cues with female song (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). Predictability was not substantially enhanced with a two-variable model (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Notably, male song was much less predictive of female song, further suggesting that acoustic cues play a subordinate role in female song timing. Interestingly, we found that the male behaviors predicting female song also predict male song. That is, male tarsal vibration and proboscis licking were most predictive of the presence/absence of male song (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>). However, the associated filters peaked 200 and 50 ms preceding male song, respectively (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>). This implies that male courtship behavior forms a behavioral sequence that starts with tarsal vibration, transitions into proboscis licking, and ends with male song."

                                "text": "These results suggest that both male tarsal contact with the female abdomen and male proboscis contact with the female genitalia are independently predictive of female response timing. Above, we showed that blocking just the female genitalia reduces female song production rates (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4E, 6D</a>). Given the GLM results, we next blocked segments A3\u2013A5 of the female abdomen, while leaving the genitalia unblocked, and discovered that this manipulation also significantly reduced female song production (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7G</a>). However, additionally removing the aristae restored song production rates to WT levels (compare with <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), indicating that auditory and abdominal sensory inputs are combined to drive song production during courtship. We then compared female response time distributions for AC females with block to either abdominal segments A3\u2013A5 or the genitalia (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7H</a>). We found a larger shift in the response time distribution when blocking the genitalia (KL divergence between AC distribution and AC genitalia block distribution = 0.36) vs when blocking the upper abdomen (KL divergence between AC distribution and AC upper abdomen block distribution = 0.12). We, therefore, propose that while both forms of male contact are required for normal song rates, female song timing relies more strongly on the timing of male proboscis contact with her genitalia. This represents a novel mechanism for coordinating duets. We hypothesize that male contact cues (both tarsal vibration and proboscis licking) are detected via mechanosensory neurons, as the female abdomen and genitalia are covered in mechanosensory machrochete bristles (<a href=\"#bib16\">Fabre et al., 2008</a>). In contrast, gustatory receptors are expressed in multidendritic neurons that tile the abdominal body wall (<a href=\"#bib43\">Park and Kwon, 2011</a>), but none of these neurons detect external chemical cues. Our videos, however, did not reveal which subsets of bristles are likely to be responsible for detecting the male contact cues."

Females are typically silent but can be forced to produce (aberrant) song via artificial activation of <i>fruitless</i>-expressing neurons (<a href=\"#bib9\">Clyne and Miesenbock, 2008</a>). This sexual dimorphism relies on male-specific isoforms of both the <i>fruitless</i> and <i>doublesex</i> genes (<a href=\"#bib11\">Demir and Dickson, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Manoli et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Rideout et al., 2010</a>), the regulation of which are conserved in <i>virilis</i> (<a href=\"#bib66\">Yamamoto et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Usui-Aoki et al., 2005</a>). We, therefore, expected that the disparate male and female song behaviors in <i>D. virilis</i> should also be sexually dimorphic. To test this hypothesis, we paired either two females or two males in behavioral chambers. We did not observe any song production in pairings between two females (data not shown). However, similar to studies in <i>D. melanogaster</i> (<a href=\"#bib61\">Villella et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Pan and Baker, 2014</a>), we found that males will court another male. We observed two types of song in these interactions (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>): the courting male produced male-typical songs (blue), while the male being courted produced a secondary song that appeared more female-like (green), with longer IPIs (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>, compare to <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). However, the fundamental frequency of the pulses of the courted male's song remained male-like (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>). This secondary song (<a href=\"#bib55\">Suvanto et al., 1994</a>), similar to female song, was generated by bilateral wing vibration (<a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a>). Strikingly, we found response times of the courted male (secondary) song relative to the courting male (primary) song to match the distribution of female response times (compare <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a> with <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). This implies that the male nervous system contains separable circuits for song production, which are each activated in a context-dependent fashion. When the male is courting a target, he produces \u2018male\u2019 or primary song bouts, but when he is being courted, he produces \u2018female\u2019 or secondary song at the appropriate (female-like) response delay (see <a href=\"#media5\">Video 5</a> e.g., of males alternating between courting and being courted)."

This is significant because, as a Drosophilid, <i>virilis</i> shares developmental similarities with <i>melanogaster</i> (<a href=\"#bib31\">Kuntz and Eisen, 2014</a>) and in addition has had its genome fully sequenced and annotated (<a href=\"#bib7\">Drosophila 12 Genomes Consortium et al., 2007</a>). This makes feasible the development of genetic (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bassett and Liu, 2014</a>) and neural circuit tools (<a href=\"#bib53\">Simpson, 2009</a>) to resolve the mechanisms underlying duetting. Such tools will allow us to determine, for example, if genes such as <i>fruitless</i> and <i>doublesex</i>, known to be important for the establishment of sexually dimorphic and courtship-related behaviors in <i>melanogaster</i> (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kimura et al., 2008</a>), play different roles in a species in which both males and females are capable of song production. Our study also uncovered the sensory cues and putative neural mechanisms that orchestrate duetting in <i>virilis</i>. We can address these mechanisms by, for example, targeting neurons (via genetic methods) in <i>virilis</i> that are homologous to recently mapped song pathway neurons in <i>melanogaster</i> (<a href=\"#bib63\">von Philipsborn et al., 2011</a>). These experiments should reveal for the first time how the function and modulation of the song motor pathway differs between males and females in a duetting species. Because <i>virilis</i> is separated from <i>melanogaster</i> by &gt;40 million years of evolutionary time (<a href=\"#bib7\">Drosophila 12 Genomes Consortium et al., 2007</a>), the development of these tools should additionally provide insight into the evolution of new behaviors such as female song production."

Our experiments using song playback (to test the sufficiency of auditory cues) and headless females (to test the sufficiency of tactile cues) showed that neither auditory nor tactile cues alone fully recapitulated female song responses (e.g., response time distributions did not wholly match those of intact females interacting with males). In addition, we showed that interfering with song production (e.g., blocking male tactile inputs to the female abdomen and genitalia) could be overcome by additional removal of the auditory receiver (arista). These results taken together suggest that auditory and tactile information are integrated to drive song production and coordination in females. This may be similar to the integration of multimodal signals observed in frogs during territorial behaviors (<a href=\"#bib40\">Narins et al., 2005</a>). Experiments that target the <i>virilis</i> song pathway for neural recordings will reveal if this pathway is directly sensitive to both auditory and tactile information (both types of stimuli can be easily applied in a preparation fixed for in vivo recordings [<a href=\"#bib39\">Murthy and Turner, 2010</a>]). These experiments should also reveal if auditory information is combined linearly (simple integration) vs nonlinearly with tactile cues."

Moreover, our GLM analysis revealed that it is the precise timing of the male's contact with the female abdomen and genitalia that is the biggest predictor of her song timing. These experiments and analysis not only expose a completely novel mechanism for coordinating acoustic behavior between individuals but raises the question of what advantage incorporating tactile information provides to the female. Because removing any individual sensory cue to the <i>virilis</i> female (e.g., tactile cues sensed either via the genitalia or the upper abdomen) disrupts female song production, it seems unlikely that a male provides multiple cues in the event that one of his signals fails\u2014rather, females may select for males that can reliably provide multiple timing cues. This idea is consistent with studies showing that generating multiple cues is energetically costly for the sender (<a href=\"#bib44\">Partan and Marler, 2005</a>). Moreover, studies of decision-making in higher systems show that different sensory channels provide independent sources of information for directing behavior (<a href=\"#bib18\">Fetsch et al., 2012</a>). If this is true also for <i>virilis,</i> females may be better able to perform the duet by relying on multiple channels."

However, this manipulation did not affect time to copulation, which suggests that neither do males need to hear the female's song nor do females require a properly timed duet for mating. On the other hand, our experiments on virgin vs mated females suggest that female song production is a positive cue, because it is associated with her receptivity state. It is possible that our experimental conditions (pairing one male with one female) did not uncover the role duetting normally plays in mating. Studies in other model systems suggest the female song production evolved in species that experience high levels of reproductive competition (<a href=\"#bib8\">Clutton-Brock, 2007</a>). Examining interactions between either two males and one female or two females and one male, for example, could reveal the relationship between duetting and mate selection in <i>virilis</i>; such experiments are feasible using <i>Drosophila</i> behavioral chambers with multiple microphones to separate the signals of multiple singers (<a href=\"#bib10\">Coen et al., 2014</a>). Finally, because humans can integrate both auditory and tactile cues during speech perception (<a href=\"#bib20\">Gick and Derrick, 2009</a>), we propose that, more broadly, tactile cues may be critical for acoustic communication across the animal kingdom. Mapping the <i>virilis</i> circuits that detect tactile information, and then relay this information to the song production pathway, should therefore provide general insights into how precisely timed behaviors, such as song and speech production, are regulated."

However, we did not find conditions under which females produce male-like songs, suggesting that <i>virilis</i> male primary song production circuits are sexually differentiated. This discovery should aid in identifying the circuits for duetting in <i>virilis</i> (in other words, some song circuit elements should be present in both males and females, while others should only be present in males). Moreover, during male\u2013male courtship, <i>virilis</i> males can switch between the production of female-like secondary or male-like primary song based on their role as courtee or courter, respectively (<a href=\"#media5\">Video 5</a>). While some insects participate in sexual mimicry (imitating the song of the partner) during male\u2013female courtship (<a href=\"#bib33\">Luo and Wei, 2015</a>), ours is, to the best of our knowledge, the first demonstration of context-dependence of duetting behavior in any animal species.

See <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>. For each time point in the wavelet transform, we computed the likelihood that it was generated from one of four previously assembled template distributions. These template distributions were created from manually annotated data for male, female, and overlapping pulses. The wavelet transforms corresponding to the pulse locations for each of these groups were then collated and rotated into a new orthogonal coordinate frame via principal components analysis. The distributions of projections along the modes were fit to a Gaussian mixture model through an expectation maximization algorithm. Thus, each template consists of a mean wavelet spectrum, an orthogonal basis set, and a set of distributions along each of these newly created axes. An identical procedure was performed to create a noise (N) template as well. However, for this case, we created a new noise template from the low-amplitude fluctuations in each data set separately, allowing us to account for differing noise conditions. Given these templates, we defined the likelihood that a wavelet was drawn from one of these templates, T, by transforming it into the appropriate template coordinate system and calculating p(x<sub>i</sub>|T) for each coordinate value, x<sub>i</sub>. The log-likelihood is simply the sum of the logarithms of these values. The end result of this process was to have a set of 4 log-likelihoods as a function of time (male [M, blue], female [F, red], overlap [O, green], and noise [N, black]). If we assume a uniform prior for the template distributions, then, p(T|x(t)) is simply proportional to the likelihood value, so we can then assign a probability to each of the templates as a function of time. We first eliminated all noise from the time series, zeroing out all segments where p(N|x(t)) &gt; 1/2. We then looked at each connected segment of non-noise data separately. If p(M|x(t)) + P(O|x(t)) &gt; p(F|x(t)) and the segment were at least 100 ms in length, we assigned that segment to M. All remaining segments at least 15 ms in length were assigned to F. Lastly, we looked within each of the M regions for overlapping pulses, where both the male and the female were singing. If p(F|x(t)) + P(O|x(t)) &gt; 0.8 over a region at least 15 ms in length, we labeled that as a male region with a female pulse. The automated code is available on github (<a href=\"https://github.com/murthylab/virilisSongSegmenter\">https://github.com/murthylab/virilisSongSegmenter</a>). Lastly, these pulse calls were scanned by visual inspection, correcting mislabeled pulses by hand. Song segmented by this method was compared to manually segmented song from a WT data set that was not previously used to inform the likelihood models. Sensitivity, positive predictive value, and the harmonic mean (F) were calculated as previously described (<a href=\"#bib1\">Arthur et al., 2013</a>)."

Experiments that required observation in the dark were performed in a dark room under red LED lighting. Only pairs for which there was visible male wing vibration were scored. To generate mated females, females were paired with males until copulation occurred, at least 24 hr prior to pairing with virgin males."

IPI values were calculated as the time between pulses with a threshold of 100 ms for males and 500 ms for females and reported as a median per individual. Male bout and female pulse rates were calculated as the number of bouts or pulses divided by total courtship time in seconds (Hz), where total courtship time is the time between the first pulse in the recording (male or female) and the last pulse (male or female). Because there can be long stretches of silence during a recording, song rates report how much singing occurs overall within a recording, whereas IPI reports the rate of pulsing when singing occurs. We chose to quantify female pulse rates (as opposed to bout rates) due to the highly variable structure of female bouts. Recordings with less than 20 s of either male or female song were assigned a male bout rate or female pulse rate of 0 Hz. The square roots of female pulse rates are plotted in all figures (to temper outliers), but all statistics were performed on raw data. A GLM (for details see next section) was used to determine the significance of song rate differences between virgin and mated females, independent of courtship success. Instances of overlaps between male and female song are reported as a percent (number of overlaps/number of male bouts) for each courtship pairing. For response times, we calculated the delay from the onset of a male bout to the previous female pulse within 1.5 s (male response time) or the delay from the onset of a male bout to the following female pulse within 1.5 s (female response time). This analysis includes regions of male and female overlap. We also randomly shuffled either female IPIs or male IBIs and then calculated male and female response times. Confidence intervals were generated with 500 bootstrapped permutations. The two-sample Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test was used to determine if the difference between response time curves was statistically significant. We report median values and interquartile range (IQR) for non-normally distributed data and mean values and standard deviation for normally distributed data. Male secondary song elicited during male\u2013male interactions was analyzed in the same manner as female song above."

The presence/absence of a sensory channel was coded as 1/\u22121. To ensure that the GLM coefficients reflect the relative impact of removing a sensory channel, we first z-scored the data. Fitting was performed using Matlab's <i>fitglm</i> function, and statistics and errorbars were extracted from the output of that function. The same approach was used to demonstrate differences in song rates dependent on the female mating state. For each pair, the state of the female (virgin/mated) and the success of the courtship (no copulation/copulation) were coded in a two-variable matrix (represented as \u22121/1, respectively). Statistical output of the fitglm function (from MatLab) is reported."

(2014)</a>, to predict the presence/absence of male song or female song from annotated behaviors during a courtship interaction. To learn about <i>when</i> a behavior is predictive about song, we used the temporal pattern of behaviors for prediction. For each time point in male or female song, we used the temporal pattern of behaviors in a window of \u223c1 s (64 frames at 60 fps) preceding that time point for predicting song. This yielded GLM filters\u2014a sequence of weights whose magnitude indicates the importance of each time point in the behavioral history. Since the predicted variable is binary (song/no song), we used a logistic link function for the GLM. The annotated behaviors are strongly correlated both in time (autocorrelation) as well as with each other (cross-correlation). We, therefore, used a GLM with a sparse prior that penalized non-predictive weights, which would have large magnitudes merely due to correlations in the data (<a href=\"#bib37\">Mineault et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Coen et al., 2014</a>). Model performance (relative deviance reduction) was evaluated using cross-validation; that is, model parameters were fitted from 80% of the data, and the model was tested with the remaining 20% of the data (random subsampling). To obtain a bootstrap estimate of the standard error of the mean for the GLM filters and GLM performance, we re-ran this cross-validation procedure 1000 times with a randomly selected 75% of all data. We started by fitting single-variable models (e.g., using only tarsal contact as a predictor) and determined the most predictive features. To rule out that including more parameters substantially improved performance, we took the best predictor and added any of the remaining three features to the model. However, this never increased performance by more than 14%. Code for sparse GLM analysis is available on GitHub (<a href=\"https://github.com/murthylab/GLMvirilis\">https://github.com/murthylab/GLMvirilis</a>)."

These duets are a part of courtship that leads to successful matings. They are synched in the female mainly by tactile cues which the male provides rather than by auditory cues, though auditory cues do play a role. In the males auditory cues play a bigger role in synchronization but tactile cues are also important. These conclusions are based on extensive behavior tests with sensory modifications and the application General Linear Models (GLMs). Most intriguing is that males can also produce \u201cfemale-like\u201d songs, elicited by tapping, when isolated with a courting male. Thus, both sexes possess neural circuits capable of producing this type of courtship song. The writing in general is clear and concise. The figures are a bit busy (there is no need for this as there are no figure limitations) but clear in general. The modeling is well conceived and based on established procedures and it appears competently and prudently applied. The Methods section is appropriate but could provide access to the code used in the modeling and analysis. These results have important implications for analysis of acoustic communication in animals by pointing out a role for multisensory cues in the acoustic signaling, and they could serve as an entry point for further mechanistic studies in an important model system."

In this light the male triggers a bout (train) of quite variable female song that may overlap with his next song bout. A general reader may have a different concept of a duet as mutual acoustically driven performance with each singer producing a precise song component as seen for example in human singers. The authors need to do a better job in the Introduction and Discussion explaining the context of their work and how the mutual singing they describe conforms to the concept of duets in the ethological literature. Then the multimodal nature of the synchronizing mechanism can be more plainly seen as novel."

How often did the songs overlap in the courting data set? In the courtship song sequence of <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a> there appears to be no overlap at all. Is this correct and truly typical in the data set? If overlap occurs are the songs disentangled or is the data excluded.

These duets are a part of courtship that leads to successful matings. They are synched in the female mainly by tactile cues which the male provides rather than by auditory cues, though auditory cues do play a role. In the males auditory cues play a bigger role in synchronization but tactile cues are also important. These conclusions are based on extensive behavior tests with sensory modifications and the application General Linear Models (GLMs). Most intriguing is that males can also produce \u201cfemale-like\u201d songs, elicited by tapping, when isolated with a courting male. Thus, both sexes possess neural circuits capable of producing this type of courtship song. The writing in general is clear and concise. The figures are a bit busy (there is no need for this as there are no figure limitations) but clear in general. The modeling is well conceived and based on established procedures and it appears competently and prudently applied.

We also include this information in the text of the manuscript (Results section) and in the figure legend of <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>. We included these overlaps in all of the data analysis in the paper, with the only exception being the playback experiments (now <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). Because the amplitude of the male playback stimulus was constant, but female song in this experiment was of variable intensity, any overlaps were obscured and difficult to score. However, we did try to score overlaps if they occurred, and any that we scored were included in the data analysis presented in the main panels of <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>. In the inset of <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>, however, we calculated the female response time from the end of the male playback bout, in order to avoid any issue introduced by our difficulty in scoring overlaps in this particular experiment. To be clear, there was no difficulty in scoring overlaps in data from male/female courtship pairs, only for the playback experiment. The inset in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a> was necessary to plot (as the Reviewers correctly point out) because if there was a problem with scoring overlaps in this experiment, we would artificially see a peak at the end of the male bout in the response time curve for the playback expt. As we show, the female response time curve more closely (but not perfectly: these curves are still significantly different) resembles the randomized curves when we examine response times from the end of the male bout (the inset in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>), and we therefore conclude that the playback has only a weak effect on her song timing. To strengthen this argument, we now include a new panel in this figure (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). We repeated the playback experiments with the addition of deafening the female. We see no difference in the response time curves for arista cut versus intact females (compare <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a> with <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Any relationship between female song and the playback stimulus must therefore indirectly be due to the effect of playback on the male. We have expanded the explanation of these results in the text of the manuscript, accordingly (please see the subsection headed \u201c<i>Drosophila virilis</i> females rely on non-acoustic cues to coordinate song timing with males\u201d). We also have added text throughout the Results and Methods sections to explain how we treated overlaps throughout the paper."

To address these questions it would be ideal to, as the reviewers suggest, uncouple song timing from male tapping. We did this with the headless female experiments (there she receives only the tactile cues); however, these females lack a brain and never become receptive. The only sensory manipulation in our study (of all combinations tried) that disrupted duetting but left song production rates intact was removal of the arista of males (see <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). We observed no change in copulation rates for arista-cut males, but this may be due to the fact (as we suggest in the text) that these males can still sense female wing spreading (which is a receptivity cue). Male contact with her genitalia and abdomen should not change in this manipulation, which therefore suggests that the tactile cues alone are not only sufficient to drive female song production (as we show with the headless female experiments), but they also are sufficient to make the female receptive. Tarsiless males produce almost no song (see <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Males therefore also need information collected through contact with the female abdomen to drive his song production circuits (thus, we could not examine the impact of song in the absence of tapping; even in the playback experiments, females required interaction with a wingless male for song production). The experiment with arista-cut males also suggests that the male does not need to hear the duet to mate with the female. To clarify these points, we have added to the Discussion."
