Here, using a pancreatic islet allograft model and CD3 antibody therapy, we showed, by single cell gene profiling, that intragraft CD8<sup>+</sup> lymphocytes coexpressing granzyme B and perforin were selectively depleted through the Fas/FasL pathway. This step led to long-standing anergy of the remaining CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells marked by the absence of cytotoxic/inflammatory gene expression also confirmed by transcriptome analysis. This sustained unresponsiveness required the presence of the alloantigens. Furthermore, tissue-resident CD8<sup>+</sup> lymphocytes produced TGF\u03b2 and expressed the inhibitory receptors PD-1 and PD-L1. Blockade of TGF\u03b2 downregulated PD-1 and PD-L1 expression and precipitated graft rejection. Neutralizing PD-1, PD-L1 or TGF\u03b2RII signaling in T cells also abrogated CD3 antibody-induced tolerance. These studies unravel novel mechanisms underlying CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell anergy and reveal a cell intrinsic regulatory link between the TGF\u03b2 and the PD-1/PD-L1 pathways."

Here, using a pancreatic islet allograft model and CD3 antibody therapy, we showed, by single cell gene profiling, that intragraft CD8<sup>+</sup> lymphocytes coexpressing granzyme B and perforin were selectively depleted through the Fas/FasL pathway. This step led to long-standing anergy of the remaining CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells marked by the absence of cytotoxic/inflammatory gene expression also confirmed by transcriptome analysis. This sustained unresponsiveness required the presence of the alloantigens. Furthermore, tissue-resident CD8<sup>+</sup> lymphocytes produced TGF\u03b2 and expressed the inhibitory receptors PD-1 and PD-L1. Blockade of TGF\u03b2 downregulated PD-1 and PD-L1 expression and precipitated graft rejection. Neutralizing PD-1, PD-L1 or TGF\u03b2RII signaling in T cells also abrogated CD3 antibody-induced tolerance. These studies unravel novel mechanisms underlying CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell anergy and reveal a cell intrinsic regulatory link between the TGF\u03b2 and the PD-1/PD-L1 pathways."

While this response is essential to fighting off infections and other diseases like cancer, it can backfire in people with an organ transplant. Indeed, the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells can target and attack the cells of the transplanted organ causing the body to reject the organ."

This treatment had to be given after the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells had recognized and began targeting the transplanted organ to be effective.

This leaves behind only inactive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells that don\u2019t harm the transplant. To do this, Baas, Besan\u00e7on et al. transplanted pancreatic cells from mice into other mice with a diabetes-like disorder. Next, the experiments compared gene expression in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells found within the transplanted tissue in mice that were treated with the antibody and those that were not treated. The expression of many genes for toxic molecules was stopped after treatment with the antibody leaving the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in an inactive state."

So, Baas, Besan\u00e7on et al. treated transplanted mice with both the T cell-eliminating antibody and antibodies that block these inhibitory receptors to see what would happen. The transplanted organs were quickly attacked and rejected. This shows that the inhibitory receptors play a crucial role in helping to shut down attacking CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the initial antibody treatment and allowed long-term survival of the transplanted organs. Blocking another protein called TGF\u03b2 in antibody-treated mice also caused organ rejection. The findings help explain how these antibodies protect transplanted organs and may help scientists trying to develop new anti-transplant rejection drugs in the future."

CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells play major role in transplant rejection. Through direct presentation, they get activated by donor antigen-presenting cells (APC), in\u00a0particular\u00a0dendritic cells, which migrate from the graft to secondary lymphoid organs (<a href=\"#bib16\">Gras et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Ochando et al., 2006</a>). This response is rapid, intense and induces acute graft rejection. Recipient APC also capture donor antigens from the transplant, present them to alloreactive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells through self MHC I molecules (cross-priming/indirect presentation) hereby contributing to acute and chronic graft rejection (<a href=\"#bib7\">Celli et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Valujskikh et al., 2002</a>).

Classically defined as the functional inactivation of T cells to cognate antigens, anergy was first described <i>in vitro</i> when T cells recognized antigens (signal 1) in absence of appropriate costimulation (signal 2), usually provided by CD28 (<a href=\"#bib41\">Schwartz, 2003</a>). T cells were not able to produce IL-2, entered a hyporesponsive non proliferative state that prevented further responses upon antigen re-encounter. Over the last decade, better insight was gained into the signaling events leading to anergy, highlighting in particular the role of the transcription factors NF-AT (nuclear factor of activated T cells) and early growth response gene 2 and 3 (Egr-2, Egr-3) (<a href=\"#bib28\">Macian et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Safford et al., 2005</a>).

The timing of treatment was crucial; long-term graft acceptance was obtained only when CD3 Abs were administered once T cell priming had occurred, a few days post-transplant. Permanent survival of a second graft from the original donor but not from third-party donor demonstrated that antigen-specific tolerance had been induced. Purified spleen CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from CD3 Ab-treated recipients were unable to respond when stimulated with donor antigens while response to third-party antigens was conserved (<a href=\"#bib49\">You et al., 2012</a>).

RT-qPCR results on islet grafts recovered from CD3 Ab-treated recipients showed a significant increase of <i>Tgfb1</i> mRNA, as compared to untreated controls (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). In addition, the intragraft <i>Tgfb1/Ifng</i> ratio was increased over long-term. To further identify the source of TGF\u03b2, we sorted individual T lymphocytes, recovered on day 14 post-transplant, either from the spleen or from the islet grafts of 3 recipient mice treated with CD3 Abs. Expression of <i>Tgfb1</i> mRNA was determined by single cell qPCR on 60 CD8<sup>+</sup> and 48 CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Results showed that <i>Tgfb1</i> mRNA was expressed in 52% and 65% of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, respectively (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). In untreated recipients, only 9% of CD4<sup>+</sup> and 6% of CD8<sup>+</sup> intragraft T cells expressed <i>Tgfb1. Tgfb1</i> mRNA was expressed in very few T cells recovered from the spleen of the same untreated or CD3 Ab-treated mice. Administration of a neutralizing antibody to TGF\u03b2 partially, yet significantly, abrogated CD3 Ab-induced tolerance (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). To assess whether TGF\u03b2 signaling within T cells was involved in the effect observed, we used as recipients transgenic DnTGF\u03b2RII C57BL/6 mice\u00a0that express a dominant negative form of the human TGF\u03b2 receptor II under the control of the mouse CD4 promoter (<a href=\"#bib14\">Gorelik and Flavell, 2000</a>). In these mice, the dnTGFBRII-CD4 transgenic construct lacks the CD8 silencer. Thus, expression of the transgene blocks TGF\u03b2 signaling specifically in both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Treatment of these transgenic recipients with CD3 Ab on day\u00a0+7 post-transplant did not induce long-term survival of islet allografts (median survival of 36.8 \u00b1 6.1 days) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>)."

The remaining transgenic CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were intrinsically unresponsive to TCR stimuli (<a href=\"#bib38\">Rocha and von Boehmer, 1991</a>). Importantly, when parked into a second female nude recipient for 2 months and subsequently transferred into a third male nude mice, the T cells regained their ability to respond to the HY antigen showing that antigen persistence was required to maintain CD8 T cell anergy (<a href=\"#bib39\">Rocha et al., 1993</a>). In our model, the continuous presence of the alloantigen was essential to sustain CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell unresponsiveness <i>in vivo</i> as islet allografts transplanted 2 months after infusion of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from tolerant mice into RAG<sup>-/-</sup> recipients were rapidly rejected.

Genes encoding for negative regulators of proliferation or differentiation (<i>Eid2, Cdkn2c, Hopx, Id2)</i> were overexpressed. <i>Hopx</i> (homeodomain-only protein), identified as a master regulator of the anergic state of induced Tregs, inhibits the expression of the AP-1 complex (<a href=\"#bib18\">Hawiger et al., 2010</a>). Accordingly, <i>Fos</i> and <i>Jun</i> that compose the AP-1 complex were downregulated in tolerant CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells as well as their downstream target cyclin D1 (<i>Ccnd1</i>) (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kang et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Sundstedt et al., 1996</a>). Additionally, the decreased expression of <i>Cxcl9</i>, encoding an IFN\u03b3 inducible chemokine\u00a0contributing to the recruitment of allograft reactive T cells (<a href=\"#bib29\">Medoff et al., 2006</a>), as well as that of <i>Tnf, Il2ra, Lgals3, Il1r2, Il18r1 and Tnfrsf9</i> revealed the inhibition of Th1 inflammatory responses. Tolerant CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells also downregulated the hypoxia-inducible factor <i>Hif1a</i> that has been shown to positively regulate T cell differentiation and effector functions by promoting aerobic glycolysis (<a href=\"#bib9\">Doedens et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Finlay et al., 2012</a>). Finally, we found an overexpression of <i>Eomes</i> in tolerant CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells.

However, investigations in models of chronic infections in human and mouse (HIV, LCMV) have demonstrated that expression of Eomes by virus-specific CD8 T cells was associated with high expression of inhibitory receptors and impaired functions (<a href=\"#bib6\">Buggert et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Doering et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Paley et al., 2012</a>). In our transplant model, as detailed below, the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway is mandatory for CD8 T cell tolerance. Thus, increased expression of Eomes in conjunction with PD-1/PD-L1 may characterize anergized CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells induced after CD3 Ab therapy. This finding highlights the issue of a molecular link between Eomes and PD-1/PD-L1. Lastly, one important feature common to our model and the infectious setting is the continuous presence of the cognate antigens. Therefore, we may hypothesize that chronic antigenic stimulation delivers signals inducing a preferential and sustained expression of Eomes."

The PD-1/PD-L1 pathway played a predominant role in the induction and the maintenance phase of CD3 Ab-mediated tolerance as neutralization of either receptor completely abrogated the therapeutic effect. More precisely, we demonstrated that the PD-1/PD-L1 signaling was mandatory for CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell unresponsiveness. Indeed, after treatment with CD3 antibodies, intragraft CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells showed a defective ability to proliferate, to produce IFN\u03b3 and to mount donor-specific responses. <i>In vivo</i> administration of anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 antibodies restored the effector functions of allogeneic CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, as shown by the up-regulation of the proliferation marker Ki67 and the IFN\u03b3 transcription factor T-bet as well as the regained ability to secrete IFN\u03b3, and resulted in islet allograft rejection.

We have previously shown in autoimmunity that CD3 antibodies cured type 1 diabetes and restored self-tolerance in a TGF\u03b2-dependent manner (<a href=\"#bib4\">Belghith et al., 2003</a>). The present results not only extend these findings to transplant tolerance but also provide new insights into the key regulatory role of this cytokine. First, the single cell PCR results showed that a large proportion of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (as well as CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells) present within the islet allografts produced TGF\u03b2 after CD3 antibody administration. This increased expression of TGF\u03b2 was restricted to the graft as it was not observed in the spleen. Secondly, we demonstrated that TGF\u03b2 signaling in T cells is mandatory for the induction of immune tolerance as CD3 Ab treatment failed to induce long-term islet graft survival in recipients presenting a T cell-selective mutated TGF\u03b2RII (<a href=\"#bib14\">Gorelik and Flavell, 2000</a>). This result argues for an <i>in situ</i>\u00a0autocrine/paracrine effect of TGF\u03b2 on allogeneic T cells. Third, we demonstrated a direct link between the TGF\u03b2 and the PD-1 pathways as TGF\u03b2 blockade, through the administration of neutralizing antibodies, downregulated PD-1 and PD-L1 expression on intragraft CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and abrogated the tolerogenic properties of CD3 Abs.

After cell lysis by heating/cooling steps, RNA was specifically retrotranscribed using MuLV Reverse Transcriptase (Applied Biosystems) and 3\u2019 specific primers (Eurofins MWG,\u00a0Ebersberg,\u00a0Germany). The resulting cDNA was next amplified (first PCR with all primers). Product of this first PCR was then subjected to a second PCR using SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) for each primers pairs. To ensure that each well contained a T cell, <i>Cd3e</i> mRNA was amplified simultaneously with the genes of interest. HPRT was the housekeeping gene. Multiplex single cell PCR was performed for the following genes: granzymes A and B (<i>Gzma, Gzmb</i>), perforin-1 (<i>Prf1</i>) and FasLigand (<i>Fasl)</i>, which provide killing abilities, the transcription factors T-bet (<i>Tbx21</i>) and Eomesodermin (<i>Eomes</i>) which control IFN<i>\u03b3</i> expression, and the killer-cell lectin like receptor G-1 (<i>Klrg1)</i> which marks terminally differentiated effector T cells."

It also indicates roles for Fas/FasL and loss of perforin-based lytic mechanisms in CD8 T cells in the success of the anti-CD3 therapy. The authors identify, by single-cell gene profiling, two distinct granzyme B-expressing CD8 T cell populations in grafts, one perforin-positive and the other FasL-positive. Their data suggest that the perforin-expressing cells are selectively depleted in anti-CD3 therapy in a Fas-dependent process, and the other population is rendered non-responsive over the long term by active repression via the PD1-PDL1 pathway in a process requiring continuous antigen exposure. The molecular mechanisms that account for these interactions have not been studied but would be of great interest."

Further, the data assume 'anergy' of the graft-infiltrating CD8 T cells (as well as CD8 T cells in lymphoid organs), yet show no assays demonstrating such anergy in cellular function. This is a particular concern since 'anergy' refers to the failure of the cells to reject allografts, yet cellular non-responsiveness appears to be through active inhibition because anti-PD1 or anti-PDL1 can reverse it. The term 'anergy' could use either replacement or extensive clarification."

Since 3 million cells were transferred, it is likely that splenic T cells were used. The gene expression and phenotyping data show some differences between intragraft and splenic CD8 T cells from anti-CD3-tolerised mice. However, the intragraft CD8 T cells are extensively characterised, while splenic CD8 T cells allotolerise quite effectively.

Eomes was mostly shown to play key role in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell differentiation and acquisition of an effector memory phenotype (Intlekofer M et al. Nat Immunol 2005). However, investigations in models of chronic infections in human and mouse (HIV, LCMV) have demonstrated that expression of Eomes by virus-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells was associated with high expression of inhibitory receptors and impaired functions (Doering TA et al. Immunity 2012; Paley MA et al. Science 2012; Buggert M et al. Plos Pathogens 2014). In our transplant model, as detailed below, the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway is mandatory for CD8<sub>+</sub> T cell tolerance. Thus, increased expression of Eomes in conjunction with PD-1/PD-L1 may characterize anergized CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells induced after CD3 Ab therapy. This finding highlights the issue of a molecular link between Eomes and PD-1/PD-L1. Lastly, one important feature common to our model and the infectious setting is the continuous presence of the cognate antigens. Therefore, we may hypothesize that chronic antigenic stimulation delivers signals inducing a preferential and sustained expression of Eomes. This point has been included in the Discussion section, sixth paragraph."
