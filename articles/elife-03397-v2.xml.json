                    "text": "The mammalian genome is punctuated by CpG islands (CGIs), which differ sharply from the bulk genome by being rich in G + C and the dinucleotide CpG. CGIs often include transcription initiation sites and display \u2018active\u2019 histone marks, notably histone H3 lysine 4 methylation. In embryonic stem cells (ESCs) some CGIs adopt a \u2018bivalent\u2019 chromatin state bearing simultaneous \u2018active\u2019 and \u2018inactive\u2019 chromatin marks. To determine whether CGI chromatin is developmentally programmed at specific genes or is imposed by shared features of CGI DNA, we integrated artificial CGI-like DNA sequences into the ESC genome. We found that bivalency is the default chromatin structure for CpG-rich, G + C-rich DNA. A high CpG density alone is not sufficient for this effect, as A + T-rich sequence settings invariably provoke de novo DNA methylation leading to loss of CGI signature chromatin. We conclude that both CpG-richness and G + C-richness are required for induction of signature chromatin structures at CGIs."

CGIs often include transcription initiation sites and display \u2018active\u2019 histone marks, notably histone H3 lysine 4 methylation. In embryonic stem cells (ESCs) some CGIs adopt a \u2018bivalent\u2019 chromatin state bearing simultaneous \u2018active\u2019 and \u2018inactive\u2019 chromatin marks. To determine whether CGI chromatin is developmentally programmed at specific genes or is imposed by shared features of CGI DNA, we integrated artificial CGI-like DNA sequences into the ESC genome. We found that bivalency is the default chromatin structure for CpG-rich, G + C-rich DNA. A high CpG density alone is not sufficient for this effect, as A + T-rich sequence settings invariably provoke de novo DNA methylation leading to loss of CGI signature chromatin. We conclude that both CpG-richness and G + C-richness are required for induction of signature chromatin structures at CGIs."

It was suggested that having both kinds of markings allows CpG islands to prime nearby genes, so that they are ready to be quickly switched on or off as the cell develops.

Other artificial sequences with lots of Cs and Gs, but where Gs were rarely found immediately after the Cs, had neither of the two chemical marks on the chromatin. This suggests that nearby genes would be harder to locate and activate as the cell grows and develops. On the other hand, when the DNA contained a lot of As and Ts, the chemical marks were added directly to the DNA (rather than to the chromatin)\u2014and this prevented both the activating and the inactivating chemical marks being added to the chromatin."

                        "text": "CpG islands (CGIs) are stretches of atypical genomic DNA sequences that mark most gene promoters (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bird, 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Deaton and Bird, 2011</a>). Though individually unique in nucleotide sequence, mammalian CGIs share two features that often correlate but can vary independently: a G + C-rich base composition (65% vs 40% for the bulk genome) and high density of the dinucleotide CpG (5\u201310-fold higher than the bulk genome). Whereas bulk genomic DNA is globally methylated, CGIs associated with promoters invariably lack DNA methylation. It has been proposed that CGIs function as generic platforms for gene regulation, probably via proteins that bind to CpG and influence chromatin modification (<a href=\"#bib6\">Blackledge and Klose, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Deaton and Bird, 2011</a>). This hypothesis has gained credence due to accumulating evidence that enrichment or depletion of specific chromatin marks at CGIs is linked to proteins that bind to unmethylated CpG. So far, all such proteins possess CXXC zinc finger domains that bind specifically to the CpG dyad in duplex DNA (<a href=\"#bib25\">Lee et al., 2001</a>). Cfp1, for example, is a CXXC domain-containing component of the Set1/COMPASS complex (<a href=\"#bib24\">Lee and Skalnik, 2005</a>), which generates H3K4 methylation, a signature chromatin mark at non-methylated CGIs (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bernstein et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Guenther et al., 2007</a>). Accordingly, Cfp1 is concentrated at CGIs as determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and its absence is associated with reduced H3K4 methylation at many CGIs (<a href=\"#bib36\">Thomson et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Clouaire et al., 2012</a>). The H3K4 methyltransferases Mll1 and Mll2 are also CXXC proteins and each is found at CGIs in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) as determined by ChIP-Seq (<a href=\"#bib18\">Hu et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Denissov et al., 2014</a>). Similarly the CXXC domain-containing proteins Kdm2a and Kdm2b are enriched at CGIs. Kdm2a is an H3K36 demethylase that contributes to depletion of H3K36me at CGI promoters (<a href=\"#bib7\">Blackledge et al., 2010</a>), whereas Kdm2b facilitates recruitment of the PRC1 complex to transcriptionally silent CGIs (<a href=\"#bib14\">Farcas et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Wu et al., 2013</a>)."

Promoter-less CGI-like DNA sequences of invertebrate origin in mouse ES cells were initially shown to cause local enrichment of trimethylation of lysine 4 of histone H3 (H3K4me3) and to recruit the CpG binding protein Cfp1 (<a href=\"#bib36\">Thomson et al., 2010</a>). Similar experiments using G + C-rich DNA derived from bacteria created chromatin marked by both H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 (<a href=\"#bib31\">Mendenhall et al., 2010</a>). Whereas H3K4me3 is characteristic of active promoters, H3K27me3 is associated with transcriptional repression via the polycomb complex. The coincidence of these two marks in so-called \u2018bivalent\u2019 chromatin is thought to be a feature of genes that are poised to become either active or silent during early development (<a href=\"#bib2\">Azuara et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bernstein et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Voigt et al., 2013</a>). Many native CGIs in ESCs adopt a \u2018bivalent\u2019 chromatin structure when transcriptionally silent."

Here we vary the DNA sequence composition of artificial promoter-less CGIs to assess the relative importance of G + C-richness and high CpG density. Our assay relies upon chromosomal integration of artificial CGI-like sequences into the genome of ESCs. We show that a bivalent chromatin configuration and absence of DNA methylation represent the default state of biologically inert CGI-like DNA sequences. While a high CpG density is essential, it is not sufficient to guarantee the bivalent chromatin structure, as CpG-rich DNA sequences with a G + C-poor average base composition do not acquire this chromatin signature. In fact A + T-rich, G + C poor insertions with a CpG frequency matching that of CGIs consistently become DNA methylated in ESCs, although the bivalent configuration can be restored if the dominant DNA methylation is removed. Our findings demonstrate that CpG-richness is essential for the formation of bivalent chromatin, whereas G + C-richness is required to exclude DNA methylation, which when present is dominant over the other chromatin marks."

A previous study showed that bacterial DNA with CGI-like features organised bivalent chromatin in ESCs (<a href=\"#bib31\">Mendenhall et al., 2010</a>). In order to verify and extend this result we introduced CGI-like DNA sequences of \u223c1000 nucleotide pairs (the average length of native CGIs) into a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) containing a human \u2018gene desert\u2019 using recombineering (See <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). A computer-generated CGI-like sequence (Artificial CGI 1) was designed with a CpG frequency of one per \u223c10 base pairs and a base composition of 65% G + C (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a> and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>). A second CGI-like sequence (PuroGFP; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a> and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>) was of prokaryotic origin, being derived from a promoter-less bacterial puromycin gene adjacent to codon-optimised green fluorescent protein coding sequence (<a href=\"#bib36\">Thomson et al., 2010</a>). All constructs lack a promoter, allowing us to focus on the interaction between DNA sequence and chromatin modification without the complicating involvement of transcription. The gene desert regions flanking CGI-like sequences are intended to insulate against effects of the genomic and chromatin environment at different BAC integrations sites."

As controls we monitored active genes (<i>Sox</i>2 and <i>Gapdh</i>), which are marked by H3K4me3, an endogenous bivalent gene (<i>Hoxc8</i>), which carries both H3K27me3 and H3K4me3, and an inter-genic region of chromosome 15 (m15), which bears neither mark. The CGI-like insertions consistently generated a bivalent chromatin structure marked by H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We refer to DNA sequence domains as bivalent using the convention that H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 marks coincide at a single integration site. It is possible that some cells in the population harbour an integrant marked by only one of these marks whereas other cells possess only the other mark. This configuration has not been detected at the few ESC bivalent domains tested so far. More likely is that the two marks are interspersed at a given bivalent sequence domain, though we did not test this experimentally (See <a href=\"#bib38\">Voigt et al., 2013</a>). The levels of H3K4me3 at the artificial CGI were similar to those at the endogenous bivalent gene <i>Hoxc8</i>, whereas H3K4me3 levels in the DNA sequences flanking the CGI were unaffected by the insertion. H3K27me3 was less discrete, spreading variably into flanking regions of the human BAC, but Suz12, a component of the PRC2 complex that deposits the H3K27me3 mark, was tightly localised to the CGI-like sequence in each case. We tested an unrelated artificial CGI-like sequence with similar overall sequence properties (Artificial CGI 2; <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), this time integrated at a recombination cassette within the beta globin locus of mouse ESCs (<a href=\"#bib26\">Lienert et al., 2011</a>). Independent replicate stable transformant cell lines again showed consistent presence of a bivalent chromatin structure (data not shown). The DNA methylation status of the integrated artificial CGIs was investigated by bisulfite sequencing. This showed that all the insertions reproducibly maintained a low level of DNA methylation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>; <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). DNA methylation levels at CGI-like sequences inserted into the gene desert (\u223c10%) were consistently somewhat higher than in the cassette exchange system (0.5%) and were somewhat higher than an endogenous control CGI in the same DNA samples (<i>Dlx5</i>; \u223c4\u20135%, data not shown). Despite this variability, it is evident that all of these artificial DNA sequences maintain a largely non-methylated status."

To facilitate detection of Cfp1, we introduced the BAC containing the artificial CGI into a transgenic cell line expressing a Cfp1-GFP fusion protein (<a href=\"#bib13\">Denissov et al., 2014</a>). Having verified that a bivalent domain was formed at the artificial CGI in these cells (data not shown), ChIP was performed on three independent cell lines using an anti-GFP antibody. We consistently observed discrete enrichment of Cfp1 at the CGI-like insertion (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). To determine whether the formation of a bivalent domain at the inserted artificial CGI-like sequence was dependent on Cfp1, the artificial CGI was introduced into <i>Cfp1</i>\u2212/\u2212 mouse ES cells (<a href=\"#bib7a\">Carlone and Skalnik, 2001</a>) and three independent lines were analysed by ChIP. H3K4me3 levels at the artificial CGI were clearly detectable in the <i>Cfp1</i>\u2212/\u2212 cells, indicating that Cfp1 is not required for the formation of H3K4me3 levels at the bivalent domain (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). Depletion of Cfp1 was previously reported to preferentially cause a decrease of H3K4me3 at active genes without affecting non-productive genes (<a href=\"#bib10\">Clouaire et al., 2012</a>). In agreement with this finding, we observed reduced H3K4me3 at the active control gene <i>Sox2</i> compared to wildtype cells (Compare <a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 2D and 1C)</a>. We also followed the fate of chromatin modifications during differentiation of ESCs to neuronal progenitor cells (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>) and found a consistent drop in H3K4me3 accompanied by persistent or increased H3K27me3 (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This transition from bivalency to H3K27me3 marking alone matches that at native CGI-associated genes that remain transcriptionally silent during differentiation (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bernstein et al., 2006</a>)."

An artificial CGI with a base composition similar to that of a normal CGI (65% G + C) but with a low density of CpGs, similar to that of the bulk genome (1 CpG/100 bp), was designed (Low CpG / High G + C). This Low CpG / High G + C sequence failed to create bivalent chromatin as neither H3K4me3 nor H3K27me3 was detected in three independent ESC lines (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). We note that the relative values of control and experimental data points are consistent between experiments although we observe variability in the absolute precipitation levels due to the use of different antibody suppliers between experiments over an extended time period. Our conclusion from this data is that a G + C-rich base composition alone is insufficient to recruit either H3K4me3 or H3K27me3."

                                "text": "This result raised the possibility that CpG frequency alone determines the chromatin state, with G + C content playing no role. To test this idea, we generated four different artificial DNA sequences that were CpG-rich to the same level as typical CGIs (10 CpGs/100 bp), but relatively A + T-rich in overall base composition (three of 40% and one of 50% G + C on average; <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a> and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>). Contrary to expectation, none of these insertions generated a focus of bivalent chromatin in multiple independent cell lines (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). A potential explanation for this finding came from an analysis of DNA methylation status, which showed that in replicate cell lines the CGIs had all become densely methylated at CpGs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). The striking contrast between the consistent methylation-free status of three separate G + C-rich, CpG-rich integrants and the reproducible dense methylation of four unrelated A + T-rich, CpG-rich sequences of the same length indicates that base composition is a strong determinant of DNA methylation status. A plot of G + C-content against percentage CpG methylation showed a sharp transition between 50 and 60% G + C (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Interestingly, a CGI-like insertion with a base composition of 55% G + C (MeCP2-eGFP) studied previously (<a href=\"#bib36\">Thomson et al., 2010</a>) showed an intermediate DNA methylation level, suggesting that it lies on the transition point for triggering de novo methylation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>)."

To test this hypothesis, we asked if removal of DNA methylation could restore bivalent chromatin at A + T-rich CpG-rich sequences by using mutant ESCs lacking the de novo DNA methyltransferases Dnmt 3a and Dnmt 3b (<a href=\"#bib32\">Okano et al., 1999</a>), which display severe DNA hypomethylation (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). To ensure that histone modifying enzyme activities are not disrupted in the <i>Dnmt 3a/3b</i> double knock out cells, we generated stable cell lines with the artificial CGI-containing BAC and confirmed that a bivalent domain was observed over the insertion (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). When the High CpG /High A + T construct was introduced into Dnmt 3a/3b knock out cells it now remained unmethylated, and importantly, bivalent chromatin was detected at the inserted sequence (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). We noticed that H3K4me3 was reproducibly weaker than controls in <i>Dnmt 3a/Dnmt 3b</i> double mutant cells, whereas a robust H3K27me3 signal was obtained. This may indicate that A + T-rich DNA is less able to recruit H3K4me3 despite its high CpG density. The dominance of the polycomb-associated H3K27me3 mark at A + T-rich CGIs was also seen when DNA methylation was partially reduced by growing cells for 10 days in 2i medium, which enhances the pluripotent state. In line with previous reports (<a href=\"#bib15\">Ficz et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Habibi et al., 2013</a>), we found that the average level of genomic CpG methylation was reduced from \u223c95% to \u223c55% (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Whereas cells grown in serum-containing medium lacked both the tested histone marks, 2i-grown cells displayed a strong increase in H3K27me3 without the appearance of noticeable H3K4me3 (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). We conclude that while CpG frequency is a key feature of CGIs that determines the signature chromatin marks at CGIs, A + T-richness confers an intrinsic susceptibility to de novo methylation that is dominant over these chromatin modifications (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>)."

The question arises: do equivalent atypical sequences exist naturally in the mouse genome and if so what is their chromatin modification status? We searched first for G + C-rich (\u226561%), CpG deficient (\u22641/100 bp) sequences of \u2265500 bp in length and identified 1954 examples. None of these coincided with bivalent chromatin in ESCs, in agreement with our results using synthetic DNA. To determine if A + T-rich, CpG-rich sequences also exist naturally in mice, we divided the genome into windows of 100 bp and calculated the G + C content and CpG density of each. To ensure that we selected regions with profiles consistently above the thresholds (as is the case for our artificial constructs) rather than short CpG dense regions flanked by AT rich DNA, we subtracted windows with \u226550% GC content or &lt;5 CpGs and searched for blocks of adjoining windows. Uniformly A + T-rich and CpG-rich DNA sequences of this kind were absent in the mouse genome. Even when the criteria were relaxed to include sequences of only 500 base pairs in length (the approximate minimum size of CGIs), we found no examples. As A + T-rich regions are consistently DNA methylated, it seems likely that, in the absence of strong selection, the high mutation rate of 5-methylcytosine effectively resists CpG accumulation at these domains over evolutionary time."

Our data reinforce the complementary view that the underlying genetic information, independent of nurture or developmental history, plays an important role in setting up CGI chromatin structures. In ESCs at least, each of the major CGI chromatin configurations is informed by DNA sequence. We find that the non-methylated state of CGIs depends on G + C-rich base composition and that both the signature histone marks H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 depend on a high density of the non-methylated CpG dyad. The importance of primary DNA sequence in determining bulk features of the epigenome have been suggested elsewhere. For example, DNA sequence motifs that are recognised by transcription factors strongly influence DNA methylation patterns (<a href=\"#bib26\">Lienert et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Stadler et al., 2011</a>) and inter-individual variation in other epigenomic features maps to sites of human DNA sequence heterogeneity that are probably causal (<a href=\"#bib21\">Kasowski et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Kilpinen et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">McVicker et al., 2013</a>).

Almost all native CGIs in mouse ESCs are non-methylated at the DNA level and coincide with peaks of H3K4me3, which is often seen as the signature histone mark of CGIs (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bernstein et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Thomson et al., 2010</a>). About one third of the H3K4me3-marked CGIs in mouse ES cells also carry H3K27me3 and are therefore defined as bivalent (<a href=\"#bib23\">Ku et al., 2008</a>). H3K27me3 is usually relatively dispersed compared with the discrete localisation of components of the PRC2 complex, which deposit this mark. It is estimated that at least 97% of peaks corresponding to the PRC2 component Ezh2 coincide with CGIs (<a href=\"#bib23\">Ku et al., 2008</a>). This has led to the suggestion that polycomb is targeted to G + C-rich or CpG-rich DNA (<a href=\"#bib35\">Tanay et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Mendenhall et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Lynch et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Long et al., 2013</a>). It was shown previously that CpG density within the non-methylated CGI fraction as a whole is proportional to the H3K4me3 ChIP-seq signal in both mouse and human cells (<a href=\"#bib19\">Illingworth et al., 2010</a>). We asked whether the same relationship holds true for bivalent CGIs and whether it also applies to H3K27me3. Within a set of 2547 exclusively bivalent promoters from mouse ESCs (<a href=\"#bib29\">Marks et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Denissov et al., 2014</a>), we found that 92% coincide with CGIs. Within this bivalent group, CGI length and CpG density both correlate positively with H3K4me3 and also H3K27me3 levels (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). In contrast to typical CGI-like sequences, endogenous G + C-rich, CpG-poor sequences do not display a bivalent chromatin structure. A + T-rich, CpG-rich domains of CGI-like dimensions, however, are effectively absent from the mouse genome. The sum of available data argues strongly that a high abundance of the dinucleotide CpG is a key precondition for the formation of bivalent chromatin."

In Mll1 and Mll2 the DNA binding domains are within the SET-containing protein themselves (<a href=\"#bib1\">Allen et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Cierpicki et al., 2010</a>), whereas in the case of Set1/COMPASS the CXXC domain resides in the Cfp1 protein component of the multi-subunit complex (<a href=\"#bib24\">Lee and Skalnik, 2005</a>). The H3K4me3 component of bivalent CGIs in ESCs depends on Mll2 (<a href=\"#bib18\">Hu et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Denissov et al., 2014</a>). Accordingly, we have found that bivalent CGIs form normally in <i>Cfp1</i>\u2212/\u2212 ES cells. Since the binding of the CXXC domain to CpG is abolished by methylation of the cytosine moiety (<a href=\"#bib25\">Lee et al., 2001</a>), this may explain why DNA methylation prevents the formation of H3K4me3 even in the presence of high CpG densities. The mechanism responsible for recruiting PRC2, which is the complex responsible for the establishment of H3K27me3, remains uncertain, as no CpG binding component of PRC2 has yet been detected. (<a href=\"#bib36\">Thomson et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Hu et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Wu et al., 2013</a>). A recent study, however, indicates that the CXXC-domain protein KDM2B can target the PRC1 complex to CGIs and recruit PRC2 secondarily, which would accord with our findings (<a href=\"#bib5\">Blackledge et al., 2014</a>)."

It is suggested that the poised state is resolved during differentiation as the affected gene becomes either transcriptionally activated or repressed. Recent evidence has clearly established that H3K27me and H3K4me can be present on the same nucleosome, albeit on different histone tails (<a href=\"#bib37\">Voigt et al., 2012</a>). The biological significance of bivalent chromatin has recently become less certain, however. Whereas silent CGI promoters in ESCs grown in serum usually exhibit a bivalent chromatin structure, this chromatin configuration is significantly reduced in 2i medium, which discourages differentiation and is thought to induce a more pronounced pluripotent state (<a href=\"#bib29\">Marks et al., 2012</a>). Also, cells in which the histone methyltransferase Mll2 is depleted lose H3K4me3 at hitherto bivalent CGIs, but this has no detectable effect on the induction kinetics of the associated genes upon differentiation (<a href=\"#bib18\">Hu et al., 2013</a>). The evidence remains inconclusive, but it raises the possibility that bivalency is not an essential precondition for gene activation during differentiation. Here we find that bivalency is not confined to poised developmental genes but is a default response to any CpG-rich DNA sequences, even when these are completely artificial. It is apparent from this that the bivalent chromatin structure is not reserved for developmentally important genes, but is a response to general features of local DNA sequence."

The transfection experiments reported here recapitulate this distinction as G + C-rich CGI-like DNA reproducibly resisted DNA methylation, whereas A + T-rich DNA reliably became densely methylated. Our findings raise the possibility that this broadly binary pattern of global DNA methylation may be determined by base composition. CpG density did not affect this susceptibility to methylation, which occurred even when CpG occurred at densities typical of endogenous CGIs. Two simple alternative explanations are possible: either A + T-rich DNA attracts de novo methylation, or G + C-richness excludes it, leaving the bulk genome to be methylated by default. Both Dnmt 3L and Dnmt 3A have the potential to be repelled by H3K4me3 (<a href=\"#bib20\">Jia et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Ooi et al., 2007</a>), suggesting that recruitment of H3K4 methyltransferases with CpG-binding CXXC domains protects CGIs against de novo methylation. We find, however, that A + T-rich CpG-rich sequences are reproducibly DNA methylated despite their ability to attract H3K4me3 when DNA methylation is absent. Since these sequences were initially non-methylated when transfected into cells, it may be that H3K4me3 alone is not sufficient to exclude CpG methylation from these regions. This would accord with our previous observation that a moderately G + C-rich artificial CGI when inserted into ES cells was extensively methylated despite the presence of H3K4me3 on non-methylated copies (<a href=\"#bib36\">Thomson et al., 2010</a>). Alternatively, A + T-rich CpG-rich sequences may attract H3K4me3 less robustly than G + C-rich CGIs, thereby allowing access to de novo DNA methyltransferases."

Since A + T-rich sequences are susceptible to de novo DNA methylation in mammals, it follows that some vertebrate groups may rely on a different set of mechanisms to prevent methylation at G + C-poor CGIs.

                                "text": "Chemical crosslink of chromatin was performed for 10 min at room temperature by addition of formaldehyde to a final concentration of 1%. Crosslinking was stopped by addition of glycine to a final concentration of 0.125 mM. After 5 min incubation cells were washed twice with ice-cold 1\u00d7 PBS. If acetylation was examined, sodium butyrate was added to the PBS. Cells were centrifuged for 5 min at 330\u00d7g at 4\u00b0C and washed once in wash buffer A (0.25% Triton X-100, 10 mM EDTA pH 8.0, 0.5 mM EGTA pH 7.5, 10 mM, HEPES pH 7.5) and B (0.2M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA pH 8.0, 0.5 mM EGTA pH 7.5, 10 mM HEPES pH 7.5). Each buffer contained PMSF to a final concentration of 1 \u03bcg/ml, 1\u00d7 Proteinase Inhibitor Complete Mix (Roche, UK) and 10 mM sodium butyrate. Cells were re-suspended in lysis buffer (20% SDS, 0.5 M EDTA, 1 M Tris pH 8.1, 1\u00d7 complete protease inhibitors, 1 \u03bcg/ml PMSF, 10 mM sodium butyrate). Chromatin was sheared to 400\u2013600 base pair fragments by sonication of the cell lysate using a twin Bioruptor (Diagenode, Belgium) for 15 cycles, 30 s on, 30 s off on high setting. The lysate was centrifuged for 10 min at 16,000\u00d7g at 4\u00b0C to collect cellular debris. Chromatin concentration was measured on a Nanodrop spectrophotometer. Chromatin (30 \u03bcg or 100 \u03bcg) was used for ChIP with antibodies against histone modifications or other proteins. For the ChIP, chromatin was made up to 100 \u03bcl with lysis buffer and 900 \u03bcl of dilution buffer (20 mM Tris\u2013HCl, pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM EDTA) were added. Antibodies were added as specified and samples were incubated o/n at 4\u00b0C on a rotating wheel. The next day debris was removed by centrifugation for 5 min at 16,000\u00d7g and 50 \u03bcl dynabeads protein G (Life Technologies, UK) were added to the supernatant of the IPs and samples were incubated on a rotating wheel for 2 hr at 4\u00b0C. IPs were washed 3\u00d7 with 1 ml ice-cold wash buffer 1 (20 mM Tris\u2013HCl, pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% SDS), 2\u00d7 with ice-cold wash buffer 2 (20 mM Tris\u2013HCl, pH 8, 500 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% SDS) and 1\u00d7 with ice-cold TE. 100 \u03bcl or 50 \u03bcl of freshly prepared 10% Chelex 100 Resin (100\u2013200 mesh, BioRad) were added to samples or input respectively. Samples were boiled for 12 min, cooled to RT. Proteinase K (2 \u03bcl of 20 mg/ml) was added and incubated at 55\u00b0C for 30 min while shaking. After heating to 100\u00b0C, samples were spun down and 60 \u03bcl supernatant were transferred to fresh tubes. Each sample was made up to 300 \u03bcl total volume with 10 mM Tris pH 8, 0.1 mM EDTA and assayed by q-PCR."

PCR was carried out using a Roche Lightcycler and cycling conditions were as follows; initial denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 10 min followed by 45 cycles of denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 10 s, primer annealing for 10 s and primer extension at 72\u00b0C for 15 s. Using the Roche Lightcycler software, SYBR Green fluorescence measurements were plotted relative to cycle number and the 2nd derivative maximum method was used to determine the cycle threshold values (Ct) for each sample. Values for duplicate of triplicate ChIP samples were calculated as %-input and copy number of artificial CGIs was assessed relative to Sox2 qPCR signal."

The results closely reproduced the DNA methylation levels reported in this manuscript and they showed lower levels of methylation at the <i>Dlx5</i> CGI as expected (see data below). Therefore, the somewhat higher-than-expected level of methylation at these artificial CGIs is replicated and is not due to incomplete bisulfite conversion (conversion levels averaged 98%). We now point out in the Results section that methylation of these artificial CGI-like sequences in a gene desert setting is somewhat higher than at an endogenous CGI in the same cells. In our opinion 10% methylation nevertheless qualifies as hypomethylated compared with the genome-wide average of \u223c70%. Therefore this modest level of DNA methylation does not affect the conclusion that these sequences are hypomethylated. We do not plan to add the new bisulfite data to the manuscript."

                    "text": "We acknowledge that in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> the proportions of input DNA that are immunoprecipitated in different cell lines vary over a wide range. The reason is that these studies were not carried out in parallel, but over almost 12 months, using chromatin samples prepared at different times and assayed with different antibodies (often from different suppliers) with varying affinities. In particular, deletion of the neomycin cassette in cell line 3 initially failed and there was a delay while this step was repeated during which we had to switch H3K4me3 antibodies. In our opinion the interpretation of the results is not compromised by the observed variability, which in our hands is inherent to ChIP experiments on samples of diverse origin with changing reagents. The important point with respect to our conclusions is that the relative values of control and experimental data points are consistent between experiments even when absolute precipitation levels vary. We now draw attention to the variability in the Results section and offer a brief explanation."
