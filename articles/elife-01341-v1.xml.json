                    "text": "Information flow through neural circuits is determined by the nature of the synapses linking the subtypes of neurons. How neurons acquire features distinct to each synapse remains unknown. We show that the transcription factor Mafb drives the formation of auditory ribbon synapses, which are specialized for rapid transmission from hair cells to spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs). Mafb acts in SGNs to drive differentiation of the large postsynaptic density (PSD) characteristic of the ribbon synapse. In <i>Mafb</i> mutant mice, SGNs fail to develop normal PSDs, leading to reduced synapse number and impaired auditory responses. Conversely, increased Mafb accelerates synaptogenesis. Moreover, Mafb is responsible for executing one branch of the SGN differentiation program orchestrated by the Gata3 transcriptional network. Remarkably, restoration of Mafb rescues the synapse defect in <i>Gata3</i> mutants. Hence, Mafb is a powerful regulator of cell-type specific features of auditory synaptogenesis that offers a new entry point for treating hearing loss."

How neurons acquire features distinct to each synapse remains unknown. We show that the transcription factor Mafb drives the formation of auditory ribbon synapses, which are specialized for rapid transmission from hair cells to spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs). Mafb acts in SGNs to drive differentiation of the large postsynaptic density (PSD) characteristic of the ribbon synapse. In <i>Mafb</i> mutant mice, SGNs fail to develop normal PSDs, leading to reduced synapse number and impaired auditory responses. Conversely, increased Mafb accelerates synaptogenesis. Moreover, Mafb is responsible for executing one branch of the SGN differentiation program orchestrated by the Gata3 transcriptional network. Remarkably, restoration of Mafb rescues the synapse defect in <i>Gata3</i> mutants. Hence, Mafb is a powerful regulator of cell-type specific features of auditory synaptogenesis that offers a new entry point for treating hearing loss."

In the auditory system, for example, it is essential for the timing of signals to be preserved as they are sent from the ear to the brain, and this places special demands on the synapses in this part of the nervous system. In particular, the ribbon synapses that are found between the inner hair cells of the ear, which convert sound waves into neural signals, and the neurons of the spiral ganglion in the cochlea, which carry information about the frequency, intensity and timing of sounds to the brain, can transmit signals with remarkable fidelity."

Yu et al. also studied mice in which Gata3 was absent: normally Mafb would not be present in these mice, but when genetic techniques were used to force the expression of the gene for Mafb, ribbon synapses were formed. As well as revealing a molecular pathway by which synapses become specialized for rapid and accurate transmission of auditory information, these findings might lead to new approaches to treating hearing loss in humans."

How information is processed and transmitted is determined both by the identity of the neurons in the circuit and the nature of their synaptic connections. Indeed, synapses exhibit a range of morphologies and functions, varying both the nature of the signal and its strength. Recent efforts to unravel the molecular basis of synaptic specificity have begun to define the mechanisms that match pre- and post-synaptic partners and thereby establish the overall wiring pattern. These studies suggest that the fate of each partner is determined by cell-type specific transcription factors, which activate expression of a unique combination of cell-surface receptors to permit adhesion only between appropriate partners (<a href=\"#bib44\">Polleux et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Sanes and Yamagata, 2009</a>). In contrast, we still know very little about how each partner is subsequently instructed to develop the appropriate type of pre- or post-synaptic specialization required at that synapse. Although several broadly acting transcription factors have been shown to control synapse number, the identity of the transcription factors that might direct cell-type specific features of synaptic development remains elusive."

As the sole link between IHCs and the brain, SGNs encode the frequency, intensity, and timing of all acoustic stimuli and communicate this information rapidly and faithfully to the brain (<a href=\"#bib3\">Appler and Goodrich, 2011</a>). To achieve the necessary speed, SGNs receive information from IHCs via ribbon synapses that are specialized for signaling with high temporal precision (<a href=\"#bib26\">Khimich et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Glowatzki et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Buran et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Safieddine et al., 2012</a>). Unlike conventional synapses, ribbon synapses contain an electron-dense multi-protein ribbon structure, which tethers a large pool of readily releasable vesicles (<a href=\"#bib59\">Sterling and Matthews, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Goutman and Glowatzki, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Frank et al., 2010</a>), thereby enabling fast and sustained release of glutamate from the IHCs (<a href=\"#bib16\">Glowatzki and Fuchs, 2002</a>). Likewise, SGNs respond with remarkable speed due to a large postsynaptic density (PSD) containing abundant clusters of AMPA-type receptors (<a href=\"#bib37\">Matsubara et al., 1996</a>). Since the features of all sound stimuli are captured by the pattern of synaptic transmission between IHCs and SGNs, developing the correct number and types of synapses is critical for hearing. Indeed, auditory synaptopathies underlie several forms of hearing loss (<a href=\"#bib40\">Moser et al., 2013</a>), and ribbon synapses are particularly vulnerable to acoustic overexposure (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kujawa and Liberman, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Lin et al., 2011</a>)."

In mice, ribbon synapses begin to develop perinatally (<a href=\"#bib56\">Sobkowicz et al., 1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Nemzou et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Sendin et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Marrs and Spirou, 2012</a>). Presynaptic ribbons are initially distributed throughout the IHC cytoplasm and then gradually localize to the basolateral surface to form an immature synapse, with clustered ribbons in large active zones (<a href=\"#bib56\">Sobkowicz et al., 1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Sendin et al., 2007</a>). In parallel, SGN neurites reach IHCs and begin to elaborate post-synaptic terminals, characterized by increased clustering of GluR2/R3 AMPA receptors in the nascent PSD (<a href=\"#bib24\">Huang et al., 2012</a>). Ribbon number peaks at the end of the first postnatal week, followed by a period of pruning and refinement. By the onset of hearing (postnatal day 12 [P12] in mice), ribbon number has declined to adult levels and each ribbon is anchored opposite a specialized large, well-defined PSD in the SGN terminal (<a href=\"#bib56\">Sobkowicz et al., 1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Nemzou et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Sendin et al., 2007</a>). In mature animals, the size of the PSD correlates with the size and position of the ribbon (<a href=\"#bib30\">Liberman et al., 2011</a>), indicating that pre- and post-synaptic development must be tightly coordinated. Indeed, without SGN afferent terminals, ribbon development in IHCs is impaired (<a href=\"#bib57\">Sobkowicz et al., 1986</a>), and conversely, afferent terminals are not stabilized in mutants lacking normal ribbons (<a href=\"#bib55\">Sheets et al., 2011</a>). However, the molecular mechanisms that allow SGNs to form these unusual connections with IHCs remain a mystery."

One particularly intriguing putative downstream effector is the basic leucine-zipper transcription factor Mafb. Mafb belongs to the family of large Maf factors, which activate cell-type specific programs of gene expression essential for terminal differentiation of a wide variety of cell types, including pancreatic \u03b2 cells, kidney podocytes, and macrophages (<a href=\"#bib39\">Moriguchi et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Kataoka, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Hang and Stein, 2011</a>). <i>Mafb</i> was first identified as the genetic cause of the <i>kreisler</i> mutation (<i>kr</i>) in mice (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cordes and Barsh, 1994</a>). In <i>kr</i> mutants, rhombomeres 5 and 6 are not properly specified, and the otic vesicle, which develops adjacent to these structures, fails to acquire its normal morphology. Although its function in the nervous system remains unclear, <i>Mafb</i> is also required in the pre-B\u00f6tzinger complex in the hindbrain (<a href=\"#bib5\">Blanchi et al., 2003</a>): respiratory circuits are unable to mediate normal breathing in <i>Mafb</i> mutants, which die from central apnea at birth.

Mafb is enriched in SGNs during synaptogenesis. Further, deletion of Mafb from SGNs disrupts post-synaptic differentiation, leading to an overall reduction in ribbon synapse number and hence impaired auditory responses. Conversely, restoration of Mafb is sufficient to rescue the synaptic defect seen in <i>Gata3</i> mutant mice. These studies establish Mafb as a lineage-specific intrinsic regulator in SGNs for post-synaptic specification of ribbon synapses and a powerful effector within a broader Gata3 network during auditory circuit assembly."

SGN neurogenesis occurs along a base to apex gradient, with most SGNs exiting the cell cycle by E12.5 and extending projections to reach the organ of Corti by E15.5 (<a href=\"#bib36\">Matei et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Koundakjian et al., 2007</a>). In situ hybridization confirmed that <i>Mafb</i> transcription initiates in parallel with the end of neurogenesis, with expression evident in the basal to middle regions of the cochlea by E13.5 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Protein was not yet present at this stage (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,C\u2032</a>). Two days later, Mafb protein could be detected in SGNs in the basal and middle turns (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>) and by E16.5, Mafb protein was localized to SGN nuclei along the entire length of the cochlea (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). High levels of Mafb persisted during early postnatal stages (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F,J</a>) and peaked at P6 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G,J</a>). Afterward, Mafb was gradually translocated from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, and only a few SGNs maintained strong nuclear expression by P10 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>, arrows). After the onset of hearing, Mafb was still present at low levels in the SGN cytoplasm (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1I,J</a>). At all stages, Mafb expression was limited to SGNs, with no protein detected in VGNs (data not shown) or other cell types of the inner ear. Hence, Mafb defines the SGN subset of inner ear neurons and is expressed throughout auditory synaptogenesis, which begins around perinatal stages and lasts for the first two postnatal weeks, peaking around P6 (<a href=\"#bib56\">Sobkowicz et al., 1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Huang et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Safieddine et al., 2012</a>)."

Ultrastructural analysis revealed that mutant SGNs still contact IHCs, indicating normal targeting (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). We therefore asked whether these contacts were able to develop into synapses. Ribbon synapses were assessed by staining for the postsynaptic marker GluR2, labeling a subunit of the AMPA receptor, and the presynaptic marker CtBP2, labeling the B domain of the RIBEYE scaffolding protein (<a href=\"#bib53\">Schmitz et al., 2000</a>). The use of anti-GluR2 antibodies ensured that we only analyzed contacts between SGNs and IHCs, as other post-synaptic markers are also present in other types of synapses in the cochlea (<a href=\"#bib26\">Khimich et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Nemzou et al., 2006</a>). Hence, ribbon synapses were reliably identified as juxtaposed pairs of immunofluorescent puncta of postsynaptic GluR2 and presynaptic CtBP2 (<a href=\"#bib26\">Khimich et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Liberman et al., 2011</a>). Because the number of IHC ribbon synapses differs along the tonotopic axis (<a href=\"#bib38\">Meyer et al., 2009</a>), we were careful to compare the same region between cochleae (around 16 kHz, see \u2018Materials and Methods\u2019)."

This loss of postsynaptic clustering of GluR2 appears to reflect an overall failure in PSD development, as ultrastructural studies revealed a clear disruption in PSD morphology at P6. During this period of active synapse development and refinement in the mouse cochlea, IHCs contain both anchored ribbons, which are localized to the cell surface, and floating ribbons, which are initially free in the cytoplasm and can become anchored as the cochlea matures. In control mice, anchored ribbons faced a large, well-defined PSD in the apposing SGN terminal (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,D</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1E,F</a>).

Over the next several days, RIBEYE assembled into larger complexes that stained more brightly and were confined to the basal pole of the IHC (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2032</a>). In contrast, anti-CtBP2 immunofluorescence intensity was noticeably reduced in <i>Mafb</i><sup><i>CKO</i></sup> mutants at P6 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B\u2032</a>), consistent with observation of small ribbons in electron micrographs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>). In addition, ribbon number was significantly decreased (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4L</a>, <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Although GluR2 immunofluorescence was not bright enough to assess PSD differentiation before P6 (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1C,D</a>), CtBP2 intensity was also diminished at P3 (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1D\u2032</a>), suggesting that SGN post-synaptic differentiation is impaired from the earliest stages. Thus, <i>Mafb</i> mutant SGNs fail to elaborate the specialized PSDs that are characteristic of auditory ribbon synapses, apparently leading to defects in the development and anchoring of presynaptic ribbons in the IHCs."

The loss of GluR2 and CtBP2 puncta was observed along the entire length of the mutant cochlea (data not shown). Additionally, close examination of individual pre- and post-synaptic puncta showed that many CtBP2-positive ribbons were not paired with a corresponding GluR2 spot (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4I,J</a>). This stands in contrast to control animals, where an individual ribbon is reliably juxtaposed to a single GluR2-positive terminal by this stage (<a href=\"#bib26\">Khimich et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Nemzou et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Sendin et al., 2007</a>). Hence, the overall loss of synapses seems to originate with a defect in the PSD. This phenotype is not due to a general decrease in the transcription of PSD components, as the expression levels of <i>GluR2</i> and <i>PSD95</i> transcripts were similar between control and <i>Mafb</i> mutant SGNs (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

To determine how auditory function is altered when synapse development is disrupted, we measured Auditory Brainstem Responses (ABRs) in <i>Mafb</i><sup><i>CKO</i></sup> animals. ABRs reflect the electrical responses of neurons in the cochlea and auditory brainstem to sound stimuli. Acoustic sensitivity is determined by identifying the lowest sound pressure level (SPL) (the threshold) that is able to elicit a response. ABRs were recorded in response to pure tone bursts of 5.6, 8, 11.3, 16, 22.6, 32, and 45.2 kHz. Control mice produced characteristic ABR waveforms in response to all stimuli, with thresholds ranging between 15 and 45 dB SPL depending on the frequency of the stimulus. In contrast, <i>Mafb</i><sup><i>CKO</i></sup> mice showed dampened ABR waveforms and elevated auditory thresholds, with thresholds increased \u223c10 dB SPL across stimuli of all frequencies (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B,D</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Thresholds of <i>Mafb</i><sup><i>CKO</i></sup> mice were significantly higher for all frequencies measured except the lowest and highest frequencies, since sensitivity is already reduced in these regions of control cochleae (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>) (<i>p</i> values: 5.6 kHz=0.125, 8 kHz=0.044, 11.3 kHz=0.043, 16 kHz=0.031, 22.6 kHz=0.038, 32 kHz=0.047, 45.2 kHz=0.140; n = 16 controls and 16 mutants). We also investigated whether this impaired auditory response involved an OHC defect by recording distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs). DPOAE levels were not significantly different in <i>Mafb</i><sup><i>CKO</i></sup> vs control mice, regardless of the frequency and intensity of the stimulus used (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>), indicating that hair cell function is largely normal. Hence, the ABR threshold elevation is mainly caused by the reduced activation of SGNs by sound stimuli."

We wondered whether the diminished ABR responses in mutants could be explained entirely by the loss of synapses or whether other aspects of SGN responsiveness were also altered. Electrophysiological recordings offer a highly sensitive read-out of SGN function that can reveal differences in membrane potential and firing properties. Accordingly, we performed whole-cell recordings of SGNs in organotypic explants, acutely dissected at P3.

To assess the distribution of ribbons independent of the angle at which each IHC was imaged, we measured the distance from each ribbon to its nearest neighbor; this distance is predicted to be shorter when ribbons are more tightly localized (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7H</a>). Indeed, the nearest-neighbor distance of ribbons in P6 <i>Mafb</i><sup><i>CE</i></sup> mice was significantly shorter (1.83 \u00b1 0.03 \u00b5m, n = 428 ribbons) than in controls (2.06 \u00b1 0.04 \u00b5m, n = 407 ribbons) (<i>p</i>&lt;0.0001) (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7I</a>).

The earliest acting transcription factors are master regulators, which induce multiple parallel changes in gene expression that reinforce cell fate and promote differentiation. The endpoint of the cascade is the activation of so-called terminal selectors, which induce batteries of genes essential for that neuron\u2019s functional properties. Terminal selectors work combinatorially, with multiple transcription factors cooperating to regulate sets of terminal effector genes that are necessary for each neuron\u2019s mature identity, such as neurotransmitters, channels, and synaptic adhesion molecules (<a href=\"#bib23\">Hobert, 2011</a>). For example, the ETS-factor Ast-1 activates expression of genes essential for dopamine synthesis and transport in dopaminergic neurons (<a href=\"#bib23\">Hobert, 2011</a>), acting together with Dlx and Pbx-family transcription factors (<a href=\"#bib11\">Doitsidou et al., 2013</a>). Identifying analogous terminal selectors in vertebrates has been more challenging, due to the increased complexity of neuronal phenotypes, as well as the difficulty in defining discrete regulatory elements. Hence, the only established examples are for easily recognized features of mature neurons, such as the control of serotonin production by the transcription factor Pet1 (<a href=\"#bib32\">Liu et al., 2010</a>)."

Thus, there may be a Maf code for SGN terminal differentiation, with each factor directing a different feature required for mature function."

Terminal selectors are typically recognized by two consistent characteristics: the ability to activate cell-type appropriate gene expression during terminal differentiation and an ongoing role in the maintenance of critical genes in the mature neuron (<a href=\"#bib23\">Hobert, 2011</a>). Consistent with this definition, Mafb is not expressed until late in differentiation, just a day before functional synapses can first be detected (<a href=\"#bib35\">Marrs and Spirou, 2012</a>), suggesting that Mafb may activate expression of terminal effectors that drive synapse formation. Additionally, Mafb is both necessary and sufficient for the acquisition of a key feature of mature SGN function, that is the ability to receive information from IHCs. Whether Mafb plays an ongoing role in SGNs remains to be determined, but its persistent expression in adults fulfills another important criterion. Notably, the output of any one terminal selector is strongly influenced by cellular context, so individual terminal selectors can also be expressed in other subtypes of neurons and not all neurons of the same subtype depend on the same set of terminal selectors (<a href=\"#bib11\">Doitsidou et al., 2013</a>). Similarly, the absence of Mafb from vestibular ganglion neurons, which also form ribbon synapses, suggests that different sets of transcription factors may act in SGNs and VGNs to control post-synaptic differentiation. Additional support for a terminal selector function for Mafb awaits identification of direct target genes, studies that may ultimately reveal effects on other auditory-specific features of SGN function."

                        "text": "Our findings raise the possibility that Mafb\u2019s effects might extend to other neuronal populations. Indeed, Mafb is expressed by a handful of other neuronal subtypes and could play a similar role in the emergence of their cell-type specific properties, including but not limited to synaptic differentiation. For instance, in addition to being expressed in SGNs, Mafb is also expressed in cochlear nucleus bushy cells (<a href=\"#bib52\">Saul et al., 2008</a>), which receive synaptic input from SGNs. Similarly, Mafb defines subsets of cortical interneurons (<a href=\"#bib61\">Wang et al., 2010</a>) and a subpopulation of rhythmogenic neurons within the pre-B\u00f6tzinger complex (<a href=\"#bib5\">Blanchi et al., 2003</a>). Currently, the specific function of Mafb in other neuronal populations remains obscure, due both to the lethality of null mutants and the lack of tools for detecting subtle synaptic defects in other regions of the nervous system. With the availability of the new conditional alleles reported here, it will be important to investigate Mafb\u2019s activities in other regions of the nervous system in the future. In addition, our results suggest that similar late acting transcription factors may play analogous roles in other subtypes of neurons, functioning after synaptic targeting to ensure that each neuron elaborates the correct type of synapse necessary for proper circuit function."

                        "text": "Mafb\u2019s ability to direct auditory synaptogenesis even in pathological situations opens up the exciting possibility of harnessing this power to repair the damaged cochlea. One of the earliest effects of acoustic overexposure is the loss of synapses followed by withdrawal of SGN terminals. The SGNs subsequently undergo a long slow degeneration, ultimately resulting in significant hearing loss long after the original injury (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kujawa and Liberman, 2009</a>). Our results suggest that stimulation of Mafb might be sufficient to encourage damaged neurons to re-establish connections with IHCs. Moreover, the specificity of Mafb\u2019s effects implies that synapses could be restored without inadvertently interfering with other aspects of SGN function. Importantly, we find that Mafb is still present in the adult cochlea (data not shown), largely sequestered in the cytoplasm. This observation emphasizes the need for further characterization of the post-translational modifications that affect the localization and transactivation activity of Mafb. Ultimately, drugs that enhance translocation of Mafb into the nucleus might offer a new treatment for deafness. Similarly, understanding how the Gata3\u2013Mafb cascade is deployed will be critical for the development of stem cell-based replacement therapies. Indeed, recent studies have shown that functional dopaminergic and spinal motor neurons can be directly generated from somatic cells by ectopic expression of lineage specific transcription factors (<a href=\"#bib8\">Caiazzo et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Son et al., 2011</a>), thereby avoiding the need for surgical implantation of stem cells. With the discovery of transcription factors such as Neurogenin1, NeuroD1, Gata3, and Mafb, such an approach may eventually be possible in the cochlea."

A 512 \u00d7 512 binary image was acquired at optimal step size in the Z axis (0.55 \u00b5m for 40X and 0.45 \u00b5m for 60X). For confocal imaging of CtBP2 and GluR2 staining, z-stacks from the 16 kHz region were obtained on an Olympus FluoView FV1000 using a 60X (NA:1.40) oil-immersion objective and 2.5X digital zoom. A 512 \u00d7 512 (pixel size = 0.165 \u00b5m in x and y) binary image was acquired at 0.45-\u00b5m step size in the Z axis, resulting in an image containing approximately 10 IHCs.

For measurement of the three-dimensional distance to nearest neighbor, x, y, and z coordinates of all ribbons were exported from Amira to Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA). Each ribbon was assigned manually to an IHC according to the x, y, and z coordinates of a 3D rendering of the Myo7A \u2018isosurfaces\u2019.

In a <i>Mafb</i> conditional mutant, SGNs have smaller PSD and reduced GluR2 clustering (puncta), and these defects in turn lead to reduced presynaptic ribbons in hair cells. Expressing Mafb earlier in SGN development caused earlier clustering of GluR2, but did not affect the mature patterns of hair cell-SGN synapses. Electrophysiology recording confirmed that defects in synapse formation caused abnormal auditory responses."

However, we feel that this is an attractive idea to consider, since Mafb is activated during terminal differentiation, is required for a key step in SGN differentiation, and continues to be expressed in adult SGNs. The fact that Mafb is absent from a different population of neurons that also makes ribbon synapses does not rule out a terminal selector function. In fact, terminal selectors work combinatorially and cooperatively. Hence, an individual terminal selector may be present in a variety of cell types but can only activate a particular set of effector genes when other transcription factors are also present. Moreover, the same set of effector genes can be regulated by different combinations of transcription factors, as shown recently for regulation of dopamine pathway genes in different subtypes of dopaminergic neurons in <i>C. elegans</i> (<a href=\"#bib11\">Doitsidou et al., 2013</a>). Similarly, vestibular ganglion neurons may employ different combinations of transcription factors for regulation of post-synaptic differentiation, possibly including other Maf factors. Along the same lines, Mafb may require the presence of additional factors in order to alter synapse number permanently when misexpressed. Alternatively, pruning mechanisms may overcome the synapse-promoting effects of Mafb."

With regards to the scenario presented, it is certainly possible that Mafb induces expression of a synaptogenic adhesion molecule, but this alone would not be sufficient to reject the terminal selector possibility, particularly if ongoing expression of that molecule is necessary for maintenance of the mature synapse. We hesitate to make any conclusions for or against the proposed model based on the data shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, as there are also other interpretations. We have rewritten the Discussion to make these points clearer without overstating a possible role for Mafb as a terminal selector."

We had focused on the change in timing because Western blot analysis did not reveal an obvious increase in the amount of Mafb at postnatal stages, when Mafb is already present in abundance (data not shown). Unfortunately, we were not able to measure Mafb levels earlier, as it is technically challenging to collect sufficient spiral ganglia from mice with different genotypes at embryonic stages for Western Blots. However, as one would predict given the earlier onset of expression, immunostaining between E12.5 to E16.5 indicated that the level of Mafb proteins is higher in <i>Mafb<sup>CE</sup></i> SGNs when compared to control SGNs at the same stage. The cumulative effects of increased levels of Mafb over this long period of time could indeed explain the accelerated changes in synapse development we see at P6.
