However, there is relatively little evidence for such cortical reorganisation over the short-term. Using human somatosensory cortex as a model, we investigated the effects of a 24 hr gluing manipulation in which the right index and right middle fingers (digits 2 and 3) were adjoined with surgical glue. Somatotopic representations, assessed with two 7 tesla fMRI protocols, revealed rapid off-target reorganisation in the non-manipulated fingers following gluing, with the representation of the ring finger (digit 4) shifted towards the little finger (digit 5) and away from the middle finger (digit 3). These shifts were also evident in two behavioural tasks conducted in an independent cohort, showing reduced sensitivity for discriminating the temporal order of stimuli to the ring and little fingers, and increased substitution errors across this pair on a speeded reaction time task."

However, there is relatively little evidence for such cortical reorganisation over the short-term. Using human somatosensory cortex as a model, we investigated the effects of a 24 hr gluing manipulation in which the right index and right middle fingers (digits 2 and 3) were adjoined with surgical glue. Somatotopic representations, assessed with two 7 tesla fMRI protocols, revealed rapid off-target reorganisation in the non-manipulated fingers following gluing, with the representation of the ring finger (digit 4) shifted towards the little finger (digit 5) and away from the middle finger (digit 3). These shifts were also evident in two behavioural tasks conducted in an independent cohort, showing reduced sensitivity for discriminating the temporal order of stimuli to the ring and little fingers, and increased substitution errors across this pair on a speeded reaction time task."

However, only limited longitudinal evidence exists that directly demonstrates remapping at the level of human SI, either in response to altered hand usage patterns (<a href=\"#bib49\">Stavrinou et al., 2007</a>) or more intensive Hebbian co-activation paradigms delivering specific patterns of tactile stimulation to the fingertips (<a href=\"#bib40\">Pleger et al., 2001</a>, <a href=\"#bib41\">2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Hodzic et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Vidyasagar et al., 2014</a>).

First, can experience-dependent plastic remapping of SI somatotopy be elicited in the human cortex in just 24 hr? Second, are any observed cortical changes reflected in altered tactile function? A complementary combination of fMRI and behavioural psychophysics were used to investigate the effect of a 24 hr manipulation in which the right index (D2) and right middle digit (D3) were joined together using skin glue. Based on the primate literature (<a href=\"#bib7\">Clark et al., 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Allard et al., 1991</a>), we hypothesised that forced co-use of the glued digit pair would result in increased tactile co-activation across the digits, and an increase in their shared cortical representation. An alternative hypothesis posited that compensatory behaviour during the 24 hr gluing manipulation would promote changes in the cortical representations of adjacent, but unaffected digits."

In each session, fMRI data were acquired during a block design task and phase-encoding task. We first asked whether the amount of cortical overlap between digit representations in SI changed after the gluing manipulation in comparison with two control sessions using the phase-encoding fMRI data. Measures of inter-digit overlap were calculated for adjacent digit pairs (D2-D3: index-middle, D3-D4: middle-ring, D4-D5: ring-little; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). A two-way repeated measures ANOVA indicated a significant interaction between session and digit pair on the amount of cortical overlap (<i>F</i><sub>(4,32)</sub>\u00a0=\u00a013.412, p&lt;0.0005, <i>\u03b7</i><sup>2</sup>:0.626) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>).

The same experimental design and gluing manipulation were applied in a separate cohort. Instead of an fMRI scan, nine participants undertook behavioural psychophysics tasks during each session. The first task involved temporal order judgment (TOJ), where pairs of rapid vibrotactile stimuli were applied to adjacent digit pairs of the right hand at varying interstimulus intervals. Participants judged which digit was stimulated first. A psychometric function was fitted to the resulting accuracy data, from which a metric of tactile discrimination ability was calculated for each adjacent digit pair (Just Noticeable Difference: JND). Greater values of JND are associated with poorer discrimination across an adjacent digit pair (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). We asked whether the ability to distinguish the order of two stimuli delivered in rapid succession, one each on two adjacent digits, differed in the session directly following the gluing manipulation in comparison with the control sessions."

Data from eight participants met the goodness of fit threshold for all sessions (R<sup>2</sup>\u00a0&gt;\u00a00.4).

No significant change in tactile discrimination was found for D2-D3, the glued digits. In other words, after the gluing manipulation, tactile discrimination was improved across D3-D4 and was diminished across D4-D5, with no change in the glued digits D2-D3. This finding was supported by similar results from a second task, assessing motor confusion, which involved rapidly\u00a0cued button presses using individual digits. There was an increase in the level of confusion between digits 4 and 5 after the gluing manipulation compared with the control conditions (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

Conversely, an intervention involving hand and arm immobilisation drove diminished tactile acuity and a corresponding reduction in BOLD activity in contralateral SI (<a href=\"#bib34\">Lissek et al., 2009</a>). Our results build on this work, demonstrating that usage-dependent changes in the overlap of SI digit representations are associated with a corresponding change in the ability to differentiate tactile inputs to the digits. Specifically, an increase in the cortical overlap between D4\u00a0and\u00a0D5 was accompanied by a reduction in the tactile discrimination ability across these two digits."

These findings reject our hypothesis of increased tactile synchronisation driving an increase in cortical overlap. Instead, these data support the alternative hypothesis that compensatory behaviour in other digits during the 24 hr manipulation drives off-target effects."

Rather than learning to coordinate and co-use the glued digits, participants may have adapted synergies with the non-manipulated digits. In this case, the increased physical separation of D3 and D4 during the gluing reduces the usually high degree of anatomical enslavement seen peripherally between these two digits (<a href=\"#bib29\">Kim et al., 2008</a>), freeing D4 to function even more synergistically with D5. This argument is supported by the observed pattern of increased motor confusion between digits 4 and 5 after the gluing manipulation (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), demonstrating potential changes in movement synergies, that may explain the somatosensory changes observed. This finding complements recent observations that patterns of synergistic digit usage are strongly reflected in the generalisation of tactile learning from trained to adjacent untrained digits (<a href=\"#bib10\">Dempsey-Jones et al., 2016</a>)."

Similar studies undertaken over a period of months in non-human primates have reported the emergence of overlapping receptive fields in response to the fusion of two adjacent digits (<a href=\"#bib7\">Clark et al., 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Allard et al., 1991</a>). The spatial resolution of BOLD fMRI is, of course, poorer than invasive mapping techniques. Nonetheless, it is possible that the observed changes in cortical activation could result from shifts in population receptive fields at the boundary of cortical digit representations (<a href=\"#bib5\">Besle et al., 2014</a>), or even changes in multidigit receptive fields (<a href=\"#bib52\">Thakur et al., 2012</a>). As well as reorganisation in the cortex, strong evidence also suggests considerable plastic potential in subcortical structures, which is mirrored in the cortex (<a href=\"#bib25\">Jones, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Rausell et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Kambi et al., 2014</a>).

In vivo studies in rodent barrel cortex demonstrate that a 24 hr period of altered sensory input can induce increases in synaptic density in the corresponding cortical representation (<a href=\"#bib30\">Knott et al., 2002</a>). This could unmask or potentiate pre-existing divergent or silenced connections between adjacent digit representations (<a href=\"#bib9\">DeFelipe et al., 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Recanzone et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Huntley, 1997</a>). The question remains: how could this cortical shift occur with no associated change in the surface area or location of peak activation of the digit 4 representation? Patterns of local horizontal connectivity in the cortex are established during development and moulded throughout life (<a href=\"#bib50\">Sur and Rubenstein, 2005</a>). Homeostatic mechanisms also exist to maintain balance in cortical activity (<a href=\"#bib53\">Turrigiano and Nelson, 2000</a>), and to preserve the scaling and pattern of cortical topography (<a href=\"#bib46\">Sharma et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Vanderhaeghen et al., 2000</a>). It is plausible that the gluing manipulation results in the potentiation of excitatory horizontal connectivity between the representations of digits 4 and 5, and the concurrent weakening of connectivity between the representations of digits 3 and 4. After 24 hr, we observe the resulting pattern of cortical reorganisation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2</a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"#fig3\">3</a>), wherein the relative positions of the representations have changed, but features of the maps firmly established in development, remain in place. A comparable process of reduced inhibition prior to remapping has been reported in studies of sensory deprivation in rodent barrel cortex. Reduced inputs after whisker clipping produce a local pattern of cortical disinhibition and broadening excitation, followed by subsequent cortical contraction of the representation (<a href=\"#bib1\">Albieri et al., 2015</a>). In this case, changes in the relative inputs across different digits may prompt a transient disinhibitory cortical milieu, and the subsequent re-establishment of modified excitatory networks within the cortex, wherein the cortical representations have shifted to reflect new usage patterns. The unmasking of latent excitatory connections prior to any homeostatic increase in lateral inhibition to rebalance cortical excitability could explain the observation of more marked changes in tactile perception and representational surface area after very short and intense tactile training interventions, or rTMS protocols (<a href=\"#bib41\">Pleger et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Tegenthoff et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Ragert et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Dinse and Tegenthoff, 2015</a>)."

The resulting parameter estimates and residuals were used for subsequent calculation of representational dissimilarity matrices (RDMs) using the MRC CBSU toolbox (<a href=\"http://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/methods-and-resources/toolboxes/\">http://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/methods-and-resources/toolboxes/</a>) (<a href=\"#bib38\">Nili et al., 2014</a>). Parameter estimates were subjected to univariate noise normalisation by voxelwise covariance estimates. A region of interest was defined for each participant using the phase-encoding data, averaging across sessions, to yield a region of activation (FDR \u03b1\u00a0=\u00a00.01) in the anatomical hand knob. The noise-normalised parameter estimates underlying the ROI were then used to construct representational dissimilarity matrices using Euclidean distance for each session. The distance metrics for adjacent digit pairings were subjected to a two-way repeated measures ANOVA, with one factor: session (Control 1, Control 2, Glued) and a second factor: digit pair (D2/D3, D3/D4, D4/D5). For visualisation purposes, the individual RDMs for each session were subjected to classical multidimensional scaling (MDS). Within each session, the results of the MDS for each participant were aligned using Procrustes analysis. The standard errors were corrected for the reduction in variability induced by the alignment, as described previously (<a href=\"#bib13\">Ejaz et al., 2015</a>)."

Participants sat in a testing room in a static chair placed a fixed distance from a table, with their arms resting on the table uncrossed. Their right hand was positioned in the midline, resting on a two-button response device (manufactured in-house). On each of the two buttons of the response device was mounted a vibrotactile stimulator delivering a fixed amplitude suprathreshold pulse (Two Oticon-A, 100 \u03a9 bone conduction vibrators; 20 ms, 200 Hz sinusoidal; amplitude at least 10 times threshold), such that the ventral pads of adjacent digit pairs could be directly opposed to the flat surface of the stimulator. The relative position of the stimulators could be adjusted to accommodate different hand sizes and the relative lengths of different digit pairs. The view of the right hand and forearm was fully occluded and pink noise was used to mask any subtle auditory cues from the vibrotactile stimuli. Time of day was matched across conditions."

Participants performed three runs of this task, one for each digit pairing (D2-D3, D3-D4 and D4-D5; order counterbalanced across conditions and participants). Each run of the task was composed of 192 trials. During each trial, participants received one stimulus to each of the two digits and were asked to judge whether the left or right stimulus came first by pressing with the corresponding digit. Participants were cued on the screen with \u2018Ready\u2019 to alert of an oncoming stimulus, \u2018Response\u2019 to cue a choice and \u2018No response\u2019 in cases of failure to press respond within 2 s of the stimuli. Participants were instructed to fixate on a central fixation cross present on the screen at all times; monitoring was in place to ensure participants\u2019 eyes remained open at all times. The inter stimulus intervals (ISIs) were\u00a0+400,\u2013400,+250,\u2013250,+180,\u2013180,+120,\u2013120,+70,\u201370,+30 or 30 ms where, by convention, a positive ISI denotes that the right digit was stimulated first. For each digit pair, the 12 ISIs were presented 16 times in a randomly assigned order."

The fit of the remaining data far exceeded this threshold (Range: 0.68\u20130.99). In TOJ tasks, the just noticeable difference (JND) is defined as half of the difference between two ISIs that yield the \u2018right-most digit first\u2019 judgment in 75% and 25% of the trials. Smaller values of JND are therefore associated with better performance in terms of temporal tactile resolution."

This task involved rapid, visually\u00a0cued movements of individual digits, in the form of presses on a four-button button box (in-house design). The task was delivered in the same testing environment as the TOJ task. Movements were cued every 700 ms, in blocks of 210 button presses, separated by a 20-s rest period, with a total of four blocks acquired in each session. The order of button presses was pseudorandomised, and the same button press was not repeated twice consecutively; the overall sequence in each block included an equal number of all possible adjacent digit pairings, including both neighbouring digits (e.g. D2 D3) and non-neighbouring digits (e.g. D3 D5). Participants were instructed to respond as quickly and accurately as possible to each cue and to not correct any perceived errors through double presses."

Your design figure suggests that you may have planned things this way for decided there were concerns with the first session (familiarity with scanner environment?) and thus developed a different set of pairings. As such, one contrast is separated by 24 hours and the other by 4 weeks. We recognize that, by counterbalancing things, this is not a confound. Indeed, one could say it is even more impressive that there is little change between Control 1 and 2 given that the time between scans is much greater for this contrast (for half the participants) compared to between (one of the) control scans and Gluing scan. However, we do think it important to report if there is an effect of delay. That is, do you get more stability when the control scans are separated by 24 hours vs. 4 weeks (and similarly, more difference with Gluing when there is 4 weeks vs. 24 hours). The n will be quite small (4 vs. 5) in an analysis of order but we think the order issue should be addressed.

[\u2026]While BOLD fMRI is unable to map at a comparable spatial resolution to such studies, it is conceivable that the observed changes in cortical activation could be underpinned by shifts in population receptive fields at the boundary of cortical digit representations (Besle et al., 2013), or even changes in multidigit receptive fields (Thakur, Fitzgerald and Hsiao, 2012).\u201d"

Given the potential role for adaptive or compensatory behaviour as a driving force for the observed cortical remapping, bottom-up signals are likely to play a significant role in any receptive field changes that underpin remapping. [\u2026] The recent observation of somatotopic information in the negative BOLD signal in primary motor cortex also raises questions regarding the mechanisms maintaining cortical topographic organisation, and whether such signals show the same propensity for plastic change as seen in this study (Noa Zeharia, 2012), though the negative BOLD signal was not considered independently in this study.\u201d"
