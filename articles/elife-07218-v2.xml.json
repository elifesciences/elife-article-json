Chronic malaria exposure is associated with a large increase in atypical memory B cells (MBCs) that resemble B cells expanded in a variety of persistent viral infections. Understanding the function of atypical MBCs and their relationship to classical MBCs will be critical to developing effective vaccines for malaria and other chronic infections. We show that VH gene repertoires and somatic hypermutation rates of atypical and classical MBCs are indistinguishable indicating a common developmental history. Atypical MBCs express an array of inhibitory receptors and B cell receptor (BCR) signaling is stunted in atypical MBCs resulting in impaired B cell responses including proliferation, cytokine production and antibody secretion. Thus, in response to chronic malaria exposure, atypical MBCs appear to differentiate from classical MBCs becoming refractory to BCR-mediated activation and potentially interfering with the acquisition of malaria immunity."

Chronic malaria exposure is associated with a large increase in atypical memory B cells (MBCs) that resemble B cells expanded in a variety of persistent viral infections. Understanding the function of atypical MBCs and their relationship to classical MBCs will be critical to developing effective vaccines for malaria and other chronic infections. We show that VH gene repertoires and somatic hypermutation rates of atypical and classical MBCs are indistinguishable indicating a common developmental history. Atypical MBCs express an array of inhibitory receptors and B cell receptor (BCR) signaling is stunted in atypical MBCs resulting in impaired B cell responses including proliferation, cytokine production and antibody secretion. Thus, in response to chronic malaria exposure, atypical MBCs appear to differentiate from classical MBCs becoming refractory to BCR-mediated activation and potentially interfering with the acquisition of malaria immunity."

Individuals living in malaria endemic areas acquire protective Abs but the process is remarkably slow requiring many years of repeated <i>P. falciparum</i> infections (<a href=\"#bib33\">Portugal et al., 2013</a>). The inefficient acquisition of humoral immunity that protects from malaria has been attributed, in part, to the extensive genetic diversity of <i>P. falciparum</i> parasites (<a href=\"#bib41\">Takala and Plowe, 2009</a>) and the extraordinary clonal variation in the proteins the parasite expresses on the surface of the erythrocytes that it infects (<a href=\"#bib36\">Scherf et al., 2008</a>). However, accumulating evidence suggests that <i>P. falciparum</i> may also evade humoral immunity through dysregulation of B cell responses (<a href=\"#bib33\">Portugal et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Scholzen and Sauerwein, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Hviid et al., 2015</a>).

(2013)</a> recently showed that V<sub>H</sub> and V<sub>L</sub> genes cloned from atypical MBCs from malaria exposed adults encoded broadly neutralizing <i>P. falciparum</i>-specific Abs. This observation led these authors to speculate that atypical MBCs contribute to malaria immunity by secreting Abs against blood-stage <i>P. falciparum</i> parasites, although Ab secretion by atypical MBCs was not directly demonstrated. Concerning the relationship between atypical and classical MBCs, two recent analyses of the V<sub>H</sub> and V<sub>L</sub> sequences of atypical and classical MBC led to different conclusions. A study in Gabon reported that classical and atypical MBCs were different in their expressed IgG V gene repertoires suggesting that they developed from different precursors (<a href=\"#bib28\">Muellenbeck et al., 2013</a>). In contrast, results from a more recent study in Mali indicated that the expressed IgG V gene repertoires of atypical and classical MBCs were remarkably similar suggesting a close relationship between the two populations (<a href=\"#bib58\">Zinocker et al., 2015</a>). However, a relatively small number of V genes were analyzed in these two studies leaving the question of the relatedness of atypical and classical MBCs an open one."

Using next-generation sequence analysis of V<sub>H</sub> genes, we provide evidence that atypical MBCs share a common precursor with classical MBCs, on the basis of similar somatic hypermutation (SHM) rates and V<sub>H</sub> gene usage. By genome-wide expression profiling, we demonstrate that atypical MBCs upregulate multiple inhibitory receptors, particularly the Fc receptor-like-5 (FcRL5). Moreover, atypical MBCs exhibit reduced B cell receptor (BCR)-mediated signaling resulting in markedly impaired BCR-triggered Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization, proliferation and cytokine production. We show that atypical MBCs do not actively secrete Abs or differentiate into Ab-secreting cells (ASCs) in vitro. Thus, while atypical and classical MBCs appear closely related, atypical MBCs exhibit markedly reduced signaling and effector function, which may contribute to the inefficient acquisition of humoral immunity to malaria, findings that point toward the possibility of modulating B cell responses to enhance malaria vaccine efficacy in endemic areas."

To gain insight into the developmental history of atypical MBCs and their relationship to na\u00efve B cells and classical MBCs, we first compared their Ig isotype distributions by flow cytometry. As expected, na\u00efve B cells were largely IgM<sup>+</sup> while classical and atypical MBCs shared an Ig isotype profile that was predominantly IgG<sup>+</sup> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). To determine the in vivo replication histories of the three B cell subpopulations, B cells were purified from peripheral blood mononuclear cells by removing all non-B cells and plasma cells/plasmablast yielding B cells of &gt;98% purity. B cells were then FACS-sorted to obtain na\u00efve B cells, classical and atypical MBCs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) and the replication histories were determined using a qRT-PCR-based assay that measures \u03ba-deletion recombination excision circles (KRECs) (<a href=\"#bib46\">van Zelm et al., 2007</a>). KRECs are produced in B cells during Ig gene rearrangements in the bone marrow. When B cells exit the bone marrow, each subsequent cell division dilutes the number of KRECs by a factor of two, allowing the number of in vivo cell divisions to be estimated. We found the average number of cell divisions to be similar between atypical and classical MBCs (atypical mean 5.4 \u00b1 0.9; classical mean 6.5 \u00b1 0.9; p = 0.24), whereas the number of cell divisions was predictably low in na\u00efve B cells (mean 0.3 \u00b1 0.7) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>)."

After raw reads are joined, the sequences are run through a strict quality filter that removes any sequences less that 200 bp and/or containing more than 0, 10, and 15bp below Q10, Q20, and Q30 quality thresholds, respectively. The isotype of each sequence is determined based on the identified constant region primer and then 100,000 sequences is randomly selected to be aligned to VH germline genes using IMGT/HighV-Quest. Results of the alignment are filtered for unknown or unproductive sequences and then custom software clusters sequences into clones based on identical VH, JH, HCDR3 length, and 85% HCDR3 similarity.

Notably, we observed a high degree of clonal connectivity between atypical and classical MBCs, indicating that a significant proportion of atypical and classical MBCs share a common precursor. By KREC analysis we also observed that atypical and classical MBCs appear to have undergone a similar number of cell divisions.

This analysis revealed the differential expression of several inhibitory receptors including ones that we previously determined were upregulated in atypical MBCs by cell surface phenotyping (<a href=\"#bib47\">Weiss et al., 2009</a>). Two DEGs of particular interest are FCRL5 and FCRL3. By cell surface phenotyping we originally reported that atypical MBCs expressed FcRL4 (<a href=\"#bib47\">Weiss et al., 2009</a>). The FcRL4 expression was low and because of the absence of FCRL4 transcripts in atypical MBCs reported here we now conclude that the staining of B cells with FcRL4-specific mAb was likely due to cross reactivity of the mAb with FcRL5 or FcRL3. The best-characterized B cell populations that resemble atypical MBCs, namely tissue\u2013like MBCs described in the mucosal lymphoid tissues of healthy individuals (<a href=\"#bib12\">Ehrhardt et al., 2005</a>) and exhausted MBCs described in HIV-infected individuals (<a href=\"#bib27\">Moir et al., 2008</a>), express FcRL4 at both the protein and transcript levels.

In mice, FcRL5 expression is associated with innate-like B cell lineages (<a href=\"#bib25\">Li et al., 2014</a>) and recent studies suggest that FcRL5, which contains both an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif (ITIM) and immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) within its cytoplasmic domain, may exert a binary, compartment-specific influence on B cell responses (<a href=\"#bib57\">Zhu et al., 2013</a>). In humans, FcRL5 expression has been linked to both inhibition and enhancement of B cell responses. FcRL5, through its recruitment of the phosphatases SHP1 and SHP2, inhibits BCR-dependent activation of human B cells (<a href=\"#bib16\">Haga et al., 2007</a>). In human na\u00efve B cells, BCR crosslinking was shown to induce the expression of FcRL5 and crosslinking FcRL5 together with TLR9 activation enhanced B cell proliferation (<a href=\"#bib9\">Dement-Brown et al., 2012</a>). FcRL5 has been recently shown to bind to Fc of Ig (<a href=\"#bib54\">Wilson et al., 2012</a>) and would be predicted to respond to environmental changes in the levels of immune complexes. Intriguingly, FcRL5 has also been shown to bind to an orthopoxvirus MHC-class I-like molecule secreted by infected cells suggesting a role of FcRL5-expressing cells in defense against poxvirus infection (<a href=\"#bib3\">Campbell et al., 2010</a>). It will be interesting to explore whether FcRL5 binds to any <i>Plasmodium</i>-encoded products. The human FcRL3 also contains both ITIMs and ITAMs in its cytoplasmic domain and appears to be most highly related to FcRL5 in mice (<a href=\"#bib25\">Li et al., 2014</a>). Recent studies of human peripheral blood B cells provided evidence that FcRL3 expression increases as a function of differentiation and is highest among MBC subsets with innate-like features (<a href=\"#bib24\">Li et al., 2013</a>). FcRL3 ligation augmented TLR9 mediated B cell proliferation but blocked plasma cell differentiation and Ab production. Thus, it is possible that both FcRL5 and FcRL3 serve to orchestrate adaptive and innate responses in atypical MBCs."

Attenuated BCR signaling was suggested by the microarray data that showed differential expression of key components of the BCR signaling pathway. A direct test of the ability of atypical MBCs to respond to BCR crosslinking showed that signaling was blocked at an early signaling event, the phosphorylation of the kinase Syk. It is reasonable to assume that this block is mediated by the several inhibitory receptors upregulated by atypical MBCs, including FcRL5, through their ability to recruit the phosphatases SHP1/SHP2 (<a href=\"#bib25\">Li et al., 2014</a>). The inability of atypical MBCs to respond to antigen stimulation raises the question: to what, if anything, are atypical MBCs B cells sensitive? We recently demonstrated that the expression of FcRL4 similarly blocked BCR signaling but simultaneously enhanced responses to TLR9 ligands and we suggested that FcRL4 expression switched adaptive B cells to innate-like B cells (<a href=\"#bib40\">Sohn et al., 2011</a>).

Because unambiguous targets of protective Abs have yet to be identified in malaria, another approach involves cloning and expressing antibodies from bulk-sorted atypical and classical MBCs to compare their specificity profiles in an unbiased manner using protein microarrays that represent the entire <i>P. falciparum</i> proteome of over 5400 gene products."

After paired-end reads were joined, sequences were filtered based on a length and quality threshold. Sequences less than 200 bp and sequences with poor overlaps (&gt;8% difference in linked region) and/or high number of bp below a threshold score (sequences containing more than 15 bp with less than Q30, 10bp with less than Q20, or any bp with less than Q10 scores) were excluded from further analysis. Isotypes were then determined by analysis of the constant region segment of each sequence and a random subset of 100,000 sequences were aligned and analyzed for clonality and for mutations in the V region using the data provided by IMGT/HighV-quest (<a href=\"http://www.imgt.org/HighV-QUEST/\">http://www.imgt.org/HighV-QUEST/</a>). The subset of sequences was used to relieve computational stress and allow for analysis in reasonable timing. Samples tested at multiple sized subsets did not result in any substantial difference in the clonality or our interpretation of results. After alignment, the sequences were analyzed by a custom program written in perl and matlab. Sequences were filtered by removing \u2018unproductive\u2019 and \u2018unknown\u2019 sequences, and clusters of sequences were identified based on identical V and J region rearrangement, identical HCDR3 length, and 85% similarity within the HCDR3.

The study is both timely and important in enhancing our understanding of the origins and function of aMBCs. Specifically, the differential expression of FcRL5 and FcRL3 is interesting and suggests that atypical memory B cells acquire different phenotypes dependent on the specific type of chronic infection. It will be interesting to understand the differences in the phenotype and function of atypical memory B cells induced as a result of different chronic infections in the future. In summary, the manuscript provides a detailed comparison of atypical and classical memory B cells isolated from individuals living in a high transmission area. The data are likely to lead to further investigation into the function of these cells both during and after chronic exposure to <i>P. falciparum</i> as well as other chronic infections. Although much has been reported previously by this and other groups, both in malaria and chronic viral infection, overall this is an interesting study and well conducted, analysed and presented."

In general, this approach has proved challenging for the field given the low frequency of any given antigen-specific MBC population in peripheral blood. In a second ongoing effort we are cloning and expressing antibodies from bulk-sorted atypical MBCs and classical MBCs to compare their specificity profiles using protein microarrays representing the entire <i>P. falciparum</i> proteome of over 5,400 gene products.

Additionally, in the study described in our manuscript we found that malaria-associated CD21<sup>\u2013</sup>CD27<sup>\u2013</sup>-atypical MBCs express FcRL3 and FcRL5 but not FcRL4, in contrast to HIV-associated CD21<sup>\u2013</sup>CD27<sup>\u2013</sup> exhausted MBCs that express FcRL4.
