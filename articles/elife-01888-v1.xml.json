                    "text": "Atopic dermatitis can result from loss of structural proteins in the outermost epidermal layers, leading to a defective epidermal barrier. To test whether this influences tumour formation, we chemically induced tumours in EPI\u2212/\u2212 mice, which lack three barrier proteins\u2014Envoplakin, Periplakin, and Involucrin. EPI\u2212/\u2212 mice were highly resistant to developing benign tumours when treated with 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA) and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). The DMBA response was normal, but EPI\u2212/\u2212 skin exhibited an exaggerated atopic response to TPA, characterised by abnormal epidermal differentiation, a complex immune infiltrate and elevated serum thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP). The exacerbated TPA response could be normalised by blocking TSLP or the immunoreceptor NKG2D but not CD4+ T cells. We conclude that atopy is protective against skin cancer in our experimental model and that the mechanism involves keratinocytes communicating with cells of the immune system via signalling elements that normally protect against environmental assaults."

To test whether this influences tumour formation, we chemically induced tumours in EPI\u2212/\u2212 mice, which lack three barrier proteins\u2014Envoplakin, Periplakin, and Involucrin. EPI\u2212/\u2212 mice were highly resistant to developing benign tumours when treated with 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA) and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). The DMBA response was normal, but EPI\u2212/\u2212 skin exhibited an exaggerated atopic response to TPA, characterised by abnormal epidermal differentiation, a complex immune infiltrate and elevated serum thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP). The exacerbated TPA response could be normalised by blocking TSLP or the immunoreceptor NKG2D but not CD4+ T cells. We conclude that atopy is protective against skin cancer in our experimental model and that the mechanism involves keratinocytes communicating with cells of the immune system via signalling elements that normally protect against environmental assaults."

Knockout mice and wild-type mice were treated with two chemicals: DMBA, which causes mutations in a gene called <i>HRas</i>, and TPA, which promotes the formation of tumours from cells that contain <i>HRas</i> mutations. After about 16 weeks almost all of the wild-type mice had at least one benign tumour, whereas half of the knockout mice had no tumours. Overall, the average number of benign tumours per mouse was six times higher in the wild-type mice. This shows that the mutations that cause the epidermal barrier defects in knockout mice also protect them against the tumours caused by the combined effects of DMBA and TPA."

The knockout mice and the wild-type mice responded to DMBA in the same way; however, the knockout mice showed an exaggerated response to TPA, including a strong inflammatory reaction. This response comprised the production of higher levels of various proteins that are involved in communications between skin cells and the immune system. Cipolat et al. propose that the immune reaction caused by this exaggerated response could help to prevent tumour formation by eliminating tumour-forming cells in the skin."

Therefore, we sought to examine the link between AD and cancer susceptibility using a mouse model of AD in which the primary defect is in the epidermal barrier that is normally protective against pathogens. The skin barrier is formed by terminally differentiated keratinocytes in the outermost layers of the epidermis, known as the cornified layers or stratum corneum. In cornified keratinocytes, the plasma membrane is replaced with a layer of highly insoluble, transglutaminase cross-linked proteins with covalently attached lipids, known as the cornified envelope (<a href=\"#bib9\">Candi et al., 2005</a>). Involucrin, envoplakin, and periplakin are the first proteins to be cross-linked by transglutaminase-1 and create the protein scaffold for the attachment of lipids on which the cornified envelope assembles (<a href=\"#bib44\">Rice and Green, 1977</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Simon and Green, 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Ruhrberg et al., 1996</a>, <a href=\"#bib45\">1997</a>)."

In contrast, the individual and double knockouts for <i>envoplakin</i>, <i>periplakin,</i> and <i>involucrin</i> do not have observable barrier defects or an altered immune infiltrate (<a href=\"#bib49\">Sevilla et al., 2007</a>).

A single exposure to the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA) induces oncogenic mutations in HRas (initiation). Repeated applications of the promoting agent 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) (promotion) allow initiated, mutagenized cells to clonally expand and form benign tumours called papillomas, some of which progress to malignant squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abel et al., 2009</a>). While most human skin SCCs are associated with UV, rather than chemical, carcinogenesis, 10% do have Ras gene mutations (<a href=\"#bib33\">Lopez-Pajares et al., 2013</a>), and DMBA/TPA carcinogenesis has contributed substantially to our understanding of the steps of tumour development in human skin (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hirst and Balmain, 2004</a>)."

In EPI\u2212/\u2212 epidermis treated with acetone, transcripts related to innate immunity (in particular RAGE, S100A8, S100A9 and IL-1\u03b2) were higher than in WT, and these differences were maintained when transcript levels were upregulated by TPA treatment (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>).

There was a striking upregulation of type 2 cytokines, including IL-4, IL-6, IL-13, IL-33 and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), in epidermis and dermis of EPI\u2212/\u2212 TPA-treated mice; this was not observed to a similar extent in WT skin. Type 17 transcripts were upregulated by TPA in epidermis of both genotypes, but were higher in EPI\u2212/\u2212 epidermis (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Increased transcript levels of a number of chemokines, in particular Cxcl-5 and GM-CSF, were found in TPA treated EPI\u2212/\u2212 vs WT skin, in agreement with the increased dermal infiltration of neutrophils and eosinophils. We conclude that the immune response to TPA in EPI\u2212/\u2212 skin correlated with expression of pro-inflammatory genes with a type 2/type 17 profile."

These changes in differentiation have previously been shown to be tumour-suppressive in oncogene-driven skin carcinogenesis (<a href=\"#bib19\">Guinea-Viniegra et al., 2012</a>), consistent with our observation that EPI\u2212/\u2212 mice are resistant to developing papillomas. Upon TPA treatment EPI\u2212/\u2212 defective keratinocytes released high levels of chemokines and type 2-type 17 cytokines, including TSLP.

Key players in the crosstalk between keratinocytes and leukocytes are DETCs, since they orchestrate the inflammatory response to pathogen-derived and environmental signals (<a href=\"#bib29\">King et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Moore et al., 2000</a>). DETCs are already in an activated state in untreated EPI\u2212/\u2212 epidermis, as demonstrated by their round shape and reduced number (<a href=\"#bib49\">Sevilla et al., 2007</a>). This is most likely a consequence of increased expression of keratinocyte stress signals (Rae-1 and H60), which would be responsible for establishing the observed Th2 immune-surveillance response. We propose that this pre-activated, \u2018alarmed\u2019 condition enables EPI\u2212/\u2212 skin to react more promptly and strongly to TPA treatment than WT skin. In contrast to EPI\u2212/\u2212 mice, in mice that overexpress activin \u03b2A in the epidermis downregulation of DETCs only occurs after DMBA/TPA treatment and is linked to increased skin carcinogenesis (<a href=\"#bib5\">Antsiferova et al., 2011</a>). The exaggerated TPA response in EPI\u2212/\u2212 mice resulted in increased numbers of CD4+ T cells, neutrophils, mast cells, and eosinophils, and many of these leukocyte populations have been shown to be able to exert tumour protective effects, which could potentially bypass the function of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells."
