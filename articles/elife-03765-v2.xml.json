Here, we use genetically encoded fluorescent biosensors to directly probe the role of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations in modulating calcineurin activity dynamics in insulin-secreting MIN6 \u03b2-cells. We show that Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations induce distinct temporal patterns of calcineurin activity in the cytosol and plasma membrane vs at the ER and mitochondria in these cells. Furthermore, we found that these differential calcineurin activity patterns are determined by variations in the subcellular distribution of calmodulin (CaM), indicating that CaM plays an active role in shaping both the spatial and temporal aspects of calcineurin signaling. Together, our findings provide new insights into the mechanisms by which oscillatory signals are decoded to generate specific functional outputs within different cellular compartments."

Here, we use genetically encoded fluorescent biosensors to directly probe the role of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations in modulating calcineurin activity dynamics in insulin-secreting MIN6 \u03b2-cells. We show that Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations induce distinct temporal patterns of calcineurin activity in the cytosol and plasma membrane vs at the ER and mitochondria in these cells. Furthermore, we found that these differential calcineurin activity patterns are determined by variations in the subcellular distribution of calmodulin (CaM), indicating that CaM plays an active role in shaping both the spatial and temporal aspects of calcineurin signaling. Together, our findings provide new insights into the mechanisms by which oscillatory signals are decoded to generate specific functional outputs within different cellular compartments."

As a result, calcineurin activity in the vicinity of organelles is vulnerable to being canceled out by the actions of other enzymes. When more calmodulin is available, this canceling out does not occur, which is how wave-like input can lead to step-like output."

In general, oscillatory signals are thought to function as a critical biological regulator by allowing a single message to encode multiple types of information through variations in the frequency, amplitude, and spatial characteristics of the signal (<a href=\"#bib19\">Cheong and Levchenko, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Ganesan and Zhang, 2012</a>), thereby promoting specificity in the regulation of downstream targets. Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations in particular are known to regulate numerous processes including gene expression (<a href=\"#bib64\">Negulescu et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Lewis, 2003</a>), exocytosis (<a href=\"#bib97\">Tse et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Pasti et al., 2001</a>), and excitation-contraction coupling (<a href=\"#bib99\">Viatchenko-Karpinski et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Maltsev and Lakatta, 2007</a>), and Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations have been shown to significantly enhance the specificity and efficiency of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-regulated processes (<a href=\"#bib27\">Dolmetsch et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Li et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Kupzig et al., 2005</a>). Cells are primarily dependent on a single effector protein, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor calmodulin (CaM), to transduce Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals. CaM sits at the epicenter of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, modulating the activity of a vast array of target proteins throughout the cell (<a href=\"#bib73\">Persechini and Stemmer, 2002</a>). CaM is also thought to play a prominent role in the decoding of Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations, largely via the differential activation of target proteins such as the Ca<sup>2+</sup>- and CaM-dependent phosphatase calcineurin (<a href=\"#bib82\">Saucerman and Bers, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib87\">Song et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Parekh, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib85\">Slavov et al., 2013</a>)."

However, the precise spatiotemporal regulation of calcineurin signaling remains poorly understood. Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations have previously been shown to enhance calcineurin-mediated transcriptional regulation (<a href=\"#bib27\">Dolmetsch et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Li et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib95\">Tomida et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib105\">Wu et al., 2012</a>), and studies have also shown that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillatory frequency is a critical determinant of calcineurin-dependent hypertrophic signaling in cardiomyocytes (<a href=\"#bib20\">Colella et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Saucerman and Bers, 2008</a>) and long-term depression in neurons (<a href=\"#bib60\">Mehta and Zhang, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Li et al., 2012b</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Fujii et al., 2013</a>). Nevertheless, the precise relationship between Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations and calcineurin signaling has yet to be elucidated. Similarly, calcineurin dephosphorylates multiple target proteins located throughout the cell (<a href=\"#bib15\">Cameron et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib100\">Wang et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bandyopadhyay et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Cereghetti et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib90\">Tandan et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Bollo et al., 2010</a>), and although spatial compartmentalization is suspected to play an important role in regulating calcineurin signaling (<a href=\"#bib37\">Heineke and Ritter, 2012</a>), this phenomenon has yet to be directly examined."

Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations are responsible for driving the pulsatile secretion of insulin (<a href=\"#bib40\">Hellman et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib91\">Tengholm and Gylfe, 2008</a>), and the chronic inhibition of calcineurin, which is a common form of immunosuppressive therapy, is often accompanied by the onset of diabetes (<a href=\"#bib38\">Heisel et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Chakkera and Mandarino, 2013</a>). In the present study, we use a variety of genetically encoded fluorescent reporters to directly investigate the spatiotemporal dynamics of calcineurin signaling in response to cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations in MIN6 \u03b2-cells. We were able to observe distinct subcellular patterns of calcineurin activity in the cytosol and plasma membrane, where calcineurin appeared to integrate the oscillatory input, vs at the ER and mitochondrial surfaces, where calcineurin activity was observed to oscillate. Furthermore, an exploration of the molecular determinants involved in regulating calcineurin activity revealed that significant differences in the subcellular distribution of free Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM are responsible for generating these discrete activity patterns. Our findings provide the first evidence that oscillatory signals are capable of differentially regulating calcineurin activity and suggest a more active role for CaM in transducing oscillatory Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals."

We then targeted this reporter, called CaNAR2, to the cytosol (cytoCaNAR2), plasma membrane (pmCaNAR2), mitochondrial outer membrane (mitoCaNAR2), and ER surface (erCaNAR2) via in-frame fusion with a C-terminal nuclear export signal (NES) (<a href=\"#bib98\">Ullman et al., 1997</a>), an N-terminal motif derived from Lyn kinase (Lyn) (<a href=\"#bib33\">Gao and Zhang, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Depry et al., 2011</a>), an N-terminal motif derived from DAKAP1a (DAKAP) (<a href=\"#bib26\">DiPilato et al., 2004</a>), and an N-terminal motif derived from cytochrome P450 (CYP450) (<a href=\"#bib88\">Szczesna-Skorupa et al., 1998</a>), respectively (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A\u2013E</a>).

We have seen previously that the FRET signal from CaNAR, which is based on calcineurin-dependent dephosphorylation of the N-terminal domain of nuclear-factor of activated T-cells (NFAT), is not easily reversed and can remain elevated even after cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> has returned to basal levels (<a href=\"#bib65\">Newman and Zhang, 2008</a>). Indeed, these observations appear to confirm previous reports suggesting that calcineurin and NFAT behave as signal integrators to form a working memory of oscillatory Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals, owing to the rapid dephosphorylation and slow rephosphorylation kinetics of NFAT family members (<a href=\"#bib95\">Tomida et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Colella et al., 2008</a>). To our surprise, however, mitochondrial and ER-targeted CaNAR2 both exhibited far more reversible responses to cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H,I</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1D,E</a>). This difference was particularly striking for erCaNAR2, which exhibited almost perfect calcineurin activity oscillations upon TEA stimulation. Furthermore, these response patterns were independent of the CaNAR expression level (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), indicating that they reflect genuine differences in endogenous calcineurin signaling."

We therefore investigated the molecular mechanisms responsible for defining these differential signaling zones. In particular, we focused on the reversibility of the CaNAR response at the ER surface, which suggested that calcineurin activity within this region of the cell is being precisely balanced by the action of endogenous kinases. A number of kinases have been shown to re-phosphorylate NFAT (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib21\">Crabtree and Olson, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Hogan et al., 2003</a>) and are thus potentially capable of reversing the response from CaNAR. Notably, PKA phosphorylates multiple residues in NFAT (<a href=\"#bib8\">Beals et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib84\">Sheridan et al., 2002</a>), and PKA has repeatedly been shown to antagonize calcineurin signaling in the regulation of a variety of cellular processes such as exocytosis (<a href=\"#bib50\">Lester et al., 2001</a>), excitation-contraction coupling (<a href=\"#bib81\">Santana et al., 2002</a>), and mitochondrial division (<a href=\"#bib22\">Cribbs and Strack, 2007</a>). We therefore tested whether PKA activity is involved in reversing the ER-localized CaNAR response. In addition, we also tested the role of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>- and diacylglycerol-stimulated protein kinase (PKC), which may also phosphorylate NFAT (<a href=\"#bib80\">San-Antonio et al., 2002</a>)."

Curiously, the increased response from erCaNAR2 coincided with the attenuation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations and the return of Ca<sup>2+</sup> to basal levels. Despite the apparent lack of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, the observed increase in the erCaNAR2 response was nonetheless specifically caused by calcineurin activity, as the increase could be blocked by addition of the calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporin A prior to H89 treatment (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). Moreover, addition of the PKC inhibitor G\u00f66983 to TEA-stimulated MIN6 cells also resulted in a steadily increasing erCaNAR2 response, accompanied by a transition from Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations to persistently elevated cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,D</a>)."

However, we were able to confirm the generation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes using a higher affinity probe, YC-Nano50 (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Horikawa et al., 2010</a>). In contrast to H89 treatment, the inclusion of G\u00f66983 to inhibit PKC activity did not appear to alter the response of erCaNAR2 to successive KCl treatments (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Here, the addition of the inhibitor resulted in an immediate increase in the erCaNAR2 FRET signal, though this was most likely due to non-specific increases in the background fluorescence due to the addition of G\u00f66983, which is fluorescent. Nevertheless, KCl-induced erCaNAR2 oscillations were still clearly observable above this increased background, as were the RCaMP Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes."

Based on these results, we tested whether differences in the level of PKA activity present in the cytosol and ER might contribute to differential calcineurin response patterns. To do so, we utilized variants of the FRET-based PKA activity reporter AKAR4 (<a href=\"#bib25\">Depry et al., 2011</a>) that were localized to the cytoplasm or ER via fusion to the targeting sequences described above (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). We then compared the relative amounts of PKA activity in these two compartments by normalizing the TEA-stimulated PKA responses (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,D</a>) with respect to the total amount of PKA activity available in the cytosol and ER, which was defined as the maximum subcellular response observed upon combined treatment with the adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin (Fsk) and the general phosphodiesterase inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX). Interestingly, we detected slightly less PKA activity at the ER, with TEA-stimulated AKAR4 responses reaching 55.4 \u00b1 5.9% and 39.8 \u00b1 3.3% (p = 0.0249) of the maximum dynamic range in the cytosol and at the ER, respectively (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). We also found that setting PKA activity to maximum levels using IBMX pretreatment in conjunction with KCl stimulation, thus clamping PKA activity in these regions (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), did not affect the subcellular CaNAR response patterns (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E\u2013H</a>)."

One possible explanation is that the kinetics of calcineurin activation itself may in fact differ in these two subcellular zones. Specifically, we reasoned that calcineurin may remain in an activated state for longer periods in the cytosol than at the ER surface in response to the individual Ca<sup>2+</sup> pulses that occur during Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations, thus potentially rendering cytosolic calcineurin activity less prone to the antagonistic effects of cytosolic PKA activity. To test this hypothesis, we took advantage of the intrinsic conformational changes that are associated with calcineurin activation."

Guided by this information, we constructed a FRET-based reporter for monitoring calcineurin activation by sandwiching the catalytic subunit of calcineurin between Cerulean (i.e., CFP) and Venus (i.e., YFP) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). The resulting Calcineurin Activation Ratiometric indicator, or CaNARi, exhibited a robust increase in the cyan-to-yellow fluorescence emission ratio, which tracked closely with the increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> detected using RCaMP, in response to cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation in HEK293 cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>).

This reporter features a modified version of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM-binding sequence from avian smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase that binds Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM with a <i>K</i><sub><i>d</i></sub> of 2 nM. Calcineurin has been shown to bind Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM with sub-nanomolar affinity (<a href=\"#bib46\">Hubbard and Klee, 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Quintana et al., 2005</a>), therefore we reasoned that BSCaM-2 should offer a fair approximation of how much Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM is locally accessible by calcineurin. Our model predicts that free Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM is less abundant in the vicinity of the ER compared with the bulk cytosol (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>, left), and indeed we observed a significantly lower (p &lt; 0.0001) FRET response when BSCaM-2 was tethered to the ER surface than when it was able to diffuse freely through the cytosol (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>), suggesting that less Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM is present near the ER. These responses are similar to those observed by Teruel and colleagues, who reported smaller increases in free nuclear Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM levels compared with the cytosol in response to Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients (<a href=\"#bib92\">Teruel et al., 2000</a>). Our results also appear to reflect actual differences in subcellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM levels as opposed to Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM buffering, given that biosensor expression levels did not appear to affect the FRET responses (<a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). More importantly, we found that overexpressing mCherry-tagged CaM was able to rescue most of the difference between the ER and cytosolic FRET responses (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>, \u2018ER+CaM\u2019)."

To test this model directly, we reasoned that if calcineurin activity is in fact being affected by local Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM levels, it should then be possible to generate cytosol-like CaNAR responses with erCaNAR2 by overexpressing CaM. Remarkably, combining mCherry-tagged CaM overexpression with the application of repeated, KCl-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in CaNAR-expressing cells reveals that this is indeed the case. In contrast to cells expressing erCaNAR2 alone, which exhibit oscillatory FRET responses in response to repeated KCl stimulation and washout (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C</a>), the co-expression of CaM-mCherry alongside erCaNAR2 clearly results in integrated calcineurin activity responses similar to those seen in the cytosol (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9D</a>). Conversely, reducing the amount of available Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM should lead to ER-like CaNAR oscillations in the cytosol. Indeed, pretreating cells with a low dose (20 \u03bcM) of the CaM antagonist W7 gave rise to oscillatory responses from cytoCaNAR2, in contrast to integrating responses in cells lacking W7 pretreatment (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9E,F</a>). Taken together, our results strongly suggest that free concentrations of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM are limiting near the ER surface and thus significantly modulate the local, Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillation-induced calcineurin activity dynamics in this subcellular region."

Recently, calcineurin responses in cortical neurons treated with the amyloid-\u03b2 peptide were shown to differ subcellularly, with more rapid calcineurin activation occurring in dendritic spines than in the cytosol and nucleus (<a href=\"#bib105\">Wu et al., 2012</a>). Calcineurin dynamics are also predicted to differ significantly within the dyadic cleft and cytosol in cardiomyocytes (<a href=\"#bib82\">Saucerman and Bers, 2008</a>). In keeping with these findings, our investigation revealed subcellular differences in the temporal pattern of calcineurin activity in response to Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations in pancreatic \u03b2-cells. Specifically, cytosolic and plasma membrane calcineurin activity was observed to integrate Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations, whereas Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations evoked intermittent, oscillating calcineurin activity at the ER and mitochondria. Given the wide variety of cellular functions regulated by calcineurin signaling and the significant role of subcellular compartments in modulating signaling molecule behavior (see <a href=\"#bib60\">Mehta and Zhang, 2010</a>), this phenomenon is likely to shape calcineurin activity patterns in other cell types as well."

The CaNAR family, including CaNAR2 and its precursor CaNAR1 (<a href=\"#bib65\">Newman and Zhang, 2008</a>), utilizes the well-characterized dephosphorylation of NFAT to report on the substrate-level dynamics of calcineurin activity and is sensitive to multiple cellular factors, such as both phosphatase and kinase activity. We also generated CaNARi, which reports on the activation of calcineurin upon the binding of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM. The CaNARi response is exclusively determined by the intrinsic affinities between Ca<sup>2+</sup>, CaM, and calcineurin, and CaNARi revealed largely uniform subcellular calcineurin activation patterns during Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations. On the other hand, CaNAR was able to detect clear subcellular variations in calcineurin activity, which stems from the fact that CaNAR monitors the net endogenous calcineurin activity at each location. The enzymatic nature of CaNAR, wherein calcineurin dephosphorylates many probe molecules, also makes it more sensitive for detecting weak calcineurin signals. However, given the somewhat peculiar dephosphorylation and rephosphorylation behavior of NFAT (<a href=\"#bib68\">Okamura et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib95\">Tomida et al., 2003</a>), CaNAR may not reflect calcineurin activity towards all targets. Additional approaches, including redesigned CaNARs, are therefore needed to provide a more complete picture."

For example, mice specifically lacking calcineurin in \u03b2-cells show impaired insulin production and decreased expression of several critical genes, all of which are regulated by the calcineurin-dependent transcription factor NFAT (<a href=\"#bib39\">Heit et al., 2006</a>). The efficient activation and nuclear translocation of NFAT in response to Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations requires periods of sustained calcineurin activity to produce a cytoplasmic pool of dephosphorylated NFAT that is available for nuclear import (<a href=\"#bib95\">Tomida et al., 2003</a>). Correspondingly, the sustained, integrating calcineurin activity patterns we observed in the cytosolic and plasma membrane regions of MIN6 cells indicated that this signaling domain is optimized for the oscillatory control of transcriptional regulation. In fact, the plasma membrane may play a particularly crucial role in promoting calcineurin/NFAT signaling. The scaffolding protein AKAP79/150 has specifically been shown to recruit calcineurin into a signaling complex located at the C-terminus of the L-type voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel (VGCC) in hippocampal neurons (<a href=\"#bib69\">Oliveria et al., 2007</a>), and the presence of anchored calcineurin within this complex was required for proper NFAT-dependent nuclear signaling in these cells (<a href=\"#bib69\">Oliveria et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Li et al., 2012a</a>). Both Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through the L-type VGCC and AKAP anchoring of calcineurin are also important for insulin secretion (<a href=\"#bib12\">Bokvist et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib104\">Wiser et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Barg et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Lester et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Hinke et al., 2012</a>), therefore it is possible that an AKAP-calcineurin-VGCC complex is similarly involved in calcineurin/NFAT signaling in \u03b2-cells."

Our previous findings indicate that oscillatory signals can spatially restrict enzyme activity (<a href=\"#bib67\">Ni et al., 2010</a>); thus, calcineurin activity oscillations may alternatively be directed towards local ER and mitochondrial targets. For instance, calcineurin was recently shown to dephosphorylate the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent chaperone calnexin and interact with the ER kinase PERK to modulate protein folding and ER stress (<a href=\"#bib13\">Bollo et al., 2010</a>), while calcineurin and PERK also jointly regulate insulin secretion (<a href=\"#bib102\">Wang et al., 2013</a>). Similarly, calcineurin dephosphorylates and activates the mitochondrial fission protein Drp1 (<a href=\"#bib22\">Cribbs and Strack, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Cereghetti et al., 2008</a>, <a href=\"#bib16\">2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib86\">Slupe et al., 2013</a>). Interestingly, Drp1-mediated mitochondrial division involves direct contact between the outer mitochondrial membrane and ER tubules (<a href=\"#bib30\">Friedman et al., 2011</a>). It is conceivable that such contact points are hotspots for local calcineurin signaling; the ER and mitochondria are in fact characterized by extensive physical and functional coupling (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib23\">de Brito and Scorrano, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Rowland and Voeltz, 2012</a>)."

Curiously, inhibiting PKA in TEA-stimulated MIN6 cells led to steadily increasing ER calcineurin activity, despite cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> apparently returning to basal levels. This effect was blocked by calcineurin inhibition and may be due to residual activity from ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> release channels or to passive Ca<sup>2+</sup> leak from the ER (<a href=\"#bib14\">Camello et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib89\">Szlufcik et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Hammadi et al., 2013</a>). However, PKA activity was not sufficient to produce calcineurin activity oscillations, as even saturating amounts of PKA activity did not lead to CaNAR oscillations in the cytosol. AKAPs may be involved in locally promoting the PKA-mediated antagonism of calcineurin signaling, and DAKAP1 (AKAP121), which binds calcineurin (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abrenica et al., 2009</a>), in fact targets to both the mitochondrial and ER membranes (<a href=\"#bib55\">Ma and Taylor, 2008</a>). AKAP79 is also known to anchor PKA and calcineurin to the plasma membrane in \u03b2-cells (<a href=\"#bib50\">Lester et al., 2001</a>), yet calcineurin responses nevertheless appear integrative in this region. We also detected less free Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM near the ER surface compared with the cytosol, and CaM overexpression led to integrating rather than oscillating ER calcineurin activity, whereas inhibiting CaM produced the opposite effect in the cytosol. Both of these results are consistent with a model in which limited access to CaM at the ER leads to weak calcineurin activity. Since excess calcineurin activity can lead to \u03b2-cell dysfunction and death (<a href=\"#bib9\">Bernal-Mizrachi et al., 2010</a>), often involving ER stress and apoptosis, this combination of PKA activity and limited access to CaM may help constrain local calcineurin signals within physiologically permissible limits."

CaM acts as both a dedicated regulatory subunit and a promiscuous binding partner depending on the specific target (<a href=\"#bib83\">Saucerman and Bers, 2012</a>), and whereas promiscuous CaM is free to associate with and dissociate from target proteins as a function of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, dedicated CaM remains bound irrespective of changes in the Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration. Subcellular variations in the amounts of dedicated CaM targets may therefore affect the levels of promiscuous CaM that can activate calcineurin in response to Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals. Moreover, the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding kinetics of CaM limit its range of action and potentially require CaM to be activated within Ca<sup>2+</sup> microdomains (<a href=\"#bib83\">Saucerman and Bers, 2012</a>). In \u03b2-cells, Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations are often driven by VGCCs in the plasma membrane (<a href=\"#bib4\">Ashcroft and Rorsman, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Hellman et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Bokvist et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Mears, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib91\">Tengholm and Gylfe, 2008</a>), and CaM has been found to be locally enriched near these channels (<a href=\"#bib62\">Mori, 2004</a>), ready to be activated by local Ca<sup>2+</sup>. AKAP79 has also been shown to bind CaM (<a href=\"#bib34\">Gold et al., 2011</a>), thereby serving as another potential source for local Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM and also perhaps lowering the ability of anchored PKA to antagonize local calcineurin activity. However, additional studies are needed to unravel the precise mechanisms underlying the spatial differences in CaM levels."

In these cells, rapid (i.e., &gt; 1 s<sup>\u22121</sup>) Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients, combined with the slow dissociation of calcineurin and Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM, facilitate persistent calcineurin activation (<a href=\"#bib87\">Song et al., 2008</a>). This also engenders the preferential activation of calcineurin at lower oscillatory frequencies compared with other targets (e.g., CaMKII), resulting in frequency decoding. In \u03b2-cells, on the other hand, Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations are slow (i.e., &lt; 1 min<sup>\u22121</sup>) (<a href=\"#bib40\">Hellman et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib91\">Tengholm and Gylfe, 2008</a>), and our results indicate that Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM fully dissociates from calcineurin in between each Ca<sup>2+</sup> peak, suggesting that frequency modulation may not be a prominent feature in \u03b2-cell calcineurin signaling. Rather, we found that CaM plays a critical role in spatial signaling under these conditions, which has been hinted at previously (<a href=\"#bib92\">Teruel et al., 2000</a>). Furthermore, the frequency decoding observed in neurons and cardiomyocytes is based entirely on the intrinsic kinetics of CaM-target interactions where CaM plays a passive role. Conversely, our analyses highlight a novel mechanism whereby cells utilize CaM to actively encode spatial information, which is then decoded by calcineurin to ensure that oscillatory Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals are transduced properly within specific local contexts."

Oscillation is expected if each wave of calcium-dependent dephosphorylation (by calcineurin) is fully reversed (by PKA) during the ensuing low calcium period, while integration is expected if reversal is incomplete. Differential NFAT phosphorylation kinetics might be explained if PKA were less active in the cytosol than ER. However, the authors found that PKA activity oscillations are of similar magnitude at the ER and cytosol, so this explanation is unlikely. Alternatively, less calcineurin may be activated near the ER, so it may be more readily antagonized by PKA. Calmodulin is known to be much less abundant than its effectors. To test whether calmodulin is limiting for calcineurin activation near the ER, they over-expressed calmodulin and found that this switched ER calcineurin activity from oscillating to integrating modes. Based on this, the authors conclude that calmodulin competition explains the observations. Another finding is that, even though NFAT phosphorylation kinetics are different in cytosol and at ER, calcineurin conformation changes, which require calcium-calmodulin, oscillate in both localizations."

Nevertheless, we used purified YFP to calibrate the intensity counts generated on our microscope, and based on this calibration, we were able to estimate that the intracellular concentration of cytoCaNAR2 ranged between approximately 45 nM and 4 \u03bcM in our experiments. Importantly, we also found that the response patterns reported by each subcellularly targeted CaNAR2 variant held steady over similar ranges of biosensor expression levels, and the Results section has been updated to reflect this finding (see <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2013figure supplement 1</a>). Similarly, we found no meaningful correlation between the expression levels of the calcineurin conformation sensor (CaNARi) or the Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM probe (BSCaM-2) and their observed FRET ratio changes.

No downstream signaling processes were monitored in the BSCaM-2 experiments, thereby limiting the potential for buffering effects, and we also found no correlation between probe expression and the FRET response over a large range of expression levels, which we would have expected to see were the biosensor levels impacting the results. Furthermore, overexpressing CaM or inhibiting CaM using W7 clearly modulated the ER and cytosolic CaNAR responses, respectively, not to mention the fact that overexpressing CaM rescued the BSCaM-2 response at the ER surface (70.03 \u00b1 0.03%). These observations in particular strongly suggest that free Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM levels are limiting near the ER surface, resulting in weaker calcineurin activation at this location. Similar observations were made by Teruel and colleagues, who reported smaller increases in free nuclear Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM levels compared with the cytosol in response to Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients (<a href=\"#bib92\">Teruel et al., 2000</a>). We have now cited their study in the manuscript."
