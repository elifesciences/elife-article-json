Secondly, the two genes might have evolved in different lineages and passed between species via \u2018horizontal gene transfer\u2019.

Reactive oxygen species are produced when energy from sunlight is harvested during photosynthesis. This means that photosynthetic organisms experience \u2018photo-oxidative stress\u2019 and need more efficient antioxidant systems. As such, Wheeler et al. put forward an attractive hypothesis that GULO was lost in eukaryotes that became photosynthetic because this enzyme also produces some reactive oxygen species (namely hydrogen peroxide). Photosynthetic eukaryotes switched to use GLDH instead because this enzyme can synthesise ascorbate without producing reactive oxygen species as by-products. The fact that the <i>Galdieria</i> red algae have retained GULO can also be explained since it grows on or inside porous rocks in hot sulphur springs where photo-oxidative stress is believed to be minimal."

However, photosynthetic bacteria (i.e., cyanobacteria) don't appear to use ascorbate to protect against photo-oxidative stress. This suggests that the \u2018photoprotective\u2019 role of ascorbate may have emerged in photosynthetic eukaryotes after <i>C. paradoxa</i> (and other glaucophytes) diverged from the lineages that went on to be come the red algae, the green algae and the land plants."

In addition, when taken together with recent studies concerning the evolution of other antioxidants (<a href=\"#bib7\">Tohge et al., 2013</a>) and plant hormones (<a href=\"#bib2\">Ju et al., 2015</a>), the enormous potential resulting from the torrent of information provided by modern genome sequencing technologies becomes apparent (<a href=\"#bib6\">Tautz et al., 2010</a>). In the coming years, one can anticipate that the widespread adoption of similar approaches will enable a far greater understanding of the evolution of both fundamental and specialised metabolic pathways in all kingdoms of life."
