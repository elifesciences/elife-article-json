We examined whether dopaminergic neuromodulation regulates activity-dependent glutamatergic synapse formation in the developing striatum. Systemic in vivo treatment with G\u03b1<sub>s</sub>-coupled G-protein receptors (GPCRs) agonists enhanced excitatory synapses on direct pathway striatal spiny projection neurons (dSPNs), whereas rapid production of excitatory synapses on indirect pathway neurons (iSPNs) required the activation of G\u03b1<sub>s</sub> GPCRs in SPNs of both pathways. Nevertheless, in vitro G\u03b1<sub>s</sub> activation was sufficient to enhance spinogenesis induced by glutamate photolysis in both dSPNs and iSPNs, suggesting that iSPNs in intact neural circuits have additional requirements for rapid synaptic development. We evaluated the in vivo effects of enhanced glutamate release from corticostriatal axons and postsynaptic PKA and discovered a mechanism of developmental plasticity wherein rapid synaptogenesis is promoted by the coordinated actions of glutamate and postsynaptic G\u03b1<sub>s</sub>-coupled receptors."

We examined whether dopaminergic neuromodulation regulates activity-dependent glutamatergic synapse formation in the developing striatum. Systemic in vivo treatment with G\u03b1<sub>s</sub>-coupled G-protein receptors (GPCRs) agonists enhanced excitatory synapses on direct pathway striatal spiny projection neurons (dSPNs), whereas rapid production of excitatory synapses on indirect pathway neurons (iSPNs) required the activation of G\u03b1<sub>s</sub> GPCRs in SPNs of both pathways. Nevertheless, in vitro G\u03b1<sub>s</sub> activation was sufficient to enhance spinogenesis induced by glutamate photolysis in both dSPNs and iSPNs, suggesting that iSPNs in intact neural circuits have additional requirements for rapid synaptic development. We evaluated the in vivo effects of enhanced glutamate release from corticostriatal axons and postsynaptic PKA and discovered a mechanism of developmental plasticity wherein rapid synaptogenesis is promoted by the coordinated actions of glutamate and postsynaptic G\u03b1<sub>s</sub>-coupled receptors."

Some signals (referred to as excitatory signals) increase the probability that the neuron receiving the chemical message will produce an electrical impulse. On the other hand, inhibitory messages decrease the likelihood of this activity. Both of these kinds of signals are fast, and act over milliseconds. There is also a diverse set of slower signals, referred to as neuromodulation, which regulates the faster signals. A signaling chemical called dopamine is involved in neuromodulation and is essential for rewarding behavior and complex motor actions. The importance of dopamine is clear from the profound lack of movement seen in individuals with Parkinson\u2019s disease, which is caused by the death of dopamine producing brain cells."

Classical models of dopaminergic signaling in adult animals propose that the activity of dopamine-producing neurons encodes reward prediction errors and that released dopamine regulates the strength of corticostriatal excitatory glutamatergic inputs. This process is thought to favor the execution of a specific action that previously led to reward, at the expense of competing motor programs. An important element of this model is the distinct action of dopamine on the direct and indirect pathways, comprised of two classes of striatal spiny projection output neurons that express different types of dopamine receptors, project to separate downstream targets, and regulate complementary aspects of motor behavior (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bateup et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Kravitz et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Cui et al., 2013</a>). Dopamine differentially regulates biochemical signaling (<a href=\"#bib28\">Nishi et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">1997</a>), neuronal activity and synaptic plasticity in these two classes of striatal neurons, promoting synaptic potentiation and depression through different receptor subtypes (<a href=\"#bib36\">Shen et al., 2008</a>)."

Therefore, we investigated whether dopamine modulates activity-dependent striatal plasticity and synapse formation during this time. In mice, the second postnatal week of life is a period of rapid growth of excitatory synapses on SPNs, a process driven by the release of glutamate from corticostriatal axons (<a href=\"#bib19\">Kozorovitskiy et al., 2012</a>), among other striatal glutamatergic projections. Furthermore, the balance of activity in direct and indirect pathway SPNs (dSPNs and iSPNs, respectively) influences activity in the neocortex, potentially altering the firing patterns of corticostriatal neurons via recurrent circuit interactions (<a href=\"#bib19\">Kozorovitskiy et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Oldenburg and Sabatini, 2015</a>). Thus, positive feedback in recurrent circuits can amplify early glutamatergic signaling, rapidly changing network connectivity. If dopamine modulates glutamatergic synapse function in developing SPNs as it does in mature circuits, it likely interacts with glutamate-dependent neural circuit development during the early postnatal period. In dSPNs, dopamine acts on type 1 dopamine receptor (Drd1), a G\u03b1<sub>s</sub>-coupled GPCR to activate PKA, a critical enzyme involved in cell growth and plasticity (<a href=\"#bib29\">Nishi et al., 2000</a>). In contrast, in iSPNs, dopamine activates type 2 dopamine receptors (Drd2), G\u03b1<sub>i</sub>-coupled GPCRs, decreasing PKA activity. Since PKA activity levels influence spinogenesis and synaptogenesis in cortical pyramidal neurons (<a href=\"#bib21\">Kwon and Sabatini, 2011</a>), dopamine may directly set the threshold for activity-dependent synaptogenesis in striatal SPNs."

Two observations indirectly support the involvement of dopamine in the developmental wiring of the striatum. First, dysfunctions of the dopaminergic system are linked to numerous diseases that are postulated to have a developmental origin, including schizophrenia (<a href=\"#bib23\">Lau et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Laruelle, 2014</a>), obsessive compulsive disorder (<a href=\"#bib26\">Nikolaus et al., 2010</a>) and Tourette Syndrome (<a href=\"#bib4\">Buse et al., 2013</a>).

Instead, neuromodulatory GPCR signaling may be a permissive, or facilitating, signal that acts in concert with other stimuli to induce synaptogenesis in vivo. We hypothesized that GPCR activation modulates glutamate-induced, activity-dependent synaptogenesis. Since Drd1 activation also increases dSPN excitability, which in turn may increase recurrent corticostriatal glutamatergic transmission onto SPNs by altering cortical activity (<a href=\"#bib31\">Oldenburg and Sabatini, 2015</a>), then activation of this receptor alone in vivo\u00a0will (1) activate PKA and (2) enhance glutamate release. This may be sufficient to drive synapse formation. Such stimulatory effects of dopamine on basal ganglia circuitry are consistent with the observation of Drd1 receptor activation-induced locomotion observed in pups, which normally show limited mobility at P8-13 (<a href=\"#bib7\">Dehorter et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Wills et al., 2014</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). This acute locomotion induction has lasting consequences for behavior and brain development, since priming with Drd1 receptor agonist\u00a0administration at P9 potentiated agonist-evoked locomotion at P11 (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). In contrast to dSPNs, iSPNs would be expected to have more complex requirements for synaptogenesis, since iSPN activity is negatively coupled to intrastriatal glutamate release in the adult, via regulation of cortical activity (<a href=\"#bib31\">Oldenburg and Sabatini, 2015</a>). We hypothesize that the cooperation of presynaptic glutamate release and postsynaptic PKA signaling explains why coincident activation of Drd1 receptors (to recurrently drive glutamate release) and A2aRs (to enhance PKA signaling) is required in vivo\u00a0to\u00a0increase synaptogenesis in iSPNs."

We compared the number of photoactivation pulses to threshold, defined as 50% fluorescence increase over baseline in the uncaging location, leading to an appearance of a spine-like extension from the dendrite.

We compared the magnitude of EPSCs evoked by channelrhodopsin (ChR2)-mediated activation of Rbp4-Cre expressing neurons, which include a dense corticostriatal projection, in SPNs in acute brain slices from animals with and without Rs1 expression. <i>Rbp4-Cre; Ai32</i> mice were unilaterally injected in the striatum with a Cre-expressing AAV and Cre-dependent AAV encoding Rs1 (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hsiao et al., 2008</a>) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C\u2013D</a>). This co-injection resulted in broad expression in dorsal striatum SPNs of the injected hemisphere in both dSPNs and iSPNs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>) (0% vs. 98% co-labeling, N\u00a0=\u00a0750 and 728 neurons in control and injected hemispheres, from 3 mice). P8-13 infected mice were injected with the Rs1 ligand RS 67333 (3 mg/kg) and acute brain slices were prepared 1.5\u2009hr later for analysis. Whole-cell voltage clamp recordings were used to monitor pharmacologically isolated, AMPAR-mediated blue light-evoked corticostriatal EPSCs, which were recorded from SPNs in dorsal striatum, located either in the control or in the infected hemisphere. Although this strategy results in ChR2 expression in SPNs, the brief time of expression from a single floxed ChR2 allele yielded negligible direct ChR2-evoked currents in SPNs under whole-cell voltage clamp configuration (<i>e.g</i>., <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>). With this strategy, both the control and infected striatum were exposed to RS 67333 and comparisons were made across SPNs from control and infected hemispheres in the same animal. In the control condition, there was a strong age dependence of peak amplitude of EPSCs, ranging from an average of 10 pA to an average of 196 pA per age group, in a cohort of P8-P13/14 mice (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>; light evoked EPSC amplitude across age, N\u00a0=\u00a014 neurons from 3 mice, 30 neurons from 6 mice and 14 neurons from 3 mice/group. Kruskal-Wallis test p&lt;0.0001, for main effect and Dunn\u2019s post hoc tests). Consistent with our hypothesis, light-evoked EPSC amplitude was increased in virally transduced SPNs, compared to control hemisphere SPNs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>; light-evoked EPSC amplitude, 68.6 \u00b1 29.9 pA control vs. 150.3 \u00b1 55.8 pA injected hemisphere; N\u00a0=\u00a021 and 23 neurons from 4 mice/group, t-test p\u00a0=\u00a00.039). Thus, in vivo transient activation of a G\u03b1<sub>s</sub>-coupled GPCR in SPNs is sufficient to rapidly enhance corticostriatal connectivity, in the presence of otherwise normal corticostriatal transmission. The observed sufficiency of pharmacogenetic PKA activation to enhance corticostriatal connectivity for iSPNs (in contrast to stimulating iSPNs with an A2aR agonist, as in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>) stems from the likelihood that the concurrent pharmacogenetic activation of G\u03b1<sub>s</sub> cascades in dSPNs enhances corticostriatal glutamatergic drive via recurrent connections and regulating cortical activity (<a href=\"#bib31\">Oldenburg and Sabatini, 2015</a>)."

Both peak EPSC amplitude and charge transfer were increased on the stimulated side (light-evoked EPSC amplitude, 9.6 \u00b1 2.4 pA vs. 23.4 \u00b1 4.3 pA for control vs. stimulated hemisphere; charge transfer, 0.64 \u00b1 0.14 and 1.2 \u00b1 0.26 pC for the same comparison; N\u00a0=\u00a019 and 26 neurons from 4 mice/group). These data demonstrate that a major component of the functional reorganization induced through brief in vivo stimulation of corticostriatal afferents in young mice is locally expressed in the striatum. We further probed the\u00a0pharmacological dependence of this form of plasticity and found that it was blocked by either pre-administration of PKA inhibitor H-89 (5 mg/kg), or by a combination of Drd1 and A2aR blockers SKF 83566 (0.5 mg/kg) and istradefylline/KW-6002 (2.5 mg/kg), administered 30 min before optogenetic stimulation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F\u2013G</a>). Light-evoked EPSC amplitude, in presence of H-89, was 18.8 \u00b1 4.4 pA vs. 13.8 \u00b1 3.3 pA in neurons from control and stimulated hemispheres (t-test p\u00a0=\u00a00.376, N\u00a0=\u00a022 and 19 neurons from 3 mice/group). In presence of Drd1 and A2aR blockers, it was 34.2 \u00b1 9.3 pA and 26.5 \u00b1 5.3 pA, respectively (t-test p\u00a0=\u00a00.458, N\u00a0=\u00a012 and 15 neurons from 3 mice/group). Thus, SPN changes induced by glutamatergic stimulation require PKA signaling, which in turn is activated via Drd1 and A2aR for dSPNs and iSPNs, respectively. Increasing either pre-synaptic glutamatergic drive or enhancing striatal PKA signaling is sufficient to rapidly alter SPN synaptogenesis, supporting the idea of cooperative, neuromodulation-dependent circuit remodeling during striatal development."

We found that the same optogenetic stimulation parameters that evoked PKA-dependent enhancements in evoked responses in vivo\u00a0were sufficient to produce a moderate enhancement in light-evoked corticostriatal responses in vitro. In experiments using within-mouse controls, the amplitude of evoked responses was 528.8 \u00b1 69\u00a0pA and 694.4 \u00b1 79\u00a0pA, for neurons in control and stimulated slices respectively (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B\u2013C</a>) (Mann-Whitney test, p\u00a0=\u00a00.037, N\u00a0= 64 and 61 neurons from 4 mice).

Because dopamine tends to increase dSPN PKA activity and decrease iSPN PKA activity (models, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A\u2013B</a>), iSPN spinogenesis may be effectively yoked to dSPN development, as described below. Dopamine is abundant in the developing striatum, and it enhances PKA activity in dSPNs. This allows dSPNs to strongly respond to glutamate release from the first invading axons, becoming integrated into early basal ganglia circuits. On the other hand, iSPN activity and PKA levels are decreased by dopamine (<a href=\"#bib15\">Hernandez-Lopez et al., 2000</a>) and their excitatory wiring may rely either on the positive feedback through direct pathway (<a href=\"#bib19\">Kozorovitskiy et al., 2012</a>) to increase glutamate release in the striatum, or on striatal adenosine levels that may be driven by local activity. This scenario predicts a transient developmental bias in pathway innervation towards dSPNs, which we have previously observed in the frequency of mEPSCs, as well as in dendritic spine density at P14-15 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>) (mEPSC frequency, 0.61 \u00b1 0.1 and 0.35 \u00b1 0.1\u2009Hz for d- and iSPNs, t-test p\u00a0=\u00a00.019; mEPSC amplitude, 14.3 \u00b1 0.5 and 14.0 \u00b1 0.5 pA, p\u00a0=\u00a00.679; dendritic spine density, 0.74 \u00b1 0.025 and 0.52 \u00b1 0.013 spines/\u00b5m, p&lt;0.0001; N\u00a0=\u00a055 neurons from 12 mice and 56 neurons from 11 mice for electrophysiology; a distributed subset of recorded neurons was imaged for dendritic spine density analyses, 67 dSPN dendrites from 22 neurons and 93 iSPN dendrites from 31 neurons).

For glutamate uncaging, 2.5 mM MNI-caged-L-glutamate was perfused into the slice chamber, and 10\u201315 mW of 725 nm light at the specimen plane (60X objective, Olympus, Waltham, MA) was used to focally release the caging group. Secondary and tertiary dendritic branches were selected for dendritic imaging and spinogenesis induction. MNI-glutamate was uncaged near the dendrite (~0.5 or &gt;5 \u00b5m away from the edge) at 2\u2009Hz using up to forty 0.5, 2 or 4 ms-long pulses. Images were continually acquired during the induction protocol at 1\u2009Hz, and uncaging was stopped if an apparent spinehead was visible before 40 uncaging pulses were delivered. For analysis of the spinogenesis timecourse and the 2-site uncaging comparisons, the intensity of pixels along a line crossing the middle of the spinehead (or uncaging spot if no detectable spine appeared) was measured across consecutive images (ImageJ, NIH) and expressed as percentage of maximum fluorescence reached in the uncaging locus 1\u20132\u2009min following induction. For dendritic spine density analyses, stacks through secondary and tertiary dendrites were acquired, coded and analyzed in MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick, MA) and ImageJ."

Reviewer 1 stated that the findings only show that neuromodulation can transiently enhance synaptogenesis but that the experiments do not demonstrate that the dopamine effect is 'necessary' for synaptogenesis. Thus, conclusions such as \"general role for neuromodulators acting on G\u03b1<sub>s</sub>-coupled GPCRs during neural circuit development would transform our understanding of core principle in developmental neurobiology\" (in the Discussion) should be toned down throughout the manuscript. Moreover, reviewer 1 was asking whether a critical time window exists during which the observed phenomena exist. Reviewers 2 and 3 expressed interest in the main findings of the manuscript, in particular that D1Rs and A2aRs can specifically enhance synaptogenesis in dSPN and iSPN, respectively. However, they ask for additional in vitro experiments which demonstrate that the effects of D1 or A2aR agonists are specific to the striatum and not caused by alterations in other cortical areas upon in vivo systemic administration of drugs which reduces/block synaptogenesis. They formulated some key experiments which are attached below. The reviewers and the Reviewing editor felt that these control experiments are critical to support the finding that the observed effects reflect specific actions on iSPNs/dSPNs, but that these should not take more than a month to conduct once the animals are ready."

The optogenetic and chemogenetic experiments provide additional evidence for a corticostriatal interaction. Furthermore, the in vivo pharmacology is entirely consistent with the proposed mechanism.

In order to demonstrate that intra-striatal interactions between cortico-striatal glutamate release and PKA activity are sufficient to rapidly enhance connectivity, we have now performed plasticity induction in the acute slice, though the combination of optogenetic glutamate release and PKA activity stimulation. Figures and text were updated accordingly."

They could use ChR2 stimulation of cortical terminals to elicit excitatory cortical feedback in the presence/absence of drugs to activate/block D1Rs or A2aRs, then measure the effects on synaptogenesis physiologically (by measuring changes in light-evoked EPSCs) or morphologically (by examining spine density). Another possibility would be local infusion of these drugs into the striatum but this is slightly less preferred because there could still be indirect effects of such a manipulation on cortical activity \u2013 it would be ideal to have separate control over cortical activity and striatal neuromodulatory state as would be possible in a slice preparation.</i>"

Compared to optogenetic stimulation of glutamatergic axons alone, the combination of PKA activating drugs with optogenetic stimulation, induced plasticity, as is evidenced by changed in light-evoked EPSCs. Stimulation of PKA activity alone was insufficient. These data, described in a new figure and text, remove potential confounds of recurrent cortical feedback."

The experiment requires that we analyze mice with 3 alleles (Cre, floxed ChR2, cell marker) with comparisons across hemispheres (stimulated and control) and two cell types (marker and non-marker). Because of the strong dependence of corticostriatal transmission on litter size (documented in our previous studies), it is necessary to perform all comparisons in each mouse. Thus, we need to try to get sufficient data in each mouse to compare 4 conditions (2 hemispheres x 2 cell types). Then we need to repeat this in control, D1R antagonist, A2A receptor antagonist, and possibly dual D1R/A2A antagonists treated animals (the latter to have a complete block). In total this experiment requires measurements from 4 cellular conditions in 4 pharmacological conditions in 2 different genotypes, each of which includes 3 transgenes. Each experiment also includes acute surgical implantation of a head mounted LED in a young pup and optogenetic stimulation \u2013 these are not easy manipulations and are relatively low yield. We hope that the referee agrees that this immense amount of work is beyond the scope of this study and, when considered in conjunction with the rest of the study, is not necessary to support its main conclusions."
