Yet, how cardiomyocytes achieve and maintain a post-mitotic state is unknown. Here, we show that cardiomyocyte centrosome integrity is lost shortly after birth. This is coupled with relocalization of various centrosome proteins to the nuclear envelope. Consequently, postnatal cardiomyocytes are unable to undergo ciliogenesis and the nuclear envelope adopts the function as cellular microtubule organizing center. Loss of centrosome integrity is associated with, and can promote, cardiomyocyte G0/G1 cell cycle arrest suggesting that centrosome disassembly is developmentally utilized to achieve the post-mitotic state in mammalian cardiomyocytes. Adult cardiomyocytes of zebrafish and newt, which are able to proliferate, maintain centrosome integrity. Collectively, our data provide a novel mechanism underlying the post-mitotic state of mammalian cardiomyocytes as well as a potential explanation for why zebrafish and newts, but not mammals, can regenerate their heart."

Yet, how cardiomyocytes achieve and maintain a post-mitotic state is unknown. Here, we show that cardiomyocyte centrosome integrity is lost shortly after birth. This is coupled with relocalization of various centrosome proteins to the nuclear envelope. Consequently, postnatal cardiomyocytes are unable to undergo ciliogenesis and the nuclear envelope adopts the function as cellular microtubule organizing center. Loss of centrosome integrity is associated with, and can promote, cardiomyocyte G0/G1 cell cycle arrest suggesting that centrosome disassembly is developmentally utilized to achieve the post-mitotic state in mammalian cardiomyocytes. Adult cardiomyocytes of zebrafish and newt, which are able to proliferate, maintain centrosome integrity. Collectively, our data provide a novel mechanism underlying the post-mitotic state of mammalian cardiomyocytes as well as a potential explanation for why zebrafish and newts, but not mammals, can regenerate their heart."

This suggests that it might be possible to manipulate human heart muscle cells to make them divide and regenerate the heart. Recent research has suggested that structures called centrosomes, known to be required to separate copies of the DNA during cell division, are used as a hub to integrate the initial signals that determine whether a cell should divide or not."

This is supported by the limited regenerative capacity of the adult mammalian heart (<a href=\"#bib46\">Senyo et al., 2014</a>) and the fact that primary adult cardiomyocyte-born tumors are extremely rare, if they exist at all (<a href=\"#bib13\">Dell'Amore et al., 2011</a>). Understanding the underlying mechanisms governing the post-mitotic state of adult mammalian cardiomyocytes may clarify whether it is possible to induce cardiac regeneration based on cardiomyocyte proliferation as seen in zebrafish and newts (<a href=\"#bib44\">Poss et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bettencourt-Dias et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Gamba et al., 2014</a>). Tremendous efforts have been invested to induce postnatal mammalian cardiomyocyte proliferation. However, besides the fact that cell cycle promoting factors (e.g., Cyclins) are downregulated around birth, while cell cycle inhibitors (e.g., Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors) are induced (<a href=\"#bib23\">Ikenishi et al., 2012</a>), little is known about the mechanisms that induce cell cycle exit or establish the post-mitotic state in mammalian cardiomyocytes (<a href=\"#bib58\">van Amerongen and Engel, 2008</a>)."

It consists of a pair of tubulin-based structures, called centrioles, encased in a dense, non-membranous, multi-protein cloud called the pericentriolar matrix (PCM), which is further surrounded by a dispersed array of proteins termed centriolar satellites (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bettencourt-Dias, 2013</a>). Traditionally, the centrosome is known as the <span class=\"underline\">m</span>icro<span class=\"underline\">t</span>ubule <span class=\"underline\">o</span>rganizing <span class=\"underline\">c</span>enter (MTOC) of the cell, and is required for primary cilium formation (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kim and Dynlacht, 2013</a>). Recently, the centrosome has emerged as a critical signaling hub for the cell cycle regulatory machinery (<a href=\"#bib14\">Doxsey et al., 2005</a>). For instance, centrosome localization of Cyclin E and Cyclin A is required for G1/S cell cycle progression (<a href=\"#bib40\">Pascreau et al., 2011</a>). Consistent with this role, increasing evidence supports the requirement of a functional centrosome for proliferative potential in mammalian cell-types (<a href=\"#bib14\">Doxsey et al., 2005</a>). For instance, cells undergo G0/G1 arrest when (i) centrosomes are removed via laser ablation, (ii) centrosome integrity is disrupted via knockdown of centrosome proteins, or (iii) centriole biogenesis is blocked via a chemical inhibitor (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hinchcliffe et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Khodjakov and Rieder, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Srsen et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Mikule et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Wong et al., 2015</a>)."

                        "text": "A normal diploid cell in G0/G1-phase contains one centrosome with two paired centrioles. During S-phase the centrosome duplicates whereby the two parental centrioles form daughter centrioles. Around the transition from G2-phase to mitosis, parental centrioles \u2018split\u2019 (loss of cohesion) resulting in two separated centrosomes that become part of the spindle poles during mitosis (<a href=\"#bib14\">Doxsey et al., 2005</a>). When centrosome integrity is compromised during G0/G1-phase, centrioles can lose cohesion (i.e., become unpaired) adopting a premature \u2018split\u2019 configuration, defined as a distance &gt; 2 \u00b5m between centrioles (<a href=\"#bib21\">Graser et al., 2007</a>). To determine if centrosome integrity changes in cardiomyocytes during development, we analyzed centriole configuration using antibodies against \u03b3-tubulin, a marker of both the centriole and the PCM (<a href=\"#bib48\">Sonnen et al., 2012</a>). Centrioles were observed to be in a typical paired configuration in the majority of cultured cardiomyocytes isolated from embryonic day (E) 15, E18, and postnatal day (P) 0 rat hearts (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>) as well as in cardiomyocytes from E15 and P0 rat heart sections (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). In contrast, shortly after birth, centrioles were split in the vast majority of P3 and P5 cardiomyocytes in vitro (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>) and in vivo (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). Analysis of mother and daughter centriole markers (Odf2 and Centrobin, respectively) in isolated rat cardiomyocytes verified that each \u03b3-tubulin signal represented a single centriole (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). As an internal control, cardiac non-myocytes from the same cultures and tissue sections were examined. The majority of non-myocytes in the heart are fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells that all have the ability to proliferate. At all examined developmental stages, non-myocytes showed a typical paired-centriole configuration indicating that the split-centriole phenotype was cardiomyocyte-specific (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). Collectively, these data demonstrate that centriole cohesion, and thus centrosome integrity, is lost in mammalian cardiomyocytes shortly after birth."

The PCM proteins Pericentrin and Cdk5Rap2 have previously been shown to be required for centriole-cohesion (<a href=\"#bib21\">Graser et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Matsuo et al., 2010</a>). Consistent with this function, both PCM proteins localized to the centrosome in E15-isolated cardiomyocytes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D,E</a>). In contrast, both proteins were localized to the nuclear envelope in P3-isolated cardiomyocytes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D,E</a>). Although remnants of Pericentrin and Cdk5Rap2 could be observed at the centriole in P3-isolated cardiomyocytes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D,E</a>), their presence was significantly reduced when centrioles were split (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1F</a>). <i>Pcnt</i> siRNA-mediated knockdown in P0-isolated cardiomyocytes resulted in an increase of split-centrioles (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F,G</a>), confirming that Pericentrin is required for centriole-cohesion in cardiomyocytes. In contrast to PCM proteins, the centriole-associated proteins CEP135, Odf2, and Centrobin were not observed at the nuclear envelope in P3-isolated cardiomyocytes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C,D</a>).

Consistent with this, PCM1 localized at the centrosome and the nuclear envelope in E15- and P3-isolated cardiomyocytes, respectively (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,H</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). Further, nuclear envelope localization of PCM1 occurred by P0 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>), prior to that of Pericentrin (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Occasionally, PCM1 was observed in a semi-belt pattern at the nuclear envelope proximal to the centrosome in E15-isolated cardiomyocytes (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1G</a>), indicating a transitional state. These data suggest that in cardiomyocytes, PCM1 is also required for the localization of Pericentrin to the centrosome. To test this, we overexpressed the major isoform of Pericentrin associated with the centrosome, Pericentrin B, in E15-, P0-, and P3-isolated cardiomyocytes and non-myocytes. Pericentrin B-GFP localized to centrioles in non-myocytes as well as E15-isolated cardiomyocytes (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A,B</a>). In contrast, Pericentrin B-GFP did not localize to the centrioles in the vast majority of P0- and P3-isolated cardiomyocytes but rather created cellular aggregates which were not observed in E15 cardiomyocytes or non-myocytes. These data indicate that the machinery required for centrosome integrity is lost in postnatal cardiomyocytes."

Pericentrin B is ubiquitously expressed at all developmental stages. In contrast, expression of Pericentrin S starts late in fetal development and was found to be specific for adult heart and skeletal muscle (<a href=\"#bib37\">Miyoshi et al., 2006</a>). Therefore, we speculated that expression of the Pericentrin S isoform may coincide with changes in centrosome integrity during the development of cardiomyocytes. RT-PCR analysis revealed the appearance of <i>Pcnt S</i> expression shortly before birth in the heart (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1K</a>). Antibodies specific for the Pericentrin B isoform indicated that Pericentrin S, and not Pericentrin B, was the predominant Pericentrin isoform at the nuclear envelope in P3-isolated cardiomyocytes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1L</a>).

This suggests that cardiomyocytes, which are arrested shortly after birth in G0/G1 phase (<a href=\"#bib54\">Takeuchi, 2014</a>), should be capable of ciliogenesis. Yet, given that PCM1, which is required for ciliogenesis (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kim et al., 2008</a>), is lost from the centrosome during development, we speculated that ciliogenesis is suppressed in cardiomyocytes. Induction of ciliogenesis via serum starvation resulted in the formation of a primary cilium in E15-isolated cardiomyocytes and non-myocytes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). However, the frequency of cardiomyocytes capable of ciliogenesis decreased with heart development (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>) with less than 1% of isolated postnatal cardiomyocytes, which were arrested in G1/G0 as confirmed by lack of Ki67 expression and FACS analysis (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013D</a>), forming a primary cilium.

As these proteins localize to the nuclear envelope during neonatal development, we hypothesized that the cellular MTOC is transferred from the centrosome to the nuclear envelope. In accordance with this hypothesis, microtubules were found to predominantly emanate from the centrosome in E15-isolated cardiomyocytes as also observed in non-myocytes. In contrast, in P3-isolated cardiomyocytes microtubules were found to predominantly emanate from the nuclear envelope (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). The local shift of the MTOC during development was confirmed by a MTOC-regrowth assay (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1E,F</a>), which further demonstrated that microtubules do not emanate from centrioles in P3-isolated cardiomyocytes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1G,H</a>).

To test this, the cell cycle marker Ki67 was assessed in cardiomyocytes from different developmental stages. Cardiomyocyte proliferative potential decreased with neonatal development (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Moreover, P3-isolated cardiomyocytes with paired-centrioles exhibited greater proliferative potential than those with split centrioles (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,C</a>) at a frequency similar to that of E15- and P0-isolated cardiomyocytes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,C</a>)\u2014of which the vast majority have paired-centrioles (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). In contrast, cardiac non-myocyte proliferative potential, as well as the percentage of non-myocytes with paired centrioles, did not decrease during neonatal development (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Subsequently, we tested whether centrosome integrity is required for cardiomyocyte proliferative potential. Centrosome integrity was disrupted by either siRNA-mediated knockdown of <i>Pcnt</i>, or overexpression of a RFP-tagged dominant negative C-terminal Pericentrin (RFP-Peri<sup>CT</sup>), which displaces endogenous Pericentrin localization (<a href=\"#bib20\">Gillingham and Munro, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Mikule et al., 2007</a>). Immunofluorescence analysis confirmed that RFP-Peri<sup>CT</sup> localizes to the centrioles in P0-isolated cardiomyocytes (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Both methods used to disrupt centrosome integrity suppressed P0-isolated cardiomyocyte proliferative potential (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D\u2013F</a>). Taken together, these data indicate that loss of centrosome integrity promotes G0/G1 cell cycle arrest in mammalian cardiomyocytes."

Since RFP-Peri<sup>CT</sup> RNA did not cause necrosis or lethality, it is plausible that the observed developmental delay was caused, at least partly, by reduced proliferation of RFP-Peri<sup>CT</sup>-expressing cells. To further test an effect on proliferation, we injected DNA constructs driving RFP or dominant negative Pericentrin (RFP-Peri<sup>CT</sup>) expression from the CMV promoter into one-cell stage embryos and analyzed the size of RFP-positive clones of cells at 20 hpf. Embryos were sorted into four classes according to the size of the clones, namely no visible clones (class I), few scattered cells (class II), medium-sized clones (class III), and large clones (class IV). RFP DNA-injected controls exhibited comparable numbers of embryos displaying no clones (class 1), scattered (class II), medium-sized (class III), and larger clones (class IV). In contrast, the majority of RFP-Peri<sup>CT</sup> DNA-injected embryos contained either no clones (class I) or few scattered clones (class II), while larger clones (class III and IV) were rarely seen (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1G,H</a>).

Upon birth, the neonatal heart, and the cardiomyocytes therein, undergo increased hemodynamic stress. Effective cardiomyocyte function in response to increased hemodynamic stress may require a cytoskeletal architecture more conducive to handling postnatal physical stresses (e.g., a nuclear envelope-based MTOC). Thus, centrosome disassembly may be a result of cytoskeletal reorganization. In this scenario, proliferative potential might be sacrificed for postnatal function."

However, we observe that an absence of centrosome integrity correlates with multiple spindle poles. Although multiple spindle poles are generally resolved into a semi-clustered/pseudo-bipolar conformation, this process is nevertheless highly prone to the formation of merotelic spindle-kinetochore attachments, which can promote chromosome missegregation (<a href=\"#bib19\">Ganem et al., 2009</a>). Indeed, postnatal cardiomyocytes induced to proliferate exhibit chromosome segregation abnormalities (<a href=\"#bib16\">Engel et al., 2006</a>). While cell viability can exist when aneuploidy is limited (e.g., as seen in Down Syndrome), aneuploidy is generally not well tolerated (<a href=\"#bib56\">Torres et al., 2008</a>). Therefore, proliferation of adult cardiomyocytes may not necessarily result in viable daughter cells. Thus, in the absence of a functional centrosome, whether a particular manipulation induces aneuploidy, and to what degree, may be a critical factor in determining its regenerative therapeutic potential."

During S-phase, centrioles are duplicated, with each mother centriole forming a daughter centriole, which remains closely attached (i.e., engaged) until mid-anaphase (<a href=\"#bib31\">Kuriyama and Borisy, 1981</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Sluder, 2013</a>). When mother-daughter centrioles are engaged, only the mother centriole exhibits a strong \u03b3-tubulin signal (<a href=\"#bib60\">Wang et al., 2011</a>). Thus, one speculation is that when cells that lack centriole-cohesion enter mitosis, they have an increased likelihood of premature loss of centriole-engagement, thus accounting for the four \u03b3-tubulin signals observed at metaphase. However, it has to be considered that induction of mitosis in bi-nucleated cardiomyocytes, which increasingly appear after birth, results in four \u03b3-tubulin signals in metaphase corresponding to four duplicated centrioles."

This has questioned the requirement of a centrosome for cell proliferation during development and regeneration. However, there are significant differences between planarians and vertebrates in cell cycle control. For example, planarians express only one single repressive E2F, whereas mammals and zebrafish express several repressive and activating E2Fs. In addition, planarians do not have Cyclin E or Cyclin A homologs. Further, cyclin-dependent kinase CDK2 (to which Cyclin E/A usually binds) is expressed at such low levels in planarians that it is considered functionally dead (<a href=\"#bib64\">Zhu and Pearson, 2013</a>). This is important as in mammals centrosome localization of Cyclin E and Cyclin A is required for G1/S cell cycle progression (<a href=\"#bib40\">Pascreau et al., 2011</a>). Thus, at least in the case of Cyclin E and Cyclin A, planarians lack centrosome-regulated cell cycle factors. In addition, our data indicate that centrosome integrity is required for proliferation during zebrafish development. This is in agreement with the recent observation that plk4 depletion in zebrafish impairs centriolar biogenesis during development and increases premature cell cycle exit (independent of ciliogenesis defects) resulting in reduced zebrafish size (<a href=\"#bib34\">Martin et al., 2014</a>). Other examples of centriole-associated genes whose depletion causes cell cycle defects resulting in impaired development are <i>stil</i> (<a href=\"#bib41\">Pfaff et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Vulprecht et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Sun et al., 2014</a>) and <i>cetn2</i> (<a href=\"#bib12\">Delaval et al., 2011</a>). While there is no evidence for the requirement of functional centrosomes in cardiac regeneration in zebrafish, there are data that indirectly suggest that centrosome function might be required for cardiac regeneration. For example it has been shown that inhibition of <i>mps1</i> and <i>plk1</i>, factors implicated in centrosome assembly and maturation (<a href=\"#bib43\">Pike and Fisk, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Joukov et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Kong et al., 2014</a>), impairs cardiac regeneration in zebrafish after apex resection (<a href=\"#bib44\">Poss et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Jopling et al., 2010</a>). Thus, it will be interesting in the future to test if destruction of centrosome integrity will indeed abolish the ability of zebrafish to regenerate their heart."

To prevent contaminations, animals were kept 24 hr in advance in a Sulfamerazine bath (5 g/l, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) for disinfection. Organ removal was performed under deep anesthesia, by incubating the animals in a Tricaine solution (1 g/l, Sigma) with pH 7.4 for 15\u201320 min. After decapitation, ventricles were removed, washed several times with 65% L15 Leibovitz media (Gibco, Grand Island, New York, USA) with antibiotics (2% penicillin/streptomycin and ciprofloxacin (10 \u00b5g/ml)) and incubated over night at 25\u00b0C. Thereafter, enzymatic digestion followed with a sterile mixture of collagenase (1 mg/ml, Sigma), elastase (0.1 mg/ml, Sigma) and DNase (0.1 mg/ml, Sigma) with glucose (3 mg/ml, Sigma) and BSA (1.5 mg/ml, Sigma) in aPBS (75% PBS) for 6 hr at 27\u00b0C.

Mouse iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (Axiogenesis AG, Cologne, Germany) were thawed and plated according to manufacturer's instructions. Mammalian cardiomyocytes were cultured on 1 mg/ml fibronectin (Sigma)-coated glass coverslips. Isolated cardiomyocytes were seeded and cultured in DMEM/F-12, Glutamax<sup>TM</sup>-I (Life Technologies, Darmstadt, Germany) + Penicillin (100 U/ml)/Streptomycin (100 \u00b5g/ml) (Pen/Step) (Life Technologies) for 2 days prior to experimentation. To analyze proliferative potential of whole cardiomyocyte populations, cardiomyocytes were cultured with 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Sigma) for 2 days. To analyze proliferative potential between cardiomyocytes with paired and split centrioles, cardiomyocytes were cultured with 20% FBS + 2 mM hydroxyurea (HU) (Sigma), for 2 days. As centriole-cohesion is normally lost at G2/M, G1/S arrest with hydroxyurea prevents misinterpreting normal loss of centriole-cohesion (which occurs in G2) for precocious loss of centriole-cohesion (which occurs during G1). To analyze mitotic aberrations, neonatal cardiomyocytes were cultured with 10% FBS for 2 days, and adult cardiomyocytes were seeded in 10% horse serum and 20 \u00b5M cytosine \u03b2-D-arabinofuranoside (Sigma) for 2 days and then stimulated with 50 ng/ml FGF1 (R&amp;D; Systems, Abingdon, UK) + p38i (5 \u00b5M SB203580, Tocris Biosystems, Bristol, UK) for 2 days as previously described (<a href=\"#bib15\">Engel et al., 2005</a>). To analyze microtubule regrowth in mammalian and zebrafish cardiomyocytes, cells were cultured for 2 days and then treated with 5 \u00b5g/ml nocodazole (Sigma) for 2.5 hr. Subsequently, cells were washed with nocodazole-free media for 5\u201310 min to allow microtubule regrowth. To analyze microtubule regrowth in newt cardiomyocytes, cells were cultured for 5 days and then placed on ice for 3 hr. Subsequently, cells were returned to 25\u00b0C for 10 min. For siRNA studies cells were cultured for 2 days prior to transfection of siRNAs (Qiagen, Venlo, Limburg, Netherlands) using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Life Technologies). Cycling and MTOC regrowth assays utilizing siRNAs were conducted 2 days after siRNA transfection. Plasmids were transfected with Lipofectamine LTX (Life Technologies) on the day of seeding. Cycling assays were conducted 2 days after plasmid transfection. To induce ciliogenesis, cardiomyocytes were seeded and cultured in DMEM GlutaMAX<sup>TM</sup>-I (Gibco) + Pen/Strep for 3 days."

The manuscript is well written, and the data are mostly convincing. Although the role of centrosome integrity in cell proliferation has been heavily studied, it has been always in the context of centrosome component mutants leading to a cell proliferation problem. In contrast, this manuscript provides a novel insight into how centrosome disassembly may be developmentally utilized to achieve cell cycle arrest.

Functional evidence is required to show that species-specific developmental changes in centrosome disassembly lead to differences in cardiomyocyte proliferation. The authors present data indicating that newt and zebrafish heart muscle cells contain centrosomes, whereas adult mouse heart cells do not. This result is exciting, as it could potentially explain how heart tissue can regenerate in newt and zebrafish. However, no further experiments are provided to test this hypothesis. It is not clear if centrosomes in adult newt and zebrafish cardiomyoctyes are indeed needed for regeneration. Nor is it clear if these centrosomes are even functional (i.e., do they nucleate MTs?). This is important to test, because tissue regeneration occurs in planarians even though they lack centrosomes. Furthermore, planarian regeneration proceeds normally even if centriole formation is abrogated via RNAi-mediated knockdown of SAS-4 (Azimzadeh, 2012, Science). Thus, the link between centrosome integrity and regenerative capacity requires more investigation. Does centrosome loss in cardiomyocytes eliminate the ability of adult newts or zebrafish to regenerate heart tissue?"

Therefore, the lack of ciliogenesis in post-mitotic (supposedly G1/G0-arrested) cardiomyocytes requires further explanation/discussion. First, how firm are the data that support \u201cG1/G0\u201d arrest of cardiomyocytes? Is it possible that they are arrested in G2 phase of the cell cycle (thus do not form cilia)? Has anybody really examined the cell cycle status of post-mitotic cardiomyocytes? Ki67 is only a marker for \u201ccycling cells\u201d and does not tell in which cell cycle stage the cells are. Instead, true G1 markers such as Cip/Kip, Arf and DNA content (2N vs 4N) should be tested. Cardiomyocytes may represent a novel population of mammalian cells that enter quiescence and differentiate in G2 phase of the cell cycle (with 4C DNA content). This possibility is particularly plausible. Given the result shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a> (p38i) are these cells in G2 with four centrioles (G2 cells have two centrosomes, each of which contains two centrioles)? Upon differentiation, those two centrioles would split as is shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, yielding 4 spindle poles when forced to enter mitosis due to p38i."

Two questions regarding this point: 1) does overexpression of Pericentrin B prevent cardiomyocytes from entering cell cycle arrest (possibly with a differentiation defect)? 2) Do fish and newts have the S isoform? Since most of the data in this paper are correlational, the sufficiency of the Pericentrin B form to inhibit cell cycle arrest should be shown. We understand that Pericentrin might not be the only regulator of centrosome integrity and the negative results would not necessarily be conclusive."

For example, although the planarian genome contains all components of the Rb pathway, they have undergone gene loss from the ancestral state, similar to other species in their phylum. A single Rb homolog (Smed-Rb) controls stem cell maintenance, similar to the Rb-homologs p107 and p130 in vertebrates. The most severe reduction occurred in E2F genes with a single remaining repressive E2F, in contrast to several repressive and activating E2Fs in mammals and zebrafish (Zhu et al., 2013, Dev Biol). In addition, genome and transcriptome analyses have revealed that planarians do not have either Cyclin E or Cyclin A homologs and further, cyclin-dependent kinase CDK2 (to which Cyclin E/A usually binds) is expressed at such low levels in planarians it is considered functionally dead (Zhu, 2013, Developmental Biology). This is important, as in mammals centrosome localization of Cyclin E and Cyclin A is required for G1/S cell cycle progression (<a href=\"#bib40\">Pascreau et al., 2011</a>, Cell Cycle). Thus, at least in the case of Cyclin E and Cyclin A, planarians lack centrosome-regulated cell cycle factors. Thus, the fact that planaria do not need a centrosome might not necessarily indicate that it is not required for proliferation in cell types of other species.

While Pericentrin B-GFP localized to the centrosomes of non-myocytes and most E15-cardiomyocytes, it failed to localize to centrioles in the majority of P0 and P3 cardiomyocytes.

Yet, from a still photo like in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3I</a>, it is impossible to say if this particular cell will divide or not. Thus, we stated in the manuscript only that: \u201cSimilarly, adult-isolated cardiomyocytes induced to re-enter the cell cycle by p38i + FGF1 also exhibited multiple \u03b3-tubulin foci during metaphase (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3I</a>).\u201d"
