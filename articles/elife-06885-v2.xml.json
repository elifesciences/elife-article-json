While Ngn1 substantially suppresses the activation of the astrogliogenic Jak-Stat pathway, the underlying molecular mechanism was unknown. Here, by employing in vivo and in vitro approaches, we report that Ngn1 binds to the promoter of a brain-enriched microRNA, miR-9, and activates its expression during neurogenesis. Subsequently, our in vitro study showed that miR-9 directly targets mRNAs of <i>Lifr-beta</i>, <i>Il6st (gp130)</i>, and <i>Jak1</i> to down-regulate these critical upstream components of the Jak-Stat pathway, achieving inhibition of Stat phosphorylation and consequently, suppression of astrogliogenesis. This study revealed Ngn1 modulated non-coding RNA epigenetic regulation during cell fate specifications."

While Ngn1 substantially suppresses the activation of the astrogliogenic Jak-Stat pathway, the underlying molecular mechanism was unknown. Here, by employing in vivo and in vitro approaches, we report that Ngn1 binds to the promoter of a brain-enriched microRNA, miR-9, and activates its expression during neurogenesis. Subsequently, our in vitro study showed that miR-9 directly targets mRNAs of <i>Lifr-beta</i>, <i>Il6st (gp130)</i>, and <i>Jak1</i> to down-regulate these critical upstream components of the Jak-Stat pathway, achieving inhibition of Stat phosphorylation and consequently, suppression of astrogliogenesis. This study revealed Ngn1 modulated non-coding RNA epigenetic regulation during cell fate specifications."

Other brain cells\u2014including star-shaped cells called astrocytes\u2014support this network. Both neurons and astrocytes originate from the same group of stem cells, which first give rise to neurons in a process called neurogenesis before they switch to producing astrocytes. A protein called neurogenin 1 promotes neurogenesis and suppresses the formation of astrocytes by regulating the activity of particular genes. It does so by binding to a region within the genes called the promoter."

Previous research has shown that neurogenin 1 is present at high levels when stem cells start to make neurons, which leads to the inactivation the Jak-Stat pathway. However, when stem cells start to make astrocytes, the levels of neurogenin 1 decrease and the Jak-Stat pathway is activated. This signaling pathway therefore acts as a switch for the transition from neurogenesis to the formation of astrocytes, but it is not clear exactly how it works."

These molecules can be used as templates to assemble proteins\u2014known as messenger RNAs. Alternatively, they may be processed to make another type of RNA called microRNA, which can switch off the activity of particular genes by promoting the destruction of particular messenger RNAs. Zhao et al. studied neurogenesis in the mouse brain and found that neurogenin 1 can directly bind to the promoter of a gene that makes a microRNA called miR-9."

In turn, this microRNA lowers the activity of several critical genes that encode proteins involved in the Jak-Stat pathway. Zhao et al.'s findings reveal that neurogenin 1 promotes neurogenesis and inhibits astrocyte formation by regulating the production of miR-9. The Jak-Stat pathway plays important roles in nerve injury, neural repair, and the immune system, so drugs that target miR-9 may have the potential to be developed into new therapies to treat diseases that affect the nervous system."

Lif-activated Jak-Stat signaling pathway in neural stem/progenitor cells (NPCs) starts with three critical components at the cell membrane: the heterodimeric Lif receptor Lifr-beta and Il6st, as well as the receptor-associated Janus kinase (Jak), which are involved in activation of the signaling transducer and activator of transcription (Stat) (<a href=\"#bib11\">Sun et al., 2001</a>). We previously demonstrated that the expression of the proneural basic-Helix-Loop-Helix (bHLH) factor neurogenin 1 (Ngn1) inhibits glial differentiation by two distinct mechanisms: (1) Ngn1 sequesters the transcription co-activators Crebbp (CBP)/E1A binding protein p300 (Ep300) away from glial specific promoters; (2) Ngn1 inhibits Stat1/3 phosphorylation (<a href=\"#bib11\">Sun et al., 2001</a>). Moreover, we have previously revealed that during astrogliogenic period, phosphor-Stat1/3 directly induces the expression of Il6st and Jak1 to strengthen Stat signaling and trigger astrogliogenesis (<a href=\"#bib5\">He et al., 2005</a>). However, the underlying mechanism of how Ngn1 inhibits Stat1/3 activity to block precocious astrocyte differentiation during the neurogenic period is still elusive."

Recently, a group of small non-coding RNA, microRNA (miRNA), has emerged as a novel neuroepigenetic mechanism that can rapidly fine-tune gene expression to regulate developmental timing and cell fate specification (<a href=\"#bib7\">Lee et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Wightman et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Shibata et al., 2008</a>). While screening the expression pattern of brain specific miRNAs in developing brains and in adult brains by quantitative PCR (qPCR), we found that expression of miR-9 showed a bell-shaped pattern with their expression reaching maximum level at E16, right before the onset of astrogliogenesis (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, upper panel). To analyze temporal expression of miR-9 in developing mouse brain, we carried out in situ hybridization (ISH) analysis. Our ISH data showed that miR-9 was extensively expressed in the ventricular zone (VZ) and subventricular zone (SVZ) progenitors in prenatal brains. In neonatal brains (P1\u2013P7), the expression of miR-9 persisted in the SVZ, but at a lower level (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Previous studies by <a href=\"#bib2\">Britz et al. (2006)</a> and <a href=\"#bib4\">Ge et al. (2006)</a> showed that the Ngn1 was highly expressed in VZ/SVZ progenitors during neurogenic period. Taken together, these evidences implied that the expression pattern of miR-9 somewhat correlated with the expression of Ngn1, compatible with a potential regulatory relationship between Ngn1 and miR-9."

Subsequently, we confirmed that Ngn1, but not its DNA-binding mutant form, AQ-Ngn1, specifically activated the miR-9-2 promoter-driven luciferase reporter (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). As expected, when the E-box element was mutated, Ngn1 activation of the miR-9-2 promoter was abolished (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). To further confirm direct binding of Ngn1 to the putative binding site within the miR-9-2 promoter, we performed chromatin-immunoprecipitation combined with qPCR (ChIP-qPCR) using cultured mouse E11 cortical NPCs expressing T7-tagged Ngn1. The ChIP-qPCR analysis showed that Ngn1 directly associated with the miR-9-2 putative promoter region encompassing the E-box element, but not to the promoter of an irrelevant/control brain enriched miRNA, miR-99b (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). To determine whether Ngn1 can directly bind to miR-9-2 promoter in vivo, we performed gene-specific ChIP-qPCR experiments using mouse cortex at both the neurogenic stage (E15) when Ngn1 was robustly expressed and the astrogliogenic stage (P3) when Ngn1 expression was diminished. We found that the miR-9-2 promoter was occupied by endogenous Ngn1 in E15 but not in P3 cortex (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). Finally, we found that overexpression of Ngn1 significantly up-regulated miR-9 expression (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>).

Based on these evidences, therefore, we predicted that miR-9 should play essential roles in inhibiting astrocyte differentiation. To test this, we built miR-9 overexpression (miR-9) and miR-9 knockdown sponge (miR-9AS) constructs (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). miR-9, miR-9AS, or control plasmid was delivered into progenitor cells that resided in the ventricular surface by in utero electroporation at E16 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). The electroporated cells (GFP+) migrated to layers 2/3 without obvious migration defect in all experimental conditions. We analyzed the ratios of both astrocyte marker+ cells and neuronal marker+ cells vs total transfected cells (GFP+) at P30.

                        "text": "We confirmed that transfection of mouse NPCs with exogenous miR-9 duplex blocked phosphorylation of Stat1/3 without altering their protein levels (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>), which is in agreement with the work by <a href=\"#bib6\">Krichevsky et al. (2006)</a>. To explore how miR-9 inhibits Stat phosphorylation, we scanned the 3\u2032 UTRs of three upstream components of the Jak-Stat pathway (<a href=\"http://www.targetscan.com\">www.targetscan.com</a>) and found that <i>Lifr-beta</i>, <i>Il6st</i>, and <i>Jak1</i> contain putative miR-9 binding-sites (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). Luciferase reporter assays were used to confirm miR-9 targeting of these components. Transfection of exogenous miR-9 duplex led to an average of 40% decrease in luciferase activities of reporter constructs carrying 3\u2032 UTRs of <i>Lifr-beta</i>, <i>Il6st</i>, and <i>Jak1</i> mRNAs. Such effect was reversed by a miR-9 inhibitor (duplex) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Furthermore, we showed that the effects of miR-9 on the targets were dependent on the miR-9 binding-sites within the 3\u2032 UTRs as the luciferase reporter containing mutant <i>Lifr-beta</i> 3\u2032 UTR (with mutated miR-9 binding-site) was resistant to miR-9 inhibition (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). In line with the luciferase assay, we showed that the transfection of mouse NPCs with exogenous miR-9 duplex reduced protein levels of Lifr-beta, Il6st, and Jak1 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). We confirmed that Ngn1 also down-regulated the expression levels of Lifr-beta, Il6st, and Jak1 (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>) (<a href=\"#bib11\">Sun et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">He et al., 2005</a>). We further verified this result by luciferase assays. Overexpression of Ngn1 suppressed the luciferase activities of all three critical component of Jak-Stat pathway (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2D</a>). In supporting the above-mentioned findings, we showed that co-expression of a constitutively active form of Stat3 (Stat3C) with miR-9 in NPCs could bypass the effect of miR-9 inhibition on astrocyte differentiation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). In addition, we previously showed that Jak-Stat signaling has a positive auto-regulation loop, where phosphor-Stat1/3 activates Il6st and Jak1 expression (<a href=\"#bib5\">He et al., 2005</a>). Therefore, the DNA binding mutant Ngn1 (AQ-Ngn1), by sequestration of the transcriptional co-activator Crebbp, should also inhibit Stat1/3 mediated activation of Il6st and Jak1, which in turn inhibits Stat1/3 phosphorylation (<a href=\"#bib11\">Sun et al., 2001</a>). It appeared that the Ngn1 sequestration regulation and the Ngn1 induced miR-9 regulation acted jointly to suppress Jak-Stat signaling to warrant the neuronal cell fate specification during the time period of neurogenesis (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>)."

This study demonstrated a novel molecular mechanism through which miR-9 mediated the action of Ngn1 by suppressing the expression of three major components of Jak-Stat singling, Lifr-beta, Il6st, and Jak1, which attenuated Stat1/3 phosphorylation to inhibit the astrogliogenic differentiation genes or programs. Our previous and present work revealed that Ngn1 modulated multiple layers of genetic and epigenetic regulations to secure the process of neuronal fate specification."

Briefly, after normal serum blocking and before primary antibody incubation, the mouse brain sections were incubated with unconjugated affiniPure Fab fragment goat Anti-Mouse IgG (H + L) (Jackson ImmunoResearch Labs, West Grove, PA) for 1 hr at room temperature. Fluorophore conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Invitrogen (Molecular Probe). Images were taken with a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope, processed with software NIH ImageJ and Imaris (Bitplane), and composed with adobe Photoshop."

Cells were treated with 1/20 vol of 2.5 M glycine to quench the formaldehyde and washed three times with 1\u00d7 PBS and pellets were harvested and stored at \u221280\u00b0C prior to use. Cells were re-suspended, lysed, and sonicated to solubilize and shear cross-linked DNA.

Beads were then washed five times with RIPA buffer and 1 time with TE containing 50 mM NaCl. Bound complexes were eluted from the beads in elution buffer by heating at 65\u00b0C with occasional vortex, and crosslinking was reversed by 6 hr incubation at 65\u00b0C. The WCE was also treated for crosslink reversal with additional elution buffer at the same time.

They identify a region upstream of the miR-9-2 gene that is bound by Ngn1, with overexpression of Ngn1 increasing miR-9 expression. Electoporation of cortical progenitor cells with miR-9 inhibits astrocyte production (as measured by GFAP expression), and transfection of cells with miR-9 reduces expression of LIFR\u03b2, gp130 and JAK1, an effect likely mediated through direct binding to the 3' UTRs of their mRNAs."

Since the genetic liabilities for brain regional- or cell type-dependent behavioral traits are difficult to test in traditional knockout and transgenic animals, in utero electroporation can be used as an alternative tool to study biological questions and, in particular, brain regions. Currently, lacking of astroglio-lineage specific or cell lineage specific miR-9 knockout transgenic mice make lineage tracing difficult. Moreover, miR-9-2 traditional knockout mice die in the early weeks of life, which also hampers astroglio-lineage tracing in vivo (Shibata et al., J. Neuroscience, 2011, 31:3407 and personal communication). Therefore, in the current study, we decided to use in utero electroporation approach to study the role of miR-9 in regulation of astrogliogenesis in vivo."

The expression levels of miR-9 decreased dramatically in the cortical germinal zone in neonatal brains (P1 and P7) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Studies by Britz et al. and Ge et al. (our lab) showed that in mid-stage cortical development (E14-E15.5), Ngn1 was highly expressed in the ventricular zone (VZ) and the subventricular zone (SVZ) progenitors. It was less abundant near the ventricular surface (Britz et al., Cerebral Cortex, 2006, 16:i138 and Ge et al., PNAS, 2006, 103:1319)."

It appeared that this small set of cells expanded in P1 and P7 SVZ, suggesting that these cells may contribute to a portion of astrocytes in the cortex. In the current study, by employing an in utero electroporation approach, we pulse-labeled progenitors in the ventricular surface at E16 that produced astrocytes in the superficial neocortical layers. It seemed that this subset of progenitors expressed low or undetectable Ngn1 and miR-9 during the time period of astrogliogenesis. It would be interesting to examine the fates of this progenitor pool in a following study."

MiR-9 expression peaks at E16 by qPCR and so showing expression by ISH remains a major gap and is needed. While the authors cite technical difficulties, these problems seem overstated given that ISH probes are clearly working in adult tissue and E16 ISH is standard procedure in many labs. The requested data would greatly strengthen the paper</i>."
