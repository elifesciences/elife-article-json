We have uncovered a substantial sex difference in the pathology of the aging gut in <i>Drosophila</i>. The intestinal epithelium of the aging female undergoes major deterioration, driven by intestinal stem cell (ISC) division, while lower ISC activity in males associates with delay or absence of pathology, and better barrier function, even at old ages. Males succumb to intestinal challenges to which females are resistant, associated with fewer proliferating ISCs, suggesting a trade-off between highly active repair mechanisms and late-life pathology in females. Dietary restriction reduces gut pathology in aging females, and extends female lifespan more than male. By genetic sex reversal of a specific gut region, we induced female-like aging pathologies in males, associated with decreased lifespan, but also with a greater increase in longevity in response to dietary restriction."

We have uncovered a substantial sex difference in the pathology of the aging gut in <i>Drosophila</i>. The intestinal epithelium of the aging female undergoes major deterioration, driven by intestinal stem cell (ISC) division, while lower ISC activity in males associates with delay or absence of pathology, and better barrier function, even at old ages. Males succumb to intestinal challenges to which females are resistant, associated with fewer proliferating ISCs, suggesting a trade-off between highly active repair mechanisms and late-life pathology in females. Dietary restriction reduces gut pathology in aging females, and extends female lifespan more than male. By genetic sex reversal of a specific gut region, we induced female-like aging pathologies in males, associated with decreased lifespan, but also with a greater increase in longevity in response to dietary restriction."

Now, Regan et al. have looked in detail at the guts of male and female fruit flies as they age. This revealed that female guts deteriorate as the flies grow old because the stem cells in the gut divide more often and form small tumours. These stem cells help young females to grow and repair their guts, but start to turn against them as they age. In contrast, male guts stay well maintained and do not show the same signs of ageing."

However, males succumbed to oral bacterial infections to which females were resistant, with female guts containing a higher number of proliferating cells, suggesting a trade-off between gut plasticity and/or repair mechanisms, and old age pathology in females. Gut pathology in aging females\u00a0was ameliorated by DR, suggesting that the greater response of female lifespan to DR may be a consequence of improved gut function. Taking advantage of cell autonomous sex determination in <i>Drosophila</i>, we produced males that had a region of the midgut genetically feminized and we\u00a0found that this region alone showed the female pattern of aging-related pathology and increase in mitotic stem cells. Furthermore, these feminized males also showed a greater increase in lifespan in response to DR, comparable to that seen in females. Males demonstrated higher age-related, systemic inflammation compared to females, and sensitivity to oral bacterial infection, indicative of immune dysfunction, despite better maintenance of gut barrier function. Intriguingly, this points to further sex bias(es) in immunity that could contribute to male mortality."

This abnormality was progressive (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), and eventually led to tumor formation. The effect of this hyperplasia on the basal side of the PV epithelium was marked; cells were pulled away from the basal edge due to tumor formation or apoptosis, leading to the appearance of rosettes characteristic of epithelial wound healing (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C\u2019</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

Indeed, many males in the oldest cohorts examined (up to 64\u2009days post-eclosion) had well-maintained intestinal epithelia (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>).

This is striking given the maximum lifespan for males (final surviving 10% of the population) is 64\u2009days (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2D</a>). A recent study, describing the Smurf technique, found that the inbred laboratory strain <i>w<sup>1118</sup></i>\u2009does produce male smurfs, but at a lower rate than females (<a href=\"#bib47\">Rera et al., 2012</a>). We confirmed this, finding a small proportion of <i>w<sup>1118\u2009</sup></i>male smurfs (&lt;2%) at 42\u2009days (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>)."

The bacterium <i>Erwinia carotovora (Ecc)</i> induces antimicrobial peptide (AMP) expression and ISC division in the midgut when ingested (<a href=\"#bib5\">Basset et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Ayyaz et al., 2015</a>) but is not usually lethal to healthy adult females (<a href=\"#bib27\">Ha et al., 2005</a>). When we challenged aged females and males with oral infection by <i>Ecc</i>, we found that females were resistant to the infection. However, a high proportion of males succumbed after around 72\u00a0hr (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2O</a>). Upon analysis of the ISC response to <i>Ecc</i> infection, we found that infected female midguts had a significantly higher number of actively dividing (PH3+) cells at 18-hr post-infection compared to controls. Although male midguts also responded to infection, the overall number of mitotic cells was significantly lower than in infected females (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2P</a>). In addition, when we exposed flies to a xenobiotic agent in their food (DDT; <a href=\"#bib50\">Slack et al, 2011</a>), female flies were significantly more resistant to this challenge (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2E</a>). These findings suggest that, despite the patent hyperplastic pathology, older females are more resilient to intestinal challenge than are males. This sex bias may, in part, be promoted by higher numbers of dividing ISCs in females, despite this being detrimental to the maintenance of epithelial integrity at older ages."

We therefore assessed the systemic response to <i>Ecc</i> oral infection in aged males and females. <i>Diptericin</i> (<i>dipt</i>, an antimicrobial peptide [AMP] responsive to gram-negative infection sensed by the Imd pathway), was expressed at higher levels in unchallenged males compared to females, and was strongly upregulated upon infection in males (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2Q</a>). This high systemic <i>dipt</i> did not induce a high survival rate for males, many of which later succumbed to the infection, and may instead be indicative of an infection not effectively contained by the gut and/or a sepsis-like response. To better understand inflammatory status during aging in females and males, we measured expression of <i>dipt</i> during aging. Only males showed increased expression of <i>dipt</i> as they aged and, at both ages, males expressed <i>dipt</i> at a significantly higher level than did females (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2S</a>). We also analyzed expression of the ROS-producer <i>dual oxidase</i> (<i>duox</i>) at young and old ages. <i>Duox</i> is expressed in immune-active epithelia, especially the gut, and is necessary for survival to foodborne pathogens (<a href=\"#bib27\">Ha et al., 2005</a>). <i>Duox</i> levels did not change significantly during aging, but males had higher expression than did females at both ages (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2T</a>). This suggests that, even in the absence of acute infection, males suffer from a higher level of systemic inflammation than do females, despite better maintenance of gut barrier function."

A similar result was obtained for anaerobic load. (<b>L-N</b>) Pathologies in feminized males are responsive to diet and rapamycin treatment. Pathologies were binned into scaled categories and quantified, n\u226512 per condition. PV categories as described in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> legend (see <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a> for PV scoring). R2 and R4 categories were defined as follows: I = WT, single layer epithelium with low number of basal ISCs. II = sporadic pathology of small nuclei \u2018nests\u2019 without significant disruption to the epithelium; III = widespread pathology, majority of epithelium has several layers of nuclei; IV = widespread pathology plus clear tumor formation. Gut feminized males have significantly worse pathology than control males on both diets in R2 (OLR, low-yeast, z=-3.916, p=0.0000899; high-yeast z=-4.339, p=0.0000143) and R4 (low-yeast, z=-4.012, p=0.0000602; high-yeast z=-4.520, p=0.0000617). The incidence of severe pathology and tumors (cat IV) in R2 was greater in feminized males than control females on high yeast diet (p=0.04) but not low yeast diet (p=0.48), suggesting that there was a cost of feminization that was partly alleviated by DR (<b>L-M</b>). Rapamycin treatment decreased mitoses in females and feminized males at 16 days (n\u226510 guts per condition, students <i>t</i> test; control (<i>+/tra<sup>F</sup></i>) females, p=0.0079; control (<i>+/tra<sup>F</sup></i>) males, p=0.1; control females (<i>NP1/tra<sup>F</sup>),</i> p=0.22; feminized males (<i>NP1/tra<sup>F</sup>),</i> p=0.0001). (<b>N</b>) <b>O-R</b> Feminized males were more sensitive to oral infection, but acquired a lifespan response to dietary restriction.

Lifespan analysis of <i>NP1&gt;tra<sup>F</sup> </i>males and <i>+/NP1</i> control males and females on two yeast dilutions. <i>NP1&gt;tra<sup>F</sup></i> males were significantly shorter\u00a0lived than control males on both standard (low yeast; log rank, p=0.0023) and double (high yeast; log rank, p=2.06E-11) yeast dilutions, whereas <i>+/NP1</i> control males did not differ between food conditions (log rank, p=0.34). This is a representative lifespan of three with similar outcomes. Cox proportional hazards analysis of the lifespan demonstrated a significantly increased risk of dying on high-yeast vs low-yeast food overall (p=2 x 10\u201316), and a significant difference in the response to food between control male genotypes and <i>NP1&gt;tra<sup>F</sup></i> (gut feminized) males (p=0.0298).

Similar to females, feminized males on the high-yeast diet appeared to show a more severe pathology at 35\u2009days than did those on low yeast (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3L\u2013M</a>). In line with this, when we analyzed the rate of tumor formation (category IV) in a specific region of the gut (R2), we found that DR significantly decreased the risk of tumor formation in feminized males (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2L</a>). The observed pathologies demonstrate that female and feminized ISCs respond to DR, however, when we quantified PH3+ cell number in 35\u2009day-old guts, although female high-yeast guts had more mitoses, this difference was not significant in feminized males (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). One possible explanation is that the observed pathology is an accumulation of ISC activity, which could expose subtle differences in mitotic rate over a lifetime. Another possibility is that ISC division and pathology are linked but pathology is driven by other factors that are responsive to diet, such as changes to the microbiota (<a href=\"#bib20\">Clark et al., 2015</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib42\">Petkau et al., 2014</a>). The TOR pathway inhibitor rapamycin extends lifespan in females, and to a much lesser extent in males (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bjedov et al., 2010</a>), and a recent study showed that it decreases ISC division and slows barrier dysfunction in females (<a href=\"#bib22\">Fan et al., 2015</a>). When we treated males, females and feminized males with rapamycin, we found that ISC proliferation and gut pathology were reduced in females and feminized males (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3N</a>). This shows that, similarly to DR, females derive a greater benefit from rapamycin than do males, possibly explaining, at least in part, the sex bias in the magnitude of lifespan extension by the drug."

At 5-days post-infection, 7-day-old females and males survived, but approximately 50% of gut-feminized males had died (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2D</a>). Analysis of ISCs post-infection showed that feminized males induced significantly higher proliferation than control males, but this was clearly not protective (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3P</a>). In aged (42\u2009day-old) flies, as before, we found that only males succumbed to <i>Ecc</i> oral infection. Feminized males were most susceptible, dying more quickly than did control males (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3O</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2E</a>), and this was not related to\u00a0a change in feeding on either normal food (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2F</a>) or the infection pellet (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2G</a>). At this age, female guts had a high number of mitoses, but these did not significantly increase on infection, and nor did they in feminized males (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3P</a>). One interpretation of this result is that, in aged females and feminized males, the pool of ISCs has been exhausted by continued mitotic activity through the lifespan, or that\u00a0due to age-related triggers such as inflammation or dysbiosis, ISC activity is already at a maximum. Markedly different to females, however, was the high induction of systemic <i>dipt</i> in control and feminized males (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3Q</a>), in line with their reduced survival. Altogether, these data show that age-related sensitivity of males to intestinal infection was not rescued by feminization of the midgut. One probable contributing factor to the high death rate of feminized males is the barrier dysfunction observed at 42\u2009days (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H</a>). However, their sensitivity to <i>Ecc</i> at young ages points to other, compromised immune responses. We hypothesize that a sex mis-match between the gut and other immune tissues such as the fat body and hemocytes, may be detrimental."

Interestingly, when we measured the responses of lifespan to two different yeast dilutions, we found that midgut-feminized males had acquired a response to DR similar in magnitude to that seen in control females (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3R</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2H</a> and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 1</a>).

Female intestinal pathology is driven by stem cell activity (<a href=\"#bib41\">Patel et al., 2015</a>), which is responsive to diet (<a href=\"#bib18\">Choi et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">O\u2019Brien et al., 2011</a>). Gut hyperplasia is limiting for female lifespan: when ISC division is genetically reduced, female lifespan is extended (<a href=\"#bib7\">Biteau et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Hur et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Rera et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Ulgherait et al., 2014</a>). We showed that, by switching the sexual identity of male midgut cells, ISC activity was increased, pathologies appeared and lifespan was shortened. In addition, the lifespan of males with feminized guts became responsive to diet, with DR both reducing the risk for developing severe pathology and increasing lifespan. The marked sexual dimorphism in gut pathology during aging provides a potential explanation for why males do not increase lifespan as much as do females in response to DR. Because males do not suffer from age-related hyperplasia, they do not derive the same benefit from DR-induced stem cell quiescence. Limited hyperplasia could also at least partly explain the much greater increase in lifespan seen in females than in males upon reduced IIS (<a href=\"#bib19\">Clancy et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Tatar et al., 2001</a>); given that ISC activity in females is responsive to insulin signaling (<a href=\"#bib7\">Biteau et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">O\u2019Brien et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Hur et al., 2013</a>)."

We showed that sustained ISC division has drastic consequences for the female gut epithelium, causing scars and holes to appear on the basal side. Interestingly, in transcriptomic analysis of aging guts of flies raised in both natural and axenic conditions, genes involved in wound healing were increased during aging (<a href=\"#bib26\">Guo et al., 2014</a>). In line with the absence of severe pathology in males, barrier function was maintained into old age. Despite this, males succumbed to oral infection and xenobiotic stress to which females were resistant, and this sensitivity was not rescued by feminization. We found that the gut ISC response to infection, a repair process, was significantly lower in male flies and increased in feminized males. Regulation of ISC activity is therefore not the only difference between males and females affecting resistance: other epithelial immune responses such as ROS and antimicrobial peptide production or tolerance to <i>Ecc</i>-derived toxins could also be sexually dimorphic (<a href=\"#bib57\">Vincent and Sharp, 2014</a>). The male sensitivity and sepsis-like response to <i>Ecc</i> oral infection, age-related systemic inflammation and high levels of ROS production shown in this study are striking and present a starting point for the analysis of sex differences in intestinal immunity, which will be relevant for resistance to opportunistic infection and shaping the microbiome."

Male reproduction does not require the same amount of nutritional input and, therefore, large-scale intestinal remodeling would probably not increase reproductive rate, which is promoted instead by increased detection and courtship of females (<a href=\"#bib10\">Bretman et al., 2011</a>). This sex difference is evolutionarily conserved, in that female mammals extensively grow and remodel their guts, increasing digestive and absorptive capacity in accordance with the increased nutritional demands of lactation (<a href=\"#bib28\">Hammond et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Speakman et al., 2008</a>). Possibly related to this greater gut plasticity, women have higher rates of region-specific colon cancer than do men (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kim et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Jemal et al., 2011</a>), although the mechanisms underlying this difference are not well understood. Female-specific intestinal remodeling during reproduction could be a driving factor. Intriguingly, higher parity and earlier childbearing are protective against colon cancer, whereas later child-bearing is a significant risk factor (<a href=\"#bib59\">Wernli et al., 2009</a>), suggesting that the timing of reproductive events may affect\u00a0ISC (mis-)regulation. Further studies linking early gut plasticity, nutrition and fecundity with severity of hyperplastic pathology during aging in <i>Drosophila</i> may help elucidate conserved mechanisms underlying sex differences in cancer rates."

Using the fruit fly <i>Drosophila</i> melanogaster, Regan and colleagues correlate certain aspects of gut plasticity to fly aging in males vs. females. Increased intestinal stem cell division found in females is correlated with shorter lifespan compared to the division rate in males. By converting male intestines to a female state, the authors can shorten male lifespan and change the response to dietary restriction."

Sex specific differences in fly lifespan have been reported, yet a causal mechanism has been elusive. Here, the authors have investigated gut \"function\" during aging and find that female guts tend to attempt repair and proliferation more than male guts. While females are more resistant to toxins ingested (such as <i>Erwinia carotovora</i> infection), their guts deteriorate faster. Accordingly, diet restriction appears to preserve gut function in aged female flies. In male flies, feminizing parts of the intestine creates dysplasia and now makes the males responsive to DR, albeit the transgenic males are already short-lived."

Several studies have reported that the presence of gut-associated microbes contributes to 'gut pathology' in female flies. More specifically, axenic female flies show reduced 'gut pathology' with age (Broderick et al., 2014, Buchon et al., 2009, Guo et al., 2014; Clark et al. 2015). This is, of course, what the authors claim to observe in the aging intestines of male flies. It would, therefore, be interesting to find out whether male flies show an age-related increase in bacterial load and/or microbial imbalance (dysbiosis) in the strains used in this study. If they do not, this may contribute to the delayed intestinal degeneration observed. I am not suggesting that this needs to be figured out in detail in the current manuscript. But, it is certainly worth investigating and could, potentially, provide insight. It would also be interesting and strengthen the claims if the authors could show that feminized male guts show alterations in the microbiota."

We have analysed internal bacterial load during ageing, and also the proportions of aerobic and anaerobic species, in males, females and feminized males. We found a higher bacterial load in females than in males at all ages examined. This correlates with the lower incidence (or lack of) of barrier dysfunction observed in <i>w<sup>Dah</sup></i>males in this study. Strikingly, gut-feminized males had an increased load compared to both males and females. Internal bacterial load can thus be changed by feminization of gut tissue. In line with recent studies on females (Rera 2012, Guo 2014, Broderick 2014, Clark 2015) this increased bacterial load correlated with a high level of barrier dysfunction and systemic AMP expression in feminized males. This is now discussed in the manuscript. We also analyzed the proportions of aerobic and anaerobic species, an indication of the proportions of the two major genera (<i>Acetobacter</i> and <i>Lactobacilli</i>,), in 18 d and 40 d flies. We did not find significant differences in proportions either with ageing, or when comparing males, females and feminized males. A recent study by Clark et al. from the Walker lab demonstrated that changes in lower-abundance species, elucidated by deep sequencing of the microbiome, are important for age-related changes to the intestinal tissue in females. Our more general analysis will have missed subtle changes that could nevertheless have a significant impact on gut homeostasis. We have chosen not to present these data in the manuscript because we think that a much more detailed analysis would be required to draw any firm conclusions on sex differences in the composition of the microbiota and their potential impact."

Given that the only sex reversal in these males is to a specific gut region, it must be ultimately responsible for the other phenotypes seen in these flies. To test whether the feminization results in a full, female-like, response of lifespan to DR we have performed Cox Proportional Hazard statistical analyses on three repeat measurements of the lifespans of gut-feminized males. This anlaysis showed that gut feminized males derived the same degree of lifespan extension as that seen in females.

Like DR, rapamycin extends lifespan in both males and females, but to a greater extent in females (Bjedov 2010). We find that epithelial pathology is delayed in rapamycin-treated females and, in addition, females have lower numbers of ISCs after treatment, in line with a recent study on rapamycin treatment and gut ageing (Fan 2015). Males do not derive an obvious change in gut maintenance or ISC proliferation with rapamycin treatment. Although we did not have time to analyse the lifespan of gut-feminized males on rapamycin, we have qualitatively analyzed gut pathology and quantified stem cell activity in these flies. Strikingly, ISC division is significantly reduced in females and feminized males, but not in males, after 2 weeks of rapamycin treatment. These new data show that, under another lifespan extending treatment (rapamycin) where males and females have a differential longevity response, the effect on gut maintenance is greater in females, who show a greater decline, and that this pathology is rescued in feminized males by the treatment. This further supports the idea that rescue of gut maintenance is a driver for extended lifespan in females and gut-feminized males."

We have subjected gut-feminized males to <i>Ecc</i> oral infection at young (7 d) and old (42 d) ages, and analysed survival and the ISC response. In young flies, only feminized males were sensitive to the infection. Females, males and feminized males all significantly increased mitoses after infection, but females had a far higher number of active ISCs per se. ISCs in feminized males proliferated more than in control males, but this was clearly not protective against the infection. In aged flies, in line with our data comparing males and females, only males died from <i>Ecc</i> infection. Feminized males were again the most susceptible to oral infection, dying sooner than both control male genotypes. Infected males had significantly more mitoses than sham infected individuals. Females, however, had a high number of mitoses, which did not increase significantly on infection. Similarly, feminized males did not increase ISC proliferation upon infection. One interpretation of this result is that in aged females and feminized males, the pool of ISCs has been exhausted by continued mitotic activity through the lifespan. Another is that, due to age-related triggers of stem cell activity such as inflammation or dysbiosis, stem cell activity is already at a maximum. These data show that age-related sensitivity of males to intestinal infection is not rescued by feminization of the midgut. One probable contributing factor to the high death rate of feminized males is their increased barrier dysfunction at old age (see below). However, their sensitivity to <i>Ecc</i> at 7 d points to other compromised immune responses. One possibility is that a sex mis-match between the gut and other tissues involved in the immune response to oral infection is detrimental."

Females are resistant to <i>Ecc</i> infection at young and old ages, induce a high level of ISC proliferation in response to infection (although this is overlaid on a high basal level of activity in old guts), but do not induce a significant systemic AMP response, perhaps suggesting that they have effectively dealt with the infection at the level of the gut. Males increase ISC proliferation, but nevertheless succumb to oral infection at older ages, with a high and variable systemic induction of <i>diptericin.</i> Feminized males induce ISC proliferation to a similar level as females, but induce high systemic AMPs like males, and the infection is fatal."

ISC-driven repair has been demonstrated to be required for survival to oral infection in females (Buchon 2009, Chatterjee 2009), however, several other parameters will affect male and female ability to resist infection, including; barrier function at the time of bacterial ingestion, specific bacterial and viral load, basal and induced AMP and <i>Duox</i> release and tolerance mechanisms."

We agree that this is counter-intuitive, and suggest that a leaky gut barrier is not a driver of mortality in the context of <i>Ecc</i> infection in females (although it may well be important in the face of more virulent infections, or in the interaction of the ageing fly with its microbiota)."

To address this, we have compared ISC activity over ageing in our two control lines, and find no difference between them (this is now presented in the manuscript)."

We have shown that the males and females differ in the pathology of the ageing gut, at least partly driven by sex-biased stem cell activity, and female intestinal decline can be recapitulated in the male gut by tissue-autonomous sex-switching. Lessening of this pathology extends lifespan in females but it may not be a significant driver of male mortality. Feminization of gut cells increases bacterial load, induces gut pathology, shortens male lifespan and induces plasticity to DR, but does not make males more robust to intestinal infection. Aged males succumb to an oral infection that females are resistant to, and induce high levels of inflammatory AMPs and ROS over ageing, raising the intriguing possibility that other sex-biased immune processes are important for male mortality."
