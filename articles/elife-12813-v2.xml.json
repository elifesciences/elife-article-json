G2019S, the most common amino acid substitution activates the kinase two- to threefold. This has motivated the development of LRRK2 kinase inhibitors; however, poor consensus on physiological LRRK2 substrates has hampered clinical development of such therapeutics. We employ a combination of phosphoproteomics, genetics, and pharmacology to unambiguously identify a subset of Rab GTPases as key LRRK2 substrates. LRRK2 directly phosphorylates these both in vivo and in vitro on an evolutionary conserved residue in the switch II domain. Pathogenic LRRK2 variants mapping to different functional domains increase phosphorylation of Rabs and this strongly decreases their affinity to regulatory proteins including Rab GDP dissociation inhibitors (GDIs). Our findings uncover a key class of bona-fide LRRK2 substrates and a novel regulatory mechanism of Rabs that connects them to PD."

G2019S, the most common amino acid substitution activates the kinase two- to threefold. This has motivated the development of LRRK2 kinase inhibitors; however, poor consensus on physiological LRRK2 substrates has hampered clinical development of such therapeutics. We employ a combination of phosphoproteomics, genetics, and pharmacology to unambiguously identify a subset of Rab GTPases as key LRRK2 substrates. LRRK2 directly phosphorylates these both in vivo and in vitro on an evolutionary conserved residue in the switch II domain. Pathogenic LRRK2 variants mapping to different functional domains increase phosphorylation of Rabs and this strongly decreases their affinity to regulatory proteins including Rab GDP dissociation inhibitors (GDIs). Our findings uncover a key class of bona-fide LRRK2 substrates and a novel regulatory mechanism of Rabs that connects them to PD."

Environmental and genetic factors contribute to the development of the disease, but its precise etiology still remains elusive (<a href=\"#bib4\">Burbulla and Kr\u00fcger, 2011</a>). Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have related 28 genetic risk variants at 24 loci with nonfamilial PD (<a href=\"#bib49\">Nalls et al., 2014</a>). Among those, mutations in LRRK2 (Park8) are also found in hereditary forms, pinpointing a shared molecular pathway driving pathogenesis in both familial and non-familial PD and comprising the most common cause of the disease (<a href=\"#bib71\">Sim\u00f3n-S\u00e1nchez et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Satake et al., 2009</a>). LRRK2 encodes a large protein composed of central kinase and GTPase (ROC-COR) domains that are surrounded by multiple protein-protein interaction regions. PD pathogenic LRRK2 mutations map predominantly to the kinase (G2019S, I2020T) and the ROC-COR domains (R1441C/G/H, Y1699C), implying that these enzymatic activities are crucial for pathogenesis (<a href=\"#bib63\">Rudenko and Cookson, 2014</a>). Presently, it is unclear how LRRK2 mutations occurring in different functional domains all predispose to PD. The most common PD-associated LRRK2 mutation is the G2019S amino acid substitution, which activates the kinase two- to threefold (<a href=\"#bib76\">West et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Khan, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Jaleel et al., 2007</a>). Since protein kinases are attractive pharmacological targets, this finding has raised hopes that selective LRRK2 inhibition can prevent or delay the onset of PD (<a href=\"#bib81\">Yao et al., 2013</a>)."

Moreover, several LRRK2 substrates have been reported previously; however, evidence that they are phosphorylated by LRRK2 in a physiological context is generally lacking and proofs are confined to in\u00a0vitro approaches or to cellular systems using overexpressed kinase (<a href=\"#bib33\">Jaleel et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Kumar et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Ohta et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Kawakami et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Bailey et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Martin et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Qing et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Chen et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Gloeckner et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Imai et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Gillardon, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Kanao et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Matta et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Xiong et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Yun et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Yun et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Krumova et al., 2015</a>).

Among the five genes within this locus is Rab7L1 (also known as Rab29), which together with LRRK2 increases nonfamilial PD risk. Depletion of Rab7L1 recapitulates the dopaminergic neuron loss observed with LRRK2-G2019S expression and its overexpression rescues mutant LRRK2 phenotypes (<a href=\"#bib43\">MacLeod et al., 2013</a>). Rab GTPases comprise ~70 family members in humans, and they are key players in all forms of intracellular vesicular trafficking events (<a href=\"#bib72\">Stenmark, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Rivero-R\u00edos et al., 2015</a>). Apart from Rab7L1, several other family members have been associated with PD pathogenesis. For example, mutations in Rab39b (Park21 locus) predispose to PD in humans (<a href=\"#bib79\">Wilson et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Mata et al., 2015</a>). Moreover, overexpression of Rab8a, Rab1, and Rab3a attenuate \u03b1-synclein-induced cytotoxicity in cellular and animal models of PD, suggesting a functional interplay between Rab GTPases and known PD factors (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cooper, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Gitler et al., 2008</a>). Recently, another PD-connected protein kinase termed PTEN-Induce Kinase-1 (PINK1) has been reported to indirectly control the phosphorylation of a small group of Rabs including Rab8a at Ser111 (<a href=\"#bib39\">Lai et al., 2015</a>).\u00a0Despite these intriguing links, it is presently unclear whether LRRK2 directly or indirectly modulates Rab GTPases at the molecular level and if so, by which mechanism."

LRRK2 phosphorylates these substrates on an evolutionarily conserved residue situated in their switch II domain both in human and murine cells and in mouse brain. The phosphorylation of Rabs by LRRK2 is direct and strikingly all LRRK2 missense mutations that contribute to PD pathogenesis increase the phosphorylation of at least three Rab GTPases. Further, we establish that different PD pathogenic mutations modulate the interaction with a number of regulatory proteins including guanine dissociation inhibitors (GDI1/2). In this way, LRRK2 regulates the specific insertion of Rab GTPases into target membranes thereby altering their membrane-cytosol equilibrium."

For our first screen (PS1), we generated a mouse model harboring the LRRK2-G2019S substitution that increases kinase activity two- to threefold (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). We derived fibroblasts from these animals and treated them with two structurally different LRRK2 inhibitors, GSK2578215A (<a href=\"#bib60\">Reith et al., 2012</a>) or HG-10-102-01 (<a href=\"#bib8\">Choi et al., 2012</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). This screening modality offers three major advantages; first, increased activity of the G2019S-LRRK2 kinase amplifies the chance of finding bona-fide substrates, second, using an isogenic system excludes that measured phosphoproteome changes are due to differences in the genetic background and third, considering only the overlapping population of significantly modulated phosphopeptides of two structurally distinct inhibitors constitutes a very stringent criterion for specifically pinpointing LRRK2 substrates."

                                "text": "Rab10 belongs to the Ras family of small GTPases that regulate intracellular vesicular transport, with ~70 members in human. They function as molecular switches in the tethering, docking, fusion, and motion of intracellular membranes (<a href=\"#bib72\">Stenmark, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Wandinger-Ness and Zerial, 2014</a>). The T73 residue of Rab10 is located in the switch II domain, which is characteristic of Rab GTPases (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). This region changes conformation upon nucleotide binding and regulates the interaction with multiple regulatory proteins (<a href=\"#bib56\">Pfeffer, 2005</a>). Sequence alignment revealed that the equivalent site to T73-Rab10 is highly conserved in more than 40 human Rab-family members, indicating strong functional relevance (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Moreover, superposing the crystal structures of multiple Rab GTPases localizes the equivalent residues to T73-Rab10 in nearly the same position (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). To investigate whether the phosphorylation of Rab10 by LRRK2 is direct, we performed an in\u00a0vitro kinase assay using recombinant components. Notably, we found that both wt and LRRK2-G2019S, but neither kinase inactive D1994A mutant nor small molecule-inhibited LRRK2, efficiently phosphorylated Rab10, proving a direct kinase-substrate relationship (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Furthermore, incubation of Rab10 with LRRK2 followed by tryptic digestion and MS analysis unambiguously identified T73 as the major phosphorylation site (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Given the high conservation of T73-Rab10, we investigated whether other Rab GTPases were also phosphorylated by LRRK2 in\u00a0vitro. Therefore, we first measured LRRK2-mediated phosphorylation of Rab8a, Rab1a, and Rab1b, all of which contain a Thr at the site equivalent to T73-Rab10, by MS or <sup>32</sup>P incorporation followed by Edman sequencing. Remarkably, all proteins were rapidly phosphorylated on the predicted LRRK2 phosphorylation site in the switch II domain (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D\u2013F</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C\u2013E</a>). Next, we compared Rab family members containing Thr sites in the switch II region with those containing a Ser in the equivalent position. Interestingly, while Rabs with threonines (Rab1b, Rab8a, and Rab10) were efficiently phosphorylated, those with the equivalent serine sites (Rab5b, Rab7a, Rab7L1, Rab12, and Rab39b) were phosphorylated to a drastically lower extent (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>). This confirms the previously reported in\u00a0vitro preference for threonines by LRRK2 (<a href=\"#bib50\">Nichols et al., 2009</a>). Finally, we performed a side by side comparison of the phosphorylation efficiencies of recombinant Rab8a and Rab7L1 against two previously reported substrates, moesin (Msn) and Rps15 (<a href=\"#bib33\">Jaleel et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Martin et al., 2014</a>). Msn is a cytoskeletal protein and a well-known in\u00a0vitro LRRK2 substrate, whereas Rps15 is part of the 40S ribosomal subunit and its phosphorylation on Thr136 has been reported to regulate protein translation in <i>D. melanogaster</i> (<a href=\"#bib45\">Martin et al., 2014</a>). In accordance with our previous observations (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>), phosphorylation levels of RAB7L1 were barely detectable, and even lower than those of Msn and Rps15. Strikingly, levels of pRab8a were about ten times higher as compared to Rps15 and Msn, two of the best in\u00a0vitro LRRK2 substrates known to date, demonstrating that Rabs with Thr sites in the switch II domain are primary LRRK2 targets (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H,I</a>)."

This turned out not to be the case as pS72-Rab7a was not regulated in either of our screens. LRRK2 thus phosphorylates only a subset of Rab GTPases in mouse fibroblasts. Surprisingly, we noticed that pS105-Rab12, which is not phosphorylated by LRRK2 in\u00a0vitro (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>), was among the significantly\u00a0modulated sites in PS1 and also downregulated upon MLI-2 treatment in wt cells as compared to the inhibitor-resistant A2016T mutant in PS2 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>). However, because of elevated intergroup variability and stringent FDR cut-offs, it was not selected in our first analysis. LRRK2 is found also in lower eukaryotes such as <i>C. elegans</i> and <i>D. melanogaster</i> (<a href=\"#bib42\">Liu et al., 2011</a>) and T73-Rab10 is conserved in these organisms as well. Also, S105-Rab12 is present throughout the vertebrates (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>).

This in turn triggers retention of Rab effector proteins that mediate downstream vesicular trafficking events. Rabin8 binds to the switch II domain of Rab8a and contacts the conserved, phosphorylatable T72 residue (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib26\">Guo et al., 2013</a>). We found that compared to wt, the T72E phosphomimetic substitution decreased the level of Rabin8-catalyzed mant-GDP displacement from a Rab8-GDP complex (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2B\u2013D</a>). To further substantiate this finding, we phosphorylated purified Rab8a using LRRK2, which resulted in ~60% of T72-phosphorylated protein as determined by total protein MS and LC-MS/MS after tryptic digestion (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2E,F</a>). Further enrichment by ion-exchange chromatography yielded a highly enriched (~100%) fraction of pT72-Rab8a (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2E</a>). Loading of non-phosphorylated and phosphorylated Rab8a with mant-GDP following incubation with Rabin8 revealed that LRRK2-induced phosphorylation of T72-Rab8a inhibits rates of Rabin8-catalyzed GDP exchange fourfold and decreases Rab8a-Rabin8 interaction (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figures 5D</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2G</a>). Both \u03bb-phosphatase treatment of LRRK2-phosphorylated Rab8a and pharmacological inhibition of LRRK2 prevented the decreased GEF activity of Rabin8 toward pT72-Rab8a (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2H</a>).

GDIs extract inactive, prenylated Rabs from membranes and bind them with high affinity in the cytosol (<a href=\"#bib57\">Pylypenko et al., 2003</a>). The regulatory mechanism by which Rabs are displaced from GDIs to facilitate their insertion into specific target membranes is unknown. The co-crystal structure of GDI1 with the yeast Rab homologue Ypt1 shows that GDIs closely contact the switch II region (<a href=\"#bib59\">Rak, 2003</a>), which explains why phosphorylation in this domain interferes with the Rab-GDI interaction. Since GDIs are not specific to one Rab isoform (<a href=\"#bib68\">Seabra and Wasmeier, 2004</a>), we reasoned that phosphorylation of the switch II domain could be a general mechanism of Rab-GDI dissociation. We therefore substituted S106-Rab12 and T73-Rab10 with non-phosphorylatable Ala or phosphomimetic Glu residues and tested their capacity to form complexes with GDIs by immunoprecipitation followed by MS or western blotting. As compared to non-phosphorylatable Rab10 and Rab12, neither S106E-Rab12 nor T73E-Rab10 was able to bind GDIs, demonstrating the functional importance of these residues (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>)."

Strikingly, the level of Rab8a-GDI interaction closely correlated with the degree of T72-Rab8a phosphorylation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C,D</a>). Similarly, LRRK2-mediated phosphorylation of S106-Rab12 diminished the interaction with GDIs, confirming that the effect is not specific to one Rab isoform (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E,F</a>). All tested LRRK2 pathogenic mutations that affect kinase activity thus control the interaction of Rabs with GDIs. Finally, to directly test whether disruption of the Rab-GDI interaction results in an altered subcellular distribution of Rabs, we quantitatively determined T72A-Rab8 and T72E-Rab8 protein abundances in SILAC (<a href=\"#bib54\">Ong, 2002</a>) labeled HEK293 cells. This revealed a twofold increase of non-phosphorylatable T72A mutant in the cytosol. Consistently, we detected a significant (p= 2.58*10<sup>-3</sup>) increase of T72E-Rab8 protein levels in the membrane fraction, demonstrating that interference with the Rab-GDI interaction results in an unbalanced membrane-cytosol distribution of Rabs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G,H</a>)."

Starting with almost 30,000 identified phosphosites, our screens rapidly narrowed down the candidates to a small number that were consistently and strongly regulated with all tested compounds and genetic models. Only the known phosphorylation site pS935 on LRRK2 itself and a specific residue in the Rab10 GTPase (T73) fulfilled our most specific criteria. LRRK2 kinase is conserved also in flies and worms and this is true of the T73-Rab10 substrate site as well. Further experiments with diverse model systems and techniques all verified the T73-Rab10 site as well as the equivalent sites on many but not all other Rab family members. These include the threonine sites on Rab8a and Rab3a (T72 and T86, respectively), as well as S106-Rab12. Rab7a is an important component of the endocytic pathway (<a href=\"#bib75\">Wandinger-Ness and Zerial, 2014</a>) and phosphorylation on S72 has recently been shown to play a functional role in B-cell signaling (<a href=\"#bib65\">Satpathy et al., 2015</a>). While our data clearly show that this site is not regulated by LRRK2 in mouse fibroblasts, its regulation by LRRK2 in B cells remains possible, given the high expression levels of LRRK2 in those cell types (<a href=\"#bib22\">Gardet et al., 2010</a>). In\u00a0vitro experiments proved that LRRK2 directly phosphorylates Thr but not the Ser sites in Rab isoforms, in line with its well-established in\u00a0vitro preference (<a href=\"#bib33\">Jaleel et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Martin et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Nichols et al., 2009</a>). We found that Ser sites on Rabs were hardly phosphorylated in\u00a0vitro but S105-Rab12 (S106 in human) was clearly regulated in cells and brain tissue, establishing that accessory factors are required in this case. Consistent with this finding, the major characterized in\u00a0vivo LRRK2 autophosphorylation site is a Ser residue (Ser1292) (<a href=\"#bib70\">Sheng et al., 2012</a>). Our observation of residual Thr72-Rab8 phosphorylation in LRRK2<sup>-/-</sup> mice implies that one or more other kinase(s) are able to act upon this residue."

However, these were validated by only one of the screens, their regulation was weaker and for many of them regulation may reflect indirect modulation by the LRRK2 kinase. This is likely to account for the difficulty in identifying substrates of this kinase. In a direct comparison of threonine Rab phosphorylation it was much stronger than the known in\u00a0vitro LRRK2 targets we tested. Overall, the relatively small number of regulated sites in our screens, suggest that LRRK2 is a very specific or low activity kinase. LRRK2 is ubiquitously expressed, but highly abundant in the\u00a0kidney, lungs, pancreas, and certain cell types of the immune system (<a href=\"#bib67\">Schapansky et al., 2015</a>). Therefore, it is possible that different LRRK2 substrates, including Rab isoforms, are phosphorylated in a cell- or tissue-specific manner. Further phosphoproteomic research should shed more light on this open question. We conclude that the threonine sites on Rab family members identified here may not be the only functional ones in the context of LRRK2, but that they are the most prominent ones."

Results from nucleotide affinity measurements make the former mechanism unlikely but AP-MS established phosphorylation-dependent binding of several proteins involved in regulating their cycling between cytosol and membrane compartments. This indicates that direct phosphorylation of Rabs on a conserved residue situated in the switch II domain regulates their movement by controlling the interaction with numerous regulatory proteins. The affinities of GDIs for Rabs are vastly decreased in a manner correlating with the phosphorylation levels induced by different LRRK2 pathogenic variants. Our data thus establish that LRRK2 is an important regulator of Rab homeostasis which is likely contributing to PD development (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). Overactive LRRK2, which results in increased Rab phosphorylation, promotes dissociation from GDIs in the cytosol with concomitant membrane insertion (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). In this way, the relative pool of membrane bound and cytosolic Rab is altered, disturbing intracellular trafficking. In particular, PD-associated LRRK2 mutations would shift the membrane-cytosol balance of Rabs toward the membrane compartment, thereby causing accumulation of inactive Rabs in the membranes (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). The subtle increase in Rab phosphorylation in cells derived from LRRK2-G2019S knock-in mice is consistent with the long time needed for PD to manifest in humans."

Geranyl-geranyl-modified Rab GTPases in their GDP-bound state are tightly bound by guanine dissociation inhibitors (GDIs) in the cytosol. LRRK2 aids the insertion of Rabs in their specific target membrane. After removal of the LRRK2 phosphorylation site, guanine exchange factors (GEFs) facilitate exchange of GDP to GTP. This in turn allows binding to effector proteins and membrane trafficking events. Next, a Rab-specific GTPase-activating protein (GAP) assists in the hydrolysis of GTP followed by removal of the Rab GTPase from the target membrane by GDIs. (<b>B</b>) In pathogenic conditions, in which LRRK2 is hyperactive, RabGTPases have strongly diminished affinities for GDIs.

The resulting animals were crossed to C57BL/6NJ inbred mice (JAX stock No. 005304) for one generation.

                    "text": "Mutations in the LRRK2 kinase have been identified as main contributors to genetically caused Parkinson's disease. Despite extensive research on this kinase its physiological substrates remained elusive. In this paper, Steger and colleagues identify Rab GTPases (Rab10, Rab8, Rab3, Rab12) as new LRRK2 substrates. By making use of mouse and human cell lines, specific LRRK2 inhibitors, LRRK2 disease mutations and a powerful combination of Mass spectrometry and biochemistry, the authors are able to show that LRRK2 phosphorylates Rab GTPases in vitro and in vivo at their conserved switch 2 domain. This phosphorylation event decreases the binding affinity of Rabs towards GDIs and control their membrane insertion. Next, the authors examined whether phosphorylation of LRRK2 target RABs affect their binding properties. Thereto, the authors compared interactomes of RAB8A LRRK2-phosphomimicking and -ablating mutants and revealed preferential binding of a number of RAB8A-interacting proteins (e.g. the RAB8 GEF Rabin8 or the GDP dissociation inhibitors GDI1 and GDI2) bound to the phosphorylation deficient variant. The authors carried on to demonstrate that LRRK2-mediated phosphorylation of RAB8A reduced the GEF activity of Rabin8 towards RAB8A. Finally, the authors extended their finding on loss of GDI1/2 binding upon LRRK2 phosphorylation to RAB10 and RAB12. LRRK2-induced phosphorylation of T72-Rab8a inhibits rates of Rabin8-catalyzed GDP exchange 4-fold and decreases RAB8a-Rabin8 interaction. In addition, the authors used a panel of pathogenic LRRK2 mutants to demonstrate correlation between LRRK2-mediated RAB8A or RAB12 phosphorylation and GDI1/2 binding. PD-associated LRRK2 mutations would shift the membrane-cytosol balance of Rabs towards the membrane compartment, thereby causing accumulation of inactive Rabs in the membranes. All of the presented experiments are well designed, statistically analyzed and all of the important findings are backed up with extensive supporting material. Collectively, this work represents an elegant tour-de-force from proteomics phospho site mapping to mechanistic dissection of the functional consequence of LRRK2 target phosphorylation."

Initially, we identify T73-Rab10 and S105-Rab12 as physiological LRRK2 phosphorylation sites (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3A-D</a>). T72-Rab8 was not identified in our initial MS screen \u2013 probably because of its low abundance \u2013 but a more directed analysis revealed that T72-Rab8 is clearly a LRRK2 target. This is revealed by our experiments in three different systems (HEK293 GFP-LRRK2 flpIn cells, MEFs and mouse brain) where endogenously expressed Rab8 is subjected to phosphorylation by LRRK2 (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2E</a>). In particular, we demonstrate (by immunoprecipitation of Rab8 from mouse embryonic fibroblasts and subsequent MS analysis) that endogenous levels of T72-Rab8 vary dependent on the activity of LRRK2. pT72-Rab8 levels are higher in G2019S cells as compared to wt (about three-fold) and even lower in LRRK2 knockout cells (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2F</a>). Furthermore, by measuring the brain phosphoproteomes of LRRK2-G2019S mice, injected with either vehicle or MLI-2, we find that pT72-Rab8 is downregulated when LRRK2 is inhibited (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>)."

However, in the paper, we also show that increased phosphorylation of Rab8a by PD pathogenic LRRK2 variants trigger T72 hyperphosphorylation and, importantly, that this strongly diminishes its capacity to bind GDIs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C,D</a>). Thus, the combination of phosphomimetic and activated kinase experiment, which both show the same outcome, makes it extremely unlikely that abrogation of binding is due to an artefactual structure change in the mutant protein."

To prove that compromising the binding capacities of Rabs to GDIs causes a shift in the equilibrium between membrane-bound and cytosolic Rabs, we have now performed subcellular fractionation experiments. For this we mixed SILAC labeled cells expressing Rab8a-T72A or Rab8a-T72E in a 1:1 ratio before fractionation, minimizing variation due to sample preparation. After fractionation, we measured Rab8a protein abundances in both the cytosolic and the membrane fraction by mass spectrometry. This revealed that the pool of T72E mutant protein (which is compromised in GDI binding) is increased in the membrane fraction as compared to T72A. Importantly, at the same time, the fraction of T72E mutant in the cytosol was significantly reduced. Thus inhibiting the binding of GDIs to Rabs changes the membrane/cytosol distribution, directly validating our model. These results are shown in the new <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G,H</a> and described in the Results and Materials and methods."
