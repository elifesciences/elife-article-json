Through systematic proteomic analysis of human MICOS, we identified QIL1 (C19orf70) as a novel conserved MICOS subunit. QIL1 depletion disrupted CJ structure in cultured human cells and in <i>Drosophila</i> muscle and neuronal cells in vivo. In human cells, mitochondrial disruption correlated with impaired respiration. Moreover, increased mitochondrial fragmentation was observed upon QIL1 depletion in flies. Using quantitative proteomics, we show that loss of QIL1 resulted in MICOS disassembly with the accumulation of a MIC60-MIC19-MIC25 sub-complex and degradation of MIC10, MIC26, and MIC27. Additionally, we demonstrated that in QIL1-depleted cells, overexpressed MIC10 fails to significantly restore its interaction with other MICOS subunits and SAMM50. Collectively, our work uncovers a previously unrecognized subunit of the MICOS complex, necessary for CJ integrity, cristae morphology, and mitochondrial function and provides a resource for further analysis of MICOS architecture."

Through systematic proteomic analysis of human MICOS, we identified QIL1 (C19orf70) as a novel conserved MICOS subunit. QIL1 depletion disrupted CJ structure in cultured human cells and in <i>Drosophila</i> muscle and neuronal cells in vivo. In human cells, mitochondrial disruption correlated with impaired respiration. Moreover, increased mitochondrial fragmentation was observed upon QIL1 depletion in flies. Using quantitative proteomics, we show that loss of QIL1 resulted in MICOS disassembly with the accumulation of a MIC60-MIC19-MIC25 sub-complex and degradation of MIC10, MIC26, and MIC27. Additionally, we demonstrated that in QIL1-depleted cells, overexpressed MIC10 fails to significantly restore its interaction with other MICOS subunits and SAMM50. Collectively, our work uncovers a previously unrecognized subunit of the MICOS complex, necessary for CJ integrity, cristae morphology, and mitochondrial function and provides a resource for further analysis of MICOS architecture."

The experiments showed that QIL1 is needed to bind a protein called MIC10 into the protein complex that anchors the cristae junctions to the outer membrane. In human and fruit fly cells without QIL1, this protein complex falls apart and is not repaired if extra MIC10 is added into the cells. Furthermore, in human cells lacking QIL1, the inner mitochondrial membrane forms the same onion-like rings seen in the cells of humans with mitochondrial diseases. Future studies are necessary to understand how the structure of the QIL1 complex is organized and to work out how the complex is capable of causing the mitochondrial inner membrane to curve."

Moreover, several mitochondrial disorders in humans are often accompanied by alterations of mitochondrial ultrastructure including MERRF syndrome (Myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibers), BTHS (Barth syndrome), fatal neonatal lactic acidosis, mtDNA defects and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and loss of CJs with the formation of concentric stacks of cristae membrane are some of the hallmarks observed in mitochondria from such patients (<a href=\"#bib39\">Silva-Oropeza et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Acehan et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Roels et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">G\u00f6tz et al., 2012</a>).

Recent studies in both yeast and human cells led to the identification of various subunits of a highly conserved heterooligomeric protein complex of approximately \u223c700 kDa, referred to as the mitochondrial contact site and cristae junction organizing system (MICOS), which controls the formation of CJs and CSs and IM morphology (<a href=\"#bib11\">Gieffers et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">John et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Xie et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Rabl et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Darshi et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Harner et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Hoppins et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">von der Malsburg et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Alkhaja et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">An et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bohnert et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Jans et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Korner et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Ott et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Pfanner et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Weber, 2013</a>). A recent study has proposed to unify the nomenclature for MICOS, with subunits of this complex termed MIC10 to MIC60 (with subunit mass indicated by the numbers) (<a href=\"#bib35\">Pfanner et al., 2014</a>). To date, 7 bona fide subunits have been described in yeast (Mic10, Mic12, Mic19, Mic25, Mic26, Mic27, Mic60), 6 of which have obvious human orthologs (MIC10/MINOS1, MIC19/CHCHD3, MIC25/CHCHD6, MIC27/APOOL, MIC26/APOO and MIC60/Mitofilin) (<a href=\"#bib20\">Icho et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Odgren et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Gieffers et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">John et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Xie et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Rabl et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Mun et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Darshi et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Harner et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Head et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Hoppins et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">von der Malsburg et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Alkhaja et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">An et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bohnert et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Korner et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Ott et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Itoh et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Jans et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Weber, 2013</a>). The MIC10-MIC19-MIC25-MIC26-MIC27-MIC60 complex is thought to reside in the IM at the site of CJs. Genetic removal of several MICOS subunits causes mitochondrial fragmentation, reduced respiration, CJs loss, and the formation of concentric stacks of IM disconnected from the IBM (<a href=\"#bib24\">John et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Rabl et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Darshi et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Harner et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Hoppins et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Alkhaja et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Ott et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">van der Laan et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Weber, 2013</a>). These phenotypes strikingly resemble cristae abnormalities observed in patients with the aforementioned mitochondrial disorders. Moreover, alterations of several MICOS subunit protein levels, mutations and protein modifications have been linked to a variety of human diseases, including diabetic cardiomyopathy, epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, and cancer (<a href=\"#bib50\">Zerbes et al., 2012</a>). One study has employed proteomic analysis of MIC10/MINOS1 protein interactors in human cells to identify further components of the complex, and in addition to the IM core subunits, this work also identified the OM proteins SAMM50, MTX1, MTX2, and the chaperone DNAJC11 (<a href=\"#bib2\">Alkhaja et al., 2012</a>). A role for these proteins (<a href=\"#bib47\">Xie et al., 2007</a>) and in particular the sorting and assembly machinery protein SAMM50 in CJ assembly was also found independently (<a href=\"#bib32\">Ott et al., 2012</a>), suggesting a role for \u03b2-barrel insertion into the OM in CJ formation or maintenance. Interestingly, mutations in DNAJC11 in the mouse result in mitochondrial disruption, cristae abnormalities, and motor neuron pathology (<a href=\"#bib21\">Ioakeimidis et al., 2014</a>)."

To develop a comprehensive understanding of MICOS composition and regulation, we performed proteomic IP-MS analysis of the MICOS complex. In addition to core MICOS subunits, we identified several new candidate MICOS-associated proteins. One of these\u2014QIL1\u2014is a previously unstudied IM protein conserved from human to <i>Drosophila</i>. Using quantitative proteomics coupled with native gel analysis, we show that QIL1 is a component of a \u223c700 KDa MICOS complex and its depletion from cells results in loss of MIC10, MIC26, and MIC27 from the complex and a reduction in the abundance of these proteins in mitochondria. Thus, QIL1 appears to be required for incorporation of MIC10, MIC26, and MIC27 into the MICOS complex. Depletion of QIL1 in human cells results in several mitochondrial phenotypes including loss of CJs, cristae rearrangement into stacks of concentric membranes, and reduced respiration. In <i>Drosophila</i> muscle and neuronal cells, QIL1 depletion leads to analogous morphological phenotypes. This study provides the most comprehensive protein interaction network map of the MICOS complex to date and will serve as a resource for further elucidation of MICOS assembly and regulation."

Confocal microscopy after immunostaining with \u03b1-HA and \u03b1-TOMM20 verified that each protein was targeted to mitochondria in HeLa cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). To identify high confidence interacting proteins (HCIPs), we employed a modified version of the <i>ComPASS</i> platform (<a href=\"#bib40\">Sowa et al., 2009</a>). This method uses a large collection of parallel AP-MS experiments to generate a database populated with peptide spectral matches, allowing the frequency, abundance, and reproducibility of interacting proteins to be determined. To enhance detection of membrane-associated proteins, we employed 1% digitonin, and proteins were purified using \u03b1-FLAG beads. After extensive washing, complexes were trypsinized prior to proteomic analysis. As a validation approach, three of the baits (MIC60, MTX2, and MIC19) were also expressed in HCT116 cells and immunopurified with a different antibody (\u03b1-HA). Interaction data are summarized in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a> (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a> contains the entire data set). Overall, the interaction network contained 26 proteins and 97 interactions (edges) after filtering as described in the \u2018Materials and methods\u2019. The six baits analyzed showed extensive reciprocal connectivity (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Confirming previously reported data, several core subunits of the MICOS complex (MIC19, MIC25, MIC60, MIC26, MIC27) also associated with known interactors at the OM (SAMM50, MTX1 and MTX2), indicating that our method is able to retrieve nearly all known subunits and interactors of the MICOS complex, located at the IM, IMS, and OM with high confidence. In addition to known interactors, our map also revealed potential novel interacting partners, associated with one or more MICOS subunits. These include two OM proteins, the MUL1 E3 ubiquitin ligase and the RHOT2 GTPase involved in mitochondrial trafficking (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). RHOT2 has been shown to co-fractionate with SAMM50 in correlation profiling proteomic experiments (<a href=\"#bib15\">Havugimana et al., 2012</a>). In addition, we identified TMEM11 as a protein associated with multiple MICOS subunits and capable of associating with MIC60 endogenously (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,F</a>). A TMEM11 ortholog in <i>Drosophila</i> has been shown genetically to be required for cristae organization and biogenesis, but the mechanisms involved are unknown (<a href=\"#bib37a\">Rival et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib26a\">Macchi et al., 2013</a>). Our results indicate that TMEM11 may function in these processes in association with the MICOS complex. Components of the MICOS complex were not detected in GFP-FLAG immune complexes prepared similarly (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), pointing the specificity of the interactions observed."

As an initial approach for validating the interactions, C-terminally tagged QIL1 was subjected to IP-MS analysis. The result elicited the generation of an interaction map containing 13 nodes and 20 edges (interactions) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>), wherein we identified 5 core MICOS subunits (MIC60, MIC19, MIC25, MIC26 and MIC27), 3 OM known interactors (SAMM50, MTX1 and MTX2) as well as the chaperone DNAJC11 and TMEM11 in association with QIL1.

First, QIL1-HA-FLAG was found to co-localize with endogenous TOMM20 in HeLa cells, (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Second, endogenous QIL1 was detected in purified mitochondria from 293T cells by western blotting, with a level of enrichment similar to that found with other mitochondrial proteins (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1I</a>), confirming that QIL1 is a mitochondrial protein. Our bioinformatics analysis identified QIL1 orthologs across metazoans, including <i>Drosophila</i> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>). Additionally, primary sequence analysis using the TMpred algorithm revealed that QIL1 contains one possible conserved transmembrane helix (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>). To investigate whether QIL1 is a transmembrane protein, we performed carbonate extraction on mitochondria isolated from 293T cells. As expected, the transmembrane proteins TOMM70A and TIMM23 were resistant to alkaline extraction regardless of the increase in pH, whereas DLD was efficiently released into the soluble fraction at higher pH (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1I,J</a>). Most bona fide MICOS subunits described so far are transmembrane proteins, with the exception of MIC19 and MIC25 (<a href=\"#bib35\">Pfanner et al., 2014</a>). Interestingly, MIC19 has been shown to be myristoylated at the N-terminus allowing its docking onto SAMM50, which is embedded in the OM, and possesses a CHCH domain at its C-terminus that binds to MIC60, present in the IM (<a href=\"#bib9\">Darshi et al., 2012</a>) (see <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). MIC19 was only partially extracted from the membrane fraction with increasing pH (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1J</a>). Similarly, while entirely present in the membrane fraction at lower pH, QIL1 was partially extracted from the membrane fraction at higher pH (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1I,J</a>). We did not identify a predicted myristoylation site or a CHCH domain in QIL1. These results suggest that QIL1 may indeed possess membrane anchoring activity, being possibly anchored by a single conserved membrane spanning helix as predicted by the TMPred algorithm (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hofmann and Stoffel, 1993</a>)."

Mitochondria were isolated from HCT116 cells and incubated with increasing concentrations of digitonin in the presence of proteinase K (PK). Subsequently, samples were analyzed by immunoblotting for the OM protein TOMM70A, IM proteins TIMM23 and MIC60, and matrix protein CLPP (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1K</a>). These experiments showed that the topology of QIL1 is similar to the topology of the IM proteins TIMM23 and MIC60 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1K</a>). To confirm the topology of QIL1, we performed Proteinase K digestion with and without osmotic shock in the presence or absence of Triton X-100 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1L</a>) as described previously (<a href=\"#bib14\">Harner et al., 2014</a>). QIL1 displayed resistance to Proteinase K treatment in isolated mitochondria, but became accessible to protease digestion when the OM was disrupted by osmotic shock (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1L</a>), as also found with the IM proteins TIMM23 and MIC60 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1L</a>). Importantly, the matrix protein CLPP was only accessible to Proteinase K digestion when mitochondria were solubilized with 1% Triton X-100, demonstrating the integrity of the IM.

Thus, we asked whether QIL1 is present in the \u223c700 kDa MICOS complex found in mitochondria from human cells (<a href=\"#bib32\">Ott et al., 2012</a>). To address this question, mitochondria isolated from 293T cells stably expressing C-terminally tagged QIL1, MIC60, MIC19, or MIC25 (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>) were lysed in 1% digitonin and subjected to BN-PAGE followed by immunoblot analysis (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). QIL1 was found to be predominantly localized at \u223c700 kDa (asterisks). Similarly, MIC60, MIC19, and MIC25 were found in a \u223c700 kDa complex as expected. Additionally, MIC60, MIC19, and MIC25 were also present in a smaller complex of \u223c500 kDa (two asterisks) suggesting the existence of an assembly intermediate or sub-complex containing these three proteins. Using 2-dimensional BN-PAGE electrophoresis, we found that endogenous QIL1 was present within the mature MICOS complex migrating at \u223c700 kDa (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). Confirming our findings in one-dimensional BN-PAGE immunoblotting, MIC60, MIC19, and MIC25 were found in the \u223c700 kDa complex (asterisk) and in the smaller sub-complex (two asterisks), while MIC10 and QIL1 were primarily found in the \u223c700 kDa complex. To address whether QIL1 transiently associates with the dissociated MICOS subunits, we solubilized mitochondria with 1% Triton X-100, which leads to the dissociation of the MICOS complex into smaller complexes as previously described (<a href=\"#bib14\">Harner et al., 2014</a>). While C-terminally tagged QIL1 efficiently co-purified with endogenous MIC60, MIC19, MIC27, and MIC10 when mitochondria were solubilized with 1% digitonin, no specific binding was detected when mitochondria were solubilized with Triton X-100, consistent with an association of QIL1 with the mature MICOS complex (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>).

Moreover, we observed an increase in mitochondrial fragmentation and sphericity in the <i>Drosophila</i> muscle upon QIL1 depletion as shown by our confocal microscopy analysis (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E\u2013J</a>). Similarly, silencing of QIL1 specifically in neurons using the Elav-Dcr-Gal4 driver to express UAS-Control<sup>RNAi</sup> or UAS-QIL1<sup>RNAi</sup> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4K</a>) led to loss of CJs and the formation of concentric stacks of IM inside the matrix compartment in neurons at neuromuscular junctions (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4L\u2013M</a>). Quantification of the number of mitochondria containing IM swirls in neurons revealed a significant increase upon QIL1 knockdown (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4N</a>). Together, these results demonstrate that QIL1 loss destabilizes CJs and alters cristae morphology in different cell types in vivo in a cell autonomous fashion."

Moreover, we observed a concomitant accumulation of MIC60, MIC19, and MIC25 in a smaller sub-complex of \u223c500 kDa. These data agree with the presence of both overexpressed and endogenous MIC60, MIC19, and MIC25 in this sub-complex (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D\u2013E</a>). We hypothesized that QIL1 promotes the maturation of the MICOS complex by acting as a scaffold at the IM, bridging a sub-complex containing MIC60, MIC19, and MIC25 to other subunits including MIC10, MIC26, and MIC27. We hypothesized that when QIL1 is depleted, MIC10, MIC26, and MIC27 fail to integrate into the complex and are degraded. To test this, we asked whether overexpressed MIC10 could physically interact with other MICOS subunits and be incorporated into the mature MICOS complex in cells where QIL1 had been silenced. Thus, we transiently expressed C-terminally tagged MIC10 in cells expressing FF2 shRNA or a shRNA-targeting QIL1 and assessed the presence of the overexpressed protein in the mature MICOS complex at \u223c700 kDa by BN-PAGE followed by immunoblotting (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). C-terminally tagged MIC10 was more efficiently assembled into the MICOS complex in control cells compared to those lacking QIL1 even though MIC10 was expressed at similar levels (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A\u2013B</a>) and was properly imported into mitochondria (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B\u2013C</a>) in both, control and QIL1-depleted cell lines.

QIL1 associates with the core IM MICOS complex, the cardiolipin binding subunits (MIC26 and MIC27), as well as the SAMM50-MTX1-MTX2 OM complex (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Moreover, QIL1 is enriched at CJs to an extent similar to that of the MICOS subunit MIC25 and is present in a \u223c700 kDa complex, as observed by BN-PAGE (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). Thus, QIL1 may be a central component of CJs and the machinery that connects inner and outer membranes (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). Indeed, depletion of QIL1 leads to MICOS-like defects in cristae morphology, with loss of CJs and formation of swirls of cristae membranes inside mitochondria (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013H</a>). QIL1 is conserved in <i>Drosophila</i> where its depletion also causes mitochondrial phenotypes (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Moreover, QIL1 knockdown resulted in MICOS disassembly, accumulation of a MIC60-MIC19-MIC25 sub-complex and loss of MIC10, MIC26, and MIC27 from the MICOS complex, as determined by quantitative proteomics and immunoblot analysis (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013D</a>)."

In fact, cardiolipins have been shown to be enriched at those regions. In Barth syndrome patients, the levels of the enzyme Tafazzin, required for the remodeling of acyl chains within cardiolipins, are decreased, resulting in reduced cardiolipin levels. This leads to major alterations of mitochondrial membranes morphology and curvature, with the appearance of collapsed cristae packaged in multiple concentric layers (<a href=\"#bib1\">Acehan et al., 2007</a>). Interestingly, Tafazzin mutations in flies generated a Barth syndrome-related phenotype characterized by decreased cardiolipin levels, mitochondria showing cristae membrane swirls and motor defects (<a href=\"#bib48\">Xu et al., 2006</a>)."

Due to its ability to bind cardiolipin, the presence of MIC27 at CJs is particularly important (<a href=\"#bib45\">Weber, 2013</a>). Thus, alterations in mitochondrial cardiolipin levels after QIL1 depletion could potentially offer an alternative, indirect explanation for the observed phenotypes. To test the possibility that QIL1 regulates mitochondrial cardiolipin levels, we measured cardiolipin content and species distribution in QIL1-depleted cells compared to control cells expressing FF2 shRNA. We observed that the cardiolipin profiles of cells expressing FF2 or three different QIL1 shRNAs were similar (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), excluding an indirect effect of QIL1 through regulation of cardiolipin levels. This observation is in agreement with data published previously, showing that cardiolipin composition was not substantially changed by the lack of the central MICOS subunits MIC60 or MIC10 (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bohnert et al., 2012</a>).

These data suggest that MIC60-MIC19-MIC25 could perform other functions in association with the OM, independently of MIC10, MIC26, and MIC27. This is not surprising given that it has been shown previously that a fraction of MIC60 molecules, but not MIC10, functions in biogenesis of \u03b2-barrel proteins of the OM (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bohnert et al., 2012</a>) independently of other subunits. Restoration of MIC10 levels by overexpression in cells depleted for QIL1 failed to significantly rescue its interaction with other MICOS subunits (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D\u2013E</a>) and incorporation into the \u223c700 kDa complex (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>) as compared to wild-type cells even though MIC10 was efficiently imported into mitochondria and expressed at similar levels in both conditions (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B\u2013C</a>). This indicates that QIL1 is required for the binding of MIC10 to the MIC60-MIC19-MIC25 sub-complex. Thus, we propose a stratified model of MICOS assembly, where the stable MIC60-MIC19-MIC25 sub-complex at the IM binds to MIC10, MIC26, and MIC27 to generate a mature MICOS complex in a step facilitated by QIL1 (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>)."

Intriguingly, the number of mitochondria containing swirls increases slowly with aging (<a href=\"#bib44\">Walker and Benzer, 2004</a>). In contrast, giant mitochondria with honeycomb-like cristae were observed in animals exposed to hypoxia (<a href=\"#bib26\">Lorente et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Perkins and Hsiao, 2012</a>). These findings demonstrate the importance of cristae remodeling as a mechanism of adaptation to different metabolic and pathological states in vivo. It still remains to be addressed whether regulation of the MICOS complex takes place in these scenarios."

For proteins with similar molecular weights (e.g., QIL1 and MIC10), separate gels were run for immunoblotting. For IPs of ectopically expressed proteins, agarose beads conjugated with HA or Flag antibodies (Sigma, St. Louis, USA) were used. IP-MS and CompPASS analysis were performed as described previously (<a href=\"#bib40\">Sowa et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Behrends et al., 2010</a>). Briefly, cells (10<sup>7</sup>) were lysed for IP-MS using \u03b1-HA beads or \u03b1-Flag. After washing, proteins were eluted with HA or Flag peptide, subjected to trichloroacetic acid precipitation, and trypsinized prior to passage through StageTips.

Protein Assembler was used to convert spectral counts to average peptide spectral matches (APSMs), which takes into account peptides, which match more than one protein in the database. Peptides were identified with a false discovery rate of &lt;1.0%, and the protein false discovery rate was &lt;2.0% (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Peptide data (APSMs) were uploaded into the CompPASS algorithm housed within the CORE environment. For CompPASS analysis of HCT116 cells, we employed a stats table of 214 unrelated bait proteins analyzed in an analogous manner. For analysis of 293T cells, a database of 48 baits was used. The CompPASS system identifies HCIPs based on the WDN-score, which incorporates the frequency with which they identified within the stats table, the abundance (APSMs) when found, and the reproducibility of identification in technical replicates, and also determines a z-score based on APSMs (<a href=\"#bib40\">Sowa et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Behrends et al., 2010</a>). Proteins with WDN-scores &gt;1.0 are considered HCIPs, although we also note that some proteins that may be bona fide-interacting proteins may not reach the strict threshold set by a WDN-score of &gt;1.0 (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

Mitochondria were lysed with 1% Digitonin and protein complexes fractionated by blue native-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (BN-PAGE). Gel bands were excised and proteins subjected to reduction, alkylation, and trypsinization. Tryptic peptides were analyzed using a Q Exactive mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, USA) coupled with a Famos Autosampler (LC Packings) and an Accela600 liquid chromatography (LC) pump (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Peptides were separated on a 100-\u03bcm inner diameter microcapillary column packed with \u223c0.25 cm of Magic C4 resin (5 \u03bcm, 100 \u00c5, Michrom Bioresources, Billerica, USA) followed by \u223c18 cm of Accucore C18 resin (2.6 \u03bcm, 150 \u00c5, Thermo Fisher Scientific). For each analysis, we loaded \u223c1 \u03bcg onto the column. Peptides were separated using a 90 gradient of 5\u201328% acetonitrile in 0.125% formic acid with a flow rate of \u223c300 nl/min. The scan sequence began with an Orbitrap MS1 spectrum with the following parameters: resolution 70,000, scan range 300\u20131500 Th, automatic gain control (AGC) target 1 \u00d7 10<sup>6</sup>, maximum injection time 250 ms, and centroid spectrum data type.

The underfill ratio was set at 9%, which corresponds to a 1.5 \u00d7 10<sup>5</sup> intensity threshold. In addition, unassigned and singly charged species were excluded from MS2 analysis and dynamic exclusion was set to automatic.

The 15 most intense ions from the survey scan were selected and fragmented with HCD with stepped normalized collision energies of 30, 60, and 100. Target values for MS/MS were set at 100,000 with a maximum injection time of 120 ms at a resolution of 17,500 at m/z 200. To avoid repetitive sequencing, the dynamic exclusion of sequenced peptides was set at 10 s. Peaks were analyzed using the Lipid Search algorithm (MKI, Tokyo, Japan). Peaks were defined through raw files, product ion and precursor ion accurate masses. Candidate molecular species were identified by database (&gt;1,000,000 entries) search of negative ion adducts. Mass tolerance was set to 5 ppm for the precursor mass. Samples were aligned within a time window and results combined in a single report. An internal standard for cardiolipin (CL 14:1/14:1/14:1/15:1) spiked in prior to extraction was used for normalization and calculation of the amounts of lipids in pmol/mg protein."

In addition to the wealth of interaction data, the authors also demonstrate that loss of QIL1 has catastrophic consequences on mitochondrial morphology and cristae structure, consistent with loss of other MICOS proteins. This is strengthened by the use of two distinct model systems thereby demonstrating the conserved role of this protein. Overall, the data is convincing and the story is interesting, however, potentially extending the investigation a bit further could substantially raise the impact. In the end, this is a strong paper and should be accepted."

To address this question, we collaborated with Florian Fr\u00f6hlich (an expert in lipidomics in Tobias Walther\u2019s lab) to measure cardiolipin levels in mitochondria in a direct manner by mass spectrometry. Our analysis revealed that cardiolipin levels and species distribution were unchanged upon QIL1 stable knockdown using 3 different shRNAs (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2013figure supplement 1</a>). This data supports a more direct structural role for QIL1 in MICOS stability, suggesting a scenario that would be more consistent with QIL1 being a component of the MICOS complex rather than being indirectly involved, for example, in promoting cardiolipin production.

We apologize. <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2013figure supplement 1</a> contained QIL1 western blots for cells expressing either QIL1-HA-FLAG or one of several other MICOS subunits. The reviewer commented that the levels of QIL1 were much higher in the cells expressing MICOS but the comparison being made was with the QIL1-HA-FLAG cell line, not control 293T cells. It turns out that when compared to control cell lines, the levels of endogenous QIL1 in the MICOS subunit expressing cells are identical to 293T cells expressing the empty vector with the HA-Flag tag (as shown in the new <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2013figure supplement 1B</a>). In cells expressing QIL1-HA-FLAG, there is a reduction in the abundance of the endogenous QIL1, likely reflecting the fact that there is a homeostatic mechanism to maintain total QIL1 levels within a particular range. The band for the HA-FLAG tagged QIL1 is approximately equal to the levels of endogenous QIL1 and together, they are similar to the levels of endogenous QIL1 in the control cell line. We updated the figure (now <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2013figure supplement 1B</a>) with a western that also includes the control 293T cells and will describe this better in the text."

SDS-PAGE analysis also allows for better detection of epitopes otherwise hidden in the native conformation inside certain supramolecular complexes. Moreover, the identity of the proteins present in these larger complexes remains unknown and it is possible that they include additional components not in the classical MICOS complexes.

We have now attempted to perform IP-MS analysis on a stable cell line expressing C-terminally tagged MIC10. Even though we can detect MIC10-HA by western blot analysis and confirm its mitochondrial localization by immunofluorescence, we weren\u2019t able to detect peptides for MIC10 by mass spectrometry. Also, we were unable to directly observe MIC10 via IP-MS targeting other known MICOS complex members. This mostly reflects idiosyncrasies of this protein's primary structure that make it uniquely challenging for identification via bottom-up proteomics methods. These techniques rely upon digestion of proteins with trypsin to produce peptides whose chemical and physical properties are amenable for isolation, LC separation, and fragmentation. Although intact human proteins vary in their structural and chemical characteristics, upon digestion the vast majority produces at least several peptides that are suitable for LC-MS detection; the exceptions are small and often hydrophobic proteins. Not only is MIC10 small (78 amino acids), but nearly a quarter of its sequence consists of a transmembrane domain and the C-terminal half that extends into the intermembrane space is quite hydrophobic as well. Furthermore, its eight basic residues (K/R) are unevenly distributed across its length and often cluster together in series, reducing digestion efficiency and resulting in tryptic peptides that are either long or too short to be specific to a single protein. Of the four tryptic peptides whose expected lengths would exceed four amino acids, two are long and excessively hydrophobic: one encompasses essentially the entire transmembrane domain; the other, spanning nearly the entire inter-membrane portion of the protein, contains two tyrosines, one tryptophan, and two phenylalanines along with several aliphatic side chains. The second of these peptides also contains several Met residues whose side chains are prone to oxidation during sample handling, potentially dividing its signal across multiple oxidation states. The remaining peptides are the N-terminal peptide (MSESELGR) and another nearby sequence (CLADAVVK), neither of which are ideal targets for LC-MS detection. Because MIC10 poses so many challenges, it is not surprising that it was not observed directly in our AP-MS experiments. Fortunately, it is not a typical example: more than 98% of human proteins listed in SwissProt are longer than MIC10 and will more likely produce tryptic peptides suitable for LC-MS detection. Thus, we expect that very few other bona fide interactors would evade AP-MS detection in this way."

In addition to the wealth of interaction data, the authors also demonstrate that loss of QIL1 has catastrophic consequences on mitochondrial morphology and cristae structure, consistent with loss of other MICOS proteins. This is strengthened by the use of two distinct model systems thereby demonstrating the conserved role of this protein.
