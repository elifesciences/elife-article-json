Here, we identify a network of dynamic, tubular lysosomes that extends throughout <i>Drosophila</i> muscle, in vivo. Live imaging reveals that autophagosomes merge with tubular lysosomes and that lysosomal membranes undergo extension, retraction, fusion and fission. The dynamics and integrity of this tubular lysosomal network requires VCP, an AAA-ATPase that, when mutated, causes degenerative diseases of muscle, bone and neurons. We show that human VCP rescues the defects caused by loss of <i>Drosophila</i> VCP and overexpression of disease relevant VCP transgenes dismantles tubular lysosomes, linking tubular lysosome dysfunction to human VCP-related diseases. Finally, disruption of tubular lysosomes correlates with impaired autophagosome-lysosome fusion, increased cytoplasmic poly-ubiquitin aggregates, lipofuscin material, damaged mitochondria and impaired muscle function. We propose that VCP sustains sarcoplasmic proteostasis, in part, by controlling the integrity of a dynamic tubular lysosomal network."

Lysosomes contain powerful enzymes that destroy damaged proteins and other cellular structures that would otherwise accumulate in the cells. In most cells, lysosomes look like bubble-like compartments called vesicles. However, in some types of cells lysosomes have been observed to form a network of tubules that extend throughout the cell interior. However, it remains unclear what these tubules do, how they form in cells and whether they are altered in disease."

These tubules constantly changed in living muscles; extending, retracting, breaking and merging to form a large tubular lysosome network. When Johnson et al. reduced the amount of VCP produced by the muscle cells, via a method called RNA interference, the lysosome tubules broke down into vesicles that were no longer constantly changing. Modifying these defective fly muscle cells so that they produced the human VCP protein caused the tubules to form again. These results suggest that the human and fly VCP proteins are very similar and that they play a key role in either the ability of lysosomes to form tubules or the maintenance of existing tubules."

VCP is an AAA-ATPase that has essential functions in ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis. But, pathogenic mutations in VCP do not seem to impair the UPS or ERAD protein degradation pathways (<a href=\"#bib41\">Tresse et al., 2010a</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Chang et al., 2011</a>). More recently, VCP has been implicated in autophagy. Specifically, over-expression of VCP mutant transgenes with disease causing mutations leads to an accumulation of autophagosomes (<a href=\"#bib19\">Ju et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Tresse et al., 2010a</a>), suggesting that VCP functions in processes related to the maturation or fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes."

Lysosomes are classically thought to be vesicular organelles, where they serve as depots for cargo delivered via endosomes or autophagosomes. However, in certain systems lysosomes have been observed to adopt non-vesicular morphologies. A particularly dramatic example has been observed in a subset of bone-derived cultured macrophages, where lysosomes form abundant, extended tubules that radiate from the cell center and, in some cases, form an interconnected web throughout the cytoplasm (<a href=\"#bib36\">Swanson et al., 1987a</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Knapp and Swanson, 1990</a>). Additionally, there are examples where cellular stress, particularly the induction of high levels of autophagy, induces lysosomal membranes to tubulate and undergo scission to produce new vesicular lysosomes, a process referred to as autophagic lysosome reformation (ALR) (<a href=\"#bib50\">Yu et al., 2010</a>). Despite these observations, lysosome tubules have received little attention and it remains unclear to what extent lysosome tubulation occurs in different cell types and what purpose it serves in vivo. Moreover, the molecular repertoire of factors required for lysosome tubule formation is virtually unknown."

Disruption of lysosome tubules correlates with defects in autophagosome-lysosome fusion, increased poly-ubiquitin aggregates and the accumulation of lipofuscin material in the sarcoplasm. We show that the human VCP homolog can rescue lysosomal tubulation following loss of VCP in <i>Drosophila</i> muscle, indicating that the functions of VCP in lysosome tubulation are conserved. Finally, we demonstrate that homologous mutations that cause VCP diseases in human patients disrupt the lysosome tubular lattice, suggesting that disruption of lysosome tubules contributes to VCP mutant pathogenesis. Taken together, our data establish a functional link between lysosome tubule dysfunction and the pathology of VCP-related degenerative diseases."

Remarkably, when Spinster-RFP is expressed in <i>Drosophila</i> muscle, Spin-RFP localizes to an expansive tubular network (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A\u2013C</a> and <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). Tubules were found evenly distributed throughout the sarcoplasm and formed a web of connections with other tubules (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a>). Tubules were observed in every muscle and there were no apparent differences in the tubule abundance or architecture between different muscles. We also observed enlarged vesicular compartments at tubule intersections throughout the muscle (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). This network is highly sensitive to all chemical fixation conditions that we have attempted. When subjected to fixation, the tubule lattice collapses (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>), leaving behind distributed round, Spinster-positive compartments that resemble classically defined late-endosomal, lysosomal structures (<a href=\"#bib38\">Sweeney and Davis, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Dermaut et al., 2005</a>). Thus, live imaging is essential to study the function and relevance of this Spin-positive, tubular network."

We find evidence of tubule extension, retraction, scission and fusion (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E\u2013G</a>). The dominant activity in the network is the dynamic extension and retraction of individual tubules throughout the sarcoplasm (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a> and <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). Often the same tubule was observed to extend and retract, while surrounding tubules remained constant. The impression is that the lattice has both stable, interconnected tubules and dynamic elements that create new connections or retract once a connection is broken. In less frequent instances, we observed scission events from the end of a tubule, resulting in a mobile vesicle (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). In a corollary phenomenon, we observed tubule extensions that resulted in tubules fusing to larger nodes in the network (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>). Finally, we observed de novo formation of tubules extruding from the side of existing tubules (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>, last panel) demonstrating that tubulation can originate from existing tubules, not just pre-existing nodes. Importantly, the existence of a tubular network and tubule dynamics are not an artifact of a dissected neuromuscular preparation. We observed an identical, dynamic tubular lysosomal network in intact larvae that were imaged through the cuticle while restrained in a microfluidics chamber (<a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>)."

Lysotracker staining confirmed the existence of this tubular network in wild type muscle (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). We also note that the tubule intersections stained more intensely for Lysotracker than the tubules themselves. This could be due to increased tubule volume at the intersections, or these sites might actually have a lower pH than the tubules themselves. Finally, we co-imaged Spin-RFP with several other organelle markers to verify that Spinster specifically labels lysosomes and does not co-stain other organelles. ER and mitochondria also form tubule structures, but when we co-imaged Spin-RFP with ER-tracker and Mito-tracker fluorescent dyes, Spin-RFP tubules did not co-localize with either ER or mitochondria tubules (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,D</a>). Instead, Spin-RFP tubules were interwoven between mitochondria and ER tubules. Additionally, Spin-RFP did not co-localize with markers for early endosomes (YFP-Rab5), recycling endosomes (Rab11-GFP), medial Golgi (ManII-GFP) or trans Golgi (GalT-YFP) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E\u2013H</a>). We note that Golgi organization in muscles forms vesicular structures rather than the classical Golgi stacks that are observed in most cell types and this is consistent with Golgi organization that has been observed in vertebrate skeletal muscles (<a href=\"#bib31\">Ralston et al., 2001</a>). Collectively, we have identified and characterized a dynamic tubular lysosomal network that permeates the entire sarcoplasm of <i>Drosophila</i> body-wall muscle in vivo."

We focused on genes that have been implicated in the autophagy-lysosome system and identified the AAA-ATPase VCP as being required for the integrity of the entire tubular lysosome network. Specifically, inhibiting <i>VCP</i> expression by RNAi abolished lysosome tubules, leaving behind vesicles throughout the sarcoplasm (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>). The lysosome vesicles were irregular in their size and shape and appeared clustered, rather than uniformly distributed throughout the sarcoplasm. To determine whether the catalytic ATPase function of VCP is required for the tubular network integrity, we employed a VCP-selective inhibitor DBeQ (<a href=\"#bib4\">Chou et al., 2011</a>). Acute inhibition of VCP with DBeQ completely disrupted the tubular network after 3 hr (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,D</a>), demonstrating the required catalytic function of VCP. Furthermore, time-lapse imaging of Spin-GFP after treatment with DBeQ for 4 hr revealed that the remaining vesicular lysosome structures are completely static (<a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a>)."

However, it is also possible that loss of this network is a secondary correlate of impaired muscle health. To address this issue, we examined two additional RNAi-mediated conditions that cause muscle degeneration, looking for the presence or absence of tubular lysosomes. Specifically, we expressed RNAi against <i>parkin</i> and <i>tbph</i>, <i>Drosophila</i> orthologues of genes linked to Parkinson's and ALS, respectively. These RNAi have been shown to cause muscle degeneration in <i>Drosophila</i> (<a href=\"#bib9\">Diaper et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Cornelissen et al., 2014</a>). Remarkably, we did not observe any significant effect on lysosome tubules (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H\u2013J</a>) when <i>parkin-RNAi</i> and <i>tbph-RNAi</i> are expressed with <i>BG57-Gal4</i>, the same Gal4 line used to express <i>VCP-RNAi</i> throughout our studies."

Thus, it is possible that loss of tubular lysosomes is caused indirectly by ER stress. To address this possibility, we treated muscles with tunicamycin (TM) to induce ER stress by another means and examined the tubular network. Upon treatment with TM for 4 hr, the Spin-RFP tubular network remained intact (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3K,L</a>). We verified that ER stress was induced by examining levels of Hsc70/BiP, a marker of ER stress, in protein lysates derived from the same animals that were used for imaging. Total protein levels of Hsc70/BiP were significantly increased in both TM and DBeQ treated muscles (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3M</a>). Thus, tubular network disruption is not a byproduct of ER stress. Taken together, our data are consistent with three conclusions: (1) VCP loss of function disrupts the integrity of the tubular lysosomal network, (2) the role of VCP in maintaining tubular lysosomes is conserved and (3) disruption of the tubular network is specific for VCP loss of function and not a secondary byproduct of muscle degeneration or ER stress."

This led us to explore the intersection of the observed tubular lysosomal network and autophagy. First, we co-imaged Spin-GFP with the autophagosome membrane marker mCherry-Atg8a/LC3 to determine the relationship between autophagosomes and the tubular lysosome network. Remarkably, we find that mCherry-Atg8a precisely co-localizes with Spin-GFP-labeled tubules (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). The mCherry-Atg8a labeling is widely distributed within the network, but does not label the full extent of every tubule (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Time-lapse imaging revealed mCherry-Atg8a labeling is dynamic within Spin-GFP tubules (<a href=\"#media5\">Video 5</a>). Some mCherry-Atg8a puncta appear to traffic through the Spin-GFP tubules suggesting that autophagosome membranes and/or cargos are dynamic within the tubular lysosome network (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Atg8 localizes to the autophagophore membrane prior to the formation of an enclosed autophagosome, at which point Atg8 is shed from the outer autophagosome membrane (<a href=\"#bib49\">Xie and Klionsky, 2007</a>). After autophagosomes fuse with lysosomes, lysosomal enzymes degrade the inner autophagosome membrane containing Atg8 (<a href=\"#bib49\">Xie and Klionsky, 2007</a>). Given this sequence of events, we propose that the mCherry-Atg8a positive regions of the lysosome tubules represent ongoing degradation of autophagosome membranes following fusion with the Spin-GFP positive lysosomal network."

When VCP was knocked down and the tubular-lysosomal network was eliminated, Atg8 no longer co-localized with Spin-GFP (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Rather, Atg8-positive vesicles were found closely apposed to Spin-positive, vesicular lysosomal compartments. This close apposition suggests that the autophagosomes can identify and potentially dock against the lysosomal membranes, but fusion of the autophagosome with the lysosome is defective. This is consistent with an established role for the yeast VCP homolog, Cdc48, in membrane fusion (<a href=\"#bib23\">Latterich et al., 1995</a>)."

In neutral pH conditions, both GFP and mCherry fluoresce. However, in acidic environments such as in the lysosomal lumen, GFP fluorescence is quenched and only mCherry is observed. Thus, autophagosomes that are fused with lysosomes will exhibit mCherry but not GFP fluorescence. It is important to note that Spin-GFP fluorescence is not quenched because the C-terminal GFP tag resides on the cytoplasmic face of lysosomes (<a href=\"#bib8\">Dermaut et al., 2005</a>). When we expressed the dual fluorescence reporter in muscles we found no detectable GFP fluorescence in the tubules that label strongly for mCherry-Atg8a (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>), consistent with other data indicating that the tubules are acidic. To further test the acidic nature of the tubules, we treated muscles with concanamycin A, a specific inhibitor of the lysosomal V-ATPase that is required for lysosome acidification (<a href=\"#bib17\">Huss et al., 2002</a>). Upon treatment with ConA for 3 hr, we observed GFP and mCherry positive tubules (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>).

Surprisingly, inhibiting VCP activity with DBeQ for 2 hr triggered the formation of rod-shaped VCP aggregates that effectively sequester VCP-Venus from the sarcoplasm (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). The formation of these aggregates is striking, as they resemble rod-like structures characteristic of prion aggregates. We considered two possible reasons that application of DBeQ might increase the propensity for VCP to aggregate. First, DBeQ binding to VCP might initiate aggregation directly by altering the solubility of VCP. Alternatively, the aggregation could be caused by the functions of VCP in other contexts, such as proteasome-dependent protein degradation. Remarkably, when we applied the proteasome inhibitor MG132, VCP-Venus rapidly aggregated in a manner identical to that observed following DBeQ incubation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). VCP aggregation was not due to increased VCP protein levels as a result of proteasome inhibition, because total VCP protein did not increase significantly upon MG132 or DBeQ treatment (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>)."

Since VCP exists as a hexamer, MG132 incubation in muscles over-expressing VCP-Venus should sequester both wild type and Venus-tagged VCP. Application of MG132 induced VCP-Venus aggregate formation, which correlated with dissolution of the tubular lysosomal network (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). When MG132 was washed out, VCP aggregates dissolved within 20 min and, as they disappeared, cytoplasmic VCP fluorescence intensity increased (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a> and <a href=\"#media6\">Video 6</a>). During this time, cytoplasmic VCP-Venus accumulated at autophagosomes/lysosomes (mCherry-Atg8a) and tubules began to reform (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a> and <a href=\"#media6\">Video 6</a>).

We first examined the acidification of the lysosomes by co-imaging Spin-GFP with Lysotracker in <i>VCP-RNAi</i> animals and found that the enlarged Spin-GFP vesicles also co-stained with Lysotracker (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>), indicating that they are acidic. Then, we examined whether lysosome enzymes were delivered properly to the lysosomes. Normally, the lysosomal enzyme Cathepsin-L is proteolytically processed in the lysosomal lumen to form a mature enzyme. To further examine the functionality of the lysosomes, we examined processing of Cathepsin-L and found no significant difference in Cathepsin-L processing in <i>VCP-RNAi</i> animals or animals treated with DBeQ (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Thus, disruption of the tubular lysosomal network does not appear to affect the proteolytic capacity of sarcoplasmic lysosomes."

Based on this, we expected to find evidence of failed autophagy in VCP knockdown muscle. In wild type muscles stained with a poly-ubiquitin antibody, we observed small puncta around the nucleus and a few small puncta in the cytoplasm (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). These small puncta likely represent active sites of protein degradation by the proteasome. However, in muscles expressing <i>VCP-RNAi</i> we observed a dramatic accumulation of cytoplasmic poly-ubiquitin aggregates (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Even acute treatment with DBeQ was sufficient to produce cytoplasmic poly-ubiquitin aggregates (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C\u2013E</a>). We also note that VCP inhibition caused a dramatic decrease in poly-ubiquitin conjugates around the nucleus, which likely reflects failed delivery of poly-ubiquitinated proteins to the proteasome. Importantly, we find that Spin-positive lysosomes are devoid of poly-ubiquitin staining (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>), an observation that is consistent with our model of failed fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes."

We examined the functional pool of muscle mitochondria in vivo using mitotracker-Orange CM-H2TMRos, which selectively stains mitochondria with an active membrane potential. Muscles expressing <i>VCP-RNAi</i> displayed less mitotracker-Orange CM-H2TMRos staining and the visualized mitochondria had an altered morphology, appearing round and dispersed rather than being densely packed, tubular structures (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G,H</a>). The swollen mitochondria observed in the VCP RNAi expressing muscles are likely defective and should be a prime target for mitophagy-dependent degradation. Taken together with the appearance of polyubiquitin aggregates, these data are consistent with an overall defect in autophagic clearance of proteins and defective organelles. However, since VCP has also been shown to be recruited directly to damaged mitochondria (<a href=\"#bib20\">Kim et al., 2013</a>) we cannot rule out the possibility that the effects on mitochondrial morphology and membrane potential are due to direct VCP functions at the mitochondrial outer membrane."

Lipofuscin granules are a conglomerate of polymerized non-degradable proteins and lipids that build up in the lysosomal lumen (<a href=\"#bib39\">Szweda et al., 2003</a>). A distinguishing property of lipofuscin granules is that they exhibit auto-fluorescence at 488 nm. Wild type or <i>VCP-RNAi</i> muscles were stained with LysoTracker-Red and imaged at both 488 nm (green) and 555 nm (magenta). The wild type muscles did not display any detectable auto-fluorescence at 488 nm (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6I</a>). But, we observed strong auto-fluorescent puncta in <i>VCP-RNAi</i> that co-localized with LysoTracker (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6J</a>), indicative of lipofuscin granules. We did not observe autofluorescent puncta to the same extent when wild type muscles were treated with DBeQ for 4 hr (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6K</a>), suggesting that lipofuscin accumulation is a progressive phenotype. Alternatively, lipofuscin granule accumulation could require loss of VCP protein rather than just loss of VCP catalytic activity.

To date, a total of 19 missense mutations in 13 different residues are associated with IBMFD that reside in either the Cdc48 homology domain, the L1 linker domain or the D1 ATPase domain (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a> and [<a href=\"#bib18\">Ju and Weihl, 2010</a>]). We selected one mutation from each of these three domains to examine the effect on lysosome tubules: R155H, R191Q and A232E. R155 is the most common hereditary mutation and is located in the CDC48 homology domain, which is a protein interaction module that plays an important role in VCP substrate binding (<a href=\"#bib18\">Ju and Weihl, 2010</a>). R191 is located in the linker region between the CDC48 domain and the first ATPase catalytic domain (D1). A232 is located at the beginning the of the D1 domain and is the most severe clinical mutation (<a href=\"#bib45\">Watts et al., 2004</a>). All three residues are conserved in the <i>Drosophila</i> protein (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). As a control, we show that over-expression of wild type <i>dVCP</i> does not alter tubular lysosomes (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). We then demonstrate that over-expression of each of the mutant <i>VCP</i> transgenes profoundly impairs the tubular lysosomal network (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C\u2013F</a>). In parallel, we find an increase in sarcoplasmic auto-fluorescence when these <i>VCP</i> mutants are over-expressed (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B\u2013G</a>). Overexpression of the A229E mutation, which is the most severe clinical mutation, caused the largest increase in auto-fluorescence compared to the other clinical mutations (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>). Because over-expression of the disease relevant VCP transgenes phenocopies <i>VCP-RNAi</i> expression, these data suggest that the disease mutations are dominant interfering mutations. Thus, overexpression of <i>VCP</i> disease-associated mutations disrupts lysosome tubules in vivo, an effect that causes accumulation of cytoplasmic lipofuscin granules."

To our knowledge, this is the first observation of such an extensive, dynamic tubular lysosomal network in any in vivo system. We define this as a lysosomal network because it has a low pH, it is labeled by the late endosomal marker Spin-GFP, does not co-localize with the ER, golgi apparatus, early endosomes or recycling endosomes, and we find that mCherry-Atg8 traffics to this compartment, indicative of autophagosome fusion with a network of tubular lysosomes. Lysosomal network dynamics require an intact microtubule cytoskeleton, clathrin heavy chain, and VCP. We provide evidence that the catalytic activity of VCP is continuously required to sustain network integrity. When VCP is depleted or inhibited, the lysosomal network collapses and both cellular proteostasis and autophagy are compromised. Collapse of the network correlates with cellular manifestations of VCP-associated degenerative diseases, including the appearance of protein inclusion bodies (<a href=\"#bib21\">Kimonis et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Weihl et al., 2009</a>). While many questions remain unanswered, our discovery of tubular lysosome dysfunction following overexpression of pathogenic VCP mutants represents one the earliest markers of VCP-dependent muscle pathology. Further characterization could pave the way toward methods that might beneficially stabilize lysosomal function and ameliorate the progression of widespread degenerative disease."

In fact, basal autophagy is required to maintain muscle mass (<a href=\"#bib25\">Masiero et al., 2009</a>). The constitutive levels of autophagy in muscle are likely related to the large energy requirement of muscles compared to other cell types and their ability to serve as a source of metabolic energy for other organs (<a href=\"#bib35\">Sandri, 2010</a>). Muscle sarcoplasms are also unique in that they are shared between multiple nuclei and are much larger in volume compared to many other cell types. We propose that the observed extended, lysosomal network that is maintained by VCP is a cellular solution to ensure highly efficient autophagy throughout the entirety of muscle sarcoplasms. It is as if the lysosomes vascularize the sarcoplasm, ensuring that no portion of the sarcoplasm is ever far from a lysosomal depot where autophagic cargo can be degraded. Likewise, this network could facilitate the local recycling of nutrients throughout the sarcoplasm to effectively meet local demands. A similar argument can be made regarding the autophagy-dependent turnover of mitochondria, which are densely distributed throughout the muscle. In support of this, VCP is critical for the rapid degradation of muscle proteins during muscle atrophy and expression of a dominant negative form of VCP reduces protein degradation by both proteasomes and lysosomes (<a href=\"#bib30\">Piccirillo and Goldberg, 2012</a>)."

It is possible that the extended, dynamic lysosomal tubule network that we observe is related to ALR, perhaps acting as a platform for efficient ALR throughout the sarcoplasm. In support of this, the mammalian <i>Spinster</i> homolog is required for ALR (<a href=\"#bib33\">Rong et al., 2011</a>). However, the relatively low frequency with which we observed scission events and the formation of new small lysosome vesicles is not entirely consistent with this idea."

Macrophage lysosome tubules can form a web of tubules that appear to be stably connected throughout the cytoplasm (<a href=\"#bib37\">Swanson et al., 1987b</a>). The purpose of lysosome tubules in this system is still mysterious. We have now identified specific defects associated with loss of lysosome tubules and our data suggest that the tubular network may distribute auto-lysosomal activity throughout the cell. Clues to the function of tubular lysosomes might also be gleaned from studies of early endosomes. Early endosomes form vesicular-tubular structures similar to what we have observed here (<a href=\"#bib16\">Huotari and Helenius, 2011</a>). In early endosomes it has been established that tubules can be discrete membrane compartments with a different lipid composition and cargo compared to that within the vesicular body of the early endosome (<a href=\"#bib16\">Huotari and Helenius, 2011</a>). By analogy, the ability of lysosomes to exist in a tubular-vesicular state in cellular contexts where their functional demand is high, might allow lysosomes to execute diverse functions more efficiently through compartmentalization."

VCP achieves these diverse activities, in part, through its generalized function as an ubiquitin-dependent \u2018segregase\u2019 that dissociates protein conjugates tagged with ubiquitin from protein complexes and organelle membranes (<a href=\"#bib14\">Halawani and Latterich, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Meyer et al., 2012</a>). For each process that relies upon VCP activity, different cofactors control VCP localization and function (<a href=\"#bib2\">Baek et al., 2013</a>). To this list of VCP-mediated activities, we now add the action of VCP in controlling the integrity and dynamics of a tubular lysosomal system and fusion of autophagosomes with tubular lysosomes. Additional, future experimentation will be necessary to determine which specific VCP-mediated molecular mechanism(s) is most directly relevant to the integrity and dynamics of lysosomal tubules in muscle."

                                "text": "The phenotypic consequences following the loss or inhibition of VCP in <i>Drosophila</i> muscle include the collapse of the tubular lysosomal network, failed fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes, accumulation of sarcoplasmic poly-ubiquitin aggregates, accumulation of lipofuscin granules, impaired mitochondria and impaired muscle health. All of these phenotypes are hallmarks of degenerative diseases that are associated with mutations in VCP (<a href=\"#bib45\">Watts et al., 2004</a>). We can now ascribe some of these phenotypes to the action of VCP at lysosomal membranes. Our data indicate that VCP localizes to autolysosomes and loss of VCP causes collapse of the tubular lysosomal network and failed autophagosome-lysosome fusion. Furthermore, when previously sequestered VCP is released back into the cytoplasm, VCP translocates to dormant autolysosomes and tubulation ensues. Although we cannot distinguish the role of VCP in the initiation and/or maintenance of lysosome tubules, these data argue that VCP acts at the autolysosmal membrane to control autolysosomal dynamics and the progression of autophagic protein clearance. If VCP is necessary for normal activity of the autophagy-lysosome system in muscle as our data suggests, then it seems likely that the accumulation of poly-ubiquitin aggregates and lipofuscin granules are a direct consequence of impaired VCP-dependent lysosomal function. This assertion is further supported by our demonstration that over-expression of pathogenic <i>VCP</i> mutant transgenes disrupt the tubular lysosomal network and also cause accumulation of ubiquitin and lipofuscin material. Importantly, these transgenes in <i>Drosophila</i> do not appear to disrupt VCP roles in the UPS or ERAD pathways, emphasizing the role of impaired autophagy in pathogenic VCP phenotypes (<a href=\"#bib42\">Tresse et al., 2010b</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Chang et al., 2011</a>). We acknowledge that lipofuscin granule accumulation following overexpression of pathogenic <i>VCP</i> mutant transgenes could represent a byproduct of proteotoxic stress caused by defects in the UPS or autophagy/lysosome pathways that eventually lead to the transformation of proteins into non-degradable products. Ultimately, more detailed biochemical analyses will be required to elucidate precisely how VCP functions at lysosome membranes and how this activity might be coordinated with other aspects of VCP function throughout the cell. Taken together, our identification of tubular lysosomes in <i>Drosophila</i> muscle challenges the traditional view of vesicular lysosomes and suggests that lysosome structures can be more versatile than previously assumed. Understanding how lysosomes regulate their morphological state will be an exciting avenue for future studies."

This remarkable architecture of the lysosomal system requires the AAA-ATPase Valosyl Containing Protein (VCP), mutations of which are implicated in human degenerative disease. Deletion of VCP (or its replacement with disease-relevant mutants) results in disassembly of the lysosomal tubular network and in a series of defects, including defective autophagy and poly-ubiquitin aggregation, linking this unique architecture of the lysosomal system to maintenance of cellular quality control."

The vacuolar H+ ATPase (V-ATPase) mediates acidification of lysosomes. Do V-ATPase inhibitors such as concanamycin and Bafilomycin A dissipate the internal acidity of the network? We feel that these experiments should suffice to demonstrate the importance of acidification. However, regarding pH, while lysotracker suggests that this compartment is acidic, it does not allow a precise determination of pH values. Precise measurement of pH may be technically challenging and documenting regional differences not of significant additional value. But, if feasible and the authors wish to embark on this direction, they could employ ratiometric GFP constructs or, alternatively, Lysosensor dyes. By building a calibration curve and interpolating the value, they should be able to come up with a precise value (possibly matching the lysosomal internal pH, which is within the 4.0-5.0 range) and also determine whether pH is homogeneous throughout the network or if subregions with different acidity values exist."

We now state, \u201cVCP and the yeast homologue Cdc48 have been ascribed many functions within the cell including cell cycle progression (<a href=\"#bib28\">Moir et al., 1982</a>), UPS and ERAD protein degradation (<a href=\"#bib26\">Meyer et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Wolf and Stolz, 2012</a>), mitophagy (<a href=\"#bib40\">Taylor and Rutter, 2011</a>) and classical autophagy (<a href=\"#bib7\">Dargemont and Ossareh-Nazari, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Ju et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Meyer et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Tresse et al., 2010a</a>)\u2026 To this list of VCP-mediated activities we now add the action of VCP in controlling the integrity and dynamics of a tubular lysosomal system and fusion of autophagosomes with tubular lysosomes. Additional, future experimentation will be necessary to determine which specific VCP-mediated molecular mechanism(s) is most directly relevant to the integrity and dynamics of lysosomal tubules in muscle\u201d (subsection \u201cConsequences of tubular lysosome dysfunction\u201d)."

These data significantly extend our understanding of the tubular lysosomal network within the complex muscle sarcoplasm. As a note to the reviewers, golgi organization in skeletal muscle is distinct from the classical golgi stacks observed in many cells. Vertebrate muscle shows a unique, distributed, vesicular organization of the golgi throughout the muscle (Ralston et al., J. Neurosci., 2001).

Precise measurement of pH may be technically challenging and documenting regional differences not of significant additional value. But, if feasible and the authors wish to embark on this direction, they could employ ratiometric GFP constructs or, alternatively, Lysosensor dyes. By building a calibration curve and interpolating the value, they should be able to come up with a precise value (possibly matching the lysosomal internal pH, which is within the 4.0-5.0 range) and also determine whether pH is homogeneous throughout the network or if subregions with different acidity values exist</i>."
