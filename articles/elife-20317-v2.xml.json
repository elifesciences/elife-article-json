In natural situations, agents may have a priori on their preferences that create default policies and shape the neural comparison process. We asked participants to make choices between items belonging to different categories (e.g., jazz vs. rock music). Behavioral data confirmed that the items taken from the preferred category were chosen more often and more rapidly, which qualified them as default options. FMRI data showed that baseline activity in classical brain valuation regions, such as the ventromedial Prefrontal Cortex (vmPFC), reflected the strength of prior preferences. In addition, evoked activity in the same regions scaled with the default option value, irrespective of the eventual choice. We therefore suggest that in the brain valuation system, choices are framed as comparisons between default and alternative options, which might save some resource but induce a decision bias."

In natural situations, agents may have a priori on their preferences that create default policies and shape the neural comparison process. We asked participants to make choices between items belonging to different categories (e.g., jazz vs. rock music). Behavioral data confirmed that the items taken from the preferred category were chosen more often and more rapidly, which qualified them as default options. FMRI data showed that baseline activity in classical brain valuation regions, such as the ventromedial Prefrontal Cortex (vmPFC), reflected the strength of prior preferences. In addition, evoked activity in the same regions scaled with the default option value, irrespective of the eventual choice. We therefore suggest that in the brain valuation system, choices are framed as comparisons between default and alternative options, which might save some resource but induce a decision bias."

Baseline vmPFC activity is higher for members of the preferred category, giving these options a head start over the alternatives. Asking volunteers to choose between other types of objects, including food and magazines, produced similar results. The brain thus uses a general strategy for decision-making that saves time and effort, but which also introduces bias.

Understanding the neural mechanisms governing this valuation/selection process has become a central aim in the field of decision neuroscience. A large set of fMRI evidence points to the ventro-medial Prefrontal Cortex (vmPFC) as a key player in the valuation process (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bartra et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Clithero and Rangel, 2014</a>). Neural activity in the vmPFC reflects subjective values, either measured with likeability ratings or inferred from binary choices (<a href=\"#bib22\">Kable and Glimcher, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Rangel and Hare, 2010</a>). In accordance with the idea of a common neural currency (<a href=\"#bib30\">Levy and Glimcher, 2012</a>), the vmPFC was found to encode the subjective value of many kinds of goods, such as food, money, trinkets, faces, paintings, charities, etc. (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chib et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Hare et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Lebreton et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Plassmann et al., 2007</a>). Such value coding was observed not only during choice but also in the absence of choice, during passive viewing of items presented in the attentional focus or when performing a distractive task on these items (<a href=\"#bib29\">Lebreton et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Levy et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Abitbol et al., 2015</a>)."

However, the framing of such decision value signal, i.e. what A and B actually represent, remains an unresolved issue. This question is of importance because the brain regions downstream in the decision process cannot operate the appropriate selection without knowing which option is favored by the relative value signal. In particular, the post-decisional frame that has often been reported (<a href=\"#bib5\">Boorman et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Hare et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Hunt et al., 2012</a>) provides a decision value signal between chosen and unchosen options (V<sub>ch</sub>-V<sub>unch</sub>) that cannot be used for making the selection. A spatial frame, based on the location of options (e.g., V<sub>left</sub>-V<sub>right</sub>), has been suggested but not supported by much experimental evidence regarding the vmPFC valuation signal (<a href=\"#bib35\">Palminteri et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Wunderlich et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Skvortsova et al., 2014</a>). A more promising suggestion is the attentional frame (<a href=\"#bib24\">Krajbich et al., 2010</a>), in which the decision value signal encoded in the vmPFC depends on which option is attended to (V<sub>att</sub>-V<sub>unatt</sub>). Such framing provided a good account for vmPFC activity in a choice task where fixation patterns were imposed to subjects, and correctly predicted several features of spontaneous choice behavior by imposing a discount weight on the unattended option value (<a href=\"#bib24\">Krajbich et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Lim et al., 2011</a>). Notably, the attentional frame predicts that more fixated options should be more frequently chosen, which might explain why vmPFC activity has been found to correlate with V<sub>ch</sub>-V<sub>unch</sub> in other studies. However, the attentional model assumes that visual exploration is random, which might be true in artificial laboratory tasks where subjects have no information about upcoming options, but not in natural situations where prior knowledge might play a role."

In other words, vmPFC activity should scale positively with the value of the option that is preferred a priori, which we call the default option, and negatively with that of the alternative (V<sub>def</sub>-V<sub>alt</sub>). This hypothesis is compatible with the observation that vmPFC activity correlates with V<sub>ch</sub>-V<sub>unch</sub>, since choices usually follows on prior preferences. Yet, the interpretation is fundamentally different, as V<sub>def</sub>-V<sub>alt</sub> is a pre-decisional value signal susceptible to drive option selection. Our hypothesis builds on the literature about optimal foraging, which argues that stay/switch choice is the natural case of decision-making (<a href=\"#bib50\">Stephens and Krebs, 1986</a>). In this framework, staying on a same patch is the default option against which all alternatives must be compared. Several studies investigated such stay/switch decisions and implicated the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex in promoting a shift away from the default option (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hayden et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Kolling et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Kvitsiani et al., 2013</a>), while others induced default policies by manipulating prior probabilities of being correct (<a href=\"#bib5\">Boorman et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Fleming et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Mulder et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Scheibe et al., 2010</a>). Although experimental manipulations vary across these studies, the default option is always defined as the option that would be selected in the absence of further information processing about its value relative to the alternatives. This definition provides objective criteria to identify the default option in a choice set: it should be selected faster and more frequently than the alternatives."

The purpose of the present study was to examine how these two constraints would shape the brain valuation signal. To do so, we exploited the hierarchical structure of preferences: individuals have global preferences between categories of goods that can be locally reversed when comparing particular items. For instance, someone may prefer pop to jazz music in general, but nonetheless pick Keith Jarrett if the only other option is Britney Spears. In a binary choice, the prior preference at the category level thus designates a default option (i.e., the item belonging to the preferred category), but the option values still need to be compared at the item level in order to reach a final decision."

In the following analyses, we first establish the presence of a bias toward the default option in both choice and response time, above and beyond the prior preference between categories. Using computational modeling, we provide evidence that the default bias is best accounted for by a shift in the starting point of a drift diffusion process, which is proportional to the prior preference between categories. Then, we show that the default bias is unrelated to gaze fixation pattern, precluding an attentional framing. Finally, we uncover two effects of prior preference in fMRI data: (1) vmPFC baseline activity reflects the a priori shift in favor of the default option, and (2) vmPFC evoked response represents the value of the default option, irrespective of the eventual choice."

Each domain included four categories of 36 items (see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods). At that time, participants were unaware of these categories. This is because the presentation of items for likeability ratings was blocked by domain but not by categories, which were randomly intermixed. During the scanning session, subjects performed series of choices between two items (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>), knowing that one choice in each domain would be randomly selected at the end of the experiment and that they would stay in the lab for another 15 min to enjoy their reward (listening to the selected CD, eating the selected food and reading the selected magazine). Trials were blocked in a\u00a0series of nine choices between items belonging to the same two categories within a same domain. The two categories were announced at the beginning of the block, such that subjects could form a prior preference (although they were not explicitly asked to do so). We quantified this prior preference as the difference between mean likeability ratings (across all items within each of the two categories), which is hereafter denoted as DV<sub>CAT</sub>. In most cases (84\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03% on average), preferences inferred from mean ratings matched the preferences between categories that subjects directly expressed in post-scanning debriefing tasks. Moreover, the confidence in these choices between categories, which subjects provided on an analog rating scale during debriefing, was significantly correlated to DV<sub>CAT\u00a0</sub>(r\u00a0=\u00a00.44\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.06, t(23)\u00a0=\u00a07.88, p\u00a0=\u00a05.10<sup>\u22128</sup>). These explicit measures taken after the scanning session therefore validate our quantification of implicit preferences between categories. In the following, we analyze choices and response times to assess the presence of a bias in favor of the default option (i.e., the item belonging to the preferred category)."

Regression coefficient estimates showed that the two option values were equally contributive to the choice (V<sub>IT</sub>(def): \u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.060\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.005, t(23)\u00a0=\u00a011.90, p\u00a0=\u00a03.10<sup>\u221211</sup>; V<sub>IT</sub>(alt): \u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.060\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.004, t(23)\u00a0=\u00a0\u221214.21, p\u00a0=\u00a07.10<sup>\u221213</sup>). Crucially, the constant was significantly positive (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.68\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.13, t(23)\u00a0=\u00a05.40, p\u00a0=\u00a02.10<sup>\u22125</sup>), bringing evidence for a bias toward the default option. This constant was significantly reduced when including DV<sub>CAT\u00a0</sub>in the regression model (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.31\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.16, t(23)\u00a0=\u00a01.94, p\u00a0=\u00a00.06), with the effect of DV<sub>CAT</sub> itself being significant (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.021\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.006, t(23)\u00a0=\u00a03.53, p\u00a0=\u00a02.10<sup>\u22123</sup>), which established a direct link between prior preference and default bias. We also introduced past choices (coded 1 vs. \u22121 when default option was chosen vs. unchosen) in the regression model but they yielded no significant effect on choice rate. Consistently, the constant estimate was not different when restricting the logistic regression to the first choice in a block (\u03b2<sub>first\u00a0</sub>=\u00a00.58\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.49, \u03b2<sub>all</sub>\u00a0=\u00a00.68\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.13, difference: t(23)\u00a0=\u00a00.97 p\u00a0=\u00a00.44), confirming that the default bias was not resulting from the history of past choices. To illustrate this result (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), we plotted the choice rate, P(def), as a function of the decision value, DV<sub>IT</sub>=V<sub>IT</sub>(def)-V<sub>IT</sub>(alt). This plot shows that even when the two options have the same value (DV<sub>IT</sub>\u00a0=\u00a00 on the x-axis), the choice rate is not at chance level (50% on the y-axis), which would denote indifference, but shifted toward the default option (by 15.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.7% on average). Thus, these results provide behavioral evidence for a \u2018choice bias\u2019 occurring on top of the decision value (DV<sub>IT</sub>), i.e. above and beyond what could be predicted by the difference in likeability rating."

The DDM assumes that choices result from a sequential sampling process, through which a decision variable accumulates evidence until it reaches a boundary (<a href=\"#bib41\">Ratcliff, 1978</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Ratcliff and McKoon, 2008</a>). DDMs were originally developed to explain perceptual decisions but they have already been successfully applied to economic (value-based) decisions (<a href=\"#bib15\">Gold and Shadlen, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Basten et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Krajbich et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">2012</a>). In our DDM, the boundaries corresponded to the default and alternative choices, and the mean of the drift rate was the signed decision value, DV<sub>IT</sub> (inset in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). A priori, the choice and RT biases could arise from a change in the drift rate or from a shift in the starting point, S. The latter possibility is more consistent with the negative correlation that was observed between choice bias and RT (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>) and tested at the group level (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.68\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.08, t(23)\u00a0=\u00a0\u22128.06, p\u00a0=\u00a04.10<sup>\u22128</sup>).

The first three models (\u2018start family\u2019) test the hypothesis of a shift in the starting point. The shift was captured with a single free parameter in model 1 (\u20181 free S\u2019), with one free parameter per block in model 2 (\u201812 free S\u2019), or as a free parameter scaled by DV<sub>CAT</sub> in model 3 (\u2018S=a*DV<sub>CAT</sub>\u2019). Thus, the starting point was respectively considered constant across blocks (but possibly different from zero), freely adjusted to each block, or proportional to the prior preference.

The most plausible mechanism was the shift in the starting point (start family: exceedance probability, xp\u00a0=\u00a00.997). Then, we compared the three models within this family (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>, bottom) and found evidence in favor of model 3 (xp\u00a0=\u00a00.920), suggesting that the starting point varied across blocks proportionally to prior preferences. We verified this conclusion by testing the correlation across blocks between the posterior means of the 12-free-S model and the prior preference DV<sub>CAT</sub> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>). The correlation was significant at the group level (r\u00a0=\u00a00.35\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.07, t(23)\u00a0=\u00a05.12, p\u00a0=\u00a03.10<sup>\u22125</sup>), strengthening the idea that prior preference was imposing a shift in the starting point that resulted in both choice and RT biases.

We found that the default option was fixated longer when it was chosen (difference: 81\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011 ms, t(22)\u00a0=\u00a07.52, p\u00a0=\u00a02.10<sup>\u22127</sup>). Conversely, it was the alternative option that was fixated longer when the default option was not chosen (difference: 41\u00a0\u00b1\u00a017 ms, t(22)\u00a0=\u00a02.41, p\u00a0=\u00a02.10<sup>\u22122</sup>). Consistently, the ANOVA conducted on fixation time revealed a significant main effect of the \u2018chosen vs. unchosen\u2019 factor (F(1,88)\u00a0=\u00a04.03, p\u00a0=\u00a00.048), but no main effect of the \u2018default vs. alternative\u2019 factor (F(1,88)\u00a0=\u00a00.43, p\u00a0=\u00a00.41). The interaction was significant (F(1,88)\u00a0=\u00a017.45, p\u00a0=\u00a01.10<sup>\u22124</sup>), reflecting the fact that the default option was more frequently chosen, and with larger decision values. Thus, fixation duration was indeed predictive of choice, but was not influenced by prior preference. To control for the dynamics of the decision process, we computed the proportion of fixations for each option at each time point. The time courses locked to stimulus onset revealed a clear preference for looking at the left option during the first 250 ms, and then at the right option during the next 250 ms, but no significant preference for the default option at the beginning of the trial. The time courses locked on the response confirmed the fixation bias toward the chosen option, with a similar pattern whether default or alternative option was chosen (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). This result was further confirmed by a model comparison showing that fixation duration for each option was better explained (xp\u00a0=\u00a00.999) by a GLM including the unsigned decision value and the choice (chosen vs. unchosen option) than by GLMs including an additional regressor that indicated the prior preference (default vs. alternative option)."

The first was the null model, with a starting point S fixed at zero and a weighting factor \u03b8 fixed at one. The second was the sDDM selected as the best model in the first experiment, with S proportional to DV<sub>CAT</sub> and \u03b8 still fixed at one. The third was the standard aDDM, with S fixed at zero and a freely fitted \u03b8. The fourth was termed asDDM and included both S proportional to DV<sub>CAT</sub> and fitted \u03b8. The most plausible model was the asDDM (xp\u00a0=\u00a00.95), with the weight on DV<sub>CAT</sub> significantly above zero (0.02\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.003, t(22)\u00a0=\u00a07.85, p\u00a0=\u00a01.10<sup>\u22126</sup>), and a \u03b8 significantly below one (\u03b8\u00a0=\u00a00.94\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.03, t(22)\u00a0=\u00a02.14 p\u00a0=\u00a00.04). The fits of choice and RT are illustrated for the aDDM and asDDM (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A and B</a>). Although using the fixation pattern (with \u03b8) improved the fit, only the prior preference (with S) could explain the decision bias toward the default option. We reached similar conclusions when the advantage for the attended option was additively included in the drift rate, on top of decision value (as in <a href=\"#bib8\">Cavanagh et al., 2014</a>). In fact, gaze fixation pattern failed to produce the default bias simply because the default option was no more looked at than the alternative option."

In the following we analyze regression coefficient estimates obtained for the indicator function on volumes acquired before and after option display. The contrast performed at the individual level weighted block-specific indicator functions by z-scored DV<sub>CAT</sub>. Group-level statistical test (p&lt;0.005, uncorrected) performed on this contrast for the volume acquired two seconds before option display revealed activity scaling with DV<sub>CAT</sub> in the vmPFC, ventral striatum and left hippocampus (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, left panel), which are regions classically identified as parts of the brain valuation system (e.g., <a href=\"#bib29\">Lebreton et al., 2009</a>).

The difference between high and low DV<sub>CAT</sub> appeared to be maintained during the decision process and to progressively vanish at the end of the trial."

Then we reasoned that the vmPFC might have encoded both option values on top of the decision value, following on the idea that such valuation processes are automatically triggered when stimuli are presented (<a href=\"#bib29\">Lebreton et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Levy et al., 2011</a>). This would imply that vmPFC activity should correlate not only with the difference between option values but also with their sum. The net result would be a correlation with V<sub>IT</sub>(def), since V<sub>IT</sub>(alt) would be subtracted out, which was observed in our analysis. In order to test this hypothesis, we fitted a last variant of GLM2 that included both the difference and sum of option values in the pre-choice frame as parametric modulators of option display. The common variance, linked to the presence of V<sub>IT</sub>(def) in both the sum and difference, was removed such that each regressor had unique variance. We examined the regression estimates extracted from the independent vmPFC ROI and found significant effects for both the difference (\u03b2<sub>def-alt\u00a0</sub>=\u00a00.10\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.04, t(23)\u00a0=\u00a02.74, p\u00a0=\u00a00.01) and the sum (\u03b2<sub>def+alt\u00a0</sub>=\u00a00.14\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.06, t(23)\u00a0=\u00a02.47, p\u00a0=\u00a00.02).

This result suggests that the vmPFC evoked response signals the two option values (sum) on top of the decision value (difference). In macroscopic measures of brain activity such as fMRI, the positive and negative correlation with V<sub>IT</sub>(alt) appear to cancel each other, but these representations might be dissociable using techniques with better spatial resolution that can access microscopic scales."

These choices and RT biases are minimal requirements for a default option, i.e. an option that should be chosen in the absence of further information processing. Such criteria have been used in other paradigms where the goal was to maximize an objective reward, with for instance the default being defined as the pre-selected option in a perceptual decision task (<a href=\"#bib13\">Fleming et al., 2010</a>), as the current patch in a foraging task (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hayden et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Kolling et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Kvitsiani et al., 2013</a>), or as the long-term best option in a probabilistic instrumental learning task (<a href=\"#bib5\">Boorman et al., 2013</a>). These studies reported that when the two option values were similar, subjects (both humans and monkeys) favored the default option. This phenomenon has been coined \u2018default bias\u2019, or \u2018status quo bias\u2019 in cases where the default option was defined as the pre-selected choice. Here, the same phenomenon was observed in the case of subjective preference. Importantly, the default bias was estimated once option values were matched, therefore it goes beyond what could be predicted from the difference in likeability ratings between categories. This bias could lead to preference reversals, meaning that subjects would pick the default option in spite of the alternative option having received a higher rating. Thus, the default bias denotes suboptimal decision-making, which could be compensated by the fact that following a default policy is on average less costly in terms of time or cognitive resource, than a\u00a0systematic unbiased comparison of option values. This phenomenon is therefore much different from the optimal use of prior information that has been observed in a variety of perceptual decision-making paradigms, subjects being biased only when tricked with invalid cues (<a href=\"#bib33\">Link and Heath, 1975</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Bogacz et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Scheibe et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Mulder et al., 2012</a>)."

This is consistent with perceptual decision-making studies showing that prior information on probability or payoff is also incorporated in the starting point (<a href=\"#bib45\">Scheibe et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Summerfield and Koechlin, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Mulder et al., 2012</a>). However, this is not compatible with the idea that the effect of prior preference on choice and RT biases is mediated by the pattern of gaze fixations. This idea implies that subjects pay more attention to the default option, which through the attentional DDM mechanism would favor the default choice, because the attended option has more weight than the alternative in the drift rate. In fact, subjects looked equally often at the default and alternative options in the eye-tracking experiment. Our results nonetheless confirmed that the pattern of gaze fixation does inform the prediction of choices, in a manner that is nicely captured by the attentional DDM. Thus, although the attentional DDM is perfectly compatible with our data, it could not by itself explain the default bias. The best account of choice and RT was in fact obtained with a model that cumulated the down-weighting of unattended options in the drift rate, as suggested by the attentional DDM, and the shift in the starting point that explains the default bias."

A striking parallel was found at the neural level, with the prior preference being reflected in the baseline activity of valuation regions including the vmPFC, ventral striatum and posterior cingulate cortex. This is in line with a previous study showing that baseline vmPFC activity is sensitive to contextual factors, both in humans and monkeys, and provide a bias in subsequent valuation processes (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abitbol et al., 2015</a>). Other contextual manipulations were found to modulate vmPFC activity and subsequent valuation, for instance mood induction has been shown to affect reward-related vmPFC activity (<a href=\"#bib57\">Young and Nusslock, 2016</a>). In contrast, cueing manipulation that affected perceptual decisions through a shift in starting point had no influence on vmPFC activity (<a href=\"#bib45\">Scheibe et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Summerfield and Koechlin, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Mulder et al., 2012</a>). This dissociation suggests that the recruitment of vmPFC was not related to the general process of changing the accumulation starting point, but to biasing value-based decisions (as opposed to perceptual decisions). In fact the shift in baseline vmPFC activity was maintained throughout the decision process, and was hence added to the evoked activity, which followed a canonical hemodynamic response. As both baseline and evoked activity scaled with the value of the default, respectively at the category and item levels, they together contributed to favoring the default option over the alternative. Thus, the mechanics is analog to the DDM process, but the dynamics is somewhat different. In fact, the neural dynamics is not compatible with the vmPFC implementing the DDM, since we observed no ramping signal corresponding to an accumulation-to-bound process; neither is it compatible with the vmPFC output being sent to a distant accumulator, since the shift in starting point should not be integrated over time. Therefore, we do not suggest that the DDM used to capture behavioral patterns is literally implemented as such in the brain, just that the general logics and some key features appeared to match vmPFC activity during choices. We also note that other types of modeling would have been possible to capture behavioral effects, notably a Bayesian account where prior preference would affect the mean and perhaps the variance of a prior distribution on decision value."

This pre-choice framing supports the idea of an anatomical separation between the valuation and selection processes, with the vmPFC being implicated in the former but not the latter. It could be a very general frame for value coding in the vmPFC, because most studies found a correlation between vmPFC activity and the value of chosen options (e.g., <a href=\"#bib19\">Hare et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Boorman et al., 2013</a>), which are partially confounded with default options as we have shown here. We note that an opposite dissociation was found by <a href=\"#bib5\">Boorman et al. (2013)</a>, with the vmPFC encoding option values in post-choice frame, and not pre-choice frame. As decision-making dynamics was not explored in this study, it is unclear whether participants truly implemented a default strategy as defined here, which implies an anticipation of a default response, associated with shortening of response time. Accordingly, the representation of chosen option value was largely delayed in comparison to our study (peaking 10 s after option display), possibly related to the necessity of storing expected values in a learning context."

How the valuation system adapts to artificial economic choices, in which two novel options present themselves simultaneously, still needs to be investigated. One may speculate that the brain would start by defining a default option, and then proceed to the comparison as usual. If this is correct, identifying the trial-wise and/or subject-wise default policy might be essential for understanding how the brain makes value-based decisions. However, we only have a proof of concept here, the generality of the \u2018default vs. alternative framing\u2019 remains to be established. Further research is also required to specify the contribution of the different brain regions that are involved in the valuation and selection processes, notably the dACC. The present results suggest that the vmPFC provides a decision value, which is also represented in the ventral striatum. How such decision value is used by the brain to make a selection remains to be explained."

The 12 categories were: appetizers, biscuits, candies, chocolate (food domain); news, comics, cultural, generalist (magazine domain); French, jazz, rock, urban (music domain). The order of presentation was randomized within each reward domain, such that the\u00a0categories were intermingled. The series of trials consisted of displaying pictures of the items one by one on the computer screen. A pseudo-continuous rating scale (101 points) was presented below the picture, with three reference graduations (do not like at all, neutral, like a lot). Subjects could move a cursor along the scale by pressing a key with the right index finger to go left or another key with the right middle finger to go right. The cursor was initially positioned at the middle of the rating scale. The\u00a0rating was self-paced and subjects had to press a button with the left hand to validate their response and proceed to the next trial.

To generate the series of choices for each opposition, items were sorted in the order of likeability rating. Half the choices varied the difference between ratings while keeping the average constant (item ranked mean+X was paired with item ranked mean-X); the other half varied the average while keeping the difference minimal (item ranked X was paired with item ranked X-1). Thus, the mean value and relative value of choice options were orthogonalized. A total of 36 choices were generated for each inter-categorical opposition, and presented in a randomized order.

Interleaved 2 mm slices separated by a 1.5 mm gap and oriented along a 30\u00b0 tilted plane were acquired to cover the whole brain with a repetition time of 2.01 s. The first five scans were discarded to allow for equilibration effects. All analyses were performed using statistical parametric mapping (SPM8, RRID:<a href=\"https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_007037\">SCR_007037</a>) environment (Wellcome Trust Center for NeuroImaging, London, UK). Structural T1-weighted images were coregistered with the mean EPI, segmented, and normalized to the standard Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) T1 template. Normalized T1-images were averaged across subjects to localize group-level functional activations by superimposition. During preprocessing, EPIs were spatially realigned, normalized (using the same transformation as for structural images), and smoothed with an 8 mm full-width at half-maximum Gaussian kernel."

The different blocks were modeled in separate regressors, each being parametrically modulated by the two option values (default and alternative). For each time point, we computed a contrast that weighted all trials of a given block by the corresponding prior preference (DV<sub>CAT</sub>).

The stick function was parametrically modulated by five variables: chosen option (default or alternative), V<sub>IT</sub>(def) when default chosen, V<sub>IT</sub>(alt) when default chosen, V<sub>IT</sub>(def) when default unchosen and V<sub>IT</sub>(alt) when default unchosen. This allowed computing orthogonal contrasts for the decision value in the pre-choice (default vs. alternative) and post-choice (chosen vs. unchosen) frames. The regressors were convolved with a canonical HRF to localize brain regions where the evoked response reflected the decision value. In a subsequent analysis the same regressors were convolved with the same FIR as used for GLM0, in order to examine the dynamics of value coding in regions of interest (ROI)."

This was meant to assess whether value representation concerned only one option or the difference between the two, and whether it was expressed in a pre-choice or post-choice frame. All models were fitted to individual time-series extracted from vmPFC and dACC ROI, so as to compute group-level exceedance probabilities, following a BMS procedure similar to that used for behavioral data analysis."

They explain this as a change in starting point of the drift diffusion model. They then use eye-tracking to show that this bias is not explained directly as a consequence of the subjects attending more towards the default item, but instead as a combination of attentional effects on drift rate and a shift in the starting point. Perhaps most strikingly, they show that the default value is present in vmPFC baseline activity, prior to the trial beginning. The key idea is to test whether activity which is often found to reflect chosen minus unchosen value is better thought of as reflecting the value of the default option. They find evidence that this is the case in VMPFC, but not dACC. Overall, this paper addresses a very timely research question, the representation of (choice-related) valuation signals in vmPFC."

They report that people look longer at the default option if it is chosen (with a difference of 81 ms), but they look longer at the other option if this is chosen (with a difference of only 41ms). I think the critical question is whether this 81 vs. 41 ms difference is significant or not. In other words, one could set up an ANOVA with factors \"Default vs. Non-Default\" and \"Chosen vs. Unchosen\". Apparently, the \"Chosen vs. Unchosen\" main effect in such an ANOVA would be significant. Now the question is whether the \"Default vs. Non-Default\" main effect would also be significant or not.

My concern is that a simpler model could potentially explain much of the gaze data, whereby there could be a direct effect of gaze on choice \u2013 where more looking is predictive of higher probability of choice (regardless of direction of causality) \u2013 here, gaze time is additive to the value effects on drift rate, rather than multiplicative as in aDDM. (See Cavanagh et al., 2014 JEP-G for an example of where this additive model provided a better fit than the aDDM; Krajbich/Rangel never tested this simpler model). My worry here is that if subjects attend more to the default option than the non-default option, that this could directly drive drift toward the default. That wouldn't show up as well when fitting the aDDM because it assumes that attention modulates the value, but behavioral data show that there is a bias in choice independent of value, so the authors still need the added starting point bias independent of gaze. But if the subjects just look at the default more, and looking directly predicts choice independent of value, then they might find that the default bias is entirely accounted for by more looking\u2026 It would be better if the authors added this direct effect as another model in their model comparison (and perhaps a model with this direct effect plus starting point bias). Still, even if this is the case, I'm not sure it diminishes the contribution in terms of what it tells us about vmPFC or default biases (especially since it would be the default preference that would drive the bias in looking, not the other way around)."

Another way of showing it would be to plot <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a> without absoluting the X-axis (i.e. plot positive and negative values for VIT(def)-VIT(alt), as in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>)."

My concern is that a simpler model could potentially explain much of the gaze data, whereby there could be a direct effect of gaze on choice \u2013 where more looking is predictive of higher probability of choice (regardless of direction of causality) \u2013 here, gaze time is additive to the value effects on drift rate, rather than multiplicative as in aDDM. (See Cavanagh et al., 2014 JEP-G for an example of where this additive model provided a better fit than the aDDM; Krajbich/Rangel never tested this simpler model). My worry here is that if subjects attend more to the default option than the non-default option, that this could directly drive drift toward the default. That wouldn't show up as well when fitting the aDDM because it assumes that attention modulates the value, but behavioral data show that there is a bias in choice independent of value, so the authors still need the added starting point bias independent of gaze. But if the subjects just look at the default more, and looking directly predicts choice independent of value, then they might find that the default bias is entirely accounted for by more looking\u2026 It would be better if the authors added this direct effect as another model in their model comparison (and perhaps a model with this direct effect plus starting point bias). Still, even if this is the case, I'm not sure it diminishes the contribution in terms of what it tells us about vmPFC or default biases (especially since it would be the default preference that would drive the bias in looking, not the other way around).</i>"
