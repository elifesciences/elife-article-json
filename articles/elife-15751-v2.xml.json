Here we describe an assay to measure neuronal GIRK2 activity as a function of membrane-anchored G protein concentration. Using this assay we show that four G\u03b2\u03b3 subunits bind cooperatively to open GIRK2, and that intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> \u2013 which enters neurons during action potentials \u2013 further amplifies opening mostly by increasing G\u03b2\u03b3 affinity. A Na<sup>+</sup> amplification function is characterized and used to estimate the concentration of G\u03b2\u03b3 subunits that appear in the membrane of mouse dopamine neurons when GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors are stimulated. We conclude that GIRK2, through its dual responsiveness to G\u03b2\u03b3 and Na<sup>+</sup>, mediates a form of neuronal inhibition that is amplifiable in the setting of excess electrical activity."

Here we describe an assay to measure neuronal GIRK2 activity as a function of membrane-anchored G protein concentration. Using this assay we show that four G\u03b2\u03b3 subunits bind cooperatively to open GIRK2, and that intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> \u2013 which enters neurons during action potentials \u2013 further amplifies opening mostly by increasing G\u03b2\u03b3 affinity. A Na<sup>+</sup> amplification function is characterized and used to estimate the concentration of G\u03b2\u03b3 subunits that appear in the membrane of mouse dopamine neurons when GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors are stimulated. We conclude that GIRK2, through its dual responsiveness to G\u03b2\u03b3 and Na<sup>+</sup>, mediates a form of neuronal inhibition that is amplifiable in the setting of excess electrical activity."

This process often involves members of a large family of proteins called G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that are found on the surface of many cells in the body. When these receptors are activated they release a G protein on the inside of the cell that then splits into two parts. One of these parts \u2013 called the G\u03b2\u03b3 subunit \u2013 can directly bind to, and open, a protein channel called a GIRK channel in the cell membrane. Once opened, these channels allow potassium ions to flow into the cell."

Many aspects of how these ligands interact with the channel, whether they are absolutely required for channel opening, and how they interact with each other through their respective interactions with the channel have remained unclear. Some studies supported an absolute requirement for G\u03b2\u03b3 subunits (<a href=\"#bib13\">Logothetis et al., 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Wickman et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Krapivinsky et al., 1995</a>), while others concluded that Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ATP with Na<sup>+</sup> (<a href=\"#bib19\">Petit-Jacques et al., 1999</a>) or PIP<sub>2</sub> (<a href=\"#bib5\">Huang et al., 1998</a>) were by themselves sufficient to open GIRK channels in the absence of G\u03b2\u03b3 subunits. Furthermore, attempts to determine G\u03b2\u03b3 affinity for GIRK channels in cell membranes, assessed by applying detergent-solubilized G\u03b2\u03b3 to membrane patches, yielded values ranging from 3 nM to 125 nM (<a href=\"#bib33\">Wickman et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Krapivinsky et al., 1995</a>). The problem with these studies is the membrane partition coefficient for detergent-solubilized G\u03b2\u03b3 is not known and therefore the membrane concentration is not known. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) measurements with a soluble form of G\u03b2\u03b3 (lipid anchor-removed) and a soluble cytoplasmic domain of a GIRK channel (removed from the transmembrane pore) measured the affinity to be 250\u2009\u03bcM (<a href=\"#bib34\">Yokogawa et al., 2011</a>). These experiments can only report binding affinity in the absence of energetic coupling to a gated pore, which was absent in the experiment."

Using planar lipid bilayers in which purified GIRK2 channels, G protein subunits and PIP<sub>2</sub> were reconstituted, we found that G\u03b2\u03b3 subunits and PIP<sub>2</sub> are simultaneously required to open GIRK2 channels (each alone is insufficient) and that Na<sup>+</sup> is not required for opening, but modulates GIRK2 channel opening.

Modified G\u03b2\u03b3 subunits with a His-tag replacing the lipid anchor on the \u03b3 subunit were then added at known concentrations to the solution on one side of the membrane with the idea that these would anchor to the membrane via the Ni-NTA lipid (<a href=\"#bib9\">Kubalek et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Schmitt et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Knecht et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Platt et al., 2010</a>). All experiments were carried out in the presence of a fixed concentration of 32\u2009\u03bcM C8-PIP<sub>2</sub> to ensure high occupation of PIP<sub>2</sub> sites on the channel: 32\u2009\u03bcM C8-PIP<sub>2</sub>, based on channel activity measurements, corresponds to 0.02 mol fraction (2%) membrane PIP<sub>2</sub> (<a href=\"#bib30\">Wang et al., 2014</a>). Example data using this assay are shown (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). In the absence of Ni-NTA lipid, addition of soluble G\u03b2\u03b3 with a His-10 tag (sG\u03b2\u03b3-His10) to a solution concentration of 2\u2009\u03bcM failed to activate the channel. The presence of channels in the membrane was subsequently confirmed by addition of a maximally effective (but unknown) concentration of lipid-anchored G\u03b2\u03b3 through vesicle fusion with the membrane. In another experiment, when the same concentration of sG\u03b2\u03b3-His10 was added to a membrane formed with 0.0019 mol fraction Ni-NTA (19 out of 10,000 lipid molecules in the membrane containing the Ni-NTA head group), channels were activated (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Subsequent addition of excess lipid-anchored G\u03b2\u03b3 to the same membrane showed that about 60% of the GIRK channels had been activated by the Ni-NTA lipid-anchored G\u03b2\u03b3. All further experiments were performed in the manner described, ending with saturation of the membrane with G\u03b2\u03b3 to achieve maximal activation of the GIRK channels present. This normalization step enables comparison of currents measured in different membranes with different numbers of GIRK channels by placing them on a common scale (normalized current)."

First, sG\u03b2\u03b3-His10 binds from solution to the Ni-NTA lipid, and second, the sG\u03b2\u03b3-His10-Ni-NTA lipid complex binds to the channel. We are ultimately interested in the second reaction as this determines channel activation as a function of G\u03b2\u03b3 concentration on the membrane (G\u03b2\u03b3 density in 2 dimensions). In <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a> the black symbols and curve show the normalized GIRK current level as a function of sG\u03b2\u03b3-His10 solution concentration with a membrane containing Ni-NTA lipid at a mole fraction 0.0019. Normalized currents under these conditions reach a maximum value around 0.6 (60% of current that is reached when the same membranes are saturated with lipid-anchored G\u03b2\u03b3). A maximum, saturated value below 1.0 can be explained if 2\u2009\u03bcM sG\u03b2\u03b3-His10 is sufficient to occupy all Ni-NTA lipid molecules in the membrane, but the concentration of Ni-NTA lipid in the membrane is too low to occupy all sites on the channel. This explanation is supported by the graph on the right (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>) in which normalized current is plotted as a function of Ni-NTA lipid mole fraction in the presence of 2\u2009\u03bcM sG\u03b2\u03b3-His10 (i.e. a concentration that is sufficient to occupy all Ni-NTA lipid molecules). This graph is asymptotic to ~1 at higher values of Ni-NTA lipid mole fraction, and, as one would expect, 0.6 on the Y-axis corresponds to 0.0019 on the X-axis.

The normalized current level is asymptotic to a value higher than 0.6 (blue curve). The explanation for this becomes evident when the (apparent) Ni-NTA lipid mole fraction is plotted against the corresponding (blue dashed lines) sG\u03b2\u03b3-His concentration (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, blue symbols and curve): in this binding isotherm the affinity is lower and the maximum apparent Ni-NTA lipid mole fraction is ~3 times higher. This result follows if sG\u03b2\u03b3-His4 binds to a single Ni-NTA lipid and sG\u03b2\u03b3-His10 binds to 3 Ni-NTA lipids. This stoichiometric difference is consistent with known structures of Ni-NTA-polyhistidine complexes, which show that a single Ni-NTA group is coordinated by 2 histidine residues separated by at least one histidine residue (<a href=\"#bib7\">Knecht et al., 2009</a>). Thus, sG\u03b2\u03b3-His4 can only attach to a single Ni-NTA lipid while sG\u03b2\u03b3-His10 can - and does - attach to three."

                                "text": "Having established an assay to control the concentration of G\u03b2\u03b3 in the membrane, we measured the activity of GIRK2 as a function of membrane G\u03b2\u03b3 concentration as well as solution Na<sup>+</sup> concentration (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). At each Na<sup>+</sup> concentration, normalized current increases as a steep sigmoidal function of membrane G\u03b2\u03b3 concentration (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). The slope of these functions on a log-log plot at sufficiently low G\u03b2\u03b3 concentrations (achieved in these experiments for the G\u03b2\u03b3 titrations at lower Na<sup>+</sup> concentrations) are consistent with four G\u03b2\u03b3 subunits being required to open a GIRK2 channel (see methods) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). A strong effect of Na<sup>+</sup> on the functional relationship is clear and noteworthy because in cells Na<sup>+</sup> is known to regulate GIRK currents, but by a mechanism that is unknown (<a href=\"#bib28\">Sui et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Ho and Murrell-Lagnado, 1999b</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Petit-Jacques et al., 1999</a>). The titrations show that G\u03b2\u03b3 activates the channel to a greater extent, especially at lower G\u03b2\u03b3 concentrations, as Na<sup>+</sup> is increased (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). To further understand how these two ligands interact with the channel to regulate its gating we constructed an equilibrium model. This model was guided by atomic structures, which show that a tetramer GIRK2 channel has 4 structurally identical G\u03b2\u03b3 binding sites and 4 Na<sup>+</sup> binding sites (<a href=\"#bib32\">Whorton and MacKinnon, 2013</a>). The model contains 25 states, corresponding to an order-independent occupation number 0 to 4 for each ligand (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Fitted parameters in the model include a dissociation constant and cooperativity factor for each ligand, a cross cooperativity factor between G\u03b2\u03b3 and Na<sup>+</sup> and a parameter relating ligand occupancy to channel activity (see <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The data and modeling support the following conclusions. First, all four G\u03b2\u03b3 binding sites must be occupied on the channel before it opens, consistent with the limiting slope analysis (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Second, G\u03b2\u03b3 binding is cooperative with a factor of 0.30, which means the fourth G\u03b2\u03b3 subunit binds with an affinity 37 times higher than the first. Attempts to fit the data imposing no cooperativity (<i>b</i> = 1) yields higher residuals (0.126 compared to 0.064 when allowing cooperativity) and fail to replicate the steep rise in channel activity as a function of G\u03b2\u03b3 concentration (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). The strong cooperative binding of four G\u03b2\u03b3 subunits accounts for the steep sigmoidal dependence of GIRK current on membrane G\u03b2\u03b3 concentration (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>). Third, G\u03b2\u03b3 binds with a Na<sup>+</sup> cross cooperativity factor (<i>\u03b7</i>) of 0.63, which means G\u03b2\u03b3 binds with 6-fold higher affinity when four Na<sup>+</sup> sites are occupied compared to when the Na<sup>+</sup> sites are not occupied. This effect of Na<sup>+</sup> on G\u03b2\u03b3 affinity accounts for channel opening at lower membrane G\u03b2\u03b3 concentrations as Na<sup>+</sup> concentration increases (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>)."

When four G\u03b2\u03b3 subunits bind to the cytoplasmic domain of GIRK2, which forms a ring made by the four channel subunits, they cause the ring to rotate as a rigid body with respect to the pore, which twists open the helical bundle that forms the pore\u2019s gate (<a href=\"#bib32\">Whorton et al., 2013</a>). Because the rigid body rotation involves all four subunits at once, conformational changes induced by the binding of G\u03b2\u03b3 to one site will favor binding at the neighboring sites (i.e. positive cooperativity). A cartoon illustrating this concept depicts G\u03b2\u03b3 binding more favorably to the channel\u2019s open conformation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>).

This increase follows a rectangular hyperbola. The simplest physical explanation for this behavior, which is also consistent with the equilibrium model, is that Na<sup>+</sup> stabilizes the open, conductive state of the channel in direct proportion to its occupancy on the channel. In other words, four G\u03b2\u03b3 subunits bind to GIRK2 and permit opening to a probability that is higher in proportion to occupancy of the Na<sup>+</sup> sites. Thus, by thermodynamic linkage, Na<sup>+</sup> would increase the apparent affinity of G\u03b2\u03b3 for GIRK2 and it would also increase the maximum level of current reached when four G\u03b2\u03b3 subunits bind. This physical mechanism is consistent with the location of the Na<sup>+</sup> binding sites at the interface between the cytoplasmic domains and the transmembrane pore, where opening is transduced through the binding of G\u03b2\u03b3 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib32\">Whorton et al., 2013</a>). It is also consistent with the observations that Na<sup>+</sup> in the absence of G\u03b2\u03b3 does not open GIRK (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>) and in crystal structures Na<sup>+</sup> binds to GIRK but does not cause a rotation of the cytoplasmic domain in the absence of G\u03b2\u03b3 (<a href=\"#bib31\">Whorton and MacKinnon, 2011</a>).

GIRK2 suppresses electrical activity in neurons when inhibitory neurotransmitters stimulate GPCRs on the cell surface, such as GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors, which release G\u03b2\u03b3 on the intracellular membrane surface to open GIRK2 channels. At the same time, the level of GIRK2 channel opening \u2013 and therefore the level of neuronal inhibition \u2013 brought about by the released G\u03b2\u03b3 potentially depends on the intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> concentration. This conclusion derives from the family of G\u03b2\u03b3 activation curves (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>): at all G\u03b2\u03b3 concentrations, the level of GIRK2 current is increased as Na<sup>+</sup> is increased. We refer to this phenomenon as Na<sup>+</sup>-amplification of G\u03b2\u03b3-activated current. Na<sup>+</sup>-amplification is clearly not constant but is instead a function of the G\u03b2\u03b3 concentration: at high G\u03b2\u03b3 concentrations (right side of graph) amplification is 2.5-fold (i.e. GIRK2 current increases 2.5-fold) when Na<sup>+</sup> is increased from 0 to 32\u2009mM, while at lower G\u03b2\u03b3 concentrations (corresponding to the steep sigmoidal rise in current) amplification approaches ten\u00a0fold. The potential importance of Na<sup>+</sup> amplification to neuronal electrical signaling lies in the fact that cytosolic Na<sup>+</sup> increases with higher levels of electrical activity due to Na<sup>+</sup> entry through both synaptic channels and voltage-dependent Na<sup>+</sup> channels (<a href=\"#bib10\">Lasser-Ross and Ross, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Fleidervish et al., 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib25\">Rose and Konnerth, 2001</a>). Thus, Na<sup>+</sup> amplification should, in principle, provide a mechanism for strengthening an inhibitory input to a more active neuron."

                                "text": "How large is Na<sup>+</sup>-amplification in neurons? As noted above, the magnitude of amplification depends on the concentrations of G\u03b2\u03b3 generated inside a neuron when its GPCRs are stimulated. While the concentration of G\u03b2\u03b3 inside cells is unknown, the data in this study provide an approach to estimate its value. The rationale is as follows: the curves in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a> characterize the amplification as a function of G\u03b2\u03b3 concentration, therefore we should be able to solve the inverse problem of deducing G\u03b2\u03b3 concentration by measuring the Na<sup>+</sup> amplification in a cell. <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a> shows this analysis applied to GIRK currents recorded in midbrain dopamine neurons when baclofen was used to stimulate GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors. A recording pipette was used to set the cytoplasmic Na<sup>+</sup> concentration to either 0 or 27\u2009mM. Baclofen-activated currents had the strongly inwardly-rectifying current-voltage relationship expected from GIRK channel activation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Baclofen-activated GIRK current was much smaller in neurons recorded with 0\u2009mM internal Na<sup>+</sup> compared with those recorded with 27\u2009mM internal Na<sup>+</sup> (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B,C</a>). Currents measured with 27\u2009mM internal Na<sup>+</sup> were amplified by an average of 8 fold compared to currents\u00a0with 0\u2009mM Na<sup>+</sup>. From the G\u03b2\u03b3/Na<sup>+</sup> titration data (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>), 8-fold amplification corresponds to a G\u03b2\u03b3 concentration of about 0.003 in NTA-lipid mole fraction units (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). In this concentration range the amplification curve becomes very steep, allowing relatively small cell-to-cell variations in G\u03b2\u03b3 concentration to translate into larger differences in current response (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). This property offers an explanation for the large spread of current values measured upon baclofen activation in the presence of 27\u2009mM Na<sup>+</sup>. Most importantly, the estimated G\u03b2\u03b3 concentration stimulated by baclofen in dopamine neurons (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D,E</a>) is centered in the middle of the steep sigmoidal rising phase of the G\u03b2\u03b3-activation curves (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). In this regime even modest changes in intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> concentration should amplify G\u03b2\u03b3-mediated inhibition of neuronal electrical activity. The intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> concentration in neurons is subject to complex regulation by multiple channels and transporters and changes during neuronal activity (<a href=\"#bib24\">Rose and Ransom, 1997</a>). Intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> in dendrites can double during synaptic activity (<a href=\"#bib25\">Rose and Konnerth, 2001</a>), and high local increases also occur in cell bodies and axons during action potential firing (<a href=\"#bib10\">Lasser-Ross and Ross, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Fleidervish et al., 2010</a>). Thus, the Na<sup>+</sup> amplification of GIRK currents likely occurs during normal physiological activity. Even stronger amplification is likely during epileptiform activity, when intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> can likely reach 30\u2009mM (<a href=\"#bib22\">Raimondo et al., 2015</a>)."

To place this 2-dimensional membrane density into more familiar concentration units we multiply the membrane surface area by the linear dimension of a G\u03b2\u03b3 subunit (about 70\u2009\u00c5) to approximate a G\u03b2\u03b3 concentration in the solution layer adjacent to the membrane equal to 280\u2009\u03bcM. At this G\u03b2\u03b3 concentration GIRK is between 10% and 80% activated, depending on the Na<sup>+</sup> concentration (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Thus, the apparent affinity of G\u03b2\u03b3 for the GIRK channel is in this range."

A more careful comparison, however, reveals a fascinating difference. Removed from the pore, the cytoplasmic domain, even though it is a tetramer with four G\u03b2\u03b3 binding sites like the full channel, binds to G\u03b2\u03b3 according to a 1:1 binding isotherm. As we have shown here, the full GIRK2 channel by contrast exhibits strong cooperativity, the first G\u03b2\u03b3 subunit binding with very low affinity (equilibrium constant 0.019 mol fraction corresponding to 1.9\u2009mM in the solution layer adjacent to the membrane) and the fourth binding with higher affinity (equilibrium constant (0.019) \u00d7 (0.3)<sup>3</sup> mol fraction corresponding to 50\u2009\u03bcM in the solution layer adjacent to the membrane). This cooperativity, which gives rise to the steep dependence of GIRK channel activity on G\u03b2\u03b3 concentration, is completely lost when the transmembrane pore is removed. The mechanism proposed for coupling G\u03b2\u03b3 binding to pore opening, illustrated in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, offers an explanation: when the pore is removed, G\u03b2\u03b3 binding free energy is no longer utilized to twist open the pore\u2019s helical gate, and at the same time the rotational origin of cooperativity disappears. The ITC-determined affinity of 250\u2009\u03bcM lies in between the affinities of the first (1.9\u2009mM) and fourth (50\u2009\u03bcM) G\u03b2\u03b3 subunits to bind to the intact, cooperative system."

For example, two proteins with a diffusion-limited association rate constant of, say, 10<sup>7</sup>\u2009M<sup>-1</sup>sec<sup>-1</sup>, will remain in complex on average for less than 2 milliseconds if the equilibrium constant is 50\u2009\u03bcM (i.e. affinity of the fourth G\u03b2\u03b3 subunit) and the lifetime of an activated channel (GIRK2 with 4 G\u03b2\u03b3 subunits, any one of which can dissociate) less than 0.5 milliseconds. Even if the association rate constant is smaller, the lifetime of an active channel will be brief compared to the duration of macroscopic GIRK current in a cell during GPCR stimulation (~1\u2009s) (<a href=\"#bib2\">Ford et al., 2009</a>). This means G\u03b2\u03b3 apparently associates and dissociates many times on and off the channel during a period of stimulation. Because G\u03b2\u03b3 binds to G\u03b1(GDP) with greater than ten thousand times higher affinity (<i>K<sub>d</sub></i> ~1 nM <a href=\"#bib26\">Sarvazyan et al., 1998</a>) than to the channel, whenever G\u03b1(GTP) hydrolyses GTP to GDP it will rapidly bind free G\u03b2\u03b3 and remove it from the channel by mass action. Thus, the very weak binding of G\u03b2\u03b3 to the channel means that the duration of GIRK current activation during GPCR stimulation will be controlled by the lifetime of G\u03b1(GTP)."

In this case the relevant density of G\u03b2\u03b3 is the local density near GIRK channels, which would be much higher than that averaged over the entire membrane. Such specialized regions would promote locally high G\u03b2\u03b3 densities, in line with the relatively low affinity for GIRK subunits that allows rapid control of free G\u03b2\u03b3 by G\u03b1."

(1) Four G\u03b2\u03b3 subunits bind to the GIRK channel with high cooperativity to give rise to a steep dependence of channel activity on membrane G\u03b2\u03b3 concentration. (2) Intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> concentration increases G\u03b2\u03b3 affinity with an apparent <i>K<sub>d-Na+</sub></i> near the cytoplasmic Na<sup>+</sup> concentration of a resting neuron. (3) Inhibitory GPCR stimulation generates membrane G\u03b2\u03b3 concentrations corresponding to the steep regime of the G\u03b2\u03b3-activation curve. (4) Properties (1) \u2013 (3) give rise to Na<sup>+</sup> amplification of G\u03b2\u03b3-activation. Such amplification provides a mechanism for strengthening GPCR inhibition when Na<sup>+</sup> enters neurons during activity. (5) G\u03b2\u03b3 binds to GIRK with low affinity. Rapid equilibrium between G\u03b2\u03b3 and GIRK allows rapid signal termination when G\u03b1 hydrolyses GTP to GDP."

Fluorophore was excited with a white light laser positioned at 491 nm with a pinhole size of 1 airy unit, giving rise to a confocal plane thickness of about 360 nm. Emission light above 505 nm was detected with a Hyd detector in photon counting mode, which exhibited good linearity.

A detailed outline of the experimental procedure is illustrated in <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>. To measure the GIRK activity at a specific density of G\u03b2\u03b3 in the membrane, a lipid bilayer containing a\u00a0certain mole fraction of DOGS-NTA-Ni<sup>2+</sup> lipid was used for making the planar lipid bilayer.

The maximized current level was used to normalize recordings for each membrane.

GIRK current was evoked by application of 100 \u00b5M baclofen using an external solution containing 16\u2009mM KCl, 139\u2009mM NaCl, 1.5\u2009mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1\u2009mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 13\u2009mM glucose, 10\u2009mM HEPES, pH adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH. The 0 Na<sup>+</sup> internal solution contained 140\u2009mM K-gluconate, 13.5\u2009mM NMDG-Cl, 1.6\u2009mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.09\u2009mM EGTA, 4\u2009mM MgATP, 14\u2009mM creatine phosphate (Tris salt), 0.3\u2009mM GTP (Tris salt), 9\u2009mM HEPES, pH 7.4. The 27\u2009mM Na<sup>+</sup> internal solution contained 13.5\u2009mM NaCl, 13.5\u2009mM Na-gluconate, 126\u2009mM K-gluconate, 13.5\u2009mM NMDG-Cl, 1.6\u2009mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.09\u2009mM EGTA, 4\u2009mM MgATP, 14\u2009mM creatine phosphate (Tris salt), 0.3\u2009mM GTP (Tris salt), 9\u2009mM HEPES, pH 7.4. Pipette resistances were 2.5\u20133.5 MOhm. Whole-cell current was recorded during voltage ramps (1 mV/ms) from +8 to -147 mV delivered from a steady holding potential of -80 mV every 2 s. Baclofen-induced current was measured after 9\u201311 min of cell dialysis to allow equilibration with the internal solution. Baclofen-induced current was measured by averaging the current between -142 to -147 mV over ramps delivered during a 10-sec application of baclofen, subtracting the current before application of baclofen. Baclofen was applied in &lt;1 s by moving the cell between a pair of quartz fiber flow pipes (250 \u00b5m internal diameter, 350 \u00b5m external diameter) glued onto an aluminum rod whose temperature was controlled by resistive heating elements and a feedback-controlled temperature controller (TC-344B, Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT). Recordings were made at 37\u00b0C."

The authors develop a biochemically defined, reconstituted systems with all the works needed for a serious analysis: membrane-tethered G\u03b2\u03b3, PIP<sub>2</sub> at fixed concentration, and purified GIRK2 homotetramers. They describe and verify an assay for systematically varying the membrane surface density of G\u03b2\u03b3 in order to quantify its activation of GIRK2 macroscopic currents in planar lipid bilayers \u2013 something never convincingly achieved previously. They fit their results to a simple model in which all 4 G\u03b2\u03b3 subunits must bind to GIRK before activation can occur, also showing that G\u03b2\u03b3 binding to the successive subunits involves a roughly 3-fold (kT's worth) positive cooperativity leading to a persistent steepness in the switch-like activation curve. The interplay between G\u03b2\u03b3 and Na<sup>+</sup> binding is also derived from these reduced-system experiments. And then this is all plausibly related to the situation in dopamine neurons. It's a real tour-de-force that opens the way for many more such analyses of G-protein activation of ion channels."

Are these really representative of equilibrium levels? Does it take minutes or second in the \"breaks\" on the figure? In <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, were a range of G\u03b2\u03b3 concentrations tested in each experiment? In <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, were a range of Na concentrations tested in each recording?

Such plots will still give a quartic 'foot' at low G\u03b2\u03b3 (as you point out in eq (<a href=\"#bib1\">1</a>) and (<a href=\"#bib2\">2</a>)), and it might be hard to distinguish a coop factor of 0.3 from one of 1.0 from the rather sparse number of points on the sigmoid plots shown."

Perhaps the authors could point to <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a> and discuss the increase in current with added Na<sup>+</sup> at concentrations of NTA-lipids and G\u03b2\u03b3 that are saturating. The Discussion could also be somewhat more clear about this. The authors should also consider including a direct measurement by single-channel recording of the value of maximum open probability in the absence and presence of Na<sup>+</sup>. That measurement would help to complete the picture of Na<sup>+</sup> modulation, and should be relatively straightforward to do, given the excellent reproducibility of the bilayer macroscopic recordings."

If the firing patterns result in depolarization for substantial periods of time, compared to time spent in a repolarized state (as in cardiac muscle), cytoplasmic Na may go down, not up, with increased firing. Cytoplasmic Na is subject to many cellular influences besides excitation rate and pattern. This includes the activities of transporters and ligand gated channels that may have a larger influence in many places where these channels are expressed than the influence of action potential trains. Perhaps it is worth touching on some of this underlying complexity in the Discussion."

In deriving parameters from these sigmoid fits, we would be more convinced of the G\u03b2\u03b3 cooperativity factors if an example were given showing that the data could not be well fit by a model in which no cooperativity is present. Such plots will still give a quartic 'foot' at low G\u03b2\u03b3 (as you point out in eq (<a href=\"#bib1\">1</a>) and (<a href=\"#bib2\">2</a>)), and it might be hard to distinguish a coop factor of 0.3 from one of 1.0 from the rather sparse number of points on the sigmoid plots shown.</i> The sigmoidal shape of dose-response curves could indeed arise from the requirement of multiple ligand binding for activation but not cooperativity in binding itself. However, the cooperativity affects the \u201csteepness\u201d of the G\u03b2\u03b3 response.

Can the authors state in a few words why the outcome is 'mostly' and not entirely? Perhaps the authors could point to <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a> and discuss the increase in current with added</i> Na<sup>+</sup><i>at concentrations of NTA-lipids and G\u03b2\u03b3 that are saturating. The Discussion could also be somewhat more clear about this. The authors should also consider including a direct measurement by single-channel recording of the value of maximum open probability in the absence and presence of Na<sup>+</sup>. That measurement would help to complete the picture of</i> Na<sup>+</sup> <i>modulation, and should be relatively straightforward to do, given the excellent reproducibility of the bilayer macroscopic recordings.</i> The further activation of GIRK by Na<sup>+</sup> (~2.5 fold) in the presence of saturating concentrations of G\u03b2\u03b3 is very interesting. It is exactly the reason why we concluded that Na<sup>+</sup> acts mostly but not entirely by increasing G\u03b2\u03b3 affinity (in which case at sufficiently high G\u03b2\u03b3 concentrations Na<sup>+</sup> would have no further effect). In the subsection \u201cStructural basis of G\u03b2\u03b3 cooperativity and Na+ activation\u201d we have a paragraph discussing the possible mechanism underlying this phenomenon. We also have wondered how Na<sup>+</sup> affects the open probability of the channel when all G\u03b2\u03b3 sites are occupied. Single GIRK channels are notoriously spikey (very short open dwell time), making it difficult to get accurate data. Nevertheless, we had addressed this question using non-stationary noise analysis from the macroscopic current recordings. <a href=\"#fig7\">Author response image 1</a> shows what we found graphing current variance as a function of mean current at different Na<sup>+</sup> concentrations (in mM, 0, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 from left to right):"

We did not include this analysis in the paper because our conclusions in the paper are independent of whatever this maximum open probability is. We do agree with you that it is nevertheless an interesting point. We wonder whether the spikey nature of GIRK channels (and the difficulty in approaching an open probability of 1.0) could be related to the low affinity of G\u03b2\u03b3.

Cytoplasmic Na is subject to many cellular influences besides excitation rate and pattern.
