In this study, we compared dopamine activity across the striatum using fiber fluorometry in mice. During classical conditioning, we observed opposite dynamics in dopamine axon signals in the ventral striatum (\u2018VS dopamine\u2019) and the posterior tail of the striatum (\u2018TS dopamine\u2019). TS dopamine showed strong excitation to novel cues, whereas VS dopamine showed no responses to novel cues until they had been paired with a reward. TS dopamine cue responses decreased over time, depending on what the cue predicted. Additionally, TS dopamine showed excitation to several types of stimuli including rewarding, aversive, and neutral stimuli whereas VS dopamine showed excitation only to reward or reward-predicting cues. Together, these results demonstrate that dopamine novelty signals are localized in TS along with general salience signals, while VS dopamine reliably encodes reward prediction error."

In this study, we compared dopamine activity across the striatum using fiber fluorometry in mice. During classical conditioning, we observed opposite dynamics in dopamine axon signals in the ventral striatum (\u2018VS dopamine\u2019) and the posterior tail of the striatum (\u2018TS dopamine\u2019). TS dopamine showed strong excitation to novel cues, whereas VS dopamine showed no responses to novel cues until they had been paired with a reward. TS dopamine cue responses decreased over time, depending on what the cue predicted. Additionally, TS dopamine showed excitation to several types of stimuli including rewarding, aversive, and neutral stimuli whereas VS dopamine showed excitation only to reward or reward-predicting cues. Together, these results demonstrate that dopamine novelty signals are localized in TS along with general salience signals, while VS dopamine reliably encodes reward prediction error."

By contrast, dopamine neurons projecting to the front of the striatum do not respond to novelty, but rather become more active as mice learn which odors accompany rewards (only responding to odors that predict reward). The experiments also show that dopamine neurons in the tail of the striatum encode information about the importance of a stimulus."

Detection of novel stimuli is advantageous for survival because novel stimuli can signal potential rewards or potential threats. Orienting towards a novel stimulus and understanding it through exploration can allow future exploitation of potential rewards. In addition to behavioral advantages, novelty detection is fundamental for computation in our brain. For example, novelty detectors, or \u2018novelty filters\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib44\">Kohonen and Oja, 1976</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Marsland et al., 2002</a>), can reduce the amount of total information so that we can focus on unexpected perceptions as inputs to pay attention to and to learn from. Indeed, behavioral studies have repeatedly shown that both humans and other\u00a0animals have enhanced memory for novel items (<a href=\"#bib40\">Kishiyama et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Restorff, 1933</a>)."

One hypothesis was that dopamine neurons take an optimistic approach toward novel stimuli, assuming that they will predict a valuable outcome until proven wrong (<a href=\"#bib30\">Hazy et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Kakade and Dayan, 2002</a>). This \u2018optimistic initialization\u2019 in dopamine neurons may have advantages. For example, the novelty responses in dopamine neurons may induce orienting behaviors towards novel stimuli, similar to dopamine responses to reward or reward-predicting cues that induce orienting behaviors (<a href=\"#bib30\">Hazy et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Kakade and Dayan, 2002</a>). Further, dopamine novelty responses may allow computational exploration (<a href=\"#bib20\">Dayan and Sejnowski, 1996</a>), or storage of the novel\u00a0stimulus in working memory (<a href=\"#bib8\">Braver and Cohen, 1999</a>), so that animals have a better chance to associate novel stimuli to potential rewards (<a href=\"#bib30\">Hazy et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Kakade and Dayan, 2002</a>). However, these hypotheses do not necessarily fit with conflicting observations of animals\u2019 behavioral responses to novel stimuli (<a href=\"#bib26\">Gershman and Niv, 2015</a>). Indeed, depending on the experimental context, animals sometimes approach and sometimes avoid novel options compared to familiar ones (<a href=\"#bib26\">Gershman and Niv, 2015</a>)."

For example, single unit recordings in monkeys showed that some dopamine neurons are inhibited by aversive outcomes and others are excited by them (<a href=\"#bib56\">Matsumoto and Hikosaka, 2009</a>). This suggests that there are distinct types of dopamine neurons and that some do not encode pure value.

Neural circuit tracing using a modified rabies virus (<a href=\"#bib90\">Wickersham et al., 2007</a>) enabled us to specifically label the monosynaptic inputs onto dopamine neurons, revealing that the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and the substantia nigra compacta (SNc) dopamine neurons receive slightly different inputs (<a href=\"#bib88\">Watabe-Uchida et al., 2012</a>).

Our results revealed opposite dynamics for learning new cue-outcome associations in VS dopamine and TS dopamine. We observed a large response to novel cues in TS dopamine which subsequently decreased over the course of associative learning. On the other hand, we saw no response to novel cues in VS dopamine. Instead, VS dopamine gradually developed responses to reward-predicting cues during learning. These findings revealed that dopamine novelty coding is localized to the posterior part of the striatum, while VS dopamine faithfully encodes reward prediction error. Thus, novelty responses in dopamine may be better formalized separately from the reward prediction error (RPE) framework, rather than being included in the RPE framework."

Mice were trained to associate odors with water or with no outcome. After several weeks of this training, in some sessions, trials with odors predicting either a mild tone (55 dB) or an air puff were interleaved in addition to trials with water and trials with no outcome. We chose a very mild tone with a similar intensity to the background noise in the room to try to minimize the aversiveness of this stimulus. To estimate the aversiveness of auditory stimuli, we measured the behavioral responses to tones of different volumes in a different set of mice (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We found that quiet tones did not cause freezing. When comparing the VS dopamine and TS dopamine responses to all stimuli, we observed that VS dopamine showed excitation only to reward and reward-predicting cues (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A\u2013C</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), while TS dopamine was excited in response to a variety of stimuli including water, tone, air puff, odor cues predicting any of these outcomes, and also odor cues predicting no outcome (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D\u2013F</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

With respect to reward prediction, both VS and TS dopamine had a larger excitatory response to reward-predicting cues than cues predicting nothing (VS: p\u00a0=\u00a01.8x10<sup>\u221210</sup>, TS: p\u00a0=\u00a06.5x10<sup>\u22126</sup>, t-test, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,D</a>).

However, there was a\u00a0significant difference in the response to the omission of a predicted reward: whereas VS dopamine showed a dip below baseline following reward omission (VS: p\u00a0=\u00a04.8x10<sup>\u22127</sup>, t-test, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,D</a>), TS dopamine axon signal was still significantly higher than baseline following omission (p\u00a0=\u00a02.2x10<sup>\u22128</sup>, t-test, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,D</a>). In TS, reward prediction elicited sustained activity over the interval between odor presentation and reward onset, and reward delivery caused only a small increase above this level. In fact, although the average peak response was slightly higher in rewarded trials than unrewarded trials (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0014), the total response (area under each curve) after the outcome (reward delivery or omission) did not differ significantly (p\u00a0=\u00a00.81)."

These two phenomena have been implemented in the framework of CS associability. For example, Wagner (<a href=\"#bib87\">Wagner, 1978</a>) proposed that CS associability is correlated with the weakness of CS-context association (or the \u2018unpredictability\u2019 of the CS in the context). On the other hand, Pearce and Hall (<a href=\"#bib67\">Pearce and Hall, 1980</a>) defined the CS associability as the unpredictability of the US (by the CS) in the previous trial. In either case, the\u00a0novelty would promote learning because of high CS associability, although the latter model did not define CS associability on the very first trial. Our data could be explained with either framework, but one observed phenomenon prefers the latter model. The responses to a novel odor decreased more slowly when the odor was associated with some outcome (water or air puff) than when it was associated with no outcome. If novelty responses are determined solely by odor-context association, responses to both odors should decrease at the same speed. Furthermore, this would lead to an equal response to all familiar odors, which we did not observe."

Here, we propose that CS associability, or the \u2018attention\u2019 term in dopamine signals may not be an exception in RPE, but instead may be a separate system \u2013 localized in particular brain regions such as in TS. Thus, dopamine in TS signals novelty and salience, and dopamine in VS signals RPE, although both systems may co-exist in some brain areas. In general, one big limitation of the current reinforcement learning algorithms is the so-called \u2018curse of dimensionality\u2019. As the number of stimuli in an environment becomes large as in most natural environments, it quickly becomes difficult to properly assign credit to relevant objects. Attention would be critical to reduce the amount of information for learning to a more realistic amount. Dopamine in TS may be specialized for this function. In line with this idea, a recent study suggested that putative dopamine neurons in lateral SNc in monkey represented \u2018cognitive salience\u2019, which was correlated with working memory load (<a href=\"#bib57\">Matsumoto and Takada, 2013</a>). Behaviorally, previous studies suggested that SNc is important for the\u00a0acquisition of enhanced CS associability (<a href=\"#bib49\">Lee et al., 2008</a>, <a href=\"#bib48\">2006</a>). Mechanistically, dopamine in the prefrontal cortex has been modeled to serve a \u2018gating\u2019 function to provide flexible updating in working memory (<a href=\"#bib8\">Braver and Cohen, 1999</a>), and a similar mechanism may apply to dopamine in TS. Of note, different from adjacent striatal areas, TS, categorized in caudal extreme (<a href=\"#bib31\">Hintiryan et al., 2016</a>), does not receive projections from sensorimotor cortex, suggesting a functional distinction from other areas in the striatum. All in all, TS dopamine may function to \u2018pre-process\u2019 sensory inputs to weigh potentially important stimuli to make reinforcement learning more efficient in a complex environment."

In these models, during learning, RPE signals gradually transfer from the timing of the reward to the timing of the preceding stimulus (<a href=\"#bib73\">Schultz et al., 1997</a>). Although the step-wise transfer may explain a delay between the decrease of US responses and emergence of CS responses, such a gradual transfer has not been observed in single neuron recording of dopamine neurons (<a href=\"#bib64\">Pan et al., 2005</a>). With any learning rate longer than one trial, transferred signals may become temporally smeared until they become time-locked to the CS (<a href=\"#bib64\">Pan et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Schultz et al., 1997</a>), which may not be detected in recording of single units. This theory would predict that we would observe some increase in signal between the stimulus and outcome (either smeared or sharp) during learning because the monitoring of population activity likely provides more reliable detection of small signals. However, this type of increase was not apparent with our bulk recording method. Instead, we observed a gradual development of a CS response directly following cue presentation. It is possible that distinct mechanisms could cause VS dopamine excitation in response to a reward-predicting CS and VS dopamine suppression in response to a predicted US, as proposed in several previous models (<a href=\"#bib11\">Brown et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">O'Reilly et al., 2007</a>)."

Another example is stimulus novelty, which is associated with objects/stimuli that animals have never encountered or do not remember. It has been reported that dopamine activity in VTA and dopamine in the ventral striatum increased in the former case, in novel environments (<a href=\"#bib76\">Segovia et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Takeuchi et al., 2016</a>). On the other hand, in the present study, we focused on the latter type of novelty. Dopamine axon responses to novel stimuli were localized in TS. One potential explanation is that depending on the training history and environments, a given type of novelty may cause the animals to expect potential rewards, resulting in the excitation of the value system. Interestingly, previous studies found that different brain areas are responsible for different kinds of novelty (<a href=\"#bib72\">Schomaker and Meeter, 2015</a>).

In the present study, the excitation of TS dopamine elicited by various neutral stimuli suggested that the responses in TS could be related to more general salience rather than motivational salience, although we cannot rule out the possibility that the tone and odor predicting nothing had positive or negative motivational values. On the other hand, the fact that signals encoded by TS dopamine are modulated by prediction suggests that they are not encoding pure physical salience (i.e. stimulus intensity). Instead, TS dopamine appears to encode general stimulus salience prediction error, which includes prediction-dependent suppression and prediction. The novelty responses we observed may be the extreme case of salience prediction error, causing large excitation because of minimum prediction, rather than an exception."

The responses to novel odors in TS dopamine that we observed began within 200 ms, most likely within one respiration cycle, suggesting a potential contribution at the early stages of novelty."

(<a href=\"#bib45\">Kudo et al., 1992</a>) and has been applied in many studies to record the population activity of neurons from cell bodies, dendrites, or axons (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adelsberger et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Davis and Schmidt, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Murayama et al., 2007</a>). In this study, we recorded the population activity of dopamine axons in the striatum using GCaMP6m (<a href=\"#bib2\">Akerboom et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Chen et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Kim et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Parker et al., 2016</a>). We should point out several limitations associated with the present technique. First, previous studies (<a href=\"#bib23\">Fiorillo et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Schultz, 2015</a>) proposed that there is a temporal separation of two signals (stimulus intensity and value) in single dopamine neurons. However, we may only be able to measure the sum of these signals because of the limited temporal resolution of our method (population calcium imaging using GCaMP6m). Second, a recent study found that dopamine axons with distinct signals (locomotion and reward) coexist in the dorsal-most part of the dorsal striatum (<a href=\"#bib34\">Howe and Dombeck, 2016</a>). Axons signaling different information might also co-exist in other areas of the striatum, and this could not be resolved with our bulk-imaging method (because such signals would effectively be \u2018averaged\u2019). Third, because the spatial resolution of z-axis is large with fluorometry (~500 \u00b5m), we have to be careful in interpreting the analysis of differences along dorsal-ventral axis."

Finally, the activity of axons of dopamine neurons may not directly correspond to amounts of dopamine release at synapses or spike activities in cell bodies. Dopamine neurons that project to the ventral striatum (mainly medial shell) are able to co-release glutamate (<a href=\"#bib80\">Stuber et al., 2010</a>). Neuronal activities can be modulated locally at axon terminals in the striatum by cholinergic neurons (<a href=\"#bib84\">Threlfell et al., 2012</a>). Most importantly, observed\u00a0calcium transients may not reflect spike counts, because of autofluorescence, bleaching, motion artifacts and inevitable normalization. Although we only applied baseline normalization (i.e. signals were subtracted with and then divided by the average signal in a 1 s period before CS in each trial) in this study, additional methods using activity-independent wavelength of excitation (<a href=\"#bib45\">Kudo et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Lerner et al., 2015</a>) or examination of emission spectrum (<a href=\"#bib19\">Cui et al., 2013</a>) may improve fidelity, especially in freely moving animals."

We propose to revise current RPE models so that novelty-driven and salience-driven attention is attributed to TS dopamine, rather than added to the RPE framework as a bonus (<a href=\"#bib36\">Kakade and Dayan, 2002</a>). Thus, TS dopamine may be specialized for functions apart from value, such as attentional orientation (<a href=\"#bib68\">Redgrave et al., 1999</a>), working attention, and/or as a filter for learning (<a href=\"#bib8\">Braver and Cohen, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Dayan and Sejnowski, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Matsumoto and Takada, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Pearce and Hall, 1980</a>). Further, our proposal includes another important point: RPE is not contaminated or distorted in VS dopamine. VS dopamine purely signals RPE, increasing the validity of the original ideas regarding dopamine\u2019s role in reinforcement learning (<a href=\"#bib73\">Schultz et al., 1997</a>)."

We used circular head-plates to ensure that the skull above the striatum would be accessible for fiber implants. Finally, during the same surgery, we also implanted optic fibers into the VS, DMS, DLS, and TS (1\u20134 fibers per mouse). To do this, we first slowly lowered optical fibers (either 200 \u00b5m or 400 \u00b5m diameter, Doric Lenses) into the striatum. The coordinates we used for targeting were as follows: (VS) Bregma 1.0, Lateral 1.25, Depth 4.1, (DS) Bregma 0.0, Lateral 1.5, Depth 2.25, (DLS) Bregma \u22120.5, Lateral 2.75, Depth 2.5, (TS) Bregma \u22122.0, Lateral 3.25, Depth 2.5. Once fibers were lowered, we first attached them to the skull with UV-curing epoxy (Thorlabs, NOA81), and then a layer of black Ortho-Jet dental adhesive (Lang Dental). After waiting fifteen minutes for this glue to dry, we applied a very small amount of rapid-curing epoxy (Devcon, A00254) to attach the fiber cannulas even more firmly to the underlying glue and head-plate.

We referred to these mice as \u2018overtrained mice\u2019. After this training, we recorded GCaMP and licking signals from these overtrained mice as they learned either new odor-water (one third of sessions) or new odor-nothing associations (one third of sessions) in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>. In one third of sessions, a new odor associated with air-puff was introduced in addition to the two familiar odors associated with water or with no outcome (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). We randomized whether the new odor of a session would predict water, nothing, or air puff to ensure that mice could not generalize that novel odors reliably predicted a particular outcome. Mice performed one session per day."

The calculation for each point in the trial (calculated in 1 ms bins) was then simply dF/F = (F<sub>2</sub> \u2013 F<sub>1</sub>) / F<sub>1</sub>. We used this measurement because it readily normalized signals (i.e. in the case of low signal to noise ratio, the denominator would be larger). The average responses to a stimulus type within a session (often\u00a0~50 trials per stimulus type) were averaged, and these session averages were used as the data in each figure (individual session averages can be found in <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, and example individual single trial traces are shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

Brains were glued to the tip of a 1 ml syringe (without needle) such that the posterior tip of the cerebellum was in contact with the syringe. A 488 nm laser was used to excite GFP and a 647 nm laser was used to produce autofluorescence. Images were collected through a 5\u00d7 objective with PCO-Edge scMOS 16 bit cameras (PCO, Kelheim, Germany) with 1920 \u00d7 1920 pixels. Each frame was 2000 \u00d7 2000 \u03bcm, so each pixel was roughly 1.04 \u03bcm. The step size between images was set to 5.25 \u03bcm, so the voxels were not isotropic. Brains were imaged horizontally from the dorsal side, and then rotated 180\u00b0 for horizontal imaging from the ventral side. Each view was tiled with 7\u00a0\u00d7\u00a06 tiles (14,000\u00a0\u00d7\u00a012,000 \u03bcm) and the two views were combined to create a continuous image. Autofluorescence images were subsequently downsized to 1400\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01200\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0700 pixels for alignment to the reference space. In these downsized images, voxels have 10 \u03bcm spacing in all three dimensions. Brains were aligned to a previously described reference space comprised of the average of 25 brains (<a href=\"#bib58\">Menegas et al., 2015</a>). Alignment to this reference space was performed using Elastix (<a href=\"#bib41\">Klein et al., 2010</a>). We performed affine alignment followed by B-spline alignment based on mutual information, as previously proposed for human magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) image registration (<a href=\"#bib59\">Metz et al., 2011</a>). After alignment, fiber positions were manually determined by tracing the fiber paths to their termination points."

Our analysis in the current paper focuses on comparing VS-implanted fibers to TS-implanted fibers. Most implants were successfully targeted to VS or TS. We classified implants as successful based on the following criteria. For VS: any fiber within the nucleus accumbens core or shell, between Bregma 2.0 and Bregma 0. For DS: any fiber within the striatum anterior to Bregma 1.5. For TS: any fiber within the striatum posterior to Bregma \u22121.5. We discarded data from eight animals which had fibers incorrectly targeted. The fibers in these animals were often in areas of cortex directly adjacent to the intended recording site. We observed very little or no signal (compared to our other recordings) in these cases, likely due to the relatively sparse dopaminergic innervation of cortex relative to striatum in mouse."

The major result is a dramatic difference between dopamine signals in the ventral striatum (VS) compared to the tail of the striatum (TS). While VS projecting DA neurons followed the classical reward prediction error patterns and did not respond to novel cues, TS projecting DA neurons responded strongly to novel cues and also to the overall salience of cues and outcomes. This is a beautiful manuscript reporting on a very timely and important topic. The design of the experiments is elegant and the observed difference between DA responses is striking. The manuscript is very well written and describes an important finding with attention to the points listed below."

To test this idea, we quantified the change in the effective concentration of the odorants used in our study over trials within a session, as well as the latency of odor delivery within single trials, using a photoionization detector (PID) (Aurora Scientific, 200B: miniPID Dispersion Sensor) (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

We then compared TS dopamine axon responses to novel odor cues based on the stability of the odorant over time. We found that responses to both types of odors decreased dramatically over the course of a session (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1F</a>). Another way to address this potential concern is to look at TS dopamine axon responses to a familiar odor over the course of a session.

First, studies using anesthetized animals have shown that neurons in the piriform cortex, but not in the olfactory bulb, quickly adapt to repeated odor presentations, and recover in a relatively short time period, normally within tens of seconds (Wilson 1998, Best and Wilson 2004). Our observation that dopamine novelty response decreases over days (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>) cannot be explained simply by this type of adaptation. In addition, the decay in response was unique to novel odors and we did not observe similar decay in signal elicited by familiar odors (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>). Further, the speed of decrease in responses to novel odors depends on whether the odor predicted nothing, water, or air puff. We observed that TS dopamine axon responses to novel odors decreased more slowly when the novel odor predicted water (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>) or airpuff (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) than when it did not predict any outcome.

Kato et al. showed that neurons in the olfactory bulb quickly reduced their responses to odors following repetitive exposure (within a session) and that the effects of exposure lasted for over a month. Although we cannot directly compare the time-course because of the difference of tasks (i.e. the odor presentations are interspersed with other trial types in our task, rather than repeated consecutively as in their task), the dynamics in olfactory bulb are comparable to our observation in TS dopamine axon signals."

Behaviorally, novelty detection occurs within 200 ms; immediately after a single sniff (Wesson et al., 2008).

We found that the median latency of TS dopamine axon responses to novel odors in na\u00efve mice was 140 ms (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a>) and the median latency of discrimination between novel and familiar odor in trained mice was 170 ms (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). We plotted the average of the responses to the first 5 presentations of a novel odor in 12 mice (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). The short latency of these responses means that the signal is likely to arise within the first sniff, based on a previously reported sniff rate of 3.4 Hz (294ms/cycle) (Kato et al., 2012). Because we used GCaMP, a calcium-based indicator, our temporal resolution is somewhat limited. This is also an issue with the previous studies that we mentioned (Kato et al., 2012, Wesson et al., 2008). Notably, the peak of the average response we observed in TS dopamine axon responses to novel odors was not until 600 ms after odor delivery (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a>)."

Whether dopamine neurons receive this processed information from sensory systems or whether more abstract information about salience and novelty is passed to dopamine neurons and sensory systems in parallel is an open question. Of note, behavioral responses to novel odors are very quick, within one sniff in rats (Wesson et al., 2008).

This is an especially important consideration in freely moving animals, where the interface between the implanted fiber and the patch cord used to collect signal can cause additional artifacts. In this paper, we used a head-fixed preparation and reported the signal from GCaMP. We did not normalize by the tdTomato signal because we were not confident that the ratio of GCaMP: tdTomato would be constant between mice. Specifically, TdTomato levels were likely to be similar (because this was genetically encoded), but the virally-delivered GCaMP was likely to be present at slightly different levels in each animal. This problem would not likely be solved by using 405 nm excitation to separately collect a baseline as previously outlined (Lerner et al., 2015) because this autofluorescence signal would also not scale with GCaMP infection size.

However, Fiorillo (Fiorillo et al., 2013) acquired a very similar dataset, but proposed that the excitation of dopamine neurons was better explained by stimulus intensity. He argued that this excitation was not correlated with aversion, which he estimated based on choice preferences. Unfortunately, our task was not designed to distinguish between these possibilities. Nonetheless, our data do not perfectly match with either of the ideas. First, we observed similar amplitudes of excitation in response to water and a very quiet tone in thirsty mice. For comparison to other studies, a 90 dB tone did not affect the utility function in thirsty monkeys (Fiorillo et al., 2013), and we used a 55 dB tone with our thirsty mice. Second, we also observed large responses to novel cues. We think that it is important to distinguish these TS dopamine axon signals from those proposed in previous studies. We therefore propose that signals in TS are general salience prediction error signals (containing both salience and novelty) rather than conceptualizing them as the absolute value of salience plus a separate bonus for novelty."

On the other hand, another study proposed that excitation of dopamine neurons in response to non-rewarding stimuli encodes stimulus intensity, regardless of value (Fiorillo et al., 2013). In the present study, the excitation of TS dopamine elicited by various neutral stimuli suggested that the responses in TS could be related to more general salience rather than motivational salience, although we cannot rule out the possibility that the tone and odor predicting nothing had positive or negative motivational values. On the other hand, the fact that signals encoded by TS dopamine are modulated by prediction suggests that they are not encoding pure physical salience (i.e. stimulus intensity). Instead, TS dopamine appears to encode general stimulus salience prediction error, which includes prediction-dependent suppression and prediction. The novelty responses we observed may be the extreme case of salience prediction error, causing large excitation because of minimum prediction, rather than an exception.\u201d"

Our tasks include a high probability of reward (~50% of trials are rewarded). In such high reward contexts, neutral stimuli might be interpreted as a signal for \u201cno reward\u201d because they predict that reward will not come in the very near future (Fiorillo, 2013, Matsumoto et al., 2016). Because of this, we have to be careful when interpreting inhibition in VS caused by tone-predicting odor cues or by tones themselves. Notably, familiar odors predicting no outcome also caused a negative inflection in the RPE-type signal that we observed in VS that was similar in size (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>)."

Second, tracing studies of single dopamine neurons have shown that the striatum is the termination point of dopamine neurons, such that single dopamine neurons have a massive arborization in the striatum and that dopamine neurons which project to other brain areas do not pass through the striatum, with the notable exception of dopamine neurons that project to the cortex (Aransay et al., 2015, Cebrian and Prensa, 2010, Matsuda et al., 2009, Gauthier et al., 1999). Although the cortex shows much weaker labeling of dopamine axons than other areas (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), axons passing under VS potentially contributed to the signals in VS (Aransay et al., 2015). The axon tract from the midbrain to the forebrain runs along the ventral part of the brain, so any contamination of our signal was much more likely in VS than TS. Third, dopamine neurons that project to TS and VS are largely segregated and we did not observe axons passing through the opposite targets. Notably, dopamine neurons that target a particularly part of the striatum seldom pass through other parts of the striatum (Aransay et al., 2015, Cebrian and Prensa, 2010, Matsuda et al., 2009, Gauthier et al., 1999).
