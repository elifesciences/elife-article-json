A quantitative understanding of the behavioral changes upon metabolic challenges is key to a mechanistic dissection of how animals maintain nutritional homeostasis. We used an automated video tracking setup to characterize how amino acid and reproductive states interact to shape exploitation and exploration decisions taken by adult <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. We find that these two states have specific effects on the decisions to stop at and leave proteinaceous food patches. Furthermore, the internal nutrient state defines the exploration-exploitation trade-off: nutrient-deprived flies focus on specific patches while satiated flies explore more globally. Finally, we show that olfaction mediates the efficient recognition of yeast as an appropriate protein source in mated females and that octopamine is specifically required to mediate homeostatic postmating responses without affecting internal nutrient sensing. Internal states therefore modulate specific aspects of exploitation and exploration to change nutrient selection."

A quantitative understanding of the behavioral changes upon metabolic challenges is key to a mechanistic dissection of how animals maintain nutritional homeostasis. We used an automated video tracking setup to characterize how amino acid and reproductive states interact to shape exploitation and exploration decisions taken by adult <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. We find that these two states have specific effects on the decisions to stop at and leave proteinaceous food patches. Furthermore, the internal nutrient state defines the exploration-exploitation trade-off: nutrient-deprived flies focus on specific patches while satiated flies explore more globally. Finally, we show that olfaction mediates the efficient recognition of yeast as an appropriate protein source in mated females and that octopamine is specifically required to mediate homeostatic postmating responses without affecting internal nutrient sensing. Internal states therefore modulate specific aspects of exploitation and exploration to change nutrient selection."

The emerging picture is that there is a trade-off between reproduction and longevity driven by the protein-to-carbohydrate ratio in the diet: a low ratio extends lifespan but reduces reproductive output, while a high ratio reduces lifespan but promotes offspring production (<a href=\"#bib66\">Simpson et al., 2015</a>).

We use an automated video tracking setup to characterize the exploitation and exploration of sucrose and yeast patches by flies in different dietary amino acid and mating states. We found that metabolic state and mating modulate the decisions to stop at a yeast patch and leave it. Furthermore, we describe how the internal deficit of dietary amino acids increases exploitation of proteinaceous patches and restricts global exploration and how these behaviors dynamically shift towards increasing exploration as the fly reaches satiation. Importantly, we provide two examples on how our paradigm can be used in the dissection of the genetic and neuronal mechanisms underlying nutrient decisions: First, we show that olfaction is not required to reach protein homeostasis, but that it mediates the efficient recognition of yeast as an appropriate food source in mated females. Second, we show that octopamine mediates homeostatic postmating responses, but not the effects of internal sensing of amino acid deprivation state. Our study provides a quantitative description of how the fly changes behavioral decisions to achieve homeostatic nutrient balancing as well as initial insights into the mechanisms underlying protein homeostasis."

We recorded the behavior of the fly over two hours during these nutritional decisions, and developed custom software to track the position of the fly\u2019s body and head centroids (all tracking data generated in this study are available for download from the Dryad repository [<a href=\"#bib17\">Corrales-Carvajal et al., 2016</a>]). We then extracted multiple kinematic parameters (see Materials and methods for detailed list) and computed the locomotor activity and the distance of the fly from each food patch during the whole duration of the assay (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C and D</a> and <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). Upon a detailed analysis of the distribution of head speeds when the flies were inside or outside food patches (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>) we decided to use two speed thresholds to split the locomotor activity of the flies into three types: <i>resting</i> (speed \u2264 0.2\u2009mm/s), <i>micromovement</i> (0.2\u2009mm/s &lt; speed \u2264 2\u2009mm/s) and <i>walking</i> (speed &gt; 2\u2009mm/s). Furthermore, slow walking bouts (2\u2009mm/s &lt; speed &lt; 4\u2009mm/s) that were coupled with a rapid change in angular speed were defined as <i>sharp turns</i> (2\u2009mm/s &lt; speed &lt; 4\u2009mm/s and |angular speed| \u2265 125\u00b0/s) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C and D</a>)."

In agreement with previous studies (<a href=\"#bib50\">Martin, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Robie et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib85\">Zou et al., 2011</a>), we found that more than 80% of the speeds displayed during manually annotated resting or walking periods were below 0.2\u2009mm/s or above 2\u2009mm/s, respectively (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Furthermore, we reasoned that micromovements could correspond to either grooming or feeding. Indeed, 70% of grooming fell in the micromovement category; while for manually-annotated feeding bouts, half of these periods were categorized as micromovements, the other half occurred at low speeds and were thus classified as resting. However, flies showed a very low rate of proboscis extension during feeding bouts at &lt;0.2\u2009mm/s (data not shown) and we therefore reasoned that these slow bouts had little contribution to the amount of food ingested. For this reason, we decided to use the time the fly was performing micromovements when its head was in contact with the food patch as a proxy for the time the fly spent feeding (henceforth termed <i>yeast micromovements</i> or <i>sucrose micromovements</i>). To strengthen the argument that these micromovement periods within a food patch represented mostly feeding bouts and not grooming, we used the annotated video segments to quantify the percentage of feeding and grooming during a food micromovement bout. Indeed, we observed that 92.2% of the yeast micromovements and 70.6% of the sucrose micromovements corresponded to feeding bouts (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Hence <i>sucrose</i> and <i>yeast micromovements</i> are a good way to capture the periods the fly spends feeding on a food patch."

Virgin flies displayed a preference for sucrose over yeast over the total time of the assay, while the opposite was observed in mated females (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E and G</a>). A closer look at the duration of micromovements on the two food sources, revealed very similar duration profiles between yeast and sucrose for virgin females, while a higher prevalence of long events (\u226520\u2009s) on yeast when compared to sucrose was observed in mated flies (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F and H</a>). These results suggest that for mated females, yeast has a higher salience as food source, even in fully-fed conditions. These observations are in accord with previous reports showing that mating leads to a switch in yeast preference in flies (<a href=\"#bib58\">Ribeiro and Dickson, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Vargas et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Walker et al., 2015</a>). Thus, the analysis of food micromovements allows us to capture previously-described changes in food preference elicited by mating. Furthermore, these results demonstrate that one way in which mating increases yeast preference is by inducing long feeding bouts, allowing us to make first conclusions about the behavioral mechanisms behind changes in food choice."

A concrete example of this homeostatic regulation of feeding behavior is the robust increase in preference for yeast when flies are deprived of proteinaceous food (<a href=\"#bib58\">Ribeiro and Dickson, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Vargas et al., 2010</a>). To study the behavioral strategies underlying nutritional homeostasis, we manipulated the metabolic state of the flies by letting them feed <i>ad libitum</i> on a chemically defined (holidic) medium (<a href=\"#bib57\">Piper et al., 2013</a>) during three days prior to the foraging assay. This holidic medium allows us to specifically manipulate amino acids (AA) in the diet, leaving the other macronutrients and micronutrients intact. Previous work has identified three different AA compositions having different impacts on reproduction in mated females: <i>AA+ rich</i> (supporting a high rate of egg laying)<i>, AA+ suboptimal</i> (supporting a lower rate of egg laying) and <i>AA-</i> (leading to a dramatic reduction in egg laying) (<a href=\"#bib57\">Piper et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>).

As the number of sips correlates strongly with food intake, this method enabled us to precisely measure the impact of internal states on feeding decisions. Consistent with previous observations (<a href=\"#bib58\">Ribeiro and Dickson, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Vargas et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Walker et al., 2015</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>), virgin flies showed very little interest in yeast during the whole assay, as measured by the total number of yeast sips (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2Bi</a>). Yeast feeding increased with AA deprivation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2Bii</a>), and mating (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2Biii</a>). Notably, AA-challenged mated females showed a strong increase in the number of yeast sips (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2Biv and v</a>) with the highest rate of yeast feeding in mated flies completely deprived of AAs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2Bv</a>). We next asked whether these differences in feeding behavior could be captured using the yeast and sucrose micromovements measured using the tracking setup. Indeed, we observed that the yeast micromovements increased in the same way as the yeast sips after AA challenges in virgin and mated females (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>)."

Flies are therefore capable of sensing deficits in AAs and of compensating by specifically increasing feeding and micromovements on yeast, an AA-rich substrate. Furthermore, this homeostatic response is modulated by the mating state of the fly. Our tracking approach is therefore now a validated strategy to uncover the changes in behavioral strategies elicited by different internal states and how these changes allow the animal to reach homeostasis."

This type of visualization revealed that the behavior towards yeast was highly variable. The observed increase in the total duration of yeast micromovements across the different internal state conditions seems to come from the combination of two factors: on one hand, the proportion of flies that showed any interest in yeast at all (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>) and on the other hand, the strength of the interest displayed by these flies, measured by the total duration of yeast micromovements. The behavior towards yeast was also highly variable across individuals of the same condition. For example, the total duration of yeast micromovements displayed by AA-deprived flies ranged from 5 to 59 min. Still, the initial steep increase in yeast micromovements during the first 30 min of the assay was very consistent (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2Ev</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Overall, the variability increased as a function of deprivation (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>). The reaction to internal state changes is therefore highly variable across individuals. However, full AA deprivation in mated females leads to a robust population-wide effect, highlighting the importance of AAs for the animal."

We decided to call these events <i>visits</i> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a> and inset in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). A <i>visit</i> is defined as all consecutive bouts of micromovements on the same patch, for as long as the fly stayed in close proximity of the patch. As we observed in the total duration of yeast micromovements, the total duration of yeast visits increased as a result of mating and AA deprivation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Therefore, we hypothesized that the fly increases yeast intake by changing different aspects of its foraging decisions, such as <i>approaching</i> a patch more often, <i>stopping at</i> it more and/or <i>leaving</i> it less often. We measured approaching, stopping and leaving decisions by quantifying the number of encounters, the fraction of encounters in which the fly stops on a patch (<i>visits</i>) and the duration of visits, respectively. One easy way to increase the total time on yeast would be to approach yeast patches more often. However, none of the internal state modifications leading to an increase in yeast intake caused an increase in the total number of yeast encounters (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Furthermore, the rate of encounters remains constant across internal states, with the exception of the mated fully AA-deprived females (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>), which had a low absolute number of encounters (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>).

Surprisingly, pre-feeding mated flies with the suboptimal diet caused a dramatic increase in the probability of stopping at a yeast patch (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). The strong effect on the decision to stop shows that flies are able to homeostatically modify their behavior in response to even subtle dietary differences that have a negative impact on their fitness (<a href=\"#bib57\">Piper et al., 2013</a>). This is even more striking considering that the removal of all AAs does not lead to further changes in the <i>stopping</i> and <i>leaving</i> decisions, despite its drastic impact on egg production and yeast feeding (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>)."

We therefore speculated that instead of modulating exploratory decisions, a lack of AAs could increase the motivation of the flies to exploit the yeast patch. Indeed, the time course of yeast visits (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>) shows that AA-deprived flies displayed a sharp increase in the total duration of yeast visits during the first minutes, while flies pre-fed a suboptimal AA diet displayed a much more delayed and shallower increase in this parameter. As these early visits were also longer (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), we measured the time it took each fly to engage in its first 'long' (\u226530\u00a0s) visit (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1C and D</a>), and found that AA-deprived flies indeed attained their first long yeast visit much sooner than flies fed a suboptimal diet (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>): the median latency for AA-deprived flies was just 4.38\u2009min (IQR = 2.08\u20137.7), which was three times shorter than the 12.37\u2009min (IQR = 19.87\u20139.86) observed in flies fed with the suboptimal diet.

In fact, deprived flies ventured much more into the food patch as quantified by the fact that during a visit, their average minimum distance from the patch center was much smaller (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>) and that they covered a larger area of the resource (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>).

Accordingly, these flies had fewer resting bouts and more sharp turns (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4J</a>). These changes in behavior observed on the food patch were only induced by a complete lack of AAs, as there was no difference in these parameters between mated females pre-fed the rich diet versus those pre-fed the suboptimal diet (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). All these data are in agreement with an increase in yeast exploitation upon full AA deprivation. Flies lacking AAs would be more 'eager' to exploit and therefore ingest yeast, leading to a strong increase in yeast feeding as observed using the flyPAD (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>)."

As video tracking does not give us access to the fine structure of the proboscis motor program, we used the flyPAD technology to characterize the changes in the microstructure of feeding upon AA deprivation. Pre-feeding flies a suboptimal diet led to a decrease only in the inter-burst-interval (IBI) when compared to flies kept on a rich diet (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>) while the number of sips in each feeding burst did not change (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3C</a>). Full AA deprivation, however, led to a strong increase in the number of sips per burst with only a mild further decrease in the IBI. These effects are very similar to those observed upon mating in yeast-deprived females, which leads to both a decrease in the inter-burst interval and an increase in the number of yeast sips per burst (<a href=\"#bib79\">Walker et al., 2015</a>)."

Therefore, we analyzed the rhythmic feeding motor pattern and observed that it was only slightly modified by dietary AA levels (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3D and E</a>). The mode of the inter-sip-interval distributions decreased from 0.08\u2009s in mated females pre-fed the rich diet to 0.07\u2009s when pre-fed the suboptimal diet (p=0.0045, Wilcoxon rank-sum test with Bonferroni correction), while no further change was observed when they were pre-fed the AA\u2212 diet (0.07\u2009s, p=1). However, the mode of the sip duration distributions did not change when mated flies pre-fed a suboptimal diet were compared to females kept on a rich diet (0.12\u2009s, p=0.1196), but it decreased when flies were pre-fed the AA\u2212 diet (0.11\u2009s, p=0.0067). Taken together, while AA deprivation has minimal effects on the decision to stop at a proteinaceous food patch and leave it, this metabolic manipulation leads to drastic changes in its exploitation. The described changes in activity are likely to support an increased intake of the yeast resource, which is further promoted by a change in the feeding motor pattern of the fly. The increase in exploitation can also be interpreted as an increase in local, resource-directed exploration which could aid the micro-optimization of food intake within non-homogenous natural food patches."

Challenging flies with a suboptimal diet (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>) or one lacking all AAs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>) significantly altered their exploratory behavior: they strongly reduced their probability of transitioning to distant yeast patches (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>) and increased the probability of transitioning to adjacent yeast patches (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). Further, in contrast to the fully-fed flies, AA-challenged flies showed a strong increase in their probability of returning to the same yeast patch (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). As one would expect, these changes in behavior are also seen as a decrease in the average distance traveled by animals during transitions to yeast (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>). Dietary AA challenges therefore lead to a switch from global to local exploration (see example traces in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013C</a>). One of the most striking changes is the strong increase in returns to the same yeast patch upon AA deprivation. This change in exploratory strategy leads to an effective additional increase in the time on the same yeast patch without requiring a change in the decision to leave it. Taken together, these changes in exploratory strategy should enable the fly to efficiently increase the intake of yeast while minimizing the distance traveled to the next patch. It also allows the fly to focus on a resource whose quality she knows while avoiding testing food patches of unknown qualities, thereby reducing exploratory risk."

As a proof of principle of how our setup could be used to uncover the neuronal mechanisms underlying foraging decisions, we decided to analyze the role of olfaction in nutrient homeostasis. Olfactory sensory neurons in <i>Drosophila</i> express two main types of chemosensory receptors: Odorant Receptors (OR) and Ionotropic glutamate receptors (IRs) (<a href=\"#bib62\">Rytz et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Vosshall and Stocker, 2007</a>). The OR type of olfactory receptors have been shown to significantly contribute to the olfactory detection of yeast over large distances (<a href=\"#bib5\">Becher et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Christiaens et al., 2014</a>) and are known to mediate physiological responses to yeast odors (<a href=\"#bib46\">Libert et al., 2007</a>). We therefore focused on the function of these receptors in homeostatic yeast feeding by tracking the foraging behavior of flies lacking <i>Orco</i>, a co-receptor essential for OR function (<a href=\"#bib42\">Larsson et al., 2004</a>). Unexpectedly, we observed that in general upon AA deprivation, <i>Orco</i> mutants showed a similar total duration of yeast visits as controls (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). However, upon closer inspection of the time course of yeast visits, we observed that flies with impaired olfaction had a very long latency to engage in a long yeast visit when compared to the genetic controls (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B\u2013D</a>, see also <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a> and <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

To test whether octopamine was also required for mediating changes in yeast feeding behavior upon AA deprivation, we used the flyPAD technology. <i>T\u03b2h<sup>nM18</sup> </i>virgin flies were able to increase the number of sips after AA deprivation to a similar extent as control flies (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a> and <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>) showing that octopamine is not involved in translating the internal state of AA deprivation into increased yeast intake. Overall, these results confirm that the decisions to stop at a yeast patch and leave it are strongly modulated by mating. They also show that octopamine mediates these postmating responses towards yeast, but is not required to sense the internal AA deprivation state. These results provide a first step towards dissecting the role of octopamine in nutrient homeostasis."

But which behavioral alterations underlie such changes in preference? Here we use an automated video tracking setup to quantitatively capture the behavioral adaptations to AA and mating state changes that allow the animal to maintain nutrient homeostasis. We started by separating the behaviors flies display towards food into discrete decisions: the decision to approach a food patch, the decision to stop at it, and the decision to leave it (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>). Strikingly, mating and AA challenges induced compensatory behaviors towards yeast patches but not sucrose patches, indicating that the fly changes its exploitation decisions in a resource specific way. Furthermore, internal state modifications impact specific decisions to a different extent. While mating had a major effect on the probability of a fly leaving a yeast patch, AA challenges strongly increased the probability of stopping at a food patch. Nevertheless, the effect of AA deprivation on the decision to stop at a food patch was strongly dependent on mating suggesting that both internal states act synergistically to increase yeast intake. Furthermore, while full AA deprivation leads to a strong increase in yeast feeding when compared to flies kept on a suboptimal diet, the described decisions were not further altered by this drastic nutritional manipulation. There was, however, a considerable decrease in the latency to visit yeast patches for a long time and a general increase in parameters related to the 'eagerness' of the fly to exploit the resource (latency to engage on a yeast visit, locomotor activity on the patch and area of patch covered). Internal states, therefore, alter feeding in specific ways, allowing the fly either to spend more time on the food through the modulation of patch decisions, or to increase resource exploitation through the modulation of motivation without changing patch decisions. These specific changes allow the animal to dose its exploitatory behavior and hence the intake of nutrients over a large range (~17 fold) to match its current needs."

Internal AA levels decrease as a consequence of poor diets which induce a change in the leaving decision, inducing increased yeast intake. Octopamine mediates the postmating changes in the foraging decisions of stopping at the yeast patch and leaving it upon encounter. As the internal AA levels decrease in mated females, their exploration patterns switch from global exploration to local exploration and multiple returns to the same yeast patch."

Such modularity has been previously described in the organization of motor output, such as locomotion (<a href=\"#bib39\">Kiehn, 2016</a>), swimming (<a href=\"#bib32\">Huang et al., 2013</a>), grooming (<a href=\"#bib64\">Seeds et al., 2014</a>), and feeding (<a href=\"#bib35\">Itskov et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Walker et al., 2015</a>). This accumulated evidence suggests that the nervous system uses different mechanisms and hence circuits to change specific aspects of behavioral outcomes or decisions and that these changes add up to reach a specific goal. In agreement with this model, it has been shown that the impact of different starvation times on gustatory input relies on different mechanisms (<a href=\"#bib34\">Inagaki et al., 2012</a>). Similarly, our data show that octopamine is specifically required for mediating the changes in yeast decisions observed upon mating but not upon AA deprivation (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>). Nevertheless, some decisions, such as the decision to stop at a yeast patch, seem to be synergistically gated by both the mating and the AA state of the fly. It will be interesting to dissect how different internal states act at the circuit level to change behavioral decisions: do they act differentially on specific neuronal populations, or is the observed synergism a reflection of the different internal states acting on the same set of neurons?"

This effect is reminiscent of the large individual differences observed in human physiology in response to identical diets (<a href=\"#bib84\">Zeevi et al., 2015</a>). While such behavioral differences can stem from different metabolic states prior to the experiment, transgenerational effects in metabolism (<a href=\"#bib56\">\u00d6st et al., 2014</a>), or differences in the microbiota of the flies (<a href=\"#bib10\">Broderick and Lemaitre, 2012</a>), there is a real possibility that they also reflect idiosyncrasies in behavior and metabolic susceptibilities to internal state changes at the individual level. Indeed, upon AA challenges, we observed that some flies increased their total time on yeast by having many short yeast visits, while some flies had fewer but longer visits. It will be interesting to investigate if these differences reflect behavioral idiosyncrasies, as observed before in many animals including <i>Drosophila</i> (<a href=\"#bib11\">Buchanan and de Bivort, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Dingemanse et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Kain and de Bivort, 2012</a>). Differentiating between these two possibilities and identifying the physiological and circuit mechanisms leading to idiosyncrasies will be key to a better understanding of behavior. This is especially relevant for understanding metabolic conditions related to nutrition such as obesity."

Our data show that this is indeed the case, pointing to a possible important contribution of chemosensory systems to nutrient decisions. Indeed, taste processing has been shown to be changed by the mating state of the animal and to contribute to the adaptation of behavioral decisions such as food choice (<a href=\"#bib79\">Walker et al., 2015</a>) and egg laying site selection (<a href=\"#bib33\">Hussain et al., 2016</a>). The contribution of olfaction to nutrient selection is less well understood. The sense of smell is thought to be mostly important for food search behavior (<a href=\"#bib5\">Becher et al., 2010</a>), with starvation changing olfactory sensitivity to improve the finding of a food source (<a href=\"#bib61\">Root et al., 2011</a>). Our data suggest that while olfactory-impaired mated flies are able to homeostatically increase yeast intake upon AA deprivation, OR-mediated olfaction still plays an important role in their capacity to do so. Interestingly, olfaction doesn\u2019t seem to be important for locating the food but for identifying yeast as an appropriate food source. These data suggest that flies use multimodal integration to decide which food to ingest. In humans, flavor, the integration of different sensory modalities such as taste and smell, is key to the perception of food (<a href=\"#bib76\">Verhagen and Engelen, 2006</a>). Similarly, in mosquitoes olfaction acts together with other sensory cues to initiate a meal (<a href=\"#bib51\">McMeniman et al., 2014</a>). Identifying the chemosensory basis for yeast feeding decisions might therefore be a powerful way to investigate the neuronal basis of flavor perception."

                        "text": "While one would expect that internal states increase food intake by changing exploitation decisions, their effects on exploratory behaviors in our paradigm are not trivial. Exploration is key for animals to find the resources they require and to acquire information about their surrounding environment (<a href=\"#bib12\">Calhoun et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Hassell and Shouthwood, 1978</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Hills et al., 2015</a>). In our paradigm, however, animals do not need to search for resources as they are readily available. A key question then becomes why animals leave a food patch at all, especially when they are deprived of AAs (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>). The fact that they still do so means that there is a value in leaving the current food patch, even if that one provides the urgently required nutrients to produce offspring and has not been depleted yet. We can only speculate that there must be an advantage in taking the 'risk' of exploring unknown options and maybe identifying a better resource. Animals might often require other resources and leaving the current food patch might allow them to also explore the availability of these. Flies seem to nevertheless manage their exposure to uncertainty by tuning the spatial properties of their exploration. Their internal states not only define the probability of leaving a food patch, they also define if they will explore locally or more globally. The more deprived they are, the more local their exploratory pattern will be (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>). Remarkably, while the leaving probability of flies pre-exposed to a suboptimal AA diet and a diet lacking AAs looks identical, their exploratory patterns are very different. For example, AA-deprived flies display a higher rate of returns to the same patch right after leaving it. Therefore, while the neuronal processes determining staying decisions seem not to be altered between both AA-challenged states, full AA deprivation must act on the circuits controlling exploration to strongly increase the probability of revisiting the patch the fly just left. This allows the fly to de facto stay longer on the same food patch without changing its leaving decisions. We would like to propose that the apparent separate regulation of these two aspects of the fly behavior suggests that there are two separate internal state sensing processes regulating exploitation and exploration decisions. The combination of both behavioral and circuit modules would allow the fly to trade off the requirement to exploit specific resources and the 'risk' of exposing itself to resources of unknown or lower quality. Furthermore, it is interesting to note the similarity between the revisits to the same food patch we observed upon strong AA deprivation and the 'dances' observed by Vincent Dethier in the blowfly (<a href=\"#bib21\">Dethier, 1976</a>). Both phenomena are examples of how animals regulate their search behavior and exposure to uncertainty by modulating the local dynamics of their exploratory behavior, in a state-dependent manner. While the budget theory is a classic aspect of foraging theory, it has recently started to be reassessed. It is mainly controversial if energy-deprived animals, including humans, are more or less risk-prone (<a href=\"#bib37\">Kacelnik and El Mouden, 2013</a>). Our data suggest that the exploratory behavior of AA-deprived animals minimizes their exposure to uncertainty. The description of how different aspects of risk management are implemented at the behavioral level opens up the opportunity to identify the circuit mechanisms by which internal states control exploration-exploitation trade-offs and therefore how animals decide how much to expose themselves to the unknown."

This approach has allowed the field to make important contributions to the molecular and circuit basis of innumerable phenomena, including learning and memory (<a href=\"#bib30\">Heisenberg, 2015</a>), chronobiology (<a href=\"#bib40\">Konopka and Benzer, 1971</a>), innate behaviors (<a href=\"#bib20\">Demir and Dickson, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Yapici et al., 2008</a>), and sensory physiology (<a href=\"#bib42\">Larsson et al., 2004</a>). While identifying these cornerstones of neuroscience was crucial, we are now in a position to start understanding how these mechanisms act at the circuit level to perform more complex computations such as the ones used during decision-making and exploration. This endeavor requires the use of a richer and dynamic description and analysis of behavior (<a href=\"#bib25\">Gomez-Marin et al., 2014</a>). We used a combination of computer vision (<a href=\"#bib2\">Anderson and Perona, 2014</a>) and a quantitative, automated capacitance-based behavioral assay (<a href=\"#bib35\">Itskov et al., 2014</a>) with internal state and genetic manipulations to characterize and identify the behavioral changes allowing the animal to achieve homeostasis. It is interesting to consider that while we identify an important role of OR-mediated olfaction in nutrient decision-making, this would not have been possible using end-point analyses, as the animal manages to compensate for its sensory challenge using alternative means. The use of dynamic, quantitative descriptions of complex behavior therefore enables neuroscientists to decompose these into discrete processes, opening up the possibility to go beyond assigning circuits and molecules to general behaviors to start explaining how they act to control the generation of complex cognitive processes."

To ensure a homogenous density of offspring among experiments, fly cultures were always set with five females and three males per vial and left to lay eggs for three days. Flies were reared in YBM until adulthood. Three different types of holidic medium were used as described previously (<a href=\"#bib57\">Piper et al., 2013</a>) using the following formulations: 50S200NYaa (<i>AA+ rich</i>), 50S200NHUNTaa (<i>AA+ suboptimal</i>) and 50S0N (<i>AA\u2212</i>). Composition of the media is\u00a0as described in <a href=\"#bib57\">Piper et al., (2013)</a>, without food preservatives and only differ in amino acids composition. The proportion of amino acids in 50S200NYaa diet is adjusted to match that in yeast and was considered a rich diet maximizing egg laying (<a href=\"#bib57\">Piper et al., 2013</a>).

After two more days, all vials were transferred once again to fresh standard YBM. On the sixth day, all vials were transferred to fresh holidic media. Flies were left to feed <i>ad-libitum</i> for three days on the holidic media and then tested in the video tracking or flyPAD setups. Single flies were tested in individual arenas that contained two kinds of food patches: yeast (180\u2009g/L) and sucrose (180\u2009g/L), each mixed with 0.75% (tracking) or 1% (flyPAD) agarose.

The inner area containing food patches was flat and had a diameter of 50\u2009mm and a distance to the lid of 2.1\u2009mm. To allow a top-view of the fly throughout the whole experiment, the outer area of the arena had 10\u00b0 of inclination (<a href=\"#bib65\">Simon and Dickinson, 2010</a>) and the glass lid was coated with 10 \u00b5L of SigmaCote the night before the assays. Food patches were distributed in two concentric circles equidistantly from the edge. Furthermore, sucrose and yeast patches were alternated such that from a given food patch, there was at least one adjacent yeast and one adjacent sucrose patch. The radius of each food patch was approximately 1.5\u2009mm. The minimum distance between the centers of two adjacent food patches is 10\u2009mm. White LEDs 12V DC (4.8 watt/meter), were used for illumination of the arenas. They were placed under the arenas, as backlight illumination and on the walls of the behavioral box, surrounding the arenas, as shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>. A white cardboard arch was used to improve illumination to reflect light towards the arenas (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>).

The arena diameter in the video was measured to find the correspondence between pixels in the video and mm in the real world (1 pixel = 0.155\u2009mm). The typical length of the major axis of the fly body in a video was 19 pixels (~3\u00a0mm). Video acquisition was made with slight overexposure to obtain a strong contrast between the fly and the arena. Since the fly body was the darkest object in the arena, a pixel intensity threshold was used to obtain the centroid and orientation of the fly blob. The head position was extracted using custom MATLAB (Mathworks) software. Head position in the first frame was manually selected. From there on, the head position is automatically propagated to the consecutive frames using a proximity rule (<a href=\"#bib26\">Gomez-Marin et al., 2011</a>). This rule, however, does not hold during a jump of the fly. Therefore, in addition to the proximity rule, for the intervals in-between jumps, the head position was automatically corrected using the fact that flies walk forward most of the time. Manual annotation of 510 inter-jump-intervals revealed that 98% were correctly classified. All the body and head centroid tracking data generated in this study are available for download from the Dryad repository\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib17\">Corrales-Carvajal et al., 2016</a>)."

The width was chosen empirically by comparing the raw and smoothed tracks. The speed was measured from the smoothed coordinates by calculating the distance covered from the current frame and the next frame, divided by the time between them (0.02\u2009s). Similarly, the angular speed was measured by calculating the difference between the heading angle from the current frame and the next frame, divided by the time between them. The heading angle for this calculation was obtained from the head and tail smoothed centroids. Walking and non-walking instances were classified applying a 2\u2009mm/s threshold in the head speed, based on the distribution of head speed for AA-deprived flies in <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a> and previous studies (<a href=\"#bib50\">Martin, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Robie et al., 2010</a>). The head speed used was also smoothed using a Gaussian filter of 60 frames (1.2\u2009s) to avoid rapid changes in classification around the thresholds. Sharp turns were classified when a local maximum in the angular speed exceeded a 125\u00b0/s threshold, as long as the body centroid speed was below 4\u2009mm/s. A wider Gaussian filter (width of 2.4\u2009s) was applied to the head speed to classify resting bouts, using a threshold of 0.2\u2009mm/s. The remaining events during the non-walking segments that were not classified as resting were classified as micromovements."

Initially, <i>encounters</i> with a food patch were defined as the moments in which the fly crossed this 3\u2009mm distance threshold. To avoid misclassifying the transient head movement associated with grooming or feeding around this threshold as new encounters, consecutive encounters were merged when the total displacement of the head in any direction was lower or equal than 2 pixels (0.31\u2009mm) during the time elapsed in-between the encounters. From each feeding event, the distance from the head of the fly to the center of the patch was also captured. Since 95% of the first proboscis extensions happened below 2.5\u2009mm, this was the selected distance threshold to define <i>yeast</i> and <i>sucrose micromovements</i> (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). In this way, food micromovements were defined as the time in which flies were classified in a micromovement (see definition in previous section) and their head was simultaneously inside a circle of 2.5\u2009mm around the food patch (see gray dashed line in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a> inset). The two pixels displacement rule used in the definition of encounters was also applied here to avoid definitions of false new micromovements. A <i>visit</i> was defined as a series of consecutive food micromovements (already corrected for small displacements) in which the head distance to the center of the food patch was never larger than 5\u2009mm during the time elapsed in-between the food micromovements (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a> inset). 5\u2009mm is the maximum radius of non-overlapping circles around the food patches (see gray dashed line in main trajectory of <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). This 5\u2009mm threshold was also used to merge consecutive encounters (consecutive encounters were merged if the head distance to the center of the food patch was never larger than 5\u2009mm during the time in-between encounters). In this way, for every visit there is an encounter, but there can be an encounter and no visit if the fly doesn\u2019t stop at the food patch (food micromovement)."

This is more by way of a comment than a suggestion: the point is introduced and to some extent tested, but it is worth pointing out somewhere that the volume ingested during a feeding bout (meal) is a product of the duration of the feeding bout and the rate at which food is ingested across the meal. Meal size (and its volumetric and other determinants) has been shown in some insect systems to be positively correlated with ingestion rate and affected by common inputs (both homeostatic and non-homeostatic) (e.g. Animal Behav. 36: 1216-27). Hence, meal duration (which is estimated in the present set up) tends to be a more conserved variable than meal size (a fly can eat more by ingesting faster over the same meal duration). Changes in ingestion rate can result from greater amplitude of feeding central pattern generator (and hence motor) output, or greater frequency of rhythm, or through a change in intra-meal burst and interval structure. The data reported address and show a contribution from the latter, but changes in both amplitude and frequency of CPG output are also known."

My understanding is that theory and experiment (Levy flight; intrinsic (local) search vs. extrinsic search (ranging); Dethier's fly dance, etc.) predicts that flies should stay nearby \"high quality\" patches and roam more extensively when on \"lower quality\" patches. Staying nearby to an imbalanced food source when in a state of AA imbalance and roaming globally when AA balanced appears contrary to expectations and suggests something interesting, perhaps about the evolved predicted spatial distribution of protein resources in the environment, e.g. complementary imbalanced AA sources are likely to be close by to one another. In the last paragraph of the aforementioned subsection there is an unconvincing statement on this issue, which needs some more thought I think."

The blowfly dance results seem at odds with present findings \u2013 flies dance more vigorously and stay longer locally after stimulation with a higher concentration food source. The same is the case for bees and other animals (William Bell's work \u2013 e.g. see his 1990 book). It is true that greater levels of deprivation elicit greater local dancing to a given food; but still the effect is strongly dependent on food quality relative to state."

I like the analysis very much and I think it will be a welcome addition to the literature. Their method includes potential to dissect decision-making at the level of behavior and offers a world of new possibilities for evaluating the contribution of genes, development, and physiology to behavior. They note and promise that they are providing insight into mechanism as well and this part of the paper pales when compared to the behavioral analysis. The nod to mechanism occurs via the manipulation of <i>Orco</i> to demonstrate a role for smell in the behavioural strategy used by mated females. Not clear that it plays a role for the virgins because there are no data and it seems less likely but entirely possible that olfaction is used to detect or evaluate sugars. I do not think more experiments need to be performed but I think the <i>Orco</i> data provide more of a proof of principle than an exposition of mechanism and the paper would be improved if these data were presented that way. This same point applies to the tyramine \u03b2 hydroxylase experiments. The paper is written as if these data provide insight into the brain, but there are no experiments to show that brain octopamine as opposed to octopamine in the ventral nerve cord are responsible for the effects. Again, I am not suggesting that this already long manuscript needs more data, only that the nod to mechanism is more of statement of possibility than indication of genetic pathways, anatomic pathways, or neuronal circuits. The paper is more than just a \"methods paper\" because of the insights provided by this analysis of effects of environment on foraging, reproductive behavior and, potentially, decision making. The readers of <i>eLife</i> will like this one."

Meal size (and its volumetric and other determinants) has been shown in some insect systems to be positively correlated with ingestion rate and affected by common inputs (both homeostatic and non-homeostatic) (e.g. Animal Behav. 36: 1216-27). Hence, meal duration (which is estimated in the present set up) tends to be a more conserved variable than meal size (a fly can eat more by ingesting faster over the same meal duration). Changes in ingestion rate can result from greater amplitude of feeding central pattern generator (and hence motor) output, or greater frequency of rhythm, or through a change in intra-meal burst and interval structure. The data reported address and show a contribution from the latter, but changes in both amplitude and frequency of CPG output are also known.</i> "

During the assay, all flies irrespective of their internal state were tested in an arena containing food patches of the same quality (9 food patches with yeast at 180g/L and the other 9 with sucrose at 180g/L). This is important as the experimental design aims at describing the effect of different internal state on foraging in the same environment.

Their method includes potential to dissect decision making at the level of behavior and offers a world of new possibilities for evaluating the contribution of genes, development, and physiology to behavior. They note and promise that they are providing insight into mechanism as well and this part of the paper pales when compared to the behavioral analysis. The nod to mechanism occurs via the manipulation of Orco to demonstrate a role for smell in the behavioural strategy used by mated females. Not clear that it plays a role for the virgins because there are no data and it seems less likely but entirely possible that olfaction is used to detect or evaluate sugars. I do not think more experiments need to be performed but I think the Orco data provide more of a proof of principle than an exposition of mechanism and the paper would be improved if these data were presented that way. This same point applies to the tyramine \u03b2 hydroxylase experiments. The paper is written as if these data provide insight into the brain, but there are no experiments to show that brain octopamine as opposed to octopamine in the ventral nerve cord are responsible for the effects. Again, I am not suggesting that this already long manuscript needs more data, only that the nod to mechanism is more of statement of possibility than indication of genetic pathways, anatomic pathways, or neuronal circuits. The paper is more than just a \"methods paper\" because of the insights provided by this analysis of effects of environment on foraging, reproductive behavior and, potentially, decision making.
