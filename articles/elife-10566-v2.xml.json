However, the arbors of very few long-range projection neurons have been reconstructed in their entirety, as axons with diameters as small as 100 nm arborize in target regions dispersed over many millimeters of tissue. We introduce a platform for high-resolution, three-dimensional fluorescence imaging of complete tissue volumes that enables the visualization and reconstruction of long-range axonal arbors. This platform relies on a high-speed two-photon microscope integrated with a tissue vibratome and a suite of computational tools for large-scale image data. We demonstrate the power of this approach by reconstructing the axonal arbors of multiple neurons in the motor cortex across a single mouse brain."

However, the arbors of very few long-range projection neurons have been reconstructed in their entirety, as axons with diameters as small as 100 nm arborize in target regions dispersed over many millimeters of tissue. We introduce a platform for high-resolution, three-dimensional fluorescence imaging of complete tissue volumes that enables the visualization and reconstruction of long-range axonal arbors. This platform relies on a high-speed two-photon microscope integrated with a tissue vibratome and a suite of computational tools for large-scale image data. We demonstrate the power of this approach by reconstructing the axonal arbors of multiple neurons in the motor cortex across a single mouse brain."

However, intermingled neurons within a brain region have heterogeneous projection patterns (<a href=\"#bib39\">Nassi and Callaway, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Shepherd, 2013</a>) and carry diverse messages in the behaving brain (<a href=\"#bib30\">Li et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Movshon and Newsome, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Sato and Svoboda, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Turner and DeLong, 2000</a>).

Combining this technique with high-intensity, sparse neuronal labeling, a novel technique for clearing tissue, and an informatics pipeline for processing and visualizing large imaging datasets, we present a platform for efficient reconstruction of axonal morphology. We demonstrate the utility of this system by reconstructing the extensive, brain-wide axonal arborizations of diverse projection neurons in the motor cortex within a single mouse brain."

Following small structures through highly scattering brain tissue in three dimensions requires a strategy for clearing fixed tissue that is compatible with long-term imaging. Specifically, we sought an approach that preserved the native fluorescence of fluorescent proteins, introduced little background autofluorescence, effectively cleared gray and white matter, was compatible with serial sectioning, and that could be used as a stable, long-term immersion medium during extended imaging sessions. We evaluated the compatibility of a number of recently described techniques (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chung and Deisseroth, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Ert\u00fcrk et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Hama et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Ke et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Renier et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Susaki et al., 2014</a>). Strategies employing organic solvents (i.e. 3Disco, iDisco) quenched fluorescent proteins produced hard, brittle tissue that could not be sectioned. Clearing agents requiring high-index saturated solutions (i.e. SeeDB, Clarity, CUBIC) were not robust to evaporation and solutes precipitated during extended imaging experiments. Sca<i>l</i>e expanded tissue, attenuated fluorescence, and resulted in unstable tissue geometry. Due to these incompatibilities, we sought an alternative method meeting these requirements."

                                "text": "We devised a clearing medium comprised of a ternary mixture of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), <span class=\"small-caps\"><span class=\"small-caps\">d</span></span>-sorbitol, and aqueous buffer (see Methods). DMSO was chosen due to its high refractive index (1.479) and extensive use in mounting medium formulations for fluorescence microscopy. The sugar alcohol <span class=\"small-caps\">d</span>-sorbitol was found to be highly soluble in DMSO and, unlike <span class=\"small-caps\">d</span>-fructose (<a href=\"#bib25\">Ke et al., 2013</a>), may be obtained at high purity without autofluorescent contaminants and does not cause non-enzymatic browning of biological tissue. Aqueous buffer was added to preserve green fluorescent protein (eGFP) fluorescence (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2b,c</a>). The high refractive index of the resulting solution (1.468) reduced light scattering in tissue by minimizing index mismatches with lipid- and protein-rich brain structures (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a</a>). The excellent tissue penetrance of these reagents further contributed to a high degree of clearing of white and gray matter in whole brains. We note that the use of subsaturating <span class=\"small-caps\">d</span>-sorbitol solutions was important for preventing precipitation or gellation of the mixture following the evaporation and mechanical agitation that accompanies long (&gt;1 week) imaging sessions. Another key advantage of this medium over other clearing agents is its low viscosity; serial sections with consistent thickness were difficult to obtain in viscous media. This approach allowed small structures, including fine axons, to be imaged with minimal signal attenuation at imaging depths &gt;200 \u03bcm (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2d\u2013f</a>). Samples could be reliably sectioned and imaged over the course of many days and stored for many months without adverse effects on fluorescent labels or gross changes in brain volume (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a</a>). Hence, this medium met the requirements for high-resolution volumetric imaging and serial sectioning."

Sparse labeling was achieved by expressing Cre recombinase with a highly diluted adeno-associated virus while simultaneously delivering a Cre-dependent high-titer reporter virus coding for a fluorescent reporter (e.g. eGFP)\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib67\">Xu et al., 2012</a>). Using this labeling strategy, 10\u201350 motor cortical neurons could be routinely labeled with high intensity in each brain. Brightly-labeled neurons were likely infected with a single copy of the viral plasmid encoding Cre but with many copies of the reporter gene, thereby driving high expression in few cells. High-intensity labeling (e.g. with viral vectors encoding bright fluorescent proteins like eGFP or tdTomato) was necessary for high-contrast imaging of thin fibers. Using this labeling strategy, fine, long-range axonal collaterals\u2014such as those innervating the contralateral motor cortex\u2014were easily detected and resolved. These fibers were clearly discernable even in a maximum intensity projection through a large volume of tissue (2.3 \u00d7 1.3 \u00d7 1.0 mm) corresponding to &gt;200 individual 3D tiles (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4b</a>). The high excitation power needed to image axons with high SNR was not found to have a detrimental effect on the resolution of our imaging system due to fluorophore saturation, as has been suggested (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) (<a href=\"#bib70\">Zipfel et al., 2003</a>)."

Axonal segments associated with brightly labeled somata remained well-labeled through white matter tracts, at branch points, and at their termini in distant structures, indicating high labeling intensity throughout each arbor (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5b</a>). We quantified the SNR across 52 axonal cross sections selected to represent a range of axonal morphologies.

Even with sparse labeling, axonal segments of similar caliber but originating from different somata cross paths with separations smaller than the diffraction limit of light, introducing uncertainty in the assignment of axonal identity following crossover points. In the past, the inability to unambiguously follow single processes has precluded extensive reconstruction of fine axonal collaterals in datasets containing multiple labeled neurons in the same brain region (<a href=\"#bib17\">Gong et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Zheng et al., 2013</a>). Since the error rate in manual and automatic reconstruction of axonal processes from light microscopy datasets depends strongly upon the density of neurites within a local volume (<a href=\"#bib14\">Gala et al., 2014</a>), we assessed the feasibility of complete axonal reconstruction in this dataset. We attempted to reconstruct the full axonal morphology of the same cohort of neurons depicted in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>. The high density of processes at the site of viral injection - the region containing the highest density of labeled somata - prevented unambiguous reconstruction of many processes in this area due to axonal crossovers (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5c</a>). However, we found that the long-distance axonal projections of these neurons and their fine collaterals in target regions could be accurately reconstructed to a high degree of completeness (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6a</a>; <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). This level of completeness was facilitated by the labeling sparsity, high resolution imaging, and lack of discontinuities in the dataset. Furthermore, 3\u201312 mm of axon could be reconstructed per hour, depending on local density\u2014a substantial increase in throughput over classical serial-section reconstruction methods, even when samples contained only a single labeled neuron (<a href=\"#bib65\">Wittner et al., 2007</a>)."

White dot corresponds to the same location in both panels and corresponds approximately to the path of manually traced segment. The SNR of well-labeled axons remains high along their entire length and branch points are clearly visible. Nuclei (magenta) were counter-labeled using NuclearID-Red. Two axons, originating from distinct neurons, cross in the corpus callosum. Axon identity is straightforward to assign in this example on the basis of trajectory and labeling intensity when viewed in three\u00a0dimensions. This neuron appears blue in all figures."

These neurons possessed extensive axon collaterals with each cell targeting a surprisingly diverse set of brain areas (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6a</a>). Together, the total axon length of these five neurons exceeded 300 mm (range: 23.6\u2013121.2 mm) and innervated 28 distinct brain regions (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). The arborization of one individual layer V neuron was found to cover nearly the entire extent of the brain in the coronal plane (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6b</a>) and approximately half of the brain along the rostrocaudal axis, underscoring the importance of whole-brain imaging for determining axonal projection patterns. Interestingly, this neuron included an extensive projection to the taenia tecta (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6b</a>), a region that exhibits only very sparse axonal labeling in bulk anterograde tracing experiments from motor cortex (C. Gerfen, unpublished data; Allen Connectivity Atlas: <a href=\"http://connectivity.brain-map.org/projection/experiment/141603190\">connectivity.brain-map.org/projection/experiment/141603190</a>), further highlighting the diversity in projection patterns of similar neurons within a single brain region. Following our approach, we were able to reconstruct axon morphologies to a high degree of completeness. As a result, the ensemble of downstream targets could be precisely identified for single neurons, and, furthermore, the extent and location of collaterals in all target regions."

For example, in this limited dataset, all four reconstructed IT neurons projected to the contralateral motor cortex. The contralateral cortical projections of the two layer V neurons spanned a similar distance along the anterior\u2013posterior (A\u2013P) axis (red: 2152 um; black: 2096 um). However, their terminal fields were offset along this axis by an amount closely mirroring the A-P offset between their corresponding somata (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7a,b</a>; distance between projection centroids = 490 \u00b5m, A-P distance between somata = 513 um). This relationship suggests that these projections might target a continuum of cortical locations rather than a single discrete structure. In contrast, the contralateral cortical projection of both layer II neurons targeted a similar location along the A-P axis more posterior than both somata (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7c,d</a>; distance between projection centroids = 32 \u00b5m; A-P distance between somata = 271 \u00b5m).

This challenge can be mitigated by imaging with the highest available resolution and imposing a high degree of labeling sparsity\u2014but cannot be eliminated entirely. In the example dataset presented here, excessive labeling density was largely limited to the site of virus injection and therefore only precluded the extensive reconstruction of local fibers. Biological questions focused on local collaterals will require alternative labeling strategies that achieve greater separation between labeled somata to mitigate this limitation.

A voltage bias was applied at the amplifier to take advantage of the digitizer\u2019s full range. The digitizer generated records 16k samples wide at a rate of 8 kHz (256 MB/s/channel). These lines were distorted due to the spatially non-linear motion of the resonant mirror. Because of this, they were resampled using a cosine lookup table in a manner that is photoefficient (discards no samples) and avoids aliasing.

This software incorporates several features that ensure reliable operation spanning days to weeks. First, to guarantee an overlapping volume is reimaged after sectioning, the acquisition software applies a surface-finding procedure and adjusts the focal plane to ensure that tiles begin at the tissue surface. In this procedure, the surface is identified by searching for the top of the tissue by imaging autofluorescence in a subset of tiles with a coarse Z spacing around the expected surface position. Second, algorithms monitor the data quality of the incoming video stream to detect, for example, a photodetector fault. Third, to ensure that high data rates can be sustained over long acquisition times with high fidelity, data are locally cached on a solid-state hard drive (840 pro; Samsung) and asynchronously transferred to a highly-redundant network file system. Fourth, in the event of a fault, operation is safely halted and may resume from the point at which the fault occurred."

After the top plane of the sample is positioned under the objective, a region of interest is determined by probing tiles across a designated search area. A single autofluorescence image is acquired at the bottom of each tile and classified based on whether it intersects the sample with a preset intensity threshold. When a tile that intersects the sample is found, neighboring tiles are searched in such a way as to trace the perimeter of the tissue. Tiles inside the perimeter are marked for imaging without being explicitly probed for efficiency. Finally the region of interest is dilated by one tile to ensure that tiles only partially intersecting the tissue sample are also acquired. The search process is finished when all the tiles in the search area have been classified. The marked region of interest is then imaged by sequentially volume-scanning constituent tiles. After all the tiles within the marked region of interest are imaged, the vibratome is engaged and a programmed stage motion feeds the sample through the blade to remove the top layer of tissue. The sample is translated back under the objective such that the newly exposed tissue surface is aligned with the focal plane and the process is repeated until no further tiles are found to image."

Because of the large number of tile pairs (&gt;15,000 per brain), this procedure was distributed across a high-performance computing cluster. Compute time was approximately 1 min per tile pair (RAM 128 GB; 16 Intel E5-2680 CPUs). A set of common features, such as punctate auto-fluorescent bodies (lipofuscin; <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) (<a href=\"#bib10\">Dowson and Harris, 1981</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Terman and Brunk, 2004</a>), restricted to the putative overlap volume was successfully determined in approximately 2/3 of all tile pairs.

Although only axially-adjacent tile pairs were registered, tile pairs could be displaced relative to one another in all three Cartesian coordinates, necessitating the determination of deformation in three dimensions. This 3D displacement field was parameterized laterally for each (x,y) position across the section plane (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b</a>). After the displacement fields between the current section and the sections above and below the current layer were determined, a 3D transform was computed to update the position of each tile within the full imaged volume. To solve for the transform, eight control points were determined for each tile at points offset slightly from the tile corners and located at the centroid of the overlap regions of neighboring tiles. Except in edge cases, there were seven overlapping tiles in the vicinity of each tile corner. These control points formed a regular grid across each section. Sampling the vector field at the centroid of these overlap regions is important for maintaining lateral continuity. We approximated the projection of these points from pixel space into the global coordinate space using a unique affine transform for each tile. Although useful for registration purposes, the presence of lipofuscin was sometimes undesirable during the tracing process even though these puncta were generally straightforward to disambiguate from labeled neurites. Due to the broad emission spectrum of these features, however, they could be computationally removed using standard linear spectral unmixing techniques. After this procedure, unmixed images - -\u00a0computed from two-channel image tiles - contained only eGFP-labeled structures. Images in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3</a>\u2013<a href=\"#fig5\">5</a> and <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a> were unmixed according to <i>U</i>\u00a0=\u00a0<i>G</i>\u00a0\u2212\u00a0<i>kR</i>, where <i>U</i> is the unmixed image, <i>G</i> is the green channel of the original image, and <i>R</i> is the red channel of the original image. <i>k</i> is an empirically-determined scale factor."

Resampling was achieved by back-projecting each voxel in each output tile to one or more input tiles where the nearest voxel was sampled. To avoid aliasing, input tiles were pre-filtered with a Gaussian kernel\u00a0(sigma = 150 nm). In regions where two or more input tiles overlapped, the maximum intensity was used for the corresponding location in the output tile. The resampling task was implemented on a GPU, which ensured that execution time was dominated by the time required to read input data. Work was distributed output tile-wise over a GPU cluster (20 nodes with 7\u00d7 GTX 580 1.5GB VRAM). Importantly, each node had parallel access to high-bandwidth network storage.

The authors should provide data showing that the other clearing methods are not compatible with their approach.</i>The clearing methods listed were not adopted because one or more properties rendered them fundamentally incompatible with long-term sectioning and imaging. The table below summarizes the specific incompatibilities of each clearing technique with long-term fluorescence imaging integrated with serial sectioning.

Instead, we only attempt to describe the rationale for the methodological choices made in developing our approach. For this reason, we believe that the revised discussion of alternative clearing techniques in the text is a more appropriate way to strengthen the revised manuscript than the inclusion of this table or additional data. A complete, quantitative evaluation of each clearing technique across all relevant parameters would be a considerable undertaking and it is not clear that this would strengthen the major conclusions of our study. Furthermore, many of the deficiencies that we describe have been confirmed in an additional study published while our manuscript has been under revision (Hama et al., 2015)."

Statistics describing the distribution of signal to noise values are now reported in the updated Results (\u201cReconstruction of long-distance axonal morphology\u201d,paragraph one), but varied widely (peak z-score: 15.0 \u00b1 2.9; median \u00b1 s.e.m.; 5-95% range: 7.0\u201370.7). This variability follows from the heterogeneity of neuronal labeling and, more importantly, the precise spatial location chosen along each axon, as axon diameters vary considerably, even along local (~10 \u00b5m) segments. The authors highlight <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a> as compelling evidence that axons can be imaged with high signal-to-noise along their entire length.
