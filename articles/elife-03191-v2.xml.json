In this study, we show <i>Drosophila</i> ZIP13 (Slc39a13), a presumed zinc importer, fulfills the iron effluxing role. Interfering with dZIP13 expression causes iron-rescuable iron absorption defect, simultaneous iron increase in the cytosol and decrease in the secretory compartments, failure of ferritin iron loading, and abnormal collagen secretion. dZIP13 expression in <i>E. coli</i> confers upon the host iron-dependent growth and iron resistance. Importantly, time-coursed transport assays using an iron isotope indicated a potent iron exporting activity of dZIP13. The identification of dZIP13 as an iron transporter suggests that the spondylocheiro dysplastic form of Ehlers\u2013Danlos syndrome, in which hZIP13 is defective, is likely due to a failure of iron delivery to the secretory compartments. Our results also broaden our knowledge of the scope of defects from iron dyshomeostasis."

In addition, iron is a necessary component in the secretory pathway. For example, lysyl hydroxylase (LH, also referred to as PLOD) and collagen prolyl 4-hydroxylases (P4Hs) are two post-translational modifying enzymes localized to the lumen of endoplasmic reticulum, which use Fe<sup>2+</sup> as a cofactor (<a href=\"#bib39\">Tuderman et al., 1977</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Pirskanen et al., 1996</a>). These two enzymes are critical for the synthesis of collagen, a crucial part of the basement membrane, and are formed by a complicated process involving multiple co- or post-translational modifications (<a href=\"#bib27\">Myllyharju and Kivirikko, 2004</a>). While the types of collagens and genes found in mammals are very complex, only one type of collagen IV, encoded by two genes <i>Viking</i> (<i>Vkg</i>) and <i>Cg25C</i>, is found in <i>Drosophila</i>, and it constitutes a major structural component of basement membranes in the developing fly (<a href=\"#bib7\">Fessler and Fessler, 1989</a>)."

Our work thus identified the iron transporter required for iron loading in the secretory pathway, which is also the first time a ZIP member has been reported as an iron exporter. This finding implies that failure of iron delivery to the secretory compartments is probably the underlying cause for SCD-EDS (the spondylocheiro dysplastic Ehlers\u2013Danlos syndrome, OMIM #612350), which is due to a mutation in hZIP13 (<a href=\"#bib8\">Fukada et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Giunta et al., 2008</a>). Because SCD-EDS displays none of the classical iron phenotypes, for example, anemia or iron accumulation toxicity, our results also suggest that iron dyshomeostasis is likely involved in a wider spectrum of biological abnormalities than previously thought."

Amazingly, the eclosion defect resulting from dZIP13 knockdown could be rescued from \u223c10% to \u223c75% simply through dietary iron supplementation in the form of ferric ammonium citrate (FAC) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Addition of 0.1 mM iron-specific chelator bathophenanthrolinedisulfonic acid disodium (BPS), on the other hand, exacerbated the phenotype as an even lower eclosion rate was observed (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), indicating abnormal iron absorption indeed plays a critical role in causing the eclosion defect in <i>dZIP13-RNAi</i> flies. Zinc, a substrate of many ZIP proteins, also to some extent exacerbate the eclosion defect. When zinc was added to the diet, almost no adult flies could eclose (\u223c0% eclosion rate); however, addition of zinc chelator TPEN could ameliorate the phenotype slightly, although without statistical significance (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). There have been several reports showing that iron absorption can be competitively inhibited by additional zinc (<a href=\"#bib32\">Rossander-Hulten et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Whittaker, 1998</a>). From that perspective it is possible that zinc addition to the food could exacerbate the iron deficiency phenotype of <i>dZIP13-RNAi</i> flies. Simultaneous addition of both zinc and iron could still rescue the eclosion defect very effectively (\u223c65% eclosion rate, statistically insignificant with iron only). The wild type flies' eclosion rate, in contrast, remained the same either in iron supplemented or deficient, zinc supplemented or deficient food (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). The dramatic rescue by iron instead of zinc suggests that lack of iron is the primary defect in <i>dZIP13-RNAi</i> flies, and the zinc effect is minimal and likely secondary. As a result of this unexpected finding, our original focus of dZIP13's function in zinc homeostasis was subsequently switched to investigating its role in iron homeostasis."

Ferritin, a heteropolymer composed of H and L subunits, can accommodate thousands of iron atoms in its protein shell in the ferric form. Ferritin is thought to be the major cytosolic iron-storage protein in mammalian organisms (<a href=\"#bib1\">Andrews, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Knovich et al., 2009</a>), while in <i>Drosophila</i>, unlike mammals, ferritin sequences of both the H and L chains contain secretion signals, confining them to the secretory pathway and making them abundant in the hemolymph (<a href=\"#bib28\">Nichol et al., 2002</a>). A major function of <i>Drosophila</i> ferritin is absorption of dietary iron through iron loading and transporting via the secretory pathway supplying iron for the systemic use (<a href=\"#bib35\">Tang and Zhou, 2013b</a>). If dZIP13 is responsible for iron loading into the early secretory pathway, we expect it might affect ferritin iron assimilation."

In the iron cell region (a cluster of cells in the middle midgut region where iron absorption occurs) of <i>dZIP13-RNAi</i> larvae, we were unable to detect obvious iron signal, whereas a distinct blue iron-staining signal could be observed in the normal fly larvae (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement1</a>), suggesting a lack of iron incorporation into ferritin after dZIP13 interference. Conversely, overexpression of dZIP13 led to a stronger staining in the iron cell region, and ectopically in the anterior midgut (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement1</a>). This result is reminiscent of the observation that high iron levels, such as 5 mM FAC, can also induce ectopic ferric iron staining in the anterior midgut, suggesting an iron accumulation occurs in the secretory pathway of the gut cells when dZIP13 is overexpressed. Under high levels of dietary iron, iron was only faintly stained in the <i>dZIP13-RNAi</i> larvae, whereas staining was much stronger in dZIP13 overexpression larvae (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). This indicates that in the gut of <i>dZIP13-RNAi</i> larvae much less ferric ion is accumulated in ferritin. A native-PAGE staining for ferric iron further confirmed that the intestinal ferritin was indeed poorly loaded with iron in the <i>dZIP13-RNAi</i> larvae while the iron loading in the <i>dZIP13-OE</i> larvae was mildly elevated (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement2</a>)."

The potential intracellular localization of dZIP13 makes direct assays of its metal transporting activity with intact cells difficult. We reasoned that if dZIP13 indeed functions as a membrane iron exporter, when expressed in <i>E. coli</i>, a heterologous platform lacking the sophisticated intracellular membrane system as in eukaryote cells, it might locate to the plasma membrane and facilitate iron cellular export directly outside of the cell. Interestingly, expression of dZIP13 in <i>E. coli</i> resulted in very poor growth under normal conditions. Strikingly, growth was partially restored in iron replete conditions whereas zinc had no effect (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>), indicating the lack of growth of <i>E. coli</i> with dZIP13 expression was due to intracellular iron deficiency. dZIP13 expression also rendered <i>E. coli</i> more resistant to iron stresses compared with the control (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Further analysis of cellular iron contents indicated that with iron-rich medium (2 mM iron), expression of dZIP13 reduced the iron level of the cells, while the change of zinc was insignificant (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). These results suggest that heterologous expression of dZIP13 in <i>E. coli</i>, a foreign and arguably a relatively clean system, can reduce intracellular iron availability to cells."

One experiment to show a protein as an iron exporter is via a radioactive Fe transport assay. Ferroportin, a plasma membrane iron exporter, for example, has been successfully shown to mediate iron export in <i>Xenopus</i> oocytes, by using Fe isotopes and measuring intracellular and extracellular radioactivity levels (<a href=\"#bib6\">Donovan et al., 2000</a>). However, as stated above, dZIP13 is located intracellularly and its expression would only directly alter redistribution of iron inside the cell rather than exporting iron out of the cell, as was seen with ferroportin in the oocyte. In order to show dZIP13 indeed acts as an iron exporter, we decided to measure iron effluxing activity of dZIP13 when expressed in <i>E. coli</i>, taking advantage of the fact that the only membrane an <i>E. coli</i> cell has is its plasma membrane. When dZIP13 is located on the plasma membrane, the radioisotope exporting activity can be directly measured by monitoring the radioactivity in the external buffer. A time-course study of iron transportation in <i>E. coli</i> expressing dZIP13 is shown in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>. The amount of iron exported from <i>E. coli</i> expressing dZIP13 increased roughly linearly within the tested time and was significantly higher in comparison to the control. Labeling with anti-dZIP13 indicates that dZIP13 was indeed located on the membrane of <i>E. coli</i> cells, while control with the empty vector was with minimal signal (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). These results demonstrate that dZIP13 in <i>E. coli</i> is capable of exporting iron out of the cell."

Moreover, this is the first time to report that a member of the ZIP transporter family functions as an iron exporter. Previously, certain members of ZIPs, such as ZIP14 (<a href=\"#bib20\">Liuzzi et al., 2006</a>) and ZIP8 (<a href=\"#bib44\">Wang et al., 2012</a>), have been reported to be capable of transporting iron. However, they are only complex, broad-scope metal-ion importers and their in vivo involvement in iron homeostasis is yet to be established. Our in vivo studies clearly demonstrated that expressional alteration of dZIP13 mainly affects iron instead of zinc metabolism. Modulating dZIP13 expression in the gut cell resulted in opposite iron changes in the cytosol and secretory organelles, and radioisotope iron transport assay further showed that dZIP13 mediates iron exporting, providing compelling evidence in supporting dZIP13 as an iron efflux pump. Future biochemistry/biophysical work is needed to decipher the exact mechanistic detail of the transportation process and evidences thus obtained may further substantiate the conclusion of dZIP13 as an iron exporter."

The subcellular distributions of ferritin are very different between mammals and insects. In mammals, ferritin is predominantly localized in the cytosol for storing cytosolic iron, and absorbed dietary iron is effluxed from enterocytes through ferroportin (<a href=\"#bib42\">Vanoaica et al., 2010</a>). However, in insects such as <i>Drosophila</i>, ferritin is mainly secreted, playing a central role in iron absorption by bringing iron out of enterocytes and into the hemolymph through the secretory pathway (<a href=\"#bib35\">Tang and Zhou, 2013b</a>). This feature of iron absorption demands higher levels of iron to be pumped into the secretory pathway for systemic use, and facilitated our characterization of dZIP13 as the iron pumper which fulfills this role."

It is possible that dZIP13 still retains some residual zinc-importing activity. However, in most cases, the zinc effect is physiologically marginal or insignificant. We would argue that the zinc dyshomeostasis is not the primary effect of dZIP13 function loss, because iron but not zinc levels were altered in the body of <i>dZIP13-RNAi</i> and <i>dZIP13-OE larvae</i>. In addition, iron but not zinc supplementation is able to rescue loss of dZIP13. Finally, no genetic interaction was observed between dZIP13 and other ZIPs in the ER/Golgi. These results argue against the idea that zinc dyshomeostasis is the primary defect in the loss of dZIP13 function, and that iron dyshomeostasis is secondary to a zinc defect. Our other characterizations of dZIP13, as reported in this work, are all consistent with this notion."

It would be interesting to know what sequences or structures endow dZIP13 with this unique property. At this stage we do not yet have clear answers to this question. Amino acid sequence comparisons of ZIP13 with other ZIP family members reveal some distinct differences. The most notabe difference is in transmembrane domain TM4. The TM4 amino acid sequence for all ZIP13s are DNFTHG (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>) whereas other closely related ZIPs are HNFTDG, i.e., the highly conserved region in TM4 has a D and H residue swap between ZIP13s and other ZIP members. Our preliminary evidences suggest this variation might be an important factor because when we switched this D and H dZIP13 was no longer functional. Additional experiments are clearly needed to further explore this promising lead."

Recently mutations in ZIP13, a member of the SLC39A/Zrt-Irt-like protein (ZIP) family, have been identified as the cause for the spondylocheiro dysplastic Ehlers\u2013Danlos syndrome (SCD-EDS), a form of EDS sharing some similar clinical presentations with EDS VI, which is caused by mutations in PLOD1 gene encoding lysyl hydroxylase (LH1) (<a href=\"#bib8\">Fukada et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Giunta et al., 2008</a>). Because ZIP transporters were generally believed to import zinc into the cytosol from the extracellular milieu or organellar lumen (<a href=\"#bib16\">Kambe et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Lichten and Cousins, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Jeong and Eide, 2013</a>), the pathogenesis of SCD-EDS was difficult to understand and various hypotheses were proposed to explain how the zinc importer could affect iron homeostasis (<a href=\"#bib8\">Fukada et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Giunta et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Jeong et al., 2012</a>). The identification of dZIP13 as the iron exporter for the secretory compartments suggests a more direct interpretation of SCD-EDS: ZIP13 mutations impair iron transport to ER/Golgi, significantly attenuating the activities of iron-requiring enzymes such as lysyl hydroxylase, leading to defective collagen synthesis and accumulation in the secretory pathway."

However, lysyl and prolyl hydroxylase activities from the cellular extracts of patient cells were reported to be normal (<a href=\"#bib9\">Giunta et al., 2008</a>). This is likely the result from the enzymatic assays, which were performed in the presence of iron (<a href=\"#bib26\">Murad et al., 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Giunta et al., 2008</a>). It has been shown that externally supplied iron is needed to do these assays (<a href=\"#bib39\">Tuderman et al., 1977</a>), suggesting iron is probably not tightly bound to these enzymes. However, the addition of iron would neutralize or mask the original iron-deficienct state of these enzymes in vivo (in the ER/Golgi of SCD-EDS patient cells), and therefore produce \u2018normal\u2019 in vitro enzymatic activities despite defective in vivo hydroxylation. These seemingly contradictory observations, therefore, are very consistent with our conclusion that ZIP13 is an iron exporter that supplies iron to ER/Golgi."

Because ZIP13 is normally an intracellular protein, the authors claimed that when overexpressed, some ZIP13 was mistargeted to the plasma membrane, making the uptake assay possible. In that experiment, zinc uptake was observed, but iron failed to compete with zinc in the importing assay. However, no exporting activity was examined in that experiment. As reported and discussed previously, sometimes we also observed slight changes in zinc levels, though we are not sure whether this was a result of direct dZIP13 transportation or due to secondary effects of iron dyshomeostasis. It is possible that dZIP13 may still retain some residual zinc importing activity. If this is the case, then the results from Jeong et al. would not be contradictory with our own findings."

According to this theory, zinc accumulation in ER/Golgi can compete with iron and then affect collagen hydroxylation. Indeed, zinc has been reported as an inhibitor of prolyl hydroxylase (<a href=\"#bib39\">Tuderman et al., 1977</a>). However in our hands, we saw only a marginal increase of zinc in the ER/Golgi when dZIP13 was knocked-down, but a much more dramatic change in the iron level. Because hZIP7, a zinc importer, cannot rescue dZIP13-RNAi, we think when dZIP13 is knocked-down the primary defect is not zinc accumulation. We suggest iron dyshomeostasis instead of a zinc defect is probably the primary cause contributing to SCD-EDS. Although we cannot exclude zinc's effect, it appears that it is not the primary reason, or at most a subsidiary factor."

Iron is involved in heme and Fe-S synthesis, and iron deficiency is typically observed as anemia. In SCD-EDS, it is possible that iron deficiency is localized to the secretory pathway and cytosolic and mitochondrial iron levels remain not much affected. Therefore, a ZIP13 mutation would result in a type of iron dyshomeostasis that would not present itself with the typical types of symptons (e.g., skin abnormality, bone malformation, and growth retardation) observed with classical iron deficiency. We still do not know what other proteins in the secretory pathway require iron. In addition to the common EDS-like features, SCD-EDS patients do present other phenotypes such as generalized skeletal dysplasia involving the spine and striking clinical abnormalities of the hands (<a href=\"#bib9\">Giunta et al., 2008</a>). Are these additional characteristics also a result of collagen defects or due to abnormalities other than the collagen? This question remains unanswered. Nevertheless, our results add another level of complexity in the regulation of iron homeostasis and some of the consequences that arise from its disruption."

Zip13 is of particular interest because mutations in humans are associated with a sub type of Ehlers-Danlos, a connective tissue disorder. They present strong and convincing evidence that Zip13 is primarily involved in the transport of iron rather than zinc. This is not without precedent as the ZIP family of transporters has been found to include both iron and zinc transporters in several species. The authors also present evidence that ZIP13 localizes to intracellular vesicles and directs iron efflux from the cytosol to the secretory pathway."

To further corroborate our statement that Zip13 knockdown in the gut indeed led to cytosolic iron increase and Zip13 overexpression cytosolic iron decrease, we examined how genes involved in iron homeostasis would behave in these cases (i.e., do they behave as in iron-rich or iron-poor condition?). Ferritin and iron uptaker Malvolio (fly NRAMP homologue) were chosen. Under iron-replete conditions gut ferritin is induced in both the transcript and protein level, while Malvolio is repressed, and vice versa. We then analyzed ZIP13-RNAi and ZIP13-OE flies. ZIP13-RNAi saw a dramatic increase of ferritin and a depression of Malvolio, exactly coinciding with what has happened under iron replete situation (Newly added data shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C, D</a>, and corresponding text added in the Results). So physiologically speaking, when dZIP13 is knocked-down, gut cells \u201cfeel\u201d an iron surplus state, and respond by dramatically increased ferritin expression and reduced expression of iron uptaker Malvolio. These are indirect lines of evidence, but constitute fairly strong indirect lines of evidence together with the aconitase assay in suggesting gut cytosolic iron is reduced when dZIP13 is overexpressed and increased when knockdown."

The reason that overall iron reduction is observed in dZIP13-RNAi gut is mostly likely that in fly, ferritin, to which most iron is bound, is in the secretory pathway (unlike mammalians most ferritin is in the cytosol). Indeed, ferric staining highly depends on the presence of ferritin. In other words, the lower total cellular iron in dZIP13-RNAi gut is likely because that gut cells are in a state of iron surplus in the cytosol and a feedback control of iron uptake is thus exerted leading to a reduction of total cellular iron level (cytosolic iron + secretory iron)."

Having said this, it is also noteworthy that zinc efflux protein ZnT5 (SLC30A5) can mediate zinc transport in both directions (<a href=\"#bib40\">Valentine et al., 2007</a>).

Future biochemistry/biophysical work is needed to decipher the exact mechanistic detail of the transportation process and evidence thus obtained may further substantiate the conclusion of dZIP13 as an iron effluxing protein.\u201d"
