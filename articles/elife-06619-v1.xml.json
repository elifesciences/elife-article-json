Measured cortical spike trains are often irregular in time, and spike counts vary over repeated presentations of identical sensory stimuli (<a href=\"#bib68\">Tolhurst et al., 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Shadlen and Newsome, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Maimon and Assad, 2009</a>). One view holds that this variability is irreducible and therefore represents noise (<a href=\"#bib63\">Shadlen and Newsome, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">London et al., 2010</a>). Noisy spike trains are difficult to reconcile with the integrative properties of single neurons (<a href=\"#bib65\">Softky and Koch, 1993</a>) and the high reliability of cortical neurons (<a href=\"#bib50\">Mainen and Sejnowski, 1995</a>) and synapses (<a href=\"#bib66\">Stevens and Zador, 1998</a>). This discrepancy has motivated models of cortical circuits that inherently produce noisy spike trains even with reliable neurons, by virtue of chaotic dynamics (<a href=\"#bib69\">van Vreeswijk and Sompolinsky, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Shadlen and Newsome, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Litwin-Kumar and Doiron, 2012</a>). Irregular spike trains suggest that spike rates, but not spike timing, are used by the brain for computation (<a href=\"#bib52\">Mazurek and Shadlen, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">London et al., 2010</a>)."

Measuring and accounting for these hidden states may reveal the detailed structure of spike trains to be deterministic and predictable. For example, minimizing fixational eye movements in alert monkeys reduces spike count variability in the visual cortex (<a href=\"#bib31\">Gur et al., 1997</a>). In the sensory periphery, spikes are often coupled to stimulus features with high temporal precision. This precision allows timing-based neural codes to be faster (<a href=\"#bib37\">Johansson and Birznieks, 2004</a>) and more efficient (<a href=\"#bib27\">Gollisch and Meister, 2008</a>) than rate-based codes."

These factors can be external to the brain, such as sensory stimuli (<a href=\"#bib6\">Baudot et al., 2013</a>), or internal to it, such as behavioral state (<a href=\"#bib53\">Mitchell et al., 2007</a>, <a href=\"#bib54\">2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Churchland et al., 2010</a>).

The Fano factor (FF) is a widely used measure of variability in spike trains (<a href=\"#bib8\">Berry et al., 1997</a>). FF is defined as the variance of the spike count divided by the mean spike count over some time window. For a Poisson process, FF = 1, independent of the window size. In our task, mice are free to explore the object differently in each trial. At a coarse scale, behavior and neural responses were irregular during object localization. FF computed by counting spikes over the entire sample epoch (stimulus presentation), was huge (FF = 7.51). Since each trial corresponds to different whisker movements and different patterns of touches this value of FF includes extrinsic variability due to behavior, in addition to intrinsic variability. Aligning spikes to the fine-scale structure of behavior revealed that spikes were mainly coupled to temporally irregular sensory input from object contact (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). Spike rate was sharply elevated shortly after touch onset (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). Each touch evoked on the order of one spike (1.51 spikes/first touch; 0.31/later touches) with short latency (onset, 8 ms) (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>; <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

Firing rates were low in both whisking (0.67 spikes/s) and non-whisking (0.23 spikes/s) periods. Yet during active exploration, the timing of spikes was coupled to the phase of rhythmic whisker movement (<a href=\"#bib25\">Fee et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Curtis and Kleinfeld, 2009</a>), with a modulation depth close to 1 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G,H</a>; <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). For the example neuron, using whisker behavior it is possible to predict time windows where a neuron will fire a single or small number of spikes, as well as time periods when the spike probability is zero (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G,H</a>; phase, 0), similar to spike trains measured in the salamander retina (<a href=\"#bib39\">Keat et al., 2001</a>).

We counted the fraction of spikes falling into a small time window after touch (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>). This proportion increases with expanding window size, resulting in an initially steep curve (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). At some window size, the curve levels off as the proportion of touch spikes increases no faster than expected for a random spike train at the neuron's mean spike rate. This transition point defines the proportion of touch-coupled spikes. For the neuron illustrated in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, 74.4% spikes fall into a time window spanning 8 to 40 ms after touch onset, comprising 15.3% of overall exploration time. This implies temporally sparse spiking (<a href=\"#bib8\">Berry et al., 1997</a>). Over the L4 C2 population, 70.6% \u00b1 20.9% (mean, s.d.) of spikes were coupled to touch in an average of 14.9% of exploration time. L4 neurons outside of C2 had significantly less touch-evoked spikes, 8.4% \u00b1 13.3% in 3.5% of exploration time (p = 6.53e-6, Wilcoxon rank sum).

Touch response magnitude was highly modulated by each of the three variables (mean modulation index: touch order, 0.71 \u00b1 0.25; velocity, 0.71 \u00b1 0.27; max curvature, 0.72 \u00b1 0.23; mean \u00b1 std; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013C</a>). Responsiveness to pretouch velocity and max curvature covaried strongly (pairwise correlation coefficient 0.80, p = 4.3e-8), whereas touch order response was somewhat less correlated with velocity and curvature (correlation coefficients 0.70, 0.65, p = 1.0e-5, p = 8.2e-5).

Spike rates were low except for several milliseconds after touch onset (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1, 2</a>). During object localization, the majority (&gt;70%) of spikes were temporally coupled to touch onset (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). Whisker movements organized the remaining spikes so that they aligned with particular phases of the whisk cycle. The time-scale of temporal modulation (approximately 10 ms) was much shorter than the mean inter-spike interval (approximately 1 s). Based on observations of whisker behavior it is possible to predict brief time windows when a neuron will fire a single or small number of spikes, as well as time periods when the spike probability is zero. Touch times could be reliably and precisely decoded by pooling activity from a handful of L4 neurons (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>) (<a href=\"#bib60\">Panzeri et al., 2014</a>). Spike count variance after touch (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>), measured using the FF, was close to the binomial limit, the theoretical minimum (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). Based on these criteria we conclude that L4 responses encode touch with millisecond timescale precision and minimal noise."

                        "text": "This picture of low noise, rapidly modulated responses differs from the conclusions based on recordings from the cortex of behaving non-human primates (<a href=\"#bib68\">Tolhurst et al., 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Shadlen and Newsome, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Maimon and Assad, 2009</a>). Even in cases with time-varying stimuli and corresponding cortical responses with rapid modulation, spike counts vary greatly across trials, resulting in large FFs (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bair and Koch, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Buracas et al., 1998</a>). Four experimental factors might contribute to the large spike rate modulation and small FFs observed in our experiments: First, mice solved a discrimination task using active sensation (<a href=\"#bib41\">Knutsen et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">O'Connor et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Kleinfeld and Deschenes, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">O'Connor et al., 2013</a>). In contrast to passive presentation of stimuli (<a href=\"#bib68\">Tolhurst et al., 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Shadlen and Newsome, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Maimon and Assad, 2009</a>), in our task mice control sensory input by palpating the object with their whiskers. It is likely that mice tune their movements to achieve high signal-to-noise ratio encoding of tactile information. Second, by employing loose-seal cell-attached recordings we targeted neurons independent of activity, permitting accurate sampling of the spike trains produced by the L4 neuron population (<a href=\"#bib21\">DeWeese et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">O'Connor et al., 2010</a>). These recording methods could be critical because standard extracellular recordings can have problems detecting neurons with low spike rate and high synchrony (<a href=\"#bib44\">Lewicki, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">DeWeese et al., 2003</a>). During highly synchronous events, such as the population volley after touch, the probability is high that simultaneously recorded units in an extracellular electrode will be missed or misassigned (<a href=\"#bib15\">Cotton et al., 2013</a>). Close to the binomial limit relatively few misassigned spikes can have a large impact on calculations of the FF (<a href=\"#bib21\">DeWeese et al., 2003</a>). Third, compared to measurements from other cortical layers and regions, L4 spike trains in barrel cortex are more easily interpreted because extrinsic input arises mainly from the sensory periphery, rather than other cortical layers or higher cortical areas that might provide input with unobserved dynamics (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>)."

Only after aligning spikes to the fine-scale structure of the sensory input does the meaning of individual spikes become clear (<a href=\"#bib8\">Berry et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Baudot et al., 2013</a>)."

The irregularity of the L5 spike trains, as well as spike trains in other cell types and brain areas, may reveal themselves as deterministic fine-scale structure once the multitude of their inputs can be simultaneously monitored (<a href=\"#bib28\">Gomez et al., 2013</a>)."

However, because a large number of inputs converge on single cortical neurons, noisy discharges are difficult to achieve in most models of neural networks (<a href=\"#bib65\">Softky and Koch, 1993</a>). One exception is balanced networks, which have gained prominence in part because they produce irregular discharges as a result of chaotic dynamics (<a href=\"#bib69\">van Vreeswijk and Sompolinsky, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Litwin-Kumar and Doiron, 2012</a>). L4 neurons have variability close to the theoretical minimum. This implies that models of cortical networks should not explicitly aim to produce intrinsically noisy activity."

Several key differences between this study and ours could underlie this discrepancy. During anesthesia cortical activity is modulated by slow rhythms (e.g., up and down states), which are not observed during active behavior (<a href=\"#bib16\">Crochet and Petersen, 2006</a>). These rhythms are expected to increase spike count variability. In addition, the movements underlying active sensation might recruit circuit mechanisms that reduce variability. In our experiments mice \u2018choose\u2019 temporally sharp touches, which are expected to drive strong and rapid feedforward inhibition within L4 (<a href=\"#bib26\">Gabernet et al., 2005</a>). The inhibition shortens L4 responses after touch and thus might produce effectively binary (0 or 1 spike) responses and low variability (<a href=\"#bib21\">DeWeese et al., 2003</a>). Attentional mechanisms are also known to reduce neuronal variability (<a href=\"#bib53\">Mitchell et al., 2007</a>, <a href=\"#bib54\">2009</a>) and may contribute to the low FFs we report here."

We show that touch onset is reliably decodable from a small number of L4 neurons. In contrast, although many L4 cells are modulated by whisking phase, their low spike rates during whisker movements (mean &lt;0.15 spikes/whisk cycle) hinders efficient decoding of whisking phase from population activity (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). The poor encoding of whisking phase is consistent with the observation that mice do not use the timing of L4 activity relative to whisking phase to measure object location, at least in the context of the simple task used in our experiments (<a href=\"#bib58\">O'Connor et al., 2013</a>). How the brain uses temporally precise and low variance coding of touch in L4 neurons for tactile sensation remains to be discovered."

The manipulator depth was zeroed upon pipette tip contact with the dura (<a href=\"#bib57\">O'Connor et al., 2010</a>). After contact, the craniotomy was covered by cortex buffer or 2% agar in cortex buffer. Aided by positive pressure (1 PSI), the pipette was advanced through the dura. When searching for cells, the pipette pressure was reduced to 0.1\u20130.3 PSI. Two pipette shapes were used, with a thicker shank (3.5\u20135 M\u03a9) (<a href=\"#bib57\">O'Connor et al., 2010</a>) or a thinner shank (6\u20139 M\u03a9). Cells were recorded blindly (<a href=\"#bib21\">DeWeese et al., 2003</a>). Recordings using thick shank pipettes caused cortical dimpling of \u223c100 \u00b5m (<a href=\"#bib57\">O'Connor et al., 2010</a>). Cells recorded with thick shanks and raw manipulator depths of 505\u2013665 \u00b5m (405\u2013565 \u00b5m corrected; 11 cells) were considered L4 and depths of 727\u2013944 \u00b5m (627\u2013844 \u00b5m corrected; 11 cells) were considered L5. Cells recorded with thin shank pipettes with raw manipulator depths of 444\u2013560 \u00b5m (uncorrected; 30 cells) were considered L4 (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplements 1, 2</a>). This depth range was consistently in L4 based on juxtacellular cell fills (unpublished observations). Data acquisition was controlled by <i>Ephus</i> (<a href=\"#bib67\">Suter et al., 2010</a>). The sampling rate was 10 kHz."

Touch responses in L4 neurons are modulated by adaptation, pretouch velocity and curvature of the whisker (which is proportional to touch force) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). To reduce adaptation effects we selected touch epochs in which the inter contact interval (ICI) was longer than 250 ms. We divided the remaining touch events into five groups (<i>N</i>, number of points per group; minimum, 20), clustered by touch characteristics. We z-scored pretouch velocity and the maximum curvature change shortly after touch (0\u201320 ms). For each neuron we clustered the touch events using a density-based clustering method (OPTICS; [<a href=\"#bib17\">Cunningham and Yu, 2014</a>]). The output of OPTICS gives an ordered list <math id=\"inf19\"><mrow><msub><mi>l</mi><mi>i</mi></msub></mrow></math> of points sorted by similarity.

We calculated the FF by counting spikes in sliding windows of 10 ms for each cell and each of the five bins (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). Confidence intervals for the FFs were obtained by resampling 1000 times.

The paper reports on the variability of spike trains in layer 4 (L4) neurons in mouse somatosensory cortex during a touch task (pole localization) involving active whisking. It makes a convincing argument that variability is very low, once spikes are aligned properly based on time of touch and on whisk phase. Specifically, touch (more than whisking phase) seems to be the primary feature encoded by the timing of the spikes. Indeed, most spikes can be explained by whisker curvature and related kinematics, together with (to a smaller degree) whisking itself. Around the time of the touch the noise in these neurons is near the theoretical minimum. Thus what might appear as trial-to-trial variability or noise is not. Spiking appears to be noisy only if the observer does not or cannot take into account the true determinants of spiking."

The Introduction begins with \u201cCortical spike trains are often considered to be noisy\u201d, and casts much of the paper in the context of this view. But after decades of work, this idea of cortical neurons being \u201cnoisy\u201d has become a strawman. It is out of step with crucial pieces of the literature. We already know that cortical neurons are not intrinsically noisy; see e.g. Mainen and Sejnowski, \u201cReliability of spike timing in neocortical neurons\u201d. Science 1995, and Deweese and Zador, \u201cShared and private variability in the auditory cortex\u201d. J Neurophysiol 2000. Also, the apparent Poisson nature of variability can be explained by a deterministic spike threshold (Carandini, Plos Biol 2000). Similarly, the statement that \u201cIn cortex, irregular spike trains suggest that only rate codes can be used to perform reliable computations\u201d is misleading, and based on a reference that is over 10 years old."

And these results are not limited to anesthetized preparations: similar results have been obtained in awake monkeys, where (as one could have imagined, and similarly to what is done here for whiskers) it is essential to know eye position on a moment by moment basis: Gur, Beylin, and Snodderly, \u201cResponse variability of neurons in primary visual cortex (V1) of alert monkeys\u201d (J Neurosci, 1997)."

If we now turn to the recent literature on somatosensory cortex, we see that it makes precisely the opposite case relative to neurons being \u201cnoisy\u201d. Indeed, the paper might just as well have begun with: \u201cCortical spike trains are often considered to be made up of precisely timed spikes, whereby the timing of each spike carries some meaning about the stimulus.\u201d See for example Arabzadeh, Zorzin and Diamond \u201cNeuronal encoding of texture in the whisker sensory pathway\u201d (PLoS Biol 2005) and \u201cDeciphering the spike train of a sensory neuron: counts and temporal patterns in the rat whisker pathway\u201d (J Neurosci 2006). Additional contributions that should be considered in rethinking how to cast these results include those from G. Stanley (admittedly anesthetized, as noted in this study), E. Arabzadeh, G. Foffani, R. Petersen, and S. Panzeri. The latter include \u201cInformation carried by population spike times in the whisker sensory cortex can be decoded without knowledge of stimulus time\u201d (Frontiers, 2010) \u2013 which is related to the authors' conclusion that \u201cPooling activity from only fifteen L4 neurons [\u2026] in C2 was sufficient to detect 95 % of touches\u201d \u2013 and \u201cComplementary Contributions of Spike Timing and Spike Rate to Perceptual Decisions in Rat S1 and S2 Cortex\u201d (Current Biology, 2015).

We already know that the Poisson model is not a reasonable model, even with refractory periods. We know this in retina, in LGN, in V1, and in A1. It would be more interesting to test a more plausible model. For instance, would an integrate-and-fire model with Gaussian noise in Vm give the observed statistics?"

Fano Factor is at best awkward for non-stationary processes and the main message of the paper is that spiking is non-stationary, e.g. extremely variable over large time scales and extremely precise when whiskers kinematics dictate so. For a Poisson process, FF = 1, independent of the window size. Since the observed FF for full stimulus window was large, evidently a Poisson process is not underlying spikes. At best it is a Poisson process driven by a variable mean rate. Indeed, Poisson statistics are meant to model stationary processes, that is, processes where the probability of an event per unit time is constant. Obviously firing probability increases in the tens of ms after touch, compared to the rest of the trial."

In the present analysis (in the second paragraph of the subsection \u201cLow spike count variability\u201d), 3 factors are used to account, one at a time, for spike trains: order of touch, whisker velocity, and whisker curvature. Why use them one at a time? Why not use all 3 at once and see how much better one does? Or use only the two main ones? Are there any spikes unaccounted for once one does this? This could be done with a GLM (perhaps enlisting the help of colleague Jeremy Freeman) or with similar approaches. Indeed, since the main message of the paper is that spike trains can be explained by whisker curvature and related kinematics, it would make sense to place less emphasis on the Poisson analysis and more emphasis on showing whisker state as a determining factor."

It's great to show L4 does one thing, but more interesting to show that it does something different than other layers.

Our analysis says that the low variability we report is not due to very high spike rate changes followed by a refractory period (which was the first possible explanation we considered)."

Fano Factor is at best awkward for non-stationary processes and the main message of the paper is that spiking is non-stationary, e.g. extremely variable over large time scales and extremely precise when whiskers kinematics dictate so. For a Poisson process, FF = 1, independent of the window size. Since the observed FF for full stimulus window was large, evidently a Poisson process is not underlying spikes. At best it is a Poisson process driven by a variable mean rate. Indeed, Poisson statistics are meant to model stationary processes, that is, processes where the probability of an event per unit time is constant. Obviously firing probability increases in the tens of ms after touch, compared to the rest of the trial</i>."

First, a time-varying firing rate that is the same in every trial, referred to as an inhomogenous Poisson process. The Fano factor is often used to characterize non-stationary processes, precisely because FF = 1 even for an inhomogeneous Poisson process (e.g. Berry and Meister, 1997). Second, the other type of non-stationarity corresponds to changes in mean firing rate across trials. In this case, for a neuron that fires with Poisson statistics according to a stochastic rate in each trial, the Fano factor will be larger than 1 (i.e. it is a doubly stochastic process)."

In the present analysis (in the second paragraph of the subsection \u201cLow spike count variability\u201d), 3 factors are used to account, one at a time, for spike trains: order of touch, whisker velocity, and whisker curvature. Why use them one at a time? Why not use all 3 at once and see how much better one does? Or use only the two main ones? Are there any spikes unaccounted for once one does this? This could be done with a GLM (perhaps enlisting the help of colleague Jeremy Freeman) or with similar approaches. Indeed, since the main message of the paper is that spike trains can be explained by whisker curvature and related kinematics, it would make sense to place less emphasis on the Poisson analysis and more emphasis on showing whisker state as a determining factor</i>."
