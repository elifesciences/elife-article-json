We used deep mutational scanning to examine the extent to which a high inherent mutational tolerance contributes to this antigenic evolvability. We created mutant viruses that incorporate most of the \u224810<sup>4</sup> amino-acid mutations to hemagglutinin from A/WSN/1933 (H1N1) influenza. After passaging these viruses in tissue culture to select for functional variants, we used deep sequencing to quantify mutation frequencies before and after selection. These data enable us to infer the preference for each amino acid at each site in hemagglutinin. These inferences are consistent with existing knowledge about the protein's structure and function, and can be used to create a model that describes hemagglutinin's evolution far better than existing phylogenetic models. We show that hemagglutinin has a high inherent tolerance for mutations at antigenic sites, suggesting that this is one factor contributing to influenza's antigenic evolution."

We used deep mutational scanning to examine the extent to which a high inherent mutational tolerance contributes to this antigenic evolvability. We created mutant viruses that incorporate most of the \u224810<sup>4</sup> amino-acid mutations to hemagglutinin from A/WSN/1933 (H1N1) influenza. After passaging these viruses in tissue culture to select for functional variants, we used deep sequencing to quantify mutation frequencies before and after selection. These data enable us to infer the preference for each amino acid at each site in hemagglutinin. These inferences are consistent with existing knowledge about the protein's structure and function, and can be used to create a model that describes hemagglutinin's evolution far better than existing phylogenetic models. We show that hemagglutinin has a high inherent tolerance for mutations at antigenic sites, suggesting that this is one factor contributing to influenza's antigenic evolution."

The most potent form of anti-influenza immunity is antibodies targeting the virus\u2019s hemagglutinin (HA) protein (<a href=\"#bib60\">Yewdell et al., 1979</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Wiley et al., 1981</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Caton et al., 1982</a>). The virus evades these antibodies primarily by accumulating amino-acid substitutions in HA's antigenic sites (<a href=\"#bib50\">Smith et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Das et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Koel et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Bedford et al., 2014</a>). Remarkably, HA undergoes this rapid evolution while retaining the ability to fold to a highly conserved structure that performs two functions essential for viral replication: receptor binding and membrane fusion (<a href=\"#bib57\">Wiley and Skehel, 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Russell et al., 2004</a>). HA is therefore highly \u2018antigenically evolvable\u2019 in the sense that it can accommodate rapid antigenic change without compromising its structural and functional properties."

However, it is unclear whether these factors are sufficient to fully explain HA's antigenic evolution. For instance, while some other error-prone viruses (such as HIV and hepatitis C) also exhibit rapid antigenic evolution of their surface proteins (<a href=\"#bib10\">Burton et al., 2012</a>), other viruses with comparable mutation rates (such as measles) show little propensity for antigenic change (<a href=\"#bib49\">Sheshberadaran et al., 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Duffy et al., 2008</a>), despite the fact that evasion of immunity would presumably confer a selective benefit. A variety of explanations ranging in scale from ecological to molecular can be posited to account for these differences in rates of antigenic evolution (<a href=\"#bib34\">Lipsitch and O\u2019Hagan, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Koelle et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Heaton et al., 2013</a>). One hypothesis is that HA has a high inherent tolerance for mutations in its antigenic sites, thereby conferring on influenza the evolutionary capacity to escape from anti-HA antibodies with relative ease."

This cannot be done simply by examining variability among naturally occurring viruses, since the evolution of influenza in nature is shaped by a combination of inherent mutational tolerance and external immune selection. For example, the rapid evolution of HA's antigenic sites in nature could reflect the fact that these sites are especially tolerant of mutations, or it could be purely a consequence of strong immune selection. Traditional experimental approaches using site-directed mutagenesis or serial viral passage are also inadequate to quantify inherent mutational tolerance\u2014while such experimental techniques have been used to determine the effect of specific mutations on HA, they cannot feasibly be applied to all possible individual amino-acid mutations. Recently <a href=\"#bib27\">Heaton et al. (2013)</a> used transposon mutagenesis to show that HA is tolerant to the random insertion of five to six amino-acid sequences at several locations in the protein. However, the relevance of this tolerance to insertional mutations is unclear, since HA's actual antigenic evolution involves almost entirely point substitutions, with only a very low rate of insertions and deletions."

Specifically, we create mutant libraries of the HA gene from the H1N1 strain A/WSN/1933 (WSN) that contain virtually all of the \u22484 \u00d7 10<sup>4</sup> possible individual codon mutations, and therefore virtually all of the \u224810<sup>4</sup> possible amino-acid mutations. We use these mutant libraries to generate pools of mutant influenza viruses, which we estimate incorporate at least 85% of the possible HA codon mutations and 97% of the possible amino-acid mutations. We then passage these viruses to select for functional variants, and use Illumina deep sequencing to determine the frequency of each HA mutation before and after this selection for viral growth. Since these experiments measure the impact of mutations in the absence of immune selection, they enable us to quantify HA's inherent preference for each amino acid at each site in the protein. We show that these quantitative measurements are consistent with existing knowledge about HA structure and function, and can be used to create an evolutionary model that describes HA's natural evolution far better than existing models of sequence evolution. Finally, we use our results to show that HA's antigenic sites are disproportionately tolerant of mutations, suggesting that a high inherent tolerance for mutations at key positions targeted by the immune system is one factor that contributes to influenza's antigenic evolvability."

While there is a low but non-zero rate of errors (from sequencing, PCR, or reverse-transcription) that lead to single-nucleotide codon changes (as judged by the <b>DNA</b> and <b>virus</b> samples), errors that lead to multi-nucleotide codon changes are negligible because it is extremely rare for a single codon to experience two errors. We similarly expect that any <i>do novo</i> mutations or reversions that arise during viral growth should be limited to single-nucleotide changes given the short duration of viral passage in our experiments. The fact that our mutant libraries were constructed at the codon rather than the nucleotide level means that the vast majority (54 of 63) possible mutations to each codon involve multiple nucleotide changes, and so the sequencing results for these mutations can be analyzed essentially at face value, without having to worry about confounding errors. For the remaining (9 of 63) possible mutations that only involve a single-nucleotide codon change, we have attempted to statistically correct for the error rates estimated from our controls as described in the \u2018Materials and methods\u2019."

These preferences are the expected frequency of each amino acid at each site in the mutant viruses in a hypothetical situation in which all amino acids are introduced at that site at equal frequency in the initial plasmid mutant library (<a href=\"#bib9\">Bloom, 2014</a>). Because many of the HAs in our libraries contain several mutations, these preferences do not simply correspond to the fitness effect of each individual mutation to the WSN HA\u2014rather, they represent the average effect of each mutation in a collection of closely related HA mutants. Mutations to amino acids with high preferences are favored by selection, while mutations to amino acids with low preferences are disfavored. The amino-acid preferences are inferred from the deep sequencing data using a Bayesian statistical framework in which the observed counts are treated as draws from multinomial distributions with unknown parameters representing the initial mutagenesis rate, the various error rates, and selection as represented by the preferences (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 for details)."

We sought to quantify two factors: <i>technical</i> variation due to inaccuracies and statistical limitations during Illumina sample preparation and deep sequencing, and <i>biological</i> variation due to stochasticity in the viral mutants that were generated and enriched during each replicate of the experiment. <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a> shows the correlation between biological replicate #1 and a technical repeat of the Illumina sample preparation and deep sequencing for this biological replicate. There is a very high correlation between the preferences inferred from these two repeats, indicating that technical variation has only a very minor influence on the final inferred amino-acid preferences. <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B\u2013D</a> show the correlation among the three different biological replicates. Although the biological replicates are substantially correlated, there is also clear variation. Most of this variation is attributable to amino acids which in one replicate are inferred to have preferences near the a priori expectation of 0.05 (there are 20 amino acids, which in the absence of data are all initially assumed to have an equal preference of <math id=\"inf1\"><mrow><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mrow><mn>20</mn></mrow></mfrac></mrow></math>), but in another replicate are inferred to have a much higher or lower preference. Such variation arises because the mutant viruses for each biological replicate only sample about 50% of the possible codon mutations (see previous section), meaning that there is little data for some mutations in any given replicate. Fortunately, combining the three biological replicates greatly increases the coverage of possible mutations (see previous section). Therefore, inferences made from the combined data (as in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>) should be substantially more accurate than inferences from any of the individual replicates. This idea is supported by the results below, which quantify the extent to which the inferred preferences accurately describe natural HA evolution."

So one can imagine both biologically interesting and uninteresting explanations for the imperfect correlation between the results of the two studies. The interesting explanation is that differences in experimental methodology could lead to different selection pressures on specific mutations: for instance, <a href=\"#bib58\">Wu et al. (2014)</a> use A549 cells while we use MDCK-SIAT1 cells, and perhaps the impact of certain mutations is dependent on the cell line. The uninteresting explanation is that the imperfect correlation is simply due to noise in the experimental measurements. Unfortunately, it is not straightforward to distinguish between these two explanations. This difficulty in pinpointing reasons for inter-study variation highlights a limitation of the high-throughput experimental methodology employed by ourselves and <a href=\"#bib58\">Wu et al. (2014)</a>: while such experiments provide a wealth of data, numerous factors can create noise in these data (sequencing errors, population bottlenecks, epistasis among mutations, <i>etc</i>). Realizing the full potential of such studies will therefore require extensive experimental controls and biological replicates to quantify errors and noise to enable comparisons across data sets."

In contrast, the evolution of HA in nature is shaped by a combination of HA's inherent mutational tolerance and external selection pressures. Specifically, the evolution of HA in humans is strongly driven by selection for mutations that alter antigenicity (<a href=\"#bib60\">Yewdell et al., 1979</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Wiley et al., 1981</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Caton et al., 1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Smith et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Das et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Koel et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Bedford et al., 2014</a>). The fact that such antigenic mutations fix at high frequency implies some degree of mutational tolerance at antigenic sites, since no mutations would fix if these sites were under absolute structural or functional constraint. However, it is not possible to tell from natural sequences alone whether antigenic sites are unusually mutationally tolerant compared to the rest of HA, or whether their rapid evolution is solely because they are under strong external immune selection."

(1982)</a> mapped the antigenic sites of the H1 HA from A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (PR8), which is closely related to the WSN HA used in our experiments. We therefore defined the \u2018Caton et al. antigenic sites\u2019 as the WSN residues homologous to those mapped by <a href=\"#bib12\">Caton et al. (1982)</a> with the exclusion of a single site that has gained glycosylation in the WSN HA relative to the PR8 HA (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 for details). One possible concern is that <a href=\"#bib12\">Caton et al. (1982)</a> mapped antigenic sites largely by selecting monoclonal-antibody escape mutants, and so these sites might be biased towards being more mutationally tolerant. We therefore also made a broader classification of \u2018antigenic sites and contacting residues\u2019 consisting of the Caton et al. antigenic sites <i>plus</i> all surface-exposed residues in contact with these sites (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 for details). This broader classification includes all residues in regions of the HA surface targeted by antibodies, and so should not be biased by whether sites are amenable to the selection of monoclonal-antibody escape mutants.

To correct for this fact, we computed the relative solvent accessibility (RSA) for all residues in the HA crystal structure. Residues with RSAs close to zero are buried and are expected to be fairly intolerant of mutations, whereas residues with RSAs substantially greater than zero are surface exposed and are expected to be fairly tolerant of mutations. <a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a> plots site entropy as a function of RSA for HA1 residues. This figure shows that sites with higher RSA are more mutationally tolerant as expected. However, the figure also suggests that both classifications of antigenic sites are more mutationally tolerant than other residues with equivalent RSA. The figure also suggest that the conserved receptor-binding residues are less mutationally tolerant than other residues with equivalent RSA, whereas the set of all receptor-binding residues have fairly typical mutational tolerance. These observations are supported by the statistical analyses in <a href=\"#tbl4\">Table 4</a>: even after correcting for RSA, there is a significant trend for antigenic sites to have high mutational tolerance, and for conserved receptor-binding residues to have low mutational tolerance."

The information obtained from the deep mutational scanning is consistent with existing knowledge about the effects of mutations on HA function and structure. For instance, the deep mutational scanning shows strong selection for specific amino acids known to play important roles in HA's receptor-binding activity, fusion activity, and proteolytic activation (<a href=\"#bib38\">Martin et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Qiao et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Stech et al., 2005</a>). Similarly, at the sites of known temperature-sensitive mutations to HA (<a href=\"#bib39\">Nakajima et al., 1986</a>), the deep mutational scanning identifies the more stabilizing amino-acid as more favorable. Broader trends from the deep mutational scanning are also in agreement with current thinking about mutational effects. For example, the deep mutational scanning finds that there is strong purifying selection against stop-codon mutations and many nonsynonymous mutations, but that there is only weak selection against synonymous mutations. All of these results suggest that the deep mutational scanning faithfully captures both the specific and general effects of mutations on HA."

We anticipate that separating HA's inherent mutational tolerance from external selection should also eventually allow the external selection pressures to be studied in greater detail. For example, one might imagine that sites in HA that exhibit evolutionary patterns that deviate from the quantitative model created from our deep mutational scanning are likely to be under external selection. Future work that augments deep mutational scanning with specific experimentally defined selection pressures (such as antibodies against HA) could aid in further elucidation of the forces that shape influenza evolution. It also may be possible to utilize high-throughput experimental data on mutational effects to better estimate the fitness of naturally occurring strains in a way that aids in prediction of the year-to-year strain dynamics of influenza (<a href=\"#bib35\">\u0141uksza and L\u00e4ssig, 2014</a>)."

It remains a mystery why error-prone RNA viruses differ so widely in their capacity for evolutionary escape from immunity, with some (e.g., influenza and HIV) undergoing rapid antigenic evolution while others (e.g., measles) show little antigenic change on relevant timescales (<a href=\"#bib34\">Lipsitch and O\u2019Hagan, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Koelle et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Heaton et al., 2013</a>). Our data demonstrate that the antigenic sites in HA are unusually tolerant to mutations, implying that inherent evolutionary plasticity at sites targeted by the immune system is one factor that contributes to influenza's rapid antigenic evolution. This high mutational tolerance at antigenic sites could itself be a property that influenza has evolved to aid in its antigenic escape\u2014or it might simply be an unfortunate coincidence that the immune system focuses on especially plastic portions of HA. In either case, it is intriguing to speculate whether a high inherent mutational tolerance in antigenic sites is also a feature of other antigenically variable RNA viruses. Application of the deep mutational scanning approach used here to additional viruses should provide a means to address this question."

The authors already address many of these.

Both find that viable paths occur disproportionately at antigenic sites.

(b) During transfection, one would expect that there may be viruses produced from cells expressing two different HA genes. How would such chimeric viruses confound the results in a single passage experiment? (c) Similarly to #2, wouldn't there also be viruses in which the HA on the surface has a given amino acid sequence, while the packaged genomic segments code for a different one? Multiple passages would ferret these out. (d) How were HA molecules sheared and why are there biases in sequence fragmentation? (e) Are more exposed HA residues generally more tolerant to mutations?

The interesting explanation is that differences in experimental methodology could lead to different selection pressures on specific mutations: for instance, <a href=\"#bib58\">Wu et al.

The uninteresting explanation is that the imperfect correlation is simply due to noise in the experimental measurements. Unfortunately, it is not straightforward to distinguish between these two explanations. This difficulty in pinpointing reasons for inter-study variation highlights a limitation of the high-throughput experimental methodology employed by ourselves and <a href=\"#bib58\">Wu et al.

We agree that this is a potential concern \u2013 however, the problem should be fixed during the low multiplicity of infection (MOI) passaging of the virus. In the current manuscript, we only perform one such passage \u2013 so the reviewers ask if it might not be desirable to also perform multiple passages to make sure the genotype-phenotype link is strong. This is a great suggestion, but in fact, in our previous work with NP (<a href=\"#bib9\">Bloom, 2014</a>) we did just that. Specifically, in that work, we sequenced NP after both one and two passages, and found that the results after just one passage were essentially indistinguishable from the results after two passages (see the fifth figure of <a href=\"http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2014/06/12/molbev.msu173\">http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2014/06/12/molbev.msu173</a>). One reason that a single low-MOI passage is su?cient may be that there is probably substantial selection that also occurs during viral rescue in co-cultures prior to the first low-MOI passage. In any case, based on our previous NP work, we judge that one low-MOI passage is sufficient to ensure a strong genotype-phenotype link for influenza genes, and so for this reason we only performed one low-MOI passage in the current work (there are good reasons for wanting to keep the number of passages as low as possible, primarily to avoid problems like the reversion one mentioned in the reviewers\u2019 previous comment)."
