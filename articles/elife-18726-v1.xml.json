We examined neuroendocrine, PVN CRH neurons and report that social isolation alters the intrinsic properties of these cells in sexually dimorphic fashion. Specifically, isolating preadolescent female mice from littermates for &lt;24 hr increased first spike latency (FSL) and decreased excitability of CRH neurons. These changes were not evident in age-matched males. By contrast, subjecting either males (isolated or grouped) or group housed females to acute physical stress (swim), increased FSL. The increase in FSL following either social isolation or acute physical stress was blocked by the glucocorticoid synthesis inhibitor, metyrapone and mimicked by exogenous corticosterone. The increase in FSL results in a decrease in the excitability of CRH neurons. Our observations demonstrate that social isolation, but not acute physical stress has sex-specific effects on PVN CRH neurons."

We examined neuroendocrine, PVN CRH neurons and report that social isolation alters the intrinsic properties of these cells in sexually dimorphic fashion. Specifically, isolating preadolescent female mice from littermates for &lt;24 hr increased first spike latency (FSL) and decreased excitability of CRH neurons. These changes were not evident in age-matched males. By contrast, subjecting either males (isolated or grouped) or group housed females to acute physical stress (swim), increased FSL. The increase in FSL following either social isolation or acute physical stress was blocked by the glucocorticoid synthesis inhibitor, metyrapone and mimicked by exogenous corticosterone. The increase in FSL results in a decrease in the excitability of CRH neurons. Our observations demonstrate that social isolation, but not acute physical stress has sex-specific effects on PVN CRH neurons."

Recent research suggests that young girls are more sensitive to social stress than boys. This could mean that social networks are more important for females in general, and that young females from different species, such as mice, may be more sensitive to social isolation than males. However, few studies have examined how social isolation affects the brain cells that control the release of stress hormones.As such, it remains unknown whether isolating individuals from their social group impacts on the brain in sex-specific ways."

Less than a day after separation from their littermates, the activity in the brain cells of female mice became markedly different from that of isolated males. In contrast to social isolation, the physical stress of being made to swim produced similar changes in the brains of both male and female mice. Further experiments then showed that the changes in the brain cells that control the release of stress hormones required a signalling chemical called corticosterone, which is produced in response to stressful situations. This suggests that, in repsonse to soical isolation, the females are experiencing more stress than the males."

The endocrine changes rely on the immediate engagement of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis which is controlled by corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN). Although it is essential for survival, the dysregulation of the stress response is implicated in the emergence of numerous neuropsychiatric diseases\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib29\">Tost et al., 2015</a>). Interestingly, many of these psychopathologies show sex-specific differences which may be a consequence of sexual dimorphism of the neuroendocrine response to stress\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib3\">Bale and Epperson, 2015</a>). This sexual dimorphism may result in different response sensitivity to the same stressor and/or differences in which stimuli males and females perceive as stressful. Human studies demonstrating that young girls exhibit greater corticosteroid\u00a0(CORT) stress reactivity to social stress tests than boys\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib10\">Gunnar et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">de Veld et al., 2012</a>) suggest, for example, that young females are more responsive to changes in social situations. Consistent with this idea, are demonstrations that, in comparison to males, females take greater advantage of social support and group dynamics to manage stress\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib28\">Taylor et al., 2000</a>). Here we hypothesized that disrupting the social network would elicit neurobiological changes preferentially in female mice."

Mice were either in same-sex groups, pairs, or isolated from littermates for sixteen to eighteen hours. We then prepared hypothalamic brain slices and examined synaptic and intrinsic properties of identified CRH neurons in the PVN in acute brain slices\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib31\">Wamsteeker Cusulin et al., 2013b</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1a</a>).

If true, we reasoned that subjecting single-housed male mice to an acute swim stress should also increase FSL. In females, however, the prior isolation should occlude the effects of an acute stress. To test this idea, single -housed male and female mice were subjected to swim stress for 20 min and intrinsic properties of CRH neurons were assessed (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a</a>). Following swim stress, FSL in male mice (male<sub>swim</sub>) was 64.0 \u00b1 4.6 ms, n\u00a0= 37, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2b,c</a>; this is significantly longer than FSL in the single males reported above (male<sub>swim</sub> vs male<sub>single</sub>, 1 way ANOVA, p=0.0004). FSL in single female mice subjected to swim stress was 65.8 \u00b1 4.9 ms, n\u00a0= 32, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2b,c</a>; this is not different from FSL in female mice subjected to social isolation (female<sub>swim</sub> vs female<sub>single</sub>, p=0.67). Finally, FSL in single males subjected to swim was not different from FSL in single females subjected to swim (p=0.9, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2b,c</a>). This suggests that either increases in FSL following social isolation occlude further effects of stress on CRH neurons or that females do not respond to swim stress. To test the effects of swim stress independent of any potential effects of social isolation, we conducted experiments in which group-housed females and males were subjected to swim stress. Following swim, FSL in group-housed males (male<sub>group swim</sub>: 58.8 \u00b1 2.8 ms, n\u00a0=\u00a023, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2d</a>) was significantly longer than FSL in na\u00efve, group -housed males (p&lt;0.001).

Similarly, CRH neurons in group-housed females subjected to swim had a significantly longer FSL than CRH neurons in naive, group-housed females (p=0.0001). These observations demonstrate that both females and males show equivalent sensitivity to an acute physical stress (i.e. forced swim). Additionally, a prior social isolation occludes the effects of subsequent physical stress on FSL in females, but has no effect on FSL in males."

In order to assess CORT during a defined temporal window, we subjected single male mice to swim stress and obtained samples thirty minutes after the protocol. We noted a positive correlation between plasma CORT and FSL (r<sup>2\u00a0</sup>=\u00a00.3, p=0.024, n\u00a0=\u00a017, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a</a>). CORT, however, is one of many signaling molecules that is altered in response to stress. To determine whether CORT is necessary for increases in FSL following social isolation, we conducted experiments in which female mice were given access to drinking water containing the CORT-synthesis inhibitor, metyrapone prior to, and during, isolation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b</a>). Metyrapone treatment blocked the effects of social isolation on FSL in female mice (female<sub>single metyrapone</sub> = 47.2 \u00b1 2.0 ms, n\u00a0= 24, p=0.001 vs female<sub>single</sub>, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3c</a>). Next, to determine whether CORT is necessary for increases in FSL following swim stress, we administered metyrapone prior to swim stress in single males (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3d</a>). This eliminated the stress-induced increase in FSL in males (male<sub>metyrapone</sub> = 50.2 \u00b1 2.4 ms, n\u00a0=\u00a035, vs male<sub>vehicle</sub> = 66.7 \u00b1 2.4, n\u00a0=\u00a023, p=0.007, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3e</a>). These observations demonstrate that CORT is necessary for stress-induced changes in FSL in both males and females. In order to determine whether CORT is sufficient for increasing FSL, we incubated slices from either single-housed males or group-housed females with 100 nM CORT for 1\u2009hr prior to electrophysiological assessment. This incubation time is sufficient to mimic CORT-dependent changes in synaptic metaplasticity observed after acute stress\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib30\">Wamsteeker Cusulin et al., 2013a</a>). CORT-incubation increased FSL in slices from single-housed males (59.2 \u00b1 4.1 ms, n\u00a0=\u00a036, p&lt;0.021 vs male<sub>single</sub>) and in slices from group-housed females (64.1 \u00b1 4.8 ms, n\u00a0=\u00a032, p&lt;0.0001 vs female<sub>group</sub>, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3f</a>). Collectively, these observations demonstrate that CORT is both necessary (during stress) and sufficient (in the absence of stress) to increase FSL in male and female mice."

A rapidly activating, rapidly inactivating potassium (K)\u00a0conductance contributes to FSL in a number of different cell types throughout the nervous system\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib21\">Meng et al., 2011</a>). The channels responsible for this conductance are largely inactive at resting membrane potential, but this inactivation can be removed by a membrane hyperpolarization\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib32\">Yellen, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Maffie and Rudy, 2008</a>). To test whether similar K channels contribute to the FSL in CRH neurons, we conducted experiments in which we did not deliver a membrane hyperpolarization prior to a depolarizing current step. The absence of this hyperpolarizing pre-pulse decreased the FSL in CRH neurons from socially-isolated females (FSL<sub>noHP</sub>: 37.8 \u00b1 3.1 ms vs FSL<sub>HP</sub>: 55.3 \u00b1 4.5 ms, paired t-test, p=0.0022, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure\u00a0supplement 1</a>). Rapidly activating and inactivating K currents are sensitive to millimolar concentrations of 4-aminopyridine (4-AP)\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib1\">Alexander et al., 2015</a>), and consistent with this, we observed shorter FSL in the presence of 2\u2009mM 4-AP (FSL<sub>4-AP</sub>: 36.8 \u00b1 5.6 ms vs FSL<sub>control</sub>: 62.8 \u00b1 7.6 ms unpaired t-test, p=0.015\u2009n\u00a0=\u00a08, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a</a>). We obtained voltage clamp recordings and characterized the currents responsible for regulating FSL (male<sub>single</sub> n\u00a0=\u00a011, female<sub>single</sub> n\u00a0=\u00a012). These currents were largely inactive at resting membrane potential, inactivated quickly and required membrane hyperpolarization to relieve inactivation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4b</a>). They were partially blocked by 2\u2009mM 4-AP, fully blocked by 6\u2009mM 4-AP (n\u00a0=\u00a04, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4c</a>), but were unaffected by a lower concentration\u00a0of 4-AP(500 uM, data not shown)\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib2\">Anderson et al., 2010</a>). In addition, these currents were insensitive to 20\u2009mM TEA (data not shown). Neurons from socially-isolated females showed no difference in activation or recovery from inactivation in comparison to isolated males (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4d</a>). There was no difference in current density in socially-isolated females when compared to socially-isolated males (data not shown), arguing against an increase in channel number or conductance. We next asked whether channel kinetics might explain the differences in FSL. There was no difference in the activation kinetics between males and females, but currents from female mice had a longer decay time constant in comparison to males (\u03c4<sub>female single</sub>: 55.8 \u00b1 5.6 ms, n\u00a0=\u00a011, vs \u03c4<sub>male single</sub>: 41.9 \u00b1 2.9 ms, n\u00a0=\u00a011, unpaired t-test, p=0.019, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4e,f</a>). These findings indicate that a slowing in the decay of a rapidly activating, rapidly inactivating voltage-gated K current is causative for the increase in FSL."

We conducted experiments in which depolarizing current steps (20\u2009pA intervals) were preceded by a hyperpolarizing pre-pulse. CRH neurons from female isolated mice required a greater depolarization to generate a spike compared to CRH neurons from socially isolated males. This is revealed as a rightward shift in the relationship between spike probability and current step (female: I<sub>50\u00a0</sub>=\u00a049.5 \u00b1 1.2 mV, n\u00a0=\u00a0104 vs male: I<sub>50\u00a0</sub>= 55.0 \u00b1 1.6 mV, n\u00a0=\u00a088, p&lt;0.0001, K-S statistic). Finally, we compared the excitability of CRH neurons from isolated females and males. We used a protocol (hyperpolarizing pre-pulse followed by a family of depolarizing steps) that allowed for maximal activation of the rapidly activating K current described above. The rightward shift in the F-I plot indicates that CRH neurons from isolated females had lower excitability in comparison to isolated males (p&lt;0.0001, K-S statistic, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5b</a>)."

By contrast, an acute physical stress (swim) increased FSL in group-housed females and single-housed males. In addition, social isolation occluded the effects of swim stress on female mice. CORT is both necessary for the isolation (females) and swim stress (males and females) induced increases in FSL and sufficient to increase FSL in the absence of stress.

In addition, FSL was profoundly sensitive to pre-hyperpolarizing pulses, which remove channel inactivation and make rapidly inactivating K channels available for opening in response to depolarizations. The features of these channels are consistent with Kv4 channels previously described in the PVN\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib15\">Lee et al., 2012</a>). They do, however, exhibit a more hyperpolarized activation threshold in comparison to kinetically similar 4-AP sensitive channels reported in PVN parvocellular neurosecretory cells in rat\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib16\">Luther and Tasker, 2000</a>). We failed to note any differences in overall current density or voltage-dependent activation or recovery from inactivation. We did, however, observe an increase in the decay time constant of rapidly inactivating K currents in socially-isolated female mice compared to male mice, providing a potential underlying mechanism for the prolonged FSL in response to depolarization. The longer FSL we observed is not a classically defined characteristic of CRH neurons and, in fact, the absence of this delay has been used previously to categorize putative CRH neurons\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib11\">Hoffman et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Wamsteeker Cusulin et al., 2013b</a>)."

By contrast, both males and females show indistinguishable responses to an acute physical swim stress. These findings highlight the importance of carefully considering both the sex of the animal and the stressor modality when designing studies investigating neurobiological effects of stress. Indeed recent work demonstrating sex-specific expression of fear responses in rodents\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib9\">Gruene et al., 2015</a>) serves as a corollary to our observations and when taken together suggests that strategies for coping with stress are sex-specific.

Finally, as our observations report sex-specific differences in response to stress in the first two weeks post-weaning, they provide clear evidence for biological effects on the stress axis that are independent of circulating gonadal hormones\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib20\">McCarthy and Arnold, 2011</a>). This exquisite sensitivity of the brain during the pre-adolescent period\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib8\">Foilb et al., 2011</a>) raises intriguing questions about the long-term consequences of subtle environmental and social manipulations on stress responses and behavior in males and females later in life."

The normal intracellular solution contained (in mM): 108\u2009K\u2010gluconate, 2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 8 Na\u2010gluconate, 8 KCl, 1 K<sub>2</sub>\u2010EGTA, 4 K<sub>2</sub>\u2010ATP, and 0.3 Na<sub>3</sub>\u2010GTP buffered with 10\u2009mM HEPES. For images of filled cells, 0.2\u00a0mM Alexa-488 hydrazide and 10 mg\u00b7mL<sup>\u22121</sup> biocytin were\u00a0added to internal solution. Microscope images were captured using a Retiga EXi camera (Qimaging) and processed using ImageJ."

Data were recorded (pClamp 9.2; Molecular Devices) and stored on a computer for offline analysis. During all experiments, initial access resistance (R<sub>a</sub>) was below 20 M\u03a9. Cell membrane properties were monitored for the duration of the experiments and only recordings in which changes to R<sub>a</sub> C<sub>m</sub> did not exceed 15% were accepted for analysis. For synaptic experiments, the cell membrane was voltage clamped at \u221280\u00a0mV. Spontaneous inhibitory ionotropic GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) were isolated by blocking AMPA\u2010 and kainate\u2010receptor\u2010mediated glutamatergic synaptic transmission with 6,7\u2010dinitroquinoxaline\u20102,3\u2010dione (DNQX, 10\u2009\u03bcM). When measuring spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs), the GABA<sub>A</sub> channel blocker picrotoxin (100\u2009\u03bcM) was included in the bath to isolate excitatory currents mediated by AMPA and kainate receptors. These spontaneous currents representing stochastic transmitter release were analyzed using MiniAnalysis 6.0.3 (Synaptosoft, Decatur, GA). Event detection was set at three times the baseline noise and confirmed as synaptic events by eye."

Latency to spike initiation and firing thresholds were both measured using a current clamp depolarization step protocols. First, a baseline current injection that maintained the membrane voltage near \u221280\u00a0mV was chosen individually for each cell, which served to exclude the possible confounding influence of variable resting membrane potentials between cells. Next, a 200\u00a0ms/30\u00a0pA hyperpolarizing current injection was given followed by 250\u00a0ms/20\u00a0pA depolarizing current steps up to 140\u00a0pA. The latency time was measured as the duration from the point of initiating the depolarizing pulse to the initiation of the first spike. Firing threshold was determined\u00a0as the membrane potential at the initiation of the first spike. Both firing threshold and membrane potential are corrected for a liquid junction potential of 12\u00a0mV, as calculated with solution ion concentrations."

In addition, the authors nicely show that this effect can be partially reversed by pair housing (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). However, it's unclear to me why the authors then followed up by exploring corticosterone modulation of swim stress FSL increases in males and not females (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). Why didn't they look at CORT modulation of their initial finding (i.e. FSL in socially isolated females)? It therefore becomes difficult to directly link the findings in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>. Moreover, the experiments in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> also seem to be only loosely connected to the primary story. Based on the title of the paper, it is unclear why most of the mechanistic work (all of the CORT-related experiments) is done in males and not females, and the paper as a whole feels very disjointed, even if the individual experiments are more or less experimentally sound."

The work is timely, interesting, and well done, though the premise is slightly oversold. The second sentence of the manuscript states, \"an unproven corollary is that the absence of a social network may itself be stressful\".

This is a difficult \"chicken-and-egg\" issue, that nonetheless deserves more attention in the Discussion since the implicit idea is that this plasticity will lead to altered HPA output.

The authors show clear differences in the response of PVN CRF neurons to social isolation, with CRF neurons from females showing a marked decrease in excitability as measured by the latency to first spike onset (FSL) in response to a transient depolarizing current injection compared to male CRF neurons. The authors show that a similar response can be induced in males in response to an acute non-social stressor, suggesting that the response is sex- and stressor specific. In subsequent experiments the authors show that the increased FSL was mimicked by systemic cortisol administration, but was not blocked by a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist. In contrast, application of an inhibitor of serum glucocorticoid kinase-1 (SGK1) prevented the cortisol-induced increase in FSL. The authors then argue that mechanistically, the increased FSL, is due to a cort-SGK1-dependent modulation of an underlying Kv4 channel-mediated IA current."

Many cells in the brain transiently express mRNA for peptides but fail to express the mature protein, for example a subclass of oxytocin (OT) neurons in the PVN co-express CRF mRNA. Hence the transgenic mouse may show significant ectopic expression of the reporter protein used to \"identify\" CRF neurons. Significantly a subpopulation of OT neurons have properties identical to those of putative CRF neurons in the female PVN following isolation stress (Luther &amp; Tasker, 2000), hence social isolation may upregulate CRF mRNA expression in these neurons and bias the sampling in subsequent recordings. 2) The authors fail to establish a cause-effect relationship for any of their independent observations. 3) In the absence of a dose-response relationship for 4-AP the assumption that the transient outward current is mediated by Kv4 channels is groundless. Many other transient outward K<sup>+</sup> channels are blocked by lower concentrations of 4-AP. Also what evidence do the authors have that these cells even express Kv4 channels? 4) SGK1 activation modulates the activity of multiple ion channels that could affect the FSL including Kv1.1 \u2013 1.5, M-channels, and ASIC1 channels, and the author provide no evidence for a direct/specific effect of SGK1 on Kv4 channel activity. Consequently, the manuscript reads like a collection of independent observations that have been rather tenuously linked together into a story that is mostly speculation."

From my reading, the authors did not test swim stress alone in either group. Conversely, the lack of FSL increase in response to swim stress in isolated females seems more like a ceiling effect than an occlusion. To be able to conclude that the isolation-induced FSL increase in females is due to stress, the authors should be able to show the same effect in group housed females exposed to swim stress. Additionally, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a> shows the CORT/FSL correlation for males only, when the primary hypothesis seems to be for females.

As with the first version of this manuscript, these kinds of decisions make it seem like the authors are throwing together a bunch of data without considering how each experiment contributes to the overarching conclusions. If the goal of this project is to define sexual dimorphism in CRH neuronal responses to stress and stress hormones, they need to do these experiments in both sexes and experimentally dissect out the roles of isolation vs. swim stress, since in many experiments these conditions are combined."

Hence the transgenic mouse may show significant ectopic expression of the reporter protein used to \"identify\" CRF neurons.

If the hypothesis is that FSL changes in isolated females are due to stress, then how does stressing isolated males test this hypothesis? (Results, fourth paragraph). It seems to me that it could just be a matter of degree \u2013 i.e. isolation isn't sufficiently stressful to increase FSL in males, but isolation + swim stress is. From my reading, the authors did not test swim stress alone in either group. Conversely, the lack of FSL increase in response to swim stress in isolated females seems more like a ceiling effect than an occlusion. To be able to conclude that the isolation-induced FSL increase in females is due to stress, the authors should be able to show the same effect in group housed females exposed to swim stress.</i> "
