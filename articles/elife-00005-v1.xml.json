In spite of its biological importance, little is known about PRC2 architecture and subunit organization. Here, we present the first three-dimensional electron microscopy structure of the human PRC2 complex bound to its cofactor AEBP2. Using a novel internal protein tagging-method, in combination with isotopic chemical cross-linking and mass spectrometry, we have localized all the PRC2 subunits and their functional domains and generated a detailed map of interactions. The position and stabilization effect of AEBP2 suggests an allosteric role of this cofactor in regulating gene silencing. Regions in PRC2 that interact with modified histone tails are localized near the methyltransferase site, suggesting a molecular mechanism for the chromatin-based regulation of PRC2 activity."

In spite of its biological importance, little is known about PRC2 architecture and subunit organization. Here, we present the first three-dimensional electron microscopy structure of the human PRC2 complex bound to its cofactor AEBP2. Using a novel internal protein tagging-method, in combination with isotopic chemical cross-linking and mass spectrometry, we have localized all the PRC2 subunits and their functional domains and generated a detailed map of interactions. The position and stabilization effect of AEBP2 suggests an allosteric role of this cofactor in regulating gene silencing. Regions in PRC2 that interact with modified histone tails are localized near the methyltransferase site, suggesting a molecular mechanism for the chromatin-based regulation of PRC2 activity."

PcG and TrxG complexes are evolutionarily conserved in eukaryotes and regulate chromatin structure through recruitment to Polycomb or Trithorax Responsive Elements (PREs, TREs) for gene silencing or activation, respectively (<a href=\"#bib37\">Schuettengruber et al., 2007</a>). Within the PcG protein complexes, Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) plays an essential role in chromatin modification by di- and tri-methylating Lys 27 of Histone H3 (H3K27me2/3) (<a href=\"#bib5\">Cao et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Czermin et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Muller et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Kirmizis et al., 2004</a>). In higher eukaryotes, high levels of H3K27me3 are typically associated with transcriptional repression and gene silencing. The importance of the PcG protein in this process is emphasized by the observation that deletion of any of its components in mice results in early embryonic lethality or severe defects during development (<a href=\"#bib27\">O'Carroll et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Pasini et al., 2004</a>)."

Both Ezh1 and Ezh2 contain enzymatic methyl-transferase activity within a C-terminal SET (Su(var)3-9, Enhancer-of-zeste, Trithorax) domain. PRC2 complexes containing Ezh1 have lower enzymatic activity than those containing Ezh2, and target a subset of Ezh2 genes (<a href=\"#bib22\">Margueron et al., 2008</a>). Ezh2 activity appears to depend on interaction with both Suz12 and the WD40 domain in EED (<a href=\"#bib3\">Cao and Zhang, 2004a</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Pasini et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Yamamoto et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Ketel et al., 2005</a>).

We overexpressed the five-component PRC2-AEBP2 complex using the shorter isoform of AEBP2 protein, which is missing an extended unstructured region present in the longest isoform. Stoichiometric and biochemically homogeneous PRC2-AEPB2 complex was purified from insect cell lysate by affinity chromatography using a StrepII tag on the AEBP2 subunit, followed by size exclusion chromatography (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). The subunits of the purified complex appeared to be stoichiometric by SDS page, although we could not rule out the presence of a small excess of AEBP2, as this subunit was utilized for tag-based purification. In our EM images we observed a small percentage of very small particles, which could be attributed to views of the complex oriented perpendicular to the plane of the grid, or to the presence of partial complexes (even AEBP2 by itself). These smaller particles were not considered in the generation of the 3D reconstruction (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). While inclusion of the cofactor significantly improved the quality of the 2D class averages in EM analysis (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, top row), both detailed inspection and attempts to pursue a 3D reconstruction (not shown) indicated that the stability of the complex remained limiting. In order to preserve complex stability for further structural analysis, we mildly cross-linked the PRC2-AEBP2 complexes using 0.015% glutaraldehyde. Under these conditions we saw no apparent aggregation of the complex (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Importantly, comparison of class averages of the non cross-linked and the cross-linked sample (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, bottom row), shows that the cross-linking had a positive effect on the stability of the complex, as judged by the increased detail in the class averages (for similar number of particles and classes). Class averages show PRC2 having an elongated shape, with top and bottom density regions that are joined at a narrow central point (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>)."

Tilted and untilted image pairs were collected (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), and 20 reference-free 2D class averages were calculated from the untilted classes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). RCT reconstructions were generated for each class average using the corresponding tilted images (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,C</a>). A four-lobed organization was evident in all the resulting models, indicating that the complex likely assumes one major architectural state. Concurrently, we collected a large dataset (\u223c40,000 particles) of untilted images, which were used to generate 1000 reference-free 2D class averages. Euler angles were assigned to these class averages, using each of the 20 RCT reconstructions as reference models. The results showed that the class averages were aligned in 3D in a self-consistent fashion, producing a similar complex architecture at the low resolution expected at this stage, irrespective of the RCT structure used as a reference (data not shown). Not surprisingly, Euler assignment using the RCT model from the most populated class gave a reconstruction that had the most structural detail (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, class 4). This reconstruction was then used as an initial model (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>) for multiple rounds of projection-based angular refinement for single particles of the full 0\u00b0 dataset (<a href=\"#bib30\">Penczek et al., 1994</a>).

Due to the shape of the complex and its tendency to lie flat on the grid, we do not have an even distribution of views. However, views around the longitudinal axis of the model (vertical axis in the Euler plot) are well represented (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). The quality of our model in representing the experimental images was confirmed by comparing the re-projected 3D reconstruction of the PRC2-AEBP2 complex with reference-free class averages (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>)."

Based on the observations that the Zn finger of AEBP2 and the C-terminal region of Suz12 together interact with both the N-terminal SANT and C-terminal SET domains of Ezh2, we propose that these two terminal regions of Ezh2 are within proximity to, or directly interacting with each other."

In addition, Schmitges and colleagues identified a region downstream of this Suz12 helix that plays an important role in stabilizing this interaction. Due to the absence of exposed lysines, we did not observe any cross-linking between the regions of RbAp48 and Suz12 shown to interact in the crystal structure. We did identify internal cross-linking within the WD40 propeller of RbAp48 [K<sub>114/120</sub>\u2013K<sub>160</sub>\u2013K<sub>215/220</sub>], consistent with the reported crystal structure of the isoform RbAp46 (PDB: 3CFS; <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Additionally, we detect the presence of a set of three interactions between the WD40 domain of RbAp48 [K<sub>307/309</sub>] and the central portion of Suz12 [K<sub>167</sub>\u2013K<sub>403</sub>] (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). This result suggests that the stabilizing downstream region described by Schmitges and colleagues might actually involve a larger portion of Suz12. In addition to this interaction with RbAp48, we also observe cross-linking between this region of Suz12 [K<sub>304</sub>\u2013K<sub>403</sub>] and AEBP2 [K<sub>229</sub>\u2013K<sub>274</sub>]. These residues of AEBP2 also interact with AEBP2's own Zn finger domain [K<sub>95</sub>\u2013K<sub>166</sub>] (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). Taken together, these findings suggest that RbAp48, the central domain of Suz12, and AEBP2 undergo extensive interactions, in agreement with previous biochemical data (<a href=\"#bib4\">Cao and Zhang, 2004b</a>)."

Neither N-terminal MBP nor C-terminal GFP fusions assembled into stoichiometric or stable complexes. To overcome this limitation, we took advantage of the fact that the GFP N- and C-termini are in close spatial proximity and designed an expression vector to generate protein chimeras containing an internal GFP, connected by a short loop, at desired sites along the main protein chain. Using the crystal structure of EED (PDB: 2QXV), we designed four constructs, each containing an internal GFP at a distinct site within the WD40 domain. The two constructs containing an internal GFP at either residue 115 or 370 (EED-GFP<sub>115</sub> and EED-GFP<sub>370</sub>) assembled into stoichiometric and stable complexes that were used for EM analysis (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>, panels I and II, respectively). Comparing the internally GFP-tagged EED sample with the untagged form allowed us to identify the additional GFP density protruding from the WD40-shaped Lobe A (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). To further confirm this localization, we reconstituted and analyzed a complex containing an N-terminal MBP on Ezh2. According to the known crystal structure (<a href=\"#bib9\">Han et al., 2007</a>), the EED WD40 domain interacts with the N-terminal region of Ezh2. Therefore, an MBP in this region should localize similarly to Lobe A. Consistent with this prediction, 2D analysis of this construct showed additional density corresponding to an MBP tag protruding from Lobe A (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). Based on the positions of the two internal GFP tags for EED and the MBP tag for Ezh2, we were able to accurately orient the EED-Ezh2 crystal structure within the 3D EM density. This information, together with the crystal structure of histone H3-bound EED (<a href=\"#bib21\">Margueron et al., 2009</a>), suggests that the canonical histone H3-binding site is located in a cavity at the intersection of Lobe A and Arm 2 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>)."

To test this idea, we reconstituted complexes carrying an N-terminal MBP or and internal or C-terminal GFP tag on RbAp48, but none of these fusion constructs produced a stable and stoichiometric complex. To overcome this limitation, we again took advantage on the known interaction between Nurf55 (<i>Drosophila</i> ortholog of RbAp48) and Suz12 that has been structurally characterized (<a href=\"#bib26\">Nowak et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Schmitges et al., 2011</a>). We generated a complex bearing an internal GFP tag immediately after the alpha helix of Suz12 that interacts with RbAp48 (Suz12-GFP<sub>123</sub>). In this particular case, the canonical view was not as well represented and the label was more clearly seen in a different orientation (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). The GFP can be seen localizing to Lobe D, confirming that Suz12 interacts with the RbAp48 propeller at this position."

The WD40 propeller and protruding N-terminal alpha-helix of RbAp48 were accommodated within this region with high fidelity. The docked crystal structure of the histone H3-bound RbAp48 (<a href=\"#bib26\">Nowak et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Schmitges et al., 2011</a>) provides further insight into histone binding.

However, neither of them resulted in clearly identifiable densities by 2D analysis, probably because these two regions are predicted to be unstructured and the tags were too mobile. While mutant complexes carrying internal GFP tags at the Zn finger and VEFS domains resulted in unstable complexes, two others were amenable for structural studies. The first was a mutant complex containing a GFP tag in the central portion of Suz12 (Suz12-GFP<sub>269</sub>) that exhibited additional density near Lobe C (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10A</a>, panel I). The second complex contained a C-terminal truncation of Suz12 after the VEFS domain, with a GFP tag at the truncated terminus (Suz12-\u0394C-GFP). This complex showed extra density extending from Lobe B (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10A</a>, panel II). Together, our labeling data suggest that Suz12's N-terminal region is located at Lobe C, and terminates at Lobe B near the SET domain of Ezh2, most likely passing through Arm2 (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10B</a>)."

With the exception of MBP-AEBP2, which failed to form a stable complex, all the resulting complexes were suitable for EM analysis. AEBP2-GFP<sub>84</sub> (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10A</a>, panel III) and AEBP2-GFP<sub>115</sub> (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10A</a>, panel IV) both localized near Lobe A and Arm 1. This location, in the vicinity of EED and the first SANT domain of Ezh2 (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10B</a>), agrees with our cross-linking data (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figures 5 and 10C</a>). 2D analysis of the AEBP2-EGFP\u2013containing complex shows that the C-terminal region of AEBP2 is located between Lobes A and D, possibly within Arm 2 (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10A</a>, panel V). Importantly, our cross-linking data also indicate that the AEBP2 C-terminus makes extensive interactions with the central portion of Suz12 (304\u2013416), suggesting that these two segments might co-localize to Arm 2 and into Lobe D (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figures 5 and 10C</a>). Thus, AEBP2 runs in the opposite direction of Suz12, with its central portion located near Arm 1 and Lobe A, from where it continues along the PRC2 structure, terminating near Arm 2 and the top of Lobe D (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10B</a>).

These genomic \u2018on\u2019 and \u2018off\u2019 switches are primarily controlled through the trimethylation of H3K4 (H3K4-me3), H3K36 (H3K36-me2/3), and H3K27 (H3K27-me3). The PRC2 complex is an important member of the PcG family, and a large number of biochemical studies have suggested models for its role in mediating gene repression (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib20\">Margueron and Reinberg, 2011</a>). Characterizing the spatial arrangement of the PRC2 components is a fundamental step towards understanding the molecular mechanism underlying PRC2's regulated histone methylation and its role in gene silencing. However, structural studies so far have been limited to two isolated domains out of the four PRC2 protein subunits, severely restricting our understanding of the molecular mechanism of this fundamental complex. Here, by using EM in conjunction with chemical cross-linking and mass spectrometry, we provide the complete PRC2 architecture, describing the structure of this complex bound to its co-factor AEBP2. We present a detailed map of localizations and interactions of its constitutive subunits, integrating previous structural and biochemical studies into a more comprehensive molecular model of PRC2 activity."

This activation results in propagation of the repressive chromatin state to neighboring nucleosomes containing newly incorporated unmodified histone H3 (<a href=\"#bib11\">Hansen et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Margueron et al., 2009</a>). On the other hand, the studies of Schmitges and colleagues suggested that binding of the chromatin activation marks H3K4me3 and H3K36me2-3, inhibits PRC2 activity if placed in cis on the same tail containing the target lysine H3K27 (<a href=\"#bib36\">Schmitges et al., 2011</a>). Additionally, it has been proposed that the subunit Suz12, and in particular its VEFS domain, is responsible in mediating this inhibition (<a href=\"#bib36\">Schmitges et al., 2011</a>). Since this inhibitory effect can be reversed by the addition of H3K27me3 containing peptides, it has been thought that PRC2 can simultaneously integrate inhibitory and activating chromatin marks tuning its enzymatic activity based on the surrounding chromatin state (<a href=\"#bib36\">Schmitges et al., 2011</a>)."

Our structure and cross-linking studies show an intricate network of interaction between the N-terminal and WD40 regions of EED and SET and SANT domains of Ezh2. These SANT domains may couple EED-mediated binding of methylated histone H3 to the methyltransferase activity of Ezh2 (<a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12A</a>), suggesting that complex activity could be influenced through incorporation of EED isoforms that differ in their N-terminal regions."

Importantly, our PRC2 subunit organization is consistent with previously proposed models of PRC2 activity (<a href=\"#bib21\">Margueron et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Schmitges et al., 2011</a>): when chromatin domains are targeted for repression, PRC2 is recruited to deposit the repressive H3K27me3 histone mark at nucleosome-associated regions of DNA. Existing H3K27me3 marks are recognized by EED and, possibly in cooperation with Ezh2's SANT domains, Ezh2 methyltransferase activity is increased (<a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12A</a>). To ensure that H3K27 trimethylation is limited only to the repressed target, PRC2 is capable of repressing its own enzymatic activity. When PRC2 comes into contact with the boundary of an active gene, the interaction between H3K4me3, H3K36me2, and H3K36me3 with the VEFS domain of Suz12, could be propagated to the Ezh2 subunit, blocking PRC2 activity (<a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12B</a>)."

Molecular explanations for this substrate preference have been largely hypothetical in the absence of any structural information. The positioning of the different subunits within the PRC2 structure suggests a model of how PRC2 could interact with a dinucleosome, by placing the regions interacting with histone tails in opposite sides of the complex, thus allowing interaction with two nucleosomes simultaneously, without any steric hindrance. <a href=\"#fig13\">Figure 13</a> suggests a possible arrangement illustrating this point that also agrees with the proposed binding of AEBP2 to nucleosomal DNA (<a href=\"#bib13\">Kim et al., 2009</a>). In such arrangement, EED binding to one nucleosome would position the histone H3 tail from the second nucleosome in close proximity to the Ezh2 SET domain (<a href=\"#fig13\">Figure 13</a>)."

The full set of tagged particles corresponding to this projection view gives rise to a class average with very good signal for the complex, as well as some extra density, corresponding to the tag, which is distinctive but typically smeared to different extents for different samples due to the flexibility of the tag. For a clearer visualization of the tag, we subclassified particles within this view. Two examples of the subclassification are shown for GFP-tagged complexes in <a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1</a>. The pivoting of the tag density can be clearly seen in these classes and in <a href=\"#media1\">Movie 1</a>. The percentage of subclasses clearly showing the tag ranges from 100% for a significant number of labels to 57% for the least favorable case (likely due to proteolysis). For the generation of the figures in the main text of the paper we chose to show a single subclass average with a larger number of particles that accurately resembles the full ensemble, but that more clearly shows the density of the tag, nicely corresponding to the mass expected for proteins of their size. These classes were then compared to the wild-type PRC2 class averages through cross-correlation using the SPIDER \u2018AP SH\u2019 command. After alignment, the matching class averages for the untagged and tagged complexes were individually normalized and then the PRC2 class averages were subtracted from the PRC2-tagged class averages.

The class averages were then back-projected according to their assigned Euler angles to provide a three-dimensional model based solely on 0\u00b0 particles data. The resulting 3D reconstructions, albeit at low resolution, were highly consistent, indicating that there is one major architectural state of the complex. We used the reconstruction obtained from the more populated RCT class as the initial model for refinement against single particles of the full 0\u00b0 data set. Since potential end-on views of the complex were not considered during structure determination, as they could not be distinguished from partial complexes, we relied on \u2018tomographic\u2019 coverage of the views along the long axis of the structure. This refinement was performed using an iterative projection-matching script that makes use of libraries from the SPARX and EMAN2 image processing packages (<a href=\"#bib1\">Baldwin and Penczek, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Tang et al., 2007</a>)."

The recombinant complex produced in insect cells was characterized biochemically and analyzed by negative stain electron microscopy to determine a 3-D model of the assembly at 21 \u00c5 resolution. Cross-linking experiments combined with mass spectrometry analysis was used to identify at the sequence level the most prominent protein-protein contacts. Furthermore a large number of complexes were produced, each carrying a large protein tag at a different position in order to identify and position the constituent proteins and several of their domains in the 3-D envelope. This structural characterization allowed a clear positioning of existing atomic structures or homology models of the complex components. PRC2 is of fundamental importance and high interest, and this structure is a very significant advance over previous high-resolution structures of isolated domains of 2 PRC2 components. The authors make a number of suggestions to provide a structural basis for previous biochemical observations. These include how the enzymatic activity is affected by modifications of the H3 tail, as well as the stabilization of the complex by the AEBP1 cofactor. These inferences about biochemical function are speculative given the resolution of the structure."

Regarding the EM images, we noticed the presence of smaller particles.

Those particles were consequently not considered during the 3D data processing, and we relied on a good \u201ctomographic\u201d coverage of the views around the long axis of the structure.

During the past few years, work from different labs have shown how the enzymatic activity of PRC2 is affected by modifications of Histone H3. It has also been shown how the binding of AEBP2 affects and increases its activity. In this paper we describe the first molecular organization of the PRC2 complex and how AEBP2 interacts with different regions of the complex. In the discussion section we are simply placing the published biochemical data in the framework of the structure and protein connections we have visualized. This is something that could not be done before and that opens new questions and testable models. We believe that the localization we describe here does lead to a parsimonious explanation of biochemical data that we truly feel should be indicated at this point. To address the reviewers\u2019 concerns we have revised the text to clarify how far the present data takes us, making clear where we are just placing biochemical data into a physical context, and when we are extrapolating, in a logical way, to propose testable models that really build on our new structural data, always keeping in mind the resolution limitation."

If the complexes were homogeneous this would correspond to an angular difference of 40 or 50 degrees between classes which is a large merging angle and would lead to a rather poor resolution. If several different conformations were to be considered an even larger merging angle would be considered. The authors should justify why only 20 classes were reconstructed</i>."

Had we made more classes, then the RCT reconstructions would have had much fewer particles, and not been interpretable. As we relied on a good \u201ctomographic\u201d coverage of the views around the long axis of the structure, we were expecting to have a coverage of about 18 degrees from the 20 classes (360/20). We believe this was a good compromise between angular spread and signal. A proof of this principle was that our strategy actually worked, generating an RCT 3D model from which reprojections matched well our reference free 2D classes, and that ultimately aided to refine our untilted data to 21 \u00c5."
