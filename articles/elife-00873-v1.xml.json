The pore domain, which is about 40 \u00c5 wide and 45 \u00c5 deep, also contains four sites within its lumen that K<sup>+</sup> ions can bind to. This ion channel opens and closes in response to changes in the voltage of the lipid membrane around the cell: these changes are detected by voltage sensors (blue). Some toxins inhibit opening of the pore by binding to these voltage sensors, but charybdotoxin (not shown) targets the pore itself.

Envisioning the end of the channel as a whirlpool, they named this protein charybdotoxin after Charybdis, the daughter of Poseidon, who was turned into a whirlpool generating sea monster by Zeus. The one-to-one stoichiometry between charybdotoxin and the channel hinted that the toxin targeted the pore because it was assumed at the time that Kv channels are formed by four identical subunits and that the pore would be located at the interface between them."

They found that increasing the internal potassium concentration caused the toxin to dissociate more rapidly, which led them to propose that the toxin bound to the external end of pore itself, as opposed to another part of the protein, and that potassium ions entering the pore from the inside could interact with the toxin (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). In effect, this simple and elegant experiment suggested that charybdotoxin was a literal pore-blocker. When the first gene for a Kv channel was identified and sequenced (<a href=\"#bib9\">Papazian et al., 1987</a>), Miller and MacKinnon set out to use their newly discovered pore-blocking toxin to identify the region of the channel protein that forms the outermost end of the pore. It was not long before they found that mutations within the loop between two putative membrane-spanning segments had large effects on toxin binding: this was the ground-breaking result which suggested that this region must form the external end of the pore (<a href=\"#bib6\">MacKinnon and Miller, 1989</a>)."

This feature is particularly satisfying because it is precisely what MacKinnon and Miller had proposed in 1988 to explain how the potassium ions inside the cell can permeate along the pore and influence the dissociation of toxin bound to the external end of the pore (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). It also explains why mutant toxins that do not contain a lysine base at this position are less effective at blocking this ion channel and are no longer sensitive to the concentration of internal potassium (<a href=\"#bib10\">Park and Miller, 1992</a>)."

Another interesting feature of these new X-ray structures is that charybdotoxin does not alter the structure of the channel when it binds: rather, it blocks the flow of ions by fitting neatly into the pore like a cork."

For the moment, the number of solved toxin-channel structures is still small, but this number is sure to increase in the future, and it will be exciting to see what they can teach us about the mechanisms of ion channel proteins."
