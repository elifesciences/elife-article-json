However, the molecular mechanisms underlying distinction between foreign DNA and host genomic material inside the nucleus are not understood. By combining biochemical assays and single-molecule techniques, we show that the nuclear innate immune sensor IFI16 one-dimensionally tracks long stretches of exposed foreign dsDNA to assemble into supramolecular signaling platforms. We also demonstrate that nucleosomes represent barriers that prevent IFI16 from targeting host DNA by directly interfering with these one-dimensional movements. This unique scanning-assisted assembly mechanism allows IFI16 to distinguish friend from foe and assemble into oligomers efficiently and selectively on foreign DNA."

By combining biochemical assays and single-molecule techniques, we show that the nuclear innate immune sensor IFI16 one-dimensionally tracks long stretches of exposed foreign dsDNA to assemble into supramolecular signaling platforms. We also demonstrate that nucleosomes represent barriers that prevent IFI16 from targeting host DNA by directly interfering with these one-dimensional movements. This unique scanning-assisted assembly mechanism allows IFI16 to distinguish friend from foe and assemble into oligomers efficiently and selectively on foreign DNA."

One way that the immune system can identify these invaders is by detecting genetic material from the microbes. Like us, many of these microbes have genetic material made of a two-stranded molecule called DNA. A protein called IFI16 is an important sensor in immune cells that can bind to foreign DNA, but not to the DNA of the host. If the ability to discriminate between host and foreign DNA is lost, then immune cells start to attack the body\u2019s own tissues, which can lead to severe \u201cautoimmune\u201d diseases. However, it is not clear how IFI16 and other sensor proteins are able to tell foreign and host DNA apart."

When foreign DNA enters the cell, IFI16 promotes the formation of nucleosomes on these molecules, but the nucleosomes are further apart than those in host DNA, which leaves longer stretches of \u201cexposed\u201d DNA between the nucleosomes. In 2014, a group of researchers reported that multiple molecules of IFI16 associate with each other and form clusters on exposed foreign DNA. Here, Stratmann, Morrone et al. \u2013 including some of the researchers from the earlier work \u2013 investigated how IFI16 selectively binds to foreign DNA using a combination of biochemical and single-molecule techniques."

As more molecules of IFI16 bind to this DNA, they bump into each other and start to form clusters that eventually become immobile. Further experiments show that the more tightly packed nucleosomes in host DNA molecules act as a barrier to IFI16 cluster formation because they interfere with the ability of the protein to move along the DNA."

Remarkably, such signatures include universal building blocks of all life, such as DNA and RNA (<a href=\"#bib5\">Janeway and Medzhitov, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Orzalli and Knipe, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Paludan and Bowie, 2013</a>). In the cytoplasm, the immune system relies on the absence of endogenous DNA, and thus marks all detected DNA as 'foreign' (nonself) (<a href=\"#bib23\">Orzalli and Knipe, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Paludan and Bowie, 2013</a>). However, DNA viruses often evade the cytosolic detection machineries, as their genomes are not exposed until reaching the nucleus (<a href=\"#bib23\">Orzalli and Knipe, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Paludan and Bowie, 2013</a>). The host counters this infection strategy in the nucleus by directly assembling supramolecular signaling platforms that trigger inflammatory responses on invading foreign DNA, but not on its own genomic material (<a href=\"#bib7\">Johnson et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Li et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Kerur et al., 2011</a>). Although key players that target foreign dsDNA in the host nucleus have been identified (<a href=\"#bib23\">Orzalli and Knipe, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Paludan and Bowie, 2013</a>), the molecular mechanisms by which these sensors distinguish self from nonself dsDNA remain unknown."

IFI16 plays a central role in defense against a number of pathogens (e.g herpes simplex virus-1) (<a href=\"#bib32\">Unterholzner et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Johnson et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Li et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Kerur et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Orzalli et al., 2012</a>). On the other hand, persistent IFI16 signaling is associated with autoimmunity (e.g. Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome) (<a href=\"#bib17\">Mondini et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Choubey et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Mondini et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Gugliesi et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Smith and Jefferies, 2014</a>). The molecular mechanisms by which IFI16 selectively targets foreign dsDNA remain unknown. To establish a functional signaling platform, IFI16 must overcome two challenges. First, individual IFI16 molecules must be able to locate one another on large pathogen genomes with sizes ranging from 10<sup>5</sup> to 10<sup>6</sup> base pairs (bps). Second and more importantly, this assembly mechanism can only take place on foreign dsDNA and must be inhibited on host dsDNA (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Here, we report the observation of a unifying molecular mechanism that explains how IFI16 resolves these central issues in initiating its foreign-dsDNA sensing pathways."

IFI16 fails to assemble into an oligomer on dsDNA shorter than 60 bp (indicated by a red arrow pointing left). The saturating rates can be explained if the final FRET signals arise from formation of distinct optimal oligomers."

Previous work demonstrated the existence of such oligomers and reported on their equilibrium binding properties but did not provide insights into the assembly mechanisms (<a href=\"#bib19\">Morrone et al., 2014</a>). Using various dsDNA fragment sizes present in excess, we observe that the assembly rate increased non-linearly and by 50-fold from 60 to 200 bps dsDNA, above which it stayed constant (up to 600 bps; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a>). With a dsDNA-binding footprint of ~15 bp for one IFI16 (<a href=\"#bib19\">Morrone et al., 2014</a>), our results indicate that about 4 copies are required to initiate assembly, and about 10 IFI16 molecules are required for optimal oligomeric assembly (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Further, the assembly rate constants scaled linearly with the IFI16 concentration for all measured DNA lengths (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1A</a>), indicating that a purely cooperative assembly mechanism is unlikely. In line with this observation, previous work reported relatively small contributions of cooperativity in oligomerization with Hill constants near 2 for DNA substrates up to 2000 bp (<a href=\"#bib19\">Morrone et al., 2014</a>)."

To directly test such a mechanism, we used single-molecule fluorescence imaging to track the movements of individual Cy5-labeled IFI16 molecules on stretched, double-sided attached \u03bb-phage dsDNA (\u03bbdsDNA; 48.5 kbps) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a> and <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a> shows that individual IFI16 molecules one-dimensionally (1D) diffuse on \u03bbdsDNA while bound for several seconds. The diffusion coefficient of IFI16 increased with ionic strength, indicating that IFI16 does not maintain a continuous electrostatic interaction with the dsDNA backbone, but instead moves along the \u03bbdsDNA scaffold by executing microscopically small steps (<a href=\"#bib1\">Blainey et al., 2006</a>) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). An IFI16 construct lacking the oligomerizing pyrin domain\u00a0(PYD) (IFI16<sup>HinAB</sup>; see also <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) showed similar diffusional properties, suggesting that the dsDNA-binding HIN200 domains are responsible for 1D diffusion. Upon applying higher concentrations of IFI16 with a constant supply of proteins into our flow cell, we observed a gradual formation of distinct, immobile clusters along \u03bbdsDNA (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>, and <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). Over time, we also observed an increase in the number of molecules per cluster and a concomitant decrease in the diffusion coefficient (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2C,D</a>). We analyzed the impact of flow on the diffusion coefficient and diffusion bias and found it to be not significant for cluster formation (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). Single-molecule intensity analysis revealed that the lower limit of the number of IFI16 molecules found in immobile clusters is equivalent to eight protomers (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), which also corroborate the optimal complex (ten protomers) suggested from <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>. Furthermore, individual IFI16 molecules either formed new clusters or joined other clusters in a stochastic manner, and the immobile clusters formed faster with higher IFI16 concentrations (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). The rate of addition of IFI16 molecules to clusters is independent on the size of the existing cluster, confirming the absence of strong cooperativity in assembly (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>; bottom panel)."

With the longer dsDNA acting as an antenna, it allows binding of more IFI16 while 1D diffusion facilitates dynamic association (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). The saturation of the assembly rate (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>) can be explained by the square dependence of the diffusional search time on length: at a sufficiently long dsDNA length, the dissociation rate of an individual IFI16 will be faster than the time needed to scan along the entire length of the DNA. In addition, longer DNA substrates work no longer as antennae, but as traps, since individual IFI16 molecules are farther apart and thus less likely to encounter one another (<a href=\"#bib4\">Hu et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Turkin et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">2016</a>). Overall, the results of our bulk and single-molecule experiments are consistent with the dsDNA-size dependent binding in\u00a0vitro(<a href=\"#bib19\">Morrone et al., 2014</a>), which also correlates with the IFI16-induced inflammatory responses in\u00a0vivo(<a href=\"#bib32\">Unterholzner et al., 2010</a>). Thus, we propose that the 1D-diffusion mediated assembly plays a key role in regulating the overall IFI16-mediated immune responses."

                        "text": "It has long been speculated that chromatinization acts as the key feature that allows IFI16 to distinguish host from foreign DNA in the nucleus (<a href=\"#bib8\">Kerur et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Unterholzner and Bowie, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Li et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Orzalli et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Johnson et at., 2014</a>); IFI16 oligomerizes on exposed invading foreign-dsDNA before it becomes hetero-chromatinized. Previous in\u00a0vivo work demonstrated that transfected chromatinized SV40 DNA is able to evade IFI16 oligomerization and downstream responses (<a href=\"#bib21\">Orzalli et al., 2013</a>). Nevertheless, the molecular mechanism by which IFI16 could use chromatinization to distinguish self from nonself has yet to be identified. To directly address this issue, we first used a competition-binding assay to investigate how IFI16 interacts with dsDNA fragments containing two nucleosomes with varying spacer sizes (6, 30, 50, and 70 bps; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Here, di-nucleosomes with 6-, 30-, and 50-bp spacer failed to compete against IFI16-bound FAM-labeled 70-bp dsDNA, (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). On the other hand, the di-nucleosome with 70-bp spacer competed similarly as 70-bp naked dsDNA, but significantly more weakly than naked 300-bp dsDNA (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). In FRET assembly assays, di-nucleosomes with spacers shorter than 70-bp failed to support assembly (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>), consistent with our FRET kinetics assays using naked dsDNA (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). The 70-bp spacer di-nucleosome supported oligomerization of IFI16; however, the assembly kinetics was again similar to that of naked 70-bp dsDNA, but not that of naked 300-bp dsDNA (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Taken together, these results show that efficient IFI16 cluster formation requires a minimal length of 50-70 base pairs of exposed dsDNA. Considering that the size of dsDNA linker between two nucleosomes is about 20 to 30 bps in mammals (<a href=\"#bib13\">McGhee et al., 1983</a>), these results directly support the hypothesis that chromatinization is a key deterrent for preventing the assembly of IFI16 signaling platforms on self-dsDNA."

The oligomerization of IFI16 on under-chromatinized foreign DNA plays a key role not only in initiating inflammatory and antiviral responses, (<a href=\"#bib18\">Monroe et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Orzalli et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Kerur et al., 2011</a>), but also in regulating the hetero-chromatinization and silencing of viral dsDNA (<a href=\"#bib6\">Johnson et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Orzalli et al., 2013</a>). By using time-resolved bulk and single-molecule fluorescence assays, we demonstrate here that IFI16 ID scans along exposed dsDNA to assemble into distinct clusters and that chromatinization is sufficient to inhibit IFI16 from targeting host dsDNA for assembly. In\u00a0vivo, this 1D scanning mechanism allows a limited number of IFI16 molecules to allocate each other on large genomes of invading pathogens. In combination with 3D sampling of binding sites on a collapsed DNA molecule, this process optimizes the oligomerization and downstream signaling time. While the clustering on dsDNA presents a tempting explanation for the role of IFI16 in viral gene silencing, future in\u00a0vivo experiments await to test this. IFI16 belongs to the family of AIM2-like receptors, which include other nuclear and cytosolic foreign dsDNA-sensors. It will be interesting to determine whether and how these other related sensors use exposed dsDNA as a 1D 'digital ruler' to regulate their signaling platform assembly. This family of sensors is implicated in a number of autoimmune disorders (<a href=\"#bib17\">Mondini et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Choubey et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Gugliesi et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Smith and Jefferies, 2014</a>); how regulation of assembly is disrupted may provide insights into these afflictions."

The dead time between addition of IFI16 and the first measurement was 15-20\u00a0s. The final dsDNA molar-concentrations are at least sixfold higher than their determined binding constants by fluorescence anisotropy assays described in Morrone, et al.\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib19\">Morrone et al., 2014</a>), and the FRET ratio for each time point was calculated by dividing the acceptor emission (678 nm) by the donor emission (574 nm) (<a href=\"#bib19\">Morrone et al., 2014</a>)."

Consistent with previous studies from the Sohn lab, IFI16 binding to DNA requires large DNA fragments involving oligomers of IFI16. To examine the mechanism of assembly of the oligomers, they tracked single molecules of IFI16 on stretched DNA. They observed that IFI16 tracks along stretches of DNA and they interpret this as required for assembly of the oligomers. Addition of nucleosomes to the DNA at sufficiently high density prevented IFI16 from moving and oligomerizing."

I have one reservation. It is not clear from the presentation how the results demonstrate that scanning is required for the assembly of the oligomers versus just happening in parallel to cooperative binding. The text needs to better define the reasoning and interpretation of the results to allow this conclusion. This may be in part due to a lack of background of this reviewer, but manuscripts for <i>eLife</i> should be written for the general reader."

Through FRET kinetics analysis, the authors showed that IFI16 binds to dsDNA in a length dependent manner (which was also reported in their earlier paper, Morrone et al., PNAS 2014), and drew the conclusion that 10 protomers are necessary to form the stable filament nucleus. They then used TIRF microscopy to show that IFI16 can diffuse on DNA under flow and proposed that this facilitates filament assembly and DNA length measurement. The authors also used the nucleosome coated DNA to show that IFI16 can only diffuse within the nucleosome-free region of DNA, and proposed that the nucleosome structure limits its filament assembly on self DNA."

The authors observed the assembly rate increases with the DNA length but plateaus around ~200 bp. Since the authors clearly showed that IFI16 can diffuse far beyond 200 bp (&gt;2-3 kb), this observation cannot explain the observed saturation at ~200 bp. On the other hand, this can be simply explained by the requirement of ~10 protomers to form a stable filament, as suggested by the authors. Note that there are proteins that form filaments in a nucleic acid length-dependent manner but without 1D diffusion. If diffusion is important for filament assembly, there should be a length dependence beyond 200 bp, especially at low protein concentration where the 3D diffusion-mediated filament assembly is significantly compromised. Again, without kinetic modeling that clearly shows the inconsistency with 3D diffusion and requirement for 1D diffusion, it is hard to arrive at the same conclusion as the authors."

I understand that this is required to visualize diffusion (as you need to stretch the DNA), but this makes diffusion mostly uni-directional, and could likely affect the scanning processivity and the contribution of diffusion to filament assembly efficiency. More importantly, long DNA (perhaps those of viral DNA) collapses in the absence of flow, in which case 3D diffusion (or hopping), in comparison to 1D diffusion, could be more important for the filament assembly."

The study focuses on the nuclear DNA sensor IFI16, the interferon inducible protein 16. The authors used fluorescence assays to investigate the binding of IFI16 to foreign dsDNA, first measuring the number of IFI16 molecules necessary for assembly. Using single-molecule fluorescence imaging, the authors go on to monitor the diffusion of IFI16 along lambda-phage dsDNA. Lastly, as chromatinization was previously proposed as a critical contributor to the ability of IFI16 to distinguish between host and foreign dsDNA, the authors perform competition-binding assays and time-resolved fluorescent assays to gain further insight into the impact of chromatinization on pathogenic DNA sensing. Overall, this study elegantly incorporates fluorescence imaging assays to address current questions relevant to the initiation of intrinsic and innate immune responses. This study can have a broad impact on understanding mechanisms of host defense against nuclear-replicating DNA viruses."

This calculation relies on the important previous finding from this lab that the footprint of one IFI16 is ~15 bp (Morrone et al. 2014). The authors should clarify if this requires the binding of both HIN domains and if so, how they ensured in this new experiment that both HIN domains of IFI16 are simultaneously bound to the dsDNA. Can there be a circumstance in which a HIN-A domain of one IFI16 molecule and the HIN-B of another molecule bind to dsDNA? Would this interfere with the calculation of the necessary footprint?"

Is the scanning along the DNA substrate accomplished in a similar manner as a two-headed molecular motor? Are both HIN domains required for scanning? Should one of the HIN domains release its binding for the scanning to occur? Some of these questions are difficult to address and may be outside the scope of the current paper. However, one question that could be addressed and that would provide important mechanistic insight is how do the HIN-A and HIN-B domains behave individually? The authors could test this by performing the same studies with individual HIN-A or HIN-B domains. If the diffusion and dissociation behaviors of the individual domains change relative to the HIN-A/HIN-B construct, this may suggest that both domains are required for scanning."

Are the immobile clusters sufficient for triggering immune response? The authors could add to their Discussion to address these possibilities."

Consistent with previous studies from the Sohn lab, IFI16 binding to DNA requires large DNA fragments involving oligomers of IFI16. To examine the mechanism of assembly of the oligomers, they tracked single molecules of IFI16 on stretched DNA. They observed that IFI16 tracks along stretches of DNA and they interpret this as required for assembly of the oligomers. Addition of nucleosomes to the DNA at sufficiently high density prevented IFI16 from moving and oligomerizing. The scanning of IFI16 along DNA to assemble oligomers to initiate signaling for either innate responses or epigenetic silencing is an important observation. The definition of a mechanism by which IFI16 distinguishes between foreign and self DNA is an important result as well, so this is potentially an important piece of work for the field. I have one reservation. It is not clear from the presentation how the results demonstrate that scanning is required for the assembly of the oligomers versus just happening in parallel to cooperative binding. The text needs to better define the reasoning and interpretation of the results to allow this conclusion. This may be in part due to a lack of background of this reviewer, but manuscripts for eLife should be written for the general reader.</i> "

The authors observed the assembly rate increases with the DNA length but plateaus around ~200 bp. Since the authors clearly showed that IFI16 can diffuse far beyond 200 bp (&gt;2-3 kb), this observation cannot explain the observed saturation at ~200 bp. On the other hand, this can be simply explained by the requirement of ~10 protomers to form a stable filament, as suggested by the authors. Note that there are proteins that form filaments in a nucleic acid length-dependent manner but without 1D diffusion. If diffusion is important for filament assembly, there should be a length dependence beyond 200 bp, especially at low protein concentration where the 3D diffusion-mediated filament assembly is significantly compromised. Again, without kinetic modeling that clearly shows the inconsistency with 3D diffusion and requirement for 1D diffusion, it is hard to arrive at the same conclusion as the authors.</i> "

While it is true that a minimum of ~200 bp is needed to provide sufficient space to form a stable oligomer, it is not necessarily true that a further increase in length would further speed up the reaction kinetics. After all, lengthening DNA would also increase the average distance between neighboring proteins bound to DNA, and thus slow down their association via 1D diffusion [5]. We would like to point out two papers that we published in the last month addressing this particular issue. One of these papers [6] studies the association kinetics of two DNA-sliding entities and finds no strong DNA-length dependence. A theoretical paper [7] describes an analytical model based on a mean-field kinetic description of linear extended sinks (representing DNA) that can trap molecules present in a solution. The model presented there accurately describes the observed independence of reaction rate on DNA length and further demonstrates that the major contribution to association kinetics is one- dimensional sliding. While we agree with the reviewer that the data mentioned above alone cannot positively confirm the importance of a scanning component, it also cannot be used to exclude such a contribution."
