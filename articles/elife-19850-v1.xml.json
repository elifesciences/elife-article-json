However, it is not well understood how the various actin assemblies in a cell are kept in a dynamic equilibrium, in particular when cells have to respond to acute signals. Here, we characterize a rapid and transient actin reset in response to increased intracellular calcium levels. Within seconds of calcium influx, the formin INF2 stimulates filament polymerization at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), while cortical actin is disassembled. The reaction is then reversed within a few minutes. This Calcium-mediated actin reset (CaAR) occurs in a wide range of mammalian cell types and in response to many physiological cues. CaAR leads to transient immobilization of organelles, drives reorganization of actin during cell cortex repair, cell spreading and wound healing, and induces long-lasting changes in gene expression. Our findings suggest that CaAR acts as fundamental facilitator of cellular adaptations in response to acute signals and stress."

However, it is not well understood how the various actin assemblies in a cell are kept in a dynamic equilibrium, in particular when cells have to respond to acute signals. Here, we characterize a rapid and transient actin reset in response to increased intracellular calcium levels. Within seconds of calcium influx, the formin INF2 stimulates filament polymerization at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), while cortical actin is disassembled. The reaction is then reversed within a few minutes. This Calcium-mediated actin reset (CaAR) occurs in a wide range of mammalian cell types and in response to many physiological cues. CaAR leads to transient immobilization of organelles, drives reorganization of actin during cell cortex repair, cell spreading and wound healing, and induces long-lasting changes in gene expression. Our findings suggest that CaAR acts as fundamental facilitator of cellular adaptations in response to acute signals and stress."

The cortex is constructed using a protein called actin, and many of these proteins join together to form each fiber. When cells need to adapt rapidly to an injury or other sudden changes in their environment they activate a so-called stress response. This response often begins with a rapid increase in the amount of calcium ions inside a cell, which can then trigger changes in actin organization. However, it is not clear how cells under stress are able to globally remodel their actin cytoskeleton without compromising stability and integrity of the cortex."

Wales, Schuberth, Aufschnaiter et al. termed this response calcium-mediated actin reset (CaAR), as it lasted for only a few minutes before the actin cortex reformed. The experiments show that a protein called INF2 controls CaAR by rapidly removing actin from the cortex and forming new filaments near a cell compartment called the endoplasmic reticulum."

The prominent role of the actin cytoskeleton is reflected in a host of regulators that mediate dynamic assembly of complex actin structures from filament bundles and networks. These structures in turn provide protrusive and contractile forces during physiological and pathological processes such as differentiation, wound healing and tumor metastasis (<a href=\"#bib27\">Lecuit et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Pantaloni et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Pollard and Cooper, 2009</a>). While many studies in the past have focused on the molecular characterization of specific actin assemblies and their local function within cells, recent work has elegantly shown that a balance between different actin assemblies is established in cells by distinct actin nucleators. These nucleators constantly compete for a common pool of actin monomers (<a href=\"#bib7\">Burke et al., 2014</a>), and the balance between actin assemblies can be tightly controlled by regulatory factors such as profilin (<a href=\"#bib42\">Rotty et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Suarez et al., 2015</a>). In addition, cellular F- and G-actin levels have been linked to profound and long-lasting changes in cell physiology through regulation of transcriptional cofactors such as myocardin-related transcription factors (MRTF), the Yes-associated protein (YAP) or transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) (<a href=\"#bib18\">Halder et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Miralles et al., 2003</a>). Finally, the rapidly expanding field of mechanobiology has highlighted global integration of actomyosin-mediated forces across the cortex of single cells (<a href=\"#bib24\">Klingner et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Salbreux et al., 2012</a>), as well as within cell groups and whole tissues (<a href=\"#bib27\">Lecuit et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Trepat et al., 2012</a>)."

This is exemplified by the impact of moderate perturbations of the cortical actin cytoskeleton with low doses of latrunculin, which can result in a massive imbalance of actomyosin-mediated forces and lead to large-scale fluctuations in cell cortex organization (<a href=\"#bib24\">Klingner et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Luo et al., 2013</a>). How cells globally coordinate actin remodeling during rapid and profound morphological transitions has not been sufficiently addressed. Shear flow has been shown to induce rapid changes in cellular actin organization and mechanics (<a href=\"#bib39\">Rahimzadeh et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Verma et al., 2012</a>). In addition, a recent study reported calcium-mediated rapid and transient formation of actin filaments at the nuclear periphery of fibroblasts exposed to mechanical stress (<a href=\"#bib47\">Shao et al., 2015</a>). However, how these observations can be linked to cell cortex organization and overall cell physiology is not known."

This global change in actin distribution is rapidly reversed within less than two minutes. Calcium-mediated Actin Reset (CaAR) occurs in a wide range of mammalian cell types and is initiated by a variety of physiological signals. Most importantly, we found that CaAR acts as a fundamental facilitator of acute cell responses. It is required for repair of cortical damage and coordinates the\u00a0formation of actin-rich protrusions during cell spreading and cell migration. In addition, CaAR induces long-term changes in gene expression via MRTF and serum response factor (SRF). Our results have important implications for a multitude of experiments where cells are exposed to acute stress as well as for calcium-regulated processes such as wound healing, inflammation, cell differentiation and cancer progression."

Prior to shear stress, MDCK cells stably expressing Lifeact-GFP exhibited a typical apical actin organization with clustered microvilli (<a href=\"#bib24\">Klingner et al., 2014</a>). Immediately upon exposure to fluid flow of 10\u201320 dyn/cm<sup>2</sup> we observed the\u00a0formation of a highly transient perinuclear actin ring, which only remained for a few minutes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). A similar phenomenon was recently reported in fibroblasts (<a href=\"#bib47\">Shao et al., 2015</a>), but its consequences for cell organization were not further explored. To establish the reported relevance of calcium (<a href=\"#bib47\">Shao et al., 2015</a>) for the actin reorganization in MDCK cells, we monitored Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels with the fluorescent probe Fluo-4. Upon induction of shear stress, actin reorganization was preceded by a strong intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> pulse (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>). To examine whether the elevation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels is causally linked to actin reorganization, we treated MDCK cells with the calcium ionophore ionomycin. Indeed, exposure to as little as 0.3 \u00b5M ionomycin induced the formation of perinuclear actin rings and reduction of cortical actin within 60 s (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Interestingly, in contrast to the previous report, we found a virtually simultaneous decrease of actin filaments at the apical cortex (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). As for the transient shear stress response, actin rapidly reverted to its cortical distribution within the following 60 s (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). To test the prevalence of calcium-mediated actin reorganization, we stably or transiently expressed Lifeact-GFP in a panel of mammalian cell lines, including epithelial, mesenchymal, endothelial and immune cells, and treated each with ionomycin. In all instances, rapid relocation of actin from the cell cortex to the nuclear periphery occurred within 60 s (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>, <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). We observed the strongest response for human MCF-7 breast cancer cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>) and therefore decided to focus on this cell line for further studies. Actin reorganization in MCF-7 cells was not influenced by Lifeact-GFP expression, as we observed an identical response in non-transfected cells stained with Alexa Fluor 647-phalloidin (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Importantly, we found that, upon calcium influx, actin filaments formed not only at the nuclear periphery, but throughout the cell (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>) and all along the endoplasmic reticulum (ER, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). If cytosolic calcium is the key regulator of rapid actin reorganization, we reasoned that other signals that induced sufficient Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx should be able to elicit the actin response. As expected, activation of calcium influx using physiological ligands for G-protein-coupled receptors, such as ATP or bradykinin efficiently induced actin rearrangement (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). In most cells release of calcium from ER stores activates store-operated calcium entry from the extracellular environment (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hogan and Rao, 2015</a>). Hence, blocking uptake of Ca<sup>2+</sup> into the ER with thapsigargin - in the presence of high extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> - also induced actin rearrangement (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). Finally, perforation of the plasma membrane by localized mechanical disruption (atomic force microscopy, AFM) or laser-induced ablation efficiently induced cortex to ER actin reorganization (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>)."

In all cell types that we tested, CaAR was initiated within seconds after Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a> and not shown). Actin concentration at the ER reached its maximum within less than 1 min and reverted back to the original state within less than 5 min. Actin recruitment to the ER followed a typical three-phase kinetics characterized by a rapid increase, a plateau and a slower decrease (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). We considered serum-starved (for 1 hr) MCF-7 cells treated with 330 nM ionomycin at RT as a\u00a0control condition. The actin increase at the ER was significantly faster for cells grown in serum or at 37\u00b0C. Also, the\u00a0stimulation of MCF-7 and HeLa cells with 50 \u00b5M ATP led to faster increase than for ionomycin (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). In contrast, addition of serum or ATP had little effect on the rate of decrease or the amplitude of the reaction (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Finally, the CaAR plateau was shortened at 37\u00b0C, for cells grown in serum and upon stimulation with ATP (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Treatment of HeLa cells with ionomycin induced very strong and long-lasting CaAR response (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), indicating that these cells could not as efficiently remove Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the cytosol. Most importantly, despite the specific differences described above, all kinetic parameters of CaAR remained within a three-fold range (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), highlighting the robust and stereotypic nature of the response."

We found that cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in MCF-7 cells increased 2- to 4-fold upon exposure to ionomycin (3.59\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.84 fold, n\u00a0=\u00a031) or ATP (2.82\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.67 fold, n\u00a0=\u00a054), which induced CaAR in virtually all cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Induction of CaAR was completely prevented in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free medium, but could be restored within 1 min by addition of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (not shown). In Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free medium, release of calcium from ER stores with thapsigargin could not be enhanced by store-operated calcium entry and led to a modest cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> increase of 1.26\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.08 fold (n\u00a0=\u00a031). This was insufficient to induce CaAR (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). These results indicate that CaAR induction requires a threshold level of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> that can only be reached by influx from the extracellular environment."

We therefore used atomic force microscopy (AFM) to probe cells with 10 \u00b5m beads attached to the cantilever. Despite the observed transient reduction of cortical actin, we found that the subcortical regions (800 nm below the plasma membrane) of MCF-7 cells treated with ionomycin became markedly stiffer during CaAR, mirroring greater levels of actin recruitment at the ER (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). In addition, we observed that intracellular motility of organelles was transiently halted during CaAR. Random as well as directed motion of lysosomes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>), mitochondria and the ER network (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>) was abolished within a few seconds of CaAR onset and resumed after actin returned to the cell cortex (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E,F</a>). When simultaneously observing CaAR and lysosome motility we found the organelles trapped within a cytosol-filling actin mesh that corresponded to the transient ER-based actin filaments (<a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a>). Lysosomes were also immobilized in cells treated with 50 \u00b5M blebbistatin arguing against a prominent role of actomyosin contractility for organelle freezing (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>)."

Forces above 50 nN (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>) were able to robustly induce CaAR multiple times in a single cell (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>, <a href=\"#media5\">Video 5</a>) with a refractory period of 30\u201360 s (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>), consistent with the time scale of actin recruitment at the ER. When using localized CaAR stimulation by AFM we frequently observed that cells directly adjacent to the manipulated cells also reacted (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). To examine this behavior in more detail, we performed ablation experiments on MCF-7 monolayers. Strikingly, we found that nearly all cells within 60\u2013150 \u00b5m of the ablation site exhibited CaAR (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a>). This was also observed for cells that were not in direct contact with the ablated cell (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1F</a>, <a href=\"#media6\">Video 6</a>). Previous reports have shown that Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals can be propagated across tissue sections and cell layers via ATP (<a href=\"#bib15\">Frame and de Feijter, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Schwiebert, 2000</a>). Indeed, distant cells were no longer able to respond to cell ablation after the medium had been saturated with 100 \u00b5M ATP (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2I</a>), indicating that ATP release and associated Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx is responsible for the propagation of CaAR."

                                "text": "The rapid increase in actin localization at the ER indicated the involvement of a strong nucleator in CaAR. Accordingly, both G-actin sequestration by latrunculin A (LatA) and actin filament disruption by cytochalasin D (CytoD) completely blocked CaAR (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, <a href=\"#media7\">Video 7</a>). The only actin nucleator that has been shown to be localized at the ER is inverted formin 2 (INF2) (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chhabra and Higgs, 2006</a>), and this nucleator has also been shown to mediate the\u00a0formation of perinuclear actin filaments in 3T3 fibroblasts (<a href=\"#bib47\">Shao et al., 2015</a>). Indeed, in MCF-7 and HeLa cells, INF2 was localized to the ER, as shown either by immunofluorescence (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>) or when expressing the full-length INF2-CAAX isoform fused to GFP (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). A constitutively active point mutant of INF2 (A149D, (<a href=\"#bib25\">Korobova et al., 2013</a>) induced the previously shown strong actin staining at the ER (<a href=\"#bib40\">Ramabhadran et al., 2013</a>), which was not further increased by the\u00a0addition of ionomycin (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). To test a potential role of INF2 for CaAR we knocked down INF2 expression by RNA interference. While our attempts for INF2 knock down were unsuccessful in MCF-7 cells, we were able to efficiently abolish expression of INF2 in HeLa cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). Strikingly, CaAR was completely blocked in HeLa cells that were depleted for INF2 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). This was especially apparent in areas where some cells still retained INF2 expression and therefore were still able to nucleate actin at the ER upon treatment with ionomycin (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>, circled area). Notably, INF2 knock-down also blocked actin decrease at the cell cortex (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>), increase in cell stiffness detected by AFM (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>) and freezing of organelle motility (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>. To obtain stable cell lines without INF2 expression we knocked out INF2 using the CRSPR/Cas9 system. We obtained several independent HeLa INF2-KO clones that exhibited no detectable INF2 expression by Western blot (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). We then transiently expressed either the CAAX- or nonCAAX human isoform of INF2 in clone 18 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>). Upon induction of CaAR by laser ablation we observe no reaction in untransfected cells confirming that INF2 is essential for CaAR. Interestingly, both isoforms were able to rescue the knock out and to support efficient CaAR reactions (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>), indicating that ER-localization was not essential for actin reorganization."

                                "text": "Two remarkable characteristics of CaAR are the reciprocal behavior of actin at the ER and the cell cortex and the highly transient nature of the reorganization (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Interestingly, INF2 is not only an actin nucleator and elongator, but also a very potent severing and actin-depolymerizing factor (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chhabra and Higgs, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Gurel et al., 2014</a>). During CaAR, these activities should also be subject to regulation by calcium and therefore potentially facilitate the observed reciprocal and transient reaction. It is important to note that CaAR does not lead to the equal reduction of all cortical actin structures. Stable actin assemblies such as stress fibers were much less affected (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>, <a href=\"#media8\">Video 8</a>). Also, despite their opposite slopes, there was no apparent delay between ER and cell cortex reactions and they followed the calcium signal with the same offset (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). In addition, the duration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx was directly correlated with the kinetics of actin reorganization at both locations (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). These observations indicate that the actin filament assembly and disassembly at the ER and cell cortex are tightly coupled. A potential mechanism for such coupling would be simple competition between different actin nucleators. To test whether such a scenario could account for the observed CaAR kinetics, we developed a particle-based stochastic model of actin dynamics that explicitly considers actin nucleation, polymerization, depolymerization, capping and severing (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, Materials and Methods). We initially focused on a single actin population in equilibrium with the monomer pool. The model showed that actin turnover is mainly determined by the speed of actin depolymerization and modulated to a lesser extent by the rates of capping and severing (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). In addition, actin turnover was strongly dependent on the levels of actin monomers available (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). The experimentally measured <i>t</i><sub>1/2</sub> for recovery of actin-GFP at the cortex of MCF-7 cells was quite fast, at 14.48\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.21 s (n\u00a0=\u00a079). This constrained the possible values for severing, depolymerization and ratios of F- to G-actin (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1D,E</a>). We next included a second nucleation activity to represent INF2-mediated actin polymerization at the ER (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). By assuming that INF2 activity follows the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> curve (See Materials and Methods), we were able to generate a transient actin peak at the ER with a corresponding decrease at the cortex (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). By increasing the INF2 nucleation rate or the amount of available G-actin in the system we were able to obtain kinetics that were reasonably close to the experimental observations (dotted curves in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). However, cortical actin never dropped below 50% of its original value, and we were unable to obtain complete reorganization of actin within less than 30 s, as seen with laser ablation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Interestingly, the model predicted that including Ca<sup>2+</sup>- or INF2-dependent actin depolymerization into the model strongly increased the amplitude and speed of actin reorganization at both cortex and ER (solid curves in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). To experimentally test this prediction we measured CaAR kinetics in HeLa KO cells expressing a WH2-mutant of INF2 (3L: L976A, L977A, L986A) that was reported to have strongly reduced depolymerization activity (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chhabra and Higgs, 2006</a>). Strikingly CaAR kinetics were strongly reduced in cells expressing the 3L mutant. The resulting changes were comparable to the situation without Ca<sup>2+</sup>-mediated depolymerization predicted by the model (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D,E</a>). The amplitude and the speed of reorganization were strongly reduced for both, ER and cell cortex (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F,G</a>)."

                                "text": "A very sensitive readout for an increased F/G actin ratio in cells is the release of transcriptional regulators, such as the serum response factor (SRF) co-factor MRTF-A, from sequestration in the cytosol (<a href=\"#bib30\">Miralles et al., 2003</a>). Indeed, we found that within a minute of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and CaAR onset, MRTF-A translocated into the nucleus in\u00a0&gt;95% of MCF-7 cells, and remained there for up to 30 min (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>). MRTF-A translocation also occurred in HeLa cells and was blocked upon INF2 knock-down (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). When we blocked CaAR by treatment with LatA, MRTF-A translocation was also inhibited (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). In contrast, treatment with CytoD induced CaAR-independent translocation of MRTF-A (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>), consistent with previous reports (<a href=\"#bib13\">Descot et al., 2009</a>). We next tested whether CaAR-induced translocation of MRTF-A indeed caused SRF-mediated transcription. RNA levels of two known SRF targets, CTGF and NR4R3, were strongly increased upon CaAR induction by ionomycin, reaching a maximum at 1 hr (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). We selected this time point for the analysis of CaAR-mediated changes in gene transcription. We treated MCF-7 cells with 1.5 \u00b5M ionomycin for 10 min after pre-incubation for 10 min with either LatA, CytoD or control buffer. After washout of the drugs and ionophore, we cultured the cells for another 50 min in 4-thio-uridine and collected newly synthesized mRNA (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>). We found that a 10 min pulse of ionomycin was sufficient to decrease the expression of 478 genes and enhance the expression of 405 genes by more than 1.5 fold (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 5\u2014source data 2</a>). Treatment with LatA on its own had very little effect, but upregulation of 88 ionomycin-induced genes was strongly inhibited by LatA (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 5\u2014source datas 1</a> and <a href=\"#SD2-data\">2</a>). Nearly half of these genes are known SRF targets and about one third were also induced by the SRF activator CytoD (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>). In agreement with the reported functions of SRF, many of the identified transcriptional changes were associated with genes involved in cytoskeletal organization, calcium regulation, cell signaling and regulation of cell adhesion (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>). More than 60% of the CaAR-regulated genes have been associated with cancer and more than one-third have been implicated in cellular stress responses, cell differentiation, cell migration or inflammation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>). SRF is known to respond to actin changes mediated through Rho GTPases (<a href=\"#bib51\">Treisman et al., 1998</a>). However, we found that CaAR-mediated induction of CTGF was not affected by the ROCK inhibitor Y27632, the calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporin A (CsA) or by the CaM kinase inhibitors KN62 and KN93 (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). Importantly, all CaAR transcriptome experiments were performed in serum-starved cells and addition of serum did not induce CaAR in MCF-7 cells. In addition, treatment of cells with Y27632, the Rho1 inhibitor C3 transferase or with CsA did not affect CaAR (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). Our results therefore indicate that CaAR mediates SRF activation through actin reorganization, but via a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent pathway distinct from the previously described SRF activation involving Rho, ROCK and mDia (<a href=\"#bib3\">Baarlink et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Copeland and Treisman, 2002</a>)."

                                "text": "We next wanted to understand the physiological consequences of transient actin reorganization during CaAR. When we examined the cellular consequences of CaAR in laser ablation experiments with HeLa cells, we observed accumulation of actin at the site of membrane damage in more than 90% of the cases (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, <a href=\"#media9\">Video 9</a>). This accumulation was reminiscent of previously observed wound repair processes (<a href=\"#bib11\">Clark et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">McNeil, 2002</a>) and typically occurred after completion of CaAR (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Upon knock-down of INF2, HeLa cells did not undergo CaAR and were also completely unable to recruit actin to the site of membrane wounding (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Importantly, membrane damage as measured by uptake of propidium iodide or FM4-64 was repaired within a few seconds of damage induction (not shown). Actin accumulation was therefore not required for membrane sealing but for a later step in wound repair, possibly cortex reassembly. Such repair mechanisms should be especially relevant for terminally differentiated cells that can no longer be replaced in vivo, such as podocytes (<a href=\"#bib34\">Pavenst\u00e4dt et al., 2003</a>). We therefore examined CaAR in <i>in vitro</i> differentiated human AB8 podocytes (<a href=\"#bib44\">Saleem et al., 2002</a>). Similar to our observations in HeLa cells, laser ablation at the periphery of podocytes induced CaAR and led to subsequent actin accumulation at the wounding site, which was then efficiently sealed without apparent loss of cellular integrity (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>, <a href=\"#media10\">Video 10</a>). Interestingly, actin accumulation at the wound was accompanied by simultaneous induction of lamellipodia in the immediate vicinity (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). In both cell types examined above, the strong accumulation of actin at cortical wounding sites occurred right after completion of CaAR. Similarly, when we extended the period of observation in MCF-7 cells that had undergone CaAR upon ATP exposure, we found that they initiated extended basal protrusions that correlated with the end CaAR. Protrusions emanating from cell-cell junctions collapsed after only 5\u201310 min, but those appearing at free cell edges persisted for up to 1 hr (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>, <a href=\"#media11\">Video 11</a>). To study this phenomenon in more detail we ablated a single MCF-7 cell in a monolayer. CaAR was efficiently induced in all surrounding cells and we again observed short-lived protrusions at cell-cell junctions and longer-lived protrusions at free cell edges (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>, <a href=\"#media12\">Video 12</a>). In addition, some cells formed large lamellipodia, which rapidly closed the gap left by the ablated cell (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>). Considering the extended activation of cell spreading and cellular protrusion after CaAR we wondered whether this would have noticeable consequences for collective migration in a typical wound healing setting. We therefore observed MCF-7 monolayers migrating into a free area after removal of a PDMS spacer (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). After 12 hr, untreated cells had moved in to the gap with an average speed of 3 \u00b5m/h, while cells migrating in the presence of 50 \u00b5M ATP (and therefore exhibiting CaAR at the onset of the experiment) covered a much larger area with an average speed of 7 \u00b5m/h (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). A more detailed analysis revealed that ATP treatment led to an acceleration for the initial 4 hr of migration and that cells then reverted to the speed of control cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>, <a href=\"#media13\">Video 13</a>). Our findings clearly show that ATP-mediated calcium influx and CaAR are associated with prolonged activation of protrusion and collective migration of MCF-7 cells. As we were not yet able to remove INF2 from MCF-7 cells, we cannot exclude at this time that the observed effects on protrusion could be due to a CaAR-independent effect of ATP."

How calcium signaling is linked to cellular morphogenesis is less well understood. Interestingly, a recent study reported formation of a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent perinuclear actin ring in 3T3 fibroblasts (<a href=\"#bib47\">Shao et al., 2015</a>). We have now found that increased intracellular calcium levels lead to transient and global reorganization of actin in a wide range of epithelial, mesenchymal, endothelial and hematopoietic cell lines. This reorganization can be triggered by various mechanical and biochemical signals and is characterized by simultaneous actin polymerization at the ER and disassembly of cortical actin filaments. The ubiquity, sensitivity and conserved features of the observed Calcium-mediated Actin Reset (CaAR, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>) indicate that this is a fundamental response of mammalian cells. In agreement with this idea, we found that CaAR can act as a morphogenetic integrator during acute cellular perturbations, such as cell cortex damage and wound healing."

Our stochastic model for CaAR shows that the extent and speed of actin reorganization at the cortex and ER can only be achieved if Ca<sup>2+</sup> simultaneously increases the rate of nucleation at the ER and the overall rate of actin depolymerization. Interestingly, the key regulator of CaAR, INF2, is a unique molecule that can at the same time stimulate actin nucleation, elongation, severing and depolymerization (<a href=\"#bib16\">Gurel et al., 2015</a>). We could validate our theoretical prediction, using a mutant INF2 with reduced depolymerization activity. Expression of this mutant in INF2 KO cells supported CaAR at much slower kinetics and reduced turnover. Ca<sup>2+</sup>-mediated activation of INF2 could therefore account for all the experimentally observed kinetics. How then does calcium regulate INF2? We have found that INF2 binds to calmodulin, a highly abundant cellular regulator of calcium signaling. It will be interesting to test whether the calmodulin-INF2 interaction occurs directly, or via additional adaptor proteins such as IQGAP1. This protein has recently been shown to bind INF2 (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bartolini et al., 2016</a>) and is a known interactor of calmodulin (<a href=\"#bib23\">Jang et al., 2011</a>)."

We have found that CaAR provides an alternative, INF2-mediated, mechanism for MRTF activation. Interestingly, although CaAR is independent of both Rho and serum, we find a strong overlap between CaAR-regulated and classical serum-induced genes. Many of the CaAR-induced genes are associated with cytoskeletal organization, cell adhesion or signaling. This suggests a possible integration of transcriptional changes with the observed morphological effects of CaAR on actin protrusions, cortex repair and cell migration."

Considering its basic constituents (calcium, actin), this process likely influences a multitude of signaling pathways and physiological processes. Thus, the observed consequences of CaAR should be considered when studying cellular perturbations that are linked to Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. The strong association of CaAR-induced genes with cancer, inflammation and stress point to exciting opportunities for future studies of CaAR in living organisms. Of particular note is a potential role of CaAR in kidney pathology, as INF2 is known to regulate actin dynamics in podocytes, and INF2 mutations are linked to hereditary kidney diseases (<a href=\"#bib6\">Brown et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Sun et al., 2013</a>)."

All experiments were performed using a Nanowizard III AFM (JPK Instruments, Berlin, Germany) integrated into a TCS SP8 confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany). Gold-coated MSCT cantilevers with spherical (10 \u00b5m) polystyrene probes (Novascan, Ames, IA; USA) with a nominal spring constant of 0.01 pN/nm were used to quantify cell elasticity. Force-distance curves were acquired with a z-length of 2.5 \u00b5m at a tip velocity of 1 \u00b5m/s and a retracted delay of 1 s (~1 force distance curve per 6 s). At a loading force of 0.75 nN the cantilever reached a maximal indentation of 1 \u00b5m (<a href=\"#bib8\">Carl and Schillers, 2008</a>). Elasticity was measured as Young\u2019s modulus based on Sneddon's model of nanoindentation using Protein Unfolding and Nano-Indentation Software (PUNIAS, <a href=\"http://punias.voila.net\">http://punias.voila.net</a>). The last 200 nm of the force distance curve was analyzed to quantify the elasticity of the cell cytoplasm. All elasticity measurements were performed at RT. For all cell perforation experiments, Multi75-G Cantilevers (BudgetSensors, Sofia, Bulgaria) with spring constants ranging from 2.5 to 3.5 N/m were used. Cells were stimulated by placing the cantilever tip in the center of the nuclear area and indenting them with a speed of 1 \u00b5m/s. To determine the force threshold for CaAR induction, maximum loading forces ranging from 5 nN to 50 nN were used. To study repeated CaAR induction, cells were indented ten times with a maximum loading force of 50 nN and variable pauses between single indentations. Fluorescence images were acquired with a 63x HC PL APO CS2 oil immersion objective (NA\u00a0=\u00a01.4) and hybrid detection system for photon counting (Leica HD\u2122). Z-stacks of cells (distance 500 nm) were taken every 30 s. All confocal fluorescence images were analyzed and processed using Fiji. Fluorescence intensity was measured in unprocessed images.

We therefore considered two populations of polymerized actin (F-actin) coupled to a common pool of actin monomers (G-actin, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). We assumed that the available G-actin, characterized by the equivalent length <i>L</i><sub>G</sub> of actin into which it can potentially polymerize, is homogeneously distributed in the cytoplasm. F-actin populations at the cortex and ER were modeled as ensembles of individual filaments. The state of these populations is characterized by their respective total lengths of polymerized actin, <i>L</i><sub>C</sub> and <i>L</i><sub>ER</sub>. Initially, we consider the cortical population in steady-state equilibrium with the G-actin pool. Nucleation at the ER is then activated and regulated by the calcium influx signal. The ER-mediated decrease in monomer availability in turn reduces polymerization at the cortex. Ongoing actin turnover will then drive cortical actin disassembly. When the calcium signal has dissipated, nucleation at the ER stops and ER actin disassembles. This restores the G-actin pool, allowing cortical actin to recover again."

Since the average uncapping time is much longer than the lifetime of a filament in the cell (<a href=\"#bib35\">Pollard et al., 2000</a>), we assumed that a capped filament depolymerizes from its shrinking pointed end until it is completely disassembled. We allow severing of a filament uniformly along its length, with a rate <math id=\"inf6\"><mrow><msub><mi>r</mi><mi>s</mi></msub></mrow></math> per unit of length. We assumed that the severing protein immediately caps the resulting barbed end, so that the lagging actin filament is always shrinking.

Each actin filament is a particle characterized by its length, lifetime and state (growing or shrinking). Capping, severing and nucleation are stochastic events, while growth and shrinking are deterministic events. The program tracks the time evolution of the respective population lengths in the coupled cortex / G-actin / ER system. The total available actin in the system <i>L</i><sub>T</sub> is fixed and it is set to be completely monomeric at the start of the simulation. Using the selected model rates, the cortical population is then allowed to evolve until it is in equilibrium with the G-actin pool. In this pre-stimulus steady state, a calcium signal is then initiated at time <i>t</i>\u00a0=\u00a00, which activates actin nucleation at the ER and drives the system out of equilibrium. The simulation then runs until the cortical actin again reaches a steady state after the ER population has disappeared. <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a> summarizes the program input parameters. The values shown are either taken from the literature or estimated to simulate a physiologically relevant system. It is important to note that we only specify the saturation maxima of nucleation rates and polymerization velocity. The actual simulation values varied as a function of <i>L</i><sub>T</sub> to determine the pre-stimulus steady state of the cortical population. The growth maximum <math id=\"inf15\"><mrow><msubsup><mi>v</mi><mi>g</mi><mi>M</mi></msubsup></mrow></math> was chosen such that even profilin-accelerated elongation rates (<a href=\"#bib37\">Pollard, 1986</a>) could be accounted for when considering cellular G-actin concentrations (<a href=\"#bib35\">Pollard et al., 2000</a>) and filament geometry (<a href=\"#bib14\">dos Remedios et al., 2003</a>). The nucleation rate for the cortical population was estimated to obtain the\u00a0amounts of polymerized actin in the range of experimental observations. Approximate capping and severing rates were taken from the literature. The cross-over length scale <i>L</i><sub>s</sub> was freely chosen and total available actin in the system <i>L</i><sub>T</sub> was given in <i>L</i><sub>s</sub> units."

Using a mean-field description for this pre-stimulus system, a set of equations can be written describing the evolution of filament length density. Using the steady-state solution of this mean-field model, we find expressions for observables, such as filament number, actin turnover and cortical length, as a function of the steady-state size of the monomer pool. It can be shown that the total actin length for this system is conserved, which leads to a self-consistent equation for the steady-state G-actin length. With this solution, analytical observables for given model parameters can be compared to time-averaged values from simulations. We used this analytical model to validate our stochastic simulations. We studied the behavior of the steady-state as a function of different model parameters. In particular, we looked at the turnover time and the ratio of polymerized to monomeric (F/G) actin. The turnover time reflects how dynamic the cortical actin is and how fast it can reorganize. Since the amount of actin is conserved in the system, the steady-state F/G actin ratio reflects how limiting the monomer pool is when a competing F-actin population emerges."

The simulation results for the turnover time and the F/G ratio for <i>L</i><sub>T</sub> = [0.5\u201350.0] <i>L</i><sub>s</sub> are shown in <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>. If the available actin is limited, actin polymerization cannot overcome depolymerization, resulting in a low F/G ratio. For very large G-actin pools, nucleation rate and growth velocity approach constant values. The total cortical length therefore has an upper limit and surplus actin monomers only serve to decrease the F/G ratio. We found that there is a given amount of actin for which the fraction of polymerized actin in equilibrium is maximal, given a defined set of parameters. This maximal F/G ratio corresponds to the system with the smallest monomer pool and potentially with the fastest competition upon coupling with a second actin population at the ER. We therefore chose this case, with <i>L</i><sub>T</sub>\u00a0=\u00a04 <i>L</i><sub>s</sub>, to study the full model. The turnover time monotonically increases with <i>L</i><sub>T</sub>, with a saturation value corresponding to the saturation of growth speed. In our model the nucleation rate does not affect actin turnover. In steady state, the turnover time is equivalent to the time required for full polymerization of F-actin. The cortical half-time for the system with maximal F/G ratio is 12 s, which is in good agreement with half-times observed at the cortex for MCF-7 cells. This corresponds to a pre-stimulus system with 60% of actin in a polymerized state, which is consistent with published observations (<a href=\"#bib49\">Suarez et al., 2015</a>)."

As expected, the cortical actin length does indeed show a more pronounced decrease in comparison to the results for the pool-size competition only (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1E</a> middle panel). The greater synchronization of the transition for all simulated parameters (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1E</a> lower panel) provides further confirmation of the proposed mechanism. Even if competition for a limited pool of G-actin does have an impact on the transition, as seen in the small variations across runs, the strongest influence on the cortical reaction comes from the enhancement of the overall depolymerization velocity. It should be noted that, although this has only a slight effect on ER actin assembly, a high nucleation activity ensures that rates of actin polymerization at the ER remain high. Moreover, the high turnover in the cell keeps high levels of G-actin available for polymerization, which screens the disassembly effect at the ER as long as the calcium signal is sufficiently strong."

Introducing additional depolymerization acceleration clearly leads to a stronger and faster cortical decrease for any severing acceleration, as expected from the strong dependence of turnover on this parameter. This effect is greater for lower depolymerization since severing is length dependent. For a given value of <math id=\"inf41\"><mrow><msubsup><mi>v</mi><mrow><mtext>acc</mtext></mrow><mo>\u2212</mo></msubsup></mrow></math>, extra severing also promotes higher cortical disassembly and reduces the delay with respect to ER actin polymerization. Thus the effect of a five-fold increase in the depolymerization rate can also be achieved by combining a three-fold increase in depolymerization velocity with a seven-fold increase in the severing rate. The increase in depolymerization velocity could be further reduced to two-fold if the severing rate was increased 10-fold. However, the effect of increased severing saturates at high severing acceleration, so filament depolymerization is always needed to some extent. Thus, we see that the observed transition kinetics can be reproduced by simultaneously introducing a moderate increase in depolymerization velocity and a more pronounced enhancement of severing activity. This is consistent with a mechanism that both fragments actin into shorter filaments and enhances pointed end depolymerization."

The process is reversed after a short period of time, which is termed as Calcium-mediated actin reset (CaAR). This fast and reversible actin reorganization process has recently been characterized by Shao et al., 2015 in PNAS. In the current study, Wales et al. provide detailed quantification with high temporal resolution for this process, and also generate a computational model of actin homeostasis as the mechanistic basis for CaAR. Moreover, the authors expanded the understanding of this intriguing process by documenting the molecular and cellular responses after CaAR activation. It is interesting to know that CaAR precedes and plays an important role in wound healing, when the cell membrane is damaged by laser ablation. At a longer timescale, CaAR induces expression of certain set of genes, presumably important for cellular adaptation to the environmental stresses. This study is interesting and provides novel insights into our understanding of cell stress and actin dynamics."

This process, which they call \"Calcium-mediated actin reset\" is robust, relatively reproducible across cell types, rapid (seconds) and rapidly reversed (minutes). Importantly, the team shows that the process leads to an increase in actin filaments at ER and the nuclear envelope and a near-coincident decrease in cortical actin. Strikingly, both processes can be prevented by the silencing of INF2, an ER associated Formin in HeLa cells, suggesting that INF2 is responsible for the nucleation of the ER pool. Finally, they show that there is a longer term impact of this signalling on cells, leading to an INF2 dependent change in gene expression, which appears to be largely mediated via SRF as a result of the transient change in G/F actin levels. This may help to mediate longer term changes in F-actin organisation. Overall this is a very interesting finding that will interest a wide audience."

The presence of such cortical nucleators has been extensively documented in the past. In addition, we find that cortical actin returns at the time where INF2 activity is very low (no Ca<sup>2+</sup> left). Using CRSPR/Cas9 we have removed INF2 from HeLa cells and now show that cortical actin is not severely reduced by this (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>). We now also provide evidence that ER localization of INF2 is not required for CaAR (rescue of INF2 KO with cytosolic isoform, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>). Finally, in support of our competition model we have now included new results using rescue of the INF2 KO in HeLa cells with a depolymerization defective INF2 mutant (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E-G</a>).

As the strong effects on cell protrusions and cell migration will likely be interesting to a wide audience and provide interesting links to the long-term effects on transcription, we decided to retain these parts in the manuscript. As discussed in our response to reviewer 2 we clearly state the weaker link between CaAR and cellular protrusions (subsection \u201cCaAR mediates acute cellular reorganization\u201d, first paragraph) and reduced the emphasis on this aspect (removed Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1)."

Nucleation and competition for G-actin seem simpler explanations. Whilst the model may suggest a need for accelerated turnover, the authors don't have a great tool by which to test this since the treatments (e.g. INF2 RNAi) may affect one or both processes. But, it is hard to understand how ER-localized INF2 directly induces cortical actin turnover, while enabling the accumulation of actin at the ER. Finally, given that there is a LOSS of G actin, the increased actin turnover idea doesn\u2019t seem especially compelling.</i>"

These experiments have shown that cytosolic INF2 can also support CaAR and that the depolymerization activity of INF2 (residing in its WH2 domains) is essential to achieve the rapid and strong reorganization typical for CaAR (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E-G</a>). To keep our conclusion from the model simple, we now removed the aspects of synchrony between ER and cortex changes and on the involved G-actin levels, as suggested by the reviewer."

The AFM data nicely complements our results on cell freezing, which further underscores the reset aspect of CaAR and provides important implications in the context of PM damage and cell stress response. The panels in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a> regarding a role of CaAR during PM sealing are central to the physiological role of CaAR and should definitely stay.
