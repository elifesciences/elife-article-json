                    "text": "Zebrafish display a prominent pattern of alternating dark and light stripes generated by the precise positioning of pigment cells in the skin. This arrangement is the result of coordinated cell movements, cell shape changes, and the organisation of pigment cells during metamorphosis. Iridophores play a crucial part in this process by switching between the dense form of the light stripes and the loose form of the dark stripes. Adult <i>schachbrett</i> (<i>sbr</i>) mutants exhibit delayed changes in iridophore shape and organisation caused by truncations in Tight Junction Protein 1a (ZO-1a). In <i>sbr</i> mutants, the dark stripes are interrupted by dense iridophores invading as coherent sheets. Immuno-labelling and chimeric analyses indicate that Tjp1a is expressed in dense iridophores but down-regulated in the loose form. Tjp1a is a novel regulator of cell shape changes during colour pattern formation and the first cytoplasmic protein implicated in this process."

This arrangement is the result of coordinated cell movements, cell shape changes, and the organisation of pigment cells during metamorphosis. Iridophores play a crucial part in this process by switching between the dense form of the light stripes and the loose form of the dark stripes. Adult <i>schachbrett</i> (<i>sbr</i>) mutants exhibit delayed changes in iridophore shape and organisation caused by truncations in Tight Junction Protein 1a (ZO-1a). In <i>sbr</i> mutants, the dark stripes are interrupted by dense iridophores invading as coherent sheets. Immuno-labelling and chimeric analyses indicate that Tjp1a is expressed in dense iridophores but down-regulated in the loose form. Tjp1a is a novel regulator of cell shape changes during colour pattern formation and the first cytoplasmic protein implicated in this process."

The stripes are a result of three different pigment cells interacting with each other, and first begin to emerge when the animal is two to three weeks old. At that time, iridescent cells called iridophores begin to multiply and spread in the skin. In the light-coloured stripes, the iridophores are compact and \u2018dense\u2019; in the dark stripes the cells change into a \u2018loose\u2019 shape and organisation. Black-pigmented cells fill in the dark stripes, and a third cell type with a yellow hue condenses over the light stripes. How the three types of cell work together to make the striped pattern is not fully understood."

                        "text": "One of the most fascinating features of vertebrates is their display of remarkable colour patterns in skin, fur, or plumage, frequently varying strikingly between closely related species. Teleost fish exhibit a particularly high diversity of patterns formed by several types of pigment cells distributed in a multilayered arrangement in the hypodermis (<a href=\"#bib42\">Singh and N\u00fcsslein-Volhard, 2015</a>). Adult zebrafish display a conspicuous pattern of alternating dark and light stripes; remarkably different from a relatively simple larval pattern, which is generated directly from neural crest cells migrating during embryogenesis (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kelsh et al., 1996</a>). The adult pattern is formed from neural crest-derived progenitors during metamorphosis (3\u20136 weeks of development). Metamorphic iridophores (silvery cells containing reflective guanine platelets) and melanophores (dark cells containing the black pigment melanin) arise from neural crest-derived stem cells associated with the peripheral nervous system, whereas metamorphic xanthophores (yellow\u2013orange cells containing pteridine based pigments) originate from proliferating larval xanthophores (<a href=\"#bib7\">Budi et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Dooley et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Mahalwar et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">McMenamin et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Singh et al., 2014</a>). Several adult viable zebrafish mutants displaying abnormal adult pigment patterns have been described (<a href=\"#bib12\">Haffter et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Kelsh et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Lister et al., 1999</a>). One class of genes primarily affects the formation of one of the three cell types. For example <i>nacre/mitfa</i> mutants lack melanophores, <i>pfeffer/csf1ra/fms</i> mutants lack xanthophores, and in <i>shady/ltk</i> iridophores are compromised (<a href=\"#bib27\">Lister et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Parichy et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Lopes et al., 2008</a>). Genetic analyses and regeneration studies revealed that interactions between all three cell types are necessary for proper stripe formation in the trunk of the fish (<a href=\"#bib29\">Maderspacher and N\u00fcsslein-Volhard, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Nakamasu et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Frohnh\u00f6fer et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Patterson and Parichy, 2013</a>)."

Iridophores take a lead in stripe formation: they appear along the horizontal myoseptum, proliferate and spread as a dense sheet in the skin to form the first light stripe. At the margins of this first light stripe, the dense iridophores undergo a transition into a loose form and spread over the dark stripe region. Past the presumptive dark stripe, they change into the dense form again and aggregate into sheets forming new light stripes (<a href=\"#bib43\">Singh et al., 2014</a>). The first two dark stripes form dorsally and ventrally of the first light stripe by melanoblasts migrating along spinal nerves into the skin in the presumptive dark stripe region. They initially appear as stellate cells with the pigment located in the centre of the cells but later expand into the stationary rounded form (<a href=\"#bib8\">Dooley et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Singh et al., 2014</a>). Metamorphic xanthophores originate from larval xanthophores, they compact over the dense iridophores of the light stripe and change into a pale stellate shape above the loose iridophores and melanophores of the dark stripe (<a href=\"#bib30\">Mahalwar et al., 2014</a>). A different type of iridophores\u2014L-iridophores\u2014underlie the melanophores of the dark stripe. L-iridophores appear only after the first two dark stripes are formed and do not participate in laying out the pattern (<a href=\"#bib10\">Frohnh\u00f6fer et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Hirata et al., 2003</a>, <a href=\"#bib14\">2005</a>). Interestingly, iridophore-deficient mutants are not affected in the stripe pattern of the fins, suggesting differences in the mechanisms involved in patterning of the trunk and fins (<a href=\"#bib10\">Frohnh\u00f6fer et al., 2013</a>)."

Immunostaining revealed that Tjp1a is expressed in dense iridophores but neither in loose iridophores nor any other pigment cell type. Analysis of double mutants and chimeras shows that <i>sbr</i> is cell-autonomously required in iridophores. During metamorphosis, dense iridophores invade the dark stripe regions and temporarily suppress the expansion of melanophores, suggesting that Tjp1a is required to regulate the transition of dense iridophores into the loose shape and their organisation."

The mutation was mapped to the region 29.6\u201332.5 Mb of chromosome 7 (Ensembl Zebrafish release 72) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Using a candidate approach, we sequenced <i>tjp1a</i> cDNA of <i>sbr</i><sup><i>tnh009b</i></sup> and detected a nonsense mutation leading to Y1143Stop change in the C-terminal part of the protein (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). To confirm the suggestion that this mutation is causative for the <i>sbr</i> phenotype, we performed a screen for additional alleles. ENU-mutagenized T\u00fc males were crossed to <i>sbr</i><sup><i>tnh009b</i></sup> females; the progeny was raised to the adulthood and screened for the <i>sbr</i> phenotype. Four new alleles not complementing the original allele were isolated. We identified novel stop codons in positions of the <i>tjp1a</i> gene corresponding to the N-terminal part of the protein in all four new alleles. The phenotype is variable, and no qualitative differences between the alleles could be recognized. Individual fish of the <i>sbr</i><sup><i>tnh009b</i></sup> allele with the C-terminal truncation may show a weaker phenotype not seen in the other alleles, therefore, we cannot exclude that it may have residual function. In subsequent crosses, we never observed a segregation of the <i>sbr</i> phenotype and the <i>tjp1a</i> mutant alleles.

To investigate iridophore behaviour, we performed repeated imaging of wild-type and <i>sbr</i> individuals over a period of 2 weeks. To allow a more detailed visualisation of the cell shapes, we imaged fish carrying the <i>Tg(TDL358:GFP)</i> transgene (labelling iridophores and glia with cytosolic GFP [<a href=\"#bib26\">Levesque et al., 2013</a>]) alone (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>) or together with a second transgene, <i>Tg(sox10:mRFP)</i> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>), which labels neural crest derivatives with membrane-bound mRFP. In both, wild type and mutants, iridophores appeared in segmental clusters during early metamorphosis (about 7 mm SL), they increased in number and merged to form the first light stripe (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). In wild type, iridophores proceeded to define the edge of the light stripe, there they delaminated and formed loose iridophores, which spread dorsally and ventrally over the dark stripe regions (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, 8.9 mm; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Singh et al., 2014</a>). Dense iridophores occasionally spread too far from the horizontal myoseptum (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, wt), but later formed sharp light stripe borders. However, in the mutants the dense iridophores did not delaminate but continued to spread over the metamorphic melanophores as a coherent sheet (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, <i>sbr</i> 8.9 mm; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, <i>sbr</i>, 8.3 mm). At later stages, eventually some of them switched to the loose form (arrowheads in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>) and occasionally seemed to disappear from the dark stripe regions at a time point, which coincided with expansion of melanophores (10.5 mm SL, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). When this retreat did not happen, the iridophores persisted in interruptions of the dark stripes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, 11.6 mm). The failure to precisely form the boundary between light and dark stripes might be a cause for another anomaly observed in <i>sbr</i> mutants: L-iridophores, which are restricted to dark stripe areas in wild type, were observed in light stripes of adult <i>sbr</i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

In contrast, the phenotypes of double mutants with <i>nacre</i> (<i>nac</i>, no melanophores, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>) or <i>pfeffer</i> (<i>pfe</i>, no xanthophores, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G</a>) differ from the single mutants.

In combination with <i>sbr</i>, both double mutants show a further expansion of these dense iridophore regions (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F,H</a>), covering most of the body. This phenotypic enhancement suggests that the cell type affected in <i>sbr</i> is still present in <i>nac</i> and <i>pfe</i> mutants, again pointing to iridophores. To confirm these findings, we created chimeric animals by blastomere transplantations. Experiments with <i>sbr</i> donors and <i>nac</i> or <i>pfe</i> recipients revealed that <i>sbr</i> melanophores and xanthophores can participate in normal pattern formation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6I,J</a>). When we used <i>shd</i>;<i>sbr</i> double mutants as recipients (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>) and <i>nac;pfe</i> (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6K</a>) as donors, which can provide only iridophores, we observed regional restoration of the striped pattern in the chimeric fish (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6L</a>). This indicates that <i>sbr</i> is required cell autonomously in iridophores and confirms that mutant <i>sbr</i> melanophores and xanthophores can contribute to the normal pattern when confronted with wild-type iridophores."

Both antibodies allow the detection of Tjp1a in epithelial cells of larval and adult zebrafish skin (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplements 1, 2</a>). This staining is absent in mutants with stop codons in the N-terminal part of <i>tjp1a</i> but present in <i>sbr</i><sup><i>tnh009b</i></sup> mutants stained with \u03b1-Tjp1aN (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We also detected expression of Tjp1a in blood vessels during larval and adult stages (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), corroborating earlier reports on the expression of Tjps in zebrafish and mice (<a href=\"#bib2\">Anderson and Itallie, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Blum et al., 2008</a>). Immunostaining of skin in metamorphic fish carrying the <i>Tg(TDL358:GFP)</i> transgene (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>) shows that Tjp1a is expressed in dense iridophores of the light stripe. Intriguingly, delaminated loose iridophores still express GFP, but no Tjp1a is detectable (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). This indicates that Tjp1a is down-regulated during delamination of loose iridophores from the dense sheet in the light stripe. In adult skin preparations, the signal can be observed in dense iridophores of the light stripes but not in xanthophores, melanophores, L-, or loose iridophores (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). Together with our observation that the loss of <i>tjp1a</i> function in <i>sbr</i> mutants compromises the transition of iridophores from dense to loose state, these results suggest that Tjp1a is a component of the molecular switch that regulates iridophore shape changes during their dispersal."

In the double mutants with <i>sbr</i>, we observe considerably stronger patterning defects than in the single mutants.

These results suggest that connexins and <i>tjp1a</i> do not act in a linear pathway affecting pigmentation. To investigate whether zebrafish Tjp1a can interact directly with connexins, we performed yeast two-hybrid assays (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

In <i>sbr</i> mutants, dense iridophores of the light stripe spread during metamorphosis as a coherent sheet invading dark stripes rather than loosening up and dispersing. Melanophore expansion into the stationary rounded form is temporarily suppressed. However, clustered melanophores later expand and seem to repulse iridophores in a process, which is similar to the one involved in smoothening of stripe boundaries (<a href=\"#bib10\">Frohnh\u00f6fer et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Singh et al., 2014</a>). The location of the interruptions seems to be random. Genetic mosaics, double mutant analysis, as well as immunostaining indicate that Tjp1a is expressed and required in dense iridophores but not in melanophores or xanthophores. We show that, surprisingly, Tjp1a-deficient iridophores do display a dense shape and organisation, however, intriguingly, they fail to undergo the transition to the loose shape. This suggests that the cell shape of loose iridophores is not determined by the absence of Tjp1a per se. In contrast, a reduction in the levels of Tjp1a may be read by iridophores as a trigger for the transition or the cell shape change might result in a down-regulation of Tjp1a. In the absence of Tjp1a, other Tjps might take over the role in cell compaction but may not be able to properly respond to cues guiding the transition to the loose shape."

There are three <i>tjp</i> genes (1\u20133) in mammals and five in zebrafish (1a\u2013b, 2a\u2013b, 3), due to the whole genome duplication in teleosts (<a href=\"#bib1\">Amores et al., 1998</a>). The lack of Tjp1a function in epithelial cells in <i>sbr</i> mutants might be compensated for by other Tjps, for example, Tjp1b, which does not exist in mammals. This is supported by the observation that morpholino-mediated knockdown of <i>tjp1b</i> in <i>sbr</i> mutants, but not wild-type embryos, results in impaired blood flow and death at 5 dpf (<a href=\"#media1\">Videos 1\u20133</a>). This suggests that Tjp1b and Tjp1a have redundant functions at least in the vasculature epithelial cells. This notion is supported by experiments with mammalian cell cultures showing that absence of ZO-1 leads to increased recruitment of ZO-2 to cell membranes, which is suggested to compensate for the absence of ZO-1 (<a href=\"#bib45\">Umeda et al., 2004</a>)."

In wild type, dense iridophores normally stay restricted to developing light stripes, but occasionally spread into the prospective dark stripe areas. This irregularity is usually corrected and sharp stripe boundaries are formed. However, in <i>sbr</i>, the invasion of dense iridophores occurs along the whole length of stripes. Not all dense iridophores persist in dark stripe regions in <i>sbr</i> mutants. In summary, we hypothesize that the loss of Tjp1a impairs the ability of iridophores to recognise the (as yet unknown) cues defining the dark stripe areas or their ability to react to them efficiently. So far, only a rather small number of molecules have been identified, which are involved in the various interactions between chromatophores. Tjp1a is the first for which a molecular distribution and cell type specific expression has been shown."

Irion et al. suggest that Cx39.4 and Cx41.8 form heteromeric gap junctions, promoting interactions of melanophores and xanthophores that result in the appropriate patterning of iridophores. In the absence of xanthophores or melanophores, dense iridophore regions are expanded (<a href=\"#bib10\">Frohnh\u00f6fer et al., 2013</a>), suggesting that Tjp1a in iridophores may be involved in cell communication with xanthophores and/or melanophores. However, the downstream cytoplasmic partners of the transmembrane proteins shown to be involved in patterning in melanophores and xanthophores are unknown as well as transmembrane molecules in iridophores that are responsible for the interactions. Another mutant displaying a spotted pattern is <i>seurat</i>, encoding the transmembrane protein immunoglobulin superfamily member 11 (Igsf11) (<a href=\"#bib9\">Eom et al., 2012</a>). Interestingly, Cx41.8 and Igsf11 are possible interacting partners of Tjps since they have putative PDZ-binding motifs on their extreme C-termini (<a href=\"#bib15\">Hung and Sheng, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Suzu et al., 2002</a>). The multiple protein\u2013protein interacting domains in Tjps allow for many interacting partners and facilitate formation of large complexes in proximity of cell membranes that are associated with tight, adherens, and gap junctions. These provide a link between transmembrane proteins and the cytoskeleton and were shown to participate in regulation of many cellular processes such as junction assembly, cell proliferation, and differentiation (<a href=\"#bib4\">Balda and Matter, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bauer et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Xu et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Gonz\u00e1lez-Mariscal et al., 2014</a>). Our results show that <i>sbr</i> enhances the phenotypes of both <i>luc</i> and <i>leo</i> mutants. This suggests that Tjp1a and connexins do not act in a linear pathway to regulate pattern formation, but most likely work through different mechanisms. One possible explanation is that Tjp1a is required for spatially and temporally controlled reaction of iridophores in response to melanophores (directly or through xanthophores). Absence or truncation of Tjp1a results in a delayed switch to the loose form, which in turn forces melanophores to reorganize according to the presence of dense iridophores in normally iridophore-free regions. In <i>luchs</i> and <i>leopard</i>, the melanophore and xanthophore autonomous mutations also affect patterning of iridophores, likely due to the failure to properly guide iridophores (<a href=\"#bib18\">Irion et al., 2014</a>). The combined effect of failure of melanophores and xanthophores to provide cues to iridophores, and the delayed reaction of iridophores might be responsible for the enhanced phenotypes in the double mutants."

Immunostainings show that Tjp1a is expressed in dense iridophores, but not in loose iridophores. Intriguingly, the absence of Tjp1a does not obviously affect the morphology of dense iridophores, which display normal shape and organisation. In vitro studies of the past decade have demonstrated a function of ZO-1 in organisation of confluent cell layers. Counterintuitively, ZO-1 \u2212/\u2212 Eph4 cells polarize and form tight junctions morphologically indistinguishable from those of ZO-1 +/+ cells, but the formation is delayed. These cells do not exhibit abnormal growth or motility in scratch assays (<a href=\"#bib45\">Umeda et al., 2004</a>). However, knockdown of endogenous ZO-1 in COS-7 cells hampers delamination and migration of cells to fill the wound area in scratch assays (<a href=\"#bib17\">Huo et al., 2011</a>). These data suggest that epithelial cells of different origin may react differently to the absence of ZO-1. Our Tjp1aN antibody shows that the non-functional truncated protein is at least partially retained and normally localized in <i>sbr</i><sup><i>tnh009n</i></sup> mutants, suggesting that the missing domains (ZU-5 and possibly parts of afadin- and actin-binding regions [<a href=\"#bib5\">Bauer et al., 2010</a>]) are crucial for the function of Tjp1a in iridophores. It was shown that absence of the ZU5 domain of ZO-1causes defective delamination and migration of COS-7 cells (<a href=\"#bib17\">Huo et al., 2011</a>). Furthermore, mis-expression of truncated ZO-1 in the presence of the wild-type protein in CE culture leads to the expression of mesenchymal markers and to an epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition (EMT) (<a href=\"#bib40\">Ryeom et al., 2000</a>). Taken together with our findings, these data suggest a role of ZO-1 in regulating and fine-tuning of cell shape and state."

The spatial and temporal regulation of iridophore shape transitions by Tjp1a might underlie the generation of a variety of patterns observed in teleosts.

Multiple mutant alleles of Tjp1a clearly demonstrate an essential function in metamorphic stripe formation. Loss of Tjp1a leads to ectopic spreading of dense iridophores and interruptions in melanophore stripes. Both expression of Tjp1a in iridophores and the ability of wild-type iridophores to restore stripe formation in Tjp1a mutants indicate a function in iridophores for interactions with other pigment cell types. Identification of a novel role for a tight junction protein in pigment cell development is interesting and suggests similar roles in cell-cell communication in other contexts. However, the paper requires further discussion and experiments to make the results more mechanistic and less descriptive. In particular, it is critical to add experiments to show an interaction between Tjp1a and the connexins."

However, there are no experiments in the paper to address this hypothesis, such as tests of genetic interactions in <i>sbr</i>;<i>luc</i> and <i>sbr</i>;<i>leo</i> double mutants, evidence for physical interactions between proteins, or assays for functional gap junctions. Any evidence for (or against) the idea that loss of Tjp1a function disrupts gap junctions would greatly increase the paper's impact. The authors briefly mention that a reduction in Tjp1a may trigger iridophores to undergo the transition from dense to loose and more migratory behaviors. Would gap junctional communication likely influence this transition and if not what alternative types of cell-cell interactions might be involved?"

We included in the manuscript data from a yeast 2-hybrid experiment, which suggests that Tjp1a can interact with connexins39.4 and 41.8. However, both <i>luc</i> and <i>leo</i> connexins function in melanophores and xanthophores, but not in iridophores; this suggests that a direct interaction is unlikely, since Tjp1a is a cytoplasmic protein in iridophores. Hence we propose the existence of iridophore-specific membrane proteins, interacting with <i>luc</i> and <i>leo</i> connexins. This interaction would require Tjp1a in order to transmit a signal necessary for iridophore positioning and specification. As suggested, we included in the article data on double mutants. In both cases the phenotypes of double mutants are stronger than the ones of single mutants, suggesting that these genes are not forming a linear pathway in order to control pigmentation."

Most of these studies investigated aggregation and dispersion behaviour of pigment cells. The mechanisms by which pigment cells mutually influence specification, differentiation and migration only recently became a focus of attention (Irion, <i>eLife</i>, 2014). Depolarization was suggested as a possible mechanism for interactions involving gap junctions (Inaba et al, Science, 2012). However, Tjp1a might also be involved in other as yet unknown mechanisms of cellular interactions."

Hence, we cannot provide more detailed images since it requires longer scanning times. We changed \u201ctime lapse\u201d to \u201crepeated imaging\u201d in the text, as it was already referred to in the Materials and methods. Such imaging allows in some cases to follow individual melanophores, but due to the homogeneous appearance of iridophores, tracking of them is not possible. Naturally, we do not state that abnormal cell movement is the only possible cause of the iridophores invasion into dark stripe areas. Indeed, aberrant iridophore specification, namely compromised change from dense to loose form, is a more likely reason for that. We added more in-depth discussion on this subject to the manuscript."
