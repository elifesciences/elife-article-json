Here, we show that anthocyanin biosynthesis is induced by the virulence promoting secreted effector protein Tin2. Tin2 protein functions inside plant cells where it interacts with maize protein kinase ZmTTK1. Tin2 masks a ubiquitin\u2013proteasome degradation motif in ZmTTK1, thus stabilizing the active kinase. Active ZmTTK1 controls activation of genes in the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway. Without Tin2, enhanced lignin biosynthesis is observed in infected tissue and vascular bundles show strong lignification. This is presumably limiting access of fungal hyphae to nutrients needed for massive proliferation. Consistent with this assertion, we observe that maize <i>brown midrib</i> mutants affected in lignin biosynthesis are hypersensitive to <i>U. maydis</i> infection. We speculate that Tin2 rewires metabolites into the anthocyanin pathway to lower their availability for other defense responses."

Here, we show that anthocyanin biosynthesis is induced by the virulence promoting secreted effector protein Tin2. Tin2 protein functions inside plant cells where it interacts with maize protein kinase ZmTTK1. Tin2 masks a ubiquitin\u2013proteasome degradation motif in ZmTTK1, thus stabilizing the active kinase. Active ZmTTK1 controls activation of genes in the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway. Without Tin2, enhanced lignin biosynthesis is observed in infected tissue and vascular bundles show strong lignification. This is presumably limiting access of fungal hyphae to nutrients needed for massive proliferation. Consistent with this assertion, we observe that maize <i>brown midrib</i> mutants affected in lignin biosynthesis are hypersensitive to <i>U. maydis</i> infection. We speculate that Tin2 rewires metabolites into the anthocyanin pathway to lower their availability for other defense responses."

Up to date, anthocyanin induction was thought to result from unspecific biotic stress caused by microbial infection (<a href=\"#bib60\">Steyn et al., 2002</a>), and flavonoid-pathway related compounds like luteolinidin have been shown to function as phytoalexins negatively affecting fungal growth (<a href=\"#bib57\">Snyder and Nicholson, 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Zuther et al., 2012</a>). So far, no positive link has been established between anthocyanin induction and microbial virulence. We have recently shown that the secreted <i>U. maydis</i> effector Tin2 (Um05302) is specifically responsible for anthocyanin induction in infected seedling tissue (<a href=\"#bib9\">Brefort et al., in press</a>). The <i>tin2</i> effector gene resides in the largest effector gene cluster 19A comprising 24 effectors (<a href=\"#bib37\">K\u00e4mper et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Brefort et al., in press</a>). Deletion of the entire cluster 19A largely abolishes tumor formation and anthocyanin induction, although the mutant is still able to grow and complete its life cycle inside the plant tissue (<a href=\"#bib9\">Brefort et al., in press</a>). Here, we elucidate the molecular function of Tin2 and show that Tin2 is a secreted anthocyanin biosynthesis inducing effector protein functioning inside plant cells. We hypothesize that it may be beneficial for <i>U. maydis</i> to induce anthocyanin biosynthesis as a strategy to compete with tissue lignification and to gain access to veins."

                                "text": "Tin2 was previously shown to be responsible for anthocyanin induction during biotrophic growth and was shown to have a weak contribution to virulence (<a href=\"#bib9\">Brefort et al., in press</a>). To unambiguously establish its contribution to virulence, we introduced <i>tin2</i> in this study into SG200\u039419A-1 (<a href=\"#bib9\">Brefort et al., in press</a>), a mutant strain lacking the 14 leftmost effector genes of cluster 19A, including <i>tin2</i>. This mutant is severely attenuated in virulence, is unable to elicit anthocyanin formation and induces at most small tumors (<a href=\"#bib9\">Brefort et al., in press</a>). Introduction of <i>tin2</i> enhanced tumor formation significantly and fully restored anthocyanin biosynthesis (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>). In addition, we could demonstrate that <i>tin2</i> was induced during biotrophic growth (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Microscopic analysis and fungal biomass determination revealed that a SG200\u0394tin2 mutant did colonize plants efficiently, but was attenuated during late proliferation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). To get an idea, which processes might be affected by Tin2, we determined the transcriptional response of <i>Z. mays</i> to infection by SG200 and SG200\u0394tin2. At 4 days post inoculation (dpi), RNA was prepared from three biological replicates and analyzed by Affymetrix maize genome arrays as described before for other <i>tin</i> mutants (<a href=\"#bib9\">Brefort et al., in press</a>). Hierarchical clustering analysis of differentially regulated genes showed that the expression patterns of plant genes in response to SG200\u0394tin2 was related to the response to SG200 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>), consistent with the small contribution of Tin2 to tumor formation. Among the top five genes most highly induced after SG200 infection (compared to SG200\u0394tin2), two were related to anthocyanin biosynthesis (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 1</a>) and one of these was the second most highly induced gene when SG200-infected tissue was compared with mock inoculated tissue (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 2</a>). To substantiate these data, we performed quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) for the five genes comprising the anthocyanin pathway (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>) using tissue from maize infected with SG200 and SG200\u0394tin2, respectively (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). This analysis revealed that all five genes tested were significantly induced in SG200-infected tissue, illustrating that the anthocyanin pathway is transcriptionally induced when <i>U. maydis</i> provides the <i>tin2</i> effector. Another pathway comprising three differentially regulated genes concerned the biosynthesis of the secondary metabolite 2,4-dihydroxy-7-methoxy-1,4-benzoxazin-3-one (DIMBOA, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 1</a>; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>) implicated in aphid and fungal resistance (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ahmad et al., 2011</a>). When the expression levels of eight genes comprising the entire DIMBOA biosynthesis pathway were analyzed by qPCR, we detected significant differences in expression for <i>Bx1</i>, <i>Bx2</i>, <i>Bx5</i> and <i>Bx8</i> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>) in SG200- and SG200\u0394tin2-infected tissue while we could not detect differences in expression for <i>Bx3</i>, <i>Bx4</i>, <i>Bx6</i> and <i>Bx7</i> (not shown). To determine whether the transcriptional changes detected can be linked to the presence or absence of respective metabolites, amounts of total anthocyanin were quantified photometrically at the anthocyanin specific absorption of 515 nm (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>). This revealed an approximately 15-fold increase of anthocyanins in leaf material upon infection with the wild-type strain that was absent in the SG200\u0394tin2-infected leaves (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). By UPLC-PDA-TOF-MS analysis the identity of the three highly abundant anthocyanins in infected maize leaves were determined: cyanidin 3-glucoside (449.0996 Da, C<sub>21</sub>H<sub>21</sub>O<sub>11</sub><sup>+</sup>); cyanidin 3-(6\u2019\u2019-malonylglucoside) (535.1088 Da, C<sub>24</sub>H<sub>23</sub>O<sub>14</sub><sup>+</sup>); cyanidin 3-(3\u2019\u2019,6\u2019\u2019-dimalonylglucoside) (621.1092 Da, C<sub>27</sub>H<sub>25</sub>O<sub>17</sub><sup>+</sup>) and confirmed by MS<sup>2</sup> fragmentation studies (<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a>). These cyanidin derivatives were previously described to be the major anthocyanins in maize leaves (<a href=\"#bib23\">Fossen et al., 2001</a>). Relative amounts of these three cyanidins identified confirmed the overall anthocyanin profile (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). In the UPLC-PDA-TOF-MS analysis, we also identified flavonoids and DIBOA-glucoside to be reduced in tissue infected with the <i>tin2</i> mutant relative to the corresponding wild type (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D,E</a>). Exact mass as well as MS<sup>2</sup> spectra information allowed to identify the three flavonoids as: orientin 2\u2019\u2019-<i>O</i>-rhamnoside (594.1585 Da, C<sub>27</sub>H<sub>30</sub>O<sub>15</sub>); isoorientin 2\u2019\u2019-<i>O</i>-rhamnoside (594.1585 Da, C<sub>27</sub>H<sub>30</sub>O<sub>15</sub>); quercetin-glucoside-rhamnoside (610.1534, C<sub>27</sub>H<sub>30</sub>O<sub>16</sub>) (<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a>). The biosynthesis of these flavonoids branches off the anthocyanin pathway and is likely a side effect of the upregulation of this pathway after infection by wild-type <i>U. maydis</i> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). In case of DIMBOA biosynthesis we identified 2,4-dihydroxy-1,4-benzoxazin-3-one glucoside (DIBOA-glucoside, 343.0903 Da, C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>17</sub>NO<sub>9</sub>, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>) to be regulated by Tin2. These findings suggest that, besides the influence of Tin2 on anthocyanin, additional pathways may be affected directly or indirectly by <i>tin2</i>."

Orthologous proteins are absent in other organisms examined to date but exist in the related smut fungi <i>Sporisorium reilianum</i> and <i>U</i>. <i>scitaminea</i>. An amino acid alignment revealed significant sequence conservation in the C-terminal third of the protein, whereas the N-terminus showed less conservation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). The C-terminal region contains two proline repeat sequences (PxxP), suggesting that this domain might be important for the interaction with other proteins (<a href=\"#bib54\">Saksela et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Kay et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Dornan et al., 2003</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>).

                                "text": "To demonstrate that the Tin2 protein can be secreted, we constructed a strain constitutively expressing a biologically active Tin2-HA fusion protein (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>) and showed that full-length Tin2-HA was detectable in the culture supernatant (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). To visualize protein secretion during biotrophic development a Tin2<sub>1-25</sub>-mCherry-Tin2<sub>26-207</sub> fusion protein was expressed in SG200\u0394tin2 under the <i>cmu1</i> promoter, which confers strong expression during plant colonization (<a href=\"#bib13\">Djamei et al., 2011</a>). After infection, mCherry fluorescence could be observed around fungal hyphae (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). When subjected to plasmolysis, which enlarges the apoplastic compartment, the fluorescence of Tin2<sub>1-25</sub>-mCherry-Tin2<sub>26-207</sub> resided in the apoplast (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>), demonstrating secretion (<a href=\"#bib16\">Doehlemann et al., 2009</a>). Strain SG200\u0394tin2-Tin2<sub>1-25</sub>-mCherry-Tin2<sub>26-207</sub> elicited anthocyanin induction, but compared to SG200 the appearance was delayed (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), suggesting that the Tin2<sub>1-25</sub>-mCherry-Tin2<sub>26-207</sub> fusion protein is only partially functional. In addition, mCherry-Tin2<sub>26-207</sub> was never detected in the cytosol of infected plants. Since anthocyanin biosynthesis is occurring in the cytosol of plant cells (<a href=\"#bib34\">Holton and Cornish, 1995</a>), we expected that Tin2 would translocate to plant cells after being secreted. To demonstrate a function of Tin2 in the plant cytosol, we expressed <i>tin2</i> without its secretion signal under the CaMV 35S promoter in maize leaf epidermal cells after biolistic bombardment. As this did not induce anthocyanin (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>, leftmost panel), we repeated the experiment with leaves from plants infected with SG200\u0394tin2. Here, anthocyanin could be induced by Tin2<sub>26-207</sub> (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>, third panel), was absent in infected leaves without <i>tin2</i> expression (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>, second panel) and could also not be observed when biologically inactive Tin2<sub>26-202</sub> was expressed (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>, rightmost panel). To confirm that anthocyanin is produced in SG200\u0394tin2-infected tissue transiently transformed with <i>tin2</i>, p35S-Tin2<sub>26-207</sub> and p35S-mCherry as transformation control were introduced simultaneously in SG200\u0394tin2-infected tissue. Anthocyanin production, detected by its dark color in bright field microscopy, was observed in the bombarded cell that also expressed cytosolic mCherry (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). Interestingly, cells neighboring the transformed cell also accumulated anthocyanin (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>, red arrow). When biolistic transformation of uninfected maize leaves was carried out with a plasmid expressing mCherry-Tin2<sub>26-207</sub>, the fusion protein was found to spread into non-transformed neighboring cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). Symplastic spreading was observed for the Cmu1 effector of <i>U. maydis</i> and for several translocated effectors of <i>Magnaporthe oryzae</i> (<a href=\"#bib40\">Khang et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Djamei et al., 2011</a>). Collectively, these results demonstrate that Tin2 functions within the plant cytosol and suggest that Tin2 may prepare maize cells for the infection by <i>U. maydis</i>."

After rescreening, only one putative cytoplasmic serine/threonine protein kinase from maize, designated ZmTTK1 (<span class=\"underline\">T</span>in2-<span class=\"underline\">t</span>argeting <span class=\"underline\">k</span>inase <span class=\"underline\">1</span>) could be confirmed (not shown). ZmTTK1 is an uncharacterized kinase, with its kinase domain located at the C-terminus (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). Maize may contain two putative paralogs of ZmTTK1 (GRMZM2G088409; GRMZM2G068192) with highly conserved kinase domains (63 and 65% identity), but reduced homology in the N-terminal domains (34% and 36% identity, respectively). Orthologs are found in monocot plants like <i>Sorghum bicolor</i>, <i>Oryza sativa</i>, <i>Hordeum vulgare</i>, and <i>Brachypodium distachyon</i> and these display high amino acid sequence identity with ZmTTK1 from maize (between 75% and 94%) (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,B</a>). <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> also encodes a putative ortholog of ZmTTK1 (AT2G40120), but in this case the amino acid identity is significantly lower (57%) (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,B</a>). ZmTTK1 orthologs from monocot plants display highly conserved N- and C-terminal domains, which are separated by a more variable central domain (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,C</a>). In the related <i>A. thaliana</i> protein, the N-terminal region shows only patchy homology to the monocot proteins and the central domain is missing (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). None of these proteins have been functionally characterized to date."

Physical interaction between recombinant Strep-ZmTTK1 protein and recombinant GST-Tin2<sub>26-207</sub> protein was demonstrated by co-IP using GST-Tin2<sub>26-202</sub> as negative control (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>). Recombinant ZmTTK1 purified from <i>E. coli</i> was expressed as full-length protein (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>) and showed in vitro kinase activity determined with MBP (myelin basic protein) as substrate. However, no significant differences in MBP phosphorylation were apparent in the presence or absence of Tin2 (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C</a>). To examine whether Tin2 protein affects ZmTTK1 activity in vivo, we transiently expressed ZmTTK1 protein in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>. In this system, ZmTTK1 protein proved highly unstable and the N-terminal region could not be detected (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10A</a>). This region contains a phosphodegron-like motif DSGxS, which, when phosphorylated at serine residues, serves as a recognition motif for the ubiquitin ligase complex leading to protein degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system (<a href=\"#bib50\">Ravid and Hochstrasser, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Spoel et al., 2009</a>). Addition of proteasome inhibitor MG132 to <i>N. benthamiana</i> cells transiently expressing ZmTTK1-HA allowed detection of full-length protein (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10B</a>). In addition, ZmTTK1<sub>S279/282A</sub>-HA protein carrying alanine substitutions at positions serine 279 and serine 282 in the phosphodegron-like motif could be expressed as full-length protein in the transient <i>N. benthamiana</i> system (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10B</a>).

In transiently transformed cells weak anthocyanin induction could be observed (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11C</a>). In maize anthocyanin biosynthesis genes are positively regulated via ZmR1 and ZmC1 transcription factors (<a href=\"#bib46\">Ludwig and Wessler, 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Dooner et al., 1991</a>). Therefore, we co-expressed Tin2<sub>26-207</sub> and ZmTTK1 in uninfected maize leaves together with mCherry-ZmR1 or mCherry-ZmC1 protein, respectively. mCherry-ZmC1 localized to the nucleus, and this localization did not change significantly in the presence of Tin2<sub>26-207</sub> and ZmTTK1 (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11D</a>). When mCherry-ZmR1 was expressed alone, the fusion protein showed weak cytoplasmic and nuclear localization (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11E</a>). However, when co-expressed with Tin2<sub>26-207</sub> and ZmTTK1, mCherry-ZmR1 protein showed almost exclusively intense nuclear localization (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11D,E</a>). These results suggest that ZmTTK1 protein kinase stabilized by Tin2 might phosphorylate the ZmR1 protein, which is then imported into the nucleus (or is retained there) and induces anthocyanin biosynthetic genes."

In the general phenylpropanoid pathway, phenylalanine is converted to 4-coumaroyl CoA, which then serves as a precursor for both, anthocyanins and lignin (<a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12A</a>). Since we had shown that all genes in the anthocyanin branch of the pathway are upregulated in tissue infected with SG200, but not in tissue infected with SG200\u0394tin2 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>), we determined abundance of transcripts encoding key enzymes in the general and lignin-specific branches of the phenylpropanoid pathway by qPCR in leaves infected with strains SG200 and SG200\u0394tin2. qPCR analysis demonstrated that the phenylalanine ammonia lyase (<i>PAL</i>) gene in the general part of the pathway was significantly upregulated in both SG200- and SG200\u0394tin2-infected tissue compared to mock inoculation (<a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12B</a>). One of the two \u2018cinnamoyl-CoA reductase\u2019 (<i>CCR</i>) genes of maize one was not induced, while the other one (GRMZM2G131836) was clearly induced after <i>U. maydis</i> infection, but there was no difference in induction in SG200- and SG200\u0394tin2-infected leaves (<a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12</a>). The major 4-coumarate-CoA ligase (<i>4CL</i>) gene in the lignin-specific branch (GRMZM2G075333; based on homology with sorghum; <a href=\"#bib53\">Saballos et al., 2012</a>) was not differentially regulated, while the flavonoid-related <i>4CL</i> (GRMZM2G054013) was downregulated in SG200\u0394tin2-infected tissue compared to SG200-infected tissue (<a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12B</a>). Of the six cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (<i>CAD</i>) genes, four genes were significantly upregulated in SG200\u0394tin2-infected tissue (<a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12B</a>). The enhanced expression of several lignin biosynthesis genes after infection with the <i>tin2</i> mutant coincided with an transcriptional upregulation of several plant cell wall remodeling genes (<a href=\"#SD4-data\">Figure 12\u2014source data 1</a>) and a decrease in ferulic acid (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>), which is involved in crosslinking hemicellulosic polysaccharides and provides a nucleation site for lignification (<a href=\"#bib27\">Grabber et al., 2002</a>), suggesting a connection between these processes. Furthermore, in a maize chalcone synthase mutant (<i>c2</i>), in which the biosynthetic pathway to anthocyanins is blocked, and in which there could conceivably be more precursor going into the lignin branch, virulence of <i>U. maydis</i> SG200 was attenuated (<a href=\"#fig13\">Figure 13</a>)."

Early Golden Bantam) revealed a small increase in leaf tissue infected with <i>tin2</i> mutant strains relative to SG200-infected material that was statistically significant in one of three analyzed mutants (<a href=\"#fig14\">Figure 14A</a>). Collectively, these results suggest that anthocyanin induction by Tin2 protein may negatively affect the lignin pathway. To determine whether lignin content affects virulence of <i>U. maydis</i>, we infected single and double <i>brown midrib</i> (<i>bm</i>) mutants of maize with SG200 (<a href=\"#fig14\">Figure 14B\u2013D</a>). The <i>bm1</i> mutation reduces CAD activity (<a href=\"#bib29\">Halpin et al., 1998</a>) as a result of a mutation in the <i>ZmCAD2</i> gene (<a href=\"#bib12\">Chen et al., 2012</a>), the major CAD involved in lignification of vascular tissue in leaves and stems. The leaf midribs of the <i>bm2</i> mutant contain less lignin, and the tissue-specific pattern of lignification in the leaves is altered (<a href=\"#bib64\">Vermerris and Boon, 2001</a>). Lignin content in the leaves and stems of the <i>bm3</i> mutant is reduced, lignin subunit composition has shifted towards a higher guaiacyl/syringyl (G/S) ratio, and novel benzodioxane structures are present as a result of the incorporation of 5-hydroxyconiferyl alcohol (<a href=\"#bib42\">Lapierre et al., 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Chabbert et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Marita et al., 2003</a>). This is the result of a mutation in the gene encoding caffeic acid <i>O</i>-methyl transferase (<i>COMT</i>) (<a href=\"#bib68\">Vignols et al., 1995</a>). The <i>bm4</i> mutation has not yet been mapped to a specific gene, but affects the cell wall composition of leaves and lowers the lignin content of leaf midribs (<a href=\"#bib67\">Vermerris et al., 2010</a>). Except for the <i>bm2</i> mutant, all other single <i>bm</i> mutants displayed elevated virulence symptoms after <i>U. maydis</i> infection, with <i>bm3</i> showing the strongest effect (<a href=\"#fig14\">Figure 14C</a>). Of the double mutants, the <i>bm3-bm4</i> mutant showed dramatically enhanced disease symptoms, while disease symptoms in the <i>bm2-bm3</i> double mutant was lower than in the single <i>bm3</i> mutant (<a href=\"#fig14\">Figure 14C</a>), suggesting a negative effect of the <i>bm2</i> mutation on virulence in this combination. When <i>bm2</i> was combined with <i>bm1</i>, virulence was comparable to the single <i>bm1</i> mutant (<a href=\"#fig14\">Figure 14C</a>). The alterations in virulence in the <i>bm</i> mutants were not only visible in symptom severity but also with respect to symptom distribution (<a href=\"#fig14\">Figure 14D</a>). After infection with SG200, more than 80% of leaf tumors stayed locally confined, while in the <i>bm</i> mutants (with the exception of the single <i>bm2</i> mutant) leaf tumors were much more spread and covered the entire leaf area from the injection hole to the stem (<a href=\"#fig14\">Figure 14B,D</a>), suggesting that lignification restricts <i>U. maydis</i> growth and spread in the infected tissue. In line with this assertion, we observed strongly lignified cells in vascular bundle tissue in cross sections of maize leaves infected with SG200\u0394tin2 and could only rarely observe fungal hyphae in bundle sheath cells (<a href=\"#fig14\">Figure 14E</a>). By contrast, lignification was significantly less pronounced in SG200-infected tissue (<a href=\"#fig14\">Figure 14F</a>) and in tissue infected by SG200\u0394tin3 (<a href=\"#fig14\">Figure 14G</a>), a mutant lacking another effector from cluster 19A that does not affect anthocyanin induction (<a href=\"#bib9\">Brefort et al., in press</a>). Additionally, SG200 and SG200\u0394tin3 hyphae were readily detected inside bundle sheath cells (<a href=\"#fig14\">Figure 14F,G</a>). This suggests that anthocyanin induction by the Tin2 effector attenuates lignification of vascular bundle cells, conceivably facilitating fungal access to nutrients in vascular bundle tissue."

                        "text": "Comprehensive genetic, biochemical and transcriptome analyses allowed us to uncover a connection between anthocyanin and lignin biosynthesis that is targeted by a novel secreted effector of <i>U. maydis</i>, Tin2. Our results are summarized in the model depicted in <a href=\"#fig15\">Figure 15</a>. The link between Tin2 and anthocyanin biosynthesis appears direct and occurs through the stabilization of the kinase ZmTTK1 via Tin2. We have shown that after <i>U. maydis</i> infection, when Tin2 is present, the stabilization of ZmTTK1 will increase biosynthesis of anthocyanin. Conversely, when <i>U. maydis</i> is lacking <i>tin2</i>, more of the common precursor for anthocyanin and lignin, 4-coumaric acid, is likely to be available for lignin biosynthesis (<a href=\"#fig15\">Figure 15</a>) resulting in cell wall fortification in vascular tissue. The deposition of lignin in the plant cell wall is considered to provide an undegradable physical barrier to infection (<a href=\"#bib63\">Vance et al., 1980</a>). The observed decrease in ferulic acid in SG200\u0394tin2-infected leaves compared to SG200-infected tissue is consistent with increased lignification where ferulic acid acts as a nucleation site for lignin polymerization (<a href=\"#bib27\">Grabber et al., 2002</a>). Tin2 affected all steps of the anthocyanin pathway, but did not affect transcription of all genes coding for lignin pathway components. While none of the early genes implicated in lignin biosynthesis were upregulated after infection with <i>U. maydis</i> wild type, we observed transcriptional effects for four of the six <i>CAD</i> genes acting at a late step of the lignin pathway (<a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12A</a>). At present, there is only a limited understanding of how the lignin biosynthetic pathway in maize is regulated. Several Myb and NAC transcriptional activators involved in secondary cell wall formation have been identified (<a href=\"#bib22\">Fornal\u00e9 et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Zhong et al., 2011</a>), but the mechanisms behind tissue-specific and developmentally regulated gene expression, and the role of posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression are yet to be fully elucidated. In <i>tin2</i> mutant infected tissue total lignin levels appear increased, although statistically relevant effects were seen in only one of the mutants analyzed (<a href=\"#fig14\">Figure 14A</a>). This may reflect that increased lignification does not affect the entire leaf but, as we have shown, is restricted to the vascular tissue colonized by the <i>tin2</i> mutant late in infection. Therefore, when total tissue is analyzed, differences in total lignin content may not be so evident in wild-type and <i>tin2</i> mutant infected tissue. However, the increased susceptibility of maize <i>bm</i> mutants to <i>U. maydis</i> and the increased leaf areas displaying disease symptoms, provide strong evidence for a role of lignification in disease resistance. Several mechanisms may form the basis for this observation. A less lignified cell wall will be easier to penetrate by the fungus. The plant may also be less effective at producing defense-related lignin that could slow down the migration of the fungus. Lastly, since the fungus spreads via the vascular tissue and may rely on nutrients obtained from this tissue for massive proliferation, the altered physico-chemical characteristics of the vascular tissue in the <i>bm</i> mutants, combined with altered dimensions of the xylem vessels (<a href=\"#bib67\">Vermerris et al., 2010</a>) may influence entry and the rate of migration of the fungus. The <i>bm2</i> mutant appears to be an exception in that it does not show increased susceptibility to <i>U. maydis</i>, and even appears to attenuate the effect of infection in <i>bm1-bm2</i> and <i>bm2-bm3</i> double mutants relative to the <i>bm1</i> and <i>bm3</i> single mutants. This effect may be due to the accumulation of a fungitoxic (phenolic) compound in this mutant, as has been proposed for the sorghum <i>brown midrib12</i> mutant, which was shown to be less susceptible to colonization by <i>Fusarium</i> spp. (<a href=\"#bib24\">Funnell-Harris et al., 2010</a>). Also in <i>N. attenuata</i> lines in which two <i>CAD</i> genes were silenced, compensatory processes for the structural deficiencies were observed when plants were grown in the field, and in this case such plants accumulated various phenylpropanoids (<a href=\"#bib38\">Kaur et al., 2012</a>). Therefore, while we consider direct effects of Tin2 on lignification to be the simplest model to explain the reduced virulence on the <i>tin2</i> mutant strain (<a href=\"#fig15\">Figure 15</a>), the situation may in reality be much more complex. For example we cannot formally rule out that in the absence of anthocyanin biosynthesis it is not actually the enhanced lignification that affects fungal spread but an altered composition of the plant cell walls. Conversely, the enhanced disease symptoms observed in the <i>bm</i> mutants could also be attributed to an lower incorporation of phenolics rather than to the reduction in lignin, that is in wild-type plants cell wall phenolics may negatively affect fungal growth and restrict pathogen spread."

In addition, the direct or indirect effects of Tin2 on other pathways like DIMBOA and flavonoid biosynthesis might complicate such analyses. However, precedence for a connection between lignin and anthocyanin biosynthesis comes from <i>A. thaliana</i>, where the silencing of HCT (hydroxycinnamoyl transferase), the first committed enzyme from the lignin pathway, redirected the metabolic flux into flavonoids through chalcone synthase and this resulted in elevated levels of flavonols and anthocyanin (<a href=\"#bib7\">Besseau et al., 2007</a>). In addition, transgenic <i>A. thaliana</i> plants expressing the lignin biosynthesis repressing ZmMYB31 transcription factor from maize redirected carbon flux towards the biosynthesis of anthocyanins (<a href=\"#bib22\">Fornal\u00e9 et al., 2010</a>). Recently, a competition between anthocyanin and lignin pathways for their common precursor has also been detected in strawberry (<a href=\"#bib52\">Ring et al., 2013</a>). In that system it was demonstrated that plant class III peroxidase (FaPRX27), a gene connected with lignin biosynthesis, is linked to a region implied in fruit color decrease. In addition, it was demonstrated that the downregulation of chalcone synthase lead to an induction of FaPRX27 and this diverted the flux from anthocyanins to lignin (<a href=\"#bib52\">Ring et al., 2013</a>). Thus, there appears to be a metabolic connection between anthocyanin and lignin biosynthesis pathways in monocot as well as dicot systems and <i>U. maydis</i> may be altering this with the help of Tin2. Future work will be needed to address whether this connection is direct with lignin functioning as barrier or indirect with anthocyanin induction negatively affecting the accumulation of other defense compounds."

We suggest that the difference in ZmR1 localization may be caused by its phosphorylation, although we cannot exclude other possibilities. In <i>A. thaliana</i> MYB75, which is related to maize ZmC1, but is not the closest ortholog, acts as a repressor for the lignin-specific branch of the phenylpropanoid pathway presumably through an interaction with TT8, a bHLH protein related to ZmR1 (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bhargava et al., 2010</a>). If such a scenario also exists in maize, the observed Tin2-mediated nuclear localization of ZmR1 might actually promote the formation of such a repressive complex for lignin biosynthesis. How Tin2 affects the expression of DIMBOA is currently unclear. It is conceivable that this could reflect a co-regulation with anthocyanin biosynthesis genes. Alternatively, the activity of another transcription factor might be modulated by the Tin2-stabilized ZmTTK1 protein. An upregulation of <i>Bx1</i> and elevated amounts of DIMBOA had previously been detected after colonization of maize by <i>U. maydis</i> (<a href=\"#bib4\">Basse, 2005</a>). In this context, it had also been demonstrated that <i>U. maydis</i> is resistant to DIMBOA (<a href=\"#bib4\">Basse, 2005</a>) while several other fungal pathogens of maize are susceptible (<a href=\"#bib25\">Glenn et al., 2002</a>). This could indicate that the induction of DIMBOA might deter infection by other pathogens in <i>U. maydis</i> infected tissue. However, in a macro-array based expression analysis of phenylpropanoid and related genes in <i>brown midrib</i> mutants, two genes from the DIMBOA pathway, <i>Bx4</i> and <i>Bx5</i>, were significantly upregulated in the <i>bm3</i> mutant, that is the mutant with the strongest effect in lignin biosynthesis (<a href=\"#bib28\">Guillaumie et al., 2007</a>). The authors suggest that this may be a compensatory reaction for the lack of COMT activity in the <i>bm3</i> mutant (<a href=\"#bib28\">Guillaumie et al., 2007</a>). If true, the upregulation of DIMBOA after SG200 infection could also be the consequence of the locally reduced lignin content in the infected areas."

Based on similar results with Cmu1, another transferred effector (<a href=\"#bib13\">Djamei et al., 2011</a>), we speculate that large fluorescent tags fused to the respective effector prevent uptake in this pathosystem. Cmu1 and Tin2 do not share obvious common motifs that can be recognized in their primary amino acid sequence that could serve as translocation signal, and it remains to be determined how they cross the plant plasma membrane. Anthocyanin induction after transient transformation of Tin2 could be observed only when plants were pre-infected with a <i>tin2</i> mutant strain. We consider that it may be necessary to pre-infect plants to obtain high levels of phenylalanine or tyrosine for anthocyanin biosynthesis. These amino acids supply the flavonoid pathway and <i>U. maydis</i> infection was shown to increase their amounts in infected leaves through Cmu1 and possibly other effectors (<a href=\"#bib15\">Doehlemann et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Djamei et al., 2011</a>)."

We hypothesize that there will be a native regulatory system stabilizing the ZmTTK1 protein kinase in such conditions, and Tin2 may mimic this regulator. Interestingly, ZmTTK1 orthologs in barley and <i>B</i>. <i>distachyon</i> have substitutions in critical serine residues of the phosphodegron motif DSGxS, and in the related kinase from <i>A. thaliana</i> this region is missing altogether (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>).

In addition, its accumulation is frequently observed under abiotic and biotic stress conditions. Anthocyanin is transported and accumulates in the vacuole (<a href=\"#bib26\">Goodman et al., 2004</a>), provides UV-B stress protection and allows scavenging of reactive oxygen species (<a href=\"#bib60\">Steyn et al., 2002</a>).

In addition, some other examples, not connected to classical resistance responses, have been described: in a recent report it has been demonstrated that tomatoes enriched in anthocyanins are less susceptible to the necrotrophic fungus <i>Botrytis cinerea</i>. The enhanced resistance occurs through reduced spreading of the ROS burst, which limits the induction of cell death necessary for growth of this necrotroph (<a href=\"#bib72\">Zhang et al., 2013</a>). In potato it was shown that ectopic overexpression of an anthocyanin 5-<i>O</i>-glycosyl transferase conferred enhanced resistance to the bacterial pathogen <i>Erwinia carotovora</i>. In this system, it is not clear, however, whether the effects are direct or indirect (<a href=\"#bib44\">Lorenc-Kuku\u0142a et al., 2005</a>). In perennial ryegrass infected with the fungal endophyte <i>Epichloae festucae</i>, prominent anthocyanin induction is observed at the base of tillers, while fungal \u0394<i>sak</i> mutants, lacking a stress activated MAP kinase, fail to induce anthocyanin, display alterations in the vascular tissue and accumulate less fungal biomass (<a href=\"#bib19\">Eaton et al., 2010</a>). In this system it has been speculated that the observed downregulation of key enzymes in the shikimate and anthocyanin pathway may divert precursors into the catechin/tannin pathway with negative consequences for fungal development (<a href=\"#bib19\">Eaton et al., 2010</a>). In the present study, we have uncovered a new positive connection between anthocyanin induction and development of a biotrophic pathogen. We suggest that examples where anthocyanin induction is observed in response to biotic stress should be revisited to see, whether metabolic rewiring of the phenylpropanoid pathway is adopted as a common strategy by biotrophic microbes colonizing plants."

Fungal hyphae were stained with WGA-AF488 (Invitrogen), the plant cell wall was stained with propidium iodide (Sigma-Aldrich). Leaf samples were incubated in staining solution (1 \u00b5g/ml propidium iodide, 10 \u00b5g/ml WGA-AF488) and observed with a TCS-SP5 confocal laser-scanning microscope (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) under the following conditions. WGA-AF488: excitation at 488 nm and detection at 500\u2013540 nm, propidium iodide: excitation at 561 nm and detection at 580\u2013660 nm. For fluorescent protein detection, leaf samples were directly observed by confocal microscopy under the following conditions. mCherry: excitation at 561 nm and detection at 580\u2013630 nm, YFP: excitation at 495 nm and detection at 510\u2013550 nm. For observation of vascular bundles, infected leaf segments collected at 6 dpi were cut into small pieces and fixed with 4% glutaraldehyde. The segments were embedded in epoxy resin and sliced with a microtome (0.4 \u00b5m thickness). Cross-sections were stained with 1% (wt/vol) Safranin O (Sigma-Aldrich) for 2\u20133 min and observed by light microscopy."

The most serious concern was that, while there is evidence for an anthocyanin role in defense, there was not very good support for a flux trade off argument with respect to the role of lignin, especially since anthocyanins can act directly as antimicrobial compounds of the phytoalexin class in other species, without invoking a lignin link. The flux trade off is highly speculative. One way to support the model would be to determine whether high anthocyanin lines have lowered lignin content. Alternatively, you should merely bring up the lignin link as a speculative hypothesis in the Discussion."

In this work the authors make the identification of a putative monocot specific phenolic regulator that interacts with the Tin2 effector. This then links to transcriptional control of the phenolic metabolic pathways and is proposed to control a flux based defense system. The molecular analysis of the effector is very strong and detailed. However, I would argue that the novelty is not in the identification that an effector does something but instead in the analysis of phenolic metabolism. It is here that there needs to be work to bring the metabolic interpretation to the same strength as the molecular analysis of the effector."

This begins with the title that makes an explicit assumption of flux redirection and continues throughout. They have some evidence on the anthocyanins via the CHS mutant but don't have any evidence on the lignification theory. This is exemplified by their final sentence \u201cWe suggest that examples where biotic stress leads to anthocyanin induction should be revisited as the deployment of specific translocated effectors (like Tin2) to achieve metabolic rewiring may be a common strategy adopted by plant pathogenic microbes.\u201d Their data definitely shows that the effector rewires but it does not show that this rewiring is key. Given the data, it is completely possible that the anthocyanins are playing a direct role in the infection, which is in agreement with the other citations. To make the rewiring/flux arguments would require mutants in CAD or other lignin steps to show that these have the expected consequences."

The flux trade off is highly speculative. One way to support the model would be to determine whether high anthocyanin lines have lowered lignin content.

The reason for this is that the plants display the purple phenotype only when almost fully grown under natural light conditions.

Alternatively, ZmR1 may be generally unstable when localized in the cytosol of maize without Tin2. The fact that we detect ZmR1 in the cytosol without Tin2 in a few cells, may depend on higher expression levels in those cells. The number of molecules introduced cannot be controlled precisely when using biolistic bombardment for transient expression."
