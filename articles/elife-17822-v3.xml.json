Although category-selective spiking in PFC and PPC has been established, the frequency-dependent dynamic interactions of frontoparietal networks are largely unexplored. We trained monkeys to perform a delayed-match-to-spatial-category task while recording spikes and local field potentials from the PFC and PPC with multiple electrodes. We found category-selective beta- and delta-band synchrony between and within the areas. However, in addition to the categories, delta synchrony and spiking activity also reflected irrelevant stimulus dimensions. By contrast, beta synchrony only conveyed information about the task-relevant categories. Further, category-selective PFC neurons were synchronized with PPC beta oscillations, while neurons that carried irrelevant information were not. These results suggest that long-range beta-band synchrony could act as a filter that only supports neural representations of the variables relevant to the task at hand."

Human imaging studies have shown widespread frontal and parietal cortex activation during a broad range of cognitive demands (<a href=\"#bib16\">Duncan, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Fedorenko et al., 2013</a>). Likewise, there is an intermixing of neurons throughout frontal and parietal cortex that have neural correlates of different cognitive functions: attention, working memory, decision-making, rule-coding, and categorization (<a href=\"#bib1\">Andersen and Cui, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Buschman and Miller, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Crowe et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Freedman and Assad, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Goodwin et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Hayden and Pasternak, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Hussar and Pasternak, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Jacob and Nieder, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Merchant et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Rishel et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Salazar et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Vallentin et al., 2012</a>). These two regions not only have remarkable similarity in their patterns of neural activity, but they are also functionally interdependent. Deactivating one decreases neural activity in the other (<a href=\"#bib12\">Chafee and Goldman-Rakic, 2000</a>) and the temporal dynamics of neural information in one can mirror that of the other (<a href=\"#bib13\">Chafee and Goldman-Rakic, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Crowe et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Merchant et al., 2011</a>).

There is already evidence that frontoparietal rhythmic synchrony underlies at least two cognitive functions. Frequency-dependent increases in their synchrony have been seen during shifts of attention (<a href=\"#bib10\">Buschman and Miller, 2007</a>) and during visual working memory (<a href=\"#bib36\">Salazar et al., 2012</a>), functions long associated with both regions. More recently, single-neuron studies indicate that both areas also make a major contribution to visual categorization (<a href=\"#bib3\">Antzoulatos and Miller, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Cromer et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Crowe et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Freedman et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Freedman and Assad, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Goodwin et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Rishel et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Roy et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Swaminathan and Freedman, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Tsutsui et al., 2016</a>). Individual neurons in both areas carve up different types of sensory information (i.e., motion, shape, location) according to learned category boundaries. Further, the category information carried by neuron spiking in one area evolves in lock-step with the other (<a href=\"#bib15\">Crowe et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Goodwin et al., 2012</a>).

This type of match/non-match category decision has been shown to engage PFC and PPC neurons (<a href=\"#bib14\">Cromer et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Crowe et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Freedman et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Goodwin et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Roy et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Swaminathan and Freedman, 2012</a>).

The trial began when they held a bar and achieved fixation of a central target (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). The initial Above vs. Below category boundaries were indicated by two horizontal lines on each side of fixation, which divided the top from bottom halves of the screen. After the monkeys initiated the trial, the boundaries disappeared and a sample cue appeared briefly at a location chosen randomly from a set of 16 locations (\u00b1 a small jitter) on the right or left side of the screen (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>; 144 possible locations in total). After a 500 ms post-sample delay, the two horizontal lines reappeared at shifted positions. On half of the trials, the lines shifted clockwise (the left shifted up and the right shifted down by 4\u00a0degrees). On the other half of the trials, they shifted counter clockwise (the opposite). After an additional 1 s delay, a test stimulus appeared randomly at one of 624 possible locations (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). This test stimulus was a category match if it appeared on the same side of the (shifted) horizontal line (Above or Below) as the sample had appeared relative to the original horizontal line, irrespective of its exact location. If the test stimulus was a match, the monkey had to release the bar within 1 s (Go) to receive a juice reward. If the test was a non-match, the animals continued holding the bar (No-go) until another test stimulus (always a match) appeared on the screen. Note that the category of the initial sample cue did not change with the boundary shift. The boundary shift only changed which test stimulus locations would qualify as a category match or non-match. Thus, the purpose of the boundary shift was to ensure that the monkeys were encoding an abstract category representation, one that was not solely based on retinotopic coordinates. The monkeys also could not make a decision based solely on the proximity between sample and test stimuli because they could often be quite far apart (e.g., on the right and left of the screen; see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), yet still belong to the same category. Both monkeys performed the task quite well, with 92.77% of all trials (excluding fixation breaks) correct."

During fixation, in order to help the animal re-calibrate the Above/Below categorization boundary after the last trial, the 2 hemi-boundaries were also displayed. The sample stimulus appeared either above or below the horizontal meridian. To reduce the possibility of perceptual binding between the sample stimulus and the horizontal boundaries, there was a brief, 200 ms time gap between the two displays (pre-sample epoch). After the post-sample delay epoch, 2 hemi-boundaries were displayed at new locations, according to a CW (as shown) or CCW shift. The animal had to adjust the decision criterion based on the location of the new boundaries. When a test stimulus appeared, it had to be compared to the sample stimulus in a boundary-referenced, rather than a retinotopic, spatial frame. If a non-match, the first test would be followed by a second test, always a match to the sample category. Until display of a match test, the animal had to maintain visual fixation and contact with the bar. Upon a match test display, the animal had to release the bar for liquid reward. (<b>B</b>) Sample stimuli could appear randomly at any one of the 144 locations shown (top), with equal probability in the category Above or Below (DVA: degrees of visual angle). Test stimuli (equal probability for categories above and below the new boundaries) could appear at any one of the 624 locations shown (bottom). The continuous red horizontal lines in the test space indicate the position of hemi-boundaries after CW shift, and the dashed lines (dashed only for illustration) indicate the CCW shift. Each trial would test one of 89,856 possible sample-test combinations, equally distributed between match and non-match types.

Thus, just as we did for Above vs. Below, we computed the probability of the monkeys categorizing the sample as Left. This ranged from 0.39 to 0.57 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>), which is what we would expect if the monkeys were disregarding Left vs. Right (irrelevant dimension) and categorizing by Above vs. Below (relevant dimension). Thus, the monkeys were generalizing across diverse locations within the same category and not mistakenly categorizing the sample and test as being in different categories simply because they were far apart."

The AIP subregion of the posterior parietal cortex was selected because it is strongly coupled to premotor areas and plays a role in visuospatial transformations that guide motor movements (<a href=\"#bib45\">Verhoef et al., 2015</a>). Data from subareas of the lPFC (as\u00a0well\u00a0as subareas of the cPFC) were combined because they yielded similar results. To examine interactions between the areas, we analyzed simultaneously recorded LFPs from a total of 159 electrodes in AIP, 111 electrodes in cPFC, and 129 electrodes in lPFC. From the LFP we first removed stimulus-evoked components (to isolate the task-induced oscillations), and decomposed it in the frequency domain using the Morlet wavelet. The LFP was decomposed in six octaves (from 2\u2013128 Hz), at a resolution of 0.1 octave. From the amplitude of the wave components we then computed the LFP time- and frequency-dependent power and normalized it to 1/frequency (in order to correct the power-law decay of the LFP power spectrum). Removing the LFP components that are phase-locked to the stimulus may conceal high-frequency rhythms time-locked to stimulus presentation, but it is necessary to avoid spurious synchrony due to simultaneous stimulus-evoked responses in the LFPs."

Synchrony was bias-corrected by subtracting the chance-level PPC, as estimated from a surrogate dataset. For every pair of electrodes, the surrogate dataset was created by randomly shuffling the trials of each electrode independently of the other\u00a0electrode 200 times without replacement. The PPC that was computed across these random permutations was averaged and provided the baseline-level synchrony that would be expected by chance. The pattern of synchrony largely paralleled the spectral power results. Beta band synchrony was evident within the areas (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>; AIP-AIP: n\u00a0=\u00a0340 pairs of electrodes; cPFC-cPFC: n\u00a0=\u00a0205 pairs; lPFC-lPFC: n\u00a0=\u00a0290 pairs) and between areas (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>; AIP-cPFC: n\u00a0=\u00a0474 pairs; cPFC-lPFC: n\u00a0=\u00a0323 pairs; AIP-lPFC: n\u00a0=\u00a0535 pairs). A 2-way ANOVA compared synchrony as a function of area pairing and trial epoch.

Every electrode pair\u2019s category preference was determined from the polarity of the difference Above-Below.

The directional changes from baseline were mixed (although all were statistically significant), but the trend was for the beta-band synchrony during the Category epoch (i.e., the epoch that indicated stronger selectivity in beta synchrony; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>) to increase from baseline for the preferred category and to decrease from baseline for the non-preferred category.

In the other two epochs (when synchrony selectivity was weaker; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>) synchrony of both the beta and delta rhythms was decreased from baseline, albeit to a smaller extent for their preferred than for\u00a0their non-preferred category."

After all, receptive fields in both the frontal and parietal cortex are strongly biased to the contralateral field. However, when we re-sorted the trials based on whether the sample cue appeared in the left vs. right hemifields, there was virtually no selectivity in beta synchrony (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B and C</a>). Thus, category-selective synchrony mirrored the demands of the task: To encode the Above vs. Below category of the sample, irrespective of Right vs. Left."

However, there was virtually no selective beta synchrony for the (task-irrelevant) Right vs. Left hemifield location of the sample cue. By contrast, the spiking of single neurons was sensitive to the Right vs. Left location of the sample. This is shown in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C and D</a>. The average population activity of all three areas showed significant selectivity for Right vs. Left early on during sample display, albeit weaker than the learned Above vs. Below categories.

For each pair of electrodes we first averaged the category selectivity (i.e., the data plotted in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>) of LFP synchrony separately and the Category and Shift epochs. Then, we identified the electrode pairs that showed the strongest 10% of selectivity in beta synchrony in each epoch. We computed spike-field synchrony between them, using the same method that we previously used to examine frontostriatal interactions (<a href=\"#bib2\">Antzoulatos and Miller, 2014</a>). A phase-locking value (PLV) between spikes and LFPs (see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods) indicated whether spikes in one area are more likely to occur at specific LFP phases from an electrode in other areas. Because this metric can show spurious synchrony if the number of spikes is small (<a href=\"#bib2\">Antzoulatos and Miller, 2014</a>), we took two mitigating measures. First, we pooled together all the spikes from isolated neurons that were recorded from each electrode, thus maximizing the number of spikes in each electrode. Second, we transformed the PLV to a z score based on 200 random permutations of the LFP. By keeping each trial\u2019s series of spikes and permuting only the LFP trace we were able to evaluate the levels of spike-LFP PLV that arose solely from the number and temporal pattern of the spikes. We first focused on the Category epoch because that is where we observed the strongest category-selective synchrony of beta oscillations (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>)."

As the superposition indicates, the cPFC spikes tended to appear at the same phase of the LFP oscillation, namely the downstroke of the LFP cycle. Average results from all pairs of spikesand LFPs during the Category epoch are shown in panels B-D of <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a> for each combination of areas (i.e., cPFC-AIP: n\u00a0=\u00a047 pairs, lPFC-AIP: n\u00a0=\u00a054, and cPFC-lPFC: n\u00a0=\u00a032). The dots indicate when the PLV between spikes in one area and LFPs in the other were significantly greater than the other way around (2-tailed t-test, p&lt;0.05). As can be seen from this figure, significant spike-LFP synchrony was between cPFC spikes and AIP LFPs, with a peak at 30 Hz (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). This synchrony was asymmetric: there was significantly stronger phase-coupling of cPFC spikes to AIP LFP oscillations in the 22\u201332 Hz band (0.006\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.002) than the other way around (\u22120.001\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.001; phase-coupling of cPFC oscillations to AIP spikes, t-test: p=0.004). This asymmetry was more pronounced for the category Below than Above (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). No frequency-dependent spike-LFP synchrony was observed between lPFC spikes and AIP LFPs or the reverse (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>).

In fact, synchrony of cPFC spikes to AIP LFPs was significant for spikes with Above/Below selectivity (n\u00a0=\u00a054 spike-LFP pairs, 0.01\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.002, t-test comparison to zero, p=1.7\u00d710<sup>\u20136</sup>), but not different from zero for spikes with Right/Left selectivity (n\u00a0=\u00a044 spike-LFP pairs, \u22120.003\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.002, p=0.98).

Different pairs of recording sites, both within and between the prefrontal cortex and parietal cortex, showed category selectivity, that is, increased LFP synchrony for one or the other category, primarily in the beta but also in the delta band. Thus, each category was accompanied by different network patterns of synchrony. Prefrontal spikes were synchronized to parietal LFP beta rhythms, but parietal spikes were not synchronized to prefrontal rhythms. This suggests a unidirectional influence with the PFC influencing the parietal cortex. Finally, we found that prefrontal neural spiking selective for the task-relevant Above vs. Below category dimension was synchronized with the parietal beta rhythms, but spiking that reflected the task-irrelevant Right vs Left dimension was not."

Our finding of category-selective patterns of increased synchrony between recording sites in the frontoparietal cortex supports this. It adds to previous reports of content-specific patterns of oscillatory synchrony in these circuits (and beyond). For example, there is object-selective synchrony between the prefrontal and parietal cortex for different objects held in working memory (<a href=\"#bib36\">Salazar et al., 2012</a>) and within the prefrontal cortex for different behavioral rules (<a href=\"#bib9\">Buschman et al., 2012</a>). Further, category-selective patterns of synchrony develop between the prefrontal cortex and striatum in parallel with category learning (<a href=\"#bib2\">Antzoulatos and Miller, 2014</a>). These \u2018rhythmic ensembles\u2019 do not seem to be limited to circuits involving the prefrontal cortex. Selective synchrony of gamma rhythms between V4 and V1 has been reported to guide attentional selection in primates (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bosman et al., 2012</a>). A recent study in humans suggests functional networks across the cortex are formed by harmonic patterns constrained by known anatomy (<a href=\"#bib4\">Atasoy et al., 2016</a>). In other words, it seems as if anatomy (the connectome) may be the infrastructure that determines which functional circuits can potentially form. Which circuits do form from moment to moment may be regulated, at least in part, by patterns of synchrony. To use an analogy: Anatomy is the roads, activity is the traffic, and rhythmic synchrony is the traffic lights."

This is noteworthy because there is increasing evidence that beta-band synchrony may play a role in sustained top-down, or feedback, signaling in the cortex (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bastos et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Engel and Fries, 2010</a>). In line with this is our observation that category selectivity was more \u2018pure\u2019 in synchrony (especially in the beta band) than for spiking activity. While beta synchrony was selective for the task relevant categories, we could not detect any (irrelevant) information about the left vs. right hemifield location of the sample cue in beta synchrony. By contrast, left vs. right was detectable in neural spike rates. Of course, selectivity of spiking rate and LFP synchrony are two different phenomena, which rely on different measures and analyses. Thus, this difference could merely reflect differences in the ability to detect information in them. But it is also possible that beta synchrony is more selective. Beta synchrony may provide an additional level of filtering beyond that seen in spiking activity. Because of its putative role in feedback processing in the cortex, it may only pass back top-down information to other cortical areas. Support for this also comes from our finding that only the prefrontal spiking activity that conveyed task-relevant information was synchronized to the parietal beta rhythms. By contrast, for pairs of recording sites with category-selective beta synchrony, we did not detect any synchrony between parietal spikes with prefrontal oscillations. This all suggests a top-down influence from the PFC to parietal cortex."

Trials began when the animal held a bar and maintained visual fixation on a central target for 1 s. The fixation target was a red square (0.25-degree side), flanked on the right and left side with 2 white horizontal lines of 0.2-degree thickness and 6-degree length. These lines, each of which had a 2-degree gap from the fixation target (the allowable fixation window had a 1.5-degree radius), were only displayed for the 1 s duration of the fixation window, in order to help the animals re-calibrate the division between upper/lower visual hemifields after the previous trial. The sample stimulus was displayed on the screen 200 ms after the lines had been turned off (the fixation target stayed on the screen for the duration of the trial and the animals were required to maintain fixation throughout). Sample stimuli were circular white dots (0.2-degree radius), the location of which was selected randomly from 16 possible locations (four in each visual quadrant), plus a random jitter of\u00a0\u00b10.5 degree on each axis. Overall, the sample could appear in any one of 144 distinct locations, spanning an area of 170 degrees<sup>2</sup>. No samples were displayed inside the animals\u2019 spatial window of fixation. Sample display lasted for 800 ms and was followed by a 500 ms delay interval, during which only the fixation target appeared on the screen. Up to this point of the trial the animals were required to determine whether the sample had appeared in the upper or lower visual hemifield (i.e., category Above or Below) and hold the sample category in working memory. At the end of the delay interval, the two white horizontal lines (hemi-boundaries) re-appeared at new locations. A clockwise (CW) or counter-clockwise (CCW) shift was randomly selected on each trial. A CW shift meant that the left hemi-boundary appeared 4 degrees above the horizontal meridian and the right hemi-boundary appeared 4 degrees below the horizontal meridian. A CCW shift was implemented in the reverse way. During the 1 s interval following the new boundary display, the animals were required to adjust the category decision criterion. Note that the new location of the boundaries <i>did not change the sample category.</i> Rather, it only changed the <i>spatial area</i> that corresponded to that category. After the boundary shift, the new retinotopic spatial area of the Above/Below categories overlapped with the pre-shift retinotopic area by only 50%. Because of this, test stimuli that were very close to the sample location could potentially be a non-match to the sample category, and test stimuli far away from the sample location could potentially be a match to the sample category."

If the test stimulus matched the category of the sample stimulus (Above or Below the hemi-boundaries), the animals had to release the bar before the end of its display for liquid reward. If it did not match the sample category, the animals were required to maintain contact with the bar and visual fixation for another 0.5 s following the test, when a second test would appear on the screen. The second test would always be a match and the animals would release the bar for reward."

Electrodes from both arrays were acutely lowered every day of recording, either individually or in pairs, at depths that were guided both by the MRI images (to target the areas of interest) and the success in isolating neural spiking activity. This method of multi-electrode/multi-area recording allowed us to: (a) sample neural signals from relatively large surface areas (each array covered up to 250 mm<sup>2</sup>, with electrodes that could be no closer than 1 mm from each other), (b) sample neural signals from different sets of locations every day of recording, (c) evaluate the real-time cross-area dynamic interactions in the frequency and time domains, and (d) make cross-area comparisons of neural processing under identical experimental conditions."

Area 8A, extending from the caudal end of the principal sulcus up to the arcuate sulcus, also includes the frontal eye field (FEF). Results from the FEF in isolation were similar to the results from the rest of area 8A, and were pooled together in the cPFC group. In addition, results from area 45 were similar to those from area 46 and pooled together in the lPFC group.

The LFPs were subsequently downsampled at 333 Hz, and centered on the cross-trial mean. The latter processing step reduced the amplitude of stimulus-evoked potentials and helped isolate the trial-induced oscillations. The LFPs were then decomposed to their spectral components using a Matlab-based wavelet analysis toolbox (<a href=\"#bib40\">Torrence and Compo, 1998</a>; offered at the URL: <a href=\"http://atoc.colorado.edu/research/wavelets/\">http://atoc.colorado.edu/research/wavelets/</a>), through their convolution with a Morlet wavelet, at six octaves (from 2 Hz to 128 Hz) at a 0.1- octave resolution. Quantification of LFP-LFP synchrony (pairwise phase consistency) relied on the Matlab-based toolbox FieldTrip (<a href=\"#bib32\">Oostenveld et al., 2011</a>). Finally, spike-LFP synchrony was quantified as the single-trial phase-locking value (PLV), which measures the angular concentration of the frequency-specific instantaneous phases of the LFP at the time of spikes (<a href=\"#bib2\">Antzoulatos and Miller, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Siegel et al., 2009</a>). For illustration purposes, the group-averaged data were smoothed with kernels of FWHM less than 0.5 octave and/or 100 ms. All statistical analyses were performed on unsmoothed data using Matlab, and corrections for multiple comparisons followed the Bonferroni method. Unless noted, group data are reported as average \u00b1 SEM."

The authors recorded both spiking activity and the LFPs and revealed category-selective synchrony of \u03b2-band oscillations that were selective for task-relevant information. Although category-selective frontoparietal synchrony was also observed in the \u03b4 band, this synchrony was present for both task-relevant and the task-irrelevant information. The data suggest that while spiking activity in the prefrontal cortex showed selectivity for both relevant and irrelevant information, only neurons with task relevant information were synchronized with the parietal \u03b2 rhythms. The authors conclude that the synchrony of long-range \u03b2 rhythms may support only the representation of task variables that are relevant to the category decision."
