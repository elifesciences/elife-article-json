GHRH knockout mice are remarkably long-lived, exhibiting major shifts in the expression of genes related to xenobiotic detoxification, stress resistance, and insulin signaling. These mutant mice also have increased adiponectin levels and alterations in glucose homeostasis consistent with the removal of the counter-insulin effects of growth hormone. While these effects overlap with those of caloric restriction, we show that the effects of caloric restriction (CR) and the GHRH mutation are additive, with lifespan of GHRH-KO mutants further increased by CR. We conclude that GHRH-KO mice feature perturbations in a network of signaling pathways related to stress resistance, metabolic control and inflammation, and therefore provide a new model that can be used to explore links between GHRH repression, downregulation of the somatotropic axis, and extended longevity."

GHRH knockout mice are remarkably long-lived, exhibiting major shifts in the expression of genes related to xenobiotic detoxification, stress resistance, and insulin signaling. These mutant mice also have increased adiponectin levels and alterations in glucose homeostasis consistent with the removal of the counter-insulin effects of growth hormone. While these effects overlap with those of caloric restriction, we show that the effects of caloric restriction (CR) and the GHRH mutation are additive, with lifespan of GHRH-KO mutants further increased by CR. We conclude that GHRH-KO mice feature perturbations in a network of signaling pathways related to stress resistance, metabolic control and inflammation, and therefore provide a new model that can be used to explore links between GHRH repression, downregulation of the somatotropic axis, and extended longevity."

For example, mutations in the insulin/Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) signaling can robustly increase longevity in the nematode <i>C. elegans</i> (<a href=\"#bib20\">Kenyon, 2010</a>), whereas in mouse, disruptions in growth hormone (GH) pathway dramatically prolong lifespan (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bartke, 2011</a>)."

A number of aging-related phenotypes are also delayed in these mice, including collagen cross-linking, cataract development, kidney diseases, fatal neoplastic diseases and decline in immune function, locomotor activity, learning and memory (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bartke, 2011</a>). In these models, homozygous mutation of either Prop1 or Pit1 genes cause an abnormal development of the anterior pituitary, which in turn leads to decline in production of GH, thyrotropin (TSH), and prolactin (PRL), with consequent decrease in circulating IGF-I and thyroxine levels (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bartke, 2011</a>). The specific contribution of GH signaling to lifespan extension in these systems is supported by studies of downstream pathway elements. For instance, mice with disruption of the GH receptor (Ghr\u2212/\u2212) have also markedly increased lifespan with concomitant delay of late life diseases and disabilities (<a href=\"#bib11\">Coschigano et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">List et al., 2011</a>). These findings support the hypothesis that dampening of the GH pathway is the key contributor to lifespan extension in mice. Nevertheless, the associated lack of TSH and prolactin makes these two models less than optimal in conclusively exclude the influence of the lack of these hormones on the delayed aging phenotype."

In rodents, CR delays the onset of cancer, atherosclerosis, and diabetes, and typically increases lifespan (by 15% in mice and by 30% in rats) (<a href=\"#bib44\">Swindell, 2012</a>). Although this phenomenon was first described over 70 years ago, the molecular basis mediating the effects of CR on the aging process remains incompletely understood. Intriguingly, phenotypic characteristics of the long-lived mutant mice with disrupted GH axis overlap with some effects of CR, suggesting possible mechanistic connections. Shared characteristics include: (a) small body size; (b) reduced blood glucose and increased insulin sensitivity; and (c) reduced or absent levels of various hormones and growth factors, that is, GH, insulin, and IGF-I; (d) delaying and/or suppression of the occurrence of several age-related diseases. Nevertheless, longevity phenotypes in different mouse models may rely on CR-sensitive pathways to varying degrees. For instance, 30% CR confers additional life extension in Ames dwarf mice (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bartke, 2011</a>), but has no additional effect on longevity in male Ghr\u2212/\u2212 mice, and only a modest reduction of late-life mortality in Ghr\u2212/\u2212 females (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bonkowski et al., 2006</a>)."

We provide a phenotypic, metabolic and molecular-level characterization of GHRH-KO mice and show that GHRH-KO mutants exhibit lifespan extension comparable to the Ames and Snell dwarf mice. Moreover, we have shown that, in contrast with the Ghr\u2212/\u2212 mice, lifespan in GHRH-KO mice is further extended by CR. These findings established the GHRH-KO mice as a novel rodent model for delayed aging and implicate CR-independent mechanisms in longevity assurance."

The RQ varies inversely with lipid oxidation. A higher fasting RQ, which indicates lowered fat oxidation, is linked to body weight gain, metabolic inflexibility and insulin resistance (<a href=\"#bib59\">Zurlo et al., 1990</a>). The KO mice had a significantly decreased RQ compared to their wild-type controls during both the dark and light periods under normal housing conditions (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>), although their oxygen consumption per gram of body weight (measured by VO2) was not different from controls (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Interestingly, on measures of spontaneous home cage activity (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>), KO mice were significantly more active than their wild-type counterparts."

Of 15 such phase I mRNAs evaluated, 10 were found to be elevated in liver of KO mice, and seven of these were dramatically elevated compared to controls (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). In contrast, most of the hepatic phase II genes were modestly increased in GHRH-KO mice (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). However, <i>Sult2a2</i>, the gene increased most strongly in microarray screening, was shown by RT-PCR to be elevated by more than 1000-fold in KO mice (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Surprisingly, expression of phase I and II genes was similar in small intestine of KO and control mice, suggesting that the effect of GH on these genes may be liver-specific."

To determine whether GH replacement also influences the expression of hepatic xenobiotic genes, we evaluated each of these mRNAs in liver of <i>Ames</i> dwarf mice that had been exposed to GH replacement for a period of 6 weeks. As shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, consistent with the pattern in GHRH-KO mice, hepatic expression of these genes was robustly elevated in <i>Ames</i> dwarf mice compared to their littermate controls (p&lt;0.01). GH-treatment of these mutant mice dramatically suppressed the elevation of these genes including <i>Cyp2b9, Cyp2b10, Cyp4a14, Fmo3</i> and <i>Sult2a2</i> (two-tailed <i>t</i> test; p&lt;0.01) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>), but had no effect on housekeeping control genes.

Differences in the genetic background of GHRH-KO mice and <i>Ames</i> dwarf, <i>Snell</i> dwarf, and <i>Ghr</i>\u2212/\u2212 mice used in previous studies in different laboratories make it difficult to determine whether absence of GHRH, GH or their receptors have quantitatively similar or differential impacts on longevity.

Consistent with this notion, insulin sensitivity is also improved in the GHRH-KO mice, further supporting that this is a key contributor of lifespan extension of mice. We suspect that at least some of the gene expression responses observed in hepatic tissue of GHRH-KO mice can be attributed to enhanced insulin signaling. For instance, the GHRH-KO-increased genes we identified included Sox4 and Vcam1, each of which have been associated with response to glucose stimulus.

Our evaluation of changes in hepatic gene expression profiles and stress response pathways also points toward this direction. For instance, several of the genes with increased expression in GHRH-KO liver were associated with the GO biological process term \u2018cellular response to stress\u2019 (e.g., Blm, Ccnd1, Dclre1a, Ddx1, Gpx3, Il1rn, Krt20, Morf4l2, Ppargc1a, Prpf19, Rtn4, Slc2a1, Sox4 and Vldlr).

However, whether Nrf2 can contribute to the mammalian aging and affect lifespan remains undemonstrated. Intriguingly, as revealed by our microarray comparison, liver-specific Keap1 knockout mice have increased resistance to hepatic stressor acetaminophen and exhibit a very similar hepatic gene expression pattern to the one of GHRH-KO mice (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib27\">Okawa et al., 2006</a>).

Resembling findings in Ames dwarf mice (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bartke et al., 2001</a>), CR produced a further significant extension of longevity in both sexes of GHRH-KO animals. In contrast to these findings, in GH resistant Ghr\u2212/\u2212 mice, CR does not alter longevity of males and produces only a small, although statistically significant reduction of late mortality in females (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bonkowski et al., 2006</a>). Relating these differential responses to CR to the impact of these mutations on insulin levels lends support to our hypothesis that suppression of insulin levels is an important mechanism of life extension by CR. Indeed CR has no or little impact on longevity of animals in which insulin levels are already profoundly suppressed (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bonkowski et al., 2006</a>). However, we cannot exclude that differences in the genetic background of animals could also partially explain these differences."

A most recent study has shown that overexpressing FGF21 in mice prolongs lifespan dramatically (<a href=\"#bib58\">Zhang et al., 2012</a>). Furthermore, Fgf21 Tg and CR-fed mice show similarity with respect to their hepatic gene expression profiles (<a href=\"#bib58\">Zhang et al., 2012</a>). For these reasons, FGF21 is speculated to increase longevity by partially mimicking the effect of CR in liver and potentially other tissues. In previous studies, however, CR did not induce transcription of hepatic FGF21, nor did CR alter levels of FGF21 in circulation (<a href=\"#bib36\">Sharma et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Zhang et al., 2012</a>). Intriguingly, our data show that long-term (over 12 months) 40% CR profoundly suppressed hepatic FGF21 mRNA and plasma FGF21 concentrations in both GHRH-KO and control mice. This result differs from previous studies, potentially due to differences in mouse strains or the use of short-term CR in earlier work.

Moreover, our hepatic transcriptome analysis has revealed pretty good overlap in genes affected by GHRH deletion and FGF21 overexpression (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Thus, our results further support the idea that FGF21 longevity effect is likely mediated by the GH signaling.

Standard Affymetrix quality control metrics were calculated for each hybridization, including the percentage of probe sets with signals detected above background (i.e., percent present), global RNA degradation score, average background, intensity scale factor, and four measures derived from the fitting of probe-level models (RLE median, RLE IQR, NUSE median and NUSE IQR). Hierarchical cluster analysis was also performed to identify potential outliers. All chips were retained for further analyses based upon these quality control evaluations. Expression scores were calculated for each chip using robust multichip average (RMA). The Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0features a total of 45101 probe sets; however, we removed 19956 from consideration since they were not significantly expressed above background in any of the six array hybridizations (Wilxon signed rank test as implemented in the MAS 5.0 algorithm). Our analysis was thus based upon 25145 probe sets with expression significantly above background in at least one of the six hybridizations (13201 unique mouse genes). Probe sets showing increased or decreased expression were identified using empirical Bayes methods as implemented in the limma software package (R Bioconductor). An FDR correction for multiple hypotheses testing among all probe sets was performed using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure. Since the Mouse Genome 430 2.0 includes some \u2018sibling\u2019 probe sets that target mRNAs associated with the same gene, we limited redundancy in our results by considering only the most significantly altered probe set associated with a given gene (i.e., the probe set with the lowest p value). Overall, we identified 365 genes differentially expressed between GHRH-KO mice and normal littermates (141 increased and 164 decreased genes; FDR &lt; 0.05 with fold-change &gt;1.5 or &lt;0.67). With respect to these gene sets, we tested for significantly overrepresented Gene Ontology and KEGG terms using a conditional hyper-geometric test as implemented in the GOstats package (R Bioconductor). For these analyses, significant overrepresentation was assessed relative to a background gene set that included only the 12836 liver-expressed genes not identified as differentially expressed. Enrichment of motifs in regions upstream of differentially expressed genes was evaluated by screening a dictionary of 1291 motifs associated with DNA-binding proteins, which had been assembled by pooling motifs available from the Jaspar, UniPROBE and Transfac databases. Motif enrichment in regions upstream of differentially expressed genes was assessed using semi parametric generalized additive logistic regression models (<a href=\"#bib44\">Swindell, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Swindell et al., 2012</a>).

This yielded an initial set of 1259 motifs, which were then filtered to exclude repetitive motifs or any motifs fewer than four base pairs in length, yielding the final set of 1209 motifs (<a href=\"#bib47\">Swindell et al., 2013</a>). For each mouse gene, we retrieved the 2 kb upstream region based upon coordinates provided in UCSC ref gene files and sequences available from Bioconductor (package: BSgenome. Mmusculus.UCSC.mm10). Upstream sequences for all mouse genes were scanned for matches to each of the 1209 motifs, respectively (with masking of protein-coding sequences and repetitive DNA elements). Motif matches were identified using the \u2018matchPWM\u2019 function (R package: Biostrings), with an 80% match threshold, that is, a motif match was counted if the position weight matrix (PWM) similarity score exceeded 80% of the maximum score for that PWM. For each mouse gene, this yielded counts for each PWM indicating the frequency of motif matches in 2 kb upstream regions. The same procedure was applied to determine if motifs were enriched with respect to the 141 GHRH-KO-increased genes and the 164 GHRH-KO-decreased genes, respectively. To assess whether GHRH-KO-increased genes were enriched with respect to the number of occurrences for a given motif, for example, we used semi parametric generalized additive logistic regression models (<a href=\"#bib47\">Swindell et al., 2013</a>). For these models, the response variable was an indicator with value 1 if a gene was included among the 141 GHRH-KO-increased, and with value 0 if the gene was not included among the 141 GHRH-KO-increased. Only liver-expressed genes were included in the analysis. Models included two predictor variables, including the number of motif occurrences in the 2 kb upstream region (x1) and the length of sequence scanned (x2). The variable x1 was estimated using parametric methods, while x2 was included as a non-parametric term with cublic spline smoothing. To assess motif enrichment, we evaluated the significance of the Z statistic associated with the coefficient estimate obtained forx1. Models of this structure were generated for each of the 1209 motifs. To control the false discovery rate with respect to the 1209 tests, p values associated with Z statistics were adjusted using the Benjamini\u2013Hochberg method."

This system uses zirconia, infrared sensors and light beams arrays to monitor oxygen (VO2), carbon dioxide (VCO2), and spontaneous locomotor activity, respectively inside respiratory chambers in which individual mice were tested. All comparisons are based on animals studied simultaneously in eight different chambers connected to the same O2, CO2 and light beam sensors in an effort to minimize the effect of environmental variations and calibration on data. After a 24-hr acclimation period, mice were monitored in the metabolic chambers for 24 hr with ad libitum access to standard chow (Laboratory Diet 5001) and water. Gas samples were collected and analyzed every 5 min per animal, and the data were averaged for each hour."

They show a major lifespan extension in GHRH-KO mice, comparable to that of GHR-KO mice. Also, they show that GHRH-KO mice are insulin sensitive. Among the possible protective mechanism presented for GHRH-KO is the decreased activity of S6K and the increased expression of xenobiotic genes. This is a very interesting paper that serves as a major and important extension of what has been shown for GHR-KO and GH deficiency. These data provide conclusive evidence that the GHRH-GH-GHR axis is the most potent pro-aging pathway discovered in mammals."

In addition, it is not clear why the genes involved in xenobiotic metabolism are so important in mice that are not exposed to any xenobiotics. Is there any indication from the literature for why these genes may be important in the absence of toxic environments? This should be discussed."

The remarkable magnitude of the longevity extension in GHRH-KO mice may be related in some ways to the relatively short lifespan of normal animals from this strain, approximately 21 months, as compared to approximately 24 months in normal siblings of Ames dwarfs and approximately 29 months in normal siblings on GHR<sup>-/-</sup> mice in our colonies (<a href=\"#bib10\">Brown-Borg et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Bartke et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Bonkowski et al., 2006</a>). Studies in GHR<sup>-/-</sup> mice from Dr. Kopchick\u2019s laboratory and in our laboratory indicate that the presence of a significant extension of lifespan in animals lacking GH signals does not depend on genetic background (three different backgrounds were tested, two mixed and one inbred). However, the magnitude of this effect tends to be reduced in a long-lived strain (<a href=\"#bib11\">Coschigano et al., 2003</a>). Differences in the genetic background of GHRH-KO mice and Ames dwarf, Snell dwarf, GHR<sup>-/-</sup>, and little mice used in previous studies and different laboratories make it difficult to determine whether absence of GHRH, GH or their receptors have quantitatively similar or differential impacts on mouse lifespan. These comparisons are further complicated by differences between the diets used in different laboratories. These considerations are now discussed in the revised manuscript."

We feel that this more closely resembles the genetic constitution of animals in nature and also human populations, and thus we believe that our findings are more generalizable (or \u201ctranslatable\u201d) than data obtained in a single inbred strain. A similar strategy is well employed in the National Institute on Aging's Interventions Testing Program (ITP) (Harrison et al., 2009; Miller et al., 2007)."

We have performed the suggested experiments to compare the phosphorylation status of ribosomal protein S6 in skeletal muscle and white adipose tissue in GHRH-KO and control mice. The new data (now in <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2013figure supplement 1</a>) have shown that adipose S6 phosphorylation is significantly reduced in GHRH-KO mice compared to controls, whereas there is no significant difference in muscle S6 phosphorylation between the two genotypes. These results imply that the inactivation of S6K in GHRH-KO mice might be tissue-specific."

We have preserved carcasses of these animals for histopathological studies and our collaborator will analyze these materials. However, these pathology studies will require a great deal of time to complete and thus we will need to include these results in a future manuscript. Nevertheless, extrapolating from findings in other long-lived mutants with reduced somatotropic signaling, we suspect that reduced incidence and/or delayed onset of cancer may have been involved. This is now mentioned in the revised manuscript."

Afterward, body weight of N-AL animals began to exhibit a decline, which is normally seen during the final phase of life. The average body weights at advanced age may also have been influenced by deaths of some of the animals, especially in the N-AL group. The age-related decline of body weight in the N-CR group was delayed and diminished, as would be expected from the impact of CR on aging and longevity. The net result was that after the age of approximately 80 weeks, body weights of N-AL and N-CR males began to gradually converge. This is now stated in the manuscript."

In parallel, we also performed Resorufin conversion assay to measure cytochromeP450 enzymatic activity in liver tissues.

However, the mechanisms underlying activation of xenobiotic metabolism genes in the absence of environmental toxins remain unknown. Some studies have shown elevation of bile acids (as potential endogenous xenobiotics) level and altered bile acid metabolism in GH deficient mice (<a href=\"#bib3\">Amador-Noguez et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Amador-Noguez et al., 2007</a>). Moreover, several GH-mediated transcriptional factors, including Nrf-2, STAT 5b, and hepatic nuclear factor (HNF) 4alpha, have been shown to play an important role in xenobiotic gene expressions (<a href=\"#bib53\">Waxman and Holloway, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Wu et al., 2012</a>). Thus, we postulate that activation of xenobiotic metabolism pathways, presumably through inhibition of GH signaling and alterations of the corresponding transcriptional factors, protects the tissues from the damaging effects of endogenous and exogenous molecules and thus contributes to maintaining tissue and metabolic homeostasis during aging. We have added this information to the Discussion section of our paper."
