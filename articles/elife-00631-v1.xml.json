In this analogy, epistasis constrains evolution, with some mutations tolerated only after the occurrence of others. To test whether epistasis similarly constrains actual protein evolution, we created all intermediates along a 39-mutation evolutionary trajectory of influenza nucleoprotein, and also introduced each mutation individually into the parent. Several mutations were deleterious to the parent despite becoming fixed during evolution without negative impact. These mutations were destabilizing, and were preceded or accompanied by stabilizing mutations that alleviated their adverse effects. The constrained mutations occurred at sites enriched in T-cell epitopes, suggesting they promote viral immune escape. Our results paint a coherent portrait of epistasis during nucleoprotein evolution, with stabilizing mutations permitting otherwise inaccessible destabilizing mutations which are sometimes of adaptive value."

To test whether all of these mutations could have been tolerated by the 1968 virus, Gong et al. introduced each one individually into the 1968 nucleoprotein. They found that several mutations greatly reduced the fitness of the 1968 virus when introduced on their own, which strongly suggests that these \u2018constrained mutations\u2019 became part of the virus\u2019s genetic makeup as a result of interactions with \u2018enabling\u2019 mutations."

One of the simplest types of epistasis is that which occurs between mutations within a single protein. That such epistasis is common has long been considered self-evident\u2013for example, in their seminal 1965 analysis of protein evolution, Emile Zuckerkandl and Linus Pauling wrote, \u201cOf course \u2026 the functional effect of a given single substitution will frequently depend on the presence or absence of a number of other substitutions (<a href=\"#bib55\">Zuckerkandl and Pauling, 1965</a>).\u201d But although numerous laboratory evolution and site-directed mutagenesis experiments have demonstrated that mutations can in principle exhibit strong epistatic interactions (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bershtein et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Bloom et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Lunzer et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Salverda et al., 2011</a>), surprisingly little is known about the actual role of epistasis in natural protein evolution. A few studies have reconstructed naturally occurring mutations involved in antibiotic resistance or steroid-receptor ligand specificity (<a href=\"#bib50\">Wang et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Weinreich et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Ortlund et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Bridgham et al., 2009</a>) and found strong epistatic interactions. However, these studies have focused on small numbers of mutations pre-selected for analysis due to their putative adaptive role, and in most cases the actual temporal order of mutations is unknown."

While this experimental strategy is not guaranteed to find every possible epistatic interaction, it will systematically identify all mutations that have different effects in the original parent and the evolutionary intermediates in which they actually occurred. The experimental strategy in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> also offers the possibility of determining how epistatically interacting mutations were actually fixed\u2014for example through sequential functional intermediates as posited by Maynard Smith, or by the simultaneous or closely coupled fixation of several individually deleterious mutations (<a href=\"#bib25\">Kimura, 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Meer et al., 2010</a>)."

Summarizing these graph samples effectively integrates over uncertainty in the tree and substitution process, and yields the marginal posterior distribution of the evolutionary trajectory from Aichi/1968 to Brisbane/2007 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). The most probable trajectory consists of 39 mutational steps at 33 sites (5 mutations revert; 1 site mutates to two identities).

In each plot, the activity is normalized relative to that observed for the parental Aichi/1968 NP in that polymerase background, and so the different panels have y-axis units that cannot be compared across panels. The NP plasmid amount is the same (50 ng) in all three backgrounds, but note that although this makes the readings at the middle of the dose-response curve for the Nanchang/1995 polymerase background (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), this may not be true for the other polymerase backgrounds.

However, full rescue of viral growth also requires E375G. E375G is destabilizing, and alone does not rescue growth or activity of R384G. We hypothesize that rescue of growth of R384G requires two events. The first is counteraction of NP destabilization. The second is some effect specific to E375G that is apparent in growth but not transcriptional activity. E375G (which causes loss of a negative charge) counterbalances the loss of a positive charge due to R384G. The image shows an electrostatic surface (PyMol, PDB 2IQH). R384 and E375 are on the same surface, contributing positive and negative charges. Mutating both to neutral glycine maintains the net charge. Perhaps the charge of this surface is important for interaction with other protein partners late in the life cycle (after RNA transcription), explaining why E375G is important for growth but not activity."

The parent Aichi/1968 is only marginally more stable than the minimal threshold where activity and viral growth begin to suffer. For this reason, the three destabilizing mutations L259S, R384G, and V280A are highly deleterious to Aichi/1968. During NP\u2019s evolution, stability fluctuates as the protein fixes stabilizing and destabilizing mutations. Each of the three destabilizing mutations that we identified as being under epistatic constraint is closely associated with a stabilizing mutation. The stabilizing M136I preceded the destabilizing V280A, and provided a stability cushion to eliminate V280A\u2019s otherwise deleterious effect (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4C, 7C</a>). The stabilizing S259L preceded the destabilizing R384G, and was necessary (in conjunction with E375G) to alleviate R384G\u2019s otherwise deleterious effect (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4B, 7C</a>).

These three destabilizing mutations are thus disproportionately important for viral immune escape, and may have been favored by selection for this property (a dN/dS test [<a href=\"#bib33\">Murrell et al., 2013</a>] is inconclusive, probably due to lack of sequence data; <a href=\"#fig8s3\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 3</a> and <a href=\"#SD8-data\">Figure 8\u2014source code 2</a>).

We identified three mutations that are strongly deleterious to the original parent, yet were eventually fixed without adverse effect. All three mutations decrease NP\u2019s thermal stability. This decreased stability reduces in vivo protein levels, in turn reducing total transcriptional activity and viral growth. On the other hand, stabilizing mutations have little effect on protein levels, activity, or growth in the background of the parent NP\u2014presumably because this parent is already sufficiently stable for its cellular environment. However, these stabilizing mutations play a crucial evolutionary role by counteracting the destabilizing mutations and enabling them to fix during evolution."

In principle, mutations can affect a multitude of properties of NP, including its homo-oligomerization, association with RNA and other proteins, and cellular transport. We do not suggest that these properties are unimportant. In fact, we observe an epistatic interaction between R384G and E375G that likely relates to the electrostatic charge on one of NP\u2019s surfaces. Our assays are also of finite sensitivity, and so may miss small effects that are still significant to natural selection. There is also the potential for epistasis between NP and other viral proteins, although we see no evidence for such epistasis here, since all NP evolutionary intermediates that we tested are functional in a fixed background of other proteins. But doubtless some of these other mechanisms of epistasis would become apparent if we examined even longer evolutionary trajectories. However, the overriding message from our experiments is that stability-mediated epistasis is the dominant constraint on NP evolution."

At a broader level, analyses of large datasets have shown that it is common for mutations to be deleterious to one protein homolog but benign to another (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kondrashov et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Baresic et al., 2010</a>). Our work illustrates how the dynamics of stability during evolution might explain these findings. As shown in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>, most of the intermediates during NP\u2019s evolution are only marginally more stable than the minimal threshold where function begins to suffer. This marginal stability of natural proteins has been noted previously, and been given two distinct explanations. The first explanation holds that evolution actively selects for marginal stability because both insufficient and excess stability are deleterious (<a href=\"#bib18\">DePristo et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Tokuriki and Tawfik, 2009</a>). The second explanation holds that evolution only selects against insufficient stability, but that proteins typically are marginally stable because most mutations are destabilizing and so extra stability is rapidly eroded by functionally neutral but destabilizing mutations (<a href=\"#bib44\">Taverna and Goldstein, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Bloom et al., 2007</a>). Our results decisively favor the second explanation for NP, since the evolving protein is usually marginally stable despite the fact that higher stability has no deleterious effect (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,B</a>). We therefore suggest the following: functionally neutral but stabilizing mutations occasionally fix by stochastic forces such as genetic drift, population bottlenecks, or hitchhiking. These stabilizing mutations enable NP to tolerate otherwise deleterious destabilizing mutations. Although these destabilizing mutations could in principle also fix by stochastic forces, the three that we have identified are actually adaptive since they contribute to viral immune escape. Stability-mediated epistasis therefore constrains NP\u2019s adaptation as well as its sequence evolution, since the accessibility of immune-escape mutations is dependent on the acquisition of enabling mutations."

One explanation that has been posited for this punctuated pattern is that adaptive antigenic change is limited not by the overall rate of substitution, but rather by the waiting time for the protein to accumulate antigenically neutral mutations that can be productively combined with mutations causing large antigenic changes (<a href=\"#bib26\">Koelle et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">van Nimwegen, 2006</a>).

We used lentiviral transduction to create the cell lines 293T-CMV-Nan95-PB1 and MDCK-SIAT1-CMV-Nan95-PB1, which express the coding sequence of the Nanchang/1995 PB1 with the F2 peptide disrupted after its eighth codon (<a href=\"#bib16\">Chen et al., 2001</a>) under control of a CMV promoter. We seeded co-cultures of 2 \u00d7 10<sup>5</sup> 293T-CMV-Nan95-PB1 and 2 \u00d7 10<sup>4</sup> MDCK-SIAT1-CMV-Nan95-PB1 cells in D10 media in six-well dishes, and 20\u201324 hr later transfected with 250 ng each of pHWNan95-PB2, pHH-PB1flank-eGFP (<a href=\"#bib10\">Bloom et al., 2010</a>), pHWNan95-PA, a pHWAichi68-NP variant, pHW184-HA, pHW186-NA, pHW187-M, and pHW188-NS. These last four plasmids (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hoffmann et al., 2000</a>) encode genes from A/WSN/1933 (gifts from Y Kawaoka). After 20\u201324 hr, we replaced the D10 with influenza growth media (Opti-MEM I with 0.3% BSA, 0.01% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin, and 100 \u03bcg/ml calcium chloride). After 66 hr (shortly before peak titers, <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), we collected the supernatant and clarified it for 5 min at 2000\u00d7<i>g</i>. We infected dilutions of supernatant into 12-well dishes seeded 8 hr earlier at 10<sup>5</sup> MDCK-SIAT1-CMV-Nan95-PB1/well in influenza growth media, and 16 hr later determined the titer by flow cytometry by using the Poisson equation to estimate the viral titer based on the fraction of GFP positive cells. We performed these titering infections with various volumes of viral supernatant such that the titer could be computed from an infection with between 0.5% and 10% of cells green. Note that these titers reflect the number of particles that are able to productively infect cells and transcribe high levels of GFP from viral RNA\u2014they may not reflect the same titers as would be determined using other approaches such as plaque assays or tissue-culture infectious dose 50% assays. We quantified the titer relative to the average of three replicates of the wild-type pHWAichi68-NP (typically around 10<sup>3</sup> infectious particles per microliter). We performed at least three biological replicates for each variant, with each replicate performed on a different day using an independent plasmid mini-prep. <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 2</a> gives the means and standard errors."

Thus, there may be much more epistasis that has been important to the specific evolutionary trajectory that NP has taken than the authors have been able to assay, because the authors reconstruct mutations in the ancestral strain alone. Although we recognize the extent of the experimental work, there seems to be no good reason to distinguish the ancestral strain and look only for epistasis relative to mutational effects on that background.

First, introducing each mutation in every genetic background would require a massive number of additional experiments. Second, as we proceed along the evolutionary trajectory, the mutations already start to exist in the evolutionary intermediates, so it is not even possible to introduce them. For example, one might ask \u2013 do the mutations have the same effect in the final Brisbane/2007 NP as they do in the initial Aichi/1968 NP? However, the mutations are already present in the Brisbane/2007 NP, so it is not possible to introduce them into this background. One could imagine reverting mutations out of the Brisbane/2007 NP, but this is a conceptually different experiment, as it no longer involves introducing mutations in a forward evolutionary direction. However, if any other un-identified epistasis is mediated by stability, then <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a> with the new data we have added (described below in response to comment 4) suggests that we found the most individually destabilizing mutations along the trajectory."

Typically papers that report methods for detecting positive selection (such as dN/dS) develop a statistical method and then validate it by testing whether it can identify sites with independent evidence for positive selection. We describe extensive experimental evidence culled from many independent citations that the sites in question are located in human CTL epitopes."

But as we have shown, sites that contribute to CTL escape may be under strong constraint, and so may only be able to change under certain circumstance (in this case when they co-occur with stabilizing mutations), even if a change might be beneficial. This sort of epistasis would depress the rate of substitution at a site, reducing the signal in a dN/dS test even if a site is strongly targeted by CTLs. Nonetheless, we have performed dN/dS tests and added the results in <a href=\"#fig8s3\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 3</a> and <a href=\"#SD9-data\">Figure 8\u2014source code 2</a>. The signal is weak, probably because of a lack of data. Although we have many hundreds of NP sequences, they are closely related and are derived from a phylogenetic tree with a trunk-like structure (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), which reduces the power of the analysis since the sequences all closely track a single line of descent. The three destabilizing mutations occur at sites for which the posterior probability of positive selection is higher than for the typical site in NP, but for none do the posterior probabilities of positive selection rise to &gt;95%. But conversely, none of the destabilizing mutations occur at sites for which the posterior probability of negative selection is &gt;80%, indicating that these sites are also unlikely to be under strong negative selection. The dN/dS test therefore is inconclusive about whether the sites are under positive or negative selection."

We subscribe to the following interpretation: during its evolution, NP occasionally acquires stabilizing mutations that are neutral with respect to function (at least within the sensitivity of our experiments). Once these stabilizing mutations have occurred, the protein is tolerant to destabilizing mutations. It also remains tolerant to additional stabilizing mutations, but most frequently the next mutation will be destabilizing (it is well known that most random mutations are destabilizing)."

However, a mutation favored by selective forces will fix more frequently than one just driven just by stochastic forces, so the virus often fixes immune-escape mutations once they are accessible, explaining why the destabilizing mutations are enriched in CTL epitopes. After the protein has exhausted the extra stability provided by the original stabilizing mutation, selection disfavors further destabilizing mutations until the protein has again acquired a stabilizing mutation."
