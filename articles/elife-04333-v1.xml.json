Further, a lack of information about research resources makes it difficult or impossible to determine what was used in a published study (<a href=\"#bib46\">Vasilevsky et al., 2013</a>). These challenges are compounded by the lack of funding support available from agencies and foundations to support replication research. When replications are performed, they are rarely published (<a href=\"#bib10\">Collins, 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Schmidt, 2009</a>). A literature review in psychological science, for example, estimated that 0.15% of the published results were direct replications of prior published results (<a href=\"#bib27\">Makel et al., 2012</a>). Finally, reproducing analyses with prior data is difficult because researchers are often reluctant to share data, even when required by funding bodies or scientific societies (<a href=\"#bib50\">Wicherts et al., 2006</a>), and because data loss increases rapidly with time after publication (<a href=\"#bib47\">Vines et al., 2014</a>)."

In such a context, the most efficient means of knowledge accumulation would be to spend all resources on discovery and trust that each published result provided an accurate estimate of effects on which to build or extend. However, if not all published results are true and if effect sizes are misestimated, then an absence of replication and verification will lead to a published literature that misrepresents reality. The consequences of that scenario would depend on the magnitude of the misestimation."

The samples in these two studies were not the same, but both were large and there is little reason to expect lack of comparability. This discrepancy between observed power and observed positive results is not statistically possible. Instead, it suggests systematic exclusion of negative results (<a href=\"#bib15\">Greenwald, 1975</a>) and possibly the exaggeration of positive results by employing flexibility in analytic and reporting practices that inflate the likelihood of false positives (<a href=\"#bib42\">Simmons et al., 2011</a>)."

Altmetrics scores from Mendeley and <a href=\"http://Altmetric.com\">Altmetric.com</a> were collected for the entire dataset and used to create a final impact score for each paper. Citation rates and altmetric scores were each standardized by dividing each metric by the highest in the dataset to give each paper a normalized metric score between 0 and 1, which was summed to create an aggregate impact score. Within each year, articles were reviewed for inclusion eligibility starting with the highest aggregate impact article. Articles were removed if they were clinical trials, case studies, reviews, or if they required specialized samples, techniques, or equipment that would be difficult or impossible to obtain. Also, articles reporting sequencing results, such as publications from <a href=\"http://cancergenome.nih.gov\">The Cancer Genome Atlas</a> project, were excluded. However, if sequencing or proteomic experiments were only part of an article, the other experiments in those papers could still be eligible. Review of articles continued until a total of 50 articles, about one-third from each year, were identified as eligible. The final set included 17 papers from 2010, 17 from 2011, and 16 from 2012. From each paper, a subset of experiments were identified for replication, prioritizing those that support the main conclusions of the paper while also attending to feasibility and resource constraints.

Because the network consists of over 900 labs skilled in the techniques necessary for replicating the experiments within the chosen studies, the likelihood of a failed replication due to lack of relevant expertise is minimized. The providers are matched to an experiment on the basis of their skills and available instrumentation, often with multiple providers contributing to each replication. An advantage of these labs - commercial contract research organizations (CROs) and core facilities\u2014is that they are less likely to be biased for or against replicating the effect. This may reduce the effect of experimenter expectations on observed results (<a href=\"#bib40\">Rosenthal and Fode, 1963</a>). However, it does not necessarily eliminate expectancy effects as the replicating researchers are aware of the original findings, and they may have expectations about whether the same result is likely to be obtained or not. Another advantage of this approach is that the time and cost of replicating an experiment via Science Exchange is less than that required to establish a collaboration with another academic lab, allowing the project to scale up efficiently."

However, it is common in biomedical research for some experiments to be presented with representative images or graphs without any inferential testing. In these cases, we will inquire with the original authors if there are additional unpublished replications, if it is not already stated in the article, and if any details are available about the results. Further, these qualitative experiments will be replicated three times and all results will be presented. Because the original representative image presents a mean, but no variability information from sampling, it is not possible to compute a standardized effect size. Using the mean of the replication to calculate post-hoc power would be invalid for computing the needed effect size, but the variability of the three replications may be a less biased estimator. So, to determine if more than three replications are needed, we will use the original experiment for estimating the mean and the replications for estimating the variability needed to compute power. This strategy will provide an opportunity to identify the need for more sampling than the default of three. As such, it can only result in increasing the overall power of the investigation."

Moreover, replications describe in detail the entire experimental design, including controls, conditions, assay optimizations, materials, protocols, and analysis plans prior to initiating data collection. Next, a key part of matching experiments with laboratories is to identify labs with the appropriate expertise to maximize research quality. This is particularly important with new and innovative techniques, though most techniques called for in the selected experiments are standard techniques for which expertise is widely available. As experiments are matched to labs, it is possible that no appropriate service provider can be identified. If appropriate expertise is not available, then the finding or paper will be excluded from the project."

One approach is to consider whether the replication achieves a p-value of less than 0.05 with the same direction of association or ordinal ranking between conditions as the original. This provides some information but still treats experimental outputs dichotomously, with an arbitrary significance threshold. For example, the above approach would classify a replication with p = 0.06 as a failure. An alternative approach in the null hypothesis significance testing framework is to treat the original effect size as the null and test whether the replication is significantly different from that value. This provides complementary information to the first approach because effects can succeed or fail on one or both tests. For example, a replication with p = 0.06 fails the first test but may not be distinguishable from the original on the second test."

Another reason for different outcomes is that the conditions necessary to obtain the result are not yet understood. Together the replication protocol and peer review of the Registered Report are intended to produce an experimental design for which there is no reason to expect a priori a different result than the original. Those expectations are based on the present theoretical understanding of how and why the effect occurs. However, that understanding may be incorrect or incomplete. Particular features of the original experimental protocol might be critical but unidentified. Therefore, if there is no reason to expect a different result, and a different result is obtained, then differences between the original and replication deemed previously to be non-consequential are now targets for hypothesizing and investigation.

Perhaps these papers will be chosen by the current method but it may be useful to survey a field for papers that investigators would like to see replicated. I suspect there would be a few that rise up to the top and have great impact on the field if not reproduced. That does not need to be done in the context of the current article, but perhaps worth noting that different approaches could be used in future to identify the controversial articles containing ideas that could be blocking the development of fields</i>."
