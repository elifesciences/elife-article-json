Deletion of PTEN, the negative regulator of PI3K, induces CNS axon regeneration through the activation of PI3K-mTOR signaling. We have conducted an extensive molecular dissection of the cross-regulating mechanisms in axon regeneration that involve the downstream effectors of PI3K, AKT and the two mTOR complexes (mTORC1 and mTORC2). We found that the predominant AKT isoform in CNS, AKT3, induces much more robust axon regeneration than AKT1 and that activation of mTORC1 and inhibition of GSK3\u03b2 are two critical parallel pathways for AKT-induced axon regeneration. Surprisingly, phosphorylation of T308 and S473 of AKT play opposite roles in GSK3\u03b2 phosphorylation and inhibition, by which mTORC2 and pAKT-S473 negatively regulate axon regeneration. Thus, our study revealed a complex neuron-intrinsic balancing mechanism involving AKT as the nodal point of PI3K, mTORC1/2 and GSK3\u03b2 that coordinates both positive and negative cues to regulate adult CNS axon regeneration."

Deletion of PTEN, the negative regulator of PI3K, induces CNS axon regeneration through the activation of PI3K-mTOR signaling. We have conducted an extensive molecular dissection of the cross-regulating mechanisms in axon regeneration that involve the downstream effectors of PI3K, AKT and the two mTOR complexes (mTORC1 and mTORC2). We found that the predominant AKT isoform in CNS, AKT3, induces much more robust axon regeneration than AKT1 and that activation of mTORC1 and inhibition of GSK3\u03b2 are two critical parallel pathways for AKT-induced axon regeneration. Surprisingly, phosphorylation of T308 and S473 of AKT play opposite roles in GSK3\u03b2 phosphorylation and inhibition, by which mTORC2 and pAKT-S473 negatively regulate axon regeneration. Thus, our study revealed a complex neuron-intrinsic balancing mechanism involving AKT as the nodal point of PI3K, mTORC1/2 and GSK3\u03b2 that coordinates both positive and negative cues to regulate adult CNS axon regeneration."

This response depends on two parallel pathways: one in which AKT3 activates a protein complex called mTORC1, and one where AKT3 inhibits a protein called GSK3\u03b2. In addition, another protein complex called mTORC2, which is closely related to mTORC1, helps to inhibit the activity of AKT3 on GSK3\u03b2 and hence inhibits axon regeneration."

We and other investigators have found that the\u00a0activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) by the\u00a0deletion of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) induces CNS axon regeneration through the\u00a0activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib55\">Park et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Liu et al., 2010</a>). PI3K is a lipid kinase, which can be activated by receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) and subsequently phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>) in the lipid membrane to produce phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-triphosphate (PIP<sub>3</sub>). PIP<sub>3</sub> in turn recruits AKT, a member of the AGC family of serine/threonine kinases, to the membrane to be activated by phosphorylation at T308 via phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1)\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib47\">Manning and Cantley, 2007</a>). PTEN is a lipid phosphatase that converts PIP<sub>3</sub> to PIP<sub>2</sub>,\u00a0and thus inhibits the activation of downstream effectors of PI3K. The PI3K-AKT pathway is the main effector by which RTKs promote cell survival and growth in response to growth factor signaling\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib66\">Song et al., 2012a</a>). One of the multiple AKT downstream effectors is the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC1/TSC2), the negative regulator of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1). Thus AKT activation removes the inhibition of TSC and activates mTORC1. The PI3K-AKT-mTORC1 pathway is a master regulator of protein synthesis and cellular growth\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib47\">Manning and Cantley, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Laplante and Sabatini, 2012</a>)."

One of these is the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding proteins (4E-BPs); their phosphorylation releases inhibition of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E and initiates cap-dependent translation. The other is the ribosomal protein S6 kinases (S6Ks); their phosphorylation is critical for mRNA biogenesis, translation initiation and elongation\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib29\">Hay and Sonenberg, 2004</a>). Phosphorylation of ribosome protein S6 (pS6) by S6K has often served as a marker for mTORC1 activation. Interestingly, S6K also functions as feedback inhibition of RTK/PI3K signaling, which balances mTORC1 activation\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib59\">Radimerski et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Um et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Yang et al., 2014</a>). Both 4E-BP inhibition and S6K activation promote protein synthesis, but 4E-BPs act specifically to control cell proliferation (cell number) and S6Ks preferentially regulate cell growth (cell size)\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib14\">Dowling et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Ohanna et al., 2005</a>). We previously reported that, although S6K1 activation, but not 4E-BP inhibition, is sufficient for axon regeneration, 4E-BP inhibition is necessary for PTEN deletion-induced axon regeneration\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib74\">Yang et al., 2014</a>). Phosphorylation and inhibition of another AKT substrate, glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2 (GSK-3\u03b2), is critical for neuronal polarization, axon branching and axon growth\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib41\">Kim et al., 2011b</a>). However, how GSK-3\u03b2 regulates peripheral axon regeneration is controversial\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib60\">Saijilafu et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Zhang et al., 2014a</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Gobrecht et al., 2014</a>) and its function in CNS axon regeneration remains to be determined."

We made AAV2-AKT viruses containing triple mutant capsid (Y444, 500, 730F) to take the\u00a0advantage of the high RGC transduction efficiency of capsid-mutated AAV2 (<a href=\"#bib58\">Petrs-Silva et al., 2011</a>): transduction exceeded 80% of RGC, based on the ratio of HA (transgene tag) to Tuj1 (antibody for RGC marker, \u03b2-III tubulin) positive cells in flat-mount retinas (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>). We also confirmed that all three isoforms of AKT produced the expected changes in RGCs: significantly increased levels of pAKT-S473 and pS6 (mTORC1 activation marker), indicating activation of AKT and mTORC1 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>, note that pAKT-T308 antibody did not effectively immunostain retina). Western blot analysis of retina lysates showed comparable expression of AKT isoforms (HA levels), but levels of pT308 and pS6 were significantly higher in retinas transfected by AKT3 than by AKT1 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a>). This difference indicates the greater activity of AKT3 in retina. We noticed that both pAKT-T308 and pAKT-S473 antibodies can only be used to detect AKT1 and AKT3 reliably in Western blot, whereas the pAKT2-S474 specific antibody readily detected p-AKT2 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>)."

RGC axons that regenerated through the lesion site were labeled anterogradely by intravitreal injection of the tracer Alexa 488-conjugated cholera toxin \u03b2 (CTB), and imaged and quantified in ON longitudinal sections at 2 weeks post-crush (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Interestingly, the three isoforms of AKT elicited different patterns of axon regeneration: AKT2 and AKT3 caused significantly more axon regeneration than AKT1; AKT2 induced the longest axon growth (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>). The differing capabilities of the three isoforms of AKT in axon regeneration could not be explained simply by their expression levels, which HA staining showed to be comparable (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a>). The higher pT308 and pS6 levels and more potent axon regeneration induced by AKT3 suggest that its function in retina differs from those of AKT1 and AKT2. Similar to their effects on axon regeneration, all three isoforms increased RGC survival to more than 40% based on Tuj1 staining in retinal flat-mounts, at least a 1-fold increase over WT mice; and significantly more RGCs survived in mice injected with AAV-AKT3 than with AKT1 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,D</a>). This series of experiments demonstrated that the downstream effector of PI3K, AKT, promotes both RGC survival and ON regeneration, and that there are significant differences among the three AKT isoforms."

Since AKT3 is the predominant isoform in adult mouse brain (50% AKT3, 30% AKT1 and 20% AKT2) (<a href=\"#bib18\">Easton et al., 2005</a>), we determined whether this is also the case in RGCs. We employed the RiboTag mice, which are generated by knocking in the HA-tagged ribosome protein Rpl22 (Rpl22<sup>HA</sup>) to the endogenous Rpl22 allele, immediately after the floxed endogenous Rpl22 gene\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib61\">Sanz et al., 2009</a>). After intravitreal injection of AAV2-Cre, Rpl22<sup>HA</sup> was expressed specifically in RGCs after Cre-mediated deletion of endogenous Rpl22 (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>). This allowed us to selectively immunoprecipitate (IP) RGC-specific ribosomes (Ribo-IP) in situ\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib15\">Doyle et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Heiman et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Sanz et al., 2009</a>) and acquire high quality RGC-specific ribosome-associated translating mRNA from mouse retinas (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2D</a>). We then used three biological replicates of RGC-translating mRNAs from WT mice (8\u201310 mice/replicate) to perform RNA deep sequencing; each library acquired about 25 million reads and 93% of total reads aligned to unique genes in the mouse genome (mm9) by RUM\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib24\">Grant et al., 2011</a>). Measurement of transcript abundance in fragments per Kb of exon per million fragments mapped (FPKM) (<a href=\"#bib49\">Mortazavi et al., 2008</a>) indicated that AKT1 and AKT3 were the two major isoforms of AKT in RGCs; each represented 45% of total AKT, a vivid contrast to AKT2 (10%) (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2E</a>)."

                                "text": "We were surprised to find, however, that the AKT3-S472A mutant produced a small but statistically significant increase in axon regeneration at 500 \u00b5m distal to the crush site and a trend toward increase at other distances, compared to WT AKT3 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,D</a>), suggesting that pS473 inhibits the effect of AKT on axon regeneration. This contradicts the common theme that phosphorylation of both T308 and S473 is additive to AKT activity\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib5\">Bhaskar and Hay, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Yang et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Scheid et al., 2002</a>). To confirm this unanticipated finding, we tested whether mTORC2 also is inhibitory for AKT-induced axon regeneration, since S473 of AKT is phosphorylated by mTORC2\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib62\">Sarbassov et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Guertin et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Hresko and Mueckler, 2005</a>). We blocked mTORC2 genetically by deleting its essential component, <i>Rictor</i> (rapamycin-insensitive companion of mTOR)\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib26\">Guertin et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Laplante and Sabatini, 2012</a>). We injected AAV-AKT3 and AAV-Cre together into one eye of <i>Rictor</i> floxed mice and compared ON regeneration to that elicited by the\u00a0injection of AAV-AKT3 alone into the contralateral eye. Consistent with our AKT3-S472A result, AKT3 and <i>Rictor</i> KO produced even more extensive and lengthier axon regeneration than AKT3 alone (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,D</a>). This was not due to an additive effect because <i>Rictor</i> KO alone did not cause any axon regeneration (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), but presumably through inhibition of S473 phosphorylation. Indeed, both immunostaining and Western blot analysis confirmed that AKT3-S472A mutant and <i>Rictor</i> deletion significantly decreased pS473 levels (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B,F</a>). The enhanced axon regeneration was not due to increased expression of AKT3, which was slightly decreased in <i>Rictor</i> KO mice (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,D</a>). It was also not due to enhanced activation of AKT or mTORC1, because levels of pT308 and pS6 were also decreased (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,E,G</a>). This is consistent with the positive effect of pS473 on T308 phosphorylation (<a href=\"#bib62\">Sarbassov et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Carson et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Yuan et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Hresko and Mueckler, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Guertin et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Yang et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Scheid et al., 2002</a>). Surprisingly, mTORC2 and pS473 had a negative effect on GSK3\u03b2-S9 phosphorylation; deletion of <i>Rictor</i> significantly increased pGSK3\u03b2-S9 level (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,H</a>). AKT3-S472A mutant also increased GSK3\u03b2-S9 phosphorylation although with large variation. <i>Rictor</i> KO alone did not increase pGSK3\u03b2-S9 compared to WT mice (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>), suggesting that AKT kinase activity is required for GSK3\u03b2 phosphorylation. Since GSK3\u03b2-S9 phosphorylation has been suggested to promote peripheral axon regeneration\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib60\">Saijilafu et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Zhang et al., 2014a</a>), inhibition of AKT-S473 phosphorylation may increase CNS axon regeneration through enhanced inactivation of GSK3\u03b2. Taken together, our results demonstrate that, in contrast to pAKT-T308, mTORC2 and pAKT-S473 inhibit GSK3\u03b2 phosphorylation, which may contribute to their negative effect on axon regeneration."

Previous studies of mTORC1 function in axon regeneration relied on pharmacological inhibition of mTORC1 by rapamycin, which generated inconsistent or contradictory results\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib10\">Christie et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Abe et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Park et al., 2008</a>). To definitively determine the role of mTORC1, we disrupted mTORC1 by deleting <i>Rptor</i> (regulatory associated protein of mTOR) in RGCs specifically. <i>Rptor</i> is unique to mTORC1, and its deletion totally blocks mTORC1 activity\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib44\">Laplante and Sabatini, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Guertin et al., 2006</a>). We injected AAV-AKT3 and AAV-Cre together into one eye of <i>Rptor</i> floxed mice and compared the ON regeneration to that obtained with injection of AAV-AKT3 alone into the contralateral eye. <i>Rptor</i> deletion alone did not result in axon regeneration (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>); it significantly decreased AKT3-induced axon regeneration (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>). The two best-characterized substrates of mTORC1, S6K1 and 4E-BP, are necessary for axon regeneration\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib74\">Yang et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Hu, 2015</a>), we tested whether the dominant negative mutant of S6K1 (S6K1-DN) and constitutively active mutant of 4E-BP1 (4E-BP1-4A) also inhibit AKT3-induced axon regeneration. Similar to <i>Rptor</i> deletion, S6K1-DN and 4E-BP1-4A also significantly decreased AKT3-induced axon regeneration (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>), which further confirms the essential role of mTORC1 in AKT-induced axon regeneration. Since we found that mTORC1 is necessary but that mTORC2 is inhibitory for AKT-induced axon regeneration, we asked what the combined effect would be of blocking both mTORC1 and mTORC2 by deleting <i>Mtor</i> itself. We again injected AAV-AKT3 and AAV-Cre together into one eye of <i>Mtor</i> floxed mice and compared the ON regeneration to that obtained by injecting AAV-AKT3 alone into the contralateral eye. Deletion of <i>Mtor</i> itself did not result in axon regeneration (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) but significantly inhibited AKT3-induced axon regeneration (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>).

In contrast to AKT1 and AKT2, which are widely expressed, AKT3 is the predominant isoform in brain\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib18\">Easton et al., 2005</a>). Deletion of AKT1 reduces whole body size and deletion of AKT2 results in diabetes-like syndrome\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib8\">Cho et al., 2001a</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Cho et al., 2001b</a>). Deletion only of AKT3 specifically reduces brain size (<a href=\"#bib18\">Easton et al., 2005</a>), indicating a specific role of AKT3 in regulation of CNS growth. Interestingly, AKT2 and AKT3, but not AKT1, regulate survival and growth of cultured hippocampal neurons\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib11\">Diez et al., 2012</a>). Our analysis of the expression levels of the three AKT isoforms in RGCs and their distinct roles in axon regeneration provides additional in vivo evidence of the unique properties of AKT3 in CNS: AKT3 activation promotes significantly greater RGC survival and ON regeneration than AKT1, presumably through its unique ability to activate mTORC1 (higher pS6) in retina. This is also true in brain as AKT3 KO, but not AKT1 deletion, decreases pS6 significantly\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib18\">Easton et al., 2005</a>). AKT3 may also selectively activate unknown, neuronal-specific signaling molecules. The partial functional redundancy of AKT isoforms, however, makes identification of these molecules difficult\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib17\">Dummler and Hemmings, 2007</a>)."

Decreased AKT3 by itself may not account for reduced axon regeneration, however, because the remaining amounts enabled RGCs to survive (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E,F</a>). Although we cannot exclude the possibility that the decrease in AKT3 contributed to the reduced axon regeneration, we consider the significant decreases in mTORC1 signaling and protein synthesis to be the main reason for the inhibition of axon regeneration. This notion receives additional support from our observation of other conditions in which axon regeneration was enhanced despite downregulation of AKT3 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,D</a> and <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E,F</a>), which suggests that high levels are not required for axon regeneration. Based on our previous demonstration of the necessary role of 4E-BP and S6K1\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib74\">Yang et al., 2014</a>),we therefore conclude that mTORC1 is critically important for axon regeneration and that the effects on axon regeneration are due to the signaling alterations, rather than to the changed levels of AKT expression per se."

Our finding that pS473 enhances, rather than inhibits, phosphorylation of T308, implies that different substrates or differentially regulated substrates by pT308 and pS473, must contribute to the difference in axon regeneration. The inhibitory effect of mTORC2 and pAKT-S473 on GSK3\u03b2 phosphorylation is striking and very interesting. The significantly increased pGSK3\u03b2-S9 after blocking mTORC2 and S473 phosphorylation suggests that GSK3\u03b2 is one of the AKT effectors that are differentially regulated by pAKT-T308 and pAKT-S473. Although previous in vitro study showed unchanged GSK3\u03b2 phosphorylation after <i>Rictor</i> KO and reduced S473 phosphorylation\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib26\">Guertin et al., 2006</a>), the\u00a0liver or muscle-specific <i>Rictor</i> deletion increases GSK3\u03b2 phosphorylation\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib42\">Kumar et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Yuan et al., 2012</a>). The results of our studies using GSK3\u03b2-S9A mutant and <i>Gsk3b</i> KO mice provide additional evidence of the inhibitory role of GSK3\u03b2 in axon regeneration and definitively resolve the contradictory information in the literature\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib10\">Christie et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Abe et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Saijilafu et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Dill et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Gobrecht et al., 2014</a>).

It is also worth noting that, because <i>Rictor</i> deletion did not totally block AKT-S473 phosphorylation, other kinases in addition to mTORC2 may contribute in retina. Moreover, because other kinases have been suggested to phosphorylate GSK3\u03b2-S9 in addition to AKT\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib68\">Tsujio et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Fang et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Armstrong et al., 2001</a>), it will be important to investigate whether these kinases are also regulated by mTORC2 in a similar way as AKT.

But we and others did not find that increased neuron survival was invariably linked to proportionately greater axon regeneration\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib4\">Benowitz et al., 2015</a>). This is consistent with findings in other systems. For example, most corticospinal neurons exhibit long term survival after transection in the spinal cord\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib51\">Nielson et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">2011</a>), but they fail to regenerate axons (<a href=\"#bib64\">Schwab and Bartholdi, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Goldberg et al., 2002b</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Fitch and Silver, 2008</a>). The 20% of RGCs that normally survive ON crush in mice can be increased significantly by inhibition of apoptosis, deleting tumor suppressor genes or by manipulating ER stress pathways, but these manipulations do not necessarily induce ON regeneration\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib55\">Park et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Hu et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Goldberg et al., 2002a</a>). This observation indicates that axon regeneration requires neuronal intrinsic growth stimulators that are distinct from neuronal surviving factors. Thus we consistently found that, although manipulation of mTOR complexes and GSK3\u03b2 significantly changed axon regeneration, RGC survival induced by AKT remained the same. We could not exclude the possibility that changing RGC survival contributed to a change in axon regeneration, but no convincing evidence proves a direct causative relationship between these two events. The available evidence, therefore, supports the idea that the intrinsic signaling events after AKT activation and the involvement of its upstream or downstream signaling effectors are directly related to intrinsic growth control of neurons, and that these signaling pathways are distinct from or overlap only partially, signaling necessary for survival. There are far fewer regenerating axons than surviving RGCs, however, suggesting that only a small percentage of RGCs are regenerating and different subtypes of RGCs have different regeneration abilities\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib16\">Duan et al., 2015</a>). In-depth understanding of the mechanisms of this difference will be required to maximize RGC axon regeneration."

Since we also observed that regeneration-promoting WT AKTs and AKT-S473A mutant were localized in ON whereas non-regeneration AKT mutants were excluded from ON, it will be very intriguing to investigate the significance of axonal AKT activation in CNS axon regeneration, especially its effect on axonal protein synthesis."

The opposite effects of mTORC1 and mTORC2 on axon regeneration suggest that a balancing mechanism exists downstream of the critical growth-promoting signal PI3K and that AKT integrates both positive and negative signals through phosphorylation of T308 and S473 and their specific roles in downstream effectors mTORC1 and GSK3\u03b2 to control CNS axon regeneration (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). Interestingly, mTORC1/S6K also functions as feedback inhibition of PI3K signaling\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib44\">Laplante and Sabatini, 2012</a>), which also balances AKT activation and axon regeneration\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib74\">Yang et al., 2014</a>).

Dynabeads were washed three times for 10 min with high salt buffer (50\u00a0mM Tris pH7.4, 300\u00a0mM KCl, 12\u00a0mM MgCl, 1% NP-40, 1\u00a0mM DTT and 100\u2009\u03bcg/ml Cyclohexamide in RNase-free H2O) before RNA extraction with RNeasy Micro Kit (QIAGEN,\u00a0Hilden,\u00a0Germany). About 200ng total RNA generated from each group was used for RNA-seq, which was done at the\u00a0University of Pennsylvania Next-Generation Sequencing Core. Briefly, Ribo-IP RNA samples from three biological replicates went through polyA selection before the\u00a0generation of strand-specific RNA-seq libraries with Illumina TruSeq Stranded Total Kit and quality assessment with Agilent BioAnalyser and Kapa BioSystems Library Quant Kit. Pooled libraries that have been individually labeled were sequenced to 100\u00a0bp reads from one end of the insert using a HiSeq2000 sequencer. Each library acquired about 25 million reads and 93% of total reads aligned to unique genes in the mouse genome (UCSC mm9) by RUM\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib24\">Grant et al., 2011</a>). The 'raw' data (reads per transcript) were quantile normalized within groups with quantile normalization (GCRMA) to remove non-biological variability."

I appreciate the authors including the RGC survival data throughout the work \u2013 I think that strengthens the manuscript quite a bit and supports the authors' conclusions for role of AKT3\u2192Torc1 in regeneration. While there certainly are many instances where injured neurons survive but do not regenerate, I do not know of anywhere they regenerate in the absence of survival, Despite the improvement, I think there are a remaining few points of confusion and ambiguity in the data that the authors overlook in interpreting the work.

One has to wonder if this is just different affinity between pS474 and pS473 antibodies? However, more concerning is that the authors indicate that transduced myr-AKT3 affords greater regeneration and the endogenous AKT3 is predominant over AKT2. <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> shows that transduced myr-AKT2 provides as good or better regeneration activity than AKT3 and <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a> shows quite prominent ISH signals and immunoblotting signals for all three isoforms. Granted the RNA-seq data from RGCs shows different loading of AKT1-3 on ribosomes, but I do not think the authors can dismiss the data on regeneration with transduced myr-AKT2 and expression of endogenous AKT2 as they have. This does not detract from the manuscript's findings, but I think the authors should not be misrepresenting their data to the reader (e.g., sentence \u201cThe higher pT308 and pS6 levels and more potent axon regeneration induced by AKT3 suggest that its function in retina differs from those of AKT1 and AKT2\u201d is not valid)."

Decrease in AKT3 is also seen for RICTOR KO in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a> but not described. For both of these situations, I think the authors need to be clear that they are referring to levels of the transduced AKT3 not endogenous. Also the authors should indicate that this could reflect a direct effect on protein synthesis as they imply in the aforementioned paragraph, but could also be secondary to altered levels of viral transduction. Both here and in the subsection \u201cGSK3\u03b2 deletion alone is sufficient for axon regeneration and also acts synergistically with mTORC1 and AKT\u201d, the authors should clarify that they are referring to AKT3 executing a survival function in the cell body rather than distinguishing between soma and axon intrinsic actions of AKT3.

The authors sporadically mention survival differences in the text, but show no other data beyond <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>. Looking over the post-crush retina images, there is quite variable Tuj1 staining in the supplemental figures. For example, Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2 shows markedly different numbers of Tuj1+ cells comparing AKT3 only vs. additional AKT3 + raptor KO, S6K-DN, 4EBP1S4A(?) &amp; mTOR KO; <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a> similarly shows differences in RGC numbers with Tuj1 staining comparing the varying combinations. Considering that the authors only show na\u00efve retina images for the AKT3 mutants and Rictor-KO, I have a very difficult time dissociating regeneration and survival based on the data presented. Obviously, the RGCs need to survive after axotomy to regenerate, but I have concern that some of the decreased regeneration here may relate to differences in survival with the AKT, mTOR, and GSK3\u03b2 manipulations. The authors need to provide quantitative data for survival across these manipulations and offer clear evidence that effects are regeneration rather than RGC survival to support their conclusions.

We thank Reviewer 1 for bring up this insightful request, quantification of expression levels of HA-tagged AKT isoforms/mutants and quantification of cell signaling alterations. We now provide this information, which we believe has substantially improved the manuscript. We realized that immunostaining of flat-mount retina is not sufficient to evaluate subtle differences in expression and alterations in signaling and that this technique will only detect an effect that is very dramatic (all or none). Therefore, we performed Western blots of retina lysates for all the conditions that we studied and quantified the HA-tag levels of AKT isoforms/mutants and signaling (phosphorylation levels of AKT-T308, S473, S6 and GSK3\u03b2-S9). We will provide more detail in our responses to individual questions below, but our overall conclusion is that the effects on axon regeneration are indeed due to gene manipulations and corresponding signaling alterations, rather than to different levels of expression of exogenous constructs. Consistent with Reviewer 1\u2019s prediction, these additional Western blot studies significantly enhanced the reliability of our results and therefore the impact of our study. More importantly, the new experiments revealed several new findings. The most significant of these is that: pAKT-T308 and mTORC2-pAKT-S473 differentially regulate GSK3\u03b2-S9 phosphorylation, through which axon regeneration is oppositely controlled by pAKT-T308 and mTORC2-pAKT-S473."

Although we cannot totally exclude the possibility that the decreased AKT3 contributes to the decreased axon regeneration, we consider the significant decrease in mTORC1 signaling and protein synthesis to be the main reason for the inhibition of axon regeneration. Consistent with this notion, there are other circumstances in which even though the AKT3 level is downregulated (AKT3 in RICTOR KO or GSK3\u03b2 KO mice), axon regeneration is enhanced (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, <a href=\"#fig7\">7</a>).

Looking over the post-crush retina images, there is quite variable Tuj1 staining in the supplemental figures.
