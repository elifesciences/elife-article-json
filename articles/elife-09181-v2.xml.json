Previous studies have shown that nitrogen and amino acid signals activate TORC1 via the small GTPases, Gtr1/2. However, little is known about the way that other nutrient signals are transmitted to TORC1. Here we report that glucose starvation triggers disassembly of TORC1, and movement of the key TORC1 component Kog1/Raptor to a single body near the edge of the vacuole. These events are driven by Snf1/AMPK-dependent phosphorylation of Kog1 at Ser 491/494 and two nearby prion-like motifs. Kog1-bodies then serve to increase the threshold for TORC1 activation in cells that have been starved for a significant period of time. Together, our data show that Kog1-bodies create hysteresis (memory) in the TORC1 pathway and help ensure that cells remain committed to a quiescent state under suboptimal conditions. We suggest that other protein bodies formed in starvation conditions have a similar function."

This movement is driven by a \u201ckinase\u201d enzyme that adds chemical groups called phosphates to Kog1, and by regions within the Kog1 protein known as prion like domains. When sugar first becomes available again, Kog1 is still in the body so Tor1 cannot immediately trigger cell growth. However, once a steady supply of sugar resumes, Kog1 rejoins the rest of the complex and the cells start to grow."

Therefore a future challenge is to find out whether any of these proteins form similar bodies that enable our cells to remember past events."

Surprisingly, we find that glucose starvation leads to disassembly of the TOR complex and movement of Kog1 from the vacuolar membrane to a single body on the edge of the vacuole, while glucose repletion leads to a reversal of this process. Following up on these observations we show that the AMPK, Snf1, drives Kog1 into bodies by phosphorylating, or triggering the phosphorylation of, Kog1 at Ser 491 and 494. Furthermore, we find that these phosphorylation sites are located in one of two, glutamine-rich prion-like motifs in Kog1, and that these motifs are required for the formation of Kog1-bodies. Finally, by measuring phosphorylation of the key TORC1 substrate, Sch9, in a variety of mutants, we show that Kog1 agglomeration increases the threshold for TORC1 activation."

To determine if Kog1 associates with stress granules (or related structures known as P-bodies [<a href=\"#bib40\">Parker, 2012</a>]) in glucose starvation conditions, we transfected cells carrying Kog1-YFP with mCherry-tagged versions of the stress granule marker Pbp1 or the P-body marker Edc3, and followed YFP and RFP localization. We found that stress granules start to form after 60 min in glucose starvation conditions, and become pervasive in cells grown to saturation in SD medium, but only co-localize with Kog1-bodies in 2.6% of cells (0% co-localization after 60 min, n = 94; 2.6% co-localization after 24 hrs, n = 190; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Similarly, P-bodies form in &gt;80% cells after 60 min of glucose starvation, but only co-localize with Kog1-bodies in 3.4% of cells (n = 404; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>).

In a previous study we showed that the AMP activated protein kinase, Snf1, is required for TORC1 pathway inhibition during glucose starvation (<a href=\"#bib23\">Hughes Hallett et al., 2014</a>). We therefore wondered if Snf1 regulates TORC1, at least in part, by driving Kog1 agglomeration. To test this hypothesis we monitored Kog1-YFP localization in <i>snf1</i>\u0394\u00a0cells. These experiments revealed that deletion of Snf1 causes a dramatic, 20-fold, increase in the time-constant for Kog1-body formation ( \u03c4\u00a0= 219 \u00b1 21 min in <i>snf1</i>\u0394 cells; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>)."

The plasmids were then cut using PflF1, and transformed into a wild type train (ACY044). In all cases this led to insertion of the plasmid at the Kog1 locus, creating a wild-type copy of Kog1, followed by the URA3 gene, followed by a mutant copy of Kog1 (AA, DD, or EE; as confirmed by sequencing). We then isolated colonies that excised the plasmid by selection on 5FOA. In this final step, we expected to find colonies that retain the wild-type copy of Kog1 as well as colonies that retain the mutated copy of Kog1 (depending on the site of recombination during the loop out event). In line with our expectations, we found 7/10 of the colonies created by looping in, and looping out, Kog1<sup>S491A/S494A</sup> had the AA mutation (the other 3 were wild-type). In contrast, we found 0/20 colonies had the DD mutation and 0/12 strains had the EE mutation. Specifically, we can calculate the probability of finding 0/20 DD and 0/12 EE mutations by chance, given that we found 7/10 AA mutations, at p&lt;0.0001 and p&lt;0.001, respectively, using Fisher\u2019s exact test. The probability of finding 0/32 DD and EE mutants by chance, given that we found 7/10 AA mutants, is less than 1\u00a0x\u00a010-<sup>\u20135</sup>. This strongly suggests that strains carrying Kog1 with phosphomimetic substitutions at Ser 491 and 494 are inviable."

We then used mass spectrometry to identify the phosphorylation sites on Tor1 and Kog1 in each condition. These data showed that Kog1 is phosphorylated on Ser 491 and 494 in glucose starvation conditions, but not in osmotic stress or SD medium (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplements 1, 2</a>). A short time later, Young and coworkers showed that Ser 491 and 494 on Kog1 are Snf1-dependent phosphorylation sites (<a href=\"#bib7\">Braun et al., 2014</a>). Therefore, to test if Snf1 drives Kog1-body formation by promoting phosphorylation of Ser 491 and 494, we constructed a strain carrying Kog1<sup>S491A/S494A</sup>-YFP at the native locus and monitored Kog1 localization in glucose starvation conditions. We found that Kog1<sup>S491A/S494A</sup> forms bodies slowly ( \u03c4\u03c4\u00a0= 309 \u00b1 48 min; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>), and at a rate similar to that found in the <i>snf1</i>\u0394 strain (\u03c4 = 219 \u00b1 21 min; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>).

This key signaling event is readily measured using a band-shift assay developed by Loewith and coworkers (<a href=\"#bib50\">Urban et al., 2007</a>). Using this assay, we asked if and how Kog1-bodies influence TORC1 signaling by following Sch9 phosphorylation in five strains that have a defect in Kog1-body formation (Kog1<sup>S491A/S494A</sup>, <i>snf1</i>\u0394,\u00a0PrDm1, PrDm2, PrDm1 + 2)."

Thus, Kog1-body formation does not appear to play a significant role in TORC1-Sch9 signaling during acute glucose starvation since (1) Sch9 dephosphorylation occurs much faster than the accumulation of Kog1-bodies ( \u03c4\u03c4\u00a0= &lt;2.5 min versus 11 \u00b1 3 min) and (2) most of the mutants that have a defect in Kog1-body formation behave like the wild-type strain in the Sch9 phosphorylation assay. The only exception is the <i>snf1</i>\u0394\u00a0strain, where we see a clear defect in Sch9 dephosphorylation after 5 and 10 min of glucose starvation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). However, it is very unlikely that this defect is due to inhibition of Kog1-body formation, since the Kog1<sup>S491A/S494A</sup> strain does not have a defect in the Sch9 assay (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Instead, it appears that Snf1 regulates the TORC1 pathway by triggering Kog1 phosphorylation at Ser 491 and 494, and through an additional, unknown, mechanism."

To test this hypothesis we subjected wild-type and mutant strains to acute glucose starvation for 60 min, added 2% glucose back to the medium, and then followed Sch9 phosphorylation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). To our surprise, we saw complete, or near complete, Sch9 phosphorylation in all of our strains (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figures 5A, B</a>). However, when we repeated this experiment, but only added 0.02% or 0.1% glucose back to the medium, we saw significantly more Sch9 phosphorylation in the mutant cells than in wild-type cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figures 5C, D</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1 and 2</a>). In fact, 0.1% glucose triggered \u223c50% Sch9 phosphorylation in the wild-type strain compared with \u223c100% Sch9 phosphorylation in our strongest mutant, PrDm1 + 2 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). These results are remarkable since only 60% of wild-type cells have Kog1-bodies in our starting conditions (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>) and as a result, it should only be possible to see a 60% increase in Sch9 phosphorylation in the mutant strains (an increase from 40% activity in wild-type cells to 100% activity in mutant cells). Therefore, putting all of our band-shift data together, we conclude that Kog1-body formation acts to increase the threshold for TORC1 activation in cells subjected to medium or long-term glucose starvation."

Kog1-bodies then act to increase the threshold for TORC1 activation--probably by limiting the number of intact TORC1 molecules in the cell. In other words, Kog1-body formation helps ensure that cells commit to a starvation or quiescent state, once they have been in glucose starvation conditions for a significant period of time. This is likely important for survival in natural conditions where yeast cells are exposed to a complex and fluctuating environment, and may need to remain in a quiescent state for years (<a href=\"#bib32\">Loewith and Hall, 2011</a>)."

As part of this program, Snf1 activates phosphorylation of Kog1 at Ser 491 and 494. It is important to note, however, that Snf1-dependent phosphorylation of Kog1 is probably indirect since the sequence around Ser 491 and 494 (AVANLS*TMS*LVN) does not match known AMPK targets sites such as LRRVxS*xxNL and MKKSxS*xxDV (<a href=\"#bib16\">Gwinn et al., 2008</a>).

Studies in human cells have shown that the TSC1-TSC2 complex serves to inhibit TORC1 in the absence of pro-growth hormones and/or the presence of AMPK activity (<a href=\"#bib21\">Huang and Manning, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Inoki et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Inoki et al., 2003b</a>), while we show that Kog1-body formation serves to inhibit TORC1 in the absence of glucose and the presence of AMPK activity. It therefore appears that the mechanisms underlying TORC1 regulation diverged in early eukaryotic evolution, so that most simple eukaryotes use Kog1-body formation to regulate TORC1 signaling, while higher eukaryotes (like flies, mice and humans) use the TSC1-2 complex. Going forward, it will be important to learn more about the differences between these two regulatory mechanisms, especially as drugs targeting Kog1-bodies may be able to block the growth of fungi and worms without affecting TORC1 signaling in humans and other higher eukaryotes."

Studies in yeast, and other organisms, have shown that hundreds of proteins move into bodies, when cells are exposed to stress or starvation conditions (<a href=\"#bib36\">Narayanaswamy et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">O'Connell et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">O'Connell et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Shah et al., 2014</a>). For example, more than 30 proteins involved in mRNA decay and translation move into stress granules and P-bodies during long-term starvation (<a href=\"#bib10\">Decker and Parker, 2012</a>). However, to date, it has been difficult to pinpoint the function of RNA granules and other bodies (<a href=\"#bib10\">Decker and Parker, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">O'Connell et al., 2012</a>). We show that the movement of Kog1 into bodies acts to increase the threshold for TORC1 activation. This creates hysteresis in the TORC1 pathway and likely helps ensure that cells exposed to low levels of glucose do not try to re-enter a rapid growth state. We suggest that other protein bodies formed during stress and starvation conditions function in a similar way; setting new activation thresholds for key signaling and metabolic pathways. Further work will be needed to test this idea, and to determine if there are differences between the hysteretic behavior created by reversible protein agglomeration and other mechanisms such as feedback loops (<a href=\"#bib14\">Ferrell, 2002</a>)."

Briefly, the data in each lane of the gel was simplified by calculating the average signal intensity at each position along the length of the lane, and normalized so that the total signal matches that of the t = 0 control. The normalized data were then used to calculate a position weighted mean for each lane. This was done by defining the first pixel/data point in the gel as 100% phosphorylated and the last pixel in the gel as 0% phosphorylated. Pixels in-between these points were weighted (between 100 and 0) based on their position relative to the top and bottom of the gel (on a linear scale). The values for each position (pixel) were then summed to calculate the total amount of protein phosphorylation in a sample. Finally, since these numbers are in arbitrary units, we normalized all of the values using those found in the wild-type strain under the same conditions. This was done by multiplying the mean phosphorylation values in each strain by constant A, and adding a constant B, so that the values in the wild-type strain at time = 0 min (SD, 2% glucose) are 1.0 and time = 60 min (-G, 0% glucose) are 0.0. Error bars were then scaled using the same constants."

This change in Kog1 localization is determined to correlate to varying degrees with Kog1-dependent phosphorylation by Snf1, the presumptive ortholog of AMPK in yeast, and decreased TORC1 activity during glucose starvation, as monitored by Sch9 phosphorylation."

It will be important to demonstrate that cells expressing the Kog1 mutants have reduced fitness following either prolonged glucose starvation and/or return to glucose replete conditions. One possibility would be to test phosphomimetic substitutions to see if an inability to dephosphorylate Kog1 leads to decreased viability in low glucose. In general, because the mutants examined do not have any obvious phenotype with respect to glucose starvation per se, enthusiasm for these findings is somewhat dampened."

The nub of the story is conclusion #4, supported by evidence presented in the section \"Kog-1 body formation increases the threshold for TORC1 activation\" (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). This is where the story gets confusing. My main problem is that it is not clear to me that the rapid dephosphorylation of Sch9 (a TORC1 target) is measuring TORC1 activity. The rapidity of this event suggests to me that it could be due to an event other than inactivation of TORC1 (activation of a protein phosphatase?). This is key, because the authors' main conclusion is that Kog1-body formation regulates TORC1 function, and Sch9 dephosphorylation is their assay for TORC1 function. Is that really reporting TORC1 function? Again, the \"discovery\" \"\u2026that TORC1 inhibition precedes Kog1-body formation\u2026\" depends on Sch9 dephosphorylation being an indicator of TORC1 function. Is it? Also, \"Instead, it appears that Snf1 regulates TORC1 both by phosphorylating Kog1 at Ser491 and 494, and through an additional, unknown mechanism\" is opaque to me."

The authors' suggest that addition to cells of small amounts of glucose (0.02% - 0.1%) results in even slower movement of Kog1 from \"bodies\" to TORC1, and that's true for 0.02%, but not for 0.1% (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>).

The main finding is that glucose starvation triggers a change in localization of Kog1 from a peri-vacuolar location to a punctate vacuole-associated location termed \"Kog1 bodies\". This change in Kog1 localization is determined to correlate to varying degrees with Kog1-dependent phosphorylation by Snf1, the presumptive ortholog of AMPK in yeast, and decreased TORC1 activity during glucose starvation, as monitored by Sch9 phosphorylation. The strengths of the manuscript include the novel finding of a change in localization of an essential TORC1 component in a nutrient responsive manner and the fact that all of the data reported are solid and well controlled. There are two major concerns that need to be addressed before publication can be considered: 1) The physiological significance of these findings is unclear. Thus, the authors suggest that TORC1 activity is dampened by glucose starvation via Kog1 body formation, but the data presented do not address this directly, and some of the data using Sch9 as a readout are inconclusive, in particular with the Snf1 phosphorylation site mutants. It will be important to demonstrate that cells expressing the Kog1 mutants have reduced fitness following either prolonged glucose starvation and/or return to glucose replete conditions. One possibility would be to test phosphomimetic substitutions to see if an inability to dephosphorylate Kog1 leads to decreased viability in low glucose. In general, because the mutants examined do not have any obvious phenotype with respect to glucose starvation per se, enthusiasm for these findings is somewhat dampened.</i> "

A short time later, Young and coworkers showed that Ser 491 and 494 on Kog1 are Snf1-dependent phosphorylation sites (Braun et al., 2014). Therefore, to test if Snf1 drives Kog1-body formation by promoting phosphorylation of Ser 491 and 494, we constructed a strain carrying Kog1<sup>S491A/S494A</sup>-YFP at the native locus and monitored Kog1 localization in glucose starvation conditions.

Conclusions #1-3 seem solid and supported by unimpeachable evidence. The nub of the story is conclusion #4, supported by evidence presented in the section \"Kog-1 body formation increases the threshold for TORC1 activation\" (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). This is where the story gets confusing. My main problem is that it is not clear to me that the rapid dephosphorylation of Sch9 (a TORC1 target) is measuring TORC1 activity.
