We tested whether individual amygdala neurons encode a critical requirement for goal-directed behavior: the evaluation of progress during sequential choices. As monkeys progressed through choice sequences toward rewards, amygdala neurons showed phasic, gradually increasing responses over successive choice steps. These responses occurred in the absence of external progress cues or motor preplanning. They were often specific to self-defined sequences, typically disappearing during instructed control sequences with similar reward expectation. Their build-up rate reflected prospectively the forthcoming choice sequence, suggesting adaptation to an internal plan. Population decoding demonstrated a high-accuracy progress code. These findings indicate that amygdala neurons evaluate the progress of planned, self-defined behavioral sequences. Such progress signals seem essential for aligning stepwise choices with internal plans. Their presence in amygdala neurons may inform understanding of human conditions with amygdala dysfunction and deregulated reward pursuit."

We tested whether individual amygdala neurons encode a critical requirement for goal-directed behavior: the evaluation of progress during sequential choices. As monkeys progressed through choice sequences toward rewards, amygdala neurons showed phasic, gradually increasing responses over successive choice steps. These responses occurred in the absence of external progress cues or motor preplanning. They were often specific to self-defined sequences, typically disappearing during instructed control sequences with similar reward expectation. Their build-up rate reflected prospectively the forthcoming choice sequence, suggesting adaptation to an internal plan. Population decoding demonstrated a high-accuracy progress code. These findings indicate that amygdala neurons evaluate the progress of planned, self-defined behavioral sequences. Such progress signals seem essential for aligning stepwise choices with internal plans. Their presence in amygdala neurons may inform understanding of human conditions with amygdala dysfunction and deregulated reward pursuit."

They occurred in the absence of external progress cues that could have induced sensory evidence accumulation and in the absence of opportunities for motor preplanning. The gradual amygdala responses were mostly specific to free, internally guided choices as they typically disappeared in externally instructed sequences, despite similar behavioral reward expectation. Importantly, their gradual build-up rate readily adapted to the forthcoming, internally planned choice sequence length, suggesting reference to an internal plan. Decoding analysis showed that the neuronal population provided a highly accurate progress code. These data suggest that primate amygdala neurons encode internally evaluated progress during planned economic choice sequences. Such gradual activity seems suited to support multistep decision-making and motivational regulation during the pursuit of self-defined distant rewards."

We focused our main reaction time analysis on the latencies with which the animals released a touch key at the end of a trial to initiate reinforcer delivery (liquid reward on spend trials, auditory cue on save trials).

We focused on key release latencies because in the present task they may reflect more closely the animal\u2019s reward expectancy compared to saccadic reaction times, as key release was the final behavioral response required before reinforcer delivery. Key release reaction times shortened with sequence progress, separately for spend and save trials (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>), which suggested higher motivation in later trials of a sequence. The effect was significant when controlling for other task-relevant variables including subjective choice values (p&lt;0.001, partial correlation). The relationship between reaction times and sequence progress depended on the final length of each sequence: reaction times declined at a\u00a0faster rate with the progress of shorter sequences (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>), indicating that the animals adjusted their motivation according to planned sequence length. In the imperative control task, reaction times also decreased with sequence progress depending on anticipated sequence length (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Statistical modeling of reaction times from both tasks in the same multiple regression model suggested that the strongest factors across tasks were sequence progress and current-trial save-spend choice. An additional regressor for task type (free choice vs. imperative task) and its interaction with other variables accounted for insignificant portions of variance (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Critically, the influence of sequence progress on reaction times did not depend on task type, suggesting similar behavioral relevance for sequence progress across tasks. Saccadic reaction times, measured as the latency from the\u00a0choice cue onset to fixation of the chosen cue were also related to sequence progress (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>), although the effect was smaller compared to key release latencies and had a positive rather than negative direction.

The activity increased gradually over consecutive trials within a sequence and reset with the start of a new sequence (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). This gradual activity occurred specifically in the cue phase and preceding fixation phase (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>); it was neither a tonic increase in baseline activity nor a trial outcome response. Crucially, there were no external cues that could have signaled current trial position; accordingly, the observed activity reflected purely internal tracking of sequence progress. The graded activity disappeared in the cue phase of the imperative task, when behavior was externally instructed (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>), confirming the relationship to an internal process. Regression analysis (<a href=\"#equ2\">Equation 2</a>) established a linear, trial-by-trial relationship between cue-period activity and sequence progress in the free choice task (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>) but not in the imperative task (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). Importantly, sensory stimulation, motor requirements and behavioral reward expectation were matched between free choice and imperative task, and random cue positions precluded planning of action sequences. This suggested that the gradually increasing activity did not reflect sensory evidence accumulation or preparation of a motor response. Thus, at the time of choice on each trial, the neuron showed gradually increasing activity related to sequence progress, specifically during internally guided choice sequences."

                                "text": "Linear regression (<a href=\"#equ2\">Equation 2</a>) identified amygdala neurons with progress-related activity in different trial periods (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>), including pre-choice periods before the animal indicated its current-trial choice (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, left), and post-choice periods before outcome (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, middle) and after outcome (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, right). A significant majority of progress-related activities increased (rather than decreased) over consecutive trials within a sequence (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>; 294/408 responses with positive regression slope, <a href=\"#equ2\">Equation 2</a>, 72%; p=1.0 \u00d7 10<sup>\u221219</sup>, binomial test). We compared neuronal progress encoding between free choice and imperative tasks in a subset of neurons recorded in both tasks (N\u00a0=\u00a0155). Although a fraction of these neurons also showed progress-related activity in the imperative task, the significant majority showed progress-related activity specifically during free choices (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>; p&lt;0.001, z-test for dependent samples). This suggested that progress signals were mostly specific to a situation that required internally guided behavior. Consistent with this observation, at the\u00a0population level, the strength of neuronal progress coding transiently declined on trials when the animals committed an error (failed to perform a correct saccade or prematurely released the touch key), and subsequently reappeared on the following trials (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). This result suggested a relationship between amygdala progress signals and the animals\u2019 performance. Sliding window regression identified progress activities in a similar numbers of neurons as the main fixed-window regression (214/326 neurons, 65.64%, <a href=\"#equ2\">Equation 2</a>) and confirmed their occurrence throughout different task periods (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>). The majority of sequence progress activities were phasic responses that occurred transiently at specific task events and subsequently disappeared (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>), rather than reflecting lasting, tonic modulations in activity. Additional multiple regression models confirmed the robustness of these results and distinguished sequence progress activities from closely related task-relevant variables (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). For example, few neuronal responses (27/408, 6.6%) reflected sequence progress in addition to previously described sequence length signals, suggesting distinct encoding of sequence progress and length. Our strictest regression model included sequence progress in addition to planning variables (sequence value, sequence length, <a href=\"#equ7\">Equation 7</a>) and current-trial save-spend choice. This model identified 127 neurons with relation to sequence progress (39%) of which 31 neurons (10% of all recorded neurons) encoded sequence progress without relation to explicit planning variables or choices, suggesting a significant number of neurons with \u2018pure\u2019 progress activity. For comparison, 78 neurons (24%) neurons encoded \u2018pure\u2019 planning activities (i.e. not coding choice or progress variables) and 112 neurons (34%) encoded \u2018pure\u2019 choice activities (i.e. not coding planning or progress variables). Thus, amygdala progress neurons were in many cases distinct from previously described planning and choice neurons (<a href=\"#bib20\">Grabenhorst et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Hernadi et al., 2015</a>). Histological reconstruction located the recording sites in amygdala. Although neurons with progress-related activity occurred in both basolateral and centromedial amygdala regions (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>), they occurred significantly more frequently in the basolateral amygdala (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H</a>)."

The neuron in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013B</a>, showed exactly this kind of neuronal adaptation. During short sequences of less than five trials, progress activity rose steeply from baseline to a maximum of about 40 Hz (regression slope from unbinned data, <a href=\"#equ2\">Equation 2</a>: 7.33), whereas for longer sequences, activity increased at a\u00a0much lower rate (slope: 2.14). We further examined adaptation by pooling data across neurons. As for the single neuron, increases in population activity with sequence progress were steep for short sequences and successively shallower for longer sequences (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,D</a>). This was quantified by a linear positive relationship between the rate of activity increase (population progress slope) and inverse sequence length (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>).

After a steep activity increase during two-trial sequences, activity increase was much shallower during immediately following five-trial sequences (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>). This rapid downward adaption of progress slope reversed when sequential order was reversed, i.e. when a two-trial sequence followed a five-trial sequence (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H</a>). We quantified this dynamic adaptation across all pairs of consecutive saving sequences by a significant regression of the (signed) progress activity slope difference on the (signed) difference in sequence length (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4I</a>). Thus, the\u00a0amygdala progress activity adapted its rate of increase flexibly and rapidly from one sequence to the next to reflect the\u00a0current planned sequence length."

Accordingly, we examined whether single-neuron activity was best fit by an adaptive model that normalized sequence progress by sequence length (<a href=\"#equ3\">Equation 3</a>, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Linear regression revealed that this adaptive progress model explained a higher number of responses than a non-adaptive progress model (447 vs. 408 significant responses, <a href=\"#equ3\">Equation 3</a> vs. <a href=\"#equ2\">Equation 2</a>), with a significantly higher number of best fits (391 vs. 104 responses with higher R<sup>2</sup> for adaptive model; p&lt;1.0 \u00d7 10<sup>\u221223</sup>, z-test for dependent samples). Across all responses that were significant for both models, the R<sup>2</sup> distribution was shifted significantly towards the adaptive model (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>, left) and the R<sup>2</sup> difference between models was significantly in favor of the adaptive model (p=3.2 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22128</sup>, one-sample t-test). A stepwise regression in which both models competed to explain neuronal responses also favored the adaptive model (284 vs. 121 significant responses). The adaptive sequence progress model also proved superior to other alternatives (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013B</a>), including models based on the\u00a0accumulated reward magnitude (saved juice, <a href=\"#equ4\">Equation 4</a>), elapsed time (incorporating error trials, <a href=\"#equ5\">Equation 5</a>), and tuning to specific sequence steps (<a href=\"#equ6\">Equation 6</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In all cases, the adaptive progress model explained a higher number of responses, with a significantly higher number of best fits (all p&lt;1.0 \u00d7 10<sup>\u221220</sup>, z-test for dependent samples), and with significant shifts in R<sup>2</sup> distribution towards the adaptive model (all p&lt;1.0 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22127</sup>, one-sample t-test). We also tested a partial adaptive progress model that included both adaptive and non-adaptive progress regressors in the same regression model (<a href=\"#equ8\">Equation 8</a>). This analysis was motivated by the observation that the\u00a0population activity on spend trials varied to some extent across different sequence lengths (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>), which suggested that adaptation may have been incomplete. The partial adaptation model was also motivated by related approaches in economics (<a href=\"#bib30\">Koszegi and Rabin, 2006</a>) that model dependence of individuals\u2019 preferences on external reference points using partial adaptation, although with different formalisms. Similar to the full adaptive model, a\u00a0partial adaptation provided a better fit to the data than the non-adaptive model (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1F</a>). However, even though some individual responses were better explained by partial adaptation compared to full adaptation (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1G</a>), and aspects of population activity seemed more consistent with partial adaptation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>), on average both full adaptation and partial adaptation fit the data equally well (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1F</a>) and explained similar numbers of responses (full adaptive model: 447/1126 task-related responses, 39.7%; partial adaptive model: 435/1126 responses, 38.6%). Thus, an adaptive model that normalized sequence progress by sequence length provided a suitable characterization of the population of amygdala responses."

Notably, in the fixation period, decoding performance was significantly higher for basolateral neurons, whereas in the cue period performance was significantly higher for centromedial neurons (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>). Regional differences were also evident when adding different numbers of neurons to the classifier. In the fixation period, adding more neurons increased performance for both basolateral and centromedial neurons, with overall higher accuracy for basolateral neurons (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G</a>). By contrast, in the cue period, accuracy increased substantially as more centromedial neurons were added, with significantly lower accuracy increases for basolateral neurons (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6H</a>). Subset analyses confirmed the relative importance of centromedial neurons for cue-phase decoding. In the fixation period, the relative number of centromedial neurons in a decoding subset had no impact on performance (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6I</a>). By contrast, in the cue phase, adding more centromedial neurons (relative to basolateral neurons) significantly increased decoding accuracy, even irrespective of their progress sensitivities, which were covariates in the analysis (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6J</a>). Thus, although neurons from both basolateral and centromedial amygdala allowed accurate progress decoding, there were significant regional differences between fixation and cue periods, potentially related to distinct behavioral requirements of these task periods (e.g. internal valuation during fixation compared to response to external events during the\u00a0cue period)."

                        "text": "We identified gradual, stepwise responses in amygdala neurons as monkeys executed economic choice sequences according to internal plans. These responses occurred in the absence of external progress cues and without opportunities to preplan specific actions. They were often specific for internally guided choice sequences, despite similar behavioral reward expectation in free choice and imperative control task. The slope of the gradual responses reflected prospectively the forthcoming choice sequence lengths, readily from one sequence to the next, suggesting adaptation to the animal\u2019s internal behavioral plan. Accordingly, gradual amygdala activity was best described in terms of adaptive sequence progress (normalized by planned sequence length), rather than by reward expectation or timing models. Sequence progress activity fluctuated with performance as it was diminished on error trials and subsequently reinstated, suggesting the\u00a0behavioral relevance of progress signals. Linear population decoding suggested a progress code that can be read out with high accuracy by downstream neurons. These gradual responses contrast markedly with other amygdala activities observed in the same reward-saving task: rather than directly predicting single-trial choices or choice sequences (<a href=\"#bib20\">Grabenhorst et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Hernadi et al., 2015</a>), the present activities changed dynamically over consecutive trials as a function of sequence progress. Such continual evaluation of progress in amygdala neurons seems crucial for aligning individual choices with behavioral plans and for successfully navigating toward reward goals (<a href=\"#bib8\">Benhabib and Bisin, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Berkman and Lieberman, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Johnson and Busemeyer, 2001</a>). These data implicate gradual amygdala responses in the evaluation of progress during internally planned choice sequences and support a role for the primate amygdala in advanced economic behaviors."

The majority of the presently described progress-related activities are probably not directly derived from these basic, reactive reward functions. First, in many neurons, the responses occurred specifically during freely determined choice sequences but not in closely matched imperative sequences. Notably, reaction time patterns were similar between both tasks, suggesting matched behavioral reward expectation. Second, gradual activity was better described by an adaptive progress model than by explicit reward expectation or timing. This neuronal adaptation was also specific to the free choice task, despite behavioral reaction time adaptation in both tasks. A minority of neurons showed non-adaptive gradual activity in both free choice and imperative tasks, potentially reflecting reward expectation or affective state regulation. In a previous study, primate amygdala neurons during visually guided reward schedules responded to sequence onset, aspects of the cued schedule, and reward delivery, without tracking schedule progress (<a href=\"#bib73\">Sugase-Miyamoto and Richmond, 2005</a>). We suggest that our internally guided choice task, which allowed the animals to plan behavior over several steps, potentially engaged amygdala neurons to a greater extent than purely visually instructed tasks. The lower percentage of progress activities we observed in the imperative task is consistent with this interpretation. Thus, although activity in some neurons matched known amygdala reward expectation signals, the majority of amygdala progress activities reported here were unlikely due to basic reward expectation or affective reactions to external stimuli."

Accordingly, the functional significance of the present gradual activities likely depends on a neuron\u2019s precise outputs. Amygdala progress-related activity during choice sequences could provide inputs for decision computations (<a href=\"#bib15\">Deco et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Wang, 2002</a>) in cortical areas to which the amygdala projects. This could apply especially to basolateral neurons with projections to anterior cingulate cortex, where gradual activity changes occur in multistep reward schedules (<a href=\"#bib66\">Shidara and Richmond, 2002</a>) and foraging tasks (<a href=\"#bib23\">Hayden et al., 2011</a>), and to orbitofrontal cortex, where neurons signal economic values during single-trial choices (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kennerley et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Padoa-Schioppa, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Padoa-Schioppa and Assad, 2006</a>). Consistent with this suggestion, reward value coding in orbitofrontal cortex depends partly on the integrity of the amygdala (<a href=\"#bib58\">Rudebeck and Murray, 2008</a>). In amygdala neurons with striatal projections, gradual activity could potentially exert a more direct influence on action, as amygdala-striatal connections are implicated in reward-seeking behavior (<a href=\"#bib43\">Namburi et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Stuber et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Tye et al., 2008</a>). This possibility seems consistent with the behavioral consequences of amygdala lesions (<a href=\"#bib4\">Baxter and Murray, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bechara et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Brand et al., 2007</a>). Although amygdala inactivation does not cause deficits in object choice once reward values have been updated (<a href=\"#bib78\">Wellman et al., 2005</a>), the amygdala is thought to make essential contributions to reward-guided behavior in situations that required dynamic valuations (<a href=\"#bib41\">Murray and Rudebeck, 2013</a>). Furthermore, gradual activity in amygdala neurons with outputs to attentional and autonomic effector systems (<a href=\"#bib51\">Peck et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Price, 2003</a>) could serve to progressively focus cognitive and motivational resources during internally directed choice sequences. These interpretations of the behavioral relevance of amygdala progress signals are supported in the present study by relationships between progress signals and performance on error trials, and by relationships between some amygdala neurons and the animals\u2019 reaction times. Finally, we suggest that gradual activity in amygdala neurons with predominantly local connections could participate in putative decision computations within local amygdala circuits. From this perspective, the progress-related amygdala activity in the current task could be interpreted as reflecting the animal\u2019s gradually increasing intention to make a spend choice. This suggestion is supported by the existence of explicit spend choice signals in amygdala neurons (<a href=\"#bib20\">Grabenhorst et al., 2012</a>) (which reflect the output of a decision computation), decision deficits in humans with amygdala lesions (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bechara et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Brand et al., 2007</a>), decision-related activations in human imaging studies (<a href=\"#bib14\">De Martino et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Grabenhorst et al., 2013</a>), and with features of amygdala inhibitory microcircuits (<a href=\"#bib16\">Duvarci and Pare, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Janak and Tye, 2015</a>) that could support neural choice mechanisms by winner-take-all competition through mutual inhibition (<a href=\"#bib15\">Deco et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Wang, 2002</a>). Although some amygdala neurons showed lasting, tonic activity modulation by sequence progress, most progress responses were phasic and time-locked to individual task events, suggesting they may have played specific roles during task performance, rather than reflect lasting changes in the animal\u2019s state. Overall, gradual activity patterns in amygdala neurons could reflect a number of underlying processes related to behavioral control, decision-making, and the regulation of motivation, attention and affective state. This interpretation is supported by our finding that some individual neurons and population activity also exhibited gradual patterns in the imperative task, which likely reflected reward expectation and related processes. However, our main result that progress activity in a group of amygdala neurons was adapted to internal plans and occurred specifically during free choices seems more closely linked to internally guided decision processes. Testing these possibilities will likely require a circuit-based approach, e.g. using optogenetics tools, to examine the presently characterized gradual responses in amygdala subpopulations with defined projection targets (<a href=\"#bib26\">Janak and Tye, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Namburi et al., 2015</a>)."

This ramping activity is thought to reflect sensory evidence accumulation or motor response preparation through integration-to-bound or evidence accumulation mechanisms (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hanes and Schall, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Maimon and Assad, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Mazurek et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Murakami et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Okano and Tanji, 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Roitman and Shadlen, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Romo and Schultz, 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Schultz and Romo, 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Shadlen and Newsome, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Stuphorn et al., 2010</a>). Similar ramping activities also occur in reward structures including monkey striatum and amygdala, where neurons show ramping activity to reward-predicting cues on single trials (<a href=\"#bib10\">Bermudez and Schultz, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Schultz, 2015</a>). Our results differ from these previous studies in important respects. In contrast to perceptual decisions or motor preparation, our task did not provide external stimuli to elicit evidence accumulation nor did it allow preplanning of specific motor responses. Furthermore, the presently reported gradual amygdala activity is morphologically different from ramping activity: it was not confined to the timescale of individual trials but reoccurred as a phasic response during choice sequences lasting up to two minutes. Finally, although resembling gradual activity observed in anterior cingulate cortex during foraging (<a href=\"#bib23\">Hayden et al., 2011</a>), the present gradual amygdala responses were mostly specific free choice situations (an aspect not tested in the previous study) and adapted prospectively to the monkey\u2019s internal behavioral plan, rather than monitoring value changes of a foraging patch in the external environment."

Accurate signaling of progress is critical for guiding step-by-step choices according to internal plans and for regulating motivation during the pursuit of reward goals (<a href=\"#bib9\">Berkman and Lieberman, 2009</a>). Adaptation is a fundamental process that enables accurate coding of variables by neurons with a limited activity range (<a href=\"#bib18\">Fairhall et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Laughlin, 1981</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Schultz, 2015</a>). Across neurons, our data were consistent with both full adaptation and partial adaptation to planned sequence length. Conceivably, incomplete adaptation in some neurons may enhance flexibility of sequence progress encoding across a neuronal population by retaining some information about the absolute, non-adapted sequence length. Our model of partial adaptation was motivated by related approaches in economics (<a href=\"#bib30\">Koszegi and Rabin, 2006</a>) that model dependence of individuals\u2019 preferences on external reference points using partial adaptation, although with different formalisms. Our population decoding results, obtained using linear, biologically plausible classifiers, confirm the accuracy of progress coding across the population of amygdala neurons. Previously reported amygdala neurons signaling length and value of planned sequences (<a href=\"#bib24\">Hernadi et al., 2015</a>) seem well suited to guide this prospective adaptation, although the underlying neurophysiological mechanism remains unclear. As our neurophysiological experiments were necessarily restricted to choice sequences lasting up to several minutes, our data do not provide evidence concerning planned behaviors over even longer timescales, which likely involve additional mechanisms."

Experimental procedures for neurophysiological recordings from awake behaving macaque monkeys have previously been described (<a href=\"#bib10\">Bermudez and Schultz, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Grabenhorst et al., 2012</a>). Two adult male rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta), weighing 9.2 and 12.0 kg, participated in the present experiments. A head holder and recording chamber were fixed to the skull under general anesthesia and aseptic conditions. The number of animals used is typical for primate neurophysiology experiments. We used bone marks on coronal and sagittal radiographs to localize the anatomical position of the amygdala in reference to the stereotaxically implanted chamber (<a href=\"#bib2\">Aggleton and Passingham, 1981</a>). We recorded single-neuron activity extracellularly, using standard electrophysiological techniques, from dorsal, lateral, and basal amygdala."

This procedure resulted in a database of 326 neurons which we analyzed statistically. The number of neurons is similar to those reported in previous studies on primate amygdala.

The\u00a0animals were required to fixate within 2\u20134\u00b0 for 1500 ms plus mean of 500 ms (truncated exponential distribution). We monitored eye position using an infrared eye tracking system at 125 Hz (ETL200; ISCAN). Two save and spend visual stimuli of 7.0\u00b0 then appeared on the left and right side of the monitor (pseudorandomized). In blocks of typically 40\u2013100 consecutive trials, we used different pre-trained stimuli as save cues to indicate different interest rates. (Each neuron was typically tested with one to two different interest rates. The duration required for testing neurons with statistically sufficient numbers of trials in both free choice and imperative tasks usually precluded using more than two interest rates) Animals could indicate their choice with a saccade towards the save or spend cue as soon as the cues appeared. The chosen stimulus was replaced by a peripheral fixation spot of 7.0\u00b0 of visual angle. Following a delay of 1500 ms, the peripheral fixation spot changed color and signaled the animal to release the touch key which resulted in delivery of the reinforcer (auditory or visual cue on save trials vs. a liquid reward on spend trials). Crucially, there were no external cues that signaled sequence progress to the animals. Thus, the animals were required to track progress internally. Failures of key touch or fixation resulted in trial cancellation; more than three sequential errors led to a pause in behavioral testing. Accumulated saved rewards were retained across error trials. The animals were overtrained by the time of neuronal recording and showed consistent, meaningful saving behavior for different interest rates without further signs of learning."

The instruction cue indicated the correct choice on each trial. Trials were otherwise identical to a free choice trial. We matched the ratio of save to spend trials between imperative and free choice task for each monkey and interest rate to allow the animals to anticipate reward amounts which we confirmed by behavioral reaction times (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The imperative task was performed for a subset of recorded neurons in a separate trial block. For these neurons, the tasks were on average counterbalanced so that either the free choice or imperative task was recorded first. Although we matched sequence lengths between both tasks for specific animals and interest rates, the counterbalanced order meant that for some sessions sequence lengths were not perfectly matched (e.g. if the imperative task was performed first and the animal subsequently produced a larger or smaller range of sequences during free choice). However, this is unlikely to be a major factor in our results as mean sequence lengths were highly correlated between pairs of free choice and imperative sessions (R\u00a0=\u00a00.527, p=2.1 \u00d7 10<sup>\u221212</sup>) and sequence length ranges did not differ significantly on average (p=0.949, t-test)."

We identified task-related responses by comparing activity in the Fixation, Cue, Delay and Outcome periods to a control period (Pre-fixation) using the Wilcoxon test (p&lt;0.0083, Bonferroni-corrected for multiple comparisons). A neuron was included as task-related if its activity in at least one task period was significantly different to that in the control period. Because the Pre-fixation period served as control period we did not select for task-relatedness in this period and included all neurons with observed impulses in the analysis. We chose the pre-fixation period as a\u00a0control period because it was the earliest period at the start of a trial in which no sensory stimuli were presented. Our analysis strategy was to first examine gradual amygdala responses with a single linear regression model to determine how many responses could be described in terms of a linearly increasing (or decreasing) activity pattern. We used single linear regression in fixed time windows around task events as this provided the most direct way to detect and interpret such gradual activity patterns, and to allow direct comparison with results from previous studies using similar sequential choice tasks (<a href=\"#bib23\">Hayden et al., 2011</a>). We used different single linear regressions to distinguish whether gradual activities were best described in terms of linear increase, or various non-linear increases related to task variables of interest. We also used a multiple stepwise regression model (<a href=\"#equ7\">Equation 7</a>) as an alternative analysis to determine the number of gradual responses when other task-relevant variables were accounted for. We also used additional sliding window regressions in combination with a bootstrap method without pre-selecting task-related responses to confirm that our results did not depend on the pre-selection of task-related responses or definition of fixed analysis windows. Finally, population decoding examined independence of our findings from pre-selection of task-related responses and served to assess information about gradual activity contained in the neuronal population. The\u00a0statistical significance of regression coefficients was determined with a t-test using p&lt;0.05 as criterion. All tests performed were two-sided. Each neuronal response was tested with the following regression models:"

To determine whether neuronal activity was significantly related to sequence progress we used a bootstrap approach based on shuffled data as follows. For each neuron, we performed the sliding window regression 1000 times on trial-shuffled data and determined a false positive rate by counting the number of consecutive windows in which a regression was significant with p&lt;0.05. We found that less than five per cent of neurons with trial-shuffled data showed more than eight consecutive significant analysis windows. Therefore, we counted a sliding window analysis as significant if a neuron showed a significant (p&lt;0.05) effect for more than eight consecutive windows."

The SVM classifier was trained on a set of training data to find a linear hyperplane that provided the best separation between patterns of neuronal population activity defined by a grouping variable based on sequence progress. Decoding was typically not improved by non-linear (e.g. quadratic) kernels. The NN classifier was similarly trained on a set of test data and decoding was performed by assigning each trial to the group of its nearest neighbor in a space defined by the distribution of impulse rates for the different levels of the grouping variables using the Euclidean distance (<a href=\"#bib54\">Quian Quiroga et al., 2006</a>). Both SVM and NN classification are biologically plausible in that a downstream neuron could perform similar classification by comparing the input on a given trial with a stored vector of synaptic weights. Both classifiers performed qualitatively similar, although SVM decoding was typically more accurate."

We used all recorded neurons that met inclusion criteria for a minimum trial number, without pre-selecting for value coding, except where explicitly stated. We only included neurons in the decoding analyses that had a minimum number of five trials per group for which decoding was performed, and we confirmed that results were very similar when changing this minimum number to 10 trials. For each decoding analysis, we created three n by m matrices with n columns determined by the number of neurons and m rows determined by the number of trials. We defined three matrices, one for each group for which decoding was performed. These included separate groups for low, medium, and high sequence progress, determined for each neuron by calculating sequence progress terciles. (We obtained very similar results by repeating the decoding analyses based on progress quartiles) Thus, each cell in a matrix contained the impulse rate from a single neuron on a single trial measured for a given group. Because neurons were not simultaneously recorded, we randomly matched up trials from different neurons for the same group and then repeated the decoding analysis with different random trial matching (within-group trial matching) 150 times. We found these repetition numbers to produce very stable classification results. (We note that this approach likely provides a lower bound for decoding performance as it ignores potential contributions from cross-correlations between neurons; investigation of cross-correlations would require data from simultaneously recorded neurons) We used a leave-one-out cross-validation procedure whereby a classifier was trained to learn the mapping from impulse rates to groups on all trials except one; the remaining trial was then used for testing the classifier and the procedure repeated until all trials had been tested. The\u00a0results were very similar by using 80% of trials as training data and 20% as test data."

Decoding could typically not be improved by using radial basis function or quadratic kernels. The NN decoding was performed in Matlab using custom-written code. We quantified decoding accuracy as the percentage of correctly classified trials, averaged over all decoding analyses for different random within-group trial matchings. To investigate how decoding accuracy depended on population size, we randomly selected a given number of neurons at each step and then determined the percentage correct. For each step (i.e. each possible population size) this procedure was repeated 100 times. We also performed decoding for randomly shuffled data (shuffled group assignment without replacement) with 1500\u20135000 iterations to test whether decoding on real data differed significantly from chance. Statistical significance was determined by comparing vectors of percentage correct decoding accuracy between real data and randomly shuffled data using the rank sum test (<a href=\"#bib54\">Quian Quiroga et al., 2006</a>). For all analyses, decoding was performed on neuronal responses taken from the same task period."

They found that nearly half of the 326 task-responsive neurons recorded showed gradually increasing activity as the sequence progressed in length, peaking when the animals chose the spend option and received their accumulated reward. Moreover, rate increases in activity adapted to the choice sequence length, consistent with principles of adaptive coding. This pattern of activity was not observed when spend or save decisions were externally instructed. Finally, the authors show that sequence progress can be linearly decoded, suggesting it is possible for a progress code to be read out by downstream areas/neurons."

Briefly, statistical examination with multiple regression (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>) showed that a task indicator variable (free choice vs. imperative) did not explain additional variance in key touch reaction times compared to other task-relevant variables (neither did interaction effects between the task indicator and sequence progress). This result suggests that the influence of our main variable sequence progress on reaction times did not depend on task type, suggesting similar behavioral relevance for sequence progress across tasks. With respect to neuronal data and reaction times, some neuronal responses were indeed related to reaction times in a multiple regression that controlled for other variables (Results, section \u2018Reaction time control analysis\u2019). However, these neuronal reaction time effects did not account for our main finding of sequence progress coding. We found no significant differences between basolateral and centromedial amygdala neurons with respect to relations to reaction times.
