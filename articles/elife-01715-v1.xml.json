                    "text": "Transmitter release at synapses is regulated by preceding neuronal activity, which can give rise to short-term enhancement of release like post-tetanic potentiation (PTP). Diacylglycerol (DAG) and Protein-kinase C (PKC) signaling in the nerve terminal have been widely implicated in the short-term modulation of transmitter release, but the target protein of PKC phosphorylation during short-term enhancement has remained unknown. Here, we use a gene-replacement strategy at the calyx of Held, a large CNS model synapse that expresses robust PTP, to study the molecular mechanisms of PTP. We find that two PKC phosphorylation sites of Munc18-1 are critically important for PTP, which identifies the presynaptic target protein for the action of PKC during PTP. Pharmacological experiments show that a phosphatase normally limits the duration of PTP, and that PTP is initiated by the action of a \u2018conventional\u2019 PKC isoform. Thus, a dynamic PKC phosphorylation/de-phosphorylation cycle of Munc18-1 drives short-term enhancement of transmitter release during PTP."

                    "text": "Transmitter release at synapses is regulated by preceding neuronal activity, which can give rise to short-term enhancement of release like post-tetanic potentiation (PTP). Diacylglycerol (DAG) and Protein-kinase C (PKC) signaling in the nerve terminal have been widely implicated in the short-term modulation of transmitter release, but the target protein of PKC phosphorylation during short-term enhancement has remained unknown. Here, we use a gene-replacement strategy at the calyx of Held, a large CNS model synapse that expresses robust PTP, to study the molecular mechanisms of PTP. We find that two PKC phosphorylation sites of Munc18-1 are critically important for PTP, which identifies the presynaptic target protein for the action of PKC during PTP. Pharmacological experiments show that a phosphatase normally limits the duration of PTP, and that PTP is initiated by the action of a \u2018conventional\u2019 PKC isoform. Thus, a dynamic PKC phosphorylation/de-phosphorylation cycle of Munc18-1 drives short-term enhancement of transmitter release during PTP."

Small packages called vesicles play an important role in this process. The arrival of an electrical action potential at the nerve terminal of the first cell causes some vesicles in the cell to fuse with the cell membrane, and this leads to the neurotransmitters inside the vesicles being released into the synapse. The neurotransmitters then bind to receptors on the second cell, which leads to an electrical signal in the second cell. A protein called Munc18-1 has a central role in the fusion of the vesicle at the cell membrane."

Now, Gen\u00e7 et al. have genetically modified a mouse synapse in vivo and shown that protein kinase C brings about post-tetanic potentiation by phosphorylating Munc18-1. Furthermore, pharmacological experiments show that proteins called phosphatases, which de-phosphorylate proteins, normally terminate the post-tetanic potentiation after about one minute. Taken together, the study identifies a target protein which is phosphorylated by protein kinase C during post-tetanic potentiation. The study also suggests that in addition to its fundamental role in vesicle fusion, the phosphorylation state of Munc18-1 can change the probability of vesicle fusion in a more subtle way, thereby contributing to synaptic plasticity."

Interestingly, transmitter release is not static, but the amount of quanta released with each presynaptic action potential (AP) can vary dynamically, depending on the recent history of presynaptic activity. During high-frequency activity, short-term depression leads to a decrease of release in many synapses, but following recovery from depression, transmitter release can overshoot, giving rise to short-term enhancement of release. Various forms of short-term enhancement, like facilitation, augmentation and post-tetanic potentiation (PTP), have been observed and discriminated based on their duration (<a href=\"#bib38\">Magleby and Zengel, 1975</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Zucker and Regehr, 2002</a>). There is good evidence that the longer-lasting of these, augmentation and PTP, depend on the activation of intracellular second messengers in the nerve terminal, which in turn influence the release machinery."

The other common form of short-term enhancement, PTP, has been observed at excitatory synapses in hippocampus (<a href=\"#bib39\">McNaughton, 1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Lee et al., 2007</a>), cerebellum (<a href=\"#bib2\">Beierlein et al., 2007</a>), calyx of Held brainstem synapses (<a href=\"#bib17\">Habets and Borst, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Korogod et al., 2005</a>) and at the neuromuscular junction (<a href=\"#bib38\">Magleby and Zengel, 1975</a>).

Munc18-1 has two consensus sites for PKC phosphorylation (<a href=\"#bib15\">Fujita et al., 1996</a>) which become phosphorylated during depolarization of synaptosomes (<a href=\"#bib9\">de Vries et al., 2000</a>), and which are necessary for phorbol ester potentiation of transmitter release in cultured neurons (<a href=\"#bib59\">Wierda et al., 2007</a>). Therefore, Munc18-1 is a candidate for PKC phosphorylation during PTP. Nevertheless, there are other presynaptic proteins which might act as PKC targets. First, SNAP-25 and Synaptotagmin-1 (Syt1) have PKC consensus sites (<a href=\"#bib52\">Shimazaki et al., 1996</a>, <a href=\"#bib66\">Hilfiker et al., 1999</a>). However, no evidence was found for an involvement of SNAP-25 in the phorbol ester potentiation of synaptic transmission in hippocampal neurons (<a href=\"#bib13\">Finley et al., 2003</a>), and the PKC/CaM kinase consensus site in Syt1 is not conserved in Syt2 (<a href=\"#bib42\">Nagy et al., 2006</a>). Since robust PTP is also observed at synapses which express Syt2 as their main Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor, like the calyx of Held and neuromuscular synapses (<a href=\"#bib44\">Pang et al., 2006</a>), Syt1 is unlikely a general phosphorylation target for the induction of PTP. Second, ion channels like voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channels and Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels are targets of PKC phosphorylation (<a href=\"#bib63\">Zamponi et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Song et al., 2005</a>). However, studies at the calyx synapse have shown only marginal changes in the presynaptic AP waveform or presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx during PTP (<a href=\"#bib18\">Habets and Borst, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Korogod et al., 2007</a>), or during phorbol ester mediated potentiation of transmitter release (<a href=\"#bib36\">Lou et al., 2005</a>, <a href=\"#bib35\">2008</a>). These findings argue against a major role of ion channel phosphorylation during PKC-dependent short-term enhancement of release. Therefore, it is attractive to hypothesize that a protein of the release machinery is a PKC target during short-term enhancement, and Munc18-1 is an interesting candidate for this role."

Since PTP has been observed mainly at synapses of acute preparations but not in cultured synapses, we developed an in vivo gene replacement strategy at the calyx of Held synapse, a large CNS model synapse at which PTP measurements are well established (see references above). We used a floxed mouse line in which exon 2 of the Munc18-1 coding gene <i>Stxbp1</i> is flanked by loxP sites (called <i>Munc18-1</i><sup><i>lox/lox</i></sup> mice; <a href=\"#bib20\">Heeroma et al., 2004</a>), combined with in vivo virus-mediated protein expression (<a href=\"#bib60\">Wimmer et al., 2004</a>) to recombine the floxed allele, and to re-express mutant or wild-type Munc18-1 protein. Using these approaches, we show that a transient PKC phosphorylation of Munc18-1 causes the increased transmitter release that underlies PTP. These results identify Munc18-1 as a PKC target protein during PTP, and suggest that Munc18-1, besides its essential role in catalyzing membrane fusion, can mediate a second-messenger modulation of the release machinery during presynaptic plasticity."

These findings are consistent with the view that PTP largely represents an increase in the amount of released quanta (<a href=\"#bib27\">Korogod et al., 2005</a>), and that a significant increase in mEPSC amplitude, maybe caused by compound fusion, is only observed with stronger PTP induction stimuli (<a href=\"#bib19\">He et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Xue and Wu, 2010</a>).

We therefore wanted to find further evidence that the action of a phosphatase is related to an initial PKC phosphorylation step. Furthermore, we wanted to distinguish pharmacologically whether \u2018novel\u2019 or \u2018conventional\u2019 PKCs initiate PTP (<a href=\"#bib43\">Newton, 2001</a>). For this purpose, we made use of cell-permeable inhibitory peptides directed either against the conventional PKC isoforms \u03b1 and \u03b2\u0399\u2212\u0399\u0399 (called PKCi), or against protein kinase A in a control experiment (called PKAi). We measured PTP in slices pre-incubated either with PKAi or with PKCi at 10 \u00b5M each (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>; see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 for procedures of drug application). PKCi strongly suppressed PTP (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>; p&lt;0.001), whereas PTP was normal in the presence of PKAi (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>). The baseline synaptic strength was similar under both conditions (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>; p=0.92). Since large EPSCs usually show smaller (relative) PTP at the calyx synapse (<a href=\"#bib27\">Korogod et al., 2005</a>), we plotted the amount of PTP vs EPSC amplitude to control for a possible sampling bias with respect to baseline EPSC amplitudes. This revealed that PKCi also reduced PTP in recordings with small baseline EPSCs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). Therefore, the smaller average PTP in the presence of PKCi was not caused by a sampling bias towards large baseline EPSCs."

Munc18-1 is an essential protein for vesicle fusion and membrane trafficking (<a href=\"#bib55\">S\u00fcdhof and Rothman, 2009</a>), which has two PKC phosphorylation sites (<a href=\"#bib15\">Fujita et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">de Vries et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Wierda et al., 2007</a>). To investigate the role of Munc18-1 in PTP, it was necessary to develop a gene replacement strategy in which endogenous Munc18-1 protein is replaced with a PKC-insensitive mutant. Since constitutive genetic deletion of Munc18-1 in mice is lethal at the late embryo stage (<a href=\"#bib57\">Verhage et al., 2000</a>), we used <i>Munc18-1</i><sup><i>lox/lox</i></sup> mice (<a href=\"#bib20\">Heeroma et al., 2004</a>) and recombined the loxP sites using virus-mediated Cre expression. In addition, we wished to re-express phosphorylation-deficient Munc18-1, or wild-type Munc18-1 using the same viral construct. This required the simultaneous expression of three proteins: (i) Munc18-1, in the wild-type or mutant form, (ii) Cre-recombinase, and (iii) GFP to label successfully transduced calyces of Held. We used an adenovirus vector which allows the use of two independent expression cassettes (<a href=\"#bib62\">Young and Neher, 2009</a>); one of these carried an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) to allow the expression of a third protein (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A3</a>).

The most robust and efficient Munc18-1 removal, as judged from the postsynaptic responses in paired recordings, was found for the early injections (at P1).

Thus, early recombination of the floxed <i>Munc18-1</i> gene likely curtails protein synthesis at a time when new proteins are most needed for the growing calyx (the estimated onset time for protein expression from the adenovirus is \u223c24 hr; unpublished observations). In contrast, removal of Munc18-1 protein at later times is expected to depend more strongly on the Munc18-1 protein turnover rate in the calyx."

The PKC-insensitive Munc18-1 mutant carried alanine substitutions at the two PKC consensus sites (S306A, S313A) as well as at a third serine residue (S312A; called M18<sup>SA</sup> mutant here; <a href=\"#bib59\">Wierda et al., 2007</a>). As a control, we used the M18<sup>WT</sup> construct (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Following injection of either one of the two protein constructs into the VCN of <i>Munc18-1</i><sup><i>lox/lox</i></sup> mice at P1, EPSCs and presynaptic plasticity were measured in slices made 8\u201310 days later. The mutant and wild-type forms of Munc18-1 produced baseline EPSCs of similar amplitudes (2.87 \u00b1 0.59 nA and 2.91 \u00b1 0.61 nA respectively; p=0.96; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B1\u2013D1,E</a>). However, when we applied brief high-frequency trains of afferent fiber stimulation (100 Hz, 4 s), we observed a striking difference in presynaptic plasticity between synapses rescued with M18<sup>WT</sup>, and with the M18<sup>SA</sup> mutant. While M18<sup>WT</sup>-synapses showed normal PTP of 221 \u00b1 15% of baseline EPSC amplitude (n = 12; see <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B1</a> for an example), synapses rescued with the Munc18<sup>SA</sup> mutant showed significantly smaller PTP (147 \u00b1 13% of baseline; n = 15; p&lt;0.001; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B1\u2013D1,F</a>). In some cases, PTP was abolished completely (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C1</a>), whereas in other cases PTP was smaller and lasted for shorter times (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D1</a>). To analyze the total amount of potentiation independent of its duration, we calculated the cumulative amount of PTP (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B1\u2013D1</a> bottom; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H</a>). The cumulative PTP attained at 150 s was 5.06 \u00b1 1.17 and 0.83 \u00b1 0.85 (unit, fold change \u22121) in M18<sup>WT</sup> and M18<sup>SA</sup>-rescued synapses, respectively (n = 12 and 13, respectively; p&lt;0.01). A plot of the peak PTP amplitude vs baseline EPSC amplitude showed that PTP was reduced over the entire range of baseline EPSC amplitudes in the sample (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4I</a>)."

This identifies Munc18-1 as a presynaptic PKC target during PTP. Pharmacological experiments suggested that the PKC action during PTP is dynamic, since blocking phosphatases led to a marked prolongation of PTP (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Together, these results show that a dynamic phosphorylation/de-phosphorylation cycle of Munc18-1, initiated by PKC activity, causes PTP."

This, together with recent findings from knock-out mouse lines (<a href=\"#bib14\">Fioravante et al., 2011</a>), allows us to conclude that during PTP induction stimuli, conventional PKC isoforms are activated. A previous study evaluated the effects of BIS-like PKC inhibitors on PTP as non-specific (<a href=\"#bib33\">Lee et al., 2008</a>). However, the genetic evidence for an involvement of conventional PKCs (<a href=\"#bib14\">Fioravante et al., 2011</a>) and for the PKC phosphorylation sites of Munc18-1 in PTP (present study), as well as our pharmacological evidence with specific peptide inhibitors, firmly establishes the role of PKC and Munc18-1 phosphorylation in PTP. An earlier study found that phorbol esters translocates PKC\u03b5 at the calyx of Held (<a href=\"#bib50\">Saitoh et al., 2001</a>). Although we cannot exclude that PKC\u03b5 contributes to phorbol ester potentiation of release, it seems unlikely that novel PKCs, including PKC\u03b5, play a major role during PTP, a conclusion which agrees with the inefficiency of PLC inhibitors (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). The inefficiency of PLC blockers in PTP further contrasts this form of short-term enhancement with augmentation, since the latter is sensitive to PLC blockers, but not affected by PKC inhibitors (<a href=\"#bib49\">Rosenmund et al., 2002</a>)."

We used adenoviral vectors, which have a high cloning capacity and which allow the use of two expression cassettes (<a href=\"#bib62\">Young and Neher, 2009</a>). The additional use of an IRES site allowed us to drive the expression of a third protein; the Cre-recombinase placed downstream of the IRES site was expressed efficiently as shown in control experiments (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A2,B2</a>). Using this approach, we showed that replacing the endogenous (floxed) Munc18-1 with a Munc18-1 mutant resistant to PKC phosphorylation strongly suppressed PTP. These genetic experiments at the calyx of Held show that Munc18-1 is a necessary target for PKC during short-term enhancement of release."

This indicates that Munc18-1 is not phosphorylated in the nerve terminal under baseline conditions; a conclusion which agrees with previous work using a synaptosome preparation (<a href=\"#bib9\">de Vries et al., 2000</a>). Therefore, it seems likely that during, or shortly after high-frequency activity, Munc18-1 is phosphorylated by a conventional PKC isoform, which induces short-term enhancement of release. About a minute later, a phosphatase de-phosphorylates Munc18-1, which terminates the enhanced evoked release during PTP.

Phorbol esters, analogues of the membrane lipid product DAG, can activate several proteins including novel and conventional PKCs, Munc13-1, and other C1 domain containing proteins (<a href=\"#bib43\">Newton, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Brose and Rosenmund, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Rhee et al., 2002</a>). Therefore, it is expected that phorbol ester activation extends beyond the conventional, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent PKCs that are activated during PTP (see Discussion above). Indeed, we have shown previously that \u223chalf of the phorbol ester potentiation of spontaneous release at the calyx synapse depended on an intact DAG binding site of Munc13-1 (<a href=\"#bib35\">Lou et al., 2008</a>). Thus, phorbol ester activates at least two parallel signaling pathways at the release machinery: on the one hand, Munc13-1 via direct binding to its C1 domain (<a href=\"#bib3\">Betz et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Rhee et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Lou et al., 2008</a>), and on the other hand PKC which then phosphorylates Munc18-1 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Wierda et al., 2007</a>; see <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The specificity of activation of conventional PKCs and phosphatases during PTP likely indicates the existence of signaling subcompartments in the presynaptic nerve terminal. Indeed, a recent proteomics study showed that various protein phosphatases and conventional PKCs are enriched at short distances to P/Q-type and N-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (<a href=\"#bib41\">M\u00fcller et al., 2010</a>), indicating a PKC\u2013protein phosphatase signaling complex at the active zone."

                        "text": "How might phosphorylated Munc18-1 increase transmitter release during PTP? Munc18-1 was first described as a protein which tightly binds to Syntaxin (<a href=\"#bib45\">Pevsner et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Dulubova et al., 1999</a>). The binding of Munc18-1 to Syntaxin is thought to maintain the latter in a closed state not amenable to SNARE complex formation. An early study showed that the phosphorylated Munc18-1 has a reduced binding affinity for Syntaxin (<a href=\"#bib15\">Fujita et al., 1996</a>); thus, PKC phosphorylation could aid in the transition from a binary Munc18-1/Syntaxin complex to incorporation into SNARE complexes. However, it was shown later that Munc18-1 also binds to the SNARE complex (<a href=\"#bib10\">Dulubova et al., 2007</a>), and stimulates SNARE-mediated vesicle fusion in a reconstituted system, by binding to the partially assembled SNARE complex (<a href=\"#bib51\">Shen et al., 2007</a>). Therefore, Munc18-1 likely remains present at the partially formed SNARE complexes of docked and readily releasable vesicles; interestingly, Munc13-1 is also present in this complex (<a href=\"#bib37\">Ma et al., 2013</a>). In this model, PKC phosphorylation of Munc18-1 would then increase the release probability of readily releasable vesicles, in what appears a \u2018post-priming\u2019 regulatory step of vesicle fusion (see schematic in <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

It was shown that phorbol esters induce a shift and a decreased slope in the dose\u2013response curve between transmitter release rate and presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration (<a href=\"#bib36\">Lou et al., 2005</a>); this modulation was reduced by PKC inhibitors (<a href=\"#bib28\">Korogod et al., 2007</a>). We could not apply Ca<sup>2+</sup> uncaging to study PTP, since PTP is not observed during presynaptic whole-cell recordings (<a href=\"#bib27\">Korogod et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Lee et al., 2010</a>). To gain further insights into the mechanism of release modulation following Munc18-1 phosphorylation, we made use of a <i>phosphomimetic</i> mutation of Munc18-1, in which the S306 and S313 sites were changed to aspartate residues (called M18<sup>SD</sup> mutant). With this mutation, however, functionally rescued synapses were difficult to obtain, and synapses which were rescued showed significantly smaller EPSCs as compared to synapses rescued with M18<sup>WT</sup> and M18<sup>SA</sup> constructs (p&lt;0.05; <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). The M18<sup>SD</sup> mutant led to a block of PTP consistent with the role of PKC phosphorylation in PTP, but the paired-pulse ratio was not changed significantly (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Thus, while phosphorylation of Munc18-1 is required for PTP, mimicking its phosphorylation is not sufficient to cause a constitutive increase in release probability. We cannot rule out alternative explanations, like homeostatic plasticity (<a href=\"#bib8\">Davis, 2013</a>) which could have reverted the increased release probability, or incorrect folding of the M18<sup>SD</sup> mutant protein; the latter might also be the reason for the lower rescue efficiency. Taken together, the M18<sup>SD</sup> mutant data do not allow us to further extend our model of how Munc18-1 phosphorylation by PKC leads to an increased transmitter release."

A long-lasting residual Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal, caused by mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake and release mechanisms, is important for short-term enhancement of release including PTP (<a href=\"#bib25\">Kamiya and Zucker, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Regehr et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Tang and Zucker, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Habets and Borst, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Korogod et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Lee et al., 2007</a>).

After post-fixation in 4% PFA and dehydration in 30% sucrose in PBS, transverse brainstem sections containing the MNTB were cut frozen at 40 \u03bcm on a sliding microtome Hyrax S30 (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). The sections were processed as described (<a href=\"#bib12\">Felmy and Schneggenburger, 2004</a>). We used chicken anti-GFP (1:1000; 13,970; Abcam, Cambridge, UK) and mouse anti-myc antibodies (1:50; 9B11; Cell Signaling Technology, Boston, MA), and secondary Alexa488 goat anti-chicken (A11039) and Alexa647 donkey anti-mouse (A31571) antibodies (from Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA), which were applied overnight at 4\u00b0C, at 1:200 dilutions. The sections were mounted in DAKO fluorescence mounting medium (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) and imaged on an inverted SP2 confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems) with a 40\u00d7 oil immersion objective using 488 and 633 nm laser lines."

Spontaneous mEPSCs were detected by a semi-automated analysis routine in IgorPro, implementing template-matching detection algorithm (<a href=\"#bib7\">Clements and Bekkers, 1997</a>). Detected mEPSC events were visually inspected before acceptance. The mEPSC frequency time courses were constructed by splitting the 9.7 s long mEPSC traces in two time intervals (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1E, 4B2\u2013D2</a>) or by using the entire interval as one time bin (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>). Statistical significance was assessed by unpaired two-tailed Student\u2019s <i>t</i> test. When appropriate, a paired Student\u2019s <i>t</i> test was employed (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C,F,G, 5G</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplements 1, 2</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

It advances our understanding on the mechanisms of PTP, and identifies in Munc18 a downstream target of PKC in generating PTP. Both reviewers however also felt that knowledge about the effects of a phosphomimetic mutant would further strengthen your conclusion, and in addition being useful to distinguish whether phosphorylation of Munc18 is not only required but also sufficient to trigger the high release probability state. While we felt that additional experiments in this direction would be very desirable, they may take considerable additional time that would prevent you from timely publication. We would therefore leave it up to you whether you want to add these data that you may already have obtained, or discuss the limitations that are related to the lack of data on the phosphomimetic mutants."

We have added the results of a phosphomimetic Munc18-1 mutation, in which the two PKC phosphorylation sites (Munc18-1 S306, S313) were changed to aspartate (called M18SD mutant). While the phosphomimetic mutation again interfered with PTP, it did not produce an increased release probability, as measured by paired-pulse ratio. This data is now added as <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2013figure supplement 2</a>, and discussed in the text. While this data could indicate that Munc18-1 phosphorylation is necessary, but <i>not sufficient</i> to induce a high release probability state, we also observed that the rescue efficiency with this mutant was much lower than with the M18SA mutant, or the M18WT form. Therefore, we would like to restrain from drawing additional mechanistic conclusions based on this mutation, as discussed in more detail in the paper."

Except for the very first data set (control group of <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>), the increase in mEPSC amplitudes following PTP induction trains did not reach statistical significance in all data sets of our study (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2013figure supplement 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2013figure supplement 1</a>). Thus, while there might be a tendency for an increased mEPSC amplitude, this was not substantial with PTP induction trains of 100 Hz 4 s durations. This conclusion agrees with our original paper (<a href=\"#bib27\">Korogod et al., 2005</a>; see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>), and with the paper by Xue et al. (2010) showing that a substantial increase in mEPSC amplitude, probably caused by compound fusion (<a href=\"#bib19\">He et al., 2009</a>), occurs primarily with stronger PTP induction protocols (e.g., 100 Hz for 10 s)."

This analysis also reveals a persistent increase in the mEPSC frequency after PTP in the presence of calyculin (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>). We moved the data previously contained in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F-I</a> (effect of the PKCi inhibitory peptide) to the new <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, which now also displays the results with the phospholipase C blocker U73122 (previously shown as a supplementary v). We think that these changes have significantly improved the paper."
