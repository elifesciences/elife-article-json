However, to what extent individual neurons and neuronal populations maintain internal firing properties remains largely unknown. In this study, we show that distributions of spontaneous population firing rates and synchrony are subject to accurate homeostatic control following increase of synaptic inhibition in cultured hippocampal networks. Reduction in firing rate triggered synaptic and intrinsic adaptive responses operating as global homeostatic mechanisms to maintain firing macro-stability, without achieving local homeostasis at the single-neuron level. Adaptive mechanisms, while stabilizing population firing properties, reduced short-term facilitation essential for synaptic discrimination of input patterns. Thus, invariant ongoing population dynamics emerge from intrinsically unstable activity patterns of individual neurons and synapses. The observed differences in the precision of homeostatic control at different spatial scales challenge cell-autonomous theory of network homeostasis and suggest the existence of network-wide regulation rules."

However, to what extent individual neurons and neuronal populations maintain internal firing properties remains largely unknown. In this study, we show that distributions of spontaneous population firing rates and synchrony are subject to accurate homeostatic control following increase of synaptic inhibition in cultured hippocampal networks. Reduction in firing rate triggered synaptic and intrinsic adaptive responses operating as global homeostatic mechanisms to maintain firing macro-stability, without achieving local homeostasis at the single-neuron level. Adaptive mechanisms, while stabilizing population firing properties, reduced short-term facilitation essential for synaptic discrimination of input patterns. Thus, invariant ongoing population dynamics emerge from intrinsically unstable activity patterns of individual neurons and synapses. The observed differences in the precision of homeostatic control at different spatial scales challenge cell-autonomous theory of network homeostasis and suggest the existence of network-wide regulation rules."

By contrast, the individual neurons within the networks behaved differently: on day 2 almost 90% of neurons had a firing rate that was different from their original firing rate."

Surprisingly, however, the ability of the network to undergo short-lived changes in average strength of the connections between neurons\u2014which is thought to support short-term memory\u2014was not subject to homeostasis. This suggests that the loss of short-term memory that occurs in many brain diseases may be an unfortunate consequence of the efforts of neuronal networks to keep their average responses stable."

The balance between stability and plasticity has rarely been addressed in the past due to the technical challenge of monitoring the activity of the same neurons over extended timescales (<a href=\"#bib23\">L\u00fctcke et al., 2013</a>). Recently, great efforts have been made to establish a system for the monitoring of neuronal activity at long timescales in the hippocampus of freely moving mice (<a href=\"#bib47\">Ziv et al., 2013</a>). That study, performed by monitoring Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics in thousands of CA1 cells over weeks through a miniature head-mounted microscope, revealed a remarkable degree of instability in the coding of space: only 25% of cells with place fields at one recording session exhibited the same properties 5 days later. Importantly, the diverse activity patterns at the single-neuron level gave rise to largely invariant spatial representations at the population level. Such results raise the question of whether inter-neuronal dynamics of spiking patterns stems from intrinsic variability of the hippocampal network and its constituent neurons, or whether they reflect extrinsic changes in hippocampal modulation by higher-order brain structures, adaptations to environmental changes, or subtle changes in animal behavior states."

Extensive research lead to compelling evidence on a wide repertoire of possible homeostatic mechanisms, including adaptations of synaptic strength, changes in excitation\u2013inhibition balance, and modulation of intrinsic excitability (<a href=\"#bib39\">Turrigiano, 2011</a>). Despite progress in understanding the homeostatic mechanisms that underlie the stability of network firing properties, several key questions remain open. First, what are the basic properties of neural networks that are subjected to homeostatic control? Second, are homeostatic control systems equally precise at the level of individual neurons and neuronal populations? Third, what is the trigger of synaptic homeostatic mechanisms? And finally, how do compensatory changes in synaptic strength affect the network's functions?"

While long-term monitoring of spiking activity cannot be reliably performed from the same neurons in vivo due to technical limitations, greater stability can be achieved in vitro. Therefore, we combined long-term extracellular spike recordings at the population and single-neuron levels using micro-electrode arrays (MEAs) and calcium imaging, together with intracellular patch-clamp measurements of synaptic responses and imaging of synaptic activity. We utilized cultured neuronal networks that represent an excellent experimental tool to study internal variability vs stability in a highly controlled environment. Here, we describe the basic relationships between ongoing spiking properties of individual neurons, population dynamics, and neuronal adaptive mechanisms."

Specifically, we examined how use-dependent synaptic inhibition via G-protein-coupled receptors, a widespread mechanism of neuromodulation in the central nervous system (CNS), affects firing properties of the network over long timescales. As a perturbation, we chose a suppression of synaptic activity via widely expressed GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors (GABA<sub>B</sub>Rs) using a selective GABA<sub>B</sub>R agonist, baclofen. GABA<sub>B</sub>Rs mediate presynaptic inhibition via inhibition of presynaptic calcium transients (<a href=\"#bib45\">Wu and Saggau, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Laviv et al., 2010</a>). Therefore, we first conducted experiments to determine the dose\u2013response of baclofen at the level of presynaptic terminals utilizing FM1-43 dye in primary hippocampal cultures (<a href=\"#bib2\">Abramov et al., 2009</a>). As GABA<sub>B</sub>R-mediated inhibition is frequency-dependent (<a href=\"#bib43\">Varela et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Kreitzer and Regehr, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Ohliger-Frerking et al., 2003</a>), we quantified the effects of baclofen for two types of input: low-frequency single spikes (30 stimuli at 1 Hz) and high-frequency spike bursts (30 stimuli delivered as 6 bursts; each burst contains 5 stimuli at 100 Hz), while maintaining the mean spiking rate constant at 1 Hz (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). As expected, baclofen inhibits synaptic vesicle release, displaying preferential effects during low-frequency stimulation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Quantitatively, IC<sub>50</sub> for single spikes was \u223c23-fold lower than for bursts (0.33 and 7.6 \u03bcM, respectively, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). As a result, short-term facilitation was enhanced in a wide range of baclofen concentrations (0.01\u201310 \u03bcM, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>), indicating a conversion of synapses to a high-pass filter mode. Similar results were obtained using voltage-clamp experiments in acute hippocampal slices (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>)."

We hypothesized that if the network has an intrinsically regulated firing rate \u2018set point\u2019, as suggested by theories of homeostatic plasticity, we would see an increase in firing rates back to baseline values after administration of baclofen. Indeed, firing rates gradually returned to baseline values, reaching 57 \u00b1 8% and 103 \u00b1 14% of baseline after 1 and 2 days, respectively (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,D</a>). Notably, the average firing rates of networks under control conditions showed changes of similar magnitude during two recording days (without baclofen application, 113 \u00b1 9% of baseline after 2 days; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B\u2013D</a>). Moreover, the characteristic log-normal distributions of single-unit firing patterns were essentially identical before and 2 days after baclofen application (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>, p = 0.66; Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test). Importantly, baclofen remains potent after over 2 days of exposure to recording conditions (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Additionally, washout of baclofen following 2 days caused a significant increase in firing rate, indicating sustained activity of both baclofen and the GABA<sub>B</sub>R-induced G-protein-mediated signaling (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B\u2013D</a>).

First, we analyzed firing rates of individual units during 2 days of recording under control condition. While a high correlation was observed between firing rates at the baseline and after 2 days (Spearman r = 0.8, p &lt; 0.0001, n = 490), a large fraction of units did not return to their baseline values (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>, left). Only 23 \u00b1 3% of units remained significantly unchanged during 2 days of control recordings, while 77 \u00b1 3% changed their firing rates significantly (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>). This phenomenon became even more pronounced after the application of baclofen, with only 11 \u00b1 2% of units returning to the baseline, while 89 \u00b1 2% were significantly changed (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a> right and 2G). The change in firing rate after 2 days of recordings was negatively correlated with the initial firing rate of the same unit under both control (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>; Spearman r = \u22120.29, p &lt; 0.0001, n = 490) and baclofen (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1F</a>; Spearman r = \u22120.47, p &lt; 0.0001, n = 305) conditions, due to a larger relative variability of low firing units. Notably, when analyzing multiunit recordings per electrode, firing rates after 2 days of recording displayed statistically significant change from the baseline in \u223c80% of the cases (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A,B</a>). To ensure that per unit variability is not due to a possible movement of neurons in and out from recording electrodes, we measured the movement of individual neurons over the course of 2 days and found that the mean movement of neurons (1.6 \u00b1 0.1 \u03bcM) was negligible in comparison to the size of the electrode (30 \u00b5M) and neuron's cell body (11.4 \u00b1 0.3 \u00b5M). These results confirm that the observed variability at the level of single units does not result from imperfect spike sorting or neuronal mobility."

We utilized the genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator GCaMP6f that displays single-action-potential sensitivity and broad dynamic range (<a href=\"#bib5\">Chen et al., 2013</a>). An AAV-based gene delivery system under the synapsin promoter was used to express GCaMP6f in hippocampal neurons. GCaMP6f-expressing neurons displayed spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics typically consisting of transients of varying amplitudes corresponding to single spikes and spike bursts (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). We first established the relationship between the calcium transients and spiking activity. Single spikes induced robust calcium transients (24.6 \u00b1 1.4% \u0394<i>F</i>/<i>F</i>; <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Although the exact number of spikes could not be accurately predicted from the size of the calcium transients, high-frequency bursts consisting of 2\u201310 spikes at 100 Hz induced significantly higher \u0394<i>F</i>/<i>F</i> peak amplitudes as compared with single spikes and the average \u0394<i>F/F</i> linearly correlated with the number of spikes (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B,C</a>).

Each imaging session had a duration of 20 min, fairly representing firing stability of several hours (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). Analysis of Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics in 192 neurons shows that 10 \u03bcM baclofen blocked Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients acutely, while 48 hr after baclofen incubation the mean Ca<sup>2+</sup>-transient amplitude returned to the baseline level (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,C</a>). Notably, the distributions of single-neuron Ca<sup>2+</sup>-transient sizes were skewed towards low-activity levels (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>) as seen for electrophysiological measurements of spiking activity, indicating that the population of visually selected neurons does not represent a frequency-dependent bias. In addition, the distributions were indistinguishable before and 2 days after baclofen application (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). Despite stability of Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics at the population level, 54 \u00b1 6% of neurons did not return to their baseline values 2 days after baclofen application (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E,F</a>). The change in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-transient amplitudes after 2 days of baclofen incubation was negatively correlated with the initial amplitudes at the same neuron (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1F</a>). Thus, calcium imaging in identified neurons confirms the electrophysiological data, strengthening our conclusion regarding the stabilization of population dynamics despite imprecise homeostatic compensations at the level of single neurons."

While acute baclofen application did not have a significant effect on mEPSCs (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) as has been reported previously (<a href=\"#bib21\">Lei and McBain, 2003</a>), chronic baclofen incubation triggered gradual changes in mEPSC frequency and amplitude. We did not observe a significant increase in mEPSC amplitude 4 hr after baclofen application (24.7 \u00b1 1.3 and 27.7 \u00b1 3.3 pA in control and 4 hr after baclofen, respectively, p = 0.46). However, a 1.25-fold increase to 30.8 \u00b1 2.2 pA (p &lt; 0.05) was detected 2 days following baclofen application (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B,C</a>). This was coupled with twofold increase in the frequency of mEPSCs from 2.1 \u00b1 0.7 to 4.3 \u00b1 1.5 Hz (p &lt; 0.05) following 4 hr baclofen application and a large 4.8-fold increase to 10 \u00b1 3.2 Hz (p &lt; 0.01) following 2 days (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D,E</a>). These data indicate that both pre- and postsynaptic modifications of quantal excitatory synaptic transmission occur following chronic, use-dependent inhibition of the evoked synaptic activity."

To examine the effect of chronic GABA<sub>B</sub>R activation on intrinsic electrophysiological properties of hippocampal neurons, we incubated cultures with 10 \u00b5M baclofen for 4 hr and 2 days. We then elicited action potentials (APs) in response to increasing somatic current injections ranging from \u221240 to +180 pA (F\u2013I curves) in the presence of postsynaptic receptor blockers. While there was no difference in F\u2013I curves between control and 4 hr baclofen incubation, 2 days of baclofen incubation caused a significant leftward shift of the curve (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,B</a>). Additionally, resting membrane potential (RMP, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>) was \u221264.8 \u00b1 1.7 mV in untreated neurons, became more depolarized already after 4 hr (\u221258.2 \u00b1 2.2, p &lt; 0.05) and further depolarized after 2 days (\u221255.4 \u00b1 1.5 mV, p &lt; 0.001). Finally, input resistance (R<sub>in</sub>), determined by the voltage response to increasing somatic current injections ranging from \u221280 to \u221220 pA, showed a tendency towards larger values after 4 hr and was significantly increased following 2 days baclofen incubation (from 233 \u00b1 14 to 373 \u00b1 59 M\u2126, p &lt; 0.01; <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D,E</a>).

Despite a transient GABA<sub>B</sub>R-mediated blockade of population firing rate with a simultaneous increase in firing synchrony, population activity was precisely restored to a \u2018set point\u2019 level after a period of 2 days. Interestingly, restoration of firing synchrony displays a faster kinetics than rebound of mean rates. In contrast to the observed firing macro-stability, single-unit behavior appears to be extremely dynamic. Only 23% of units displayed stable firing rates without perturbation, and this fraction was reduced to 11% following the perturbation. A complementary method, based on long-term recordings of somatic Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics, reflecting firing rates, in identified neurons showed that 46% of neurons returned to their baseline firing rates (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). Thus, two independent methodologies suggest that the majority of neurons display unstable firing rates even at extended timescales, confirming scale-invariant rate dynamics observed in a previous study (<a href=\"#bib10\">Gal et al., 2010</a>). Thus, stability, as well as the compensatory feedback response, is greater at the population compared to the single-unit level. Moreover, quantal excitatory synaptic strength and intrinsic excitability were significantly affected by the perturbation and, thus, differ between the baseline and rebound periods. These results highlight the idea that similar network properties may arise from multiple configurations of individual components (<a href=\"#bib32\">Prinz et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Marder and Goaillard, 2006</a>). Most importantly, the observed differences in the precision of homeostatic regulation at different spatial scales suggest that population firing homeostasis is more than a sum of single-neuron adaptive responses, implying the existence of network-wide regulation rules (<a href=\"#bib24\">Maffei and Fontanini, 2009</a>)."

A variety of synaptic compensation mechanisms have been found following pharmacological or genetic perturbations in hippocampal and cortical neuronal cultures (<a href=\"#bib41\">Turrigiano et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Burrone et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Thiagarajan et al., 2002</a>, <a href=\"#bib34\">2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Branco et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Jakawich et al., 2010</a>), following sensory deprivation (<a href=\"#bib25\">Maffei et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Hengen et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Keck et al., 2013</a>) or in a more physiological context of sleep (<a href=\"#bib44\">Vyazovskiy et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Lant\u00e9 et al., 2011</a>). Interestingly, synaptic homeostasis hypothesis proposed by Tononi and colleagues (<a href=\"#bib37\">Tononi and Cirelli, 2003</a>, <a href=\"#bib38\">2014</a>) states that population firing synchrony, a hallmark of slow-wave sleep, contributes directly to homeostatic synaptic scaling. To examine if changes in population synchrony per se can trigger adaptive responses, we compared two perturbations producing similar (inhibitory) effects on the mean firing rate, while differentially affecting firing synchrony. For this purpose, we used baclofen that increases firing synchrony (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>) and CNQX that induces firing desynchronization (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9H,I</a>). Both perturbations trigger the same types of synaptic adaptation at a comparable timescale: increase in the amplitude and the frequency of mEPSCs and in release probability (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figures 6 and 9F,G</a> and (<a href=\"#bib35\">Thiagarajan et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Jakawich et al., 2010</a>)). Based on these results, we may conclude that (1) firing rates and patterns are independently regulated; (2) homeostatic systems generally sense a drop in spiking rates to induce an adaptive increase in excitatory synaptic transmission. Thus, our results in cultured neural networks don't support a causal relationship between firing synchrony and homeostatic synaptic response, suggesting that other factors, occurring during slow-wave sleep, may play a role in down-scaling of synapses in behaving animals."

On the one hand, complete silencing of excitatory drive might exceed the capacity of the homeostatic system to compensate. On the other hand, the drop in the firing rate following baclofen application was even more pronounced; nevertheless, firing rate homeostasis was achieved. Similarly, blockade of GABA uptake via GAT-1 transporter resulted in a transient blockade of firing rates that were precisely compensated 2 days following the perturbation (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). We can exclude the necessity of population bursts for induction of a proper profile of adaptive response since other treatments, such as ACh exposure, induce a reduction in synchrony that can be successfully compensated (<a href=\"#bib15\">Kaufman et al., 2012</a>). Thus, our results indicate that adaptations at the level of intrinsic neuronal excitability and inhibitory drive are not sufficient to compensate the blockade of AMPAR-mediated excitatory drive. It is conceivable that AMPAR blockade might perturb the relationship between the firing rate and the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration, causing a failure in the regulatory system (<a href=\"#bib29\">O'Leary et al., 2014</a>)."

The observed micro-instability of individual neurons was truly intrinsic, taking place in a highly-controlled environment, irrespective of changes in experience, behavioral states, and interactions with higher-order supervising circuits. While firing macro-stability is robustly and accurately maintained by homeostatic control systems in the face of perturbations and uncertainties, the ability of synapses to discriminate input patterns was sacrificed. Thus, impairments of short-term synaptic plasticity and working memory functions, characterizing initial phases of numerous brain disorders, may be the tradeoff resulting from the system's efforts to maintain phenotypic stability of spontaneous population firing patterns. It remains to be seen whether hippocampal short-term synaptic plasticity can be maintained without sacrificing critical parameters of population dynamics."

In order to ensure the veracity of the detected spikes, TTX was added at the end of some experiments, resulting in an immediate loss of all spiking activity. Only the first 20 min of each hour were used for all analyses in order to reduce computation time. We showed that 20 min can reliably represent the MFR of a full-hour by comparing the MFR of 792 20 min segments to the MFR of the full hours represented by those segments.

The fluorescence time course of each cell was measured by averaging all pixels within the ROI. Only cells that were in the same estimated focal plane and visually separated from neighboring cells and surrounding neuropil were used. For long-term GCaMP6f imaging, baseline fluorescence images of multiple sessions were inspected manually, and only the cells that could be clearly identified in all imaged sessions in the focal plane were included in the analysis. \u0394<i>F/F</i> was quantified for each cell as change in fluorescence divided by baseline fluorescence measured 1 s before the spontaneous signal or stimulation. The sum of amplitudes of all the events was divided by the recording time to estimate the rate of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients."

Extracellular Tyrode solution contained (in mM): NaCl, 145; KCl, 3; glucose, 15; HEPES, 10; MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.2; CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.2; pH adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH. Whole-cell patches were recorded using the following intracellular solution (in mM): Cs-MeSO<sub>3,</sub> 120; HEPES, 10; NaCl, 10; CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.5; Mg<sup>2+</sup>\u2013ATP, 2; Na<sub>3</sub>GTP, 0.3; EGTA, 10 for mEPSC and E/I experiments; pH adjusted to 7.25 with NaOH. Serial resistance was not compensated. For mEPSCs recordings, Tetrodotoxin (TTX; 1 \u03bcM), amino-phosphonopentanoate (AP-5; 50 \u03bcM), and gabazine (30 \u03bcM) were added to the Tyrode solution. For measurement of excitation/inhibition (E/I) balance, sEPSCs and sIPSCs were isolated in the same cell based on reversal potentials of GABA<sub>A</sub>R-mediated and AMPAR-mediated currents, respectively. When corrected for the liquid junction potential, the reversal potential for E (<i>V</i><sub>E</sub>) was close to 10 mV and <i>V</i><sub>I</sub> was close to \u221265 mV, close to the predicted value for the intracellular and extracellular solutions used in the present study. For intrinsic excitability measurements, the following intracellular solution was used (in mM): K-gluconate 120; KCl 10; HEPESs 10; Na-phosphocreatine 10; ATP-Na<sub>2</sub> 4; GTP-Na 0.3; MgCl<sub>2</sub> 0.5. Recordings were done in the presence of synaptic blockers (in \u00b5M: 25 DNQX, 50 APV, and 10 bicuculline). Frequency vs current intensity curves were plotted by measuring the average rate of action potentials in current-clamp during 500-ms long depolarizing steps of increasing intensity; a small DC current was injected to maintain membrane potential at \u221265 mV in between depolarizations. Input resistance (R<sub>in</sub>) was measured by calculating the slope of the voltage change in response to increasing current injections from \u221280 pA to \u221220 pA in 20 pA increments. Access resistance was between 5\u201315 M\u03a9. Neurons were excluded from the analysis if RMP was &gt;\u221255 mV, serial resistance was &gt;15 M\u03a9, and R<sub>in</sub> was &lt;80 M\u03a9 or if any of these parameters changed by &gt;20% during the recording. Signals were recorded using a MultiClamp 700B amplifier, digitized by DigiData1440A (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, California, USA) at 10 kHz, and filtered at 2 kHz. Electrophysiological data were analyzed using MiniAnalysis (Synaptosoft, Decatur, Georgia, USA) for mEPSCs and in pClamp10 (Molecular Devices) for sEPSCs and sIPSCs. The integrated conductances G<sub>E</sub> and G<sub>I</sub> were calculated according to the following equations <math id=\"inf5\"><mrow><mo>\u2009</mo><msub><mi>G</mi><mi>E</mi></msub><mo>=</mo><munderover><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\"><mo>\u222b</mo></mstyle><mn>0</mn><mi>t</mi></munderover><mfrac><mrow><mi>s</mi><mi>E</mi><mi>P</mi><mi>S</mi><mi>C</mi></mrow><mrow><mi>t</mi><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><msub><mi>V</mi><mi>M</mi></msub><mo>\u2212</mo><msub><mi>V</mi><mrow><mi>E</mi><mi>r</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>v</mi></mrow></msub></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow></mfrac></mrow></math> and <math id=\"inf6\"><mrow><msub><mi>G</mi><mi>I</mi></msub><mo>=</mo><munderover><mstyle displaystyle=\"true\"><mo>\u222b</mo></mstyle><mn>0</mn><mi>t</mi></munderover><mfrac><mrow><mi>s</mi><mi>I</mi><mi>P</mi><mi>S</mi><mi>C</mi></mrow><mrow><mi>t</mi><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><msub><mi>V</mi><mi>M</mi></msub><mo>\u2212</mo><msub><mi>V</mi><mrow><mi>I</mi><mi>r</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>v</mi></mrow></msub></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow></mfrac></mrow></math>."

Action potentials were elicited by passing 50 mA constant current for 1 ms (\u223c50% above the threshold for eliciting action potential) through two platinum wires, separated by \u223c7 mm, and close to the surface of the coverslip. The extracellular Tyrode solution contained non-selective antagonist of ionotropic glutamate receptors (kynurenic acid, 0.5 mM) to block recurrent neuronal activity. Synaptic vesicles were loaded with 10 \u03bcM FM1-43. FM loading and unloading were done using protocols described previously (<a href=\"#bib2\">Abramov et al., 2009</a>). The fluorescence of individual synapses was determined from the difference between images obtained after staining and after destaining (\u0394<i>F</i>). To estimate vesicle recycling/release during low frequency stimulation, we quantified: (i) \u0394<i>F</i> signal for staining by 30 action potentials at a rate of 1 Hz stimulation; (ii) FM destaining rate during 1 Hz stimulation following staining of boutons by maximal stimulation. For FM-(+) puncta detection, \u0394<i>F</i> images have been analyzed (only the puncta exhibiting \u226590% destaining were subjected to analysis). Detection of signals has been done as described (<a href=\"#bib2\">Abramov et al., 2009</a>)."

These issues are now addressed under the \u201cSpike sorting\u201d header of the Materials and methods section and in <a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2013figure supplement 4</a>. All analyses of MEA recordings were performed using the first 20 minutes of each hour of recording. This was done because of the large volume of data collected during each experiment. In order to ensure that 20 minutes is a reliable representation of a full hour we compared the mean firing rate (MFR) of 792 20-minute segments with the full hour that they represent. We found that on average, the 20-minute average segment was only 5.1 \u00b1 0.4% different from the full-hour average. Out of the 792 segments analyzed, 90% were within 10% and none was more than 20% different from the corresponding full hour average (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2013figure supplement 4A</a>)."

This was done by dividing the two time segments to be compared into bins of equal duration (for example, all data in the paper uses 20 minute time segments that were divided into 1 minute bins for bootstrapping analysis). MFR for each bin was then calculated. The bins were then randomized into two equal groups and the difference between the means of the randomized groups was calculated. The randomization was repeated 10,000 times to produce a null-distribution. The real MFR difference was significant only if it fell outside of the 95% confidence interval of the null distribution. To further ensure the validity of our data, we performed bootstrapping analyses of MFR while changing the different variables of the analysis. First, we tested whether the length of the time segment analyzed influenced the results. If 20 minute time segments are not sufficiently long to accurately represent the MFR over one-hour segments, increasing the duration of the time segments should change the results of the bootstrapping analysis. We saw no changes when performing bootstrapping analysis using time segments of 20 minutes, 1 hour or 2 hours (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2013figure supplement 4C</a>) and, therefore, conclude that our results are not due to sampling errors. Likewise, we ran the bootstrapping analysis while changing the bin size and the number of iterations used to create the null-distribution. The results were extremely stable to changes in these parameters (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2013figure supplement 4D, E</a>). We therefore conclude that our bootstrapping analysis is robust and represents true differences between MFRs of different time-points."

We then calculated for each unit the coefficient of variation (CV) of the MFR for each segment size. Since CV assesses the variability of a given sample, we expected to reach a plateau for segment sizes long enough to reflect the intrinsic variability of the units. We found that the CV, when using time segments shorter than 10 minutes, indicated significantly higher variability compared to one-hour long segments. When increasing segment duration above 10 minutes, the CV stabilized (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2013figure supplement 4B</a>). From this, we conclude that 20 minutes is sufficient time to accurately represent the basal, intrinsic, firing rate variability while allowing us to make comparisons to other time-points."

In order to establish the accuracy of our measurements we repeated the measurement of 11 cells 10 times to establish the standard deviation of our measurement technique. The mean SD of the 11 cells was 0.29 \u00b1 0.02 \u00b5m (<a href=\"#fig10\">Author response image 1</a>), showing that the measurements have a submicron level of accuracy.

We chose genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator GCaMP6f that displays single-action-potential sensitivity and broad dynamic range (<a href=\"#bib5\">Chen et al., 2013</a>). We showed that the \u0394<i>F</i>/<i>F</i> amplitude of calcium transients is proportional to the number of spikes that triggered it (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2013figure supplement 1B</a>). To examine the stability of single neurons and neuronal populations at extended timescales, we performed time-lapse imaging of somatic Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics during a baseline recording period, 10 minutes and 2 days following baclofen application. Our results show that while Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics at the population level was stable, 54% of neurons did not return to their baseline values following 2 days baclofen incubation. Thus, calcium imaging in visually identified neurons confirms electrophysiological data, strengthening our conclusion on stabilization of population dynamics despite imprecise homeostatic compensations of single neurons."

One way to address this is to monitor activity during the washout period. The prediction is that activity should rebound. This would then offer the opportunity to observe bi-directional changes in activity of single neurons to further demonstrate the concordance, or lack thereof, of single neuron and network activity. It would also be useful to do this for the CNQX experiment</i>."
