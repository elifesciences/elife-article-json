However, little is known about the associated changes in the physics of cell\u2013cell interaction and its impact on the architecture of biofilms. In this study, we used the type IV pilus of <i>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</i> to test whether variation of surface structures induces cell-sorting. We show that the rupture forces between pili are fine-tuned by post-translational modification. Bacterial sorting was dependent on pilus post-translational modification and pilus density. Active force generation was necessary for defined morphologies of mixed microcolonies. The observed morphotypes were in remarkable agreement with the differential strength of adhesion hypothesis proposing that a tug-of-war among surface structures of different cells governs cell sorting. We conclude that in early biofilms the density and rupture force of bacterial surface structures can trigger cell sorting based on similar physical principles as in developing embryos."

However, little is known about the associated changes in the physics of cell\u2013cell interaction and its impact on the architecture of biofilms. In this study, we used the type IV pilus of <i>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</i> to test whether variation of surface structures induces cell-sorting. We show that the rupture forces between pili are fine-tuned by post-translational modification. Bacterial sorting was dependent on pilus post-translational modification and pilus density. Active force generation was necessary for defined morphologies of mixed microcolonies. The observed morphotypes were in remarkable agreement with the differential strength of adhesion hypothesis proposing that a tug-of-war among surface structures of different cells governs cell sorting. We conclude that in early biofilms the density and rupture force of bacterial surface structures can trigger cell sorting based on similar physical principles as in developing embryos."

A single bacterium can replicate itself and develop into a biofilm, and over time the bacterial cells in specific regions of the biofilm will start to interact with their neighbors in different ways. These interactions occur via structures on the surface of the bacterial cells, and the differences in these interactions resemble those that occur as cells specialize during the development of animal embryos. Previous research into embryonic development has shown how differences in the physical interactions between embryonic cells are essential for sorting the cells into their correct locations and shaping the embryo. However, little is known about which processes govern the development of biofilms."

The experiments involved measuring the force required to break the cell\u2013cell connections (called the \u2018rupture force\u2019) in biofilms of a bacterium called <i>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</i>. Oldewurtel et al. found that, in agreement with previous predictions, physical interactions were important for sorting bacterial cells into clusters based on the structures on their surfaces. Bacterial cells actively pull on the surface structures of their neighbors, which allows the cells to sort themselves in a tug-of-war fashion. This means that a cell will move in the direction where it can pull the strongest (i.e., in the direction where the rupture force is highest)."

The development of bacterial biofilms resembles eukaryotic development in various aspects including genetic programs that are controlled by master regulators (<a href=\"#bib36\">Monds and O'Toole, 2009</a>). However, it is unclear to which extent physical forces are involved in determining the architecture of biofilms."

This hypothesis states that a population of cells will sort into spatially separated subpopulations, if the strength of cell\u2013cell adhesion differs between cell types. The biophysical explanation for this sorting is the tendency of cell clusters to minimize their surface, similar to the minimization of surface tension in liquids. Depending on the strength of cohesion between cells of the same kind and the strength of adhesion between different kinds of cells, the model predicts perfect mixing, encasement, partial segregation, and full segregation of cells (<a href=\"#bib39\">Steinberg, 1963</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Graner and Glazier, 1992</a>). Some of these morphotypes have been observed experimentally (<a href=\"#bib38\">Steinberg and Takeichi, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Foty and Steinberg, 2004</a>). Recent experiments indicate that equilibrium descriptions are not sufficient for describing the process of cell sorting during development; they provide evidence that active force generation by cells is involved (<a href=\"#bib27\">Landsberg et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Gonzalez-Rodriguez et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Kashef and Franz, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Mao and Baum, 2015</a>). In particular, the differential interfacial tension hypothesis introduces cortical contractility in addition to adhesion (<a href=\"#bib5\">Brodland and Chen, 2000</a>). Interestingly, Harris proposed another hypothesis, the differential strength of adhesion hypothesis (DSAH) (<a href=\"#bib19\">Harris, 1976</a>). He envisions a tug-of-war of cells actively moving along each other by retractions of cellular extensions pulling the cell body into the direction of the strongest and least breakable bonds. Cells with lower bond strength would be squeezed outward to the peripheral layer."

                        "text": "Sorting of cells also occurs during bacterial biofilm development. Cell\u2013cell interactions and biofilm architecture are often governed by cell appendages with polymeric organization. One of the most ubiquitous appendages is the type IV pilus (T4P) (<a href=\"#bib4\">Berry and Pelicic, 2015</a>). It mediates surface attachment, surface motility, and its retraction can generate high mechanical force (<a href=\"#bib29\">Maier and Wong, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Maier, 2013</a>). The T4P is a helical polymer consisting mainly of the major subunit PilE (<a href=\"#bib10\">Craig et al., 2004</a>). The major subunit can be post-translationally modified by O-linked glycosylation or by phosphoform-modifications. Cell sorting based on T4P has been observed in different experimental setups. <i>Vibrio cholerae</i> can express a T4P-like system and generate toxin co-regulated pili. Cells lacking the major pilin of the toxin co-regulated pilus did not integrate into wt microcolonies (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kirn et al., 2000</a>). Mutations in the major pilin subunits induced different pilus morphology and affected the size of pilus bundles. However, cell sorting based on these mutations was not reported (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kirn et al., 2000</a>). Differential fluorescence labeling of <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> showed that cells with T4P-dependent motility form a cap on top of non-motile stalks formed by cells that lacked the gene for the major pilin subunit (<a href=\"#bib25\">Klausen et al., 2003</a>). Swarming of <i>P. aeruginosa</i> is generated by a single flagellum, but moderated by polar T4P (<a href=\"#bib3\">Anyan et al., 2014</a>). When T4P production was suppressed, swarming motility increased considerably, most likely due to reduced cellular clustering mediated by pili. When piliated and non-piliated cells were co-cultured, non-piliated cells dominated the swarm edge. <i>Neisseria meningitidis</i> upregulates expression of a phosphotransferase that is required for phospho-form modification of the major pilin upon attachment to endothelial host cells (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chamot-Rooke et al., 2011</a>). Simulations of pilus bundling suggest post-translational modifications affecting the physical interactions between T4P (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chamot-Rooke et al., 2011</a>). All of these studies imply that T4P can generate a rich diversity of sorting phenomena. However, in contrast to embryonic development, the biophysical basis underlying cell sorting in bacterial biofilms remains elusive."

Moreover, the breakage-force between pili of different cells could be fine-tuned by replacing a gene responsible for pilin post-translational modification. We found that on agar plates, where the dynamics are mostly determined by steric interactions caused by cell division, cells with the lowest pilus density and cells with the lowest pilus-breakage force sorted towards the colony boundary. Sorting was prominent at the front of expanding colonies but within the bulk of the colony sorting was incomplete. In liquid environment where cells actively move by pilus retractions, sorting correlating with pilus density and pilus-breakage force was nearly complete and the resulting morphotypes followed the DSAH. Active pilus retraction was essential for cell sorting, suggesting that the cells sort by a tug-of-war between cells."

Gonococci are peritrichously piliated, that is, they generate pili at random locations (<a href=\"#bib22\">Holz et al., 2010</a>). Because T4P are necessary for microcolony formation, variation in the breakage force between pili directly affects cell\u2013cell interactions. There is preliminary evidence that gonococcal microcolonies show surface tension-like behavior. Microcolonies formed by gonococci with retractile pili are spherical (<a href=\"#bib21\">Higashi et al., 2009</a>). Upon fusion, two microcolonies rapidly form a sphere with larger radius as expected for liquid drops (<a href=\"#bib12\">Dewenter et al., 2015</a>). Importantly, the retraction of T4P generates mechanical force (<a href=\"#bib30\">Maier et al., 2002</a>).

We used laser tweezers for measuring the rupture forces, employing a previously established assay (<a href=\"#bib12\">Dewenter et al., 2015</a>). The surface was coated with a crude pilus preparation extracted from the strain of interest. Subsequently, single bacteria (monococci) were caught in a laser trap and held close to the T4P-coated surface (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). The forces applied by the optical trap kept the cell body at the center of the trap. Type IV pili can generate very large force by retraction when they bind to surfaces (<a href=\"#bib30\">Maier et al., 2002</a>). Binding of T4P to the pilus-coated surface and subsequent retraction led to a deflection of the cell body. Upon breakage of the bond between the retracting pilus and the pili on the surface, the cell body is pulled back into the center of the laser trap. Thus, the maximum force between pili attached to the bacterium and the pili attached to the surface can be measured. Henceforth, we will call this force rupture force. The distribution of rupture forces of wt bacteria pulling on wt pili was in agreement with a Gaussian distribution with a maximum at <i>F</i><sub><i>wt/wt</i></sub> = (39 \u00b1 1) pN (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). The distribution of rupture forces generated by <i>G\u2212 green</i> was shifted to higher values of <i>F</i><sub><i>G\u2212/G\u2212</i></sub> = (46 \u00b1 1) pN.

Moreover, we monitored the frequency at which bacteria pulled onto the pilus-coated surface and found no significant difference between the strains (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>), confirming that pilus\u2013pilus rupture force and not the frequency of pilus retractions was responsible for the altered cell\u2013cell interaction in response to the loss of pilin glycosylation.

For this analysis, only variants that are not touching the front are analyzed (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013C</a>). Colony 2 (green) shows an example of a sector touching the front at t = 7.5 hr. Later time points of such sectors were automatically removed from the analysis. As expected, the variance increased as a function of time (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Different growth rates might obscure the effect of differential physical interactions on cell. Hence, the generation time of gonococci expressing different amounts of the major pilin <i>pilE</i>, which results in varying densities of pili per cell (<a href=\"#bib28\">Long et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Holz et al., 2010</a>) (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>, \u2018Materials and methods\u2019), was measured. The level of pilin expression strongly affected the growth rate. The <i>P+ green</i> strain had a generation time of <i>t</i><sub><i>g</i></sub> = 49 \u00b1 3 min. The non-piliated <i>P\u2212 green</i> strain had a significantly lower generation time (<i>t</i><sub><i>g</i></sub> = 41 \u00b1 1 min), whereas the growth rate of the hyperpiliated <i>P++ red</i> strain showed an increased generation time (<i>t</i><sub><i>g</i></sub> = 56 \u00b1 4 min). In our mobility analysis, we compensated for different generation times, by comparing the variance of <i>P\u2212 green</i> with <i>P+ green</i> as a function of the number of offspring (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,D</a>). We found that the variance of the <i>P\u2212 green</i> cells increases more strongly as a function of the number of offspring than the variance of <i>P+ green</i> cells, indicating an increased mobility of <i>P\u2212 green</i> within a colony of wt bacteria."

In liquid environment, T4P retractions ensure rapid cell movement and microcolonies assemble, disassemble, and change their shape within minutes (<a href=\"#bib12\">Dewenter et al., 2015</a>).

The morphologies we observed in liquid culture are in accordance with the predicted ones. However, active pilus retraction was required for generating these well-defined morphologies. Recently, we provided evidence that gonococci move over surfaces by a tug-of-war of multiple pili (<a href=\"#bib33\">Marathe et al., 2014</a>). Therefore, it is likely that bacteria within microcolonies employ a tug-of-war mechanism for segregation (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>). Based on the pilus\u2013pilus rupture forces, all four morphotyes shown in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a> can be explained. Bacteria with the same composition and number of pili exhibit equal net rupture forces between all cells. Accordingly, we found well-mixed aggregates. Bacteria without pili show no interaction amongst themselves or with wt bacteria, in agreement with <i>F</i><sub><i>wt/P\u2212</i></sub> <i>\u2248 F</i><sub><i>P\u2212/P\u2212</i></sub> <i>\u2248 0.</i> Co-incubation of hyperpiliated <i>P++</i> and wt led to the formation of a sphere of <i>P++</i> in the center and a fully surrounding shell of <i>P+</i> in agreement with <i>F</i><sub><i>P++/P++</i></sub> <i>&gt; F</i><sub><i>P++/wt</i></sub> <i>&gt; F</i><sub><i>wt/wt</i></sub>.

Pili continuously elongate and retract. During retraction, they generate force on an attached object. When pili bind to other pili and retract they generate force on each other. The probability of bond rupture increases with force. Since the rupture force between <i>G\u2212</i> and <i>G\u2212</i> pili is larger than between wt and <i>G\u2212</i> pili, the latter bond is more likely to rupture. Pilus retraction pulls the cell body in the direction in which the strongest, least breakable bonds are formed. Cells whose bonds are most easily broken are squeezed outward to the peripheral layer."

A normalized, smoothed, average of the images of all positions at the beginning of the experiment is used to correct for inhomogeneous illumination. At the beginning only single cells are present, hence only the average illumination is visible in the average image. All positions of a single time-point were stitched together. High local intensity variance in windows of 5\u00d7 5 pixels served as indicator for the presence of a growing microcolony, that is, there is a high variation of dark and bright pixels for colonies, but only small variance for pixels without colonies (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Thresholding the local variance image gives a binary image indicating the growing colonies. The binary image was further processed by binary dilations, to ensure connected segmentations of colonies, which was followed by binary erosions to reduce any segments due to noise, but, also, to shrink the contour of the segment of a colony, such that the contour lies more on top of the bacteria at the front. After filling the holes in all binary segments, the contour pixels were defined to be the pixels that are affected by a further binary erosion. A circle fit on the contour pixels of each individual segment gives the information of center and radius of the colony. The centers of all circles were tracked to find regions of interests (ROIs) of growing microcolonies that have not yet grown into another colony. Fluorescence was segmented as follows: the stitched fluorescence image was convolved with a gaussian kernel of 11 \u00d7 11 px with \u03c3 = 1.5 px. The local intensity background of each ROI was found and subtracted. Thresholding of the background corrected fluorescence inside every ROI allowed to segment the patches of fluorescent bacteria (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

Given the center and radius of the growing colony at any time, all Cartesian coordinates can be transformed into polar coordinates. The exponential growth of the radius of the colony implies that all distances inside the colony should, also, grow in the same exponential fashion. This can be illustrated by normalizing the polar coordinates by the radius. <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1C,D</a> show a row of brightfield and fluorescence images, with the circle fit of the colony to fill always the same proportion of the sub-image. As a result, the scale bar shrinks in time, while the apparent colony size stays constant. Due to this normalization, the apparent position of segmented patches, also, stays roughly constant. The last column in (b) shows a superposition of all time-points of the normalized coordinates onto a unit-circle at the top, and a superposition of all time-points without normalization at the bottom onto the final fluorescence image. Due to the clear separation of clonal normalized coordinates, a manual selection of areas inside the unit-circle allowed to easily define all coordinates resulting from the same clone."

Using the drag force method, we found that the linear force range of the optical trap was <i>d</i> = 450 nm when gonococci were trapped. Therefore, the maximum force we detected was <i>F</i> = 65 pN. The retraction experiments were performed in a sealed chamber using a low-density suspension of gonococci, allowing for undisturbed measurement of single bacteria over a period of minutes. During the experiment, a single bacterium was trapped near the surface using the optical tweezers. Retraction of surface-bound pili resulted in deflection of the bacterium from the center of the optical trap as measured by the four-quadrant photodiode. The force acting on a bacterium is proportional to its deflection and was calculated using the calibration described above. After several minutes, a detrimental effect of the optical trap on the bacterium became apparent and it was abandoned."

Indeed, they followed our recommendations very well. For one, they now start with presentation of the theory and proceed to use the <i>Neisseria</i> pili system to test it. They also have removed a lot of the results they had previously presented on phase variation because they detracted and confused more that they contributed to the main aim. Thus, we feel that the new version is much improved. The data that are now included are otherwise the same as before and they remain strong. Our main comments are that the paper needs editing. In particular, parts of the Discussion are redundant with the Results section (the parts that merely summarize the results again without additional discussion, e.g. the second and third paragraphs of the subsection \u201cDifferential physical interactions drive cell sorting\u201d).

From my perspective the experiments have been well carried out. A very important control was carried out in using cells that were mutated for the ability to vary their pili and sectoring was shown to be reduced. This is critical to me because the observed reduction (rather than complete lack) of segregation already indicates that a major contributor to segregation is indeed simply where the cells are and thus defines where their progeny will be located. So the while the forces of the cell\u2013cell interactions are contributing to the segregation patterns observed, they are not the sole factor. This greatly dampens the claims regarding the biology of this pathogen in particular. But most importantly, from my perspective, while the finding that pilus\u2013pilus interaction forces influence segregation is very \u201cneat\u201d, it is really not a great insight regarding the biology of the organism. The contribution, as currently presented, seems to be more appropriate for a more specialized journal. However, if the results were to be presented differently, first posing the importance of how theory predicts that interaction forces between cells (in general) should lead to cell progeny segregation and only after that proceed to present the findings, this could be an important contribution. This work is not so much about this pathogen in particular but in general for all biological situations where cell\u2013cell interactions might influence the spatial arrangements of progeny cells.

To disentangle the effects of different generation times and different physical interactions, we plotted the location variance as a function of cell number rather than time. The fact that the variance was higher for non-piliated cells than for piliated cells shows that they are more mobile and have the potential to segregate."

In agreement with this assumption, we found nearly complete cell sorting."
