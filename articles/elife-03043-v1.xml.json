A skilled pianist can also improvise, pairing the same keystrokes with a different rhythm or playing the same rhythm with a slightly different sequence of keys. This ability to flexibly modify and recombine sequences of physical movements in space and time enables humans to exhibit great creativity in music, language, and many other tasks that require motor skills. However, the underlying brain mechanisms that allow this flexibility are only beginning to be explored."

An alternate idea is that the brain captures the information necessary to execute a series of physical movements separately from the timing at which the movements are to be carried out.

The ordering of these muscle activations\u2014and hence the ordering of the movements of different body parts in space\u2014is here referred to as the \u2018spatial feature\u2019 of a sequence. Additionally, movement sequences are often characterized by a stereotypical temporal structure or rhythm\u2014their \u2018temporal feature\u2019. The latter can either emerge spontaneously as part of chunk formation (<a href=\"#bib49\">Sakai et al., 2003</a>), or be directly relevant to the goal of the sequence, as in musical performance, dance, or speech (<a href=\"#bib56\">Shin and Ivry, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Lewis and Miall, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Repp, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Kotz and Schwartze, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Bl\u00e4sing et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Grahn, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Penhune and Steele, 2012</a>). One of the hallmarks of human motor performance is the ease with which experts can modify the temporal and spatial features of learned motor skills. For example, a pianist is able to play the same tune using different variations of the rhythm, and a fluent speaker can change separately the word order or the rhythmic profile of speech for effective communication. How is such flexibility in skilled actions achieved neurally?"

Recent work suggests that spatio-temporal trajectories of movements can be learned and produced by a dynamical network of neurons that encodes patterned muscle dynamics, instead of by representing different parameters of a movement sequence separately (<a href=\"#bib34\">Laje and Buonomano, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Shenoy et al., 2013</a>). This neural implementation has been advocated for the primary motor and premotor cortices and implies that temporal features are stored inseparably from the specific movement trajectory trained. From this perspective, a spatial sequence performed with two different temporal profiles would constitute two distinct behaviours and demand the training of independent neural generators."

Inactivating the SMA, the primary motor cortex, the putamen or the dentate nucleus in monkeys disrupts sequential behaviour whilst sparing individual actions (<a href=\"#bib60\">Tanji and Shima, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Shima and Tanji, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Hikosaka et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Lu and Ashe, 2005</a>), with a similar effect demonstrated for the SMA/pre-SMA in humans with non-invasive stimulation techniques (<a href=\"#bib19\">Gerloff et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Kennerley et al., 2004</a>). Recent evidence in primates also argues for the existence of neurons tuned to specific temporal intervals between movements in the same area, with a subset also tuned to the position of an interval in a sequence (<a href=\"#bib40\">Merchant et al., 2013</a>). However, it remains unknown whether these neurons are simply part of a dynamical network that represents spatial and temporal features in an integrated manner, or whether independent populations of neurons encode spatial and temporal features in isolation."

If such sequence-specific tuning is sufficiently clustered, it should be detectable with the relatively low spatial resolution of fMRI (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kamitani and Tong, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Swisher et al., 2010</a>). Using a classification approach to evaluate these subtle differences in the local patterns of brain activity during sequence production, a recent imaging study (<a href=\"#bib63\">Wiestler and Diedrichsen, 2013</a>) indeed showed that such sequential tuning can be detected in the human brain in a range of motor and premotor areas.

First, by looking at behavioural generalisation, we show transfer of trained temporal and spatial features to new combinations. Second, by employing separate classification procedures of fMRI voxel activity patterns and testing for generalization of patterns across temporal or spatial contexts, we were able to dissociate independent spatial and temporal from integrated representation profiles across the human motor system."

Subjects were trained to produce nine finger sequences that were unique combinations of three temporal and three spatial sequence features (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>) randomly generated for each subject. Half the participants trained and performed the sequences with the left, the other half with the right hand. Over the course of 3 days of training the force responses on the keyboard triggered by the visual stimulus became faster (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). The average reaction time (RT) decreased from 410 ms (SD: 70) to 288 ms (SD: 48, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). To assess the specificity of the improvement in motor performance to the trained sequences, we also tested participants on sequences composed of untrained spatial and temporal features. Subjects also reduced the RT for untrained sequences from 456 ms (SD: 90) to 346 ms (SD: 64), which suggests a general effect of visuomotor learning. However, the reduction was significantly smaller than that for the trained sequences (<i>F</i><sub>(1,30)</sub> = 13.342, p=0.001), and there was no interaction with the group (right-hand-trained vs left hand, <i>F</i><sub>(1,30)</sub> = 1.235, p=0.275). Overall error rates across conditions paralleled the RT findings (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). For trained sequences the error rate reduced from 46.1% (SD: 26.7) to 6.3% (SD: 4.9). For untrained from 52.1% (SD: 31.6) to 29.5% (SD: 21), suggesting that the RT findings were not due to a change in the speed-accuracy trade-off. During the fMRI session we only tested the nine trained sequences. The RTs increased as compared to the end of training (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, <i>t</i>(31) = 6.57, p&lt;0.0001). This occurred despite the subjects' familiarity with a supine position on a mock MRI bed during training and may be related to the fMRI noise during the performance of the task, the lack of any auditory movement feedback occurring, as well as a more restricted mobility in an MRI environment. Importantly, however, across subjects individual RTs during fMRI session strongly correlated with RTs for trained sequences in the last training block (<i>r</i> = 0.717, p&lt;0.0001), indicating that the responses reflected consistent measures of behaviour."

Based on previous studies (<a href=\"#bib56\">Shin and Ivry, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">O\u2019Reilly et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Brown et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Kornysheva et al., 2013</a>), we expected evidence only for spatial, but not for temporal feature transfer in the first three trials. Indeed, during the training phase, in which each sequence was repeated only three times in a row (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), and during the first trials in the post-test (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>) the temporal transfer condition was not performed faster than untrained control sequence. However, consistent with two previous experiments (<a href=\"#bib31\">Kornysheva et al., 2013</a>), a delayed RT advantage for the temporal transfer condition emerged after a few repetitions of the new sequence combination (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, left panel). Averaged over all nine repetitions in the post-test, sequences which combined a trained temporal (<i>F</i><sub>(1,28)</sub> = 12.963, p=0.001) or spatial (<i>F</i><sub>(1,28)</sub> = 20.830, p=0.0001) feature with an untrained feature were performed faster than a repetition of a completely novel sequence (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, right panel). This suggests that training of timed finger sequences automatically results in independent storage of its spatial and temporal features. ANOVAs also revealed that these effects did not differ between the left and right-hand-trained groups (p&gt;0.127). These results replicate earlier findings and can be explained by a model in which the temporal representation acts as a multiplicative go signal on a concrete spatial plan (<a href=\"#bib31\">Kornysheva et al., 2013</a>); while both temporal and spatial sequences are represented independently, the temporal representations act at the output stage as a modulator on a spatial expectation. Thus, without a spatial expectation, temporal knowledge does not have an effect. For this reason, temporal transfer cannot manifest itself immediately, but only after a plan for the next movement has been formed (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hikosaka et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Penhune and Steele, 2012</a>)."

To detect such patterns, a spatial classifier was trained on trials where the three spatial features were combined with two different temporal features, and then tested on data in which these spatial features were combined with a new temporal feature (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Therefore, this classifier can only yield above-chance accuracy, when the voxels show consistent tuning for the spatial features, independently of the temporal structure of finger sequences. The temporal classifier (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>) was defined in the same way, but classified temporal features combined over two spatial features, and tested on the left out spatial feature. Finally, the integrated classifier (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>) tested for a non-linear interaction between the tuning for temporal and spatial features by subtracting out information that could be explained by each component (spatial or temporal) separately. The classifier therefore only detects regions that show unique, idiosyncratic patterns for each of the nine sequences. Our pattern simulations demonstrated that this set of four classifiers could sensitively reveal the type of the underlying representation.

An ROI (M1 vs premotor) \u00d7 hemisphere (contralateral vs ipsilateral) \u00d7 classifier (integrated vs independent spatial and temporal) \u00d7 group (right vs left hand) mixed ANOVA indeed revealed a significant ROI \u00d7 hemisphere \u00d7 classifier interaction (<i>F</i><sub>(1,30)</sub> = 12.808, p=0.001). This effect did not interact with group (p=0.75), suggesting that although the effect was less pronounced for left-hand-trained participants, the distribution of integrated and independent sequence encoding was similar for left and right hand sequence production (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The difference in representation can be better appreciated in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, which shows the level of temporal, spatial, and integrated sequence feature encoding on a cross-section running from rostral PMd to the caudal end of the occipito-parietal junction (cf. <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a> for profiles split by right and left hand groups). In contrast to temporal and spatial encoding, integrated encoding peaked at the level of the central sulcus in the contralateral hemisphere. To test for differences in the distribution of integrated and independent encoding, we used a Center of Gravity (CoG) analysis. We determined the CoG for integrated and independent (averaged over spatial and temporal) classification accuracies on the precentral part of the cross-section. Indeed, we found a more caudal CoG for integrated, and a more rostral CoG for independent encoding in the contralateral hemispheres of both left- and right-hand groups (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). A hemisphere (contralateral vs ipsilateral) \u00d7 classifier (integrated vs independent) \u00d7 group (right vs left hand) mixed ANOVA revealed a hemisphere \u00d7 classifier interaction (<i>F</i><sub>(1,30)</sub> = 6.417, p=0.017), but no interaction with group (p=0.409). For the postcentral part of the cross-section, we found the reverse pattern\u2014a more caudal CoG for independent as compared to integrated encoding (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). Again the hemisphere (contralateral vs ipsilateral) \u00d7 classifier (integrated vs independent) interaction was highly significant (<i>F</i><sub>(1,30)</sub> = 13.394, p=0.001), and did not interact with group (p=0.088). These results therefore clearly suggest a difference in how primary motor and premotor, as well as parietal areas represent spatio-temporal finger sequences."

It is only through the use of multivariate analysis techniques that we were able to distinguish such overlap of independent representations from the integrated representation in the primary motor cortex. Inspection of the temporal and spatial representation maps, however, also suggests a difference in where temporal and spatial features are localised. Especially in the ipsilateral premotor cortex, it appears that temporal encoding was more pronounced in the ventral, whereas spatial representations are more evident in the dorsal premotor cortex. This gradient can be seen more clearly on a profile plot of encoding in the premotor cortex (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>).

                                "text": "However, there is good evidence to suggest that this effect cannot account for the results reported here. First, if the classification reflected tuning to individual finger movements, all classifiers should show the highest accuracy in the contralateral hand area of S1 and M1, where finger representations are the strongest (<a href=\"#bib64\">Wiestler et al., 2011</a>). This, however, could not be observed, as evidenced by a differential distribution of temporal, spatial, and integrated encoding across the brain. Second, each sequence trial was produced three times in a row (mini-block), so that the main response function was elevated across the execution of three sequences and did not return to baseline before the end of the last trial (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>). It therefore should be insensitive to differences in the temporal activation profile within each execution. In contrast, the temporal derivative of the main response function included in our first level general linear model (GLM), captured variations of the temporal profile within each trial. For example, the derivative would indicate whether a voxel was activated more in the early or late phase of each sequence. For the main classification analysis, we discounted the derivative, as we wanted to isolate differences in spatial activity patterns, rather than different temporal profiles. However, the response derivate also allowed us to test for the information contained in different temporal activation profiles (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>). As expected, based on the derivative, we observed increased classification accuracy of independent spatial and to some degree also temporal features in M1, while in premotor areas such as the PMd, the independent classifiers performed much worse, in line with the evidence suggesting weaker finger representations in premotor areas (<a href=\"#bib15\">Diedrichsen et al., 2013b</a>). The factors response type (main response vs derivative), ROI (M1 vs PMd), and hemisphere (contralateral vs ipsilateral) showed a significant interaction between the three factors for both spatial (<i>F</i><sub>(1,31)</sub> = 9.165, p=0.005) and temporal encoding (<i>F</i><sub>(1,31)</sub> = 5.395, p=0.027). This suggests that the voxel patterns based on the main response estimates are unlikely to reflect differences in the temporal profile of the observed response."

Despite employing the same fingers and the same temporal intervals across all nine sequences, as well as by controlling the number of runs and jumps between finger digits and intervals (ascending or descending interval transitions), in some subjects minor, but systematic finger force differences between the trained sequences occurred, such as more force on the thumb in one sequence and on the index finger in a different sequence (<a href=\"#fig4s4\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). Accordingly, force on the five fingers could be used to reliably classify the nine-trained sequences (mean <i>zacc</i> = 2.25, <i>t</i>(31) = 10.914, p&lt;0.001).

We were able to dissociate independent feature representations in which voxel patterns related to spatial and temporal sequence features combined linearly, from integrated feature representations in which each spatio-temporal combination was associated with a unique activity pattern. We demonstrate that only the output stage of the cortical motor hierarchy, the primary motor cortex (M1) contralateral to the moving hand, encoded spatio-temporal features of finger sequences in an integrated fashion. In contrast, bilateral medial and lateral premotor cortices showed partly overlapping, but mutually independent representations of the spatial and temporal features.

We found that the overall sequence encoding in the contralateral M1 covaried with the amount of behavioural advantages for the trained sequences, suggesting that our analysis uncovered skill-dependent representations. The fact that each spatio-temporal sequence combination had its unique activity pattern in M1 is consistent with a dynamical systems view which proposes that each movement is controlled by a subpopulation of neurons that form a dynamical network (<a href=\"#bib34\">Laje and Buonomano, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Shenoy et al., 2013</a>). Instead of representing movement features separately, these networks are assumed to produce complex movement patterns based on a neural state-space trajectory, which is determined by the internal connectivity and external input to the circuitry (<a href=\"#bib53\">Shenoy et al., 2013</a>). Accordingly, for each unique spatio-temporal sequence a slightly different distribution of neurons is activated in M1 which in turn cause distinct voxel activity patterns for each of the studied sequence combinations (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kamitani and Tong, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Kriegeskorte et al., 2006</a>).

With spatial and temporal features of movement trajectories emerging from the same local circuits, an integrated representation as proposed in dynamical systems models (<a href=\"#bib53\">Shenoy et al., 2013</a>) cannot explain the flexible transfer or independent adaptation of spatial and temporal features reported here and in previous studies (<a href=\"#bib62\">Ull\u00e9n and Bengtsson, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Ali et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Kornysheva et al., 2013</a>). In contrast, our results indicate that higher order motor areas (lateral and medial premotor cortices) parsed the sequences into the two constituent features, in line with the modularity and flexibility we observed in behaviour. The independent albeit partly overlapping spatial and temporal encoding suggests a modular feature-separating storage for movement production."

For example, the temporal profile of a force perturbation during a reaching movement is learned inseparably from the whole spatio-temporal trajectory (<a href=\"#bib9\">Conditt and Mussa-Ivaldi, 1999</a>). One critical factor that distinguishes these classes may be whether movement kinematics are continuous as in reaching movements or fall into discrete phases, as induced by the current task (<a href=\"#bib25\">Ivry et al., 2002</a>). In contrast, for discrete sequential movements, as studied here, the evidence for an independent representation of the temporal structure is compelling. Importantly, our behavioural finding is unlikely to be an effect artificially induced by the orthogonal design, in which all three spatial sequence features were crossed with three temporal features, since flexibility in independently adapting spatial or temporal features of sequences has also been observed in a previous study which involved the training of only one particular spatio-temporal combination (<a href=\"#bib31\">Kornysheva et al., 2013</a>)."

However, these studies did not establish how temporal and spatial features were encoded. Here, we address this issue, starting from a recent study that showed that voxel pattern analysis can uncover sequence representations in motor and premotor areas, which are specifically enhanced for trained sequences (<a href=\"#bib63\">Wiestler and Diedrichsen, 2013</a>). This classification analysis was now extended to identify regions with voxel patterns related to spatial and temporal sequence features that were represented independently from the respective other feature. Our representational analysis allowed us for the first time to distinguish between integrated vs independent representations, even if the independent spatial and temporal representations overlapped spatially. While we validated this approach by voxel pattern simulations, the analysis hinges critically on the assumption that activity in independent neuronal populations within a single voxel combine additively in the observed BOLD signal. Is this assumption justified? Functional imaging signals show clear non-linearities when studied over a large dynamic range (<a href=\"#bib36\">Logothetis et al., 2001</a>). However, the activity of single voxels only varied very slightly between different sequences in our paradigm. For this restricted range, therefore, we can be relatively confident that a linear approximation is reasonable (<a href=\"#bib14\">Diedrichsen et al., 2013a</a>). Furthermore, because any non-linearity between neural signal and hemodynamic response should be relatively homogenous across adjacent cortical motor areas, the distinct representational dissociation found between M1 and PMd is likely to reflect neural rather than hemodynamic differences."

Such units have been suggested to be an important component in the organisation of skilled sequential behaviours, however whether timing between movements modulates the same neurons has not been systematically explored. Our findings of independent representations of the spatial and temporal features predict that the representation of movement order in space first reported by Shima and Tanji in the SMA (<a href=\"#bib60\">Tanji and Shima, 1994</a>) is likely to be independent of the exact timing of individual movements in the sequence. In other words, changing the temporal intervals between movements in a sequence should not interfere with the tuning of the neuron to a specific spatial movement transition or sequence."

In addition to neurons tuned to interval duration, the authors found cells that are tuned to both a specific interval between movements and a specific position in a sequence, for example, a neuron increased its firing rate only to the 850 ms interval between the fifth and sixth lever push. This type of encoding would be detectable with our method since in the trained sequences the individual digits and temporal intervals occurred at unique positions. However, the intervals tested in each sequence were isochronous, and it is currently unknown whether this type of encoding would generalize to a sequential temporal pattern similar to the one employed in the current task."

Yet, whether this type of encoding can also be modulated by the sequential context is not known. In contrast to our findings in the cortex, the cerebellum did not yield significant results with regard to temporal encoding, although there was a clear significant overall encoding of the sequences in the ipsilateral lobule VI which forms reciprocal connections with contralateral premotor areas (<a href=\"#bib7\">Buckner et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bostan et al., 2013</a>).

This regional distribution raises the possibility that the temporal representation uncovered here may not be an abstract representation of the temporal structure of sequences, but rather a representation of an additional effector system. Indeed, most subjects' introspective reports suggests subvocal rehearsal at the beginning of their training, albeit less so towards the end of training and during fMRI. However, a simple mapping of the temporal feature representations to the control of vocal sequencing and timing is unlikely. There was no direct involvement of more posterior and perisylvian primary vocalization centres. Moreover, cross-sections through the cortical Brodmann area 6 suggest that temporal encoding largely overlapped with spatial encoding along the premotor cortex, instead of being restricted to ventral-most premotor areas recruited for rhythmically structured vocal rehearsal (<a href=\"#bib48\">Riecker et al., 2002</a>). Instead, the nervous system may build on specialised processes in premotor areas for temporal control, which have originally evolved for the sequencing of the oro-facial and laryngeal musculature in speech production (<a href=\"#bib51\">Schubotz, 2007</a>). Such a temporal representation in the premotor cortex could modulate the finger motor system at the level of M1 by interacting with premotor input from the spatial representation in a non-linear manner, as suggested in our multiplicative model (<a href=\"#bib31\">Kornysheva et al., 2013</a>), thereby modulating the integrated dynamical systems representation of the sequences in M1."

Finally, multiple spatial representations may reflect different spatial sequence reference frames\u2014such as movement sequences in extrinsic spatial coordinates in the rostral PMd and the posterior parietal cortex (<a href=\"#bib6\">Brown et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Wiestler et al., 2014</a>) and in intrinsic spatial coordinates in the caudal PMd (<a href=\"#bib65\">Wiestler et al., 2014</a>).

If the system utilized integrated encoding alone, such as in the primary motor cortex, it would have to represent all relevant permutations of spatial, temporal and other relevant parameters (e.g., amplitude and direction), which very quickly would lead to a combinatorial explosion. Instead, the premotor cortex may dedicate its resources to representing these features separately, creating a more compact and flexible representation. This special feature may explain why evolution endowed us with premotor areas, rather than simply with a larger primary motor cortex. This architecture has parallels in the ventral visual stream, in which lower visual areas encode specific combinations of simple features at specific spatial locations, whereas higher visual areas represent more complex visual arrangements\u2014such as body parts and scenes\u2014independently of their orientation or location of the stimulus (<a href=\"#bib18\">Freeman and Simoncelli, 2011</a>).

The digits 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 instructed to press the thumb, index, middle, ring, and little finger of the right or left hand, respectively. We expected that while the first execution of a sequence would be rather reactive and driven by the cue, the second and third execution would rely on a learned representation of the sequence in question. Indeed the second and third execution during fMRI was significantly faster than the first one (<i>t</i>(31) = 9.608, p&lt;0.001). Participants were instructed to perform the task as fast and accurately as possible. Each trial started with a warning cue (\u2018!\u2019; duration: 400 ms), followed by a sequence of five digits that was timed according to a sequence of five possible inter-stimulus-interval values (ISI; 600, 800, 1000, 1400, 1700 ms). The first ISI commenced when the warning cue disappeared.  Each digit remained on the screen until the onset of the next digit according to the respective ISI value or for 600ms after the onset of the last digit. The trial ended with an inter-trial interval of 1.6 s, making each trial 8.1 s long. Subjects received feedback on their performance throughout the experiment as follows: if the subjects pressed the correct button within the limits of 50 ms before the onset of the current and 50 ms before the onset of the next digit, that digit turned green; if the response was too early the next digit appeared in yellow; if the response was too late the digit turned turquoise; if the finger press was incorrect, the digit turned red. Subjects received a point only when all digits in a sequence turned green, that is, when they pressed the correct finger in the correct time window. After each block of 27 (training and post-test) and 54 (fMRI test) trials, respectively, subjects received feedback on their cumulative point score and the median RT in the last block. They were informed that the participant with the highest cumulative score (weighted by their reaction time) would receive an additional financial reward."

Three additional probe blocks per day were introduced to measure RT advantages related to trained sequences, as well as independent temporal and spatial transfer to new sequences throughout the training phase. Each probe block contained three probe conditions. In the <i>trained temporal</i> condition the cues appeared with each of the trained temporal features, but indicating an untrained order of finger presses. The untrained order was different in each of the three timing probe blocks, but was repeated across the three trials of each mini-block. In the <i>trained spatial</i> condition, the visual stimulus cued sequences involving trained spatial sequence features of finger presses, but in combination with a new temporal feature, that is an untrained sequence of inter-stimulus-intervals. Equally, the new temporal sequence was different in each of the three order probe blocks, but did not change across the three trials of each mini-block. Finally, the <i>untrained</i> condition cued a sequence of finger presses and inter-stimulus intervals that were different from any other trained condition. Again, the novel combination of spatial and temporal features was different in each of the three untrained sequence blocks, but repeated three times in each mini-block. This made the probe blocks as similar as possible to the training blocks. Finally, the three training sessions were identical in terms of sequences and trial randomisation, ensuring that behavioural change could not be explained by differences in sequences or trial delivery. The probe blocks appeared in the beginning (1st block), the middle (11th block) and the end (21st block) of each training session. Whether subjects started the first training day with a probe block or a training block was counterbalanced across subjects.

This main regressor consisted of boxcar functions for each execution of the sequence of that type, each starting at the moment of warning cue and lasting for 6.5 s (2.4 TRs), which was then convolved with the standard hemodynamic response function (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Additionally, we included the temporal derivate of the response in the model, linearly independent of the main response. Only the main response was used for classification analysis, to determine differences in spatial activation patterns averaged over the sequence executions, rather than differences in the temporal profiles of the sequence. In addition, each error (incorrect finger response) was modeled as a regressor of no interest, one regressor per imaging run starting at the onset of the digit presentation associated with an erroneous response and lasting for 2.72 s (1 TR) to account for errors at different positions in the sequence. For each imaging run and voxel, the analysis therefore estimated in 20 regression coefficients (9 sequence regressors, 1 error regressor plus 10 respective temporal derivative), from which the nine main sequence response estimates were used in the classification analysis."

Four motor areas with significant overall sequence encoding were considered for ROI analysis: bilateral primary motor (M1), supplementary motor area (SMA), dorsal (PMd), and ventral premotor cortex (PMv). The hand region of primary motor cortex (M1) was defined as Brodmann area (BA) 4, 2.5 cm above and below the hand knob (<a href=\"#bib67\">Yousry, 1997</a>). Dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) was defined as the lateral aspect of BA 6, superior and PMv inferior to the middle frontal gyrus. The supplementary motor areas (SMA/pre-SMA) comprised the medial aspect of BA6. The M1, SMA, and PMd were identical to the ROIs used in previous work (<a href=\"#bib63\">Wiestler and Diedrichsen, 2013</a>) and the PMv was added as the lateral part of the premotor cortex (BA6) ventral to PMd."

The first cross-section through the surface map ran from the rostral end of PMd to the posterior superior parietal cortex. The second cross-section went through BA6, from the ventral tip through dorsal premotor cortex into the SMA. To determine biases in sequence feature encoding within these cross-sections, we determined the center of gravity (CoG) for each subject, classification type, and hemisphere. The minimum classification accuracy value of the respective classifier across the profile of interest was first set to zero (baseline) before determining the CoG of the accuracy shapes. The CoG was calculated by computing the spatial average of the coordinates of all nodes in the cross-section, after weighting each with the normalised classification accuracy z at this point. The CoG analysis was performed for three subsections: (1) rostral PMd to central sulcus, (2) central sulcus to the lateral part of the superior parietal cortex hitting the medial wall, and (3) The lateral aspect of BA6, starting at the level of the inferior frontal gyrus up to the crown of the cortex, excluding the portion of BA6 in the medial wall."

We considered the 20% most activated voxels in contralateral and ipsilateral M1, thus taking only nodes that were most recruited during the task. Sequence-specific learning was defined as the individual RT advantage for the trained sequences compared to untrained sequences in the post-test phase (cf. RT results). However, we also considered the possibility that the classification results may have been influenced by systematic differences in the execution of the sequences, specifically by differences in force produced by each finger. A region that is sensitive to these lower-level behavioural differences may look like it encodes sequential aspects of the task. To quantify the differences between sequences along these behavioural variables, we computed the accuracy of multivariate classification of the nine trained sequences (overall classifier), using maximum forces at each of the five fingers as different data features instead of voxel activity. Higher classification accuracy would indicate more pronounced force differences between the sequences. Subsequently, two-sided Pearson's correlations between the overall encoding in the contralateral and ipsilateral M1 and the RT difference between untrained and trained sequences in the post-test (RT advantage), as well as force classification accuracy were calculated."

I think that they could strengthen their interpretation of the current findings and the integration of these findings with their own theoretical model by considering the regions that encode the two different streams of information in a broader, network context. Finally, I think that they could better integrate their findings with previous human fMRI studies of motor sequence learning as well as those related to melody and rhythm processing."

I think that this makes sense from the point of view of the authors own theory and from that of others (see Hikosaka and Steele and Penhune). Essentially, you cannot accurately time a movement with an indeterminate target or trajectory. I think that this fits with the author's concept of temporal information being a multiplicative go signal. The examples the authors give of musical performance and speech also fit with this. In the first case, the musician already knows the melody (spatial order) and thus can modify the rhythm. In the case of the speech examples: 1) changing word order has to change timing by definition, and 2) temporal prosody is again a rhythm change laid on top of a known sequence of target movements. Overall, this experiment provides evidence that temporal information can be encoded as a separate stream of information, but whether it can actually be separated from a movement sequence in execution is a different question. I don't think that the authors have to make such a strong separability case to have this be very interesting and useful experiment."

In particular, they emphasize the fact that spatial and temporal features appear to be somewhat differently distributed along the PMC, but they do not talk about what appears to be the bigger difference between the two conditions in the parietal lobe (spatial &gt; temporal) and the ACC (temporal &gt; spatial). The fact that the parietal lobe seems to be exclusively tapped by the spatial condition fits with the well-described role of parietal cortex in spatial to motor transformations. It is also consistent with the results of Brown et al. who showed that intra-parietal sulcus showed greater repetition suppression response to melodies vs. rhythms. The parietal contribution to the spatial component could fit with the authors' theory in that it describes the system or mechanisms by which spatial information is encoded when the sequential and spatial information are not fully integrated. Similarly, the ACC engagement in the temporal condition seems to fit well with the idea that temporal information is some kind of a go signal operating on top of a spatial/kinematic sequence given the ACC's role in motor reprogramming and response inhibition."

We agree that there was no difference between trained temporal and untrained sequences in the first three trial repetitions and that the advantage of temporal transfer does only emerge after three repetitions. We have now emphasized this point more clearly in the text. Importantly, this finding is an exact replication of our previous experiments (<a href=\"#bib31\">Kornysheva, Sierk &amp; Diedrichsen, 2013</a>, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>) showing that the relative behavioural difference between trained temporal and untrained sequences emerges with further trial repetitions of both types of sequences. This delayed behavioural advantage suggests the existence of an independent representation of the temporal structure in the CNS. However, this representation can only be utilized when the spatial sequence is known. In contrast, a known spatial sequence leads to immediate advantage in reaction time. In <a href=\"#bib31\">Kornysheva et al. (2013)</a> we offer a simple model to explain this asymmetry: Both temporal and spatial sequences are represented independently, but at the output stage, the temporal representations acts as a modulator on a spatial expectation. Thus, without a spatial expectation, temporal knowledge does not have an effect. This model reconciles disparate results in the literature with regard to temporal transfer (for references, cf. <a href=\"#bib31\">Kornysheva et al. 2013</a>)."

The hippocampus and the basal ganglia were not included in the searchlight analysis since this has been performed on the cortical surface and the cerebellar volume only.

In particular, they emphasize the fact that spatial and temporal features appear to be somewhat differently distributed along the PMC, but they do not talk about what appears to be the bigger difference between the two conditions in the parietal lobe (spatial &gt; temporal) and the ACC (temporal &gt; spatial). The fact that the parietal lobe seems to be exclusively tapped by the spatial condition fits with the well-described role of parietal cortex in spatial to motor transformations. It is also consistent with the results of Brown et al. who showed that intra-parietal sulcus showed greater repetition suppression response to melodies vs. rhythms. The parietal contribution to the spatial component could fit with the authors' theory in that it describes the system or mechanisms by which spatial information is encoded when the sequential and spatial information are not fully integrated. Similarly, the ACC engagement in the temporal condition seems to fit well with the idea that temporal information is some kind of a go signal operating on top of a spatial/kinematic sequence given the ACC's role in motor reprogramming and response inhibition</i>."

We also further emphasized that our claim of independence of spatial and temporal representations does not rely necessarily on the finding that they are represented in separate areas. Indeed, the advantage of our analysis approach is that we can identify integrated vs. separate representation by virtue of the fact that independent representations the temporal and spatial patterns combine linearly (as found in PMC), and that for integrated representations unique activity patterns are found for each combinations (i.e. temporal and spatial patterns combined non-linearly). Thus, even though spatial and temporal representations were regionally overlapping, including those in the ACC/SMA and the parietal lobe, as best seen on the cross-section through the cortex, our analysis still provides strong evidence that they were represented within overlapping regions in an independent fashion."
