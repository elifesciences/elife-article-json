                    "text": "Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling elicits context-dependent transcription switches that determine normal development and oncogenesis. These are mediated by the Wnt enhanceosome, a multiprotein complex binding to the Pygo chromatin reader and acting through TCF/LEF-responsive enhancers. Pygo renders this complex Wnt-responsive, by capturing \u03b2-catenin via the Legless/BCL9 adaptor. We used CRISPR/Cas9 genome engineering of <i>Drosophila legless (lgs)</i> and human <i>BCL9</i> and <i>B9L</i> to show that the C-terminus downstream of their adaptor elements is crucial for Wnt responses. BioID proximity labeling revealed that BCL9 and B9L, like PYGO2, are constitutive components of the Wnt enhanceosome. Wnt-dependent docking of \u03b2-catenin to the enhanceosome apparently causes a rearrangement that apposes the BCL9/B9L C-terminus to TCF. This C-terminus binds to the Groucho/TLE co-repressor, and also to the Chip/LDB1-SSDP enhanceosome core complex via an evolutionary conserved element. An unexpected link between BCL9/B9L, PYGO2 and nuclear co-receptor complexes suggests that these \u03b2-catenin co-factors may coordinate Wnt and nuclear hormone responses."

These are mediated by the Wnt enhanceosome, a multiprotein complex binding to the Pygo chromatin reader and acting through TCF/LEF-responsive enhancers. Pygo renders this complex Wnt-responsive, by capturing \u03b2-catenin via the Legless/BCL9 adaptor. We used CRISPR/Cas9 genome engineering of <i>Drosophila legless (lgs)</i> and human <i>BCL9</i> and <i>B9L</i> to show that the C-terminus downstream of their adaptor elements is crucial for Wnt responses. BioID proximity labeling revealed that BCL9 and B9L, like PYGO2, are constitutive components of the Wnt enhanceosome. Wnt-dependent docking of \u03b2-catenin to the enhanceosome apparently causes a rearrangement that apposes the BCL9/B9L C-terminus to TCF. This C-terminus binds to the Groucho/TLE co-repressor, and also to the Chip/LDB1-SSDP enhanceosome core complex via an evolutionary conserved element. An unexpected link between BCL9/B9L, PYGO2 and nuclear co-receptor complexes suggests that these \u03b2-catenin co-factors may coordinate Wnt and nuclear hormone responses."

Deregulation of the pathway in adult tissues can lead to many different cancers, most notably colorectal cancer (<a href=\"#bib10\">Clevers and Nusse, 2012</a>). Wnt-induced transcription is mediated by T cell factors (TCF1/3/4, LEF1) bound to Wnt-responsive enhancers, but their activity depends on the co-activator \u03b2-catenin (Armadillo in <i>Drosophila</i>), which is rapidly degraded in unstimulated cells. Absence of \u03b2-catenin thus defines the OFF state of these enhancers, which are silenced by Groucho/TLE co-repressors bound to TCF via their Q domain. This domain tetramerizes to promote transcriptional repression (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chodaparambil et al., 2014</a>), which leads to chromatin compaction\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib58\">Sekiya and Zaret, 2007</a>)\u00a0apparently assisted by the interaction between Groucho/TLE and histone deacetylases (HDACs) (<a href=\"#bib30\">Jennings et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Turki-Judeh and Courey, 2012</a>)."

This involves the binding of \u03b2-catenin to various transcriptional co-activators via its C-terminus, most notably to the CREB-binding protein (CBP) histone acetyltransferase or its p300 paralog (<a href=\"#bib43\">Mosimann et al., 2009</a>), resulting in the transcription of the linked Wnt target genes. Subsequent reversion to the OFF state (for\u00a0example, by negative feedback from high Wnt signaling levels near Wnt-producing cells, or upon cessation of signaling) involves Groucho/TLE-dependent silencing, but also requires the Osa/ARID1 subunit of the BAF (also known as SWI/SNF) chromatin remodeling complex (<a href=\"#bib11\">Collins and Treisman, 2000</a>) which binds to \u03b2-catenin through its BRG/BRM subunit (<a href=\"#bib3\">Barker et al., 2001</a>). Cancer genome sequencing has uncovered a widespread tumor suppressor role of the BAF complex, which guards against numerous cancers including colorectal cancer, with\u00a0&gt;20% of all cancers exhibiting at least one inactivating mutation in one of its subunits, most notably in ARID1A (<a href=\"#bib31\">Kadoch and Crabtree, 2015</a>). Thus, it appears that failure of Wnt-inducible enhancers to respond to negative feedback imposed by the BAF complex strongly predisposes to cancer."

Therefore, the simplest model envisaging competition between \u03b2-catenin and TLE cannot explain this switch, which implies that co-factors are required. One of these is Pygo, a chromatin reader binding to histone H3 tail methylated at lysine 4 (H3K4m) via its C-terminal PHD finger (<a href=\"#bib18\">Fiedler et al., 2008</a>). In <i>Drosophila</i> where Pygo was discovered as an essential co-factor for activated Armadillo, its main function appears to be to assist Armadillo in overcoming Groucho-dependent repression (<a href=\"#bib39\">Mieszczanek et al., 2008</a>). We recently discovered that Pygo associates with TCF enhancers via its highly conserved N-terminal NPF motif that binds directly to the ChiLS complex, composed of a dimer of Chip/LDB (LIM domain-binding protein) and a tetramer of SSDP (single-stranded DNA-binding protein, also known as SSBP). Notably, ChiLS also binds to other enhancer-bound NPF factors such as Osa/ARID1 and RUNX, and to the C-terminal WD40 domain of Groucho/TLE, and thus forms the core module of a multiprotein complex termed \u2018Wnt enhanceosome\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib17\">Fiedler et al., 2015</a>). We proposed that Pygo renders this complex Wnt-responsive by capturing Armadillo/\u03b2-catenin through the Legless adaptor (whose orthologs in humans are BCL9 and B9L, also known as BCL9-2) (<a href=\"#bib33\">Kramps et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">St\u00e4deli and Basler, 2005</a>). The salient feature of our model is that the Wnt enhanceosome keeps TCF target genes repressed prior to Wnt signaling while at the same time priming them for subsequent Wnt induction, and for timely shut-down via negative feedback depending on Osa/ARID1 (<a href=\"#bib17\">Fiedler et al., 2015</a>)."

Using a proximity-labeling proteomics approach (called BioID; <a href=\"#bib54\">Roux et al., 2012</a>) in human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells, we uncovered a compelling association between BCL9/B9L and the core Wnt enhanceosome components, regardless of Wnt signaling. Co-immunoprecipitation (coIP) and in vitro binding assays based on Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) revealed that BCL9 and B9L associate with TLE3 through their C-termini, and that they bind directly to ChiLS via their evolutionary conserved homology domain 3 (HD3). These elements are outside the sequences mediating the adaptor function between Pygo and Armadillo/\u03b2-catenin, but they are similarly important for Wnt responses during <i>Drosophila</i> development and in human cells, as we show by CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing. Our results consolidate and refine the Wnt enhanceosome model, indicating a constitutive scaffolding function of BCL9/B9L within this complex. Our evidence further suggests that BCL9/B9L but not Pygo undergoes a \u03b2-catenin-dependent rearrangement within the enhanceosome upon Wnt signaling, gaining proximity to TCF, which might trigger enhanceosome switching."

Previous evidence suggested that the sole function of Legless during <i>Drosophila</i> development is to link Pygo to Armadillo (<a href=\"#bib33\">Kramps et al., 2002</a>). However, C-terminal truncations of BCL9/B9L behave as dominant-negatives regarding Wnt responses in mammalian cell lines (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adachi et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">de la Roche et al., 2008</a>), which suggested that their C-termini harbor functionally relevant elements. Indeed, these elements are missing in a Legless truncation encoded by a known <i>lgs</i> mutation (<i>lgs<sup>7I</sup></i>), owing to a stop codon downstream of HD2 (<a href=\"#bib33\">Kramps et al., 2002</a>), yet this truncation should be fully competent to link Pygo to Armadillo. Consistent with the notion of functional elements downstream of HD2, the C-termini of Legless/BCL9 exhibit several conserved sequence blocks, in particular HD3 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) which is found in all orthologs from the most primitive animals to humans.

We also generated a truncation allele (<i>lgs<sup>2-8</sup></i>) that deletes HD3 plus the entire C-terminus (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We isolated fly lines bearing these alleles, and confirmed that they express mutant proteins of the predicted sizes, and at normal levels (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Notably, the <i>lgs<sup>2-8</sup></i> truncation allele causes pupal lethality if combined with a strong <i>lgs</i> allele (<i>lgs<sup>20F</sup></i>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Kramps et al., 2002</a>).

However, the C-terminal truncation mutants of B9L (\u25b3C, \u25b3HD3\u25b3C) failed to do so (despite elevated expression levels in the case of \u25b3HD3\u25b3C), and the HD3 deletion provided only partial rescue activity, similarly to a deletion mutant lacking the HD1 Pygo-binding element (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). This demonstrates the crucial role of the B9L C-terminus for the Wnt response of these cells, and it indicates a functional contribution of HD3 to this response. Restoration of Wnt-responsiveness is also provided by re-expressed BCL9 tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP-BCL9) albeit not by its C-terminal truncation, but we did not analyze this paralog further since its transcriptional activation potential is not as strong as that of the nuclear B9L (<a href=\"#bib15\">de la Roche et al., 2008</a>)."

Since previous attempts based on tandem-affinity pull-down experiments were unsuccessful (M Graeb, PhD thesis), we adopted a proximity-labeling approach called BioID, tagging B9L and BCL9 with BirA* (a promiscuous version of the biotin ligase BirA; <a href=\"#bib54\">Roux et al., 2012</a>) and using these as baits to probe the proteome associated with BCL9/B9L in cells. This method is capable of identifying transient low-affinity ligands of the bait as well as indirect bystanders (that\u00a0is, indirect interactors and \u2018vicinal\u2019 proteins), provided these are within range of the BirA* tag: in the case of Lamin A,\u00a0~50% of the hits were estimated to be within 20\u201330 nm of its BirA* tag (<a href=\"#bib54\">Roux et al., 2012</a>). The upper limit appears to be\u00a0&lt;100 nm, according to BioID studies with Cep250, an extended coiled-coil protein that spans\u00a0~100 nm within the centrosomal complex (as determined by super-resolution microscopy; <a href=\"#bib62\">Sonnen et al., 2012</a>): the C-terminal ligand of Cep250 was only labeled by its C-terminal but not its N-terminal BirA* tag (<a href=\"#bib20\">Firat-Karalar et al., 2014</a>). Therefore, the BioID approach can provide insight into the position and reach of a bait\u2019s BirA* tag within a protein complex. Note that BCL9/B9L is presumed to be an extended protein, with\u00a0&gt;90% of its sequence predicted to be intrinsically unstructured."

Cells were labeled with biotin for 12 hr, with or without stimulation by Wnt3A-conditioned media or 50 mM LiCl (to inhibit glycogen synthase kinase 3, which causes activation of \u03b2-catenin, and thus mimics Wnt stimulation). Lysates were prepared for one-step biotin-avidin affinity purification and subsequent analysis by LC-MS/MS mass spectrometry. Recall that the probability of identifying a hit by this approach (reflected by the total number of unweighted spectral counts derived from this hit) is primarily determined by its proximity to the bait, but is also affected by the strength and duration of their interaction during the labeling period, and by other factors including size and cellular abundance of interactors and suitably exposed biotin-acceptor sites (primary amines)."

Strikingly, each experiment identified known components of the Wnt enhanceosome, even in the absence of Wnt stimulation: we consistently found ARID1A and ARID1B as the top hits, followed closely by TLE3, TLE1, TLE4, LDB1 and PYGO2 and, further down the list, TCF factors, \u03b2-catenin and SSBP3/4 (initially named SSDP1/2; the peptides obtained do not distinguish between these closely related paralogs) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). We also found nine additional subunits of the BAF complex (<a href=\"#bib31\">Kadoch and Crabtree, 2015</a>) on our list, topped by BRG-1/SMARCA4, with only BAF155/SMARCC1, BAF47/SMARCB1, SS18 and BCL7 missing (the latter three likely for technical reasons; <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). This indicates that the fully assembled BAF complex is tethered to the Wnt enhanceosome, presumably through its enhancer-binding Osa/ARID1 subunit which also binds to ChiLS (see Introduction). Furthermore, we found the CBP co-activator and its p300 paralog, as well as DNA-binding proteins of the LHX and GATA families known to tether ChiLS to DNA (<a href=\"#bib36\">Love et al., 2014</a>). Essentially the same set of proteins were found with BCL9-BirA* as a bait, albeit with lower efficiency (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), possibly because of its largely cytoplasmic localization. Indeed, we found several cytoplasmic proteins specifically associated with BCL9 but not B9L, including \u03b1-catenin (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

This method relies on limited crosslinking of proteins in live cells followed by mass spectrometry of peptides cross-linked to the affinity-purified bait, and is thus capable of identifying direct ligands of the bait. It has been extensively validated for hit lists from immunoprecipitation-based approaches obtained for nuclear hormone receptors (for\u00a0example, estrogen receptor) and other DNA-binding proteins (<a href=\"#bib41\">Mohammed et al., 2016</a>).

This implies that BCL9/B9L is associated with the Wnt enhanceosome prior to Wnt stimulation and independently of \u03b2-catenin. We note however that the spectral counts of many hits tend to be slightly increased upon Wnt signaling, a trend that is also apparent for TLE1 and TLE3 whose labeling by B9L-BirA* was increased 2-3x upon Wnt stimulation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>). Similarly, the labeling of GSE1 by B9L-BirA* is increased 3-5x in stimulated cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>): GSE1 is a subunit of the BRAF-HDAC complex (also known as BHC) (<a href=\"#bib25\">Hakimi et al., 2003</a>), which might interact with Groucho/TLE through its HDAC subunit, potentially explaining the Wnt-dependent increase in the labeling of GSE1. In any case, TLE1/3 behaves like the LDB1 core component of the Wnt enhanceosome in remaining associated with Wnt-responsive enhancers even when these are active, consistent with recent findings that TLE1 and \u03b2-catenin can bind simultaneously to TCF1 (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chodaparambil et al., 2014</a>)."

This may also explain why the labeling of CBP and p300 by B9L-BirA* is stimulated\u00a0~4\u20136x upon Wnt stimulation, given that these histone acetyltransferases are known ligands of \u03b2-catenin. However, both proteins exhibit a significant level of labeling even without Wnt signaling, suggesting a constitutive association with the Wnt enhanceosome, consistent with the identification of CBP by RIME as a putative direct ligand of B9L. It thus appears that the binding of CBP and p300 to \u03b2-catenin upon its docking to the Wnt enhanceosome increases their proximity to the C-terminus of BCL9/B9L, which bears the BirA* tag."

TCF4 is the only TCF paralog labeled prior to Wnt signaling, albeit at very low levels (also by the BirA* control), but its labeling by B9L-BirA* or BCL9-BirA* is Wnt-inducible by 13x or 2.5x, respectively. For TCF1/3 and LEF1, no labeling is detectable in unstimulated cells, whereas each of these factors is labeled efficiently upon Wnt signaling (&gt;19\u201330x). The same is true for the APC tumor suppressor (&gt;29x), a BCL9-specific hit that is recruited to TCF target genes upon Wnt signaling by \u03b2-catenin (<a href=\"#bib61\">Sierra et al., 2006</a>), owing to direct high-affinity binding (<a href=\"#bib9\">Choi et al., 2006</a>). Finally, the labeling of SSBP3/4 by B9L-BirA* is moderately increased (&gt;6x) in Wnt-stimulated cells; as in the case of CBP/p300, SSBP3/4 is also detectable prior to Wnt signaling, albeit close to background levels. As far as we know, the expression levels of APC, SSBP3/4 and TCF factors do not change after Wnt stimulation, except for LEF1 whose levels increase\u00a0~2x in Wnt-stimulated HEK293T cells (<a href=\"#bib13\">de la Roche et al., 2014</a>). Therefore, a likely explanation for the Wnt-inducible labeling of these factors is that Wnt signaling, or \u03b2-catenin, induces their proximity to the C-terminus of BCL9/B9L. We note that TCF factors are bound constitutively to their cognate enhancers (for\u00a0example, TCF4 in unstimulated HEK293 cells; <a href=\"#bib22\">Frietze et al., 2012</a>) although, in <i>Drosophila</i>, the association of dTCF with Wg-responsive enhancers appears to be strengthened by Wg signaling (<a href=\"#bib47\">Parker et al., 2008</a>)."

As expected, the two proteins coIP with similar efficiency in cells with or without Wnt stimulation (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Likewise, coIP of GFP-BCL9 with endogenous PYGO2 is also Wnt-independent, whereas its coIP with endogenous \u03b2-catenin (or activated \u03b2-catenin, ABC) is strictly Wnt-inducible, as expected (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). This underscores our notion that the Wnt-inducible labeling of TCF factors by B9L-BirA* and BCL9-BirA* reflects \u03b2-catenin-dependent apposition of the C-terminus of BCL9/B9L to TCF, rather than \u03b2-catenin-dependent recruitment of Legless/BCL9 to TCF (as initially envisaged; <a href=\"#bib33\">Kramps et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">St\u00e4deli and Basler, 2005</a>)."

The homeodomain protein Brinker has been implicated in this process by studies of the Wg-responsive\u00a0<i>Ubx</i>\u00a0midgut\u00a0enhancer in flies, in which the Osa response element maps to the primary Brinker binding site (<a href=\"#bib11\">Collins and Treisman, 2000</a>). Brinker confers repression of this enhancer in response to high Wg signaling levels by binding to the WD40 domain of Groucho, but its repressive activity also requires recruitment of its co-repressor Teashirt, whose expression is locally induced by high levels of signaling emanating from the Wg source\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib55\">Saller et al., 2002</a>).\u00a0Repression of the\u00a0dpp\u00a0leg enhancer near the Wg source in the ventral leg disc also depends on Brinker\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib64\">Theisen et al., 2007</a>).

This apparent \u03b2-catenin-dependent apposition is consistent with structural data showing that BCL9/B9L HD2 is closely apposed to TCF when in a ternary complex with \u03b2-catenin (<a href=\"#bib56\">Sampietro et al., 2006</a>). Our evidence support the notion of Legless/BCL9 acting as an \u2018Armadillo loading factor\u2019, facilitating access of Armadillo/\u03b2-catenin to TCF (<a href=\"#bib12\">de la Roche and Bienz, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Townsley et al., 2004</a>), but argues against the original co-activator hypothesis which posited that Legless/BCL9 is recruited to TCF by Armadillo/\u03b2-catenin exclusively in Wnt-stimulated cells (<a href=\"#bib33\">Kramps et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">St\u00e4deli and Basler, 2005</a>). Whatever the case, the \u03b2-catenin-dependent apposition of the Legless/BCL9 C-terminus to TCF is likely to trigger Wnt enhanceosome switching from OFF to ON, resulting in the relief of Groucho/TLE-dependent repression and culminating in the Wnt-dependent transcriptional activation of linked target genes (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>)."

However, our evidence indicates that CBP/p300 is associated with the Wnt enhanceosome prior to Wnt signaling, possibly via direct binding to B9L as suggested by RIME (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>), and that the docking of Armadillo/\u03b2-catenin to the Wnt enhanceosome strengthens its association with CBP/p300, and/or directs the histone acetyltransferase activity of CBP/p300 towards its substrates, primarily the histone tails. By acetylating these tails, CBP/p300 appears to promote Wnt-dependent transcription in flies and human cells (<a href=\"#bib35\">Li et al., 2007</a>). Indeed, CBP-dependent histone acetylation has been observed at Wg target enhancers in <i>Drosophila</i> although, interestingly, this preceded transcriptional activation (<a href=\"#bib47\">Parker et al., 2008</a>). This is consistent with our BioID data, indicating constitutive association of CBP/p300 with the Wnt enhanceosome."

Indeed, we found HDACs near the bottom of our BioID lists, and one of the top hits identified by B9L was GSE1, a subunit of the BRAF-HDAC complex (<a href=\"#bib25\">Hakimi et al., 2003</a>). However, CBP/p300 also has non-histone substrates within the Wnt enhanceosome, including dTCF in <i>Drosophila</i> whose Armadillo-binding site can be acetylated by dCBP, which thus blocks the binding between the two proteins (<a href=\"#bib71\">Waltzer and Bienz, 1998</a>) and antagonizes Wg responses (<a href=\"#bib35\">Li et al., 2007</a>). It thus regulates Wnt-dependent transcription positively as well as negatively, similarly to Groucho/TLE which not only silences Wnt target genes but also earmarks them for Wnt inducibility, as a core component of the Wnt enhanceosome. It is intriguing that both bimodal regulators are associated constitutively with this complex. A corollary is that the docking of Armadillo/\u03b2-catenin to the Wnt enhanceosome changes their substrate specificities and/or activities."

This complex is highly conserved from yeast to humans, and it contains 15 subunits in human cells (<a href=\"#bib31\">Kadoch and Crabtree, 2015</a>), including the DNA-binding Osa/ARID1 subunit. A wealth of evidence from studies in flies and mammals indicates that this complex primarily antagonizes Polycomb-mediated silencing of genes, most notably of the <i>INK4A</i> locus which encodes an anti-proliferative factor, which could explain why the BAF complex functions as a tumor suppressor in many tissues. However, recall that this complex also specifically antagonizes Armadillo/\u03b2-catenin-mediated transcription (<a href=\"#bib11\">Collins and Treisman, 2000</a>), likely via its BRG/BRM subunit which directly binds to \u03b2-catenin (<a href=\"#bib3\">Barker et al., 2001</a>). Evidence from studies in <i>Drosophila</i> of Wg-responsive enhancers suggests that this complex mediates a negative feedback from high Wg signaling levels near Wg-producing cells which results in re-repression (<a href=\"#bib11\">Collins and Treisman, 2000</a>), imposed by the Brinker homeodomain repressor (<a href=\"#bib55\">Saller et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Waltzer et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Theisen et al., 2007</a>) and its Armadillo-binding Teashirt co-repressor (<a href=\"#bib23\">Gallet et al., 1999</a>) (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The same factors may also instal silencing on Wnt-responsive enhancers upon cessation of Wnt signaling. Notably, mammals do not have a Brinker ortholog, which could explain some of the apparent functional differences between flies and mammals with regard to the BAF complex (<a href=\"#bib31\">Kadoch and Crabtree, 2015</a>). However, the closest mammalian relatives of Teashirt are the Homothorax/MEIS proteins, a family of homeodomain proteins whose expression can be Wnt-inducible (for\u00a0example, <a href=\"#bib74\">Wernet et al., 2014</a>). They are thus candidates for Wnt-induced repressors that confer BAF-dependent feedback inhibition."

However, HEK293 cells are epithelial cells and may thus not express any RUNX factors. In any case, our negative BioID results suggest that RUNX factors function in a hit-and-run fashion.

Indeed, the function of Legless/BCL9 may extend beyond transcriptional Wnt responses, as indicated by the unexpected discovery of its strong association with nuclear co-receptor complexes. Potentially, these associations underlie the observed cross-talk between Wnt/\u03b2-catenin and nuclear hormone receptor signaling, documented extensively in the literature (for\u00a0example, <a href=\"#bib4\">Beildeck et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Mulholland et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Schneider et al., 2014</a>), including evidence for direct activation of the androgen receptor by \u03b2-catenin (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kypta and Waxman, 2012</a>). Furthermore, a strong association between TLE1 and the estrogen receptor has been discovered in breast cancer cells, where TLE1 assists the estrogen receptor in its interaction with chromatin and its proliferation-promoting function (<a href=\"#bib27\">Holmes et al., 2012</a>). This is reminiscent of the role of Groucho/TLE as a cornerstone of the Wnt enhanceosome, proposed to earmark TCF enhancers for subsequent \u03b2-catenin docking and transcriptional Wnt responses (<a href=\"#bib17\">Fiedler et al., 2015</a>). It will be interesting to test experimentally the putative roles of BCL9/B9L and Pygo in enabling cross-talk between \u03b2-catenin and nuclear hormone receptor signaling, both during normal development and in cancer."

Coding sequences for PYGO2, BCL9 and B9L (and mutants thereof) were amplified likewise and inserted directly upstream of BirA* in pcDNA5/FRT/TO using Gibson assembly (<a href=\"#bib24\">Gibson et al., 2009</a>). For each stably transfected BioID cell line, 1.4\u20132.1 \u00d7 10<sup>8</sup> cells were grown adherent to full confluence, washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at \u221280\u00b0C for 1\u201320 days (for further details, see <a href=\"#bib2\">Al-Jassar et al., 2017</a>). BioID pull-downs were then essentially done as described (<a href=\"#bib53\">Roux et al., 2013</a>), and protein was eluted from the beads by boiling for 15 min in LDS sample buffer (ThermoScientific, San Jose CA, USA). RIME pull-downs were essentially done as described (<a href=\"#bib41\">Mohammed et al., 2016</a>), except that 3\u20135 \u00d7 10<sup>7</sup> cells were washed in PBS and incubated for 6 min in 4% methanol-free formaldehyde (Polysciences, Warrington, USA) before lysis and boiling in sample buffer. All samples were resolved on 4\u201312% Bis-Tris polyacrylamide gels (Life Technologies, Carlsbad CA, USA), and gels were stained with Imperial Protein Stain (ThermoScientific, San Jose CA, USA). Gel slices (2\u20133 mm) were prepared for mass spectrometric analysis by manual in situ digestion with trypsin, and digests were analyzed by nano-scale capillary LC-MS/MS using an Ultimate U3000 HPLC (ThermoScientific Dionex, San Jose, USA). The analytical column outlet was directly interfaced via a nano-flow electrospray ionization source, with a hybrid dual pressure linear ion trap mass spectrometer (Orbitrap Velos, ThermoScientific, San Jose, USA). LC-MS/MS data were searched against a protein database (UniProt KB) using the Mascot search engine program (Matrix Science, London, UK).

In a nutshell, our additional work includes (1) in-depth analysis of transcriptional Wg responses in imaginal discs from larvae bearing our <i>lgs</i> truncation allele, (2) comparative BioID for PYGO2 as well as PYGO2 knock-out by CRISPR/Cas9, and (3) coIP assays to complement our evidence from BioID.

For example, we explain that Groucho/TLE is a bimodal regulator, not only conferring silence on the enhanceosome in the absence of signaling, but also earmarking it (together with other core components) for subsequent Wnt induction (Discussion, fifth paragraph): owing to its multivalent interactions with TCF, ChiLS and the Legless/BCL9 C- terminus, Groucho/TLE assumes the role of a cornerstone within the enhanceosome (see our refined model in new <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). As such, it may well be crucial for enhanceosome function (presumably by contributing to assembly and/or cohesion of the complex). It seems plausible that removing one of these interactions (e.g. by deleting its binding site in the Legless/BCL9 C-terminus) would compromise enhanceosome function and attenuate Wnt responses. We also point out in our revised manuscript (Discussion, last paragraph) that this positive role of Groucho/TLE within the Wnt enhanceosome is similar to its positive role in estrogen receptor signaling, as recently discovered by the Carroll group (Holmes et al., 2012): these authors showed that TLE1 promotes the interaction of estrogen receptor with chromatin and facilitates its function in stimulating proliferation of breast cancer cells."

However, HEK293 cells are epithelial cells, and our data from BioID and Wnt reporter assays clearly show that the Wnt enhanceosome is fully functional in these cells without RUNX (indeed, we could not find any evidence for RUNX protein expression in these cells). A corollary is that RUNX functions in a hit-and-run fashion, to help set up the Wnt enhanceosome on Wnt-responsive enhancers in uncommitted cell lineages; however, once assembled (e.g. in epithelial cells), RUNX is no longer required for enhanceosome- mediated ON/OFF switching.

We now provide two new strands of evidence to support this notion: firstly, we use coIP assays to show that the association of BCL9/B9L with TCF is similarly stable before and after Wnt stimulation, like its association with Pygo, while its association with \u03b2-catenin depends on Wnt stimulation (new <a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3A, B</a>). Secondly, we have conducted BioID with PYGO2-BirA* under identical conditions (new <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>), which revealed no new <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a> significant change in the labeling of TCF factors by this bait (), in contrast to the labeling of TCF factors by the BCL9/B9L baits which is strongly Wnt- inducible, especially in the case of B9L-BirA* (13-30x; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A, B</a>).

Unfortunately, the Groucho antiserum previously used for ChIP (e.g. by the Jennings group) and initially produced by Kharchenko et al. (2011) is no longer available. However, this notion of competition between Groucho/TLE and Armadillo/\u03b2-catenin was seriously challenged recently by the discovery of Weis and Waterman and co-workers that TLE and \u03b2-catenin can bind to TCF simultaneously (Chodaparambil et al., 2014), as we point out in our Introduction."

They went one step further and combined BioID and spectral counting as a (semi) quantitative measurement for determination of protein interactions with and without Wnt. It is not clear to me whether these methods offer reliable quantification. For example, spectral counts for LDB1 and SSDP in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a> appear to contradict the IP results in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>, in particular with regard to the HD1 deletion mutant. It would be highly desirable that additional approaches can back up these arguments (derived from BioID).</i>"

We have added an introductory paragraph on BioID (subsection \u201cB9L and BCL9 are constitutively associated with the Wnt enhanceosome\u201d, first paragraph), explaining how the spectral counts obtained by this approach can be taken as (semi)quantitative measurements of proximity, which can provide insight into the spatial organization of large protein complexes. This was demonstrated in the original Roux et al. (2012) paper by comparing biotin labeling efficiencies of interactors of Laminin A tagged with N-terminal or C-terminal BirA*. Proximity-dependent labeling efficiencies have since been documented by others, and we cite a compelling example of BioID data obtained by the Stearns group on components of the human centrosomal complex (Firat-Karalar et al., 2014). In the same paragraph, we also mention other factors that can affect the efficiency of biotin labeling by the bait, but these are less relevant for the comparison of hits obtained under different conditions (with or without Wnt), or of hits labeled by different baits under the same conditions (BCL9/B9L versus PYGO2)."
