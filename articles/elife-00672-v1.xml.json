                    "text": "Eukarya, Archaea, and some Bacteria encode all or part of the essential mevalonate (MVA) metabolic pathway clinically modulated using statins. Curiously, two components of the MVA pathway are often absent from archaeal genomes. The search for these missing elements led to the discovery of isopentenyl phosphate kinase (IPK), one of two activities necessary to furnish the universal five-carbon isoprenoid building block, isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP). Unexpectedly, we now report functional IPKs also exist in Bacteria and Eukarya. Furthermore, amongst a subset of species within the bacterial phylum Chloroflexi, we identified a new enzyme catalyzing the missing decarboxylative step of the putative alternative MVA pathway. These results demonstrate, for the first time, a functioning alternative MVA pathway. Key to this pathway is the catalytic actions of a newly uncovered enzyme, mevalonate phosphate decarboxylase (MPD) and IPK. Together, these two discoveries suggest that unforeseen variation in isoprenoid metabolism may be widespread in nature."

Curiously, two components of the MVA pathway are often absent from archaeal genomes. The search for these missing elements led to the discovery of isopentenyl phosphate kinase (IPK), one of two activities necessary to furnish the universal five-carbon isoprenoid building block, isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP). Unexpectedly, we now report functional IPKs also exist in Bacteria and Eukarya. Furthermore, amongst a subset of species within the bacterial phylum Chloroflexi, we identified a new enzyme catalyzing the missing decarboxylative step of the putative alternative MVA pathway. These results demonstrate, for the first time, a functioning alternative MVA pathway. Key to this pathway is the catalytic actions of a newly uncovered enzyme, mevalonate phosphate decarboxylase (MPD) and IPK. Together, these two discoveries suggest that unforeseen variation in isoprenoid metabolism may be widespread in nature."

Moreover, Dellas et al. show that Green non-sulphur bacteria, and some eukaryotes, also have functional IPK enzymes. This means that IPK has now unexpectedly been observed in all three domains of life, and hints at another target to medically control mevalonate pathways. The discovery of the missing enzyme in the alternative pathway opens the door to the re-examination of many other living things, to find which have the new pathway and to work out why."

This observation is puzzling due to the essentiality of isoprenoid compounds in all organisms. Recent phylogenetic and experimental data suggest that Archaea (and probably also the Chloroflexi) encode an alternative MVA pathway, which bifurcates from the classical pathway following the phosphorylation of mevalonate to phosphomevalonate (MVAP, also known as mevalonate 5-phosphate, <b>3</b>) (<a href=\"#bib17\">Grochowski et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Matsumi et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Miziorko, 2010</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>).

As photoheterotrophs, Chloroflexi use light for energy but cannot fix carbon dioxide as their primary source of carbon (<a href=\"#bib9\">Bryant and Frigaard, 2006</a>). Of the six bacterial phyla reported to contain MVA pathway-bearing organisms, only the Chloroflexi contain IPK (<a href=\"#bib28\">Lombard and Moreira, 2011</a>), but lack an obvious PMK. Although it appears from genome annotations that the Chloroflexi encode two incomplete branches of the essential MVA metabolic pathway, we demonstrate in one Chlorflexi bacterium that this MDD-like enzyme in fact acts catalytically as a bona fide MPD. MPD and IPK from this Chloroflexi bacterium, <i>R. castenholzii</i>, complete the assembly of a hitherto unforeseen alternative MVA pathway that catalyzes sequential MVAP (<b>3</b>) decarboxylation and IP (<b>4</b>) phosphorylation resulting in the central hub metabolite of all organisms, the five-carbon isoprenoid building block IPP (<b>1</b>)."

On the other hand, archaeal MDDs from Haloarchaea and Thermoplasmata contain MPD-like active site residues associated with MVAP (<b>3</b>) binding and turnover and their protein sequences cluster with the MPD from Chloroflexi (<a href=\"#tbl4\">Table 4</a>) (<a href=\"#bib28\">Lombard and Moreira, 2011</a>). These MDDs belong to two archaeal classes that encode IPK but are missing PMK, suggesting that they also use this metabolic assembly of the alternative MVA pathway. The correlation between unique active site residues and alteration in substrate preference, MVAP (<b>3</b>) over MVAPP (<b>5</b>), among MPDs from Chloroflexi bacteria, reflects a lineage specific adaptation that allows for the utilization of the alternative MVA pathway; this adaptation may also apply to MPD-like MDDs of the archaeal phyla Haloarchaea and Thermoplasmata but awaits experimental verification currently in progress."

Unexpectedly, this <i>R. castenholzii</i> gene, which is annotated as an \u2018MDD\u2019, catalyzes the phosphorylation-dependent decarboxylation of MVAP (<b>3</b>), thus serving as a long sought MPD requiring functional re-annotation in <i>R. castenholzii</i> and most likely the additional Chloroflexi species noted previously. It is possible that this enzyme has only recently emerged and undergone neofunctionaliation to acquire MPD activity from an MDD ancestor within the larger phylum of Chloroflexi heterotrophic photosynthetic bacteria. The emergence of this MPD activity may have also coincided with the loss of the <i>PMK</i> gene from species within the narrower Chloroflexi class and/or acquisition of an <i>IPK</i> gene. Selection for such an alternative metabolic route to the core isoprenoid building block IPP may be due, in part, to a higher demand for metabolic flux through an alternative set of enzymes associated with the Chloroflexi MVA pathway. Indeed, the Chloroflexi class of bacteria appear to possess an expanded repertoire of downstream enzymes of isoprenoid metabolism suggesting a high demand for isoprenoid metabolites (<a href=\"http://www.genome.jp/kegg-bin/show_pathway?map00900\">http://www.genome.jp/kegg-bin/show_pathway?map00900</a>)."

One candidate gene previously suggested to encode this decarboxylation activity is a gene encoding a dioxygenase-like protein that resides within the MVA operon in most Archaea (MJ0403 in <i>M. jannaschii</i>) (<a href=\"#bib17\">Grochowski et al., 2006</a>).

Since many eukaryotes encode putative enzymes of unknown function, they may also encode a cryptic MPD that would serve in an alternative biosynthetic route to IPP (<b>1</b>). All IPKs tested thus far were fully functional, demonstrating that true IPKs persist across most eukaryotic lineages, while some have been lost during rare evolutionary events, probably due to partial redundancy with the MVA pathway. The unusual phylogeny of IPK coupled with its membership in a family of kinases that phosphorylate such a broad range of substrates leave open the possibility that IPK may assume varied physiological roles, including phosphorylation of an IP-like substrate, IP recycling, and/or most notably, access to a pool of IPP through IP-IPP homeostatic control."

Additionally, the 9-His tag was removed from <i>R. castenholzii</i> MPD with thrombin for kinetic assays. MPD was then further purified by anion exchange on a Mono Q column (GE healthcare, Wauwatosa, WI) with a linear gradient of 0 M\u20131 M NaCl in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, over 40 column volumes and ultimately by size exclusion chromatography on Superdex 200 column (GE healthcare) developed in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 M NaCl and 1 mM DTT."

The authors determine that Chloroflexi possess an enzyme originally predicted based on sequence homology to be a mevalonate 5-diphosphate decarboxylase (MDD) that instead decarboxylates mevalonate 5-phosphate. This finding, combined with the existence of an isopentenyl phosphate kinase (IPK), establishes a complete mevalonate pathway in Chloroflexi. The authors proceed to make a convincing argument for discrete changes in the active site of the Chloroflexi decarboxylase that may account for the substrate switch from MVAPP to MVAP. The results reported in this manuscript certainly enrich our understanding of the phylogenetic diversity of mevalonate pathways, but this reviewer was not convinced that the findings are particularly surprising. The \u201cenzyme repurposing\u201c discovered by the authors appears to reflect a rather simple tweak in substrate scope for the decarboxylase enzyme (i.e., MVAPP and MVAP only differ by a single phosphate group, so is it really unexpected that certain MDD-like enzymes might have evolved to switch substrate preference to MVAP over MVAPP?). Furthermore, as the authors note, there is already quite a bit of emerging literature on the general topic of diversification of mevalonate pathways, so this reviewer had difficulty judging the actual impact of the current manuscript. It is a solid and well-executed contribution, but appears to fall short of the high-impact study intended for a general readership journal like <i>eLife</i>."

The \u201cusual\u201c pathway involves phosphorylation of mevalonate phosphate (MVAP) to the diphosphate (MVAPP) that then undergoes decarboxylation to IPP. However, in some organisms the kinase is \u201cmissing\u201c; instead a kinase that phosphorylates isopentenyl phosphate (IP) could be identified. This suggested that these organisms would also have MVAP decarboxylase, producing IP that then is phosphorylated."

These findings indicate the possibility of an exciting and novel alternative mevalonate-dependent biosynthetic route to isoprenoids, through MPD and IPK, rather than PMK and MDD. The authors used bioinformatic algorithms to identify IPK homologs (with a conserved active-site histidine), scattered throughout the domains of life (including animals). The authors purified 7 of these IPKS (one previously characterized homolog and 6 new) and confirmed their predicted enzymatic activity. The authors then enzymatically characterized PMKs and MDDs from organisms that had active IPKs. They found that one of the purified MDD homologues (from <i>R. castenholzii</i>) does not have MDD activity, but instead possesses an MPD activity in vitro. Single-pot multi-enzyme assays confirm the ability of these enzymes to synthesize isoprenoids. Not unexpectedly, the MDD-like RcMPD has amino acid changes and predicted structural changes from canonical MDDs that may explain a change in substrate specificity."

The authors determine that Chloroflexi possess an enzyme originally predicted based on sequence homology to be a mevalonate 5-diphosphate decarboxylase (MDD) that instead decarboxylates mevalonate 5-phosphate. This finding, combined with the existence of an isopentenyl phosphate kinase (IPK), establishes a complete mevalonate pathway in Chloroflexi. The authors proceed to make a convincing argument for discrete changes in the active site of the Chloroflexi decarboxylase that may account for the substrate switch from MVAPP to MVAP. The results reported in this manuscript certainly enrich our understanding of the phylogenetic diversity of mevalonate pathways, but this reviewer was not convinced that the findings are particularly surprising. The \u201cenzyme repurposing\u201c discovered by the authors appears to reflect a rather simple tweak in substrate scope for the decarboxylase enzyme (i.e., MVAPP and MVAP only differ by a single phosphate group, so is it really unexpected that certain MDD-like enzymes might have evolved to switch substrate preference to MVAP over MVAPP?). Furthermore, as the authors note, there is already quite a bit of emerging literature on the general topic of diversification of mevalonate pathways, so this reviewer had difficulty judging the actual impact of the current manuscript. It is a solid and well-executed contribution, but appears to fall short of the high-impact study intended for a general readership journal like</i> eLife<i>.</i>"

Clearly, the simplicity of the explanation strongly suggests that the decarboxylase in question, annotated as MVAPP decarboxylases (MDDs) in all available genome and transcriptome sequences requires both computational re-examination, and even more importantly, functional examination. Given the response of the audience at the recent international meeting on isoprenoid biology and metabolism where I (Noel) presented the results, many labs are already rethinking the currently accepted view of the mevalonate pathway, not only in Archaea where an alternative pathway was originally suggested to exist, but in all three domains of life. I would like to emphasize that the simplicity of this explanation of gene and enzyme neofunctionalization (or repurposing) is wholly unexpected and one of the major breakthroughs in the current submission."

These latter studies will provide a paper of record documenting a more detailed set of numbers for all the reactions. We feel that these studies are again beyond the scope of the current paper as this paper reports for the first time two major findings for the metabolism field: the presence of IPK-like activity across all three domains of life, and the first discovery and reconstitution of an alternative mevalonate pathway in vitro. Leaders in the field including Michel Rohmer (see above) have seen the results presented by Noel, and also have read the paper. Without bias or prejudice concerning our paper, all were shocked the original submission received a very lukewarm reception, particularly the suggestion that the combination of deep phylogenetic analyses coupled with quantitative in vitro kinetic analyses and reconstitution assays was not of high scientific impact."

In addition, Thermofluor stability assays demonstrate that recombinant MPD is extremely thermostable (expected as the Chloroflexi host lives optimally in hot springs at or slightly above the boiling point of water) with midpoint melting temperatures (Tm) above 90\u00b0C. Due to the low in vitro stability of components of the pyruvate kinases/lactate dehydrogenase assay and instrument limitations, <i>R. castenholzii</i> MPD could not be assayed at temperatures equivalent to the optimal growth conditions of the Chloroflexi host. We fully expect that the enzyme will perform more efficiently at temperatures approaching 100\u00b0C as observed for many enzymes from thermophilic organisms compared to their mesophilic counterparts. Unfortunately, the class of Chloroflexi in which new decarboxylase activity has been found are currently recalcitrant to genetic manipulation and difficult to grow in the laboratory without specialized fermentation systems. In the current revised manuscript, we now include the revised kinetic data along with a description of the assay for thermostability."

We still include the biochemical results of in vitro IPK activity that is on par with previously measured activities in Archaea. However, we have significantly shortened and revised the current manuscript to focus attention on the major new quantitative discovery, the first characterization of a complete alternative MVA pathway through a newly discovered neofunctionalized mevalonate diphosphate decarboxylase to a mevalonate phosphate decarboxylase."

Notably, using a series of knockouts and transient overexpression lines in the reference plants <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> and <i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>, we have accumulated preliminary evidence of a significant positive correlation between the expression of IPK activity in planta and 2-5-fold increases in plant sterol and sesquiterpene production. While these latter studies are still in progress and extend beyond the scope of the current manuscript, they lend further support for the unexpected discovery of alternative routes in plants for modulating economically important isoprenoid production through plant IPK activity."
