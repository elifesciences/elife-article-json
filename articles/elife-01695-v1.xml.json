We show here that PP2A-B55 is the enzyme responsible for dephosphorylating pEndos during M phase exit. The kinetic parameters for PP2A-B55\u2019s action on pEndos are orders of magnitude lower than those for CDK-phosphorylated substrates, suggesting a simple model for PP2A-B55 regulation that we call inhibition by unfair competition. As the name suggests, during M phase PP2A-B55\u2019s attention is diverted to pEndos, which binds much more avidly and is dephosphorylated more slowly than other substrates. When Gwl is inactivated during the M phase-to-interphase transition, the dynamic balance changes: pEndos dephosphorylated by PP2A-B55 cannot be replaced, so the phosphatase can refocus its attention on CDK-phosphorylated substrates. This mechanism explains simultaneously how PP2A-B55 and Gwl together regulate pEndos, and how pEndos controls PP2A-B55."

We show here that PP2A-B55 is the enzyme responsible for dephosphorylating pEndos during M phase exit. The kinetic parameters for PP2A-B55\u2019s action on pEndos are orders of magnitude lower than those for CDK-phosphorylated substrates, suggesting a simple model for PP2A-B55 regulation that we call inhibition by unfair competition. As the name suggests, during M phase PP2A-B55\u2019s attention is diverted to pEndos, which binds much more avidly and is dephosphorylated more slowly than other substrates. When Gwl is inactivated during the M phase-to-interphase transition, the dynamic balance changes: pEndos dephosphorylated by PP2A-B55 cannot be replaced, so the phosphatase can refocus its attention on CDK-phosphorylated substrates. This mechanism explains simultaneously how PP2A-B55 and Gwl together regulate pEndos, and how pEndos controls PP2A-B55."

The second basis for this mechanism is that PP2A-B55 can also slowly remove the phosphate groups from Endosulfine molecules bound at the active site. In other words, phosphorylated Endosulfine works as an inhibitor only because it is really a substrate with special properties. It binds very tightly to the active site, where it is destroyed very slowly. For this reason, Williams et al. have named the process inhibition by unfair competition."

Many of these sites are substrates of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), most notably MPF (M phase-promoting factor; CDK1-Cyclin B). CDK phosphosites are \u2018proline-directed\u2019, being phosphorylated at serine or threonine followed by proline (<a href=\"#bib62\">Nigg, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Holmes and Solomon, 1996</a>). These M phase-specific phosphorylations must eventually be removed so that mitotic/meiotic cells can reset to interphase. PP2A-B55 (heterotrimeric protein phosphatase 2A composed of a catalytic C subunit, a structural A subunit, and a B55-type regulatory subunit) is the phosphatase responsible for removing many key CDK-generated phosphorylations at the conclusion of M phase (<a href=\"#bib12\">Clarke et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Mayer-Jaekel et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Mochida and Hunt, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Castilho et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Mochida et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Schmitz et al., 2010</a>)."

Indeed, a regulatory module that turns off PP2A-B55 specifically during M phase has recently been characterized (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). In brief, MPF phosphorylates and thereby activates the Greatwall kinase (Gwl) (<a href=\"#bib96\">Yu et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Blake-Hodek et al., 2012</a>). Activated Gwl phosphorylates small proteins of the Endosulfine family (Endos; [<a href=\"#bib23\">Gharbi-Ayachi et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Mochida et al., 2010</a>]) at a unique, highly conserved site. Gwl-phosphorylated Endos (pEndos) binds to and inactivates PP2A-B55, thus protecting a major class of CDK-governed phosphorylations from premature removal during M phase (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib24\">Glover, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Lorca and Castro, 2012</a>, <a href=\"#bib50\">2013</a> and <a href=\"#bib33\">Hunt, 2013</a>).

When activated (in part through a feed-forward autoregulatory loop involving the kinases Myt1 and Wee1 and the phosphatase Cdc25; not shown), MPF phosphorylates many substrates (CDKSs) that play key roles in M phase events. One such MPF substrate is the kinase Greatwall (Gwl), which in its active form phosphorylates Endosulfine (Endos). Phosphorylated Endos binds to and inhibits the phosphatase PP2A-B55. This inhibition protects MPF substrates, including components of the autoregulatory loop, from premature dephosphorylation during M phase entry. During M phase exit, MPF is inactivated by degradation of its Cyclin B component (not shown), and PP2A-B55 becomes reactivated to dephosphorylate many MPF substrates. M phase exit also requires the dephosphorylation and inactivation of both Gwl and Endos. Here, we show that PP2A-B55 catalyzes Endos dephosphorylation. The activities responsible for the inactivation of Gwl currently remain unknown."

Not only must CDK-dependent phosphorylations be removed by newly reactivated PP2A-B55, but also Gwl and pEndos must be inactivated at the end of M phase by the removal of their stimulatory phosphorylations (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). If Gwl were to remain active, it would continually keep Endos phosphorylated; PP2A-B55 would stay inactive and the system would remain in M phase because mitotic phosphorylations could not be removed. On the other hand, if Gwl alone were inactivated but pEndos were to stay phosphorylated, M phase would again be maintained. We focus here on the second part of this equation by identifying the phosphatase that dephosphorylates and turns off pEndos."

Not only is the Gwl-phosphorylated pEndos site not proline-directed, as are CDK targets, but also a system based only on PP2A-B55 would be closed and futile: if PP2A-B55 is inactive during M phase, how could this \u2018dead\u2018 enzyme turn itself back on? Clearly, the \u2018anti-Endos\u2019 phosphatase(s) targeting Gwl-phosphorylated pEndos must instead be active during at least late M phase. As we will show, the expectation that anti-Endos is active during M phase has been borne out. However, counterintuitively, we found that almost all of this anti-Endos activity is contributed by PP2A-B55. This surprising conclusion is made possible because the kinetic parameters of this enzyme for pEndos and for CDK-phosphorylated substrates are very different. Based on this divergence, we suggest a straightforward mechanism we call \u2018inhibition by unfair competition\u2019 that explains how pEndos acts both as an inhibitor and a substrate of PP2A-B55, and how this phosphatase can simultaneously be \u2018on\u2019 for some substrates but \u2018off\u2019 for others. This mechanism may have broad implications for the control of other cellular protein phosphatases."

This question could be addressed readily using extracts of <i>Xenopus</i> eggs, which are prepared in an M phase state but can be induced to exit M phase by addition of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<a href=\"#bib60\">Murray and Kirschner, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Murray, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Tunquist and Maller, 2003</a>). <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a> shows that in accordance with this prediction, considerable anti-Endos activity is indeed seen during M phase. The level is roughly half that seen in interphase; as will be explained below, we believe this difference results from competition between exogenous radiolabeled pEndos and endogenous unlabeled pEndos present in M phase but not interphase. As expected from previous studies (<a href=\"#bib54\">Mochida and Hunt, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Castilho et al., 2009</a>), anti-CDKS activity (i.e., PP2A-B55) was completely blocked in M phase extracts and strongly induced by treatment with Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>)."

This result is surprising because we had not anticipated the existence of a PPP family phosphatase more tautomycetin-resistant than PP2A-B55.

First, extracts from larvae mutant for <i>PP1-96A</i> displayed only about half the level of phosphatase activities measured with all three substrates. This is probably a systematic error caused by the <i>ebony</i> mutation in these animals, producing a dark pigment that caused an overestimation of the amount of total protein concentration. Second, the lower level of activity against Histone H1v1.0 in animals mutant for <i>PP1-87B</i> (the predominant PP1 catalytic subunit in <i>Drosophila</i>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Dombradi et al., 1990</a>) is likely caused by the targeting of this substrate by the PP1-87B phosphatase.

Final preparations were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by silver staining (top panel) and by Western blot (bottom panels). The major visible components in the silver staining are the A and C subunits of PP2A, the FLAG-tagged regulatory subunit whose expression construct was originally transfected (B55\u03b1, B55\u03b4, or B56\u03b2), and bovine serum albumin (BSA) added to stabilize the purified enzymes. An additional band of variable intensity located between the B55 and C bands, which is also seen in the vector alone control lane, was identified by mass spectrometry as keratin; yet another weak band seen in some preparations that migrates just faster than B55\u03b1/\u03b4 appears to be immunoglobulin heavy chain from the anti-FLAG column. At the right is a sample of commercially obtained A\u2013C heterodimer (Millipore 14-111)."

In each case, the discrepancy is explained by careful quantitative attention to the relationship between the <i>K</i><sub><i>i</i></sub> of the inhibitor and the <i>K</i><sub><i>m</i></sub> of the target: roughly speaking, an inhibitor will be effective only if its <i>K</i><sub><i>i</i></sub> is less than the <i>K</i><sub><i>m</i></sub> for the substrate. Thus, as was seen in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>, tautomycetin, which has an IC<sub>50</sub> (which provides a very rough estimate of <i>K</i><sub><i>i</i></sub>) of 62 nM (<a href=\"#bib53\">Mitsuhashi et al., 2001</a>), effectively inhibits PP2A-B55 dephosphorylation of pCDKS (<i>K</i><sub><i>m</i></sub> \u223c 90 \u03bcM, <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>), but only weakly inhibits PP2A-B55 dephosphorylation of pEndos (<i>K</i><sub><i>m</i></sub> \u223c 1 nM, <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). The same consideration explains the difference in inhibition by the <i>Drosophila</i> S68 Endos phosphomimetic protein, whose IC<sub>50</sub> (approximately 500 nM from <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>) is again intermediate between that for dephosphorylation of pEndos and pCDKS. Although the identity of the inhibitor(s) present in extracts that presumably underlie the dilution effects seen in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a> are unknown, the different sensitivities of anti-Endos and anti-CDK to extract dilution can be rationalized if the inhibitors\u2019 <i>K</i><sub><i>i</i></sub> values are intermediate between the <i>K</i><sub><i>m</i></sub>\u2019s of pEndos and pCDKS."

Our results provide no indication that pEndos inhibits PP2A-B55 by binding to a second, allosteric site separate from the active site at which it is dephosphorylated. Such allosteric down-regulation would cause the rate of pEndos dephosphorylation to decrease when the substrate is added at very high concentrations, but this is not the case (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). Furthermore, the different responses of purified PP2A-B55\u2019s anti-Endos and anti-CDKS activities to the addition of phosphomimetic <i>Drosophila</i> Endos (S68D in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>) also argue strongly against inhibition at an allosteric site. If pEndos inhibited PP2A-B55 by binding to a site other than the active site, phosphomimetic Endos would have been expected to inhibit the dephosphorylations of pEndos and pCDKS at identical concentrations, and this is clearly not the case."

We assayed the response of PP2A-B55\u2019s anti-CDKS activity to increasing concentrations of either unphosphorylated Endos or Endos previously thiophosphorylated by Gwl kinase; the incorporated thiophosphate cannot be removed by this enzyme (<a href=\"#bib58\">Morgan et al., 1976</a>, and data not shown). The IC<sub>50</sub> of thiophosphorylated Endos determined in this way was 197 \u00b1 14 pM; by comparison, the IC<sub>50</sub> of nonphosphorylated Endos was measured to be 566 \u00b1 65 nM. Thus, the (thio)phosphorylation of Endos increases its binding affinity for PP2A-B55 about 3000-fold. Although these data do not preclude the existence of interactions outside of the active site and involving regions of Endos distant from the Gwl-phosphorylated site, it is clear that most of the binding is dictated by insertion of the phosphorylated residue into the active site, where it can then be dephosphorylated.

Thiophosphorylation by Gwl kinase makes Endos into a much stronger inhibitor of PP2A-B55 than unphosphorylated Endos; the affinity of thiophosphorylated Endos is only about twofold lower than that of okadaic acid. Non-radioactive pEndos is a less efficient inhibitor of PP2A-B55 than is thiophosphorylated Endos because the enzyme dephosphorylates pEndos during the course of incubation; the longer pEndos is exposed to the enzyme, the higher is the concentration of pEndos required to achieve the same degree of inhibition. For all points shown, <i>n</i> = 3 technical replicates. (<b>B</b>) Direct demonstration of the automatic reset mechanism that allows PP2A-B55 reactivation upon anaphase onset. PP2A-B55 at 0.25 nM was mixed together on ice with buffer in the absence of Endos (control) or in the presence of 16 nM unlabeled Gwl-phosphorylated Endos or Gwl-thiophosphorylated Endos and incubated on ice for 5 min; radioactive pCDKS substrate was then added to a final concentration of 0.47 \u03bcM; and the reaction was then transferred to 30\u00b0C at <i>t</i> = 0 and aliquots assayed for the release of <sup>32</sup>P from the pCDKS substrate. Each point represents the average of three technical replicates (<i>n = 3</i>) with standard deviations shown. The dephosphorylation of pCDKS is suppressed until the majority of pEndos is inactivated by PP2A-B55-mediated dephosphorylation. (The gradual decrease in the slopes of the control and pEndos-added curves is probably due to instability and/or degradation of the PP2A-B55 during the extended time-course.)

By dephosphorylating pEndos inhibitor that can no longer be replenished once Gwl is inactivated, PP2A-B55 is now freed to recognize its normal, CDK-phosphorylated substrates. We tested this idea by setting up an in vitro analog of this aspect of M phase exit. We added varying amounts of non-radioactive pEndos to PP2A-B55, and monitored the enzyme\u2019s ability to dephosphorylate radioactive pCDKS added at the same time. The results, shown in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>, show clearly that pEndos indeed inhibits PP2A-B55-mediated pCDKS dephosphorylation. Much higher concentrations of pEndos than thiophosphorylated Endos are needed to achieve the same degree of inhibition, which is to be expected if pEndos is being inactivated during the incubation. As the time of incubation increases, PP2A-B55 consumes more pEndos, so even higher concentrations of pEndos are required for the same amount of inhibition. Comparing the effects of pEndos inhibition after 30- and 120-min incubations demonstrates that PP2A-B55 cannot recognize the pCDKS substrate until the majority of the pEndos in the same tube has been dephosphorylated. We estimate that the <i>k</i><sub><i>cat</i></sub> for the dephosphorylation of pEndos in these reactions is between 0.03 and 0.12 s<sup>\u22121</sup>, consistent with the range previously determined in <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>."

The time courses of pCDKS dephosphorylation, assayed by <sup>32</sup>P release, were then measured. A clear delay in pCDKS dephosphorylation of roughly 35 min is visible in the sample containing pEndos, after which the rate of the reaction approaches the initial rate observed in the absence of Endos inhibitors.

We believe that this possibility is extremely remote for several reasons. (i) As discussed below, the inhibition by unfair competition mechanism we propose is sufficiently fast to account for the observed rapidity of M phase exit. (ii) The characteristics of the M phase and interphase anti-Endos activities measured in <i>Xenopus</i> egg extracts are very similar (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplements 1C and 2A</a>); PP2A-B55\u2019s ability to dephosphorylate pEndos is therefore constitutive with respect to the cell cycle (see also <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). (iii) Because of its extremely low <i>K</i><sub><i>m</i></sub>, pEndos is so tightly bound to PP2A-B55 during M phase that no other hypothetical phosphatase would be able to inactivate it in a reasonable time frame; the theoretical simulation in <a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a> below illustrates this point.

At high pEndos concentrations above the intracellular concentration of PP2A-B55, PPX could dephosphorylate the excess pEndos that was not bound to PP2A-B55. However, this dephosphorylation would have little regulatory consequence: as soon as the pEndos concentration is reduced to the intracellular concentration of PP2A-B55, the remaining pEndos would be protected from dephosphorylation by PPX due to the very tight (nanomolar or subnanomolar) binding of pEndos to PP2A-B55.

We believe their report is incorrect for several reasons. (i) We show here strong evidence that PP2A-B55 is responsible for the anti-Endos activity. Furthermore, <a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10C,D</a> demonstrates that the very tight binding of pEndos to the PP2A-B55 active site blocks its binding to other phosphatases. No other normal-binding phosphatase could contribute to pEndos inactivation rapidly enough to account for the timing of M phase exit. (ii) Among other issues, this new publication is internally inconsistent. The authors show that the anti-Endos activity they ascribe to Fcp1 is okadaic acid sensitive (supplemental Figure S3 in reference <a href=\"#bib30\">Hegarat et al., 2014</a>), yet the literature contains many reports that Fcp1 is completely resistant to okadaic acid (e.g., <a href=\"#bib64\">Palancade et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib89\">Washington et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Kong et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib85\">Visconti et al., 2012</a>), a fact that we verify in our <a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11E</a>."

In essence, pEndos competes with a large class of CDK-catalyzed mitotic phosphosites (of which pCDKS and pSer50 Fizzy are examples) for access to the phosphatase active site. pEndos can successfully compete for the site because its affinity for PP2A-B55 is much higher than those of the competing substrates; that is, the <i>K</i><sub><i>m</i></sub> for pEndos is extremely low. However, PP2A-B55 dephosphorylates pEndos at a much slower rate (low <i>k</i><sub><i>cat</i></sub>) than the CDK phosphosites, so the tight interaction of PP2A-B55 and pEndos would be prolonged. Thus, pEndos would soon sequester the phosphatase from competing substrates, protecting such substrates against premature dephosphorylation. pEndos in this way permits M phase to begin and to be maintained as long as Gwl kinase is active. We call this mechanism \u2018inhibition by unfair competition\u2019<i>.</i> In its essence, the model shown in <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a> clarifies how PP2A-B55 can be \u2018off\u2019 during M phase for CDK-phosphorylated substrates, but \u2018on\u2019 at the same time for the Gwl-phosphorylated pEndos substrate."

Considerable evidence exists that this requirement is met in many cell types. From our own quantitation on Western blots, we estimate the intracellular concentration of the PP2A B55 subunit to be between 100 and 250 nM and that of Endos to be between 500 nM and 1 \u03bc\u039c, depending on the cell type. (One example of this analysis is seen in <a href=\"#fig2s6\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 6</a>). The 5:1 ratio of Endos to PP2A-B55 observed in that figure is roughly consistent with estimates from other laboratories (<a href=\"#bib15\">Cundell et al., 2013</a>) and with estimates from mass spectrometry studies of whole cell extracts, after accounting for all Endos and PP2A-B55 family members (<a href=\"#bib7\">Brunner et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Beck et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Kolker et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib88\">Wang et al., 2012</a>). For example, the Pax-DB database integrating the results of many mass spectrometry experiments on a variety of tissue types estimates that the abundance of Endos in <i>Drosophila</i> cells is 295 ppm while that of Twins (B55) is 123 ppm; for human cells, the integrated datasets yield values of 83.2 ppm for Endos-family proteins (ENSA and ARPP-19) and 23.1 ppm for B55-family proteins (<a href=\"http://www.pax-db.org\">www.pax-db.org</a>; <a href=\"#bib88\">Wang et al., 2012</a>). Although we ourselves have not determined the fraction of the total Endos protein that is phosphorylated during M phase, other investigators have found that this proportion is roughly 50% in extracts of synchronized mammalian tissue culture cells (perhaps some of which may not have been in M phase) (<a href=\"#bib15\">Cundell et al., 2013</a>), and approaches 100% in frog egg M phase extracts (<a href=\"#bib56\">Mochida et al., 2010</a>). Sufficient \u2018headroom\u2019 thus exists to conclude that the molar concentration of pEndos during M phase in fact exceeds that of the PP2A-B55 phosphatase."

When Gwl is inactivated at anaphase onset, the pEndos dephosphorylated by PP2A-B55 can no longer be replaced.

The experiments presented in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>, in which we added non-radioactive pEndos and radioactive pCDKS to the same tube of PP2A-B55, provide a direct in vitro test of the proposed mechanism by mimicking the events that occur during M phase exit. The results show that PP2A-B55 targets pCDKS only after the enzyme has dephosphorylated almost all of the pEndos."

Even though the turnover rate of pEndos dephosphorylation by PP2A-B55 is quite slow (\u223c0.05 s<sup>\u22121</sup>), the inhibition by unfair competition mechanism is nevertheless compatible with the rapidity of M phase exit. The reason is that Endos is present in cells only in at most a fivefold stoichiometric excess with respect to the phosphatase, as was just discussed. Each molecule of PP2A-B55 thus needs to dephosphorylate only a few molecules of pEndos to effect the M phase-to-interphase transition."

Because the <i>K</i><sub><i>m</i></sub> of PP2A-B55 for pEndos is four-to-five orders of magnitude smaller than the <i>K</i><sub><i>m</i></sub> for other substrates, typified by pCDKS (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>), and the pEndos concentration during M phase is in excess of the phosphatase concentration, we suggest that the approximation of ignoring the binding of PP2A-B55 to other substrates is appropriate, and that this simplified model should capture the essence of the regulatory process. The calculation begins at the end of M-phase (<i>t</i> = 0) with the inactivation of Gwl. Almost all the PP2A-B55 is sequestered by pEndos until PP2A-B55-catalyzed dephosphorylation causes the pEndos concentration to decrease from 1 \u03bcM to \u223c250 nM, the intracellular PP2A-B55 concentration. Beyond this point, PP2A-B55 is rapidly released from sequestration; half is available to act on other substrates within 74 s (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10A</a>). Note that this calculation essentially recapitulates the actual experiments shown in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>, but here the inhibition of PP22A-B55 is stronger and the time to release is faster because physiological, not laboratory, conditions are being modeled."

In this case, the lag in PP2A-B55 desequestration shown in <a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10B</a> is shortened, because PPX can dephosphorylate the pEndos that is not bound to PP2A/B55. However, as illustrated in <a href=\"#fig10s1\">Figure 10\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, the presence of PPX makes very little difference once the pEndos concentration decreases to the PP2A-B55 concentration of 250 nM, since almost all the remaining pEndos is bound to PP2A-B55. In this scenario, half of the PPA-B55 is released from pEndos by 38 s, producing a modest acceleration in M phase exit. We regard the situation shown in <a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10B</a> as a reasonable description of the actual events in the cell, as it accounts for contributions from both PP2A-B55 and other phosphatases in pEndos inactivation."

In this scenario, PP2A-B55 would protect the bound pEndos from dephosphorylation, so many hours\u2014not just a few minutes\u2014would be required for PP2A-B55 desequestration and M phase exit. In other words, the dephosphorylation of pEndos by PP2A-B55 is an absolute requirement for rapid completion of the M phase-to-interphase transition."

According to our model, the rate-limiting Gwl-inactivating phosphatase cannot be PP2A-B55, because the system would be futile. Gwl inactivation could not proceed until pEndos was depleted, but pEndos cannot be inactivated as long as Gwl is active. An argument can be made that PP2A-B55 should be the Gwl-inactivating phosphatase because Gwl is activated by CDKs (<a href=\"#bib5\">Blake-Hodek et al., 2012</a>), and PP2A-B55 targets at least a subset of CDK phosphosites (<a href=\"#bib54\">Mochida and Hunt, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Castilho et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Mochida et al., 2009</a>). Indeed, one group has recently reported some evidence in favor of this idea (<a href=\"#bib30\">Hegarat et al., 2014</a>). However, it should be emphasized that PP2A-B55 does not act on all, or even perhaps the majority, of CDK phosphosites, as recently most forcefully demonstrated by <a href=\"#bib15\">Cundell et al. (2013)</a>. The obvious resolution of this dilemma is therefore that a phosphatase other than PP2A-B55 inactivates Gwl during M phase exit. We have obtained preliminary evidence in support of this idea in two ways (data not shown). First, in our hands purified PP2A-B55 in vitro is very inefficient in inactivating Gwl. Second, when active Gwl is added to interphase extracts from a variety of cell types, it becomes rapidly inactivated and dephosphorylated in a process that is insensitive to okadaic acid (and cannot therefore be controlled by PP2A-B55). Some evidence in favor of the existence of an okadaic acid-resistant anti-Gwl phosphatase has also recently been obtained by another group (<a href=\"#bib30\">Hegarat et al., 2014</a>); the identity of this Gwl-inactivating enzyme is currently unknown."

Our conclusions are in essence consistent with their hypothesis, and the automatic reset mechanism we propose provides an explanation for part of the delay they observe between CDK1-Cyclin B inactivation and the activation of PP2A-B55, and thus for the dephosphorylation of late substrates involved in cytokinesis such as PRC1. That is, the major determining factors for this delay would be the rate of Endos dephosphorylation by PP2A-B55 described here coupled with the time required to inactivate Gwl through mechanisms we do not yet understand."

Inhibition occurs only after Inhibitor-1 is phosphorylated at a conserved site by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), an enzyme whose structure and activation mechanism are closely related to those of its fellow AGC kinase family member, Gwl (<a href=\"#bib5\">Blake-Hodek et al., 2012</a>). The investigators found that purified PP1 could dephosphorylate PKA-phosphorylated Inhibitor-1, and the values of <i>K</i><sub><i>m</i></sub> and <i>k</i><sub><i>cat</i></sub> were both considerably lower for this reaction than for dephosphorylation of the more normal substrate phosphorylase <i>a</i> (<a href=\"#bib19\">Foulkes et al., 1983</a>).

Of interest, recent studies in <i>Xenopus</i> egg extracts have indicated that pInhibitor-1 dephosphorylation at the end of M phase is in fact dependent upon activity of PP1, although this work could not distinguish whether the effect was direct or indirect (<a href=\"#bib92\">Wu et al., 2009</a>).

To improve accuracy we used a modification of the approach used in <a href=\"#bib71\">Sasaki et al. (1994)</a> and <a href=\"#bib81\">Takai et al. (1995)</a> to measure the <i>K</i><sub><i>m</i></sub> by a supplementary method: competing the PP2A-B55-catalyzed dephosphorylation of a fixed amount of pEndos with varying concentrations of okadaic acid (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D,E</a>). This approach was feasible because the dissociation constant of okadaic acid with respect to PP2A has been carefully determined (<a href=\"#bib80\">Takai et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Sasaki et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Takai et al., 1995</a>) and because the affinity of pEndos for PP2A-B55 is in the same order of magnitude. By using an initial pEndos concentration ([<i>N</i>]<sub><i>T</i></sub>(0) = 50 nM or 1 \u03bcM, depending on the experiment) that was much greater than the PP2A-B55 concentration ([<i>P</i>]<sub><i>T</i></sub> = 0.25 nM or 1 nM) and by limiting the incubation time, we ensured that only a small fraction of pEndos was dephosphorylated, facilitating a more accurate determination of the <i>K</i><sub><i>m</i></sub>. Moreover, this ensured that [<i>P</i>]<sub><i>T</i></sub>/{[<i>N</i>]<sub><i>T</i></sub>(0) + <i>K</i><sub><i>m</i></sub>} &lt; 0.005 &lt;&lt; 1, so the total quasi-steady state approximation that was used or mathematical analysis was good (<a href=\"#bib6\">Borghans et al., 1996</a>)."

The authors use a number of systems (<i>Xenopus</i> extracts, <i>Drosophila</i> and mammalian tissue culture cells) to investigate the dephosphorylation of Endos, the protein that becomes an inhibitor of the PP2A-B55 isoform of PP2A once Endos is phosphorylated by Greatwall. The authors use a variety of inhibitors and siRNA treatments to identify the phosphatase as PP2A-B55 itself. They resolve this apparent paradox by suggesting that the kinetics of Endos dephosphorylation mean that it will be preferentially dephosporylated when Greatwall is inactivated in mitosis. This study presents an interesting idea for how mitotic exit can be controlled that should be of general interest in the field, and to those working on phosphatases in general. Before publication, however, the following points should be addressed."

Both of these samples were encased in exactly the same type of vials; we suspect that both suppliers were selling the same preparation from a single manufacturer that was made many years ago. We also resuspended the fostriecin powder in different diluents (water, DMSO, and ethanol) and found identical results. It should be noted that the potency was reduced for the reactions of both pEndos and pCDKS substrates with the purified PP2A-B55 holoenzyme (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>).

As described in the revised text, we have recalculated the latter accounting for the tight binding and present these revised calculations in <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>.

We thus took the suggestion of the reviewer to heart and conducted a time course in which PP2A-B55 was mixed with both radioactive pCDKS substrate and non-radioactive pEndos. These results are shown in new <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a> of the revised manuscript, and they correspond extremely closely to our expectations. The enzyme barely works on the pCDKS substrate at early time points. But later, when the kinetics predicts the pEndos would have been substantially dephosphorylated, the rate of pCDKS dephosphorylation increases dramatically to about the same initial rate as the controls. In our opinion, this is a very clear demonstration of the PP2A-B55 reset mechanism we proposed. We particularly thank the reviewers for this suggestion."

We did perform one new experiment in which we mixed together the enzyme and pEndos substrate at high concentrations, and then we diluted the sample through a 25-fold range. As expected, the velocity of the reaction was unchanged, meaning that the same number of cpm of phosphate were released regardless of the final concentrations. The problem with this experiment is that it was done at a considerable excess of pEndos to the enzyme, and at the final dilution, the concentration of pEndos was roughly 20 nM. This value is considerably above the <i>K</i><sub><i>m</i></sub> and in the range where the enzyme remains saturated with substrate. Basically, this result is just another way of saying that the system is already at Vmax at pEndos concentrations higher than about 10 nM; this conclusion was already presented in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a> in a slightly different way. We thus have not included a figure showing the new less-than-ideal experiment, though we could of course do so if desired."

For example, we could increase the concentration of enzyme to say 5 nM (10 times what we normally use) and decrease the concentration of pEndos to 1 nM. But the sample would then have very few total cpm, and the complex would then have to be significantly diluted which presents difficulties in sample handling. (With higher substrate concentrations, we could avoid the sample handling problem by assaying the same volume of each dilution, but the same approach with more dilute substrate would yield samples with no counts.) An additional problem is that if the enzyme is in excess, the reaction would exhaust almost all of the substrate very rapidly (less than a half minute) even though the <i>k</i><sub><i>cat</i></sub> is relatively low. We thus believe that the data that could be gained from such an experiment would not be very believable."

Nonetheless, presumably the inactivation of Gwl requires active/reactivated PP2A-B55, because Gwl is activated through direct phosphorylation by CDK1 (as previously reported by the authors).

At the outset of our experiments, we had the same supposition as the reviewers: that PP2A-B55 would be the main such enzyme because CDK phosphorylations activate Gwl and PP2A-B55 can remove certain such phosphorylations. However, it is increasingly clear that PP2A-B55 does not act on all, or even perhaps the majority, of CDK sites. The best evidence for this statement comes from a recent paper from Cundell et al. that was referenced earlier by the reviewers. Thus, there is no a priori reason to conclude that Gwl must be inactivated by PP2A-B55."

(ii) When we add active Gwl to extracts (frog eggs, or HeLa or S2 cells) that are not in M phase, Gwl rapidly loses its phosphorylations and is turned off even in the presence of high concentrations of okadaic acid that would completely inhibit PP2A. We presume that this okadaic acid-insensitive phosphatase is driving Gwl inactivation during M phase exit, but we do not yet know the identity of this enzyme. This phosphatase could be constitutively active if the rate of Gwl phosphorylation by CDK1 during M phase is higher than the rate of Gwl dephosphorylation, or this enzyme could conceivably be negatively regulated directly or indirectly by CDK1."

For example, the activity they measure in PP2A-B55 IPs that can remove unspecified phosphates from Gwl (which may or may not be involved in Gwl regulation) is less than 30% higher than a high background (their <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>).

We could not easily answer this question because we do not have antibodies specific to the phosphorylated form of Endos that are sufficiently sensitive to detect endogenous levels. However, S. Mochida and collaborators have previously shown by a combination of Western blotting and phos-tag gels that in frog M phase extracts, Endosulfine proteins are nearly quantitatively phosphorylated. Using similar methods, but on extracts from synchronized tissue culture cells, the Cundell et al. paper showed that roughly 50% of the Endosulfine was phosphorylated. Even with the lower of these estimates (which may reflect the presence of some cells that were not at M phase at the time), sufficient headroom exists to conclude that the molar concentration of pEndos during M phase in fact exceeds that of the PP2A-B55 phosphatase."

Note in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a> that the anti-Endos activity is present during M phase and appears to increase about 2-fold during interphase. This 2-fold difference is likely artifactual, being due to the presence (M phase) or absence (interphase) of unlabeled pEndos in the extract, which could compete with the exogenous labeled pEndos substrate. Moreover, the characteristics of the M phase and interphase anti-Endos activities are very similar (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2013figure supplement 1C</a>; <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2013figure supplement 2A</a>; and data not shown), and thus almost certainly represent the same enzyme (namely PP2A-B55)."
