To understand the mechanisms involved in maintaining satellite cell quiescence, we identified gene transcripts that were differentially expressed during satellite cell activation following muscle injury. Transcripts encoding RNA binding proteins were among the most significantly changed and included the mRNA decay factor Tristetraprolin. Tristetraprolin promotes the decay of MyoD mRNA, which encodes a transcriptional regulator of myogenic commitment, via binding to the MyoD mRNA 3\u2032 untranslated region. Upon satellite cell activation, p38\u03b1/\u03b2 MAPK phosphorylates MAPKAP2 and inactivates Tristetraprolin, stabilizing MyoD mRNA. Satellite cell specific knockdown of Tristetraprolin precociously activates satellite cells in vivo, enabling MyoD accumulation, differentiation and cell fusion into myofibers. Regulation of mRNAs by Tristetraprolin appears to function as one of several critical post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms controlling satellite cell homeostasis."

To understand the mechanisms involved in maintaining satellite cell quiescence, we identified gene transcripts that were differentially expressed during satellite cell activation following muscle injury. Transcripts encoding RNA binding proteins were among the most significantly changed and included the mRNA decay factor Tristetraprolin. Tristetraprolin promotes the decay of MyoD mRNA, which encodes a transcriptional regulator of myogenic commitment, via binding to the MyoD mRNA 3\u2032 untranslated region. Upon satellite cell activation, p38\u03b1/\u03b2 MAPK phosphorylates MAPKAP2 and inactivates Tristetraprolin, stabilizing MyoD mRNA. Satellite cell specific knockdown of Tristetraprolin precociously activates satellite cells in vivo, enabling MyoD accumulation, differentiation and cell fusion into myofibers. Regulation of mRNAs by Tristetraprolin appears to function as one of several critical post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms controlling satellite cell homeostasis."

These develop from groups of cells called satellite cells, which are found near the surface of muscle fibers. Once the muscle is injured, the satellite cells are activated and can divide to form two cells with different properties. One remains a satellite cell, while the other forms a \u2018myoblast\u2019 that eventually fuses into a mature muscle fiber. Under normal conditions the satellite cells remain in a dormant state and do not divide, but it is not clear how they maintain this dormant state."

This revealed that when injured, the satellite cells reduced the abundance of several mRNAs, including TTP. Further investigation found that in satellite cells from uninjured tissue, TTP causes the decay of mRNA molecules that are used to produce a protein called MyoD. As MyoD helps the satellite cells to specialize, this decay therefore prevents the formation of myoblasts and keeps the satellite cells in a dormant state. In contrast, damage to the muscle tissue activates a signaling pathway that ultimately inactivates TTP. This enables more of the MyoD protein to be made and the myoblast population to expand."

Thus, TTP is an important regulator that allows satellite cells to remain in a dormant state. In dormant adult stem cells, regulation of protein availability by RNA binding proteins, such as TTP, may co-ordinate rapid changes in metabolic state to promptly repair injured tissue. A major challenge will be to identify the group of proteins involved and determine the precise mechanisms involved in regulating their availability."

Upon muscle injury, SCs activate and then enter S-phase to generate a proliferating myoblast population that differentiates, repairs skeletal muscle tissue, and self-renews to replenish the stem cell pool (<a href=\"#bib11\">Cornelison et al., 2001</a>). Induction of MyoD, a myogenic regulatory transcription factor, is a critical component of this activation cascade. Prior to MyoD induction, and immediately upon satellite cell activation, the p38\u03b1/\u03b2 MAPK pathway is activated, serving as a molecular switch (<a href=\"#bib21\">Jones et al., 2005</a>). In a subset of SCs, p38\u03b1/\u03b2 is asymmetrically activated during cell division to promote SC self-renewal and re-acquisition of quiescence (<a href=\"#bib39\">Troy et al., 2012</a>). Moreover, aged SCs exhibit an intrinsic self-renewal deficit that arises in part from a failure to asymmetrically activate p38\u03b1/\u03b2 MAPK (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bernet et al., 2014</a>). Importantly, post-transcriptional gene regulatory mechanisms, including translational repression, contribute to SC activation and play a key role in the maintenance of the quiescent SC state (<a href=\"#bib14\">Crist et al., 2012</a>)."

Rates of mRNA decay, which fluctuate depending on cellular conditions, are controlled by specialized mRNA binding proteins (RBPs) that bind target mRNAs and activate cellular mRNA decay enzymes (<a href=\"#bib29\">Parker and Song, 2004</a>). TTP is the best studied of the four member Tis11 gene family, which is comprised of the genes: <i>Zfp36</i> (TTP), <i>Zfp36l1</i>, <i>Zfp36l2</i> and <i>Zfp36l3</i>. In macrophages, TTP suppresses the inflammation response by destabilizing proinflammatory mRNAs until extracellular stimuli activate p38\u03b1/\u03b2 MAPK (<a href=\"#bib35\">Stumpo et al., 2010</a>). The p38\u03b1/\u03b2 MAPK signaling pathway then phosphorylates TTP, promoting association with 14-3-3 adaptor proteins and blocking the recruitment of deadenylases, thereby stabilizing transcripts with TTP 3\u2032 UTR binding sites (<a href=\"#bib10\">Clement et al., 2011</a>). TTP loss-of-function has profound effects on overall organismal health and is associated with a severe inflammatory syndrome caused by chronic over-expression of Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)\u03b1 mRNA, as loss of TNF receptor function largely rescues TTP KO phenotypes in TTP/TNFR1/2 triple knockout mice (<a href=\"#bib7\">Carballo et al., 2001</a>)."

Therefore our data, combined with recent reports of miRNA-mediated regulation of SC quiescence (<a href=\"#bib8\">Cheung et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Crist et al., 2012</a>), identify post-transcriptional gene regulation as an effective and potent means of maintaining SC homeostasis in adult skeletal muscle."

This observation is consistent with substantial muscle damage, as evidenced by serum IgG permeable necrotic myofibers, observed in injured tissue 30 min following a BaCl<sub>2</sub> induced injury (<a href=\"#bib43\">Weller et al., 1990</a>) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F,G</a>).

Therefore, following an induced muscle injury we expect the majority of TTP to be phosphorylated. Unfortunately, the anti-phospho-TTP antibody proved unreliable for detection of phospho-TTP in muscle sections (not shown) and thus, we queried SCs in injured muscle for a direct target of p38\u03b1/\u03b2 MAPK phosphorylation, MAPKAPK2 (MK2), which phosphorylates TTP (<a href=\"#bib5\">Brooks and Blackshear, 2013</a>). 30 min post-injury, 45% of the Syndecan-4+ SCs were phospho-MK2 immunoreactive (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>), while uninjured muscle SCs were phospho-MK2 negative (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>).

If TTP phosphorylation is mediated via the p38\u03b1/\u03b2 MAPK pathway, then inhibition of p38\u03b1/\u03b2 MAPK should prevent TTP phosphorylation. To test this hypothesis, we injected SB203580 intraperitoneally (IP), isolated SCs in the presence of SB203580, and examined isolated SCs for phospho-TTP to identify activated SCs and examined SCs for HuR induction, which occurs rapidly upon SC activation (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B,C</a>).

We therefore transfected myofiber-associated SCs with a constitutively active TTP mutant, TTP<sub>S52AS178A</sub> (TTP-AA-myc), to determine if direct manipulation of TTP influenced MyoD protein levels. TTP-AA-myc is unresponsive to p38\u03b1/\u03b2 MAPK signaling, binds target transcripts, recruits mRNA decay factors, and reduces target mRNA stability (<a href=\"#bib34\">Stoecklin et al., 2004</a>).

Moreover, TTP may regulate HuR since a polyadenylation variant of HuR mRNA contains an AU-rich element (<a href=\"#bib1\">Al-Ahmadi et al., 2009</a>) and blocking p38\u03b1/\u03b2 MAPK signaling prevents HuR induction (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C,D</a>). Therefore, HuR is a potential TTP target that may stabilize MyoD mRNA in activated SCs promoting MyoD induction. If correct, HuR expression should be reduced by the TTP-AA-myc mutant similar or to a greater extent then that observed for MyoD. To test this, SCs on intact myofibers were transfected with either a control or TTP-AA-myc mutant plasmid, fixed (as described above) 30 hr post explant and then stained for Syndecan-4 (to identify SCs) and HuR (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). Scoring the percentage of Syndecan-4+ cells that were HuR immunoreactive showed that there were no detectable differences in HuR protein expression in control transfected SCs as compared to TTP-AA-myc transfected SCs (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Thus, it is unlikely that HuR represents a primary TTP target mRNA in activating SCs and may function to control mRNA stability via an alternative signaling pathway."

Bioinformatic analysis of the MyoD 3\u2032 UTR identified a highly conserved TTP binding site (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). To verify TTP binding to the MyoD 3\u2032 UTR, we inserted the full length MyoD 3\u2032 UTR into a Tet-Off \u03b2-Globin reporter (referred to as \u03b2-MyoD) and performed RNA-immunoprecipitation assays. HEK293T cells were co-transfected with the \u00df-MyoD construct and a negative control \u00df-globin sequence that does not bind TTP (\u03b2-GAP), along with wild type TTP or an RNA binding-deficient TTP mutant (F126N) (<a href=\"#bib24\">Lai et al., 2002</a>), both containing a flag epitope tag.

Therefore, loss of TTP from skeletal muscle tissue should precociously activate SCs, promoting inappropriate MyoD expression, and aberrant cell cycle entry. To test this prediction, we analyzed whole tibialis anterior (TA) muscle tissue from uninjured TTP-knockout mice (<a href=\"#bib36\">Taylor et al., 1996</a>) and from uninjured TTP/TNFR1/2 triple knockout mice (3KO) (<a href=\"#bib7\">Carballo et al., 2001</a>). The triple knockout mice were included to rule out potential muscle phenotypes arising as a secondary consequence of increased inflammation due to systemic stabilization of TNF\u03b1 mRNA in the absence of TTP (<a href=\"#bib35\">Stumpo et al., 2010</a>). Neither the TTP knockout mice nor 3KO mice exhibited any detectable gross morphological differences in muscle sections immunostained with laminin (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Moreover, we did not observe Pax7+ cells outside of the basal lamina (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>) nor any significant quantitative differences in Pax7+ SCs between wild type and knock out muscle sections when scoring for Pax7 immunoreactivity (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>; additional quantification in <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2A</a>). In contrast, extralaminar and sublaminar Ki67+ cells were increased in TTP knockout mice and 3KO mice, suggesting that SCs exit the quiescent G0 state in the absence of TTP (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Some sublaminar Ki67+ cells are Pax7 negative, suggesting these cells are myoblasts committed to myogenesis and undergoing terminal differentiation (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Consistent with increased myogenic commitment of SCs, we observe twofold greater numbers of sublaminar MyoD+ cells in TTP knockout mice and in 3KO muscle compared to wild type mice (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>). More centrally located nuclei (CLN) that are indicative of SC fusion into myofibers and a hallmark of muscle injury and repair, were present in TTP knockout mice and 3KO mice compared to controls (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Thus, global loss of TTP appears sufficient to drive a low-level injury response in skeletal muscle in the absence of an overt physical or chemical insult."

Elegant experiments have established roles for maintenance of quiescence by microRNAs, where miR-489 represses Dek expression to maintain quiescence, miR-31 represses Myf-5 translation to maintain quiescence, and alternative polyadenylation regulates Pax3 (<a href=\"#bib3\">Boutet et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Cheung et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Crist et al., 2012</a>).

We propose that TTP suppresses transcripts for SC activation as a mechanism for immediate exit from quiescence. Upon muscle injury, p38\u03b1/\u03b2 MAPK is rapidly activated resulting in phosphorylation of TTP. Phospho-TTP no longer suppresses activation-associated transcripts resulting in rapid induction and SC activation. One such activation-associated transcript targeted by TTP is MyoD, which is rapidly induced due to inactivation of TTP by p38\u03b1/\u03b2 MAPK concurrent with increased MyoD mRNA stability mediated by HuR and transcriptional upregulation of the MyoD gene locus. Since MyoD up-regulates its own transcription, muscle injury would trigger a rapid feed-forward loop resulting in MyoD expression driving SCs to commit to myoblasts. Additionally, we propose that TTP may be involved in down regulation of MyoD mRNA and other TTP-target transcripts expressed by myoblasts, during the initial formation of a quiescent SC population or in reacquisition of quiescence following an injury."

Transcripts encoding proteins that directly regulate mRNAs, including mRNA binding proteins involved in skeletal muscle diseases were highly represented, supporting a critical role for post-transcriptional regulation of RNA in skeletal muscle homeostasis (<a href=\"#bib15\">Farina et al., 2012</a>). The involvement of p38\u03b1/\u03b2 MAPK signaling in SC activation (<a href=\"#bib21\">Jones et al., 2005</a>), asymmetric SC division (<a href=\"#bib39\">Troy et al., 2012</a>) and loss of SC function during aging (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bernet et al., 2014</a>) identifies p38\u03b1/\u03b2 MAPK targets as likely mediators of these cellular processes. Therefore, we focused on TTP, which is a p38\u03b1/\u03b2 MAPK signaling target (<a href=\"#bib35\">Stumpo et al., 2010</a>) and was down-regulated to the greatest extent during SC activation. The <i>Tis11/Zfp36</i> gene family is comprised of TTP and three related genes, of which TTP is the best characterized, containing a tandem zinc finger domain that binds AU rich sequences in the 3\u2032 UTR of mRNAs and targets the mRNAs for sequestration or decay (<a href=\"#bib5\">Brooks and Blackshear, 2013</a>)."

One probable TTP target, HuR, is reported to stabilize MyoD and Myogenin transcripts in myogenic cell lines (<a href=\"#bib16\">Figueroa et al., 2003</a>). Although we found no evidence that TTP regulates HuR during SC activation, HuR is rapidly induced upon SC activation, suggesting that critical mediators of myogenic commitment, including the myogenic transcription factors MyoD and Myf5, are regulated by multiple post-transcriptional regulatory pathways. For example, Myf5 is sequestered from translation in quiescent SCs by miR-33 (<a href=\"#bib14\">Crist et al., 2012</a>). MyoD is a likely candidate for post-transcriptional regulation as MyoD mRNA is present at low but detectable levels in freshly isolated SCs (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplemental file 1C</a>) (<a href=\"#bib11\">Cornelison et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Liu et al., 2013</a>). MyoD protein is induced within 3h of SC activation (<a href=\"#bib21\">Jones et al., 2005</a>) and requires p38\u03b1/\u03b2 MAPK activity (<a href=\"#bib21\">Jones et al., 2005</a>). Asymmetric p38\u03b1/\u03b2 MAPK is required for commitment of one daughter cell to myogenesis during asymmetric SC division (<a href=\"#bib39\">Troy et al., 2012</a>) and presumably, the TTP binding site in the 3\u2032 UTR of MyoD would permit TTP-mediated mRNA decay in daughter cells lacking activated p38\u03b1/\u03b2 MAPK. The behavior of SCs from aged mice is consistent with p38\u03b1/\u03b2 MAPK-mediated regulation of MyoD as these SCs predominately commit to myogenesis with an accompanying reduction in self-renewal, consistent with their elevated p38\u03b1/\u03b2 MAPK activity (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bernet et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Cosgrove et al., 2014</a>). Although MyoD mRNA appears to be a TTP target, TTP likely regulates other mRNAs with AU-rich sites involved in maintenance of SC quiescence. Furthermore, the Tis11 family members Brf1 and Brf2 were also down-regulated upon SC activation. Ongoing work is focused on identification and characterization of additional TTP/Tis11 targets and their involvement in maintenance of SC quiescence."

The increase in MyoD+ cells was accompanied by an increase in mCherry+ myofibers when compared to controls where SCs were infected with scrambled shRNAs. Thus, TTP inhibition breaks SC quiescence in uninjured muscle, providing strong evidence for the involvement of TTP in regulating SC homeostasis. Similarly, post-transcriptional regulation of mRNAs by miR-489 maintains SC quiescence, suggesting Dek and potentially other miR-489 targets regulate SC homeostasis (<a href=\"#bib8\">Cheung et al., 2012</a>). As we do not know the extent of functional diversity within the Pax7+ SC population it is possible that TTP loss-of-function and miR-489 preferentially affect sub-populations of Pax7+ SCs. Additional experiments will resolve whether SC quiescence is coordinately regulated by multiple post-transcriptional mechanisms or whether subsets of SCs are uniquely responsive to distinct skeletal muscle repair or maintenance requirements."

Here, we show that in addition to Myf5 and Pax3 (<a href=\"#bib3\">Boutet et al., 2012</a>), MyoD mRNA is regulated post-transcriptionally via a distinct regulatory mechanism whereby MyoD mRNA is targeted for rapid decay in quiescent SCs. Post-transcriptional regulatory circuitry is required for SC homeostasis and appears to maintain SCs in a primed state, permitting a rapid response to skeletal muscle injury. Moreover, post-transcriptional gene regulation likely facilitates SC self-renewal by asymmetric division and may regulate SC homeostasis via multiple mechanisms. In other tissues undergoing rapid turnover, similar post-transcriptional regulatory networks may ensure that a primed stem cell pool is available to repair and maintain tissue function."

The authors show that it binds to AU-rich sequences in the 3' UTR of MyoD mRNA, promoting messenger decay. Interestingly they find that MyoD is already transcribed in quiescent satellite cells and propose that accumulation of this myogenic determination factor, which would lead to myogenesis, is prevented by this post-transcriptional mechanism. Phosphorylation of TTP by p38 MAPK prevents its destabilising action and the authors propose that this takes place on muscle injury when satellite cells are activated and enter myogenesis. Mouse mutant analysis demonstrates the role of TTP in maintaining quiescence since in its absence satellite cells are activated. These results provide new insight into the regulation of satellite cell behaviour and are of interest to the wider field of stem cell research as well as to the muscle community."
