Here we performed single molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments and uncovered two conformations of complexin-1 bound to the ternary SNARE complex. In the <i>cis</i> conformation, complexin-1 induces a conformational change at the membrane-proximal C-terminal end of the ternary SNARE complex that specifically depends on the N-terminal, accessory, and central domains of complexin-1. The complexin-1 induced conformation of the ternary SNARE complex may be related to a conformation that is juxtaposing the synaptic vesicle and plasma membranes. In the <i>trans</i> conformation, complexin-1 can simultaneously interact with a ternary SNARE complex via the central domain and a binary SNARE complex consisting of syntaxin-1A and SNAP-25A via the accessory domain. The <i>cis</i> conformation may be involved in activation of synchronous neurotransmitter release, whereas both conformations may be involved in regulating spontaneous release."

Here we performed single molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments and uncovered two conformations of complexin-1 bound to the ternary SNARE complex. In the <i>cis</i> conformation, complexin-1 induces a conformational change at the membrane-proximal C-terminal end of the ternary SNARE complex that specifically depends on the N-terminal, accessory, and central domains of complexin-1. The complexin-1 induced conformation of the ternary SNARE complex may be related to a conformation that is juxtaposing the synaptic vesicle and plasma membranes. In the <i>trans</i> conformation, complexin-1 can simultaneously interact with a ternary SNARE complex via the central domain and a binary SNARE complex consisting of syntaxin-1A and SNAP-25A via the accessory domain. The <i>cis</i> conformation may be involved in activation of synchronous neurotransmitter release, whereas both conformations may be involved in regulating spontaneous release."

However, these signals cannot pass across the gaps \u2013 called synapses \u2013 that separate one nerve cell from the next. Instead, signals pass between nerve cells via molecules called neurotransmitters that are released from the membrane of the first cell and recognized by receptors in the membrane of the next. Prior to being released, neurotransmitters are packaged inside bubble-like structures called vesicles. The synaptic vesicles must fuse with the cell membrane in order to release their contents into the synaptic cleft. Proteins called SNAREs work together with other proteins to allow this membrane fusion to occur rapidly after the electrical signal arrives."

This protein activates the quick release of neurotransmitters, which is triggered by an increase in calcium ions as the electrical signal reachess the synapse. Complexin also regulates a different type of neurotransmitter release, which is known as \u201cspontaneous release\u201d. The complexin protein is made up of different regions, each of which is required for one or more of the protein\u2019s activities. However, it is not clear how these regions, or domains, interact with SNAREs and other proteins to enable complexin to perform these roles."

Complexes of SNARE proteins were assembled with one of the SNARE proteins tethered to a surface for imaging. Next, a light-based imaging technique called single molecule F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer (or FRET) was used to monitor how complexin interacts with the SNARE complex. This technique allows individual proteins that have been labeled with fluorescent markers to be followed under a microscope and can show how they interact in real-time."

In one, complexin interacted closely with the SNARE complex so that it made part of the complex change shape. In the other, complexin was able to bridge two SNARE complexes. Complexin can therefore interact with SNARE complexes in different ways by using different regions of the protein."

Complexin has multiple functions: it activates Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered synchronous release, regulates spontaneous release, and increases the primed pool of synaptic vesicles (<a href=\"#bib36\">Mohrmann et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Trimbuch and Rosenmund, 2016</a>). Here we summarize some of the key properties of complexin relevant to this work. Synchronous Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered neurotransmitter release depends critically on complexin (<a href=\"#bib34\">McMahon et al., 1995</a>), and this activating role of complexin is conserved across all species and different types of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced exocytosis studied to date (<a href=\"#bib41\">Reim et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Huntwork and Littleton, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Xue et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Maximov et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Hobson et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Martin et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Kaeser-Woo et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Cao et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Yang et al., 2013</a>, <a href=\"#bib59\">2015</a>). Complexin also regulates spontaneous release, although this effect is less conserved among species and experimental conditions: for example, in <i>Drosophila</i> spontaneous release increases with knockout of complexin (<a href=\"#bib54\">Xue et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Jorquera et al., 2012</a>). Likewise, knockdown in cultured cortical neurons increases spontaneous release, although knockout of complexin in mice differently affects spontaneous release depending on the particular neuronal cell type (<a href=\"#bib30\">Maximov et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Kaeser-Woo et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Yang et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Trimbuch et al., 2014</a>)."

Complexin-1 binds with high affinity (~10 nM) to the neuronal ternary SNARE complex consisting of synaptobrevin-2, syntaxin-1A, and SNAP-25A (<a href=\"#bib34\">McMahon et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Chen et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Pabst et al., 2002</a>).

By varying the complexin-1 concentration, this <i>in vitro</i> study suggested that the regulatory effect on spontaneous fusion and the activating role on Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered release are governed by distinct molecular mechanisms involving different subsets of the four domains of complexin-1.

Ensemble FRET efficiency experiments also indicated that the accessory domain projects away from the SNARE complex (<a href=\"#bib20\">Krishnakumar et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">K\u00fcmmel et al., 2011</a>). However, these previous experiments may not have revealed the full conformational space that is available to the complexin-1 accessory domain due to ensemble averaging. In order to fully explore the conformational space of complexin-1 when bound to SNARE complex, we performed smFRET\u00a0efficiency experiments with fluorescent labels attached to both complexin-1 and the ternary SNARE complex (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). The ternary SNARE complex was assembled as described in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a> using the dN-SB method, starting with the surface-tethered cytoplasmic domain of syntaxin-1A alone, which was labeled with FRET acceptor dye. Unlabeled SNAP-25A and the cytoplasmic domain of synaptobrevin-2 were added sequentially to assemble the ternary SNARE complex. After washing unbound proteins, we added complexin-1 which was labeled with a FRET donor dye within the accessory domain. We observed two populations with low and high FRET efficiency, with their means corresponding to 0.19 \u00b1 0.12 and 0.83 \u00b1 0.15, respectively (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a> and <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). We refer to the high FRET efficiency state as the '<i>cis</i>' conformation of complexin-1, whereas we refer to the low FRET efficiency state as the '<i>trans</i>' conformation of complexin-1 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>)."

There was very little or no change in fluorescence anisotropy for all label sites in the presence of complexin-1 compared to SNARE complex without complexin-1, suggesting that restrictions of the rotational freedoms of the dye molecules by bound complexin-1 are unlikely. Moreover, the sums of the donor and acceptor intensities are similar for the single molecule fluorescence intensity time traces before photobleaching occurs (see representative time traces in <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), suggesting that there is no large protein induced fluorescence enhancement as seen in some systems when a protein binds near a fluorophore at short distance (<a href=\"#bib16\">Hwang and Myong, 2014</a>). We also ruled out photo-physical effects on quantum yield and detection efficiency as an explanation for the observed appearance of the population of the low FRET efficiency\u00a0state by empirically determining the \u03b3-factor for individual molecules (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, <a href=\"#SD4-data\">Table 2\u2014source data 1</a>\u00a0and Materials and methods). The low FRET efficiency state persisted after application of the \u03b3-correction. Finally, we note that measurements of binding kinetics and equilibrium binding constants for the labeled proteins (Materials and methods) agree with literature values of unlabeled proteins (<a href=\"#bib38\">Pabst et al., 2002</a>), again suggesting that the fluorophores do not interfere with the binding surfaces. Taken together, all these controls and observations suggest that the population of the low FRET efficiency states observed for the SNARE label pairs SFC1 and SFC2 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>) represent a distinct conformational state of the ternary SNARE complex that is induced by complexin-1."

Ternary SNARE complex (consisting of SX, the cytoplasmic domain of synaptobrevin-2 (SB), and SNAP-25A (S25)) was assembled using the dN-SB method. Full-length\u00a0wildtype\u00a0complexin-1 (Cpx\u00a0[1-134]) was labeled with acceptor dye (Alexa 647) at residue position 24 (yellow dot). 50 nM of labeled complexin-1 was then incubated for 5 min to form complex with the surface-tethered ternary SNARE complexes. Unbound Cpx molecules were rinsed away. Next, purified binary SNARE complex (consisting of S25 and SX that was donor dye (Alexa 555) labeled at residue 249\u00a0of\u00a0SX, yellow dot) was added at a concentration of 100 nM to the surface-tethered Cpx / ternary SNARE supercomplex.

We tested this interaction by mutations of complexin-1. The k<sub>off</sub> rate of the superclamp mutant of complexin-1 was ~1.5-fold slower (1.36 \u00b1 0.06\u2009s<sup>-1</sup>) than that of wildtype complexin-1, while the k<sub>on</sub> was ~1.5-fold faster (0.56 \u00b1 0.06\u2009\u03bcM<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>), resulting in K<sub>D</sub> = 2.42 \u00b1 0.3\u2009\u03bcM (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C\u2013E</a>). Thus, the complexin-1 superclamp mutant interacts with the binary SNARE complex with three-fold higher affinity than wildtype complexin-1. In contrast, binary SNARE complex binding events with the no-clamp mutant were very rare within our observation period of 100 s and, consequently, we were unable to determine a dissociation constant for the no-clamp mutant, consistent with the notion that it is the complexin-1 accessory domain that establishes the interaction with the binary SNARE complex in our experiment. As expected, the 4M mutant did not bind at all. In summary, the <i>trans</i> conformation of complexin-1 can bridge two SNARE complexes. At variance with this previous study involving partially truncated ternary SNARE complexes (<a href=\"#bib21\">K\u00fcmmel et al., 2011</a>), our results now show that complexin-1 can also bridge a ternary SNARE complex and a binary SNARE complex."

In some of these studies, the existence of antiparallel SNARE complex subconfigurations were <i>directly</i> probed by using antiparallel reporting FRET dye pairs (<a href=\"#bib52\">Weninger et al., 2003</a>). SNARE complex was assembled and then purified, followed by reconstitution into liposomes, which were used to form supported lipid bilayers containing reconstituted SNARE complexes. Thus, surface adsorption effects could not have contributed to the observed antiparallel subconfigurations since the ternary SNARE complex was assembled in solution before reconstitution and surface tethering. An independent study (<a href=\"#bib43\">Ryu et al., 2015</a>) also suggested the existence of antiparallel\u00a0SNARE subconfigurations. Using label pairs attached to synaptobrevin-2 and SNAP-25A, a low smFRET efficiency state was observed, consistent with a subpopulation of antiparallel subconfigurations (Figure S4A and supplementary material pages 2\u20133 for the case without \u03b1SNAP in <a href=\"#bib43\">Ryu et al. 2015</a>)."

However, such a urea purification step would not be possible with SNAREs that are reconstituted in membranes. Our smFRET experiments indicate that the dN-SB method (<a href=\"#bib39\">Pobbati et al., 2006</a>) also results in the proper parallel syntaxin-1A / synaptobrevin-2 subconfiguration within the ternary SNARE complex (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). Our results thus provide for an explanation of the dN-SB method. This method is related to\u00a0an earlier report using a slightly different synaptobrevin fragment, the Vc peptide (<a href=\"#bib35\">Melia et al., 2002</a>). There is independent evidence that improperly assembled SNAREs (including antiparallel subconfigurations) may be a feature of SNAREs in other contexts as well: for vacuolar fusion, proof-reading by the HOPS complex is essential for maximal fusogenic trans SNARE complex formation (<a href=\"#bib60\">Zick and Wickner, 2014</a>). In any case, we used the dN-SB method for all subsequent smFRET studies in this work in order to ensure properly assembled SNARE complex."

Our smFRET experiments now suggest that the accessory domain is involved in <i>either</i> interaction depending on the particular conformation of complexin-1 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). By monitoring the position of the accessory domain with respect to the ternary SNARE complex, we found two major populations in the smFRET\u00a0efficiency histograms. We note that ensemble averaging in previous FRET experiments probably masked the existence of the two populations (<a href=\"#bib20\">Krishnakumar et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Cho et al., 2014</a>). Our smFRET experiments have now resolved two conformations of complexin-1 that both exist when bound to full-length ternary SNARE complex. We ascribe the low and high FRET efficiency state to the <i>trans</i> and <i>cis</i> conformations of complexin-1, respectively. The superclamp mutant of complexin-1 slightly increases the population of the high FRET efficiency state, while the no-clamp mutant greatly decreases the population of the high FRET efficiency state (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,D</a>), suggesting that the accessory domain is important for the <i>cis</i> conformation of complexin-1."

Remarkably, a substantial fraction of\u00a0the ternary SNARE complex exhibited a conformational change upon addition of complexin-1 as indicated by the emergence of a low FRET efficiency state (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). This complexin-1 induced conformational change of the ternary SNARE complex depends on interactions involving the N-terminal, accessory, and core domains of complexin-1 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4I</a>), suggesting an intimate interaction between\u00a0all of\u00a0these domains of complexin-1 and the ternary SNARE complex. Thus, the low FRET efficiency state\u00a0likely corresponds to the <i>cis</i> conformation of complexin-1 when bound to the ternary SNARE complex. In support of this notion, mutations of the accessory helix of complexin-1 also had an effect on the conformations of complexin-1 when bound to the ternary SNARE complex. When attaching FRET label pairs on complexin-1 and syntaxin-1A within the complexin-1 / ternary SNARE supercomplex, the superclamp mutant slightly increased the population of the high FRET efficiency state (i.e., an increase of the <i>cis</i> conformation) compared to wildtype complexin-1 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). This effect correlates with a slight increase in the population of the low FRET efficiency state by the superclamp mutant when the FRET label pairs were attached to the C-terminal end of the SNARE complex (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>). Similarly, the effects for the no-clamp mutant were also correlated compared to wildtype complexin-1: there is a decrease of the <i>cis</i> conformation of complexin-1 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>) and a decrease in the population of the low FRET efficiency state of the SNARE complex (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>).

Most of the spin-labeled residues of the accessory domain of complexin-1 exhibited spectral broadening when quaternary complex was formed with the SNARE complex, likely due to formation of an \u03b1-helical conformation of the accessory domain of complexin-1. However, the authors noted that the spectra were sharper than those for solvent exposed residues on the surface of an \u03b1-helix that is part of a globular protein.

In contrast when starting from fully assembled ternary SNARE complex, both the accessory and N-terminal domains are required to induce the observed conformational change at the C-terminal end of the SNARE complex.

The resulting complexin-1 / ternary SNARE supercomplex should allow the N-terminal, accessory, and C-terminal domains of bound complexin-1 to be accessible for other interactions when it is in the <i>trans</i> conformation. The binary (syntaxin-1A / SNAP-25A) SNARE complex bound weakly to the preassembled complexin-1 / ternary SNARE supercomplex via the accessory domain (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). Together with previous results (<a href=\"#bib21\">K\u00fcmmel et al., 2011</a>), one complexin-1 molecule in the <i>trans</i> conformation can bridge a variety of SNARE complexes. The correlations between complexin-1 mutants and this bridging interaction (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C\u2013E</a>) suggests that it is probably specific rather than merely a consequence of the flexible character of the binary SNARE complex that may expose hydrophobic elements in certain configurations (<a href=\"#bib51\">Weninger et al., 2008</a>). We speculate that the <i>trans</i> conformation of complexin-1 is related to regulation of spontaneous fusion (<a href=\"#bib20\">Krishnakumar et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">K\u00fcmmel et al., 2011</a>) (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>, left panel).

Similar to the complexin-1 induced conformational change at the C-terminal end of the ternary SNARE complex that we observe, a low FRET population was induced by \u03b1SNAP that increased as the \u03b1SNAP concentration was increased (compare Figure S4B in [<a href=\"#bib43\">Ryu et al., 2015</a>] with <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). In contrast, no conformational change was observed at the N-terminal end of the SNARE complex upon \u03b1SNAP binding. Since two quite different factors (complexin-1 and \u03b1SNAP) can induce a conformational change at the C-terminal end of the SNARE complex, this suggests that the C-terminal end has different conformational properties than the N-terminal end. This finding is also consistent with multistage un-zippering of the SNARE complex by single molecule pulling experiments (<a href=\"#bib9\">Gao et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Marniemi et al., 1975</a>). Taken together, the observed plasticity of the membrane-proximal C-terminal end of the ternary\u00a0SNARE complex likely has a\u00a0functional role in membrane fusion, and the N-terminal domain of complexin-1 assists this process."

Briefly, single molecule fluorescence intensities were recorded with a prism-type total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscope using 532 nm laser light (CrystaLaser, Reno, NV) excitation and detected by an Andor iXon EMCCD camera (Andor Technology, South Windsor, CT) at a frame rate of 10\u2009Hz. The acceptor and donor fluorescence intensities were separated using a 640 nm single-edge dichroic beam-splitter (Shemrock, Rochester, NY) producing observation channels for both donor and acceptor fluorescence intensities. Fluorescence intensity movies were recorded for 1000 frames (100 s) until most of the dyes were photobleached with 532 nm laser light illumination. Data analysis was performed with the smCamera software from Taekjip Ha\u2019s group at University of Illinois and analyzed with scripts written for MATLAB (Mathworks)."

The mean \u03b3-corrections are relatively small (<a href=\"#SD4-data\">Table 2\u2014source data 1</a>) for both dye pairs, arguing against a large influence on the sampling of orientations of the dye molecules by complexin-1 binding.

After application of the \u03b3-corrections to the FRET efficiency histograms, the low FRET efficiency population is still observed (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013B</a>), suggesting that the induction of the low FRET efficiency population must be due to a genuine conformational change of the ternary SNARE complex that is induced by complexin-1.

Briefly, we used simulated-annealing molecular dynamics simulations starting from the crystal structures and conjugated fluorescent dye molecules to reduced cysteine residues (<a href=\"#bib6\">Choi et al., 2010</a>). 100 simulations were performed where all protein atoms were fixed except for the fluorescent dye, which was allowed to freely rotate.

For protein complexes singly labeled with Alexa 555, we used an excitation wavelength of 532 \u00b1 5 nm and an emission wavelength of 575 \u00b1 5 nm. For protein complexes that were singly labeled with Alexa 647, we used an excitation wavelength of 651 \u00b1 5 nm and an emission wavelength of 671 \u00b1 5 nm. The absorbance value for both dye labeled samples at the respective excitation wavelengths were adjusted to 0.05 AU for all samples to perform ensemble anisotropy measurements. SNARE proteins were individually purified and labeled with donor (Alexa 555) and acceptor (Alexa 647) dye molecule before complexes were formed. SNARE complex was assembled by mixing syntaxin-1 and SNAP-25 aliquots followed by addition synaptobrevin-2 fused to a N-terminal 6x-histidine tag at a ratio of 1:2:5, respectively, overnight at 4\u00b0C. The protein mixture was rebound to Nickel-NTA agarose beads (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and washed extensively with TBS (20\u2009mM Tris, 150\u2009mM NaCl, pH 7.5, 0.5\u2009mM TCEP). Additional washing with TBS containing 7.5\u2009M was used in order to favor the correct assembly and folding of the SNARE complex (<a href=\"#bib52\">Weninger et al., 2003</a>). TEV was added to the eluted samples to cleave off the hexa-histidine tag of the synaptobrevin-2 construct for 1\u2009hr at room temperature. The sample was then further purified by a Superdex 75 size exclusion column chromatography (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences, Piscataway, NJ) in TBS in order to remove unbound SNAP-25A and synaptobrevin-2 molcules."

Syntaxin-1A was labeled with acceptor dye at the C-terminus at residue 249. The donor dye labeling site of complexin-1, residue 26, was chosen based on the crystal structure (PDB ID 1KIL) of the complexin-1 / ternary SNARE supercomplex (<a href=\"#bib4\">Chen et al., 2002</a>) to produce high FRET efficiency when bound to the ternary SNARE complex (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A,B</a>). Representative traces of real time measurements showed stochastic bursts of acceptor fluorescence upon complexin-1 binding to syntaxin-1A, binary, and ternary SNARE complexes (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C\u2013E</a>). We used hidden Markov modeling to extract dwell times of the bound and unbound states (<a href=\"#bib33\">McKinney et al., 2006</a>). Histograms of individual dwell times were fitted with an exponential function to extract the kinetic rate constants k<sub>off</sub> and k<sub>on</sub> (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8F,G</a>). From the measured rate constants, we calculated equilibrium dissociation constants (K<sub>D</sub>) (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8H</a>)."

These values agree reasonably well with previous single molecule measurements with ternary SNARE complex that used reconstituted full length syntaxin-1A (<a href=\"#bib25\">Li et al., 2007</a>), validating the surface-tethering method used in this work. For the complexin-1 interaction to the binary SNARE complex the k<sub>off</sub> and k<sub>on</sub> rate constants were 1.8 \u00b1 0.07\u2009s<sup>-1</sup> and 0.92 \u00b1 0.03\u2009\u03bcM<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>, respectively, resulting in K<sub>D</sub> = 2.0 \u00b1 0.03\u2009\u03bcM, in good agreement with previous isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments (K<sub>D</sub> = 2.4 \u00b1 0.2\u2009\u03bcM, ref. [<a href=\"#bib24\">Li et al., 2011</a>]). For the complexin-1 interaction to syntaxin-1A alone, the k<sub>off</sub> and k<sub>on</sub> rates constants were 2.96 \u00b1 0.44\u2009s<sup>-1</sup> and 0.16 \u00b1 0.001\u2009\u03bcM<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>, respectively, resulting in K<sub>D</sub> = 18.5 \u00b1 2.8\u2009\u03bcM. In summary, complexin-1 has a weak affinity to syntaxin-1A alone, and binds progressively more strongly from binary to ternary SNARE complex (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8H</a>)."

As control we also tested the 4M mutant (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). The kinetic rate constants of both the superclamp and no-clamp mutants were similar to that of wildtype complexin-1, resulting in K<sub>D</sub> = 0.063 \u00b1 0.01\u2009\u03bcM and 0.068 \u00b1 0.01\u2009\u03bcM, respectively (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8I\u2013K</a>). As expected, the k<sub>on</sub> rate for the complexin-1 4M mutant was not measurable on the time scale of our experiment, and k<sub>off</sub> rate was 1.34 \u00b1 0.01\u2009s<sup>-1</sup>, which is more than 10 times weaker than that for wildtype complexin-1. The lack of an effect of the no-clamp and superclamp mutants on the affinity between complexin-1 and SNARE complex suggests that under the particular conditions of this experiment, the binding is dominated by the interaction between the core domain of complexin-1 and ternary SNARE complex."

Importantly, the authors demonstrate that complexin has the capacity to disturb the C-terminal region of the SNARE complex, which potentially provides a structural basis for the \"clamping mechanism\". Further, the authors show that complexin bound to the ternary SNARE complex can make an intermolecular bridge to the syntaxin-SNAP25 binary complex, which supports the \"trans-insertion model\" proposed by Rothman and coworkers. Finally, the authors report a method using co-incubation with the C-terminal fragment of synaptobrevin to allow proper SNARE complex assembly of immobilized SNARE complexes."

The current study dramatically extends the molecular picture of the configurations of complexin interacting with the SNARE complex and the authors make convincing arguments about the connections between these configurations and complexin function. These results excitingly bridge several contradictory models, and thus the readers of <i>eLife</i> will receive the current work with broad interest."

This argument is mathematically incorrect: in a bulk-averaged FRET experiment one observes the average of two FRET values that each have a highly nonlinear dependence on the distance (1/R<sup>6</sup>), so that the average FRET value will certainly not be the same as a FRET value calculated using the average of the two distances. Furthermore, comparisons between FRET values derived from these two studies can only be made when the label sites and fluorophores/linkers are identical. This issue is connected to the inaccuracy of FRET experiments reporting on distance: one can only compare FRET values obtained with the exact same proteins and labeling, with conformation being the only difference."

Direct complexin contacts with the dyes or environmental changes due to close complexin binding could be speculated to impact FRET signals without conformational changes. The authors have taken substantial care to address such potential concerns. In particular, anisotropy studies of the fluorophores at these locations do not show changes with or without complexin (Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2), and \u03b3 factor analysis of FRET pairs Figure 4\u2014figure supplements 3 and 4) also are unchanged with or without complexin. These results suggest dye rotational motion or quantum yields are not significantly altered by complexin binding. In addition, the authors might wish to further emphasize the observation that their measurement of binding kinetics and equilibrium binding constants (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>) for labeled proteins that agree with literature values of unlabeled proteins suggests the fluorophores are not interfering with the biding interfaces. One more point is that the sum of donor and acceptor intensities for the traces shown in <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a> are all nearly the same in all of the FRET states. This suggests that there is no large Protein Induced Fuorescence Enhancement that is seen in some systems when a protein binds near a fluorophore (Hwang H. and Myong S. \"Protein induced fluorescence enhancement (PIFE) for probing protein-nucleic acid interactions\" Chem. Soc. Rev. 2014; 43:1221), further suggesting FRET changes are not an artifact."

For the estimate of the error in the dye separation R, the uncertainty that is relevant is that in the accuracy of the peak value from the Gaussian fits used as the value E. Maybe this uncertainty in E is hard to determine as it is probably due to systematic variations and the width of the peak is some sort of estimate, but it is not clear how closely they are related. Maybe a cautionary comment is appropriate?"

By spin-labeling five residues of the accessory domain of complexin-1 (shown in their <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>), most of these spin labels showed spectral broadening when quaternary complex was formed with the SNARE complex. Lu et al.concluded that this broadening is due to formation of an \u03b1-helical conformation of the accessory domain of complexin-1. However, the authors noted that the spectra were sharper than those for solvent exposed residues on the surface of an \u03b1-helix that is part of a globular protein. Such sharpening could be due to motion between several conformations that are sampled by the accessory domain, consistent the range of conformations that are suggested by our smFRET efficiency histogram (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Moreover, assuming that the <i>cis</i> conformation of complexin-1 would involve more tertiary interactions with the SNARE complex, it would result in a broader spectrum than for the <i>trans</i> conformation. Yet, the average of these spectra would be somewhere between these two cases and we believe that it would be difficult to uncover individual states of the system by these particular EPR experiments."

Only positions 69 and 76 showed EPR spectral broadening when complexin-1 bound to the SNARE complex (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> in Lu et al., 2010). <sub>1</sub>H-<sub>15</sub>N TROSY-HSQC NMR spectra of <sub>15</sub>N-labeled SNARE complex revealed chemical shifts for positions in all four SNARE components at the C-terminal end of the SNARE complex in the presence of full-length complexin-1 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a> in Xue et al., 2010), consistent with our observation of an interaction of full-length complexin-1 with the C-terminal end of the SNARE complex that depends on the presence of the N-terminal domain of complexin-1 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4I</a>). Thus, considering the NMR data by Xue et al., the absence of a change in line width observed by EPR is apparently consistent with the existence of interactions or conformational changes at the C-terminal end of the SNARE complex. However, we agree that the EPR results argue against dissociation of the C-terminal half of synaptobrevin-2 since the resulting motion of the C-terminal half of synaptovrevin-2 would be predicted to result in line sharpening. We apologize if we gave the impression of implying such a dissociation of the synaptobrevin-2 C-terminal half. Rather, our results suggest a conformational change of the SNARE complex where all the SNARE components are still interacting. We clarified the Discussion accordingly."

Distance information from smFRET experiments is notoriously unreliable; many factors such as local protein interactions and dye conformation play a role in the conversion between FRET values and distance. As is the convention in the field, it is much safer to use FRET values to classify conformational states and draw correlations between these values and different distances observed in crystal structures.</i> "

This argument is mathematically incorrect: in a bulk-averaged FRET experiment one observes the average of two FRET values that each have a highly nonlinear dependence on the distance (1/R^6), so that the average FRET value will certainly not be the same as a FRET value calculated using the average of the two distances. Furthermore, comparisons between FRET values derived from these two studies can only be made when the label sites and fluorophores/linkers are identical. This issue is connected to the inaccuracy of FRET experiments reporting on distance: one can only compare FRET values obtained with the exact same proteins and labeling, with conformation being the only difference.</i> "

Direct complexin contacts with the dyes or environmental changes due to close complexin binding could be speculated to impact FRET signals without conformational changes. The authors have taken substantial care to address such potential concerns. In particular, anisotropy studies of the fluorophores at these locations do not show changes with or without complexin (Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2), and \u03b3 factor analysis of FRET pairs Figure 4\u2014figure supplements 3 and 4) also are unchanged with or without complexin. These results suggest dye rotational motion or quantum yields are not significantly altered by complexin binding. In addition, the authors might wish to further emphasize the observation that their measurement of binding kinetics and equilibrium binding constants (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>) for labeled proteins that agree with literature values of unlabeled proteins suggests the fluorophores are not interfering with the biding interfaces. One more point is that the sum of donor and acceptor intensities for the traces shown in <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a> are all nearly the same in all of the FRET states. This suggests that there is no large Protein Induced Fuorescence Enhancement that is seen in some systems when a protein binds near a fluorophore (Hwang H. and Myong S. \"Protein induced fluorescence enhancement (PIFE) for probing protein-nucleic acid interactions\" Chem. Soc. Rev. 2014; 43:1221), further suggesting FRET changes are not an artifact.</i> "

For the estimate of the error in the dye separation R, the uncertainty that is relevant is that in the accuracy of the peak value from the Gaussian fits used as the value E.
