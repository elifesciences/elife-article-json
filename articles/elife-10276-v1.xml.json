In yeast, endocytic vesicles move towards early endosomes along actin cables, however, the molecular machinery regulating interaction between endocytic vesicles and actin cables is poorly understood. The Eps15-like protein Pan1p plays a key role in actin-mediated endocytosis and is negatively regulated by Ark1 and Prk1 kinases. Here we show that <i>pan1</i> mutated to prevent phosphorylation at all 18 threonines, <i>pan1-18TA</i>, displayed almost the same endocytic defect as <i>ark1</i>\u0394 <i>prk1</i>\u0394 cells, and contained abnormal actin concentrations including several endocytic compartments. Early endosomes were highly localized in the actin concentrations and displayed movement along actin cables. The dephosphorylated form of Pan1p also caused stable associations between endocytic vesicles and actin cables, and between endocytic vesicles and endosomes. Thus Pan1 phosphorylation is part of a novel mechanism that regulates endocytic compartment interactions with each other and with actin cables."

In yeast, endocytic vesicles move towards early endosomes along actin cables, however, the molecular machinery regulating interaction between endocytic vesicles and actin cables is poorly understood. The Eps15-like protein Pan1p plays a key role in actin-mediated endocytosis and is negatively regulated by Ark1 and Prk1 kinases. Here we show that <i>pan1</i> mutated to prevent phosphorylation at all 18 threonines, <i>pan1-18TA</i>, displayed almost the same endocytic defect as <i>ark1</i>\u0394 <i>prk1</i>\u0394 cells, and contained abnormal actin concentrations including several endocytic compartments. Early endosomes were highly localized in the actin concentrations and displayed movement along actin cables. The dephosphorylated form of Pan1p also caused stable associations between endocytic vesicles and actin cables, and between endocytic vesicles and endosomes. Thus Pan1 phosphorylation is part of a novel mechanism that regulates endocytic compartment interactions with each other and with actin cables."

                        "text": "Endocytosis is the process by which cells internalize various molecules, such as proteins and lipids, from the plasma membrane and outside the cell. Recent live-cell imaging studies of yeast and mammalian cells have revealed that the actin cytoskeleton plays important roles in the formation and internalization of clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs) and post-internalization events in the endocytic pathway, including vesicle transport and endosome motility (<a href=\"#bib14\">Engqvist-Goldstein and Drubin, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Girao et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Kaksonen et al., 2006</a>). In the early stages of the endocytic pathway, transient actin polymerization at the endocytic site is required for the formation and internalization of a CCV (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kaksonen et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Merrifield et al., 2002</a>). This process is regulated by several actin nucleation promoting factors (NPFs), including the type I myosins Myo3/5p, the actin binding protein Abp1p, the yeast WASP homologue Las17p, and the Eps15-like protein Pan1p (<a href=\"#bib19\">Goode et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Weinberg and Drubin, 2012</a>). Compared to Las17p and Myo3/5p, Pan1p has a lower NPF activity, and mutation in the Arp2/3 complex binding region of Pan1p causes only a minor defect in actin polymerization at endocytic sites because of the functional redundancy with Las17p (<a href=\"#bib51\">Sun et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Toshima et al., 2005</a>). However, a form of Pan1p mutated to prevent phosphorylation at 15 threonines, Pan1-15TA, directly binds to F-actin with high affinity and its expression causes abnormal cytoplasmic actin concentrations, also called actin clumps (<a href=\"#bib53\">Toshima et al., 2005</a>). Thus, Pan1p could be acting after F-actin is assembled by other NPFs as well as or instead of during the initiation of actin polymerization during endocytosis."

                        "text": "Pan1p\u2019s abilities to bind F-actin and promote actin polymerization are regulated by the Prk1 family protein kinases Prk1p and Ark1p, which are related to the mammalian proteins GAK and AAK1 (<a href=\"#bib49\">Smythe and Ayscough, 2003</a>). The Prk1 family kinases are important regulators of endocytosis and the actin cytoskeleton in both yeast and mammalian cells (<a href=\"#bib49\">Smythe and Ayscough, 2003</a>). In budding yeast, Ark1p and Prk1p are recruited to endocytic sites 1\u20132 s after commencement of actin assembly and CCV internalization, and phosphorylate several endocytic proteins, including Sla1p, Ent1/2p, Yap1801/2p, Scd5p, and Pan1p, to disassemble endocytic coat proteins and actin (<a href=\"#bib12\">Cope et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Henry et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Toret et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Watson et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Zeng and Cai, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Zeng et al., 2001</a>). Pan1p is one of the key targets of Ark1/Prk1 kinases, and phosphorylation of Pan1p by Ark1/Prk1 kinases is believed to be important for disassembly of the Pan1p complex, composed of several endocytic proteins (<a href=\"#bib53\">Toshima et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Wendland and Emr, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Zeng and Cai, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Zeng et al., 2001</a>). Interestingly, disruption of the normal phosphorylation cycle by deletion or chemical inhibition of Ark1/Prk1 kinases leads to the concentration of actin in association with endocytic vesicles (<a href=\"#bib47\">Sekiya-Kawasaki et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Toshima et al., 2005</a>), suggesting a role for Pan1p and other substrates in regulating interaction between endocytic vesicles and the actin cytoskeleton."

                        "text": "After being internalized, endocytic vesicles move away from the plasma membrane in an association with actin cables that is still mechanistically unexplained (<a href=\"#bib24\">Huckaba et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Toshima et al., 2006</a>). Yeast actin cables, which are bundles of actin filaments that align along the long axis of budding yeast, are crucial for the establishment of cell polarity (<a href=\"#bib63\">Yang and Pon, 2002</a>). Actin cables are also used as tracks for polarized transport during the secretion of exocytic vesicles and the segregation of organelles from mother to daughter cells (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bretscher, 2003</a>). Many of these types of transport along actin cables are known to depend on the type V myosins, Myo2/4p, which mediate the movement of cargo from the minus to plus ends of actin filaments (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bretscher, 2003</a>). However, transport of endocytic vesicles along actin cables is not likely to depend on these myosins, because a temperature sensitive mutant of <i>MYO2 (myo2-66</i>) or a deletion of <i>MYO4</i> gene did not exhibit any defect in endocytosis (<a href=\"#bib20\">Govindan et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Haarer et al., 1994</a>). Other myosins, such as type II myosin (Myo1p) and type I myosin (Myo3/5p) also do not seem to mediate this transport. Myo1p has an important role in controlling actin cable dynamics at the bud sites or neck, but it is not localized to endocytic vesicles (<a href=\"#bib25\">Huckaba et al., 2006</a>). Myo3/5p are necessary for promoting actin assembly and endocytosis at cortical patches, but they stay at the cell cortex when endocytic vesicles are internalized along actin cables (<a href=\"#bib51\">Sun et al., 2006</a>). Interestingly, a previous study demonstrated that endocytic vesicle movement occurs at the same velocity and in the same direction as the movement of actin cables (<a href=\"#bib24\">Huckaba et al., 2004</a>). They also reported that an endocytic vesicle stays at the same position on the cable and moves together with the actin cable, suggesting that endocytic vesicles are fixed on the actin cables and move as a result of actin cable flow (<a href=\"#bib24\">Huckaba et al., 2004</a>). In addition to endocytic vesicles, early endosomes also associate with the actin cytoskeleton, and the motility of endosomes is significantly inhibited by treatment of latrunculin A (LatA), a drug that sequesters actin monomers (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chang et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Fernandez-Borja et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Toshima et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Voigt et al., 2005</a>). Similarly to endocytic vesicles, early endosome motility also does not depend on Myo2/4p (<a href=\"#bib54\">Toshima et al., 2006</a>). These results suggest that unknown molecular mechanisms exist that bind endocytic vesicles and endosomes to actin cables."

However, the defect in the <i>pan1-15TA</i> mutant was not as pronounced as that in the <i>ark1</i>\u25b3 <i>prk1</i>\u25b3 mutant (<a href=\"#bib53\">Toshima et al., 2005</a>). We first sought to determine if the presence of other functionally important phosphorylation sites in Pan1p was responsible for the difference in phenotypes. In a previous intensive investigation, Cai and colleagues identified the [L/I/V/M]xx[Q/N/T/S]xTG motif as a further potential site of phosphorylation by Ark1/Prk1 kinases (<a href=\"#bib23\">Huang et al., 2003</a>). Pan1p contains three more such Ark1p/Prk1p consensus sequences (MQPNIT<sup>464</sup>G, MMPQTT<sup>480</sup>G, and MMPQTT<sup>487</sup>G) all located in the second LR region (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib23\">Huang et al., 2003</a>). When we additionally mutated these sites to create <i>pan1-18TA,</i> we observed a more severe growth retardation phenotype than in <i>pan1-15TA</i> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). The Pan1-18TA protein was expressed normally, but its phosphorylation was mostly inhibited (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). <i>pan1-18TA</i> mutant cells displayed prominent actin concentrations and a more severe defect in endocytic internalization (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D,E</a>). Pan1-18TA-GFP also showed defects in localization, with 95% colocalizing with actin clumps or smaller, peripheral actin patches, similar to Pan1-15TA (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>) (<a href=\"#bib53\">Toshima et al., 2005</a>). This is in contrast to wild-type cells, in which Pan1p is recruited to cortical patches early, arriving ~20 s before actin is detected, and associates with actin for ~10\u201315 s (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kaksonen, 2003</a>), resulting in ~30% of Pan1p colocalizing with Abp1p (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>)."

                                "text": "We next entertained the hypothesis that Prk1p phosphorylation of some of its other known targets such as Sla1p, Ent1/2p, Yap1801/2p and Scd5p (<a href=\"#bib59\">Watson et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Zeng et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">2007</a>), might also play a role in regulating actin organization and endocytosis. These target proteins were shown to be phosphorylated by Prk1p in vitro, but significant phenotypes caused by mutations of their phosphorylation-sites have not been observed (<a href=\"#bib22\">Henry et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Huang et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Watson et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Zeng et al., 2001</a>). Sla1p contains the most potential Prk1 phosphorylation sites among these proteins (<a href=\"#bib65\">Zeng et al., 2001</a>). We therefore mutated the threonines in all 10 of these [L/I/V/M]xx[Q/N/T/S]xTG sites (<a href=\"#bib23\">Huang et al., 2003</a>) to alanine (<i>sla1-10TA</i>), integrated this mutant into the endogenous <i>SLA1</i> locus, and analyzed the phenotypes (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). We first confirmed that the Sla1-10TA mutant was expressed at similar levels to the wild-type protein, and that its phosphorylation was severely inhibited (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). While cells lacking the <i>SLA1</i> gene were temperature-sensitive for growth at 37<sup>\u00b0</sup>C, the <i>sla1-10TA</i> mutant exhibited almost the same growth as wild-type cells (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Alexa Fluor 488-phalloidin staining of F-actin in fixed <i>sla1-10TA</i> mutants closely resembled that of wild-type cells, with brightly stained actin patches and weakly stained actin cables (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). We next examined the dynamics of the clathrin-coat module and the actin patches in the <i>sla1-10TA</i> mutants, using GFP-tagged Sla1-10TA and Abp1-mCherry as markers respectively (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kaksonen et al., 2003</a>). Consistent with previous reports, Sla1p and Abp1p patches formed in the cell cortex with lifetimes of 36 \u00b1 7 s and 13 \u00b1 3\u2009s, respectively, culminating in inward movement (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1E,F</a>) (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kaksonen et al., 2003</a>). Sla1-GFP localization was immediately followed by a burst of Abp1-mCherry recruitment in wild-type cells (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). In the <i>sla1-10TA</i> mutants, Sla1p and Abp1p patches formed and disappeared with the typical inward movement, and their lifetimes were slightly prolonged to 43 \u00b1 11 s and 15 \u00b1 3\u2009s, respectively (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1F</a>). We also examined the effect of <i>sla1-10TA</i> mutants on endocytic internalization by assessing the ingression of <sup>35</sup>S-labeled \u03b1-factor, and found that it was only slightly affected (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1G</a>). Furthermore, the <i>pan1-18TA sla1-10TA</i> double mutant exhibited only a negligible additive effect, when compared to the <i>pan1-18TA</i> single mutant (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>, and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D,H</a>). These findings indicate that Pan1p is the major in vivosubstrate of Ark1/Prk1 kinases during their regulation of endocytosis."

Vps8p and Vps11p, which mediate early to late transitions of endosomes, exhibited levels of actin clump localization (~30%) similar to that of Vps24p (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). In contrast, Vps26p or Vps52p, both of which are required for retrograde transport from late endosomes to the Golgi, showed lower localization (~15% and ~7%, respectively), and Sec7p and Sec4p, which reside on the Golgi or secretory pathway, were rarely contained in actin clumps in the <i>pan1-18TA</i> mutant (&lt;10%) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>).

                                "text": "We wished to confirm that early endosomes accumulate at actin clumps in <i>pan1-18TA</i> mutant cells. As we had seen the ESCRT-0 component Hse1p localize to actin clumps in the mutant, we wished to investigate its organellar localization in wild-type cells more precisely; therefore we tagged Hse1p with three tandem repeats of GFP (3GFP) or mCherry and confirmed their functionality (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Hse1-3GFP was clearly detected as numerous small puncta throughout the cytoplasm and prevacuolar compartments (PVCs) (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Examining Hse1-3GFP in the overlay of 30 consecutive time-lapse frames made it easy to distinguish the Hse1p localizing at endosomes in the cytoplasm (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>, right cell) and at the PVCs (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>, left cell). By comparing the localization of Hse1-mCherry with GFP-tagged markers, we found that Hse1p exhibited high colocalization with Mvb12p, partial colocalization with Ear1p and Vps26p, and little colocalization with Sec7p (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C,D</a>). We next utilized A594-\u03b1-factor to compare the spatiotemporal localization of Hse1p with Vps26p in the endocytic pathway (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1E,F</a>) (<a href=\"#bib54\">Toshima et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">2009</a>). Hse1-3GFP was highly colocalized with A594-\u03b1-factor-labeled endosomes at 5\u201310 min after \u03b1-factor internalization, whereas Vps26-GFP was mainly colocalized with A594-\u03b1-factor-labeled endosomes at 10\u2009min (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1G</a>). In <i>pan1-18TA</i> cells, similar levels of Hse1p also colocalized with Vps26p (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1D,H</a>). These data indicate that Hse1p is widely localized from early to late endosomes and partially colocalized with Vps26p at late endosomes both in wild-type and <i>pan1-18TA</i> cells. Unexpectedly, Vps21p, yeast Rab5, which is known to be localized at early-to-late endosomes (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cabrera et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Puchner et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Toshima et al., 2014</a>), exhibited lower localization at the actin clumps (~33%), compared to Hse1p (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>). To determine the relative localization of Hse1p and Vps21p at early stage of endocytosis, we slowed endocytic transport by removing glucose from culture medium (<a href=\"#bib1\">Aoh et al., 2011</a>), and compared their localization with internalized A594-\u03b1-factor. Consistent with a recent study by Arlt et al. reporting that an ESCRT-I subunit, Vps23, is recruited to endosomes earlier than Vps21p (<a href=\"#bib2\">Arlt et al., 2015</a>), we found that Hse1p colocalizes with A594-\u03b1-factor slightly more than Vps21p at 10\u2009min after \u03b1-factor internalization (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). These results, therefore, suggest that endosomes at the early stage of endocytosis are highly localized to actin clumps."

                                "text": "The localization of early endosomal proteins at actin clumps in the <i>pan1-18TA</i> mutant suggests that early endosomes might associate with the actin cytoskeleton in wild-type cells. Previous studies have also indicated that actin cables mediate the directed movements of early endosomes (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chang et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Toshima et al., 2006</a>), but which endosomes, and how they associate with actin cables, has not yet been clarified. We utilized Hse1p as a marker to address these questions. However because Hse1p is found at early to late endosomes, we classified these endosomes into two categories using Vps26-mCherry: endosomes not labeled with Vps26-mCherry (early stage endosomes) and endosomes labeled with Vps26-mCherry (late stage endosome) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,C</a>). Vps26-mCherry mostly colocalized with Hse1p at the vacuolar membrane (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,C</a>). Quantification of endosome velocity revealed that early-stage endosomes moved with an average speed of 125 \u00b1 119 nm/s (<i>n\u00a0</i>=\u00a0100), whereas late-stage endosomes moved with an average speed of 156 \u00b1 130 nm/s (<i>n\u00a0</i>=\u00a0100) in wild-type cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>). We then investigated the effects of the actin-sequestering drug, LatrunculinA (LatA), on the movement of these endosomes. Concomitantly, LatA treatment led to a significant decrease in the velocity of early-stage endosomes (~23 \u00b1 47 nm/s) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,D</a>). In contrast, the velocity of late-stage endosomes was not significantly affected by LatA treatment (~119 \u00b1 112 nm/s) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,D</a>). Similar results were obtained by analyzing Vps21p-containing endosomes (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). The velocity of Vps21p-containing endosomes not labeled with Vps26-mCherry (~146 \u00b1 128 nm/s) was decreased by LatA treatment (~55 \u00b1 42 nm/s), whereas that of ones labeled with Vps26-mCherry (~138 \u00b1 128 nm/s) was not significantly affected (~99 \u00b1 91 nm/s). To further confirm the association between Hse1p-labeled endosomes and the actin cytoskeleton, we labeled actin cables with tdTomato-tagged Abp140p (<a href=\"#bib63\">Yang and Pon, 2002</a>) in wild-type cells. Simultaneous imaging revealed that Hse1p-labeled endosomes localized along, and moved on, actin cables (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E,F</a>, and <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). Since two distinct sets of actin assembly-promoting machinery have been identified in yeast, the Arp2/3 complex and formins (<a href=\"#bib19\">Goode et al., 2015</a>), we next utilized specific inhibitors toward these regulators. The Arp2/3 complex inhibitor CK-666 specifically disassembled Arp2/3 complex-dependent actin patches, whereas SMIFH2 disassembled formin-dependent actin cables (<a href=\"#bib38\">Nolen et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Rizvi et al., 2009</a>). As expected, SMIFH2 treatment led to actin cable disassembly, followed by a decrease in the velocity of endosomes (~60 \u00b1 53 nm/s). In contrast, CK-666 inhibited vesicle internalization, but endosome motilities were little affected (~126 \u00b1 123 nm/s) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G,H</a>, and <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). These results indicate that the movement of early-stage endosomes is dependent on formin-dependent actin polymerization."

                                "text": "In addition to endosomes, endocytic vesicles are also known to associate with actin cables (<a href=\"#bib24\">Huckaba et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Toshima et al., 2006</a>), but the molecules that regulate this association remain unclear. Therefore, we examined the effect of the <i>pan1-18TA</i> mutation on the localization and dynamics of actin cables and endocytic vesicles. In wild-type cells, actin cables are highly dynamic polarized structures (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a> and <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>) (<a href=\"#bib63\">Yang and Pon, 2002</a>). In contrast, the <i>pan1-18TA</i> mutant exhibited less polarized and more aggregated actin cable structures, some of which associated with the large actin concentrations (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a> and <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>). The movement of this Pan1p/actin aggregate in <i>pan1-18TA</i> was sensitive to SMIFH2 but not CK-666, suggesting that the aberrant structure associates with actin cables (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B\u2013E</a>). In a recent study, we showed that ~85% of endocytic vesicles were internalized along actin cables at the internalization step of endocytosis (<a href=\"#bib57\">Toshima et al., 2015</a>). Here we show that in this step, Pan1-mCherry-labeled vesicles in wild-type cells associated with actin cables for ~4.6 s and moved on cables about 0.4 \u03bcm after internalization (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B,C</a>). This association and these movements were significantly decreased by treating with 25 \u03bcM SMIFH2 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,C,D</a>). Over 80% of Pan1-mCherry-labeled endocytic vesicles, even in single focal plane images, also associated with and internalized along actin cables in the <i>pan1-18TA</i> mutant (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). In contrast to wild-type cells, Pan1-18TA-mCherry structures became stably associated with peripheral patches, as well as actin clumps, labeled by Abp140-3GFP (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). Interestingly, live-cell imaging revealed that many of internalized patches labeled by Pan1-18TA-mCherry stably associated with actin cables over 30 s, and move on actin cables more than 3.0 \u03bcm (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,C,E</a>, and <a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a>). We also wished to determine the relationship of endocytic vesicles and endosomes in the absence of Pan1 phosphorylation. In the <i>pan1-18TA</i> mutant, we often observed that peripheral Pan1-18TA-mCherry patches colocalized and moved together with Hse1p-labeled endosomes (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F,G</a>, and <a href=\"#media5\">Video 5</a>), whereas such colocalization was rarely observed in wild-type cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>). These findings suggest that in the <i>pan1-18TA</i> mutant, endocytic vesicles and endosomes interact before fusion while they are both associated with actin cables, potentially tethering them together. Our data was collected with a wide field microscope; high-speed confocal microscopy could improve the quality of our results as it would permit 3-D analysis (<a href=\"#bib33\">Kurokawa et al., 2013</a>). However, since some vesicles and endosomes move in a single focal plane, the simultaneous double color live cell imaging used in this study permits analysis leading to substantive biological insights."

To completely destroy the actin binding activity of Pan1p, we used a Pan1 C-terminal deletion mutant (<i>pan1</i>\u25b3855\u20131480), which lacks actin binding and Arp2/3-activating regions (<a href=\"#bib13\">Duncan et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Toshima et al., 2005</a>).

                                "text": "To be sure that this association is not merely a product of both being caught up in aberrant actin concentrations, we sought to isolate a mutant that could suppress actin clump formation in the <i>pan1-18TA</i> mutant. To this end, we deleted several actin-related genes involved in endocytic internalization in the <i>pan1-18TA</i> mutant and found three out of seven genes whose absence suppressed actin clump formation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>). Deletion of Sla2p, a yeast Hip1R-related protein, in the <i>pan1-18TA</i> mutant decreased the fraction of cells containing actin clumps by 95% as detected by Abp1-mCherry in maximum-intensity projections of Z stacks (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). These <i>pan1-18TA sla2</i>\u25b3 double mutants exhibited the elongated actin tails originating from non-motile endocytic sites seen in <i>sla2</i>\u25b3 (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kaksonen et al., 2003</a>) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Deletion of both of the yeast type I myosins, Myo3p and Myo5p, led to an 85% reduction and deletion of Sac6p, the yeast homologue of the actin filament bundling protein fimbrin, almost completely suppressed actin clump formation in the <i>pan1-18TA</i> mutant (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). All three mutants showed a severe defect in the internalization of cortical actin patches (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kaksonen et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">2005</a>), resulting in the loss of actin clumps in the <i>pan1-18TA</i> mutant. We then wished to examine the localization of early endosomes, using Hse1-GFP as a marker, in these double and triple mutants. Interestingly, Hse1p-labeled endosomes showed a change in localization to the cell periphery in all three suppressing mutants (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B,C</a>). We also observed that Pan1-18TA patches accumulate near Hse1p-labeled endosomes at the cell periphery in <i>pan1-18TA sac6</i>\u25b3 cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). As reported previously (<a href=\"#bib17\">Gheorghe et al., 2008</a>), deletion of the <i>SAC6</i> gene increased the lifetime of actin patches, but around half of the endocytic vesicles were able to internalize (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1C,D</a>), indicating that the formation of endocytic vesicles is delayed but eventually occurred. In contrast, in <i>pan1-18TA sac6</i>\u25b3 cells, the lifetime of actin patches were significantly increased and their internalizations were markedly decreased, but ~5.3% of patches were still internalized (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). Thus, it seems that endocytic vesicle formation is not completely blocked in <i>pan1-18TA sac6\u2206</i> cells. To examine if endocytic vesicles are formed in this double mutant, we explored the ultrastructure of these mutants using electron microscopy. Interestingly, we observed many vesicle-like structures (~40\u201360 nm) accumulating around the cell periphery in <i>pan1-18TA sac6</i>\u25b3 cells, whereas in wild-type cells such structures were rarely detected (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2A\u2013C</a>). We also observed that several endosome-like structures (~200\u2013300 nm) associate with these vesicles in this mutant (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). Quantification of these structures revealed that endosome-like structures associate with ~1\u20133 small vesicles in two-dimensional cross sections (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2D</a>). Similarly to <i>pan1-18TA sac6</i>\u25b3 cells, in <i>pan1-18TA sla2</i>\u25b3 cells, Hse1p-labeled endosomes were observed at the cell periphery. <i>sla2</i>\u25b3 cells are reported to have a severe defect in endocytic internalization, but the internalization is not completely inhibited (<a href=\"#bib42\">Raths et al., 1993</a>) and endocytic coats are assembled on the plasma membrane (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kaksonen et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Skruzny et al., 2012</a>). Thus, in <i>pan1-18TA sla2</i>\u25b3 cells, peripheral endosomes might interact with the occasionally formed endocytic vesicles at the cell periphery or with coat proteins accumulating on the plasma membrane. Examining Hse1-GFP in overlaid time-lapse images of <i>pan1-18TA sac6</i>\u25b3 cells demonstrated its localization exclusively at the cell periphery and vacuolar membrane, and that peripheral endosomes are less motile (~17.8 nm/s), compared to prevacuolar ones (~189.0 nm/s) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E,F</a>). Since the <i>pan1-18TA sac6</i>\u25b3 double mutant has apparently normal late endosomes at the vacuolar membrane, similar to wild-type cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>), the peripheral immotile endosomes observed in the mutant are likely early endosomes. Such peripheral endosomes were rarely observed in the <i>sac6</i>\u25b3 mutant (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>), suggesting that they are due to the mutation of the phosphorylation sites in Pan1p and not just due to the defects in the actin cytoskeleton. LatA treatment had no effect on endosome localization in <i>pan1-18TA sac6</i>\u25b3 cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G</a>), supporting the contention that endocytic vesicles and early endosomes stably associate, independently of actin."

The vesicles move in a retrograde direction, from daughter toward mother cells (<a href=\"#bib24\">Huckaba et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Toshima et al., 2006</a>). This is distinct from most types of transport along actin cables, such as secretion and organellar division, that move from mother to daughter cells due to the action of myosin V motor proteins (Myo2p and Myo4p). Findings that endocytic vesicle movement occurs at the same velocity and direction as that of actin cables have suggested that endocytic vesicles remain fixed on the actin cables and move as a result of actin cable flow (<a href=\"#bib18\">Girao et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Huckaba et al., 2004</a>)."

Several such proteins exist (<a href=\"#bib14\">Engqvist-Goldstein and Drubin, 2003</a>). Considering that the association between endocytic vesicles and actin cables should be transient and controllable, Pan1p is an ideal candidate to mediate this interaction. Pan1p can bind directly to F-actin with high affinity (KD&lt;0.5 \u03bcM) and its binding activity is regulated by phosphorylation through the Ark1/Prk1 kinases (<a href=\"#bib53\">Toshima et al., 2005</a>). In this study, we demonstrated that a Pan1-18TA \u25b3855 mutant lacking its C-terminal actin binding and Arp2/3-activating regions partially suppressed the formation of the actin clump and reduced the interaction between Pan1p-residing vesicles and actin cables. Thus, Pan1p seems to be one of the key regulators that fixes vesicles to the actin cable and then dissociate from the cable and the vesicle upon phosphorylation (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). However, the ability of vesicles to bind to actin cables was not completely lost in the mutant, implying the existence of additional actin-binding coat protein(s) that stabilize vesicle association with actin cables. Sla2p, the yeast HIP1R, and Ent1p, the yeast epsin, bind to both the plasma membrane and F-actin via their N-terminal lipid-binding domain and C-terminal actin-binding domain (<a href=\"#bib48\">Skruzny et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Sun et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Yang et al., 1999</a>). A recent study showed that Sla2p and Ent1p interact redundantly with F-actin, and strains carrying a deletion of both proteins\u2019 actin-binding domains exhibit severe a defect in endocytosis (<a href=\"#bib48\">Skruzny et al., 2012</a>). Although the defects caused by these mutants are predominantly observed in vesicle formation, these proteins could be responsible for the residual association of endocytic vesicles with actin cables in the Pan1-18TA actin-binding mutant."

Pan1p phosphorylation by Ark1/Prk1 kinases causes dissociation of coat proteins and the actin cable from the endocytic vesicle, making it possible for the vesicle to fuse to the endosome.

In the <i>pan1-18TA</i> mutant, endocytic vesicles stably associate with and move together with endosomes. This finding suggests that endocytic vesicles are capable of tethering to early endosomes, but are inefficient at fusing with them due to the inhibition of endocytic vesicle uncoating caused by Pan1p-dephosphorylation. Many tethering proteins localized at target organelles have been shown to directly interact with coat proteins of transport vesicles (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cai et al., 2007</a>), supporting this idea. After phosphorylation of Pan1p by Ark1/Prk1 kinases, the endocytic vesicle is uncoated, making it possible to fuse to the early endosome. Thus the cycle of Pan1 phosphorylation could release endocytic vesicles from the actin cable precisely at the time of their fusion to the endosome, also allowing the endosome which is indirectly tethered to then move on and mature into a late endosome."

                        "text": "Our experiments may also permit a clearer ordering of the mechanistic steps of endocytosis. Many lines of evidence indicate that cargo transport from early to late endosomes is achieved by endosome maturation, which is a successive and rapid process accompanied by Rab5-Rab7 conversion (<a href=\"#bib4\">Balderhaar and Ungermann, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Nordmann et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Poteryaev et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Rink et al., 2005</a>). In yeast, attempts to visualize the conversion of Vps21p (yeast Rab5) to Ypt7p (yeast Rab7) on endosomes have so far been unsuccessful. Since Vps21p is localized not only at early, but also at late endosomes (<a href=\"#bib56\">Toshima et al., 2014</a>), it is difficult to determine the point at which the early endosome ends and the late endosome begins. In the <i>pan1-18TA</i> mutant, localization of endosomal proteins was clearly divided into several groups, and endosomes at the early stage were more highly localized to actin clumps. This observation may be informative when considering the timing of several events comprising the endocytic pathway. For instance, subunits of the ESCRT-0, I, and II complex are highly localized but the subunit of ESCRT-III or Vps4p is localized only partially at actin clumps in the <i>pan1-18TA</i> mutant, suggesting that recruitment of early ESCRT components to the endosome occurs at a relatively early stage (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). Vps21p is a key regulator of early endocytic trafficking, being involved in fusion between early endosomes and the maturation of early to late endosomes (<a href=\"#bib40\">Poteryaev et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Rink et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Russell et al., 2012</a>). Deletion of the <i>VPS21</i> gene results in accumulation of early endosomes in the cytosol (<a href=\"#bib56\">Toshima et al., 2014</a>). Yet Vps21p exhibited only partial localization at actin clumps, suggesting that Vps21p is recruited to the endosomal membrane after the start of ESCRT complex formation. Vps26p, a component of the retromer complex, is rarely localized at actin clumps and is predominantly localized at the vacuolar membrane, suggesting that the retromer complex mediates retrograde transport to the Golgi at the late endosome stage (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). Although Rab5-Rab7 conversion is important for endosome maturation what triggers initiation of early-to-late endosome transition is still unknown. We demonstrated that early endosomes associate with actin filaments and then change their localization to the vacuolar membrane. This suggests that dissociation of early endosomes from the actin filaments might be a trigger for the initiation of endosome maturation."

The interaction between endosomes and actin is regulated by RhoB GTPase, an upstream recruiter and activator of mammalian Dia1 and PRK1/PKN (<a href=\"#bib15\">Fernandez-Borja et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Mellor et al., 1998</a>).

To integrate <i>pan1</i> mutants at the endogenous locus, the integration plasmids were digested with <i>Sac</i>I and <i>Xba</i>I, and transformed into <i>pan1</i>\u25b3::<i>HIS3/PAN1</i> diploid strains. Integrated <i>pan1</i> mutants were selected on SC plates lacking leucine and sporulated to obtain <i>pan1-18TA</i> mutants. Phosphorylation site mutants were constructed by a PCR-based mutagenesis protocol (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>)."

The experiment done here, where 10 threonines within Sla1 are mutated to block its phosphorylation, should be backed up with some kind of experimental assessment that shows that these ten mutations completely block phosphorylation of Sla1. Without this kind of experimental evidence, it is impossible to tell whether the lack of endocytic phenotype in this mutant is due to Sla1 not being an important Ark1/Prk1 target, or if it is due to not all Ark1/Prk1 phosphorylation sites in Sla1 being mutated. Similarly, can the authors present evidence that the 18 threonines mutated in Pan1 are bona fide in vivo Ark1/Prk1 phosphorylation sites?"

In <i>pan1-18TA</i> mutant cells, endocytic internalization is largely defective, but it is not clear how the various endosomal compartments are affected. It does not seem reasonable to assume that Hse1-3GFP localizes only in early endosomes in this mutant. If Hse1-3GFP does not label only the early endosomes in <i>pan1-18TA</i> mutant, then the observation that \"peripheral Pan1-18TA-mCherry patches colocalized and moved together with Hse1p-labeled endosomes,\" does not support the conclusion that \"constitutive dephosphorylation of Pan1p, which inhibits endocytic vesicle uncoating, might lead to stable tethering between endocytic vesicles and early endosomes.\""

They do not find the Rab5-orthologue Vps21, an established marker for early endosomes, to be present at significant amounts in <i>pan1-18TA</i>-induced actin clumps, and they further conclude form WT cells that Hse1 is present at very early endosomes, while Vps21 (and the CORVET complex) arrives later. This is in contrast to the general view that the Rab5/Vps21 marks early endosomes and is required for earliest fusion and maturation events (Zeigerer et al., Nature 2012, Cabrera et al., JBC 2013, Puchner et al., PNAS 2013 Arlt et al., MBoC 2014). The authors have previously published that initial steps in the yeast endocytic network are not dependent on Rab5, however, they have also seen that about 80% of Vps21 endosomes colocalize with Hse1 (Toshima et al., Nature Communications 2014). It is therefore surprising that Vps21 would not be able to mark the here studied earliest endosomes. Given its importance, I suggest substantiating the role of Hse1 as an early marker, provide a more precise definition of the early endosomes studied here, and discuss the results with respect to the literature on Vps21. The exclusion of Vps21 from early steps seems to be based on the quantification of actin clumps that contain the GFP-tagged protein of interest (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). However, this does not take into account differences in the amount and lifetime of the individual proteins. I would rather suggest quantifying and comparing the percentage of GFP-fused protein that is colocalizing with actin clumps. To clarify the identity of the early endosomes that associate with actin, I suggest the measurements of endosome velocity marked by Hse1-GFP/Vps26-mCherry, with and without LatA, (subsection \u201cActin-dependent motility of Hse1p-residing endosomes\u201d) to be also done with GFP-Vps21/Vps26-mCherry."

For <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>, the authors should provide evidence that the small vesicles are endocytic vesicles and the bigger vesicles are early endosomes.

If the authors' model is correct, upon a rapid inhibition of Ark1/Prk1 kinase activity by 1NA-PP1, Pan1p should no longer be phosphorylated and the endocytic vesicles should be fixed to the actin cables near the cell periphery. However, the data shown in Sekiya-Kawasaki et al. did not seem to suggest that this is the case."

The authors search for mutants that suppress clump formation in <i>pan1-18TA</i>, to distinguish tethering of vesicles to endosomes from association of both with actin, if I understand correctly. They find three such mutants that all show peripheral, non-motile endosomes. Firstly, I miss clear evidence that these endosomes are less motile than prevacuolar ones. Second, the authors conclude from their data that these early endosomes associate with vesicles independently of actin. The problem is that <i>sac6\u2206</i>, as well as the other two suppressor deletions, are known to inhibit endocytic internalization (as the authors correctly cite) \u2013 why would there be any endocytic vesicles present? Could there be another interpretation for the presence of peripheral endosomes in these mutants?

However, the experiments in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> do not distinguish between a direct role for Pan1 as the bridging molecule or an indirect role through effects on uncoating that allow for other actin-binding coat proteins to stabilize vesicle association with actin cables. One approach to address this issue might be to introduce actin-binding mutations into Pan1-18TA, such as the WH2-like domain KE mutations described in Toshima et al., 2005. Such mutations are expected to disrupt actin cable binding but not vesicle uncoating. Although these mutations suppress the actin aggregation phenotype, it should still be possible to assess vesicle interaction with actin cables. Alternatively, the actin-binding mutations could be introduced into an otherwise wild-type Pan1 and tested for effects on vesicle association with cables."

There are issues that would need to be addressed, involving some additional experimentation and quantification, before the work would be appropriate for publication in eLife. How endocytic vesicles evolve into endosomal compartments is an important unanswered question in the field. The model developed by the authors is very interesting and if true, represents a significant advance for the field. One concern is that the main experimental technique used in this work is 2D wide-field fluorescence microscopy, which may not be the best method to analyze endosomes, which move dynamically in 3 dimensions. Some of the key data (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>) in this work lack quantification. In addition, some key results using mutants (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figures 5</a> and <a href=\"#fig6\">6</a>) are a bit hard to interpret. Thus, the data are not yet adequate to support the conclusions. 1) The claim that Pan1 is the key biological target for Ark1 and Prk1 kinases could use better support. The experiment done here, where 10 threonines within Sla1 are mutated to block its phosphorylation, should be backed up with some kind of experimental assessment that shows that these ten mutations completely block phosphorylation of Sla1. Without this kind of experimental evidence, it is impossible to tell whether the lack of endocytic phenotype in this mutant is due to Sla1 not being an important Ark1/Prk1 target, or if it is due to not all Ark1/Prk1 phosphorylation sites in Sla1 being mutated. Similarly, can the authors present evidence that the 18 threonines mutated in Pan1 are bona fide</i> in vivo"

They do not find the Rab5-orthologue Vps21, an established marker for early endosomes, to be present at significant amounts in pan1-18TA-induced actin clumps, and they further conclude form WT cells that Hse1 is present at very early endosomes, while Vps21 (and the CORVET complex) arrives later. This is in contrast to the general view that the Rab5/Vps21 marks early endosomes and is required for earliest fusion and maturation events (Zeigerer et al., Nature 2012, Cabrera et al., JBC 2013, Puchner et al., PNAS 2013 Arlt et al., MBoC 2014). The authors have previously published that initial steps in the yeast endocytic network are not dependent on Rab5, however, they have also seen that about 80% of Vps21 endosomes colocalize with Hse1 (Toshima et al., Nature Communications 2014). It is therefore surprising that Vps21 would not be able to mark the here studied earliest endosomes. Given its importance, I suggest substantiating the role of Hse1 as an early marker, provide a more precise definition of the early endosomes studied here, and discuss the results with respect to the literature on Vps21. The exclusion of Vps21 from early steps seems to be based on the quantification of actin clumps that contain the GFP-tagged protein of interest (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). However, this does not take into account differences in the amount and lifetime of the individual proteins. I would rather suggest quantifying and comparing the percentage of GFP-fused protein that is colocalizing with actin clumps. To clarify the identity of the early endosomes that associate with actin, I suggest the measurements of endosome velocity marked by Hse1-GFP/Vps26-mCherry, with and without LatA, (subsection \u201cActin-dependent motility of Hse1p-residing endosomes\u201d) to be also done with GFP-Vps21/Vps26-mCherry.</i>"

Interestingly, we found that Hse1p colocalizes with A594-\u03b1-factor at slightly higher amounts than Vps21p at 10 min after \u03b1-factor internalization (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). This result is consistent with a recent study by Arlt et al. (MBoC, 2015). In the paper, they carefully compared the recruitment timing of several endosomal proteins, including ESCRT subunits and Vps21p and reported that an ESCRT-I subunit, Vps23, is recruited to endosomes earlier than Vps21p. We also quantified the percentage of GFP-fused Vps21p that colocalizes with actin clumps, as the reviewer suggested, and found only ~8% of GFP-Vps21p is localized to actin clumps whereas ~22% of Hse1-GFP is localized to actin clumps (data not shown in the manuscript). Thus, it seems to be reasonable that Hse1p, another ESRCT-I subunit, is recruited to early endosomes before Vps21p, and that Hse1p localizes to actin clumps more than Vps21p."

One approach to address this issue might be to introduce actin-binding mutations into Pan1-18TA, such as the WH2-like domain KE mutations described in Toshima et al., 2005. Such mutations are expected to disrupt actin cable binding but not vesicle uncoating. Although these mutations suppress the actin aggregation phenotype, it should still be possible to assess vesicle interaction with actin cables.

While overall, their results do suggest that endocytic vesicles and endosomes, before fusion, interact and tether while both associated to actin cables, the conclusion that dephosphorylation leads to their stable tethering, seems a bit over interpreted. In this mutant, both vesicles and endosomes are associated with actin for much longer, therefore their long-time tethering may be due to crowding or other effects, rather than the fact that dephosphorylation prevents uncoating of the vesicles. The evidence supporting an association of endosomes with endocytic vesicles in the absence of actin is also weak. It seems clear that there is an increase in peripheral endosomes in cells lacking actin clumps (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B, C</a>), or treated with LatA (6G), but that this localization is due to tethering with vesicles in not established.
