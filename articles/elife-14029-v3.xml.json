                    "text": "The spindle position checkpoint (SPOC) is a spindle pole body (SPB, equivalent of mammalian centrosome) associated surveillance mechanism that halts mitotic exit upon spindle mis-orientation. Here, we monitored the interaction between SPB proteins and the SPOC component Bfa1 by FRET microscopy. We show that Bfa1 binds to the scaffold-protein Nud1 and the \u03b3-tubulin receptor Spc72. Spindle misalignment specifically disrupts Bfa1-Spc72 interaction by a mechanism that requires the 14-3-3-family protein Bmh1 and the MARK/PAR-kinase Kin4. Dissociation of Bfa1 from Spc72 prevents the inhibitory phosphorylation of Bfa1 by the polo-like kinase Cdc5. We propose Spc72 as a regulatory hub that coordinates the activity of Kin4 and Cdc5 towards Bfa1. In addition, analysis of <i>spc72</i>\u2206 cells shows that a mitotic-exit-promoting dominant signal, which is triggered upon elongation of the spindle into the bud, overrides the SPOC. Our data reinforce the importance of daughter-cell-associated factors and centrosome-based regulations in mitotic exit and SPOC control."

                    "text": "The spindle position checkpoint (SPOC) is a spindle pole body (SPB, equivalent of mammalian centrosome) associated surveillance mechanism that halts mitotic exit upon spindle mis-orientation. Here, we monitored the interaction between SPB proteins and the SPOC component Bfa1 by FRET microscopy. We show that Bfa1 binds to the scaffold-protein Nud1 and the \u03b3-tubulin receptor Spc72. Spindle misalignment specifically disrupts Bfa1-Spc72 interaction by a mechanism that requires the 14-3-3-family protein Bmh1 and the MARK/PAR-kinase Kin4. Dissociation of Bfa1 from Spc72 prevents the inhibitory phosphorylation of Bfa1 by the polo-like kinase Cdc5. We propose Spc72 as a regulatory hub that coordinates the activity of Kin4 and Cdc5 towards Bfa1. In addition, analysis of <i>spc72</i>\u2206 cells shows that a mitotic-exit-promoting dominant signal, which is triggered upon elongation of the spindle into the bud, overrides the SPOC. Our data reinforce the importance of daughter-cell-associated factors and centrosome-based regulations in mitotic exit and SPOC control."

This approach identified two proteins that provide sites for Bfa1 to bind to at the ends of the spindle. The experiments also showed that Bfa1 specifically detaches from one of these proteins (called Spc72) when the spindle position checkpoint is activated. This action keeps Bfa1 (and therefore the spindle position checkpoint) active, which in turn stops the cell from starting to divide."

Future work could now aim to identify the mechanism and the unknown factors. Finally, in a related study, Falk et al. show that the spindle position checkpoint is inactivated when one end of the spindle is moved out of the mother cell and into the bud."

In budding yeast, the SPB is associated with components of two linked pathways: the mitotic exit network (MEN) and the spindle position checkpoint (SPOC). The MEN drives mitotic exit (transition from M-G1 phase) after extension of the anaphase spindle into the daughter cell body. The SPOC is a surveillance mechanism that monitors orientation of the mitotic spindle. The SPOC prevents M-G1 transition when the spindle fails to align along the mother to daughter axis and so is unable to deliver one nucleus into the daughter cell (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bloecher et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Muhua et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Pereira et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib84\">Wang et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib88\">Yeh et al., 1995</a>).

SPOC and MEN proteins associate with the cytoplasmic side (outer plaque) of the SPBs, where cytoplasmic microtubules are nucleated. Within this outer plaque, the transforming acidic coiled coil (TACC) family protein Spc72 (the yeast homolog of CDK5RAP2) anchors the \u03b3-tubulin small complexes that nucleate cytoplasmic microtubules (<a href=\"#bib45\">Knop and Schiebel, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Lin et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Usui et al., 2003</a>).

This cell cycle arrest provides extra time to enable the cell to correctly align its spindle along the mother-to-daughter cell axis.

During normal spindle alignment, the Bfa1-Bub2 complex is unequally distributed between the two SPBs, to predominantly associate with the SPB that is directed towards the daughter cell (dSPB) (asymmetric localization) (<a href=\"#bib22\">Fraschini et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Pereira et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">2001</a>). As long as the spindle is correctly positioned, Bfa1-Bub2 remains stably bound to the dSPB (<a href=\"#bib14\">Caydasi and Pereira, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Monje-Casas and Amon, 2009</a>). As soon as the anaphase spindle moves into the daughter cell compartment, Bfa1 is inactivated by the conserved polo-like kinase Cdc5 that inhibits Bfa1-Bub2 GAP activity (<a href=\"#bib24\">Geymonat et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Hu and Elledge, 2002</a>). Upon spindle misalignment, the MARK/PAR family kinase Kin4 is recruited to the Spc72 component of both SPBs (<a href=\"#bib15\">D'Aquino et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Maekawa et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Pereira and Schiebel, 2005</a>). Phosphorylation of Bfa1 by Kin4 at SPBs converts the asymmetric and stable SPB localization of Bfa1-Bub2 into a symmetric (same amount on each SPB) and dynamic association (<a href=\"#bib14\">Caydasi and Pereira, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Monje-Casas and Amon, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Pereira et al., 2000</a>). Kin4 also reduces the levels of SPB-bound Bfa1 (<a href=\"#bib14\">Caydasi and Pereira, 2009</a>). These drastic changes in Bfa1-Bub2 SPB localization are essential for SPOC function and require binding of the 14-3-3 family protein Bmh1 to Bfa1 previously phosphorylated by Kin4 kinase (<a href=\"#bib13\">Caydasi et al., 2014</a>). Although, it is known that Kin4/Bmh1 pathway alters Bfa1-Bub2 association with the SPBs to engage the SPOC, some important questions remain unanswered: How is the Bfa1-Bub2 GAP complex recruited to the SPB outer plaque? How does Bfa1-Bub2 association with the SPB respond to spindle misalignment? Which SPB pool of Bfa1 is regulated by Kin4 and Bmh1?"

Our data reveal that, in an unperturbed mitosis Bfa1 C-terminus associated with the C-termini of two components of the SPB outer layer, Nud1 and Spc72. SPOC activation specifically disrupted the interaction of Bfa1 with the microtubule linker Spc72 but not with the MEN-scaffolding protein Nud1. The remodeling of Bfa1-Spc72 interaction in response to spindle misalignment required Kin4 and Bmh1. We propose a model in which the Kin4/Bmh1 pathway disturbs the interaction between Bfa1 and Spc72 to prevent the inhibition of the GAP complex by Cdc5. This step is essential for SPOC function and propagates the SPOC signal throughout both cell compartments. Cells lacking <i>SPC72</i> were SPOC proficient. However, after prolonged mitotic arrest, we observed that <i>spc72</i>\u2206 cells frequently became binucleated due to SPOC slippage. In binucleated <i>spc72</i>\u2206 cells that possessed two misaligned spindles, re-alignment of only one of the two spindles was sufficient to silence the SPOC and promote mitotic exit irrespective of the presence of one mis-placed nucleus. The dominant nature of this impact of one spindle over the other suggests that there is a MEN activating and/or SPOC inhibitory signal that is released upon the passage of one SPB into the bud. These findings highlight both the importance of local regulation at the SPB for SPOC integrity and the key contribution of a daughter-specific mechanism that triggers MEN activation."

In this technique, protein-protein proximities are determined by the energy transfer between protein pairs labeled with fluorescent FRET donor and acceptor tags. In contrast to the conventional FRET detection, which is based on acceptor emission measurements (i.e., sensitized emission FRET), the acceptor photobleaching FRET monitors the increase in donor fluorescence upon photobleaching of the acceptor (i.e., donor de-quenching) (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) (<a href=\"#bib51\">Llopis et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib86\">Wouters and Bastiaens, 2001</a>). The proportionate increase in the donor fluorescence intensity after photobleaching of the acceptor directly yields the apparent FRET efficiency (E<sub>FRET</sub>) (<a href=\"#bib39\">Karpova et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Kentner and Sourjik, 2009</a>), which is further corrected for the unspecific signal observed in the donor-only sample (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B\u2013D</a>). Detection of this type of FRET signal is more straightforward and more robust than the sensitized emission measurements of FRET that demands multiple corrections for the spectral crosstalk between donor and acceptor fluorophores."

The topology of the core SPB proteins including Spc42, Cnm67 and Spc110 has been previously defined by sensitized emission FRET (<a href=\"#bib61\">Muller et al., 2005</a>). Based on this analysis, we chose the FRET pairs of Spc42-Cnm67 and Spc110-Cnm67 as a molecule pair that interacted and a molecule pair that did not interact, respectively. As fluorophores, we used monomeric Turquoise (mTUR, donor) and enhanced YFP (EYFP, acceptor). In each case the fluorophore was fused to the C-terminus of each protein (<a href=\"#bib28\">Goedhart et al., 2010</a>). In agreement with published data (<a href=\"#bib61\">Muller et al., 2005</a>), the acceptor photobleaching FRET technique yielded a positive FRET interaction between Spc42-mTUR and Cnm67-EYFP (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>, 14% mean FRET efficiency in the donor-acceptor pair), while no FRET was detected for the Spc110-mTUR and Cnm67-EYFP pair (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). In order to estimate the maximum FRET efficiency that could be obtained for the mTUR-EYFP fluorophore pair at the SPB in our experimental system, we constructed a tandem tag composed of EYFP and mTUR fused to Bfa1. Bfa1-EYFP-mTUR yielded a FRET value of 26% at SPBs (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>), to define the maximum value that can be measured for this particular donor-acceptor pair (mTUR-EYFP). We could however detect no FRET in the cytoplasm using the chimeric Bfa1-mTUR-YFP tandem pair (data not shown), indicating that the concentration of Bfa1 in the cytoplasm sits below our FRET detection limit."

To determine whether Bfa1 also directly interacts with Spc72, we used bacterially purified Bfa1 fused to maltose binding protein (MBP-Bfa1), full length Spc72 tagged with glutathione-binding protein (GST) (GST-Spc72) and a C-terminal truncated fragment of Spc72 (codons 231\u2013622) tagged with 6 histidines (6His-Spc72-C, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Full length GST-Spc72 bound to MBP-Bfa1 but not to MBP-beads (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, lanes 1 and 2). The C-terminal 391 amino acids of Spc72 were sufficient to confer this interaction, as 6His-Spc72-C associated with MBP-Bfa1 but not to MBP (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, lanes 3 and 4). Notably, MBP-Bfa1 or MBP did not interact with an unrelated 6His-tagged protein (6His-Mlc1) to highlight the specific nature of the association with 6His-Spc72-C (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, lanes 5 and 6). Taken together, Bfa1 directly binds to Nud1 and Spc72 in vitro, suggesting that the interactions established by FRET arise from direct physical interactions."

This behavior is referred to as asymmetric Bfa1 localization. We asked whether differential association of Bfa1 with Nud1 and Spc72 at the two SPBs explains this asymmetric accumulation of Bfa1. To test this hypothesis, we compared FRET for Bfa1-Nud1 and Bfa1-Spc72 pairs at the dSPB and mSPB in metaphase arrested cells where Bfa1 predominately associates with dSPB and is only weakly detectable on the mSPB (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A and B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib65\">Pereira et al., 2000</a>). The metaphase arrest was achieved through the depletion of the anaphase promoting complex regulatory subunit Cdc20 (<a href=\"#bib75\">Shirayama et al., 1999</a>). The levels of FRET between Bfa1-Nud1 or Bfa1-Spc72 were similar at the mSPB and dSPB (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C and D</a>). This indicates that Bfa1 is in close proximity with Nud1 and Spc72 on both SPBs. Thus, asymmetric SPB localization of Bfa1 cannot be dictated by the differential association of Bfa1 with Spc72 or Nud1."

However, the acceptor (Bfa1-EYFP) is recruited to higher levels at the dSPB than at the mSPB to generate different donor:acceptor ratios on the dSPB and mSPB (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C and D</a>). To evaluate the effect of different donor:acceptor ratios on FRET efficiency, we compared the FRET efficiency of Bfa1-Nud1 or Bfa1-Spc72 pairs with the fluorescence signal intensity of the acceptor (Bfa1-EYFP) before bleaching (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E and F</a>). The values of FRET efficiency did not correlate with the signal intensity of the acceptor. Thus, changes in the donor:acceptor ratio do not affect FRET measurements in our experimental system. This validates the ability of this approach to compare the association of Bfa1 with Nud1 and with Spc72 on different poles."

We therefore asked whether Kin4 affected the association of Bfa1 with Nud1, Spc72 or both partners. To this end, we first analyzed cells overproducing Kin4 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A and B</a>). Overexpression of <i>KIN4</i> activates the SPOC to arrest cells in late anaphase, even when the spindle is correctly aligned (<a href=\"#bib15\">D'Aquino et al., 2005</a>). As a control for cells that arrest in late anaphase without SPOC activation, we overexpressed a non-degradable version of the mitotic cyclin <i>CLB2 (clb2\u2206DB</i>) (<a href=\"#bib81\">Surana et al., 1993</a>) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A and B</a>). FRET between Bfa1 and Nud1 was maintained in <i>KIN4</i> overexpressing cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In contrast, the FRET between Bfa1-Spc72 pair disappeared upon <i>KIN4</i> overexpression (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Thus, Kin4 activity specifically disturbs the interaction between Bfa1 and Spc72 but not that between Bfa1 and Nud1."

In cells lacking <i>BMH1</i>, Bfa1 remains asymmetrically and stably associated with SPBs, even when Kin4 phosphorylates Bfa1 (<a href=\"#bib13\">Caydasi et al., 2014</a>). We therefore proposed that Bmh1 would be required to break the Bfa1-Spc72 interaction. To test this notion, we compared the FRET efficiency between Bfa1 and Spc72 when Kin4 was overproduced in wild type and in <i>bmh1\u2206</i> cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Kin4 overexpression in the presence of <i>BMH1</i> greatly decreased the FRET efficiency of the Bfa1-Spc72 pair (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). This was not the case in <i>bmh1\u2206</i> cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Deletion of <i>BMH1</i> did not influence the FRET efficiency of Nud1\u2013Bfa1 pair (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>)."

Spindle position had no impact upon FRET between Bfa1 and Nud1 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). In contrast, spindle misalignment reduced the FRET efficiency of the Bfa1-Spc72 pair to the level seen in the donor-only control (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>). In the absence of <i>KIN4</i>, however, the FRET between Bfa1 and Spc72 persisted irrespective of spindle position (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G and H</a>). Together, these data show that, upon spindle misalignment, Kin4, with the assistance of Bmh1, rearranges Bfa1 molecules on the SPB by specifically influencing the Bfa1-Spc72 interaction."

We therefore asked whether there were two separate pools of Bfa1, one that binds Spc72 and another Nud1 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013i</a>) or whether Bfa1 molecules bind both Spc72 and Nud1 simultaneously to form a single pool (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A-ii</a>). In the scenario where two individual Bfa1 pools exist (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013i</a>), Spc72 should recruit the majority of Bfa1 to SPBs because SPB-bound Bfa1 levels fall drastically upon spindle misalignment (<a href=\"#bib14\">Caydasi and Pereira, 2009</a>). This coincides well with the loss of Bfa1-Spc72 interaction observed by FRET. Therefore, if two separate Spc72- and Nud1-bound Bfa1 pools exist, less Bfa1 would bind to SPBs in the absence of <i>SPC72</i> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013i</a>). We therefore analyzed Bfa1 localization in cells lacking <i>SPC72</i>. For this analysis, we used the W303 strain background in which <i>SPC72</i> is not essential (<a href=\"#bib31\">Hoepfner et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Soues and Adams, 1998</a>) yet Bfa1-Bub2 SPB binding and phospho-regulation is the same as in S288C background where <i>SPC72</i> is essential (<a href=\"#bib14\">Caydasi and Pereira, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">D'Aquino et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Monje-Casas and Amon, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Pereira and Schiebel, 2005</a>). Cells lacking <i>SPC72</i> cannot form long cytoplasmic microtubules; hence logarithmically growing <i>spc72\u2206</i> cultures contain cells with misaligned spindles alongside cells with correctly aligned spindles (<a href=\"#bib31\">Hoepfner et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Soues and Adams, 1998</a>). FRET analysis showed that Bfa1 associated with Nud1 at SPBs of <i>spc72</i>\u2206 cells regardless of spindle orientation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B and C</a>). Interestingly, SPB-bound Bfa1 levels were not reduced in <i>spc72</i>\u2206 cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>), arguing against the model where there are two pools of Bfa1 that separately bind Spc72 and Nud1."

After photobleaching, Bfa1-GFP failed to recover at SPBs in cells with normally aligned anaphase spindles in the presence of <i>SPC72</i> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). This confirms the previously reported immobile pool of Bfa1 at the dSPB (<a href=\"#bib14\">Caydasi and Pereira, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Monje-Casas and Amon, 2009</a>). Cells lacking <i>SPC72</i> also recruited Bfa1-GFP stably to the dSPB when the anaphase spindle was correctly aligned (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). Thus, Bfa1 interaction with Nud1 is stable throughout anaphase when spindle is correctly aligned, independently of Spc72. Next, we examined cells with misaligned spindles. Consistent with previous data, in the presence of <i>SPC72</i>, Bfa1 was highly dynamic at both SPBs with a half recovery time of ~ 11\u2009s during spindle misalignment (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F and 4G</a>) (<a href=\"#bib14\">Caydasi and Pereira, 2009</a>). The half recovery time of Bfa1 was 6 times longer in <i>spc72\u2206</i> cells than in <i>SPC72</i> cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F and 4G</a>). These data suggest that Spc72 regulates the mode of Bfa1 association with Nud1 when the spindle is mis-positioned."

For this, we performed live cell imaging of <i>spc72\u2206</i> and <i>kar9\u2206</i> cells carrying tubulin tagged with GFP (<i>GFP-TUB1</i>) to decorate microtubules (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). We followed cells in which the mitotic spindle either elongated along the mother to daughter cell axis (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A\u2013C</a>, correct spindle orientation, upper rows) or within the mother cell compartment (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A\u2013C</a>, misaligned spindle, lower rows). We defined the duration of anaphase as being the time that elapsed between the onset of rapid spindle elongation phase and spindle breakdown (which is a consequence of mitotic exit) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>) (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bardin and Amon, 2001</a>). As previously reported (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bloecher et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Pereira et al., 2000</a>), <i>kar9\u2206</i> cells with mis-oriented spindles failed to exit mitosis and displayed a prolonged anaphase arrest indicative of SPOC proficiency (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A and D</a>). Deletion of <i>KIN4</i> in <i>kar9\u2206</i> cells induced cells with misaligned and properly aligned spindles to exit mitosis with similar timing (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B and D</a>), reflecting the SPOC deficiency of <i>kin4</i>\u2206 cells. To our surprise, <i>spc72\u2206</i> cells were able to sustain an anaphase arrest for the duration of the time-lapse movie (&gt;60\u2009min) upon spindle mis-orientation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C and D</a>). This delay did not arise from a general deficiency that would extend anaphase because cells exited mitosis 23\u2009min after the onset of spindle elongation when their spindle elongated along the correct mother-daughter cell axis (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C and D</a>). Furthermore, deletion of <i>BFA1</i> was lethal in <i>spc72\u2206</i> cells (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), indicating that these cells require SPOC function for survival. Thus, despite the loss of Bfa1 phosphorylation by Kin4, disruption of Bfa1-Spc72 interaction by means of <i>SPC72</i> deletion did not compromise the ability of cells with misaligned spindles to engage SPOC arrest."

We therefore asked whether Cdc5 phosphorylation of Bfa1 is blocked in the absence of <i>SPC72</i>. In order to examine Bfa1 phosphorylation by Cdc5, we assessed Bfa1 migration on SDS page gels. Bfa1 becomes hyper-phosphorylated by Cdc5 in <i>kin4</i>\u2206 cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>) (<a href=\"#bib54\">Maekawa et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Pereira and Schiebel, 2005</a>).

As Spc72-Bfa1 interaction is disrupted during the SPOC arrest, we reasoned that the disassociation of Bfa1 from Spc72 might be required to prevent the inhibitory phosphorylation of Bfa1 by Cdc5. To test this hypothesis, we constructed cells bearing endogenous <i>SPC72</i> C-terminally fused with the GFP-binding protein (GBP). GBP efficiently binds GFP or GFP tagged proteins in human and yeast cells (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bertazzi et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Rothbauer et al., 2008</a>). Spc72-GBP constitutively recruited Bfa1-GFP to both SPBs regardless of the spindle position (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). Emphasizing the importance of Spc72-Bfa1 disengagement for SPOC, coexistence of Bfa1-GFP and Spc72-GBP in the same cell resulted in SPOC failure (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). We further analyzed the phosphorylation profile of Bfa1-GFP in these cells. In the presence of Spc72-GBP, Bfa1-GFP accumulated hyper-phosphorylated forms, which disappeared upon depletion of Cdc5 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>, lanes 3\u00a0,4 and 5). Thus, persistence of Spc72-Bfa1 interaction provokes Cdc5 dependent phosphorylation of Bfa1. Importantly, Kin4 also contributed to the phosphorylation of Bfa1-GFP in Spc72-GBP cells, as deletion of <i>KIN4</i> reduced the hyper-phosphorylated forms of Bfa1 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>, lanes 4 and 6). Our data suggests a model where Bfa1 dissociates from Spc72 to prevent the inhibitory phosphorylation of Bfa1 by Cdc5 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>)."

However, in contrast to <i>kar9\u2206</i> cells, SPOC deficient phenotypes (multiple spindles and/or buds) accumulate with a high frequency (&gt; 40%) in <i>spc72\u2206</i> cultures (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib31\">Hoepfner et al., 2002</a>). This was somehow puzzling considering that the SPOC was functional in <i>spc72\u2206</i> cells (as shown above through the\u00a0mitotic exit delay\u00a0upon spindle misalignment) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). To understand why SPOC deficient phenotypes accumulated in these populations, we analyzed the behavior of <i>spc72\u2206 GFP-TUB1</i> cells by live cell imaging in greater detail. We monitored the time from anaphase onset until spindle re-alignment. In a <i>kar9\u2206</i> population most of the cells reoriented their spindle in less than 50\u2009min after anaphase onset. In contrast, spindle mis-orientation persisted for longer than 50\u2009min in the majority of <i>spc72\u2206</i> cells (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>). The spindles of <i>spc72\u2206</i> cells that remained arrested in anaphase for an extended period (&gt; 50\u2009min) broke down as a consequence of mitotic exit (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a> and <a href=\"#fig6\">6D</a>). These cells re-entered the cell cycle to become binucleate cells (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a>). This indicated that the SPOC was unable to maintain an indefinite cell cycle arrest in this population of cells. Interestingly, in the majority of binucleated cells that entered anaphase (10 out of 15 cells), one spindle remained in the mother cell compartment while the second entered the bud (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a>, upper panel). In all such cells, the mother-bud oriented spindle and the misoriented spindle disassembled simultaneously, as the cells exited mitosis (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D and E</a>). This behavior was not due to binucleation per se, because cells harboring two mis-oriented spindles remained arrested in late anaphase with intact anaphase spindles (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a>, lower panel, and <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E</a>). This indicates that satisfaction of the SPOC by the correctly aligned spindle triggers a dominant signal that silences or bypasses the SPOC throughout the cell. This signal is likely to be a diffusible signal as the breakdown of the correctly aligned and misaligned nuclei occurs simultaneously."

One hallmark of SPOC activation is the drastic loss of Bfa1-Bub2 molecules from one of the two SPBs upon spindle mis-positioning. This change is essential for SPOC function and is thought to arise from a decrease in Bfa1-Bub2 residence time at SPBs (<a href=\"#bib14\">Caydasi and Pereira, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Monje-Casas and Amon, 2009</a>). In this study, we investigated how Bfa1-Bub2 interacts with SPBs by FRET microscopy. Our findings unraveled a novel molecular rearrangement of SPOC proteins at SPBs that is essential for SPOC function. In addition, the analysis of binucleated cells showed that the SPOC is switched off as soon as one spindle enters the bud. This indicates the generation of a dominant and diffusible signal that promotes mitotic exit and SPOC silencing upon checkpoint satisfaction."

This indicates that the fluorophore-fused proteins are in close proximity and likely to physically interact (<a href=\"#bib90\">Zal and Gascoigne, 2004</a>). Interactions between SPB core components have been previously mapped by conventional FRET based on acceptor emission measurements (sensitized emission FRET) (<a href=\"#bib61\">Muller et al., 2005</a>). In comparison to sensitized emission FRET, acceptor photobleaching FRET yielded more robust measurements for Bfa1-Bub2 SPB interactions. Our FRET data show that the C-terminal domain of Bfa1 resides in close proximity to the C-termini of the \u03b3-tubulin receptor protein Spc72 and the MEN scaffold protein Nud1 at the SPB outer plaque. Direct physical interaction of Nud1 and Bfa1 was already shown (<a href=\"#bib30\">Gruneberg et al., 2000</a>). In vitro binding assays performed here established that Bfa1 also associates with Spc72. Thus, FRET interactions between Bfa1-Nud1 and Bfa1-Spc72 most likely reflect physical interactions at SPBs in vivo. C-terminally tagged Bfa1 also yielded positive FRET with N-terminally tagged Bub2 at SPBs, which is in agreement with the fact that Bfa1 and Bub2 bind to SPBs as a bipartite complex (<a href=\"#bib14\">Caydasi and Pereira, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Pereira et al., 2000</a>).

The loss of FRET signal between Bfa1 and Spc72 might indicate the physical separation of the two proteins or only the separation of the fluorophores coupled to Bfa1 and Spc72 C-termini. Forced binding of Bfa1 to Spc72 resulted in loss of SPOC activity, suggesting that dissociation of the two proteins is important for checkpoint functioning. Our data show that Kin4 kinase and the 14-3-3 protein Bmh1 are involved in this process. Loss of Bfa1-Spc72 FRET interaction during spindle misalignment was only observed in <i>KIN4</i> but not in <i>kin4</i>\u2206 cells. Furthermore, overexpression of <i>KIN4</i> abolished the FRET signal between Bfa1 and Spc72 in cells with normal aligned anaphase spindles in a Bmh1-dependent manner. We propose that the remodeling of Bfa1-SPB binding is triggered by Kin4 phosphorylation of Bfa1. As a direct consequence of this phosphorylation, Bmh1 binds to Bfa1 and breaks Bfa1-Spc72 proximity (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>) (<a href=\"#bib13\">Caydasi et al., 2014</a>). The reorganization of Bfa1-SPB binding may result from a possible Bfa1 conformational change triggered by recruitment of Bmh1 to Kin4 phosphorylated Bfa1.

Surprisingly, <i>spc72</i>\u2206 cells were SPOC proficient even though Kin4 neither localized at SPBs nor phosphorylated Bfa1. However, Cdc5-dependent hyper-phosphorylation of Bfa1, which inactivates the Bfa1-Bub2 GAP complex (<a href=\"#bib26\">Geymonat et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Hu et al., 2001</a>), was greatly reduced in the absence of <i>SPC72</i>. The loss of Bfa1 phosphorylation by Cdc5 in the absence of Spc72 probably explains why the SPOC is still functional in these cells despite the lack of Kin4 phosphorylation of Bfa1. Given that Cdc5 interacts with Spc72 and phosphorylates Bfa1 at the SPB (<a href=\"#bib2\">Archambault and Glover, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Maekawa et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Park et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Snead et al., 2007</a>), it is tempting to speculate that Cdc5 only phosphorylates Bfa1 when in complex with Spc72. In this case, disruption of the Bfa1-Spc72 interaction in cells with mis-oriented spindles might be a way to insulate the GAP complex from being inhibited by Cdc5 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). We tested this model using <i>BFA1-GFP SPC72-GBP</i> cells where Spc72-Bfa1 interaction is maintained even during spindle misalignment. In support of our model, Bfa1-Spc72 tethering caused increased phosphorylation of Bfa1 by Cdc5 and hence SPOC failure. Interestingly, phosphorylation of Bfa1 by Kin4 was also observed in these cells. This indicates that Kin4 can only inhibit Bfa1 phosphorylation by Cdc5 if Bfa1 dissociates from Spc72. This is in line with the observation that Bfa1 phosphorylated by Kin4 is still a substrate of Cdc5 in vitro (<a href=\"#bib54\">Maekawa et al., 2007</a>). We therefore propose that Spc72 acts as a scaffold protein that coordinates the regulation of the checkpoint effector Bfa1 by both Kin4 and Cdc5 kinases in cells with mis-aligned spindle."

This raises the question of how Bfa1 associates with these proteins at the SPB. Bfa1 could bind separately or simultaneously to Nud1 and Spc72. The analysis of <i>spc72\u2206</i> cells exclude the possibility of a stable Bfa1-Spc72 and a dynamic Bfa1-Nud1 pool co-existing at SPBs since Bfa1 still associated with SPBs via Nud1 in a stable manner in <i>spc72\u2206</i> cells with correctly aligned spindles. Interestingly, in <i>spc72\u2206</i> cells with mis-aligned spindles, Bfa1 became dynamic, yet not as much as in wild type cells but similar to <i>kin4\u2206</i> cells. This observation is important two-fold: First, it indicates that the Bfa1 binding site of Nud1 functions efficiently without Spc72. Second, it suggests that the main function of Spc72 is not in Bfa1 binding to the SPB but instead in the SPB recruitment of Kin4, which then regulates Bfa1 SPB dynamics through phosphorylation of Bfa1 as discussed above."

If this is the case, the binding affinity of Bfa1 to Nud1 must be higher than to Spc72. This would explain why the loss of Spc72 does not significantly influence Bfa1 protein levels and binding dynamics at SPBs. However, alternative scenarios might also explain why Bfa1 has the same SPB binding behavior in wild type and <i>spc72\u2206</i> cells with properly aligned spindles. For example, an adaptation mechanism that activates an additional SPB binding site for Bfa1 at SPBs may compensate for the loss of Spc72 or Bfa1 might not directly bind to Spc72 in vivo. We consider the latter possibility as unlikely because of the positive Bfa1-Spc72 FRET signal at the SPB, demonstrating the very close neighborhood of both proteins at this organelle. Moreover, we observed changes in Bfa1-Spc72 FRET signal that are consistent with previous dynamic measurements of Bfa1 in response to spindle alignment defects or <i>KIN4</i> overexpression. In any case, further biochemical and biophysical studies will be necessary to evaluate the affinity of Bfa1 towards Nud1 and Spc72, and to establish whether the same Bfa1 molecule can bind simultaneously to Nud1 and Spc72."

However, our data indicate that Bfa1 asymmetry is maintained even when Spc72 is absent through stable binding to Nud1. In addition, randomization of SPB inheritance (through transient microtubule depolymerization) did not alter the asymmetric association of Bfa1 with the dSPB (<a href=\"#bib38\">Juanes et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Pereira et al., 2001</a>). Furthermore, our FRET analyses show that, in cells with normal aligned spindles, Bfa1 is still in close proximity to Spc72 and Nud1 at both SPBs. We thus consider it as unlikely that the asymmetric SPB binding of Bfa1-Bub2 arises from association of Bfa1 with different receptors at mother and daughter SPBs."

In <i>kar9</i>\u2206 cells, this is a relatively rare event because the spindle is able to realign quickly in the majority of the cells due to the presence of the alternative dynein-dependent spindle alignment pathway (<a href=\"#bib19\">Eshel et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Li et al., 1993</a>). This situation is however different in <i>spc72</i>\u2206 cells. Lack of functional cytoplasmic microtubules impairs spindle realignment in the majority of the <i>spc72</i>\u2206 cells. As a consequence of this long cell cycle arrest, we frequently observed SPOC slippage and accumulation of multi-nucleated cells. Our data is consistent with a previous report that analyzed the cell cycle progression of binucleated yeast cells lacking cytoplasmic microtubules (<a href=\"#bib80\">Sullivan and Huffaker, 1992</a>). By following <i>spc72</i>\u2206 cells that underwent SPOC slippage and became multinucleated, we observed a novel phenomenon in yeast mitotic exit: In cells with two misaligned anaphase spindles, realignment of one spindle was sufficient to trigger mitotic exit in both misaligned and correctly aligned nuclei. A similar phenomenon was described in binucleated budding yeast cells obtained by other means (<a href=\"#bib21\">Falk et al., 2016</a>). This observation indicates that a dominant mitotic exit signal is generated after spindle entry into the bud. This is likely a diffusible signal as it almost simultaneously affects the other nuclei that still reside in the mother cell compartment with a misaligned spindle."

Daughter cell specific factors, such as the putative Tem1 guanine nucleotide exchange factor Lte1 (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adames et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bardin et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Keng et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Pereira et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Shirayama et al., 1994</a>) could trigger the MEN to initiate mitotic exit in the bud. Active GTP-bound Tem1 would then fully activate the phosphatase Cdc14 that in turn counteracts and decreases the activity of mitotic cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) to promote mitotic exit and cytokinesis (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bardin and Amon, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Meitinger et al., 2012</a>). In this case, Tem1 activation in the daughter cell followed by mitotic Cdk1 down-regulation would bypass the SPOC in the mother cell compartment (SPOC bypassing mechanism). Interestingly, Lte1 is also a Kin4 inhibitor (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bertazzi et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Falk et al., 2011</a>), implying that bud specific factors may promote MEN activation through inhibition of SPOC components (SPOC silencing). SPOC silencing can also occur at the level of Bfa1-Bub2.\u00a0Cdc5 was proposed to inhibit Bfa1-Bub2 GAP activity in cells with normal aligned spindle (<a href=\"#bib24\">Geymonat et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Hu and Elledge, 2002</a>). However, it is likely that factors other than Cdc5 inactivate Bfa1-Bub2 in the daughter cell compartment. Two observations support this notion. We found that Bfa1-Bub2 was not efficiently phosphorylated by Cdc5 in <i>spc72</i>\u2206 cells, yet these cells did not have a delayed mitotic exit when their mitotic spindle was correctly aligned. In addition, a mutant form of Bfa1 (Bfa1-11A), which cannot be phosphorylated by Cdc5, does not cause a delayed mitotic exit (<a href=\"#bib35\">Hu et al., 2001</a>). Mathematical modeling also predicted the existence of an additional Bfa1-Bub2 inhibitory mechanism (<a href=\"#bib12\">Caydasi et al., 2012</a>). Indeed, the Cdc42 effector protein Gic1 was shown to directly bind to Bub2 and inhibit its interaction with Tem1 (<a href=\"#bib32\">Hofken and Schiebel, 2004</a>). Our study thus re-invigorates the concept that cell polarity associated factors play a critical role in SPOC silencing and mitotic exit (<a href=\"#bib33\">Hofken and Schiebel, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Monje-Casas and Amon, 2009</a>). The molecular characterization of these factors, which were undermined in the last decade, will be critical to shed light onto the mechanisms controlling mitotic exit and/or SPOC silencing."

Analogously, in mammalian cells with two mitotic spindles, the stop-anaphase signal generated by the SAC at one of the two spindles was not sufficient to sustain the checkpoint arrest if the checkpoint was satisfied at the neighboring spindle (<a href=\"#bib68\">Rieder et al., 1997</a>). Similar observations were made for G2-M checkpoint in binucleated plant cells (<a href=\"#bib16\">del Campo et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Gimenez-Abian et al., 2001</a>). Therefore, local satisfaction of checkpoints seems to be sufficient for global checkpoint silencing in binucleated cells. Interestingly, cytokinesis defects often generate binucleation, which is associated with aneuploidy and tumor formation. We postulate that misbalanced checkpoint integrity in binucleated cells might be a driver for genome instability and cancer development."

SPOC is a critical checkpoint mechanism that regulates mitotic exit (i.e. upstream of mitotic exit network, MEN) depending on the state of spindle positioning within the cell to ensure correct segregation of two nuclei into two daughter cells. An elegant series of FRET experiments are used to assess the association of Bfa1 with the SPB components Nud1 and Spc72. The data show that Bfa1 simultaneously associates with Spc72 and Nud1 but that it is the association with Spc72 that alters in the SPOC dependent manner."

The correlative nature of FRET data is now mentioned in the text (subsection \u201cSPOC activation disturbs Bfa1-Spc72 interaction through Kin4/Bmh1 branch of the SPOC\u201d, last paragraph). We now performed additional experiments to test the functional significance of the change in Bfa1-Spc72 FRET and also to test the model that dissociation of Bfa1 from Spc72 prevents inhibitory phosphorylation of Bfa1 by Cdc5. As suggested by the reviewers, we manipulated Spc72-Bfa1 interaction so that Bfa1 remained constitutively bound to Spc72. For this, we expressed <i>BFA1-GFP</i> in cells carrying Spc72 fused to the GFP-binding protein (GBP). In the presence of Spc72-GBP, Bfa1-GFP localized at both SPBs independently of the spindle position. We show that <i>BFA1-GFP SPC72-GBP</i> cells were SPOC deficient, indicating the functional significance of remodeling Bfa1-Spc72 interaction upon spindle misalignment. We also show that Bfa1-GFP became hyperphosphorylated in nocodazole-treated <i>SPC72-GBP</i> but not in <i>SPC72</i> cells. Depletion of <i>CDC5</i> greatly reduced the Bfa1-GFP hyperphosphorylation in <i>SPC72-GBP</i> cells, establishing the contribution of Bfa1-Spc72 interaction to Cdc5 phosphorylation of Bfa1. <i>KIN4</i> also phosphorylated Bfa1-GFP in <i>SPC72-GBP</i> cells. These data indicate that Kin4 and Cdc5 phosphorylate Bfa1 upon SPOC activation, if Bfa1 remains constitutively bound to Spc72. These new data support our model and are now shown in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>, explained in the subsection \u201cBfa1-Spc72 interaction enhances Bfa1 phosphorylation by Cdc5 and Kin4\u201d and discussed in the subsection \u201cThe \u03b3-tubulin complex receptor Spc72 coordinates activation and inhibition of Bfa1- Bub2\u201d.
