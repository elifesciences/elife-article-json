How the nervous system solves this problem is an important question, because many neurological disorders may be the result of bad wiring between neurons in the fetal brain."

In sensory isocortex the vast majority of spontaneous activity is not generated locally, but rather in the peripheral sense organ (<a href=\"#bib34\">Khazipov et al., 2013a</a>). For example, prior to vision the retina generates waves of spontaneous firing that refine receptive field characteristics in visual thalamus and cortex\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib28\">Huberman et al., 2008</a>). Retinal waves drive robust firing in LGN, superior colliculus, and VC (<a href=\"#bib2\">Ackman and Crair, 2014</a>) through a complex interaction between these structures (<a href=\"#bib56\">Weliky and Katz, 1999</a>) that remains poorly understood. In the retina, transient circuit properties are responsible for wave propagation, most prominently hyper-connectivity of starburst amacrine cells (<a href=\"#bib9\">Blankenship and Feller, 2010</a>), but the degree to which the central transmission of retinal waves, or spontaneous activity in other systems, requires similar specializations is unknown."

For example, the relative amplification of ganglion cell spiking in developing thalamocortical circuits is approximately 40-fold that of the adult (<a href=\"#bib15\">Colonnese et al., 2010</a>). Evidence of similar amplification is observed in late second and early third trimester human neonates (born preterm), who show sensory-evoked and spontaneous EEG events that are paradoxically large, reaching amplitudes of over 1 millivolt, compared to microvolts in adults (<a href=\"#bib55\">Vanhatalo and Kaila, 2006</a>). These strong neonatal activities persist despite low synaptic density (5\u201310% of the adult) (<a href=\"#bib3\">Aggelopoulos et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Bourgeois and Rakic, 1993</a>), weak individual synapses (<a href=\"#bib12\">Chen and Regehr, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Etherington and Williams, 2011</a>), and poor action-potential reliability (<a href=\"#bib44\">McCormick and Prince, 1987</a>). Not only is retinal wave activity amplified in the thalamocortical pathway, it is also transformed into synchronized rapid oscillations that enhance propagation and synaptic plasticity (<a href=\"#bib35\">Khazipov et al., 2013b</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Luhmann et al., 2016</a>). Cortical activity during the period of retinal waves follows nearly exactly the macro-patterning of retinal activity: periods of silence lasting 30\u201360 s are interrupted by 500 ms\u20132 s waves that occur in clusters lasting up to 10 s (<a href=\"#bib25\">Hanganu et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Colonnese and Khazipov, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Ackman et al., 2012</a>). However, the cortical activity within waves is organized in rapid \u2018spindle-burst\u2019 oscillations (8\u201330 Hz) (<a href=\"#bib25\">Hanganu et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Kummer et al., 2016</a>) that are not present in retina and not observed in adult cortical activity, suggesting transitory early circuit properties are responsible for their production (<a href=\"#bib53\">Tolner et al., 2012</a>). Spindle-bursts are not limited to VC, but are ubiquitous throughout neonatal cortex. They are the rodent homologue of delta-brushes (<a href=\"#bib34\">Khazipov et al., 2013a</a>), one of the major components of the human preterm EEG (<a href=\"#bib5\">Andr\u00e9 et al., 2010</a>), and their absence in patients indicates a poor prognosis. Thus understanding their central generative mechanisms would be a critical contribution to neonatal health and development."

To test this we recorded simultaneously from LGN and primary VC of head-fixed, unanesthetized rats both during the period of retinal waves (P5-11), and immediately after (P13-14), when mature cortical activity patterns have begun to emerge (<a href=\"#bib49\">Rochefort et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Colonnese, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Hoy and Niell, 2015</a>). We investigated the relative roles of retina, thalamus and cortex by pharmacological or optogenetic modulation of each region. Our results demonstrate a developmentally unique role for the corticothalamic projection that results from the late development of inhibition relative to excitation, and is necessary for the propagation and synchronization of retinal wave-driven activity through thalamus and cortex."

Activity within these active periods consisted of spindle-shaped oscillations in the local field potential (LFP) in superficial layers with a primary frequency of 20.8 \u00b1 0.8 Hz (n = 7, mean \u00b1 SEM) and elevated MUA in all layers (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D,H</a>). Activity in LGN had a similar structure: 5\u201310 s periods of spiking activity alternating with periods of low or absent spiking (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Because the amplitude of the LGN LFP was lower than the median spike amplitude, it was not analyzed further. To determine if the spindle-burst oscillations observed in VC originate in LGN, we quantified the frequency modulation of LGN MUA. Spike-rate modulation in LGN showed a primary frequency of 23.1 \u00b1 0.6 Hz (n = 7) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>), similar to VC. Thus, spindle-burst oscillations are also observed in LGN. Combined with the absence of significant oscillatory ganglion cell firing during waves (<a href=\"#bib16\">Colonnese and Khazipov, 2010</a>), and the location of the VC spindle-bursts\u2019 current sink in the input layer, this data supports a thalamic origin of spindle-burst oscillations."

We therefore tested the hypothesis that VC provides critical amplification and transformation of the retinal input in LGN by silencing VC with local application of APV and CNQX\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). Silencing VC at P9-11 during the peak of stage III waves reduces LGN spike-rate by 79.2 \u00b1 5.6% and continuity by 68.4 \u00b1 9.3%\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D2</a>). Remarkably, these activity reductions are of similar magnitude to those caused by retinal silencing. The fact that silencing of either retina or VC results in a greater than 50% reduction in firing indicates that they act synergistically to drive LGN. One explanation is that VC participates in feedback amplification as part of an excitatory loop with LGN that is necessary for the generation of effective thalamic spiking during retinal waves. The effect of VC silencing was limited to the LGN; spike-rates for all contacts from the same shank located 20\u2013100\u00a0\u00b5m below the last visually responsive contact were not affected\u00a0(+3.1 \u00b1 17.1%, p=1.000, n\u00a0=\u00a06, Wilcoxon signed rank test), indicating that the pharmacological silencing of VC did not have systemic effects. Event duration was reduced, but not as severely altered as by retinal silencing\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D5</a>), indicating that retina initiates and maintains activity in LGN, but VC prolongs it. Silencing VC strongly reduced normalized spike spectral power in the spindle-burst range\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D3</a>). VC input appears to be required for normal patterning of the spindle-oscillations, as peak frequency of remaining activity shifted from 24.6 \u00b1 0.9 to 16.2 \u00b1 2.0\u00a0Hz\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D4</a>) after VC silencing. These results show that during the period of peak stage III retinal waves, feedback connections from VC to LGN are a critical component of retinal wave transmission, which serve to both amplify and prolong spontaneous activity as well as accelerate spindle-burst oscillations in LGN."

Before vision, when spontaneous retinal waves instruct circuit formation\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib28\">Huberman et al., 2008</a>), the corticothalamic projection provides excitatory feedback amplification to thalamus. Although retina initiates activity in central visual circuits, retinal waves alone provide as little as 20% of the total drive. Corticothalamic feedback amplification accounts for the remaining 80%, effectively gating transmission of retinal waves in thalamus. During the second post-natal week corticothalamic excitation not only amplifies, but also synchronizes, thalamic firing, effectively conditioning its own input. Our results show that the transmission of early spontaneous activity is not simply feed-forward, and that feedback circuits can have specialized developmental properties that ensure the reliable transmission of early activity from the periphery to the cortex. The mechanism is the delayed development of inhibitory recruitment by the corticothalamic projection. This is a common observation in developing circuits\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib40\">Le Magueresse and Monyer, 2013</a>), yet the functional significance has been difficult to prove."

Neither VC alone, nor an intact LGN-VC loop, is capable of producing more than brief bursts of activity. In contrast, without VC, firing in LGN is dramatically reduced but sustained activity is still present. Only the longest events\u2014caused by sustained firing between waves occurring in a cluster\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib9\">Blankenship and Feller, 2010</a>)\u2014are suppressed by VC silencing, demonstrating that corticothalamic feedback maintains activity during waves but does not initiate activity.

Almost all activity in early VC, as well as every other cortical region examined, occurs as rapid oscillations necessary for synaptic stabilization in the developing circuit\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib34\">Khazipov et al., 2013a</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"#bib35\">2013b</a>). Determining the similarities and differences between the cortical areas in how these rhythms are generated will inform our understanding of how regional specialization develops. In all areas, rapid oscillations occur in response to spontaneous and evoked firing of the dominant input (eg. whisker in barrel cortex), with a frequency inversely proportional to its temporal and spatial specificity\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib35\">Khazipov et al., 2013b</a>). Here we identify LGN as the locus of generation of VC spindle-bursts, similar to somatosensory (VPN) thalamus\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib57\">Yang et al., 2013a</a>). Unlike VPN, corticothalamic feedback plays a critical role for setting the frequency and amplitude of LGN firing. During the first post-natal week, corticothalamic connections are capable of directly driving LGN, but only at long latency and with poor reliability, consistent with their low density in LGN at this age\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib50\">Seabrook et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Grant et al., 2016</a>), and they are not necessary for rhythmogenesis. How spindle-bursts are generated in LGN is unknown, but likely involves a combination of functional connectivity with the thalamic reticular nucleus\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib23\">Evrard and Ropert, 2009</a>) and intrinsic excitability of relay neurons\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib41\">Lo et al., 2002</a>). Between the first and second post-natal weeks, roughly synchronized to the switch between cholinergic and glutamatergic waves\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib28\">Huberman et al., 2008</a>), the timing and reliability of corticothalamic connectivity improves, changing its role from simple amplification to synchronization and rhythmogenesis. LGN can still generate its own weak (15\u00a0Hz) oscillations in the first week, but it requires VC to generate normal (25\u00a0Hz) activity in the second week. Because corticothalamic projections are only capable of synchronizing LGN at these frequencies at this age (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>), and L5/6 neurons are synchronized by the spindle-oscillations\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib16\">Colonnese and Khazipov, 2010</a>), we suggest that the faster spindle-burst oscillations are generated in the feedback circuit between the two structures."

VC EGOs do not occur in response to retinal waves, but can be induced by visual stimulation\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib15\">Colonnese et al., 2010</a>), allowing us to examine their cortical dependence. While LGN spiking during the period of EGOs was reduced by VC silencing, the normalized oscillation power was unaffected, suggesting that VC provides amplification but not rhythmogenesis for EGOs. Poor modulation of EGOs by corticothalamic projections is consistent with the conduction delays (&gt;20\u00a0ms) and lack of L5/6 firing during EGOs\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib15\">Colonnese et al., 2010</a>) which should prevent corticothalamic projections from contributing to such rapid synchronization of LGN.

This principle may apply to other modulatory feedback projections, such as intra-cortical feedback, which largely synapse on interneurons and develop later than feedforward connections\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib7\">Berezovskii et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Yang et al., 2013b</a>).

Long\u2013Evans female rats with litters at postnatal day 4\u00a0(P4, birth P0), or pregnant female rats at embryonic day 11\u201319, were acquired from Hilltop Lab Animals (Scottdale, PA) and housed at one litter per cage on a 12 hr light 12 hr dark cycle. Both males and females were used. No formal sorting or randomization of subjects was applied, and experiments and analysis was not blind to age or treatment. Eyelid opening occurred between P13 and P14.

Topical lidocaine (2.5%) and systemic Carprofen (5 mg/kg) were used as analgesic pre-operatively. To place the headplate, under isoflurane anesthesia (3% induction, 1.5\u20132% maintenance, verified by toe pinch), the scalp was resected, the skull was cleaned, and a stainless plate with a hole was placed so that the region over occipital cortex was accessible, and the plate was fixed with dental cement. The pups were monitored for signs of stress after recovery from anesthesia. For recording, the animal was head-fixed, and the body was supported within a padded enclosure and warmed with an electric blanket. Temperature was monitored with a thermocouple placed under the abdomen and maintained at 34\u201336\u00b0C. Movement was detected using a piezo-based detector placed under the enclosure. For VC recording, the skull above the monocular primary visual cortex was thinned, and the monocular primary visual cortex was targeted with the following coordinates: 0.5\u20131.0 mm anterior from the lambda suture, and 2.5\u20133.0\u00a0(P5-7), 2.8\u20133.3\u00a0(P9-11), or 3.0\u20133.5\u00a0(P13-14) mm lateral from <i>lambda.</i> Co-ordinates for LGN were 2.0\u20132.5\u00a0mm anterior and 3.0\u20133.5\u00a0mm lateral\u00a0(p5-7), 2.3\u20132.8\u00a0mm anterior and 3.3\u20133.8\u00a0mm lateral\u00a0(p9-11), or 2.5\u20133.0\u00a0mm anterior and 3.5\u20134.0\u00a0mm lateral from the lambda\u00a0(p13-14). Extracellular activity was recorded using single shank linear multi-electrode arrays\u00a0(NeuroNexus, MI). A combination of linear \u2018edge\u2019 arrays with 100 or 20 \u00b5m separation or \u2018Poly2\u2019 design of two parallel rows with 50 um separation were used. Electrodes were coated with DiI\u00a0(Life Technologies, CA) before insertion for histological verification of electrode location. In animals older than P8, recording was initiated only after verifying that contralateral visual evoked firing on presumptive LGN electrodes preceded that of V1 electrodes (three animals were not recorded for this reason).

Post-mortem reconstruction of the electrode tract was used to verify placement within central dLGN or monocular V1\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>) by reference to a developmental atlas (<a href=\"#bib36\">Khazipov et al., 2015</a>).

An Ag/AgCl wire was placed over right frontal cortex\u00a0(~1 mm posterior and 3 mm lateral to <i>bregma</i>) as ground. Electrical signals were digitized using the Neuralynx\u00a0(Bozeman, MT) Digital Lynx S hardware with Cheetah\u00a0(v5.5) software. dEEG signals were band-pass filtered between 0.1\u00a0Hz to 9\u00a0kHz, and digitized at 32 kHz. Cortical recordings were referenced to a contact site located in underlying white matter. LGN recordings were referenced to a contact just dorsal to LGN. MUA was extracted by threshold crossing of \u221250 \u00b5V following 300\u00a0Hz\u20139 kHz band-pass.

In particular, during the early postnatal period (first two weeks after birth) in rodents there is a distinct mode of thalamocortical network activation with sensory spindles occurring during spontaneous activity (retinal waves) in sensory organs. In this report the authors use silicon probe recordings from dLGN and VC in unanesthetized animal, and make several key observations: 1) early cortical spindles are dependent on thalamic relay of sensory information, 2) corticothalamic feedback produces a very powerful amplification of the sensory signal arising from spontaneous retinal waves, 3) this reinforcement of thalamic activity by cortical feedback during early development disappears later when retinal waves no longer occur, 4) the loss of reinforcement coincided with the development of feedforward inhibition, and 5) the latter appears to be due to cortical recruitment of thalamic inhibition, as inhibitory responses in LGN can be produced by optogenetic activation of deep layer VC neurons."

The experiments are well designed, the data are of high quality and the results are really exciting and beautifully presented. The paper is a pleasure to read and reports several important new results that are likely to be very influential in the field. The main finding that the corticothalamic feedback has a net excitatory effect on LGN at early developmental states and only switches to inhibitory at the end of the postnatal second week (around eye opening) is very interesting and supported by strong and convincing data. Multiple other findings reported in this paper are also interesting and novel. To choose just one example, the finding that silencing the visual cortex reduces LGN activity just as much as silencing of the retina in the Discussion is very interesting and important."
