We show that the <i>cis</i> golgin GMAP-210 accounts for this property. First, the liposome tethering properties of the Golgi resembles that of the amphipathic lipid-packing sensor (ALPS) motif of GMAP-210: both preferred small (radius &lt; 40 nm) liposomes made of monounsaturated but not saturated lipids. Second, reducing GMAP-210 levels or redirecting its ALPS motif to mitochondria decreased liposome capture by the Golgi. Extensive mutagenesis analysis suggests that GMAP-210 tethers authentic transport vesicles <i>via</i> the same mechanism whereby the ALPS motif senses lipid-packing defects at the vesicle surface through its regularly spaced hydrophobic residues. We conclude that the Golgi uses GMAP-210 as a filter to select transport vesicles according to their size and bulk lipid composition."

We show that the <i>cis</i> golgin GMAP-210 accounts for this property. First, the liposome tethering properties of the Golgi resembles that of the amphipathic lipid-packing sensor (ALPS) motif of GMAP-210: both preferred small (radius &lt; 40 nm) liposomes made of monounsaturated but not saturated lipids. Second, reducing GMAP-210 levels or redirecting its ALPS motif to mitochondria decreased liposome capture by the Golgi. Extensive mutagenesis analysis suggests that GMAP-210 tethers authentic transport vesicles <i>via</i> the same mechanism whereby the ALPS motif senses lipid-packing defects at the vesicle surface through its regularly spaced hydrophobic residues. We conclude that the Golgi uses GMAP-210 as a filter to select transport vesicles according to their size and bulk lipid composition."

Between these two elementary steps, various protein machineries control the fate of transport vesicles. These include molecular motors for long-range transport and tethering complexes, which trap vesicles in the vicinity of their destination organelle (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cai et al., 2007</a>)."

Through their string-like structure whose length might approach 300 nm, they have been proposed to form a matrix to tether transport vesicles in the vicinity of Golgi cisternae, while excluding some large particles such as ribosomes (<a href=\"#bib35\">Malsam et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Brown and Pfeffer, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Munro, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Witkos and Lowe, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Gillingham and Munro, 2016</a>). In addition, recent work based on the artificial attachment of golgins to mitochondria indicates that golgins provide a first layer of vesicle selectivity (<a href=\"#bib54\">Wong and Munro, 2014</a>). Golgins that are normally anchored on the <i>cis</i> side of the Golgi preferentially capture vesicles trafficking between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the <i>cis</i> Golgi, whereas those that are normally anchored at the <i>trans</i> side preferentially capture vesicles from endosomal sources. Although the molecular determinants responsible for this selectivity are not well known, discrete binding sites for Rab proteins have been identified along the coiled-coils of golgins, suggesting a mechanism by which vesicles move within the golgin matrix by transient Rab-coiled-coil contacts (<a href=\"#bib46\">Sinka et al., 2008</a>). EM and atomic force microscopy show that the coiled-coil architecture of golgins is interrupted by regions of high flexibility, which might facilitate the movement of trapped vesicles (<a href=\"#bib13\">Cheung et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Ishida et al., 2015</a>)."

However, other factors related to bulk physicochemical properties of membranes such as membrane curvature, electrostatics and lipid packing also play a role (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bigay and Antonny, 2012</a>). In the case of vesicle tethering at the Golgi, Kobayashi and Pagano reported in 1988 a puzzling observation (<a href=\"#bib30\">Kobayashi and Pagano, 1988</a>). When liposomes made of pure lipids were incubated with perforated cells, they bound almost exclusively to the Golgi and not to any other organelle. Binding was fast, occurred at 4\u00b0C, did not require ATP, and was observed with simple lipid compositions such as pure egg phosphatidylcholine (PC). In the presence of ATP and at temperature above 15\u00b0C, liposome binding was followed by membrane fusion and delivery of the liposome content to the Golgi. Interestingly, the authors noticed that liposomes with a small radius (R &lt; 40 nm) were targeted more efficiently to the Golgi than larger ones (<a href=\"#bib30\">Kobayashi and Pagano, 1988</a>). Together, these observations suggest that the Golgi has a superior ability to capture small vesicles than any other organelle because of an unexplained avidity for curved lipid membranes."

GMAP-210, which controls vesicle traffic at the <i>cis</i> side of the Golgi (<a href=\"#bib43\">Roboti et al., 2015</a>), contains an N-terminal ALPS motif [1\u201338], several long coiled-coil regions, a GRAB domain [1774\u20131843], and a region of low complexity [1844\u20131979]. ALPS motifs are amphipathic helices that adsorb preferentially onto highly curved membranes containing unsaturated lipids (<a href=\"#bib17\">Drin et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Drin and Antonny, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Antonny, 2011</a>). The GRAB domain interacts with membrane-bound Arf1-GTP (<a href=\"#bib22\">Gillingham et al., 2004</a>). Because the Arf1 regulator ArfGAP1, which hydrolyzes GTP on Arf1, also contains an ALPS motif, the interaction between the GRAB domain and Arf1-GTP is not stable on curved membranes (<a href=\"#bib18\">Drin et al., 2008</a>). Consequently, GMAP-210 tethers small liposomes through its ALPS motif to flatter membranes through its GRAB domain, but other geometrical combinations are not possible (<a href=\"#bib18\">Drin et al., 2008</a>). In a cellular context, this model suggests that GMAP-210 connects transport vesicles to Golgi cisternae on the basis of their contrasting membrane curvature."

First, does GMAP-210 account for the striking avidity of the Golgi for small liposomes? In other words, is GMAP-210 a major vesicle trap? Second, are the amphipathic properties of the ALPS motif of GMAP-210 sufficient to explain the selective tethering of the\u00a0vesicles of the early secretory pathway at the cis-Golgi as opposed to other transport vesicles?"

Second, we interrogate the binding mode of the ALPS motif of GMAP-210 in a cellular context by extensive mutagenesis. We observe that the ALPS motif is very permissive to mutations that should disrupt stereospecific interactions, but is supersensitive to mutations that modify its amphipathic character. Notably, the sparse distribution of hydrophobic residues along the ALPS sequence is key for vesicle recognition. We conclude that the ALPS motif of GMAP-210 acts as a filter at the entrance of the <i>cis</i> Golgi to select transport vesicles of the early secretory pathway based on their small size and high content in unsaturated lipids."

The liposomes contained trace amounts of a red fluorescent lipid (Rhod-PE), whereas the cells stably expressed Rab6-GFP in order to visualize the Golgi area (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). All experiments were performed with no ATP in the medium to minimize liposome fusion. We observed that liposome binding increased strongly with the unsaturation level of PC. Binding was maximal with PC containing two unsaturated acyl chains (C18:1-C18:1-PC = DOPC), barely detectable with PC containing two saturated acyl chains (C14:0-C14:0-PC = DMPC), and intermediate with PC containing one saturated and one monounsaturated acyl chain (C16:0-C18:1-PC = POPC) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Moreover, liposome size had a strong effect on Golgi binding (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Below 50 nm in radius, liposomes bound significantly to the Golgi; above this radius, liposome binding was close to background levels. By calibrating the fluorescence intensity as a function of liposome concentration, we estimated that hundreds of small DOPC liposomes were trapped in the Golgi region of each perforated cell (see Materials\u00a0and methods)."

The cells expressed two constructs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). The first contained the following regions: the ALPS motif of GMAP-210 [1\u201338] to capture small liposomes, an artificial coiled-coil (ACC1) to impose a dimeric architecture (<a href=\"#bib25\">Horchani et al., 2014</a>), a green fluorescent protein (GFP) for visualization, and a FK binding protein (FKBP) for control by rapamycin. The second construct, Mito-FRB, enabled the\u00a0mitochondria attachment of the first construct by rapamycin-induced dimerization (<a href=\"#bib54\">Wong and Munro, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Sato et al., 2015</a>). In addition, we treated the cells with nocodazole, which, by disrupting the microtubules, causes the Golgi to disperse into mini stacks in the cytoplasm. This condition was chosen to increase the probability of liposome exchange between the mitochondria and the Golgi as observed in the case of authentic transport vesicles (<a href=\"#bib54\">Wong and Munro, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Sato et al., 2015</a>). After treatment with nocodazole and with or without rapamycin, the cells were perforated and DOPC liposomes labeled with Rhod-PE were added. Without rapamycin, the ALPS-containing construct and the small liposomes colocalized at Golgi mini stacks as identified by GM130 antibody (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). With rapamycin, colocalization between the ALPS-containing construct and the liposomes remained, but the liposomes and the ALPS construct overlapped better with mitochondria than with the Golgi mini stacks (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Furthermore, only small liposomes but not large liposomes bound to mitochondria through the ALPS-containing construct (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

The two constructs had different coiled-coil regions to prevent the formation of heterodimers (<a href=\"#bib25\">Horchani et al., 2014</a>). Remarkably, ALPS-ACC1-mCherry and invALPS-ACC2-GFP showed exactly the same Golgi localization despite the fact that these constructs were different along their entire sequence. The Pearson\u2019s coefficient between the green and red channels was not only very high (0.75), but also similar to that observed when two coiled-coil constructs harbored an intact ALPS motif (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). These results demonstrate that the strict order of amino acids in the ALPS sequence is not critical for its fine targeting to the Golgi, making the involvement of stereospecific interactions unlikely."

For this, we used a different mutagenesis strategy. Instead of introducing a large number of mutations while keeping the physicochemical properties of the sequence intact, we introduced a minimal number of mutations to disrupt the amphipathic character of the sequence. This included placing a single negatively charged residue in the hydrophobic face (L12D), inserting two alanines to break the regular spacing of polar and non-polar residues (InsAA20), and replacing a glycine by a proline to create a bend (G11P). In all cases, the <i>cis</i>-Golgi localization of the mutated constructs dropped in favor of the cytosolic fraction (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,C</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

As compared to ALPS, the most contrasting amphipathic \u03b1-helix is \u03b1-synuclein, which contains charged residues (K, E) in its polar face and small hydrophobic residues (V, T) in its non-polar face. We previously showed that the opposite traits of ALPS and \u03b1-synuclein correlate with their different subcellular localization (<a href=\"#bib41\">Pranke et al., 2011</a>). However, the exquisite subcellular localization of the ALPS motif of GMAP-210 remains puzzling when compared to that of other amphipathic \u03b1-helices. The N-terminal helices of Arf1 and Sar1, two small G proteins that drive the assembly of protein coats on the ER and the Golgi, are also poor in charged residues (<a href=\"#bib16\">Drin and Antonny, 2010</a>). Yet, these small G proteins display a wider cellular distribution than the ALPS motif of GMAP-210. Moreover, in biochemical assays, ALPS-motif containing proteins are much more sensitive to membrane curvature than Arf1 (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bigay et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Drin et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Ambroggio et al., 2010</a>).

To determine whether the sparse distribution of hydrophobic residues in ALPS plays a role in membrane selectivity, we created a condensed ALPS motif (condALPS) by deleting polar residues such as to create hydrophobic pairs akin to what is found in Arf or Sar (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>).

The analysis shows that <i>cis</i> Golgi bilayers fall between POPC and DOPC membranes in term of distribution of lipid packing defects and that membrane curvature increases the probability of having large defects (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>).

The present study with perforated cells further underlines the relevance of this mechanism in a cellular context and also gives insights about its efficiency. We estimate that the Golgi can capture hundreds of small DOPC liposomes (R \u2248 30 nm). This range compares reasonably well with the vesicle density at the Golgi as determined by electron tomography: Ladinsky et al. reported <i>ca.</i> 400 vesicles in a tomogram corresponding to 5% of the Golgi area, whereas Marsh et al. reported &gt;2000 vesicles in a larger region (<a href=\"#bib32\">Ladinsky et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Marsh et al., 2001</a>). Other clues for the efficiency of this mechanism are the massive accumulation of small (R \u2248 30 nm) vesicles in the form of tight clusters when GMAP-210 is overexpressed in yeast or in mammalian cells (<a href=\"#bib40\">Pernet-Gallay et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Pranke et al., 2011</a>) as well as the displacement of the liposome capture properties when cells express GMAP-210 at the surface of mitochondria (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). However, GMAP-210 might not be the only golgin accounting for the ability of the Golgi to capture liposomes. Among the various golgins present in mammalian cells (<a href=\"#bib21\">Gillingham and Munro, 2016</a>), we identified another ALPS motif in giantin (<a href=\"#bib17\">Drin et al., 2007</a>). This motif is located within the coiled coil region and therefore might not be involved in the initial capture of vesicles but rather in their movement within the golgin matrix. In the future, combining genetic tools to modify the repertoire of vesicle tethers and liposome-binding experiments on perforated cells should facilitate the analysis of the various modes of vesicle capture by the Golgi and other organelles (<a href=\"#bib24\">Ho and Stroupe, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Ohya et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Kuhlee et al., 2015</a>)."

Furthermore, functional and structural dissection of GMAP-210 indicates that its ALPS motif has an essential role in vesicle capture (<a href=\"#bib44\">Sato et al., 2015</a>). Our study suggests that the vesicle selectivity of GMAP-210 does not arise from stereospecific interactions between the ALPS motif and particular protein or lipid determinants, but from the unusual amphipathic properties of this motif. One striking observation is that the targeting of GMAP-210 ALPS to the Golgi is resistant to sequence inversion but is very sensitive to mutations that modify its amphipathic character (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figures 5</a>, <a href=\"#fig6\">6</a>). Notably, mutations that disrupt the helix amphipathy cause ALPS dissociation, whereas mutations that reinforce the hydrophobic face promote recognition of other organelles besides the Golgi. Thus, the physicochemical properties of the ALPS motif of GMAP-210 seem exquisitely tuned for selective adsorption on the surface of small vesicles of the early secretory pathway. Besides the chemistry of ALPS per se, the dimeric architecture of GMAP-210 also contributes to membrane curvature recognition (<a href=\"#bib15\">Doucet et al., 2015</a>)."

The present study identifies the distribution of hydrophobic residues as a second parameter accounting for the hypersensitivity of ALPS motifs to membrane curvature (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). In ALPS, most helical turns contain a single hydrophobic (H) residue (HxxxHxxH\u2026) (<a href=\"#bib23\">Gonz\u00e1lez-Rubio et al., 2011</a>). In Arf1 and Arf1-like proteins, the N-terminal amphipathic helix contains two hydrophobic residues per turn (HHxxHHx\u2026). Condensing the ALPS sequence in order to pair all single hydrophobic residues makes the helix no longer sensitive to membrane curvature and eliminates its restrictive Golgi distribution (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). We suggest that the presence of a single hydrophobic residue per turn prevents each helical turn from being too tightly bound. Since this feature is repeated many times, this amplifies the helix sensitivity to the lipid packing properties of the membrane interface (<a href=\"#bib2\">Antonny, 2011</a>). In conclusion, the ALPS motif of GMAP-210 is optimized to select small vesicles, whereas Arf1 and Arf-like proteins are more permissive to membrane curvature, which enables them to initiate, by a GTP switch, the recruitment of various effectors (coats, tethers, lipid-modifying enzymes, lipid transporters) on membranes of diverse shape (<a href=\"#bib12\">Cherfils, 2014</a>)."

Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that this latter trait, together with the high curvature of transport vesicles (R = 30\u201340 nm, for both COPI and COPII vesicles; [<a href=\"#bib34\">Malhotra et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Barlowe, 1994</a>]) leads to a high level of lipid packing defects, which enable the adsorption of ALPS motifs (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a> and [<a href=\"#bib51\">Vanni et al., 2013</a>]). The observation that excess phospholipid saturation prevents the correct partitioning of ArfGAP1 at the Golgi supports this model (<a href=\"#bib50\">Vanni et al., 2014</a>). In addition, COPI vesicles, which bud from the <i>cis</i> Golgi, are rich in unsaturated PC and poor in cholesterol and saturated lipids (<a href=\"#bib9\">Br\u00fcgger et al., 2000</a>). Therefore, we propose that GMAP-210 recognizes vesicles that shuttle cargoes between the ER and the <i>cis</i> Golgi because their membrane combines the highest level of unsaturation with the highest level of curvature. In contrast, small vesicles on the <i>trans</i> side of the Golgi are probably ignored by GMAP-210 because their physical features, notably a more ordered bilayer structure (<a href=\"#bib29\">Klemm et al., 2009</a>), are not adapted to the ALPS motif."

In contrast, GMAP-210 is probably not able to distinguish subclasses of vesicles at the ER/cis Golgi interface. GMAP-210 controls both anterograde and retrograde flows between the ER and the cis Golgi (<a href=\"#bib40\">Pernet-Gallay et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Roboti et al., 2015</a>) and, when artificially anchored on\u00a0the mitochondria, captures ER-derived vesicles as well as those that contain Golgi resident enzymes (<a href=\"#bib54\">Wong and Munro, 2014</a>). This lack of discrimination might be advantageous for building a new <i>cis</i> Golgi cisternae by merging these different vesicles. The only transport intermediates at the ER/Golgi interface that should not be captured by GMAP-210 are large carriers, which transport proteins too big to be packaged into classical vesicles (<a href=\"#bib33\">Malhotra and Erlmann, 2015</a>). In this respect, it is interesting to note that deletion of GMAP-210 in mouse leads to defects in the secretion of a relatively small matrix protein, perlecan, but not of large collagens (<a href=\"#bib47\">Smits et al., 2010</a>). GMAP-210 is also reported to function in the\u00a0cilium formation (<a href=\"#bib19\">Follit et al., 2008</a>). A plausible hypothesis is that GMAP-210 diverts vesicles with a special level of lipid unsaturation from the Golgi. As such, GMAP-210 could help building an organelle that, despite being continuous with the plasma membrane, displays a very different lipid composition (<a href=\"#bib52\">Verhey and Yang, 2016</a>)."

The ALPS motif of GMAP-210 (aa 1\u201338) was cloned in a pEGFP-N1 vector (Clonetech, Japan) upstream of ACC1, thereby giving the ALPS-ACC1-GFP construct. The cloning restriction site was BamHI. The ALPS point mutants (L12D, G11P, Ins20AA), the ALPS truncated mutants ([1\u201314], [8\u201338], [15\u201338], [1/6\u201329/38], [22\u201338]), as well as condensed ALPS were prepared from ALPS-ACC1-GFP using the QuikChange Lightning kit (Agilent Technologies, CA.,\u00a0USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. InvALPS was prepared from a synthetic gene including the ACC2 sequence. Sar1-ACC1-GFP was prepared by inserting the amphipathic helix of Sar1 in the ACC1-GFP vector using directed mutagenesis (<a href=\"#bib15\">Doucet et al., 2015</a>)."

Excitation was set at 505 nm (bandwidth 2.5 nm). Emission was recorded from 520 to 650 nm (bandwidth 5 nm).

The bilayer contained 60\u2009mol% PC, 30\u2009mol% PE and 10\u2009mol% cholesterol. The acyl chain profile of PC and PE was 6\u2009mol% C16:0-C16:0, 59\u2009mol% 16:0-C18:1 and 35\u2009mol% C18:1-C18:1. Note that the MARTINI coarse-grained model does not distinguish close lipid species such as C18:0-C18:1 and C16:0-C18:1. Therefore, these two lipid species, which are present in COPI vesicles, were simulated using the same coarse-grained model. The flat, tubular and spherical models of <i>cis</i> Golgi-like membranes were built from the corresponding DOPC structures (<a href=\"#bib50\">Vanni et al., 2014</a>). In successive steps, the correct percentage of DOPC molecules was changed <i>via</i> molecular replacement into the new lipids (DPPE, POPE, DOPE, DPPC, POPC and cholesterol). After each molecular replacement, the system was minimized using a steepest descent algorithm. Next, the systems were subjected to MD runs of 900 ns (flat, tubule) and 150 ns (vesicle) in the NPT ensemble. Analyses were carried out on the last 600 ns (flat), 450 ns (tubule) and 100 ns (vesicle). All simulations details as well as analysis for lipid-packing defects are identical to those described previously (<a href=\"#bib50\">Vanni et al., 2014</a>). Data for pure POPC and DOPC bilayers discussed in the text and shown in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a> are also taken from our previous study (<a href=\"#bib50\">Vanni et al., 2014</a>)."

This study takes a phenomenological observation and converts it into an impactful, cell biological finding with an interesting molecular basis.

Smits observed defects in skeletal tissue through decrease in perlican secretion. Although our aim was not to resolve these conflicting studies, our study suggests some hypotheses. First, the defect in perlecan secretion and glycosyslation contrasts with the normal fate of type II collagen and aggregan, which are much bigger matrix proteins. Given the ability of GMAP-210 to select vesicles based on their size, GMAP-210 deficiency should affect only matrix proteins that are incorporated into small classical transport vesicles. Second, the primary cilium has a different lipid composition than the plasma membrane in which it is embedded. Thanks to its ability to select transport vesicles according to their bulk lipid composition, GMAP-210 could help making this atypical membrane structure. These two hypotheses are presented in the new final paragraph of the Discussion."

To address these points, we have conducted new experiments in which the cells were first siRNA treated for 72 hrs to deplete GMAP-210 and then transiently transfected with probes expressing the ALPS motif. Alternatively, we used cells stably expressing ArfGAP1 (see Vanni et al. 2014 Nat Comm) and again treated the cell with GMAP-210 si RNA. These experiments are presented in a new figure (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In both cases, the reporter (ArfGAP1 or the ALPS containing probe) remains localized at the Golgi in contrast with liposomes, which no longer accumulate (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). However, Lowe et al. noticed that depletion of GMAP-210 by siRNA causes vesicles to accumulate at the Golgi at the expense of Golgi cisternae. Probably the vesicles are taken in charge by the other golgins but the flow of vesicle capture and fusion is modified by GMAP-210 deletion (see <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> in Roboti et al). Therefore, there should be enough authentic vesicles for ALPS binding, which is what we observe. These new experiments are presented in a new paragraph of the Results section (subsection \u201cSelective <i>cis</i> Golgi targeting of the ALPS motif of GMAP-210\u201d, fourth paragraph)."

The corresponding sequence is: (2726)NKGLTAQIQSFGRSMSSLQNS(2746). This motif is localized within the coiled-coil region of this giant protein, about 500 a.a., apart from the transmembrane domain. As such, it might act as a binding site for small vesicles deeper in the golgin matrix as compared to the ALPS motif of GMAP-210, which resides at the N-terminus. However, the ALPS motif of giantin shows a moderate but significant probability to be folded as a coiled-coil. The potential role of this motif is now discussed (Discussion, second paragraph)."

This method gives a fair estimate of the Golgi/cytosol partitioning of the various constructs and allows detecting modest changes between constructs that do decorate the Golgi but show different levels in the cytosol. However, we acknowledge that the image contrast was not optimal to appreciate some differences in the protein level in the cytosol.
