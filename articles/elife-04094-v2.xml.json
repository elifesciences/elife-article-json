Importantly, how sequence architecture mediates this unmethylated state remains unclear. To address this question in a comprehensive manner, we developed a method to interrogate methylation states of hundreds of sequence variants inserted at the same genomic site in mouse embryonic stem cells. Using this assay, we were able to quantify the contribution of various sequence motifs towards the resulting DNA methylation state. Modeling of this comprehensive dataset revealed that CG density alone is a minor determinant of their unmethylated state. Instead, these data argue for a principal role for transcription factor binding sites, a prediction confirmed by testing synthetic mutant libraries. Taken together, these findings establish the hierarchy between the two <i>cis</i>-encoded mechanisms that define the DNA methylation state and thus the transcriptional competence of CpG islands."

Importantly, how sequence architecture mediates this unmethylated state remains unclear. To address this question in a comprehensive manner, we developed a method to interrogate methylation states of hundreds of sequence variants inserted at the same genomic site in mouse embryonic stem cells. Using this assay, we were able to quantify the contribution of various sequence motifs towards the resulting DNA methylation state. Modeling of this comprehensive dataset revealed that CG density alone is a minor determinant of their unmethylated state. Instead, these data argue for a principal role for transcription factor binding sites, a prediction confirmed by testing synthetic mutant libraries. Taken together, these findings establish the hierarchy between the two <i>cis</i>-encoded mechanisms that define the DNA methylation state and thus the transcriptional competence of CpG islands."

This has refined our picture of the spatio-temporal occurrence of epigenetic marks, yet our mechanistic understanding on how their deposition is regulated remains limited."

Unmethylated CGs are concentrated in regions that are unusually rich in CG dinucleotides as compared to the rest of the genome (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bird, 1980</a>). The extrapolation of this observation led to the concept of CG islands (CGI), as an operational definition of regions that are likely unmethylated based on their sequence composition. Recently generated methylation maps at basepair resolution from several tissues and organisms have experimentally identified unmethylated regions at unprecedented detail (<a href=\"#bib18\">Hodges et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Molaro et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Stadler et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Xie et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Ziller et al., 2013</a>). These datasets revealed that many unmethylated regions (UMRs) extend far beyond the CGI definition and that CGI can show variable levels of methylation (<a href=\"#bib27\">Meissner et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Mohn et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Doi et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Hodges et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Molaro et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Stadler et al., 2011</a>).

From sequence perspective, these include binding of unmethylated CGs by CXXC domain containing proteins, which have been proposed to inhibit or counteract methyltransferase activity directly or through the establishment of a specific chromatin state (<a href=\"#bib31\">Ooi et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Cedar and Bergman, 2009</a>). This model would predict that local CG content is the sole determinant of the unmethylated state. Recent experiments suggested that classical transcription factors that bind motifs more complex than CG generally promote a hypomethylated states within CG poor region (<a href=\"#bib18\">Hodges et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Stadler et al., 2011</a>). Notably transcription factors have been previously implicated to impact activity but also methylation state of CGI (<a href=\"#bib7\">Brandeis et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Macleod et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Dickson et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Lienert et al., 2011</a>). Yet, it is inherently difficult to dissociate the effects of CGs and TF binding sites since both coincide at UMRs. Transgenic studies have argued that both local CG concentration and binding of transcription factors (TF) have a role in promoting low methylation levels (<a href=\"#bib7\">Brandeis et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Macleod et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Dickson et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Lienert et al., 2011</a>). The cumbersome nature of targeted genetics in mammals limited the scale of these experiments preventing generalization of the observed effects as well their translation into predictive models. Nevertheless, these results demonstrate that genetic information is necessary and sufficient to instruct methylation states, opening the possibility to study the regulation of methylation states through genetic perturbation."

In order to be informative, such experiments have to be performed in a controlled environment to minimize context related interference.

We isolated and synthesized various collections of DNA sequences in order to separately test the quantitative effect of sequence features proposed to influence methylation states. Parallel profiling of the methylation status of this catalogue of sequences allowed us to derive a comprehensive dataset that permits the systematic association between sequence motifs and methylation states. Using this information, we derive quantitative models describing the sequence determinants that govern the establishment of DNA methylation states. This surprisingly reveals that transcription factor binding sites are essential to explain the unmethylated state of the majority of CpG islands. We further demonstrate the utility of such datasets by explaining methylation changes observed in the course of normal differentiation. Moreover, we observe that deviation from the derived models is a characteristic hallmark of methylation changes associated with cancer states suggesting that this phenomenon is mechanistically distinct from differentiation related methylation changes."

This analysis reveals that the majority (63.5%) of tested sequences are methylated similarly to their endogenous counterparts despite the fact that they only represent short sub-fragments of CGIs. Interestingly, the length of individual fragments did not appear to be critical for this autonomy. For example, elements as small as 100 bp were found to be sufficient to establish an unmethylated state. However 40% of the inserted fragments gained methylation relative to their endogenous site. Surprisingly, this gain of methylation does not result in a completely hypermethylated state but covers a broad range in frequency from 20\u2013100% despite the fact that these fragments originate from regions devoid of methylation. Thus, dividing unmethylated regions into shorter entities transforms a methylation frequency that is mostly binary in the genome to a continuous variable.

A comparison of the average ectopic methylation for all fragments relative to their CG density reveals that at the upper end of CG densities (\u226512CGs/100 bp) the inserted sequences tend to behave as the cognate endogenous sequence since they show little to no methylation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). Importantly however, at CG densities that are more representative for islands (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>, upper panel), the methylation of endogenous and inserted fragments starts to significantly deviate. While some stay unmethylated, others gain methylation as indicated by the spread of methylation levels. This trend of increased methylation over a wide range becomes stronger with reduced CG density (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>).

In order to ask how the presence or absence of such motifs affects the methylation after insertion, we next introduced libraries of sequences with different CG densities derived from the <i>E. coli</i> genome. This prokaryotic DNA is not under selection for binding sites for mammalian transcription factors, allowing us to measure the effect of CG density in an isolated context. The combination of two library designs, allowed us to measure a total of 183 prokaryotic sequences covering a broad range of CG densities. We compared their acquired methylation once inserted in the mouse genome in relation to their CG density (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Similar to the inserted mouse fragments the unmethylated state can be observed at the highest CG densities (\u226512CG/100 bp) consistent with previous observations that CG density can also protect prokaryotic sequences from de novo methylation (<a href=\"#bib23\">Lienert et al., 2011</a>). At a lower CG density however prokaryotic sequences get readily methylated, as revealed by higher average methylation and a significantly reduced spread compared to mouse fragments with similar CG content (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Moreover, we observe a much stronger negative correlation between CG density and methylation for these fragments than the mouse fragments (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, R = 0.65). The reduced spread and the high number of fragments that cover a broad range of CG densities and methylation states enable us to model the relationship between CG frequency and methylation quantitatively in a sequence context where the influence of TF sequence motifs is limited (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). We fitted a standard sigmoidal model, which accounts for the finite asymptotes inherent to methylation data (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, see methods for complete description). The resulting graph properly describes the data (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.51)."

In order to account for this effect, we attempted to define the quantitative relationship between protein binding and methylation by creating models that integrate the presence of DHS to predict hypomethylated regions. Such model indeed outperforms and complements a CG based model (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,C</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). It improves predictions for CGs residing in LMRs as well as UMRs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>), which reinforces the idea that DNA binding factors significantly contribute to the existence of unmethylated states at CG rich regions. Combining CG and DHS into one model readily explains over two thirds (68% genome wide and 60% at CG rich regions) of the methylation variations observed in mESCs suggesting that CG density and TF binding are the major determinants of genomic methylation."

                                "text": "Having established a predictive model consisting of two determinants to explain methylation states in mESCs, we wondered how effects driven by CG density or TF recruitments relate to the dynamics of DNA methylation observed during cellular differentiation. To do so, we compared the methylation prediction from the CG only model with the measured differences in methylation between murine stem cells and neuronal progenitors (NP). To better illustrate the influence of CG density on methylation changes, we contrasted CG rich unmethyated regions (UMRs) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>), with CG poor low methylated regions (LMRs) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). As a whole CG rich regions show little variation between both cell states in line with continuous hypomethylation of CGIs during cellular differentiation. This is in contrast to CG poor regions that experience extensive methylations changes across cell lines (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib36\">Stadler et al., 2011</a>). However, detailed analysis within CG rich regions (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>) identifies a subgroup of cytosines that show dynamics (primarily hypermethylation) in their methylation status during differentiation. Interestingly, cytosines that change their methylation status reside within fragments where a CG only model predicts a methylated state, and little changes are observed within regions where an unmethylated state is predicted (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Notably the observed increased methylation during differentiation approaches the methylation state as predicted by the CG only model (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). One likely explanation is that the unmethylated state of these sites depends on binding of TFs that are present in stem cells but not in the neuronal progenitors. Indeed, motifs for stem cell or neuron specific TFs are enriched around differentially methylated CGs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). For example we observe a methylation increase in neuronal progenitors within CG rich regions at binding sites of the stem cell specific pluripotency factor Oct4 (Pou5f1), while regions bound by factors expressed in both cell types such as REST do not change their status (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,D</a>). This effect is reminiscent of the effect of sequence mutations that abolish TF recruitment within individual fragments shown above, resulting in increased methylation that follows the CG-only model (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). We conclude that variation in DNA methylation within subparts of islands is a function of TF binding and local CG density."

We observe that the methylation changes are tightly anti-correlated to DHS changes at CG poor regions (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). However, when DHS changes of similar amplitude are detected at higher CG densities, methylation levels do not change. This suggests that methylation levels at these regions are independent from the binding of TFs, and that a CG dependent mechanism is sufficient to explain their methylation."

We observe that, unlike the TF driven effect, the CG dependent effect is remarkably stable across cell types. One potential explanation is that the responsible trans-acting factors are widely expressed, as it is the case for some of the CXXC domain containing proteins, which are <i>bona fide</i> CG binders (<a href=\"#bib24\">Long et al., 2013a</a>). A direct consequence of this observation is that within islands, a subset of CGs embedded in short CG dense patches are unmethylated regardless of the binding by TFs in their neighborhood (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Importantly however, these patches are not essential to form unmethylated regions, as they are absent in 50% of all CGIs (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) and only contain 30% of all CGs within islands. They further do not show any particular positioning pattern within islands (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This suggests that for the majority of CGs (67.5%) within islands TF binding could contribute to their unmethylated state."

This reveals that normal colon cells show methylation changes that follow our model, while colon cancer cells display a distinct hyper-methylation phenotype (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F,G</a>). We observe a significant gain in methylation even at CGs that are constitutively unmethylated in normal tissues due to their high CG density (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F,G</a>). Interestingly, the same is observed when comparing a large set of healthy tissues and cancer types arguing that this is not unique to colon cancers (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). This argues that cancer hyper-methylation at islands is mechanistically distinct as it cannot be modeled with the same local determinant that describe methylation changes during normal development. Since both CG driven and TF mediated effects are affected this can unlikely be explained by alterations in transcription factor binding patterns."

Combined, these CG rich stretches only cover 30% of the total number of CGs that reside in islands. Mechanistically, it remains to be determined how CG richness drives unmethylated states, yet several scenarios are compatible with our observations. Proteins that specifically recognize unmethylated CG via a CXXC domain could antagonize de novo DNA methylation as previously proposed (<a href=\"#bib24\">Long et al., 2013a</a>). Alternatively, presence of dinucleotide concentrations such as CG stretches could alter nucleosomal organization (<a href=\"#bib8\">Brogaard et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Struhl and Segal, 2013</a>) and thereby impact DNA methylation. Since, transcription factors and CG richness can both impact nucleosome positioning (<a href=\"#bib37\">Struhl and Segal, 2013</a>), it is tempting to speculate that nucleosome depletion could be a unifying principle underlying the formation of unmethylated regions."

Their methylation however is less dynamic during cellular differentiation since most CGIs are constitutively active as promoters of housekeeping genes. Moreover the effect driven by CG density is stable across cell types restricting the amplitude of the changes. Our data argue that the higher the CG content, the lower the TF dependent changes in methylation and vice versa."

While the nature of this predictive difference remains unknown, we note that unlike methylation changes occurring during normal cellular changes, the loss of TF binding is unlikely to explain the observed differences. Hypermethylation in cancer particularly targets CGIs that control genes that are inactive (<a href=\"#bib16\">Gebhard et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Berman et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Sproul et al., 2012</a>).
