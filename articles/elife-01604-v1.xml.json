In a population-based survey of &gt;3000 women aged 15\u201330 in northern Malawi we show that those with earlier menarche had earlier sexual debut, earlier marriage and were more often Herpes simplex type-2 (HSV-2) positive. Compared to those with menarche aged &lt;14, the age-adjusted odds ratios for HSV-2 were 0.89 (95%CI 0.71\u20131.1), 0.71 (0.57\u20130.89) and 0.69 (0.54\u20130.89) for menarche aged 14, 15 and 16+ respectively. This association persisted after adjusting for socio-economic factors, including schooling, and for sexual behaviour. No such association was seen with HIV infection, which is much less common and less uniformly distributed than HSV-2 in this population. The extra vulnerability of girls with earlier menarche needs to be recognised."

In a population-based survey of &gt;3000 women aged 15\u201330 in northern Malawi we show that those with earlier menarche had earlier sexual debut, earlier marriage and were more often Herpes simplex type-2 (HSV-2) positive. Compared to those with menarche aged &lt;14, the age-adjusted odds ratios for HSV-2 were 0.89 (95%CI 0.71\u20131.1), 0.71 (0.57\u20130.89) and 0.69 (0.54\u20130.89) for menarche aged 14, 15 and 16+ respectively. This association persisted after adjusting for socio-economic factors, including schooling, and for sexual behaviour. No such association was seen with HIV infection, which is much less common and less uniformly distributed than HSV-2 in this population. The extra vulnerability of girls with earlier menarche needs to be recognised."

Women who had their first menstrual cycle at an older age were less likely than those with an earlier onset of menstruation to be infected with Herpes simplex type-2. This difference persisted after adjustment for age at first sex and marriage, and for differences in socio-economic position, education and number of sexual partners. This may suggest that women with earlier onset of menstruation tended to have higher risk partnerships. There was no relationship between HIV and age at first menstrual cycle, probably because HIV is much less common than Herpes in the areas where the women lived."

Here we show an association with HSV-2 infection, which is a marker of unprotected sex. The serological tests for HSV-2 have imperfect sensitivity and specificity (<a href=\"#bib26\">van Dyck et al., 2004</a>), and since the resultant bias should be non-differential the true association with menarche could be stronger."

The failure to explain the association may also be explained by the limitations of a cross-sectional study. The outcome was HSV-2 prevalence, not incidence, and the time of the infection was unknown. The age at menarche depended on recall. This would not be influenced by HSV-2 status, but could be influenced by (recalled) age at marriage or sexual debut."

(<a href=\"#bib11\">Glynn et al., 2009</a>) However, as shown in <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>, HIV is much less uniformly distributed in the population and much less common, so the risk of a woman acquiring HIV depends less directly on her own or her partner\u2019s behaviour, and more on the local prevalence (and the probability that a given risk behaviour will lead to exposure to a partner with HIV infection), and on chance. The important role of population level rather than individual level risk factors for HIV has been shown in other settings (<a href=\"#bib10\">Gabrysch et al., 2008</a>)."

As nutrition improves, age at puberty decreases (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bellis et al., 2006</a>). Unless society\u2019s expectations of a girl\u2019s role once she reaches puberty changes, increases in early sex, marriage and sexually transmitted infections can be expected. We have already discussed the need for community and individual level interventions to encourage and enable adolescent girls with early menarche to stay in school throughout puberty and beyond. To this should be added specific concerns over risky sexual behaviour in this group."

The surveillance uses local key informants who register births and deaths continuously, and report them periodically to project staff.

(<a href=\"#bib15\">Jahn et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Crampin et al., 2012</a>) In 2007, after extensive piloting, a sexual behaviour survey was added to follow the annual re-census, together with a serosurvey for HIV and HSV-2. Each sexual behaviour interview was conducted in the local language, in private. Written informed consent was requested separately for the interview and the serosurvey (<a href=\"#bib13\">Glynn et al., 2011</a>). Ethics permission for the study was received from the Malawi Health Sciences Research Committee and the ethics committee of the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine."

We have recently been awarded funding from the Wellcome Trust for a 4-year project to make our extensive data (on \u223c300,000 individuals and &gt;1 million participant contacts) more accessible, and to ensure that, as we continue to add to this unique resource, it remains usable, flexible and available to local and international researchers. This involves making major changes to the data structure, the user interface and the way new data are collected, whilst maintaining the integrity and relationships in the existing database. Meanwhile, a procedure for data sharing is in place, which requires the consent of the programme director in consultation with senior science staff. No reasonable data sharing requests are turned down and the programme is committed to ensuring as much access as possible to the data, while maintaining full confidentiality.
