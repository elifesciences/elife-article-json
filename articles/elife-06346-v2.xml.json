One challenge in testing the numerous hypotheses about serotonin's function has been observing the activity of identified serotonergic neurons in animals engaged in behavioral tasks. We recorded the activity of dorsal raphe neurons while mice experienced a task in which rewards and punishments varied across blocks of trials. We \u2018tagged\u2019 serotonergic neurons with the light-sensitive protein channelrhodopsin-2 and identified them based on their responses to light. We found three main features of serotonergic neuron activity: (1) a large fraction of serotonergic neurons modulated their tonic firing rates over the course of minutes during reward vs punishment blocks; (2) most were phasically excited by punishments; and (3) a subset was phasically excited by reward-predicting cues. By contrast, dopaminergic neurons did not show firing rate changes across blocks of trials. These results suggest that serotonergic neurons signal information about reward and punishment on multiple timescales."

We found three main features of serotonergic neuron activity: (1) a large fraction of serotonergic neurons modulated their tonic firing rates over the course of minutes during reward vs punishment blocks; (2) most were phasically excited by punishments; and (3) a subset was phasically excited by reward-predicting cues. By contrast, dopaminergic neurons did not show firing rate changes across blocks of trials. These results suggest that serotonergic neurons signal information about reward and punishment on multiple timescales."

A region of the brain that increases its activity in response to rewards and punishments also contains many neurons that communicate with each other by releasing a chemical called serotonin. This chemical is commonly thought to produce feelings of happiness; however, it remains unclear exactly how these particular \u2018serotonergic\u2019 neurons help to process rewards and punishments."

However, it is difficult to distinguish the activity of serotonergic neurons from the activity of the non-serotonergic neurons around them. To overcome this problem, Cohen et al. used viruses to force serotonergic neurons to make a type of ion channel that produces electrical currents in response to light. Shining light on these neurons via optical fibers and then measuring the neurons' responses helped to develop criteria that can identify which responses are generated by the serotonergic neurons."

The average level of reward or punishment the mice received also affected the baseline activity of many of the serotonergic neurons; this effect lasted for several minutes."

According to this theory, serotonin opposes the positive reinforcement and behavioral activation regulated by dopamine. Whereas dopaminergic neurons signal appetitive prediction errors (<a href=\"#bib101\">Schultz et al., 1997</a>), serotonergic neurons could signal punishments, thereby adjusting future behavior to avoid those punishments or inhibiting specific actions that are associated with punishments.

Here, serotonin is thought to provide its diffuse targets with long-term signals about the value of the environment, which, at the extreme, is correlated with changes in mood. These long-term signals inhibit behavior or increase the vigor of taking actions in a relatively action-general manner.

Each behavioral trial began with a conditioned stimulus (CS; an odor, 1 s), followed by a 1-s delay and an unconditioned stimulus (US; the outcome; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Mice licked toward the water-delivery tube in the delay period before rewards arrived, but not during neutral or punishment trials, indicating that they had learned the CS-US associations (analysis of variance (ANOVA), t-tests, p &lt; 0.001 for each session; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). We varied the structure of the task so that animals received blocks of 10 reward trials, alternating with 10 punishment trials, with a tone indicating transitions between blocks (or, in 35% of sessions, block order was random; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>; block duration mean \u00b1 S.D., 1.36 \u00b1 0.30 min).

In each block of some sessions, the reward or punishment trial was replaced by a neutral trial with probability 0.1.

The ITIs lasted, on average, longer than twice the duration of trials (ITI, 6.41 \u00b1 1.88 s, mean \u00b1 S.D.).

First, a large fraction (41%) of serotonergic neurons fired at a higher or lower rate during the ITIs of reward blocks vs punishment blocks (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>; <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). That is, even before a particular trial began, these neurons fired at a rate that correlated with the value (reward vs punishment) of the block. Remarkably, this response persisted across minutes. To quantify this observation, we calculated the firing rate in the 2 s before the start of each trial during reward and punishment blocks. 12 of 29 serotonergic neurons showed significantly different pre-trial firing rates between reward and punishment blocks: 7 were more excited during reward blocks, 5 were more excited during punishment blocks (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,D</a>; Wilcoxon rank sum tests, p &lt; 0.05). Interestingly, this tonic signal appeared to build up or down slowly within blocks, rather than sharply increasing or decreasing in response to block transitions (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). This tonic signal did not depend on the duration of ITIs (Wilcoxon rank sum tests, all p &gt; 0.3). In addition, 16 of 29 serotonergic neurons displayed gradually decreasing firing rates over the course of the experiment (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>)."

The auROC quantifies the discriminability of the two firing rate distributions. Values of 0.5 (black) indicate no change in firing rate relative to baseline. Values greater than 0.5 (yellow) indicate increases in firing rate relative to baseline, while values less than 0.5 (blue) indicate decreases in firing rate relative to baseline.

We calculated the auROC, comparing the baseline (1 s before reward trials) to each 100-ms window during the trial. About half of serotonergic neurons (15 out of 29) were phasically excited by reward-predicting cues (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D\u2013F</a>; Wilcoxon rank sum tests during the 1 s of odor presentation, p &lt; 0.05). Very few neurons (2 out of 29; p &lt; 0.05) were inhibited by reward-predicting cues. The duration of excitation was brief, lasting less than 500 ms (235 \u00b1 194 ms, mean \u00b1 S.D.). For 9 of these 15 neurons, the response to a reward-predicting CS was significantly greater than the response to a punishment-predicting CS (Wilcoxon rank sum tests, p &lt; 0.05). The time of peak response during a reward-predicting CS was significantly shorter for serotonergic than dopaminergic neurons (mean \u00b1 S.E.M., 331 \u00b1 15.7 ms for serotonergic neurons, 388 \u00b1 12.7 ms for dopaminergic neurons, Wilcoxon rank sum test, p &lt; 0.05)."

To compare the phasic reward-related responses during the task to responses to unexpected rewards, we examined dopaminergic and serotonergic responses to unexpected reward (delivered at random times prior to the task in 5 <i>Slc6a4</i>-Cre mice and 3 <i>Slc6a3</i>-Cre mice). Whereas dopaminergic neurons showed a large, phasic excitation in response to unexpected rewards, a subset of serotonergic neurons was weakly and slowly, but significantly, excited (Wilcoxon rank sum tests, p &lt; 0.05 for 9 of 10 dopaminergic neurons and 11 of 29 serotonergic neurons; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G,H</a>). We compared neuronal responses to unexpected rewards to responses to expected rewards in the context of the task. Dopaminergic neurons showed larger responses to unexpected vs expected rewards (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4I</a>), similar to previous observations (e.g., <a href=\"#bib101\">Schultz et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Cohen et al., 2012</a>).

We asked whether responses across blocks were truly value-related, or, rather, due to differences in responses to the different sensory modalities for reward and punishment (gustatory vs somatosensory). We performed two experiments to address this. We recorded from 13 additional identified serotonergic neurons in which blocks contained trials with one of three reward sizes: zero, small (1 \u00b5l), or big (4 \u00b5l; <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). If pre-trial, tonic responses are value-related, they should vary monotonically with reward size. Indeed, for each of the 13 neurons, firing rates were either strictly increasing (5 neurons) or strictly decreasing (8 neurons) with reward size (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>; Tukey's Honest Significant Difference tests, p &gt; 0.05). Next, we recorded from 21 additional identified serotonergic neurons (4 mice, 5.3 \u00b1 1.0 neurons per mouse, mean \u00b1 S.E.M.) in a similar task with four types of blocks: water or chocolate milk reward, neutral, air-puff punishment, and quinine punishment. Quinine, a bitter-tasting solution, is a punishment of the same sensory modality as a water reward. We found that 8 of these 21 neurons were tonically more (6 neurons) or less (2 neurons) active in water vs quinine blocks, during ITIs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C,D</a>). These neurons also showed a positive correlation in their response to the two different punishments, albeit with a weaker response to quinine (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). This could be due to the longer timecourse or smaller magnitude of the aversiveness of quinine compared to air puffs. Across both experiments, 20 of 50 identified serotonergic neurons showed tonic differences in firing for reward vs punishment blocks of trials. Thus, background firing rate in serotonergic neurons signal value across different magnitudes of reward and different types of punishment."

First, there was no US during neutral trials. Second, outcomes were predicted by the CS, therefore neuronal responses to the US could be confounded by expectation. For each of the 23 serotonergic neurons with sufficient data for this analysis, the CS-induced firing rate as a function of value was monotonic (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,B</a>). As a population, the CS firing rate was larger for reward than punishment (paired <i>t</i>-test, <i>t</i><sub>22</sub> = 2.6, p &lt; 0.05), larger for reward than neutral (<i>t</i><sub>22</sub> = 2.9, p &lt; 0.05), and larger for neutral than punishment (<i>t</i><sub>22</sub> = 2.2, p &lt; 0.05; <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C\u2013E</a>).

Although previous recording studies have used indirect methods based on spike shape or firing rate measures (<a href=\"#bib41\">Fornal et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Miyazaki et al., 2011a</a>), it has been difficult to separate the responses of serotonergic from non-serotonergic raphe neurons during behavioral tasks. Indeed, our data set of identified serotonergic neurons contained diverse waveforms and firing properties, making it critical to use a more direct method to identify serotonergic neurons. We observed some diversity in the responses of identified serotonergic neurons (cf. <a href=\"#bib92\">Ranade and Mainen, 2009</a>) but, to describe the full diversity of serotonergic neurons, a larger sample size is required. We thus focused on salient features that were shared by a large fraction of identified serotonergic neurons, which we observed in our sample size of 50 identified serotonergic neurons. In the following, we discuss potential implications of our findings in the context of theories of behavioral regulation and serotonin signaling."

However, the neural mechanisms that regulate this process remain unclear.

In contrast to this proposal, we did not find that dopaminergic neurons changed their baseline firing according to state values. Our data showed, instead, that 40% of serotonergic neurons changed their baseline firing depending on the state value of the environment. We observed this effect using rewards and punishments of the same sensory modality, and using brief punishments (air puffs), in which the acute aversiveness likely did not persist into the ITI. These firing rate changes were relatively small in magnitude (around 1\u20132 spikes s<sup>\u22121</sup>), but given the low baseline firing rates of serotonergic neurons, these changes corresponded to around 20\u2013100% increases in firing rates, which could have led to substantially higher serotonin release."

Serotonergic neuron responses to reward- or punishment-predictive cues as well as reward or punishment were transient, typically lasting less than 500 ms, and relatively small in magnitude (5\u201310 spikes s<sup>\u22121</sup>), in agreement with previous studies (<a href=\"#bib82\">Nakamura et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib92\">Ranade and Mainen, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Bromberg-Martin et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Miyazaki et al., 2011a</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Inaba et al., 2013</a>), though substantially smaller than a recent one (<a href=\"#bib64\">Li et al., 2013</a>). Previous studies observed that dorsal raphe neurons exhibited sustained activities that appeared to track moment-to-moment changes in value triggered by sensory cues and outcomes, within a trial (<a href=\"#bib82\">Nakamura et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Bromberg-Martin et al., 2010</a>). Although these activities lasted for several hundreds of milliseconds to seconds, our identified serotonergic neurons showed relatively transient activities within trials. In contrast, our data showed that many unidentified neurons showed sustained activities within trials, suggesting that sustained activities may be more common in non-serotonergic neurons. Another recent set of studies found that putative serotonergic neurons showed firing modulations lasting up to several seconds, during a task in which rats waited for a reward (<a href=\"#bib75\">Miyazaki et al., 2011a</a>), and that manipulations of serotonergic signaling altered waiting behavior (<a href=\"#bib77\">Miyazaki et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Fonseca et al., 2015</a>). This raises the interesting possibility that both time and reward value modulate the firing of serotonergic neurons, increasing the flexibility of the serotonergic signal. Indeed, the tonic signal we observed could be the subjective value of waiting (i.e., waiting for punishments elicits a low-value state, whereas waiting for rewards elicits a high-value state). A third study found that dorsal raphe neurons, on average, fired at a higher rate before cues that predicted rewards relative to cues that predicted no reward (<a href=\"#bib64\">Li et al., 2013</a>). In this work, trials were also delivered in a block-wise fashion, though it was not possible to identify serotonergic neurons, nor was there an analysis of the slow modulations in firing rate in individual neurons."

It is important to note, however, that the magnitude of increases was smaller, and did not appear to signal prediction errors for most neurons (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3D,H, 4I</a>). In addition, we found that many serotonergic neurons were excited by punishments. It is important to disentangle whether the phasic responses to air puffs we observed are due to aversiveness or other factors such as saliency or relief from punishment (<a href=\"#bib53\">Heym et al., 1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib121\">Waterhouse et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Dayan and Huys, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Cools et al., 2011</a>). The short response latency suggests that it is unlikely to be relief from punishment, but the nature of phasic air puff responses remains to be clarified. Of course, all of these signals could be expressed by the population of serotonergic neurons. In addition, it will be important to understand why the phasic response to air puffs was stronger than the phasic response to air-puff-predicting cues."

Our data showed that many single serotonin neurons were activated by both reward-predictive cues and punishment (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Although it remains unclear whether these phasic firing patterns can be unified to encode a particular variable, or whether the response to punishment was due to its sensory nature or the relief arriving at the end of the punishment, these firing patterns appear to be inconsistent with the idea that serotonergic neurons send an opponent signal compared to dopaminergic neurons, though median raphe serotonergic neurons could provide such a signal (<a href=\"#bib30\">Daw et al., 2002</a>). This lack of pure opponency is consistent with recent studies measuring putative serotonergic firing and serotonin concentration in a waiting task (<a href=\"#bib75\">Miyazaki et al., 2011a</a>, <a href=\"#bib76\">2011b</a>)."

First, unidentified neurons likely contained serotonergic neurons that we could not identify using our stringent criteria. Second, the shape of extracellulary-recorded spikes depends on the position of the electrode tip to the soma and dendrites of the recorded neuron (<a href=\"#bib100\">Schultz, 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Harris et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Henze et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Buzs\u00e1ki et al., 2012</a>). Given that the geometry of dendritic and axonal processes in the dorsal raphe is diverse, with fusiform, multipolar, and ovoid somata (<a href=\"#bib33\">Diaz-Cintra et al., 1981</a>), it is potentially difficult to optimize the location of electrode tip relative to cell bodies across the population (cf. <a href=\"#bib100\">Schultz, 1986</a>). Indeed, we did not attempt to optimize this position, once we found an identified serotonergic neuron. Third, our nichrome wires could have introduced recording bias away from small cells or certain cell shapes, potentially less of an issue for glass pipette recordings (<a href=\"#bib112\">Towe and Harding, 1970</a>; <a href=\"#bib106\">Shoham et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib84\">O'Connor et al., 2010</a>).

Careful simultaneous intra- and extracellular measurements (<a href=\"#bib50\">Harris et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Henze et al., 2000</a>) in the dorsal raphe are needed to resolve this."

Trials were arranged in blocks in order to modulate the motivation, state value or mood of the mouse. Mice were shown to discriminate in their licking behavior on the different trial types. Subsequent analyses of SERT+ neurons (29 in the main task and smaller subpopulations in various follow up studies for a grand total of \u223c50) showed that they exhibited correlates based on value (not salience or sensory features) both within trials during CS and US periods and between trials based on block. Activity was compared to that of TH+ neurons recorded I think in a previously published study. Activity was superficially similar in some regards during trials, but differed in details and also during the periods between trials such that the authors concluded that the two populations were doing different things in both periods. Overall the authors conclude that the SERT+ neuron activity correlates with predicted value or state value on both long time scales (trial blocks) and short time scales (within trials) and that this is the most salient feature of their activity."

The underlying question is important and the task design and analysis is appropriate to answer it. Indeed the results are extremely interesting to me and I think will be to the field at large. Of particular value is the comparison to TH+ neurons and also the comparison across time scales. I do not think this has been done clearly before. It is quite clever and has yielded interesting and informative data. I also enjoyed and found valuable the discussion, which did a very nice job relating the current findings both to several influential but largely theoretical proposals for serotonergic function and to the relatively sparse existing single unit data. The authors nicely link their results to those from Doya and colleagues on firing during delays."

While I think it is highly likely they were, especially if they were well-trained (data?), it would strengthen the claims to provide some behavioral data on this. Differences in trial initiation speed, proportions of trials completed would be sufficient I think. If this is not possible, I guess it does not negate the significance of the neural correlates, but I think it is a significant gap that should be filled in if possible.

There you start by emphasizing the response. To me this carries the connotation of error signals. This has not been shown and Doya et al. have provided strong data against this.

Serotonergic neurons also respond phasically to rewarding and punishing stimuli, with stronger phasic responses to the CS on rewarded blocks and to the US on punished blocks.
