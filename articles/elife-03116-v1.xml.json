While much is known about the molecules that control filopodia extension and subsequent maturation into functional synapses, the mechanisms that regulate initiation of these dynamic, actin-rich structures have remained elusive. Here, we find that filopodia initiation is suppressed by recruitment of ArhGAP44 to actin-patches that seed filopodia. Recruitment is mediated by binding of a membrane curvature-sensing ArhGAP44 N-BAR domain to plasma membrane sections that were deformed inward by acto-myosin mediated contractile forces. A GAP domain in ArhGAP44 triggers local Rac-GTP hydrolysis, thus reducing actin polymerization required for filopodia formation. Additionally, ArhGAP44 expression increases during neuronal development, concurrent with a decrease in the rate of filopodia formation. Together, our data reveals a local auto-regulatory mechanism that limits initiation of filopodia via protein recruitment to nanoscale membrane deformations."

While much is known about the molecules that control filopodia extension and subsequent maturation into functional synapses, the mechanisms that regulate initiation of these dynamic, actin-rich structures have remained elusive. Here, we find that filopodia initiation is suppressed by recruitment of ArhGAP44 to actin-patches that seed filopodia. Recruitment is mediated by binding of a membrane curvature-sensing ArhGAP44 N-BAR domain to plasma membrane sections that were deformed inward by acto-myosin mediated contractile forces. A GAP domain in ArhGAP44 triggers local Rac-GTP hydrolysis, thus reducing actin polymerization required for filopodia formation. Additionally, ArhGAP44 expression increases during neuronal development, concurrent with a decrease in the rate of filopodia formation. Together, our data reveals a local auto-regulatory mechanism that limits initiation of filopodia via protein recruitment to nanoscale membrane deformations."

When Galic et al. engineered rat neurons to produce more of the ArhGAP44 protein, fewer filopodia formed on the surface of the neurons. Decreasing the amount of this protein had the opposite effect. Moreover, ArhGAP44 was shown to mainly stop new filopodia from forming and had little effect on existing filopodia. Together, these findings suggest that ArhGAP44 may help neurons transition from a dynamic exploratory mode to a mature, more static, state; this is a characteristic of the development of the nervous system."

In culture, differentiation of individual neurons occurs in a stereotypic pattern starting with the formation of an axon, followed by the creation of an elaborate dendritic tree and culminating with the initiation and maturation of trans-neuronal synaptic contacts (<a href=\"#bib14\">Dotti et al., 1988</a>). The formation of synaptic connections is often facilitated by dynamic exploratory filopodia that extend out of thicker dendritic branches to sample the environment and thereby increase the probability that selective pre-to-postsynaptic connections are established (<a href=\"#bib66\">Ziv and Smith, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Marrs et al., 2001</a>). Exploratory filopodia are dynamic finger-like membrane structures containing actin cables formed out of actin patches along the dendritic shaft (<a href=\"#bib36\">Lau et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Matus, 2000</a>). Extension of filopodia is driven by local activation of formins, Ena/VASP proteins, small GTPases, and likely other steps (<a href=\"#bib35\">Krugmann et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Lebrand et al., 2004</a>). Intriguingly, the frequency of filopodia formation dramatically drops once high synapse density is established (<a href=\"#bib66\">Ziv and Smith, 1996</a>), suggesting that the initiation of these structures is controlled by opposing negative regulators. However, the identity of these inhibitors has remained elusive."

Consistent with previous reports, we observe that formation of actin patches precedes filopodia extension. Notably, we find that within actin patches Myosin II-mediated pulling on plasma membrane (PM)-associated actin cables induces highly curved membrane sections that trigger ArhGAP44 recruitment. The resulting enrichment of ArhGAP44 then reduces local actin polymerization due to the Rac GAP activity of ArhGAP44, preventing the formation of filopodia. ArhGAP44 expression increases as the neuronal network is established and the frequency of exploratory filopodia formation is diminished, suggesting that ArhGAP44 may facilitate the transition of neurons from a dynamic exploratory mode to a mature more static state, a hallmark of nervous system development."

To identify new regulators of exploratory dendritic filopodia formation, we performed a literature search and identified 286 genes that were previously associated either directly or indirectly with actin reorganization. We then clustered these genes according to expression pattern using published microarray data and found 89 of the 286 genes to be expressed predominantly in neuronal tissues (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a> and \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). As we were interested in regulators of actin dynamics selective for the brain, we ranked these 89 genes for high expression in the brain compared to the spinal cord and tested the validity of the ranking using a set of control genes expressed only in one of the respective tissues (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a> and <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a> and \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). Among the five actin regulators with the highest brain vs spinal cord ratio, we found ArhGAP44 (also known as Rich2 or Nadrin2), a membrane-curvature-sensing GTPase Activating Protein (GAP) selective for the small Rho GTPases Rac1 and Cdc42 (<a href=\"#bib52\">Richnau and Aspenstrom, 2001</a>). In previous studies, ArhGAP44 has been associated with the maintenance of apical microvilli in polarized epithelial cells as well as postsynaptic maturation and vesicle release (<a href=\"#bib53\">Rollason et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Nahm et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Raynaud et al., 2013</a>, <a href=\"#bib51\">2014</a>). Considering the role of Rho GTPases during filopodia formation (<a href=\"#bib35\">Krugmann et al., 2001</a>), we decided to further investigate the role of ArhGAP44 in developing neurons."

Compared to control cells, overexpression of ArhGAP44 caused a significant reduction in the density of dendritic filopodia at DIV12 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>, dark blue).

To decrease the GAP activity of ArhGAP44, we substituted a conserved arginine in the catalytic cleft with a methionine, which was shown to reduce but not eliminate the enzymatic activity of GAP proteins (<a href=\"#bib43\">Muller et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Graham et al., 1999</a>).

We find that overexpression of wild-type Rac (human Rac1) but not Cdc42 phenocopied protrusion density (<a href=\"#fig2s5\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 5B</a>) as well as protrusion kinetics (<a href=\"#fig2s5\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 5C</a> and <a href=\"#media7 media8 media9 media10\">Videos 7\u201310</a>) observed upon knockdown of ArhGAP44. Similar to knockdown of ArhGAP44, Rac1 overexpression increased protrusion dynamics and node formation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D\u2013F</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s5\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 5D</a> and <a href=\"#media7 media8\">Videos 7,8</a>). These observations are consistent with previous work showing Rac activity associated with increased actin patch formation and filopodia dynamics in axons (<a href=\"#bib56\">Spillane et al., 2012</a>) and dendrites (<a href=\"#bib34\">Korobova and Svitkina, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Cheadle and Biederer, 2012</a>). We thus considered that ArhGAP44 might act by inhibiting Rac to limit initiation of exploratory filopodia formation."

ArhGAP44 contains an N-BAR domain that has been reported to bind to positively (i.e., inward) curved lipid membranes (<a href=\"#bib48\">Peter et al., 2004</a>). Full-length protein and the isolated N-BAR domain of ArhGAP44 both enriched in patches along dendritic arbors, while deletion of the amino-terminal amphipathic helix (\u0394N-BAR), a critical sequence motif for binding and stabilization of curved membranes (<a href=\"#bib48\">Peter et al., 2004</a>), showed no enrichment over a cytosolic reference (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Intriguingly, none of the ArhGAP44 constructs enriched in extended filopodia (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Time-lapse imaging showed that filopodia often emerged from ArhGAP44 patches (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). We considered that ArhGAP44 patches might reflect the convoluted, node-like dendritic membrane sections we previously observed in electron micrographs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>) and fluorescence images (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>). Consistently, measurement of individual membrane folds within nodes (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2D</a>) showed sufficient deformation to trigger curvature-dependent protein recruitment to the plasma membrane (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bhatia et al., 2009</a>). Together with the previous overexpression and knockdown experiments (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>), the transient localization of ArhGAP44 to patches but not to extended filopodia argues that ArhGAP44 limits initiation rather than elongation of newly formed filopodia."

Consistent with previous reports (<a href=\"#bib36\">Lau et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Spillane et al., 2012</a>), ratio-imaging of the filamentous actin marker f-tractin (<a href=\"#bib31\">Johnson and Schell, 2009</a>) to a cytosolic reference showed formation of actin patches that preceded extension of exploratory filopodia (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a> and <a href=\"#media12\">Video 12</a>). This was the case in 89% \u00b1 6% of all filopodia (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). To directly test whether actin patches cause convoluted node-like PM subsections (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2D</a>), we performed correlative light and electron microscopy (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Consistent with a role of actin in node-formation, we find that actin intensity in nodes was significantly higher compared to adjacent dendritic sections (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). We then expressed f-tractin together with the isolated N-BAR domain of ArhGAP44 and found significant enrichment of f-tractin in ArhGAP44 patches (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), arguing that ArhGAP44 and actin localize to the same structure. Consistently, the N-BAR domain of ArhGAP44 enriched in dendritic actin-patches by 80% \u00b1 8% compared to adjacent dendritic regions (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>). To test for Myosin II-dependent contractile forces in ArhGAP44 patches, we co-expressed the isolated N-BAR domain of ArhGAP44 and non-muscle Myosin Heavy Chain IIB (NMHC-2B) and found a significant enrichment of NMHC-2B in ArhGAP44 patches (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Together, this suggests that myosin-dependent contraction of actin patches triggers inward membrane deformations within nodes to which ArhGAP44 is enriched. Consistently, we find increased staining for the phosphorylated form of myosin light chain (pMLC), a marker for active Myosin II (<a href=\"#bib60\">Tan et al., 1992</a>), in dendritic actin patches (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>)."

These actin patches have been shown to serve as precursors for the formation of filopodia in axons (<a href=\"#bib36\">Lau et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Spillane et al., 2012</a>) and dendrites (<a href=\"#bib34\">Korobova and Svitkina, 2010</a>). Studies in non-neuronal cells showed that individual actin filaments within the actin cortex form bundles prior to filopodia elongation (<a href=\"#bib59\">Svitkina et al., 2003</a>). Consistently, electron micrographs of neurons showed that these filopodial actin bundles are embedded in the underlying dendritic actin meshwork (<a href=\"#bib34\">Korobova and Svitkina, 2010</a>). It has been proposed that once enough actin filaments are bundled to generate the force required to protrude the PM, the resulting outward membrane deformation triggers recruitment of actin bundling/Cdc42 activating proteins, which then further increase the polymerization rate within the extending filopodia (<a href=\"#bib35\">Krugmann et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Disanza et al., 2006</a>). Given the localization of Myosin II in actin patches (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>), it is reasonable to conjecture that Myosin II-dependent contraction of individual actin filaments within actin patches provides structural integrity to counter the force generated by the extending filopodia. However, considering that individual actin filaments within a bundle are oriented with the barbed end to the PM, Myosin II-dependent contraction also exerts an inward directed pull forces that curve the PM inward which triggers increased recruitment of ArhGAP44. We propose that the highly convoluted membrane topography associated with actin patches (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>) reflect such Myosin II-dependent contraction of membrane-associated actin cables, at which ArhGAP44 becomes enriched in a curvature-dependent manner. In support of this hypothesis, we find not only that inward membrane deformation is sufficient for ArhGAP44 and N-BAR domain recruitment (<a href=\"#fig5s3 fig5s4\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplements 3 and 4</a>), but that deletion of ArhGAP44 curvature-sensitivity (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>) or reducing action-myosin-dependent contractile forces (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>) both prevented ArhGAP44 enrichment."

We show that ArhGAP44 can hydrolize the small GTPase Rac and Cdc42 (<a href=\"#fig2s5\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). Thus, a likely function of local ArhGAP44 at actin patches is to suppress GTPase-mediated local actin polymerization. We propose that ArhGAP44 is limiting Rac-dependent formation of actin patches, which provide the structural integrity required for filopodia to protrude outwards (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). This is consistent with previous reports in neurons, showing that dynamic rearrangements within actin patches relies on Rac activity (<a href=\"#bib2\">Andersen et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Spillane et al., 2012</a>), and that elevated Rac levels increase filopodia dynamics (<a href=\"#bib39\">Luo et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Nakayama et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Zhang and Macara, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Cheadle and Biederer, 2012</a>). In support of this notion, we find Rac1 localized at actin patches (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>) and show that artificial decrease of ArhGAP44 concentration at actin patches either by reducing overall ArhGAP44 levels by knockdown (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>) or by preventing ArhGAP44-recruitment to actin patches via inhibition of acto-myosin contraction (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>, see also [<a href=\"#bib54\">Ryu et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Hodges et al., 2011</a>]) both increased the number of exploratory filopodia."

Consistently, knockdown of Cdc42 substantially reduces filopodia formation in neurons (<a href=\"#bib21\">Garvalov et al., 2007</a>). Intriguingly, overexpression of Cdc42 is not sufficient to initiate filopodia formation in neurons (<a href=\"#fig2s5\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 5</a>, see also [<a href=\"#bib25\">Hotulainen et al., 2009</a>]) or in other cell lines (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kast et al., 2014</a>). This has led to the hypothesis that elongation of filopodia is a combinatorial process requiring multiple factors (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kast et al., 2014</a>). We propose that signal integration at actin patches controls this decision of filopodia elongation. Considering that actin-patch formation occurs before filopodia elongation, this argues for a 2-step process where Rac1-induced patch formation (and ArhGAP44-dependent regulation thereof) precedes Cdc42-induced filopodia elongation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). However, since ArhGAP44 shows dual specificity for Rac1 and Cdc42, both steps will be limited by recruitment by ArhGAP44 to actin patches."

Neurons were plated for 11 days and then fixed as described above for the FESEM analysis. Using the micro-pattern as reference points, individual neurons were then labeled with fluorescently tagged phalloidin and imaged on a 63\u00d7 objective with a 1.5 Optovar. Cells were then sputter-coated with 70A of Au/Pd using a Denton Desk 11 Sputter Coater. Using the backscatter detector, individual micro-patterns were identified and used to navigate and identify individual previously imaged neurons as shown in <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>. SEM Images were then taken at 10,000\u00d7 magnification and aligned with the immunofluorescent images. Finally, individual nodes were identified using the SEM images, and the average fluorescent intensity of phalloidin was measured in nodes and the adjacent dendritic stretches."

The glass with the deposited tin was then exposed to a nitrogen gas environment with a low concentration of oxygen (about 1 part per million) at 350\u00b0C for 90 min. The annealing to the glass and the formation of the replicate nanocone shapes occurred during this heating step. In order to make the nanocone structures transparent, the glass coverslip with nanocones was further heated to a temperature 400\u00b0C for 3 hr in air. Labtek chambers were then mounted with nanocoated glass slides as previously described (<a href=\"#bib29\">Jeong and Galic, 2014</a>), and neurons were subsequently cultured, transfected on DIV10, and imaged alive 24 hr later. 3D rotation (<a href=\"#media14 media15\">Videos 14,15</a>) of confocal stacks was done in ImageJ."

Overexpression and knock-down studies demonstrate that this protein is a negative regulator of dendritic filopodia number. The GAP activity contributes to this function, but is not required. Analyzing filopodia dynamics, live imaging data upon knock-down and in overexpressing neurons support that this protein causes newly formed filopodia to be unstable. Nadrin2 localizes to actin rich dendritic patches (which are nicely analyzed using correlative scanning EM/immunostaining), and imaging of the less active Nadrin2 GAP mutant supports that filopodia can emerge from these dendritic Nadrin2 patches. Interestingly, Nadrin2 appears to be recruited dynamically and in a myosin light chain kinase-dependent manner to these actin patches, which also contain Rac1. The model that emerges from these results is that myosin-actin interactions at dendritic membranes cause membrane indentations to form, which recruit Nadrin2 via its BAR domain to dynamically regulate Rac1 and restrict filopodia formation. This provides evidence that stable filopodia require not only positive signals to form but also the removal of negative regulators such as Nadrin2, which is an interesting concept. Several key experimental questions need to be addressed, however, to further strengthen this study."

More refined manipulations of Nadrin2 have a number of more moderate effects: it shows a mild (50%) enrichment in actin patches along the dendrite compared to GFP, and its knockdown prompts an increase in the number of quickly collapsing protrusions and a 20% increase in steady state filopodia density. Its recruitment to patches is shown to depend on its N-BAR domain, suggesting it is recruited to the membrane curvature observed in detail by SEM in these patches. Pharmacological inhibition of Myosin II or application of LatA or CytoD acutely reduced Nadrin2 at the patches, suggesting that the status of actin and myosin in the patches is also involved in Nadrin2 targeting. The model is that Nadrin2 recruitment suppresses Rac1 activity important for filopodial extension, and this model is supported by weaker phenotypes of a Nadrin2 mutant that retains only weak Rac1 GAP activity."

Regarding myosin, the ML7 results (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>) seem to suggest only that retention, not recruitment, of Nadrin2 are mediated by myosin II. It seems that examining the time course of accumulating Nadrin2 with respect to the time of filopodial extension would be required to evaluate the model. A more specific test would be to compare the time course of active Rac1 in the patch with Nadrin2 levels. Similarly, the curvature aspect could be addressed in detail specifically by timelapsing the N-BAR construct during extension."

Clearly, an additional step of mechanism would be required to explain the overexpression and knockdown phenotypes, but I think it is too facile to say the live imaging supports this model."

Technically, the intensity levels fluctuate substantially, making me wonder whether small or thin structures such as nascent filopodia or nodes could really be identified with confidence. One troubling example is in the upper right panel, going from frame 1 to 2. The structure seemingly of most interest is the node or protrusion in the middle of the process (under \u201cn2\u201d), which appears to pop into existence. But the entire image brightens in this panel, making it unclear whether to trust the relative intensity of the node. Related to that type of phenomenon, some of the fluctuation is apparently due to an inconsistent z span; e.g. in Movie 1, the overexpression of Nadrin2 panel clearly shows the middle one of the processes fade out and then return, as it was insufficiently spanned by the planes of the z sectioning. In the upper right panel, that particular node could just have been captured more completely in bounds of the z stack rather than appear or brighten in reality."

We also included in the revised version of the manuscript experiments to investigate a possible regulation of Cdc42 by ArhGAP44 during exploratory dendritic filpodia initiation. These experiments further validate the proposed model that ArhGAP44 targets Rac1 in actin-patches that precede exploratory filopodia formation. To directly demonstrate that inward membrane deformation is sufficient for ArhGAP44 recruitment, we artificially indented the plasma membrane in living neurons using cone-shaped nanostructures (nanocones) as well as a chemical inducer of actin dynamics (a dimerization system we developed to rapidly pull a Rac GEF from the cyctosol to the plasma membrane). Finally, we also included experiments to test for a possible function of ArhGAP44 at other actin-rich neuronal structures, such as dendritic spines and growth cones."

We propose that ArhGAP44 diffuses trough the cytosol by Brownian movement, and that enrichment of ArhGAP44 at nodes is caused by binding of the protein to inward membrane deformations that transiently form at such sites due to myosin-dependent contraction of membrane-associated actin cables. Binding of N-BAR domain proteins (such as ArhGAP44) has been shown to depend (i) on increased electrostatic interactions between negatively charged lipid head groups in curved membranes and positively charged amino acids of the banana-shaped protein dimer facing the membrane, and (ii) the insertion of an amphipatic helix present in all N-BAR domain proteins into membrane-imperfections that predominantly occur in curved lipid bilayers (<a href=\"#bib14\">Dotti et al., 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Ziv &amp; Smith, 1996</a>). Enrichment of N-BAR domain proteins at curved membranes is thus believed to be due to an increase in binding affinity that may result molecularly from a reduced off-rate and possibly an increased on-rate. As the term \u2018recruitment\u2019 does not imply active directed transport (it is often used to describe a diffusion mediated retention at local sites), we feel that it is appropriate to use this term since it describes the observed dynamic increase in local concentration of ArhGAP44 when new actin patches are formed."

In contrast, an inhibitor of filopodia initiation would be expected to be present at the \u00b4birthplace\u00b4 of filopodia, and to dissociate once elongation/outgrowth begins. The localization of ArhGAP44 all across actin patches, which our data argues is caused by acto-myosin dependent inward curved plasma membrane deformation, suggests that it reduces Rac and Cdc42 activity globally across the patch which we think explains the lower frequency of filopodia extension. The dissociation from extending filopodia (with outward membrane deformation) can best be explained by the change in curvature (all negative) in the extending membrane tubes. Based on the selectivity of N-BAR domain proteins to positively curved membranes, we therefore think that our data is consistent with a role of ArhGAP44 in regulating filopodia initiation.

Following discussion on the role of Cdc42 have been added to the text: Cdc42 acts as an activator of Irsp53 (<a href=\"#bib37\">Lebrand et al., 2004</a>), promoting IRSp53-dependent enrichment and clustering of VASP and other factors to drive actin assembly in elongating filopodia (<a href=\"#bib35\">Krugmann et al., 2001</a>). Consistently, knockdown of Cdc42 substantially reduces filopodia formation in neurons (<a href=\"#bib52\">Richnau &amp; Aspenstrom, 2001</a>). Intriguingly, overexpression of Cdc42 is not sufficient to initiate filopodia formation in neurons (<a href=\"#fig2s5\">Figure 2\u2013figure supplement 5</a>, see also (<a href=\"#bib53\">Rollason et al., 2009</a>)) or in other cell lines (<a href=\"#bib37\">Lebrand et al., 2004</a>). This has led to the hypothesis that elongation of filopodia is a combinatorial process requiring multiple factors (<a href=\"#bib37\">Lebrand et al., 2004</a>). We propose that signal integration at actin patches controls this decision of filopodia elongation. Considering that actin-patch formation occurs before filopodia elongation, this argues for a 2-step process where Rac1-induced patch formation (and ArhGAP44-dependent regulation thereof) precedes Cdc42-induced filopodia elongation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). However, since ArhGAP44 shows dual specificity for Rac1 and Cdc42, both steps will be limited by recruitment by ArhGAP44 to actin patches."

Technically, the intensity levels fluctuate substantially, making me wonder whether small or thin structures such as nascent filopodia or nodes could really be identified with confidence. One troubling example is in the upper right panel, going from frame 1 to 2. The structure seemingly of most interest is the node or protrusion in the middle of the process (under \u201cn2\u201d), which appears to pop into existence. But the entire image brightens in this panel, making it unclear whether to trust the relative intensity of the node. Related to that type of phenomenon, some of the fluctuation is apparently due to an inconsistent z span; e.g. in Movie 1, the overexpression of Nadrin2 panel clearly shows the middle one of the processes fade out and then return, as it was insufficiently spanned by the planes of the z sectioning. In the upper right panel, that particular node could just have been captured more completely in bounds of the z stack rather than appear or brighten in reality</i>."
