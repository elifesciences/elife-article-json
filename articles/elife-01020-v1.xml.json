Here we analyze a new mouse missense variant, <i>Rasgrp1</i><sup><i>Anaef</i></sup>, with an ENU-mutated EF hand in the Rasgrp1 Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor. <i>Rasgrp1</i><sup><i>Anaef</i></sup> mice exhibit anti-nuclear autoantibodies and gradually accumulate a CD44<sup>hi</sup> Helios<sup>+</sup> PD-1<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell population that is dependent on B cells. Despite reduced Rasgrp1-Ras-ERK activation in vitro, thymocyte selection in <i>Rasgrp1</i><sup><i>Anaef</i></sup> is mostly normal in vivo, although CD44 is overexpressed on na\u00efve thymocytes and T cells in a T-cell-autonomous manner. We identify CD44 expression as a sensitive reporter of tonic mTOR-S6 kinase signaling through a novel mouse strain, <i>chino</i>, with a reduction-of-function mutation in <i>Mtor</i>. Elevated tonic mTOR-S6 signaling occurs in <i>Rasgrp1</i><sup><i>Anaef</i></sup> na\u00efve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. CD44 expression, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subset ratios and serum autoantibodies all returned to normal in <i>Rasgrp1</i><sup><i>Anaef</i></sup><i>Mtor</i><sup><i>chino</i></sup> double-mutant mice, demonstrating that increased mTOR activity is essential for the <i>Rasgrp1</i><sup><i>Anaef</i></sup> T cell dysregulation."

Here we analyze a new mouse missense variant, <i>Rasgrp1</i><sup><i>Anaef</i></sup>, with an ENU-mutated EF hand in the Rasgrp1 Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor. <i>Rasgrp1</i><sup><i>Anaef</i></sup> mice exhibit anti-nuclear autoantibodies and gradually accumulate a CD44<sup>hi</sup> Helios<sup>+</sup> PD-1<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell population that is dependent on B cells. Despite reduced Rasgrp1-Ras-ERK activation in vitro, thymocyte selection in <i>Rasgrp1</i><sup><i>Anaef</i></sup> is mostly normal in vivo, although CD44 is overexpressed on na\u00efve thymocytes and T cells in a T-cell-autonomous manner. We identify CD44 expression as a sensitive reporter of tonic mTOR-S6 kinase signaling through a novel mouse strain, <i>chino</i>, with a reduction-of-function mutation in <i>Mtor</i>. Elevated tonic mTOR-S6 signaling occurs in <i>Rasgrp1</i><sup><i>Anaef</i></sup> na\u00efve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. CD44 expression, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subset ratios and serum autoantibodies all returned to normal in <i>Rasgrp1</i><sup><i>Anaef</i></sup><i>Mtor</i><sup><i>chino</i></sup> double-mutant mice, demonstrating that increased mTOR activity is essential for the <i>Rasgrp1</i><sup><i>Anaef</i></sup> T cell dysregulation."

It was recognized early on that the small GTPase Ras plays a role (<a href=\"#bib64\">Swan et al., 1995</a>). Three Ras guanine exchange factor (RasGEF) families can activate Ras: SOS, RasGRP, and RasGRF (<a href=\"#bib63\">Stone, 2011</a>). Following TCR engagement, <i>Son of Sevenless</i> (SOS)-1 and -2 are recruited to the plasma membrane via a Grb2-phospho-LAT interaction. Simultaneously, the second messenger diacylglycerol (DAG), generated via PLC\u03b3, directly recruits Ras guanine nucleotide releasing protein 1 (Rasgrp1) to the plasma membrane (<a href=\"#bib18\">Ebinu et al., 1998</a>). Biochemically, Rasgrp1 and SOS1 synergize to induce high-level Ras activation (<a href=\"#bib53\">Roose et al., 2007</a>) and Rasgrp1 serves a critical role in priming SOS1 via Rasgrp1-produced RasGTP (<a href=\"#bib14\">Das et al., 2009</a>). Consequentially, thymocyte development is severely impaired in <i>Rasgrp1</i>-deficient mice (<a href=\"#bib17\">Dower et al., 2000</a>), and not compensated for by SOS RasGEFs. Additionally, there is only minimal compensation for loss of Rasgrp1 coming from Rasgrp3 or Rasgrp4 (<a href=\"#bib76\">Zhu et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Golec et al., 2013</a>). <i>Rasgrp1</i>-deficient mice exhibit a strong defect in positive selection and impaired ERK phosphorylation in thymocytes (<a href=\"#bib17\">Dower et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Priatel et al., 2002</a>). The importance of the canonical Rasgrp1-RasGTP-RAF-MEK-ERK pathway for developing thymocytes is further underscored by impaired positive selection in ERK-1 and -2 doubly deficient mice (<a href=\"#bib20\">Fischer et al., 2005</a>)."

In addition to membrane recruitment via its DAG-binding C1 domain (<a href=\"#bib18\">Ebinu et al., 1998</a>), Rasgrp1\u2019s GEF activity is enhanced by inducible phosphorylation of threonine 184 (<a href=\"#bib52\">Roose et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Zheng et al., 2005</a>). Phospholipase C \u03b3 (PLC\u03b3) not only generates DAG but also inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), which binds to IP3 receptors on the endoplasmic reticulum to activate the calcium pathway (<a href=\"#bib19\">Feske, 2007</a>). Interestingly, Rasgrp1 also contains a pair of EF hands, motifs that often bind calcium, which induces conformational changes (<a href=\"#bib24\">Gifford et al., 2007</a>). Rasgrp1 has been reported to bind calcium in vitro (<a href=\"#bib18\">Ebinu et al., 1998</a>). In chicken DT40 B cells, the first EF<sub>1</sub> domain enables the recruitment function of a C-terminal PT domain (plasma membrane targeting domain) that cooperates with the C1 domain to recruit Rasgrp1 to the membrane (<a href=\"#bib65\">Tazmini et al., 2009</a>). Notably, the PT domain contribution is substantial in BCR-stimulated B cell lines, very modest in T cell lines, and negligible in fibroblasts (<a href=\"#bib7\">Beaulieu et al., 2007</a>). Genetic deletion of Rasgrp1\u2019s 200 C-terminal amino acids reduces the formation of mature thymocytes in <i>Rasgrp1</i><sup><i>d/d</i></sup> mice (<a href=\"#bib21\">Fuller et al., 2012</a>). Our recent structural studies revealed that Rasgrp1\u2019s C terminus contains a coiled-coil dimerization domain (<a href=\"#bib30\">Iwig et al., 2013</a>). Rasgrp1 dimerization plays an important role in controlling Rasgrp1\u2019s activity; the second EF hand of one Rasgrp1 molecule packs against the C1 domain of a second molecule in a manner that is incompatible with DAG-binding whereas calcium binding to the first EF hand is predicted to unlock this autoinhibitory dimer interface (<a href=\"#bib30\">Iwig et al., 2013</a>). Lastly, it is unknown if Rasgrp1 may signal to pathways other than the canonical Rasgrp1-Ras-RAF-MEK-ERK cascade, although a link between Rasgrp1 and mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) signaling has been proposed (<a href=\"#bib26\">Gorentla et al., 2011</a>)."

In these mouse models, the complete deletion or truncation of Rasgrp1 greatly decreases T cell development in the thymus (<a href=\"#bib17\">Dower et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Fuller et al., 2012</a>), resulting in peripheral T cell lymphopenia followed by accumulation of CD44<sup>hi</sup> CD62L<sup>lo</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<a href=\"#bib45\">Priatel et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Fuller et al., 2012</a>). Autoimmune phenotypes caused by these mutations have been attributed to compromised T cell selection in the thymus and compensatory expansion of peripheral T cells in response to lymphopenia and/or chronic infection. Hypomorphic missense alleles of the signaling molecules ZAP-70 and LAT also impair T cell development in the thymus and culminate in severe peripheral immune dysregulation. For example, an SKG allele of the kinase ZAP-70 has reduced binding-affinity for phospho-TCR\u03b6 and leads to autoimmune arthritis in mice (<a href=\"#bib55\">Sakaguchi et al., 2003</a>). Point mutations in ZAP70\u2019s catalytic domain that reduce kinase activity to intermediate levels diminish thymic deletion and Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg differentiation but preserve peripheral T cell activation, resulting in autoantibody formation and hyper-IgE production (<a href=\"#bib57\">Siggs et al., 2007</a>).

In each of these cases, peripheral T cell dysregulation is tied to, and potentially explained by, profound deficits in thymic T cell formation."

Given the emerging examples of missense alleles having very different immunological consequences from null alleles, mouse models that analyze the consequences of missense variants in key immune genes are needed to understand the pathogenesis of complex human immune diseases. Common tag SNVs near <i>RASGRP1</i> are associated with susceptibility to autoimmune (Type 1) diabetes and to thyroid autoantibodies in Graves\u2019 disease (<a href=\"#bib47\">Qu et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Plagnol et al., 2011</a>), while 13 unstudied <i>RASGRP1</i> missense SNVs are currently listed in public databases. A fruitful approach for identifying missense gene variants that dysregulate immune function has been through <i>N</i>-ethyl-<i>N</i>-nitrosourea (ENU) mutagenesis (<a href=\"#bib40\">Nelms and Goodnow, 2001</a>). Here we describe the analysis of a novel ENU-induced missense variant, <i>Rasgrp1</i><sup><i>Anaef</i></sup> that reveals an important in vivo regulatory function of Rasgrp1\u2019s EF hands. <i>Rasgrp1</i><sup><i>Anaef</i></sup> is distinct from previously described autoimmune mutations in <i>Rasgrp1</i>, <i>Zap70</i> or <i>Lat</i>, as <i>Rasgrp1</i><sup><i>Anaef</i></sup> has no detectable effect on thymocyte development in mice with normal TCR repertoires, but results in peripheral accumulation of a distinct population of Helios<sup>+</sup> PD-1<sup>+</sup> T-helper cells and production of anti-nuclear autoantibodies. In contrast to <i>Rasgrp1</i> deletion, the <i>Rasgrp1</i><sup><i>Anaef</i></sup> missense variant increases tonic mTOR signaling in na\u00efve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Genetic reduction of mTOR function in <i>Rasgrp1</i><sup><i>Anaef</i></sup> mice normalizes CD44 expression on na\u00efve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and abolishes excessive accumulation of effector T cells and autoantibodies, demonstrating a central role for increased mTOR activity in driving immune dysregulation in <i>Rasgrp1</i><sup><i>Anaef</i></sup> mice."

Whole-exome capture, sequencing and computational analysis of DNA from an affected mouse (<a href=\"#bib4\">Andrews et al., 2012</a>) identified this mutation as the only novel single-nucleotide variant within the interval of interest on chromosome 2 (data not shown). The mutant codon, located in Rasgrp1\u2019s second EF hand (EF2), encodes a neutral amino acid glycine (G) instead of the normal arginine (R), a large polar molecule with a positive charge (Rasgrp1 R519G; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>). Rasgrp1\u2019s arginine residue at 519 is also found in Rasgrp-2, and -4, and in EF3 of calcium and integrin binding protein (CIB) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). EF hands typically come in pairs separated by a linker and calcium binding subsequently alters the angle between helices E and F in proteins such as calmodulin (CaM) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>) (<a href=\"#bib27\">Grabarek, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Gifford et al., 2007</a>). Unique to Rasgrp1, this linker is unusually short. Furthermore, biophysical studies revealed that Rasgrp1\u2019s EF2 does not bind calcium, that the E helix is non-existent in EF2, but instead has evolved as a critical loop forming an autoinhibitory interface with the C1 domain (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D,E</a>) (<a href=\"#bib30\">Iwig et al., 2013</a>)."

                                "text": "Despite the normal thymic development in <i>Rasgrp1</i><sup><i>Anaef</i></sup> animals, there was a striking biochemical effect of the <i>Rasgrp1</i><sup><i>Anaef</i></sup> mutation on activation of the canonical Rasgrp1-Ras-ERK signaling pathway in a range of in vitro stimulation assays. GFP-tagged wildtype- or <i>Anaef</i>- Rasgrp1 was transiently expressed in RasGRP1-deficient Jurkat cells (JPRM441) (<a href=\"#bib52\">Roose et al., 2005</a>), which were either left unstimulated or stimulated with a combination of PMA (a synthetic analog of diacylglycerol) and ionomycin (a calcium ionophore). Gating on cells with different GFP intensities (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>) revealed that Rasgrp1<sup>Anaef</sup> was hypomorphic (partial loss of function) for activating the Ras-ERK pathway: in GFP<sup>+</sup> cells expressing Rasgrp1<sup>Anaef</sup> there was only low ERK phosphorylation (P-ERK) and this was only modestly increased when PMA and ionomycin were added (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). By contrast, GFP<sup>+</sup> cells expressing high levels of wildtype Rasgrp1 vector induced 5-times higher P-ERK spontaneously and this was doubled by PMA and ionomycin stimulation. Next, we stably reconstituted the JPRM441 cell line, which expresses \u223c10% of residual wildtype RasGRP1 protein (<a href=\"#bib52\">Roose et al., 2005</a>) with <i>Rasgrp1</i><sup><i>Anaef</i></sup> or <i>Rasgrp1</i><sup><i>wildtype</i></sup> vectors and selected clones with Rasgrp1 expression levels similar to the parental Jurkat cell line (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Since JPRM441 cells do not express surface TCR (<a href=\"#bib52\">Roose et al., 2005</a>), clonal cell lines were stimulated with PMA followed by RasGTP pull-down assays, which demonstrated that <i>Rasgrp1</i><sup><i>Anaef</i></sup> decreased PMA-induced GTP-loading of Ras to levels below that of the nontransfected JPRM441 cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). In the same transfected cell lines, PMA-induced P-ERK responses were decreased in <i>Rasgrp1</i><sup><i>Anaef</i></sup> expressing cells, most notable with the lower dose of PMA (PMA MED; 5 ng/ml) and contrasted the effective induction of P-ERK signals in Jurkat and JPRM441-WT-Rasgrp1 cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,D</a>). Similarly, <i>Rasgrp1</i><sup><i>Anaef</i></sup> expressing cells demonstrated less potent synergy in P-ERK levels when ionomycin was combined with a very low PMA stimulus (2 ng/ml) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). In fact, P-ERK responses in JPRM441-Rasgrp1<sup>Anaef</sup> cells were more impaired than in the parental JPRM441 cells, indicating a dominant negative effect, which was also observed at the level of Ras activation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). We previously reported a dominant negative effect for \u0394DAG-Rasgrp1, a form of Rasgrp1 lacking the DAG-binding C1 domain (\u0394DAG) and we postulated that there may be competition with the residual \u223c10% of wildtype RasGRP1 (<a href=\"#bib52\">Roose et al., 2005</a>). As Rasgrp1 is regulated by DAG-driven membrane recruitment (<a href=\"#bib18\">Ebinu et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Roose et al., 2005</a>) we examined this process for Rasgrp1<sup>Anaef</sup>. EGFP-tagged wildtype or <i>Anaef</i> Rasgrp1-transfected JPRM441 cells were FACS sorted on low GFP expression to avoid overexpression artifacts and cells were allowed to adhere to coated slides. PMA stimulation resulted in membrane recruitment and cytoplasmic clearing of wildtype Rasgrp1; whereas these events were decreased for Rasgrp1<sup>Anaef</sup> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>)."

Both thymocyte populations demonstrated similar induction of total phospho-tyrosine patterns and similar activating phosphorylation of Lck and Zap-70 that lie upstream of Rasgrp1 (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Rasgrp1\u2019s GEF activity is also enhanced by phosphorylation on T184 (<a href=\"#bib52\">Roose et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Zheng et al., 2005</a>). Using a new monoclonal antibody specific for P-T<sub>184</sub>-Rasgrp1 (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>) we observed drastically impaired phosphorylation of T<sub>184</sub>-Rasgrp1, and reduced ERK phosphorylation in <i>Rasgrp1</i><sup><i>Anaef</i></sup> thymocytes (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). By contrast, <i>Rasgrp1</i><sup><i>+/\u2212</i></sup> thymocytes heterozygous for the null allele displayed readily detectable Rasgrp1- and ERK- phosphorylation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>), demonstrating that the signaling defects in the <i>Rasgrp1</i><sup><i>Anaef</i></sup> thymocytes are much greater than when the amount of Rasgrp1 is simply halved. Thymocyte subset-specific P-ERK analyses revealed reduced anti-CD3- and PMA-induced responses in DP, CD4SP, and CD8SP <i>Rasgrp1</i><sup><i>Anaef</i></sup> thymocytes (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>), echoing the cell line conclusion that the <i>Anaef</i> mutation results in a partial loss of function with respect to induced Ras-ERK signaling. When pressure was placed on TCR-Ras-ERK signaling for positive selection in vivo, by introducing any one of three different rearranged TCR transgenes that are prematurely expressed at higher than normal levels on DP thymocytes, a small decrease in positive selection was revealed in <i>Rasgrp1</i><sup><i>Anaef</i></sup> TCR-transgenic thymocytes compared to their wildtype controls (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Collectively, these results lead to the surprising conclusion that the low affinity pMHC stimulation that drives physiological positive selection in vivo is remarkably robust to decreased Rasgrp1 activation of Ras-ERK."

Thus, there was no evidence that the <i>Rasgrp1<sup>Anaef</sup></i> mutation skewed T-helper cells towards a Th1 phenotype, but simply increased the number of activated or memory/effector CD4<sup>+</sup> cells. Staining for PD-1 and CXCR5, whose high expression on CD4<sup>+</sup> cells identifies T follicular helper (T<sub>FH</sub>) cells (<a href=\"#bib49\">Ramiscal and Vinuesa, 2013</a>) revealed a dramatic expansion of these cells in <i>Rasgrp1</i><sup><i>Anaef</i></sup> mice (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). However most of the increase in CD44<sup>hi</sup> Foxp3<sup>\u2212</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> cells in <i>Rasgrp1</i><sup><i>Anaef</i></sup> mice was due to a 600% increase in cells that expressed intermediate levels of PD-1 and CXCR5, and hence are unlikely to be T<sub>FH</sub> cells, but were distinguished by high expression of the Helios transcription factor (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). Helios is highly expressed in Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T-reg cells (<a href=\"#bib66\">Thornton et al., 2010</a>), but in wildtype and <i>Rasgrp1</i><sup><i>Anaef</i></sup> mice Helios is also upregulated in a subset of Foxp3<sup>\u2212</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> cells, nearly all of which are CD44<sup>hi</sup> (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>). <i>Rasgrp1</i><sup><i>Anaef</i></sup> greatly increased this Helios<sup>+</sup> CD44<sup>hi</sup> Foxp3<sup>\u2212</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> population, which was also distinguished by high PD-1 expression in <i>Rasgrp1</i><sup><i>Anaef</i></sup> (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>). <i>Rasgrp1</i><sup><i>Anaef</i></sup> mice had normal frequencies of CD95 (Fas)<sup>+</sup> GL-7<sup>+</sup> germinal center B cells in the spleen (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G</a>), consistent with the conclusion that the accumulating Helios<sup>+</sup> PD-1<sup>+</sup> CXCR5<sup>int</sup> Foxp3<sup>\u2212</sup> CD44<sup>hi</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> cells were a distinct type of activated CD4<sup>+</sup> cell but not fully differentiated T<sub>FH</sub> cells."

CD44 expression normally increases during differentiation of DP thymocytes into SP T cells, attains higher levels on na\u00efve CD4 T cells than on na\u00efve CD8 cells, and increases further on activated/memory T cells, but little was known about what determines the level of CD44 expressed. In cancer cells CD44 has been described as an mTOR target (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hsieh et al., 2012</a>). In our ongoing peripheral blood screen of ENU mutagenized mouse pedigrees, we identified a strain, <i>chino</i>, with decreased CD44 expression on peripheral CD4<sup>+</sup> CD62L<sup>hi</sup> cells but relatively normal T cell numbers and subsets (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). This unusual phenotype mapped to a single nucleotide change (T to G) in exon 5 of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (<i>Mtor</i>) gene, introducing serine in place of isoleucine at position 205 in the fifth predicted HEAT domain of the protein (<a href=\"#bib34\">Knutson, 2010</a>) (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>). This mTOR isoleucine residue is entirely conserved from mammals to yeast (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

Consistent with a subtle decrease in mTOR activity, TCR-induced phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 (P-S6) was modestly decreased but not abolished in <i>Mtor</i><sup><i>chino</i></sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> splenocytes (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a>). The numbers of DP, CD4SP and CD8SP thymocytes were normal in <i>Mtor</i><sup><i>chino</i></sup> mice (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E</a>).

                                "text": "Consistent with the CD44 data, P-S6 levels in unstimulated TCR\u03b2<sup>low</sup> (pre-selection) DP thymocytes were modestly increased in <i>Rasgrp1</i><sup><i>Anaef</i></sup> mice whereas they were decreased in cells from <i>Rasgrp1</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mice (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10A</a>). CD44 levels gradually rise as T cells mature from DP to SP and peripheral na\u00efve T cells, suggesting that CD44 expression may reflect basal or tonic signaling. Such signals can be visualized by constitutive tyrosine-phosphorylation of the TCR\u03b6 chains and other proteins (<a href=\"#bib68\">van Oers et al., 1993</a>), basal levels of ZAP70 recruitment to phosphorylated zeta chains (<a href=\"#bib67\">van Oers et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Stefanova et al., 2002</a>), and tonic phosphorylation of ERK (<a href=\"#bib51\">Roose et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Markegard et al., 2011</a>). Furthermore, these signals dissipate when T cells are rested in vitro in non-stimulatory medium (<a href=\"#bib68\">van Oers et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Stefanova et al., 2002</a>). We investigated tonic mTOR\u2013S6 signals and found substantial basal P-S6 levels in freshly isolated lymph node cells that decreased when cells were serum-starved in vitro (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10B</a>). A recent study reported that naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells display a range of CD5 expression in which the CD5<sup>high</sup> cells receive most tonic signal input and are most immune reactive (<a href=\"#bib37\">Mandl et al., 2013</a>). We first sorted CD44<sup>low</sup> na\u00efve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells into the most bright and most dim expression for CD5 and determined that CD5<sup>high</sup> na\u00efve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells have significantly more P-S6 than their CD5<sup>low</sup> counterparts (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10C</a>). Next, dividing CD5<sup>low</sup> and CD5<sup>high</sup> na\u00efve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in equal 50\u201350% splits revealed that basal P-S6 was increased in <i>Rasgrp1</i><sup><i>Anaef</i></sup>, particularly in the CD5<sup>low</sup> subset compared to wildtype cells (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10D</a>). The exact origin of tonic signals in T cells and its function being either immune stimulatory or immune suppressive is still an area of debate (<a href=\"#bib43\">Polic et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Smith et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Bhandoola et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Stefanova et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Hogquist et al., 2003</a>), but at least part of the tone appears to be generated by low affinity TCR binding to self pMHC (<a href=\"#bib62\">Stefanova et al., 2002</a>). To examine if self-peptide/MHCII recognition plays a role in the increased CD44 expression on <i>Rasgrp1</i><sup><i>Anaef</i></sup> na\u00efve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, we adoptively transferred a mixture of wild-type and <i>Rasgrp1</i><sup><i>Anaef</i></sup> splenocytes into wild-type or MHCII(<i>H2-Aa</i>)\u2013deficient recipient mice (<a href=\"#fig10s1\">Figure 10\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Maintenance of CD5 expression on T cells requires contact with self pMHC (<a href=\"#bib59\">Smith et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Mandl et al., 2012</a>) and, as expected, CD5 expression on wildtype CD4<sup>+</sup> CD62L<sup>+</sup> Foxp3<sup>\u2212</sup> T cells decreased in MHCII-deficient hosts (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10E</a>), consistent with the hypothesis that CD5 is a sensitive reporter of TCR signal strength. By contrast, CD44 levels were similar irrespective of MHCII expression in the adoptive hosts, and CD44 levels remained higher on <i>Rasgrp1</i><sup><i>Anaef</i></sup> than co-transferred wild-type cells in both contexts (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10E</a>). These data reveal constitutively increased expression of two reporters of mTOR activity in <i>Rasgrp1</i><sup><i>Anaef</i></sup> na\u00efve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells: the well-established reporter P-S6 and the reporter clarified here, CD44. The fact that the <i>Rasgrp1</i><sup><i>Anaef</i></sup>\u2013driven increase in CD44 is retained in the absence of MHCII suggests that this tonic signal is at least partially independent of triggering of TCRs by self-pMHC."

By analyzing a missense mutation in the Rasgrp1 EF-hand, the results dissociate this new function of Rasgrp1 from its well-known role in thymic positive selection. While the <i>Anaef</i> EF-hand mutation did decrease Rasgrp1 activation of Ras and ERK when thymocytes were stimulated acutely by antibodies to CD3 or with PMA in vitro, the activity of this pathway during physiological positive selection in vivo remained sufficient for normal numbers of single positive thymocytes and peripheral T cells to form even under competitive reconstitution conditions. T cell lymphopenia and sparse T cell repertoires secondary to defective positive selection potentially explain the autoantibodies observed in mice where Rasgrp1 is entirely absent or C-terminally deleted (<a href=\"#bib17\">Dower et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Coughlin et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Priatel et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Fuller et al., 2012</a>), and in animals with missense mutations in ZAP-70 or LAT (<a href=\"#bib3\">Aguado et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Sommers et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Sakaguchi et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Siggs et al., 2007</a>). By contrast, the normal thymic development coupled with experiments in mixed bone marrow chimeras where wild-type and mutant T cells co-exist rules out this possibility for the <i>Rasgrp1</i><sup><i>Anaef</i></sup> mutation, and shows that peripheral CD4 cells are intrinsically dysregulated. By a combination of biochemical and genetic studies, we identify overactive mTOR signaling within na\u00efve CD4 T cells as a key component for <i>Rasgrp1</i><sup><i>Anaef</i></sup> to drive two abnormalities: (1) a constitutive increase in CD44 expression in na\u00efve CD4 T cells and (2) a gradual accumulation of peripheral Helios<sup>+</sup> CD44<sup>hi</sup> CD4 cells and autoantibodies."

In response to relatively strong in vitro stimuli, the <i>Rasgrp1</i><sup><i>Anaef</i></sup> mutation results in impaired membrane recruitment and T<sub>184</sub> phosphorylation of Rasgrp1 as well as reduced activation of Ras-ERK, establishing that <i>Rasgrp1</i><sup><i>Anaef</i></sup> is a hypomorphic (partial loss-of-function) allele under these conditions. By contrast, in vivo, <i>Rasgrp1</i><sup><i>Anaef</i></sup> did not alter CD69 and TCR\u03b2 induction or positive selection of thymocytes, unlike the C-terminally deleted (<i>Rasgrp1</i><sup><i>d/d</i></sup>) and knockout (<i>Rasgrp1</i><sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup>) alleles which caused moderate and severe decreases in these processes, respectively. This may indicate that the cumulative Ras-ERK signals required for these events are sufficiently buffered or robust that they tolerate a modest reduction in Rasgrp1\u2019s Ras activating activity. Only when a TCR transgene was prematurely expressed at higher than normal levels in DP thymocytes was there a measurable deficit in positive selection, and even under these conditions there was a small decrease in positive selection compared even to the subtle <i>Zap70</i><sup><i>murdock</i></sup> mutation (<a href=\"#bib57\">Siggs et al., 2007</a>). This is surprising given that the induction of these signals involves low affinity pMHC binding by the TCR, which might be expected to be particularly sensitive to small changes in Ras-ERK signal strength (<a href=\"#bib35\">Kortum et al., 2013</a>)."

Our recent biophysical studies revealed that Rasgrp1\u2019s EF hands keep the protein in an autoinhibited, dimeric state, and modeling indicates that calcium-binding to the EF domain would relieve autoinhibition (<a href=\"#bib30\">Iwig et al., 2013</a>). Thus, Rasgrp1\u2019s EF hands play both stimulatory- and inhibitory-roles that may result in the EF2 substitution in <i>Rasgrp1</i><sup><i>Anaef</i></sup> decreasing maintenance of the autoinhibited state in the absence of strong TCR stimuli and decreasing RasGRP1 activation during strong TCR stimulation. Evidence exists for multiple intersections between the RasGRP1/Ras/ERK/RSK and PI-3-kinase/mTOR/S6 pathways, including at the level of Ras with PI-3-kinase (<a href=\"#bib10\">Castellano and Downward, 2010</a>) and at the level of RSK with S6 (<a href=\"#bib56\">Salmond et al., 2009</a>).

Functional comparisons of TCR-induced PLCgamma and ERK activation in Rasgrp1<sup>Anaef</sup> (or WT) thymocytes with the signals in Rasgrp1<sup>null</sup> thymocytes are not very informative (and perhaps even confusing for the reader) since these comparisons involve not only different developmental thymocyte subsets but also have the caveat of comparing cells with different levels of TCR expression, which is known to affect the efficiency of TCR stimulation."
