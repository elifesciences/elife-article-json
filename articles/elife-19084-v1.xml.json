We have discovered that human cell lines in culture proliferate with intact chromosomal origins of replication after disruption of both alleles of <i>ORC2</i> or of the ATPase subunit, <i>ORC1</i>. The <i>ORC1</i> or <i>ORC2</i>-depleted cells replicate with decreased chromatin loading of MCM2-7 and become critically dependent on another ATPase, CDC6, for survival and DNA replication. Thus, either the ORC ring lacking a subunit, even its ATPase subunit, can load enough MCM2-7 in partnership with CDC6 to initiate DNA replication, or cells have an ORC-independent, CDC6-dependent mechanism to load MCM2-7 on origins of replication"
