Here we used super-resolution microscopy to image the <i>E. coli</i> transcriptome and observed a genome-wide spatial organization of RNA: mRNAs encoding inner-membrane proteins are enriched at the membrane, whereas mRNAs encoding outer-membrane, cytoplasmic and periplasmic proteins are distributed throughout the cytoplasm. Membrane enrichment is caused by co-translational insertion of signal peptides recognized by the signal-recognition particle. Time-resolved RNA-sequencing revealed that degradation rates of inner-membrane-protein mRNAs are on average greater that those of the other mRNAs and that this selective destabilization of inner-membrane-protein mRNAs is abolished by dissociating the RNA degradosome from the membrane. Together, these results demonstrate that the bacterial transcriptome is spatially organized and suggest that this organization shapes the post-transcriptional dynamics of mRNAs."

Here we used super-resolution microscopy to image the <i>E. coli</i> transcriptome and observed a genome-wide spatial organization of RNA: mRNAs encoding inner-membrane proteins are enriched at the membrane, whereas mRNAs encoding outer-membrane, cytoplasmic and periplasmic proteins are distributed throughout the cytoplasm. Membrane enrichment is caused by co-translational insertion of signal peptides recognized by the signal-recognition particle. Time-resolved RNA-sequencing revealed that degradation rates of inner-membrane-protein mRNAs are on average greater that those of the other mRNAs and that this selective destabilization of inner-membrane-protein mRNAs is abolished by dissociating the RNA degradosome from the membrane. Together, these results demonstrate that the bacterial transcriptome is spatially organized and suggest that this organization shapes the post-transcriptional dynamics of mRNAs."

However, in bacteria, which are much smaller than human cells, it has long been believed that the location of an mRNA within the cell does not affect its behavior. Despite this, recent studies that have looked at small numbers of bacterial mRNAs have shown that some of these molecules are found in larger numbers than usual at certain sites inside cells. This suggests that location may actually affect the activity of some bacterial mRNAs. But do similar localization patterns occur for all of the thousands of different mRNAs that bacteria can make?"

For example, mRNAs that encode proteins that reside inside the cell\u2019s inner membrane are found enriched at this membrane. This localization also plays an important role in the life of these mRNAs, as they are degraded more quickly than those found elsewhere in the cell. This enhanced degradation rate arises partly because the enzymes that break down mRNA molecules are also found at the membrane."

                        "text": "Early measurements of the dynamics of a handful of synthetic mRNAs within bacterial cells suggest that mRNAs are more or less uniformly distributed inside the cells. Single fluorescently labeled synthetic mRNAs have been observed to diffuse freely throughout the cytoplasm in <i>E. coli</i> (<a href=\"#bib19\">Golding and Cox, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">2006</a>), and the local fluorescent signals from labeled mRNAs appear to fluctuate in time in a manner consistent with free diffusion (<a href=\"#bib31\">Le et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Valencia-Burton et al., 2009</a>). However, recent evidence has begun to reveal that some native mRNAs do not diffuse freely throughout the cell but are rather localized to specific cellular compartments (<a href=\"#bib8\">Campos and Jacobs-Wagner, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Nevo-Dinur et al., 2012</a>). Different spatial patterns of mRNAs have been identified. In one of the patterns, mRNAs have been observed to reside in the vicinity of the DNA loci from which they were transcribed. This pattern was observed for groESL, creS, divJ, ompA, and fljK transcripts in <i>C. crescentus</i> and the lacZ transcript in <i>E. coli</i> (<a href=\"#bib37\">Montero Llopis et al., 2010</a>). Similarly, the average distributions of the lacI mRNA in <i>E. coli</i> cells appear to show enrichment in a cellular region at which the lacI chromosome loci is also enriched (<a href=\"#bib29\">Kuhlman and Cox, 2012</a>). A second, distinct pattern has been observed in which mRNAs do not reside near the DNA loci from which they are transcribed, but instead reside in the cellular compartment where their encoded proteins are localized. For example, the <i>E. coli</i> bglGFB, lacY, and ptsG mRNAs, which encode the inner-membrane proteins BglF, LacY, and PtsG, have been found enriched near the cell membrane (<a href=\"#bib14\">Fei et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Nevo-Dinur et al., 2011</a>); the bglG fragment of the <i>E. coli</i> bglGFB transcript and the <i>B. subtilis</i> comE transcript, which encode the polar localized BglG and ComEC proteins, respectively, have been observed enriched at the cell pole or at the septa of sporulating cells (<a href=\"#bib42\">Nevo-Dinur et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">dos Santos et al., 2012</a>). In addition to these patterns, higher order mRNA structures have also be suggested, such as a helical RNA distribution near the cell membrane (<a href=\"#bib58\">Valencia-Burton et al., 2009</a>). Because of the disparate\u00a0spatial patterns that have been observed previously and the relatively small number of RNAs that have been investigated, it remains unclear how mRNAs are spatially organized inside bacterial cells and whether any of the observed spatial organizations is a genome-wide property or a special property of a small number of genes."

Several lines of biochemical evidence have revealed that mRNAs encoding inner-membrane proteins are, in part, translated at the membrane by the co-translational insertion of inner-membrane proteins into the membrane (<a href=\"#bib13\">Driessen and Nouwen, 2008</a>). Thus, these mRNAs should spend at least a portion of their lifetimes near the cell membrane. However, co-translational insertion has yet to be linked to any of the reported RNA localization patterns. Instead, a recent study has suggested a translation-independent membrane localization mechanism for RNA based on the observation that inhibition of translation of the bglF transcript does not disrupt its membrane localization (<a href=\"#bib42\">Nevo-Dinur et al., 2011</a>). This observation has led to the suggestion that an RNA zip-code in combination with unknown zip-code-binding proteins directs this bacterial RNA localization (<a href=\"#bib42\">Nevo-Dinur et al., 2011</a>), similar to the established RNA localization mechanisms in eukaryotes (<a href=\"#bib6\">Buxbaum et al., 2015</a>). However, the proteins responsible for identifying this putative zip-code have not been described in bacteria nor has this localization mechanism been extended to any other bacterial mRNAs. Similarly, no mechanism is known for the retention of mRNA near the chromosomal locus from which they were transcribed."

Interestingly, translation and RNA processing enzymes are not uniformly distributed in bacteria. For example, ribosomal proteins tend to be excluded from the nucleoid and enriched in the cell periphery and cell poles in both <i>E. coli</i> and <i>B. subtilis</i> (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bakshi et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Robinow and Kellenberger, 1994</a>). Core components of the RNA degradation machinery have been found enriched at the cell membrane in <i>E. coli</i> (<a href=\"#bib34\">Mackie, 2012</a>) and <i>B. subtilis</i> (<a href=\"#bib32\">Lehnik-Habrink et al., 2011</a>), and in the nucleoid in <i>C. crescentus</i> (<a href=\"#bib37\">Montero Llopis et al., 2010</a>). Even components of the trans-translation pathway, a pathway responsible for the resolution of defective transcripts, appear to cycle between the cytoplasm and membrane as a function of cell cycle in <i>C. crescentus</i> (<a href=\"#bib51\">Russell and Keiler, 2009</a>). Such non-uniform distributions of RNA-interacting proteins give rise to the possibility that spatial organization may play an important role in shaping the post-transcriptional dynamics of mRNAs, if the mRNAs are themselves not uniformly distributed. However, no evidence has been described yet for the role of spatial organization in the post-transcriptional fate of bacterial mRNAs."

We developed a method to directly image the spatial organization of large but defined fractions of the transcriptome, and our measurements revealed transcriptome-scale spatial organizations of mRNAs that depended on the cellular locations of their targeted proteins: mRNAs encoding inner-membrane proteins were found enriched at the membrane whereas mRNAs encoding cytoplasmic, periplasmic and outer-membrane proteins were found relatively uniformly distributed throughout the cytoplasm. Genomic organization, on the other hand, did not appear to play a major\u00a0role in the organization of the transcriptome in <i>E. coli</i>. We further demonstrated that co-translational insertion of signal peptides recognized by the signal-recognition-particle (SRP) was responsible for this membrane localization of inner-membrane-protein mRNAs. To explore the physiological consequences of this transcriptome-scale organization, we used time-resolved next-generation sequencing to measure mRNA lifetimes and found that the mRNAs encoding inner-membrane proteins were selectively destabilized compared to mRNAs encoding outer-membrane, cytoplasmic and periplasmic proteins. Finally, to elucidate potential mechanisms for this selective destabilization, we imaged the distribution of all of the enzymes associated with RNA processing in <i>E. coli</i> and observed that members of the RNA degradosome are enriched on the membrane. A genetic perturbation that removed these enzymes from the membrane preferentially stabilized mRNAs encoding inner-membrane proteins, suggesting that their physical proximity to the membrane-bound RNA degradosomes may be responsible for the native destabilization of these mRNAs."

A challenge to simultaneously imaging large populations of mRNAs is the generation of complex FISH probe sets for labeling such RNA populations, each comprising hundreds to thousands of unique oligonucleotide probes. To overcome this challenge, we used an Oligopaint-based approach and took advantage of the ability of array-based synthesis to generate complex oligonucleotide libraries (<a href=\"#bib4\">Beliveau et al., 2012</a>). Specifically, we designed libraries comprising sequences that target the desired RNAs flanked by primers that allow the selection, enzymatic amplification, and fluorescent tagging of defined subsets of these libraries, each of which target a specific group of mRNAs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). We then amplified these oligonucleotide templates to generate complex but defined sets of FISH probes by a high-throughput enzymatic amplification method (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chen et al., 2015b</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Murgha et al., 2014</a>)."

Given the correlation observed between the spatial organization of the mRNAs and their encoded proteins, we reasoned that the pathways involved in directing proteins to different cellular locations might be involved in establishing the spatial distribution of mRNAs. In bacteria, there are two major pathways responsible for protein targeting (<a href=\"#bib13\">Driessen and Nouwen, 2008</a>): the signal recognition particle (SRP)-dependent pathway and the SecB-dependent pathway. Most inner-membrane proteins use the SRP pathway, whereas most outer-membrane and periplasmic proteins use the SecB pathway. The SRP pathway is believed to co-translationally insert proteins into the membrane; therefore, mRNAs subject to this pathway would be translated, in part, at the membrane. By contrast, proteins destined for the SecB pathway are translated in the cytosol. Thus, the co-translational membrane insertion of the inner-membrane proteins via the SRP pathway would provide a simple explanation for the membrane enrichment observed for mRNAs encoding these proteins. However, this mechanism has not been linked to the previously observed mRNA distribution patterns and, for the one <i>E. coli</i> mRNA (bglF) whose membrane localization mechanism has been probed, it has instead been suggested that its membrane localization is translation independent and, thus, cannot be established by SRP-dependent co-translational insertion (<a href=\"#bib42\">Nevo-Dinur et al., 2011</a>). Therefore, a critical test of the mRNA localization mechanism is needed."

Thus, to test the role of co-translational insertion in the spatial localization of mRNAs, we created a series of fusion constructs between a test mRNA that encodes the fluorescent protein mMaple3 (<a href=\"#bib60\">Wang et al., 2014</a>) and native signal-peptide sequences derived from different <i>E. coli</i> proteins (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). We inserted these fusion genes into the chromosome and measured the spatial distribution of their mRNAs using FISH labeling and 3D-STORM imaging. Fusion to different signal-peptide sequences clearly directed the fusion mRNAs to different locations in the cell: mRNAs that were fused to the SRP signal sequences derived from the inner-membrane proteins FhuB, CcmH, and AcrB (<a href=\"#bib24\">Huber et al., 2005</a>) were almost exclusively localized at the membrane (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B\u2013D</a>), whereas those mRNAs that were fused to the SecB signal sequences derived from the periplasmic proteins GlpQ, LivJ, PhoA, and MalE (<a href=\"#bib24\">Huber et al., 2005</a>) were distributed throughout the cytoplasm (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E,F</a>). As further evidence that the membrane localization of mRNAs is driven by the SRP targeting pathway, the signal-peptide sequence derived from TolB, one of the rare periplasmic proteins that uses the SRP pathway (<a href=\"#bib24\">Huber et al., 2005</a>), also directed the mMaple3 mRNA to the membrane (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). To determine if translation of the signal peptide is required for the membrane enrichment induced by the SRP signal sequences, we removed the start codon from the fusion mRNAs and found that this perturbation removed these mRNAs from the membrane (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,D</a>). Thus, translation of the N-terminal signal peptide that target proteins to the SRP pathway is required for directing these mRNAs to the membrane."

To test the role of translation of this signal region on the localization of bglF mRNA, we created several fusion constructs between bglF derivatives and mMaple3 that are either translationally fully competent or translationally inhibited by insertion of stop codons before the SRP signal. Translationally competent bglF mRNAs were found enriched at the membrane (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013C</a>), as expected; however, constructs with stop-codon insertions that disrupted the translation of the SRP signal region, but which still contain the RNA sequence that encodes it, were no longer enriched at the membrane (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1D\u2013I</a>).

Briefly, we inhibited transcription initiation with the antibiotic rifampicin and then measured RNA abundance with RNA-seq at various time points after this treatment. After an initial period of delay determined by the time required to complete the transcription started prior to rifampicin addition (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chen et al., 2015a</a>), the abundance of each individual mRNA species decays exponentially to a stable baseline (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>).

However, it is known that the degradation rates of mRNAs depends on their sequences (<a href=\"#bib34\">Mackie, 2012</a>); thus, sequence changes to the mRNAs caused by such fusions could lead to additional, sequence-dependent changes in lifetime, complicating the interpretation of such measurements. To overcome this challenge, we developed an approach to measure the lifetimes of a large number of fusion RNAs so that the average effect that arises from the cellular localization could be determined. Specifically, we exploited massively multiplexed cloning (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kosuri and Church, 2014</a>) to create a large library of fusion constructs comprising ~4800 distinct signal-peptide sequences fused to five different test mRNAs (mMaple3, neo, bla, lacZ, and phoA; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). The ~4800 signal-peptide sequences include the following groups: i) sequences of all 775 predicted <i>E. coli</i> SRP signal peptides; ii) sequences of all 431 predicted <i>E. coli</i> SecB signal peptides; iii) sequences from the N-terminal region of 400 cytoplasmic proteins; iv) synthetic, non-native encodings of i)\u2013iii), which still encode the designated peptide sequences but with synonymous codons; and v) replicates of i)\u2013iii) but with the first two codons, including the start codon, replaced with a pair of stop codons. Based on the results in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, we expect the group i) signal sequences to send the test mRNAs to the membrane, whereas group ii) signal sequences would not send the mRNAs to the membrane. Group iii) serves as an additional control that also should not send mRNAs to the membrane. We included group (iv) to test whether the effect on mRNA degradation rates is determined by the amino acid or mRNA sequence of the signal peptides and group (v) to test whether this effect requires translation."

Thus, SRP fusions destabilize the mRNAs relative to either the SecB or cytoplasmic control fusions even after controlling for nucleotide usage.

For example, it has been previously recognized that the RNA sequences encoding signal peptides have a sequence bias (<a href=\"#bib45\">Prilusky and Bibi, 2009</a>). Indeed, we find a correlation between the nucleotide content of the different fusion sequences and the lifetime of the fusion (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>): nucleotide sequences encoding SRP-dependent signal peptides tend to be depleted of adenosine (A), and mRNA sequences with a lower A content tend to have a lower lifetime. This observation reveals that sequence bias of the RNA encoding the signal peptides also plays a role in the relative destabilization observed between the SRP fusions and all other fusions (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>) and raises the possibility that such sequence bias might explain a part of the destabilization observed for native mRNAs that encode inner-membrane proteins (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>). However, after controlling for this sequence bias in the signal peptide fusions, we still observed a relative destabilization of the SRP fusions as compared to other fusion groups for sequences containing the same number of A, T, G, or C nucleotides (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), supporting the model in which a portion of this destabilization is due to the membrane enrichment of these mRNAs as established by translation of the SRP-dependent signal peptide."

These contrasting changes in mRNA stability suggest that the coupling between translation and degradation may be more complicated than previously anticipated (<a href=\"#bib34\">Mackie, 2012</a>). Nonetheless, despite their differential effects on mRNA lifetimes, both treatments abrogated the stability differences between mRNAs encoding inner-membrane proteins and mRNAs encoding proteins in other cellular compartments, supporting the model in which the native destabilization of the inner-membrane-protein mRNAs arises from the translation-dependent membrane localization of these mRNAs."

Specifically, it has been shown that sequences that cause translational pauses are enriched in regions flanking the sequences encoding the SRP-signal-peptide, and this observation has led to the proposal that such sequence-induced pauses may help improve membrane targeting and prevent the translation of cytotoxic membrane proteins in the cytoplasm (<a href=\"#bib16\">Fluman et al., 2014</a>). However, we observe membrane targeting (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>) and the corresponding decrease in half-life (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) in constructs that do not contain such pause sequences: the constructs to which we fuse the signal peptides are not membrane proteins and, thus, will not have these sequences, and one set of our SRP fusions uses synthetic encodings of the SRP sequences which would likely eliminate or weaken any nucleotide-sequence-based signals. Thus, our results indicate that such cis-acting nucleotide sequence features are not required for membrane localization; though, we cannot rule out the possibility that they improve the performance of SRP targeting."

We reasoned that spatial organization of the mRNA processing and degradation enzymes might play a role in this effect since several RNA degradation enzymes have been found on the membrane in <i>E. coli</i> (<a href=\"#bib34\">Mackie, 2012</a>). However, out of the roughly 20 enzymes involved in RNA processing and degradation, the localization of only a handful of these enzymes have been studied previously (<a href=\"#bib34\">Mackie, 2012</a>). Thus, to understand the full extent of spatial organization in this pathway, we created C-terminal fusions between each of these proteins and the monomeric, photoactivatable fluorescent protein mMaple3 (<a href=\"#bib60\">Wang et al., 2014</a>) at the native chromosomal locus and measured the distribution of these enzymes using 3D STORM in live cells. Of the 24 enzymes measured, we observed that only four \u2014 the endonuclease RNase E, the 3\u2019-5\u2019 exonuclease PNPase, the RNA helicase RhlB, and the poly-adenylation enzyme PAPI \u2014 were enriched at the membrane, whereas the remaining proteins were largely uniformly distributed throughout the cell (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). These four enzymes are part of a multi-enzyme complex called the RNA degradosome (<a href=\"#bib34\">Mackie, 2012</a>), which is known to bind to the membrane via a short amphipathic helix, segment A, that is internal to RNase E (<a href=\"#bib25\">Khemici et al., 2008</a>). To confirm that all four enzymes are indeed enriched at the membrane due to the membrane anchoring of RNase E, we constructed a strain in which segment A of RNase E was removed (\u0394A) and found that these enzymes were no longer localized at the membrane (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C,D</a>)."

These measurements revealed a transcriptome-scale spatial organization of the <i>E. coli</i> mRNAs: mRNAs that encode inner-membrane proteins are strongly enriched at the membrane while mRNAs that encode cytoplasmic, periplasmic and outer-membrane proteins are relatively diffusely distributed throughout the cytosol (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). In total, we imaged 75% of the expressed <i>E. coli</i> transcriptome; thus, we conclude that the distribution patterns observed here are the basal patterns of the spatial organization of mRNAs, although we cannot rule out the possibility that the distributions of some individual mRNAs may deviate from these transcriptome-wide patterns."

Our experiments show that the membrane localization of mRNAs encoding inner-membrane proteins depends on translation and is most likely caused by co-translational insertion of the membrane proteins mediated by the SRP pathway (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). These results are consistent with previous biochemical studies showing that co-translational insertion is the dominant pathway for targeting these proteins to the bacterial membrane (<a href=\"#bib13\">Driessen and Nouwen, 2008</a>) and are in keeping with the notion derived from previous nucleoid imaging studies that these membrane proteins can be translated and inserted into the membrane while their mRNAs are still being transcribed (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bakshi et al., 2015</a>)."

Moreover, this native destabilization of the inner-membrane protein mRNAs depends on their membrane localization (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4</a> and <a href=\"#fig5\">5</a>) and on the membrane localization of the RNA degradosome (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). Removal of this degradation machinery from the membrane preferentially stabilized inner-membrane protein mRNAs and equalized the stability of all four groups of mRNAs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). Thus, our measurements suggest a model in which proximity between the membrane-bound degradation machinery and the mRNAs encoding inner-membrane-proteins, which are localized at the membrane by co-translational membrane insertion of the proteins, is at least in part responsible for the preferential destabilization of this group of mRNAs (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). It is possible that the transcriptome organization that we observe might also play a role in shaping the dynamics of other aspects of the life of a bacterial mRNA, e.g. transcription and translation. However, because our measurements do not discriminate between nascent versus fully formed RNA or RNAs that are or are not being translated, the data we present here provide little insight into these processes."

Several studies have revealed that a surprisingly disparate set of prokaryotes anchor core components of their RNA degradation machinery to the membrane. Both the gram positive bacterium <i>B. subtilis</i> and the archaeon <i>S. solfataricus</i> have membrane-bound degradosomes (or exosomes in the case of archaea). Remarkably, each organism uses a unique localization mechanism that differs from that utilized by <i>E. coli</i> (<a href=\"#bib32\">Lehnik-Habrink et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Mackie, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Roppelt et al., 2010</a>), suggesting that this organization is the result of convergent evolution. Moreover, the SRP-pathway is also broadly conserved in all forms of life. Based on these observations, we anticipate that the co-translational insertion of integral membrane proteins may lead to similar membrane localization of their mRNAs and therefore an enhanced turnover of these mRNAs in a wide range of bacterial organisms. Our results thus reveal that prokaryotes, like eukaryotes, can also use spatial organization to modulate the post-transcriptional fate of RNAs."

The extracellular and unknown groups were not studied in this work. To test the role of polycistrons in RNA localization, mRNAs groups were further subdivided by whether or not a given message is polycistronic with a message encoding inner-membrane proteins. All designed targeting regions for mRNAs within each group were utilized to make probes for that group with the exception of mRNAs that encode cytoplasmic proteins. 1/3 of the possible targeting regions for each gene that encodes a cytoplasmic protein were selected at random to limit the number of probes required for these stains. To test the role of genome organization, targeting regions for mRNAs transcribed from every other 100-kb region of the genome, e.g. 100\u2013200 kb, 300\u2013400 kb, etc., and within the abundance ranges of 1/3\u20133 mRNAs/cell or 3\u201330 mRNAs/cell were used."

Conceptually, \u03b1 is related to the time required for the last round of polymerases bound prior to the rifampicin treatment to complete synthesis of the given gene. The duration of this delay depends linearly on the distance between the specific portion of an mRNA being measured and the promoter; thus, messages that are at the end of polycistronic mRNAs will have a larger \u03b1 value than messages that are at the beginning of polycistronic messages or are not members of polycistronic messages (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chen et al., 2015a</a>).

The signal peptide was derived from a 30-amino-acid region centered on the first TM domain. If this region exceeded the N-terminus of the protein, the first 30 amino acids at the N-terminus of the protein were used as the signal peptide. SecB-dependent proteins were defined as proteins predicted to contain a SecB-dependent signal peptide via the signalP server. Because of the similarity between N-terminal transmembrane domains and SecB-dependent signal sequences (both are highly hydrophobic), some N-terminal transmembrane domains that are identified as SecB signal peptides via signalP are also identified as transmembrane domains via TMHMM, and are thus likely SRP-dependent proteins. To eliminate these spurious SecB signals, we removed predicted SecB signals derived from proteins that TMHMM predicted to have two or more transmembrane domains. The non-native SecB-dependent protein, beta lactamase, was also included in this set. The cytoplasmic control proteins were selected at random from proteins predicted to reside in the cytosol by pSortB and which were not included in either of the SRP or SecB groups. The first 30 amino acids of the SecB-dependent and cytosolic control proteins were used as the signal peptide sequence. Three encodings were used for each signal sequence: i) the native <i>E. coli</i> encoding, ii) a synthetic encoding, and iii) an untranslated encoding.

The data arguing that translation of the signal peptide, independent of codon, is critical to the mRNA localization event \u2013 as distinct from what occurs in eukaryotes \u2013 were also compelling. The reviewers had some modest concerns about the discussion of the coupling of transcription with translation that they thought could be addressed somewhat more clearly in the Discussion section.

While this part of the work is very interesting I believe the manuscript in its current form lacks a clear statement describing the possibility that the presented data does not address the possibility that mRNAs are translated at least once co transcriptionally. I strongly believe that this aspect should be discussed. In a second part the main finding of the paper is a clear identification and exploration of SRP mediated mRNA localization to the periphery of the cells. Results are convincing and clear and the methodology is sound from a well-established lab. It is of general interest to have a global description of mRNA localization. The impact of mRNA SRP anchoring on mRNA stability and its link to the degradation machinery localization is of general interest."

Since the authors delocalized the degradation machinery and stabilized the SRP population of mRNAs respective to the rest of the population, it would have been interesting to explore potential phenotypes (why exported proteins are degraded faster \u2013 is it just a peculiarity of this system or is it important for the bacteria?)."

They find that mRNAs encoding inner membrane proteins are enriched at the membrane, whereas essentially all other classes examined are distributed throughout the cytosol. The authors show that inner membrane localization depends on translation and requires a signal sequence, implicating SRP in the process. The resulting membrane localization increases susceptibility of these mRNAs to degradation by membrane-associated ribonucleases. Analysis of reporters bearing signal sequences demonstrates that this feature is sufficient to destabilize mRNAs and not simply a correlate of other cis-acting features or biases in nucleotide frequency."

The inner-membrane localization of RNaseE and other degradosome components was previously demonstrated, and the authors confirm these findings and further show that indeed they are the only membrane-enriched nucleases in <i>E. coli</i>. RNase E has a prominent role in mRNA turnover by catalyzing the primary endonucleolytic cleavage event that drives decay. RNase E can function in two modes, a 5' monophosphate-dependent recognition mechanism and a \"direct entry\" mechanism. Interestingly, the pyrophosphate hydrolase enzyme RppH is thought to be rate-limiting for RNA turnover in the 5' monophosphate-dependent recognition mode and is found by the authors to be cytosolic. It would be interesting to investigate the role of RppH in determining the stability of mRNAs encoding inner membrane proteins.

Based on these observations, our results do not rule out the possibility of co-transcriptional translation at all.

We have performed experiments along this line and the results show that perturbation to the membrane localization of the degradosome induces a significant growth cost (data not shown). A similar phenotype has been previously observed by others as well. Although it is tantalizing to attribute this growth phenotype in part to the delocalization of the degradosome, the interpretation of these data is, however, complicated because the enzymatic activity of RNase E also depends on its membrane attachment. Deletion of an amphipathic helix (segment A), removing RNase from the membrane, is known to reduce the catalytic activity of RNase E and leads to a global stabilizing effect on all mRNAs in addition to the preferential stabilization effect on inner-membrane-protein-encoding mRNAs due to delocalization of the degradosome. Hence the growth phenotype cannot be solely attributed to the perturbation of the membrane localization of RNase E. For this and other reasons, we believe that confirming that any phenotypes induced by this perturbation are indeed due to defects in mRNA localization will require a level of detailed experimentation beyond the scope of the current study."

This manuscript advances our understanding of the cellular organization of mRNA metabolism in bacteria and merits publication in eLife. [\u2026] To explore why membrane-associated mRNAs are generally less stable, the authors perform a systematic survey of RNase localization using C-terminal mMaple3-tagging for 3D STORM. The inner-membrane localization of RNaseE and other degradosome components was previously demonstrated, and the authors confirm these findings and further show that indeed they are the only membrane-enriched nucleases in E. coli. RNase E has a prominent role in mRNA turnover by catalyzing the primary endonucleolytic cleavage event that drives decay. RNase E can function in two modes, a 5' monophosphate-dependent recognition mechanism and a \"direct entry\" mechanism. Interestingly, the pyrophosphate hydrolase enzyme RppH is thought to be rate-limiting for RNA turnover in the 5' monophosphate-dependent recognition mode and is found by the authors to be cytosolic. It would be interesting to investigate the role of RppH in determining the stability of mRNAs encoding inner membrane proteins. No new experiments need to necessarily be performed, but the results merit discussion given the logic used throughout that localization influences function. Moreover, microarray analyses that compare steady-state mRNA abundance of wildtype and catalytically dead RppH strains could be re-analyzed in light of the encoded protein's localization (see Deana et al. doi:10.1038/nature06475).

Following the reviewer\u2019s recommendation, we performed a simple analysis of the published mRNA abundance data in the WT and RppH mutant strains. Interestingly, we find that the abundance of mRNAs that encode inner-membrane proteins appear to be less affected by deletion of RppH than other mRNAs. This observation is indeed consistent with the notion that mRNAs that encode inner-membrane proteins are preferentially directed to the \u2018direct entry\u2019 pathway (RppH-independent pathway), and one might speculate that the proximity between these mRNAs and RNase E is the mechanism that favors this pathway."

For this reason, direct measurements of the degradation rate in RppH mutants would be needed to conclusively address the reviewer\u2019s question.

We performed these experiments to test the model proposed by Nevo-Dinur et al. 2011, which is that the membrane targeting of bglF mRNA is translation independent and that this targeting requires only a cis-acting RNA region that is within the coding region. The 3\u2019UTR is not required in this model, rather, this proposed cis-acting region overlaps with the nucleotide sequence that encodes the signal peptide of bglF. Our constructs were designed to specifically test the model of Nevo-Dinur et al. and the role of translation of this putative cis-acting RNA region in mRNA localization. Thus, neither our constructs nor many of the constructs used in Nevo-Dinur et al. 2011 contained the native 3\u2019UTR region. We have now clarified these points in the revised manuscript."
