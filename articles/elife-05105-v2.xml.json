We show that disruption of the dopamine transporter gene lengthens the period of ultradian locomotor rhythms in mice. Period lengthening also results from chemogenetic activation of midbrain dopamine neurons and psychostimulant treatment, while the antipsychotic haloperidol has the opposite effect. We further reveal that striatal dopamine levels fluctuate in synchrony with ultradian activity cycles and that dopaminergic tone strongly predicts ultradian period. Our data indicate that an arousal regulating, dopaminergic ultradian oscillator (DUO) operates in the mammalian brain, which normally cycles in harmony with the circadian clock, but can desynchronize when dopamine tone is elevated, thereby producing aberrant patterns of arousal which are strikingly similar to perturbed sleep-wake cycles comorbid with psychopathology."

We show that disruption of the dopamine transporter gene lengthens the period of ultradian locomotor rhythms in mice. Period lengthening also results from chemogenetic activation of midbrain dopamine neurons and psychostimulant treatment, while the antipsychotic haloperidol has the opposite effect. We further reveal that striatal dopamine levels fluctuate in synchrony with ultradian activity cycles and that dopaminergic tone strongly predicts ultradian period. Our data indicate that an arousal regulating, dopaminergic ultradian oscillator (DUO) operates in the mammalian brain, which normally cycles in harmony with the circadian clock, but can desynchronize when dopamine tone is elevated, thereby producing aberrant patterns of arousal which are strikingly similar to perturbed sleep-wake cycles comorbid with psychopathology."

Moreover, drugs that flood the brain with dopamine, such as methamphetamine, disrupt the 4-hour cycle by lengthening the period between bursts of activity, whereas drugs that block dopamine receptors have the opposite effect."

                        "text": "Ultradian rhythms with periods ranging from one to several hours have been linked to various aspects of mammalian physiology. Usually superimposed on the 24-hr diurnal or circadian rhythm, ultradian oscillations have been observed in the context of locomotion, sleep, feeding, body temperature, serum hormones, and brain monoamines in species ranging from fruit flies to humans (<a href=\"#bib62\">Tannenbaum and Martin, 1976</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Ibuka et al., 1977</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Rusak, 1977</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Daan and Slopsema, 1978</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Honma and Hiroshige, 1978</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Dowse et al., 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Rivkees, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">van Oort et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Dowse et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Seki and Tanimura, 2014</a>). These physiological cycles most frequently exhibit periods of 2\u20136 hr, adopting harmonics of the 24-hr daily light\u2013dark cycle or the endogenous circadian rhythm, when external timing cues are absent. However, the generation of such ultradian rhythms does not depend on a functional circadian system nor a light:dark cycle. Ultradian locomotor oscillations persist in rodents housed in constant darkness even upon ablation of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the site of the master circadian pacemaker (<a href=\"#bib31\">Ibuka et al., 1977</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Rusak, 1977</a>), or genetic disruption of the circadian clock (<a href=\"#bib70\">Vitaterna et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Bunger et al., 2000</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>). These ultradian activity cycles may not simply be driven by metabolic demand since the 2- to 3-hr rhythm in foraging activity observed in the common vole persists even in the absence of food (<a href=\"#bib20\">Gerkema and van der Leest, 1991</a>). Studies in this species further indicate that one adaptive value of ultradian activity rhythms may lie in the facilitation of social synchrony, which is suggested to reduce predator risk in this species (<a href=\"#bib21\">Gerkema and Verhulst, 1990</a>). However, despite their prevalence and hypothesized biological significance, ultradian locomotor rhythms have received little research attention, likely owing to their frequently masked expression and unstable periodicity in contrast with circadian activity rhythms (<a href=\"#bib51\">Ruis et al., 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Schibler, 2008</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a>)."

When provided in the drinking water, methamphetamines (Meth) induce a daily activity bout in addition to the expected circadian rhythm (<a href=\"#bib27\">Honma et al., 1986</a>). This Meth-dependent component\u2014which typically adopts a period in the circadian range\u2014is not abolished upon SCN lesion nor by genetic disruption of circadian clock function (<a href=\"#bib28\">Honma et al., 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Mohawk et al., 2009</a>). It was thus concluded that a methamphetamine-sensitive circadian oscillator (MASCO) outside the SCN exists which is capable of driving daily cycles of locomotor activity (<a href=\"#bib63\">Tataroglu et al., 2006</a>). Despite the longstanding recognition of ultradian and Meth-dependent rhythms, the underlying cellular and molecular identity of the oscillator(s) driving them is unknown."

Our data suggest that dopamine acts as both the principal oscillator output as well as an integral component of the DUO, determining oscillator period. Our findings further indicate that the previously described MASCO represents a long-period manifestation of the DUO resulting from elevated dopamine tone. Importantly, our data support an intriguing proposition: that DUO, rather than circadian clock, dysregulation critically contributes to the sleep-wake abnormalities associated with psychopathology."

                                "text": "To gain insights into the mechanistic basis of ultradian locomotor rhythm generation, we considered that locomotor activity is associated with an awakened state (<a href=\"#bib74\">Welsh et al., 1988</a>) and consequently, the ultradian locomotor rhythms observed in mice that lack circadian clock function (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>) could be interpreted as rhythms of heightened wakefulness or arousal. In mammals, a key role in arousal promotion has been attributed to distinct monoaminergic neuronal populations located in the upper brainstem and midbrain (<a href=\"#bib6\">Brown et al., 2012</a>). While altering extracellular levels of the arousal-associated monoamines serotonin, norepinephrine, or histamine by genetic manipulation has only limited effects on locomotion (<a href=\"#bib64\">Thomas and Palmiter, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Bengel et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Xu et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Parmentier et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib84\">Zhao et al., 2006</a>), depleting the brain of dopamine (DA) profoundly abrogates locomotor activity (<a href=\"#bib85\">Zhou and Palmiter, 1995</a>). Moreover, increasing extracellular DA levels induces hyperlocomotion (<a href=\"#bib23\">Giros et al., 1996</a>) and lengthens the time spent awake (<a href=\"#bib81\">Wisor et al., 2001</a>). We therefore speculated that altering DA tone may affect ultradian rhythm generation. To test this, we examined running wheel activity in mice carrying a disruption in the <i>Slc6a3</i> gene, which encodes the dopamine transporter (DAT). <i>Slc6a3</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mice exhibit hyperdopaminergia due to the lack of DAT-mediated DA reuptake into dopaminergic neurons, leading to a hyperactivity phenotype (<a href=\"#bib23\">Giros et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Gainetdinov et al., 1998</a>). As the presence of the circadian clock and/or a light:dark cycle frequently masks ultradian activity rhythms (<a href=\"#bib54\">Schibler, 2008</a>), we assessed the locomotor behavioral consequences of DAT elimination in the absence of the master SCN circadian pacemaker. To do so, we electrolytically lesioned the SCN of <i>Slc6a3</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mice and their wildtype littermates and monitored their running wheel behavior in constant darkness (DD). While control mice (SCNx-<i>Slc6a3</i><sup><i>+/+</i></sup>) exhibited ultradian activity rhythms with the expected \u223c4-hr period, SCNx-<i>Slc6a3</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mice showed rhythms whose periods were three times longer (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>). Analysis of mice that were deficient for both DAT and the essential clock component BMAL1 (<i>Bmal1</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup><i>, Slc6a3</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup>) corroborated this finding. <i>Bmal1</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup><i>, Slc6a3</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mice exhibited \u223c12\u201314-hr rhythms in locomotor activity, largely phenocopying the SCNx-<i>Slc6a3</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mice, while their <i>Bmal1</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup><i>, Slc6a3</i><sup><i>+/+</i></sup> littermates showed \u223c4-hr periods as expected for isodopaminergic mice lacking circadian clock function (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,D</a>). Together, these results suggest that DAT removal markedly increases ultradian cycle length. Alternatively, the \u223c12-hr rhythms observed in SCNx-<i>Slc6a3</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> and <i>Bmal1</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup><i>, Slc6a3</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> animals may originate from an independent oscillator, one that is activated by DAT elimination, while the short period ultradian oscillator that operates in DAT intact, SCNx <i>or Bmal1</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> animals is disengaged or otherwise obscured."

                                "text": "In order to corroborate that DAT removal indeed lengthens the period of the ultradian activity cycles, we took into account that DAT-mediated DA uptake can be reversed by the selective action of the psychostimulant methamphetamine (Meth) (<a href=\"#bib30\">Howell and Kimmel, 2008</a>). Because Meth leads to increased extracellular DA concentrations as in the case of <i>Slc6a3</i> gene disruption, we speculated that Meth treatment would result in a, possibly gradual, period lengthening of the ultradian locomotor rhythms. Indeed when we treated <i>Bmal1</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> animals with increasing concentrations of Meth via drinking water in DD, we observed a gradual lengthening of the initial \u223c4-hr locomotor oscillations and this was accompanied by a corresponding increase in activity bout length (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>). Of note, the period increase in response to elevating Meth concentrations did not halt in the circadian range, rather, oscillations continued to lengthen with individual animals reaching periods of 100 hr or more (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Gradual period lengthening of ultradian locomotor rhythms was also observed in <i>Bmal1</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> animals exposed to amphetamine (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>), a drug similarly targeting DAT (<a href=\"#bib30\">Howell and Kimmel, 2008</a>), but with lower efficacy than Meth (<a href=\"#bib24\">Goodwin et al., 2009</a>). These results argue that DAT targeting psychostimulants affect an endogenous ultradian rhythm generator by increasing period length. However, due to the mode of delivery (drinking water) and the rhythmic Meth uptake that may in turn result from it, it is conceivable that the Meth-dependent, long-period oscillations are \u2018driven\u2019 by rhythmic drug intake rather than being generated endogenously. To address this possibility, we subcutaneously implanted <i>Bmal1</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mice with osmotic minipumps that continuously infused Meth over a period of 2 weeks. Running wheel analysis in DD of Meth-infused <i>Bmal1</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> animals demonstrated a significant ultradian period lengthening upon drug infusion (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C,D</a>) suggesting that rhythmic uptake is not required for Meth to exert its period lengthening effect, in line with a previous study performed in rats (<a href=\"#bib28\">Honma et al., 1987</a>). The relatively limited change in period observed in this experimental paradigm could be due to the short, 2-week infusion timespan, which is perhaps insufficient to robustly lengthen periods beyond 12 hr (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). Together, these findings support the notion that the long-period oscillations observed in Meth-treated animals, and likewise in <i>Slc6a3</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mice, are due to period expansion of an endogenous ultradian rhythm of arousal."

While activity rhythms in the ultradian range are easily discernable in voles and hamsters (<a href=\"#bib22\">Gerkema et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">van der Veen et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Prendergast et al., 2012</a>), the presence of such rhythms in mice or rats is much less obvious and this has been attributed to masking by the circadian clock (<a href=\"#bib54\">Schibler, 2008</a>). Indeed, running wheel activity data from intact mice often do not provide strong indications of ultradian activity rhythms. However, when we recorded ambulatory behavior using telemetry, we frequently detected three, evenly spaced activity bouts during the active (night) phase (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). The observed \u223c4 hr peak-to-peak spacing is in line with a previous study on several circadian competent mouse strains where ultradian rhythms with similar period length were detected (<a href=\"#bib15\">Dowse et al., 2010</a>). The absence of a clearly discernable \u223c4-hr rhythmic component during the light portion of the daily LD cycle (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>) is likely due to masking by the SCN and/or light. Unlike WT mice, <i>Slc6a3</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mice never showed a triple-peak activity pattern at night (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), and spectral density analysis in the ultradian (2\u20138 hr) range (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>) underscores that rhythm generation is significantly altered in these animals while total daily activity is not (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). When we provided C57BL/6 mice carrying a telemetry implant with Meth in their drinking water, we observed a gradual lengthening of the interval between the night-time activity peaks (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F,G</a>), resulting in the transformation of the triple peak (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a><i>,</i> white trace and white triangles) into a dual or single night-time activity peak pattern at the highest (100 mg/l) Meth concentration (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>, black trace and black triangles). This was corroborated by spectral density analysis revealing a marked reduction in ultradian frequencies upon Meth treatment (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). Together, these results indicate that blocking DA reuptake also lengthens ultradian activity bout intervals in circadian competent mice, arguing that an ultradian oscillator is not \u2018activated\u2019 by circadian disruption, but rather continuously operative alongside the circadian timer. As with <i>Bmal1</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mice, prolonged Meth-treatment in intact WT mice can lead to profound period lengthening of ultradian rhythms, often into the circabidian (48 hr) range (for examples see Figures 5E, 7F, 9B)."

We therefore provided <i>Bmal1</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mice in DD with the antipsychotic drug haloperidol (Hal) in their drinking water. Hal selectively blocks the DA receptor D2 (DRD2) (<a href=\"#bib60\">Strange, 2008</a>), which is expressed on postsynaptic target sites of DA neuronal projections but also presynaptically as an autoreceptor (<a href=\"#bib55\">Schmitz et al., 2003</a>). Importantly, when given chronically as in our case, Hal has been reported to electrically silence midbrain DA neurons (<a href=\"#bib76\">White and Wang, 1983</a>) and to markedly lower extracellular DA levels in the striatum/nucleus accumbens regions in rats (<a href=\"#bib35\">Lane and Blaha, 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Ichikawa and Meltzer, 1991</a>). As predicted, <i>Bmal1</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mice responded with successive locomotor period shortening to increasing concentrations of Hal (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>). We also observed Hal-mediated shortening of the long-period behavioral rhythms in <i>Bmal1</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> and wild-type mice treated concurrently with Meth (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C\u2013F</a>). A period shortening effect of Hal could also be discerned from the core body temperature fluctuations of <i>Slc6a3</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mice, which increased in frequency (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>). This response, which mirrored the locomotor behavioral response (not shown), was concentration dependent and spectral density analysis confirmed a successive increase of the ultradian component upon Hal exposure (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5H</a>). Together, these data strongly support the hypothesis that both the ultradian rhythms observed in wildtype and <i>Bmal1</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mice and the long-period rhythms previously attributed to the MASCO are driven by the exact same oscillatory mechanism."

Mice were kept under constant dim red light (&lt;5lux) and ultradian activity rhythms were monitored using infra-red beam breaking. The animals showed the expected short period rhythms in locomotor activity throughout the experiment (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>), and analysis of dialysates revealed that extracellular DA levels fluctuated concordantly with the activity cycles (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, compare solid red and black traces). Importantly, we generated a model oscillation using the cosinor method from locomotor rhythms recorded for 20 hr after dialysate sampling with no investigator present and compared it to the DA fluctuations observed. The goodness of fit between the cosinor and the DA profiles indicated by the sum of squared errors (SSE = 0.050 \u00b1 0.027, mean \u00b1 SEM, N = 7) suggests that the dialysate sampling procedure itself did not perturb the generation of the endogenous ultradian activity cycles. To determine the statistical significance of the observed agreement between the cosinor and the DA trace, we randomly permutated the individual time points of the DA trace and determined the percentage of permutated traces with an equal or better fit to the cosinor in comparison to the observed DA fluctuation. On average, only 3.2 \u00b1 1.7% of 100,000 permutated DA profiles correlated as well or better than the experimentally observed DA measurements (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>), confirming that extracellular DA fluctuates in synchrony with the ultradian activity cycles.

To corroborate the importance of these neurons in the oscillator process, we employed a chemogenetic approach based upon DREADD (designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs) technology (<a href=\"#bib33\">Krashes et al., 2011</a>). We stereotaxically delivered the adeno-associated virus <i>AAV-DIO-hM3Dq-mCherry</i> (<a href=\"#bib33\">Krashes et al., 2011</a>) into the SN/VTA region of mice that carried an <i>Slc6a3</i> promoter driven <i>Cre</i> transgene (<i>DAT-Cre</i> ) (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib66\">Turiault et al., 2007</a>) and that additionally were either BMAL1-deficient (<i>DAT-Cre</i>, <i>Bmal1</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup>) or received an SCN lesion (<i>DAT-Cre</i>, SCNx). Upon Cre-mediated recombination, virally transfected cells express the stimulatory DREADD hM3Dq, which has been demonstrated to increase neuronal firing frequency upon binding of the compound clozapine-N-oxide (CNO), which is otherwise physiologically inert (<a href=\"#bib1\">Alexander et al., 2009</a>). As augmenting firing frequency in DA neurons enhances DA release (<a href=\"#bib61\">Sulzer, 2011</a>), and CNO stimulation of successfully transduced <i>DAT-Cre</i> mice evokes vigorous firing of dopamine neurons (<a href=\"#bib71\">Wang et al., 2013</a>), CNO is expected to increase DA release. Consistently, i.p.-injection of CNO elevated extracellular DA in the striatum of those mice and led to a prolonged increase in locomotor activity (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C,D</a>), which was absent in vehicle injected animals (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). Responsive mice showed mCherry fusion tag expression selectively in tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) positive cells (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>, <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Cell counting revealed that, 92.9 \u00b1 5.1% and 87.8 \u00b1 6.0% (mean \u00b1 SEM, N = 6 for both groups) of the midbrain TH<sup>+</sup> neurons also expressed the mCherry fusion tag in responsive <i>DAT-Cre,</i> SCNX and <i>DAT-Cre, Bmal</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mice, respectively, confirming effective Cre-mediated hM3Dq expression in midbrain DA neurons. Running wheel activity monitoring of virus-injected mice showed the expected short period locomotor oscillations, however, upon switching to CNO-containing drinking water (red arrows), both, <i>AAV-hM3Dq</i> transduced <i>DAT-Cre</i>, SCNx and <i>DAT-Cre</i>, <i>Bmal1</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mice responded with locomotor period lengthening (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E\u2013H</a>), an effect that was reversed when mice were returned to pure water (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8G</a>, blue arrows). As expected, a period lengthening was not observable in <i>AAV-hM3Dq</i> injected <i>DAT-Cre</i><sup><i>0/0</i></sup>, <i>Bmal1</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mice upon CNO exposure (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1B,C</a>). These results further corroborate that elevating DA tone, in this case by selective excitation of DA neurons, lengthens ultradian locomotor period and that the oscillator driving ultradian rhythmicity comprises DA neurons of the VTA/SN region."

However, elevation of DA tone can lead to DUO period lengthening, which either results in DUO free-run (for example, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D,G</a>) or reinstatement of oscillator synchrony albeit at a different harmonic (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>, e.g., 48 hr). The DUO appears as a highly tunable oscillator, able to adopt period lengths from a few hours to multiple days. This is in stark contrast to the circadian timer which cannot adopt periods that are more than a few hours off from 24 hr when its limits of entrainment are tested experimentally (<a href=\"#bib2\">Aschoff and Pohl, 1978</a>)."

As all period-altering manipulations directly impinge upon DA neuronal physiology, this suggests that either (i) DA neurons are the site of ultradian rhythm generation or (ii) they are a key cog in the oscillatory mechanism. The chemogenetic activation experiments indicate that the relevant DA neuronal population is located in the midbrain as selective activation of DA neurons in this region had a period lengthening effect on the ultradian activity. Future experiments will be aimed at delineating the precise DA population(s) required for the ultradian rhythm generation process and how rhythmic synchrony between neurons is maintained, if the DUO is indeed composed of a population of cellular oscillators."

Of note, extracellular DA was reported to fluctuate diurnally in the rodent striatum (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hood et al., 2010</a>), which was abrogated in <i>Slc6a3</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mice (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gallardo et al., 2014</a>). In these studies, only group averaged DA profiles were presented and DA was solely measured in circadian intact mice and rats, thus it is conceivable that any ultradian component (in WT) or infradian component (in <i>Slc6a3</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup>) escaped detection. Critically, the observation that the DA levels, on average, followed a diurnal pattern with a night-time peak, together with the observation that ultradian locomotor period in female hamsters is longer in the dark vs the daily light phase (<a href=\"#bib48\">Prendergast et al., 2012</a>), is consistent with the LD cycle and/or the circadian pacemaker affecting DUO rhythmicity by altering (extracellular) DA. Note however, that dopamine content in whole brain extracts from circadian-intact rats kept under LD showed a strong ultradian variation with no obvious evidence for a diurnal rhythmic component (<a href=\"#bib53\">Scheving et al., 1968</a>). Also, microdialysis did not reveal a day:night difference in extracellular DA levels in the striatal NAcc region when measured in DD (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chung et al., 2014</a>). This same study reported elevated DA levels and hyperactivity in mice lacking clock gene <i>Rev-erb\u03b1</i>, suggesting that the circadian clock, possibly intrinsic to DA neurons themselves, has a role in DA regulation. Indeed, knockdown of the core circadian clock component <i>Clock</i> in DA neurons of the murine VTA, increases electrical firing rate in VTA neurons and enhances locomotor response to novel objects (<a href=\"#bib42\">Mukherjee et al., 2010</a>). Interestingly, we did not observe any systematic differences in ultradian locomotor period between SCNx and <i>Bmal1</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mice in constant darkness conditions, regardless of DAT status (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1, 2</a>), suggesting that extra-SCN circadian clocks have no role in DUO-mediated ultradian locomotor rhythm generation."

Interestingly, the dopamine system has been also implicated with another behavioral timing system: the food-entrainable oscillator (FEO). This circadian independent oscillator (<a href=\"#bib47\">Pitts et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Pendergast et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Storch and Weitz, 2009</a>) drives food-anticipatory locomotor activity (FAA) that emerges when food access is restricted to a few hours each day (<a href=\"#bib39\">Mistlberger, 2011</a>). D1 (DRD1) and D2 (DRD2) receptor antagonists attenuate FAA additively (<a href=\"#bib37\">Liu et al., 2012</a>) while pharmacological DRD2, but not DRD1, activation altered the phase of FAA (<a href=\"#bib57\">Smit et al., 2013</a>). Most recently, using knockout mice, it was revealed that DRD1 but not DRD2 is necessary for the appropriate expression of FAA and that rescuing dopamine signaling selectively within the dorsal striatum was sufficient to restore FAA in dopamine-deficient mice (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gallardo et al., 2014</a>). Given the links to the dopaminergic system, it will be of interest to investigate whether the DUO has a role in the temporal regulation of FAA."

Considering that the DUO is a universal driver of ultradian behavioral rhythms in mammals, the finding that ultradian bouts of running-wheel and feeding activity are co-expressed in the common vole (<a href=\"#bib67\">van der Veen et al., 2006</a>) suggests that dopamine can synchronously drive food seeking and general activity, which is in line with the view that dopamine acts as a general promoter of motivated arousal."

This was followed by 2 hr incubation with secondary antibodies (anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 567 and anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 647, 1:250, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) after which sections were mounted on superfrost slides (VWR, Radnor, PA), coverslipped with Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Labs, Burlington, Canada) and imaged by fluorescence microscopy (AxioObserver Z1, Zeiss, Jena, Germany).

For cosinor computation, we first determined the locomotor period of <i>Bmal1</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mice by Lomb-Scargle periodogram analysis of 20 hr of locomotor recordings following dialysate sampling. The determined period was then used as an input parameter for a least-squares cosinor analysis (<a href=\"#bib43\">Nelson et al., 1979</a>) using a custom script and function written for Matlab (<a href=\"https://github.com/storchlab/Cosinor-FDR.git\">https://github.com/storchlab/Cosinor-FDR.git</a>). This procedure generated a best-fit (co)sine wave modeling the activity time-series. This model wave was then used to assess the concordance between the extracellular DA fluctuations and locomotor oscillations. To calculate FDR, we randomly permutated the temporal order of the measured DA concentrations 100,000 times, and assessed its fit to the cosinor. The permutation procedure will degrade the fit of any truly rhythmic signal but will have little to no effect on noisy or flat profiles. The probability of false discovery was calculated as the percentage of randomly permuted traces that show an equal or better fit to the cosinor than the measured DA fluctuation."

For example, mice lacking DA are, indeed, hypoactive and they become extremely hyperactive in response to drugs that restore DA, but then paradoxically they have another bout of DA-independent activity 24-30 hours later. When this experiment is performed in obese mice (leptin deficient), there can be several very robust bouts of DA-independent activity that appear to be circadian (Sczcypka et al., 1999, PNAS 96, 12138; Szczypka et al., 2000, Nat Genet 25, 102). These results suggest that bouts of activity can be entrained by surges in DA signaling but can be maintained without DA; thus, some other circuit must maintain the rhythms."

The erroneous impression of genotypic differences in activity levels is likely due to the fact that <i>Slc6a3</i><sup><i>-/-</i></sup> mice typically exhibit fewer but longer and more consolidated (less fragmented) activity bouts, leading to higher peak activity levels (in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Similarly, these bout-character differences likely account also for the erroneous impression of differences in daily running wheel activity (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). Together, the new data supports our original analysis in that it is the pattern of locomotion, which is substantially altered by DAT removal, whereas the total daily activity is not."

For example, mice lacking DA are, indeed, hypoactive and they become extremely hyperactive in response to drugs that restore DA, but then paradoxically they have another bout of DA-independent activity 24-30 hours later. When this experiment is performed in obese mice (leptin deficient), there can be several very robust bouts of DA-independent activity that appear to be circadian (Sczcypka et al., 1999, PNAS 96, 12138; Szczypka et al., 2000, Nat Genet 25, 102). These results suggest that bouts of activity can be entrained by surges in DA signaling but can be maintained without DA; thus, some other circuit must maintain the rhythms</i>."

However, we do not think that the results presented in this study (and the Szczypka et al., 2000 study) particularly refute the hypothesis that DA acts as a key element of the ultradian rhythm generation process. As the DD mice examined in these studies were circadian competent and given that the DA-independent activity bout emerged \u223c24hrs after the previous bout, it seems plausible that this DA-independent bout is driven by the circadian clock in the SCN and/or other sites (possibly involving input to midbrain DA neurons, other ascending arousal nuclei, or striatal post-synaptic neurons)."

Thus, the current state of knowledge suggests that DA acts as the key mediator of DUO action (in addition to being a period determinant), while other (circadian) cues are able to engage arousal/locomotion circuitry in a DA/DUO independent fashion (this view is e.g. also supported by the presence of a daily, night-time activity bout in addition to the circadian day-time activity bout in Meth-treated, wild-type mice; see actogram in <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>)."
