The aim is to activate a specific neuron and then see which other neurons are activated shortly afterwards, revealing a connected circuit. However, exposure to light can be imprecise. Also, the neurons in the brain are so densely packed that the nerve endings from neighboring neurons often overlap without actually being connected. This makes it unclear if activated neurons are truly part of the same circuit or simply bystanders reacting to the same nearby blast of light."

Understanding the precise patterns of connectivity among the distinct types of neurons that comprise neural circuits is critical for elucidating circuit function and ultimately requires methods that can map functional connectivity with single-cell resolution. Optical activation of single neurons using two-photon excitation of caged neurotransmitters or optogenetic probes such as channelrhodopsin (ChR2) provides a powerful approach for assessing the synaptic connections of single neurons. In particular, optogenetic mapping utilizing ChR2 and the rapidly expanding family of opsin variants have increased the flexibility and precision of mapping paradigms. Variations in the single-channel properties of the opsins can be exploited to generate rapid action potential trains or sustained depolarizations (<a href=\"#bib13\">Mattis et al., 2012</a>), and new red-shifted variants have facilitated excitation deeper in tissue and have enabled simultaneous optical control of two distinct neuronal populations (<a href=\"#bib8\">Klapoetke et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Lin et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Yizhar et al., 2011</a>). In addition, genetic restriction of opsin expression using transgenic mouse lines enhances the ability to activate and assess the connectivity of specific cell types."

First, two-photon activation of single neurons with ChR2 is complicated by its kinetics and low single-channel conductance. A diffraction-limited spot does not activate sufficient channels simultaneously to reliably bring neurons expressing ChR2 to action potential threshold. Several solutions have been implemented to address this. Rapid scanning of a diffraction-limited two-photon excitation spot across an opsin-expressing cell allows sufficient temporal integration to generate action potentials (<a href=\"#bib20\">Packer et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Prakash et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Rickgauer and Tank, 2009</a>). Alternatively, scanless two-photon excitation by temporal focusing (<a href=\"#bib17\">Oron et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Zhu et al., 2005</a>) increases the number of simultaneously excited opsin molecules by expanding the beam in the imaging plane without sacrificing the optical sectioning of multiphoton microscopy (<a href=\"#bib1\">Andrasfalvy et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Losonczy et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Papagiakoumou et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Rickgauer et al., 2014</a>).

                        "text": "While these approaches have made it possible to provide sufficient two-photon illumination to reliably drive action potentials, the ability to use optogenetic stimulation to selectively target single neurons remains challenging because the opsins are expressed throughout the dendritic and axon terminal fields, generating a potential confounding source of light-induced electrical responses. For example, it can be difficult to know whether a recorded electrophysiological event is due to stimulation of a presynaptic cell or 'direct' stimulation of a portion of the recorded cell\u2019s dendritic arbor. Although these possibilities can be distinguished by their kinetics, large amplitude direct responses may obscure simultaneous smaller synaptic events. This essentially leaves an indeterminate region of any circuit 'map' coinciding with the dendritic arbors of the recorded neuron, which can extend for 200 \u00b5m or more around the soma. In addition, the optogenetic approach could be compromised by unintended activation of fibers of passage or local axonal boutons, which are known to respond to temporal focusing of two-photon excitation (<a href=\"#bib1\">Andrasfalvy et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Losonczy et al., 2010</a>). Exclusion of opsins from axonal compartments has previously been achieved by fusing the opsin with targeting domains that bind to myosin Va motors necessary for transporting proteins into dendrites; one such motif from melanophilin is sufficient to exclude ChR2 from axons and enhance the resolution of neural circuit maps (<a href=\"#bib9\">Lewis et al., 2009</a>). The resulting ChR2 distribution, however, remains throughout the dendritic tree and thus does not solve the problem of undesired direct activation of a neuron\u2019s processes while trying to stimulate other neurons in close proximity."

Our alternative targeting approach took advantage of the Kv2.1 potassium channel, which has a particularly unique localization to clusters at the neuronal soma and proximal dendrites (<a href=\"#bib30\">Trimmer, 1991</a>) achieved through a 66-amino acid domain in its C-terminus (<a href=\"#bib10\">Lim et al., 2000</a>) that drives its association with myosin IIb and specific post-Golgi transport vesicles destined for the somatic compartment (<a href=\"#bib7\">Jensen et al., 2014</a>). Furthermore, this targeting signal is sufficient to alter ChR2 trafficking in retinal ganglion cells (<a href=\"#bib32\">Wu et al., 2013</a>). We have employed this approach to target ChR2 to the soma and proximal dendrites of neurons in somatosensory cortex and added a nuclear fluorescent tag to identify ChR2-expressing neurons for targeting a two-photon temporal focused mapping beam. We combined this soma-targeted ChR2 with verification of successful action potential generation with a genetically encoded calcium indicator in our mapping protocol. Our approach allows robust and precise activation of neurons in brain slices for the construction of functional synaptic connectivity maps with single-cell resolution without loss of information about local connections in the region of the dendritic arbor of the recorded neuron or inadvertent activation of axons."

The stimulation power for these experiments was determined independently for each neuron to be the minimum that elicited a single action potential in 10 out of 10 trials when the TF spot was placed directly over the soma; this value was 0.92 \u00b1 0.24 mW/\u00b5m<sup>2</sup> for targeted ChR2 and 1.65 \u00b1 0.26 mW/\u00b5m<sup>2</sup> for the nontargeted version, owing to the increased sensitivity of the targeted construct (see below). Dendrites were followed throughout the depth of the tissue and areas were selected for stimulation such that the dendrite was planar throughout the extent of the 10 \u00b5m TF disc. The TF-stimulated current declined ~10-fold at 50 \u00b5m from the soma with\u00a0the targeted construct, versus two\u00a0fold for the non-targeted construct (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>; N=10 untargeted cells from four animals and N=13 targeted cells from six animals). The reduced dendritic ChR2 in the targeted construct opens up the possibility of using light stimulation with patch recording to identify synaptic currents that originate from nearby neurons. To illustrate this point, we compared the spatial distribution of direct currents recorded in Layer II/III pyramidal neurons in acute slices of somatosensory cortex expressing non-targeted and targeted constructs while sequentially stimulating points at 20 \u00b5m intervals over a 300\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0300 um grid surrounding the soma. Stimulation of cells expressing non-targeted ChR2-evoked currents up to 200 \u00b5m away from the neuronal soma, often delineating a pattern indicative of the dendritic arbor of the cell (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). In contrast, cells expressing the targeted construct exhibited significant currents only when stimulated within the 25\u201350 \u00b5m immediately adjacent to the cell body. The lack of direct light-activated currents throughout much of the neuron\u2019s dendritic field makes it possible to visualize synaptic currents that would be evoked by ChR2 activation of nearby presynaptic neurons, even those that lie within the neuron\u2019s dendritic field."

We also saw processes reminiscent of axons at distances of several hundred microns away from the cell bodies of conventional ChR2-positive neurons. To functionally characterize the extent of axonal opsin expression, we again patched layer II/III pyramidal neurons in acute coronal brain slices of somatosensory cortex and recorded light-activated currents in voltage clamp while stimulating multiple positions along putative axonal processes, which were distinguished by their thin profile, absence of spines, and presence of occasional varicosities. Although the amount of detected current decreased rapidly for both constructs as TF stimulation was moved along the axon, noticeable currents could be detected at distances of 50 \u00b5m or greater from the soma of cells expressing nontargeted ChR2 (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>). In contrast, cells expressing targeted ChR2 demonstrated an 80% reduction of current when stimulating just 20 \u00b5m down the axon and significantly less current than cells expressing nontargeted ChR2 throughout its examined length (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3C</a>)."

We measured the spatial resolution of action potential generation by moving the TF spot to different lateral and axial locations relative to a patched neuron expressing targeted ChR2 and examining the proportion of 10 trials that resulted in an action potential when using the threshold stimulation intensity. The full-width at half maximum of these measurements was 11.1 \u00b5m laterally and 23.3 \u00b5m axially (N=10 cells from 7 animals; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C and D</a>). Similar measurements using nontargeted ChR2 demonstrated resolution of 19.6 \u00b5m laterally and 36.2 \u00b5m axially (N=13 cells from 5 animals; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C and D</a>); both curve fits were significantly different from the targeted ChR2 versions (p&lt;0.05 by F-test). In terms of temporal precision, the mean latency from light onset to generation of a single action potential in the above experiments was 38.98\u00a0\u00b1\u00a017.33 ms; the average jitter (defined as the standard deviation of the latency across the ten trials for a given cell) was 6.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.1 ms. Increasing stimulation power beyond threshold provoked additional action potentials and eventually shortened the latency to first spike to 9.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.8 ms (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), consistent with reported values for stimulating cortical neurons with sculpted light (<a href=\"#bib24\">Papagiakoumou et al., 2010</a>). Targeted ChR2-expressing cells exhibited shorter action potential latencies than nontargeted ChR2 cells at equivalent stimulation intensity, consistent with latency being power-dependent and the earlier observation that targeted ChR2 is more sensitive. Although we concentrated efforts on longer stimulation pulses to increase the number of spikes and facilitate calcium imaging (see below), we verified the performance of targeted ChR2 under a shorter stimulation regimen. Temporal focusing pulses of 32 ms were effective at generating action potentials in opsin-expressing cells, and targeted ChR2 exhibited greatly enhanced photocurrents and lower power thresholds under these conditions (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Moreover, the ability to reduce latency to less than 10 ms with increased power (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) suggests that even shorter stimulation pulses may still be effective. Therefore, the combination of temporal focusing and soma-targeted ChR2 expression yields a highly reliable and spatially precise means to stimulate action potentials with somatic illumination."

We generated a bicistronic adeno-associated virus (AAV) construct encoding targeted ChR2-Kv2.1 followed by a P2A ribosomal skipping sequence and a histone 2B-mRuby2 fusion protein to fluorescently label neuronal nuclei to identify cells for TF stimulation. We patched a cell in layer II/III, and then stimulated surrounding cells that had been identified by nuclear mRuby2 fluorescence. Action potential firing in a light-stimulated neuron was verified by an increase in the fluorescence signal measured with the genetically encoded calcium sensor GCaMP6s (<a href=\"#bib2\">Chen et al., 2013</a>) expressed from a separate AAV construct. For these experiments, we used an average stimulation power (2.29\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.55 mW/\u00b5m<sup>2</sup>) that, when combined with a 150 ms stimulation pulse, frequently led to trains of 2\u20134 action potentials in the patched cells and facilitated detection of larger calcium transients. We used an imaging power and dwell time that did not lead to action potential generation in any cells recorded, instead causing an average inward current of 29.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.5\u2009pA (N\u00a0= 7 cells from 5 animals)\u2014well below the average rheobase. The ability to identify a ChR2-Kv2.1-expressing neuron for TF stimulation by the presence of a fluorescent nuclear label and verify that the neuron has in fact been stimulated successfully by detecting calcium transients with GCaMP is a key advantage for the execution and interpretation of mapping experiments."

Although we were able to detect putative synaptic connections, they were frequently coincident with direct current responses indicative of stimulation of the patched cell\u2019s dendritic arbor (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Across the experiments, such direct responses occurred during stimulation of 28.75\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.46% of the target cells within a single field of view. These direct responses were often large in amplitude and could easily obfuscate much smaller synaptic events associated with bona fide connections. Moreover, we also observed reproducible calcium transients in off-target cells when other target cells were being stimulated (note events in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a> that lie off of the diagonal). These off-target responses occurred with a probability (the number of events divided by the number of target cells) of 15.17\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.79% and likely result from unintentional stimulation of a ChR2-containing sensitive dendrite of one cell while intending to activate the soma of a separate cell. Consistent with this interpretation, these off-target calcium events were observed at a significantly lower frequency in experiments with the targeted opsin (5.42\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.39%, p&lt;0.01 by two sample t-test). Moreover, the average distance between a cell exhibiting an off-target calcium transient and the intended target cell was greater with nontargeted ChR2 (40.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.4 \u00b5m versus 18.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.4 \u00b5m; p&lt;0.01 by two sample t-test), further suggesting that cells expressing nontargeted ChR2 were firing action potentials in response to unintended stimulation of distal dendrites. Our combination of TF and restricted ChR2 thus facilitated the mapping of local circuitry within the 300 \u00b5m surrounding a neuron without confounding signals from its dendritic arbor and with a higher throughput than that achieved with electrophysiological techniques alone."

The spatially restricted ChR2 expression we describe allows unmasking of synaptic connections from neurons whose somata lie close to the dendrites of the postsynaptic cell and would have been occluded by direct activation of ChR2 on the dendrite. In addition, depletion of ChR2 from axons prevents inadvertent depolarization of boutons or fibers of passage that could compromise attempts to identify the source of a synaptic event. ChR2 harboring the Kv2.1 localization motif also showed enhanced sensitivity, which is of particular use in situations where excitation power is at a premium. Together these features of the soma-restricted construct significantly enhance the ability to map synaptic connections with single-cell resolution."

This restriction requires the identification of a relatively small compartment near the neuronal soma characterized by selective expression of particular proteins with known motifs responsible for their localization. The distribution of particular voltage-gated potassium channels defines such a subcellular domain along the soma and proximal dendrites (<a href=\"#bib31\">Trimmer, 2015</a>), and the sufficiency of a short Kv2.1 C-terminal sequence for driving heterologous proteins to this region (<a href=\"#bib10\">Lim et al., 2000</a>) made this strategy ideal for restricting ChR2 expression. The only obvious alternative is restriction to the axon initial segment (AIS) mediated by an ankyrin G binding motif present in voltage-gated sodium channels (<a href=\"#bib5\">Garrido et al., 2003</a>). Although incorporating this motif into ChR2 drives its localization to the AIS (<a href=\"#bib6\">Grubb and Burrone, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Wu et al., 2013</a>), the resulting construct does not support light-generated action potentials under physiological conditions (<a href=\"#bib6\">Grubb and Burrone, 2010</a>). Moreover, AIS-targeted ChR2 alters the intrinsic firing properties of retinal neurons, presumably by displacing endogenous voltage-gated sodium channels whose subcellular localization is also dependent on ankyrin G binding (<a href=\"#bib34\">Zhang et al., 2015</a>). Therefore, the Kv2.1 targeting strategy currently remains the optimal means of concentrating ChR2 such that action potentials will not be generated by TF stimulation of dendrites &gt;20 \u00b5m away from the soma. Indeed, this approach has been successfully used with opsins to artificially generate center-surround receptive fields in retinal ganglion cells (<a href=\"#bib32\">Wu et al., 2013</a>). The <a href=\"#bib32\">Wu et al. (2013)</a> study showed functional restriction of opsins to the soma and proximal dendrites by examining receptive field responses to wide (200\u00a0\u00b5m) bars of one-photon light. We have now measured the somatic targeting at a finer scale, demonstrated two-photon excitation of targeted ChR2 that is enhanced relative to normal ChR2 under the same conditions, and established the utility of targeted opsins for enhancing the resolution of local connectivity maps of neural circuits."

The relative merit of the optical activation method depends on the axial resolution, temporal precision required and the number of neurons to be stimulated simultaneously in a given experimental paradigm. For example, rapid scanning of a diffraction-limited two-photon excitation spot in a pattern on the soma can generate action potentials (<a href=\"#bib20\">Packer et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Prakash et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Rickgauer and Tank, 2009</a>) and combination with spatial light modulators allows for simultaneous excitation of neuronal ensembles (<a href=\"#bib20\">Packer et al., 2012</a>, <a href=\"#bib21\">2015</a>). The temporal resolution of this rapid scanning approach, however, is limited by the time required to scan along the cell body. Scanless activation of untargeted ChR in brain slices using TF, alone or in combination with spatial light modulators, is capable of generating action potentials in hippocampal pyramidal neurons within 1\u20133 ms of light onset (<a href=\"#bib1\">Andrasfalvy et al., 2010</a>) and in cortical neurons in less than 10 ms (<a href=\"#bib24\">Papagiakoumou et al., 2010</a>). We did not take full advantage of the temporal precision capability of TF to fire action potentials in our current study, instead focusing on a screening method that would identify connections without optimizing the amount of power that would fire each potential presynaptic neuron with minimal latency. We therefore chose longer pulses at a power sufficient to fire most neurons and generate trains of action potentials, which would elicit stronger signals with calcium indicators. For experiments requiring temporal precision, the minimization of action potential latency requires optimization of excitation area and laser power (<a href=\"#bib22\">Papagiakoumou et al., 2008</a>). Because power is also the limiting factor in extending the area of two-photon activation to large numbers of neurons with spatial light modulators, the reduced power required to bring soma-targeted opsins to threshold would be an asset to such experiments."

For GCaMP6s and similar sensors, there appears to be a balance between sufficient expression to detect single action potentials and excessive levels that lead to a lack of responsiveness (<a href=\"#bib2\">Chen et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Packer et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Tian et al., 2009</a>). Targeting this expression window can be complicated, particularly when simultaneously trying to achieve high opsin levels using a separate AAV construct. Indeed, heterogeneity in GCaMP expression levels between neurons with viral infection may be partially responsible for the 20% of neurons in which we did not detect a change in GCaMP fluorescence with TF stimulation. We have also explored the co-expression of GCaMP6s as the second member of a single P2A-mediated bicistronic construct, but the GCaMP6s expression level was lower than desired, resulting in inadequate detection of action potentials (data not shown). Future development of these techniques will therefore benefit from bypassing viral systems and instead expressing the calcium sensor or the opsin in transgenic animals. The enhanced sensitivity of the targeted ChR2 should alleviate the concern that there would be sufficient opsin expression from a single genetic locus for activation of neurons with two-photon excitation."

Moreover, the somatic restriction of membrane-bound genetically encoded voltage sensors could dramatically reduce background associated with the neuropil and facilitate an all-optical version of our current method. Because the Kv2.1 targeting sequence is unable to restrict the distribution of the single-pass membrane protein CD8, however, there may be certain structural constraints on the effectiveness of the motif (<a href=\"#bib10\">Lim et al., 2000</a>). We suspect that at least for the opsins, which are all seven transmembrane domain proteins likely to have a similar structure, the Kv2.1 motif will be sufficient to achieve somatic localization."

These enhancements to probing brain microcircuitry through optical stimulation promise to reveal much about nervous system function and how it might be modified by experience and perturbed in animal models of neurologic or psychiatric disease."

Standard stimulation protocols used 150\u00a0ms pulses, except as noted in the text. Stimulation powers were measured after the objective, and ranged from 15 to 285 mW; assuming our spot size to be at least 10\u00a0\u00b5m in diameter, we are using powers of no greater than 0.2 to 3.6 mW/\u00b5m<sup>2</sup>. This calculation assumes a completely flat excitation profile; in reality, there is some spread in the axial dimension and thus, the power density is probably even lower. Cells filled with fluorescent Alexa dyes were visualized by two-photon microscopy and recorded in whole-cell voltage or current clamp as the temporal focusing spot was moved to different axial planes, different cell bodies or particular spots along dendrites. For each dendrite examined, the temporal focusing-induced current was plotted as a function of distance from the cell soma; the resulting curves were averaged for each construct to generate the traces shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>. All responses in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> were verified to exhibit kinetics associated with direct stimulation of the patched cells: that\u00a0is, exhibiting onset and offset precisely locked to the start and end of the optical stimulation. Stimulation powers were chosen separately for each cell by identifying the minimum power that evoked action potentials continually across ten trials. Resolution of spike generation was measured by moving the stimulation spot at 9 \u00b5m intervals laterally or 10 \u00b5m axially above or below the cell soma and recording the proportion of trials out of 10 leading to an action potential. Data were collected from cells until a minimum of ten cells was obtained for following ChR2 expression along dendrites; given a standard deviation of ~11% for these measurements, our sample size should be able to detect a 15% difference between groups with a power of 0.8.

In this manner, a calcium peak in any frame could be associated with stimulation of a particular point in the field. During each stimulation epoch, microscope PMTs were protected from saturating fluorescence signals by Uniblitz shutters (Vincent Associates, Rochester, NY). Because this resulted in a lack of signal in the first 150\u00a0ms of every other frame as the top portion of the microscope field was scanned by the imaging laser, all stimulation points and calcium data collection were confined to a ~200\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0300\u00a0\u00b5m region of the microscope field. First-pass regions of interest (ROIs) were based on the stimulation points defined by labeled nuclei; frames containing significant calcium transients were then used to manually refine each ROI to define the soma of a responsive cell. For each ROI, the change in fluorescence relative to baseline (\u25b3F/F) was computed based on a baseline period of 10 frames prior to the onset of any stimulation. Significant calcium transients were defined as events of greater than three standard deviations above the mean for a duration of at least 2 frames. Cells with baseline GCaMP6s signals of more than 2 standard deviations above the mean in a given experiment were excluded from analysis, as GCaMP overexpression can lead to aberrant responsiveness (<a href=\"#bib2\">Chen et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Packer et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Tian et al., 2009</a>).

Detected connections were confirmed to be excitatory in nature by altering the holding potential of the patched cell to demonstrate a reversal potential of ~0\u00a0mV. Connectivity rate was defined as then number of pairs with calcium transients in the presynaptic neuron and postsynaptic currents divided by the number of presynaptic neurons with calcium transients stimulated."

This point is particularly weak considering that in several parts of the manuscript the authors insist on the \"enhanced sensitivity \"of the targeted opsin. Overall this implies that the opsins (somatic or not) used in this experiments are not very efficient and may not be suitable for experiments requiring e.g. multi-spot stimulation. Many datapoints e.g. the ones showing cellular resolution, or the connectivity experiments, are only performed using the targeted opsins and it is difficult to appreciate their importance if one can't compare the same experiments performed with the non-targeted version."

This point is particularly weak considering that in several parts of the manuscript the authors insist on the \"enhanced sensitivity \"of the targeted opsin. Overall this implies that the opsins (somatic or not) used in this experiments are not very efficient and may not be suitable for experiments requiring e.g. multi-spot stimulation.

Our manuscript reports excitation powers of between 15 and 285 mW (for both types of opsins); assuming our spot size to be at least 10\u03bcm wide and 10\u03bcm thick, we are using powers of no greater than 0.2 to 3.8 mW/\u03bcm<sup>2</sup>. This approaches but does not surpass excitation powers of 0.45 mW/\u03bcm<sup>2</sup> reported by the Emiliani group, but differences in opsin delivery and expression may account for some of the discrepancy. Finally, Rickgauer et al.
