To examine signal transmission through sub-cellular compartments and its effect on transcription levels in individual cells within a population, we used the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway as a model system. Wnt signaling orchestrates a response through nuclear accumulation of \u03b2-catenin in the cell population. However, quantitative live-cell measurements in individual cells showed variability in nuclear \u03b2-catenin accumulation, which could occur in two waves, followed by slow clearance. Nuclear accumulation dynamics were initially rapid, cell cycle independent and differed substantially from LiCl stimulation, presumed to mimic Wnt signaling. \u03b2-catenin levels increased simultaneously at adherens junctions and the centrosome, and a membrane-centrosome transport system was revealed. Correlating \u03b2-catenin nuclear dynamics to <i>cyclin D1</i> transcriptional activation showed that the nuclear accumulation rate of change of the signaling factor, and not actual protein levels, correlated with the transcriptional output of the pathway."

To examine signal transmission through sub-cellular compartments and its effect on transcription levels in individual cells within a population, we used the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway as a model system. Wnt signaling orchestrates a response through nuclear accumulation of \u03b2-catenin in the cell population. However, quantitative live-cell measurements in individual cells showed variability in nuclear \u03b2-catenin accumulation, which could occur in two waves, followed by slow clearance. Nuclear accumulation dynamics were initially rapid, cell cycle independent and differed substantially from LiCl stimulation, presumed to mimic Wnt signaling. \u03b2-catenin levels increased simultaneously at adherens junctions and the centrosome, and a membrane-centrosome transport system was revealed. Correlating \u03b2-catenin nuclear dynamics to <i>cyclin D1</i> transcriptional activation showed that the nuclear accumulation rate of change of the signaling factor, and not actual protein levels, correlated with the transcriptional output of the pathway."

The interaction of \u03b2-catenin with transcription factors of the TCF/LEF family in the nucleus modifies gene expression of crucial genes, thus leading to changes in key cellular pathways, such as proliferation, migration and cell fate (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cadigan and Waterman, 2012</a>). Mechanistically, in the absence of Wnt, cytoplasmic \u03b2-catenin protein is constantly degraded (<a href=\"#bib66\">Stamos and Weis, 2013</a>) via the \u2018destruction complex\u2019 and proteosomal degradation (<a href=\"#bib1\">Aberle et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Salomon et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Orford et al., 1997</a>), thus preventing \u03b2-catenin nuclear targeting. In many pathological cases \u03b2-catenin is not degraded but accumulates in the nucleus and activates genes, some of which are associated with cell proliferation, such as <i>MYC</i> and <i>cyclin D1</i> (<a href=\"#bib65\">Shtutman et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Tetsu and McCormick, 1999</a>).

Since high overexpression conditions of YFP-\u03b2-catenin typically result in increased subcellular distribution and high accumulation in the nucleus prior to any signal (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1b</a>), which is in stark contrast to the endogenous \u03b2-catenin protein that is observed mainly at the membrane (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1c</a>), we screened and identified a clone that stably expressed low levels of YFP-\u03b2-catenin. The clone phenotypically resembled endogenous protein localization and distribution, namely, membrane localization in the non-induced state, and enhanced nuclear localization following Wnt stimulation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1d</a>). Characterization of endogenous \u03b2-catenin and YFP-\u03b2-catenin accumulation levels by Western blotting showed that YFP-\u03b2-catenin expression levels were\u00a0~80% of the endogenous \u03b2-catenin, thus doubling \u03b2-catenin levels in the cell, and that the accumulation dynamics of both proteins were identical (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1e</a>).

Nuclei of cells showing nuclear \u03b2-catenin, either after 2 hr of Wnt3a activation or transiently overexpressing \u03b2-catenin, were photobleached, and nuclear import of \u03b2-catenin was monitored over time (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1a</a> top). The dynamics were relatively slow, however, the import rate under Wnt3a conditions was more rapid than transient overexpression, showing the advantage of measurements performed at low expression conditions (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1a,b</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1b</a>). The incomplete recovery of YFP-\u03b2-catenin during the FRAP time-course meant that a significant population of \u03b2-catenin molecules had already accumulated and had been retained in the nucleus prior to photobleaching. Next, we photobleached the cytoplasm and found that the rate of \u03b2-catenin shuttling out from the nucleus was slower than the import rate (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1a</a> bottom, c, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1c</a>). Similarly, fluorescence loss in photobleaching (FLIP), either in the nucleus or in the cytoplasm, showed that \u03b2-catenin shuttling out of the nucleus was slower than its nuclear entry (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1d</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1d</a>). Altogether, the data suggest that Wnt signaling causes a transient shift in the dynamic interplay between \u03b2-catenin stabilization and degradation processes, towards protein stabilization and accumulation."

However, the averaged behavior of a population does not necessarily represent the actual dynamics in individual cells. Examining the dynamic behavior of \u03b2-catenin accumulation in the nucleus and cytoplasm of individual cells after Wnt3a showed that although an increase in \u03b2-catenin levels was initiated in most cells, the subsequent dynamics were variable (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a,b</a>, <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>). For instance, comparing cells 1,2 and 4 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a</a>) showed a major and rapid wave of \u03b2-catenin nuclear accumulation in cell 1 (30\u2013165 min) that subsided and then mildly rose again (465\u2013585 min); a similar range of events occurred in cell 2 but the two waves were less intense and the second wave occurred earlier compared to cell 1 (first wave 30\u2013150 min, second wave 330\u2013435 min); in contrast, cell four showed a longer accumulation period (30\u2013240 min). Cells 3 and 6 showed slow nuclear accumulation, peaking late only after 825 min and 525 min, respectively, from Wnt3a stimulation. This analysis showed that the dynamic behavior of \u03b2-catenin in the cytoplasm and the nucleus was highly similar within the same cell, but that the time-frames of accumulation could be quite different between individual cells, some showing two cycles of nuclear accumulation. In these cases, the first cycle of accumulation lasted 360 min on average and the second cycle 180 min on average."

                                "text": "The similar dynamics of decline in \u03b2-catenin levels in the nucleus and the cytoplasm suggests that \u03b2-catenin is not simply shuttling in and out of the nucleus, but rather reflects an enhanced activity of the degradation arm controlling \u03b2-catenin levels. To test this, we added lithium chloride (LiCl, 20 mM), a glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03b2 (GSK3\u03b2) inhibitor that mimics Wnt signaling (<a href=\"#bib43\">Klein and Melton, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Hedgepeth et al., 1997</a>). Indeed, LiCl caused \u03b2-catenin nuclear and cytoplasmic accumulation, but the dynamics were completely different than Wnt3a (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1a,b</a>, and <a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a>). \u03b2-catenin accumulation occurred synchronously and continuously throughout 10\u201311 hr in all cells, and only then did the accumulation cease. The increasing accumulation rate of change (\u0394I/\u0394t) in the nucleus and cytoplasm continued for 10 hr, compared to 3 hr, in response to Wnt3a (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1c,d</a>). The levels of \u03b2-catenin were 4-fold higher in LiCl treated cells compared to Wnt3a. Since LiCl prevents \u03b2-catenin degradation, we hypothesized that Wnt3a treatment together with the proteasome inhibitor MG132, which stabilizes \u03b2-catenin, but not through GSK3\u03b2 phosphorylation, should have a similar effect on \u03b2-catenin dynamics. Indeed, accumulation dynamics under Wnt3a+MG132 were similar to LiCl treatment (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1e</a>). Treatment with MG132 without Wnt3a showed the same dynamics (data not shown). When the curve describing the dynamics of \u03b2-catenin in response to Wnt3a (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2c</a>) was fitted with a two-phase exponential fit that describes production and degradation (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1e</a>), we found linear accumulation in the first phase, showing that degradation was very low, as expected (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hern\u00e1ndez et al., 2012</a>). \u03b2-catenin production rates did not change significantly during the accumulation and clearance phases, whereas, the degradation rate became predominant during the clearance phase. \u03b2-catenin degradation had a characteristic time of 2.75 hr. These data exemplify the difference between a signaling molecule and a chemical that target the same signaling pathway. While drug action is less influenced by endogenous molecules, a signaling molecule will relay a transient signaling effect, depending on the level of other signaling molecules that are present in the cell at the time of induction."

However, a low correlation score (0.28) was observed for the Wnt3a-treated cells, and a more prominent correlation score (0.53) in LiCl-treated cells (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2f,g</a>). The latter was expected due to the continuous accumulation over time. But for Wnt3a treatment, this meant that a longer Wnt3a signaling response did not necessarily result in higher levels of \u03b2-catenin accumulation. Moreover, calculating the integral of the fluorescence signal that accumulated over the whole observation period in a cell population (from <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>), showed that the total accumulation in most cells was similar (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2h</a>), and that differences between single cells were pronounced mainly at earlier time points of the response."

In order to determine whether the variabilities in \u03b2-catenin dynamics in the cell population in response to Wnt3a, may be due to the cell cycle stage, we examined time-lapse movies in which cells had undergone mitosis, and in which daughter cells could be identified. For example, in the population of cells seen accumulating \u03b2-catenin in response to Wnt3a in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4b</a> (<a href=\"#media5\">Video 5</a>), there were two dividing cells at the beginning of the movie, both with low \u03b2-catenin levels prior to mitosis. In the daughter cells originating from the top dividing cell there was low \u03b2-catenin accumulation, whereas in the bottom dividing cell, one daughter cell responded rapidly and accumulated very high levels of \u03b2-catenin, while the other daughter cell responded later and accumulated to low levels (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4b\u2013e</a>).

Not much is known about the subcellular localization of this \u03b2-catenin population in response to Wnt. Before treatment, \u03b2-catenin was observed as a string of punctate sub-regions distributed along the cell outline only at cell-cell contacts (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a</a>, <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>). Since we could detect changes in the intensity of the puncta after Wnt, we followed the intensity of \u03b2-catenin at the membrane during Wnt activation and found an increase with similar dynamics to the cytoplasmic and nuclear sub-populations (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5a</a>, <a href=\"#media8\">Video 8</a>). There was no obvious reduction in the membrane levels even after many hours (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5b</a>). However, the relative increase at the membrane was lower than the nucleus and the cytoplasm, and the rate of \u03b2-catenin accumulation (\u0394I/\u0394t) at the membrane was less rapid than the nuclear accumulation rates (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5b,c</a>). LiCl caused longer \u03b2-catenin accumulation times and significantly higher accumulation at the membrane (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5c,d</a>)."

This phenomenon was frequently seen in cells treated with Wnt3a, LiCl and MG132, and less frequently in unactivated cells. We did not observe a correlation with the timing of Wnt addition, and perhaps detection was easier after Wnt due to the increase of \u03b2-catenin at the membrane following stimulation. Tracking of the detached \u03b2-catenin puncta showed that they reached the centrosome between 30 to 90 min after detachment. To examine whether the residence times of \u03b2-catenin molecules at the centrosome resembled the membrane region, we performed FRAP analysis, which showed very rapid recovery kinetics at the centrosome, in comparison to all other cell regions (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). This implied that \u03b2-catenin duration at the centrosome is short-lived, with a half-time of fluorescence recovery (t<sub>1/2</sub>) of 1.9 s, similar to other centrosomal components (<a href=\"#bib25\">Hames et al., 2005</a>). Altogether, this suggests that the molecular interactions of \u03b2-catenin at the membrane in adherens junctions are significantly more stable than at the centrosome, where the exchange of \u03b2-catenin molecules is highly rapid."

Cells returned to steady state activity levels after 6 hr. We examined several parameters of the transcriptional response. First, we measured the time for an active CCND1-MS2 transcribing gene to appear in the population. In the control unstimulated population (mock conditioned medium), after 120 min most cells had activated the gene once, whereas in Wnt3a-induced cells, gene activation in the population was reached more quickly, already after 60 min. The response time for <i>CCND1</i> activation following Wnt3a was also short, ranging at 15 min (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7a\u2013b</a>).

We measured a 1.5\u20131.7 increase in the maximum MS2-GFP intensity levels, and observed that the maximum intensity distribution for Wnt3a-treated cells shifted such that many more cells displayed higher levels of gene activity (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8a,b</a>, and <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1d</a>). The time required to reach the maximum point of activity did not seem to change when examining the whole population (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1e</a>). However, this time was actually shortened from 170 min to 120 min in cells where the gene was initially inactive, and the distribution of cells shifted to shorter times to reach maximum levels of transcription (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8c</a>). This time did not change in cells where the gene was initially active (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8d</a>). When gene activity and gene inactivity patterns were further examined, not only was an expected increase in the duration of gene activity found, but also a reduction in the rest duration. This means that Wnt activation not only increases the duration time for gene activity, but also reduces periods of inactivity by increasing the frequency of promoter firing events (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

To further examine this on the single mRNA level, we performed quantitative RNA FISH on CCND1-MS2 mRNA molecules in parallel to measuring \u03b2-catenin nuclear levels within the same single cell (fixed cells). We counted the number of cellular and nascent CCND1-MS2 mRNAs in Wnt3a-treated cells (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8e</a>) and compared this value to the accumulation levels of nuclear \u03b2-catenin in the different cells. Cells that had accumulated \u03b2-catenin had significantly higher numbers of cellular CCND1-MS2 mRNAs (3-fold; <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8e,f</a>) and nascent CCND1-MS2 mRNAs (3.8-fold; <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8e,g,j</a>), which correlated well with the transcription measurements in living cells (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1c</a>). Correlating between cellular and nascent CCND1-MS2 mRNA numbers and \u03b2-catenin levels showed two sub-populations of high- and low-expressing CCND1-MS2 cells, in correlation with nuclear \u03b2-catenin accumulation, respectively (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8h,i</a>). Regarding gene activation, altogether we find that Wnt signaling leads to increased promoter firing frequency, increased gene activity duration time, reduced gene rest time, and significantly higher numbers of mRNAs in the cell."

These dynamics have been characterized using microscopy studies performed in single cells. Biochemical examination of these dynamics can give a true sense of the time-scales of the accumulation as seen by studying protein levels in Western blots (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hern\u00e1ndez et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Lustig et al., 2002</a>). However, such approaches cannot provide an accurate temporal dynamic profile of the response as it unfolds within the cell, since they represent an average picture of the behavior of the whole cell population from which the proteins were extracted (<a href=\"#bib47\">Levsky and Singer, 2003</a>). By characterizing \u03b2-catenin accumulation dynamics in several subcellular compartments within individual living cells, we could examine how varying responses in individual cells translate into a well-timed response of the cell population."

Even though Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling has been highly studied, the basic propagation dynamics of this signal in single living cells have not been characterized. This is due to the lack of an appropriate system that would allow analysis of the behavior of a fluorescent \u03b2-catenin protein that resembles the endogenous protein (<a href=\"#bib68\">Tan et al., 2014</a>). Previous studies using transiently overexpressed \u03b2-catenin and photobleaching methods were important in establishing the characteristics of its intra-cellular mobility (<a href=\"#bib44\">Krieghoff et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Jamieson et al., 2</a><a href=\"#bib33\">011</a>). However, the subcellular distribution of transiently overexpressed fluorescent \u03b2-catenin is different than the endogenous protein, since the overexpressed protein is found throughout the whole cell including the nucleus (even without a signal), membrane staining is lacking, and cytoskeletal organization is disrupted (<a href=\"#bib44\">Krieghoff et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Jamieson et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Ligon et al., 2001</a>). Even the use of nanobodies targeting endogenous \u03b2-catenin in living cells did not mimic the membrane localization of non-induced cells (<a href=\"#bib71\">Traenkle et al., 2015</a>). Hence, using our cell system in which YFP-\u03b2-catenin was stably expressed at relatively low levels (80% over the endogenous protein) and was distributed similarly to the endogenous protein, we were able to follow the subcellular dynamics of \u03b2-catenin in real-time."

However, examination of the accumulation profiles in single cells showed response patterns deviating from the average behavior in at least 20% of the population; accumulation rates and levels varied, and in some cells additional but less intense waves of \u03b2-catenin nuclear accumulation were observed. We suggest that the balance between accumulation and degradation affects the outcome in \u03b2-catenin build-up in each cell. The Kirschner group has shown (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hern\u00e1ndez et al., 2012</a>) that Wnt does not completely abolish the activity of the destruction complex. We therefore suggest that if the total levels of accumulation are similar in most cells (e.g. integral analysis), then the level of inhibition of the destruction complex is expected to vary in each cell and to determine the response."

Possibly, later phases of \u03b2-catenin nuclear accumulation could have an influence on prolonging <i>CCND1</i> activity (steady state activity levels return after 6 hr). Indeed, measurements of <i>CCND1</i> activity in living cells following Wnt activation showed a positive change in several parameters relating to gene activation; not only did the frequency of <i>CCND1</i> activation in the cell population rise and the time to activate <i>CCND1</i> shorten, but the levels of <i>CCND1</i> transcriptional output increased, the timeframe of gene activity became substantially longer, and gene resting periods were shortened. Overall, this means that Wnt signaling increases the number of CCND1 mRNAs generated, by increasing the frequency of RNA polymerase II recruitment to the promoter and by lengthening the time of promoter responsiveness. Interestingly, even when an already active <i>CCND1</i> gene received the Wnt signal, the levels of gene activity increased."

This fits in well with a previous study demonstrating that the fold change in \u03b2-catenin nuclear levels is the element affecting target gene activity (<a href=\"#bib20\">Goentoro and Kirschner, 2009</a>), and that the transcriptional machinery is capable of computing the fold change in \u03b2-catenin, thereby determining the transcriptional response (<a href=\"#bib20\">Goentoro and Kirschner, 2009</a>). Similar behavior was observed for the ERK signaling pathway (<a href=\"#bib13\">Cohen-Saidon et al., 2009</a>). Hence, it is not the absolute number of \u03b2-catenin molecules in the nucleus that correlates with transcription rates, but the rate of change of \u03b2-catenin levels over time, and particularly the rapid change during the first phase of induction that elicits the transcriptional effect (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9b</a>).

(<b>b</b>) Scheme of the dynamic changes occurring in the studied cell system following Wnt signaling. Top - from left to right: Levels of \u03b2-catenin (yellow) in the nucleus are normally low but after the\u00a0addition of Wnt3a to the medium a significant and rapid increase in the nucleus is observed, peaking after 2\u20133 hr. \u03b2-catenin levels later decline in the nucleus and cytoplasm due to degradation. While this is the average behavior in the population (e.g. cells 1 and 2), when examining individual cells, different dynamics such as multiple pulsations (e.g. cell 3) and rapid initial accumulation (e.g. cell 4) are observed. \u03b2-catenin levels increase simultaneously at the membrane and at the centrosome. Bottom- \u03b2-catenin induces cyclin D1 transcriptional activity (green dot), and modulation of the\u00a0transcriptional reaction can be observed as the gene reaches higher levels of activity, for longer periods of time. The rate of change in \u03b2-catenin accumulation (blue curve, top), rather than the actual levels of \u03b2-catenin in the nucleus, correlate with the kinetics of transcriptional activation."

Generally, while the nuclear accumulation of \u03b2-catenin has been the focus of Wnt signaling studies, the membrane region has not been considered a major target of the response. However, one study has shown localization of unphosphorylated \u03b2-catenin to the membrane upon Wnt activation within 30 min, in cells lacking E-cadherin, although the function was unclear (<a href=\"#bib28\">Hendriksen et al., 2008</a>). We found increased \u03b2-catenin levels in the membrane following Wnt activation. The punctate membranal pattern persisted during activation, suggesting that Wnt increases the recruitment of \u03b2-catenin to existing adherens junctions. Indeed, \u03b2-catenin dynamics in the membrane showed a relatively slow exchange both before and after Wnt activation, similar to a study conducted in LiCl induced cells (<a href=\"#bib35\">Johnson et al., 2009</a>). This implies long residence times of \u03b2-catenin in the membrane and that potential binding sites for \u03b2-catenin molecules at adherens junctions exist constantly, and only when the protein becomes abundant, do they fill up."

The exact function is not clear and it probably plays a role in regulation of cell separation. It has been suggested that Wnt signaling abolishes the phosphorylation of \u03b2-catenin and leads to centrosome splitting (<a href=\"#bib23\">Hadjihannas et al., 2010</a>). Our study shows for the first time, the highly rapid accumulation rates of \u03b2-catenin at the centrosome in real-time, following Wnt signaling. \u03b2-catenin at the centrosome is highly mobile as seen in our FRAP study and in another (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bahmanyar et al., 2008</a>). Interestingly, we identified a connection between the membranal and centrosomal \u03b2-catenin fractions. Puncta of membranal \u03b2-catenin were detected moving relatively slowly from the membrane region and ending up at the centrosome, sometimes several in parallel in the same cell. Since unphosphorylated \u03b2-catenin is found in the membrane after Wnt (<a href=\"#bib28\">Hendriksen et al., 2008</a>), we can postulate that the \u03b2-catenin fraction moving to the centrosome is unphosporylated, and may be involved in driving cell division."

Single-cell analysis revealed significant variability in the dynamics of \u03b2-catenin nuclear buildup, but also that most cells did finally accumulate the same total level of \u03b2-catenin over time. This behavior is quite different than the serum activation pathway that activates \u03b2-actin via MAL shuttling (<a href=\"#bib36\">Kalo et al., 2015</a>). \u03b2-actin transcriptional activation begins less than 5 min after serum addition, and \u03b2-actin alleles respond in the same manner and same time-frame; i.e. variability of the response in single cells is low. Hence, some signaling cascades must relay the information rapidly and tightly since this will lead to the translation of a highly required protein, e.g. \u03b2-actin, to generate a protein that is required for cell motility in response to environmental sensing (<a href=\"#bib40\">Kislauskis et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Latham et al., 1994</a>). Other pathways such as Wnt/\u03b2-catenin may also signal to activate gene expression, but their response emerges much later, probably since the required biological outcomes, such as cell proliferation, require more regulation points. The changes in \u03b2-catenin levels in response to Wnt, in several subcellular compartments, indicate that the signaling pathway does not only activate gene expression but is involved in additional processes. Further studies should reveal the exact roles of these subpopulations of \u03b2-catenin in response to signal transduction."

For time-lapse imaging, cells were plated on glass-bottomed tissue culture plates (MatTek, Ashland, MA) coated by Cell-Tak (BD Biosciences) in medium containing 10% FBS at 37\u00b0C. The microscope is equipped with an incubator that includes temperature and CO<sub>2</sub> control (Life Imaging Services, Reinach, Switzerland). For long-term imaging, several cell positions were chosen and recorded by a motorized stage (Scan IM, M\u00e4rzh\u00e4user, Wetzlar-Steindorf, Germany). In these experiments, HEK293 Flp-in CCND1-MS2 expressing MS2-GFP cells were imaged in 3D (26 planes per time point) every 15 min, at 0.26 \u00b5m steps for 6 hr. HEK293 Flp-in CCND1-MS2 cells expressing YFP-\u03b2-catenin were imaged in 3D (15 planes per time point) at 0.7 \u00b5m steps, every 15 min, up to 18 hr. For presentation of the movies, the 4D image sequences were transformed into a time sequence using the maximum or sum projection options or manually selecting the in-focus plane using the ImageJ software. Time-lapse data were collected from single cells in several fields and on several days until reaching an appropriate sample size, and then all single-cell data were pooled and either averaged and presented as plots, or presented as single cell data."

Experiments were performed at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> using a live-cell chamber system (Tokai). For each acquisition, YFP-\u03b2-catenin was bleached using the 491 nm laser. Six pre-bleach images were acquired. In FRAP, post-bleach images were acquired every 0.8 s for 80 s in the cytoplasm and the nucleus, every 1 s for 2 min in adherens junctions, every 0.4 s for 40 s at the centrosome, and every 1.5 s for 8 min to measure nuclear import and export rates. In FLIP, images were acquired every 1.9 s for 280 s in the cytoplasm and the nucleus. The experiments were analyzed using ImageJ macros previously described (<a href=\"#bib2\">Aizer et al., 2008</a>). Data from at least 10 experiments for each cell line were collected and the averaged FRAP and FLIP measurements were fitted by Matlab with a double exponential model:"

Their assays seem to indicate that the addition of Wnt3a has the same effect on the expression of YFP-\u03b2-catenin as it has on the endogenous \u03b2-catenin. In contrast, the addition of LiCl seems to induce a higher expression of YFP-\u03b2-catenin than that of the endogenous \u03b2-catenin. (The error bars in the quantification histogram of the LiCl WB are quite big, are these significant?). Following these experiments the authors conclude that the exogenously expressed YFP-\u03b2-catenin can be used in the further experiments as it behaves similarly to the endogenous protein. Nevertheless, in these YFP-\u03b2-catenin cells the total amount of \u03b2-catenin is the double than that in wild type cells and this \u03b2-catenin overexpression could lead to misinterpretations."

At present the authors give the impression that the study is performed in a system in which the total \u03b2-catenin is at endogenous levels. It would be better to use a cell line in which the FP tag is knocked in to the wild type \u03b2-catenin locus.

This is a potential weakness of the manuscript that is also reflected in the model, where one does not know in which \u03b2-catenin-containing/expressing nucleus the CCND1 transcription is increased, when comparing the cells drawn in the upper row and in the lower row. Would it be possible to quantify the CCND1 transcription in the YFP-\u03b2-catenin containing nuclei and correlate the CCND1 expression with the YFP-\u03b2-catenin signal in a single cell based measurement series?"

However, the total cellular count represents the accumulation of RNA over the lifetime of RNA molecules, which could be hours.

In order to demonstrate in single cells within a population that \u03b2-catenin nuclear accumulation correlates with high CCND1 mRNA levels, we counted single mRNA molecules in single cells expressing the YFP-\u03b2-catenin protein using RNA FISH, after Wnt addition for 2 hours. We show that cells in the population that have high YFP-\u03b2-catenin nuclear accumulation also have significantly higher numbers of the mRNA. We also perform correlation analysis showing the connection between YFP-\u03b2-catenin and mRNA numbers. This now appears in a new <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a> (after reviewer 2 suggested we remove the old <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). Furthermore regarding what is driving the differences between the response in different cells, we have fit the curve in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a> that describes the accumulation and reduction dynamics of YFP-\u03b2-catenin in the cell population, and modeled the data. Using this we can now better describe the accumulation phase that does not include degradation, as well as the clearance phase in which degradation kicks in."

The Kirschner group has shown (Science 2012) that Wnt does not completely abolish the activity of destruction complex. So we suggest that if the total levels of accumulation are similar in most cells (integral analysis) then is should be the level of inhibition of the destruction complex that varies in each cell and that determines the response."

Obviously, we have tried repeatedly over the years to get this to work in living cells in two colors, but to no avail. We attempted different approaches, and decided to remain with the cell clone expressing the YFP-\u03b2-catenin protein so not to begin characterizing another cell clone, but this meant that we could not co-express the GFP-MS2 protein in this clone together with YFP-\u03b2-catenin due to the GFP/YFP overlap. Following the request during the first revision, we increased our efforts and began purchasing many types of transfection reagents, and started cloning new versions of either CFP or mCherry MS2-CP, in order to obtain a stable clone with two colors. However, we did not obtain any stable clones by the end of the first revision. Transient transfections did not produce any useful data either because of inefficiency of transfection under these conditions and typical overexpression of the MS2-CP, which masked the transcription site of the single gene. Therefore, to obtain reliable and comparable data we required a stable clone. We have continued trying to generate stable clones with additional types of transfection reagents we purchased during then second revision cycle. We also obtained other MS2-CP plasmids, but all these efforts have been unsuccessful. Perhaps the cells are not very receptacle to the stable integration of additional constructs, because they have already been grown with 3 types of antibiotics. The bottom line is that despite many efforts and financial investment, we have not been able to establish this analysis in two colors in living cells."

Following the criticism by reviewer 1 in the last revision cycle, we have added to the quantification also the number of nascent mRNAs in each cell. The original logic for presenting the cellular mRNAs was that we thought this quantification presents the accumulative response to Wnt over several hours that can be extracted from a static picture, whereas looking at the levels of gene activity (nascent mRNAs) in some cases might not always give the right impression because the gene might have turned off exactly when the image was acquired. Still, we agree that quantifying the nascent mRNAs in parallel to \u03b2-catenin levels gives a complete picture of all parameters that are responding to the Wnt signal, and now present all the data in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>."
