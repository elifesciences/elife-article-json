However, the properties of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals that mediate this effect remain unclear. Here, using hippocampal neurons labeled with the fluorescent Ca<sup>2+</sup> probes Fluo-4 or GCAMP5, we visualized action potential-independent Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in dendritic regions adjacent to fluorescently labeled presynaptic boutons in physiological levels of extracellular Mg<sup>2+</sup>. These Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients required NMDA receptor activity, and their propensity correlated with acute or genetically induced changes in spontaneous neurotransmitter release. In contrast, they were insensitive to blockers of AMPA receptors, L-type voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, or group I mGluRs. However, inhibition of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release suppressed these transients and elicited synaptic scaling, a process which required protein translation and eukaryotic elongation factor-2 kinase activity. These results support a critical role for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release in amplifying NMDA receptor-driven Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals at rest for the maintenance of synaptic homeostasis."

Both groups are ion channels that regulate the flow of charged particles from one side of a cell's membrane to the other. In resting nerve cells, NMDA receptors are partially blocked by magnesium ions. However, the binding of the transmitter molecules to AMPA receptors causes these receptors to open and allow positively charged sodium ions into the cell. This changes the electrical charge across the cell membrane, which displaces the magnesium ions from the NMDA receptors so that they too open. Calcium ions then enter the cell through the NMDA receptors and activate a signaling cascade that leads to the production of new AMPA receptors."

This trickle of calcium triggers the release of more calcium from stores inside the cell, which amplifies the signal. The ultimate effect of the flow of calcium into the cell is to block the production of AMPA receptors, and ensure that the synapse does not become any stronger. As confirmation of this mechanism, Reese and Kavalali showed that simulating low levels of spontaneous activity by blocking the so-called \u2018calcium-induced calcium release\u2019 has the opposite effect. This led to more AMPA receptors being produced and stronger synapses. Taken together these findings indicate that spontaneous transmitter release exerts an outsized influence on communication between neurons by maintaining adequate levels of AMPA receptors via these \u2018amplified\u2019 calcium signals."

Most surprisingly, these studies have demonstrated that postsynaptic excitatory receptor blockade or inhibition of neurotransmitter release in addition to action potential blockade induces faster and more pronounced homeostatic synaptic potentiation (<a href=\"#bib38\">Sutton et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Nosyreva et al., 2013</a>). There is evidence that alterations in resting Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, partly triggered via activation of NMDA receptors at rest, is critical for these effects (<a href=\"#bib43\">Wang et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Nosyreva et al., 2013</a>). However, to date there is no direct information on the properties of dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals elicited by spontaneous release events under physiological circumstances. Our group's previous work as well as others used electrophysiology to show that, indeed, under physiological levels of extracellular Mg<sup>2+</sup> spontaneous miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) possess a sizable NMDA receptor-mediated component, indicating that NMDA receptors signal at rest under physiological conditions without requiring local AMPAR-mediated dendritic depolarizations (<a href=\"#bib10\">Espinosa and Kavalali, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Povysheva and Johnson, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Gideons et al., 2014</a>). The existence of an NMDA component within mEPSCs agrees with earlier estimates of incomplete Mg<sup>2+</sup> block of canonical NMDA receptors near resting membrane potentials, and therefore it does not necessarily involve NMDA receptor subunits with altered Mg<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity (<a href=\"#bib18\">Jahr and Stevens, 1990</a>). Nevertheless, the NMDA receptor Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx under these conditions is estimated to be small, corresponding to approximately 20% of the full Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx carried by unblocked NMDA receptors (<a href=\"#bib10\">Espinosa and Kavalali, 2009</a>). Therefore, as NMDA receptor-driven Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals at rest are expected to be relatively minor in magnitude, it remains unclear how their blockade could be critical in producing homeostatic synaptic scaling. To address this question, we visualized the resting NMDA receptor-driven Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals and found that they are amplified by a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release mechanism to elicit downstream signaling events. Importantly, based on this information, we also show that direct suppression of these resting Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals is sufficient to elicit eEF2 kinase dependent postsynaptic scaling."

To visualize synapses, both reporters were used on hippocampal neurons that were infected with lentivirus expressing the fusion protein Synaptobrevin2-mOrange (Syb2-mOrange) consisting of a chimera of the synaptic vesicle protein synaptobrevin2 with the pH sensitive red-shifted fluorophore mOrange (<a href=\"#bib32\">Ramirez et al., 2012</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A\u2013D</a>). In these experiments, the signal contribution of Syb2-mOrange during live imaging is negligible (see <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In Fluo-4 experiments, neurons were initially incubated and labeled with the membrane permeable analog of Fluo-4 (Fluo-4 AM) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) followed by dye removal and perfusion with a Tyrode's solution containing 2 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>, 1.25 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> as well as 1 \u03bcM tetrodotoxin (TTX) to block action potentials. Fluorescence images were collected at a frequency of 10 Hz and fluorescence intensity traces were generated for the regions of interest (ROIs) selected over Syb2-mOrange puncta which fluorescence was maximized at the end of each experiment using 50 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). Under these conditions, we could detect rapid Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients (miniature spontaneous calcium transients or mSCTs) with absolute values that were at least 2 standard deviations above the mean of the preceding baseline period (2 s) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). These events occurred at a frequency of 0.32 \u00b1 0.04 min<sup>\u22121</sup> per ROI, consistent with earlier estimates of the frequency of spontaneous fusion events per release site (<a href=\"#bib25\">Leitz and Kavalali, 2014</a>). Repeating the same experimental protocol with Fluo-4 AM in the absence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> did not yield a significantly different mSCT frequency (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>) suggesting that under physiological Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentrations we could detect a majority of mSCTs. Interestingly, even though the presence of extracellular Mg<sup>2+</sup> is expected to greatly diminish NMDAR current magnitudes (<a href=\"#bib10\">Espinosa and Kavalali, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Gideons et al., 2014</a>), imaging experiments did not reveal a significant difference in mSCT amplitudes detected in Mg<sup>2+</sup> (1.25 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> \u2206F/F<sub>o</sub> = 0.063 \u00b1 0.001, 0 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> \u2206F/F<sub>o</sub> = 0.067 \u00b1 0.002, p = 0.16, Student's unpaired t-test, N = 825 events from 8 experiments). The fact that mSCT amplitude was unaffected by extracellular Mg<sup>2+</sup> indicates mSCTs measured by Fluo-4 AM were not likely to be solely dependent on NMDA receptor activity."

First, we took advantage of the fact that the acute application of 100 mM hypertonic sucrose is known to produce an increase in mEPSCs (<a href=\"#bib11\">Fatt and Katz, 1952</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Rosenmund and Stevens, 1996</a>). To measure this effect, hippocampal pyramidal cells were voltage clamped at \u221270 mV while a baseline AMPA mEPSC frequency was collected in Tyrode's solution containing 1 \u00b5M TTX, 50 \u00b5M PTX and 50 \u00b5M AP5 for 2 min. Perfusion was then switched to Tyrode's containing 100 mM hypertonic sucrose as the recording continued for 2 min. Quantification of these recordings revealed a 2.6-fold increase in mEPSC frequency upon the addition of hypertonic sucrose (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). To test whether the increase in mEPSC frequency could drive an increase in mSCT frequency the experiment was repeated in neurons loaded with Fluo-4 AM. The baseline was collected in Tyrode's solution containing only TTX before changing to a solution containing TTX + 100 mM sucrose. The addition of hypertonic sucrose produced a 2.3 fold increase in mSCT frequency (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>), which supports the hypothesis that spontaneous glutamate release can drive the generation of postsynaptic calcium transients."

These mice die at birth; however, hippocampal neurons cultured from embryonic mice form synapses and manifest a virtual absence of evoked neurotransmission and highly diminished rate of spontaneous neurotransmitter release (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bronk et al., 2007</a>). In Fluo-4 AM imaging experiments with hippocampal cultures made from littermate control mice, the application of AP5 was able to produce a significant decrease in mSCT frequency compared to baseline recorded in TTX, as had been observed previously in wild-type rat cultures. Neurons derived from SNAP25 knock out animals had a significantly decreased baseline mSCT frequency. Also, these transients remained sensitive to AP5, which is again consistent with mSCT generation being driven by spontaneous vesicle release (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,D</a>)."

Therefore, in the next set of experiments we tested whether concurrent AMPA receptor activity augments NMDA receptor activity at rest through electrical means. Such synergy between the activation of the two types of receptors may be facilitated by dendritic spines that possess a high spine neck resistance that render them electrically isolated from the dendritic shaft (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bloodgood and Sabatini, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Harnett et al., 2012</a>) but see (<a href=\"#bib30\">Popovic et al., 2014</a>). In this way activation of AMPA receptors may result in sufficient local depolarization to facilitate relief of adjacent NMDA receptors from Mg<sup>2+</sup> block. Additionally, AMPA receptors lacking GluA2, which are calcium-permeable, could also contribute to these transients (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hollmann et al., 1991</a>). To examine the role of AMPA receptor activation on mSCTs, we performed the same analysis above in the presence of AMPA receptor antagonist 2,3-dihydroxy-6-nitro-7-sulfamoyl-benzo[f]quinoxaline-2,3-dione (NBQX). In these experiments NBQX (5 \u00b5M) did not affect mSCT frequency (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). This argues against a direct (e.g., via calcium-permeable GluA2 lacking receptors) or indirect (via local depolarization) contribution of AMPA receptors to mSCTs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>)."

                                "text": "In hippocampal pyramidal cells, NMDA receptor opening by evoked glutamate release elicits larger Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients through a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release mechanism (<a href=\"#bib24\">Lei et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Emptage et al., 1999</a>). In this form of signaling, the small Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient produced by the NMDA receptor opening raises internal Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations near ryanodine receptors (RyRs) on the endoplasmic reticulum high enough to cause their opening at which point a much larger transient is generated. To test whether this mechanism plays a role in the mSCTs we observe, we imaged with Fluo-4 AM in the presence of dantrolene, which is known to reduce the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity of RyR1 and 3 by blocking their interaction with calmodulin (<a href=\"#bib12\">Fruen et al., 1997</a>). Indeed, when compared to the TTX baseline, cells imaged with TTX + dantrolene had a significantly reduced mSCT frequency (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). This finding was validated by using ryanodine, which directly blocks all three RyR isoforms in a use-dependent manner (<a href=\"#bib16\">Hawkes et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Meissner and el-Hashem, 1992</a>). To facilitate use-dependent block of RyRs by ryanodine, the baseline mSCT frequency was first collected in TTX and then cells were perfused for 13 min with a solution containing 30 \u00b5M ryanodine without TTX to maximize RyR opening and ryanodine block. The cells were then perfused with Tyrode's containing TTX + ryanodine for 2 min before continuing the recording. Under these conditions, the application of ryanodine produced a \u223cfivefold decrease in mSCT frequency (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). In addition, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients that were detectable after ryanodine treatment were substantially decreased in amplitude suggesting that they are likely to be produced by a subpopulation of RyRs that remained unblocked or incompletely blocked (average TTX \u2206F/F<sub>o</sub> = 0.052 \u00b1 0.001, TTX + Ryanodine \u2206F/F<sub>o</sub> = 0.045 \u00b1 0.001, p = 0.002 Student's unpaired t-test, n = 199 events in TTX, 110 events in TTX + ryanodine, 8 experiments, 2 cultures). Treatment with dantrolene or ryanodine is presumed to decrease mSCT frequency by blocking RyRs responsible for producing the Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient. With these inhibitors present, further NMDA openings can no longer trigger an mSCT. In fact, the efficacy of ryanodine in this case allowed further investigation of the pure NMDA transient under these experimental conditions. We incubated neurons with ryanodine for 15 min to block RyRs and then loaded them with Fluo-4 AM as before. These cells were imaged in Tyrode's solution containing TTX but no extracellular Mg<sup>2+</sup> to allow maximal NMDA currents. Under these conditions Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients were observed, but when 1.25 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> was again added no further transients could be measured (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>). These results illustrate that under physiological concentrations of Mg<sup>2+</sup>, Fluo-4 cannot detect the NMDA Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient without further amplification from Ca<sup>2+</sup> induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release."

For this purpose, we investigated the role of mSCTs in homeostatic synaptic scaling, which is a compensatory mechanism where neurons scale the strength of their synaptic inputs multiplicatively in a uniform manner in response to global increases or decreases in activity (<a href=\"#bib42\">Turrigiano et al., 1998</a>). This response involves the synthesis and insertion of new AMPA receptors and can be strongly induced by blocking both action potentials and NMDA receptors (<a href=\"#bib40\">Sutton et al., 2004</a>). Importantly, although synaptic scaling in response to activity blockade occurs within a time frame of 24\u201348 hr, suppression of resting synaptic activity mediated by spontaneous neurotransmitter release events results in more rapid synaptic scaling detectable within hours (<a href=\"#bib38\">Sutton et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Nosyreva et al., 2013</a>). This suggests that NMDA receptor activation at rest maintains synaptic homeostasis. However, the mechanism by which NMDA receptor activity near resting membrane potentials signals to translation machinery, in particular to eEF2 kinase, has been unclear, especially when one considers the relatively small ion conductance of NMDA receptors at rest due to Mg<sup>2+</sup> block (<a href=\"#bib10\">Espinosa and Kavalali, 2009</a>)."

Neurons were then perfused with Tyrode's solution and whole cell voltage clamp recordings were made in 1 \u00b5M TTX, 50 \u00b5M PTX and 50 \u00b5M AP5 to isolate AMPA-mEPSCs. Under these conditions, the amplitude distributions of AMPA-mEPSCs obtained from neurons treated previously with TTX + ryanodine as well as those treated with TTX + AP5 showed a significant rightward shift towards larger amplitudes compared to the control condition (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>). When the collected mEPSC amplitudes were plotted rank order in control vs TTX + ryanodine, a linear fit revealed a scaling factor of 1.28 indicating that cell-wide, mEPSC amplitudes increased uniformly 28% over 3 hr with TTX + ryanodine treatment (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). This increase in mEPSC amplitudes was not as pronounced as was found with the positive control (TTX + AP5) which may correlate with the finding that ryanodine treatment does not block mSCTs as completely as AP5 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2D, 4E</a>). It is important to note that while other groups have reported an immediate decrease in mEPSC frequency with the acute application of ryanodine (<a href=\"#bib9\">Emptage et al., 1999</a>), in our system the mEPSC frequencies in neurons treated with ryanodine for 15 min were indistinguishable from those incubated with vehicle as control (TTX mEPSC freq = 7.59 Hz \u00b1 1.75, TTX + Ryanodine mEPSC freq = 8.92 \u00b1 1.13, p = 0.54 using Student's t-test, N = 7 cells from 5 coverslips, 2 cultures). Since the acute application of ryanodine does not alter mEPSC frequency in this system we believe the synaptic scaling effect mainly results from ryanodine acting at the postsynapse to block mSCT activity."

These transients are important because they are key to understanding the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling events occurring at rest that result in regulation of protein translation and gene transcription leading to synaptic plasticity (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chen et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Lalonde et al., 2014</a>) (for review see <a href=\"#bib19\">Kavalali, 2015</a>). Under these conditions we detected robust NMDA receptor dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients at a rate of 0.32 \u00b1 0.03 min<sup>\u22121</sup> where previously our group was able to measure a per synapse spontaneous release rate of 0.76 \u00b1 0.03 min<sup>\u22121</sup> by imaging with presynaptic probes (<a href=\"#bib25\">Leitz and Kavalali, 2014</a>). The relatively higher release rate measured earlier may suggest that not every release event is able to generate an mSCT. The link between these Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients and spontaneous neurotransmitter release was verified by the parallel increase in mSCT and spontaneous neurotransmitter release frequencies in response to application of hypertonic sucrose. Furthermore, the frequency of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients was also significantly diminished in neurons lacking SNAP-25, which show a substantial reduction in spontaneous release, and in cultures treated with NMDA receptor blockers."

This observation indicates that although mSCT generation depends on NMDA receptor driven Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, this does not result in strong signals at the postsynaptic density. Rather, mSCTs seem to rely on the activation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from smooth endoplasmic reticulum which is present in spines or adjacent dendritic regions (<a href=\"#bib37\">Spacek and Harris, 1997</a>)."

While all of these play a role in Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics under other circumstances the mSCTs we observed under resting conditions were primarily driven by the coupling of the NMDA receptor to internal Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores through the ryanodine receptor, as the application of dantrolene or ryanodine produced a marked reduction in both mSCT frequency and amplitude. Earlier studies performed in hippocampal synapses discovered that unitary evoked EPSCs were accompanied by Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients that were only minimally dependent on voltage gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels or AMPA receptors. However, unlike the mSCTs we observe, the application of ryanodine produced only a small reduction in Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient amplitude in these experiments (<a href=\"#bib22\">Kovalchuk et al., 2000</a>). This difference may suggest that spontaneous glutamate release-driven Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients are more dependent on internal Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores compared to Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients elicited by evoked release."

Our experiments showed that the synaptic scaling produced by the blockade of spontaneous NMDA-mEPSCs is also produced by blocking the Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from internal stores indicating a strong link between the two signals. The generation of relatively large store-driven Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients provides a critical amplification step for the relatively small NMDA-mEPSCs seen under physiological conditions (<a href=\"#bib10\">Espinosa and Kavalali, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Gideons et al., 2014</a>). The resulting signal is delocalized and pulsatile which may allow synaptic NMDA receptors to exert signaling influence in the surrounding dendritic regions. This could be critical for local translational control as eEF2 localizes to the dendritic shaft rather than dendritic spines (<a href=\"#bib2\">Asaki et al., 2003</a>). The low frequency of observed mSCTs may also be a defining attribute, as the ubiquitous Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding protein calmodulin is predicted to interact with different target kinases and enzymes based on the frequency and duration of its activation by free Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<a href=\"#bib34\">Saucerman and Bers, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Slavov et al., 2013</a>). Taken together these findings identify a critical missing mechanistic link between spontaneous neurotransmission and the control of dendritic signaling events that regulate synaptic efficacy."
