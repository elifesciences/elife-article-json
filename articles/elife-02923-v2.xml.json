Mutations in ryanodine receptor 1 (RyR1) are often associated with myopathies with microscopic core-like structures in the muscle fiber. In this study, we identify a mouse RyR1 model in which heterozygous animals display clinical and pathological hallmarks of myopathy with core-like structures. The RyR1 mutation decreases sensitivity to activated calcium release and myoplasmic calcium levels, subsequently affecting mitochondrial calcium and ATP production. Mutant muscle shows a persistent potassium leak and disrupted expression of regulators of potassium homeostasis. Inhibition of K<sub>ATP</sub> channels or increasing interstitial potassium by diet or FDA-approved drugs can reverse the muscle weakness, fatigue-like physiology and pathology. We identify regulators of potassium homeostasis as biomarkers of disease that may reveal therapeutic targets in human patients with myopathy of central core disease (CCD). Altogether, our results suggest that amelioration of potassium leaks through potassium homeostasis mechanisms may minimize muscle damage of myopathies due to certain RyR1 mutations."

Mutations in ryanodine receptor 1 (RyR1) are often associated with myopathies with microscopic core-like structures in the muscle fiber. In this study, we identify a mouse RyR1 model in which heterozygous animals display clinical and pathological hallmarks of myopathy with core-like structures. The RyR1 mutation decreases sensitivity to activated calcium release and myoplasmic calcium levels, subsequently affecting mitochondrial calcium and ATP production. Mutant muscle shows a persistent potassium leak and disrupted expression of regulators of potassium homeostasis. Inhibition of K<sub>ATP</sub> channels or increasing interstitial potassium by diet or FDA-approved drugs can reverse the muscle weakness, fatigue-like physiology and pathology. We identify regulators of potassium homeostasis as biomarkers of disease that may reveal therapeutic targets in human patients with myopathy of central core disease (CCD). Altogether, our results suggest that amelioration of potassium leaks through potassium homeostasis mechanisms may minimize muscle damage of myopathies due to certain RyR1 mutations."

Muscle biopsies of patients with myopathies and mutations in ryanodine receptor type 1 (RyR1) show centralized nuclei as well as disorganized areas in the center of the myofiber, called cores, that lack mitochondria and are devoid of metabolic activity, reflective of cellular damage.

In vitro, the potassium leak can be rectified through the application of higher concentrations of K<sup>+</sup> or inhibition of K<sub>ATP</sub> channels.

K<sub>ATP</sub>6.2 channels and other regulators of potassium transport are misexpressed in mutant muscle and may partly underlie the disease phenotype in this myopathic animal model. Finally, we find that human patients with CCD show dysregulation of genes involved in the control of potassium homeostasis and suggest that these may serve as important disease biomarkers."

To determine whether RyR1<sup>AG</sup> mutant protein affects calcium release, we examined the effects of treatment with 4-chloro-<i>m</i>-cresol (4-C<i>m</i>C), a potent activator of RyR1 in skeletal muscle and RyR2 in cardiac muscle (<a href=\"#bib78\">Zorzato et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Choisy et al., 1999</a>). The domain, which is activated by 4-CmC, is located between residues 4007 and 4180 of RyR1 (<a href=\"#bib22\">Fessenden et al., 2003</a>), near the <i>Ryr1</i><sup><i>AG</i></sup> mutation (E4242G). An increased sensitivity to 4-C<i>m</i>C has been linked to patients with malignant hyperthermia (<a href=\"#bib32\">Herrmann-Frank et al., 1996a</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Baur et al., 2000</a>) and ratiometric calcium imaging has been used to show hypersensitivity of 4-C<i>m</i>C in muscle cells from a patient with a mutation in RyR1 associated with malignant hyperthermia susceptibility (<a href=\"#bib62\">Roesl et al., 2014</a>). Thus, we performed ratiometric Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging using the calcium indicator, Fura-2 AM, and recorded the ratio of 340/380 nm fluorescence over a range of 4-C<i>m</i>C concentrations up to 1000 \u03bcM (<a href=\"#bib78\">Zorzato et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Herrmann-Frank et al., 1996b</a>). 4-C<i>m</i>C was applied to explanted soleus muscle from 2-month old <i>Ryr1</i><sup><i>AG/+</i></sup> and littermate controls and ratiometric data of individual muscle fibers were normalized to the fluorescent ratiometric intensity at 1000 \u03bcM 4-C<i>m</i>C for each group. In wild-type mice, application of 200 \u03bcM 4-C<i>m</i>C induced measurable changes in Fura-2 signal (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>; 20 individual fibers from 4 mice). However, in littermate <i>Ryr1</i><sup><i>AG/+</i></sup> muscle fibers, measurable changes in Fura-2 signal were not observed until the application of 600 \u03bcM 4-C<i>m</i>C (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>; 27 individual fibers from 5 mice).

In myotubes expressing malignant hyperthermia RyR1 cDNAs, myoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> is elevated due to a significant passive Ca<sup>2+</sup> leak from the SR (<a href=\"#bib76\">Yang et al., 2007</a>). However, in <i>Ryr1</i><sup><i>AG/+</i></sup> muscle fibers, we found that myoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels were significantly decreased compared to wild-type muscle fibers (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>; 85.3 \u00b1 2.2% in <i>Ryr1</i><sup><i>AG/+</i></sup> muscle fibers normalized to wild-type concentration).

To measure unidirectional ion flux through SOCE, we used Mn<sup>2+</sup> quenching of Fura-2 fluorescence in muscle fibers from <i>Ryr1</i><sup><i>AG/+</i></sup> and wild-type mice as Mn<sup>2+</sup> has an increased affinity to Fura-2 compared to Ca<sup>2+</sup>, thus decreasing Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent myoplasmic fluorescence.

Immediately following contraction, Ca<sup>2+</sup> is pumped back into the SR and taken up by adjacent mitochondria for the purpose of ATP production. The decrease in myoplasmic calcium could be due to decreased release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the SR or increased uptake of Ca<sup>2+</sup> by the mitochondria, which prompted us to evaluate mitochondrial function. Local calcium release mechanisms or calcium \u2018sparks\u2019 communicate with adjacent mitochondria to spatially confine Ca<sup>2+</sup> release (<a href=\"#bib60\">Rizzuto et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Hajnoczky et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Rizzuto et al., 1998</a>). In skeletal myotubes, RyR1 and RyR3 generate calcium sparks (<a href=\"#bib72\">Ward et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Weisleder et al., 2012</a>), with RyR1 being the predominant ryanodine receptor expressed in limb skeletal muscles (<a href=\"#bib47\">Marks et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Takeshima et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Otsu et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Zorzato et al., 1990</a>). In cardiac muscle, the in vivo depletion of RyR2 is sufficient to reduce mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, oxidative metabolism, and ATP levels (<a href=\"#bib9\">Bround et al., 2013</a>). Moreover, the activation of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> sparks can lead to the influx of mitochondrial calcium termed Rhod-2 labeled calcium \u2018marks\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib56\">Pacher et al., 2002</a>). Rhod-2 distributes to mitochondria when applied at low temperature and can be used as a measure of changes in fluorescence intensity (<a href=\"#bib69\">Trollinger et al., 1997</a>). Influxes in mitochondrial calcium induce increased fluorescence intensities in Rhod-2 labeled mitochondria. In Ringer's solution, the number of mitochondria with changes in fluorescence intensity over 10 min of imaging were significantly decreased in <i>Ryr1</i><sup><i>AG/+</i></sup> compared to <i>Ryr1</i><sup><i>+/+</i></sup> littermate isolated muscle fibers (6.1 \u00b1 1.1 compared to 10.2 \u00b1 1.4 per 1000 \u03bcm<sup>2</sup>; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>), but the Rhod-2 intensity changes in mitochondria were increased after the application of 4-C<i>m</i>C to the bath in both <i>Ryr1</i><sup><i>AG/+</i></sup> and <i>Ryr1</i><sup><i>+/+</i></sup> isolated fibers (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013D</a>). Recent evidence in a mouse model with an induced mutation in RyR1 illustrates that leakage of SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> induces ROS activation and mitochondrial dysfunction (<a href=\"#bib1\">Andersson et al., 2011</a>). However, no difference in MitoSOX, an indicator of superoxides, was detected in <i>Ryr1</i><sup><i>AG/+</i></sup> compared to <i>Ryr1</i><sup><i>+/+</i></sup> littermate 2-month old soleus muscle fibers (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>).

In human subjects that undergo fatigue, muscle fiber ATP levels can be reduced by up to 20% (<a href=\"#bib63\">Sahlin et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Karatzaferi et al., 2001a</a>, <a href=\"#bib40\">2001b</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Jones et al., 2009</a>), suggesting that the reduced ATP levels in <i>Ryr1</i><sup><i>AG/+</i></sup> muscle might impair ATP-dependent enzyme activity during and after contraction (<a href=\"#bib34\">Homsher, 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Clausen et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Smith et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Barclay et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Clausen, 2013b</a>). These data suggest that dysfunctional Ca<sup>2+</sup> release in RyR1<sup>AG</sup> muscle may influence mitochondrial function and ATP production. Together the SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> release deficiencies and decreased mitochondrial ATP production may be sufficient to induce the myopathic phenotype in <i>RyR1</i><sup><i>AG/+</i></sup> mice."

                                "text": "The significant depletion of ATP in <i>RyR1</i><sup><i>AG/+</i></sup> muscle could consequently affect ATP-dependent mechanisms that normally act within the muscle, such as the influx of potassium to enhance membrane excitability. To determine whether potassium homeostasis is disrupted in <i>Ryr1</i><sup><i>AG/+</i></sup> muscle, we used the potassium indicator PBFI-AM (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019) in combination with ratiometric potassium imaging of muscle fibers. Experiments using wild-type soleus in normal Ringer's solution (3 mM K<sup>+</sup>) showed that intracellular potassium concentration was 137 \u00b1 7 mM (n = 23 fibers from 4 mice; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,C</a>). However, <i>Ryr1</i><sup><i>AG/+</i></sup> muscle showed lower intracellular potassium concentrations of 106 \u00b1 8 mM (n = 29 fibers from 4 mice; p &lt; 0.005; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,C</a>), a similar decline as that observed for wild-type muscles undergoing fatigue (<a href=\"#bib49\">McKenna et al., 2008</a>). Moreover, <i>Ryr1</i><sup><i>AG/+</i></sup> muscle fibers showed a slow decrease in potassium fluorescent ratio intensity over the course of a minute suggesting an increase in K<sup>+</sup> ion permeability (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D,E</a>; n = 23 fibers in 4 <i>Ryr1</i><sup><i>AG/+</i></sup> mice and n = 29 fibers in 4 wild-type mice), which may be indicative of a potassium leak. We hypothesized that if <i>Ryr1</i><sup><i>AG/+</i></sup> muscles have a defect in potassium homeostasis due to an increase in K<sup>+</sup> ion permeability, it might be possible to decrease the semi-permeability of the K<sup>+</sup> ion with the addition of external K<sup>+</sup>. However, we did not observe a significant difference in serum K<sup>+</sup> levels in 2-month old <i>Ryr1</i><sup><i>AG/+</i></sup> mice, but there was a 12 \u00b1 3% increase in serum K<sup>+</sup> in 6-month old <i>Ryr1</i><sup><i>AG/+</i></sup> mice relative to wild-type (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, n = 6 samples per group per age for <i>Ryr1</i><sup><i>+/+</i></sup> and <i>Ryr1</i><sup><i>AG/+</i></sup>). The acute addition of 7 mM KCl to the muscle increased PBFI-AM fluorescence intensity, suggesting inhibition of a potassium leak, while 0 mM KCl decreased PBFI-AM fluorescence intensity (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D,E</a>; n = 23 fibers in 4 <i>Ryr1</i><sup><i>AG/+</i></sup> mice and n = 29 fibers in 4 wild-type mice). Glibenclamide (2 \u03bcM) selectively binds to and inhibits SUR1/2 (<a href=\"#bib59\">Porat et al., 2011</a>), subunits of the K<sub>ATP</sub>6.1 and K<sub>ATP</sub>6.2 channels in muscle (<a href=\"#bib57\">Pedersen et al., 2009</a>). In wild-type adult mouse skeletal muscle, glibenclamide protects against fatigue caused by tetanic force (<a href=\"#bib21\">Duty and Allen, 1995</a>). Additionally, in chick muscle fibers, glibenclamide increases the twitch and tetanus tension induced by application of caffeine, an agonist of RyR1 (<a href=\"#bib2\">Andrade et al., 2011</a>). The acute addition of 2 \u03bcM glibenclamide to the 3 mM KCl bath resulted in increased intracellular K<sup>+</sup> in wild-type (n = 17 fibers in 4 mice) and <i>Ryr1</i><sup><i>AG/+</i></sup> (n = 16 fibers in 4 mice) soleus muscle fibers (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D,F</a>). Upon bath application of 7 mM KCl for 1.5 hr to examine a continuous counterbalancing of the K<sup>+</sup> leak, the intracellular potassium concentration in the mutant soleus increased to 132 \u00b1 8 mM, similar to wild-type (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>, n = 25 fibers in 4 <i>Ryr1</i><sup><i>AG/+</i></sup> mice and n = 26 fibers in 4 wild-type mice). Upon bath application of 2 \u03bcM glibenclamide for 1.5 hr, the intracellular potassium concentration in the mutant soleus increased to 138 \u00b112 mM, similar to wild-type (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H</a>, n = 28 fibers in 4 <i>Ryr1</i><sup><i>AG/+</i></sup> mice and n = 28 fibers in 4 wild-type mice). The decline in intracellular K<sup>+</sup> fluorescence in <i>Ryr1</i><sup><i>AG/+</i></sup> muscle compared to wild-type muscle (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013E</a>) and the increase in intracellular K<sup>+</sup> upon K<sub>ATP</sub> channel inhibition (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G,H</a>) suggest an increase in K<sub>ATP</sub> channel activity in <i>Ryr1</i><sup><i>AG/+</i></sup> muscle. These data suggest that increased extracellular K<sup>+</sup> ion and inhibition of K<sub>ATP</sub> channels might prevent the excessive K<sup>+</sup> leak and protect the mutant muscle from decreased intracellular concentrations of K<sup>+</sup>."

In rat skeletal muscle, K<sub>ATP</sub>6.2 pores have a single-channel conductance of around 80 pS, although the current densities (pA) of K<sub>ATP</sub> channels can vary between muscles (<a href=\"#bib67\">Tricarico et al., 2006</a>). To examine current densities of K<sub>ATP</sub> channels in soleus muscle fibers, inside-out patch excision in ATP-free solutions was performed. Currents from excised patches of 2-month old wild-type soleus muscle fibers were \u2212106 \u00b1 12 pA with an average pipette resistance of 2.2 \u00b1 0.4 M\u03a9 after \u221260 mV voltage injection (n = 10 fibers from 3 mice). In 2-month old <i>Ryr1</i><sup><i>AG/+</i></sup> soleus muscle fibers, the currents increased to \u2212142 \u00b1 24 pA with an average pipette resistance of 2.3 \u00b1 0.3 M\u03a9 (n = 10 fibers from 3 mice). Thus, <i>Ryr1</i><sup><i>AG/+</i></sup> soleus muscle fibers showed a 34 \u00b1 9% increase in normalized current densities compared to wild-type littermates (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,D</a>). Glibenclamide addition removed the current differences between <i>Ryr1</i><sup><i>+/+</i></sup> and <i>Ryr1</i><sup><i>AG/+</i></sup> muscle, suggesting that the channels opened in the inside-out patch were K<sub>ATP</sub> channels (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,E</a>, n = 8 fibers from three mice for both <i>Ryr1</i><sup><i>+/+</i></sup> and <i>Ryr1</i><sup><i>AG/+</i></sup>).

The sulfonylurea receptors (SUR) are ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters and subunits of K<sub>ATP</sub> channels.

Serum potassium levels can be increased through diet (<a href=\"#bib13\">Christensen et al., 2010</a>) or with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, enalapril (<a href=\"#bib19\">Cleland et al., 1985</a>). Therefore, we asked whether these treatments might decrease K<sup>+</sup> ion permeability in muscle and whether this could ameliorate the physiological and pathological symptoms of the myopathy in <i>Ryr1</i><sup><i>AG/+</i></sup> mice. To test these hypotheses, <i>Ryr1</i><sup><i>AG/+</i></sup> and <i>Ryr1</i><sup><i>+/+</i></sup> mice were weaned onto 0.6% K<sup>+</sup> (level of potassium in standard mouse chow), and four weeks later, when muscle weakness is already observed (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a>), they were given either 5.2% K<sup>+</sup> diet or enalapril (0.02 mg/ml in drinking water) for an additional four weeks (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, for blood pressure readings). Examination of soleus muscle fibers from these mice showed that internal potassium concentrations were increased in <i>Ryr1</i><sup><i>AG/+</i></sup> soleus fibers, similar to wild-type, following 5.2% K<sup>+</sup> diet (145 \u00b1 22 mM compared to 147 \u00b1 20 mM; <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>) or with enalapril (147 \u00b1 18 mM compared to 148 \u00b1 25 mM; <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). As noted in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, weakness in 2-month old <i>Ryr1</i><sup><i>AG/+</i></sup> mice on 0.6% K<sup>+</sup> diets was clearly evident with an \u223c50% reduction in grip strength and inability to hang onto the wire, but in line with our hypothesis, <i>Ryr1</i><sup><i>AG/+</i></sup> mice treated with enalapril showed a significant improvement in the wire hanging task (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B,C</a>). Most dramatically, the 5.2% K<sup>+</sup> diet rescued muscle strength in <i>Ryr1</i><sup><i>AG/+</i></sup> mice (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B,C</a>).

To extend these findings in vivo, we asked whether this FDA-approved drug could ameliorate the myopathic pathology in mice. To test this, glibenclamide (15 mg/kg/day) was orally administered to 1-month old mice for 30 days. <i>Ryr1</i><sup><i>AG/+</i></sup> mice treated with glibenclamide showed significantly increased grip strength (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A,B</a>). ATP content and mitochondrial calcium changes in intensities in glibenclamide treated <i>Ryr1</i><sup><i>AG/+</i></sup> mice were increased to similar levels as <i>Ryr1</i><sup><i>+/+</i></sup> mice (36.4 \u00b1 3.9 and 39.3 \u00b1 4.3 nmol ATP/mg soleus muscle, respectively; n = 4 mice per condition, <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>; 11.8 \u00b1 1.5 and 11.1 \u00b1 1.8 mitochondrial changes in intensities, respectively; n = 8 muscle fibers for each group, <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a>) with no alteration in MitoSOX labeling (data not shown). <i>Ryr1</i><sup><i>+/+</i></sup> and <i>Ryr1</i><sup><i>AG/+</i></sup> mice on glibenclamide therapy showed no significant difference in internal potassium concentrations (140 \u00b1 9 mM in <i>Ryr1</i><sup><i>+/+</i></sup> soleus fibers compared to 145 \u00b1 28 mM in <i>Ryr1</i><sup><i>AG/+</i></sup> soleus fibers; n = 17 and 20 muscle fibers, respectively; normalized in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E</a>). Current densities from <i>Ryr1</i><sup><i>AG/+</i></sup> soleus muscle fibers from mice treated with glibenclamide were \u221282 \u00b1 13 pA with an average pipette resistance of 2.1 \u00b1 0.3 M\u03a9 (n = 8 fibers from 4 muscles; <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8F</a>) and showed no significant difference from wild-type littermates on glibenclamide (\u221293 \u00b1 18 pA with 2.2 \u00b1 4 M\u03a9 tip resistance, n = 8 fibers from 4 muscles; <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8F</a>). Furthermore, a significant decrease in internal nuclei was detected in <i>Ryr1</i><sup><i>AG/+</i></sup> muscles (9.8 \u00b1 5.2 in 0.6% K<sup>+</sup> diet compared to 4.8 \u00b1 2.7 in glibenclamide diet; n = 4 mice per condition; <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8G</a>). Administration of glibenclamide also rescued the histological manifestations of the myopathy in <i>Ryr1</i><sup><i>AG/+</i></sup> mice (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8H\u2013K</a>, <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>), suggesting an alternative treatment with an FDA-approved drug that does not involve modulation of serum potassium levels. Together our in vivo data suggest that the mitochondrial dysfunction in <i>Ryr1</i><sup><i>AG/+</i></sup> soleus muscle is significantly improved through 5.2% potassium diets and glibenclamide administration. These studies suggest that rescue of the weakened state of muscles in this mouse myopathic model are, in part, due to a potassium-dependent mechanism."

First, we identified a mutation in <i>RyR1</i> that induces a myopathy with ultrastructural hallmarks of cores similar to the <i>Ryr1</i><sup><i>I4895T/+</i></sup> mutant mouse, a known mouse model of CCD (<a href=\"#bib8\">Boncompagni et al., 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib7\">2010</a>). Second, we used this myopathic mouse model to identify a novel link between decreased internal calcium (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>), decreased mitochondrial ATP production (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>), and altered potassium homeostasis (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>), mechanisms that are important in controlling excitability in muscle. Third, we provide evidence that K<sub>ATP</sub> channels are elevated in the membrane and overactive, leading to increased potassium efflux in this myopathic mouse model, which could have direct effects on membrane excitability. Fourth, we provide clinically relevant findings that suggest a potassium-enriched diet, perhaps in combination with the sulfonylurea class of anti-diabetic drugs, which are potential therapies for myopathies with defects in potassium homeostasis. Using multiple assays and different muscles with different fiber type compositions, our data are consistent and show muscle weakness, pathological changes, and gene expression changes. The consistency of our data between muscle types further strengthens our hypotheses and conclusions. It should be noted that malignant hyperthermia, a disease associated with <i>RyR1</i> mutations, is sensitive to potassium chloride (<a href=\"#bib51\">Moulds and Denborough, 1974</a>), and therefore a testing method in patients or biopsy samples need to be initiated prior to potassium supplementation. Importantly, our work identifies potential diagnostic biomarkers of disease in patients with CCD and potentially non-RyR1 myopathies, which could be utilized to identify patients who may be candidates for potassium modulation-based therapies."

One histological hallmark of RyR1-related myopathy is the presence of muscle cell cores, which indicate focal mitochondrial loss and decreased ATP production (<a href=\"#bib8\">Boncompagni et al., 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib7\">2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Jungbluth et al., 2011</a>). The <i>Ryr1</i><sup><i>AG/+</i></sup> mutant mouse muscles have decreased intracellular calcium, core-like structures and decreased ATP content, as well as other ultrastructural hallmarks of core-like diseases. Data from our model suggest that proper calcium release from internal stores is required for mitochondrial production of ATP and increased ATP levels, which in a feedback loop can then stimulate RyR1-dependent calcium release (<a href=\"#bib50\">Meissner et al., 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Laver et al., 2001</a>). As muscle ATP decreases, K<sub>ATP</sub> channels open to efflux K<sup>+</sup> from the myoplasm to the interstitial space, which may protect against excessive muscle contraction. Efflux of K<sup>+</sup> into the t-tubules depolarizes the tubular membranes and inhibits the opening of sodium channels (<a href=\"#bib24\">Fraser et al., 2011</a>). Sodium channel inhibition decreases the probability that a nerve-derived action potential will activate DHPR receptors that mechanically activate Ryanodine receptors, and thus myoplasmic release of stored Ca<sup>2+</sup> is reduced. Therefore, in the <i>Ryr1</i><sup><i>AG/+</i></sup> model, RyR1 dysfunction, decreased internal Ca<sup>2+</sup> release, potassium leakage and increased K<sub>ATP</sub>-dependent efflux may potentiate muscle weakness and muscle deterioration associated with core-like structures. The chronic low-level calcium uptake into the mitochondria may then induce long-term mitochondrial dysfunction. The histological appearance of cores in the center of the muscle but more normal staining near the plasma membrane may be explained by the possibility that more centralized mitochondria receive less calcium, whereas SOCE and calcium influx from external sources at the plasma membrane may provide buffering to mitochondria that are adjacent to the plasma membrane."

ATP provides the energy to cause muscle contraction, and relative ATP/ADP levels are important in providing information about muscle fatigue and ion homeostasis to the cell. In skeletal muscle, 90% of ATP is used for muscle contractions by the myosin ATPase, Ca<sup>2+</sup> ATPase, and Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ATPase (<a href=\"#bib34\">Homsher, 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Clausen et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Smith et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Barclay et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Clausen, 2013b</a>). Additional ATP-dependent enzymes may be particularly sensitive to a 30% loss of ATP in <i>RyR1</i><sup><i>AG/+</i></sup> muscle and this might contribute to a significant effect on excitability and membrane homeostasis after muscle contraction and fatigue. During skeletal muscle fatigue and fluctuations in potassium homeostasis, K<sub>ATP</sub> channels open and efflux potassium from the muscle (<a href=\"#bib57\">Pedersen et al., 2009</a>). Moreover, plasma membrane and t-tubule K<sub>ATP</sub> channels become more active as ATP is utilized and ADP accumulates (<a href=\"#bib3\">Baczko et al., 2005</a>). K<sub>ATP</sub> channels are mechanistically linked to the DHPR-RyR1 complex (<a href=\"#bib68\">Tricarico et al., 1999</a>) but the ATP binding sites within RyR1 are at a considerable distance from the point mutation in the RyR1<sup>AG</sup> protein (<a href=\"#bib58\">Popova et al., 2012</a>). Finally, K<sub>ATP</sub> channel activity increases potassium conductance within the t-tubules after an action potential (<a href=\"#bib27\">Gramolini and Renaud, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Cifelli et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Banas et al., 2011</a>).

The resulting increase in interstitial K<sup>+</sup> might counterbalance the K<sup>+</sup> leak permeability and increase membrane excitability. A more excitable membrane increases the likelihood of voltage-dependent DHPR-RyR1 release of calcium from the SR during an action potential. Increased calcium in the myoplasm will enhance mitochondrial uptake of calcium. We propose that the waves of increased calcium into the mitochondria enhance ATP production (<a href=\"#bib28\">Griffiths and Rutter, 2009</a>), which inhibits K<sub>ATP</sub> channel opening and reverses the K<sup>+</sup> leak, and stimulates RyR1-dependent calcium release from internal stores (<a href=\"#bib50\">Meissner et al., 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Laver et al., 2001</a>), further perpetuating mitochondrial ATP production in this model of myopathy in which the phenotype can be ameliorated by increased potassium. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that the potassium supplementation may work indirectly at the muscle by depolarizing the locomotor circuit to increase neurotransmitter release at the neuromuscular junction and potentiate the voltage-dependent DHPR-RyR1 release of calcium."

Altogether this may suggest an increase in interstitial K<sup>+</sup>, but serum K<sup>+</sup> levels may not correlate with interstitial K<sup>+</sup> levels (<a href=\"#bib16\">Clausen, 2013a</a>) and increased interstitial K<sup>+</sup> would be expected to be rapidly removed by diffusion and through the capillary network of blood vessels.

In vitro, the rapid rise in intracellular K<sup>+</sup> in <i>Ryr1</i><sup><i>AG/+</i></sup> muscle bathed in 3 mM K<sup>+</sup> and treated with glibenclamide, an inhibitor of K<sub>ATP</sub> channels, is in part due to the transport of K<sup>+</sup> into the myoplasm through K<sub>IR</sub>2.1 and Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>-ATPases. These mechanisms that transport K<sup>+</sup> into the myoplasm in <i>Ryr1</i><sup><i>AG/+</i></sup> muscles may not be sufficient in vivo to compensate for the K<sup>+</sup> leakage or the increased activation of K<sub>ATP</sub> channels located on the plasma membrane.

Recent guidelines from the World Health Organization suggest that the world population is consuming inadequate levels of dietary potassium, which can lead to heart disease, stroke, respiratory distress, and increased fatigue (<a href=\"#bib31\">Hartl, 2013</a>). Our studies suggest that <i>Ryr1</i><sup><i>AG/+</i></sup> muscle is in a myopathic state due to decreased intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels, decreased K<sup>+</sup> levels, decreased ATP levels and increased activation of K<sub>ATP</sub>6.2 channels, which may mimic a fatigue-like state. Currently, myopathies with mutations in RyR1 are not considered metabolic myopathies, even though RyR1-S2844D mice with an intracellular calcium leak and muscle weakness exhibit decreased levels of mitochondrial activity and metabolic enzymes (<a href=\"#bib1\">Andersson et al., 2011</a>). Considering that our data suggest mitochondrial dysregulation of metabolic pathways and potassium signaling in <i>Ryr1</i><sup><i>AG/+</i></sup> muscle and muscles from patients with CCD, we were intrigued by the findings that some fatigue-inducing metabolic myopathies can be rescued through dietary potassium supplementation (<a href=\"#bib70\">Villabona et al., 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Caradonna et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Ismail et al., 2001</a>). In the future, it will be of interest to determine whether the positive response to increased potassium levels is applicable to myopathies due to other RyR1 mutations and to other genetic causes. Our data also suggest that muscles of human CCD patients are sensitive to pathways that mediate potassium homeostasis. <i>ATPA1</i> (Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase \u03b11) showed increased expression only in CCD patients with mutations in <i>RYR1</i>, suggesting a selective sensitivity to this ATP-sensitive transporter. With our suggestion that K<sub>ATP</sub>6.2 channel inhibition may help protect skeletal muscles from the formation of cores, one might predict that the human patient data would show consistently higher levels of KCNJ11 (K<sub>ATP</sub>6.2) transcripts in the muscle biopsies. This is the case in CCD patients, although the level is variable. This variability could be due to the location of the muscle biopsy, as K<sub>ATP</sub>6.2 channels in mice are more highly expressed in glycolytic muscle than oxidative skeletal muscle fibers (<a href=\"#bib4\">Banas et al., 2011</a>). These biomarkers may therefore provide a less invasive approach to identify patients with CCD myopathies and may eventually identify patients who are suitable candidates for treatment of CCD through modulation of potassium signaling pathways."

The <i>Ryr1</i><sup><i>m1Nisw</i></sup> allele showed muscle weakness when heterozygous (described here) and a non-motile embryonic phenotype when homozygous (unpublished results). The gene mutation was mapped using data from homozygous mutants, starting with a panel of 96 MIT and SKI SSLP markers, which mapped the Line1\u20134 mutation to the proximal third of chromosome 7. The genetic region containing the mutation was narrowed to 3 Mb by the use of additional MIT SSLP markers on chromosome 7 and further meiotic mapping which followed linkage between the phenotype and C57BL/6J markers. As Ryr1 was a strong candidate gene in the critical interval, a complementation cross was performed between <i>Ryr1</i><sup><i>AG</i></sup> (<i>Ryr1</i><sup><i>m1Nisw</i></sup>) and <i>Ryr1</i> <sup><i>tm1TAlle</i></sup> (<i>dyspedic</i> null allele generated by Richard Allen, [<a href=\"#bib10\">Buck et al., 1997</a>]). These alleles did not complement as E18.5 trans-heterozygotes showed a similar non-motile phenotype as homozygotes of either allele. To identify the mutation in Line1-4, genomic DNA in overlapping segments of the <i>Ryr1</i> gene was amplified by PCR from phenotypic E18.5 embryos and compared with control E18.5 C57Bl/6J DNA. Subsequently, embryos were genotyped as follows: tissue was placed in tail lysis buffer (100 mM Tris\u2013Cl, pH 8.0, 5 mM EDTA, 0.2% SDS, 200 mM NaCl) overnight. DNA was amplified using Taqman Gold (Applied Biosystems) with primer set to <i>RyR1</i> mutation (forward primer: GTGGAGTGTGGTGCTGTATATC forward and CCGTCACTGTCACCTTCTTG reverse primers).

Muscles were analyzed at 33\u00b0C using the 340/380 filters in a Zeiss Axio Observer Z1 with a Photometrics CoolSNAP HQ2 camera for wide-field imaging, then performing ratio intensity analysis. To calibrate intracellular potassium concentrations, PBFI ratio intensities were fitted to PBFI intensities due to the variable K<sup>+</sup> solutions with the addition of 10 \u03bcM gramicidin in extracellular solutions and using the intensity of \u223c10 fibers of interest per muscle in &gt;3 muscles from each condition. Calibration solutions were prepared with appropriate volumes of a high [K+] solution with potassium gluconate."

But even assuming so, I find it even harder to understand how an increased K<sub>ATP</sub> channel activity produces a chronic membrane depolarization whereas the opposite would be expected. Increased K<sup>+</sup> conductance should favor a resting voltage where net K<sup>+</sup> flux across the membrane is limited, so why K<sub>ATP</sub> channel opening in this model produces a decreased intracellular K<sup>+</sup> concentration and a membrane depolarization is very hard to understand. Similarly, how can increasing extracellular K<sup>+</sup> lead to hyperpolarization is also counter\u2013intuitive. The authors propose that diseased muscle cells are in the depolarized paradoxal P2 state, but it is completely unclear how this can be due to the increased K<sub>ATP</sub> channel activity as one would rather expect a P2 state to result from an increased inward cationic conductance. This whole interpretation is very confusing and not convincing."

Additionally, we examined the soleus muscle as it is commonly used for in vitro studies of fatigue and Ryr1-associated myopathy in mouse models.\u201d We also chose the soleus because it is an easily accessible muscle that is impacted in myopathies. In addition, the soleus is a flattened muscle, which is advantageous for the inside-out path clamp experiments and for confocal microscopy visualization for the PBFI and Fura-2 AM studies. Moreover, the soleus was the predominant muscle examined in the <i>RyR1</i><sup><i>I4895T</i></sup> and <i>RyR1</i><sup><i>Y522S/WT</i></sup> mouse mutants for ultrastructural studies (<a href=\"#bib8\">Boncompagni et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Zvaritch et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Boncompagni et al., 2010</a>). We chose to examine multiple muscles because myopathies are diseases of limb muscle weakness, not weakness of a particular muscle. Moreover, we examined multiple muscle types for gene expression by RT-PCR because the muscle chosen for patient muscle biopsies can be variable and the site of biopsy is unknown to us under the terms of our IRB protocol. Using multiple assays and different muscles with different fiber type compositions, our data are consistent and show muscle weakness, pathological changes, and gene expression changes.

Thus, any additional decrease in ATP may alter other ATP dependent mechanisms. Second, 90% of ATP is used for muscle contractions by the myosin ATPase, Ca<sup>2+</sup> ATPase and Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ATPase (<a href=\"#bib34\">Homsher, 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Clausen et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Smith et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Barclay et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Clausen, 2013b</a>). With such limited amounts for other muscle processes (K<sub>ATP</sub> channels in particular), a 30% loss might be expected to have a significant effect on fiber force. Third, we also show that other regulators of K<sub>ATP</sub> channel activity (AMPK, SUR1) are upregulated in the <i>Ryr1</i><sup><i>AG/+</i></sup> muscle, which would be expected to increase K<sub>ATP</sub> channel activity. Fourth, we have functional data using pharmacological methods that shows an increase in intracellular K<sup>+</sup> upon K<sub>ATP</sub> channel inhibition. These data along with our new data showing a potassium leak (new <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>) and disrupted Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis through ratiometric imaging of myoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> in <i>Ryr1</i><sup><i>AG/+</i></sup> muscle (new <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>) provide strong mechanistic insights. We have now included comments related to all of these points within the Discussion, as well as new data and figures to substantiate these points."

Inhibition of K<sub>ATP</sub> channel activity raises intracellular potassium levels in wildtype muscle, suggesting that K<sub>ATP</sub> channels either efflux K<sup>+</sup> or increase the permeability of K<sup>+</sup> ions across the membrane of the muscle as a function of potassium homeostasis. In heterozygous mutant muscle we show increased expression and activity of K<sub>ATP</sub> channels (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>) and in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> we show a decrease in intracellular K<sup>+</sup> over time, which can be reversed by inhibition of K<sub>ATP</sub> channels. Upon performing additional sharp electrode recordings using a standard method, we found that the fresh soleus muscle underwent contractions during dissection, mounting and the introduction of the sharp electrode. We believe that the contractions, in combination with the potassium leak, slowed down the re-establishment of the proper membrane potential in <i>Ryr1</i><sup><i>AG/+</i></sup> muscle. When a mutant muscle was dissected, mounted and cultured for 1 hour at room temperature in 3 mM K ringers solution prior to sharp electrode recording, the muscle only showed a 5 mV polarized shift. While this data is potentially interesting, the interpretation of the data is difficult to explain using the techniques at our disposal, and thus we have removed the membrane potential sharp electrode recordings from the paper."
