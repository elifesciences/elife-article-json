During its development, the lateral line contains many progenitors that are primed to form more of these sense organs. The lateral line is also connected to nerve cells that relay information about water movements to the central nervous system, while other cells called Schwann cells support the nerve cells. The local environment or \u2018niche\u2019 created by the Schwann cells is known to prevent the progenitor cells within the lateral line from becoming their specific cell type too early. However, the molecules that cause progenitor cells to stop dividing, and later restart dividing and change in to their predestined cell type is not well understood."

The development of the zebrafish lateral line is an excellent model system to study progenitor cell regulation, as it consists of relatively few cells that are easily accessible and amenable to experimental manipulations."

The first set of neuromasts is laid down by a migrating primordium (primI) that develops from a placode just posterior to the otic vesicle. As the primordium migrates posteriorly along the trunk of the embryo it deposits five to six primary neuromasts and a chain of interneuromast cells that connects each neuromast (<a href=\"#bib19\">Ghysen and Dambly-Chaudiere, 2007</a>). Before the placode becomes migratory, its anterior portion splits off and forms the posterior lateral line ganglion (<a href=\"#bib53\">Northcutt and Brandle, 1995</a>). Lateral line axons closely follow the migrating primordium and eventually innervate deposited neuromasts (<a href=\"#bib20\">Gilmour et al., 2004</a>). In turn, neural crest-derived Schwann cells migrate along the axons which they eventually myelinate (<a href=\"#bib21\">Gilmour et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Lyons et al., 2005</a>). Thus, interneuromast cells, axons and Schwann cells are in close contact during the early stages of lateral line development (see diagram in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Whitfield, 2005</a>)."

We therefore wanted to test if the extra neuromast phenotype is due solely to loss of Schwann cells along the lateral line, or if ErbB signaling plays an additional role in inhibiting proliferation of interneuromast cells. Therefore, ErbB signaling was inhibited with the ErbB tyrosine kinase inhibitor AG1478 (<a href=\"#bib55\">Osherov and Levitzki, 1994</a>), before (24 hpf) and after (48 hpf) completion of Schwann cell migration, and neuromast number was assessed at 5 days post fertilization (dpf). As expected, inhibition of ErbB signaling at 24 hpf, when Schwann cells migrate, leads to a loss of Schwann cells and the formation of extra neuromasts (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1F</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Rojas-Munoz et al., 2009</a>). Interestingly, ErbB inhibition is able to increase neuromast numbers even in the presence of Schwann cells, if supplied between 50\u201359 hpf (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D\u2013E</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1F</a>). The presence of Schwann cells is based on detection of <i>myelin basic protein</i> (<i>mbp)</i> expression (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D\u2013E</a>, arrows).

To test when Schwann cell numbers are reduced upon ErbB inhibition at 48 hpf we used the <i>Tg(foxd3:gfp)</i> zebrafish line that expresses EGFP in neural crest derived tissues including Schwann cells (<a href=\"#bib21\">Gilmour et al., 2002</a>). Using BrdU labeling in control and AG1478 treated <i>Tg(foxd3:gfp)</i> fish, we counted BrdU positive <i>Tg(foxd3:gfp)</i> Schwann cells at 6, 14 or 24 hr post treatment. ErbB inhibition induces a decrease in BrdU incorporation in Schwann cells at 6 hr post treatment, however the total Schwann cell number remains unchanged (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4A\u2013B</a>). A reduction in Schwann cell proliferation continues at 14 and 24 hr post treatment, at which point it is accompanied by a decrease in total Schwann cell numbers (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4C\u2013F</a>). The finding that Schwann cell numbers are not affected at 6 hr post treatment is important, as the first molecular changes in interneuromast cells are already observed at this stage (see below, 'Wnt\u03b2-catenin signaling activation occurs prior to Notch and Fgf activation within interneuromast cells after ErbB inhibition'). This suggests that ErbB signaling affects lateral line proliferation directly, rather than indirectly via the regulation of Schwann cell number. Thus, ErbB signaling has independent functions in Schwann cell migration and lateral line progenitor proliferation and differentiation. To elucidate if ErbB signaling controls progenitor proliferation cell-autonomously or non-cell-autonomously, we performed transplantation experiments between mutant and wild type embryos."

To identify the earliest changes in lateral line cell behavior in response to the loss of ErbB signaling we performed time-lapse analyses. We imaged interneuromast cells in Schwann cell-depleted larvae derived from crosses between <i>Tg(sox10:DNerbb4)</i> and <i>Tg(SqET20:gfp). Tg(SqET20:gfp)</i> larvae express EGFP in neuromast mantle cells and interneuromast cells (<a href=\"#bib56\">Parinov et al., 2004</a>). In a 40-hr time-lapse four intercalary neuromasts are formed from interneuromasts cells (<a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). The time-lapse analyses revealed that interneuromast cell proliferation precedes clustering of interneuromast cells. In addition, interneuromast cells are highly motile and migrate into and out of the forming neuromasts. The clusters of interneuromast cells continue to proliferate and differentiate into neuromasts as evident by the mature pattern of a ring of <i>Tg(SqET20:gfp)</i> positive mantle cells that surrounds GFP-negative sensory hair cells. In contrast, control <i>Tg(SqET20:gfp)</i> larvae show no proliferation and little migration of interneuromast cells during the same time period (<a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). In conclusion, the absence of Schwann cells, leads first to interneuromast cell proliferation, followed by an increase in migration and clustering of interneuromast cells that eventually differentiate into sensory hair and support cells."

                                "text": "The Wnt/\u03b2-catenin, Fgf and Notch signaling pathways are excellent candidates for being involved in intercalary neuromast formation as they regulate progenitor cell proliferation in several other organs, such as the CNS (<a href=\"#bib39\">Logan and Nusse, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Guillemot and Zimmer, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Koch et al., 2013</a>). In addition, these three pathways play multiple, crucial roles in the primordium of the lateral line (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib4\">Aman and Piotrowski, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Ma and Raible, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Chitnis et al., 2012</a>). Briefly, Wnt/\u03b2-catenin and Fgf signaling regulate cell proliferation, while Fgf is also required for neuromast rosette formation and hair cell differentiation (<a href=\"#bib3\">Aman and Piotrowski, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Lecaudey et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Nechiporuk and Raible, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Aman et al., 2011</a>). Notch signaling regulates sensory hair cell production and primordium cohesion (<a href=\"#bib29\">Itoh and Chitnis, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Matsuda and Chitnis, 2010</a>). To test if the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin, Fgf and Notch pathways are also involved in the extra neuromast phenotype we performed an in situ expression screen on 48 hpf <i>nrg1-3</i><sup><i>z26</i></sup> mutant larvae (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). The Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway members <i>wnt10a</i>, <i>lef1</i>, <i>myca,</i> and <i>\u03b2-catenin-2</i> (<i>ctnnb2)</i> are upregulated in interneuromast cells in <i>nrg1-3</i><sup><i>z26</i></sup> larvae (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013H</a>). <i>lef1</i> and <i>ctnnb2</i> are also expressed at lower levels in interneuromast cells in control animals while <i>wnt10a</i> and <i>myca</i> show no expression. The expression of <i>wnt10a</i> correlates with the differentiation status of intercalary neuromasts. <i>wnt10a</i> is expressed in proliferating interneuromast cells but is down regulated in differentiating neuromasts (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013D</a>). The Notch receptor <i>notch3</i> and the Notch target gene <i>her4.1</i> are expressed in primary neuromasts in control animals but not in interneuromast cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4I,K</a>, arrows). <i>notch3</i> is broadly induced in <i>nrg1-3</i><sup><i>z26</i></sup> interneuromast cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4J</a>). <i>her4.1</i> is also induced in <i>nrg1-3</i><sup><i>z26</i></sup> but in a more discrete cluster of cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4L</a>, arrowhead). <i>her4.1</i> is not expressed in proliferating interneuromast cells but is induced as intercalary neuromasts mature (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1E\u2013H</a>). This suggests that Notch signaling is only active in differentiating neuromasts. Fgf signaling pathway components are also upregulated in interneuromast cells in <i>nrg1-3</i><sup><i>z26</i></sup> mutant larvae (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4N,P,R,T</a>). In control embryos, <i>fgfr1a</i>, <i>fgf3</i>, <i>fgf10</i> and the Fgf target <i>pea3</i> only show strong expression in primary neuromasts but not interneuromast cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4M,O,Q,S</a>, arrows), suggesting that, similar to Notch signaling, Fgf signaling might be involved in neuromast differentiation."

To test if Fgf signaling is also required for intercalary neuromast formation we used both genetic and pharmacological methods to block Fgfr signaling. We added the Fgfr inhibitors SU5402 or PD173074 to 32 hpf <i>Tg(SqET20:gfp)</i> or <i>Tg(SqET20:gfp)/Tg(sox10:DNerbb4)</i> larvae and observed neuromasts at 3 dpf. DMSO treated <i>Tg(sox10:DNerbb4)</i> larvae show formation of intercalary neuromasts (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10B</a>, arrowheads). In contrast, intercalary neuromast formation is blocked after Fgfr inhibition in <i>Tg(sox10:DNerbb4)</i> (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10D,F</a>). In Fgfr inhibitor treated <i>Tg(sox10:DNerbb4)</i> larvae a thickening of the chain of interneuromast cells occurs that is not observed in Fgfr inhibited siblings (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10C\u2013F</a>, arrows). However, this increase in interneuromast cells does not lead to the formation of rosettes or differentiated neuromasts. Quantification of neuromast numbers revealed a significant reduction in Fgfr inhibitor treated <i>Tg(sox10:DNerbb4)</i> larvae (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10G</a>, red bars). Fgfr is required for maintenance of rosettes in the primordium (<a href=\"#bib52\">Nechiporuk and Raible, 2008</a>). SU5402 and to a lesser extent PD173074, also induced loss of the rosette shape of primary neuromasts, decreasing the number of neuromasts in treated control siblings (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10G</a>, blue bars). As another means to inhibit Fgf signaling, we heat shock induced dominant negative Fgfr1 expression in 32 hpf <i>Tg(sox10:DNerbb4)</i> and sibling larvae. Dominant negative Fgfr1 also inhibited extra neuromast formation in <i>Tg(sox10:DNerbb4)</i> larvae by 3 dpf (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10H</a>). The observation that Fgfr inhibited <i>Tg(sox10:DNerbb4)</i> larvae still form large clusters of interneuromast cells that fail to differentiate into neuromasts, shows that Fgf signaling is crucial for interneuromast differentiation and rosette formation, but not proliferation."

As interneuromast cells are deposited by the primordium, they are in close contact with Schwann cells. Schwann cells keep interneuromast cells in a quiescent state via the action of an unknown inhibitor (<a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12A</a>). After deposition, interneuromast cells migrate ventrally away from the midline, which coincides with the commencement of proliferation in interneuromast cells (<a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12B</a>). Simultaneously, Schwann cells migrate medially, crossing the basement membrane (<a href=\"#bib60\">Raphael et al., 2010</a>). Both of these steps likely contribute to the release of the Schwann cell inhibitory signal during normal development. The release of this inhibitory signal causes the upregulation of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling leading to interneuromast proliferation (<a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12C</a>).

As pharmacological inhibition of ErbB signaling also causes a reduction in Schwann cell proliferation, it is possible that this secondarily affects interneuromast proliferation via reduction of the number of Schwann cells. However, pharmacological inhibition of ErbB signaling induces an increase in Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling before we observe a decrease in Schwann cell number (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>), suggesting that ErbB signaling directly regulates the expression or activity of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin inhibitor.

However, primary neuromasts form within the migrating primordium and are deposited, whereas interneuromast cells proliferate to form a cluster of progenitor cells that eventually differentiate (<a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). Therefore some differences exist. Both Fgf and Wnt/\u03b2-catenin are required for proliferation in the primordium (<a href=\"#bib2\">Aman et al., 2011</a>), whereas interneuromast proliferation depends on Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling only. Nevertheless, both neuromast types require Fgf signaling for rosette formation and hair cell specification (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10A\u2013F; 11E\u2013H</a> and <a href=\"#bib36\">Lecaudey et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Nechiporuk and Raible, 2008</a>). Fgf signaling is induced by Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling in the primordium, and likely also in interneuromast cells (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2 and 3</a>). However, it is not upregulated for many hours after the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway is activated post ErbB inhibition (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figures 5 and 6</a>) or after BIO treatment (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Also, activation of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway by GSK-3 inhibition does not induce <i>pea3</i> in interneuromast cells during the first 24 hr post treatment (data not shown). Therefore, in contrast to the primordium, Fgf may not be a direct target of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling in interneuromast cells. Neuromast formation in the primordium occurs in an existing and migrating tissue whereas intercalary neuromasts form from a string of cells. Therefore, it is not surprising that some of the signaling interactions between these two modes of neuromast formations are different."

Although cancers typically originate from unique cell types, tumors can be heterogeneous, containing multiple cell types. As the repertoire of pharmacological kinase inhibitors that are being developed to treat cancer increases, it becomes crucial to take into consideration that different ErbB receptor/ligand combinations can result in counterproductive cellular responses.

It is possible that other signaling pathways are induced at this later stage and are responsible for inducing a Wnt/\u03b2-catenin inhibitor in interneuromast cells. One Wnt/\u03b2-catenin inhibitor, <i>dkk1b,</i> is an Fgf target in the primordium (Aman and Piotrowski, 2008). However, Fgf signaling, as judged by <i>pea3</i> expression, is not induced until after 24 hours of AG1478 treatment. We also performed an expression analysis with <i>dkk1b</i> and <i>dkk2</i> after AG1478 addition and neither gene was induced by 36 hours post treatment (data not shown), illustrating that <i>dkk1b</i> and <i>dkk2</i> are likely not the responsible Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling inhibitors at the AG1478 24 hour time point. This suggest that if Fgf is also regulating <i>dkk</i> expression during intercalary neuromast formation, as it is in the primordium, it is acting at a time point later than 24 hours post AG1478 treatment. Therefore, Fgf signaling is not a likely candidate to cause the decrease in Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6X</a>)."

For two of these experiments the results are now no longer significant, as the p-value is greater than 0.05. One of these experiments is the test of neuromast formation after AG1478 is added at different developmental time points (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure1\u2013figure supplement 1F</a>). The 72 hour time point is no longer significantly different from the DMSO treated group. We have updated the text and figure to reflect this change. This does not change the main conclusion of this experiment which is AG1478 induces an increase in neuromast number, even if given after Schwann cell migration is completed at 50 or 59 hpf."

As mentioned in the text, the fact that PD173074 causes an increase in posterior lateral line ganglion cell number matches the results the Riley laboratory acquired using a heat-shock dominant negative FGFR transgenic in the zebrafish statoacoustic ganglion (<a href=\"#bib70\">Vemaraju et al., 2012</a>). As dominant negative Fgfr is likely a more specific inhibitor than pharmacological inhibitors we suspect that PD173074 is more specific in blocking Fgf signaling within the posterior lateral line ganglion than SU5402 that is possibly affecting other receptor tyrosine kinases. We would like to emphasize that this difference in drug effect was only seen in the posterior lateral line ganglion. SU5402 and PD173074 induced the same phenotypes during primordium migration (data not shown) as well as intercalary neuromast formation described in this paper."
