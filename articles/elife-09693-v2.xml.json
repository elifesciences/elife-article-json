Here, we report on three AMPAR interacting proteins\u2014namely CKAMP39, CKAMP52 and CKAMP59\u2014that, together with the previously characterized CKAMP44, constitute a novel family of auxiliary subunits distinct from other families of AMPAR interacting proteins. The new members of the CKAMP family display distinct regional and developmental expression profiles in the mouse brain. Notably, despite their structural similarities they exert diverse modulation on AMPAR gating by influencing deactivation, desensitization and recovery from desensitization, as well as glutamate and cyclothiazide potency to AMPARs. This study indicates that AMPAR function is very precisely controlled by the cell-type specific expression of the CKAMP family members."

Here, we report on three AMPAR interacting proteins\u2014namely CKAMP39, CKAMP52 and CKAMP59\u2014that, together with the previously characterized CKAMP44, constitute a novel family of auxiliary subunits distinct from other families of AMPAR interacting proteins. The new members of the CKAMP family display distinct regional and developmental expression profiles in the mouse brain. Notably, despite their structural similarities they exert diverse modulation on AMPAR gating by influencing deactivation, desensitization and recovery from desensitization, as well as glutamate and cyclothiazide potency to AMPARs. This study indicates that AMPAR function is very precisely controlled by the cell-type specific expression of the CKAMP family members."

In 2010, researchers identified a new auxiliary protein called CKAMP44 that modifies AMPA receptor activity. Now, Farrow, Khodosevich, Sapir, Schulmann et al. \u2013 including some of the researchers involved in the 2010 study \u2013 have identified three other auxiliary proteins that are similar to CKAMP44. Collectively, these four proteins are termed the CKAMP family."

AMPAR function is controlled by a multitude of auxiliary subunits (<a href=\"#bib26\">Yan and Tomita, 2011</a>). These include TARPs (<a href=\"#bib19\">Tomita et al., 2003</a>), cornichons (<a href=\"#bib17\">Schwenk et al., 2009</a>), Sol-1 (<a href=\"#bib28\">Zheng et al., 2004</a>) and SynDIG1 (<a href=\"#bib5\">Kalashnikova et al., 2010</a>). Recently, we identified a novel AMPAR auxiliary subunit, CKAMP44, and characterized its modulation of AMPAR gating properties in CA1 and dentate gyrus neurons (<a href=\"#bib7\">Khodosevich et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">von Engelhardt et al., 2010</a>). Unlike other auxiliary subunits, CKAMP44 contains an N-terminal cystine-knot domain that in other proteins, e.g. growth factors (<a href=\"#bib11\">McDonald and Hendrickson, 1993</a>), was shown to stabilize the globular structure of the protein. The different auxiliary subunits exhibit distinct modulatory profiles. Since auxiliary subunits are differentially expressed in the brain, the specific combination in a particular cell type is likely to govern the AMPAR response to glutamate, as is the case for dentate gyrus granule cells, which express TARP \u03b3-8 and CKAMP44. Both proteins increase the number of AMPARs on the cell surface, decrease the deactivation rate and increase glutamate affinity. However, they differ in the influence that they extend on AMPAR desensitization, recovery from desensitization, long-term and short-term potentiation (<a href=\"#bib7\">Khodosevich et al., 2014</a>)."

                                "text": "Like CKAMP44, all CKAMP proteins comprise a signal peptide, N-terminal cystine-knot extracellular domain, transmembrane domain and a large intracellular C-terminal domain, which terminates in a PDZ type II motif (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>). The predicted signal peptides vary in length, being 36, 30 and 22 amino acids for CKAMP39, CKAMP52 and CKAMP59, respectively (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Strikingly, cystine-knot domains exhibit a high degree of similarity and all eight cysteines are conserved among the family members (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Although cystine-knot containing proteins differ much in their function (<a href=\"#bib3\">Heinemann and Leipold, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">McDonald and Hendrickson, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Zhang et al., 2011</a>), the purpose of cysteine-knots is similar, i.e. to form a tightly packed globular domain made of \u03b2-strands with several variable loops for stable protein-protein interaction. Thus, although sequences of the extracellular domains of CKAMP proteins have little homology beyond the cystine-knot core, it is likely that the extracellular region of all four proteins exhibit a similar \u03b2-strand structure. Each of the proteins possesses a predicted single short transmembrane domain (18\u201319 amino acids), and novel CKAMP family members have ~80% homology with the transmembrane domain of CKAMP44 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Notably, a ~20 amino acid stretch immediately downstream of the transmembrane domain contains a conserved arginine-rich motif (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). This is of particular interest, since this region of CKAMP44 was shown to be necessary for interaction with GluA1, and CKAMP44 mutants with a deletion of only 6 amino acids in this region did not bind to GluA1 when overexpressed in HEK293/T17 cells (<a href=\"#bib7\">Khodosevich et al., 2014</a>). Finally, another conserved region in the protein sequence amongst CKAMP family members is the PDZ type II motif located at the very end of the C-terminal domain (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Thus, all CKAMP proteins end with the same EVTV stretch. Furthermore, another 5 amino acids upstream of the PDZ motif are also almost identical in CKAMP proteins. The PDZ motif is of functional importance as it mediates the interaction of CKAMP44 with PSD95, which allows anchoring of AMPARs within synapses of dentate gyrus granule cells (<a href=\"#bib7\">Khodosevich et al., 2014</a>)."

Currently, based on their similarity to <i>Shisa</i> genes, the <i>Ckamp</i> genes are termed in the genome database as <i>Shisa6</i> (CKAMP52), <i>Shisa7</i> (CKAMP59), <i>Shisa8</i> (CKAMP39) and <i>Shisa9</i> (CKAMP44). Shisa 1\u20133 proteins were studied in embryonic development of <i>Xenopus laevis</i>, where they were found to inhibit Wnt and FGF signaling by retention of their receptors in ER (<a href=\"#bib12\">Nagano et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Yamamoto et al., 2005</a>). However, CKAMP family members differ significantly from Shisa2-5 proteins (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, Shisa1 protein does not have a mouse homolog) and form a separate cluster on the phylogenetic tree (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, see also <a href=\"#bib13\">Pei and Grishin, 2012</a>). There are ~70 amino acids that are largely conserved in the CKAMP cluster, but not in the Shisa cluster (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Furthermore, Shisa proteins are much shorter than CKAMPs, being 197-295 and 399-541 amino acids, respectively. Interestingly, the GluA1-interacting region of CKAMP44 exhibits a high degree of similarity to other CKAMPs, but not to that of Shisa proteins (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Finally, Shisa proteins do not contain a PDZ binding motif at their C-terminus. Based on these considerations, we propose that CKAMP members constitute a protein family distinct from the Shisa protein family (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>)."

While CKAMP39 had only one splice variant, both CKAMP52 and CKAMP59 had two splice isoforms (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) that differed in protein coding sequences. In the subsequent experiments, we utilized the most abundant versions of CKAMPs, i.e. CKAMP52 and CKAMP59 lacking exon 3 and exon 4, respectively (note that alignments in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a> are performed for exon 3- and exon 4-lacking versions).

In situ hybridization of adult mouse brain sections with oligo probes against CKAMP39, CKAMP52 and CKAMP59 mRNAs revealed that each of the novel CKAMP family proteins exhibited a region-specific expression pattern within the brain (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>).

CKAMP39 is absent and CKAMP52 is barely detectable in the brain of embryonic day 17 (E17) mice. In contrast, there is a strong signal for CKAMP59 already prenatally.

To investigate how gating properties are modulated by the novel CKAMPs, we performed fast perfusion patch-clamp recordings on outside-out macropatches pulled from oocytes expressing either GluA1 or GluA2(Q) alone, or with CKAMP39 or CKAMP52. An analysis of the effect of CKAMP59 on AMPAR gating in oocytes was not possible, as this auxiliary subunit was not sufficiently expressed in this heterologous expression system as revealed by the absence of detectable protein in Western-blot analysis (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Consistently, no significant change in AMPAR gating was observed for the co-expression of GluA1 or GluA2(Q) with CKAMP59.

Hence, to investigate the influence of CKAMP59 on AMPAR-mediated currents, we expressed this auxiliary subunit along with GluA1 or GluA2(Q) in HEK293/T17 cells. To be able to compare the influence of CKAMP59 with that of the other auxiliary subunits, we also investigated AMPAR-mediated currents in HEK293/T17 cells that co-expressed CKAMP39 or CKAMP52. In contrast to the other auxiliary subunits, CKAMP59 did not modulate GluA1- or GluA2(Q)-mediated current kinetics. However, there was a significant reduction in GluA2(Q)-mediated current amplitude. Co-expression of CKAMP39 and CKAMP52 also reduced AMPAR-mediated current amplitude (GluA1-current amplitude was reduced only by CKAMP39) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a> and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1C\u2014table 3</a>). A cell surface biotinylation assay performed in HEK293/T17 cells co-transfected with AMPARs and CKAMPs showed that all CKAMP family members, except for CKAMP52, lead to a reduction in surface expression of GluA1 and GluA2 protein. These results can be accounted for by a reduction of total expression of GluA1 and GluA2, and by reduced GluA2 forward trafficking or stabilization of GluA2 on the cell surface as indicated by the reduced ratio of surface to total protein. Interestingly, CKAMP52 increased the ratio of surface to total GluA1 expression, suggesting that this auxiliary protein exerts an opposite influence on forward trafficking or stabilization of GluA1 and GluA2 (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1D\u2014table 4</a>)."

Thus, we performed an analysis using fast-application of glutamate onto whole HEK293/T17 cells instead. The expected solution exchange time is considerably slower when using whole cells instead of outside-out patches (<a href=\"#bib1\">Barberis et al., 2008</a>). Nevertheless, the analysis allowed us to draw conclusions about the influence of CKAMP family members on AMPAR kinetic properties. Thus, CKAMP39 and CKAMP52 modulated AMPAR gating in HEK293/T17 cells similarly to what we observed in oocytes with an increase in GluA2(Q) \u03c4<sub>deact</sub> by CKAMP52 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a> and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1C\u2014table\u00a03</a>), a decrease in GluA2(Q) \u03c4<sub>des</sub> by CKAMP39, an increase in GluA1 steady-state current amplitude by CKAMP52, and a reduction of the GluA2(Q) steady-state current amplitude by CKAMP39 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a> and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1C\u2014table 3</a>). Recovery from desensitization was analyzed in HEK293/T17 cells with a protocol that differed from that used in oocyte experiments, where we applied two 100 ms glutamate pulses with different interpulse intervals. In HEK293/T17 cell experiments, we applied two 1ms glutamate pulses. The rational was to probe whether CKAMP39 influences AMPAR recovery from desensitization also when glutamate is applied only for very short time periods, thus mimicking the short presence of glutamate in the synaptic cleft. Indeed, CKAMP39 slowed the recovery from desensitization of GluA1- and GluA2(Q)-mediated currents also when tested with this modified protocol (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a> and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1C\u2014table 3</a>). The effect was comparable to that of CKAMP44, which modulates synaptic short-term plasticity in dentate gyrus granule cell synapses by slowing recovery from desensitization (<a href=\"#bib7\">Khodosevich et al., 2014</a>)."

In addition, \u03c4<sub>des</sub> was reduced by co-expression with CKAMP52 in oocytes, but not in HEK293/T17 cells.

                        "text": "In recent years, several labs have employed large proteomic screens to search for AMPAR interacting proteins, which resulted in the identification of new AMPAR auxiliary (or auxiliary-like) subunits, such as CKAMP44 (<a href=\"#bib22\">von Engelhardt et al., 2010</a>), cornichons (<a href=\"#bib17\">Schwenk et al., 2009</a>) and GSG1L (<a href=\"#bib16\">Schwenk et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Shanks et al., 2012</a>). In this study, we searched a genomic and transcriptomic databases, and identified three new proteins that, together with CKAMP44, form the CKAMP family of AMPAR auxiliary-like proteins. Presumably, evolutionarily the CKAMPs and Shisa proteins descend from the same protein family. The Shisa proteins were shown to be involved in fibroblast growth factor receptor maturation and degradation during embryogenesis in <i>Xenopus laevis</i> oocytes (<a href=\"#bib12\">Nagano et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Yamamoto et al., 2005</a>). All CKAMPs exhibited a significant homology in the region of CKAMP44 that is necessary for AMPAR binding (<a href=\"#bib7\">Khodosevich et al., 2014</a>). Thus, it is likely that, similar to CKAMP44, a stretch of amino acids immediately downstream of the transmembrane regions of novel CKAMP proteins is involved in interaction with AMPARs. All CKAMPs possess an extracellular cystine-knot motif that was shown to be important for modulation of AMPAR gating, and an identical intracellular PDZ-domain binding motif (<a href=\"#bib7\">Khodosevich et al., 2014</a>). All CKAMPs bind to GluA1 and GluA2 and modify GluA1 and/or GluA2 currents in two heterologous systems, making them likely candidates for AMPAR auxiliary subunits in vivo. Importantly, despite their structural similarities, the members of the CKAMP family differ enormously in their modulation of AMPAR-mediated currents. Only the function of CKAMP39 resembles that of CKAMP44 (<a href=\"#bib7\">Khodosevich et al., 2014</a>), and indeed this subunit also displays the highest homology with CKAMP44. CKAMP39 had a pronounced effect on the recovery from desensitization, similar to CKAMP44, suggesting that it might also modulate synaptic short-term plasticity as was observed for CKAMP44 in dentate gyrus granule cells (<a href=\"#bib7\">Khodosevich et al., 2014</a>). The reduction of surface AMPAR number by all three CKAMPs in HEK293/T17 cells was unexpected, since CKAMP44 has the opposite effect on AMPARs of granule cells, possibly by promoting trafficking of AMPARs to the cell surface. The reduction in surface AMPAR number by the novel CKAMP family members was mainly due to a reduction in total AMPAR number in the cell. However, changes in the ratio of surface/total AMPAR number indicate that the novel CKAMP family members also influence the forward trafficking or stability of AMPARs on the cell surface."

However, one explanation could be the different recording conditions used for HEK293/T17 cells and oocytes. Thus, there were differences in room temperature (17<sup>o</sup>C versus 22<sup>o</sup>C), patch size (macropatches of oocytes versus lifted whole HEK293/T17 cells) and the holding potential (-70 versus -120 mV)."

It is not clear why CKAMP39 and CKAMP59 were not identified as AMPAR interacting proteins, but it is possible that their expression level is too low or that their interaction is too loose for identification in the proteomic screens. The highly diverse expression pattern of CKAMP family members together with their unique biophysical profile make them strong candidates for region-specific AMPAR modulation. Future studies should unravel how different CKAMPs influence synaptic function by modulating expression and gating kinetics of AMPARs. Yet another effect of CKAMP family members might be an influence on neuron morphology as described for CKAMP44 and TARP \u03b3-8, which increase spine number by augmenting surface AMPAR expression (<a href=\"#bib7\">Khodosevich et al., 2014</a>)."

Cells were recorded 24\u201372 h post-transfection. Fast application of glutamate onto lifted HEK293/T17 cells was performed as described (<a href=\"#bib4\">Jonas and Sakmann, 1992</a>) using theta glass tubing mounted onto a piezo translator. AMPAR-mediated currents were evoked by a 1 ms glutamate pulse for analyzing amplitude and deactivation, by a 100 ms glutamate pulse for analyzing desensitization and steady-state current amplitude, and by two 1ms pulses with 10, 30, 100, 300, 1000 and 3000 inter-event interval for analyzing recovery from desensitization. Application pipettes were tested by perfusing solutions with different salt concentrations through the two barrels onto open patch pipettes and recording current changes with 1 and 100 ms transitions of the application pipette. Only application pipettes with 20\u201380% rise times below 100 \u00b5s and with a reasonable symmetrical on- and offset were used. However, the expected solution exchange time is considerably slower with the use of whole cells instead of outside-out patches (<a href=\"#bib1\">Barberis et al., 2008</a>). The application solution contained (in mM): 135 NaCl, 10 HEPES, 5.4 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 5 glucose (pH 7.2). Whole-HEK293/T17 cell recordings were performed at room-temperature using pipettes pulled from borosilicate glass capillaries with a resistance of 3\u2013 5 M\u03a9 when filled with the following solution (in mM): 120 Cs-gluconate, 10 CsCl, 8 NaCl, 10 HEPES, 10 phosphocreatine-Na, 0.3 GTP, 2 MgATP, 0.2 EGTA (pH 7.3, adjusted with NaOH).

                                "text": "Stage V\u2013VI <i>Xenopus laevis</i> oocytes were prepared, injected with cRNA as previously described (<a href=\"#bib15\">Priel et al., 2005</a>). Whole-cell two electrode voltage clamp (TEVC) recordings were used for estimation of current amplitude before proceeding to patch-clamp recordings and for determination of EC50 values for glutamate and CTZ. TEVC recordings were performed at 17<sup>o</sup>C, at holding potential of \u221270mV, using GeneClamp500 connected to digidata1322A and pCLAMP8.2 (Axon Instruments). Data was analyzed by pCLAMP8.2 and ORIGIN 8 (Origin Lab Corp.) for estimation of the respective EC50s. For outside-out macropatch recordings the vitelline membrane was removed using forceps. Recordings were performed at 17<sup>o</sup>C, at membrane potential of -\u2212120mV, using Axopatch 200B amplifier connected to digidata1322A and pCLAMP8.2 (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). For rapid solution exchanges, a double-barrel glass (theta tube) mounted on a piezoelectric translator (Burleigh, Fishers, NY) was used as previously described (<a href=\"#bib15\">Priel et al., 2005</a>). Patch electrodes were fabricated from borosilicateglass with a low resistance of 0.3\u20131 M\u03a9. Receptor deactivation and desensitization were measured by applying glutamate (10 mM) for 1 ms and 500 ms, respectively. Recovery from desensitization was estimated with the two-pulse protocol in which a constant 100 ms application of glutamate (10 mM) was followed by a 100 ms test pulse applied at different time intervals. Western-blot analysis was done as previously described (<a href=\"#bib15\">Priel et al., 2005</a>) on protein homogenates from 10 oocytes for each sample. Blots were probed with anti-Flag antibody (1:2000; monoclonal anti-FLAG M2, Sigma-Aldrich, Israel) and visualized using ChemiDoc XRS system (Bio-Rad Laboratories). GluA1-flip and GluA2(Q)-flip were injected at 1ng cRNA/oocyte and CKAMP39, CKAMP44 &amp; CKAMP52 were injected at 1, 3 &amp; 5 ng cRNA/oocyte, respectively. At these conditions, CKAMP39, CKAMP44 &amp; CKAMP52 exhibited comparable protein expression levels (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>) without a significant influence on total current amplitude compared to oocytes expressing the AMPAR alone (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1A</a>), thereby allowing better comparison between the CKAMPs in modulating AMPAR properties. Higher amounts of CKAMP cRNA injections caused a reduction in total current amplitude manifested by a reduction in total protein expression as revealed by Western-blot analysis with anti-GluA1 and anti-GluA2/3 antibodies, respectively (not shown)."

Also, if the authors want to measure steady-state (SS) current, then the traces should be shown reaching SS. As I understand the experiment, they compare the SS current observed with simultaneous glu and CTZ application (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A, a</a> traces) versus pre-exposure to CTZ before glutamate (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A, b</a> traces) as a control. Several things will happen if one applies glu and CTZ simultaneously apparently without CTZ pre-equilibration (a traces). The glu-bound channels will activate and quickly begin to enter the desensitized state. While CTZ binds to available dimer interfaces. Considering that CTZ binds the dimer interface, as the channels move from apo to open to desensitized states (and the dimer interface rearranges), the CTZ affinities of the various conformations of dimers will be dynamically changing during the agonist application. Amidst this complicated swirl of conformational changes, the desensitization rates of these various receptor conformations are also different (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>), which would be expected to alter the final SS current. Moreover, the CTZ potency is apparently also different (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>) so when the authors apply 100 uM CTZ to GluA1 it apparently occupies only about 45% of the receptors whereas at GluA1+39 it would occupy 10% of the receptors. These experiments are done in oocytes which have slow solution exchange so this experiment is not so much applying Glu + CTZ as it is slowly ramping up the concentration of glu + CTZ from zero to something apparently subsaturating. This makes it difficult to draw any mechanistic inference. Confusion is increased by the use of GluA3 in this part of the paper. Overall, it is not clear how much <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a> adds to the manuscript as currently presented."

Interestingly, this reduction could be explained in part by a reduction in total GluA1 and GluA2 expression and in part by a reduction of the forward trafficking or surface stability of AMPAPs, i.e. there was a reduction of total AMPAR expression and in addition a reduction in the ratio of surface/total AMPARs in cells expressing CKAMP family members. Finally, CKAMP family members seem to reduce the forward trafficking or surface stability in a subunit specific manner since the ratio of surface/total protein was reduced only for GluA2, but not for GluA1. In fact, CKAMP52 even increased the ratio of surface/total GluA1, thus appears to promote forward trafficking or surface stability of GluA1.

Several things will happen if one applies glu and CTZ simultaneously apparently without CTZ pre-equilibration (a traces). The glu-bound channels will activate and quickly begin to enter the desensitized state. While CTZ binds to available dimer interfaces. Considering that CTZ binds the dimer interface, as the channels move from apo to open to desensitized states (and the dimer interface rearranges), the CTZ affinities of the various conformations of dimers will be dynamically changing during the agonist application. Amidst this complicated swirl of conformational changes, the desensitization rates of these various receptor conformations are also different (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>), which would be expected to alter the final SS current. Moreover, the CTZ potency is apparently also different (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>) so when the authors apply 100 uM CTZ to GluA1 it apparently occupies only about 45% of the receptors whereas at GluA1+39 it would occupy 10% of the receptors. These experiments are done in oocytes which have slow solution exchange so this experiment is not so much applying Glu + CTZ as it is slowly ramping up the concentration of glu + CTZ from zero to something apparently subsaturating. This makes it difficult to draw any mechanistic inference. Confusion is increased by the use of GluA3 in this part of the paper.
