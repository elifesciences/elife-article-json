                    "text": "Certain neuron types fire spontaneously at high rates, an ability that is crucial for their function in brain circuits. The spontaneously active GABAergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr), a major output of the basal ganglia, provide tonic inhibition of downstream brain areas. A depolarizing 'leak' current supports this firing pattern, but its molecular basis remains poorly understood. To understand how SNr neurons maintain tonic activity, we used single-cell RNA sequencing to determine the transcriptome of individual mouse SNr neurons. We discovered that SNr neurons express the sodium leak channel, NALCN, and that SNr neurons lacking NALCN have impaired spontaneous firing. In addition, NALCN is involved in the modulation of excitability by changes in glycolysis and by activation of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. Our findings suggest that disruption of NALCN could impair the basal ganglia circuit, which may underlie the severe motor deficits in humans carrying mutations in NALCN."

The spontaneously active GABAergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr), a major output of the basal ganglia, provide tonic inhibition of downstream brain areas. A depolarizing 'leak' current supports this firing pattern, but its molecular basis remains poorly understood. To understand how SNr neurons maintain tonic activity, we used single-cell RNA sequencing to determine the transcriptome of individual mouse SNr neurons. We discovered that SNr neurons express the sodium leak channel, NALCN, and that SNr neurons lacking NALCN have impaired spontaneous firing. In addition, NALCN is involved in the modulation of excitability by changes in glycolysis and by activation of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. Our findings suggest that disruption of NALCN could impair the basal ganglia circuit, which may underlie the severe motor deficits in humans carrying mutations in NALCN."

SNr neurons have a leak current (a sodium-dependent tonic current) that maintains their membrane potential sufficiently depolarized to allow for spontaneous triggering of action potentials in the absence of any synaptic input (<a href=\"#bib3\">Atherton and Bevan, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Zhou and Lee, 2011</a>). It has been suggested that a member of the Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) channel family, TRPC3, is the basis for the tonic depolarizing current in SNr neurons (<a href=\"#bib64\">Zhou et al., 2008</a>). However, we previously found that the spontaneous firing of SNr neurons was unaffected by genetic deletion of TRPC3, arguing against this possibility (<a href=\"#bib41\">Lutas et al., 2014</a>).

Electrophysiological experiments using pharmacological inhibitors supported a critical function of NALCN in maintaining firing, and conditional knockout of NALCN in SNr neurons impaired firing, confirming its importance. In addition, we found that the loss of NALCN significantly impaired modulation of SNr firing by glycolytic inhibition and by muscarinic metabotropic receptor activation, indicating that NALCN was involved in the regulation of SNr neuron excitability.

We previously found that inhibition of glycolysis in SNr neurons leads to a decrease in a tonic, depolarizing current and slows SNr firing (<a href=\"#bib41\">Lutas et al., 2014</a>). We thus sought to identify the ion channel that carries this glycolysis-dependent tonic depolarizing current in SNr neurons. We initially used pharmacological tools that nonspecifically block multiple types of NSCCs. Flufenamic acid (FFA; 100 \u03bcM), a commonly used NSCC blocker, rapidly decreased SNr firing (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>). The effect of FFA on SNr firing was dose dependent, and at higher concentrations, FFA could even silence SNr firing (K<sub>d</sub> = 4.7 \u00d7 10<sup>\u20135</sup>10-5\u2009M; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Similarly, 2-aminoethoxydiphenylborane (2-APB; 100\u2009\u03bcM), which also blocks multiple NSCCs including many TRP channels (<a href=\"#bib37\">Lievremont et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Chen et al., 2012</a>), decreased SNr firing (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D,E</a>).

This method required the isolation of GABAergic neurons that reside within the SNr from other cell types, especially the neighboring dopaminergic neurons. While currently there is no selective marker for SNr neurons, we could effectively isolate SNr neurons by a combination of anatomical localization and fluorescent marking of GABAergic neurons. We made acute coronal brain slices containing the SNr from brains of GAD1-EGFP transgenic mice, in which all GABAergic neurons are fluorescently labeled (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Then, we dissected out the SNr regions from brain slices, dissociated this tissue to isolate individual cells, and manually collected GFP-positive neurons with a micromanipulator while observing the cells in a fluorescent microscope (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). We collected 87 GFP-positive SNr neurons, thus isolating GABAergic SNr neurons from neighboring dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta and also separating them from dopamine neurons located within the SNr. To improve our ability to detect ion channel genes, which have comparatively low expression levels, we employed the SMART-seq2 method for preparing samples for RNA sequencing, which allows for reads to be made across the full sequence of gene transcripts (<a href=\"#bib48\">Picelli et al., 2014</a>)."

In contrast to a previous study, we found that SNr neurons express several members of the TRP channel family in addition to TRPC3 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Interestingly, we found that NSCCs other than TRP channels were also expressed by SNr neurons. In particular, NALCN stood out as a promising candidate for the tonic depolarizing current, as it had the highest expression of all NSCCs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>) and its expression was in the top 20% of all ion channels (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

To overcome the caveats inherent in the use of nonspecific pharmacological blockers, we used a genetic approach to directly test whether NALCN is necessary for the spontaneous activity of SNr neurons. We used transgenic mice in which an exon of <i>Nalcn</i> is flanked by loxP sites (<i>Nalcn<sup>fl/fl</sup></i>) (<a href=\"#bib17\">Flourakis et al., 2015</a>) to conditionally eliminate NALCN in SNr neurons. The cre-dependent knockout was induced by unilateral injection of an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector expressing fluorescently tagged cre recombinase driven by a neuron-specific promoter (hSyn-EGFP-cre) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). After expression for 1\u20132 weeks, acute brain slices were prepared and GFP-positive (NALCN KO) cells were targeted for cell-attached patch clamp recordings (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). GFP-negative (control) cells from the injected and uninjected hemispheres were used as controls. Consistent with an important role of NALCN in maintaining spontaneous firing of SNr neurons, the spontaneous firing rate of NALCN KO SNr neurons was significantly lower than control SNr neurons (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,D</a>). In contrast, the firing rate of virally transduced SNr neurons from WT mice was unaffected, confirming that the slower firing rate of <i>Nalcn<sup>fl/fl</sup> </i>SNr neurons transduced with EGFP-cre was not a consequence of the viral transduction (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>)."

Using a combination of pharmacological and genetic techniques, we showed that: 1) NALCN is functionally active in SNr neurons; 2) NALCN is an important component of the machinery that maintains spontaneous firing in SNr neurons, 3) NALCN is required for sensitivity of SNr neuron firing to glycolysis, and 4) NALCN is important for muscarinic receptor-dependent stimulation of SNr neuron firing.

In the invertebrate species <i>D. melanogaster, C. elegans</i>, and <i>L. stagnalis</i>, their respective NALCN homologs are critical for pacemaker neuron function in circadian rhythms (<a href=\"#bib45\">Nash et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Lear et al., 2005</a>), locomotion (<a href=\"#bib63\">Yeh et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Gao et al., 2015</a>), and respiration (<a href=\"#bib40\">Lu and Feng, 2011</a>). In mice, germ-line ablation of NALCN produces animals that develop normally, but die soon after birth from impairment in the rhythmically active neurons that regulate respiration (<a href=\"#bib38\">Lu et al., 2007</a>). Hippocampal neurons cultured from NALCN KO mice show significantly hyperpolarized membrane potentials indicating an important function of NALCN in maintaining depolarized membrane potentials. A recent study employing conditional knockout of NALCN in forebrain excitatory neurons demonstrated that NALCN is necessary for appropriate excitability of neurons of the suprachiasmatic nucleus and underlies circadian rhythms in flies and rodents (<a href=\"#bib17\">Flourakis et al., 2015</a>). In addition, this study reported that the forebrain NALCN knockout mice died ~21 days after birth, further indicating the critical function of this channel. Our results demonstrate that NALCN is necessary for normal spontaneous firing of SNr neurons and for the regulation of SNr excitability. The combined results of these studies are consistent with the idea that NALCN is a critical component of neuronal excitability in many rhythmically active neurons (<a href=\"#bib50\">Ren, 2011</a>)."

We find that it is important for regulation of SNr neuronal excitability in response to changes in glycolysis, an effect we had seen previously when investigating metabolic influences on SNr firing rate (<a href=\"#bib41\">Lutas et al., 2014</a>). Together with our finding that the increased firing produced by muscarinic receptor activation is blunted in NALCN KO SNr neurons, these results suggest that tuning the level of NALCN activity may set both the tonic and phasic excitability of SNr neurons."

Our finding that NALCN activity decreases when we block glycolysis in SNr neuron may also occur in beta cells. In beta cells, a decrease in NALCN activity along with an increase in ATP-sensitive potassium channel activity when glucose levels are low would work together to hyperpolarize beta cells and prevent insulin release. Therefore, the metabolic sensitivity of NALCN may be a broadly used modality to confer metabolic sensitivity to NALCN-expressing cells."

                        "text": "One question that arises from our results is how the activity of NALCN is decreased by the inhibition of glycolysis. A possible insight comes from the finding that metabotropic receptor signaling can modulate the activity of NALCN in neurons (<a href=\"#bib39\">Lu et al., 2009</a>) and pancreatic beta cells (<a href=\"#bib54\">Swayne et al., 2009</a>). Interestingly, this metabotropic receptor signaling does not modulate NALCN via canonical G-protein coupled signaling; rather, channel activity is regulated by phosphorylation of the channel by Src kinases (<a href=\"#bib50\">Ren, 2011</a>). Phosphorylation of NALCN may be the major regulator of NALCN activity, either activating or inhibiting channel activity. During inhibition of glycolysis, the drop in cytosolic [ATP] and increase in [AMP] activates AMP kinase (AMPK) (<a href=\"#bib29\">Kahn et al., 2005</a>), which may directly phosphorylate NALCN at a site that leads to decreased NALCN activity. An example of this possibility is the ion channel Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR), which is activated by Src kinases phosphorylation (<a href=\"#bib7\">Billet et al., 2015</a>), but inhibited by AMPK phosphorylation (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hallows et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Kongsuphol et al., 2009</a>). Alternatively, there may be crosstalk between AMPK and the ability of Src family kinases to activate NALCN (such crosstalk is seen in regulation of metabolism by the Src family kinase Fyn and AMPK (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bastie et al., 2007</a>)). An exciting direction for future studies will be to better understand how intracellular signaling pathways regulate NALCN activity in neurons."

Recent studies have found that mutations in NALCN result in severe motor and cognitive deficits in humans (<a href=\"#bib13\">Chong et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Aoyagi et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Al-Sayed et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">K\u00f6ro\u011flu et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Fukai et al., 2016</a>). In addition, humans carrying mutations in UNC80, a protein that is important for the function of NALCN (<a href=\"#bib50\">Ren, 2011</a>), show severe deficits that mirror those observed in humans with mutations in NALCN (<a href=\"#bib46\">Perez et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Shamseldin et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Stray-Pedersen et al., 2016</a>). The SNr is a main output of the basal ganglia motor circuit and provides tonic inhibition of target areas (<a href=\"#bib24\">Hikosaka, 2007</a>). Our finding that SNr neurons require NALCN for appropriate tonic firing, suggests that NALCN mutations could contribute to basal ganglia related motor disorders. For example, disruption of the normal tonic firing of SNr neurons by injection of GABA receptor agonists, leads to excessive muscle tension and dystonia (<a href=\"#bib9\">Burbaud et al., 1998</a>). In addition, hyperactivity of the SNr is observed in Parkinsonian animals (<a href=\"#bib59\">Wichmann et al., 1999</a>) and ablation of the SNr can ameliorate symptoms of Parkinson\u2019s diseases (<a href=\"#bib60\">Wichmann et al., 2001</a>). Therefore, understanding the function of NALCN in modulating the tonic activity of SNr neurons may lead to a more detailed mechanistic understanding of motor dysfunction in humans and potentially provide a new therapeutic target for motor disorders."

This observation is in contrast to the effects of Gd<sup>3+</sup>, which completely silenced firing of WT SNr neurons; this suggests that other Gd<sup>3+-</sup>sensitive currents, in addition to NALCN, may drive the firing of SNr neurons. We tested the possibility that other NSCCs that we found to be expressed in SNr neurons (TRPM7, TRPM2, and pannexin) may contribute to the firing rate; however, we found that TRPM7 knock-out or pharmacological inhibition of TRPM2 or pannexin were without effect on the firing rate of SNr neurons. Therefore, we were unable to identify NSCCs, other than NALCN, that are critical for spontaneous firing. One interesting possibility to explain the continued firing in the NALCN KO is that the expression of inward-current-carrying leak channels may be balanced homeostatically with outward-current-carrying leak potassium channels. In that case, loss of NALCN would lead to decreased expression of leak potassium channels and therefore offset the decreased inward current, allowing spontaneous firing to persist. While this idea is attractive, we did not find direct evidence of this possibility. In our single-cell gene expression dataset, there was no significant correlation between the expression of NALCN and the two highest expressed leak potassium channels, KCNK1 and KCNK3. Additionally, the results of our steady-state I-V recordings were inconsistent with a decrease in leak potassium current. If outward leak currents were decreasing along with inward leak currents, we would expect to observe a significant increase in the membrane resistance of SNr neurons lacking NALCN, but we did not. It remains possible that changes in the expression of other ion channels may compensate for the loss of NALCN in the knockout, as spontaneous firing is a critical function of the SNr."

The solution contained the dissociated tissue was then diluted in 20\u2009mL of HEPES-based ACSF with 1% FBS and poured into a sterile 140\u2009mm petri dish (VWR). The petri dish was placed in an inverted fluorescence microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan;\u00a0Eclipse TE300) to detect GFP positive cells. Individual cells were collected by aspiration into unfilamented borosilicate pipettes (Warner Instruments, G150-4) pulled to have tip diameters around the size of a cell soma (10\u201330 \u00b5m). Pipettes were positioned using a micromanipulator (Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA;\u00a0MPC100) while visually monitoring with 160x magnification. Pipettes were not pre-filled with solution and slight positive pressure was maintained when entering the solution in the petri dish to prevent solution from entering the pipette. Unfilamented capillary tubes were used to minimize capillary action. Typically only a few millimeters of solution entered the pipette tip and the meniscus of the solution was clearly visible in the field of view."

Slight suction via syringe was applied to gently capture the cell and the pipette was immediately withdrawn from the solution. The pipette tip was broken into the bottom of a PCR tube contained 5 \u00b5L of TCL-buffer (Qiagen) and pressure was applied via syringe to eject any solution in the pipette. The PCR tube was then flash frozen in ethanol with dry ice and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until being sent for library preparation and sequencing. Around 15 cells were collected from each dissociated cell preparation and this collection was completed in 1\u20132\u2009hr. A total of 96 cells were collected for sequencing."

Briefly, total RNA was purified using RNA-SPRI beads and poly(A)-tail mRNA was converted to cDNA before being amplified. cDNA was subject to transposon-based fragmentation that used dual-indexing to barcode each fragment of each converted transcript with a combination of barcodes specific to each sample. Barcoded cDNA fragments were then pooled prior to sequencing. Paired-end reads (2 x 25 bp) were generated using an Illumina Next-Seq500 (San Diego, CA)."

The analgesic ketoprofen (10 mg/kg) was injected subcutaneously at the beginning of the surgery. Body temperature was maintained at 37\u00b0C by a heated pad below the mouse. The skull was exposed via a small incision and a small hole was drilled to target the SNr. SNr coordinates (from lambda in mm): 1.1 anterior, -1.1 lateral, -3.6 from pia. To conditionally disrupt <i>Nalcn</i> or <i>Trpm7</i>, we injected mice with a virus carrying an EGFP tagged cre construct (AAV9.hSyn.HI.eGFP-Cre.WPRE.SV40; catalog number AV-9-PV1848; UPenn Viral Vector Core). The virus was diluted in saline to a final titer of 5.54 x 10<sup>11</sup> genome copies/mL. Using a pulled glass capillary pipette (Wiretrol II, Drummond Scientific Company, Broomall, PA) connected to an UltraMicroPump III (WPI, Sarasota, FL) microinjector, 200 nL of virus was injected at a rate of 100 nL/min. The pipette was left in place for 5 min before removal. We waited 1\u20132 weeks post-injection before performing brain slice electrophysiology from these mice."

The spontaneous firing or \"pacemaking\" properties of neurons are of interest, because knowing which ionic currents drive repetitive firing will not only help explain how these neurons code information but might also identify possible therapeutic targets, since disruptions of basal activity are associated with disease states. Here, the authors rule out some candidate ion channels for making SNr neurons fire, and then take the more comprehensive approach of doing RNA-seq and finding high expression of NALCN, the sodium leak conductance channel. This work shows that Nalcn mRNA is highly expressed in SNr neurons and also demonstrates the glycolysis sensitivity of channel function as well as the susceptibility to modulation by neurotransmitters. It thus reveals NALCN as a fundamental yet tunable regulator of excitability in central neurons."

The spontaneous firing or \"pacemaking\" properties of various neurons are of interest, especially those in the basal ganglia (here, the substantia nigra pars reticulata SNr) because disruptions of basal activity are associated with diseases like Parkinson's. Knowing what ionic currents drive repetitive firing will not only help explain how these cells code information but might also identify possible therapeutic targets. Here, the authors rule out some obvious candidates for what makes SNr neurons fire, and then take the more comprehensive approach of doing RNA-seq and finding high expression of the fairly recently discovered NaLCN, the sodium leak conductance channel. The data are convincing and well presented. This manuscript goes beyond previous physiological work from other labs (on other neurons), not only in showing at the RNA level that NACLN is highly expressed in SNr neurons but also in demonstrating the glycolysis sensitivity of channel function, and the susceptibility to modulation by neurotransmitters. It thus sets up NALCN as a fundamental yet tunable regulator of excitability in central neurons."

                    "text": "Reviewer 2: This paper addresses a very important neurobiology question: why some neurons spontaneously fire? It has been known for decades that, in many spontaneously firing neurons, a tonically active cation conductance \"constantly\" drives the membrane potential toward threshold to generate spontaneous firing. A commonly held model, although rarely tested, is that some of the non-selective TRP channels code the cation conductance. With several elegant approaches, the authors in this paper overthrow this model and establish a new paradigm. To \"unbiasedly\" identify the conductance, the authors first painstakingly obtained single cell transcriptomes of 62 identified SNr neurons (known to spontaneously fire). With this data set (which by itself is a useful resource to the community), the authors fished out all the ion channel genes with high expression in the neurons. Guided by the finding that NALCN and its associated subunits UNC79 and UNC80 are the highest expressors, the authors used pharmacological tools and a Nalcn conditional knockout to demonstrate that NALCN indeed is a key to spontaneous firing in the SNr neurons. In addition, they discovered that NALCN is required for the normal regulation of firing rates by glycolysis inhibition and by mAChR activation. Finally, the authors provide data against the TRP-based model: inhibiting or knocking out several TRP channels had no major effect on the spontaneous firing. The paper establishes the long-sought molecular identity of a conductance essential for a highly important behavior of some neurons. It also clears up a common misconception in the field. The experiments are well done and the conclusions are convincing."

                    "text": "Reviewer 3: This elegant paper is a continuation of ongoing research on the mechanism of spontaneous firing of the GABAergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr). First, authors developed a method to identify, isolate, and collect samples from SNr GABAergic neurons. Then, using transcriptome analysis, the determined all expressed nonselective cation channels (NSCCs) channels according to their weight in the whole transcriptome expression. Then, they functionally evaluate channels with the highest expression. One of the strongest points is that authors clearly demonstrate that controversial TRPCs channels, which previously thought to modulate SNr neuronal firing, are not involved in it. The data clearly point out sodium NaLCN leak channel as a primary mediator of the SNr neuronal tonic firing, based on intersectional pharmacology and knock down experiments. Authors evaluated a number of other highly expressed channels, but found none of them to be involved in the neuronal firing modulation. Furthermore they document regulation of NaLCN channels by glycolytic pathways and mGluRs. The paper is well written, reasonably organized and easy to read. It has outstanding scientific value and substantially contributes to the field of neuroscience, specifically to our understanding of mechanisms of spontaneous neuronal activity. The NaLCN \u2013 dependent mechanism demonstrated in this work could lead to a development of new drugs targeting NaLCN channel."
