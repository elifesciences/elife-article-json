                    "text": "Synaptojanin and endophilin represent a classic pair of endocytic proteins that exhibit coordinated action during rapid synaptic vesicle endocytosis. Current models suggest that synaptojanin activity is tightly associated with endophilin through high-affinity binding between the synaptojanin proline-rich domain (PRD) and the endophilin SH3 domain. Surprisingly, we find that truncated synaptojanin lacking the PRD domain sustains normal synaptic transmission, indicating that synaptojanin's core function in vivo resides in the remaining two domains that contain phosphoinositide-phosphatase activities: an N-terminal Sac1 phosphatase domain and a 5-phosphatase domain. We further show that the Sac1 domain plays an unexpected role in targeting synaptojanin to synapses. The requirement for Sac1 is bypassed by tethering the synaptojanin 5-phophatase to the endophilin membrane-bending Bin\u2013Amphiphysin\u2013Rvs (BAR) domain. Together, our results uncover an unexpected role for the Sac1 domain in vivo in supporting coincident action between synaptojanin and endophilin at synapses."

Current models suggest that synaptojanin activity is tightly associated with endophilin through high-affinity binding between the synaptojanin proline-rich domain (PRD) and the endophilin SH3 domain. Surprisingly, we find that truncated synaptojanin lacking the PRD domain sustains normal synaptic transmission, indicating that synaptojanin's core function in vivo resides in the remaining two domains that contain phosphoinositide-phosphatase activities: an N-terminal Sac1 phosphatase domain and a 5-phosphatase domain. We further show that the Sac1 domain plays an unexpected role in targeting synaptojanin to synapses. The requirement for Sac1 is bypassed by tethering the synaptojanin 5-phophatase to the endophilin membrane-bending Bin\u2013Amphiphysin\u2013Rvs (BAR) domain. Together, our results uncover an unexpected role for the Sac1 domain in vivo in supporting coincident action between synaptojanin and endophilin at synapses."

Synaptojanin is made up of three structural units (or \u2018domains\u2019), including the proline-rich domain and the Sac1 domain. It has been proposed that interactions between endophilin and the proline-rich domain of synaptojanin are essential for vesicle recycling."

A classic example is the functional pair of synaptojanin and endophilin (<a href=\"#bib19\">Gad et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Schuske et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Song and Zinsmaier, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Verstreken et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Dickman et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Milosevic et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Sullivan, 2011</a>). Synaptojanin is a neuronal phosphoinositide phosphatase that hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) to facilitate SV recycling at presynaptic terminals (<a href=\"#bib36\">McPherson et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Cremona et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Harris et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Verstreken et al., 2003</a>). Deletion of synaptojanin leads to severe synaptic defects, including depletion of SVs, accumulation of endocytic intermediates, and subsequent failure in synaptic transmission (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cremona et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Harris et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Verstreken et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Van Epps et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Dickman et al., 2005</a>). Overexpression of synaptojanin causes PI(4,5)P2 deficiency and learning deficits in Down syndrome model mice (<a href=\"#bib54\">Voronov et al., 2008</a>). While the importance of synaptojanin is well documented, the precise mechanisms for its role in SV recycling remain elusive."

Mutant animals lacking either synaptojanin or endophilin share identical defects at synapses. These defects are not exacerbated in double mutants, supporting that synaptojanin and endophilin function in the same pathway. Current models suggest that synaptojanin is transiently recruited to endocytic sites via direct binding between the endophilin SH3 domain and the synaptojanin proline-rich domain (PRD) (<a href=\"#bib45\">Schuske et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Verstreken et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Milosevic et al., 2011</a>). In vitro binding assays provide evidence for a biochemical interaction between PRD and SH3 (<a href=\"#bib43\">Ringstad et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">de Heuvel et al., 1997</a>), and blocking PRD-SH3 interactions by peptides induces abnormal accumulation of endocytic intermediates at synapses (<a href=\"#bib19\">Gad et al., 2000</a>). However, we recently found that truncated endophilin lacking the SH3 domain has synaptic activity in vivo (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bai et al., 2010</a>), suggesting that synaptojanin and endophilin interact through PRD-SH3 independent mechanisms. Alternatively, synaptojanin may be recruited through redundant SH3 harboring proteins, such as amphiphysin (<a href=\"#bib37\">Micheva et al., 1997</a>) and intersectin (<a href=\"#bib16\">Evergren et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Pechstein et al., 2010</a>)."

This configuration of tandem phosphatases is unique to synaptojanin, as other phosphoinositide phosphatases (e.g., OCRL and SHIP1/2) have single catalytic domains that are linked to protein- or membrane-binding domains such as PH, SH2, and C2 domains (<a href=\"#bib41\">Pirruccello and De Camilli, 2012</a>). Interactions through the non-catalytic domains often enhance phosphatase specificity in membrane recognition through coincident detection of multiple targets (<a href=\"#bib6\">Carlton and Cullen, 2005</a>). While it is thought that synaptojanin's tandem phosphatase domains act together to degrade multiple types of phosphoinositides at synapses (<a href=\"#bib23\">Guo et al., 1999</a>), the precise role of synaptojanin's tandem phosphatase domains is unclear."

In transgenic animals, a single copy of the transgene (<i>unc-26\u2206PRD::gfp</i>) driven by a pan-neuronal promoter (<i>Prab-3</i>) was inserted into chromosome X to avoid confounding issues of overexpression (<a href=\"#bib18\">Fr\u00f8kjaer-Jensen et al., 2012</a>). We reasoned that if the PRD domain is essential, the truncated UNC-26\u2206PRD should not rescue mutant defects.

The N-terminal Sac1 domain degrades phosphoinositides by hydrolyzing the 3- and 4-position phosphates (<a href=\"#bib23\">Guo et al., 1999</a>), whereas the central 5-phosphatase domain converts PI(4,5)P2 into PI(4)P by removing the 5-position phosphate from the inositol ring (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cremona and De Camilli, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Chang-Ileto et al., 2011</a>).

Surprisingly, we found that removal of the Sac1 domain severely disrupted the rescuing activity of UNC-26 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>), suggesting that the physical presence of Sac1 is required. Although isolated Sac1 and 5-phophatase fold correctly (<a href=\"#bib49\">Tsujishita et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Manford et al., 2010</a>), it remains possible that Sac1 deletion may perturb the folding of UNC-26. To address this issue in vivo, we used an intein-mediated protein ligation method to reconnect Sac1 to UNC-26 post-translationally (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). We reasoned that if Sac1 truncation causes protein misfolding, UNC-26 would remain inactive after reconnecting with Sac1. However, if truncated UNC-26 fragments retain correct folding structure, protein ligation should lead to active full-length UNC-26."

We utilized three categories of proteins as candidate targeting tethers: (1) SV proteins SNB-1 (Synaptobrevin) and RAB-3; (2) lipid-binding domains that recognize specific phosphoinositides (<a href=\"#bib32\">Lomasney et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">V\u00e1rnai et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Stahelin et al., 2007</a>); and (3) endocytic protein machinery adaptor AP2 subunits and accessory proteins (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a> and <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Among all proteins tested, UNC-57 endophilin was the only molecular tether that significantly restored UNC-26 activity in supporting endogenous EPSCs and evoked responses, no matter whether the PRD domain is present (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A\u2013E</a> and <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). The 5-phosphatase activity was still required for proper functioning of this chimeric UNC-57::UNC-26\u2206Sac1 protein, as the D716A mutation disrupted its ability to rescue synaptic defects (<a href=\"#fig8s2\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Overall, our findings indicate that the Sac1 domain has a non-enzymatic role in guiding synaptojanin 5-phosphatase, which can be replaced by endophilin."

While synaptojanin and endophilin have distinct biochemical properties, disruption of either protein leads to similar defects in SV recycling, indicating that synaptojanin and endophilin are functional partners in vivo (<a href=\"#bib45\">Schuske et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Verstreken et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Van Epps et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Dickman et al., 2005</a>). Currently, the molecular basis for such functional cooperation is attributed solely to the specific and high-affinity binding between the synaptojanin PRD domain and the endophilin SH3 domain (<a href=\"#bib12\">de Heuvel et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Ringstad et al., 1997</a>). Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation may regulate SV endocytosis by controlling PRD-SH3 interactions (<a href=\"#bib29\">Lee et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Irie et al., 2005</a>). Although the current model suggests that the PRD-SH3 interactions are required, our data show that synaptojanin and endophilin remain active without the PRD and the SH3 domains, respectively. Similarly, mutant mouse synaptojanin that is defective in PRD-SH3 binding supports rapid endocytosis upon short stimuli (at 10 Hz) in mammalian neurons (<a href=\"#bib35\">Mani et al., 2007</a>). These results show that the SH3-PRD interactions are not essential for synaptojanin activity in SV endocytosis."

This observation suggests that the SH3-PRD interactions are important for cellular activities; however, the precise role of these interactions is unclear. It is worth noting that our findings do not rule out a modulatory role of the SH3-PRD interactions at synapses. For example, in cultured hippocampal neurons, the SH3-PRD interactions enhance the fidelity and speed of SV endocytosis after intense stimulation (<a href=\"#bib35\">Mani et al., 2007</a>). Thus, it is possible that the PRD-SH3 interaction facilitates co-localization of endophilin and synaptojanin, helping the Sac1-dependent mechanism to sustain membrane recycling during persistent activity. In addition, while the PRD domain alone is not sufficient to promote SV endocytosis, it may become required in some situations, for example, when the Sac1-membrane interactions are reduced. Furthermore, PRD and SH3 domains may function in other important cellular processes, contributing to their conservation. Indeed, photoreceptor neurons in the zebrafish synaptojanin mutant exhibit significant defects in endosomes and the Golgi apparatus (<a href=\"#bib22\">George et al., 2014</a>), suggesting that synaptojanin is needed for membrane-trafficking events at other intracellular organelles. The SH3-PRD interactions may be important for targeting membrane organelles in the cell body, where synaptojanin is less abundant than at synapses."

Interestingly, while both phosphatase domains have catalytic activities in vitro (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cremona et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Guo et al., 1999</a>)<i>,</i> the enzymatic activity of the 5-phosphatase domain is the only one required for synaptojanin function at synapses. This is consistent with previous findings showing that the major phosphoinositide defect in synaptojanin knockout mice is the abnormal accumulation of PI(4,5)P2 (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cremona et al., 1999</a>). However, the 5-phosphatase activity alone is not enough. Expression of the 5-phosphatase, with or without the PRD domain, fails to restore synaptic activity. Unexpectedly, an enzymatic-dead version of Sac1 restores the activity of the 5-phosphatase domain to support synaptic transmission. These data suggest that the Sac1 domain possesses a novel targeting activity, which the PRD domain does not have."

The timing of synaptojanin recruitment is likely to be critical because SV endocytosis is a rapid process that occurs on the time scale of seconds (<a href=\"#bib3\">Balaji and Ryan, 2007</a>). Our findings suggest that the targeting activity of Sac1 allows synaptojanin to recognize endocytic intermediates. In agreement with this notion, tethering synaptojanin 5-phosphatase to endophilin bypasses the requirement of the Sac1 domain and revives synaptojanin activity, suggesting that synaptojanin 5-phosphatase functions at sites where endophilin resides. Therefore, we propose that the Sac1 domain acts together with the 5-phosphatase as coincident detectors for membranes enriched in PI(4,5)P2 and endophilin."

The endophilin BAR domain induces defects in lipid packing (<a href=\"#bib21\">Gallop et al., 2006</a>) and consequently increases the exposure of lipid head groups. One possibility is that the synaptojanin Sac1 domain recognizes the lipid-packing defects generated by endophilin BAR, which in turn stimulates neighboring 5-phosphatase to degrade exposed PI(4,5)P2 head groups (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chang-Ileto et al., 2011</a>). Alternatively, it is also possible that membranes stimulate direct binding between the Sac1 domain and the endophilin BAR domain. Nonetheless, our results show that the Sac1 domain is a crucial targeting domain for synaptojanin function.

The head neuron ganglion was exposed by a small incision using a sharp needle. After the ganglion was exposed, a second incision was made at the middle section of worm body to release internal pressure. Dissected worms were gently rinsed with standard medium. To stimulate FM4-64 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) loading, dissected worms were incubated with high-potassium buffer (85 mM KCl, 70 mM NaCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 4 mM MgCl2, 10 mM glucose, and 10 mM HEPES [pH 7.3]) in the presence of 10 \u00b5M FM4-64 dye for 1 min.

For all images in each Z-stack, an area of interest (AOI) was defined by drawing a circle of 45 \u00b5m in diameter around the neuron ganglion. Total fluorescence of each image was obtained by integrating fluorescence pixel intensity within the AOI. Background fluorescence was subtracted from all images.

GST-tagged UNC-57 proteins (10 \u00b5g) were immobilized on glutathione beads (Genscript). Recombinant MBP::UNC-26::His6 fragments (2 \u00b5M) were then incubated with beads in a binding buffer composed of 20 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and 1 mM Dithiothreitol (DTT). After 2 hr, the beads were washed 3 times with binding buffer, and the sample was treated with SDS sample buffer, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250."

Mice (e.g., Swiss Webster, A/J, and C57BL/6) were immunized, and immune splenocytes were isolated from mice showing positive antisera titers (ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay). Isolated splenocytes were electrofused (BTX, Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA) to the NS-1/FOX-NY myeloma cell line. Antibody secreting hybridomas were identified using standard ELISA screens, and monoclonal hybridomas were isolated by limiting dilution subcloning. Monoclonal antibodies to UNC-57 and UNC-26 were further screened and characterized by Western blot analysis of recombinant proteins and <i>C. elegans</i> detergent extracts."

Adult animals were collected using the sucrose flotation method, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and homogenized for 20 s using a mini bead-beater16 (Biospec Product, Bartlesville, OK) in M9 buffer with 2 mM Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), 1 mM DTT, and 1\u00d7 protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma). Worm samples were then cooled for 1 min on ice. The beat/cool cycle was repeated 6 times to completely lyse the worms. Triton-X100 (final 1%) was next added to extract total protein. After 15 min of incubation, crude protein extracts were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm in an Eppendorf centrifuge (5417C, Eppendorf AG, Germany) for 10 min at 4\u00b0C to remove the beads, worm debris, and unbroken worms. The protein concentration of worm extracts was determined by the Pierce bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA). Primary antibodies against UNC-57BAR and UNC-26 5-phophatase were used for Western blot. Immunoreactive bands were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence and were quantified using a Bio-Rad ChemiDoc MP imaging system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA)."

While these two proteins are well-established factors in the synaptic vesicle cycle (knockouts of either one severely impair synaptic transmission), how or whether they cooperate in this process is less well understood. There is published biochemical evidence for direct binding between endophilin and synaptojanin (SYNJ) via their SH3 and proline rich domains respectively, and this has led to a model where a direct interaction between these domains underlies their function in synaptic endocytosis and maintenance of the vesicle pool. This manuscript centers on the surprising result that the SYNJ PRD (and therefore its direct interaction with endophilin) is dispensible for its function in supporting normal synaptic transmission. Instead, SYNJ's Sac1 domain appears to play an important role (independent of its phosphatase activity) and is potentially required for enriching it at synapses. Overall, the experiments are solid, using a UNC-26 genetic deletion/transgene rescue approach with various mutants and truncations. The novel and non-catalytic role of the Sac1 domain and the surprising result that SYNJ's PRD is not essential for its role in synaptic transmission make this work conceptually interesting and challenges the existing model. The potential applicability of this mechanism to other forms of membrane trafficking make the work of broader interest beyond the synaptic vesicle trafficking field. While the role of the Sac1 domain remains mysterious, this domain is potentially interesting in light of recent evidence for a SYNJ Sac1 mutation (which impairs it's catalytic activity) in a family with early onset Parkinsonism."

For example, if Sac1 binds PI3,4P lipids, its localization may be disrupted when the levels of these lipids are low. In this case, the SH3/PRD interaction may be required for endocytosis</i>."
