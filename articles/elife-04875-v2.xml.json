The budding yeast, <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, lacks homologs to genes that make up the core oscillator or light-sensing pathways of fungal circadian rhythms (<a href=\"#bib5\">Brunner and Kaldi, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Idnurm and Heitman, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Salichos and Rokas, 2010</a>) and does not display any 24-hr behavior capable of sustained autonomous oscillations in a constant environment (<a href=\"#bib6\">Eelderink-Chen et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Robertson et al., 2013</a>). As an example of a novel trait, we evolved a 24-hr oscillator in the budding yeast to determine how biologically complex machinery could evolve from proteins and signaling networks that lack any known connection to oscillatory behavior. Because circadian clocks can be entrained by environmental signals and have a temperature-independent period, whereas the behavior we have evolved represents an autonomous oscillator with a period of roughly 24 hr that controls a biological output, we refer to the circuit we have evolved as a diurnal oscillator, referring to its period, rather than the distinction between day and night."

We expressed yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) from the promoter of the <i>FLO1</i> gene (<a href=\"#bib23\">Verstrepen et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Rando and Verstrepen, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Verstrepen and Fink, 2009</a>) and elevated the mutation rate about 100-fold by mutating the proof-reading activity of DNA polymerase \u2202 (<i>POL3</i>) (<a href=\"#bib10\">Jin et al., 2005</a>). We used FACS to select for variation in YFP fluorescence over a 24-hr period: each cycle began with selection of the dimmest events, the selected cells were allowed to proliferate, and the population was then selected, 10 hr later; for the brightest events, the selected cells were allowed to proliferate, and the dimmest events were selected, 14 hr later, completing the cycle (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). We evolved two parallel populations using two different strengths of selection: the top and bottom 6% (E6) or 15% (E15) of the events detected by FACS. The selected cells proliferated for roughly six divisions before the next selection. Our scheme selects for synchrony rather than entrainment: twice a day, we select the cells with high or low fluorescence, rather than varying an environmental cue and selecting for a response to it. The human analogy would be to go to a large, international airport and select only those travelers who had arrived from the same time zone, rather than taking all newly arrived passengers and using alternating light and dark cycles to entrain their clocks over a period of several days."

To analyze the behavior of the evolved populations in more detail, we cultured them from stocks frozen that had been prepared at the end of the original selection. When they are first thawed, these populations are asynchronous, presumably because the manipulations associated with freezing and thawing disrupt the synchrony between the oscillations of different individuals. We therefore subjected these cultures to the same, twice daily, selection used for the evolution: the dimmest events are collected, cells are allowed to proliferate for 10 hr, the population distribution of fluorescence is recorded by FACS, and the brightest events are collected. After 14 hr of proliferation, distributions are recorded, and the dimmest events are collected to complete the cycle (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). This protocol is a form of selection synchrony: it synchronizes a population by selecting those members that are at the peaks and troughs of a cycle of fluorescence intensity, rather than by applying a stimulus that alters the phase of the oscillations until all members of the population have the same phase (induction synchrony or entrainment). After synchronization, both evolved populations showed a cyclical change in the fluorescence distribution, with the E6 population giving larger shifts than the less strongly selected E15 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). It takes more cycles of synchronization of E15 to achieve the full amplitude of daily oscillation than it does for E6, which is largely synchronized within 24 hr of selection."

Just before their scheduled selection for low fluorescence, the population was predominantly single-celled, and just before their selection for high fluorescence, most cells were in multicellular clumps (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). The fluorescence per cell is constant over 24 hr, for both YFP and RFP, and thus the cyclical variation in intensity seen by FACS is entirely due to changes in cell association (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Because we see similar fluctuations in the fluorescence from <i>P</i><sub><i>ACT1</i></sub><i>-RFP</i> as we do from <i>P</i><sub><i>FLO1</i></sub><i>-YFP</i>, we believe that we would have selected for oscillations in cell aggregation with any promoter that drove the expression of a fluorescent protein to levels that were sufficient for our FACS-based selection."

To look for this behavior, we subdivided a single population of clone E6-1 and subjected it to two different treatments: synchronizing it by FACS selection, as described above, or subjecting it to identical manipulations, except that we collected all the events that passed through the FACS, without regard to their fluorescence intensity. The first population oscillated, showing primarily single cells just before the selection for low YFP fluorescence, and primarily clumps just before the selection for high YFP fluorescence, whereas the unsynchronized population showed very similar distributions at these two times (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C, D</a>).

The first, cerulean fluorescent protein (CFP) was expressed from a constitutive promoter (<i>P</i><sub><i>ACT1</i></sub>) to distinguish two genetically identical subclones: one expressed CFP (CFP<sup>+</sup>) and the other did not (CFP<sup>\u2212</sup>). The second was introduced by labeling cells, just after FACS selection, by covalently linking Oregon Green 488-X, a yellow fluorescent molecule, to their cell walls (<a href=\"#bib8\">Hoch et al., 2005</a>). Because a daughter\u2019s cell wall is entirely new, the original cells retain the yellow label and their daughters are unlabeled (<a href=\"#bib2\">Barral et al., 2000</a>). We followed these cultures as they proliferated and eventually switched to the other phase of the morphological oscillation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Single cells that were selected for by sorting for low YFP fluorescence and covalently labeled (T = 0 hr), proliferated to become clumps composed of a single yellow cell surrounded with non-yellow cells that had the same CFP expression state as the original single cell. The absence of clumps containing more than one yellow cell or both CFP<sup>+</sup> and CFP<sup>\u2212</sup> cells in the same clump shows that cells emerging from the single-cell phase build lineage-based clumps. Consistent with this interpretation, we saw synchronous oscillations in cell association even at very high dilution (\u223c10<sup>3</sup> cells/ml). Multicellular clumps, which were covalently labeled at the time of peak aggregation gave rise to single cells by a combination of two mechanisms: fragmenting to produce smaller clumps and proliferating to produce single-celled offspring. Smaller clumps consisting of yellow cells and newly born non-yellow cells were observed 3 hr after (T = 13 hr) the peak aggregation time (10 hr). By 18 hr, the population was a mixture of medium-sized and smaller clumps and single cells, and by 24 hr non-yellow, single cells, and small clumps were the bulk of the population, representing the completion of one cycle. When unsynchronized CFP<sup>+</sup> and CFP<sup>\u2212</sup> subclones were sonicated to break up all the clumps and cultured together for 90 min, clumps that re-associated were composed of a mixture of CFP<sup>+</sup> and CFP<sup>\u2212</sup> cells showing that clumps form by cells sticking together rather than failing to separate after division (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). These results show that cells oscillate between two states over a 24-hr period: single cells produce offspring that immediately stick to their mothers to assemble a lineage-based clump, which later produces a population of single cells and small clumps as a result of clumps fragmenting and producing single cells which divide to produce a mixture of small clumps and single cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>)."

We therefore asked if our synchronized populations could free run: continue to oscillate in the absence of both entraining signals and periodic selection for cells in particular phases of the oscillation. We performed two experiments: one on populations and another to follow lineages initiating from single cells. In the population experiment, E6-1 was subjected to three different conditions. (1) Unsynchronized: cells that had been passaged without earlier synchronization were passed through the FACS machine and diluted twice every 24 hr, with intervals of 10 and 14 hr between the two dilutions, but all cells that passed through the FACS machine were collected, regardless of their fluorescence level and then diluted. (2) Synchronized: a population was synchronized by selection for 3 days with selection at alternating 10 and 14 hr intervals. The culture was synchronized by FACS for another 3 days, by FACS selection and dilution twice every 24 hr, with intervals of 10 and 14 hr between the two dilutions. (3) Free run: a population was synchronized by selection for 3 days at 10:14-hr intervals. After 3 days of synchronization (marked by a dotted line), this culture was not subject to FACs but was simply diluted twice every 24 hr, with intervals of 10 and 14 hr between the two dilutions for an additional 3 days. The initial, synchronized population used to start the free run was the same one that was used to start the population with continuing synchronization. Thus, all three conditions were diluted with intervals of 10 and 14 hr between the two daily dilutions and maintained at a density that allowed continual exponential proliferation. The free run populations continued to show detectable oscillations, which were undetectable in a control population that had not been synchronized (Unsynch) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). We next monitored how individual lineages oscillate without any prior FACS-based synchronization. A single cell was grown in a well of a 96-well plate and imaged every 3.5 hr. After 24 hr, the resulting population was collected and diluted back to single objects, regardless of clump size, into three separate new wells and followed every 3.5 hr for another 24 hr. This procedure was repeated one more time for each lineage (i.e<i>.</i>, 3 cells from each of 3 sub-lineages) for a third day, as shown by the cartoon in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>. This protocol dilutes cells once every 24 hr to keep cells in exponential growth throughout the experiment. Cell lineages produced sustained oscillations for 3 days (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>) with many lineages remaining in phase with each other. In some lineages, their phase shifted within a 24-hr period, but the overall period, over 3 cycles was approximately 24 hr. These results suggest that we have evolved an autonomous oscillator capable of sustained oscillations in the absence of an environmental stimulus."

Individual cells and clumps were imaged every 3.5 hr for 72 hr. At each time point, at least 50% of the cells and clumps in the wells were imaged and the average two-dimensional area was calculated.

We investigated the role of removing genes because two of the causative mutations were stop codons, suggesting that other causative mutations might also inactivate the genes in which they occurred. Each causative mutation could be individually replaced by a gene deletion without destroying the oscillation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). For each of these single gene deletions, the corresponding wild-type version of the same gene was added back and tested for oscillations. Surprisingly, only two genes substantially altered the oscillations: <i>SIR4</i> made E6-1 single-celled and <i>YJL070C</i> produced constitutive clumps (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). To determine how the mutations whose wild-type expression had no effect were contributing to the oscillator, pools of spores from a diploid heterozygous for the eight mutations were selected for four \u2018sub-traits\u2019 of the oscillator: batch culture was used to select for exponential growth and FACS to select for constitutive clumps, single cells, and stochastic clumping. After 5 days of selection, the eight mutations were PCR amplified and Sanger sequenced from genomic DNA of the surviving pool of spores to estimate the frequency of the ancestral and evolved allele (<a href=\"#bib11\">Koschwanez et al., 2013</a>) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>).

Different combinations of <i>HBN1</i>, <i>IDS2</i>, and <i>YJL070C</i> were selected for between replicate experiments in both clumping and single cell sub-traits, making it hard to assess their significance. Because of this variability, and the absence of a phenotype when <i>HBN1</i> or <i>IDS2</i> were either deleted or replaced with wild-type genes, it is unclear if these genes are required for the evolved oscillations, and if they are, how they contribute to them."

The most striking of these were genes involved in sexual behavior. Haploid-specific genes (hsg), which are normally expressed in haploids and repressed in diploids, were repressed in the evolved clone; 8 of the 10 most strongly repressed genes were haploid-specific. This phenotype is due to the causal mutation that inactivates <i>SIR4</i>, a gene required for transcriptional silencing of sub-telomeric genes, and the mating genes at the two silenced loci, <i>HML</i>\u03b1 and <i>HMR</i><b>a</b> (<a href=\"#bib15\">Rine and Herskowitz, 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Herskowitz, 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Pillus and Rine, 1989</a>).

Each mutation was PCR amplified and Sanger sequenced at different time points over the course of the evolution to determine its frequency to an accuracy of roughly 10%. None of the mutations in E6-1 reached a frequency above 0.4, two were undetectable in the overall population, and the remaining six were first detected between 12 and 30 days of evolution (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). The low allele frequencies at the final time point of our evolution have two possible interpretations: the evolved population contains a single oscillating lineage, which has yet to eliminate a substantial fraction of non-oscillating lineages, or it is a mixture of genetically distinct oscillator lineages. All the clones from the evolved populations cycled suggesting that the populations have multiple lineages. We therefore performed bulk segregant analysis on three additional clones from the strongly selected population (E6-2,3,4) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a> and <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 6\u2014source data 1A</a>).

All nine clones have increased expression of <i>HML\u03b1</i> and reduced expression of haploid-specific genes when compared to the ancestor (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Furthermore, deleting <i>HML\u03b1</i> in these clones resulted in a loss of multicellular aggregates in all but one clone (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D, E6-5</a>), even though only one of the clones (E6-2) has the <i>sir4</i> allele found in E6-1."

Fluctuations in metabolic activity can be driven by temperature oscillations with a 24-hr period but rapidly die out at constant temperature (<a href=\"#bib6\">Eelderink-Chen et al., 2010</a>), and a particular regime of growth to high density can induce prolonged metabolic oscillations whose period is 4\u20135 hr (<a href=\"#bib21\">Tu et al., 2005</a>). We think it is unlikely that either of these cycles are connected to the behavior we observe: the 24-hr cycles do not free-run and the shorter cycles have the wrong period and can only be seen at cell densities higher than those that we used. We cannot, however, exclude the possibility that the behavior we see is the result of coupling changes in cell\u2013cell adhesion to a previously unknown circadian clock in budding yeast."

All circadian clocks share four features: (1) a limit-cycle, cell autonomous cellular oscillator that continues to oscillate in the absence of environmental cues (free run); (2) the oscillator maintains a roughly 24-hr period over a range of temperatures (temperature compensation); (3) the period of the internal oscillator can be synchronized, or entrained, to the phase of a daily environmental cue (e.g., light, temperature); and (4) the ability to control cellular and organismal behavior (<a href=\"#bib24\">Young and Kay, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Tauber et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bell-Pedersen et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Rosbash, 2009</a>). Our results show the yeast oscillator we evolved has two of these four behaviors: its roughly 24-hr period is maintained in the absence of environmental cues or selection on the output of the oscillator (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2B, 3A, 3C, 4C, and 4D</a>), and it regulates a cellular behavior, the ability of cells to form clumps. Further investigations are required to determine if the yeast oscillator uses the combination of positive and negative feedback loops that form the core of circadian clocks and could be evolved to be temperature-compensated and entrained by environmental signals."

The ability of multiple combinations of mutations to produce the same complex phenotype leads to two inferences. First, we know relatively little about the circuitry of many existing molecular pathways and evolving novel traits may help illuminate previously unknown connections between pathways. Second, that multiple mutations are capable of producing unexpected changes in cellular physiology by connecting previously unrelated pathways to produce new circuits. The few mutations that are shared between different oscillating lineages suggest that there are multiple, functionally different ways that such rearrangements can lead to the same phenotype."

First, it suggests that wild yeast may regulate their clumpiness during the diploid phase, which accounts for most of their life cycle, and that our evolved populations have exploited this regulation to respond to our selection for oscillatory behavior. Second, the independent evolution of the same trait appears to have a mixture of common and diverse features. All nine of the populations we examined have switched from the haploid- to the diploid-specific pattern of gene expression and all four lineages analyzed in detail have mutated <i>WHI2</i>. The repeated occurrence of these genetic changes suggests that they greatly increase the number of subsequent mutations that could lead to the appearance of an oscillator. Whether the later mutations act on a single pathway or multiple, different pathways will require the detailed dissection of the oscillator's mechanism. It would be interesting to determine whether a selection for oscillation in diploids, where the inactivation of genes requires two independent genetic changes, would take a similar trajectory and produce the same mechanism that we have uncovered in haploids."

We can nevertheless make inferences about the molecular underpinnings of evolutionary novelties. Four of the six mutations that are strongly identified as causal mutations are loss of function mutations. The mutations in <i>SCW11</i> and <i>WHI2</i> are nonsense mutations, whereas those in <i>SIR4</i> and <i>YJL070C</i> can be replaced by gene deletions, but not by restoration of the wild-type gene. The preponderance of loss of function mutants suggests that sophisticated functions can be produced primarily by inactivating genes, rather than modifying or increasing their activities. Whether similar paths are followed in nature is likely to depend on the strength and unidirectionality of selection and the extent of antagonistic pleiotropy: the contrast between the benefits of a mutation in one environment and its costs in others. We speculate that short bursts of intense selection, such as those that occur when a species occupies a new and unoccupied niche, could lead to adaptation that is primarily driven by gene inactivation, whose short-term benefits exceeds its costs. These costs could later be reduced either by suppressor mutations that would minimize the harmful effects of loss of function mutations, while maintaining the evolved phenotype, or even by reversion of the original mutation, once the evolved phenotype had been stabilized by further mutations. Further investigation will be required to determine how often loss of function mutations participate in a variety of evolutionary processes, ranging from cancer to the formation of new species and forms of biological organization."

The resulting spores were released from the ascus by treating the population with 50 \u00b5l of 2 mg/ml zymolyase (Zymo Research) diluted in water for 1 hr at 30\u00b0C. 450 \u00b5l of 1% Triton X-100 diluted in water was added and cells were sonicated for 10\u201320 s. Cells were centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 1 min and resuspended in YPD and grown overnight in exponential phase. 5 \u00d7 10<sup>5</sup> spores were selected in bulk for oscillations in the same manner E6 was originally evolved. Because one of the causal mutations eliminates silencing of <i>HML</i> and <i>HMR</i>, the spores that can cycle are incapable of mating. After 10 days of selection, genomic DNA was purified from the remaining pool of cells and sequenced at high coverage. The frequency of mutations in the mapped reads was scored using published methods (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ares, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Koschwanez et al., 2013</a>). Six putative causal mutations were identified and engineered into a wild-type strain but were insufficient to recreate the oscillator phenotype. This strain was mated to E6-1, sporulated, and individual spores were tested for oscillations. Equal amounts of 30 oscillating spores were pooled and genomic DNA was sequenced to identify the remaining two putative causal mutations in <i>SIR4</i> and <i>SCW11</i>."

This strain was sporulated and the resulting spores were released from the ascus as described above and plated on either media lacking uracil or leucine. Equal numbers of cells from each media were pooled together, a fraction of this pool was frozen down to measure the initial frequency of each mutation (starting population) and the remaining cells were selected by FACS for the noted traits twice a day for 5 days. For exponential growth, cells were diluted by batch culture twice a day to keep them in exponential phase. After 5 days, genomic DNA was isolated from the pool of surviving spores, and the allele frequency of each mutation was determined by methods described above."

Most notably, there was uncertainty among the reviewers as to whether the evolved populations exhibited truly free-running oscillations. At the heart of this issue is <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a> showing YFP levels in several different populations over three days. The E6-1 line seems to oscillate between high and low YFP, but it was not clear whether this population was being subjected to FACS at 10 and 14 hour intervals or was simply being grown for 3 days and then analyzed periodically by flow cytometry. If it's the latter, then how long do oscillations persist? Related to this point of confusion, it was not clear why a synchronization process is required before performing the flow cytometry analysis in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>: after 30 days of selection, shouldn't the evolved population already be synchronized? In this same vein, why doesn't the entire E6 population in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a> show stronger oscillations? Although it is comprised of multiple clones, weren't they all oscillating by the end of the 30 day selection scheme that produced this population? And finally, there was a concern raised about whether the evolved population was oscillating or was being entrained by the selective regime imposed (FACS-based selection at 10 and 14 hour intervals)."

The authors attempted to generate cycles of circadian gene expression, which ended up somewhat surprisingly selecting for daily cycles of cell-cell adhesion or clumping. There is no evident oscillating gene expression, which makes a marked distinction between this (these) evolved oscillator(s) and real circadian oscillators in different biological systems. The authors mapped their phenotype to eight mutations, all of which probably correspond to hypomorphic or amorphic alleles of the eight genes. At least they can be replaced by gene knock-outs. Finally, the authors demonstrate that independently evolved yeast clones have mutations in distinct sets of genes, which do not appear related in any obvious way. By this I mean the different mutant genes are not related to each other, nor is there a relationship between the different mutant genes in the different clones. An exception is the repression of haploid-specific gene expression, which is present in all but one of the clones. The paper in general is first rate; the experiments, figures and text are models of clarity. A key judgment call is significance. I come down positive despite my comments. Requests for experiments were kept minimal, in the spirit of <i>eLife</i> policy."

I am bothered though by one potentially significant matter: evidence supporting the claim that the authors have evolved a circadian oscillator. There exists the possibility that the cells have adapted to the selective regime and that continuing to propagate the cells under the same 10 h and 14 h regime, even without FACS is at least in part responsible for the observed changes between single cells and clumps. I think that it is necessary to exclude this possibility. I do recognise that the authors report an experiment that attempts to rule out entrainment, but this still uses, from what I can, the 10 and 14 h regime. Perhaps take the cells and propagate them in a chemostat, or simply change duration of the cycle: take cells that are about to experience the 10 h phase and provide them with 14 h (and vice versa)."

I am bothered though by one potentially significant matter: evidence supporting the claim that the authors have evolved a circadian oscillator. There exists the possibility that the cells have adapted to the selective regime and that continuing to propagate the cells under the same 10 h and 14 h regime, even without FACS is at least in part responsible for the observed changes between single cells and clumps. I think that it is necessary to exclude this possibility. I do recognise that the authors report an experiment that attempts to rule out entrainment, but this still uses, from what I can, the 10 and 14 h regime. Perhaps take the cells and propagate them in a chemostat, or simply change duration of the cycle: take cells that are about to experience the 10 h phase and provide them with 14 h (and vice versa)</i>."

To eliminate the possibility that cells make compounds that modify the behavior of their relatives at a distance (quorum sensing) the experiments shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> were performed at very low cell densities (&lt;10<sup>3</sup> cells/ml), which are far below the densities at which bacterial quorum sensing occurs. We have even stronger evidence that the populations are responding to internal rather than external cues. We mixed single cells selected from the peak single cell phase and single cells selected from the peak multicellular phase, when the majority of cells are in clumps, with the two populations distinguished from each other by the expression of CFP. Examining this mixed population 10 hours later shows that the cells from single cell phase have produced substantially larger clumps than those from the multicellular phase, which produce a mixture of small and medium-sized clumps. This experiment demonstrates that cells from the different phases of the oscillator behave differently even when they share the same environment. Because the paper already has a number of complex experiments that are difficult to explain succinctly, our judgment was not to add this experiment to the revised manuscript."
