During DNA replication, nucleosomes are disrupted and re-assembled with newly synthesized histones and DNA. Despite much progress, it is still unclear why higher eukaryotes contain multiple core histone genes, how chromatin assembly is controlled, and how these processes are coordinated with cell cycle progression. We used a histone null mutation of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> to show that histone supply levels, provided by a defined number of transgenic histone genes, regulate the length of S phase during the cell cycle. Lack of de novo histone supply not only extends S phase, but also causes a cell cycle arrest during G2 phase, and thus prevents cells from entering mitosis. Our results suggest a novel cell cycle surveillance mechanism that monitors nucleosome assembly without involving the DNA repair pathways and exerts its effect via suppression of CDC25 phosphatase String expression."

During DNA replication, nucleosomes are disrupted and re-assembled with newly synthesized histones and DNA. Despite much progress, it is still unclear why higher eukaryotes contain multiple core histone genes, how chromatin assembly is controlled, and how these processes are coordinated with cell cycle progression. We used a histone null mutation of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> to show that histone supply levels, provided by a defined number of transgenic histone genes, regulate the length of S phase during the cell cycle. Lack of de novo histone supply not only extends S phase, but also causes a cell cycle arrest during G2 phase, and thus prevents cells from entering mitosis. Our results suggest a novel cell cycle surveillance mechanism that monitors nucleosome assembly without involving the DNA repair pathways and exerts its effect via suppression of CDC25 phosphatase String expression."

Apparently, the pace of DNA synthesis is tightly coupled to the assembly of newly synthesized DNA into chromatin. Multiple studies showed that the depletion of the histone chaperones Asf1 and CAF-1 results in a slow down of DNA synthesis during S phase (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hoek and Stillman, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Ye et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Nabatiyan and Krude, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Groth et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Takami et al., 2007</a>) preceding the accumulation of DNA damage in mammalian cells (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hoek and Stillman, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Ye et al., 2003</a>). Also, diminishing histone supply during S phase through knock down of SLBP, which is required for histone mRNA stability and translation, decreases the rate of DNA synthesis (<a href=\"#bib58\">Zhao et al., 2004</a>). A recent study that targeted SLBP together with FLASH, a factor that is required for histone mRNA transcription and processing (<a href=\"#bib6\">Barcaroli et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Yang et al., 2009</a>), revealed that replication fork progression depends on nucleosome assembly potentially through a mechanism based on a feedback from the histone chaperone CAF-1 to the replicative helicase and/or the unloading of PCNA from newly synthesized DNA upon nucleosome assembly (<a href=\"#bib17\">Groth et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Mejlvang et al., 2014</a>)."

However, it is still unclear whether chromatin integrity is monitored after or during DNA replication. Genome integrity during S phase is governed by the ATR/Chk1 and ATM/Chk2 checkpoint mechanisms that sense replication stress and DNA damage, respectively (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bartek and Lukas, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Cimprich and Cortez, 2008</a>). Lack of CAF-1 or Asf1 function leads to accumulation of DNA damage and activation of the ATM/Chk2 pathway (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hoek and Stillman, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Ye et al., 2003</a>). These findings led to the hypothesis that chromatin assembly is monitored indirectly through accumulation of DNA lesions in response to stalled replication forks. However, since these chaperones have multiple functions such as unwinding of DNA during replication, in DNA repair (<a href=\"#bib15\">Gaillard et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Green and Almouzni, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Sch\u00f6pf et al., 2012</a>) as well as other nuclear processes (<a href=\"#bib41\">Quivy et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Houlard et al., 2006</a>).

By reintroducing a defined number of transgenic histone genes into the histone null mutant background, we show that the rate of DNA replication is coupled to the number of histone genes present in the genome and that histone supply is critical to coordinate S phase length with the developmental program. Surprisingly, cells that completely lacked de novo histone synthesis replicate DNA at a reduced rate, but complete S phase and arrest in cell cycle without accumulating DNA damage. This cell cycle arrest is mediated by suppressing the accumulation of transcripts encoding the CDC25 phosphatase String and provides evidence for a chromatin assembly surveillance mechanism that is independent of the known S phase checkpoints."

This highly uniform phenotype is likely due to the degradation of maternal histone mRNAs during the first G2 phase of embryogenesis in cell cycle 14 (<a href=\"#bib32\">Marzluff et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">O'Farrell et al., 1989</a>) combined with the complete lack of zygotic histone gene expression during S phase of cell cycle 15 (S<sub>15</sub>) (<a href=\"#bib18\">G\u00fcnesdogan et al., 2010</a>). In order to verify that the lack of histone transcription also results in a diminished pool of histone proteins in S<sub>15</sub>, we compared the protein levels of histone H2B and H3 of wild type embryos that are in S<sub>15</sub> at 4\u20135 hr after egg laying (AEL) to sorted <i>His</i><sup><i>C</i></sup> mutant embryos that are still in S<sub>15</sub> at 5.5\u20136.5 hr AEL (see below and <a href=\"#bib18\">G\u00fcnesdogan et al., 2010</a>) by quantitative Western blotting (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>). The approximate twofold reduction in the histone levels of <i>His</i><sup><i>C</i></sup> mutant embryos is consistent with the fact that these embryos lack synthesis of new histones in S<sub>15</sub> but still contain parental histones from chromatin that was assembled during cycle 14. To test whether the reduced supply of histones in <i>His</i><sup><i>C</i></sup> mutant embryos leads to a decrease in nucleosome formation, we carried out Micrococcal Nuclease (MNase) digestion assays on chromatin from sorted <i>His</i><sup><i>C</i></sup> mutant and wild type sibling embryos (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The results show that chromatin from <i>His</i><sup><i>C</i></sup> mutant embryos is more accessible to MNase than control chromatin, leading to a more rapid generation of mononucleosomal DNA fragments and reflecting a decrease in nucleosome occupancy in chromatin of the <i>His</i><sup><i>C</i></sup> mutants."

Consistent with this, we did not observe degradation of the mitotic Cyclin A or assembly of mitotic spindles in <i>His</i><sup><i>C</i></sup> mutant cells (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). To assess DNA replication in S<sub>15</sub>, we used BrdU incorporation assays to label newly synthesized DNA (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). The results show that most cells of <i>His</i><sup><i>C</i></sup> mutant embryos entered S<sub>15</sub>, but the spatial pattern of replicating cells was different from the highly stereotyped wild type pattern (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B\u2013D</a>). In wild type embryos, about 5 hr AEL (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,E</a>), the ventral epidermal cells incorporated BrdU in S<sub>15</sub>, whereas the lateral cells entered G2<sub>15</sub> and stopped BrdU incorporation. Dorsal epidermal cells had already passed through M<sub>15</sub> and incorporated BrdU in S<sub>16</sub>. In contrast, the <i>His</i><sup><i>C</i></sup> mutant cells failed to reach G2<sub>15</sub> and the majority of the cells continued to incorporate BrdU at low levels in S<sub>15</sub> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D,F</a>). To test whether the extended S phase of <i>His</i><sup><i>C</i></sup> mutant cells is caused by a reduced rate of DNA synthesis, we shortened the BrdU labelling pulses from 15 to 5 min. In wild type cells, BrdU incorporation was detectable during S<sub>15</sub> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2I\u2013K</a>), whereas in <i>His</i><sup><i>C</i></sup> mutant cells BrdU incorporation was detected only in a few cells with low Cyclin B levels indicating that they were still in early S<sub>15</sub> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2L\u2013N</a>). Notably, in <i>His</i><sup><i>C</i></sup> mutants ventral cells showed a uniform pattern and dorsal cells a punctuate pattern of BrdU incorporation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G,H</a>), which is characteristic for the replication of euchromatin and heterochromatin in early and late S phase, respectively (<a href=\"#bib43\">Shermoen et al., 2010</a>). Although we cannot exclude that the lack of histone synthesis in <i>His</i><sup><i>C</i></sup> mutants interfered with firing of individual origins, the results suggest that both early and late replication origins are activated in <i>His</i><sup><i>C</i></sup> mutants. In conclusion, the absence of de novo histone supply reduces the rate of DNA synthesis shortly after the initiation of DNA replication, resulting in an extended S phase in mutant cells."

Thus, we asked whether S phase could be faithfully completed under diminished but constant histone supply and whether there is a direct dose dependent relation between histone synthesis and the length of S phase. We reintroduced defined numbers of histone gene units (<i>His-GUs)</i> into the genome of <i>His</i><sup><i>C</i></sup> mutant embryos. Embryos carrying either two (<i>2xHis-GU</i>) or six (<i>6xHis-GU</i>) units completed cell cycle 15 as shown by the degradation of Cyclin B in M<sub>15</sub> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>). These embryos were not rescued and they died later towards the end of embryogenesis (<a href=\"#fig3s1 fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplements 1 and 2</a>). Compared to wild type, the onset of M<sub>15</sub> was delayed in embryos with <i>2xHis-GUs</i> and <i>6xHis-GUs</i> by 2 hr and 1 hr, respectively, which was due to an extended S phase 15 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013E</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1 fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplements 1 and 2</a>). In contrast, embryos containing <i>12xHis-GUs</i> were fully rescued and entered M<sub>15</sub> at the same time as the wild type cells, that is, 4.5\u20135 hr AEL as shown previously (<a href=\"#bib18\">G\u00fcnesdogan et al., 2010</a>). These results establish that the length of S phase directly correlates with the transgene-derived de novo histone supply. In addition, our data indicate that the mechanisms adjusting replication fork movement to the available histone supply allow the completion of S phase under conditions of permanently diminished new histone supply in vivo (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>)."

Finally, we performed genetic tests using mutants of <i>loki</i> (<i>lok</i>), the <i>Drosophila</i> DNA damage checkpoint kinase <i>chk2</i> (<a href=\"#bib54\">Xu et al., 2001</a>). Homozygous <i>lok</i> mutants are viable and fertile. In contrast, <i>lok</i>, <i>His</i><sup><i>C</i></sup> double mutant embryos exhibited the <i>His</i><sup><i>C</i></sup> phenotype (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F\u2013H</a>). Hence, the cell cycle arrest in <i>His</i><sup><i>C</i></sup> mutant embryos is not mediated by the <i>chk2</i>-dependent DNA damage checkpoint pathway."

                        "text": "Mutations in the <i>Drosophila</i> ortholog of Chk1 (GRP) show developmental defects prior to cell cycle 15, excluding genetic experiments as we performed for <i>lok</i> (<a href=\"#bib14\">Fogarty et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Su et al., 1999</a>). Thus, we tested ATR/Chk1 checkpoint activation by using a phosphospecific antibody that recognizes the ATR-dependent phosphorylation of S345 in human Chk1 in response to replicative stress, for example, UV irradiation or HU treatment (<a href=\"#bib57\">Zhao and Piwnica-Worms, 2001</a>). This antibody is expected to cross-react with <i>Drosophila</i> GRP due to sequence similarity and detected a single band in Western blots (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) as well as a clear signal in immunofluorescence (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) upon HU treatment of <i>Drosophila</i> S2R+ tissue culture cells. To test whether the ATR/Chk1 checkpoint is functional in <i>His</i><sup><i>C</i></sup> mutant embryos, we irradiated embryos with UV light (254 nm, UVC), which induces replication stress and replication fork uncoupling (<a href=\"#bib10\">Byun et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Cimprich and Cortez, 2008</a>). Wild type embryos and <i>His</i><sup><i>C</i></sup> mutant embryos accumulated phosphorylated GRP protein (pGRP) in response to UVC, showing that the checkpoint response is functional in the mutant embryos (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013D</a>). Without UVC treatment <i>His</i><sup><i>C</i></sup> mutant embryos did not display elevated pGRP levels as compared to wild type (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E\u2013H</a>), which was also verified by Western blotting of extracts from sorted <i>His</i><sup><i>C</i></sup> mutant and wild type sibling embryos (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5I</a>). In addition, treatment of <i>His</i><sup><i>C</i></sup> mutant embryos with the ATR inhibitor VE-821 (<a href=\"#bib40\">Prevo et al., 2012</a>) or the Chk1 inhibitor CHIR-124 (<a href=\"#bib51\">Tse et al., 2007</a>) did not result in a release of the cell cycle arrest (<a href=\"#fig5s3 fig5s4\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplements 3 and 4</a>). In addition to DSBs, replicative stress can induce phosphorylation of H2Av (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1K\u2013P</a>), either directly by ATR dependent phosphorylation (<a href=\"#bib53\">Ward and Chen, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Joyce et al., 2011</a>) or through interconversion of single-stranded DNA generated at stalled replication forks into DSBs (<a href=\"#bib11\">Cimprich and Cortez, 2008</a>). Consistent with the notion that the DNA damage checkpoints are functional in <i>His</i><sup><i>C</i></sup> mutant embryos we found accumulation of \u03b3H2Av in UVC-treated embryos to levels well above the background levels detected in untreated <i>His</i><sup><i>C</i></sup> mutant embryos in late S<sub>15</sub> (<a href=\"#fig5s5\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). Interestingly, UVC-treated embryos were able to enter M<sub>15</sub> while displaying levels of \u03b3H2Av comparable or above to what we observed in untreated <i>His</i><sup><i>C</i></sup> mutant embryos (<a href=\"#fig5s6\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 6</a>). Taken together, these results strongly suggest that <i>His</i><sup><i>C</i></sup> mutant cells complete DNA replication in S phase without inducing significant DNA damage or replication stress and that the cell cycle arrest at the G2/M transition in <i>His</i><sup><i>C</i></sup> mutant cells is not mediated by the conventional S phase checkpoints."

In wild type, <i>string</i> mRNA accumulates during G2 phase and becomes rapidly degraded after cells exit mitosis (<a href=\"#bib12\">Edgar et al., 1994</a>). <i>string</i> transcription is highly dynamic, dictates the pattern of cell divisions during embryogenesis and is controlled by the activity of developmentally regulated transcription factors binding to <i>cis</i>-regulatory sequences spread over &gt;30 kb of the <i>string</i> locus (<a href=\"#bib12\">Edgar et al., 1994</a>). In contrast to wild type embryos which accumulate <i>string</i> mRNA in G2<sub>15</sub> cells of the dorsal epidermis, <i>His</i><sup><i>C</i></sup> mutant embryos failed to accumulate <i>string</i> in the corresponding cells although they showed normal upregulation of <i>string</i> expression in ventral epidermal cells prior to M<sub>14</sub> (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>). Given the complex developmental regulation of <i>string</i>, we asked whether <i>string</i> transcription is disturbed in <i>His</i><sup><i>C</i></sup> mutant embryos due to misregulation of key patterning genes. However, we observed normal temporal and spatial expression patterns of developmental genes such as the segmentation gene <i>engrailed</i> and the homeotic genes <i>Ultrabithorax</i> and <i>Abdominal-B</i> in <i>His</i><sup><i>C</i></sup> mutant embryos (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Hence, the developmental programme progresses normally in <i>His</i><sup><i>C</i></sup> mutant embryos up to the late embryonic stage when they eventually die (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Similar to <i>His</i><sup><i>C</i></sup> mutant embryos, <i>string</i> mRNA was not detectable in dorsal epidermal cells of <i>2xHis-GU</i> embryos during their extended S<sub>15</sub> (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). However, when wild type embryos undergo M<sub>16</sub> at 6.5\u20137 hr AEL (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D,E</a>), <i>His</i><sup><i>C</i></sup> mutant embryos still failed to express <i>string</i> (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F,G</a>) but <i>2xHis-GU</i> embryos upregulated <i>string</i> expression (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6H,I</a>). This result suggests that the failure of <i>His</i><sup><i>C</i></sup> mutant embryos to upregulate <i>string</i> after they finished replication in S<sub>15</sub> is not simply a consequence of their extended S phase but rather due to a surveillance mechanism that blocks the G2/M transition because chromatin assembly is not completed. It is interesting to note that the pattern of M<sub>15</sub> in <i>2xHis-GU</i> embryos closely resembled the pattern of M<sub>16</sub> in wild type embryos (<a href=\"#bib18\">G\u00fcnesdogan et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D,H</a>). This observation provides further support that the developmental programme of these embryos can progress normally, as <i>string</i> mRNA expression readjusts once DNA replication is completed. Thus, sufficient histone supply, as provided by multiple copies of <i>His-GUs</i>, is critical to the coordination of the developmental and cell division programmes during wild type embryogenesis of <i>Drosophila</i>. The results also explain why higher eukaryotes, which undergo rapid mitotic cell divisions during embryonic development, contain multiple <i>His-GUs</i> in their genomes."

To test this hypothesis, <i>His</i><sup><i>C</i></sup> mutant embryos were forced to express <i>string</i> in a striped pattern under the control of the <i>prd-GAL4</i> driver using the GAL4/UAS system (<a href=\"#bib9\">Brand and Perrimon, 1993</a>), which was visualised by coexpression of a <i>UAS-EYFP</i> transgene. The <i>string</i> expressing <i>His</i><sup><i>C</i></sup> mutant cells entered M<sub>15</sub>, degraded Cyclin B and reaccumulated Cyclin B after mitosis, whereas cells lacking <i>string</i> expression remained arrested (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6J\u2013P</a>). Mitotic progression in wild type embryos follows a stereotyped pattern characterized by (i) Cyclin B degradation and sister chromatid separation at the metaphase to anaphase transition, (ii) spindle elongation at the transition from anaphase-a into anaphase-b, (iii) the onset of chromatin decondensation in telophase, and eventually by (iv) cytokinesis (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6Q</a>). The <i>string</i>-induced mitosis in <i>His</i><sup><i>C</i></sup> mutant embryos was normal up to the metaphase to anaphase transition. During anaphase-b and telophase, however, we observed lagging chromosomes or chromatin bridges in almost all of the cells (95.8%, n = 24). These bridges were eventually resolved during cytokinesis, and the cells entered into interphase of cell cycle 16 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6Q</a>). Together, these data indicate that <i>string</i> transcription is indeed the limiting downstream factor that restricts cell cycle progression in the absence of de novo histone synthesis. In summary, our study shows that DNA replication and histone availability are tightly coupled. Lack of de novo histone synthesis causes a <i>string</i>-dependent cell cycle arrest in G2 phase, suggesting a novel chromatin assembly checkpoint monitoring chromatin integrity."

In addition to canonical histones, eukaryotes express histone variants that can replace canonical histones in a specific genomic context (<a href=\"#bib5\">Banaszynski et al., 2010</a>). Our results show that these histone variants do not compensate for the lack of canonical histone synthesis with regard to chromatin assembly and cell cycle progression. This could be due to insufficient expression of variant histones from their endogenous promoters as it has been shown for the variant histone H3.3, which can fully replace its canonical counterpart, histone H3, but only if it is expressed from within a histone gene unit like the canonical histone (<a href=\"#bib19\">H\u00f6dl and Basler, 2012</a>).

Our data illustrate that an extension of the S phase duration caused by diminished histone supply allows a faithful completion of S phase and transition from G2 into M phase of the cell cycle. This S phase extension is likely to be caused by a direct effect of lowered histone availability on replication fork progression (<a href=\"#bib17\">Groth et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Mejlvang et al., 2014</a>) and not by a lack of origin firing, although we cannot exclude this possibility completely.

This observation is in contrast to previous studies on CAF-1, which found that cells arrest in S phase and accumulate DNA damage (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hoek and Stillman, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Ye et al., 2003</a>). This discrepancy might in part be explained by the fact that histone chaperones also have a direct function in DNA repair (<a href=\"#bib42\">Sch\u00f6pf et al., 2012</a>); and thus, in the presence of an intact DNA repair/chromatin assembly machinery in <i>His</i><sup><i>C</i></sup> mutants, DNA is replicated without the accumulation of damage, even when histone supply is restricted to the parental load of histones. Alternatively, the accumulation of DNA damage in histone chaperone-depleted cells might be the consequence of a prolonged replication slow down, since it was shown that neither ATM/Chk2 nor ATR/Chk1 are activated as an immediate consequence of histone deprivation but only after prolonged incubation times (&gt;48 hr) (<a href=\"#bib33\">Mejlvang et al., 2014</a>). Based on our DNA quantification experiments, we found that the bulk of DNA replication in <i>His</i><sup><i>C</i></sup> mutants is completed by about 2 hr after entry into S phase, which might differ from the timeframe required to develop significant DNA damage. Interestingly, we find that <i>His</i><sup><i>C</i></sup> mutant cells become TUNEL positive by about 6 hr after they enter S phase 15, which might reflect secondary DNA damage and/or cell death. Nevertheless, we found a moderate increase of \u03b3H2Av staining during late S phase in <i>His</i><sup><i>C</i></sup> mutant embryos. Our data indicate, however, that cells that resolved UVC-induced DNA damage, and therefore entered mitosis can do so with levels of \u03b3H2Av comparable to those we observe in <i>His</i><sup><i>C</i></sup> mutants. Thus, it is plausible that the slight increase in \u03b3H2Av in <i>His</i><sup><i>C</i></sup> mutants could result from incomplete turnover of \u03b3H2Av rather than directly reflect DNA damage that could activate the S phase checkpoints. Turnover of \u03b3H2Av was shown to require the Tip60 chromatin-remodelling complex (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kusch et al., 2004</a>), which may be affected by the altered chromatin structure in <i>His</i><sup><i>C</i></sup> mutants.

In contrast, we find that <i>His</i><sup><i>C</i></sup> mutant cells fail to accumulate <i>string</i> transcripts when arrested in G2. This finding was surprising since it was shown that the temporal and spatial expression pattern of <i>string</i> is essentially unchanged in embryos that are arrested in G2 by mutations in <i>string</i> or in mitotic Cyclins (<a href=\"#bib12\">Edgar et al., 1994</a>). Thus, this difference is likely due to the failure of <i>His</i><sup><i>C</i></sup> mutant embryos to assemble chromatin, resulting in a diminished nucleosome density as shown by the presence of excess MNase hypersensitive DNA. Although we cannot rule out that the lower abundance of histone proteins itself directly contributes to the G2 arrest, this possibility seems unlikely since histone levels rapidly decrease in G2 cells where the chromatin assembly surveillance should act (<a href=\"#bib32\">Marzluff et al., 2008</a>). It remains unclear how the presence of unassembled chromatin is linked to the regulation of <i>string</i>, but the effect is specific, since <i>string</i> transcript accumulation is the only limiting factor to overcome the G2 arrest in <i>His</i><sup><i>C</i></sup>-mutant embryos. The subsequent mitosis in <i>His</i><sup><i>C</i></sup> mutants is completed and cells enter into the next cell cycle. Given that <i>His</i><sup><i>C</i></sup> mutant cells enter mitosis with presumably about half of the nucleosomes present in wild type chromatin, the mitotic defects like lagging anaphase chromosomes appear surprisingly mild. These defects could reflect problems in loading of structural components that are required for chromosome condensation and sister chromatid cohesion, like Cohesins and Condensins, which are proposed to require contact to chromatin rather than naked DNA (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bernard et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Nonaka et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Tada et al., 2011</a>)."

Thus, these results indicate that nucleosome density is indeed affected in <i>His</i><sup><i>C</i></sup> mutant cells as reflected in an increased MNase sensitivity.

To show this, we performed quantitative Western blotting for histone H2B and H3, respectively, using protein lysates from sorted <i>His</i><sup><i>C</i></sup> mutant and wild type embryos. The results show that the histone protein content is about two-fold reduced in <i>His</i><sup><i>C</i></sup> mutant embryos.

Thus, one cannot perform experiments to test the involvement of ATR/Chk1 in the cell cycle arrest observed in <i>His</i><sup><i>C</i></sup> mutant embryos by genetic means. As an alternative approach, we performed an immunofluorescence analysis using a phosphospecific antibody that detects phosphorylated and activated GRP protein. Irradiation of <i>His</i><sup><i>C</i></sup> mutant embryos and wild type sibling embryos with UV light, known to induce stress-dependent replication effects, showed detectable levels of phosphorylated GRP. Thus, the ATR/Chk1 checkpoint must be still functional in <i>His</i><sup><i>C</i></sup> mutant embryos. However, untreated <i>His</i><sup><i>C</i></sup> mutant embryos did not exhibit detectable levels of pGRP, which we confirmed by Western blot analysis. As suggested by the reviewers, we also treated <i>His</i><sup><i>C</i></sup> mutant embryos with an ATR inhibitor (VE-821) and Chk1 inhibitor (CHIR-124), respectively, which did not result in a release of the cell cycle arrest in <i>His</i><sup><i>C</i></sup> mutant embryos. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that the lack of <i>de novo</i> histone supply does not induce replication stress thereby inducing the ATR/Chk1 checkpoint.

We have now carefully documented the mitotic progression in <i>His</i><sup><i>C</i></sup> mutant cells upon expression of <i>string</i> and we found only minor mitotic defects.
