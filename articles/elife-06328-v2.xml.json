For example, the functions of membrane arachidonate that are independent of a precursor role for eicosanoid synthesis remain largely unknown. Here, we show that the lack of lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 3 (LPCAT3) leads to drastic reductions in membrane arachidonate levels, and that LPCAT3-deficient mice are neonatally lethal due to an extensive triacylglycerol (TG) accumulation and dysfunction in enterocytes. We found that high levels of PUFAs in membranes enable TGs to locally cluster in high density, and that this clustering promotes efficient TG transfer. We propose a model of local arachidonate enrichment by LPCAT3 to generate a distinct pool of TG in membranes, which is required for normal directionality of TG transfer and lipoprotein assembly in the liver and enterocytes."

For example, the functions of membrane arachidonate that are independent of a precursor role for eicosanoid synthesis remain largely unknown. Here, we show that the lack of lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 3 (LPCAT3) leads to drastic reductions in membrane arachidonate levels, and that LPCAT3-deficient mice are neonatally lethal due to an extensive triacylglycerol (TG) accumulation and dysfunction in enterocytes. We found that high levels of PUFAs in membranes enable TGs to locally cluster in high density, and that this clustering promotes efficient TG transfer. We propose a model of local arachidonate enrichment by LPCAT3 to generate a distinct pool of TG in membranes, which is required for normal directionality of TG transfer and lipoprotein assembly in the liver and enterocytes."

The next challenge will be to find out if LPCAT3 is also important for the production of lipoproteins in humans. If it is, then developing new therapies that alter the activity of this enzyme might be beneficial for patients with abnormal levels of lipids in the blood (known as dyslipidemia)."

They are related to cardiovascular diseases, neuronal functions, metabolic syndromes, and many other pathophysiological events (<a href=\"#bib40\">Poudyal et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Baum et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Jiao et al., 2014</a>). Phospholipids containing PUFAs render the membrane more flexible, which reduces the energy required for deformation (<a href=\"#bib42\">Rawicz et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Pinot et al., 2014</a>). Although PUFAs in phospholipids affect membrane physical properties, the biological significance related to these different properties remain unclear. A recent elegant study showed that PUFAs in phospholipids facilitate endocytosis by reducing the energy required for membrane deformation and fission (<a href=\"#bib39\">Pinot et al., 2014</a>). However, the requirement for PUFAs in other biological processes accompanying membrane deformation has to be demonstrated."

The functions of membrane arachidonate that are not related to eicosanoid synthesis remain largely unknown. We reported previously that arachidonate in membrane phosphatidylcholine (PC) suppresses Akt signaling in cultured cells (<a href=\"#bib25\">Koeberle et al., 2013</a>), but it is unknown whether this occurs in vivo. Studies of mice lacking lysophosphatidylinositol acyltransferase 1 revealed that a decrease in phosphatidylinositol (PI) arachidonate has deleterious effects in neuronal development, probably related to PI poly-phosphate dysfunction (<a href=\"#bib28\">Lee et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Anderson et al., 2013</a>). However, the in vivo functions of arachidonate in the most abundant membrane phospholipids such as PC and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), as well as its effect on membrane physical properties, remained to be solved."

Pioneering studies suggested that arachidonate is incorporated into phospholipids after de novo synthesis during the remodeling pathway (also termed Lands' cycle), which consists of a phospholipid deacylation\u2013reacylation cycle (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hill and Lands, 1968</a>). The reacylation is catalyzed by lysophospholipid acyltransferases (LPLATs) (<a href=\"#bib19\">Hishikawa et al., 2014</a>), among which lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 3 (LPCAT3) is the strongest candidate to incorporate arachidonate into membranes, due to its substrate selectivity in vitro (<a href=\"#bib15\">Gij\u00f3n et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Hishikawa et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Matsuda et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Zhao et al., 2008</a>). Indeed, knockdown of LPCAT3 by RNA interference reduced the levels of several arachidonate-containing PC species, but additional PUFA-containing PC species were differently affected between studies (<a href=\"#bib18\">Hishikawa et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Li et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Rong et al., 2013</a>). Therefore, it remains unclear whether LPCAT3 is specific for the regulation of arachidonate, or it has a broader impact on membrane PUFA levels. In addition, the biological functions of LPCAT3 and membrane arachidonate remain to be fully established, since residual activity of LPCAT3 might affect the overall results in RNA interference experiments."

                        "text": "Since PUFAs affect the bending rigidity of the membrane, it is possible that the regulation of phospholipid arachidonate has effects on membrane shape change. When triglycerides (TGs) are synthesized by diacylglycerol acyltransferases, they accumulate between the two leaflets of the lipid bilayer and deform the membrane (<a href=\"#bib61\">Yen et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Thiam et al., 2013</a>). Molecular dynamics simulation showed that TGs between leaflets generate a \u2018blister-like\u2019 shape, where the membrane on its surface is highly curved (<a href=\"#bib22\">Khandelia et al., 2010</a>). Therefore, the ability of the membrane to form curved structures might affect the properties of the TG pool between the leaflets. This pool serves as a precursor for cytosolic lipid droplets in most cells (<a href=\"#bib53\">Thiam et al., 2013</a>). In hepatocytes and enterocytes, this pool is also used for transport by microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen to generate lipoproteins and luminal lipid droplets (<a href=\"#bib51\">Sturley and Hussain, 2012</a>). MTP transfers TGs to nascent apolipoprotein B (apoB) to form primordial lipoproteins (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abumrad and Davidson, 2012</a>). MTP also transfers TGs to generate apoB-free lipid droplets in the ER lumen (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kulinski et al., 2002</a>), which are required for TG enrichment in nascent lipoproteins. MTP deficiency in humans leads to an impaired absorption of dietary lipids, which is called abetalipoproteinemia (<a href=\"#bib58\">Wetterau et al., 1992</a>). Therefore, the normal luminal transfer of TG is critical in vivo, but factor(s) and environment enabling an efficient transport by MTP remain poorly understood (<a href=\"#bib60\">Yao et al., 2013</a>)."

In addition, we show that LPCAT3 regulates the directionality of TG transfer into lipoproteins, preventing the over-accumulation of cytosolic lipid droplets in hepatocytes and enterocytes. Additional analyses suggest that membrane PUFAs facilitate TG local clustering, which enables efficient transport by MTP. This study identifies LPCAT3 as a major regulator of membrane phospholipid arachidonate, which is a critical factor affecting luminal TG transport."

We first examined whether LPCAT3 regulates the acyl-chain composition of the major phospholipid PC. We established rat hepatoma RH 7777 cells that stably overexpress FLAG-tagged murine LPCAT3 (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Control cells had an LPCAT activity selective for linoleoyl- and arachidonoyl-CoA (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>). The overexpression of LPCAT3 doubled LPCAT activity without affecting acyl-CoA selectivity (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>). The acyl-chain composition of PC in LPCAT3-overexpressing cells was analyzed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Chromatograms of 38:4 PC (PC species containing 38 carbons and four double bonds as a sum of the two acyl-chains) revealed two isomers with different retention times (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). The levels of 36:4 PC and the later-eluting isomer of 38:4 PC, but not 34:2 PC, were increased in LPCAT3-overexpressing cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Additional selected reaction monitoring (SRM, see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 for detail) analyses were performed to resolve the two acyl-chains, and showed that 34:2 PC, 36:4 PC, and the later-eluting isomer (peak 2) of 38:4 PC correspond to 16:0\u201318:2 PC, 16:0\u201320:4 PC, and 18:0\u201320:4 PC, respectively (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a> and data not shown).

We first examined the expression pattern of LPCAT3 at the late embryonic stages (between embryonic days 18.5 (E18.5) and E19.5). LPCAT3 mRNA was ubiquitously detected, with high expression in intestine, followed by liver (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), consistent with the protein level (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Intestinal LPCAT3 mRNA expression was strongly induced during the late developmental stages, while the changes in the liver were relatively small (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). To examine intestinal LPCAT3 expression more in detail, we divided the whole intestine into three parts: the proximal small intestine, where lipid absorption is high (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abumrad and Davidson, 2012</a>), distal small intestine, and colon (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). LPCAT3 expression was highest in the proximal small intestine (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E,F</a>). Enzymatic assays revealed that LPCAT activity is highly correlated with LPCAT3 expression (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,F,G</a>). We generated LPCAT3-deficient mice by gene targeting and confirmed the loss of protein expression (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013C</a>).

                                "text": "We next analyzed how LPCAT3 deficiency affects the lipidome in mice at E18.5\u2013E19.5. We measured tissue PC levels and found a slight reduction in the proximal small intestine of LPCAT3-deficient mice, but not in other tissues (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Next, we analyzed the changes in acyl-chain composition of phospholipids from tissues of LPCAT3-deficient mice. LC-SRM-MS lipidomics analysis of four phospholipid classes (PC, PE, phosphatidylserine (PS), and PI) was carried out. The total of signals from all the detected molecules were comparable between genotypes, and were used for normalization (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The slight reduction in the proximal small intestine of LPCAT3-deficient mice was consistent with the reduced PC amount (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). To detect the global differences in PC, we analyzed the ratio (as % of wild type) for each PC species in individual tissues, and then averaged the ratio values from all tissues (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). This analysis enabled us to detect the most common changes that occur under LPCAT3 deficiency. The most decreased species were 34:4 PC, 36:4 PC, 36:5 PC, and 38:4 PC (shown in green in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>), suggesting that the reduction in arachidonate levels is most prominent. These decreases occurred in almost all tissues analyzed (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C\u2013E</a>). The changes in species that might contain linoleate (34:2 PC and 36:2 PC) were small or absent (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). On the other hand, the most increased PC species were 40:4 PC, 40:5 PC, 42:4 PC, and 42:5 PC (shown in magenta in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>), which might contain fatty acids that arise from arachidonate metabolism (carbon chain elongation, desaturation, and partial \u03b2-oxidation [<a href=\"#bib44\">Schmitz and Ecker, 2008</a>] [<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,F,G</a>]). To investigate the acyl-chain composition of the changed PC species (34:4 PC, 36:4 PC, 36:5 PC, 38:4 PC, 40:4 PC, 40:5 PC, 42:4 PC, and 42:5 PC), we performed SRM analyses of PC from the proximal small intestine, using transitions that discriminate fatty acids (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Each PC subspecies did not have a single acyl-chain composition, but was a mixture of various combinations. Interestingly, most of arachidonate-containing species were decreased in LPCAT3-deficient mice, as well as some species containing C18 PUFAs (C18:2 and C18:3) and other C20 PUFAs (C20:3 and C20:5). On the other hand, PC species containing C22 PUFAs (C22:4 and C22:5) and C24 PUFAs (C24:4 and C24:5) were increased, suggesting that the excess of arachidonoyl-CoA caused by LPCAT3 deficiency increases its metabolism (such as elongation) into C22 and C24 PUFAs, which were then incorporated into PC (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) (<a href=\"#bib44\">Schmitz and Ecker, 2008</a>). In addition to the changes in PC, we found that lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) levels are increased in the proximal small intestine, distal small intestine, and liver of LPCAT3-deficient mice (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H</a>)."

This is consistent with the LPEAT activity of LPCAT3 with arachidonate preference (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E,F</a>).

Fatty acids were detected as methyl esters derivatized from total lipids (including free fatty acids, neutral lipids, and phospholipids). The total amounts of fatty acids were slightly decreased in proximal small intestine of LPCAT3-deficient mice, as expected from the reduced PC amount (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Unexpectedly, they increased in liver of LPCAT3-deficient mice (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). GC-FID confirmed that arachidonate levels are reduced in all tissues of LPCAT3-deficient mice (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Linoleate levels were decreased only in some tissues (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>), showing that the changes seen in proximal small intestine PC (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>) are not universal, consistently with <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>. We observed increased docosahexaenoate levels, but only in some tissues (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Instead, adrenate (C22:4 n-6) and docosapentaenoate (C22:5 n-6) levels were increased in almost all tissues, confirming that the excess of arachidonoyl-CoA caused by LPCAT3 deficiency increases its use for further metabolism, as has been suggested by the results of LC-MS (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D,E</a>, and <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). C24 PUFAs could not be analyzed under the GC-FID condition used. Due to these increases, the total amounts of PUFAs that have four or more double bonds were only slightly affected in LPCAT3-deficient mice (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>)."

Although they looked indistinguishable from control mice at birth and had normal suckling (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>) and breathing, they did not gain weight and became smaller than wild type mice during the first days (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C,D</a>). LPCAT3-deficient mice had normal blood glucose levels at birth (at postnatal day (P)0.5), but became severely hypoglycemic at P1.5 (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E,F</a>). Hypoglycemia was not due to hyperinsulinemia or an insufficient hepatic glycogenolysis (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013D</a>). Histological analysis of multiple tissues from mice at P1.5 was performed, and the most significant difference between wild type and LPCAT3-deficient mice was seen in the small intestine. The proximal small intestine of LPCAT3-deficient mice had a \u2018vacuolated\u2019 appearance (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A,B</a>). Oil red O staining revealed that neutral lipids are normally transported in wild type mice, while they drastically accumulate in intestinal epithelial cells of LPCAT3-deficient mice (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C,D</a>). Massive lipid droplet accumulation was confirmed by electron microscopy (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9E\u2013H</a>). In addition to lipid droplet accumulation, enterocytes of LPCAT3-deficient mice were severely damaged, as judged from the loss of microvilli and deformed mitochondria (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9G,H</a>). Therefore, this severe damage probably caused a malabsorption of nutrients leading to hypoglycemia. On the other hand, although the arachidonate content was decreased in phospholipids of the small intestine from LPCAT3-deficient embryos at E18.5\u2013E19.5 (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9I</a>), their histological appearance was normal (data not shown). Therefore, the intestinal damages in LPCAT3-deficient mice develop postnatally, most likely due to the epithelial accumulation of lipids from breast milk intake soon after birth."

In the proximal small intestine, TG levels were high due to the massive absorption of lipids at this region, but tended to be increased in LPCAT3-deficient mice (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9J</a>). On the other hand, cholesterol did not accumulate in LPCAT3-deficient mice at this region (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9K</a>). In addition, we found an increase in TG and cholesterol levels in distal small intestine of LPCAT3-deficient mice at P1.5 (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9J,K</a>). Oil red O staining revealed that this region compensatorily absorbs lipids in LPCAT3-deficient mice (<a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>), probably due to the inability to absorb them at the proximal small intestine. Similarly to the case of the embryonic liver, the accumulation of lipid droplets was not due to MTP deficiency, since the protein levels of MTP and PDI in proximal small intestine were normal in LPCAT3-deficient mice at E18.5\u2013E19.5 (<a href=\"#fig9s2\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 2A,B</a>).

                                "text": "Enterocytes and hepatocytes with lipid droplet accumulation secrete neutral lipids into plasma as apoB-containing lipoproteins (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abumrad and Davidson, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Sturley and Hussain, 2012</a>). Although lipoproteins were detected by electron microscopy (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2C</a> and <a href=\"#fig9s2\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>), their composition might be altered. Therefore, we analyzed plasma lipids at various stages. We found that TG levels, but not apoB, cholesterol, or PC levels, are significantly decreased in plasma of LPCAT3-deficient mice at E18.5\u2013E19.5 (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10A\u2013D</a>). Plasma lipids were further analyzed by gel filtration chromatography. TGs are usually detected in chylomicron or VLDL fractions in adult plasma. However, in our samples, the elution profiles of both TGs and cholesterol suggested an association with particles of an intermediate size between VLDL, intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (<a href=\"#fig10s1\">Figure 10\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013H</a>). This is consistent with the elution profiles in previous studies (<a href=\"#bib55\">van Straten et al., 2009</a>), and thus is a characteristic of this neonatal period. Therefore, we will regard this \u2018VLDL/IDL/LDL\u2019 fraction as the lipoproteins secreted from the liver. TGs in the VLDL/IDL/LDL fraction decreased in LPCAT3-deficient mice at all periods analyzed (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10E</a> and <a href=\"#fig10s1\">Figure 10\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013D</a>). In contrast, cholesterol levels were not decreased (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10F</a> and <a href=\"#fig10s1\">Figure 10\u2014figure supplement 1E\u2013H</a>). After P0.4, TGs and cholesterol were detected in the chylomicron fractions (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10G,H</a>, and <a href=\"#fig10s1\">Figure 10\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013H</a>). Chylomicron TG levels were normal in LPCAT3-deficient mice at P0.4, but tended to be decreased at later periods (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10G</a> and <a href=\"#fig10s1\">Figure 10\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013D</a>). Since the chylomicron lipid levels vary largely due to the difficulty to synchronize suckling behaviors, the differences did not reach statistical significance. Chylomicron cholesterol levels were not largely affected in LPCAT3-deficient mice at all periods examined (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10H</a> and <a href=\"#fig10s1\">Figure 10\u2014figure supplement 1E\u2013H</a>). Therefore, a reduction in TGs, but not in cholesterol, was observed commonly in lipoproteins secreted from both liver and small intestine. Based on this observation, we calculated the ratio between TGs and cholesterol in chylomicron and VLDL/IDL/LDL fractions at different time points (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10I,J</a>). In the chylomicron fraction, the TG/cholesterol ratio increased gradually after birth in wild type, but remained constant after P0.4 in LPCAT3-deficient mice (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10I</a>). A similar trend was observed in the VLDL/IDL/LDL fraction (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10J</a>).

When present at a high concentration in a limited space, the fluorescence of the fluorophore 7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazole (NBD) decreases due to its self-quenching property (<a href=\"#bib8\">Brown et al., 1994</a>). Therefore, the quenching of NBD-labeled TG (NBD-TG) in PC liposomes was measured to analyze the local clustering between leaflets (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11A</a>). The total fluorescence (without quenching) was measured by disassembling liposomes in isopropanol (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11A,B</a>). In the absence of PC, we did not observe NBD-TG fluorescence in the samples, showing that free NBD-TG is lost during liposome preparation (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11B</a>). To prepare liposomes, we used egg PC, which contains only a slight amount of PUFAs (<a href=\"#fig11s2\">Figure 11\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), or egg PC supplemented with 30% of synthetic PC containing palmitate at the <i>sn-</i>1 position, and oleate, linoleate, arachidonate, or docosahexaenoate at the <i>sn-</i>2 position. We calculated the self-quenching of NBD-TG from the fluorescence of liposomes in buffer or isopropanol (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11B</a>), and found that a membrane rich in PUFAs such as arachidonate or docosahexaenoate increases quenching (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11C</a>), equivalent to local TG clustering."

                                "text": "In this study, we first analyzed in detail how LPCAT3 affects LPLAT activity and lipid composition. Although multiple LPLATs have been identified (<a href=\"#bib19\">Hishikawa et al., 2014</a>), we found that LPCAT3-deficient mice lack most of the activity required for the remodeling of PC, PE, and possibly PS (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2G, 4F</a>, and data not shown). The remodeling pathway has been thought to modify the acyl-chain composition of phospholipids synthesized de novo and to be especially important for PUFA accumulation (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hill and Lands, 1968</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">MacDonald and Sprecher, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Lands, 2000</a>). Analyses of LPCAT3-deficient mice revealed complex changes in the lipidome, but among the major fatty acids, the most commonly decreased one was arachidonate (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3\u20135</a>). Our results show that the remodeling by LPCAT3 is highly selective for arachidonate accumulation and that many PUFA species persist in membranes of LPCAT3-deficient mice (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3\u20135</a>). Therefore, the remodeling by LPCAT3 does indeed modulate the acyl-chain composition of de novo synthesized phospholipids, but is not completely requisite for PUFA accumulation. The observation that C22 and C24 n-6 PUFAs that arose after arachidonate elongation accumulate in LPCAT3-deficient mice (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) shows that this enzyme utilizes arachidonoyl-CoA competitively with other enzymes. C22 n-6 PUFAs increased not only in phospholipids but also in neutral lipids (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). Since TG and phospholipids share phosphatidic acid as the same precursor (<a href=\"#bib10\">Coleman and Lee, 2004</a>), this suggests that in LPCAT3-deficient mice, the C22 n-6 PUFA-CoAs are utilized by LPAATs during de novo synthesis, together with one part of the excess of arachidonoyl-CoA (<a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12</a>). The unchanged docosahexaenoate in neutral lipid fractions (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>) suggests that its increase in phospholipids (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>) is not due to an accumulation by LPAATs, but rather suggests that docosahexaenoate-containing phospholipids were not utilized for acyl-chain remodeling in LPCAT3-deficient mice. Therefore, we propose that the increased n-6 C22 PUFAs and C24 PUFAs in phospholipids of LPCAT3-deficient mice are due to increased incorporation during de novo synthesis (<a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12</a>), although we cannot exclude the possibility that unknown LPCAT enzymes selective for these PUFAs exist. In addition to the changes in phospholipid acyl-chain composition, LPCAT3 deficiency induced changes in LPC (in liver and small intestine) or total PC (in proximal small intestine) levels, but only in tissues where LPCAT3 expression is high (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2B, 3A,H</a>). LPCAT3 deficiency might have caused a pronounced imbalance between LPC and PC in these tissues."

Therefore, the fatty acid profile of neutral lipids is suggestive of incorporation during de novo synthesis of both TG and phospholipids, assuming that TG has a negligible degree of acyl-chain remodeling.

(<b>A</b>) In wild type mice, arachidonoyl-CoA is largely utilized by LPCAT3 to be incorporated into phospholipids. (<b>B</b>) In LPCAT3-deficient mice, an excess of arachidonoyl-CoA occurs, which is utilized by LPAATs for de novo synthesis of both phospholipids and triglycerides, either directly or after being metabolized into C22 and C24 n-6 PUFAs (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

Even in tissues such as the brain and heart, where LPCAT3 expression is relatively small, arachidonate levels were prominently reduced in LPCAT3-deficient mice. Therefore, LPCAT3 is required for accumulating arachidonate, but the expression level of this enzyme is not the single factor to explain different arachidonate levels in tissues. Rather, the different levels should be explained by both LPCAT3 activity and supply of arachidonoyl-CoA, suggesting that tissue arachidonate levels are regulated in the remodeling pathway with dependence on substrate supply, as we recently proposed (<a href=\"#bib16\">Harayama et al., 2014</a>). In addition, the observation that eicosanoids are unchanged in LPCAT3-deficient mice (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>) suggests that the phenotypes of LPCAT3-deficient mice are unrelated to these lipid mediators. Therefore, analyses of LPCAT3-deficient mice revealed novel functions of membrane arachidonate that are not attributed to eicosanoids. In the future, it is of interest to determine eicosanoid levels in stimulated cells, where phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> is activated (<a href=\"#bib45\">Shimizu, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Dennis et al., 2011</a>).

LPCAT3-deficient mice display similar lethality and enterocyte lipid accumulation, and have less TGs in plasma lipoproteins (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figures 8\u201310</a>). Therefore, we attribute the lethality of LPCAT3-deficient mice to the intestinal lipotoxicity caused by the intake of large amounts of milk TG under MTP inefficiency. Indeed, enterocyte damage was obvious in LPCAT3-deficient mice, and probably resulted in an inability to absorb nutrients, not limited to sugars and lipids. One difference between LPCAT3-deficient mice and MTP-deficient mice is that the former assemble cholesterol normally in lipoproteins (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10F,H</a>). This suggests that LPCAT3 deficiency does not directly inhibit MTP, but may affect the properties of the MTP substrate TG. The quenching assay supports this, and one of these properties is the clustering of TG between leaflets (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11C</a>). It is of note that TG absorption is normal in LPCAT3-deficient mice at P0.4 (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10G</a>). This suggests that the difference in transport efficiency is apparent only when TGs are in high amounts and require to be densely clustered in the membrane for efficient transport. Therefore, it is possible that cholesterol absorption is also affected when feeding a high cholesterol diet."

In a previous report, LPCAT3 knockdown did not impair TG transport, but rather increased VLDL secretion by the liver, due to the induction of MTP caused by increased LPC (<a href=\"#bib29\">Li et al., 2012</a>). Despite this opposite result, the changes in the lipidome had similarities; LPC increased and arachidonate-containing PC decreased (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>) (<a href=\"#bib29\">Li et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Rong et al., 2013</a>). Therefore, these similar changes cannot explain the impaired TG transport in LPCAT3-deficient mice. LPCAT3 is ideal to generate a local high PUFA concentration, since the enzyme is very selective for linoleoyl- and arachidonoyl-CoA (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1B, 13A,B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib18\">Hishikawa et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Zhao et al., 2008</a>). On the other hand, the enzyme catalyzing the last step of PC de novo synthesis, diacylglycerol cholinephosphotransferase (CPT) is not selective for diacylglycerol species containing PUFA (<a href=\"#bib31\">Mantel et al., 1993</a>), and thus is unable to do the same (<a href=\"#fig13\">Figure 13C</a>). Therefore, local PUFA-rich domains arise continuously around LPCAT3 in wild type mice, but not in LPCAT3-deficient mice (<a href=\"#fig13\">Figure 13A</a>). Residual LPCAT3 in knockdown experiments might be sufficient for this local PUFA enrichment. The results of <a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11</a> suggest that if TG synthesis by diacylglycerol acyltransferases occurs in proximity of a local PUFA-rich domain, TG clustering will occur, providing a pool for efficient transport by MTP (<a href=\"#fig13\">Figure 13B</a>). Although further studies are required for a complete understanding, the different results between the LPCAT3 knockdown study (<a href=\"#bib29\">Li et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Rong et al., 2013</a>) and our present study might be due to the ability to accumulate PUFAs locally. The observation that not only arachidonate but also docosahexaenoate promote TG clustering and transfer, as well as the fact that total PUFA levels are not largely changed in LPCAT3-deficient mice, again suggest the necessity of considering a local high concentration. In the presence of LPCAT3, PUFAs might be unevenly distributed in the membrane, and this should be required to reach a sufficient high PUFA concentration for efficient TG clustering and transfer. Therefore, although docosahexaenoate can substitute arachidonate in in vitro TG transfer assays, its inability to be locally concentrated by LPCAT3 make this fatty acid incompetent for lipoprotein assembly."

These enzymes induce double bonds at different steps of PUFA generation, and mice lacking either gene encoding them could not synthesize arachidonate from linoleate. Knockout mice of both FADS1 and FADS2 have been generated, and displayed multiple abnormalities such as lethality, decreased intestinal crypt proliferation, and sterility (<a href=\"#bib49\">Stoffel et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Stroud et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Fan et al., 2012</a>). However, the accumulation of intestinal lipid droplets was not reported. It is possible that these mice might receive enough arachidonate from breast milk during the lactating period, making it difficult to analyze intestinal arachidonate functions at the perinatal period. Indeed, most studies report abnormalities of FADS1/2-deficient mice after weaning. We speculate that LPCAT3 is required for intestinal TG absorption especially when TG levels in food are high, as is the case in milk. Therefore, it is intriguing to observe phenotypes by feeding these mice with high-fat diet. It is of note that lipid droplet accumulation in the liver is seen in FADS2-deficient mice, and that arachidonate feeding reverses this phenotype (<a href=\"#bib48\">Stoffel et al., 2014</a>), which may fit with our proposed model. It will be important to compare these different models in detail to unveil more functions of membrane PUFAs in future studies."

Previously, the functions of membrane arachidonate that are not related to eicosanoids were largely unknown. In addition, the mechanism and factors that enable MTP to efficiently transfer TGs unidirectionally into the ER lumen were poorly understood. Our study reveals for the first time that membrane arachidonate and TG clustering are critical factors to regulate the correct luminal directionality of TG transport, which has lethal consequences when improperly regulated. Therefore, the present study identifies LPCAT3 as a novel key molecule involved in normal lipoprotein assembly. During the final editing of the revised manuscript, Rong et al. reported LPCAT3-deficient mice with similar conclusions. In the future, conditional ablation of LPCAT3 in different contexts will reveal other functions of arachidonate in phospholipids and will provide further critical insights into membrane biology."

For lipid analysis, cells were cultured for 24 hr in the presence of 10 \u03bcM each of linoleate, arachidonate, and docosahexaenoate (Cayman Chemical Company, Ann Arbor, MI) to make the changes in PUFA-containing PC more easily distinguished (although most of the changes reported in the manuscript can be seen without this supplementation). Lipofectamine 3000 (Life Technologies) was used for transfection. For the establishment of stable transfectants, cells were selected in 2 mg/ml G418 (Life Technologies) for 1 week, starting at 24 hr post transfection. Selected cells were maintained in medium containing 0.3 mg/ml G418. LPCAT3-null cells were established by transfecting a pair of single guide RNAs, inserted in the expression vector pX459 (Addgene, plasmid 48,139). Transfection with this vector leads to the simultaneous expression of single guide RNAs, Cas9, and a puromycin resistance gene. Single guide RNAs were designed to flank the region coding the WHG sequence of rat LPCAT3 and cause a \u223c100 bp deletion in <i>Lpcat3</i> gene (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>). The WHG sequence is conserved in all members of the membrane-bound <i>O</i>-acyltransferase family (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hofmann, 2000</a>), and is required for LPCAT3 activity (<a href=\"#bib46\">Shindou et al., 2009</a>).

Reaction mixtures contained 110 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1.5 mM EDTA, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> (Wako), 0.015% Tween-20, and 150 mM sucrose in a total volume of 100 \u03bcl. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 300 \u03bcl chloroform/methanol (1/2, Wako). Internal standards (dilauryl-PC for LPCAT assay and dimyristoyl-PE for LPEAT assay, Avanti) were added, lipids were extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bligh and Dyer, 1959</a>), dried using a centrifugal evaporator (Sakuma Seisakusho Ltd., Tokyo, Japan), and reconstituted in methanol. Products were measured by LC-MS. Products were separated on an ACQUITY UPLC BEH C8 column (1.7 \u03bcm, 2.1 \u00d7 30 mm, Waters Corporation, Milford, MA) using a linear gradient of solvent B (acetonitrile, Wako) over solvent A (20 mM NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub>/water, Wako), using an ACQUITY ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) system (Waters). The flow rate was 800 \u03bcl/min. The gradient started at 55% solvent B, was linearly increased to 95% solvent B in 4.5 min, and maintained for 1.5 min. Detection was done on a TSQ Vantage triple stage quadrupole mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) by selected reaction monitoring (SRM). Transitions were [M + H]<sup>+</sup> \u2192 184.1 for PC and [M + H]<sup>+</sup> \u2192 [M + H-141]<sup>+</sup> for PE (both in the positive ion mode electrospray ionization). Signals of LPCAT products were compared to calibration curves of nonlabeled standards for quantification. When total LPCAT activity is shown, it illustrates the sum of the five products generated during the assay. Standards for LPEAT products were not available, and peak areas normalized to the internal standard were used as a measure of enzymatic activity."

This method does not resolve the acyl chains at the <i>sn-</i>1 and <i>sn-</i>2 positions. To characterize the acyl-chain composition of selected peaks, SRM was additionally performed in the negative ion mode. The transitions were [M + HCO<sub>3</sub>]<sup>\u2212</sup> \u2192 255.2 for species containing palmitate, and [M + HCO<sub>3</sub>]<sup>\u2212</sup> \u2192 283.2 for those containing stearate. Although this method is more specific in the discrimination of acyl-chains, we obtained a better linear dynamic range in the positive ion mode, and thus used the precursor ion scanning for the figure in this manuscript. Peak areas of all detected diacyl-PC species were summed, and the ratio of individual species (as % of total) was calculated.

                                "text": "Frozen tissues (0.5\u2013100 mg) were pulverized and 0.8 ml methanol was added. The tissue suspensions were centrifuged at 15,000\u00d7<i>g</i>, and the collected supernatant was used for the measurement of phospholipids. PC concentration was measured by an enzyme-based fluorescent assay with minor modifications from a previous report (<a href=\"#bib34\">Morita et al., 2010</a>). Samples were dried in a centrifugal evaporator and dissolved in 0.16 ml 1% Triton X-100 (Wako) per mg wet tissue weight. 10 \u03bcl of sample was reacted with 40 \u03bcl mixture C1 (PC-Specific Phospholipase D [1:200 dilution, Cayman], 1.5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 50 mM NaCl [Wako], and 50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.4]) at 37\u00b0C for 30 min. After generation of free choline from PC, 50 \u03bcl mixture C2 (4 U/ml choline oxidase from <i>Alcaligenes sp.</i> [Wako], 5 U/ml horseradish peroxidase [Oriental Yeast Co., ltd., Tokyo, Japan], 0.3 mM Amplex Red (Life Technologies), 0.2% Triton X-100, 50 mM NaCl and 50 mM Tris-HCl [pH7.4]) were added and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The hydrogen peroxide generated by choline oxidase was fluorescently detected using Amplex Red reagent and measured with ARVO X3 (PerkinElmer Inc., Waltham, MA). For phospholipid analysis, the methanol extracts were further diluted with methanol to adjust the concentration to 10 mg tissue/ml (liver, brain, and lung), 7 mg tissue/ml (kidney), 5 mg tissue/ml (proximal small intestine), 3.5 mg tissue/ml (heart), 3 mg tissue/ml (distal small intestine and stomach), 1.5 mg tissue/ml (thymus), 1 mg tissue/ml (colon), and 0.5\u20132.7 mg tissue/ml (spleen). Embryonic spleens were very small with high variability, and were used without adjustment of concentration. This might have led to the difference in total signal in <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>. LC-SRM-MS analysis was performed using a Nexera UHPLC system and triple quadrupole mass spectrometers LCMS-8040 or LCMS-8050 (Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan). For phospholipid analysis, an Acquity UPLC BEH C8 column (1.7 \u03bcm, 2.1 mm \u00d7 100 mm, Waters) was used with the following ternary mobile phase compositions: 5 mM NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub>/water (mobile phase A), acetonitrile (mobile phase B), and isopropanol (mobile phase C). Pump gradient [time (%A/%B/%C)] was programmed as follows: 0 min (75/20/5)\u201320 min (20/75/5)\u201340 min (20/5/75)\u201345 min (5/5/90)\u201350 min (5/5/90)\u201355 min (75/20/5). Flow rate was 0.35 ml/min and column temperature was 47\u00b0C. Injection volume was 5 \u03bcl. SRM analysis with phospholipid class discrimination was performed with the following transitions: [M + H]<sup>+</sup> \u2192 184 for PC, [M + H]<sup>+</sup> \u2192 [M + H-141]<sup>+</sup> for PE, [M-H]<sup>\u2212</sup> \u2192 [M-H\u221287]<sup>\u2212</sup> for PS, [M-H]<sup>\u2212</sup> \u2192 241 for PI. Peak areas of all the detected species were summed to obtain the total signal. Peak areas of individual species were normalized with this sum, and are illustrated as % of total. For the comparison of <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, PC species that were detected in all samples were selected. The ratio between LPCAT3-deficient mice and wild type mice (as % of wild type) was calculated for each species in every tissues. These values were further averaged for all tissues to detect the changes that occurred globally. As in the case of lipid analysis for cultured cells, this method does not resolve the acyl chains at the <i>sn-</i>1 and <i>sn-</i>2 positions. For relevant phospholipid species, additional SRM analyses with selection of fatty acid fragments at Q3 were performed to confirm that they contain the fatty acid of interest. Detection was performed at the negative ion mode using the following transitions: [M + HCO<sub>3</sub>]<sup>\u2212</sup> \u2192 [FA-H]<sup>\u2212</sup> for PC, [M-H]<sup>\u2212</sup> \u2192 [FA-H]<sup>\u2212</sup> for PE, where [FA] is the monoisotopic mass of the fatty acid of interest. We set up SRM channels for all possible acyl-chain composition, based on the assumption that the following fatty acids are present in vivo: C12:0, C12:1, C14:0, C14:1, C16:0, C16:1, C17:0, C17:1, C18:0 to C18:3, C20:0 to C20:5, C22:0 to C22:6, C24:0 to C24:6. The data presented in the manuscript are derived from SRM channels detecting the fatty acid fragment with more unsaturation (or the longer one when both have the same unsaturation), but only molecules that were detected in SRM channels for both fatty acid fragment with consistent retention times were analyzed."

Then, drying was completed in a centrifugal evaporator for 15 min. The dried lipid film was resuspended in 400 \u03bcl assay buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH7.4), 150 mM NaCl, and 2 mM EDTA), freeze-thawed five times, and then filtered 21 times through a 50 nm pore size polycarbonate membrane (Nucleopore Track-Etch Membrane, GE Healthcare) using a mini-extruder (Avanti). The solution was centrifuged at 16,100\u00d7<i>g</i> (18\u00b0C, 10 min), and the supernatant was used as PC/NBD-TG vesicles. Fluorescence of vesicles was measured with a plate reader (ARVO X3) using 485 nm excitation and 535 nm emission wavelengths. Total fluorescence was determined by adding 97 \u03bcl of isopropanol to 3 \u03bcl of vesicles. Quenching of NBD-TG was calculated as follows: % quenching = (total fluorescence\u2014fluorescence of vesicles)/total fluorescence \u00d7 100. We noted that the TG to PC ratio largely affects the quenching efficiency, thus the optimal concentration (which is around 3% TG in our experience) might vary between vials."

                                "text": "Approximately, 1 g of mouse liver was homogenized in 5 ml of ice-cold hypotonic buffer (1 mM Tris-HCl [pH7.4], 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> [Wako], and 1 mM EGTA [Sigma\u2013Aldrich]) using a Potter-Elvehjem (Teflon/Glass) tissue grinder. After ultracentrifugation at 218,800\u00d7<i>g</i> (10\u00b0C, 1 hr), the supernatant was collected and used as an MTP source. Protein concentration was measured using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay. The supernatant of boiled liver homogenate (95\u00b0C, 5 min) centrifuged at 16,100\u00d7<i>g</i> (18\u00b0C, 10 min) was used as a negative control. MTP assay was performed by a modification of previous methods (<a href=\"#bib5\">Atzel and Wetterau, 1993</a>, <a href=\"#bib4\">1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Athar et al., 2004</a>). MTP activity was measured as the transfer of NBD-TG from donor to acceptor vesicles. PC/NBD-TG vesicles prepared for the quenching assay were used as donor vesicles. Acceptor vesicles were prepared with egg yolk PC (4.385 \u03bcmol) dried in glass vials under nitrogen gas stream and then under vacuum for 15 min. The dried PC was rehydrated in 500 \u03bcl of sucrose buffer (180 mM sucrose, 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH7.4), 150 mM NaCl, and 2 mM EDTA), freeze-thawed five times, and then filtered 21 times through a 400 nm pore size polycarbonate membrane (Nucleopore Track-Etch Membrane, GE Healthcare) using a mini-extruder (Avanti Polar Lipids). Vesicles were diluted 10-fold in assay buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH7.4), 150 mM NaCl, and 2 mM EDTA), pelleted at 16,100\u00d7<i>g</i> (18\u00b0C, 10 min), and washed with assay buffer. For each reaction, donor vesicles (containing 2.7 pmol of PC and 0.084 pmol of NBD-TG), acceptor vesicles (containing 43.5 pmol of PC), liver homogenate (100 \u03bcg), and 0.05 mg BSA (Sigma\u2013Aldrich) were combined and adjusted to a total volume of 50 \u03bcl with assay buffer. Donor vesicle-free reactions were also prepared and used for blanks. The reactions were incubated in a Deep Well Maximizer incubator/mixer (Taitec Co., Ltd., Saitama, Japan) for 0 or 1 hr (60 rpm, 37\u00b0C) and then centrifuged at 16,100\u00d7<i>g</i> (18\u00b0C, 10 min). The supernatants (which contained the donor vesicles) were collected, and the acceptor vesicle-containing pellets were washed with 100 \u03bcl of assay buffer and then resuspended and collected in 10 \u03bcl of assay buffer. 100 \u03bcl of 10% assay buffer/90% isopropanol was applied to wash the tube walls and also collected. The collected supernatant and pellet fractions were diluted 10-fold with isopropanol and total fluorescence of supernatant (donor), pellet (acceptor), and tube wall washes were measured with a plate reader (ARVO X3) using 485 nm excitation and 535 nm emission wavelengths. The fluorescence value of each fraction was corrected for background by subtracting blank well values. NBD-TG transfer was calculated by the differences in fluorescence between 0 and 1 hr incubation. Transfer was calculated as follows: % transfer = fluorescence of pellet fraction/(fluorescence of pellet + fluorescence of supernatant + fluorescence of tube wall wash) \u00d7 100."

It is important that in FADS-deficient mice, PUFA are provided from the breast milk, and the deficiency occurs only after weaning. Thus, the neonatal intestinal abnormalities might not be seen in FADS-deficient mice naturally. In addition, as intestinal lipid accumulation and enterocyte dysfunction occur only when high amounts of lipids are absorbed, it is possible that a high-fat diet might cause such abnormalities in FADS-deficient mice. In fact, lipid droplet accumulation in the liver has been reported in FADS2-deficient mice (Stoffel, 2008), which was rescued by arachidonate feeding. This observation appears consistent with our model. We also agree with the idea that continuous remodeling is important, as will be described below. These points are appropriately added in the Discussion."

Molecular dynamics simulations showed that local clustering promotes flip-flop of TG (Khandelia et al.). Therefore, we speculate that PUFA-containing PC promotes the clustering of TG (as shown by the quenching assay) and that the high flip-flop rate enables efficient TG transfer since MTP should have access for TG only in the luminal leaflet. Therefore the surface curvature might not necessarily be involved in transfer by, but rather in TG clustering. Indeed, although we analyzed TG quenching and transfer using liposomes of different diameters using different pore size filters (30-100 nm), we found no difference with statistical significance. However, we know empirically that pressure during liposome extrusion might affect NBD-TG quenching and that extrusion pressure changes depending on the filter pore size. Therefore, two factors (diameter and pressure) are changed in the experimental design, making it difficult to draw a precise conclusion, and we prefer not to include this data in the manuscript. In addition, it is also difficult to know how liposome diameter affects local curvature on the surface of clustered TG."

Also, the increase in 22:6 n-3 in LPCAT3-deficient mice (</i><a href=\"#fig6\"><i>Figure 6</i></a><i>) suggests that the n-3 derived pro-resolving mediator pathways might be unregulated or enhanced with the production of resolvin and protectins in certain tissues in these mice, which the authors may choose to consider for their discussion. This might be relevant in tissue inflammation and its resolution</i>."

In addition, we added discussion about n-3 derived pro-resolving mediators and 18:2-derived lipid mediators. Since it is important that in contrast to the decreases in arachidonate, the changes in 18:2 and 22:6 are seen only in a subset of tissues, we added figures of GC-FID data showing the changes in these fatty acids to avoid misleading of the readers (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figures 5B and 5C</a>)."
