In this study, using biophysically realistic models of the thalamocortical network, we identified the critical intrinsic and synaptic mechanisms, associated with the putative action of acetylcholine (ACh), GABA and monoamines, which lead to transitions between primary brain vigilance states (waking, non-rapid eye movement sleep [NREM] and REM sleep) within an ultradian cycle. Using ECoG recordings from humans and LFP recordings from cats and mice, we found that during NREM sleep the power of spindle and delta oscillations is negatively correlated in humans and positively correlated in animal recordings. We explained this discrepancy by the differences in the relative level of ACh. Overall, our study revealed the critical intrinsic and synaptic mechanisms through which different neuromodulators acting in combination result in characteristic brain EEG rhythms and transitions between sleep stages."

In this study, using biophysically realistic models of the thalamocortical network, we identified the critical intrinsic and synaptic mechanisms, associated with the putative action of acetylcholine (ACh), GABA and monoamines, which lead to transitions between primary brain vigilance states (waking, non-rapid eye movement sleep [NREM] and REM sleep) within an ultradian cycle. Using ECoG recordings from humans and LFP recordings from cats and mice, we found that during NREM sleep the power of spindle and delta oscillations is negatively correlated in humans and positively correlated in animal recordings. We explained this discrepancy by the differences in the relative level of ACh. Overall, our study revealed the critical intrinsic and synaptic mechanisms through which different neuromodulators acting in combination result in characteristic brain EEG rhythms and transitions between sleep stages."

It is thought that these patterns may help us to remember things that have happened throughout the day. Cells in parts of the brain called the hypothalamus and the brainstem control transitions between sleep stages. They regulate the release of chemicals known as neuromodulators in many parts of the brain, including the cortex and thalamus, which play the roles in memory and learning. Researchers now know how the neuromodulators influence the properties of individual brain cells. However, it is not clear how coordinated action of many neuromodulators result in the patterns of electrical activity seen in the brain during each stage of sleep."

More studies are needed to look at how the networks of cells in the cortex and thalamus communicate with the brainstem, and how changes in the levels of neuromodulators affect memory and learning."

These features form the basis for classification of sleep into different stages: rapid eye movement sleep (REM), and stages N1 (Stage 1), N2 (Stage 2) and N3 (Stage 3) of non-REM sleep (<a href=\"#bib66\">Rechtschaffen and Kales, 1968</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Iber and Medicine, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Silber et al., 2007</a>). A typical night of sleep consists of 4\u20135 sleep cycles of transitions across stages in healthy adults. Each sleep cycle shows progression of sleep stages in the following order, N1 <math id=\"inf1\"><mo>\u2192</mo></math> N2 <math id=\"inf2\"><mo>\u2192</mo></math> N3 <math id=\"inf3\"><mo>\u2192</mo></math> N2 <math id=\"inf4\"><mo>\u2192</mo></math> REM (<a href=\"#bib29\">Feinberg and Floyd, 1979</a>). Approximately 75% of sleep is spent in NREM stages. There is also a greater amount of N3 (also termed Slow Wave Sleep, SWS) earlier in the night, whereas REM stage is relatively dominant during later cycles of sleep (<a href=\"#bib2\">Aeschbach and Borbely, 1993</a>)."

The N1 stage consists of slow eye movements and low-amplitude low-frequency (4\u20137 Hz) EEG activity in humans. The sleep stage N2 is dominated by sleep spindle oscillations at 10\u201317\u00a0Hz (in humans) with waxing-and-waning field potentials. Spindles last about 0.5\u20132 s and recur every 2\u201320 s. Similar events have been studied in non-human mammals, where their frequency may be as low as 7\u2009Hz. During the N3 delta band (0.2\u20134\u2009Hz), rhythms are found in the EEG (<a href=\"#bib66\">Rechtschaffen and Kales, 1968</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Amzica and Steriade, 1998</a>). This stage is dominated by the slow oscillation, consisting of active (Up) and silent (Down) cortical states alternating at frequency 0.2\u20131\u2009Hz, that are prominent and visible in the EEG, and in the extracellular and intracellular recordings (<a href=\"#bib77\">Steriade et al., 1991</a>, <a href=\"#bib80\">1993a</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">2001</a>, <a href=\"#bib92\">Werth et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib84\">Timofeev et al., 2000</a>, <a href=\"#bib85\">2001</a>). During Up states, most cells within the cerebral cortex are relatively depolarized and may generate action potentials; during Down states, most cortical neurons are hyperpolarized and do not fire (<a href=\"#bib81\">Steriade et al., 1993b</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Contreras and Steriade, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib84\">Timofeev et al., 2000</a>). The slow oscillation may nest faster spindles, which are commonly found during Down-to-Up state transitions (<a href=\"#bib55\">Molle et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Clemens et al., 2007</a>). During REM sleep, electrical brain activity <i>resembles</i> that of the awake state, including mixed signals with bursts of alpha (7\u201312\u2009Hz) activity (<a href=\"#bib15\">Cantero and Atienza, 2000</a>). Precise coordination of different EEG rhythms during sleep is believed to be critical for memory consolidation which manifests in reactivation of specific neural activity patterns \u2013 sleep replay \u2013 that have been observed in different brain areas including the hippocampus, amygdala, neocortex and striatum (<a href=\"#bib60\">Nadasdy et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Pennartz et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Euston et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Popa et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Bendor and Wilson, 2012</a>)."

We predict that the differences in the temporal dynamics of spindle and delta band oscillations observed in the LFP recordings of cats and mice and ECoG activity of human subjects during SWS (N3 in humans) could arise from the relative differences in the level of neuromodulators. We further apply the model to explain electrical activity observed in propofol-induced anesthesia. Our study predicts that even minor changes of neuromodulators may affect the properties of sleep spindles and sleep slow oscillation in NREM sleep, thus possibly affecting the dynamics of memory consolidation."

When spindle and delta power were both low (e.g. clusters 3 and 4), the activity resembled an awake or REM sleep. In many instances of activity in cluster 4 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>), we observed very brief and spatially localized periods of 7\u201315\u2009Hz oscillations, which were similar to the alpha or mu rhythms recorded during REM sleep. For higher levels of delta power, two groups of clusters were observed: clusters corresponding to low spindle power (e.g. cluster 2) and clusters where spindle power was positively correlated to the delta power (e.g. clusters 5, 6). Cluster 2 with low-spindle power but high-delta power corresponded to the stereotypic transitions between Up and Down states (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>) as observed during the sleep slow oscillation in vivo, while clusters with a correlated spindle and delta power (clusters 5 and 6) corresponded to the mixed states, where brief (cluster 6) or long (cluster 5) periods of spindles appeared between periods of slow oscillation. Finally, a distinct cluster 1 corresponded to low-delta power, but high-spindle power. This cluster represented quasi-continuous spindle activity (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>)."

In order to link them to specific levels of the neuromodulators, all detected clusters were projected to the neurochemical space. Such projection was performed by fitting an ellipsoid around the means of each cluster in the three-dimensional space of the neuromodulators (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Thus, location of each ellipsoid provides a guide to the range of neuromodulators that produced a specific electrographic pattern. A multivariate ANOVA on the location of the different clusters in the neuromodulator space was significant (p&lt;10e-6), suggesting that the clusters occupy different regions. Clusters 3 and 4 (green ellipsoids in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a> corresponding to the awake or REM sleep like electrical activity) were associated with relatively high ACh levels such as that observed during awake and REM periods. Cluster 2 (violet ellipsoid in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a> corresponding to the slow oscillation) was observed in the low ACh conditions, as found during N3. Clusters 5 and 6 (sleep stage 2 based on electrical activity) corresponded to intermediate levels of the neuromodulators. Finally, cluster 1 was observed for lower HA and higher GABA levels, in agreement with the data showing that strong GABA promotes spindle activity (<a href=\"#bib61\">Parrino and Terzano, 1996</a>). In sum, our analysis confirmed a specific role of neuromodulators in controlling the electrical activity of the thalamocortical network in different sleep and awake conditions, in agreement with past experimental studies (<a href=\"#bib7\">Baghdoyan and Lydic, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">McCormick, 1992</a>)."

Changes in the neuromodulators were restricted to either thalamus or cortex to isolate the role of different regions. Furthermore, we focused on manipulations of the ACh and HA and not GABA, since in our model GABA modulation (within the physiological range) alone was not able to induce any state transitions. We found that in order to induce a transition from awake to N2, a reduction of HA in the thalamus was necessary but produced very focal and scattered spindles (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Reduction of both ACh and HA in the thalamus (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>) resulted in spindle activity that was similar to that in a full model (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, see also <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Cortical changes alone did not lead to spindles (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>) but were required to obtain cortical membrane potentials in the physiological range during N2. We concluded that reduction of ACh and HA in the thalamus, along with reduction of ACh in the cortex, constitute a minimal model needed to simulate the main features of the transition from the awake state to the N2 sleep state."

Since reduction of the ACh has two main actions in our model, an increase in excitatory connection strength and an increase of leak currents, we examined if either of these changes alone could result in transition to the N3.

Surprisingly, visual scoring of cat LFPs revealed that there were only relatively short periods of the S2 (equivalent to N2; to describe animal experiments we use here terminology common in the animal studies) compared to the SWS (equivalent to N3). This result was consistent across animals. The power in the spindle (8\u201315\u00a0Hz) and delta (0.2\u20134\u2009Hz) frequency bands was measured across all channels and the average power was plotted in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C and D</a>, separately for the cortical and thalamic (VPL) recordings. The amplitude of the slow oscillation and spindles were both high during the S2 and SWS, and were reduced in awake and REM. This suggests that the SWS in naturally sleeping cats is marked with the relatively high-spindle activity. Slow (0.2\u20131\u2009Hz) oscillations provided the major contribution to delta band activity during SWS. To further examine the interaction between sleep spindles and slow oscillations, we plotted the power in the spindle vs delta frequency bands across different cortical LFP electrodes (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). We found a strong correlation between slow oscillation and spindle activity. In mice (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F,G</a>), a similar relationship between spindle and delta power was observed across recordings from five animals (3 channels per mouse); a positive correlation was observed in majority of the channels (9 channels out of 15 channels showed significant correlation of which 7 were positively correlated [r ranged from 0.17 to 0.43; p&lt;0.05] and 2 were negatively correlated [r was \u22120.41 and \u20130.43; p&lt;0.05]).

In contrast to the pattern found in cats and mice, there was a significant <i>negative</i> correlation between the spindle and the delta power observed in successive 30\u00a0s epochs obtained during the N2 and N3 (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C and D</a>) in humans. Generally, the slow oscillation was higher during N3 than during N2, whereas spindle activity was higher in N2 than in N3, resulting in a negative correlation across epochs. The average Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient across 42 channels was \u22120.2595 (sd = 0.2281) (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E</a>). Fifteen out of 42 electrodes showed a significant negative correlation (p&lt;0.001), and no electrodes showed a significant positive correlation. We also observed periods of increased power in the 7\u201315\u2009Hz frequency band during REM and awake suggesting transient periods of alpha (or mu) rhythm. To simulate the negative correlation between sleep slow oscillation and spindle activities, we again applied results from our analysis of the neuromodulator space (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). When the ACh level was reduced to 45% of the baseline during the N3 (compared to 57% used in the control model, see <a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2</a>, <a href=\"#fig3\">3</a>), the network activity revealed a negative correlation between the delta and spindle frequency bands (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8 F and G</a>).

These results are also consistent with the previous computational models of propofol application, where the increase in decay time constant of IPSPs led to increase in 8\u201315\u2009Hz oscillations (<a href=\"#bib19\">Ching et al., 2010</a>).

However, the mechanisms whereby specific cellular and synaptic changes triggered by the combined action of neuromodulators result in transitions between sleep stages and their precise electrical characteristics remain poorly understood. In this new study, we used biophysically realistic computational models of the thalamocortical system to identify the minimal set of cellular and network level changes, linked to the putative action of the neuromodulators, that is sufficient to explain the characteristic neuronal dynamics during sleep as well as the transitions between primary sleep stages and from sleep to awake state. Our study predicts a critical role of the neuromodulators in controlling the precise spatio-temporal characteristics of neuronal synchronization that manifest in major sleep rhythms \u2013 sleep spindles and slow oscillations.

The survival of the slow oscillation (&lt;1\u2009Hz global electrical activity found during deep (N3) sleep) after extensive thalamic lesions in vivo (<a href=\"#bib81\">Steriade et al., 1993b</a>), its existence in cortical slice preparations (<a href=\"#bib69\">Sanchez-Vives and McCormick, 2000</a>), and the absence of the slow oscillations in the thalamus of decorticated cats (<a href=\"#bib86\">Timofeev and Steriade, 1996</a>) point to the primarily intracortical origin for this rhythm. (Note that thalamus can be actively involved in synchronization of the SO [<a href=\"#bib40\">Lemieux et al., 2014</a>]). In vivo and in vitro studies suggest that the minimal substrate accounting for spindle oscillations (7\u201315\u2009Hz recurrent oscillatory activity found during stage 2 (N2) of NREM sleep) is the interaction between thalamic reticular and relay cells (<a href=\"#bib75\">Steriade and Desch\u00e9nes, 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Steriade et al., 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Steriade and Llinas, 1988</a>, <a href=\"#bib78\">1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib90\">von Krosigk et al., 1993</a>).

Several phenomenological and reduced mathematical models have been proposed to test the effects of neuromodulators on the sleep-wake cycle (<a href=\"#bib45\">McCarley and Hobson, 1975</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Robinson et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Schellenberger Costa et al., 2016</a>).

Other neuromodulatory changes (such as change of GABA conductance) were not sufficient alone to induce N2-like activity, but played a role in determining the power and the synchrony of oscillations. Reduction in the ACh levels within the cortical network was identified to be a minimal requirement for the transition from the N2 (spindles) to the N3 (slow oscillation). Our study of the minimal models revealed the importance of the cell-type-specific action of the neuromodulators. Indeed, in order to model sleep stage transitions, the crucial changes were in HA, primarily acting on thalamic neurons, and in ACh, primarily acting within a cortex. All the network rhythms reported in this study resulted from intrinsic (autonomous) dynamics of the thalamocortical network; no external stimulation was applied to entrain any of the oscillatory activities in the model."

While we found network states dominated by either spindles or slow oscillations, under certain conditions (such as only moderate reduction of the ACh level) we also observed mixed states combining these two major rhythms. Such mixed states may occur in vivo under normal conditions (<a href=\"#bib2\">Aeschbach and Borbely, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Muller et al., 2006</a>); our recent behavior study suggests that the strengths of the phase amplitude coupling between the spindle and the slow oscillation during NREM sleep correlates with memory consolidation (<a href=\"#bib59\">Niknazar et al., 2015</a>). We speculate that the mixed states may become prevalent in some pathological conditions such as in Alzheimer\u2019s disease where sleep is altered and changes to the neuromodulatory system are reported (<a href=\"#bib93\">Wulff et al., 2010</a>). Furthermore, our results on the putative relationship between levels of neuromodulators and characteristic sleep electrical activities could be potentially relevant to understanding the changes observed with aging. Indeed, the level of the HA in cerebrospinal fluid is known to be elevated with aging (<a href=\"#bib64\">Prell et al., 1988</a>), where spindle power is known to be reduced (<a href=\"#bib25\">Crowley et al., 2002</a>). In our model, the HA level is one of the major predictors of spindle power. Thus, we can speculate that an increase of HA with age could contribute to the decline of the spindle power."

Indeed, ACh suppresses the spread of excitation in vivo (<a href=\"#bib38\">Kimura et al., 1999</a>) and reduces evoked responses (<a href=\"#bib17\">Chauvette et al., 2012</a>). In slice experiments, ACh activation of muscarinic receptors suppressed both intracortical and thalamocortical excitatory connections, while nicotinic activation led to suppression of the intracortical connections and enhancement of the thalamocortical connections (<a href=\"#bib31\">Gil et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Hsieh et al., 2000</a>)."

In cats and mice, there was a strong positive correlation between spindle and delta power, while in humans there was a negative correlation between oscillations in these frequency bands. This difference may reflect the prominence of N2 (stage 2) in humans, in whom N2 has the longest duration of any sleep stage. In contrast, in cats, N2 is very rare compared to N3. In humans, N2 is mainly characterized by spindles with relatively short periods of slow oscillation or isolated K-complexes. (K-Complexes are large downward deflections in EEG often followed by spindle activity and is one of the electrophysiological markers of N2 (<a href=\"#bib42\">Loomis et al., 1937</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Amzica and Steriade, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Cash et al., 2009</a>). In N3, spindles continue to occur in conjunction with the slow oscillation, but the EEG is dominated by slow activity. Our model predicts that this inter-species difference can be explained by a difference in the relative level of ACh during NREM sleep. This result is consistent with microdialysis measurements in cats where ACh was present during SWS albeit at low concentrations compared to wakefulness (<a href=\"#bib44\">Marrosu et al., 1995</a>)."

We hypothesize that transient activities such as K-Complexes during N2 sleep or PGO waves during REM stage may arise from fluctuations in ACh and/or other neuromodulators. Ultimately, our study predicts that transient changes in the level of neuromodulators may affect the interaction and characteristic properties of sleep rhythms and may thus affect functional outcomes of sleep, such as the impact of sleep on memory and learning."

Based on experimental data, when compared to the awake stage, the levels of ACh and HA were reduced during NREM sleep (N2 and N3) and increased during REM sleep (<a href=\"#bib87\">Vanini et al., 2012</a>). Concentration of the extracellular GABA in the neocortex is higher during NREM sleep and reduced during REM sleep compared to the awake state (<a href=\"#bib87\">Vanini et al., 2012</a>). The origin of this change in the level of GABA is not fully understood. We examined the effect of changes in both phasic and tonic inhibitions. Thus, we tested three different models: (1) no change in the level of the GABA release; (2) miniature IPSPs were changed based on the measurements of extracellular GABA levels in microdialysis experiments (<a href=\"#bib87\">Vanini et al., 2012</a>); and (3) miniature IPSPs were modified based on the assumption that GABA is co-released with ACh and HA, as shown in some experiments (<a href=\"#bib70\">Saunders et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib94\">Yu et al., 2015</a>)."

The thalamocortical network consisted of five hundred cortical pyramidal (PY) neurons, one hundred cortical inhibitory (IN) neurons, one hundred thalamic relay (TC) neurons and one hundred thalamic reticular (RE) neurons. The network connectivity between different groups of neuron is shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>. One-dimensional network topology was used in each layer and connectivity was local and determined by the radius of connections. The PY neurons received AMPA and NMDA synapses from other PY neurons within radius of 5. The TC neurons projected to RE neurons through AMPA synapses (radius of 8), and connections from RE to TC neurons included GABA-A and GABA-B synapses (radius of 8). Thalamocortical connections were wider and mediated by AMPA synapses (TC to PY: radius of 10; TC to IN: radius of 2); corticothalamic connections included AMPA synapses (PY to TC: radius of 10; PY to RE: radius of 8) and were stronger to reticular neurons than to thalamic relay neurons."

For implantation of recording chamber and electrodes, cats were anesthetized with isoflurane (0.75\u20132%). Prior to surgery, the animal was given a dose of preanesthetic, which was composed of ketamine (15 mg/kg), buprenorphine (0.01 mg/kg) and acepromazine (0.3 mg/kg). After site shaving and cat intubation for gaseous anesthesia, the site of incision was washed with at least three alternating passages of a 4% chlorexidine solution and 70% alcohol. Lidocaine (0.5%) and/or marcaine (0.5%) was injected at the site of incision and at all pressure points. During surgery, electrodes for LFP recordings, EMG from neck muscle, and EOG were implanted and fixed with acrylic dental cement. Eight to ten screws were fixed to the cranium. To allow future head-restrained recordings without any pressure point, we covered four bolts in the dental cement that also covered bone-fixed screws and permanently implanted electrodes. Throughout the surgery, the body temperature was maintained at 37\u00b0C using a water-circulating thermoregulated blanket. Heart beat and oxygen saturation were continuously monitored using a pulse oximeter (Rad-8, MatVet) and the level of anesthesia was adjusted to maintain a heart beat at 110\u2013120 per minute. A lactate ringer solution (10\u2009ml/kg/hr, intravenously [i.v.]) was given during the surgery. After the surgery, cats were given buprenorphine (0.01 mg/ kg) or anafen (2 mg/kg) twice a day for 3 days and baytril (5 mg/kg) once a day for 7 days. About a week was allowed for animals to recover from the surgery before the first recording session occurred. Usually, 2\u20133 days of training were sufficient for cats to remain in head-restrained position for 2\u20134\u2009hr and display several periods of quiet wakefulness, SWS, and REM sleep. The recordings were performed up to 40 days after the surgery."

After site shaving, the site of incision was washed with at least three alternating passages of a 4% chlorexidine solution and 70% alcohol. Lidocaine (0.5%) and/or marcaine (0.25%) was injected at the site of incision and at all pressure points. Prior to surgery, the animal was given a dose of buprenorphine (0.05\u20130.1\u00a0mg/kg). During surgery, electrodes for LFP recordings (custom-made, stainless steel) and EMG from neck muscle were implanted and fixed with acrylic dental cement. We aimed at implanting LFP electrodes at a depth of about 650 \u00b5m. Four or five anchoring screws were fixed to the cranium. A stainless steel screw implanted above the cerebellum was used as a reference. Throughout the surgery, the body temperature was maintained at 37\u00b0C using a water-circulating thermoregulated blanket. Saline (0.1\u20130.5\u2009ml) and anafen (5 mg/kg) subcutaneous injection were performed at the end of the surgery. After the surgery, mice were given anafen (5 mg/kg) once a day for 2 days. About a week was allowed for animals to recover from the surgery before the first recording session occurred. LFPs were band-pass filtered (0.1\u2013100\u2009Hz). Freely\u00a0moving mice were plugged to a custom-made headstage to reduce movement artifacts and then amplified with AM 3000 amplifiers (A-M systems). All electrical signals were digitally sampled at 1 kHz on Powerlab (ADinstruments, Colorado Springs, USA) and stored for offline analysis. At the end of the experiments, mice were euthanized with a lethal dose of euthanyl (120 mg/kg, i.v.). The protocol for mice experiments was approved by CPAUL, Comit\u00e9 de protection des animaux de l'Universit\u00e9 Laval (Protocol # 2013-014-4)."

Recordings were obtained after informed consent monitored by the Partners Human Subject Protection Committee (Protocol #2007P00165). The patient had an 8 \u00d7\u00a08 64-contact peri-sylvian grid and four strips implanted subdurally over the left hemisphere, sampling temporal, Rolandic, parietal and frontal cortices at 1 cm spacing. After rejection of electrodes that either had poor contact or showed epileptic interictal activity, such as interictal spikes, 42 electrodes remained for analysis. We analyzed a recording period of 9\u2009hr at night and sleep scored the patient based on 30 s epochs. Staging was scored using information from scalp, EOG and intracranial electrodes and standard criteria. Awake, REM, N2, and N3 periods were used for further analysis. A fast Fourier transform with a window size of 30 s was performed and power in the SO (0.01\u20132\u2009Hz) and spindle (9\u201317\u2009Hz) band frequencies was obtained, and their correlations calculated for 30\u00a0s epochs during N2 and N3 periods The average Pearson's correlation coefficient R value was \u22120.2592 and standard deviation of 0.2281. The average R-squared was 0.1181. 15 electrodes showed significant negative correlation compared to 0 electrodes showing positive correlation after Bonferroni Correction at the p=0.05 level (n = 42, 0.05/42 = 0.0012 = corrected p-value for significance). When focusing on electrodes over the postcentral gyrus (GR7, GR8, GR12, GR14, GR15, GR16, GR21, GR22, GR23, GR24), the average R was -0.4657 with a standard deviation of 0.1721."

Each trial was 20 s duration; however, the first 10 s was discarded to avoid transient activity. We used Akaike information criteria (AIC) (<a href=\"#bib3\">Akaike, 1974</a>) to measure the least number of components that are required to fit the data. This analysis resulted in a minimum of 10 components beyond which the AIC information measure did not increase. Next a Gaussian mixture model fitting with 10 components using EM method with 500 iterations was applied to obtain the clusters (corresponds to different colored points in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). We then determined the projection of the clusters to the space of neuromodulators and finally fitted an ellipsoid to provide an approximate location of the clusters in the neuromodulator space. The ellipsoid fit was performed using geom3d library (<a href=\"https://github.com/dlegland/matGeom/wiki/geom3d\">https://github.com/dlegland/matGeom/wiki/geom3d</a>). The power, cluster analyses and 3D plotting were performed using MATLAB (MathWorks Inc.). Simulations for various values of neuromodulators were supported by computational resources from the neuroscience gateway (<a href=\"#bib74\">Sivagnanam et al., 2013</a>)."

The model is grounded in previous experimental evidence and covers the major neuromodulators ACh, GABA, and HA. They show how these modulators might synchronize the spindle (N2) and slow oscillations, SO, (N3) states, as well as REM. Using ECoG recordings from humans and LFP recordings from cats and mice, during NREM sleep they show that the power of spindle and SO is negatively correlated in human and positively correlated in cats and mice, and explain this discrepancy by the differences in the relative levels of ACh. They also explore similarities and differences between SO during N3 and ketamine anesthesia and explain them in terms of influences of ketamine on neuromodulator levels and effects. The study identifies potential intrinsic and synaptic mechanisms through which neuromodulators acting in combination may mediate transitions between sleep stages. These findings should be of wide interest to the sleep, and anesthesia communities and to those interested in coordinated whole brain activity."

The authors attempt to mimic ketamine in their model by decreasing NMDA's influence \u2013 but ketamine is a promiscuous molecule that has influence on a great number of channels. Additionally, the unconsciousness produced by the \"dissociative\" anesthetic, ketamine, has a very different phenotype than that of propofol or isoflurane which more or less produce a quiescence resembling sleep. As opposed to these GABAergic anesthetics, ketamine does not activate the sleep nuclei of the hypothalamus (VLPO), does not depress thalamic activity, and activates wake-promoting nuclei in the brain stem. The adjunct agent used in their in vivo experiments (xylazine) does on the other hand promote sleep, but does not do this through NMDA antagonism. Therefore the specificity of their model is really in question.

The model was also compared to neuronal oscillations during sleep using human, cat and mouse datasets. The main conclusion is that the initiation of the oscillatory pattern indicative of N2 sleep can be simulated by a decrease in histamine and acetylcholine. A further decrease in acetylcholine can also explain a transition to deeper sleep. In general, this model contributes much to our understanding of the neurochemical basis of sleep macroarchitecture. Additionally, the results challenge theories that increases in the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA mediate transitions among sleep stages. Although some of the conclusions need to be amended and there are several places that need some grammatical corrections, there is much to be admired in this paper. However some of the grammatical errors and non-sequitors (non-explored ideas) make me concerned that it was hastily prepared."

I think a bit more detail and biological realism needs to be included here. For example, Ach is stated to affect AMPA-mediated transmission and leak current. Of the parameters used to construct the model cells it also affects Km and GABA release. Reading the methods it seems Ach was modelled as a scale factor for all intrinsic and synaptic properties \u2013 but this scale factor was increased for decreased Ach levels. This means, for example, that properties shown not to be affected by Ach were affected in the model, and properties of Ach well documented (such as depolarisation of main interneuron subtypes) were omitted or modelled conversely."

This could be clarified with a more rigorous modelling of the known effects of the two agents to the conductances used in the model.

This revised manuscript has much improved readability in both the precision of writing and clarity of thought. The main conclusions are that a reduction in acetylcholine and histamine levels in the thalamus corresponds to N2 sleep, characterized by spindle activity. And that an increase in GABA alone does not produce the oscillations characteristic of N2. The experiments with propofol anesthesia demonstrate this nicely. The model also predicts that reduced cortical acetylcholine influences the transition to N3 sleep. Overall, this is a nice contribution to the sleep and anesthesia literature."

As pointed out by the reviewer, the four main parameters (K-leak, AMPA, Ih, GABA) were sufficient to explain transitions between sleep stages in the model. These cellular and synaptic properties were chosen based on the past experiments where they have been linked to the effects of neuromodulators. This putative (and certainly incomplete) link allowed us to interpret our results and to make specific predictions for future studies on the variations in the neuromodulators during different sleep stages and on the differences in the neuromodulatory response between humans and cats/mice. To further address reviewer concerns, we also examined transition between sleep stages in a more detailed model (see our response below), which revealed similar qualitative results as the reduced \u201cfour-parameter\u201d model. The way we want to interpret this is that a simple model identifies the core or minimally required changes, which are likely to be linked to the known effects of the neuromodulators in the thalamocortical network.

The only part of the result that utilized this phase locking analysis was for identifying the clusters of activity in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a> and the 4B. Using a range from 0.5 to 20\u2009Hz allowed for better detection of the clusters. We found that using very narrow power bands corresponding to slow oscillation (0.5-4Hz) or spindle activity (7-15\u2009Hz) resulted in less clear distinction between the clusters and adding a dimension by using separate phase-locking value for \u03b4 and spindle bands did not improve the separation of clusters or a change in AIC curves. We now corrected the text to indicate the correct frequency range used for the phase locking."

An increase in the K<sup>+</sup> leak current was identified as a critical component for the transition between awake and slow wave sleep (Bazhenov et al., 2002; Hill and Tononi, 2005), and it was predicted that synchronization of the slow oscillation depends on cortico-cortical connections (Hill and Tononi, 2005). Several phenomenological and reduced mathematical models have been proposed to test the effects of neuromodulators on the sleep-wake cycle (McCarley and Hobson, 1975) (Robinson et al., 2011).

Reading the methods it seems Ach was modelled as a scale factor for all intrinsic and synaptic properties \u2013 but this scale factor was increased for decreased Ach levels.

In this study, we assumed that phasic GABA release is increased during stage 2 and 3 sleep, when ACh and HA are reduced. However, as suggested by the reviewer, there is a complex interaction between GABA and other neuromodulators. In our study, we examined in detail how varying levels of GABA influence the activity in the thalamocortical network for different combinations of ACh and HA (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). We identified that change in the level of GABA has relatively less effect compared to the changes in ACh and HA (note the clusters in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a> do not change a lot in the z-axis as much as it changes in x and y-axis). However, for intermediate levels of ACh and HA, GABA determined the density of spindling activity (note the cluster 1,5 and 6 are located at the higher GABA levels). Further, we tested an alternative idea that experimental measurements of GABA reflect the extrasynaptic GABA (see figure below and <a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>), which reflects amount of tonic inhibition. In these simulations, we found that changes in tonic inhibition did not alter the transition between stages but there were changes in amount of oscillatory activity in N2, N3 and REM stages. Due to the lack of clear experimental evidence on the origin of GABA changes across stages of vigilance, we were unable to make clear predictions about role of GABA in sleep stage transitions. Nevertheless, our results suggest that GABA through phasic and tonic inhibition alter the nature of activity within each sleep stage in the thalamocortical network. Furthermore, by examining the variations across wide range of GABA levels (eg in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>) and in conditions of propofol anesthesia (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>) our study could help guiding future experimental studies."
