Here, we compare the transport of soluble secretory proteins (albumin and \u03b11-antitrypsin) with that of supramolecular cargoes (e.g., procollagen) that are proposed to traverse the Golgi by compartment progression\u2013maturation. We show that these soluble proteins traverse the Golgi much faster than procollagen while moving through the same stack. Moreover, we present kinetic and morphological observations that indicate that albumin transport occurs by diffusion via intercisternal continuities. These data provide evidence for a transport mechanism that applies to a major class of secretory proteins and indicate the co-existence of multiple intra-Golgi trafficking modes."

Here, we compare the transport of soluble secretory proteins (albumin and \u03b11-antitrypsin) with that of supramolecular cargoes (e.g., procollagen) that are proposed to traverse the Golgi by compartment progression\u2013maturation. We show that these soluble proteins traverse the Golgi much faster than procollagen while moving through the same stack. Moreover, we present kinetic and morphological observations that indicate that albumin transport occurs by diffusion via intercisternal continuities. These data provide evidence for a transport mechanism that applies to a major class of secretory proteins and indicate the co-existence of multiple intra-Golgi trafficking modes."

Soluble secreted proteins are of great physiological interest because they represent a significant portion (possibly more than 10%) of the mammalian proteome and include hormones, growth factors, serum proteins, antibodies, and digestive enzymes. Thus, these results are consistent with a novel mechanism of transport for a major class of secretory proteins, and provide evidence for multiplicity of transport mechanisms that can help to rationalize most of the observed intra-Golgi trafficking patterns."

For the sake of brevity, from now onward we will use the term compartment progression to describe the traffic of procollagen and other similar cargo). Thus, if albumin moves by diffusion via continuities, it should exhibit transport kinetics and patterns different from VSVG and PC-I. PC-I forms large, stable, non-diffusible aggregates that cannot enter tubules or vesicles and cross the Golgi stack in a gradual fashion by compartment progression (<a href=\"#bib9\">Bonfanti et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib84\">Trucco et al., 2004</a>); and VSVG is a large trimeric transmembrane viral protein that shows the same trafficking pattern as PC-I, at least under certain specific conditions (see below).

A limited but sufficient fraction of injected cells expressed albumin. At 15\u00b0C (time 0), albumin was mostly diffuse in the ER (as seen in HepG2 cells), while PC-I was seen in scattered fluorescent \u2018spots\u2019 (presumably PC-I aggregates within the IC) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Mironov et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib84\">Trucco et al., 2004</a>).

Moreover, a characterization of the GFP-albumin dynamics in HeLa cells based on fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) (<a href=\"#bib59\">Patterson et al., 2008</a>), showed that this construct enters and exits the Golgi with half-times of about 3\u20134 min (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) and diffuses \u2018horizontally\u2019 along the Golgi ribbon in seconds, as expected from its soluble nature (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We thus proceeded to assess the steady-state transport behavior of GFP-albumin, and to compare it with that of PC. To this end, we bleached the Golgi area (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>) and monitored the time for arrival of GFP-albumin from the ER at the cis-Golgi and at the trans-Golgi (again by quantifying its co-localization with GM130 and TGN46; see above and 'Materials and methods') (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C\u2013F</a>). After 1\u20132 min (i.e., the earliest time at which GFP-albumin had recovered to detectable levels in the Golgi stack) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>), GFP-albumin had reached both the cis-Golgi and the TGN (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D\u2013F</a>); in fact, it showed a slightly higher degree of co-localization with TGN46 than with GM130 (using the unbiased co-localization Method 2 based on automatic thresholding; see 'Materials and methods'), indicating that it had already traversed the Golgi stack (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D\u2013F</a>, quantification in J). Later (3 min post-bleaching), the GFP-albumin signal became slightly higher in the trans<i>-</i> than the cis-Golgi, and at 12 min (when recovery was nearly complete), it was clearly higher in the trans<i>-</i> than the cis-Golgi (as seen before bleaching, with a ratio of about 1.8) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3J</a>). To control for the possibility that part of the fluorescence signal recovered in the Golgi area might come from the underlying ER, we repeated this experiment using nocodazole-induced ministacks (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G\u2013I,K</a>), where the cis and trans-Golgi markers are resolved better (<a href=\"#bib79\">Shima et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib84\">Trucco et al., 2004</a>) and the very low background fluorescence of the ER present in the cellular periphery allows a better resolution of Golgi fluorescence. The results were very similar to those obtained with the intact ribbon. Next, to confirm these results by EM we resorted to GFP-photooxidation followed by CLEM experiments. For photooxidation studies, the same experiments as those described above were carried out, and the cells were fixed 2 min after photobleaching, when GFP-albumin fluorescence had recovered in the Golgi. Then, the newly arrived fluorescent protein in the Golgi was excited in the presence of DAB under conditions that favor the photo-oxidation reaction and the formation of DAB electron dense precipitates in the close vicinity of GFP (<a href=\"#bib28\">Grabenbauer et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Meiblitzer-Ruppitsch et al., 2008</a>) ('Materials and methods').

The results shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3O\u2013S</a> clearly indicated that after 2 min of recovery GFP-albumin was already filling the whole Golgi stack."

A limited but sufficient number of cells expressed this cargo. We then bleached the whole Golgi area and monitored the rate of entry of PC-III-GFP into the Golgi complex from the ER.

Later (at 9 min), many more PC-III-GFP aggregates had reached the Golgi stack and some of these co-localized with TGN46 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3M,N</a>), confirming that PC-III, like PC-I, enters the Golgi and then moves gradually to the TGN, consistent with compartment progression and different from the albumin transport pattern."

Some longitudinal tubules were Y-shaped and connected heterologous cisternae in neighboring stacks (not shown), in agreement with previous descriptions (<a href=\"#bib40\">Marsh et al., 2004</a>). In addition, successive cisternae within individual stacks were sometimes connected by tubules that appeared to be oriented in the cis-trans direction (\u2018vertical\u2019 tubules) and that were distributed apparently randomly at all levels of the stack, as previously described (<a href=\"#bib84\">Trucco et al., 2004</a>). These vertical tubules were often convoluted (as exemplified in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013C</a> and <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>), and had calibers ranging from 30 to 60 nm. The number of intercisternal connections between heterologous cisternae across the Golgi stack was highly variable. In HepG2 cells, each stack had about 5 \u00b1 2 intercisternal connections (calculated as described in 'Materials and methods'). When a complete tomographic reconstruction of a tubule was possible, it was always found that the tubule was connected to a cisterna (not shown) in agreement with previous observations (<a href=\"#bib84\">Trucco et al., 2004</a>). A few narrow continuities joining the central areas of adjacent cisternae were also observed (not shown). Similar results were obtained using both chemical fixing and high-pressure freezing (not shown). For comparison, we also examined the Golgi in rat liver. The vertical and Y-shaped tubules were similar to those in HepG2 (not shown)."

Albumin was scarce in the ER (not shown) and dense in the stacks, and even denser in the TGN (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,C,G,I</a>). A similar distribution was also found in rat hepatocytes with a slightly higher concentration of albumin in Golgi and TGN (not shown). The distribution of antitrypsin was indistinguishable from that of albumin (not shown). For comparison, VSVG was markedly more concentrated in the TGN than in the stack (except in cells expressing high levels of VSVG, where the stacks were filled with this cargo) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,D,H,J</a>); and PC-I aggregates (in human fibroblasts) were also much more numerous in the TGN than in the Golgi stack (not shown). Thus, a large fraction of VSVG and PC-I in the Golgi area was located in the TGN. Next, we focused on the distribution of cargo in Golgi tubules and vesicles. We first examined the albumin content of Golgi vesicles (defined as round, 50\u201360 nm-wide profiles near the Golgi stack; see 'Materials and methods') by immuno-EM. The vesicular profiles were markedly depleted of albumin (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>, arrows, and 5k for quantification).

We sought to resolve this discrepancy between in vivo and in vitro data by examining the conditions of the in vitro preparation. COPI vesicles were purified exactly as described by Rothman et al. (<a href=\"#bib38\">Malhotra et al., 1989</a>). Their study used the non-hydrolysable GTP analogue GTP\u03b3S to increase the yield of vesicles in vitro. It was later shown, however, that GTP\u03b3S also affects the sorting of cargo into vesicles (<a href=\"#bib32\">Lanoix et al., 1999</a>). We thus examined the effects of GTP\u03b3S, and we show here that while COPI-coated vesicles that are formed in the presence of GTP\u03b3S contained significant levels of albumin, those that are formed in the absence of GTP\u03b3S were depleted of albumin, in line with our in vivo data. The exclusion of soluble proteins from vesicles has been reported before (e.g., of proinsulin from KDEL-receptor-containing vesicles; [<a href=\"#bib57a\">Orci et al., 1997</a>]); however, the mechanism of exclusion remains unclear. Experimental details: Golgi membranes were isolated from rat liver ('Materials and methods') and treated with (<b>A</b>) or without (<b>B</b> and <b>C</b>) GTP\u03b3S, as described by Rothman and colleagues (<a href=\"#bib38\">Malhotra et al., 1989</a>). The Golgi membranes were then pelleted, and processed for cryoimmuno-EM and labeled with an anti-albumin antibody. After GTP\u03b3S treatment, albumin can be seen in COPI vesicular profiles (round, 50\u201360 nm in diameter) (<b>A</b>, arrows), while in the absence of GTP\u03b3S, the vesicles (less numerous) were not labeled for albumin (<b>B</b> and <b>C</b>; arrows). In both cases, albumin was concentrated in large pleomorphic structures, which were probably cisternal remnants.

(<b>A</b>) The concave part of the bent membrane appears to be clearly continuous across two successive cisternae. Moreover, the position of the albumin-associated gold particles distributed along the bend (please note that albumin is inside a tubule here, even if part of the convex tubular membrane is not clearly visualized), as well as the general disposition of the cisterna are clearly consistent with the presence of a connecting albumin-filled tubule.

(<b>B</b>) Here, the tubular loop is clearly visible, but its continuity with the cisternae in the stack is not visible probably due to the brighter areas (asterisks) caused by heterogeneous UA-methylcellulose deposition. (<b>C</b>) Here, the tubular loop exhibits a convex membrane (black arrow) connected to the lower cisterna in the stack. The membrane on the concave side of the tubular bridge (black arrowhead) and its connection to the upper cisterna in the stack are less evident, probably due to their oblique orientation with respect to the section plane.

In random, thin sections for immuno-EM, tubules appear as elongated variably oriented tubular\u2013ovoidal profiles in the vicinity of the stack ('Materials and methods'). These profiles contained albumin at a similar density to that seen in the cisternae (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>, arrowheads, quantified in K), independently of their orientation (parallel or perpendicular to the plane of the cisternae) (see below). For comparison, we also examined VSVG. This cargo has been previously shown to be depleted in Golgi vesicles and, to a lesser extent, in tubules (<a href=\"#bib84\">Trucco et al., 2004</a>). We confirmed that VSVG is lower in both vesicular and tubular peri-Golgi profiles than in cisternae (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We then attempted to visualize albumin in complete vertical tubular connections. This experiment presented serious difficulties because: (a) most connections are convoluted and cannot be included in single thin sections; and, (b) even relatively \u2018linear\u2019 continuities are very unlikely to be cut through their entire length at random (here, a reasonable expectation is that less than one connection may be found in hundred sections, assuming six connections per stack [<a href=\"#bib40\">Marsh et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib84\">Trucco et al., 2004</a>]). An additional difficulty is that the tubular membranes are often cut obliquely at some point along their length, resulting in defective membrane visualization. We sought to overcome these problems by (a) cutting several hundreds of individual thin sections, as well as several serial sections, to find at least a few complete inter-cisternal connections, and, (b) combining tomography with albumin labeling by photo-oxidation and cryo-immuno EM. Using the first approach, we succeeded in visualizing a few tubular connections (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplements 2 and 3</a>) that showed continuity across heterologous cisternae (see legend to these figures). These connections contained albumin at roughly the same level as in cisternae (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplements 2 and 3</a>). Moreover, the tomography- and photooxidation-based approaches (<a href=\"#bib45\">Meiblitzer-Ruppitsch et al., 2008</a>) also indicated that albumin is present in the connecting tubules (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplements 3 and 4</a>)."

Each stack contained 4 to 6 cisternae, each with a diameter of 1.5 microns and a thickness of 30 nm. The vesicles were spherical, with a diameter of 50\u201370 nm. The simulations started with only the first cisterna filled with albumin (black), and all the others empty (white). Albumin transport is considered to proceed stepwise, where each step is defined as one vesicle detaching from each cisterna and fusing with an adjacent one. The albumin concentration in the vesicles is always assumed to be the same as in the cisterna from where they originated. The albumin concentration in the various cisternae is expressed as a function of the numbers of steps (per cisterna, as defined above). Two scenarios were considered. (<b>A</b>) In the first, cargo is exchanged between the neighboring cisternae by anterograde as well as retrograde vesicles. This means that the first and last cisternae exchange one vesicle each at every step, while the other cisternae exchange two vesicles. This is required for the cisternal volumes to be kept constant. In this simulation, 50% and 90% equilibrium were reached after 3948 and 8846 steps per cisterna, respectively (for comparison, 282 and 933 steps are required for 50% and 90% equilibrium across only two cisternae). For larger vesicles with diameters of 60 nm and 70 nm 90% equilibrium is reached with fewer steps (5119 and 3224, respectively). However, experimental observations indicate a range of vesicle diameter from 50 nm to 70 nm, so for our calculations described below we considered the vesicle diameter to be 60 nm. (<b>B</b>) The second scenario represents the steady-state situation where only anterograde transport vesicles are considered. Here, in each step, one vesicle detaches from each cisterna and fuses with the next one. The volume constancy of the system is maintained by a vesicle coming into the first cisterna at each step (containing the same albumin concentration as the first cisterna), and by an identical vesicle exiting the last cisterna. Here, 50% and 90% equilibrium are reached after 3785 and 6474 steps using 50 nm diameter vesicles (compared to 563 and 1865 steps for only two cisternae).

Our own observations indicate that the concentration of albumin in the vesicles is 20% of that present in cisterna (see <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>), so approximately 25,000 steps per cisterna are needed for 90% equilibration of albumin across the stack. Since such equilibration happens in less than 2 min (we consider 2 min here, for simplicity), each cisterna has to bud (and fuse with) close to 12,500 vesicles per min or about 200 per s. Based on these numbers one can calculate the turnover of a cisternal rim assuming that: (<b>A</b>) the diameter of an \u2018ideal\u2019 cisterna in the mammalian Golgi to be 1500 nm, and therefore the perimeter of the cisterna to be approximately 4700 nm, and, (<b>B</b>) vesicles are formed from the whole perimeter (or rim) of the cisterna, then a maximum of 78 vesicles of 60 nm diameter (4700/60) can bud from the rim of each cisterna at any given time. Thus, the budding (and fusing) of 78 vesicles can be considered one event of turnover of the cisternal rim. Thus, a rim, in order to produce 12,500 vesicles per min, has to turnover (12,500/78) 160 times per min i.e., once every 400 ms, or in other words, the rim turns over 2.5 times per second. On varying the diameter of the vesicle from 50 to 70 nm this value ranges from 4 to 2 times per second for a stack with 6 cisternae (see <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a> for the results of these calculations). Since the typical Golgi of the HeLa cells that we used for live imaging studies contained 4 cisternae, we also simulated vesicle-mediated transport across such a Golgi. Based on the results of this simulation described earlier, the calculated turnover rate of cisternal rims varies between 2 and 1 times per second for a stack with 4 cisternae (see <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). Thus for a range of parameters used for the simulation (variations in number of cisterna, vesicle diameter and bidirectional or unidirectional vesicle transport), the calculated turnover time of a cisternal rim ranges between 250 and 1000 ms (see <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>) i.e., turnover of the cisternal rims ranges from 4 to 1 times per second."

The life cycle of a COPI-dependent vesicle is schematically comprised of the following steps: exchange of GDP/GTP on Arf, association of Arf-GTP and COPI with the membrane of cisternal rims, budding, fission, and uncoating of the vesicle (which is initiated by GTP hydrolysis on Arf and the consequent dissociation of Arf from the vesicle membrane), and then docking and fusion of the vesicle with the next cisterna. At the uncoating stage, Arf and COPI are shed from the vesicle and become cytosolic. Thus, the on- and off-rate of Arf/COPI at the Golgi (or at least of the portion of Arf/COPI that is involved in forming vesicles at the rims) should reflect the overall turnover of the vesicles. Hence, if the rimmal membrane turns over (i.e., turns into vesicles and fuses with an equivalent number of vesicles) 2.5 times per second, then the portion of Arf/COPI coat that is located at the rims should cycle, i.e., detach from (and attach to) the rim membrane at the same rate, namely, 2.5 times per second. As noted, these considerations are valid only for the fraction of Arf and COPI that participate in vesicle formation at the rim, rather than for the total Golgi Arf and COPI pool; however, the available evidence indicates that a sizable fraction of the Golgi-associated Arf/COPI is located at the cisternal rims (<a href=\"#bib56\">Oprins et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib88\">Weidman, 1995</a>). Hence, a substantial portion of the Golgi-associated Arf/COPI pool would be predicted by the vesicular model of albumin transport to associate with and detach from the rimmal membrane 2.5 times per second. Hence, the vesicular model of albumin transport predicts that a substantial portion of Golgi-associated Arf/COPI pool would associate with and detach from the rimmal membrane 2.5 times per second."

It turns out that the Arf/COPI dissociation/association rate at the Golgi is mono-exponential with a half time of 15 s for Arf and 35 s for COPI, and that similar values apply to the dissociation of Arf/COPI in the presence of BFA (<a href=\"#bib68\">Presley et al., 2002</a>). These rates are orders of magnitude slower than those predicted by the vesicular model of albumin transport (notably, the process underlying these slow rates remains unclear [<a href=\"#bib68\">Presley et al., 2002</a>]).

For modeling, the initial luminal pH was set to be identical to the cytosolic pH (set at 7.0). When the pumps start working (activity of pumps: 10 protons/s in total; modeled on four pumps), the proton concentration in the lumen of the <i>trans</i>-most cisterna (cisterna 1) starts increasing locally. Protons then start diffusing towards the <i>cis</i>-Golgi pole (cisterna 6). Their diffusion is slowed down by the proton buffering system (proteins and lipids). The diffusion coefficient for protons here is set to 10 \u00b5m<sup>2</sup>/s (for comparison: diffusion coefficient for protons in bulk water is 9.3 \u00d7 10<sup>3</sup> \u00b5m<sup>2</sup>/s [<a href=\"#bib64\">Pines et al., 1988</a>]). Moreover, as the protons move, they encounter the proton channels present in cisternae 2 to 6, through which they can leak out into the extra-luminal space, resulting in a pH gradient across the Golgi stack. The rate of leakage is assumed to be linearly dependent on the difference between the proton concentrations in the lumen and in the cytosol (zero leakage for an internal pH of 7.0, and a leakage of 1.4 protons/s/channel for an internal pH of 6.0; the model assumes two channels per cisterna).

The kinetic evidence, which consists of the observation that albumin traverses the stack in less than 2 min, at least fivefold to sixfold faster than PC, is consistent with diffusional transport, a fast process over short distances. It cannot, however, exclude in principle a role for other (potentially) rapid transport processes such as intercisternal shuttling by COPI-derived vesicles (<a href=\"#bib60\">Pelham and Rothman, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Presley et al., 2002</a>). Thus, further discriminating evidence is required. The morphological experiments show that Golgi vesicles are depleted (80%) of albumin while Golgi intercisternal tubules appear to contain albumin at similar levels as those seen in cisternae. Published biochemical studies concur with this depletion in vesicles (<a href=\"#bib17\">Dahan et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Sonnichsen et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Gilchrist et al., 2006</a>) indicating that the observed depletion is not an artifact of reduced epitope presentation in the vesicles. These observations therefore favor a role for tubular continuities, over vesicles, in albumin transport. Clearly, the albumin depletion in vesicles is difficult to reconcile with the extreme efficiency of the intra-Golgi albumin transport. Moreover, computational models of intra-Golgi transport by diffusion show that tubules, even when very few and transient, are sufficient to mediate the observed fast rate of albumin transport through the stack. Instead, models of vesicular transport show that Golgi vesicles would have to form and fuse at rates of hundreds of vesicles per cisterna per second, and hence that cisternal rims would have to turnover several times per second, to mediate albumin transport (see legend to <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a> for a detailed discussion of this point). These computational results appear difficult to reconcile with at least two lines of experimental evidence: (a) with such rates of vesicle formation/fusion, there should be morphological signs of such an enormous activity; however, cisternae look quiet, with fairly rare images of budding or fusion; and, (b) if cisternal rims turned over a few times per second as a result of vesicle budding, then the vesicular coat protein COPI (or at least a substantial subpopulation of COPI) should cycle on and off the Golgi complex at similar rates, i.e., roughly three times per second; however, the half-time of COPI dissociation from the Golgi complex is roughly 35 s in live cells (<a href=\"#bib68\">Presley et al., 2002</a>). Finally, the vesicle turnover rates calculated to be required for albumin transport are orders of magnitude higher than those experimentally observed for any other type of coated vesicles at any cellular location including endocytic vesicles (about 2 pinocytic vesicles per second per macrophage cell [<a href=\"#bib82\">Steinman et al., 1976</a>]) or fast neuronal synapses that form close to 1\u201315 endocytic vesicles per second per synapse (<a href=\"#bib69\">Rink et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Fernandez-Alfonso and Ryan, 2006</a>) or COPII vesicles (about 0.3 vesicles per exit site per second [<a href=\"#bib83\">Thor et al., 2009</a>])."

At the same time, non-diffusible cargoes that cannot enter intercisternal tubules (such as PC-I) traverse the stack slowly, by progression\u2013maturation (<a href=\"#bib50\">Mironov et al., 2001</a>). As noted earlier, continuity-mediated transport has been proposed to occur also in the endo-lysosomal pathway (<a href=\"#bib37\">Luzio et al., 2007</a>) and during the release of synaptic vesicles through flickering pores (<a href=\"#bib72\">Rizzoli and Jahn, 2007</a>) (<a href=\"#bib1\">Alabi and Tsien, 2013</a>)."

We suggest that each process optimizes the transport of different cargo classes endowed with specific physical properties. For instance, PC-I forms aggregates in the early Golgi (or earlier) and is efficiently transported in this condensed state by compartment progression. Albumin and possibly other abundant serum proteins, instead, move from the ER to the Golgi in a soluble state (<a href=\"#bib41\">Martinez-Menarguez et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Oprins et al., 2001</a>). Thus, once at the Golgi, these proteins diffuse rapidly via continuities away from the cis-Golgi towards the TGN, where they are concentrated and exported. Existence of different modes of transport possibly also gives the cell/organism flexibility to switch between modes of transport depending on the cargoes being transported in a certain physiological or developmental stage. For example, during the spermatid development there is a clear increase in the proliferation of intracisternal tubules (<a href=\"#bib86\">Vivero-Salmeron et al., 2008</a>) that we propose may coincide with an increase in the transport of cargoes that depend on diffusional mode of transport."

Several possibilities can be hypothesized. For instance, the collapse of connected cisternae may be prevented by scaffolds that maintain cisternal geometry, or it might actually tend to occur, but at a rate that is too slow compared to the half-life of transient continuities. Regarding domain segregation within continuous compartments, there are several known prior examples. They include the ER, with its rough and smooth domains (<a href=\"#bib80\">Sitia and Meldolesi, 1992</a>), the neuronal plasma membrane, with different compositions in the soma and dendrites (<a href=\"#bib11\">Bradke and Dotti, 2000</a>), and even the cytosol, where gradients of calcium and other second messengers are continuously created and maintained across different cytosolic regions (<a href=\"#bib92\">Zaccolo et al., 2002</a>). In most cases, the molecular basis for domain segregation is ill-understood, with a few possible exceptions (<a href=\"#bib92\">Zaccolo et al., 2002</a>). For the Golgi complex, multiple such domain-generating mechanisms might exist, and they might be based on: (a) the small size and the transiency of intercisternal tubules, which might act as filters by remaining open for a time sufficient for the passage of molecules such as albumin that would rapidly diffuse through the tubes, but not for that of larger molecules, such as lipid rafts, or protein clusters, which would be retarded by the small size and curvature of the tubes; (b) the arrival at the cis- and trans-Golgi poles of membranes of markedly different compositions and thicknesses from the ER and from endosomes, with the consequent creation of a cis-to-trans lipid compositional gradient through which Golgi resident enzymes may distribute differentially (<a href=\"#bib84\">Trucco et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Patterson et al., 2008</a>); (c) the action of cytosolic scaffolds to nucleate different domains in different cisternae; and, (d) the action of intralumenal buffering and pumping systems to create gradients of ions, such as calcium and protons, in a fashion similar to that described for cytosolic messengers (<a href=\"#bib44\">McCarron et al., 2006</a>) (a quantitative model of this last mechanism and a further discussion of diffusion via continuities are in <a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

Earlier biochemical and our own imaging studies have shown that small soluble cargoes are cleared from the cells quite rapidly and a pH gradient is necessary for such an efficient export (<a href=\"#bib91\">Yilla et al., 1993</a>) (our unpublished data). Moreover, we show that albumin is concentrated in the TGN (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>), and that this concentration most likely depends on the low TGN pH, as it is abolished by concanamycin, a specific inhibitor of the vacuolar proton pump that operates in the TGN (not shown). Thus, the pH-dependent concentration of albumin on the trans-side of the stack (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>) appears to be an important driving force for albumin export in that it imparts some sort of directionality to the movement of this cargo by increasing the probability of cargo molecules to localize in the TGN vs the CGN. Based on the above collective considerations and the current results, a hypothetical transport model for albumin might be delineated as follows: albumin reaches rapidly the Golgi from the ER, where it diffuses rapidly across the stack at a rate dependent on the number and transiency of the connections, accumulating in the low pH trans-Golgi compartments. This intra-Golgi equilibration of albumin is fast and hence unlikely to be rate-limiting for export out of the Golgi (differing in this regard from the slower transport of larger cargo such as PC-I which takes 10\u201315 min to cross and exit the stack). Rather, export is likely to depend on the rate of formation of the export carriers and on the concentration of albumin in these carriers, which, as noted, depends on the TGN pH. A notable consequence of this is that the export efficiency of other soluble cargoes might vary as a function of their propensity to concentrate in the TGN at low pH. The mechanism by which a low pH increases the albumin concentration in the TGN is unknown. On a speculative plane, at low pH, albumin might bind with increased affinity to a TGN protein or lipid, resulting in enhanced concentration and sorting into export carriers. Under these conditions albumin might also tend to self-aggregate, increasing concentration, and sorting efficiency. Interestingly, under the vesicular transport model, concentration in the TGN could be achieved by directional vesicle-mediated transport in a pH-independent way. Thus, the fact that export is pH-dependent is a further indication in favor of the diffusion-based mechanism."

Clearly, the trafficking of large non-diffusible cargoes (e.g., PC-I) and that of soluble proteins (e.g., albumin) is explained in a simple way by the above dual transport scheme. The case of VSVG, a trimeric transmembrane protein, is more complex, in that this cargo has been reported to either progress gradually through the stack like PC-I (here and <a href=\"#bib50\">Mironov et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib84\">Trucco et al., 2004</a>), or to spread rapidly from cis to trans cisternae like albumin (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bergmann and Singer, 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Patterson et al., 2008</a>), depending on experimental conditions. Here, a simple explanation would be that this dual behavior might depend on the ability of VSVG to exist in two states, an \u2018aggregated\u2019 one, in which it would form large clusters that behave like PC-I (as proposed by others <a href=\"#bib29\">Griffiths et al., 1985</a>), and a diffusible one (mono/oligomers) that behaves like albumin. Under this assumption, which remains to be verified, also the dual behavior of VSVG could be accommodated by our two-mechanisms scheme."

Nevertheless, evidence that multiple cargo transfer strategies are used in the secretory and endo-lysosomal pathways is emerging (<a href=\"#bib37\">Luzio et al., 2007</a>) and the observation of different cargo transport rates for different cargoes (<a href=\"#bib8\">Boncompain et al., 2012</a>) concurs well with the notion of multiple transport mechanisms. It is unclear whether the mechanisms so far described represent the full range of the existing transport strategies. The complete scenario will probably emerge through studies of further cargoes and trafficking steps in suitable cell types. Highly secreting cells, including certain cancer lines, might preferentially use one rather than another traffic mechanism. Uncovering the diversity of the trafficking modes will enhance our ability to understand and selectively manipulate different cargo classes, for research or therapy purposes."

To determine the rate of GFP-albumin entry into the Golgi complex from the ER at steady-state, the Golgi area was photobleached and the rate of fluorescence recovery into this area was monitored. It is known that after photobleaching, GFP can recover its original conformation and fluorescence, albeit partially and slowly. To verify whether this phenomenon might contribute to the Golgi FRAP and thus \u2018contaminate\u2019 the signal due to GFP-albumin entry into the Golgi complex, we bleached whole cells and monitored the recovery of fluorescence. This recovery was low and contributed to less than 5% of the Golgi FRAP during the time-scale of the experiments. For each cell, the intensity of the Golgi area was recorded and normalized to the intensity of the whole cell, to account for the overall intensity loss during bleaching. The same approach was used to measure the diffusion of albumin along the Golgi ribbon. Since the rate of diffusion of albumin along the Golgi ribbon was an order of magnitude faster than the ER to Golgi transport of albumin (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), we have assumed that the contribution of the latter is negligible.

The standard Zeiss value for background is arbitrarily set at 40% of the peak value, but this can be changed to reduce overlap between channels. This method was used in parallel with immuno-EM and stereology experiments, and gave results that were in good agreement with the immuno-EM data. Note that because of the resolution limit of the optical system, with this method the degree of overlap calculated between the Golgi markers themselves (GM130 and TGN46, which are in reality completely segregated in the cis-Golgi and the TGN, respectively) is about 20% in HepG2 cells under optimal conditions. This means that the calculated distribution of GM130 itself between the cis-Golgi and the TGN is about 80% in the cis-Golgi and 20% in the TGN. Vice versa, TGN46 is calculated to be about 20% in the cis-Golgi and 80% in the TGN. This defines the maximal dynamic range of the method: a cargo moving from the cis-Golgi to the TGN will shift from a GM130/TGN46 ratio of about 80/20 (in the cis-Golgi) to a ratio of 20/80 (in the TGN). This applies to HepG2 and HeLa cells; however, under specific conditions (i.e., when the Golgi complex is fragmented into separated stacks, and especially in some stacks, which are presumably those oriented with cisternal planes parallel to the beam), the resolution between GM130 and TGN46 can be greater."

(1993)</a>, using the MATLAB software (The MathWorks, Inc., R2006b). Briefly, an optical section taken through the center of the Golgi region was recorded and the intensities of the cis-Golgi and trans-Golgi markers and of the cargo were normalized to the maximum of the corresponding channel for each pixel. To calculate three-color co-localizations, i.e., the co-localization of cargo with each of the <i>cis</i>-Golgi and trans-Golgi markers, the intensity distributions were interpreted as probability distributions for the specific markers. Thus, the probability for a cargo protein to co-localize with a cis-Golgi or <i>trans-</i>Golgi marker was calculated for each pixel by multiplying the normalized intensities: <i>p</i><sub><i>i,cis</i></sub> <i>= I</i><sub><i>i,cargo</i></sub> <i>I</i><sub><i>i,cis</i></sub> and <i>p</i><sub><i>i,trans</i></sub> <i>= I</i><sub><i>i,cargo</i></sub> <i>I</i><sub><i>i,trans</i></sub> , where <i>I</i><sub><i>i,cargo</i></sub>, <i>I</i><sub><i>i,cis</i></sub> , and <i>I</i><sub><i>i,trans</i></sub> are the intensities of the cargo, and the cis-Golgi and trans-Golgi markers at the <i>i</i>-th pixel, normalized to the corresponding maximum intensity. The sums of all of the <i>p</i><sub><i>i,cis</i></sub> and the <i>p</i><sub><i>i,trans</i></sub> values represent the degree of co-localization of the cargo with the cis-Golgi and trans-Golgi markers, respectively. Using this method, the degree of overlap calculated between the Golgi markers themselves (GM130 and TGN46, which are in reality completely segregated in the cis-Golgi and the TGN, respectively) is about 30%. This means that the calculated distribution of GM130 itself between cis-Golgi and TGN is about 70% in the cis-Golgi and 30% in the TGN, and vice versa for TGN46 (see above). This method was also tested by comparing the GFP-albumin distribution in HeLa cells at steady-state as determined by this method, with that seen by immuno-EM. The degree of co-localization by method 2 of GFP-albumin with TGN46 was about 80% higher than with GM130 in good qualitative agreement with the immuno-EM data (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

Correlative light-electron microscopy was performed as described previously (<a href=\"#bib65\">Polishchuk et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib85\">van Rijnsoever et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Mironov and Beznoussenko, 2013</a>). All samples were analyzed under a Philips Tecnai-12 electron microscope (FEI/Philips Electron Optics, Eindhoven). High-pressure freezing of samples was carried out according to <a href=\"#bib55\">Nicolas et al. (1989)</a>. For samples from rat liver, CD-COBS Charles River rats were anesthetized with Nembutal and sacrificed. Liver slices were fixed by immersion in 1% gluteraldehyde in 0.15 M HEPES (pH 7.2) for 1 hr and then post-fixed with 1% reduced OsO<sub>4</sub> for 2 hr on ice. For cultured cells, cryo-immuno-EM, cryosections of HepG2 cells were prepared and immunolabeled with antibodies against albumin, antitrypsin, GM130 and TGN46, and then analyzed as previously described (<a href=\"#bib50\">Mironov et al., 2001</a>). Quantification of albumin, antitrypsin and VSVG labeling within the Golgi stacks was performed using the Analysis software (Soft Imaging Software Corporation; <a href=\"#bib52\">Mironov and Mironov, 1998</a>). In studies of intra-Golgi transport, the number of gold particles were counted per cisterna in 30 stacks per time point (per experiment, in at least four experiments), and normalized to the value in the ER. This normalization was necessary to reduce the labeling variability between different sections and experiments. The TGN was defined as ribosome-less, tubular-reticular membranes adjacent to the trans-Golgi cisternae that were positive for TGN46 labeling. The IC elements were defined as clusters of tubular-vesicular membranes located near the <i>cis</i> side of a stack that were positive for ERGIC53. Vesicles were defined as round profiles adjacent (lateral) to Golgi cisternae and not exceeding 65 nm in diameter, a feature of COPI-derived vesicles. Golgi tubules were defined as elongated membrane profiles with length:width ratios of at least 1.5. For electron tomography, the analysis of intercisternal connections in chemically and cryo-fixed samples was performed on 200-nm-thick sections, passing roughly perpendicularly to the center of the Golgi stack, as described previously (<a href=\"#bib84\">Trucco et al., 2004</a>). The numbers of intercisternal connections were counted in single tomograms and varied between 0 and 2 per tomogram. Because the average volume of each Golgi section represented approximately 20% of the total stack volume (conservatively assuming \u2018idealized\u2019 stacks made of round cisternae of about 1 micron in diameter), the number of connections detected in each tomogram was multiplied by five to obtain the total number of connections per stack. At least five tomograms were analyzed per experimental condition. Surfaces of Golgi membranes were rendered using the IMOD software (<a href=\"http://bio3d.colorado.edu/imod/\">http://bio3d.colorado.edu/imod/</a>)."

Then, cells immersed into DAB solution (still kept at 4\u00b0C) were placed under the LSM510 laser scanning confocal microscope (Zeiss) and an area of the Golgi complex exhibiting GFP fluorescence was irradiated with laser-derived blue (405 nm wave length) light with maximal intensity. After each scan of the light beam, there was at least a 10 s interval, allowing DAB to diffuse to the site of bleaching. When the fluorescent intensity of GFP emanating from the irradiated area had disappeared, we checked whether the expected brownish DAB precipitate was visible over the irradiated Golgi area. If a modest brownish staining was visible, cells were processed for EM using reduced OsO<sub>4</sub> and thiocarbohydrazide. Finally, 200 nm sections were subjected to electron tomography. For photo-oxidation experiments following FRAP studies, the Golgi region of the HeLa cells transfected with GFP tagged constructs was photobleached in the presence of culture medium and then after appropriate recovery time, the cells were fixed and subjected to photooxidation as above."

The major question left unresolved by this work is the mechanism by which cisternal continuities between adjacent Golgi compartments form and resolve. A further question is how this occurs without collapse and mixing of the two compartments to generate one larger compartment. Please acknowledge and discuss."

The diffuse staining, possibly ER as the authors mention, does not seem to be reduced and accounts for the bulk of the signal while only a small proportion overlaps with Golgi markers. This suggests that albumin trafficking is not particularly efficient and only a subpopulation is being transported to the Golgi. These conditions are used for the immunoelectron microscopy, so this is a problem for all the data shown.

This isn't well integrated with the rest of the work. The assumptions are not properly described in the text, and exactly what testable predictions the modeling generates is unclear. Why does VSV G not diffuse through cisternal continuities as rapidly as soluble cargo? From what I can tell the modeling is a simplification of the 3D membrane architecture of the Golgi to 2D, so surface area to volume ratio is not correctly accounted for. What are the absolute concentrations of albumin, VSV G and PC in the system? My concern is that albumin levels are much higher than the other markers, and this may explain some of the differences seen."

However, it seems to me that the export will then be very slow if no additional hypothesis is used to impose that the diffusion is biased in the anterograde direction. Otherwise, the cargo will always be homogeneously distributed in all cisternae and emptying the Golgi would be very slow. The authors mention pH gradient but without really using this as driving force. In addition, not all cargo may be sensitive to the pH gradient that exists in the Golgi. The authors should take this in account in their simulations and try to estimate the exit time (e.g. time need to empty 90% of the Golgi) of small and large cargo in the absence of biased diffusion. They should discuss this point."

Carrying out a photo-bleaching experiment to compare the kinetics of intra Golgi diffusion of small and large cargos may help to control for this in physiological conditions."

In order to achieve this, we need to consider that the scope of our models is limited. The models only aim to assess the equilibration rates of small soluble cargoes across a closed system with a stack-like geometry, and in particular to compare two possibilities: a) cargo equilibration through the stack by diffusion via continuities and b) equilibration via shuttling vesicles. Importantly, the models do not aim to simulate the entire traffic process through the Golgi including cargo arrival, departure and intra-Golgi concentration steps. Given these limitations, we feel that it would be difficult for a reader to grasp the significance of these models without first providing the appropriate experimental background. Rather, we think that the best way to use the models in this manuscript is to go through the following logical steps:"

The results show that, under steady state conditions, the newly recovered fluorescence of albumin (immediately after photobleaching), that represents newly arrived cargo from the ER at the Golgi apparatus, can be seen to spread throughout the Golgi (as determined from the overlap of albumin with both GM130 and TGN46), while in the case of PC, it is mainly restricted to the cis side of the Golgi. We think that such an overlap is fairly compelling evidence that the albumin traverses the Golgi stack faster than PC even under steady state conditions.

Instead, under the conditions we use for synchronization (40-15-32\u00b0C), VSVG exhibits a transport behavior similar to that of PC, possibly because it forms oligomers/polymers (<a href=\"#bib29\">Griffiths et al., 1985</a>) that behave like PC during the 15\u00b0C block (<a href=\"#bib50\">Mironov et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib84\">Trucco et al., 2004</a>).

As noted in the text, the transport kinetics of antitrypsin are indistinguishable from those of albumin. The conditions of immunoprecipitation were such that the proteins were completely depleted. One can notice that the amounts of antitrypsin and VSVG are similar (in terms of radioactive counts or here intensity of the protein bands), suggesting that the antitrypsin is not present in much higher levels than VSVG. Therefore, the difference between their kinetic behaviors is not due to the different abundance of VSVG and antitrypsin and, by extension, of albumin. We have now included the following phrase in the legend to <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2013figure supplement 2</a>: it is important to note here that the quantities of antitrypsin and VSVG present are very similar suggesting that the difference in the transport behavior of these proteins is not due to differences in their abundance. In addition, as mentioned in the text, the transport behaviors of antitrypsin and albumin are similar, reiterating further that the differences in the transport behavior between soluble secretory cargoes (albumin and antitrypsin) and VSVG/PC is possibly not due to the differences in their abundance."
