Free or bound to ligands, polyubiquitins are found in different arrangements of ubiquitin subunits. To understand the structural basis for polyubiquitin quaternary plasticity and to explore the target recognition mechanism, we characterize the conformational space of Lys63-linked diubiquitin (K63-Ub<sub>2</sub>). Refining against inter-subunit paramagnetic NMR data, we show that free K63-Ub<sub>2</sub> exists as a dynamic ensemble comprising multiple closed and open quaternary states. The quaternary dynamics enables K63-Ub<sub>2</sub> to be specifically recognized in a variety of signaling pathways. When binding to a target protein, one of the preexisting quaternary states is selected and stabilized. A point mutation that shifts the equilibrium between the different states modulates the binding affinities towards K63-Ub<sub>2</sub> ligands. This conformational selection mechanism at the quaternary level may be used by polyubiquitins of different lengths and linkages for target recognition."

Free or bound to ligands, polyubiquitins are found in different arrangements of ubiquitin subunits. To understand the structural basis for polyubiquitin quaternary plasticity and to explore the target recognition mechanism, we characterize the conformational space of Lys63-linked diubiquitin (K63-Ub<sub>2</sub>). Refining against inter-subunit paramagnetic NMR data, we show that free K63-Ub<sub>2</sub> exists as a dynamic ensemble comprising multiple closed and open quaternary states. The quaternary dynamics enables K63-Ub<sub>2</sub> to be specifically recognized in a variety of signaling pathways. When binding to a target protein, one of the preexisting quaternary states is selected and stabilized. A point mutation that shifts the equilibrium between the different states modulates the binding affinities towards K63-Ub<sub>2</sub> ligands. This conformational selection mechanism at the quaternary level may be used by polyubiquitins of different lengths and linkages for target recognition."

Structural studies of Lys63-linked diubiquitin (K63-Ub<sub>2</sub>) have indicated that K63-Ub<sub>2</sub> mostly adopts open extended conformations in the absence of a ligand and in complex with many target proteins (<a href=\"#bib8\">Datta et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Komander et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Sato et al., 2009a</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Weeks et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Sekiyama et al., 2012</a>). It has been proposed that such an open extended structure differentiates K63-Ub<sub>2</sub> from Lys48-linked polyubiquitin that predominantly exists in a closed structure (<a href=\"#bib45\">Varadan et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Fushman and Walker, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Hirano et al., 2011</a>).

K63-Ub<sub>2</sub> is also selectively recognized by the fourth zinc-finger (ZnF4) of A20, a ubiquitin-editing enzyme for the termination of NF-\u03baB signaling (<a href=\"#bib50\">Wertz, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Wertz and Dixit, 2014</a>). The crystal structure of the complex between ZnF4 and ubiquitin monomer indicated that K63-Ub<sub>2</sub> likely exists in a closed conformation when binding to ZnF4 (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bosanac et al., 2010</a>). So are the closed-state structures already present for the free K63-Ub<sub>2</sub>, but have hitherto eluded structural characterization?

We also performed a half-filtered NMR experiment, which failed to reveal any inter-subunit nuclear Overhauser effects (NOEs) between the proximal and distal units of K63-Ub<sub>2</sub>.

At relatively low protein concentration (50 \u00b5M), the inter-molecular contribution to the overall PRE is negligible. We found that the relative decreases in peak intensities between the paramagnetic and diamagnetic spectra recorded at 50 \u00b5M are highly correlated with the relative decreases between the paramagnetic and inter-molecular spectra recorded at 500 \u00b5M (<a href=\"#fig1s5\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5</a>).

The <i>D</i><sub>max</sub> values are smaller than the calculated values for all known open-state structures (84.0 \u00b1 3.3 \u00c5). Significantly, the experimental paired-distance distribution function <i>P</i>(r) at 1 mM is much narrower than those computed for the known open-state structures, with a large probability of distribution at \u223c30 \u00c5 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Further, the theoretical scattering profiles for the open-state structure models (<a href=\"#fig1s8\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 8</a>) all differ from the experiment curve (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>)."

The linker between the two subunits (Lys63 side chain in the proximal unit and C-terminal flexible residues 72\u201376 of the distal unit) was given full torsional freedom. A grid search was performed by varying the number of conformers representing the closed state (from a single conformer to a five-conformer ensemble), and by varying the overall population of the closed state (from 10% to 90%). A single-conformer representation for the closed state does not satisfy the inter-subunit PREs, as assessed by the PRE Q-factor (<a href=\"#bib17\">Iwahara et al., 2004</a>). This means that the closed state of ligand-free K63-Ub<sub>2</sub> should exist in multiple conformations. The PRE Q-factor rapidly decreases as the number of conformers representing the closed state increases, and levels off with four or more conformers (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). On the other hand, a closed-state population of at least 30% is required to achieve a good fit to the PRE data (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). For reasons that will be discussed below, the population of the K63-Ub<sub>2</sub> closed state is about 70%. At a 70% population for the closed state with a four-conformer representation, the back-calculated PREs agree well with the experimental ones, affording a PRE Q-factor of 0.22 and correlation coefficient of 0.94 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1, 3B</a>). Importantly, the two paramagnetic conjugation sites, N25C and K48C, provide cross-validating PRE measurements\u2014when refining the ensemble structure of the K63-Ub<sub>2</sub> closed state against the N25C data alone, the PRE values predicted for the K48C site largely agree with the experimental values, affording a free Q-factor of 0.46 (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

Upon reducing the dimensionality, we found that the closed-state structures exist in two clusters, namely C1 and C2 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). For each four-conformer structure, one of the conformers falls into C2, while the other three are in C1. The proximal unit of ligand-free K63-Ub<sub>2</sub> utilizes distinct interfaces to interact with the distal unit in C1 and C2 states (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,C</a>), affording buried solvent-accessible surface areas of 283.9 \u00b1 139.7 \u00c5<sup>2</sup> and 200.5 \u00b1 59.6 \u00c5<sup>2</sup>, respectively.

As C1 is represented with multiple conformers, it is possible to further partition the closed state into more conformational states. As the ligand-bound closed structures are similar to ligand-free structures of K63-Ub<sub>2</sub> in either C1 or C2 state, a cognate ligand of K63-Ub<sub>2</sub> can be preferentially recognized and accommodated into one of the preexisting conformations. As there are some differences between the ligand-free and ligand-bound K63-Ub<sub>2</sub> in the closed state (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,C</a>), the binding may require some induced fit, especially towards the end of the binding process. On the other hand, the open-state conformation of K63-Ub<sub>2</sub> may specifically recognize its corresponding ligand like Rap80 tUIM (<a href=\"#bib40\">Sekiyama et al., 2012</a>) via a conformational selection mechanism."

To address this, we introduced a charge reversal mutation to residue Glu64 in the proximal unit, resulting an E64R<sub>P</sub> mutant of K63-Ub<sub>2</sub>. Glu64 is located at the interface between the two subunits in both C1 and C2 closed states, opposing the positively charged residues Arg72 and Arg74 in the distal unit (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We reasoned that this mutation should affect the conformational space of K63-Ub<sub>2</sub>. Indeed, the E64R<sub>P</sub> mutation results in chemical shift perturbations (CSPs) in the K63-Ub<sub>2</sub> distal unit (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Although the perturbations are small, almost the same residues are perturbed upon E64R<sub>P</sub> mutation as upon the covalent linkage of ubiquitin monomers (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). However, the NMR peaks for the perturbed residues in the mutant do not simply move in the direction towards the chemical shift values of the ubiquitin monomer. This can be either due to altered non-covalent interactions around the mutation site, or to a change in the relative population of the conformational states. Therefore, it is difficult to quantitate the CSPs in terms of K63-Ub<sub>2</sub> structural change."

On the other hand, the C1 and C2 closed states forfeit 0.71 \u00b1 0.08 kCal/mol and 0.23 \u00b1 0.09 kCal/mol in binding free energies, respectively.

Our findings disagree with many previous structural characterizations of K63-Ub<sub>2</sub> (<a href=\"#bib45\">Varadan et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Datta et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Dikic et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Komander et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Weeks et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Komander and Rape, 2012</a>), which reported that ligand-free K63-Ub<sub>2</sub> exists only in the open state. Nevertheless, the closed-state population is in line with our previous finding that ubiquitin monomer non-covalently dimerizes with an apparent <i>K</i><sub>D</sub> value of 4.9 \u00b1 0.3 mM (<a href=\"#bib26\">Liu et al., 2012</a>). In the non-covalent dimer of ubiquitin monomer, a ubiquitin adopts an array of orientations in respect to the other. With a covalent linkage, the non-covalent interaction between ubiquitin becomes intra-molecular and restricted. Therefore, a significant population of diubiquitin should exist in the closed compact conformation regardless of the ubiquitin linkage. Indeed, studies have indicated that K48-Ub<sub>2</sub> mainly exists in the closed state (<a href=\"#bib6\">Cook et al., 1992</a>, <a href=\"#bib7\">1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Phillips et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Varadan et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Eddins et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Hirano et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Ye et al., 2012</a>). For ligand-free K63-Ub<sub>2</sub>, however, only a recent single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) study has provided direct experimental evidence and indicated that the protein exists in a closed state at a population of \u223c75% (<a href=\"#bib53\">Ye et al., 2012</a>). Here, using paramagnetic NMR, SAXS, and mutational analysis, we found that the population of the closed state of ligand-free K63-Ub<sub>2</sub> is \u223c70%. But why have only open-state structures been reported for ligand-free K63-Ub<sub>2</sub>? A possible explanation is that the open-state structure is more readily captured owing to non-covalent interactions between neighboring unit cells, and becomes enriched during crystallization processes."

The PRE NMR provides 1/<i>r</i><sup>6</sup> ensemble-averaged distance information (<a href=\"#bib5\">Clore and Iwahara, 2009</a>). So the inverse problem is to determine the constituting conformational states that give rise to the ensemble-averaged PRE observables. Here by projecting the structures with spherical coordinates, we were able to visualize the distinct conformational states of ligand-free K63-Ub<sub>2</sub>. In comparison, the smFRET study on ligand-free K63-Ub<sub>2</sub> (<a href=\"#bib53\">Ye et al., 2012</a>) measured just a single distance between the N-terminus of the distal unit and the C-terminus of the proximal unit, and could not distinguish multiple closed states or provide a structural description for each state. Similarly, SAXS analysis is unable to reveal how two nearly globular proteins are docked to each other in atomic detail (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>)."

This suggests a conformational selection mechanism for K63-Ub<sub>2</sub> target recognition. This mechanism is further supported by conformational energy analysis. The inter-conversion between K63-Ub<sub>2</sub> conformational states and ligand binding are coupled equilibria, and the population for each conformational state weights on the binding affinity towards a respective ligand. For the interaction between K63-Ub<sub>2</sub> and tUIM, an open-state ligand, the change in binding free energy accompanying an E64R<sub>P</sub> mutation can be fully accounted for by the increase in the relative population of the open state. On the other hand, the change in conformational energy also accounts for the difference in binding affinities between wild type and mutant K63-Ub<sub>2</sub> towards closed-state ligands TAB2/TAB3 NZF and A20 ZnF4."

These structures are different from the C1 or C2 closed-state conformations of K63-Ub<sub>2</sub>, and therefore are involved in different functions. As such, a covalent ubiquitin linkage dictates how the two subunits non-covalently interact with each other in a diubiquitin, and resulting quaternary arrangements encode specific cell signals. For K63-Ub<sub>2</sub>, the open state recognizes tUIM of Rap80 and is involved in DNA damage repair, the C2 closed state recognizes the NZF domain of TAK1 binding proteins and is involved in the activation of NF-\u03baB signaling, while the C1 state recognizes the ZnF4 domain of A20 and is involved in the termination of NF-\u03baB signaling pathways (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>).

All three proteins were expressed in BL21 star cells in LB medium. The proteins were purified off a GST affinity column. With the GST tag removed by TEV protease, the proteins were further purified through a Sephacryl S100 column. For the purification of ZNF4 and NZF, the buffer also contains 5 mM DTT and 50 \u00b5M ZnCl<sub>2</sub>. All purified proteins were confirmed by electrospray mass spectrometry (Bruker Daltonics, Germany)."

After converting to heat per injection, the curves were fitted using a one-site binding model using Origin 8.1 software. All ITC titrations were performed at least four times. NMR titration of A20 ZnF4 was performed on the Bruker 850 MHz instrument at 303 K or 313 K, by titrating 50, 100, 150, 250, 350, or 450 \u00b5M ZnF4 into wild type or E64R<sub>P</sub> mutant K63-Ub<sub>2</sub> protein (distal unit <sup>15</sup>N-labeled). The exchange timescale at 313 K is faster than at 303 K, which allowed us to fit the binding isotherm from the chemical shift perturbations of residues at the ZnF4 binding interface."

At the same time, the closed-state population drops from \u223c70% to \u223c35%. Further, the ratio between C1 and C2 closed states can be determined at about 3:1 for the wild type K63-Ub<sub>2</sub>. Thus, upon the point mutation, the population of C1 state drops from 52.5% to 22.5 %, and the population of C2 state drops from 17.5% to 12.5 %, which correspond to conformational energy changes of 0.80 and 0.24 kCal/mol, respectively. Such changes are in line with the design of the E64R<sub>P</sub> mutant, and are also consistent with the relative decreases in PRE values."

Further, we deduced that there are at least two distinct closed states of ligand-free K63-Ub<sub>2</sub> at about 3:1 molar ratio, and the ligand-free structures are similar to the known ligand-bound structures. We linearly combined the back-calculated PREs for the two ligand-bound structures of K63-Ub<sub>2</sub> (PDB codes 3OJ3 and 2WX0) with scaling factors of 52.5% and 17.5% (molar ratio of 3:1 with a total population of 70%), respectively.

Among the two conjugation sites we used previously, K11C conjugated protein displays some chemical shift perturbations, and the bindings affinity towards tUIM is significantly increased. Finally, we identified N25C site at the distal unit that gives good inter-subunit PREs: conjugation of the paramagnetic probe at this site does not cause NMR chemical shift perturbations, nor affect the binding affinities towards K63-Ub<sub>2</sub> ligands. In addition, conjugation of a different kind of paramagnetic probe, EDTA-Mn<sup>2+</sup>, at N25C site, affords inter-subunit PREs of similar profile as the MTS probe. These control experiments are presented in <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2013figure supplement 3, 4, and 6</a> of the revised manuscript."
