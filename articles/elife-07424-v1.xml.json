To understand how chromosome folding accommodates transcription, we investigated the assembly of the axial element, the proteinaceous structure that compacts meiotic chromosomes and promotes recombination and fertility. We found that the axial element proteins of budding yeast are flexibly anchored to chromatin by the ring-like cohesin complex. The ubiquitous presence of cohesin at sites of convergent transcription provides well-dispersed points for axis attachment and thus chromosome compaction. Axis protein enrichment at these sites directly correlates with the propensity for recombination initiation nearby. A separate modulating mechanism that requires the conserved axial-element component Hop1 biases axis protein binding towards small chromosomes. Importantly, axis anchoring by cohesin is adjustable and readily displaced in the direction of transcription by the transcriptional machinery. We propose that such robust but flexible tethering allows the axial element to promote recombination while easily adapting to changes in chromosome activity."

To understand how chromosome folding accommodates transcription, we investigated the assembly of the axial element, the proteinaceous structure that compacts meiotic chromosomes and promotes recombination and fertility. We found that the axial element proteins of budding yeast are flexibly anchored to chromatin by the ring-like cohesin complex. The ubiquitous presence of cohesin at sites of convergent transcription provides well-dispersed points for axis attachment and thus chromosome compaction. Axis protein enrichment at these sites directly correlates with the propensity for recombination initiation nearby. A separate modulating mechanism that requires the conserved axial-element component Hop1 biases axis protein binding towards small chromosomes. Importantly, axis anchoring by cohesin is adjustable and readily displaced in the direction of transcription by the transcriptional machinery. We propose that such robust but flexible tethering allows the axial element to promote recombination while easily adapting to changes in chromosome activity."

In the sexually reproducing baker's yeast, axial elements contain three main proteins: cohesin, Hop1, and Red1, but it remains unclear how the entire structure is anchored to the underlying chromosomes. Furthermore, the genes encoded within the DNA of the compacted chromosomes remain active, but it is also not clear how this is possible. This is because the compacted structure would be expected to prevent the molecular machinery that expresses genes from accessing the DNA."

Sun, Huang et al. also observed that cohesin recruits Red1, which in turn, recruits Hop1, and that all three proteins physically interact with one another. These findings imply that it is cohesin that anchors the axial elements to the underlying chromosomes."

A key event in meiosis is the programmed recombination of homologous chromosomes, which ensures proper chromosome segregation during the first meiotic division and also provides genetic variation in the offspring. Homologous recombination events initiate with programmed DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) that are introduced by the topoisomerase-like enzyme Spo11. Upon endonucleolytic removal of Spo11 from break ends, a subset of DSBs are repaired by crossing-over thereby physically linking homologous chromosome pairs for segregation during meiosis I.

In <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> most DSBs occur within the chromatin loops, whereas axis association sites are cold for DSB formation (<a href=\"#bib3\">Blat et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Panizza et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Ito et al., 2014</a>).

Meiotic cohesin is not essential for chromosomal binding of Red1 and Hop1, but Red1 and Hop1 distribution is highly abnormal in cohesin mutants (<a href=\"#bib32\">Klein et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Panizza et al., 2011</a>). Notably, this phenotype is not due to a loss of sister chromatid cohesion, as axis protein distribution is largely normal on unreplicated chromosomes (<a href=\"#bib5\">Blitzblau et al., 2012</a>).

Red1 was reported to favor AT-rich segments on chromosome III at a resolution of 3 kb (<a href=\"#bib3\">Blat et al., 2002</a>), whereas Hop1 has preferential affinity for G-rich sequences and specific DNA topologies in vitro (<a href=\"#bib31\">Kironmai et al., 1998</a>). However, on meiotic chromosomes, Hop1 and Red1 binding coincides with cohesin binding sites and regular distribution of Hop1 requires cohesin (<a href=\"#bib44\">Panizza et al., 2011</a>), suggesting that cohesin is a major determinant of axis attachment sites. The yeast meiotic cohesin complex consists of Smc1, Smc3, Scc3, and the kleisin Rec8, which replaces the mitotic kleisin Scc1/Mcd1 (<a href=\"#bib32\">Klein et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Watanabe and Nurse, 1999</a>). Despite the different subunit composition, the cohesin-associated chromosomal sites are highly conserved between mitosis and meiosis (<a href=\"#bib2\">Blat and Kleckner, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Glynn et al., 2004</a>). A strong correlation between cohesin sites and regions of convergent transcription has been observed (<a href=\"#bib34\">Lengronne et al., 2004</a>), and changes in transcriptional activities can result in altered cohesin localization (<a href=\"#bib34\">Lengronne et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Bausch et al., 2007</a>). Because cohesin can encircle DNA from two sister-chromatids (<a href=\"#bib24\">Ivanov and Nasmyth, 2005</a>, <a href=\"#bib25\">2007</a>) it is hypothesized to be pushed along genes ahead of the RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) complex, thus accumulating at convergent regions (<a href=\"#bib42\">Ocampo-Hafalla and Uhlmann, 2011</a>). However, sliding has not been addressed in meiotic prophase, where cohesin may be stably incorporated in the axial element. Moreover, the mechanisms of meiotic axis protein loading and the functional link to cohesin remain to be elucidated."

We found that axis proteins dynamically accumulate between convergent genes in a distinctive two-peak pattern, which we demonstrate to be a direct consequence of the underlying transcriptional activity. We show that cohesin is responsible for this behavior and that Rec8 interacts closely with both axis proteins via Red1. In the absence of Rec8, Hop1 becomes essential for chromosomal Red1 recruitment, defining a cohesin-independent mode of axis protein recruitment. Intriguingly, Hop1 but not Rec8 is required for the preferential loading of Red1 to short chromosomes, possibly by preventing excess Red1 accumulation on large chromosomes and at centromeres. Our findings demonstrate that the well-dispersed binding and chromosome size-biased enrichment of axis proteins are controlled by two independent recruitment modes and provide important insight into the mechanistic hierarchy of meiotic axis assembly."

Significantly, Rec8 exhibited no such bias, suggesting that this chromosome-specific patterning of axis proteins is not dictated by Rec8 (see later sections). The enrichment of Red1 on small chromosomes mirrored a previously noted bias of average meiotic DSB levels, which are also highest on the three shortest chromosomes (<a href=\"#bib4\">Blitzblau et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Pan et al., 2011a</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Thacker et al., 2014</a>).

Most axis sites detected by ChIP-seq were broad, ranging from 1 to 3 kb (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). Spo11 cleavage activity, as determined by sequencing Spo11-associated DSB ends (Spo11 oligos), was strongly depleted in these sites (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1F</a>). This pattern further corroborates the notion that DSBs occur preferentially within loop regions that are not bound by axis proteins. As is the case with DSB hotspots, motif discovery did not yield strong consensus sequences associated with Red1 binding. A repetitive sequence pattern consisting of varying numbers of a 3-bp GAN unit was found modestly enriched at Red1 peaks (E-value = 6.6e-6), with maximal enrichment at the summits of Red1 peaks (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1G</a>, P-value = 5.0e-4). However, this motif was not predictive of Red1 binding and was only present in 16.1% (125/774) of Red1 peaks, indicating that DNA sequence is at best a minor determinant of axis protein binding."

We plotted the average Red1 binding signals with respect to all open reading frames (ORFs). We found that Red1 enrichment was significantly biased toward the ends of ORFs, reaching a summit in the 3\u2032 ends (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Consistent with the high signal density on short chromosomes, we found an overall elevated signal along genes situated on short chromosomes. To further interpret the enrichment of axis proteins at 3\u2032 ends of genes, we confined the analysis of binding peaks to 500 bp around Red1 summits. We found that 94.6% (732/774) of Red1 peaks were located at the 3\u2032 ends of genes (250 bp on either side of the stop codon; <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1H</a>). This bias contrasts with DSBs, which are predominantly detected at promoter regions (<a href=\"#bib4\">Blitzblau et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Pan et al., 2011a</a>). Moreover, the Red1 signals were strongly enriched within the intergenic regions of convergent gene pairs as compared to tandem gene pairs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1H</a>), a pattern previously described for cohesin-associated sites (<a href=\"#bib14\">Filipski and Mucha, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Lengronne et al., 2004</a>). Closer inspection of convergent gene pairs in two independently generated data sets revealed that the Red1 binding signal typically consisted of two peaks at convergent 3\u2032 ends, separated by a region of signal depletion (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). These data indicate that axis protein binding between convergent genes is subject to positional constraints."

One important feature of the compact yeast genome is that convergent intergenic regions are usually very short, and convergent transcripts frequently overlap (<a href=\"#bib12\">David et al., 2006</a>). Accordingly, our analysis of published meiotic mRNA-seq data (<a href=\"#bib10\">Brar et al., 2012a</a>) revealed that 79% of convergent transcript pairs exhibited overlapping 3\u2032 UTRs during the early stages of meiosis (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>). After ranking the convergent gene pairs according to the extent of overlap of their 3\u2032 UTRs, the presence and spacing of the two Red1 peaks appeared directly correlated with the amount of overlap. Gene pairs with an extensive overlap showed well-separated peaks, whereas gene pairs with little or no overlap exhibited a single peak at the midpoint of their intergenic regions (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Red1 binding was maximally enriched \u223c150 bp downstream of the 3\u2032 ends of the respective transcripts, a behavior also observed for cohesin subunits (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). To test for a possible role of nucleosomes in axis protein localization, we also plotted nucleosome occupancy (<a href=\"#bib43\">Pan et al., 2011a</a>). No overall correlation between nucleosome depletion and the gap between the axis protein binding signals was detected, although there was a decline of nucleosome density at a fraction of the convergent intergenic regions (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), indicating that nucleosomes do not position Red1.

We first extracted gene pairs in which both genes were highly expressed or both genes were lowly expressed and tested for differences in Red1 signals. This analysis revealed higher and more confined Red1 occupancy between two highly transcribing convergent genes than between gene pairs with less transcriptional activity (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>), indicating that ongoing transcription helps to focus axis proteins between convergent gene pairs. We also noted that the relative heights of the two Red1 peaks between a pair of convergent transcripts often differed substantially. Therefore, we sorted convergent gene pairs based on the relative transcriptional activity of the two genes. This analysis uncovered a strong reciprocal relationship between transcriptional strength and axis protein enrichment. In gene pairs with differential transcriptional activity, Red1 tends to accumulate downstream of the more highly expressed side. Accordingly, peaks of equal heights were present in gene pairs with similar transcriptional strengths. The reciprocal relationship was apparent both when average Red1 occupancy was calculated for six ranked quantiles and when the sorted gene pairs were displayed as a heatmap (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). This enrichment pattern suggests that axis proteins are not tightly bound to specific DNA sites but instead are focused between convergent genes driven by some aspect of their transcription."

                                "text": "To further test this possibility, we examined whether changing the level of gene expression is sufficient to alter Red1 binding patterns at axis association sites. We utilized the copper-inducible <i>CUP1</i> promoter (<i>pCUP1</i>) to drive the expressions of two genes: <i>GCY1</i> and <i>GAL2</i>. Both genes exhibit low transcriptional activities during early stages of sporulation and are located in convergent gene pairs, in which the convergently transcribed neighbor is more highly expressed. Two concentrations of copper (5 \u03bcM and 20 \u03bcM) were applied to induce different levels of expression during early meiosis. In wild-type control cells, the Red1 binding profile was skewed to the sides of the weakly transcribed <i>GCY1</i> and <i>GAL2</i> genes irrespective of copper concentrations (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,D</a> shows <i>GCY1</i>; see <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a> for <i>GAL2</i>). A similar profile was also observed for the <i>pCUP1</i> strains in the absence of copper, although a shift of Red1 binding away from <i>pCUP1</i> was apparent and correlated well with the leaky expression of this promoter (compare <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,D</a>; also <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). Addition of 5 \u03bcM Cu<sup>2+</sup> induced a marked shift in the Red1 binding pattern toward the downstream gene. This shift was further exacerbated upon addition of 20 \u03bcM Cu<sup>2+</sup> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), indicating that the transcription levels of convergent genes underlie the dynamic binding patterns of axis proteins. Such refocusing could either result from sliding motion or repeated recruitment to a chromatin modification or structure at the 3\u2032 ends of transcription bubbles. Previous studies have shown that cohesin is able to change position in response to transcription (<a href=\"#bib17\">Glynn et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Lengronne et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Bausch et al., 2007</a>). Thus, association with cohesin may explain the transcriptional effects we observe for axis proteins."

Our previous analysis had shown that in the absence of meiotic cohesin Rec8, Hop1 still associates with chromosomes but displays large regions of depletion alternating with dense clusters of binding (<a href=\"#bib44\">Panizza et al., 2011</a>), a pattern that was also mirrored by Red1 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). These large-scale changes in <i>rec8\u0394</i> mutants were associated with markedly narrower Red1 peaks (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Importantly, Red1 was no longer biased to the 3\u2032 ends of genes (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>) and focusing of axis proteins at convergent regions was strongly reduced (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>), implying that transcriptional focusing of axis proteins depends on cohesin. By contrast, the small-chromosome bias of axis protein binding persisted in <i>rec8\u0394</i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>), indicating that Red1 is enriched on small chromosomes independently of Rec8."

We also observed no apparent association with nucleotide bias, replication origins, tRNAs, or transposable elements. However, we did note a weak but consistent correlation (Pearson's <i>r</i> = 0.37) between axis protein enrichment and the local coding density of the genome. Specifically, regions enriched for long ORFs or tightly clustered short ORFs exhibited increased axis protein association (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). This effect appeared to be cumulative, as longer ORFs displayed higher Red1 binding <i>per kb</i> than shorter ORFs (Pearson's <i>r</i> = 0.70; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>). Enrichment of Red1 on gene bodies was not apparent in wild-type cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>), indicating that cohesin overrides this cohesin-independent axis recruitment activity.

ChIP-seq analysis of N-terminally tagged V5-Red1 revealed that the majority of Red1 binding sites were unaltered for their positions in the absence of Hop1 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>), indicating that Hop1 is not essential for recruiting Red1 to axis association sites. We note, however, that Red1 binding appeared to increase at some positions (see next section). Thus, Rec8 determines the positions of Red1 along chromosomes, while Hop1 seems to modulate its amount. Strikingly, Red1 DNA association is largely undetectable in <i>hop1\u0394 rec8\u0394</i> double mutants (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>), indicating that Hop1 is required for the cohesin-independent recruitment of Red1. Hop1, on the other hand, is undetectable on chromatin in absence of its partner Red1 even in the presence of Rec8 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Together, these data suggest that Red1 and Hop1 associate with DNA as a complex in the absence of cohesin. By contrast, Hop1 is not required for the recruitment of Red1 to sites of cohesin binding. Finally, with few exceptions, Rec8-HA signals were highly similar in wild-type or <i>red1\u0394</i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>), establishing that cohesin recruits Red1 unilaterally."

Specifically, Red1 binding appeared to increase on large chromosomes and close to centromeres. In wild-type cells, we observed higher overall levels of Red1 on the 3 smallest chromosomes (2.5-fold over the rest, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>), correlating well with the higher enrichment of DSB machinery (<a href=\"#bib44\">Panizza et al., 2011</a>) and increased DSB levels (<a href=\"#bib4\">Blitzblau et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Pan et al., 2011a</a>) on small chromosomes. The over-representation of Red1 was nearly abolished, falling to 1.25-fold, in the <i>hop1\u0394</i> mutant (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). Thus, Hop1 modulates Red1 deposition in a chromosome-dependent manner. Relative scaling of ChIP signals between different experiments by NCIS (Normalization of ChIP-Seq data with untagged control) (<a href=\"#bib35\">Liang and Keles, 2012</a>) suggested that the reduced chromosome-size bias may be due to increased Red1 enrichment on the larger chromosomes in the <i>hop1\u0394</i> mutant. To independently validate the ratio of Red1 occupancy between <i>hop1\u2206</i> and wild-type strains, we used qChIP at 6 loci with increased and 6 loci with decreased Red1 enrichment. qChIP confirmed the direction of Red1 signal change predicted from ChIP-seq at all 12 genomic positions. <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a> shows the comparison between the ratios expected from ChIP-seq and those observed by qChIP. These results identify Hop1 as a chromosome-dependent regulator of Red1 deposition and suggest that it down-regulates accumulation of Red1 on the thirteen largest chromosomes."

Because interaction between Rec8 and Red1 could preferentially occur in insoluble chromatin, we first used M-track (<a href=\"#bib61\">Zuzuarregui et al., 2012</a>) to test their interaction in vivo. M-track uses HKMT, a histone lysine methyltransferase and its acceptor sequence, a histone H3 fragment, each fused to one of the proteins suspected to interact, to create permanent methyl marks on the acceptor even upon transient interaction of the proteins of interest (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). When HKMT was fused to Rec8, Red1-HA-3xH3 received a robust H3K9me3 signal (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). The signal existed, as long as Red1 was detectable. We also observed methylation of Hop1-HA-3xH3 by Rec8-HKMT (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). In agreement with our ChIP-seq data (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>), methyl transfer to Hop1, but not Hop1 protein stability, depended on the presence of Red1 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>), showing the specificity of the assay. Unexpectedly, Red1-HA-3xH3 depended on Hop1 for its interaction with Rec8 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>, right panels). This result was at odds with the observation that chromosomal recruitment of untagged Red1 did not require <i>HOP1</i> (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). To investigate this discrepancy, we performed ChIP analysis of Red1 with or without the C-terminal HA-3xH3 tag. Only Red1 tagged at the C-terminus depended on Hop1 for chromosomal binding (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). Therefore, Hop1 contributes to the interaction between Red1 and Rec8. Moreover, Red1 requires its intact C-terminus when interacting with Rec8 in the absence of Hop1."

We used microarray-based measurement of DSB-associated single-stranded DNA (ssDNA arrays) to locate DSB hotspots in a <i>dmc1\u0394</i> mutant background, which prevents DSB repair and allows cumulative DSB measurements (<a href=\"#bib4\">Blitzblau et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Buhler et al., 2007</a>). In the presence of cohesin, DSB hotspots were distributed across most of the genome. By contrast, DSB formation in <i>rec8\u0394</i> mutants was largely restricted to small chromosomes and the vicinity of Red1 clusters (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,B</a>). Thus, DSB formation is limited to the genomic neighborhoods that exhibited persistent Red1 and Hop1 binding in <i>rec8\u0394</i> mutants. These findings are consistent with our previous observation that these regions selectively retain essential components of the meiotic DSB machinery (<a href=\"#bib44\">Panizza et al., 2011</a>). Strikingly, despite the loss of transcriptional focusing of axis association sites in the absence of cohesin (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>) and the overall altered patterns of Red1 distribution, DSB formation within Red1 clusters occurred at the same hotspots as in wild-type cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). Thus, hotspot designation does not depend on the precise location of axis binding sites. These data suggest that the general proximity of axis proteins is sufficient to activate DSB hotspots and that the primary role of Rec8 in controlling DSB formation is to broadly distribute axis proteins across meiotic chromosomes."

For this purpose, we replaced the only meiosis-specific subunit of cohesin, Rec8, with its mitotic counterpart Scc1/Mcd1 by deleting <i>REC8</i> and expressing <i>SCC1</i> from the <i>REC8</i> promoter (<i>pREC8-SCC1</i>) (<a href=\"#bib54\">Toth et al., 2000</a>). ChIP analysis revealed that Scc1-containing cohesin was targeted to the same chromosomal sites as Rec8-cohesin, indicating that Scc1 can fully substitute for Rec8 in recruiting cohesin to meiotic chromosomes (Pearson's <i>r</i> = 0.93, <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). However, Scc1-cohesin did not efficiently recruit Red1 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). As a result, the DSB distribution of <i>rec8\u0394 pREC8-SCC1</i> cells remained similar to <i>rec8\u0394</i> mutants and unlike wild-type cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). Consistent with this observation, Scc1 failed to detectably precipitate with V5-Red1 when expressed instead of Rec8 from the <i>REC8</i>-promoter (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>). We conclude that only meiotic cohesin can efficiently recruit meiotic axis proteins. Surprisingly, <i>pREC8-SCC1</i> did restore transcriptional focusing to axis association sites (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). These data indicate that focusing of axis proteins and axis protein recruitment are separable activities of meiotic cohesin and suggest that Rec8, but not Scc1, provides the necessary Red1 contacts for evenly distributing axis proteins, and thus recombination events, along meiotic chromosomes."

Our findings indicate that the dispersed genomic distribution of cohesin rings at convergent genes (<a href=\"#bib17\">Glynn et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Kugou et al., 2009</a>), and thus ultimately the transcriptional landscape, dictates the preferred attachment sites of the axial element. The enrichment of cohesin between convergent genes is not meiosis-specific (<a href=\"#bib17\">Glynn et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Lengronne et al., 2004</a>), but by replacing the Scc1 subunit of cohesin with a meiotic variant (Rec8), cohesin is converted into a landmark for axial element anchoring. Using oriented <i>URA3</i> insertions, we demonstrate that such sequence-independent recruitment ensures that the patterning of axis attachment sites readily adapts to changes in gene arrangements. Moreover, this mechanism may inherently separate axis attachments from DSB hotspots, which occur in promoters and are inhibited by the immediate neighborhood of axis proteins (<a href=\"#bib23\">Ito et al., 2014</a>). We note that, similar to yeast, mitotic cohesin is enriched on or near transcribed genes in both flies and mammalian cells (<a href=\"#bib56\">Wendt et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Gause et al., 2010</a>), and cohesin complexes are required for forming the meiotic loop-axis architecture in mammals (<a href=\"#bib41\">Novak et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Llano et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Hopkins et al., 2014</a>). Thus, the use of the transcriptional landscape as a dynamic reference for meiotic axis assembly may well be conserved through evolution. Perhaps, linking both DSB hotspots and axis association sites to landmarks of active, RNAPII-dependent transcription ensures that meiotic recombination remains confined to euchromatic and thus non-repetitive regions of the genome, reducing the potential for non-allelic homologous recombination and genome instability (<a href=\"#bib47\">Sasaki et al., 2010</a>)."

The robust positive signal of an in vivo physical proximity assay between Rec8 and Red1 is corroborated by co-precipitation between Red1 and Rec8. Consistent with this observation, Red1 is recruited exclusively to Rec8 binding sites on chromatin by Rec8 in the absence of Hop1. In fact, among cohesin subunits, Rec8 plays a pivotal role, as its mitotic paralogue, Scc1, does not interact notably with Red1. In <i>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</i>, meiotic cohesin interacts with the homolog of ScRed1 (Rec10) via Rec11, the meiosis-specific <i>S. pombe</i> homolog of ScScc3 (<a href=\"#bib48\">Sakuno and Watanabe, 2015</a>). Whether this mechanism of interaction also operates in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> is unknown, but as Scc1-cohesin does not recruit or stably interact with Red1 in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, we suggest that Rec8 directly contributes to Red1 binding. These findings indicate that the meiotic cohesin ring forms a stable protein complex with Red1 and Hop1 to flexibly link the axial element with chromatin."

On the other hand, EM analysis yields estimates of chromatin loop sizes of approximately 20 kb (<a href=\"#bib40\">Moens and Pearlman, 1988</a>), which is only moderately larger than the average spacing of cohesin sites of 10.9 kb (<a href=\"#bib17\">Glynn et al., 2004</a>), indicating that loops generally do not span more than 2 or 3 potential axis association sites."

First, Hop1 mediates Red1 binding to a number of chromosomal sites independently of Rec8. Second, Hop1 contributes to the recruitment of Red1 by Rec8, as revealed by the loss of Red1\u2013Rec8 interaction in <i>hop1\u2206</i> mutants when the C-terminus of Red1 is tagged. Third and most unexpectedly, Hop1 is a negative regulator of Red1 accumulation at selected chromosomal regions. It has been noted that DSB formation is dangerous and thus suppressed in the vicinity of centromeres (<a href=\"#bib43\">Pan et al., 2011a</a>) and that DSB density is higher on the three smallest chromosomes (<a href=\"#bib4\">Blitzblau et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Pan et al., 2011a</a>), which also enjoy substantially higher meiotic recombination rates (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kaback et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Kaback, 1996</a>). Hop1 strongly suppresses Red1 hyper-accumulation close to centromeres but also on medium and large chromosomes. In the presence of Hop1, Red1 densities on chromosomes I, VI, and III are over twofold higher than on other chromosomes, but without Hop1, Red1 densities for all chromosomes are nearly the same. These findings predict that preferential DSB formation on small chromosomes should be eliminated in a <i>hop1\u2206</i> mutant. This is indeed the case based on Spo11 oligo mapping (P Schl\u00f6gelhofer, personal communication). Earlier results have shown that the overrepresentation of DSB machinery on small chromosomes is not dependent on Spo11 (<a href=\"#bib44\">Panizza et al., 2011</a>), allowing us to exclude models that involve a DSB feedback mechanism (<a href=\"#bib53\">Thacker et al., 2014</a>) to explain the compensatory accumulations. Moreover, the preferential accumulation of Red1 is unaffected, if not exacerbated in <i>rec8\u2206</i> mutants, consistent with the observation that Rec8 binding itself exhibits no chromosome-size bias. These data exclude a role of cohesin in creating this bias and support the conclusion that Hop1 is the key factor mediating compensatory DSB machine accumulation on small chromosomes."

In particular, yeast <i>rec8\u2206</i> mutants fail to assemble discernable linear chromosome axes by EM (<a href=\"#bib32\">Klein et al., 1999</a>) but remain competent to induce DSBs in chromosomal domains that retain Red1/Hop1 binding. This correlation therefore likely reflects a quasi-local function of axis proteins in hotspot activation that is independent of linear axis formation but this remains to be shown. We previously demonstrated that axis proteins are required for the recruitment of several essential DSB proteins (<a href=\"#bib44\">Panizza et al., 2011</a>). Since axis proteins inhibit DSB formation within \u223c800 bp of their binding sites (<a href=\"#bib23\">Ito et al., 2014</a>), the Red1/Hop1-dependent local concentration of DSB factors likely activates hotspots at a distance, involving higher-order chromatin interactions. This model explains why aberrant fine-scale positioning of Red1 in <i>rec8\u2206</i> mutants still supported DSB formation at wild-type hotspots. The fact that the positions of DSB hotspots remain unchanged in these mutants strongly argues that axis proteins are not responsible for designating certain sequences as hotspots. This conclusion is consistent with growing evidence (summarized in <a href=\"#bib8\">Borde and de Massy, 2013</a>) that hotspot designation is primarily driven by epigenetic marks associated with gene promoters."

For steric reasons, the observed double peaks likely reflect the average distribution of axis proteins within the assayed cell population, rather than the distribution along a single chromatid. Given that the cohesin ring was previously proposed to slide along chromatin in response to transcription (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bausch et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Ocampo-Hafalla and Uhlmann, 2011</a>), these data indicate that cohesin sliding controls the sites of axis protein attachment.

Evidence for recruitment-independent roles of the cohesin ring comes from <i>rec8\u0394</i> mutants, which are severely defective in maintaining homolog-directed repair bias at a hotspot on chromosome III (<a href=\"#bib30\">Kim et al., 2010</a>). This defect occurs despite normal levels of Hop1 and Red1 on this chromosome (<a href=\"#bib9\">Brar et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Kugou et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Panizza et al., 2011</a>) (this work). Intriguingly, expression of Scc1-cohesin, which we show restores transcriptional focusing for axis proteins, also partially rescues homolog-directed repair bias (<a href=\"#bib30\">Kim et al., 2010</a>). Given that targeted DNA repair requires substantial flexibility of DNA ends, these observations raise the possibility that the dynamic anchoring of axis proteins may also be an important prerequisite for controlled meiotic recombination."

Although we had NCIS and one independent control (qChIP) included in the orginial submission, we completely agree that this point needed strengthening. We have added 3 additional biological repeats (n listed and error bars added, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>), each comparing Red1-qChIP between <i>hop1\u2206</i> and <i>HOP1</i>, and have included an untagged control for each primer pair. We had of course performed untagged controls for all experiments in the first submission but not always shown them for space reasons (ChIP-seq of the untagged control is required for NCIS calculations and can be found as a separate data set at GEO)."

To further strengthen this analysis, we exploited the fact that ChIP-seq not only identified positions where Red1 was increased in the absence of Hop1 (on long chromosomes), but also a few positions where Red1 was decreased. Using 6 positions with an expected increase, in parallel to 6 positions where a decrease is expected, controls against experimental variation concerning overall yield of an IP. Only if the yield of each IP remained constant between the <i>HOP1</i> and <i>hop1\u2206</i>, the ratios would be reproduced. If, for instance ChIP of <i>HOP1</i> cells produced overall less DNA, positions supposed to be higher in <i>HOP1</i> would fail to meet the expectation. However, in all experiments, the ratios on each position predicted to be below 1 behaved as expected, and those predicted to be above 1 did also. Despite this confirmation, we cautiously interpreted our result in the manuscript as \u201csuggesting\u201d down-regulation by Hop1 on long chromosomes."

First, ChIP is an averaging technology, while cytology studies single cells. Second, ChIP specifically monitors protein-DNA binding sites. Cytology does not. Big structures, like axial element fragments may be attached with many or few DNA binding sites, but this will not be distinguishable in cytology. Third, cytology will show any binding, independent of sequence specificity, while completely random attachments will generally not be visible in ChIP-seq profiles."

Indeed, we did not see co-immunoprecipitation in earlier experiments between Red1 and Rec8, prompting us to turn to M-track in the first place. However, the strength of the H3K9me3 signal suggested a stable physical interaction that was at odds with not getting a Co-IP signal. Red1-Rec8 interaction could lead to insoluble structures that possibly escaped our IP. Therefore we now used strong sonication followed by Benzonase treatment. This yielded a robust Rec8-HA Co-IP signal, when we precipitated with V5-Red1. We hope the referees agree that the Co-IP confirms physical interaction between cohesin and Red1 in the absence of DNA. This result is important, because it suggests a division of labor, in which Red1 has a more structural role both in organizing cohesin into linear, continuous arrays and in recruiting Hop1, while Hop1 may be more specialized for signal transduction and stimulating Spo11 activity."
