However, the molecular cues directing intranodal cell migration remain poorly characterized. Here we demonstrate that lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) produced by LN fibroblastic reticular cells (FRCs) acts locally to LPA<sub>2</sub> to induce T-cell motility. In vivo, either specific ablation of LPA-producing ectoenzyme autotaxin in FRCs or LPA<sub>2</sub> deficiency in T cells markedly decreased intranodal T cell motility, and FRC-derived LPA critically affected the LPA<sub>2</sub>-dependent T-cell motility. In vitro, LPA activated the small GTPase RhoA in T cells and limited T-cell adhesion to the underlying substrate via LPA<sub>2</sub>. The LPA-LPA<sub>2</sub> axis also enhanced T-cell migration through narrow pores in a three-dimensional environment, in a ROCK-myosin II-dependent manner. These results strongly suggest that FRC-derived LPA serves as a cell-extrinsic factor that optimizes T-cell movement through the densely packed LN reticular network."

However, the molecular cues directing intranodal cell migration remain poorly characterized. Here we demonstrate that lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) produced by LN fibroblastic reticular cells (FRCs) acts locally to LPA<sub>2</sub> to induce T-cell motility. In vivo, either specific ablation of LPA-producing ectoenzyme autotaxin in FRCs or LPA<sub>2</sub> deficiency in T cells markedly decreased intranodal T cell motility, and FRC-derived LPA critically affected the LPA<sub>2</sub>-dependent T-cell motility. In vitro, LPA activated the small GTPase RhoA in T cells and limited T-cell adhesion to the underlying substrate via LPA<sub>2</sub>. The LPA-LPA<sub>2</sub> axis also enhanced T-cell migration through narrow pores in a three-dimensional environment, in a ROCK-myosin II-dependent manner. These results strongly suggest that FRC-derived LPA serves as a cell-extrinsic factor that optimizes T-cell movement through the densely packed LN reticular network."

Takeda et al. engineered mice that were either unable to produce a particular LPA receptor on their T-cells, or that produced less LPA than normal.

B cells then migrate into LN follicles, whereas T cells remain in the paracortex and migrate continually along the FRC network (<a href=\"#bib3\">Baj\u00e9noff et al., 2006</a>). This intranodal migration provides critical opportunities for T cells to encounter cognate antigen-presenting dendritic cells. Two-photon microscopic analysis has shown that na\u00efve T cells crawl along the FRC network in an apparently random pattern of motion, at an average velocity of 10\u201315 \u03bcm per minute (<a href=\"#bib25\">Miller et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Okada and Cyster, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Worbs et al., 2007</a>).

Extracellularly produced LPA is involved in such diverse biological functions as vascular remodeling and cell growth, survival, and migration (<a href=\"#bib7\">Choi et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Yanagida et al., 2013</a>). Intracellularly produced LPA is an intermediate in the synthesis of triglycerides and glycerophospholipids, and thought to act as a 'housekeeper' inside the cell (<a href=\"#bib26\">Mills and Moolenaar, 2003</a>). Extracellular LPA is predominantly produced by autotaxin (ATX, also referred to as ENPP2 [ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase family member 2]), an ectoenzyme that was originally identified as a tumor-cell motility-enhancing factor (<a href=\"#bib39\">Stracke et al., 1992</a>). ATX is a lysophospholipase D that produces LPA by hydrolyzing lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) (<a href=\"#bib34\">Okudaira et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Moolenaar and Perrakis, 2011</a>). We and others have reported that ATX is strongly expressed in HEV endothelial cells (ECs), and that ATX regulates lymphocyte migration into the LN parenchyma (<a href=\"#bib16\">Kanda et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Nakasaki et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Umemoto et al., 2011</a>). We also demonstrated that LPA enhances lymphocyte detachment from ECs and promotes lymphocyte transmigration across the HEV basal lamina, at least in part by acting on HEV ECs (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bai et al., 2013</a>). LPA also acts on na\u00efve T cells to induce chemokinesis and cell polarization (<a href=\"#bib16\">Kanda et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Katakai et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Zhang et al., 2012</a>) and transmigration (<a href=\"#bib49\">Zhang et al., 2012</a>).While a study using pharmacological inhibitors revealed that ATX/LPA promotes intranodal lymphocyte motility in an ex vivo LN explant model (<a href=\"#bib19\">Katakai et al., 2014</a>), the physiological significance of the ATX/LPA axis in interstitial lymphocyte migration remains unknown."

While the cell-extrinsic factor(s) that regulate myosin II\u2019s activity during T-cell migration in a confined environment have been poorly defined, a recent study using zebrafish germ progenitor cells showed that LPA induces cell polarization in a ROCK-myosin II-dependent manner, which enables rapid cell migration in a confined environment (<a href=\"#bib36\">Ruprecht et al., 2015</a>)."

This LPA<sub>2</sub>-mediated signaling activates the RhoA-ROCK-myosin II pathway and promotes confinement-optimized interstitial T-cell migration.

Given that ATX, which generates the motogenic lysophospholipid, LPA, is expressed in HEV ECs to modulate lymphocyte motility (<a href=\"#bib29\">Nakasaki et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Bai et al., 2013</a>), we speculated that ATX and its product LPA are also expressed in other stromal cell subsets in the LN parenchyma and may control intranodal lymphocyte migration. Indeed, a recent paper showed that ATX is expressed in CCL21<sup>+</sup> CD31<sup>-</sup> stromal cells in LNs (<a href=\"#bib19\">Katakai et al., 2014</a>). We therefore subdivided the CD45<sup>-</sup> LN stromal cells into four stromal subsets (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). As shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, <i>Enpp2/Autotaxin</i> was readily detected in GP38<sup>+</sup> CD31<sup>-</sup> FRCs as well as GP38<sup>-</sup> CD31<sup>+</sup> blood endothelial cells (ECs), with negligible expression in lymphatic ECs and double-negative cells. Electron microscopic analysis confirmed that ATX was expressed in the FRCs surrounding collagen fiber bundles (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Interestingly, analyses using <i>Ccl19</i>-Cre x <i>R26</i>-EYFP mice, which constitutively express yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) in FRCs (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chai et al., 2013</a>), revealed that <i>Enpp2</i> was selectively expressed in LN FRCs but not splenic FRCs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). This <i>Enpp2</i> expression was apparently dependent on LT\u03b2R signaling, because blocking LT\u03b2R signaling significantly reduced expression of <i>Enpp2, Cxcl13</i>, and <i>Ccl19</i>, but not <i>Icam1</i>, in FRCs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). This blockade also downregulated transcription of HEV marker genes such as <i>Glycam1</i> and <i>Ccl21</i> in BECs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>), consistent with a previous report (<a href=\"#bib5\">Browning et al., 2005</a>). These results confirm that similarly to HEV ECs, FRCs constitutively express the LPA-generating enzyme ATX, which is maintained at least in part by LT\u03b2R signaling."

As shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, the frequency of LPA (18:1), LPA (18:2), and LPA (20:4) signals within 50 \u03bcm of an HEV did not differ significantly between <i>Enpp2<sup>fl/fl</sup></i> and <i>Ccl19</i>-Cre <i>Enpp2<sup>fl/fl</sup></i> mice. However, the frequency of relatively distant signals (more than 50 \u03bcm) decreased substantially when ATX was ablated in FRCs. Hence, the median distance between LPA signals and HEVs was significantly reduced in <i>Ccl19</i>-Cre <i>Enpp2<sup>fl/fl</sup></i> compared with <i>Enpp2<sup>fl/fl</sup></i> mice, consistent with the idea that distant LPA signals were associated with FRCs.

Splenocytes from eGFP-expressing mice and from LPA receptor-deficient mice were biotinylated, mixed in equivalent numbers, and injected intravenously into WT recipients, and lymphocytes that migrated into the LNs and spleen were counted 1.5\u2009hr later. As shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, <i>Lpar5<sup>-/-</sup></i> and <i>Lpar6<sup>-/-</sup></i> lymphocytes migrated into the LN and spleen at levels comparable to WT lymphocytes. In contrast, there were more <i>Lpar2<sup>-/-</sup></i> than WT lymphocytes in the LNs but not the spleen (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,C</a>). Among the migrating cells, this increase was evident for CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells but not B cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). A similar increase was also observed when purified CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were used (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>). These results suggest two possibilities for the role of LPA<sub>2</sub>: one is that LPA<sub>2</sub> negatively regulates the entry of T cells into LNs across HEVs, and the other is that LPA<sub>2</sub> promotes intranodal T-cell motility and hence their egress from the LNs. To test these hypotheses, we co-injected differentially labeled WT and <i>Lpar2<sup>-/-</sup></i> T cells and examined their intranodal localization after 90\u2009min by whole-mount LN analysis. Among the donor T cells in the LN parenchyma, <i>Lpar2<sup>-/-</sup></i> and WT T cells localized in the vicinity of HEVs (within 50 \u03bcm distance) at comparable levels (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E and F</a>), indicating that LPA<sub>2</sub> plays a minor role in T cell entry into LNs across HEVs. By contrast, <i>Lpar2<sup>-/-</sup></i> T cells localized more frequently in the area distant (more than 50 \u03bcm away) from HEVs compared with WT T cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E and F</a>), consistent with the hypothesis that LPA promotes intranodal T cell migration via LPA<sub>2</sub>, and hence, <i>Lpar2</i>-deficient T cells were retained in the LN parenchyma. To directly assess the involvement of the LPA<sub>2</sub> signaling in T-cell egress from LNs, we blocked the T cell entry by injecting anti-L-selectin antibody MEL-14 intravenously (T\u00a0=\u00a00\u2009hr), and measured the number of WT and <i>Lpar2<sup>-/-</sup></i> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells residing in the LNs 23\u2009hr after the injection. As shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>, the blockade of T cell entry (T\u00a0=\u00a023\u2009hr) resulted in reduction of the cellularity in LNs and increased the ratio of <i>Lpar2<sup>-/-</sup></i> T cells to WT cells compared to that before the injection. These results indicate that retention of <i>Lpar2</i>-deficient T cells was seen even after blockade of lymphocyte ingress to LNs and are compatible with the hypothesis that <i>Lpar2</i>-deficiency leads to T cell retention in the LN parenchyma without affecting lymphocyte migration into LNs."

We adoptively transferred CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from <i>Lpar2<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice and WT mice and used intravital two-photon microscopy to compare the behavior of these cells in the PLN of the recipient mice. Preliminary experiments indicated that the lymphocyte labeling used for in vivo cell tracking did not affect cell motility under the experimental conditions (unpublished observation). Compared to WT T cells, the <i>Lpar2<sup>-/-</sup></i> T cells moved noticeably more slowly and had comparatively shorter track lengths and less displacement from their original position per unit of time (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). <i>Lpar2<sup>-/-</sup></i> T cells had a 13% lower average velocity (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>), a 45% lower mean square displacement (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>), and a 70% lower motility coefficient than WT T cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>), although the directionality of T-cell motion was comparable in these cell types (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

In this study, we demonstrated that LPA is generated ATX-dependently by FRCs in the LN parenchyma, and that the LPA/LPA<sub>2</sub>-mediated signal activates Rho/myosin II in T cells. LPA<sub>2</sub> signaling enhances T-cell migration in confined 3D collagen matrices and promotes interstitial T-cell migration in LNs in a manner dependent on FRC-derived LPA. These results strongly suggest that the LPA-LPA<sub>2</sub> axis critically regulates the confinement-optimized T-cell motility in LNs."

In the present study, we found that ATX is also generated by LN FRCs, in agreement with another recent study (<a href=\"#bib19\">Katakai et al., 2014</a>), and that multiple LPA species are present in the LN parenchyma; in particular, we showed that LPA (18:1), LPA (18:2), and LPA (20:4) are produced in the paracortex in a manner dependent on FRC-derived ATX. The enzyme ATX has substrate specificity for LPCs with different acyl-chain lengths and saturations. Recombinant mouse ATX prefers LPC species with relatively short, unsaturated acyl chains, and produces LPA (18:2), LPA (16:0), LPA (20:4), and LPA (18:1) but not LPA (18:0) (<a href=\"#bib48\">Yukiura et al., 2011</a>). Consistent with this observation, crystal structural analysis revealed that ATX accommodates LPA (18:1) and LPA (18:3) but not LPA (18:0) in a stable conformation in its hydrophobic pocket, accounting for ATX's preferences for the number of unsaturated bonds of LPC (18:0 &lt; 18:1 &lt; 18:3) (<a href=\"#bib30\">Nishimasu et al., 2011</a>). While LPA (18:0) signals were detected in the LN parenchyma, they were ubiquitously found in other tissues independently of ATX expression; these signals are likely to represent intracellularly produced LPA, an intermediate in the synthesis of triglycerides and glycerophospholipids inside the cell (<a href=\"#bib26\">Mills and Moolenaar, 2003</a>), which is relatively inert in activating LPA receptors (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bandoh et al., 2000</a>). Taken together, our findings indicate that multiple biologically relevant LPA species (18:1, 18:2, 20:4) are produced by FRCs, which may in turn act locally on LPA receptors expressed by adjacent lymphocytes."

T-cell motility on a 2D surface requires integrin-mediated adhesive forces and detachment from the integrin substrates, whereas the 3D T-cell motility in LNs only partially requires LFA-1-mediated interactions (<a href=\"#bib44\">Woolf et al., 2007</a>). Jacobelli et al. (<a href=\"#bib15\">Jacobelli et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Jacobelli et al., 2009</a>) reported that lymphocytes are not restricted to adhesion-dependent motility in 3D environments, and that myosin IIA controls T-cell motility modes\u2014including amoeboid motility, which is dependent on the degree of confinement of 3D environment, and prevents excessive adhesions on non-integrin substrates. In our in vitro model, LPA limited T-cell adhesion area on the fibronectin- and ICAM-1-coated substrate, and promoted chemokine-induced T-cell migration across 3-\u03bcm but not 5-\u03bcm filter pores and also in a confined collagen gel via LPA<sub>2</sub> signaling. This enhanced migration was inhibited by the ROCK inhibitor Y27632 or the myosin II ATPase inhibitor blebbistatin. In vivo, the LPA/LPA<sub>2</sub> axis promoted intranodal T-cell migration even in the absence of interaction between LFA-1 and its ligand. These findings indicate that LPA acts on LPA<sub>2</sub> to enhance T-cell motility in chemokine-rich, confined environments at least partly independently of integrin-mediated adhesion or de-adhesion, and this enhancement depends mainly on ROCK/myosin IIA activity."

On the other hand, we showed that LPA activated the Rho GTPase in T cells via LPA<sub>2</sub>, promoting chemokine-induced T-cell migration across 3-\u03bcm- but not 5-\u03bcm-pore filters in vitro. We further demonstrated that FRC-derived LPA signaled T cells through LPA<sub>2</sub> to sustain optimal T-cell motility in the LN parenchyma. Thus, LPA appears to serve as a cell-extrinsic factor regulating myosin II activity in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, and the LPA<sub>2</sub>/ROCK/myosin II signaling pathway is critical for T-cell migration in the confined LN parenchymal environment. In addition, we showed that transferred <i>Lpar2<sup>-/-</sup></i> T cells accumulated in LNs more abundantly than WT counterparts 1.5\u20132\u2009hr after the cell transfer (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>), whereas Knowlden et al showed that <i>Lpar2</i>-deficiency did not affect T-cell trafficking to LNs significantly 42\u2009hr after cell transfer (<a href=\"#bib20\">Knowlden et al., 2014</a>).

This raises the question of whether LPA produced in the HEV area also affects T-cell motility in the LN parenchyma. In this regard, we are currently investigating the effect of EC-specific ATX ablation on lymphocyte behaviors within LNs but do not yet have a definitive answer. Concerning the question of whether LPA produced in the LN parenchyma would affect T-cell extravasation from the HEVs, we found comparable lymphocyte migration across HEVs in <i>Enpp2<sup>fl/fl</sup></i> and <i>Ccl19</i>-Cre <i>Enpp2<sup>fl/fl</sup></i> mice (unpublished observation).

To generate time-lapse series, stacks of more than 30 x-y sections spaced at 2\u20133 \u03bcm were acquired every 20\u201330\u2009s in resonance mode. For evaluating integrin-dependency in LPA-induced T-cell motility, 300 \u03bcg of anti-LFA-1 antibody was intravenously injected, and 1\u2009hr later, cell migration was monitored again. Imaris software (Bitplane,\u00a0UK) was used to track cells in 3D and measure the cells\u2019 velocity and x, y, z coordinates. Mean displacement plots were calculated from the x, y, z coordinates using Excel (Microsoft,\u00a0Redmond,\u00a0WA) as described previously (<a href=\"#bib40\">Sumen et al., 2004</a>). The motility coefficient (M) was calculated from the mean displacement plot as M = D<sup>2</sup>/6t, in which D is displacement and t is time, using 10-min tracks. The directionality of cells\u2019 motion was calculated by dividing cells\u2019 net displacement by the total path length, using over 10-min tracks (<a href=\"#bib40\">Sumen et al., 2004</a>)."

Following the reviewers\u2019 suggestion, we intravenously transferred WT and LPA<sub>2</sub>-deficient T cells, and monitored their migration by intravital two-photon microscopy before and after injecting functional blocking antibody against LFA-1. As shown in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5H-J</a>, the blockade of the interaction between LFA-1 and ICAM-1 significantly attenuated the motility of WT T cells as reported by others (Katakai et al., JI 2013; Soriano et al., JI 2011, Woolf et al., Nature Immunol. 2007). In the absence of the integrin-ligand interaction, LPA<sub>2</sub>-deficiency reduced T-cell motility, and the extent of reduction in T-cell velocity (19.9 \u00b1 5.5%) and motility coefficient (43.5 \u00b1 16.8%) was comparable to that observed in the presence of the integrin interaction (15.8 \u00b1 4.4% and 43.0 \u00b1 13.6% reduction in velocity and motility coefficient, respectively). These results are in accordance with the hypothesis that the LPA/LPA<sub>2</sub> signaling promotes T cell motility in LN at least partly in an integrin-independent manner. We added the description in the last paragraph of the subsection \u201cLPA<sub>2</sub>-mediated signaling regulates intranodal T-cell migration\u201d. As described below, however, the LPA/LPA<sub>2</sub> axis appears to affect T cell adhesion on the surfaces coated with LFA-1-ligand or fibronectin."

This LPA\u2019s effect was not observed in LPA<sub>2</sub><sup>-/-</sup> T cells, which was also the same with cell adhesion to the fibronectin-coated substrate (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A-C</a>). We also observed that LPA induced morphological changes in T cells in an LPA<sub>2</sub>-dependent manner on both fibronectin- and ICAM-1-coated surfaces (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C, E</a>).
