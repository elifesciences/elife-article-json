To investigate the mechanisms underlying RTK specificity in craniofacial development, we performed RNA-seq to delineate the transcriptional response to platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling in mouse embryonic palatal mesenchyme cells. While the early gene expression profile induced by both growth factors is qualitatively similar, the late response is divergent. Comparing the effect of MEK (Mitogen/Extracellular signal-regulated kinase) and PI3K (phosphoinositide-3-kinase) inhibition, we find the FGF response is MEK dependent, while the PDGF response is PI3K dependent. Furthermore, FGF promotes proliferation but PDGF favors differentiation. Finally, we demonstrate overlapping domains of PDGF-PI3K signaling and osteoblast differentiation in the palate and increased osteogenesis in FGF mutants, indicating this differentiation circuit is conserved in vivo. Our results identify distinct responses to PDGF and FGF and provide insight into the mechanisms encoding RTK specificity."

To investigate the mechanisms underlying RTK specificity in craniofacial development, we performed RNA-seq to delineate the transcriptional response to platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling in mouse embryonic palatal mesenchyme cells. While the early gene expression profile induced by both growth factors is qualitatively similar, the late response is divergent. Comparing the effect of MEK (Mitogen/Extracellular signal-regulated kinase) and PI3K (phosphoinositide-3-kinase) inhibition, we find the FGF response is MEK dependent, while the PDGF response is PI3K dependent. Furthermore, FGF promotes proliferation but PDGF favors differentiation. Finally, we demonstrate overlapping domains of PDGF-PI3K signaling and osteoblast differentiation in the palate and increased osteogenesis in FGF mutants, indicating this differentiation circuit is conserved in vivo. Our results identify distinct responses to PDGF and FGF and provide insight into the mechanisms encoding RTK specificity."

Several models have been put forth to explain how RTKs encode specificity (<a href=\"#bib23\">Hunter, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Simon, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Pawson, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Volinsky and Kholodenko, 2013</a>). In concept, distinct responses may be encoded by modulation of individual pathways downstream of receptor activation, with each pathway regulating a specific outcome. Alternatively, many cellular responses may require integration from multiple input pathways, and signal specificity could arise from this unique combination of pathways. Analysis of mice harboring point mutations to disrupt binding of specific effector proteins to RTKs suggests both these models may apply in vivo; platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) Receptor \u03b1 (<i>Pdgfra</i>) mutants display effector-specific phenotypes in line with the former model (<a href=\"#bib27\">Klinghoffer et al., 2002</a>), but PDGF Receptor \u03b2 (<i>Pdgfrb</i>) mediated outcomes require combined output across multiple pathways, consistent with the latter model (<a href=\"#bib52\">Tallquist et al., 2003</a>). In addition, quantitative differences in the duration and magnitude of signal induction provide an added layer of regulatory complexity (<a href=\"#bib35\">Marshall, 1995</a>). At the transcriptional level, one outcome of RTK activation is the expression of immediate early genes (IEGs) (<a href=\"#bib11\">Cochran et al., 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Lau and Nathans, 1987</a>). Studies in cell culture have suggested IEGs constitute a generic readout of RTK activation with minimal specificity at the receptor or intracellular effector level (<a href=\"#bib15\">Fambrough et al., 1999</a>), but genetic experiments in mice indicate a degree of IEG specificity (<a href=\"#bib48\">Schmahl et al., 2007</a>). Therefore, a central goal remains to delineate RTK responsive transcriptional programs, identify the key signaling parameters encoding their regulation, and determine how these gene expression profiles dictate cellular decisions."

In particular, PDGF and FGF signaling are both essential for midface development. In mice, loss of <i>Pdgfra</i> (<a href=\"#bib50\">Soriano, 1997</a>) or its ligands <i>Pdgfa</i> and <i>Pdgfc</i> (<a href=\"#bib14\">Ding et al., 2004</a>) results in facial clefting, and mice harboring a mutation abrogating PI3K binding to PDGFR\u03b1 mirror these craniofacial phenotypes, implicating PI3K as the main effector of PDGFR\u03b1 signaling (<a href=\"#bib27\">Klinghoffer et al., 2002</a>). In addition, both <i>Pdgfra</i> (<i>Wnt1-Cre</i>; <i>Pdgfra</i><sup><i>fl/fl</i></sup>) (<a href=\"#bib53\">Tallquist and Soriano, 2003</a>) and FGF receptor 1 (<i>Wnt1-Cre; Fgfr1</i>) (<a href=\"#bib56\">Trokovic et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Wang et al., 2013</a>) neural crest conditional mutants exhibit cleft face, indicating both pathways are required for normal development of the neural crest derived facial skeleton. At the intracellular pathway level, previous work has implicated ERK as a key effector downstream of FGF signaling (<a href=\"#bib28\">Lanner and Rossant, 2010</a>). Furthermore, mutations in both PDGF and FGF signaling have been linked to craniofacial syndromes in humans (<a href=\"#bib10\">Choi et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Miraoui and Marie, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Rattanasopha et al., 2012</a>). Interestingly, chimeric receptor experiments in mice have shown that the intracellular domain of <i>Fgfr1</i> cannot compensate for <i>Pdgfra</i> during development, suggesting these two receptors transmit biologically distinct signals in vivo (<a href=\"#bib19\">Hamilton et al., 2003</a>). The midface thus offers a unique opportunity to interrogate the mechanisms of signal specificity between these two RTKs in a developmentally relevant system."

The architecture of the transcriptional response to RTK activation consists of three stereotypic waves: an IEG response involving core transcriptional regulators (<i>Fos</i>, <i>Jun</i>, <i>Egr</i>), a delayed response playing a feedback role (phosphatases, RNA-binding proteins), and a late sustained response determining cellular outcome (<a href=\"#bib1\">Amit et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Avraham and Yarden, 2011</a>). However, the degree of conservation between genes regulated in each wave across different RTK families is unclear. Furthermore, although classic feedback regulators of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways have been described, such as dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSPs) for ERK and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) (<a href=\"#bib31\">Li et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Owens and Keyse, 2007</a>), the extent of effector-dependent transcription genome-wide is not well characterized."

Although both PDGF and FGF are required in the neural crest for craniofacial development, we find distinct transcriptional programs, effector dependencies, and cellular outcomes in response to each RTK. While many genes in the early wave are shared across the two RTKs, FGF induces a quantitatively stronger response than PDGF. In addition, the feedback control provided by the delayed transcriptional wave displays distinct characteristics in response to PDGF and FGF. By exploring the effect of MEK/ERK and PI3K inhibition on these RTK-regulated gene expression profiles, we find PDGF-mediated transcription displays greater PI3K dependence, while FGF-mediated gene expression programs predominantly require ERK activity. This relationship is conserved at the level of cellular outcome, with FGF driving proliferation but PDGF promoting PI3K-dependent differentiation. Finally, we show overlapping domains of PI3K signaling, PDGF target gene expression, and skeletal differentiation during palatogenesis in vivo, a process perturbed in <i>Fgfr1</i> conditional mutants. Taken together, our studies suggest unique roles for PDGF and FGF during development of the facial skeleton, and more broadly, demonstrate that distinct transcriptional responses to RTK signaling are encoded through qualitative and quantitative differences in intracellular pathway activation."

Consistent with this observation, visualization of all replicates by principal component analysis (PCA) (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>) revealed that the 1-hr PDGF and 1-hr FGF samples cluster together, but the 4-hr FGF replicates are distinctly separate from the 4-hr PDGF samples. Comparing the stimulated MEPMs to untreated cells, genes differentially regulated at 1 hr by either PDGF or FGF (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary File 2</a>) show high correlation (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.8173, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>), but by 4 hr, the two RTK signals are divergent (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.2881, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C'</a>). In addition, the genes regulated by PDGF at 1 hr (n = 40) form a subset of those genes regulated by FGF at 1 hr (n = 159), further highlighting the similarity within the early response to both growth factors. Gene ontology analysis (<a href=\"#bib22\">Huang et al., 2009</a>) of the genes induced at 1 hr revealed an enrichment of transcription factors and MAP kinase phosphatases downstream of both RTKs (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>, p &lt; 0.001), similar to previous descriptions of the response to RTK activation (<a href=\"#bib1\">Amit et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Avraham and Yarden, 2011</a>). To better visualize the organization of these targets, we constructed a protein\u2013protein interaction (PPI) network from the genes regulated at 1 hr; in constructing this network, we only included direct interactions between proteins (path length = 1) and excluded predicted interactions (<a href=\"#bib4\">Berger et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Chen et al., 2012</a>). The resulting network contains 25 upregulated genes (out of 113 total induced genes), including many classic components of the IEG response, such as activator protein-1 (AP-1) subunits (<i>Fos</i>, <i>Jun</i>) and their regulators (<i>Zfp36</i>, <i>Atf3</i>) as well as <i>Myc</i>, <i>Egr1-4</i>, and <i>Srf</i> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Closer inspection revealed that many shared target genes within this network are regulated to both a stronger magnitude and longer duration following FGF treatment compared to PDGF treatment (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). Indeed, <i>Fos</i>, <i>Fosb</i>, <i>Jun</i>, and <i>Junb</i> all exhibit differences in signal magnitude and/or duration in response to FGF, as validated by qPCR (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). In sum, the two RTKs induce a similar gene expression profile at 1 hr (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>), as evidenced by the high-correlation coefficient and overlap between genes differentially regulated by PDGF and FGF at 1 hr. However, FGF drives a quantitatively stronger early response with many transcription factors showing both a stronger magnitude and greater duration of induction in response to FGF compared to PDGF (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>), which may explain in part the divergent gene expression profiles observed at 4 hr."

                                "text": "Given the importance of MEK/ERK and PI3K/Akt signaling downstream of these RTKs during development (<a href=\"#bib27\">Klinghoffer et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Corson et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Lanner and Rossant, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Fantauzzo and Soriano, 2014</a>), we analyzed pERK and pAkt activation following FGF and PDGF stimulation in MEPMs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Consistent with the stronger response to FGF treatment in the gene expression data, the FGF-induced pERK response displays both a higher magnitude and longer duration of activation compared to the PDGF-induced pERK signal. In contrast, both FGF and PDGF induce similar patterns of pAkt activation, but the magnitude of the PDGF-pAkt induction is slightly greater. The FGF-pERK signal is apparent up to 6 hr following growth factor treatment (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), and increasing the dose of PDGFA ligand did not alter the kinetics of pERK activation (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). To better understand differences in the response to PDGF and FGF, we performed gene ontology analysis for the molecular function of genes that are differentially expressed (DE) between 4-hr PDGF treatment and 4-hr FGF treatment (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, p &lt; 0.001) (<a href=\"#bib22\">Huang et al., 2009</a>). The top results for genes enriched following FGF treatment are sets associated with modulation of signaling, such as protein kinases and GTPase regulators, which may function as activators of Ras to promote MEK/ERK signaling. Transcriptional feedback regulation of RTK signaling is well established, particularly the role of DUSPs providing negative feedback for MAPK signaling (<a href=\"#bib1\">Amit et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Li et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Owens and Keyse, 2007</a>). Indeed, many DUSPs (MAPK phosphatases) are induced in response to both PDGF and FGF treatment at 1 hr (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>), but FGF alone induces the expression of kinases and GTPase regulators at 4 hr, suggesting a distinct role for the FGF response in regulating MEK/ERK activity. We, thus, performed Western blots in the presence of cycloheximide following both PDGF and FGF treatment to determine the effect of inhibiting protein synthesis (and consequently, the delayed transcriptional response) on ERK activation. Consistent with previous work exploring the role of DUSP-mediated negative feedback (<a href=\"#bib1\">Amit et al., 2007</a>), cycloheximide treatment increased the duration of the PDGF-pERK response (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). However, we observed the opposite effect of cycloheximide treatment on the FGF-pERK response (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C'</a>), suggesting a positive feedforward loop in which FGF induces the expression of kinases and GEFs to modulate the ERK response in addition to activating ERK directly. To further explore the architecture of the late FGF response, we constructed a PPI network from genes increased at 4-hr FGF stimulation compared to 4-hr PDGF treatment. The FGF network (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>) contains <i>Prkca</i> as a highly connected node, which is interesting given reported roles for protein kinase C (PKC) in facilitating a sustained pERK response (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bhalla et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Santos et al., 2007</a>) as well as its importance downstream of FGF in skeletal development (<a href=\"#bib38\">Miraoui and Marie, 2010</a>). We found that inhibition of PKC decreased both the initial pulse and sustained activation of the FGF-mediated pERK response in MEPMs (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C'</a>), consistent with its potential function as a hub within the FGF response network. In addition, many of the kinases and GEFs transcriptionally regulated by FGF have reported roles in positively modifying MEK/ERK signaling (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>), which may explain in part the residual pERK response to FGF in the presence of PKC inhibition. Collectively, these data support a model in which the balance between positive and negative transcriptional loops is critical for determining patterns of pERK response to different RTKs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>)."

Thus, we analyzed the effector dependence of the transcriptional response by performing RNA-seq in cells stimulated with either PDGF or FGF in the presence of PD325901 (MEK inhibitor) or LY294002 (PI3K inhibitor) (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary File 1</a>). PCA on all thirteen sequenced conditions (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>) segregates the samples based on growth factor treatment along PC1 (44.57% of the variance) and on inhibitor treatment along PC2 (17.72% of the variance). Similarly, the correlation matrix for all sampled replicates mimics the PCA, with the 4 hr FGF and 4 hr FGF + LY showing a gene expression profile distinct from all other samples (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). We next directly tested the effect of pathway inhibition on both the shared gene expression program induced by the two RTKs at 1 hr (113 genes total) and the genes regulated between FGF and PDGF treatment at 4 hr. Globally, FGF target genes show greater MEK/ERK dependence than PI3K dependence, while PDGF responsive genes exhibit the opposite relationship (<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary File 3</a>) mirroring the reported signaling requirements for each RTK. This trend is apparent at 1 hr (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A, A'</a>) and striking for genes DE at 4 hr, where 52% of FGF responsive genes are MEK/ERK dependent (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>) but only 22% were PI3K dependent (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B'</a>). This dependence is inverted for PDGF, where 9% are MEK/ERK dependent (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>) but 28% are PI3K dependent (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C'</a>). Strikingly, MEK inhibition increases the expression of PDGF targets (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>) but not FGF targets (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>), while PI3K inhibition increases the expression of FGF responsive genes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A', B'</a>), suggesting the FGF-ERK and PDGF-PI3K relationships are important for both gene induction and repression. These intracellular pathway dependencies are independent of the magnitude of induction/repression, as varying the FC threshold did not affect the PDGF-PI3K or FGF-ERK relationships (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C, D'</a>)."

Both RTKs show increased <i>Jun</i> expression in response to PD325901, while FGF and LY294002 treatment upregulates many classic ERK targets such as <i>Fos</i>, <i>Fosb</i>, and <i>Dusp6</i> (<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary File 3</a>), suggesting this \u2018superinduction\u2019 may reflect compensatory activation of other intracellular pathways. Many such examples of crosstalk between ERK and PI3K have been documented (<a href=\"#bib36\">Mendoza et al., 2011</a>). Thus, we assayed the activation of these pathways following MEK inhibition with PD325901 and PI3K inhibition with LY294002. We found striking induction of pJNK upon pERK inhibition by PD325901 downstream of both FGF (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>) and PDGF (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>) stimulation. Interestingly, a moderate change in pAkt induction following PDGF treatment and MEK inhibition seems apparent, although this induction was not observed at the dose used for the RNA-seq experiment (1 \u03bcM PD325901). Next, we investigated the effect of PI3K inhibition with LY294002. We found that FGF-mediated pERK induction increased with LY294002 treatment (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A'</a>), but PDGF treatment did not produce this increase in pERK signal (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B'</a>), consistent with changes observed at the level of target gene expression. At the inhibitor doses used in the RNA-seq experiment (1 \u03bcM PD325901, 10 \u03bcM LY294002), both PDGF and FGF significantly induce JNK activation in the presence of MEK inhibition, while only FGF activates ERK when PI3K is inhibited (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C, C'</a>). Finally, we performed qPCR for a subset of target genes to confirm their response to pathway inhibition. <i>Fos</i>, <i>Fosb</i>, and <i>Junb</i> exhibit \u2018superinduction\u2019 downstream of FGF specifically in response to PI3K inhibition, confirming these genes are indeed MEK/ERK dependent and providing further evidence that LY294002-mediated induction of pERK can drive transcriptional changes (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Similarly, <i>Jun</i> is \u2018superinduced\u2019 in the presence of PD325901 downstream of both RTKs. There is a modest increase in <i>Jun</i> induction following FGF treatment with PI3K inhibition, likely reflecting the compensatory induction of pERK in this condition and consequent crosstalk between ERK and JNK signaling. In addition, <i>Fos</i> induction is increased with LY294002 treatment even in the absence of growth factor, which may reflect a degree of growth factor independent crosstalk between PI3K and ERK. However, this effect synergizes with ligand treatment, indicating this compensation across intracellular pathways is at least partially dependent on receptor activation."

Crystal violet staining for cell viability confirms a greater effect of FGF than PDGF as well as the importance of MEK/ERK activity for this response (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Furthermore, the PDGF-dependent effect on cell viability is significantly greater at day 3 compared to the 0.1% fetal bovine serum (FBS) treated cells, underscoring the role of PDGF in cell survival/growth in the absence of other growth factors. We next measured apoptosis following PDGF and FGF treatment in the presence of both inhibitors (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). Consistent with the cell viability results and phospho-JNK induction patterns, MEK inhibition following FGF stimulation results in a greater increase in apoptosis than inhibition of FGF-mediated PI3K signaling; in contrast, PI3K inhibition has a greater effect than MEK inhibition downstream of PDGF stimulation, although inhibiting either pathway results in increased apoptosis. Finally, we tested cell differentiation by alkaline phosphatase (AP) staining, a marker of osteoblast differentiation (<a href=\"#bib61\">Wu et al., 2008</a>). PDGF-treated MEPMs display a robust AP response, while FGF-treated cells show a striking lack of AP positive cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). In addition, MEK/ERK inhibition increases AP staining, but PI3K inhibition represses osteoblast differentiation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). These experiments suggest the following model: FGF drives cell proliferation and represses cell differentiation in a MEK/ERK-dependent manner, while PDGF facilitates cell differentiation, at the expense of reduced proliferation, in a PI3K-dependent manner."

Our study supports a model in which differential intracellular pathway activation is responsible for the distinct transcriptional responses and cellular processes mediated by RTK signaling in MEPMs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). Pathway activation downstream of a single RTK can be affected by many parameters, such as receptor expression level (<a href=\"#bib55\">Traverse et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Tallquist et al., 2003</a>), suggesting that even a single receptor can regulate multiple downstream outputs and transcriptional programs across different contexts. The role of quantitative differences in the pERK response leading to distinct cellular outcomes is well characterized in PC12 neurons (<a href=\"#bib35\">Marshall, 1995</a>), and the transcriptional response to the proliferative program mediated by sustained pERK activation in 3T3 fibroblasts has been reported (<a href=\"#bib63\">Yamamoto et al., 2006</a>). Building on these studies, the MEPM RNA-seq data provide insight into the differences in gene expression following both transient and sustained pERK induction as well as qualitatively specific target genes downstream of MEK/ERK and PI3K signaling, with the added advantage of profiling these responses within a system requiring these pathways for normal development. It is important to note that mRNA levels alone (as measured by RNA-seq) are not the only level of specificity in the transcriptional response, for example, differential cofactor recruitment can also specify distinct gene expression programs in response to FGF and PDGF signaling (<a href=\"#bib57\">Vasudevan and Soriano, 2014</a>).

As previously reported in other contexts (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bhalla et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Santos et al., 2007</a>), we found the FGF-pERK induction was dependent on PKC activity, and we further identified crosstalk in the presence of pathway inhibition between ERK, PI3K, and JNK. In addition, a subset of genes (34% FGF, 43% PDGF) are not affected by MEK/ERK or PI3K inhibition, suggesting they either lie downstream of other intracellular pathways or require inhibition of both ERK and PI3K. Thus, while our studies demonstrate PI3K is necessary for differentiation and ERK is necessary for proliferation in MEPMs, the high connectivity across intracellular pathways suggests no single pathway in isolation is sufficient to drive transcriptional responses and cellular outcomes in their entirety. Rather, integrated output from multiple effector pathways likely contributes to the ultimate cellular outcome, and instead of the existence of linear PDGF-PI3K-differentiation and FGF-ERK-proliferation axes, we favor a model in which multiple signaling events converge on PI3K to promote differentiation and ERK to drive proliferation in the midface."

The \u2018superinduction\u2019 of these transcriptional responses was due at least in part to compensatory activation of other pathways: inhibition of pERK downstream of both RTKs resulted in increased pJNK induction while inhibition of PI3K downstream of FGF, but not PDGF, resulted in increased pERK activation. This observation has implications for both genetic studies in mice and any system in which effector inhibition is used as an experimental or therapeutic agent. First, allelic series experiments in which adaptor binding is abrogated in order to abolish specific effector cascades may result in induction of alternate signaling pathways, complicating assignment of developmental function to a single intracellular pathway. Indeed, mice harboring a PI3K binding site mutation at the PDGFR\u03b1 locus show increased SHP2 binding and altered pERK activation (<a href=\"#bib27\">Klinghoffer et al., 2002</a>). Second, chemical inhibition of these effectors may prime activation of other pathways, facilitating alternate signaling mechanisms and cellular outcomes. Many examples of such crosstalk between ERK and PI3K (<a href=\"#bib36\">Mendoza et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Sun and Bernards, 2014</a>) as well as ERK and JNK (<a href=\"#bib32\">Lopez-Bergami et al., 2007</a>) have been described downstream of RTK signaling in cancer. The MEPM RNA-seq data provide a transcriptional signature for this crosstalk, offering an additional readout to measure activation of these pathways. However, it is important to caution that these responses likely vary based on cellular context, and although the core target genes and effector dependencies may be conserved, extrapolating this framework to other systems requires careful validation."

To investigate the mechanisms underlying RTK specificity in craniofacial development, the authors performed detailed FGF and PDGF responsive gene analyses. They show that FGF signaling favors cell proliferation through activation of ERK whereas PDGF signaling mainly promotes cell differentiation through PI3K. Their results show that PDGF requires PI3K and affects differentiation while FGF depends on MEK/ERK and promotes proliferation. Furthermore although the FGF response was shown to be quantitatively stronger, there was considerable interconnectivity across the intracellular pathways which urges caution with respect to general effector inhibitor experiments and conclusions. The study is carefully done. Some further experimentation, described below, would strengthen the results."

The main text has been amended in the Results section to make these points explicit. In addition, of the 34 total transcription factors identified within the FGF target gene list at 1 hour, 76% (26/34) are also significantly regulated by PDGF stimulation (<a href=\"#SD4-data\">Supplementary file 4</a>), again underscoring the high degree of overlap at the early timepoint."

However, the Id genes (Id1, Id2, and Id3) do not conform to this trend and have similar expression across all genotypes; this may be due to compensation in vivo, particularly by BMP signaling, a canonical inducer of Id gene expression. Finally, it is interesting to note a high level of residual Pdgfra and Fgfr1 expression in the corresponding mutants. We believe this reflects receptor expression from non-neural crest derived contributions to the secondary palate (such as the mesoderm). Indeed, when we performed in situ hybridization for Pdgfra in Wnt1-Cre; Pdgfra<sup>fl/fl</sup> mutants and Fgfr1 expression in Wnt1-Cre; Fgfr1<sup>fl/fl</sup> mutants, we found some receptor mRNA expression in the E13.5 palate of the respective conditional mutants (data not shown), consistent with our qPCR results. Furthermore, flow cytometry analysis of PDGFR\u03b1 expression in 10.5 branchial arches of Wnt1-Cre; Pdgfra<sup>fl/fl</sup> conditional mutants revealed no receptor expression, indicating satisfactory deletion by the Wnt1-Cre transgene in early structures derived from the neural crest (Tallquist, MD, and Soriano, P. Development. 130, 507-518, 2003). Finally, the same qPCR primers, when used to measure Pdgfra and Fgfr1 expression in E11.5 facial prominences isolated from the respective conditional mutants, revealed almost complete loss of these genes, thus suggesting the observed residual expression is likely not a technical issue associated with the qPCR protocol itself (Vasudevan, HN, and Soriano, P.

The development of Cre drivers more precise than the Wnt1-Cre that drive recombination within the secondary palate itself (rather than in the early neural crest) would facilitate the in vivo validation of the observations made in MEPMs. We believe the generation of such tools and subsequent analysis of Pdgfra and Fgfr1 mutants, while certainly important, is outside the scope of this study. We chose not to include the in vivo data obtained from the Wnt1-Cre mutant palatal shelves in the main text, as the observed residual receptor expression precludes clear interpretation of these results."

In the case of FGF treatment, both MEK and PI3K inhibition increase the percentage of CC3+ cells, but MEK inhibition has a significantly greater effect, consistent with the induction of pJNK in this condition (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). In contrast, PI3K inhibition has a greater effect on apoptosis in PDGF treated cells, and again, both inhibitors show significantly increased apoptosis compared to PDGF treated cells alone. This result is not wholly surprising given the modest pJNK induction in the LY294002 dose response curve for PDGF treated cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B'</a>). In addition, both PD325901 and LY294002 are known to induce apoptosis in other cell types, and our results suggest intracellular signaling in response to FGF and PDGF stimulation exhibit different sensitivities to the apoptotic effect of these inhibitors. The CC3 measurements are generally consistent with the crystal violet assay, where FGF exhibits greater MEK dependence while PDGF-mediated effects on cell viability are sensitive to both MEK and PI3K inhibition (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>).

Regarding PI3K activation, it is important to note that our immunohistochemistry results identify regions of relative enrichment for pAkt and may not reflect an absolute lack of pAkt in regions that appear negative. In addition, PI3K can signal through Akt independent pathways, and it is possible PI3K activation recruits these other pathways outside the observed pAkt domains. While Pdgfra mRNA expression is ubiquitous throughout the palatal mesenchyme, receptor expression level, ligand distribution, or availability of intracellular signaling proteins may all affect the extent and function of PDGF signaling in different regions. It is also possible that PDGF signaling is necessary but not sufficient for PI3K activation and osteogenic differentiation. In this scenario, the spatially restricted patterns of pAkt induction and osteogenic differentiation may function as coincidence detectors that respond only to the coordinate activation of multiple signals. We have added a line in the Discussion mentioning these possibilities. One approach to unambiguously determine the functional role of PDGFR\u03b1 in the oral region could involve the use of a spatially specific Cre driver, but the tools to perform such an analysis are currently lacking."

This is also consistent with previous observations made with SEM (Kaufman. The Atlas of Mouse Development. 426-429, 1992) and H/E staining (Bush, JO, and Jiang, R. Development 139, 828\u2013828, 2012). However, it is intriguing to note that other databases, such as FaceBase depict contact between the palatal shelves at E14.5 (<a href=\"https://www.facebase.org/sites/default/files/SEM_images/anatomy.html\">https://www.facebase.org/sites/default/files/SEM_images/anatomy.html</a>). We suspect this discrepancy in the exact time of secondary palate fusion may be background dependent, as FaceBase uses C57BL/6 embryos. Regarding the sections from Fgfr1 mutant palatal shelves, we have replaced the original image with a lower magnification image from a different embryo (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>) to better orient the reader and have clarified in the figure legend that these are frontal sections."
