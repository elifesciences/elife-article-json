Previous studies have demonstrated a role for local translation in altering the structure and function of synapses during synapse formation and experience-dependent synaptic plasticity. In this study, we ask whether in addition to promoting local translation, local stimulation also triggers directed trafficking of RNAs from nucleus to stimulated synapses. Imaging of RNA localization and translation in cultured Aplysia sensory-motor neurons revealed that RNAs were delivered throughout the arbor of the sensory neuron, but that translation was enriched only at sites of synaptic contact and/or synaptic stimulation. Investigation of the mechanisms that trigger local translation revealed a role for calcium-dependent retrograde netrin-1/DCC receptor signaling. Spatially restricting gene expression by regulating local translation rather than by directing the delivery of mRNAs from nucleus to stimulated synapses maximizes the readiness of the entire neuronal arbor to respond to local cues."

Neurons are dramatically polarized and compartmentalized cells, elaborating axonal and dendritic processes that extend long distances and forming thousands of synaptic connections with other neurons. This polarity and compartmentalization poses challenges to the spatial regulation of gene expression during synapse formation and synaptic plasticity: how can the products of gene expression be restricted to specific synapses undergoing activity-dependent changes in structure and function? Many studies have demonstrated that mRNAs that constitutively localize to axonal growth cones in immature neurons and to dendrites in mature neurons undergo stimulus-induced translation, demonstrating that regulated translation of localized mRNAs provides one mechanism of spatially restricting neuronal gene expression (<a href=\"#bib1\">Aakalu et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Job and Eberwine, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Leung et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Lyles et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Smith et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Tsokas et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Wang et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Zheng et al., 2001</a>). Here, we set out to determine whether, in addition to regulating compartmentalized translation, local stimulation also regulates RNA trafficking from the soma to the synapse. We considered that the regulated trafficking of stimulus-induced transcripts from nucleus to stimulated synapse would provide a means of directly coupling the requirement for transcription with the requirement for local translation during synapse formation and plasticity."

Similarly, when isolated <i>Aplysia</i> sensory neurites, severed from their somata, are paired with motor neurons, they undergo a form of serotonin (5HT)-induced LTF that does not last as long as the LTF in cultures containing intact SNs (<a href=\"#bib16\">Grabham et al., 2005</a>). Together these studies demonstrate that newly transcribed mRNAs are required for persistent synaptic plasticity. This led us to ask whether, in addition to regulating local translation, synaptic stimulation regulates the trafficking of RNAs from the nucleus to specific subcellular sites."

Similarly, neurotrophins have been reported to regulate the concentration of specific mRNAs in axons of regenerating adult sensory neurons (<a href=\"#bib51\">Willis et al., 2007</a>). Neuronal activity also induces transcription of genes whose transcripts are subsequently transported into dendrites, including for example the immediate early gene Arc (<a href=\"#bib28\">Link et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Lyford et al., 1995</a>). In situ hybridization images of the <i>bclw</i> transcript in a recent study from <a href=\"#bib50\">Cosker et al (2013)</a> indicated that the mRNA localized to peripheral but not central axons of DRG neurons, suggesting that neurons are capable of directing transcripts from the soma to subsets of processes.

To examine synapse formation, we cultured a single bifurcated <i>Aplysia</i> SN with a target (L7) MN, with which it formed glutamatergic synapses, and a non-target (L11) MN, with which it fasciculated but did not form chemical synapses (<a href=\"#bib14\">Glanzman et al., 1990</a>). To study RNA localization during synapse-specific plasticity, we cultured bifurcated SNs with two target MNs and locally perfused 5HT onto the connection with one MN to produce synapse-specific LTF. We asked whether and how stimuli regulate RNA and protein localization and concentration by analyzing the distribution of ribosomal RNA (rRNA), messenger RNA (mRNA), RNA binding proteins, and translation factors. We found that rRNA, three specific mRNAs, ribosomal proteins, and translation factors were delivered throughout the SN, to both synaptic and non-synaptic sites, but that translation was significantly enriched at sites of synaptic contact and at sites of synaptic stimulation. These results indicate that the spatial regulation of gene expression in <i>Aplysia</i> sensory-motor neurons is mediated primarily at the level of translation rather than at the level of RNA targeting from the nucleus. These results, together with our previous study (<a href=\"#bib48\">Wang et al., 2009</a>) suggested the existence of a trans-synaptic signal that promotes translation of localized mRNAs. In investigating the nature of such a trans-synaptic signal, we uncovered a role for netrin-1/DCC signaling in local translation at synapses. Our findings are thus consistent with neurons delivering transcripts and translational machinery throughout the neuron, but with a synaptically restricted netrin-1-dependent signal triggering localized translation at synapses."

We have previously reported that local translation is spatially restricted to stimulated synapses during synapse-specific long-term facilitation (LTF) of SN-MN synapses (<a href=\"#bib48\">Wang et al 2009</a>); here, we asked whether local translation is also spatially restricted during synapse formation. To do this, we performed immunocytochemistry with anti-sensorin antibodies in sensory-motor cocultures (3DIV, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). Again, we chose to focus on sensorin because it is only expressed in the SN and thus the signal derives exclusively from the SN. As shown in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,C</a>, sensorin protein was present at much higher concentrations in SN branches contacting target MNs than in branches contacting non-target MNs.

We now conducted live imaging experiments with this reporter to directly measure local translation (as opposed to somatic translation followed by protein transport into the neurite during synapse formation) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D,F</a>). To do this, we expressed the reporter in bifurcated SNs contacting L7 and L11 MNs and removed the SN cell body so that we could specifically monitor translation in neuronal processes. We photoconverted dendra2 in the branches from green to red and used live imaging to detect the appearance of newly translated, green dendra2 signal, which we have previously demonstrated represents new translation (<a href=\"#bib48\">Wang et al., 2009</a>).

As shown in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D,E</a>, incubation with netrin-1 significantly increased sensorin immunoreactivity. To differentiate between stimulated local translation and stimulated somatic translation followed by transport into the branches, we cultured bifurcated SN-MN, removed the SN cell body, incubated with netrin-1, and processed the cultures 24 hr later for sensorin immunoreactivity (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A,C</a>). These experiments revealed that netrin-1 increased sensorin concentration equally well in branches contacting both L7 and L11 MNs, consistent with local stimulation of translation. Netrin-1 also increased peIF4E immunoreactivity in SN-LFS cultures in which the SN soma had been removed (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). The netrin-1-induced increase in sensorin immunoreactivity in intact SN-LFS cocultures was similar to that observed with five spaced applications of serotonin (5HT), which produces LTF of SN-MN synapses and which has been shown to promote sensorin translation (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>) (<a href=\"#bib18\">Hu et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Wang et al., 2009</a>). Moreover, netrin-1-induced translation in intact or soma-lacking SNs was blocked by pre-incubation with the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin (10 \u03bcM for 24 hr), indicating that the increased immunoreactivity did indeed result from increased translation (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a> and <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>)."

However, incubation of SN-L11 cocultures or L7-SN-L11 cocultures with netrin-1 did not result in the formation of synapse as shown by the absence of an excitatory post-synaptic potential (EPSP) in the L11 MN after SN stimulation (data not shown). We did find, however, that incubation with netrin-1 significantly increased EPSP amplitude between SN and LFS target MNs (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F,G</a>). The increase in EPSP amplitude was similar to that seen during LTF induced by five spaced applications of 5HT (data not shown). LTF induced by five applications of 5HT has also been shown to involve significant increases in the number of SN varicosities (sites of synaptic connections) in SN-MN cultures (<a href=\"#bib14\">Glanzman, et al., 1990</a>). We thus measured the effect of netrin-1 on varicosity numbers, and, as shown in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7H</a>, found that it significantly increased the number of SN synaptic varicosities in SN-LFS MN cultures. Together, these findings suggest that the local translation induced by netrin-1 increases synaptic strength and synapse number."

To test this, we incubated cultured neurons with recombinant netrin-1 in the presence of monoclonal anti-DCC antibodies that have previously been shown to block netrin-1 binding to the DCC receptor (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bennett et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Braisted et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Manitt et al., 2009</a>). We first showed that a 24 hr incubation of isolated SNs with netrin-1 triggered a significant increase in sensorin immunoreactivity, but that incubation of isolated SNs with anti-DCC (in the absence of netrin-1) did not change sensorin immunoreactivity (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A,B</a>). While anti-DCC antibodies had no effect on the basal concentration of sensorin in isolated SNs, they significantly decreased basal sensorin immunoreactivity in SN-MN cocultures (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C,D</a>). Taken together, these findings are consistent with netrin-1 being endogenously released from the post-synaptic MN and binding to DCC on the SN to promote pre-synaptic translation of sensorin."

Using a simple system consisting of a single, bifurcated <i>Aplysia</i> SN contacting a target L7 MN, with which it formed glutamatergic synapses, and a non-target L11 MN, with which it did not form chemical synapses, we asked whether and how synaptogenic signals regulate RNA localization and/or local translation. To determine how local stimulation spatially regulates gene expression, we cultured a single bifurcated SN with two target MNs and locally perfused 5HT onto the SN connections that formed onto one MN to produce synapse-specific LTF (<a href=\"#bib32\">Martin et al., 1997</a>). We used 18S and 28S rRNA FISH and S6-dendra2 overexpression to monitor the localization of rRNA; sensorin, \u03b2-thymosin and EF1\u03b1 FISH to monitor localization of three mRNAs, including one transcriptionally induced mRNA; and Staufen-dendra2 overexpression to monitor localization of an RBP previously reported to be involved in mRNA localization in neurons (<a href=\"#bib25\">Lebeau et al., 2011</a>). We monitored translation using quantitative immunocytochemistry for a SN-specific protein, sensorin. We monitored translation more globally by immunocytochemistry for the activated, phosphorylated forms of eIF4E and 4EBP, live imaging with a sensorin-based translational reporter (<a href=\"#bib48\">Wang et al., 2009</a>), and the recently described ribopuromylation method to visualize newly synthesized proteins (<a href=\"#bib8\">David et al., 2012</a>). The results of our experiments revealed that RNAs and translational machinery are delivered throughout the neuron, but that translation is spatially restricted to sites of synaptic contact or to stimulated synapses. They further indicate that the guidance factor netrin-1 promotes translation at synapses. Our findings are most consistent with a model in which synapse formation leads to the release of netrin-1 from the MN, which in turn triggers pre-synaptic DCC to promote translation in the pre-synaptic compartment."

Using this preparation, we find that the local proteome was regulated at the level of translation rather than by stimulus-induced mRNA targeting from the nucleus. Thus, transcripts, ribosomes, and translational machinery were delivered throughout the neuron, but translation was selectively activated in response to local stimuli such as synapse formation. We note that our studies do not rule out a role for more localized subcellular trafficking of mRNAs within neuronal processes, and/or selective stabilization within processes (as described in <a href=\"#bib11\">Farris et al. (2014)</a>), but they do indicate that synapse formation and synaptic stimulation do not regulate the trafficking from cell soma to process or synapse.

The finding that anti-DCC antibodies decrease sensorin immunoreactivity in SNs paired with MNs, but not in isolated SNs, is consistent with netrin-1 being released from the MN and binding to DCC on the adjacent pre-synaptic SN to promote the translation of sensorin at synapses. Netrin-1 binding to DCC may promote translation by releasing translational machinery from binding DCC cytoplasmic domains within the pre-synaptic terminal, as proposed by Flanagan et al. (2010). Alternatively, netrin-1-induced translation may be downstream of PI3 kinase and/or MAPK pathways, both of which are activated by netrin-1 binding to DCC (<a href=\"#bib27\">Li et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Round and Stein, 2007</a>)."

Our current finding that netrin-1 increases translation at synaptic and non-synaptic sites indicates that the precise subcellular localization of the mRNA is secondary to the localization of the netrin-1 signal. Thus, sensorin mRNA does not have to be in the synaptic milieu per se to be translated but rather has to localize to a site in which netrin-1/DCC signaling can occur. We also note that we previously found that there was an increase in the concentration of sensorin mRNA in SN branches contacting target as compared to non-target MNs in more mature (5 DIV) cocultures (<a href=\"#bib30\">Lyles et al., 2006</a>). This suggests that while there is not directed targeting of sensorin mRNA from soma to process during synapse formation, there may be preferential stabilization, over time, of sensorin mRNA at sites of synaptic contact. This finding is consistent with recent studies indicating that regulated RNA degradation functions to localize mRNAs and to limit translation within axons (<a href=\"#bib6\">Colak et al., 2013</a>)."

Decentralizing the control of gene expression to individual subcellular compartments in this manner enriches the adaptability and plasticity of the nervous system by enabling each compartment to change its proteome in response to local cues. This mechanism allows all the branches of a neuron to be in a state of readiness to respond to local stimuli by changing their local proteome and hence their synaptic structure and function."

The authors show fairly convincingly that, in these preparations, three different RNA species which are: (a) constitutively expressed; (b) trancriptionally induced by activity, or; (c) translationally controlled by activity are distributed equally between the two sensory neuron axons/ neurite. However, the last class (sensorin) is translated more efficiently in the synaptically connected branch. This increased translation correlates with increased eIF4e and 4-EBP phosphorylation. They further show that externally applied netrin, suggested to work as a translational activator and a synaptic signaling molecule can induce translation of sensorin RNA in SNs through a pathway that requires endogenous DCC and involves eIF4e phosphorylation. They also show that forced netrin expression in MNs induced sensorin translation in presynaptic SNs and that this requires calcium signaling in MNs."

Several published studies have taken advantage of this phenomenon (e.g. <a href=\"#bib14\">Glanzman, et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Kandel, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Martin et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Montarolo, et al., 1986</a>) though, as the reviewer points out, certainly not as many as have focused on learning-related synaptic plasticity. We very explicitly set out to study RNA localization and translation in the context of both local synapse formation and local 5HT-induced synaptic plasticity in our study. In particular, our aim was to examine a single neuron with two branches that received localized signals either as a result of synapse formation or as a result of local 5HT stimulation, since we recognized that this allowed us to study more broadly whether and how localized signals received at localized and distal subcellular compartments could regulate the trafficking of mRNAs out of the soma. We understand that the use of both types of preparations may generate some confusion and have done our best to revise the text to more clearly differentiate between the experiments involving synapse formation and those involving plasticity induced by acute 5HT stimulation."

Unfortunately, we have had technical difficulties in assaying netrin-1 expression in single SNs or MNs by FISH. We believe that this is because the RNAs are likely present at low concentrations, since when we overexpress ApNetrin-1, we can detect specific signal by FISH. Consistent with the idea that endogenous ApNetrin-1 (or another DCC ligand) does function to promote translation in sensory neurons, we show that function-blocking DCC antibodies prevent the induction of sensorin translation that is normally observed in SN upon pairing with a MN (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). As far as any effect of ApNetrin-1 on sensorin translation in MNs, we note that the MN does not express sensorin mRNA. Finally, we have now performed the experiment suggested by the reviewer, in which we use the DCC antibody to see if the labeling of the SN axon by the labeled netrin is based on netrin-DCC binding. This data is shown in <a href=\"#fig10s1\">Figure 10\u2013figure supplement 1</a>. Incubation of cultures with anti-DCC antibodies greatly inhibits the labeling of the SN with the ApNetrin expressed in the MN, consistent with ApNetrin binding to DCC on the SN."

The fifth figure shows translation, assayed by immunocytochemistry using sensorin and translation factor antibodies, and by using a live reporter to demonstrate that the translation is local. The sixth figure uses ribopuromycylation to show that this local restriction of translation likely involves a large number of mRNAs, which indicates that many RNAs are distributed equally well to SN branches contacting target and nontarget MNs. We could move this to a supplementary figure if the editors and reviewers felt this was important, but again we believe that the data in each figure make important and distinct points."
