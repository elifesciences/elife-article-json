                    "text": "Although molecular recognition is crucial for cellular signaling, mechanistic studies have relied primarily on ensemble measures that average over and thereby obscure underlying steps. Single-molecule observations that resolve these steps are lacking due to diffraction-limited resolution of single fluorophores at relevant concentrations. Here, we combined zero-mode waveguides with fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) to directly observe binding at individual cyclic nucleotide-binding domains (CNBDs) from human pacemaker ion channels critical for heart and brain function. Our observations resolve the dynamics of multiple distinct steps underlying cyclic nucleotide regulation: a slow initial binding step that must select a 'receptive' conformation followed by a ligand-induced isomerization of the CNBD. X-ray structure of the apo CNBD and atomistic simulations reveal that the isomerization involves both local and global transitions. Our approach reveals fundamental mechanisms underpinning ligand regulation of pacemaker channels, and is generally applicable to weak-binding interactions governing a broad spectrum of signaling processes."

Single-molecule observations that resolve these steps are lacking due to diffraction-limited resolution of single fluorophores at relevant concentrations. Here, we combined zero-mode waveguides with fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) to directly observe binding at individual cyclic nucleotide-binding domains (CNBDs) from human pacemaker ion channels critical for heart and brain function. Our observations resolve the dynamics of multiple distinct steps underlying cyclic nucleotide regulation: a slow initial binding step that must select a 'receptive' conformation followed by a ligand-induced isomerization of the CNBD. X-ray structure of the apo CNBD and atomistic simulations reveal that the isomerization involves both local and global transitions. Our approach reveals fundamental mechanisms underpinning ligand regulation of pacemaker channels, and is generally applicable to weak-binding interactions governing a broad spectrum of signaling processes."

Such electrical activity is a caused by ions moving in or out of the cells though a number of ion channel proteins in the cell surface membrane. The voltage across this cell membrane regulates the activity of these so-called pacemaking channels, and so do small molecules like cAMP. Nevertheless, it remained poorly understood how cAMP binding altered how the channels work. This was because researchers had been unable to unambiguously resolve the early binding events, because the available techniques were too limited."

This approach revealed that the binding process happens via a sequence of discrete steps. First, cAMP selectively binds when the binding site of the ion channel adopts a specific shape, called its \u201creceptive\u201d state. Second, part of the protein rotates which changes the shape of the binding site and traps the bound cAMP in place. The trapped molecule is not released until the binding site reverts to its previous shape."

However, our understanding of the dynamic events involved in these molecular recognition processes comes primarily from inferences based on downstream activity initiated by binding, or ensemble measures that average over and thereby obscure the underlying mechanistic steps. In contrast, single-molecule observations reveal dynamics and heterogeneity of conformational transitions that are otherwise averaged over in ensemble measurements, and thus are a means to probe specific molecular transitions providing important clues to the physical basis for binding (<a href=\"#bib25\">Joo et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Csermely et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Greives and Zhou, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Guo and Zhou, 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Ruiz and Karpen, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Miller, 1997</a>).

However, similar resolution of the fundamental mechanisms underlying individual ligand binding events that initiate or modulate downstream domain movements and pore gating are lacking, primarily due to technical challenges in imaging with both sufficient temporal resolution and at concentrations necessary to drive many physiologically relevant recognition processes."

Although binding of cyclic nucleotides is known to enhance HCN voltage-dependent activation, the mechanisms that underlie this regulation remain unclear. Previous studies of cyclic nucleotide (e.g. cAMP) regulation have relied primarily on ensemble channel currents (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chen et al., 2007</a>), or more recently on ensemble fluorescence from fcAMP (<a href=\"#bib31\">Kusch et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Benndorf et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Thon et al., 2015</a>), to deduce the dynamics of cyclic nucleotide association. Although fcAMP provides a more direct measure of binding than does downstream pore current, both measurements reflect ensemble-averaged data that obscures resolution of the individual steps involved in the binding process. Resolving the dynamics of these steps is important because it provides a rationale for assigning the effect of specific perturbations to distinct mechanistic steps \u2013 an invaluable tool for deconstructing the pathway by which binding is transduced to functional changes elsewhere such as at the pore gate."

Representative fluorescence time traces for fcAMP binding to single CNBD molecules are shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>. Unlike typical FRET experiments where both the donor and acceptor are immobilized, the donor (fcAMP) was free to diffuse in and out of the excitation volume surrounding the immobile acceptor on the CNBD. Because the time for free fcAMP to diffuse across the excitation volume (~1 ms) is extremely short compared to the duration of a single image frame (100 ms), we did not resolve the diffusion of fcAMP to or from the CNBD, but only observed increased fluorescence when fcAMP remained within the excitation volume for a time period comparable to or longer than the frame duration, as when bound to the CNBD. In addition, observation that excitation of a bound donor resulted primarily in an increase in acceptor emission, with little to no observable increase in donor emission, suggests that FRET efficiency between bound fcAMP and the nearby acceptor was close to 100%. This response is not due to blinking of a weakly excited acceptor during donor excitation because direct excitation of the acceptor on alternating frames resulted in stable acceptor emission intensities until the acceptor bleached. Furthermore, whenever fcAMP remained bound at the time of acceptor bleaching, we immediately observed emission from the donor. The FRET signal shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a> could also be abolished by competition with excess non-fluorescent cAMP (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), and thus represents a time-dependent binary readout for specific fcAMP binding at single molecules."

First, at the concentrations required to drive fcAMP binding, fluorescence from individual bound donors cannot be reasonably resolved apart from the freely diffusing donors within a diffraction-limited spot using traditional approaches such as confocal or TIRF microscopy. In contrast, ZMWs reduce the excitation volume beyond that achievable with TIRF, such that even at micromolar concentrations a sufficiently small number of fluorophores are excited that single bound donors can be detected (<a href=\"#bib34\">Levene et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Zhu and Craighead, 2012</a>) (e.g. donor fluorescence after acceptor bleaching in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). The combination of ZMWs and smFRET can further reduce background fluorescence from free donor and yet allow resolution of single binding events while limiting artifacts due to nonspecific binding at the surface (e.g. smFRET in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Furthermore, alternating between donor and acceptor excitation provides explicit information on the number of molecules within each ZMW in the form of acceptor bleach steps (e.g. acceptor fluorescence in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>)."

Maximum likelihood estimates of unbound and bound dwell time distributions required two exponential components each (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), whereas monoexponential distributions resulted in poor descriptions of the data, and triexponential distributions reduced to biexponential distributions in all cases (i.e. one component had zero amplitude). The probability that any of the observed unbound or bound time distributions were monoexponential as opposed to biexponential was less than 0.001 as determined from a \u03c7<sup>2</sup> distribution with two degrees of freedom corresponding to twice the difference in their log likelihoods. The biexponentially distributed dwell times suggest that either each CNBD can sample two unbound and two bound metastable conformations with two corresponding rate constants for each process, or our data is comprised of a bimodal population of CNBD molecules, each with distinct single-step binding dynamics. In the latter case, the correlation between the average bound versus unbound time for each isolated CNBD should cluster into two groups corresponding to the time constants for binding and unbinding in each population. However, at all observed fcAMP concentrations the per molecule average unbound versus bound time distribution was centered around the weighted average of the two pairs of time constants and broadly distributed between them (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). This behavior suggests dynamic heterogeneity, where each individual CNBD molecule was able to repeatedly interconvert between two unbound (U1 and U2) and two bound (B1 and B2) configurations during a typical recording (~1 min.). Furthermore, individual bound durations did not depend on the preceding unbound duration, consistent with sequential models of binding (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2B\u2013D</a>)."

Consistent with dwell time distributions discussed above, models with two unbound (U1, U2) and two bound (B1, B2) states performed better than models with fewer states, whereas adding additional unbound and bound states did not improve the likelihood. Remarkably, all of the models with two bound states converged to a similar set of rate constants governing an initial binding step followed by a subsequent first order transition (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). The most direct interpretation of this finding is that the CNBD undergoes a reversible conformational change between distinct cAMP-bound conformations.

                                "text": "To test whether the binding dynamics that we observed in monomeric CNBDs were reflective of their functional dynamics in tetrameric channels, we generated CNBD tetramers using a GCN4 tetramerization motif N-terminal of the CNBD to mimic the S6 helices of the channel pore (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Although neither monomeric nor tetrameric constructs are attached to a true channel pore, the tetramer is a useful construct for testing the role of inter-CNBD interactions that are likely to play a role in channel regulation (e.g. cAMP induces tetramerization of isolated CNBDs even in the absence of a channel pore [<a href=\"#bib35\">Lolicato et al., 2011</a>]). To resolve the dynamics of the first of four binding steps, we observed fluorescence from bound fcAMP at tetramers deposited in ZMWs bathed in 300 nM fcAMP (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3I</a>). At this concentration, single binding events can be resolved directly from the emission intensity time course of fcAMP (see <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s4\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 4</a>), and thus acceptor labels on tetramers were bleached prior to recording fluorescence from direct excitation of fcAMP (in contrast, smFRET was needed to resolve binding at higher fcAMP concentrations in monomers; see <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Analysis of the first binding step in CNBD tetramers confirms that the biexponential nature of the bound time distributions are an inherent property of CNBDs both in isolation and in tetrameric complexes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3J</a>). Taken together, dwell time analysis for monomers and tetramers and HMM modeling show that following binding, individual CNBDs interconvert between two bound conformations with distinct lifetimes (as discussed below)."

                                "text": "To gain structural perspective into the observed single-molecule dynamics, we turned to X-ray crystallography. Several structures of the cAMP-bound (holo) CNBD from eukaryotic HCN channels have been solved (<a href=\"#bib61\">Zagotta et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Xu et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Lolicato et al., 2011</a>). However, a unique conformation of the unliganded (apo) CNBD from HCN channels has been recalcitrant to crystallization, with the only reported crystal of the apo form containing a conformation essentially identical to the ligand-bound form (<a href=\"#bib54\">Taraska et al., 2009</a>) (less than 1 \u00c5 RMSD difference between the two). Distance constraints from nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy has been used to generate a structural model of the apo form of the HCN2 CNBD (<a href=\"#bib50\">Saponaro et al., 2014</a>), but this structure has many features that are not consistent with other cyclic nucleotide binding domains found in the Protein Data Bank (<a href=\"#bib10\">Clayton et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Kim et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Schunke et al., 2011</a>). These discrepancies include complete unfolding of the conserved P-helix in the phosphate binding cassette (PBC) and an unexpectedly high degree of conformational flexibility in the \u03b2-roll domain. Hence, we crystallized and solved the structure of the apo HCN2 CNBD as part of a fusion protein with the maltose binding protein (MBP) in order to provide a high-resolution counterpart to the existing holo crystal structures. An overview of the structure and representative electron densities are presented in <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, and crystallographic statistics are given in <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>. The crystallized construct lacks the first three \u03b1-helices of the C-linker, making it unable to tetramerize. As discussed below, this was a key factor because tetramers favor a closed conformation typical of the nucleotide-bound CNBD. The majority of the crystal contacts are formed by MBP, which is significantly more ordered as compared to the CNBD (mean B-factors for MBP\u00a0=\u00a022.9 \u00c5<sup>2</sup>, and CNBD\u00a0=\u00a043.2 \u00c5<sup>2</sup>), making it unlikely that crystal packing interactions contribute significantly to the observed structure of the HCN2 CNBD (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). As discussed below, the overall conformation of the CNBD monomer is substantially the same as that found by NMR (<a href=\"#bib50\">Saponaro et al., 2014</a>), further suggesting that the structure observed in the crystal is not appreciably altered by crystal contacts or fusion with MBP."

The result of these rotations is the closed conformation in which the C-helix swings toward the ligand binding site and caps bound cAMP. The core \u03b2-roll structure is essentially invariant to the presence of ligand (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Strikingly, when the N- and C-terminal helical termini are treated as a single module, they too can be well superposed between the apo and holo conformations (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). This indicates that the hinge-like motions of both termini (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E\u2013F</a>) are coordinated in a way that the \u03b1-helical structures combine to form a single rigid body domain. The coordinated movement of N- and C-terminal domains is necessitated by the fact that motion of the C-helix toward cAMP introduces numerous steric clashes with the apo conformation of the N-terminal domain (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>). These clashes are relieved in the holo conformation by an upward movement of the N-terminus by as much as 7 \u00c5 (compare <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A and B</a>), ultimately placing the N-terminal C-linker into a tetramerization-competent state. This conformational coupling between the two \u03b1-helical domains enables cAMP-induced structural changes to be transmitted across the entire CNBD toward the gating pore. This idea is illustrated schematically for a pair of CNBDs in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H</a>."

However, MD simulations are useful for further understanding how the ligand (cAMP) stabilizes the holo structure at both local and global scales. Along this line, we have carried out microsecond MD simulations for the holo structure with cAMP removed from the binding site, and for the apo structure with cAMP manually docked into the binding site; cAMP-bound holo simulation and apo simulation without any ligand were also carried out to serve as controls and references (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). These simulations are not designed to probe the conformational transition pathway; indeed, the holo simulation with cAMP removed does not correspond to a process in the proposed kinetic model (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). Instead, by monitoring structural responses to a change in the ligation state, we are able to identify structural motifs that are most directly stabilized by cAMP binding; this is not straightforward to accomplish by examining the static crystal structures alone, especially when allosteric effects are implicated."

At the local scale, the most visible trend concerns the structural stability of the P-helix, which adopts a 3<sub>10</sub> helical configuration in the apo crystal structure but an \u03b1-helix in the holo crystal structure. In the holo-cAMP simulation, two key i/i\u00a0+\u00a04 helical contacts (E582-L586 and C584-R588) are seen to readily break, while an i/i\u00a0+\u00a03 contact (G581-C584) characteristic of a 3<sub>10</sub> helix is formed; in the holo+cAMP control simulations, the aforementioned i/i\u00a0+\u00a04 contacts remain stable during the microsecond simulation while the G581-C584 contact is not formed. Similarly, in the apo+cAMP simulation, the two i/i\u00a0+\u00a04 helical contacts are clearly more stable than in the apo-cAMP control simulation (although the C584-R588 contact constantly breaks and forms with a duration for the bound state spanning from\u00a0~10\u2013100 ns), while the G581-C584 contact becomes less stable once cAMP is docked into the apo structure.

Here, we show that ZMW\u2019s in conjunction with smFRET can resolve individual specific binding events in the presence of concentrations of at least 10 \u00b5M fluorescent species, extending single-molecule approaches to more physiologically relevant lower affinity binding events than previously possible while eliminating the influence of non-specific binding (e.g. <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) (<a href=\"#bib63\">Zhu and Craighead, 2012</a>). Our observations resolve the dynamics of the distinct events that underlie cyclic nucleotide association in HCN channels, and reveal that cAMP selectively binds to the \u2018receptive\u2019 state of the CNBD, and thereafter induces an isomerization between two distinct bound conformations. As expected given its modular nature (e.g. isolated CNBDs retain similar binding affinities to full length channels and form cAMP-induced tetramers in solution [<a href=\"#bib35\">Lolicato et al., 2011</a>]), we show that this isomerization occurs in both monomeric and tetrameric CNBD complexes, and thus is likely to reflect inherent properties of the CNBD in channels.

HMM modeling suggests that binding occurs selectively from one of two unbound states, which implies that the interchange between these states involves an occlusion of the binding site in the apo form, likely by the C-helix.

Thus, the initial encounter complex is either relatively unstable, such that brief encounters shorter than our frame rate were not observed, or it sees a significant barrier to its formation. Regardless, following formation of the initial bound complex the CNBD undergoes a reversible isomerization between two bound forms. Comparison of apo and holo X-ray structures shows that the N- and C-terminal helices are rotated in the isomerized state where the C-helix caps the binding site (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Thus, the observed isomerization may reflect dynamic movement of the C-helix between apo and holo positions (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). However, we cannot rule out the possibility that the C-helix also moves during the initial binding step; indeed, by perturbing the ligation state of the CNBD in holo and apo structures in otherwise unbiased molecular dynamics simulations at the microsecond scale, we observe that the cyclic nucleotide has a direct impact on the structure of the P-helix and orientation of the B, C helices in the C-terminal region (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). In this case, the subsequent isomerization may involve rearrangements in the N-terminal C-linker, a region that was truncated in order to obtain the apo structure, and therefore for which we have incomplete structural information regarding its unliganded form. Nonetheless, these data establish the dynamics of the distinct events that underlie both selective binding and cAMP-induced conformational changes that regulate the channel pore. We note, however, that although it is highly plausible that fcAMP and cAMP bind with similar dynamics given their similar affinities and functional effects, we cannot rule out the possibility that cAMP association dynamics differ from those observed here for fcAMP."

Crucially, the C-helix that caps the bound ligand moves in conjunction with the N-terminal helices connected to the tetramerization module (C-linker) and channel pore. Thus, a reciprocal relationship between ligand binding and tetramerization inevitably follows: ligand binding is expected to shift the equilibrium toward tetramerization and, in turn, anything that promotes tetramerization would be expected to enhance ligand binding. This idea is schematically illustrated in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4h</a>, and provides a facile explanation for cAMP-induced tetramerization of monomeric CNBDs in bulk solution and lower affinity for cAMP of CNBDs lacking a C-linker (<a href=\"#bib35\">Lolicato et al., 2011</a>)."

However, these various bound states have previously never been directly observed. Our studies here provide direct evidence for such a binding process, and also shed new light on a long-standing debate about the transition pathways that define the binding mechanism\u2013conformational selection versus induced fit. We find that the initial step involves selective binding to the \u2018receptive\u2019 state (U1), which thereafter undergoes a conformational change that traps the ligand in the bound conformation (B2). Our observations reveal the dynamics and structural detail of the distinct steps that underlie cyclic nucleotide regulation of HCN pacemaker channels, and lay the necessary foundation to probe the molecular details involved in each separate step of multi-subunit complexes. The combination of dynamic and structural observations provide a general approach for revealing the molecular details governing signaling based on weak-binding, a critical and previously inaccessible class of molecular recognition processes."

Briefly, for each ZMW array, the simultaneously recorded image time series for donor (fcAMP) and acceptor-labeled CNBD emission intensities were each further split into two sets of interleaved frames corresponding to direct excitation of either the donor or acceptor. The resulting four image time series are denoted I<sub>DD</sub> (donor emission upon direct excitation), I<sub>DA</sub> (donor emission upon acceptor excitation), I<sub>AA</sub> (acceptor emission direct excitation) and I<sub>AD</sub> (acceptor emission upon donor excitation). The locations of ZMWs in I<sub>AA</sub> (which are the same in I<sub>AD</sub>) that contained one or more CNBD molecules was obtained from a thresholded mask of the average intensity in the first\u00a0~20 frames of I<sub>AA</sub>, which corresponds to a time period where most acceptors remained unbleached. ZMW locations were further refined by fitting a two dimensional Gaussian to the local intensity height map. The corresponding ZMW locations in I<sub>DD</sub> were obtained by applying a two dimensional affine transformation that mapped the acceptor emission image from one camera to the donor emission image in the other camera. The time-dependent fluorescence at each ZMW was obtained by projecting the average image intensity in a 5-pixel diameter circle centered on the ZMW location throughout each image time series. I<sub>DA</sub> was indistinguishable from a constant background, and thereby ignored in further analyses. Only those ZMWs that exhibited a single acceptor bleach step in I<sub>AA</sub> corresponding to one CNBD molecule were considered for further analysis."

Next, I<sub>AD</sub> was baseline corrected by subtracting the mean intensity after acceptor bleaching, and in some cases where it was visually apparent also subtracting a very slow exponential decay (t\u00a0~100 s). Binding dynamics were determined by idealization of I<sub>AD</sub> prior to acceptor bleaching using the software vbFRET (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bronson et al., 2009</a>) and allowing for a maximum of two idealized levels. vbFRET accepts as input both a donor (I<sub>D</sub>) and acceptor (I<sub>A</sub>) time series, and idealizes the smFRET response given by I<sub>A</sub>/(I<sub>A</sub>+I<sub>D</sub>). However, I<sub>DD</sub> was not anticorrelated with I<sub>AD</sub> due to the fact that the donor was on the freely diffusing ligand, and therefore not present in the excitation volume throughout the experiment. Thus, to avoid adding noise during the idealization, I<sub>AD</sub> was idealized directly by providing vbFRET with I<sub>A</sub>=I<sub>AD</sub> and I<sub>D</sub>= max(I<sub>AD</sub>)-I<sub>AD</sub>, which results in a smFRET response that is an arbitrarily scaled copy of I<sub>AD</sub>. The idealized records were overlaid on the raw I<sub>AD</sub> data series after applying the reverse scaling and baseline shifting, and examined visually. ZMWs with either no idealized events or whose idealization did not pass visual inspection were removed from further analysis. The signal to noise ratio (S/N) for I<sub>AD</sub> was computed as the ratio of the rescaled idealized amplitude to the RMS noise for all unbound time points. The distribution of S/N for all ZMWs was well described by a gamma function, and ZMWs with S/N\u00a0&lt;\u00a02 were rejected from further analysis. The idealization and HMM analyses described here were able to reproduce known models given simulated data at this S/N cutoff. The idealized smFRET time series were interpreted as a binary unbound versus bound time-dependent signal."

Models were globally optimized to simultaneously describe idealized binding time series for all molecules across all tested fcAMP concentrations with a dead time of 200 ms. For each molecule, the first and last event was removed from the analysis to avoid interpretation of events truncated by our recording window or bleaching of the acceptor, respectively. The number of molecules (and binding or unbinding events) that went into the analysis at each fcAMP concentration was: 0.1 \u00b5M: 1234 (1808), 0.3 \u00b5M: 988 (1950), 1 \u00b5M: 2028 (7795), 3 \u00b5M: 1064 (4952) and 10 \u00b5M: 1085 (2025). This was more than enough events for the analysis to reproduce known models with similar rates from simulated data. The observation time window prior to acceptor bleaching, and hence the number of events per molecule varied stochastically. Nonetheless, inclusion of molecules with few events (i.e. that bleached rapidly) did not grossly distort our modeling results as very similar rate constants were obtained from the subset of molecules exhibiting 10 or more events prior to bleaching."

Furthermore, for example, missed brief unbound events will cause bound durations to appear longer than they actually are, which likely contributes to some distortion of our reported dwell times. Most importantly, if such an artifact were to underlie our observation of multiple bound durations, then we predict that with increasing fcAMP concentration (and decreasing average unbound duration) we would observe increasingly lengthy apparent bound durations. However, bound time distributions were not obviously concentration dependent, nor were the relative amplitudes or time constants of their maximum likelihood biexponential fits (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Thus, any distortions to the dwell times are minor, and our observations reflect aspects of the cAMP association process. Furthermore, our observed kinetics are roughly consistent with prior predictions of cAMP association rates based on macroscopic observations using patch clamp fluorimetry (<a href=\"#bib31\">Kusch et al., 2012</a>)."

Typically, 0.2\u20130.4 ml of protein:precipitant solution was prepared and drops of varying sizes (5\u201315 \u00b5l) were hung over 0.5, 0.75 or 1.0 ml well solutions of precipitant. Microcrystals formed readily in the oil phase overnight but over a\u00a0few weeks clusters of stacked plates nucleated randomly in some of the drops in the aqueous phase. Individual plate fragments that could by dissected away from the stacks had typical dimensions of 100\u00a0\u00d7 200 \u00d7\u00a020 \u00b5m. Crystals were cryoprotected by transferring into a precipitant solution containing 6 mM maltose, 5.5% v/v of 1,6-hexanediol for one minute followed by loop mounting and dipping into liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data were collected at the GM/CA beamline 23-ID-B (Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL) and processed with HKL2000 (<a href=\"#bib41\">Otwinowski and Minor, 1997</a>). Free reflections were selected with PHENIX (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adams et al., 2010</a>) using \u2018use-lattice-symmetry\u2019 option. The structure was solved by molecular replacement with two copies of MPB (PDB ID 1ANF) using Phaser (<a href=\"#bib37\">Mccoy et al., 2007</a>). The initial model was built by ARP/wARP (<a href=\"#bib42\">Perrakis et al., 2001</a>). This was followed by iterative cycles of manual model building in Coot (<a href=\"#bib15\">Emsley and Cowtan, 2004</a>) and restrained and TLS refinement in Refmac (<a href=\"#bib52\">Skub\u00e1k et al., 2004</a>). The crystal that gave the highest quality data appears to have been pseudo-merohedrally twinned with a twin fraction of approximately 0.15. To account for this, a twin refinement against amplitudes was included in the Refmac refinement protocol. Large-scale domain motions were analyzed using DynDom (<a href=\"#bib19\">Girdlestone and Hayward, 2016</a>). The structural alignments over a rigid \u03b2-roll cage excluded P-helix and flexible loops and were performed with CCP4 program Superpose (<a href=\"#bib29\">Krissinel and Henrick, 2004</a>) using C\u03b1 atoms of residues 533\u2013550, 553\u2013565, 571\u2013581 and 589\u2013606.

NAMD\u2019s Particle Mesh Ewald algorithm was used for electrostatics with a grid spacing of 1 \u00c5. All nonbonded interactions were treated with a 12 \u00c5 cutoff and a switching function turned on at 10 \u00c5. For both the apo (this study) and holo (PDB 1Q5O) structures, simulations were performed in the presence or absence of cAMP in the binding site. For the monomeric holo structure, only residues 494 to 634 were included for consistency with simulations of the apo structure which lacked most of the C-linker. The initial apo structure in the presence of cAMP was generated by aligning the backbone atoms of the \u03b2-roll for the apo crystal structure to the same atoms in the holo structure by minimizing their RMSD, and then inserting the coordinates of cAMP from the holo structure into the apo structure. The built-in CY35 patch for the CHARMM36 force field was used for the topology of cAMP (<a href=\"#bib23\">Hart et al., 2012</a>). The N- and C-termini were neutralized using the ACE and CT3 patches (<a href=\"#bib7\">Best et al., 2012</a>), respectively, to mitigate charge effects due to the truncation of the protein sequence. Each system was solvated in TIP3P water with 150 mM KCl using the built-in plugin in VMD (<a href=\"#bib24\">Humphrey et al., 1996</a>) and energy minimized for 500 fs with all heavy atoms constrained. Next, constraints on all non-hydrogen atoms other than C\u03b1 and cAMP (if present) were released, and an additional 7 ps of energy minimization was performed. With C\u03b1 and cAMP still constrained, systems were heated to 310 K over 4 ps, and then equilibrated at constant pressure in the NPT ensemble for 1 ns. The average system dimensions over the final 10 ps were determined and used during the production runs, which were performed in the NVT ensemble as described above. All analysis was performed using VMD (<a href=\"#bib24\">Humphrey et al., 1996</a>). Trajectories shown in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> were smoothed by applying a running average with 30 ns window."

They used a combination of single-molecule FRET with kinetic modeling, X-ray crystallography, and molecular dynamics simulations. The dwell-time distributions with fluorescence cAMP (fcAMP) indicate that the C-terminal fragment exists in two cyclic nucleotide-bound states and two unbound states. The kinetic modeling suggests an allosteric mechanism where the C-terminal fragment exists in two conformations, with cyclic nucleotide-binding exclusively to the \"receptive\" conformation and stabilizing the conformational change. X-ray crystallography of the apo state of the cyclic nucleotide-binding domain (CNBD) suggests that the conformational change induced by cAMP binding involves a concerted movement of the C-helix and N-terminal helices of the CNBD around the \u03b2 roll. They present molecular dynamics simulations to support the structures obtained with crystallography."

The use of zero mode waveguides in combination with single-molecule FRET to examine binding of fcAMP to the CNBD is technically innovative, and allows for quantitative kinetic modeling of fcAMP binding. While the mechanism uncovered is not new, the single-molecule analysis is a rigorous demonstration of the mechanism. The crystal structure of the apo state of the CNBD complements the previously solved NMR and EPR structures and highlights interesting differences between the methods. The molecular dynamics simulations seem to add less insight to the paper compared to the single-molecule FRET and X-ray crystallography experiments."

It might well be that the current simulation of U1 with cAMP modeled-in is capturing some of those early adaptations (i.e. the U1 to B1 transition), and that the larger-scale changes (from B1 to B2) will take place in a much longer time-scale \u2013 but the manuscript does not include data to support or refute this notion."

In analogy with the apo-state simulations, the authors simulate this holo-like structure with cAMP bound, as seen in existing X-ray structures, and after removing cAMP from the binding pocket \u2013 and in both cases a 1-microsecond trajectory is calculated. The aim of the latter simulation seems to be to observe the return of the CNBD structure to the unliganded form, U1, and indeed this simulation shows changes that are consistent with that state (e.g. the change in pitch of the P-helix). However, what we find problematic here is that the structural state that is simulated, namely B2, does not interconvert with U1 according the kinetic model derived from the single-molecule data. B2 is in equilibrium with B1, which is also a bound state but has a different structure, and so the purpose and interpretation of this simulation in which cAMP is deleted from the B2 state is unclear. (We can imagine how this kind of approach could provide preliminary insights into the nature of the apo-state structure, if this structure was unknown, but this is not the case here.)"

In order to have a more meaningful and compelling computational component, the authors might want to focus on specific aspects of the recognition process, as captured by the existing X-ray structures (e.g. the changes in the P-helix), and design a set of a simulations that conclusively demonstrate a causal connection between cAMP binding and the structural changes observed. Alternatively, the existing simulation data could be reanalyzed/reinterpreted/presented with a different focus, so as to complement the experimental data (e.g. ligand-protein interactions, consistency of fluorophore-labeled bound/unbound ensembles with unlabeled structures, etc.)."

In analogy with the apo-state simulations, the authors simulate this holo-like structure with cAMP bound, as seen in existing X-ray structures, and after removing cAMP from the binding pocket \u2013 and in both cases a 1-microsecond trajectory is calculated. The aim of the latter simulation seems to be to observe the return of the CNBD structure to the unliganded form, U1, and indeed this simulation shows changes that are consistent with that state (e.g. the change in pitch of the P-helix). However, what we find problematic here is that the structural state that is simulated, namely B2, does not interconvert with U1 according the kinetic model derived from the single-molecule data. B2 is in equilibrium with B1, which is also a bound state but has a different structure, and so the purpose and interpretation of this simulation in which cAMP is deleted from the B2 state is unclear. (We can imagine how this kind of approach could provide preliminary insights into the nature of the apo-state structure, if this structure was unknown, but this is not the case here.)</i> "

In order to have a more meaningful and compelling computational component, the authors might want to focus on specific aspects of the recognition process, as captured by the existing X-ray structures (e.g. the changes in the P-helix), and design a set of a simulations that conclusively demonstrate a causal connection between cAMP binding and the structural changes observed. Alternatively, the existing simulation data could be reanalyzed/reinterpreted/presented with a different focus, so as to complement the experimental data (e.g. ligand-protein interactions, consistency of fluorophore-labeled bound/unbound ensembles with unlabeled structures, etc.).</i> "

Briefly, considering the slow time scale associated with the U1-B1 and B1-B2 transitions, and the fact that there is little explicit experimental characterization for the B1 state, we do not anticipate that molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for these transitions are warranted. However, MD simulations are useful for further understanding how the ligand (cAMP) stabilizes the holo structure at both local and global scales. By monitoring structural responses to a change in the ligation state (e.g., holo-cAMP and apo+cAMP), we are able to identify structural motifs that are most directly stabilized by cAMP binding; this is not straightforward to accomplish by examining the static crystal structures alone, especially when allosteric effects are implicated."
