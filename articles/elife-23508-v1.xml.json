Yet, little is known regarding the physiological consequences of morphological variability. We quantify animal-to-animal variability in cable lengths (CV = 0.4) and branching patterns in the Gastric Mill (GM) neuron, an identified neuron type with highly-conserved physiological properties in the crustacean stomatogastric ganglion (STG) of <i>Cancer borealis</i>. We examined passive GM electrotonic structure by measuring the amplitudes and apparent reversal potentials (E<sub>rev</sub>s) of inhibitory responses evoked with focal glutamate photo-uncaging in the presence of TTX. Apparent E<sub>rev</sub>s were relatively invariant across sites (mean CV + SD =0.04 + 0.01; 7-20 sites in each of 10 neurons), which ranged between 100-800 \u00b5m from the somatic recording site. Thus, GM neurons are remarkably electrotonically compact (estimated \u03bb &gt; 1.5 mm). Electrotonically compact structures, in consort with graded transmission, provide an elegant solution to observed morphological variability in the STG."
