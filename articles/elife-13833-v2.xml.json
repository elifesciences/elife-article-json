                        "text": "As we interact with the world, our movements are selected based on external sensory stimuli and internal variables representing action value, learned stimulus-response contingencies, and prior experiences (<a href=\"#bib20\">Gold and Shadlen, 2007</a>). Selecting the movement associated with the most desirable outcome requires appropriately weighting each of these factors. While the neural substrates for movements based on external sensory stimuli have been the focus of much research (<a href=\"#bib24\">Hall and Moschovakis, 2003</a>), where, how, and when internal goals influence movement selection is less well understood. The basal ganglia (BG) are known to be involved in motor control (<a href=\"#bib31\">Hikosaka and Wurtz, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Mink, 1996</a>), contributing to movement selection by modulating inhibition on competing downstream motor structures (<a href=\"#bib4\">Basso and Wurtz, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Di Chiara et al., 1979</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Hikosaka and Wurtz, 1985</a>). In particular, the BG have been thought to bias the selection of movements towards those associated with the highest value (<a href=\"#bib27\">Hikosaka et al., 2006</a>). This 'value-biasing' hypothesis is supported by much evidence showing that activity in several BG nuclei is modulated, prior to stimulus presentation, by reward expectation (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bryden et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Handel and Glimcher, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Hikosaka et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Kawagoe et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Sato and Hikosaka, 2002</a>) such that movements toward high-value targets are disinhibited relative to movements toward low-value targets (<a href=\"#bib27\">Hikosaka et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Lauwereyns et al., 2002</a>). Anatomical evidence is consistent with a primary role for the BG in mediating the integration of value-based information into motor plans (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bolam et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Gerfen and Surmeier, 2011</a>). However, movement selection may also be guided by other internal representations, such as recent movements and their outcomes (<a href=\"#bib9\">Corrado et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Fecteau and Munoz, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Lau and Glimcher, 2005</a>). We therefore asked whether BG activity mediates the influence of internal goals, in addition to value, on movement selection."

Specifically, we would expect that internally-specified movements would be promoted relative to otherwise-identical stimulus-guided movements, just as more valuable movements have been shown to be promoted relative to otherwise-identical less valuable movements (<a href=\"#bib27\">Hikosaka et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Sato and Hikosaka, 2002</a>). Notably, it is has been proposed that Parkinsonian patients exhibit more pronounced bradykinesia when initiating internally-specified than stimulus-guided movements because the latter engage pathways outside of the BG (<a href=\"#bib19\">Glickstein and Stein, 1991</a>). However, whether the BG themselves are differentially engaged by these two types of movements has not been tested."

Using a design akin to that of other recent studies (<a href=\"#bib43\">Pastor-Bernier and Cisek, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Seo et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Ito and Doya, 2015</a>), in alternating blocks of trials, the rewarded direction was either determined by a sensory cue or by internal representations informed by recent trial history. Critically, we designed the task such that correct movements were equally valuable in both conditions. We found that SNr activity predictably differed between these two conditions, supporting the idea that the BG mediate the influence on movement selection of internal goals. We interpret these results, in the context of a simple model of BG output (<a href=\"#bib27\">Hikosaka et al., 2006</a>), as suggesting that internally-specified movements may be promoted over stimulus-guided movements by BG activity."

                                "text": "We trained mice on a delayed-response spatial choice task comprised of interleaved blocks of 'stimulus-guided' (SG) trials, in which the direction of movement is selected based on a sensory stimulus (<a href=\"#bib54\">Uchida and Mainen, 2003</a>), and 'internally-specified' (IS) trials, in which the direction of an otherwise-identical movement is selected based on internal representations informed by recent trial history (see Materials and methods; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>). In each trial of the task, the mouse is presented with a binary odor mixture at a central port, waits for an auditory go cue, and moves to the left or right reward port for a water reward. In SG trials, the dominant component of the odor mixture \u2013 which varies trial by trial \u2013 determines the side at which reward will be delivered, while in IS trials, a balanced mixture of the two odors is always presented but reward is delivered at only one side throughout the block (see Materials and methods; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Thus, while both trial types require the mouse to sample the stimulus, in SG trials the stimulus indicates that the rewarded side is determined by the odor mixture and in IS trials the stimulus indicates that the rewarded side is determined by the recent history of choices and outcomes. We found that mice were able to infer (unsignaled) transitions between the SG and IS blocks and switch their response mode accordingly: during SG blocks, mice were equally likely to choose the left and right port (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, gray boxes) reflecting a dependence on the odor mixture (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>), while during IS blocks, mice reliably returned to the same (rewarded) port in each trial (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, white boxes). We quantified performance in IS blocks by calculating, for each block, the percentage of correct trials and the number of error events, defined as a run of consecutive incorrect choices (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). Finally, we reasoned that if a mouse were to recognize that a given trial belonged to an IS block, it could prepare its movement in advance and would therefore be able to reach the reward port faster (<a href=\"#bib42\">Niemi and N\u00e4\u00e4t\u00e4nen, 1981</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Poulton, 1950</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Seo et al., 2012</a>). Indeed, across the population of sessions, we found that reaction time \u2013 defined as the time from the go cue to reward port entry \u2013 was shorter in IS trials than in the 'easy' SG trials in the same session [<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>; we used only easy SG trials (mixture ratios of 95/5, 80/20, 20/80, and 5/95) to control for a potential dependence of reaction time on difficulty; population of sessions: p\u00a0=\u00a01.7 \u00d7 10<sup>\u221211</sup>, paired t-test; individual sessions: IS shorter than SG in 46/108, SG shorter than IS in 3/108, p&lt;0.05, Wilcoxon rank-sum test; ipsiversive and contraversive trials compared separately]. Together, these data suggest that, as intended, the direction of movement in SG blocks is selected based on the stimulus while the direction of movements in IS blocks is selected based on recent trial history. We therefore utilized this behavioral assay to compare how stimulus-guided and internally-specified movements are mediated by the BG, as described below."

In this case, we would predict that BG output would depend on whether the movement was internally specified or stimulus guided, and specifically, in our task, on the degree to which recent trial history is informative of rewarded direction. To test this prediction we examined activity in the SNr, a BG output known to be involved in orienting movements (<a href=\"#bib3\">Basso and Sommer, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Handel and Glimcher, 2000</a>, <a href=\"#bib25\">1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Hikosaka and Wurtz, 1983a</a>, <a href=\"#bib29\">1983b</a>). We recorded from 296 well-isolated left SNr neurons (see Materials and methods; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>) in four mice performing the task\u00a0(see <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). Data from one example neuron are shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>, segregated by reward port selected (ipsilateral vs. contralateral to the recording side) and by trial type (SG vs. IS). The activity of this neuron clearly depends on both movement direction and trial type. To examine these dependencies across the population of neurons we first examined firing rate during the delay epoch, defined as the time from odor valve open to the time of odor port exit (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, gray box), which most directly captures, across trial types, activity underlying selection of the direction of movement (but since activity in IS trials may, by design, reflect direction selection even before stimulus delivery, we subsequently examine activity in other epochs). Based on the firing rate during this epoch in SG and IS trials, we then calculated direction preference (see Materials and methods). This value ranges from -1 (strongly 'prefers' ipsiversive) to 1 (strongly prefers contraversive), where 0 represents no preference. We found that 216/296 neurons displayed a significant direction preference (p&lt;0.05) during the delay epoch, with about as many preferring ipsiversive (94/216) as contraversive (122/216) movements (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Since SNr activity has been shown to exhibit both movement-related increases and decreases (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bryden et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Gulley et al., 2002</a>, <a href=\"#bib23\">1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Handel and Glimcher, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Sato and Hikosaka, 2002</a>), we next asked whether a relationship existed between direction preference and the sign of activity change during the delay epoch, relative to baseline (see Materials and methods). We found that 188/296 neurons exhibited an increase in activity during this epoch, 91/296 exhibited a decrease, and 17/296 exhibited no change (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>), consistent with previous studies (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bryden et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Gulley et al., 2002</a>, <a href=\"#bib23\">1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Handel and Glimcher, 2000</a>, <a href=\"#bib25\">1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Sato and Hikosaka, 2002</a>). Within these groups, neurons exhibited a preference for ipsiversive, contraversive, or neither direction in roughly equal numbers (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>)."

First, we examined whether the difference in activity between ipsiversive and contraversive trials depended on whether the movement was stimulus guided or internally specified. Across our population, neurons tended to show a larger difference in firing rate preceding ipsiversive and contraversive movements in IS than in SG trials [<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>; ipsiversive-preferring neurons: p\u00a0=\u00a02.2 \u00d7 10<sup>\u221210</sup>, paired t-test; contraversive-preferring neurons: p\u00a0=\u00a04.0 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22124</sup>, paired t-test]. Second, we determined whether neurons were trial-type-dependent by comparing firing rates between SG and IS trials in which the selected movement was correct and in the preferred direction of the neuron; we then repeated this comparison for the antipreferred direction. For trials in the preferred direction, we found that the activity of approximately half of the direction-selective neurons was modulated by trial type (101/216; p&lt;0.05, unpaired t-test), with more neurons exhibiting higher activity in IS trials than SG trials (84/101 vs. 17/101; p\u00a0=\u00a02.6 \u00d7 10<sup>\u221211</sup>, X<sup>2</sup> test). Conversely, for trials in the antipreferred direction, we again found that the activity of approximately half of the direction-selective neurons was modulated by trial type (109/216; p&lt;0.05, unpaired t-test; 158/216 direction-selective neurons were modulated by trial type in at least one direction), but that more neurons exhibited higher activity in SG trials than IS trials (76/109 vs. 33/109; p\u00a0=\u00a03.8 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22125</sup>, X<sup>2</sup> test). Therefore, while we found that neurons were about equally likely to prefer upcoming ipsiversive and contraversive movements (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>), their activity depended, in a predictable manner, on trial type (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>)."

We therefore sought to identify these differences and determine their influence, in several ways. First, we reasoned that, if neural activity indeed reflects trial type, firing rate would systematically change during the IS block as the mouse increasingly based its movement choice on internal representations instead of the stimulus (recall that the transitions from SG to IS blocks were unsignaled). To test this idea, we calculated the correlation between the trial-by-trial firing rate during the delay epoch and the extent to which the mouse had learned that its movement choice should be internally specified, estimated with a reinforcement learning algorithm (see Materials and methods). We performed this analysis on the 158 neurons with firing rates that depended on both direction and trial type, separately for choices in the preferred and antipreferred direction. <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a> shows data from an example neuron displaying a significant correlation for trials in the preferred direction of the neuron (r = 0.65, p\u00a0=\u00a07.0 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22129</sup>), and no correlation for trials in the antipreferred direction (r = 0.066, p\u00a0=\u00a00.60). Overall, 77/158 neurons exhibited a significant correlation (p&lt;0.05) between firing rate and the number of consecutive correct trials for either direction [<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,C</a>; 35/77 for trials in the preferred direction (red circles), 29/77 for trials in the antipreferred direction (blue circles), and 13/77 for trials in both directions (purple circles)], with more positive correlations for trials in the preferred direction (p\u00a0=\u00a02.4 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22126</sup>,\u00a0X<sup>2</sup> test) and negative correlations for trials in the antipreferred direction (p\u00a0=\u00a05.9 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22126</sup>, X<sup>2</sup> test), as we would expect given the pattern of results shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>. These results support the idea that SNr activity reflects the degree to which movements are selected based on internal representations."

One difference between these trial types, by design, is that in IS trials the decision (to move left or right) is relatively easy, while in some SG trials this decision is more difficult (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). The difficulty of this decision \u2013 or an associated variable, such as uncertainty, or the estimated value of each movement direction \u2013 could, in principle, affect SNr activity. Were this the case, we would expect to observe a difference in activity between those SG trials requiring an easy discrimination (mixture ratios of 95/5, 80/20, 20/80, and 5/95) and those SG trials requiring a 'difficult' discrimination (mixture ratios of 60/40, 50/50, and 40/60), since easy trials resulted in a larger fraction of correct choices (p\u00a0=\u00a03.4 \u00d7 10<sup>\u201327</sup>, paired t-test; see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>), corresponding to a higher likelihood of reward. We therefore compared firing rate during the delay epoch between easy and difficult SG trials, separately for trials in the ipsiversive (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>) and contraversive (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>) direction, for the 216 direction-selective neurons (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, black bars). We found that the activity of some individual neurons depended on difficulty (or an associated variable) (ipsiversive direction: 39/216 neurons; contraversive direction: 31/216 neurons, p&lt;0.05, 1-way ANOVA across mixture ratios, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>), as would be predicted by the value-biasing view of BG function. However, there was little overlap (purple circles) between this small population of difficulty-dependent neurons (blue circles) and those neurons that we classified as trial-type-dependent [ipsiversive direction: 21/109 trial-type-dependent, and 18/107 non-trial-type-dependent, neurons exhibited difficulty dependence (these ratios did not differ: p\u00a0=\u00a00.32, X<sup>2</sup> test); contraversive direction: 16/101 trial-type-dependent, and 15/115 non-trial-type-dependent, neurons exhibited difficulty dependence (these ratios did not differ: p\u00a0=\u00a00.56, X<sup>2</sup> test); p&lt;0.05, 1-way ANOVA across mixture ratios]. These results suggest that differences in decision difficulty, uncertainty, and the value associated with the direction of movement do not account for trial-type dependence or the differences in activity between SG and IS trials shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>."

We therefore extended our regression analysis to examine how firing rate is modulated by these factors during overlapping 100 ms windows throughout the trial (see Materials and methods). In the example shown in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>, the activity of the neuron is modulated by previous choice (cyan line) \u2013 i.e., the confidence interval (shading) for this coefficient does not include 0 \u2013 even before the odor is delivered (odor valve open), and this influence persists until the movement is initiated (odor port exit). The current choice (black line) does not influence neural activity until ramping up just prior to movement initiation, but then continues to exert an influence for the remainder of the trial. The trial type (magenta line), meanwhile, exerts a moderate influence on the firing rate \u2013 specifically, activity is higher for IS trials \u2013 until just before movement initiation, after which this influence is diminished. Reaction time was a relatively poor predictor of firing rate (not shown, for clarity). To examine the dynamics of the weights of these factors across our population of neurons, we calculated the fraction of neurons with significant weights in each time window (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). The pattern of results was similar to that shown in the example neuron (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Before the odor is delivered, the firing rates of about half of the neurons are influenced by the previous choice. However, as the odor is sampled, the influence of the previous choice decreases and the influence of the current choice increases, with about two thirds of neurons exhibiting a significant weight for the current choice by the time the movement is initiated. Interestingly, trial type modulates the activity of about one third of neurons throughout the trial. The influence of reaction time is strongest during movement but has relatively little influence on the population (not shown). These results indicate that SNr activity dynamically reflects trial type and other task-relevant variables throughout the trial, as would be expected if the BG are differentially involved in mediating stimulus-guided and internally-specified movements."

While we designed the task such that correct movements were equally valuable across these conditions (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>), given imperfect (and stochastic) choice behavior, the experienced value was not necessarily identical. However, the dependence on trial type could not be accounted for by differences in the estimated value of each movement direction \u2013 or an associated variable, such as difficulty or uncertainty in selecting the movement \u2013 between the trial types (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). In some neurons this dependence could be explained, in part, by the choice on the previous trial (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>), which is informative of the rewarded direction in IS blocks. Over the course of the trial, while the influence on SNr activity of the previous choice decreased and that of the current choice increased, as might be expected given the demands of the task, the influence of trial type remained relatively constant (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>).

Movements selected based on a remembered stimulus can be thought of as internally specified, and in this sense our results (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>) are consistent with these findings and demonstrate that they generalize across species and movement types (saccades and full-body orienting). However, the rewarded direction in both memory- and visually-guided trials was indicated by the stimulus, which was not the case in our IS trials, in which we sometimes observed that direction preference emerged even before stimulus delivery (see example in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>). Further, the difference between direction preference in IS and SG trials during the delay epoch was correlated with the difference between preference in IS and SG trials during the epoch from odor port entry to odor valve open (r = 0.47, p\u00a0=\u00a04.8 \u00d7 10<sup>\u221218</sup>). These results demonstrate that, in IS trials, the direction of movement was initially selected independent of the stimulus, which contributes to the difference in activity during the delay epoch that we observe between SG and IS trials. In addition, while <a href=\"#bib28\">Hikosaka and Wurtz (1983a)</a> examined only neurons that exhibited a decrease in activity around the time of contraversive saccades, we examined increasing and decreasing neurons that prefer both ipsiversive and contraversive movement (<a href=\"#bib22\">Gulley et al., 2002</a>, <a href=\"#bib23\">1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Handel and Glimcher, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Sato and Hikosaka, 2002</a>) and found that all of these groups exhibited a difference in activity between stimulus-guided and internally-specified movements.

While the neural basis for this phenomenon is not well understood and remains an active area of study (<a href=\"#bib12\">Distler et al., 2016</a>), it has been suggested that visual cues engage (intact) sensorimotor pathways outside of the BG, such as the cerebellum (<a href=\"#bib19\">Glickstein and Stein, 1991</a>).

Left and right SNr neurons would exhibit a larger difference in activity in IS trials than in SG trials (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>, left). If ipsiversive-preferring SNr neurons primarily project to the ipsilateral SC (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hikosaka and Wurtz, 1983b</a>), then a downstream left SC neuron, the activity of which promotes rightward movement (<a href=\"#bib15\">Felsen and Mainen, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Horwitz and Newsome, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Stubblefield et al., 2013</a>) will receive less inhibition from the left SNr when the movement is internally specified, thereby facilitating rightward movements that are internally specified (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). Preceding the same movement, contraversive-preferring left and right SNr neurons would also exhibit a larger difference in activity in IS trials than in SG trials (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>, right). If contraversive-preferring SNr neurons comprise the 'crossed'\u00a0projection to the contralateral SC (<a href=\"#bib35\">Jiang et al., 2003</a>), then a downstream right SC neuron would receive more inhibition from the left SNr when the movement is internally specified, again facilitating the rightward movement. However, we observed that slightly more SNr neurons prefer contraversive than ipsiversive movement (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>) but many fewer SNr neurons project to the contralateral than ipsilateral SC, particularly in rodents (<a href=\"#bib5\">Beckstead et al., 1981</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Deniau et al., 1977</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Gerfen et al., 1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Jayaraman et al., 1977</a>), and contraversive-preferring SNr neurons may preferentially project to non-tectal targets. Thus, SNr activity may be consistent with the facilitation of internally-specified contraversive movements. Our results therefore extend the model underlying the value-biasing view of BG function (<a href=\"#bib27\">Hikosaka et al., 2006</a>) by suggesting that the influence of the SNr on downstream motor regions is modulated by internal representations in addition to value."

We suggest that this dependence may reflect a facilitation for internally-specified movements, consistent with the view that, although movements are often made in response to sensory stimuli, internal representations of priors play a critical role in guiding motor output (<a href=\"#bib56\">Wolpert and Landy, 2012</a>). Our results are sufficiently consistent with results in primate SNr (<a href=\"#bib26\">Handel and Glimcher, 2000</a>, <a href=\"#bib25\">1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Hikosaka and Wurtz, 1983a</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Liu and Basso, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Sato and Hikosaka, 2002</a>) that they can inform the interpretation of previous studies (e.g., our proposed extensions of the model explaining the value-biasing role of the BG described above), while also offering novel insight into BG function. Future studies can utilize the task established here, in the experimentally-advantageous awake-behaving mouse model (<a href=\"#bib8\">Carandini and Churchland, 2013</a>), to examine whether the difference in SNr activity preceding internally-specified and stimulus-guided movements is established by local processing or via striatal inputs (<a href=\"#bib27\">Hikosaka et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Lauwereyns et al., 2002</a>) and to further elucidate how the BG control goal-directed movements."

(2013)</a>, and were then trained to perform 'internally-specified' (IS) trials. Briefly, each mouse was water-restricted and trained to interact with three ports (center: odor port; sides: reward ports) along one wall of a behavioral chamber (Island Motion). In each trial, the mouse entered the odor port, triggering the delivery of an odor; waited 488 \u00b1 104 ms (mean \u00b1 SD) for a go signal (auditory tone); exited the odor port; and entered one of the reward ports (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Premature exit from the odor port resulted in the unavailability of reward on that trial. Odors were comprised of binary mixtures of (+)-carvone and (-)-carvone, commonly perceived as caraway and spearmint, respectively; an enantiomeric odor pair was selected to control for differences in molecular structure of odorant stimuli. In each SG trial, one of seven odor mixtures was presented via an olfactometer (Island Motion): volume (+)-carvone/(-)-carvone = 95/5, 80/20, 60/40, 50/50, 40/60, 20/80, or 5/95. Mixtures in which (+)-carvone &gt; (-)-carvone indicated reward availability only at the right port and mixtures in which (-)-carvone &gt; (+)-carvone indicated reward availability only at the left port [we therefore refer to (-)-carvone as the 'left odor' (e.g., <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>) for simplicity]. In trials in which (+)-carvone = (-)-carvone, the probability of reward at the left and right ports, independently, was 0.5. Reward, consisting of 4\u2009\u03bcl of water, was delivered by transiently opening a calibrated water valve 10\u2013100 ms after reward port entry. Odor and water delivery were controlled, and port entries and exits were recorded, using custom software (available at <a href=\"https://github.com/felsenlab\">https://github.com/felsenlab</a>; adapted from C. D. Brody) written in MATLAB (MathWorks)."

In every IS trial the 50/50 mixture was presented, and reward was available only at one side throughout the block. Mice were first introduced to interleaved blocks, each of which required 25 correct trials to advance to the next block. Once they performed ~70% of trials in the session correctly, the number of correct trials required per block was increased to 50. Mice performed 5 blocks (SG, IS, SG, IS, SG) per session (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>); the side associated with reward switched between each IS block.

A second small craniotomy was performed in order to place the ground wire in direct contact with the brain. After the acrylic hardened, a topical triple antibiotic ointment (Major) mixed with 2% lidocaine hydrochloride jelly (Akorn) was applied to the scalp, the mouse was removed from the stereotaxic device, the isoflurane was turned off, and oxygen alone was delivered to the animal to gradually alleviate anesthetic state. Mice were administered sterile isotonic saline (0.9%) for rehydration and an analgesic (Ketofen; 5 mg/kg) for pain management.

Identification of single units through examination of spikes in high-dimensional feature space allowed us to refine the delimitation of identified clusters by examining all possible two-dimensional combinations of selected spike features. We used standard spike features for single unit extraction: peak amplitude, energy (square root of the sum of squares of each point in the waveform, divided by the number of samples in the waveform), and the first principal component normalized by energy. Spike features were derived separately for individual leads. To assess the quality of identified clusters we calculated two standard quantitative metrics: L-ratio and isolation distance (<a href=\"#bib47\">Schmitzer-Torbert et al., 2005</a>). Clusters with an L-ratio of less than 0.70 and isolation distance greater than 6.5 were deemed single units, which resulted in the exclusion of 12% of the identified clusters. Although units were clustered without knowledge of interspike interval, only clusters with few interspike intervals less than 1 ms were considered for further examination. Furthermore, we excluded the possibility of including data from the same neuron twice by ensuring that both the waveforms and response properties sufficiently changed across sessions. If they did not, we conservatively assumed that we were recording from the same neuron, and only included data from one session."

We also performed this same regression analysis with two additional terms, for value [estimated in IS trials with the reinforcement learning model (see above) and in SG trials as the average performance by mixture ratio within the block (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>)], and the interaction between value and trial type. We found that, while the firing rate of some neurons was influenced by these additional factors, as expected given the value-biasing view of BG function (<a href=\"#bib27\">Hikosaka et al., 2006</a>), including them \u2013 or including the log of the value \u2013 did not affect the overall results shown in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>. To examine how firing rate throughout the trial depended on these factors (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B,C</a>), we repeated the above analysis with respect to firing rate in overlapping 100 ms bins, shifted by 10 ms, aligned to three behavioral events: odor valve open, odor port exit and reward port entry."

However, the study does not address that, it rather addresses the comparison between similarly valued stimulus-driven versus internally-guided movements (in other formulations feedforward versus feedback driven, sensorimotor versus motor sensory). Therefore, the study does not address that expected value does not influence the activity of SNr during the execution of similar internally-guided movements. It does compare the activity of similarly valued movements, internally-guided are more represented than stimulus-driven. The study is not contrary to the value-biasing view of basal ganglia function, it just shows that basal ganglia cares more about self-paced that stimulus-driven movements (even for the same value). Therefore, the Abstract; Introduction, Discussion, and flow should focus on the difference between stimulus-driven versus internally-guided movements."

It has been known that patients with basal ganglia dysfunction may have difficulty in initiating movements internally. For example, patients with Parkinson's disease often have difficulty in initiating movements (e.g., walking) if there is no sensory guidance (Glickstein & Stein, Trends Neurosci 1991) and patients with bilateral pallidal lesions may not initiate goal-directed behavior spontaneously (Laplane et al., J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry 1984). However, the underlying mechanism is still unclear. In this sense, this study is important."

The contralateral SNr-SC connection is very few in rats (Beckstead et al., J Neurosci 1981), which may be true in mice. The authors found that contraversive SNr neurons (thus, projecting to the contralateral SC) are slightly more common than ipsiversive SNr neurons (thus, projecting to the ipsilateral SC).

If the animal decides to choose Rightward movement, the neuron in Right SNr (i.e., Ipsi) is more active than the neuron in Left SNr (i.e., Contra). This would lead to the bias toward Rightward movement (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). Importantly, the choice bias is stronger in IS than SG (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>).

This indicates that both groups of neurons enhanced their choice signals, but in different ways: 1) enhancing the dominant signal, and 2) suppressing the non-dominant signal. This reminds me of a basic mechanism of motor control: To change the orientation of a joint, the agonist muscle contracts or the antagonist muscle relaxes, or both contract (or relax) in different amounts. These mechanisms may be useful in different contexts. In this sense, the authors' data may suggest that different groups of SNr neurons contribute to such different mechanisms of joint orientation, in this case, head or eye orientation."

However, this comment also raises distinct points, which we address here. We first clarify two points: First, our primary focus is on the delay epoch (from odor valve open to odor port exit; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), which precedes the movement, rather than epochs during the movement itself. Second, we defined reaction time as the time from go signal to reward port entry. (While it would also be sensible to define reaction time as the time from go signal to odor port exit, we find that exiting the odor port and moving to the reward port are more naturally considered to be part of the same process, so we consider them together.) Since reaction time was generally longer in stimulus-guided (SG) than IS trials (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>), the end of the movement (defined as reward port entry) generally occurred later in SG than IS trials. However, given that our delay epoch ended at the beginning of the movement (odor port exit), and not at the end of the movement, it has the same relationship with movement in both SG and IS trials: it is the period of time immediately preceding movement. We note that this would not be true of other, otherwise reasonable, definitions of the \u201cdelay epoch,\u201d e.g., from odor valve open to the go signal; in fact, we have analyzed this epoch as well and found while preparing this resubmission that we had originally reported some results from it. We now report only results from the epoch as defined in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, resulting in some slightly different numbers in the resubmission, none of which change any of our overall results."

Instead, perhaps we should consider defining our epoch as having a fixed length but starting relative to when the direction of movement can first be selected; for example, the epoch could begin with odor port entry for IS trials and odor valve open for SG trials (note that, if we simply prepend the period between odor port entry and odor valve open to the delay epoch for IS trials only, we would see an even larger difference between IS and SG trials than we show in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). We have considered this possibility (among several others), but it would be problematic because many neurons exhibit activity late in our current delay epoch in IS trials, which is likely related to movement selection but would be lost if the epoch ended earlier. Ultimately, we do not believe that there exists a better definition of the relevant epoch to our study than our delay epoch: We are most interested in the activity immediately preceding movement that it captures, because it is at this time that, via modulation of activity in downstream structures, specific movements are facilitated or inhibited. We have clarified this reasoning in the Results section when we first introduce the delay epoch (subsection \u201cSNr activity differs for stimulus-guided and internally-specified movements\u201d, first paragraph), and discuss the relationship between activity preceding stimulus delivery and activity during the delay epoch in the Discussion (second paragraph; also see response to Comment #14)."

In the revised manuscript, we note this correlation analysis and provide the results (Discussion, second paragraph), and we clarify that the value-biasing view also hypothesizes that SNr activity is modulated by reward prior to stimulus presentation (Introduction, first paragraph and Discussion, third paragraph)."

While we designed the task such that correctly performed trials were equally rewarded, and therefore valuable (Abstract, Introduction, last paragraph), we could not entirely predict and/or control for the animals\u2019 choice behavior, and therefore the value of different trial types that was actually experienced is not necessarily identical. We now clarify this point in the revised manuscript (Discussion, first paragraph). Indeed, when we compared the average value of IS and SG trials (estimated in each IS trial with the reinforcement learning model and in each SG trials using the block-by-block psychometric functions, as suggested in Comment #25) within each mouse, we found that, for 3 mice IS trials were slightly more likely to be rewarded and for 1 mouse SG trials were slightly more likely to be rewarded (although the timescale over which value for each mixture ratio should best be estimated \u2013 by trial, block, session, or lifetime \u2013 is an open \u2013 and interesting \u2013 question). However, in Revised <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> we directly examined whether the difference we observed between IS and SG trials in Revised <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a> could be due to a dependence on the value of the movement. Specifically, as suggested by the reviewer (see response to Comment #24), we performed an ANOVA to examine whether activity depended on mixture ratio. Given that mice performed at different levels of accuracy on different mixture ratios (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>), and we used accuracy as a proxy for movement value in the RL model, this analysis addresses whether activity is influenced by value. We found that, while the activity of some neurons was influenced by value, this dependence did not account for the observed difference between IS and SG trials (Revised <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>;subsection \u201cModulation of SNr activity by task-relevant variables\u201d, first paragraph)."

Results were similar when we used value itself as a factor instead. These results are as we might expect, given the known dependence of movement-related SNr activity on the value of the movement (Bryden et al., 2011; Sato and Hikosaka, 2002).

It would be interesting to record from these regions (among several others!) in our task. We speculate that dorsal striatum would be more strongly engaged by our IS trials, in which action values need to be re-learned based on choice and reward history, than our SG trials (although it would continue to represent action values during SG trials). Perhaps lateral prefrontal cortex would be more strongly engaged by our SG than IS trials, since selected movements in random trials (which are somewhat analogous to our SG trials) were represented earlier in lateral prefrontal cortex than dorsal striatum."

By looking at these two points in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>, we can guess if the neuron can contribute to the choice; the slope between the two data points indicates the ratio of the directional bias (IS-bias/SG-bias).

How many SNr neurons were capable of contributing to the choice? Would the data in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> answer the question? I doubt it. For example, there are neurons that showed significant correlations with both preferred and anti-preferred directions. Some of them had the same polarities; they would increase (or decrease) their activity during both Ipsi and Contra IS blocks. Such neurons are probably not capable of contributing to the correct choice.</i> "

We entirely agree that the difference in firing rate between ipsiversive and contraversive trials is critical. In the revised manuscript we now display the data as recommended by the reviewer, in two separate panels depending on the direction preference of the neuron (calculated during SG and IS trials combined; see response to Comment #6; Revised <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>; subsection \u201cSNr activity differs for stimulus-guided and internally-specified movements\u201d, second paragraph). This way, it is clear that for ipsiversive-preferring neurons, (activity in ipsiversive trials \u2013 activity in contraversive trials) is greater for internally-specified (IS) than stimulus-guided (SG) trials, and for contraversive-preferring neurons, (activity in contraversive trials \u2013 activity in ipsiversive trials) is also greater for IS than SG trials. In other words, the difference in firing rate between trials in the preferred and antipreferred directions tends to be higher for IS trials than SG trials. We believe that this format most clearly conveys the difference in firing rate between ipsiversive and contraversive trials across our population of neurons. (When ipsiversive- and contraversive- preferring neurons are combined in one panel, as was the case in <a href=\"#fig8\">Author response image 1</a> of the previous submission, the main point is less clear.) For consistency with Revised <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>, we have also separated ipsiversive- and contraversive-preferring neurons in Revised <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>."

For example, I find two dominant groups of neurons in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B: 1</a>) neurons showing positive correlations with their preferred directions, and 2) neurons showing negative correlations with their anti-preferred directions. This indicates that both groups of neurons enhanced their choice signals, but in different ways: 1) enhancing the dominant signal, and 2) suppressing the non-dominant signal. This reminds me of a basic mechanism of motor control: To change the orientation of a joint, the agonist muscle contracts or the antagonist muscle relaxes, or both contract (or relax) in different amounts. These mechanisms may be useful in different contexts. In this sense, the authors' data may suggest that different groups of SNr neurons contribute to such different mechanisms of joint orientation, in this case, head or eye orientation.</i> "

While this alternative definition is not unreasonable, we believe that it is important for the delay epoch to end at the beginning of movement initiation (i.e., odor port exit), so that it has the same temporal relationship with movement across SG and IS trials (see response to Comment #2 on our original submission for further details). In the first revision, we made sure to report only results from the epoch as defined in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, resulting in some slightly different values than in the original submission, none of which changed any of our overall results.
