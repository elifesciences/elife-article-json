Here, we report miR-139-5p as another new p53 microRNA target. p53 induced the transcription of miR-139-5p, which in turn suppressed the protein levels of phosphodiesterase 4D (PDE4D), an oncogenic protein involved in multiple tumor promoting processes. Knockdown of p53 reversed these effects. Also, overexpression of miR-139-5p decreased PDE4D levels and increased cellular cAMP levels, leading to BIM-mediated cell growth arrest. Furthermore, our analysis of human colorectal tumor specimens revealed significant inverse correlation between the expression of miR-139-5p and that of PDE4D. Finally, overexpression of miR-139-5p suppressed the growth of xenograft tumors, accompanied by decrease in PDE4D and increase in BIM. These results demonstrate that p53 inactivates oncogenic PDE4D by inducing the expression of miR-139-5p."

Here, we report miR-139-5p as another new p53 microRNA target. p53 induced the transcription of miR-139-5p, which in turn suppressed the protein levels of phosphodiesterase 4D (PDE4D), an oncogenic protein involved in multiple tumor promoting processes. Knockdown of p53 reversed these effects. Also, overexpression of miR-139-5p decreased PDE4D levels and increased cellular cAMP levels, leading to BIM-mediated cell growth arrest. Furthermore, our analysis of human colorectal tumor specimens revealed significant inverse correlation between the expression of miR-139-5p and that of PDE4D. Finally, overexpression of miR-139-5p suppressed the growth of xenograft tumors, accompanied by decrease in PDE4D and increase in BIM. These results demonstrate that p53 inactivates oncogenic PDE4D by inducing the expression of miR-139-5p."

Colon tumors produce much lower levels of this microRNA than normal tissues, while the cancer cells with a higher level of miR-139-5p grow slower than do the cancer cells with less miR-139-5p. Further experiments showed that this is because miR-139-5p can suppress the production of a protein called PDE4D, which is often highly expressed in human cancers. The suppression of PDE4D by this microRNA results in an increase in the levels of a protein that can cause cancer cells to die."

Abnormal regulation of miRNAs is associated with human cancer development and staging (<a href=\"#bib20\">Lu et al., 2005</a>). Over the past decade, increasing attention has been drawn to the role of miRNAs in p53 signaling network, and a number of miRNAs have been identified as p53 target genes (<a href=\"#bib17\">Liao et al., 2014a</a>). These miRNAs are involved in multiple biological processes, including cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, glycolysis and so on. Also, they often connect p53 with other signaling pathways (<a href=\"#bib4\">Christoffersen et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Sachdeva et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Liang et al., 2013</a>). Although miRNAs have been appreciated as important mediators of p53\u2019s tumor suppression functions, a lot still remain unexplored to better understand the fine-tuning of p53 signaling and crosstalk with other pathways by these RNAs. In this study, we identified miR-139-5p as a novel p53 target gene and demonstrated a new pathway connecting p53 and miR-139-5p with an oncogenic protein PDE4D as a new target of this miRNA and its downstream cAMP signaling."

Both cells were treated with 4\u2009\u03bcM Inauhzin-C (INZ-C), which is a p53 activating compound discovered in our lab (<a href=\"#bib37\">Zhang et al., 2012</a>). After confirmation of p53 and its targets induction through Western blot (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), the total RNA was extracted and sent to ArrayStar for miRNA-sequencing analysis. The results revealed that in addition to known p53 target microRNAs, such as miR-34a, miR-1246 and miR-143 (<a href=\"#bib17\">Liao et al., 2014a</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Suzuki et al., 2009</a>), miR-139 was also significantly induced in HCT116 p53<sup>+/+</sup>, but not HCT116 p53<sup>-/-</sup>, cells, suggesting miR-139 as a potential p53 target (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). We independently confirmed this observation by detecting miR-139-5p expression after treating HCT116 p53<sup>+/+</sup>/HCT116 p53<sup>-/-</sup> and H460 (WT p53)/H1299 (p53 null) cells with DMSO or 4\u2009\u03bcM INZ-C. miR-139-5p was significantly induced only in p53 positive, but not in p53 null, cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). In contrast, p53 knockdown decreased miR-139-5p expression by more than 50% in H460 and U2OS cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>).

In both cell lines, the binding of p53 with the p53RE was dramatically increased upon Doxorubicin treatment as compared to non-treatment control, indicated by p53RE sequence pulled down with p53 specific antibody DO-1, but not non-specific immunoglobulin G (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>).

Notably, the PDE4D variants with smaller molecular weight have been reported to possess stronger oncogenic activities due to the lack of functional inhibitory domains as compared to the longer forms (<a href=\"#bib19\">Lin et al., 2013</a>). Nevertheless, miR-139-5p transfection and doxorubicin treatment led to similar expression inhibition of both the long and the short variants of PDE4D, indicating that this newly identified pathway has broader inhibition on PDE4D. In contrast, knocking down p53 elevated PDE4D expression in these two cell lines (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>, right panel). We then assessed the effect of miR-139-5p on PDE4D in PC-3, a p53 null cell line, and found similar reduction of PDE4D by miR-139-5p mimic (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). To further validate the regulatory role of p53 on PDE4D, we also treated HCT116 p53+/+ and HCT116 p53-/- cells with 10\u2009\u03bcM Nutlin-3 (Nut), which disrupts MDM2-p53 interaction and therefore activates p53 (<a href=\"#bib33\">Vassilev et al., 2004</a>), and 5 nM Actinomycin D (ActD), which causes ribosomal stress-mediated p53 activation (<a href=\"#bib9\">Iapalucci-Espinoza and Franze-Fern\u00e1ndez, 1979</a>), and found PDE4D was reduced by both of these two drugs only in p53 positive, but not p53 negative, cells (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). These results suggest that this suppression of PDE4D is p53 dependent in response to various stresses."

As expected, miR-139-5p expressing tumors grew significantly slowly as compared to control tumors starting at day 16 after inoculation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). The difference of miR-139-5p expression in these two groups of tumors was comparable to that observed in human specimens (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a> vs <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Immunohistochemistry analysis revealed that in the miR-139-5p overexpressing tumors, PDE4D expression was markedly repressed, while tumor cell proliferation was significantly inhibited as reflected by Ki67 staining (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Consistent with our in vitro observation, BIM expression was also elevated in miR-139-5p tumors (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). These findings suggest that the tumor suppressor role of miR-139-5p is likely attributed to its regulation of the PDE4D/BIM pathway."

                                "text": "In summary, this study for the first time demonstrates that p53 can induce the expression of miR-139-5p (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>), which in turn suppresses the expression of an oncogenic protein PDE4D (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>) and leads to cAMP/BIM-mediated cell growth arrest (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Significantly, miR-139-5p expression is negatively correlated with PDE4D in human colorectal tumor and normal tissues, and overexpression of miR-139-5p is associated with slower tumor growth in the xenograft model, which is accompanied with PDE4D suppression, BIM induction and cell proliferation inhibition (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). As a potential tumor suppressor, miR-139 was previously shown to be downregulated in human hepatocellular carcinoma and colorectal cancer with characterized targets including Rho-kinase 2, IGF-IR and RAP1B (<a href=\"#bib7\">Guo et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Shen et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Wong et al., 2011</a>). Here, we identified PDE4D, an oncogenic protein that is upregulated in various human cancers (<a href=\"#bib19\">Lin et al., 2013</a>), as another novel target of this miRNA. Inhibition or depletion of PDE4D significantly induces apoptosis and inhibits proliferation of cancer cells (<a href=\"#bib19\">Lin et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Ogawa et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Rahrmann et al., 2009</a>). Notably, the oncogenic property of PDE4D involves the cAMP/BIM pathway (<a href=\"#bib19\">Lin et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Zambon et al., 2011</a>). cAMP is an important secondary messenger mediating diverse cellular processes with protein kinase A as its main effector (<a href=\"#bib32\">Task\u00e9n and Aandahl, 2004</a>). In particular, lower cAMP levels favor cancer cell survival and proliferation, which can be reversed by inhibition of PDE4D, the cAMP specific phopsphodiesterase (<a href=\"#bib6\">Goldhoff et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Lin et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Murata et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Ogawa et al., 2002</a>). The tumor suppressor role of p53 has been extensively documented over the last two decades, and is highly attributable to its regulation of target genes involved in cell cycle arrest, apoptosis and senescence (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bieging et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Levine, 2011</a>). More recent discoveries revealed that p53 is also a critical mediator of metabolic pathways that are important for tumor survival (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bieging et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Jiang et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Wang and Gu, 2014</a>). Based on our findings, we propose a p53-miR-139-5p-PDE4D-cAMP-BIM pathway as a novel pathway that can mediate p53\u2019s tumor suppression function to modulate cellular cAMP levels by inhibiting PDE4D expression via miR-139-5p, and deregulation of this pathway would be highly associated with tumorigenesis (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>)."

Their data show quite convincingly that this is a real p53 target since it is induced by Doxorubicin and INZ-C in a p53-dependent manner, that the miR-139-5p gene contains a p53 binding site to which Dox-induced p53 binds (by ChIP analysis) and that this sequence can serve as a p53 response element in a luciferase reporter assay. The authors go further and use computational analysis to identify a target of miR-139-5p as cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase4D (PDE4D) and in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> show that a mimic of miR-139-5p leads reduces expression of PDE4D while and inhibitor of miR-139-5p increased the levels of PDE4D. PDE4D is known to increase conversion of cAMP to AMP and in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> the authors show increased levels of cAMP upon introduction of the miR-139-5p mimic, and corresponding increased levels of Bim, shown previously to be downstream of cAMP mediated cell death.

However, we were able to detect changes in PDE4D protein at comparable levels among cells treated with 4\u03bcM INZ-C (<a href=\"#fig1\">Image 1D</a>), 0.5 \u03bcM Doxorubicin (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>), or transfected with pSIF-miR-139-5p (<a href=\"#fig6\">Author response image 1E</a>) or miR-139-5p mimic (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Consistently, 0.5 \u03bcM Doxorubicin treatment and miR-139-5p mimic transfection also led to similar induction of cAMP (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A and B</a>). These observations suggest that although the relative levels of miR-139-5p could differ significantly when cells were treated with different means, several folds of increase achieved by p53 induction is sufficient to suppress PDE4D protein expression and subsequently cAMP elevation, while the excess amount of miR-139-5p mimic does not cause further impact."

In <a href=\"#fig7\">Author response image 2</a> in the first rebuttal letter, we showed that BIM knockdown rescued H460 cell inhibition by Doxorubicin from 58% to 42% (siBIM-1) and 35% (siBIM-2) at 48 h, and from 67% to 47% (siBIM-1) and 37% (siBIM-2) at 72 h after treatment, respectively, which we believe is quite evident. To be consistent with the data in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a> as the reviewer suggested, we also performed cell proliferation assay in A549 cells to test the rescue effect of BIM knockdown in response to Nutlin-3 treatment. As shown in <a href=\"#fig4s5\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 5</a>, the inhibitory effect of Nutlin-3 on cell proliferation was significantly reversed by BIM siRNA. Although the rescue effect was not 100%, we believe it is reasonably anticipated, because as one of hundreds of target genes of p53, miR-139 also has multiple target genes other than PDE4D/cAMP/BIM pathway (Guo, Hu et al., 2012, Shen, Liang et al., 2012, Wong, Wong et al., 2011). Therefore, we propose that induction of miR-139-5p mediated PDE4D/cAMP/BIM pathway contributes to p53 tumor suppressor function."

Similarly, they need to show that the increase in BIM is p53 dependent\". Is not very convincing. First, in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>. Doxorubicin is not really appropriate to use as a demonstration of p53-specific response because this drug has other p53-independent effects on cells, so Nutlin would be a better control. Second, in <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a> it is not appropriate to compare two cell lung cancer lines that differ in p53 status as a way to prove that BIM is induced in a p53-specific manner. Also the extent of induction is really very modest in the H460 cells. Either use the HCT116 pair of cells or knockdown p53 in the H460 cells.</i>"

It is not clear how BIM would induce a cell cycle effect and the authors have not clearly stated which outcome they think is occurring in response to miR-139-5p regulation by p53.
