In plants, the juvenile to adult transition (vegetative phase change) is initiated by a decrease in miR156. In <i>Arabidopsis</i>, we found that exogenous sugar decreased the abundance of miR156, whereas reduced photosynthesis increased the level of this miRNA. This effect was correlated with a change in the timing of vegetative phase change, and was primarily attributable to a change in the expression of two genes, <i>MIR156A</i> and <i>MIR156C</i>, which were found to play dominant roles in this transition. The glucose-induced repression of miR156 was dependent on the signaling activity of HEXOKINASE1. We also show that the defoliation-induced increase in miR156 levels can be suppressed by exogenous glucose. These results provide a molecular link between nutrient availability and developmental timing in plants, and suggest that sugar is a component of the leaf signal that mediates vegetative phase change."

Now, based on experiments with the plant <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, Yang et al. and, independently, Yu et al. have provided fresh insights into the role of sugar in \u2018vegetative phase change'\u2014the transition from the juvenile form of a plant to the adult plant."

Removing leaves also leads to upregulation of both genes, and delays the juvenile to adult transition. Given that this effect can be partially reversed by providing the plant with sugar, it is likely that sugar produced in the leaves\u2014or one of its metabolites\u2014is the signal that triggers the juvenile to adult transition through the reduction of miR156 levels."

In addition, they showed that a gene called <i>HXK1</i>, which encodes a glucose signaling protein, helps to keep plants in the juvenile form under conditions of low sugar availability. HXK1 also contributes to the glucose-induced decrease in miR156 levels and does so, at least in part, by regulating the transcription of <i>MIR156A</i> and <i>MIR156C</i> genes into messenger mRNA. HXK1 is not solely responsible for the juvenile to adult transition, however, because plants that lack this protein are only slightly precocious in their transition to the adult form."

The correct timing of these developmental events is critical for survival and reproduction, and is regulated by complex interactions between endogenous and environmental factors, such as nutrition, temperature, or photoperiod (<a href=\"#bib11\">Bernier, 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Rougvie, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Amasino, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Tolson and Chappell, 2012</a>). In plants, the maturation of the shoot can be divided into three phases: a juvenile vegetative phase, an adult vegetative phase, and a reproductive phase (<a href=\"#bib40\">Poethig, 1990</a>). The juvenile to adult transition (vegetative phase change) is regulated by miR156 (<a href=\"#bib56\">Wu and Poethig, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Chuck et al., 2007</a>), a microRNA that is conserved throughout the plant kingdom (<a href=\"#bib10\">Axtell and Bowman, 2008</a>). miR156 is highly expressed in the juvenile phase and decreases dramatically during vegetative phase change. This decrease produces an increase in the expression of its direct targets, SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE (SBP/SPL) transcription factors (<a href=\"#bib46\">Schwab et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Wu et al., 2009</a>), which go on to mediate the morphological and physiological changes associated with this transition. The basis for the decrease in miR156 expression is unknown."

Goebel termed this phenomenon \u2018heteroblasty\u2019, and recognized that shoot development could be divided into more-or-less discrete stages on the basis of this trait (<a href=\"#bib22\">Goebel, 1889</a>, <a href=\"#bib23\">1900</a>). Goebel believed that the transition between juvenile and adult leaf types\u2014the hallmark of vegetative phase change\u2014is the result of a change in the nutritional status of the shoot (<a href=\"#bib24\">Goebel, 1908</a>). According to this hypothesis, leaves produced early in shoot development are typically small and morphologically simple because leaf development is arrested by low endogenous nutrient levels, and leaves become more complex as the size and metabolic capacity of the plant increases. Subsequent studies in both ferns (<a href=\"#bib1\">Allsopp, 1953a</a>, <a href=\"#bib2\">1953b</a>, <a href=\"#bib4\">1955</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Wetmore, 1953</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Steeves and Sussex, 1957</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Sussex and Clutter, 1960</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Gottlieb and Steeves, 1965</a>) and flowering plants (<a href=\"#bib35\">Njoku, 1956</a>, <a href=\"#bib36\">1971</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">R\u00f6bbelen, 1957</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Feldman and Cutter, 1970</a>) have shown that exogenous sugar promotes the production of larger and more complex leaves, whereas growing plants or isolated leaf primordia in nutrient-deprived conditions or low light promotes the production of simple leaves. However, the implications of these results for the regulation of vegetative phase change remain controversial. In particular, it is still unclear if the leaf types produced by modifying carbohydrate levels correspond to juvenile and adult leaves. For example, <a href=\"#bib28\">Jones (1995)</a> reported that the developmental anatomy of <i>Cucurbita argyrosperma</i> leaves produced under low light conditions is not identical to that of juvenile leaves. Defining the molecular basis for the effect of sugar on shoot morphogenesis is therefore an important problem in plant development."

The function of HEXOKINASE1 (HXK1) in sugar signaling has been particularly well characterized (<a href=\"#bib34\">Moore et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Rolland et al., 2006</a>). HXK1 has dual roles in glucose homeostasis. Its enzymatic function is to catalyze the first step in glycolysis, the transformation of glucose into glucose-6-phosphate. It also functions as a sugar sensor, and can regulate gene transcription in response to changes in glucose concentration. This latter function was identified when it was discovered that glucose phosphorylation\u2014which is a major output of the catalytic function of HXK1\u2014was not correlated with the quantitative indicators of glucose signaling such as chlorophyll production and photosynthetic gene expression (<a href=\"#bib34\">Moore et al., 2003</a>). Mutated forms of HXK1 that lack glucose phosphorylation capacity are nevertheless capable of mediating glucose signaling, demonstrating that the signaling function of HXK1 is independent of its enzymatic activity. This signaling function is executed by an HXK1-containing nuclear complex, which is thought to bind to the promoters of various genes in the presence of high levels of glucose to control their transcription (<a href=\"#bib16\">Cho et al., 2006</a>)."

Given that miR156 regulates all aspects of vegetative phase change, we reasoned that factors that affect its expression are likely to play an important role in this process. We show that glucose promotes vegetative phase change by repressing the accumulation of miR156 and that this effect can be attributed to a decrease in the expression of two of the eight <i>MIR156</i> genes in <i>Arabidopsis</i>. HXK1 is required for this effect, and acts through its signaling function to promote the expression of miR156 under conditions of low sugar availability. Finally, the effect of glucose on miR156 expression in defoliated seedlings supports the hypothesis that glucose, or a derivative of this sugar, is a component of the leaf signal that promotes vegetative phase change. These results provide a potential molecular mechanism for the temporal decrease in miR156 during vegetative phase change, linking nutrient levels to shoot maturation in plants."

In the original description of heteroblasty in <i>Arabidopsis</i>, <a href=\"#bib41\">R\u00f6bbelen (1957)</a> reported that several chlorophyll-deficient mutations increased the number of juvenile leaves, and concluded from this observation that the production of adult leaves was promoted by the products of photosynthesis. We reinvestigated this observation by characterizing the phenotype of <i>chlorina1-4</i> (<i>ch1-4</i>), a mutation in chlorophyll <i>a</i> oxygenase (AtCAO, At1g44446) that blocks the biosynthesis of chlorophyll b (<a href=\"#bib20\">Espineda et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Oster et al., 2000</a>). <i>ch1-4</i> plants were yellow-green, grew more slowly than normal, and also underwent vegetative phase change significantly later than wild-type plants; under short day (SD) conditions, abaxial trichome production was delayed by five leaves and mutant leaves were rounder and had a smoother margin than the leaves of wild-type plants (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>). <i>ch1-4</i> plants did not display a delay in abaxial trichome production under long days (LD), although their leaves were still rounder than normal. To determine if the delayed phase change phenotype of <i>ch1-4</i> depends on miR156, we crossed a miR156 target site mimic construct, <i>35S::MIM156</i>, into <i>ch1-4</i> to block miR156 activity (<a href=\"#bib55\">Wu et al., 2009</a>)<i>.</i> Like <i>ch1-4</i>, plants homozygous for <i>ch1-4</i> and <i>35S::MIM156</i> were yellow-green and small in size; however, in contrast to <i>ch1-4</i>, their leaves were elongated and serrated and they produced abaxial trichomes on the first rosette leaf (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a>).

Northern blots showed that miR156 was initially more abundant and declined more slowly in <i>ch1-4</i> than in wild-type plants: miR156 expression declined to a basal level between 12 and 16 days after planting (DAP) in wild-type plants, and between 16 and 20 days DAP in <i>ch1-4</i> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Although the <i>ch1-4</i> mutants grew more slowly than Col, the difference in miR156 accumulation is unlikely to be a consequence of delayed development because <i>ch1-4</i> mutants at 16 DAP had the same number of leaves as wild-type plants at 12 DAP, but still had more miR156 than 12-day-old wild-type plants (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,D</a>). Consistent with the elevated expression of miR156, the transcript levels of several direct targets of miR156 (<i>SPL3</i>, <i>SPL9</i>, <i>SPL13</i>) were reduced in <i>ch1-4</i> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). This effect was also reflected in the abundance of the SPL3 and SPL9 proteins, as revealed by GUS translational fusion constructs: the expression of both <i>pSPL3::GUS-SPL3</i> and <i>pSPL9::SPL9-GUS</i> was significantly lower in <i>ch1-4</i> than in wild-type plants at comparable stages of morphological development (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). This effect is not attributable to an effect of <i>ch1-4</i> on the transcription of these genes because there was no significant difference in the expression of the miR156-resistant versions of these reporters in wild-type and mutant plants (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). The spatial expression pattern of the miR156-sensitive version of these reporters is exemplified by <i>pSPL3::GUS-SPL3</i>, which is expressed at a very low level in cotyledons and in the first two leaves, and at a much higher level starting with leaf 3; the miR156-resistant version of this reporter, <i>pSPL3::GUS-rSPL3</i>, was expressed uniformly, and at a very high level, throughout shoot development, demonstrating that the expression pattern of <i>pSPL3::GUS-SPL3</i> is largely dependent on miR156 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>).

Pri-miRNAs are processed rapidly, so it is often difficult to detect these transcripts, even by qRT-PCR. To get around this problem, we took advantage of <i>se-1</i>, a mutation in miRNA processing that causes pri-miRNAs to accumulate to relatively high levels (<a href=\"#bib33\">Lobbes et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Yang et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Laubinger et al., 2008</a>).

The pri-MIR156C did not decrease significantly between leaves 1 and 2 and leaf 3, but declined 10-fold by leaf 7."

This result, and the observation that <i>MIR156A</i> and <i>MIR156C</i> are expressed at much higher levels than <i>MIR156F</i> and <i>MIR156H</i>, suggests that glucose affects level of miR156 primarily through its effect on <i>MIR156A</i> and <i>MIR156C</i>. To study the mechanism by which sugar regulates the expression of these genes, we produced transgenic plants containing genomic constructs in which the <i>MIR156A</i> or <i>MIR156C</i> hairpin sequences were replaced with GUS+ (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>).

Both glucose and sucrose reduced the abundance of the endogenous pri-MIR156A and pri-MIR156C transcripts in these reporter lines to about 20% of the wild-type level. However, glucose had little or no effect on the expression of the MIR156A-GUS and MIR156C-GUS reporters.

These results suggest that sucrose regulates <i>MIR156A</i> and <i>MIR156C</i> expression at a transcriptional level, but raise the possibility that glucose regulates one or both of these genes by a different mechanism."

                                "text": "Previous work has shown that HXK1 has both enzymatic and regulatory functions in glucose metabolism/signaling (<a href=\"#bib34\">Moore et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Cho et al., 2006</a>). We explored the possibility that <i>HXK1</i> mediates the effect of sugar on vegetative phase change by examining the phenotype of a null allele of <i>HXK1</i>, <i>gin2-1</i>, which was isolated in a L<i>er</i> background. Northern analysis revealed that 8-day-old <i>gin2-1</i> seedlings growing in soil had less miR156 than wild-type plants, whereas 11-day-old seedlings had the same low level of miR156 as wild-type plants (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Thus, HXK1 contributes to the elevated level of miR156 in juvenile plants, but plays a minor role in the expression of miR156 at later stages of shoot development. To determine if HXK1 is required for the response to exogenous sugar, we examined miR156 levels in 10-day-old L<i>er</i> and <i>gin2-1</i> seedlings grown in the presence and absence of 10 mM glucose (these seedlings were at the same developmental stage as 8-day-old soil-grown seedlings). Glucose reduced the abundance of miR156 in L<i>er</i>, but had no effect on miR156 levels in <i>gin2-1</i> (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). miR156 levels were also examined in <i>gin2-1</i> plants transformed with a catalytically inactive form of HXK1 (<i>S177A/gin2-1</i>) (<a href=\"#bib34\">Moore et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Cho et al., 2006</a>) to determine if the effect of HXK1 is attributable to its enzymatic or signaling function. <i>gin2-1</i> plants expressing the catalytically inactive protein (<i>S177A/gin2-1</i>) or the wild-type HXK1 protein (<i>HXK1/gin2-1</i>) displayed the same pattern of miR156 expression as L<i>er</i> in sugar-deficient and sugar-supplemented media (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,C</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Thus, the enzymatic function of HXK1 is not responsible for promoting miR156 expression in sugar-deficient conditions. <i>gin2-1</i> produced a small, but statistically significant, decrease in the number of leaves without abaxial trichomes, and this phenotype was completely rescued by both the <i>S177A</i> and the wild-type <i>HXK1</i> transgenes (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). L<i>er</i> has very short juvenile phase (3\u20134 leaves) in our normal SD growing conditions (22\u00b0C, 10 hr light at 220 \u00b5mol/m<sup>2</sup>/s), making it difficult to detect the effect of mutations that accelerate vegetative phase change; the effect of <i>gin2-1</i> was quite small under these conditions, albeit statistically significant (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Growing plants in SD at 16\u00b0C under relatively low light (60 \u00b5mol/m<sup>2</sup>/s) lengthened the juvenile phase, and increased the difference between wild-type and <i>gin2-1</i> plants (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). This precocious phenotype is consistent with the reduced level of miR156 in <i>gin2-1</i>, and suggests that this decrease in miR156 is functionally significant. In summary, these results indicate that HXK1 promotes the accumulation of miR156 early in shoot development under conditions of low sugar availability, and contributes to the sugar-mediated repression of this miRNA. However, it is clearly not the only factor involved in the developmental decline in miR156 because this decline occurs even in <i>gin2-1</i> (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>)."

To test if sugar could serve as this leaf signal, we took advantage of <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>, which has significantly larger seedlings than <i>Arabidopsis</i> and, like <i>Arabidopsis</i>, produces elevated levels of miR156 in response to defoliation (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib58\">Yang et al., 2011</a>). We reasoned that the substance(s) that promote vegetative phase change would reverse this effect. To mimic the normal situation as much as possible, we applied candidate substances to petiole stubs immediately after defoliation, rather than testing their effect on isolated leaf primordia. We tested if this approach was experimentally feasible by applying crude extracts from 1-cm leaf primordia. Remarkably, these extracts partially suppressed the effect of defoliation on miR156 expression (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). We then tested the effect of glucose, and found that 300 mM glucose was as effective as leaf extracts in reducing miR156 expression in defoliated seedlings (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). This result is consistent with the hypothesis that glucose, or a metabolite derived from glucose, is the leaf factor that promotes vegetative phase change."

In <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>, nutrients trigger the first step in the heterochronic pathway that regulates larval maturation, whereas the dauer developmental arrest pathway is initiated by nutrient-deficient conditions (<a href=\"#bib44\">Rougvie, 2005</a>). Nutrients regulate the timing of metamorphosis in <i>Drosophila</i> through their effect on the TOR nutrient-sensing pathway (<a href=\"#bib30\">Layalle et al., 2008</a>), and in mammals, nutrient levels affect the onset of puberty (<a href=\"#bib52\">Tolson and Chappell, 2012</a>). In plants, evidence that nutrients play an important role in shoot maturation was obtained over a century ago (<a href=\"#bib24\">Goebel, 1908</a>), and led to many subsequent studies of the effect of carbohydrates and other nutrients on leaf and shoot development (<a href=\"#bib8\">Ashby, 1948</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Allsopp, 1967</a>). Our work extends these classical studies by demonstrating that sugar regulates shoot maturation in <i>Arabidopsis</i> by repressing the expression of a key regulator of juvenile identity, miR156. Additionally, we found that <i>MIR156</i> genes are differentially regulated and that sugar only affects a subset of these genes. Analyses of the expression patterns and mutant phenotypes of two of these sugar-repressed genes, <i>MIR156A</i> and <i>MIR156C</i>, demonstrated that they play a major role in vegetative phase change. These results, as well as the evidence that sugars increase the expression of the direct targets of miR156, support the hypothesis that sugars promote vegetative phase change through their effect on miR156, and suggest potential mechanisms for the temporal regulation of vegetative phase change in flowering plants."

                        "text": "Our results also indicate that HXK1 contributes to the sugar-mediated repression of miR156 by promoting the accumulation of miR156 under low sugar conditions. Hexokinases function as glucose sensors in both yeast and plants (<a href=\"#bib43\">Rolland et al., 2002</a>), so the requirement for HXK1 suggests that glucose is at least partially involved in the sugar response. HXK1 participates in a nuclear complex to directly regulate gene expression (<a href=\"#bib16\">Cho et al., 2006</a>). One possibility is that HXK1 directly promotes the transcription of <i>MIR156</i> genes. In this scenario, binding of glucose to HXK1 would block its activity, resulting in a reduction in <i>MIR156A</i> and <i>MIR156C</i> transcription. Because HXK1 does not seem to have transcriptional activity on its own, this would require an interaction between HXK1 and DNA-binding transcription factors, as has been previously described (<a href=\"#bib16\">Cho et al., 2006</a>). It is also possible that sugar represses the accumulation of mature miR156 post-transcriptionally, in addition to its role in the transcriptional regulation of <i>MIR156A</i> and <i>MIR156C</i>. In this scenario, sugar operates by one pathway to repress the transcription of <i>MIR156A</i> and <i>MIR156C</i> and by a different pathway to post-transcriptionally reduce the abundance of miR156. The differential effect of glucose and sucrose on the expression of <i>MIR156A-GUS</i> and <i>MIR156C-GUS</i> may be significant in this regard. Whereas sucrose reliably decreased the expression of these reporters, they were largely insensitive to glucose. This result does not reflect a difference in the inherent sensitivity of seedlings to these sugars because glucose and sucrose were equally effective in reducing the abundance of the endogenous pri-MIR156A and pri-MIR156C transcripts. This result could reflect the absence of glucose-responding <i>cis</i>-regulatory sequences in these constructs, but this seems unlikely because we included the entire intragenic regions upstream and downstream of the miR156 hairpin. A third possibility (based on the observation that glucose decreases the abundance of the endogenous pri-MIR156A and pri-MIR156C transcripts but not transcripts in which the miR156 stem-loop is replaced by GUS) is that glucose regulates the abundance of pri-MIR156A and pri-MIR156C post-transcriptionally, by a mechanism that is dependent on the presence of the miR156 stem-loop structure. If so, glucose must act by destabilizing these primary transcripts, not by blocking the processing of the miR156 stem-loop, because a defect in miR156 processing would be expected to produce an increase in the level of pri-MIR156, not the decrease that we observed. Whatever the case may be, the relatively mild phenotype of <i>gin2-1</i> and the observation that miR156 decreases over time in <i>gin2-1</i> demonstrates that HXK1 is only one of several signaling molecules (<a href=\"#bib47\">Smeekens et al., 2010</a>) involved in the regulation of miR156."

                        "text": "It remains to be determined if sugar levels increase in the shoot apex during vegetative phase change. Nevertheless, it is worth considering how such an increase might occur. One possibility is a regulated increase in sugar export, as occurs upon photoperiodic induction of flowering (<a href=\"#bib31\">Lejeune et al., 1991</a>, <a href=\"#bib32\">1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Perilleux and Bernier, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Corbesier et al., 2002</a>). However, photoperiod does not play a major role in vegetative phase change in <i>Arabidopsis</i> (<a href=\"#bib54\">Willmann and Poethig, 2011</a>), so if the pattern of sugar export changes during vegetative phase change, this event must be regulated by a different factor. An alternative possibility is that vegetative phase change is simply a consequence of an increase in the overall photosynthetic output of the shoot resulting, perhaps, from an increase in leaf number, or a change in photosynthetic efficiency. The observation that the rate of photosynthesis increases significantly during vegetative phase change in <i>Eucalyptus</i> (<a href=\"#bib15\">Cameron, 1970</a>), maize (<a href=\"#bib51\">Thiagarajah et al., 1981</a>), and rice (<a href=\"#bib7\">Asai et al., 2002</a>) is consistent with this latter hypothesis. A corollary of this hypothesis is that the juvenile phase is specifically adapted for growth under light-limited conditions, and studies of <i>Acacia</i> (<a href=\"#bib14\">Brodribb and Hill, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Pasquet-Kok et al., 2010</a>), <i>Eucalyptus</i> (<a href=\"#bib15\">Cameron, 1970</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Ashton and Turner, 1979</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">James and Bell, 2000</a>), and several other species (<a href=\"#bib19\">Day, 1998</a>) indicate that this is the case."

Presumably, this fluctuation in sugar levels affects miR156 expression; yet, most plants do not revert to the juvenile phase once they are in the adult phase, and if they do, this event usually involves a few leaves or branches in a localized region of the shoot (<a href=\"#bib45\">Schaffalitzky de Muckadell, 1954</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Brink, 1962</a>), which is not the pattern expected from a global change in nutrient levels. What accounts for the stability of these phases? One possible explanation is that the sensitivity to sugar in the adult phase is overcome by stable epigenetic modification of <i>MIR156</i> loci. An alternative possibility is that miR156 expression is only strongly affected by sugar below a threshold concentration of sugar. If sugar levels are above this threshold\u2014as they are expected to be in the adult phase\u2014a further increase might have minor effects on miR156 expression, but this variation would not be sufficient to affect shoot identity. In this regard, it is significant that <i>gin2-1</i> had lower levels of miR156 than wild-type plants in the absence of exogenous glucose, but did not differ from wild type in the presence of glucose. The implication of this observation is that HXK1 only promotes miR156 expression under low sugar conditions; above a threshold concentration, glucose blocks HXK1 activity, resulting in a decrease in miR156 expression and buffering miR156 expression against fluctuations in glucose concentration. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that in <i>ch1-4</i> miR156 is only elevated in the juvenile phase; adult phase <i>ch1-4</i> plants had the same level of miR156 as wild-type plants, although there was no obvious improvement in their growth rate or color that might indicate an increase in their photosynthetic capacity."

Supernatants were collected and incubated with 1/10 volume 3M NaOAc and 2 volume of 95% ethanol at \u221220\u00b0C for 2 hr. Small RNAs were then precipitated by centrifuging at 13,000 rpm for 10 min. The concentration of small RNAs was quantified using a nanodrop spectrophotometer before being loaded on polyacrylamide gel."

The truncated version of the <i>MIR156A</i> reporter was generated by replacing the upstream sequence with a truncated PCR product. The <i>MIR156C</i> reporter line was generated in a similar fashion, using genomic fragments 3.7 kb upstream and 3 kb downstream of the MIR156C stem-loop. More than 40 individual transgenic lines from each construct were analyzed, and transgenic lines harboring stable single insertions were selected for further analysis.

In contrast to <i>gin2-1,</i> which is in a Ler background, we did not observe a stable low level of miR156 in T-DNA alleles of HXK1 in a Col background. Second, we found that nitrogen in the form of nitrate or ammonia is essential for the sugar response. When we performed sugar response experiments in a nitrogen-deficient medium, the sugar-mediated regulation of miR156 disappeared. It is well known that plants are acutely sensitive to the C:N ratio, so this result is not surprising. For example, the repressive role glucose on photosynthetic gene expression is most evident in a nitrate-deficient medium (Moore et al, 2003)."

This result suggests that sucrose represses the transcription of <i>MIR156A</i> and <i>MIR156C</i>, whereas glucose destabilizes the primary transcripts of these genes by a mechanism that might be dependent on the presence of the miR156 hairpin.
