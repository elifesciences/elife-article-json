                    "text": "Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) is a leading cause of stroke and dementia. CADASIL, an inherited SVD, alters cerebral artery function, compromising blood flow to the working brain. TIMP3 (tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 3) accumulation in the vascular extracellular matrix in CADASIL is a key contributor to cerebrovascular dysfunction. However, the linkage between elevated TIMP3 and compromised cerebral blood flow (CBF) remains unknown. Here, we show that TIMP3 acts through inhibition of the metalloprotease ADAM17 and HB-EGF to regulate cerebral arterial tone and blood flow responses. In a clinically relevant CADASIL mouse model, we show that exogenous ADAM17 or HB-EGF restores cerebral arterial tone and blood flow responses, and identify upregulated voltage-dependent potassium channel (K<sub>V</sub>) number in cerebral arterial myocytes as a heretofore-unrecognized downstream effector of TIMP3-induced deficits. These results support the concept that the balance of TIMP3 and ADAM17 activity modulates CBF through regulation of myocyte K<sub>V</sub> channel number."

CADASIL, an inherited SVD, alters cerebral artery function, compromising blood flow to the working brain. TIMP3 (tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 3) accumulation in the vascular extracellular matrix in CADASIL is a key contributor to cerebrovascular dysfunction. However, the linkage between elevated TIMP3 and compromised cerebral blood flow (CBF) remains unknown. Here, we show that TIMP3 acts through inhibition of the metalloprotease ADAM17 and HB-EGF to regulate cerebral arterial tone and blood flow responses. In a clinically relevant CADASIL mouse model, we show that exogenous ADAM17 or HB-EGF restores cerebral arterial tone and blood flow responses, and identify upregulated voltage-dependent potassium channel (K<sub>V</sub>) number in cerebral arterial myocytes as a heretofore-unrecognized downstream effector of TIMP3-induced deficits. These results support the concept that the balance of TIMP3 and ADAM17 activity modulates CBF through regulation of myocyte K<sub>V</sub> channel number."

Our limited understanding of the pathogenesis of cerebral SVD is a major obstacle to the development of treatments. Monogenic forms of these diseases, such as CADASIL (Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy), provide a window into the mechanism underlying much more common, but largely indistinguishable, sporadic forms of SVD (<a href=\"#bib24\">Joutel and Faraci, 2014</a>). CADASIL, the most common hereditary cerebral SVD, is caused by dominant mutations in the NOTCH3 receptor that stereotypically lead to the extracellular deposition of NOTCH3 ectodomain (Notch3<sup>ECD</sup>) and aggregates of other proteins on vessels (<a href=\"#bib22\">Joutel et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Chabriat et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Monet-Lepr\u00eatre et al., 2013</a>). A deficit in cerebral blood flow (CBF) hemodynamics is an early feature of the disease, suggesting that cerebrovascular dysfunction may have a key role in disease pathogenesis (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chabriat et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Pfefferkorn et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Liem et al., 2009</a>)."

Cerebral arteries exist in a partially constricted state called 'myogenic tone', which reflects an intrinsic contractile response of arterial myocytes to increases in intravascular pressure. Thus, these arteries are positioned to dilate, and thereby increase local CBF, in response to elevated neuronal activity. This phenomenon, known as functional hyperemia, serves to satisfy enhanced glucose and oxygen demands of active neurons (<a href=\"#bib18\">Iadecola and Nedergaard, 2007</a>). Impaired functional hyperemia and CBF autoregulation, attenuated CBF responses to topical application of vasodilators, and diminished myogenic responses of cerebral arteries and arterioles are early and prominent features of the well-established <i>TgNotch3<sup>R169C</sup></i> CADASIL mouse model (<a href=\"#bib23\">Joutel et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Dabertrand et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Capone et al., 2016</a>).

Remarkably, genetic overexpression of TIMP3 recapitulates both CBF and myogenic-response deficits of the CADASIL\u00a0model; conversely, genetic reduction of TIMP3 in CADASIL model mice restores normal function (<a href=\"#bib6\">Capone et al., 2016</a>). TIMP family members are key regulators of the metalloproteinases that degrade the extracellular matrix. Within the TIMP family, TIMP3 has the broadest spectrum of substrates, which extends to members of the ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloproteinases) family. These metalloproteinases proteolytically release the extracellular domains of membrane-bound cytokines, cell adhesion molecules and growth factors, such as tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 and several ligands of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family, including HB-EGF (heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor) (<a href=\"#bib4\">Brew and Nagase, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Khokha et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Arpino et al., 2015</a>). As such, in addition to being a powerful regulator of extracellular matrix remodeling in various organs (<a href=\"#bib2\">Arpino et al., 2015</a>), TIMP3 is a key player in inflammatory pathologies and autoimmune diseases through regulation of cell surface proteins (<a href=\"#bib4\">Brew and Nagase, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Khokha et al., 2013</a>).

Notably, an influence of the endothelium in myogenic tone deficit was ruled out (<a href=\"#bib12\">Dabertrand et al., 2015</a>). K<sub>V</sub> channels play an important and dynamic role in opposing pressure-induced depolarization and vasoconstriction (<a href=\"#bib31\">Longden et al., 2015</a>). Furthermore, we (<a href=\"#bib12\">Dabertrand et al., 2015</a>) and our collaborators (<a href=\"#bib28\">Koide et al., 2007</a>) have found that down-regulation of plasma membrane K<sub>V</sub> channels through activation of the EGFR pathway restores normal responses to pressure.

We initially ensured that a recombinant protein applied over the cranial window could enter the brain. In the absence of robust anti-TIMP3 antibody suitable for immunohistochemistry and of an in situ assay to detect TIMP3 activity, we assessed brain penetration of Fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled albumin (FITC-BSA, 66 kDa). After 30 min of continuous superfusion, fluorescence imaging of fixed vibratome slices showed that FITC-BSA entered the cortex along penetrating arteries beneath the cranial window (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), consistent with transport via the glymphatic system (<a href=\"#bib19\">Iliff et al., 2012</a>). We found that TIMP3 (40 nM) did not affect resting CBF (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), but did strongly reduce the increase in CBF evoked by whisker stimulation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a>; <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 2</a>,<a href=\"#SD3-data\">3</a>).

To rule out a possible effect of TIMP3 on neural activity, we recorded evoked neural activity during TIMP3 application (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>).

This prompted us to assess the effects of other TIMPs on functional hyperemia. In sharp contrast to TIMP3, neither exogenous TIMP1 (50 nM) nor TIMP2 (50 nM) altered functional hyperemia (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a>; <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 2</a>,<a href=\"#SD3-data\">3</a>)."

If TIMP3 does indeed act through inhibition of ADAM17, its effects on CBF responses should be mimicked by pharmacological inhibition of ADAM17. Here, we used the hydroxamate-based GW413333X inhibitor, which specifically blocks both ADAM10 and ADAM17; the ADAM10 inhibitor GI254023X was used as a control (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hundhausen et al., 2003</a>) (<a href=\"#SD4-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1</a>). We found that GW413333X (5 \u00b5M), but not GI254023X (5 and 20 \u00b5M), strongly attenuated the increase in CBF produced by whisker stimulation or topical application of acetylcholine or adenosine (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C\u2013E</a>; <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>; <a href=\"#SD5-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 2</a>,<a href=\"#SD6-data\">3</a>). To further support a specific role for ADAM17 in these defects, we assessed CBF responses following reduction of ADAM17 levels using a genetic approach. Complete ablation of ADAM17 is lethal (<a href=\"#bib38\">Peschon et al., 1998</a>). Therefore, we used hypomorphic mice with dramatically reduced expression of ADAM17 (<i>Adam17<sup>ex/ex</sup></i>) using the exon-induced translational stop strategy. These mice are viable, but develop eye, skin and heart defects as a consequence of impaired EGFR signaling (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chalaris et al., 2010</a>). We found that genetic depletion of ADAM17 strongly attenuated CBF responses in a dose-dependent manner (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F,G</a>; <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>; <a href=\"#SD5-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 2</a>,<a href=\"#SD6-data\">3</a>). To confirm that the reduction in evoked CBF responses in these mice is caused by reduced ADAM17 expression, we examined whether an enzymatically active extracellular domain of ADAM17 (sADAM17) applied exogenously could prevent these CBF deficits. Topical neocortical application of sADAM17 (16 nM) (<a href=\"#SD4-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1</a>) did not affect cerebrovascular responses in wild-type mice, but did fully restore CBF responses in <i>Adam17<sup>ex/+</sup></i> mice with half-reduced ADAM17 levels (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H\u2013J</a>; <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figures supplements 1C</a>,<a href=\"#fig2s2\">2A</a>; <a href=\"#SD5-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 2</a>,<a href=\"#SD6-data\">3</a>).

Indeed, we found that neocortical application of the selective ErbB1/EGFR and ErbB4 inhibitor, tyrphostin AG1478 (10 and 20 \u00b5M), strongly attenuated the evoked CBF responses, but did not impair resting CBF. In contrast, CBF responses were unaffected by the selective ErbB2 inhibitor, tyrphostin AG825, at both 50 and 200 \u00b5M (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C\u2013E</a>; <a href=\"#SD8-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 2</a>, <a href=\"#SD9-data\">3</a>). Of note, ErbB3 lacks kinase activity (<a href=\"#bib40\">Roskoski 2014</a>). We then tested the effect of soluble recombinant decoy ErbB receptors, known as chimeric ErbB receptor traps, which comprise the truncated extracellular domain of the ErbB receptor fused with the constant region (Fc) of human immunoglobulin (<a href=\"#bib45\">Stratman et al., 2010</a>). Evoked CBF responses were attenuated by superfusion of either ErbB1/EGFR (67 nM) or ErbB4 (71 nM) receptor traps, which block the function of ErbB1 and ErbB4 ligands, respectively, but not by superfusion of the ErbB3 (71 nM) receptor trap or by control IgG1 Fc (286 nM) and IgG2 Fc (286 nM) fragments (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F\u2013H</a>; <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>; <a href=\"#SD8-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 2</a>, <a href=\"#SD9-data\">3</a>).

ErbB2 has no known ligand (<a href=\"#bib40\">Roskoski, 2014</a>); thus, these data are consistent with a role for ErbB1/EGFR or ErbB4 activation in CBF responses, and suggest the involvement of bispecific ligands with dual-specificity toward ErbB1 and ErbB4."

                                "text": "Next, we sought to pinpoint which ErbB ligand that requires <i>ADAM17</i> cleavage for activation is involved in CBF regulation. Heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF) is one of three ligands that can bind to both ErbB1 and ErbB4 and is expressed in the vasculature (<a href=\"#bib53\">Zhang et al., 2014</a>). ADAM17 is the major sheddase of HB-EGF (<a href=\"#bib41\">Sahin et al., 2004</a>), and ADAM17-mediated shedding of proHB-EGF largely regulates soluble, mature HB-EGF binding to and activating ErbB receptors (<a href=\"#bib51\">Yamazaki et al., 2003</a>). Moreover, mice lacking HB-EGF have reduced postnatal viability with defective cardiac valvulogenesis, similar to mice lacking ADAM17 (<a href=\"#bib21\">Jackson et al., 2003</a>), prompting us to study the role of HB-EGF in cerebrovascular regulation. To do this, we examined the impact of HB-EGF inhibition on CBF responses. Unlike all other EGF ligands apart from amphiregulin, HB-EGF has a heparin-binding domain, and interactions through this domain with cell surface-associated heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) are necessary for binding and activation of ErbB receptors (<a href=\"#bib15\">Higashiyama et al., 1993</a>). We found that superfusion of heparin (40 ui/mL), which competitively inhibits binding of HB-EGF to cell surface HSPGs (<a href=\"#bib15\">Higashiyama et al., 1993</a>), impaired evoked CBF responses without affecting resting CBF (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3I\u2013K</a>; <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>; <a href=\"#SD8-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 2</a>, <a href=\"#SD9-data\">3</a>). To further support a role for HB-EGF in evoked CBF responses, we examined the effects of the synthetic peptide p21, which corresponds to the heparin-binding domain of murine HB-EGF and similarly inhibits binding of HB-EGF to cell surface HSPGs (<a href=\"#bib15\">Higashiyama et al., 1993</a>). We found that superfusion of p21 (12 \u00b5M) similarly impaired evoked CBF responses without affecting resting CBF (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3I\u2013K</a>; <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>; <a href=\"#SD8-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 2</a>, <a href=\"#SD9-data\">3</a>); in contrast, a mutated inactive p21 peptide (p21-mut; 12 \u00b5M) had no effect on evoked or resting CBF."

TIMP3 or the ADAM10/17 inhibitor, GW413333X, was topically applied over the neocortex and CBF responses were measured before and after superfusion with sHB-EGF. We found that sHB-EGF (20 nM) prevented TIMP3 and GW-induced cerebrovascular deficits (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D\u2013I</a>; <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>; <a href=\"#SD11-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 2</a>,<a href=\"#SD12-data\">3</a>).

Pressurized arteries were pre-incubated with recombinant TIMP3 (4 nM) or the ADAM10/ADAM17 inhibitor GW413333 in the presence of sHB-EGF (3 nM) or vehicle. We found that co-incubation of arterial segments with sHB-EGF significantly ameliorated the TIMP3-induced reduction in arterial tone (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>; <a href=\"#SD14-data\">Figure 5\u2014source data 2</a>).

Moreover, sHB-EGF significantly increased myogenic tone in arteries from heterozygous ADAM17-hypomorphic mice (<i>Adam17<sup>ex/+</sup></i>), restoring a near-normal myogenic phenotype (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5I</a>; <a href=\"#SD14-data\">Figure 5\u2014source data 2</a>).

We found that preincubation of arterial segments with the enzymatically active extracellular domain of ADAM17 (3.2 nM) increased myogenic tone in arteries from <i>TgNotch3<sup>R169C</sup></i> CADASIL mice, whereas sADAM17 had no detectable effect on arterial segments from wild-type mice at this concentration (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>).

Currents were recorded in response to 10-mV voltage steps from \u221270 mV to +60 mV. We found that K<sub>V</sub> current density was significantly lower in myocytes from <i>TgNotch3<sup>R169C</sup>;Timp3<sup>+/-</sup></i> mice than in myocytes from <i>TgNotch3<sup>R169C</sup>;Timp3<sup>+/+</sup></i> at all voltage steps above +10 mV (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A\u2013C</a>; <a href=\"#SD18-data\">Figure 7\u2014source data 2</a>). Conversely, incubation of wild-type arterial myocytes with recombinant TIMP3 (8 nM) resulted in a significant increase in K<sub>V</sub> current density compared with myocytes incubated with vehicle (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>; <a href=\"#SD18-data\">Figure 7\u2014source data 2</a>). Remarkably, half-maximal activation voltage (V<sub>0.5</sub>) and slope (k), determined by fitting normalized peak tail currents to the Boltzmann equation, were statistically indistinguishable among arterial myocytes from the different groups analyzed. Likewise, activation (\u03c4<sub>act</sub>) and deactivation (\u03c4<sub>deact</sub>) time constants determined from exponential fits of individual voltage-evoked current traces and current decay, respectively, were comparable among the different groups. These current kinetics, attributable to K<sub>V</sub>1.5 channels, are consistent with our previous report (<a href=\"#bib12\">Dabertrand et al., 2015</a>). These results indicate that the TIMP3 pathway regulates the number of channels, and not channel properties (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2</a>; <a href=\"#SD17-data\">Figure 7\u2014source data 1</a>,<a href=\"#SD18-data\">2</a>).

This analysis showed that exogenously applied TIMP3 increased the number of K<sub>V</sub> channels in arteries from wild-type mice by ~25% (from 3120 to 3920 per myocyte). A similar increase in K<sub>V</sub> channel number was observed in the TIMP3-overexpressing <i>TgNotch3<sup>R169C</sup>;Timp3<sup>+/+</sup></i> genetic model, where channel density (4840/myocyte) was ~38% greater than that in <i>TgNotch3<sup>R169C</sup>;Timp3<sup>+/-</sup></i> mice (3510/myocyte)."

Next, using the <i>TgNotch3<sup>R169C\u00a0</sup></i>model, we provided pharmacological evidence that, in the setting of CADASIL, attenuated ADAM17 and HB-EGF-dependent activation of ErbB1/ErbB4 underlies deficits in evoked CBF responses and cerebral arterial tone. Further, by using patch clamp electrophysiology in combination with genetic and pharmacological approaches, we identified upregulated K<sub>V</sub> channel current density in cerebral arterial myocytes as the heretofore-unrecognized downstream effector of this TIMP3-sensitive pathway by which excess TIMP3 reduces arterial tone in the <i>TgNotch3<sup>R169C\u00a0</sup></i>CADASIL model. Collectively, these data suggest that elevated TIMP3 blunts the activity of the ADAM17/HB-EGF/(ErbB1/ErbB4) pathway in cerebral arterial myocytes, thereby attenuating myogenic responses in brain arteries and compromising CBF regulation in CADASIL (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>)."

ADAM17 at the cell surface of cerebral arterial myocytes is therefore active and able to cleave and release sHB-EGF, resulting in ErbB1/ErbB4 activation and K<sub>V</sub>1 channel endocytosis. The internalization of K<sub>V</sub>1 channels relieves the tonic hyperpolarizing influence of these channels on the membrane potential of arterial myocytes, thereby allowing full development of pressure-induced vasoconstriction (myogenic tone) of brain arteries and enabling full CBF responses to whisker stimulation and vasodilators.

The resulting increase in K<sub>V</sub>1 current density hyperpolarizes arterial myocytes, acting as a brake to limit the development of myogenic tone and evoked CBF responses."

K<sub>V</sub> channels are powerful negative regulators of arterial tone, which act by exerting a tonic hyperpolarizing influence on the membrane potential of arterial smooth muscle cells that serves to limit pressure-induced depolarization and vasoconstriction (<a href=\"#bib31\">Longden et al., 2015</a>). Our results introduce the novel concept that the concentration of TIMP3 in brain vessels regulates arterial tone and blood flow by playing a critical role in adjusting K<sub>V</sub> channel density. We surmise that such an extracellular matrix-dependent paradigm may be at play in more common forms of cerebral small vessel disease where remodeling of the vascular extracellular matrix is a key feature (<a href=\"#bib25\">Joutel et al., 2016</a>)."

Interestingly, we found that only factors that inhibit this pathway had a functional effect; activating this pathway in wild-type mice by providing sADAM17 or sHB-EGF did not enhance evoked CBF responses or myogenic tone. This suggests that the set point of this pathway in a physiological in vivo setting is already at maximum. In support of this interpretation is a recent study showing that genetic overexpression of ADAM17 protein does not result in enhanced shedding activity in vivo (<a href=\"#bib52\">Yoda et al., 2013</a>). On the other hand, decreasing K<sub>V</sub> current density in cerebral artery myocytes, which is at least 50% lower than that in peripheral artery myocytes (<a href=\"#bib12\">Dabertrand et al., 2015</a>), could be an in vivo rate-limiting step following physiological activation of this pathway. Notably however, studies in experimental models of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage indicate that this pathway can be further activated in a pathological context. Indeed, Wellman and colleagues have shown that the blood component, oxyhemoglobin, causes suppression of K<sub>V</sub> currents in cerebral arterial myocytes through HB-EGF\u2013mediated activation of ErbB1/ErbB4, resulting in membrane depolarization and enhanced tone of brain arteries (<a href=\"#bib35\">Nystoriak et al., 2011</a>)."

Moreover, our previous (<a href=\"#bib12\">Dabertrand et al., 2015</a>) and current results collectively indicate that upregulation of K<sub>V</sub> channels is sufficient to explain the decrease in myogenic tone, without an involvement of the endothelium or large conductance, voltage and Ca<sup>2+</sup> activated K<sup>+</sup> (BK) channels. Nonetheless, we cannot exclude an effect on other channels engaged by pressure. Given the key role of K<sub>V</sub> channels in the regulation of arterial tone, these findings are consistent with the interpretation that the smooth muscle ADAM17/HB-EGF/(ErbB1/ErbB4)/K<sub>V</sub> pathway regulates evoked CBF responses by elevating the physiological tone of brain arteries, and that the reduction in myogenic tone caused by inhibition of this pathway by excess TIMP3 in the extracellular matrix surrounding smooth muscle cells likely accounts for the attenuation of evoked CBF responses in CADASIL (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). A previous study in acute brain slices provides additional support for this interpretation, showing that the initial degree of arteriolar tone determines the diameter changes elicited by functional hyperemia (<a href=\"#bib3\">Blanco et al., 2008</a>). On the other hand, a transient loss of myogenic tone is expected to increase resting CBF, and vice versa. Unexpectedly, we found that acute pharmacological blockade of the ADAM17/HB-EGF/(ErbB1/ErbB4) pathway did not affect resting CBF (or inconsistently increased it), despite its ability to profoundly reduce myogenic responses of brain arteries ex vivo. Also, neocortical application of exogenous sADAM17 unexpectedly increased resting CBF in <i>TgNotch3<sup>R169C</sup></i>mice, despite its ability to increase and normalize myogenic tone in these mice. However, although myogenic tone and myogenic responses are known to contribute to the regulation of resting CBF, their relative importance are hard to quantify and poorly understood; their contribution may also change depending on conditions or disease states and other mechanisms \u2014metabolic, neural, endothelial\u2014also influence or contribute to resting CBF (<a href=\"#bib11\">Cipolla, 2009</a>). It is also possible that overall resting CBF does not change despite seeing a change in myogenic tone in one portion of the vasculature because of compensatory adjustments in vessels downstream. Simultaneous in vivo recordings of blood flow and vessel diameters may be of interest to address this possibility. Moreover, it should be stressed that in our experiments cell populations targeted by pharmacological compounds likely differ depending on whether the compound is topically applied in vivo over the somatosensory cortex or incubated ex vivo\u00a0with isolated brain arteries. In particular, proteins or peptides topically applied in vivo are thought to target only the abluminal surface of the vessel (smooth muscle cells) (<a href=\"#bib37\">Park et al., 2013</a>) and may target other brain cells (e.g., astrocytes), whereas ex vivo incubation targets only vascular cells, including both abluminal and luminal (endothelial cell) surfaces. In this regard, involvement of the ADAM17/HB-EGF/(ErbB1/ErbB4) pathway in cells other than arterial myocytes cannot be ruled out. Finally, our results may point toward the involvement of other downstream effectors in addition to K<sub>V</sub> channels in the regulation of CBF by this pathway."

Several lines of evidence from cell systems indicate that the bulk of ADAM17 is intracellular, whereas the majority of ADAM17 shedding activity occurs at the cell surface, where ADAM17 can associate with its natural inhibitor TIMP3 (<a href=\"#bib50\">Xu et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Chapnick et al., 2015</a>). Thus, the ratio of TIMP3 and ADAM17 at the cell surface is likely a key determinant of ADAM17 activity. Biochemical confirmation of this in brain arteries will require further investigation, although the lack of ADAM17 and TIMP3 antibodies suitable for immunohistochemistry, the tiny amount of material provided by segments of cerebral arteries for biochemical studies, and the lack of in situ or specific assay to assess ADAM17 activity in tissues remain major technical obstacles."

Functional homo- or heteromeric K<sub>V</sub> channels are formed from four \u03b1-subunits, plus additional \u03b2-subunits.

Whereas direct tyrosine phosphorylation of the channel has been identified as the mechanism regulating K<sub>V</sub> 1.2 endocytosis in HEK or neuronal cells (<a href=\"#bib34\">Nesti et al., 2004</a>), a role for this mechanism in K<sub>V</sub>1.5 endocytosis has not yet been demonstrated (<a href=\"#bib20\">Ishiguro et al., 2006</a>). Whether other subunits within the K<sub>V</sub> 1.5 channel complex or a closely associated protein is the target of phosphorylation remains to be tested. On the other hand, K<sub>V</sub> channel suppression could be mediated by enhanced lysosomal or proteasomal degradation, as recently shown for K<sub>V</sub> 1.5 in mesenteric arteries (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kidd et al., 2015</a>).

Once prepared, arteries were allowed to stabilize for at least 60 min at a pressure of 60 mmHg until the development of basal tone. Pressure was then switched to 20 mmHg and compounds were added to the chamber for 20 to 60 min before increasing the intraluminal pressure to 40, 60, 80 and 100 mm Hg using a pressure-servo control pump. Vessel internal diameter was continuously recorded using a CCD camera and edge-detection software (Biopac MP150; Biopac Systems Inc., CA or AcqKnowledge Software; IonOptix, Milton, MA). Diameters measured in PSS were considered active diameters. At the conclusion of each experiment, maximal dilation was obtained in nominally Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free PSS containing EGTA (2\u20135 mM; Sigma). Artery diameters are given in micrometers.

Digested tissue was washed out and gently triturated with a fire-polished glass pipette. The single-cell suspension of myocytes was refrigerated until use (typically 4\u20136 hr).

Currents were recorded from cells on an Axopatch 200B amplifier, filtered at 2 kHz using a low-pass Bessel filter, and digitized at 10 kHz (Digidata 1322A; Molecular Devices). pCLAMP-9 software (Molecular Devices) was used for data recording and analysis.

Sample size needed for CBF and myogenic tone analysis as well as for electrophysiology experiments was determined based on our prior works (<a href=\"#bib12\">Dabertrand et al., 2015</a>), (<a href=\"#bib6\">Capone et al., 2016</a>); n values indicate the number of biological replicates. CBF responses were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) or repeated-measure ANOVA followed by Bonferroni or Tukey post-hoc tests. Evoked potential fields were analyzed using unpaired Student\u2019s t-test. Myogenic tone and current densities were analyzed by two-way repeated-measure ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post-hoc tests. All statistics were performed using Graph Pad Prism. Differences with p-values &lt; 0.05 were considered statistically significant. The significance level was set at p&lt;0.05."

Previous work had shown that TIMP3 abnormally accumulates in the extracellular matrix of brain vessels of patients and <i>TgNotch3<sup>R169C</sup></i> mice with CADASIL, a monogenic form of small vessel disease. Genetic overexpression of TIMP3 recapitulates both CBF and myogenic response deficits of the CADASIL model, while genetic reduction of TIMP3 restores normal function. Also, they had previously shown that downregulation of plasma membrane K<sub>v</sub> channels restored normal responses to pressure. Here, they demonstrate that TIMP3 mediates cerebrovascular function through ADAM17/HB-EGF/EGFR (ErbB1/ErbB4) signaling pathway. In CADASIL, accumulation of TIMP3 leads to the inhibition of ADAM17, consequently, prevents sHB-EGF from being cleaved and affects the subsequent ErbB1/ErbB4 activity. Through a mechanism yet to be determined, this apparently decreases K<sub>v</sub> 1 channel endocytosis. The enhanced K<sub>v</sub> 1 channel activity due to increased current density limits the myogenic tone and evoked CBF responses."

The prior study from this research group (PMID:25646445) shows increases in current density between <i>TgNotch3<sup>R169C</sup></i> and wild-type mice at membrane potentials that are physiologically relevant for smooth muscle cells (i.e., -30 mV). If the authors' proposed mechanism is correct, a larger influence of TIMP3 at these membrane potentials would be expected. These findings call into question the authors' contention that increases in K<sub>v</sub> channel surface expression accounts for loss of myogenic contractility. Perhaps a more through characterization of electrophysiological properties is needed that would encompass other K<sup>+</sup> channels (BK) as well as depolarizing influences (TMEM16A, TRPC6, TRPM4). At a minimum, the authors should at least discuss the limitations of the data that are presented."

Interestingly, we found that in the <i>ADAM17<sup>ex/wt</sup> </i>mice, resting flow was not significantly decreased and unchanged upon topical application of sADAM17. In contrast, in TgBAC-TIMP3 and <i>TgNotch3<sup>R169C</sup></i> mice, resting CBF was significantly reduced, and significantly improved upon application of sADAM17, with values close to values observed in WT mice. Therefore, it appears that application of sADAM17 in these genetic models normalize resting and evoked CBF responses towards the same absolute values of WT mice."

First, we would like to point out that, in <i>TgNotch3<sup>R169C</sup></i> mice, we previously established that myogenic responses are similarly impaired in parenchymal arterioles and pial arteries (Dabertrand et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2015;112(7):E796\u2013805), suggesting that the pathway altered by the CADASIL mutation is the same in the pial arteries and intraparenchymal arterioles. Second, as suggested, a new set of experiments has been carried out on parenchymal arterioles (PAs). We compared changes in the diameter of PAs in response to increasing intraluminal pressure. We observed that pre-incubation with TIMP3 blunted the myogenic response compared to pre-incubation with vehicle, whereas recombinant TIMP2 (10 nM) had no effect, suggesting that the TIMP3 sensitive pathway similarly operates in both pial and intraparenchymal arterioles.
