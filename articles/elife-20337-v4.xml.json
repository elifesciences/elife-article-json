Rodent-based studies show that activity-dependent transcriptional programs mediate myriad functions in neuronal development, but the extent of their conservation in human neurons is unknown. We compared activity-dependent transcriptional responses in developing human stem cell-derived cortical neurons with those induced in developing primary- or stem cell-derived mouse cortical neurons. While activity-dependent gene-responsiveness showed little dependence on developmental stage or origin (primary tissue vs. stem cell), notable species-dependent differences were observed. Moreover, differential species-specific gene ortholog regulation was recapitulated in aneuploid mouse neurons carrying human chromosome-21, implicating promoter/enhancer sequence divergence as a factor, including human-specific activity-responsive AP-1 sites. These findings support the use of human neuronal systems for probing transcriptional responses to physiological stimuli or indeed pharmaceutical agents."

Rodent-based studies show that activity-dependent transcriptional programs mediate myriad functions in neuronal development, but the extent of their conservation in human neurons is unknown. We compared activity-dependent transcriptional responses in developing human stem cell-derived cortical neurons with those induced in developing primary- or stem cell-derived mouse cortical neurons. While activity-dependent gene-responsiveness showed little dependence on developmental stage or origin (primary tissue vs. stem cell), notable species-dependent differences were observed. Moreover, differential species-specific gene ortholog regulation was recapitulated in aneuploid mouse neurons carrying human chromosome-21, implicating promoter/enhancer sequence divergence as a factor, including human-specific activity-responsive AP-1 sites. These findings support the use of human neuronal systems for probing transcriptional responses to physiological stimuli or indeed pharmaceutical agents."

However, the conservation or divergence of dynamic signal-dependent programs of gene expression is incompletely understood, particularly in the nervous system. A fundamental transcriptional program of this sort is that elicited in neurons by electrical activity, triggered via Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through ligand- and/or voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and activating genes containing Ca<sup>2+</sup>-responsive transcription factor binding sites in their promoters (<a href=\"#bib33\">Sheng and Greenberg, 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Morgan and Curran, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">West et al., 2001</a>). These changes in gene expression are critical to a neuron\u2019s functional response to electrical activity in development and maturity (<a href=\"#bib19\">Konur and Ghosh, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">West and Greenberg, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bell and Hardingham, 2011</a>), and are totally distinct from the toxic sequelae of excitotoxic Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx (<a href=\"#bib13\">Hardingham and Bading, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Wyllie et al., 2013</a>). For example, rodent studies have shown that activity-dependent gene expression programs direct myriad processes in developing neurons, including neuroprotection, dendritic arborization, and synaptic plasticity (<a href=\"#bib19\">Konur and Ghosh, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">West and Greenberg, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bell and Hardingham, 2011</a>). Moreover, certain neurodevelopmental disorders are associated with defects in activity-dependent transcriptional mechanisms (<a href=\"#bib40\">West and Greenberg, 2011</a>), making it important to fully understand transcriptional programs that are triggered by electrical activity in developing human neurons."

Embryonic stem cell (ESC)-based technology enables the generation of glutamatergic cortical-patterned neurons from human embryonic stem cells (hESC<sup>CORT</sup>-neurons) of sufficient homogeneity and electrical maturity (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bilican et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Livesey et al., 2014</a>) to enable the study of activity-dependent gene expression. Such responses can then be compared to both primary mouse cortical neurons (of differing developmental stages) as well as those derived from mouse ESCs, to distinguish species-specific differences from those dependent on developmental stage or origin (primary tissue vs. stem cell line). Moreover, it is in theory possible to study mouse-human ortholog regulation in the same neuron by exploiting the aneuploid Tc1 mouse which carries a freely segregating copy of human chromosome-21, to identify whether any differences are independent of cellular environment (i.e. are due to DNA sequence divergence). A combination of these approaches has been employed to reveal strong conservation of the neuronal activity-dependent transcriptome onto which a significant degree of divergence is overlaid."

To address (i) we compared KCl/FPL-induced gene regulation in DIV10 Mus-PRIM<sup>CORT</sup>-neurons with that in synaptically immature DIV4 Mus-PRIM<sup>CORT</sup>-neurons, which revealed a strong correlation (p&lt;0.0001, r\u00a0=\u00a00.834, 95% CI: 0.833 to 0.844, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1e</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>), and a log<sub>2</sub> DRI (DIV4:DIV10) distribution curve (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1f</a>, <a href=\"#SD5-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 5</a>) substantially narrower than that observed in <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1e</a>.

Comparison of basal expression levels between Hum-ESC<sup>CORT</sup>-neurons and mouse neurons (DIV10 Mus-PRIM<sup>CORT</sup>-neurons, DIV4 Mus-PRIM<sup>CORT</sup>-neurons, and Mus-ESC<sup>CORT</sup>-neurons) revealed correlation coefficients of 0.714, 0.711, and 0.710 (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1b\u2013d</a>, <a href=\"#SD8-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 3</a>). This correlation is substantially stronger than the that observed when comparing gene fold-change after KCl stimulation (0.480, 0.526,\u00a00.595, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1d</a>, <a href=\"#fig2\">2g</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1g</a>). Moreover, we performed a similar clustering analysis as in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2h</a> which illustrates this graphically: i.e. while the basal expression profile of Hum-ESC<sup>CORT</sup>-neurons does not cluster as closely as the three mouse neuronal populations do to each other, the degree of difference is less than that observed in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2h</a> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2i</a>). Therefore basal neuronal gene expression shows less divergence than the responsiveness of genes to depolarization. We also investigated whether gene differential responsiveness to KCl (DRI) in human vs. mouse neurons has any relationship with the relative basal expression of that gene in human vs. mouse neurons. For each of the 11,302 orthologous pairs, we plotted the Log<sub>2</sub>(DRI) Hum-ESC<sup>CORT</sup>- vs. DIV10 Mus-PRIM<sup>CORT</sup>-neurons (i.e. DRIs from <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1e</a>) against the Log<sub>2</sub>(DBEI), where DBEI (differential basal expression index) is the ratio of basal expression in Hum-ESC<sup>CORT</sup>- vs. DIV10 Mus-PRIM<sup>CORT</sup>-neurons (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1e</a>, <a href=\"#SD7-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 2</a>). As can be seen, there is no link between a gene's relative responsiveness to depolarization in human vs. mouse neurons, and its relative basal expression levels in human vs. mouse neurons. Moreover, if we consider the 657 genes where Log<sub>2</sub>(DRI)&gt;1, the standard deviation of their respective Log<sub>2</sub>(DBEI), 1.45, is similar to the standard deviation of Log<sub>2</sub>(DBEI) across all 11,302 genes (1.39), suggesting that there is no dramatic change in divergence of basal gene expression <i>regardless of direction</i>, in genes where DRI&gt;1. Thus, evolutionary differences in activity-dependent gene responsiveness are not substantially attributable to differences in basal expression."

To investigate whether genetic sequence could be sufficient to quantitatively influence species-specific gene inducibility, we utilized neurons cultured from the Tc1 transchromosomic mouse strain which carries a copy of human chromosome 21 (Hsa21), albeit with approximately 10% deleted (<a href=\"#bib27\">O'Doherty et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Gribble et al., 2013</a>). Thus, regulation of Hsa21 genes, plus their mouse 1:1 ortholog, could be studied side-by-side in the same cellular environment of a mouse primary neuron. We cultured cortical neurons from Tc1 embryos to DIV10, stimulated \u00b1 KCL/FPL, performed RNA-seq, and developed a workflow that distinguished between human and mouse RNA-seq reads, discarding any reads that were ambiguous. Once the initial criterion of a perfect sequence match of the RNA-seq read to either Hsa21 or the mouse genome was met, only a further 0.055% of reads were discarded due to 100% sequence conservation between species. Thus, the\u00a0expression level of human and mouse genes carried in the Tc1 mouse can be analysed \u00b1 stimulation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a</a>).

Importantly, we observed a significant correlation between these DRIs (p&lt;0.0001, r\u00a0=\u00a00.730, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b</a>, <a href=\"#SD10-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 2</a>), meaning that differences in gene regulation observed in separate human and mouse cortical neuron preparations ('separate DRI') are broadly recapitulated when the orthologs are studied side-by-side in the same cellular environment ('Tc1 DRI'). This points to the DNA sequence as a contributor to quantitative species-specific gene responsiveness. An example of such a gene is <i>ETS2</i>, the human ortholog of which is induced more strongly and rapidly than the mouse ortholog (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3c,d</a>, <a href=\"#SD11-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 3</a>).

Moreover, expression of inhibitory AP-1 mutant TAM67 (<a href=\"#bib7\">Brown et al., 1993</a>) inhibited Hum-<i>ETS2</i>-luciferase reporter induction, and mutation of the three AP-1 sites to the corresponding mouse sequence abolished inducibility (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3e</a>).

For example, of the top 100 most strongly induced human genes in Hum-ESC<sup>CORT</sup>-neurons (FC&gt;3.5-fold, Padj&lt;0.05), 85 are also induced in Mus-ESC<sup>CORT</sup>-neurons (FC&gt;1.5-fold, Padj&lt;0.05). Of the remaining 15 genes, 6 are induced in DIV4 and/or DIV10 Mus-PRIM<sup>CORT</sup>-neurons, taking the total to 91/100. Conserved inducibility remains high even at a lower fold-change cut-off: e.g. 409 out of 475 genes induced &gt;2-fold (Padj&lt;0.05) in Hum-ESC<sup>CORT</sup>-neurons are also induced (FC&gt;1.5-fold, Padj&lt;0.05) in one or more of the mouse neuronal preparations.

In the balance between precision and recall, our strategy is conservative, in that it aims foremost to minimise the number of reads allocated to the incorrect species; but we simultaneously seek to maximise the number of reads that can be unambiguously assigned to the correct species. The sorting criteria detailed below were chosen to effect this goal. In this species-specific sorting (SSS) procedure, reads are first mapped to the genomes of each species with the STAR RNA-seq aligner. At this stage multi-mapping alignments are allowed (--outFilterMultimapNmax 10000), but only those with an alignment score equal to the maximum (--outFilterMultimapScoreRange 0). Subsequently, for each RNA-seq read the alignments of that read to each genome are compared. If the read has alignments to the mouse genome, but no alignments to the human chromosome-21 exist, the read is provisionally assigned to the mouse; note, however, the further requirements given below for a read to be finally allocated to this genome. Similarly, if alignments to human chromosome-21 exist, but there are no alignments to the mouse genome, the read is provisionally assigned to the human. If alignments to both genomes exist, these alignments are examined in more detail. Firstly, any read which aligns multiple times to either genome is discarded, since in this initial conservative strategy their exclusion removes a potential source of ambiguity. Next, the number of mismatched bases between the mapped read and each genome is examined. If the number of mismatches is smaller for one species, the read is provisionally allocated to that genome. If the number of mismatches for each species is equal, a further check is made on the structure of the alignments; a successful alignment is required to span the full length of the read (without any clipping of bases), and, if the alignment spans an intron, at least 5 bases are required to align to the exons on either side of the boundary. If these criteria are satisfied for the alignment to one genome, but not to the other, then the read is provisionally assigned to the first genome. If the criteria are satisfied for the alignments to both genomes, the read is rejected as ambiguous; it cannot be assigned with confidence to one species rather than the other. The read is also rejected if the structural criteria are not satisfied for the alignments to either genome."

In the former case, a final set of checks are made on the provisional alignment. In this conservative strategy, these are that there should be no mismatches between the mapped read and the genome, and that the structural criteria outlined above are satisfied (if this has not already been confirmed). The outcome of this procedure is that all reads successfully assigned to one species or the other have a single, full-length alignment to that species' genome, with no mismatched bases. Subsequently, for each sample, per-gene read counts were summarised using featureCounts. Relative expression levels of genes are expressed as fragments per million reads per kilobase of message (FPKM). Within the SSS-workflow, only reads that are unambiguously attributed to a particular species are used as the denominator in the FPKM calculation. The value for the length of message for a particular gene refers to the maximum transcript length. Where gene length data is given, this refers to the number of nucleotides contained within the union of all exons of all transcripts of the gene, including 5' and 3' UTRs.

All other promoter sequences (both wild-type and mutant) were obtained as synthetic clones from Life Technologies (Geneart) and then subcloned into pGL4.10. This included the corresponding mouse <i>Ets2</i> promoter sequence (ENSMUST00000023612 -1055 to -65, or NM_011809.3 -1387 to -397) and a mutated form of the human <i>ETS2</i> promoter with the putative AP-1 sites mutated to the corresponding mouse sequence (<i>ETS2</i>(\u0394AP1)) was synthesized. The following plasmids have been described previously: pcDNA3-cJun(3\u2013122) (TAM-67) (<a href=\"#bib7\">Brown et al., 1993</a>). Firefly luciferase-based reporter gene constructs were transfected (Lipofectamine 2000) into DIV8 mouse cortical neurons as along with a Renilla expression vector (pTK-RL) control. The number of biological replicates were performed based on previous studies where site-directed mutagenesis was performed on reporter constructs to assess activity-dependent promoter regulation (<a href=\"#bib28\">Papadia et al., 2008</a>). Neurons were stimulated with KCl/FPL (where appropriate) 24\u2009hr after transfection. Luciferase assays were performed using the Dual Glo assay kit (Promega) with Firefly luciferase-based reporter gene activity normalized to the Renilla control (pTK-RL plasmid) in all cases."

Initially they derive neurons from human ES cells and use RNAseq to compare the programs of gene expression induced to those of mouse cortical neurons. These data are comprehensive and suggest significant differences in gene induction that could be important in the human. However, to address the concern that differences in the nature of the experimental material could also impact gene induction, the authors then perform a very interesting series of experiments in a mouse strain that carries a copy of human chromosome 21, allowing for comparison of activity-regulated Chr 21 genes in the same cells across species. Here the authors report one clear example (ETS2) that is far more activity-inducible from the human chromosome compared with the mouse. They map the difference in inducibility to differences in regulatory element sequence that create an AP-1 binding site only in the human. Overall this is a novel proof-of-principle example of species-specific differences in activity-dependent gene regulation in neurons."

As can be seen, there is no link between a gene's relative responsiveness to depolarisation in human vs. mouse neurons, and its relative basal expression levels in human vs. mouse neurons. Moreover, if we consider the 657 genes where Log<sub>2</sub>(DRI)&gt;1, the standard deviation of their respective Log<sub>2</sub>(DBEI), 1.45, is similar to the standard deviation of Log<sub>2</sub>(DBEI) across all 11,302 genes (1.39), suggesting that there is no dramatic change in divergence of basal gene expression <i>regardless of direction</i>, in genes where DRI&gt;1.
