The effect of carbon black (CB), a universal constituent of smoke derived from the incomplete combustion of organic material, in smokers and non-smokers is less known. In this study, we show that insoluble nanoparticulate carbon black (nCB) accumulates in human myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs) from emphysematous lung and in CD11c<sup>+</sup> lung antigen presenting cells (APC) of mice exposed to smoke. Likewise, nCB intranasal administration induced emphysema in mouse lungs. Delivered by smoking or intranasally, nCB persisted indefinitely in mouse lung, activated lung APCs, and promoted T helper 17 cell differentiation through double-stranded DNA break (DSB) and ASC-mediated inflammasome assembly in phagocytes. Increasing the polarity or size of CB mitigated many adverse effects. Thus, nCB causes sterile inflammation, DSB, and emphysema and explains adverse health outcomes seen in smokers while implicating the dangers of nCB exposure in non-smokers."

The effect of carbon black (CB), a universal constituent of smoke derived from the incomplete combustion of organic material, in smokers and non-smokers is less known. In this study, we show that insoluble nanoparticulate carbon black (nCB) accumulates in human myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs) from emphysematous lung and in CD11c<sup>+</sup> lung antigen presenting cells (APC) of mice exposed to smoke. Likewise, nCB intranasal administration induced emphysema in mouse lungs. Delivered by smoking or intranasally, nCB persisted indefinitely in mouse lung, activated lung APCs, and promoted T helper 17 cell differentiation through double-stranded DNA break (DSB) and ASC-mediated inflammasome assembly in phagocytes. Increasing the polarity or size of CB mitigated many adverse effects. Thus, nCB causes sterile inflammation, DSB, and emphysema and explains adverse health outcomes seen in smokers while implicating the dangers of nCB exposure in non-smokers."

To determine whether nCB specifically induces Th17 responses in vivo, we first examined lung mDCs from nCB intranasal-challenged mice. Lung CD11c<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>hi</sup> mDCs were significantly increased in the lungs of nCB-challenged mice when compared with controls (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>). nCB also selectively induced lung Th17 but not Th1 responses relative to control animals (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,D</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Lung CD11c<sup>+</sup> APCs isolated from nCB-challenged mice secreted significantly more of the Th17 cell growth factors IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2, along with other pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, but not IL-12 or IL-4 (IL-4 was undetectable in both PBS and nCB groups), which promote Th1 and Th2 cell differentiation, respectively (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). To determine if lung APCs from nCB-challenged mice induce specific T cell differentiation programs in vitro, we co-cultured naive splenic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells with CD11c<sup>+</sup> cells isolated from lungs of nCB- or PBS-challenged mice. Lung APCs from nCB-challenged mice induced significantly more IL-17A, but neither IFN-\u03b3 nor IL-4 production, when compared to controls (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Lung Th17 responses persisted for at least 7 months following the last nCB challenge (<a href=\"#fig3s4\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). Further, <i>Il-17a</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mice were resistant to nCB challenge as assessed by their attenuated increases in lung volume, lung immune cell infiltration, and the reduced destruction of alveoli (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E\u2013H</a>) when compared to identically treated WT mice. Thus, in vivo nCB selectively induces chronic lung Th17 responses, which are crucial for CB-induced emphysema in mice."

We found that nCB did not affect Th1 or Th17 cell differentiation directly (<a href=\"#fig3s5\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 5A</a>). However, nCB treatment significantly inhibited Treg differentiation (<a href=\"#fig3s5\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 5A,B</a>).

To determine the mechanism of nCB-mediated lung pathology, we next investigated whether its physicochemical properties could account for its immunostimulatory function. Whether manufactured or found in the lungs of smokers with emphysema, nCB is very hydrophobic and completely insoluble in aqueous media. Conjugating polyethylene glycol to nCB (PEG-nCB) renders the material hydrophilic and miscible with aqueous solutions (<a href=\"#bib24\">Hwang et al., 2014</a>). Mice challenged with intranasal PEG-nCB using the same protocol (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) failed to develop emphysema as assessed by quantitative CT-based lung volume measurements, MLI and microscopic evaluation of the lungs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B,C</a>). Further, we detected less anthracotic pigment in the lung parenchyma, suggesting that in contrast to hydrophobic nCB, PEG-nCB could be cleared from the lungs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Microscopic inspection of isolated BAL fluid cells from PEG-nCB-challenged mice showed intact phagocytic cells compared to that of hydrophobic nCB, suggesting that the latter may induce less cytotoxic effects on phagocytic cells (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In support of this, we found that the release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), an indicator of cytotoxicity, was enhanced in macrophage-like RAW 264.7 cells exposed to nCB as compared to PEG-nCB (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

This reduction in inflammation was accompanied by reduced expression of <i>Mmp9</i> and <i>Mmp12</i> transcripts in BAL fluid cells as compared with nCB-challenged mice (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E,F</a>). The markedly reduced inflammatory nature of PEG-nCB was further underscored by the reduced concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines detected from freshly collected lung homogenates of PEG-nCB-challenged mice (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), including decreased IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2 levels (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G,H</a>). Critically, PEG-nCB failed to induce lung Th17 cells when compared to nCB-exposed animals (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4I,J</a>).

In response to nCB, but not PEG-nCB, reverse phase protein array (RPPA) identified the activation of several DNA damage (e.g., PARP, p-Chk2, p-ATM) and MAPK/Erk (p-ERK, p-MEK1/2)-response proteins (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Consistent with these data, we found that nCB, but not PEG-nCB, induced DNA double strand breaks (DSB) as determined by phosphorylation of Histone 2AX (H2AX) on serine 129 (\u03b3H2AX) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,C</a>). Further, the induction of DSB was inversely dependent on the size of nCB as we observed progressively fewer DSB with increasing nCB size (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). We next examined whether CB-induced DSB could account for the pro-inflammatory responses seen in APC. Human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDCs) treated with Nu7026, an inhibitor of the DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (<a href=\"#bib51\">Wilmore et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Zhou et al., 2014</a>), exhibited reduced IL-6 production in a dose-dependent manner in response to nCB but not LPS (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>).

As expected, mDCs isolated from nCB-challenged mice promoted Th17 cell differentiation, which was significantly reduced in response to Nu7026 or Ku55933 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>) while Th1 and Th2 cell differentiation remained unchanged (<a href=\"#fig5s4\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). Together, these findings suggest that nCB-mediated DNA damage is required for the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines in mDCs and Th17 cell differentiation. Moreover, nCB exposure in a dose- and time-dependent way increased phosphorylation of Erk (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>), and similar inhibition of MEK1/2 with U0126, an inhibitor of MAP kinases (<a href=\"#bib34\">Newton et al., 2000</a>), reduced IL-6 production in response to nCB exposure (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>).

In response to nCB exposure, lung CD11c<sup>+</sup> mDCs increased IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2 expression and RAW 264.7 cells released more LDH, consistent with the concept that nCB induces both sterile inflammation and necrotic cell death. To determine if ASC is also required for nCB-induced Th17 responses and emphysema, <i>Pycard</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mice were challenged intranasally with nCB. When compared to WT mice treated identically, <i>Pycard</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mice showed attenuated emphysema (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A\u2013C</a>) and reduced macrophage, neutrophil, lymphocyte, and mDC infiltration into the lungs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D,E</a>).

A characteristic feature of the anthracotic pigment of smokers' lungs is that such discoloration persists even long after smoking has ceased (<a href=\"#bib10\">Churg et al., 2005</a>). In this study, we addressed the role of insoluble anthracotic pigment that is universally found in the lungs of smokers with emphysema in driving this pathological response. Although several chemical identities have been proposed, our study is the first to clearly identify the anthracotic pigment as nCB and show that it accumulates specifically in human lung phagocytic cells. Our functional studies are also the first to show that nCB administered to the lungs in pathophysiologically relevant amounts can induce sterile inflammation and emphysema that is indistinguishable from disease induced by exposure to cigarette smoke in mice. Thus, nCB is likely the major component of smoke that causes long-term lung toxicity. Furthermore, our findings have major implications regarding the safety of activities involving the chronic inhalation of smoke and the need to control the particulate composition of air. Since nCB is used extensively in the rubber, plastics, and composites industries, the exposure levels should also be controlled in the workplace."

Both chronic exposure to cigarette smoke and inhalation of nCB mediate similar inflammatory responses that are characterized by the activation of lung mDCs, differentiation and accumulation of Th17 cells, and lung parenchymal destruction (emphysema) (<a href=\"#bib46\">Shan et al., 2014</a>). In part, this sterile inflammatory response to nCB is due to activation of the inflammasome pathway. Specifically, we found that inhaled nCB induces the production of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6, two pro-inflammatory cytokines that are required for mDC-mediated differentiation of Th17 cells and emphysema development. This inflammation persists and lung damage continues to accumulate even after smoking cessation due to the insoluble nature of nCB. Although readily taken up by phagocytic lung cells that could theoretically be expectorated or migrate out of the lungs via the lymphatics (<a href=\"#bib13\">Corry et al., 1984</a>), these cells most likely undergo cell death too rapidly in response to nCB ingestion for any of these potential clearance mechanisms to operate efficiently. The nCB is then released in the lung by the cells it kills, only to be taken up again and kill subsequent phagocytes. nCB thus establishes an unending cycle of cell death that, if sufficiently pronounced, will trigger activation of the inflammasome pathway in response to the release of danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) from dying cells (<a href=\"#bib37\">Piccinini and Midwood, 2010</a>). Immune responses both rapidly kill invading pathogens and solubilize antigenic and adjuvant-like pathogen-derived substances to facilitate their removal and thus terminate the potentially deleterious inflammation. Both of these fundamental immune functions are thwarted in the context of nCB accumulation, leading to a perpetual cycle of lung inflammation and damage."

In support of this, inflammasome-activated IL-1\u03b2 has been shown to play a major role in lung sterile inflammation induced by other nanoparticles associated with lung diseases (<a href=\"#bib32\">Merget et al., 2002</a>). ASC is required for the assembly of pro-caspase 1 in order to yield caspase 1 for the activation of pro-IL-1\u03b2 to IL-1\u03b2 (<a href=\"#bib18\">Franchi and Nunez, 2012</a>). We show that inhaled nCB can activate the inflammasome pathway that results in production of mature IL-1\u03b2. In addition, inflammasome sensors activated by nCB-damaged cells require ASC activation because lung mDCs isolated from <i>Pycard</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mice failed to increase IL-1\u03b2 and showed attenuated Th17 responses. A critically important physical feature of nCB, accounting in large part for its pro-inflammatory potential, is its hydrophobic character. Exposure to large quantities of hydrophobic nCB has been shown to induce cell injury, pyroptosis and generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cultured cells (<a href=\"#bib40\">Reisetter et al., 2011</a>). One particular characteristic of nCB that correlates with its toxicity is its large surface area; larger forms of elemental carbon have much less potential to induce cell injury (<a href=\"#bib35\">Oberd\u00f6rster et al., 2005</a>) and, as we have shown here, damage DNA."

For our studies, we used nCB spheroids with a nominal size of 15 nm that aggregate in clusters of 3\u20134, forming 50\u201375 nm per particle. However, in aqueous solution, this material forms macro-aggregates that fail to distribute evenly in the lung after intranasal challenge as does nCB delivered by smoke inhalation. We were partially successful in alleviating this confounding factor by adding sucrose to the nCB in aqueous solution. Nonetheless, although we endeavored to deliver nCB to mice in amounts that matched actual burdens found in human lung, it is likely that we did not fully recapitulate the in vivo particle size and distribution of nCB acquired through smoke inhalation. Further studies are required to define how nCB size affects in vivo toxicity as defined in these studies."

A critical question related to our studies is, therefore, which form of carbon, BC or CB, is deposited in the lung during smoking, and how much do PAHs contribute to smoking-related lung inflammation. The nCB used in our studies lacked detectable PAHs by gas chromatography mass spectrometry analysis, which has a sensitivity limit of 1 part in 10<sup>10</sup> by mass. While PAHs are present in soot and diesel exhaust particles (<a href=\"#bib20\">Garza et al., 2008</a>), neither Raman spectroscopy nor hyperspectral imaging can distinguish CB from BC as could be found in human lungs. However, X-ray analysis of the melting of small metal particles has revealed the temperature distribution inside a burning cigarette as 850\u2013920\u00b0C during active inhalation, decreasing to 700\u00b0C during the smoldering phase; this temperature regime is consistent with the creation of predominant CB during smoking (<a href=\"#bib5\">Baker, 1974</a>). Moreover, as PAH-free CB recapitulates almost entirely the pathology induced by smoke exposure, we conclude that sterile inflammation and pulmonary emphysema are primarily the result of CB accumulation in the lung and not that of BC or PAHs therein during smoking."

The most notable, and unexpected, result of our RPPA analysis was the upregulation of several DNA damage enzymes by nCB exposure. This led us to confirm that nano-sized CB induces DSB in DNA as detected by the expression of \u03b3H2AX, an ATM-regulated pathway. We show that larger forms of CB result in attenuation of DSB, indicating that the size of CB is an important factor in its genotoxicity. Activation of this DNA repair pathway is in turn linked to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2 that are required for Th17 differentiation. In addition, microRNA-22 (miR-22) has been shown to be upregulated in lung APC of mice exposed to smoke or nCB and is critical in Th17 responses through activation of AP-1 complexes and histone deacetylase (HDAC) 4 (<a href=\"#bib29\">Lu et al., 2015</a>). Thus, together with DAMPs released by cells killed by nCB, nCB-induced DNA damage accounts for much of the inflammatory nature of nCB. The mechanism by which nCB cleaves DNA and the additional biological consequences of this adverse property remain active areas of investigation in our laboratory."

Carboxyl-functionalized nCB (2 mmol) was dispersed in dimethylformamide for 30 min, then mixed with <i>N</i>,<i>N</i>\u2032-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (0.8 mmol), mPEG-NH<sub>2</sub> (0.04 mmol), and dimethylaminopyridine (2 flakes). The reaction was stirred for 24 hr, transferred to a dialysis bag (molecular weight cut-off, 5.0 kDa), dialyzed in running deionized water for 1 week, and filtered through a 0.22-\u00b5m pore Teflon membrane. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy performed on an a PHI Quantera SXM scanning X-ray microprobe with 26 eV passing energy, 45\u00b0 takeoff angle, and a 100-\u03bcm beam size. Thermogravimetric analysis performed on a TA Instruments Q-600 Simultaneous TGA/DSC. FTIR spectra were recorded using a Nicolet FTIR with an ATR attachment. By TGA, PEG-nCB contains 42\u201350% PEG by mass. By X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, the PEG-nCB surface is 15% carbon, 56% oxidized carbon, 1.2% nitrogen, and 28% oxygen.

The authors show that nCB accumulates in myeloid dendritic cells in lungs from emphysema patients and also in antigen presenting cells (APC) in a smoking mouse model of emphysema. Like cigarette smoke, nCB administration into the always induced emphysema in mice and such nCB persisted indefinitely in mouse lungs. nCB apparently causes disease by activating lung APC which promote Th17 helper cell differentiation via double stranded DNA break and ASC-mediated inflammasome assembly in phagocytes. The adverse effects of nCB can be negated by increasing particulate size or decreasing hydrophobicity."

Furthermore, the authors work out the molecular as well as cellular mechanisms of nCB's toxic effects. Lastly, the authors suggest ways by which nCB toxicity can be mitigated. Experimentally the study is a tour-de-force of state-of-the-art technologies that have yielded very convincing results. These in turn have provided a paradigm shift in our understanding of a key environmental pollutant."

This change in lung volume (% emphysema) is statistically significant, and is slightly greater than exposure to 4 months of cigarette smoke in the same strain of mice (<a href=\"#bib45\">Shan et al. 2012</a>). These findings couldn\u2019t be directly compared to smoke-induced lung disease in humans, nevertheless lung destruction at 20-30% is strongly associated with end-stage emphysema in smokers (Coxson et al. 2013, Hesselbacher et al. 2011). Further, in this report, as well as in prior publications, we show lung volume data in such a way to minimize the blank space in the figures (Shan 2014 et al., Yuan et al. 2015). Changing this parameter will result in inclusion of a larger area of space in each figure (<a href=\"#fig7\">Author response image 1</a>). Therefore, to keep the figure flow consistent, we used the zero suppression; however if our reviewers feel that leaving blank spaces in the figures is necessary, we would revise all 8 panels accordingly."

                    "text": "We appreciate the referees\u2019 suggestion to confirm our findings using <i>Nlrp3</i> knockout mice. Interestingly, although NLRP3 is the most studied inflammasome in relation to danger signals, other molecules (e.g. AIM2), have been shown to recognize cytosolic dsDNA (Cavlar, Ablasser and Hornung 2012, Hornung et al. 2009, Hornung and Latz 2010). Because ASC is critical in the inflammasome-mediated IL-1\u03b2 activation pathway, we opted to examine the general role of inflammasome using <i>ASC</i><sup><i>-/-</i></sup> mice and these mice became available to us through the generosity of Dr. Vishva Dixit (Genentech). Furthermore, at the time of our initial investigation <i>Nlrp3</i><sup><i>-/-</i></sup> mice were not commercially available. These mice have recently become available for purchase from the Jackson laboratory ($205.9/mouse priced in 8-2015), but we were informed that an order of 10 mice could only be shipped within approximately 2-3 months after the purchase. Because our nCB experimental protocol requires an additional of 2-3 months to complete and be analyzed (i.e., a total of six months delay) we believe that the excessive time required to fully address a confirmatory role for NLRP3 would be beyond the 2-month timeline provided to us for revision of the current manuscript. Therefore, while we agree with the need for future studies, we would like to ask the referees to allow this new work to be deferred to future studies."
