However, these responses come at a high metabolic price (<a href=\"#bib1\">McKean and Lazzaro, 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib3\">Kominsky et al., 2010</a>), and avoiding pathogens before infection may be advantageous. The bacterial endotoxins lipopolysaccharides (LPS) are important immune system infection cues (<a href=\"#bib2\">Abbas et al., 2014</a>), but it remains unknown whether animals possess sensory mechanisms to detect them prior to infection. Here we show that <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> display strong aversive responses to LPS and that gustatory neurons expressing Gr66a bitter receptors mediate avoidance of LPS in feeding and egg laying assays. We found the expression of the chemosensory cation channel dTRPA1 in these cells to be necessary and sufficient for LPS avoidance. Furthermore, LPS stimulates <i>Drosophila</i> neurons in a TRPA1-dependent manner and activates exogenous dTRPA1 channels in human cells. Our findings demonstrate that flies detect bacterial endotoxins via a gustatory pathway through TRPA1 activation as conserved molecular mechanism."

However, these responses come at a high metabolic price (<a href=\"#bib1\">McKean and Lazzaro, 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib3\">Kominsky et al., 2010</a>), and avoiding pathogens before infection may be advantageous. The bacterial endotoxins lipopolysaccharides (LPS) are important immune system infection cues (<a href=\"#bib2\">Abbas et al., 2014</a>), but it remains unknown whether animals possess sensory mechanisms to detect them prior to infection. Here we show that <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> display strong aversive responses to LPS and that gustatory neurons expressing Gr66a bitter receptors mediate avoidance of LPS in feeding and egg laying assays. We found the expression of the chemosensory cation channel dTRPA1 in these cells to be necessary and sufficient for LPS avoidance. Furthermore, LPS stimulates <i>Drosophila</i> neurons in a TRPA1-dependent manner and activates exogenous dTRPA1 channels in human cells. Our findings demonstrate that flies detect bacterial endotoxins via a gustatory pathway through TRPA1 activation as conserved molecular mechanism."

However, mounting an immune response to a bacterial infection requires a lot of energy. It also can be potentially dangerous if the immune system becomes too active. Therefore, avoiding bacteria and not getting infected to begin with may be a better strategy to stay healthy. Fruit flies, like humans, can detect dangerous substances in the environment via their sense of smell, but it is not known whether they also detect disease-causing organisms through their sense of taste."

Previous studies have found that when flies get in contact with LPS they begin cleaning themselves, which might help prevent infection. However it was not clear how the flies actually detected the LPS. Now, Soldano et al. show that fruit flies can taste LPS and avoid eating or laying eggs on food contaminated with LPS and bacteria. A series of experiments showed that when a fly tastes LPS it stimulates bitter-sensing neurons in the fly\u2019s mouth and throat. The experiments also revealed that the protein that activates these neurons in response to LPS is the same protein that acts in humans as detector of pungent chemicals contained in ordinary food items like mustard, garlic and wasabi. This suggests this protein, called TRPA1, is part of a key survival mechanism that has been preserved in many species throughout evolution."

This is particularly important to flies, because unlike humans they don\u2019t develop resistance to future infections with the same bacteria. Future studies are needed to determine if flies use their sense of taste to detect other chemicals that are signs of infections. Additionally, studies are needed to determine if the activated bitter-sensing nerves alert the fly\u2019s immune system to a potential infection."

In particular, there is evidence that sensory neurons can directly detect bacterial components as potentially damaging stimuli, and initiate acute inflammatory and nocifensive responses (<a href=\"#bib4\">Chiu et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Meseguer et al., 2014</a>). It has been shown that the Gram-negative bacterial wall component LPS induces hygienic grooming in <i>Drosophila</i>, an important behavioral defense against pathogens, via contact chemosensation (<a href=\"#bib27\">Yanagawa et al., 2014</a>). Thus, LPS may represent important sensory cues of food contamination with Gram-negative bacteria. To test whether LPS can be perceived by flies during food ingestion we used a binary food choice assay (<a href=\"#bib9\">Isono and Morita, 2010</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). We found that control flies displayed significant avoidance towards food supplemented with LPS (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Because LPS is non-volatile we determined if this avoidance is mediated by gustatory neurons known to detect aversive compounds (Gr66a) (<a href=\"#bib16\">Marella et al., 2006</a>). Blocking neurotransmission in these neurons by expressing the light chain of tetanus toxin (TNT) abolished avoidance of LPS (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), indicating that flies can detect LPS through a gustatory mechanism."

To test whether avoidance of LPS is mediated by labellar or esophageal chemosensors we performed a proboscis extension reflex (PER) assay in wild type animals. LPS did not inhibit PER (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), suggesting that avoidance of LPS is not mediated by the labellar neurons, but by the gustatory neurons of the esophagus. We attempted to record neuronal responses in these neurons using flies expressing the genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator GCaMP6m in <i>Gr66a</i> neurons but Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging access to these neurons proved impossible in our assays. Next, we attempted direct brain stimulation. All preparations (5/5) responded robustly to the application of the dTRPA1 agonist allyl isothiocyanate (AITC) or the classical bitter compound caffeine, indicating that they were healthy. However, application of LPS gave varying results (small responses in 40% (2/5) of the flies; data not shown) precluding definitive conclusions. Therefore, in order to further test whether dTRPA1 mediates responses to LPS in vivo we monitored intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics in the ventral nerve cord of larvae, a preparation that allows better accessibility of chemical stimuli. Application of LPS or the dTRPA1 agonist allyl isothiocyanate (AITC) induced robust Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses, effects that were strongly reduced by incubation with the TRPA1 inhibitor HC030031 (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

                        "text": "To test the role of TRPA1 in neuronal responses to LPS at the cellular level we examined primary cultures of larva brain neurons (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>, <a href=\"#bib8\">Harzer et al., 2013</a>) expressing the Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator GCaMP5 under the control of <i>dTrpA1Gal4</i>. LPS (30 \u00b5g/ml) reversibly stimulated more than 40% of neurons isolated from control larvae (122/289), and 80% of these were also activated by the dTRPA1 agonist N-ethyl maleimide (NEM, 300 \u00b5M) (<a href=\"#bib13\">Kim and Cavanaugh, 2007</a>) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>). Notably, the proportion of neurons responding to both agents was strongly reduced in cultures derived from <i>dTrpA1<sup>1</sup></i> null animals (20/153, P\u00a0&lt;\u00a010<sup>\u20134</sup>, Fisher exact test), as well as by pharmacological inhibition of dTRPA1 with HC030031 in neurons isolated from control animals (4/32, P\u00a0&lt;\u00a010<sup>\u20133</sup>, Fisher exact test). Intriguingly, the responses to LPS or NEM were not fully abolished by genetic or pharmacological ablation of dTRPA1. This suggests that dTRPA1 mediates some, though not all, Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses of larva brain neurons to these compounds. To verify this indication in other experimental settings we evaluated the responses of cells isolated from brains of wild type larvae using the ratiometric Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator Fura2, and AITC as reference TRPA1 agonist. Application of LPS (60 \u00b5g/ml) reversibly stimulated more than 70% (39/54) of neurons isolated from control larvae (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3A,E,F</a>). A large proportion of LPS-sensitive neurons (23/39, 59%) were also activated by 100 \u00b5M AITC (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3A,E</a>), which indicates that LPS stimulates cells functionally expressing dTRPA1 channels. No Ca<sup>2+</sup> response was observed when LPS was applied in the absence of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (0/14, P\u00a0&lt;\u00a010<sup>\u20134</sup>, Fisher exact test; <a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3B,E,F</a>). This indicates that LPS-induced responses result from Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through channels in the plasma membrane, rather than from release from intracellular stores. To directly assess whether LPS induces neuronal responses through the activation of dTRPA1, we tested its effects on wild type neurons in the presence of HC030031 (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3C</a>). In these experiments, LPS-induced responses were significantly less frequent (9/32, 28%, P\u00a0&lt;\u00a010<sup>\u20133</sup>, Fisher exact test, <a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3E</a>) and smaller in amplitude (P\u00a0&lt;\u00a010<sup>\u20133</sup>, Mann-Whitney U test, <a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3F</a>) than in control experiments. To confirm these data genetically, we tested the effects of LPS on neurons isolated from <i>dTrpA1</i>-null larvae. These cells responded to LPS with significantly lower frequency (5/23, 22%, P\u00a0&lt;\u00a010<sup>\u20134</sup>, Fisher exact test, <a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3D,E</a>) and amplitude (P\u00a0&lt;\u00a010<sup>\u20134</sup>, Mann-Whitney U test, <a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3F</a>) than control neurons. Importantly, the subpopulation of neurons responsive to both LPS and AITC in cultures from control larvae was absent in cultures from <i>dTrpA1</i>-null animals (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3E</a>). Taken together, these data indicate that dTRPA1 channels expressed in the plasma membrane mediate at least part of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx triggered by stimulation with in <i>Drosophila</i> neurons. Interestingly, as for the experiments with NEM, neither the LPS- nor the AITC-induced responses were fully absent in <i>TrpA1</i>-null neurons. This demonstrates that receptors other than TRPA1 may be also sensitive to these compounds in cultured brain neurons. This is in line with previous reports showing that sensory neurons isolated from <i>Trpa1</i> knockout mice showed reduced, but not completely abrogated responses to LPS (<a href=\"#bib19\">Meseguer et al., 2014</a>), and that TRPA1 is not the only target of electrophilic compounds in sensory neurons (<a href=\"#bib2\">Alpizar et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Everaerts et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Gees et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Ohta et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Salazar et al., 2008</a>). Here it is important to note that we used the larval fillet preparation and the neuron cultures as experimental models for native functional expression of dTRPA1."

We found that 60 \u00b5g/ml LPS induced only very few responses in non-transfected cells (7/110), but stimulated a significantly larger fraction of cells transiently transfected with dTRPA1-A (42/74, P\u00a0&lt;\u00a010<sup>\u20134</sup>, Fisher exact test) or dTRPA1-B (14/67, P\u00a0=\u00a00.007, Fisher exact test) (<a href=\"#fig4s4\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). These responses were more variable in amplitude and less frequent than those triggered by AITC, indicating that LPS is a relatively weak agonist of dTRPA1 channels (<a href=\"#bib3\">Alpizar et al., 2013)</a>. Further evidence for dTRPA1 activation by LPS was obtained in whole-cell patch-clamp experiments, in which application of LPS significantly enhanced both outward and inward currents in dTRPA1-A transfected HEK293T cells, but not control cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,D</a>). Application of HC030031 reduced the amplitude of currents recorded in the presence of LPS (35 \u00b1 4% at -75 mV, n = 6, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>), further confirming the TRPA1-dependence of these responses. Previous results suggest that LPS activates mouse TRPA1 channels by inducing mechanical perturbations in the plasma membrane upon insertion of the lipophilic moiety of the molecule (<a href=\"#bib19\">Meseguer et al., 2014</a>). It is conceivable that LPS activates dTRPA1 channels via the same mechanism, but additional experiments are required to verify this."

The avoidance of LPS-contaminated food during feeding and oviposition may serve to prevent Gram-negative bacterial infections, potentially compensating for the lack of adaptive immunity in these animals. The fact that this sensory mechanism exploits dTRPA1 suggests a broadly conserved principle whereby these channels play a crucial role in LPS detection by sensory neurons in flies and mammals, regardless of the particular sensory modality involved. Our findings, together with previous evidence of an olfactory-based detection of secondary metabolites of Gram-positive bacteria (<a href=\"#bib24\">Stensmyr et al., 2012</a>), underscore the need to consider the function of the sensory nervous system as a crucial part of a broad mechanistic understanding of pathogen-host interactions."

Briefly, larvae were immobilized using pins and stretched out lengthwise in a dish coated with silica and filled with a HL3 solution containing (in mM): 70 NaCl, 5 KCl, 20 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 5 trehalose, 115 sucrose and 5 HEPES (pH 7.3). The larval skin was cut vertically along the dorsal midline towards the rostral end of the larva using spring scissors. At the rostrum of the animal horizontal incisions were made to the left and right. This created a left and a right flap in the body wall. These flaps were then pulled and pinned on the side of the larva to better expose the brain. The organs were removed with forceps and the preparation was immediately used for imaging."

We are persuaded that the neurons involved in the LPS detection are the ones present in the pharynx, where they detect potentially harmful substances upon food ingestion, before reaching the digestive tract. This is strongly supported by the fact that LPS is avoided by flies when examined with a two-choice assay, but does <i>not</i> inhibit the proboscis extension reflex (new <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Together, these data strongly support the involvement of internal sensory neurons in the detection of LPS rather than labial sensory neurons. It was not possible to perform electrophysiological recordings because this technique allows only recording from external sensory neurons that are easily accessible (Benton and Dahanukar Cold Spring Harbor protocols 2011, 2011:839-850). To our knowledge there reports of recordings performed from internal sensory neurons. Similarly, we did not find any example in the literature of Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging used to monitor the responses of pharyngeal GRNs. However, performing intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging in a perfusion system allowed us to analyze the responses of the neuronal terminals in the sub-esophageal ganglion (SOG) upon stimulation of the gustatory nerves and the neuronal terminals themselves, therefore overcoming the accessibility issue."

We visualized the projections of bitter-sensing neurons in the SOG by opening a window on the fly head cuticles and submerging the fly head into AHL solution (Marella et al., Neuron 2006, 49:285-295). We analyzed <i>Gr66aGal4:UAS-GCaMP6m</i> flies and used caffeine as a positive control for bitter-sensing gustatory neuron activation (Marella et al., Neuron 2006, 49:285-295) and allyl isothiocyanate (AITC) as a control for dTRPA1 activation. As shown in the new <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, we found that application of LPS induces neuronal activation. Not surprisingly, the responses were variable in amplitude and duration, and we could not observe them in all analyzed brains. We are convinced that this was not due to technical issues because all samples responded robustly and consistently to caffeine and AITC. We believe that the variability of the responses to LPS is due to the intrinsic nature of the molecule itself. LPS, is a very large molecule consisting of a lipophilic moiety (lipid A), a polysaccharide core, and a highly variable O-polysaccharide. Therefore, LPS may not diffuse well through the tissue, in contrast to classic tastants such as caffeine. In the experiments we performed LPS was applied to an in vivo preparation where it has to access the projection of bitter-sensing neurons that are located in a deep part of the preparation. Moreover, as shown in the Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging experiment in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, LPS induces a specific but rather mild activation of <i>dTrpA1</i>-expressing neurons."
