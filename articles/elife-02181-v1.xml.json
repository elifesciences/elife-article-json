As mitosis inhibits not only transcription, but also pre-mRNA splicing, we reasoned that constraints on splicing were likely to exist in the early embryo, being splicing avoidance a possible explanation why most early zygotic genes are intronless. We isolated two mutant alleles for a subunit of the NTC/Prp19 complexes, which specifically impaired pre-mRNA splicing of early zygotic but not maternally encoded transcripts. We hypothesized that the requirements for pre-mRNA splicing efficiency were likely to vary during development. Ectopic maternal expression of an early zygotic pre-mRNA was sufficient to suppress its splicing defects in the mutant background. Furthermore, a small early zygotic transcript with multiple introns was poorly spliced in wild-type embryos. Our findings demonstrate for the first time the existence of a developmental pre-requisite for highly efficient splicing during <i>Drosophila</i> early embryonic development and suggest in highly proliferative tissues a need for coordination between cell cycle and gene architecture to ensure correct gene expression and avoid abnormally processed transcripts."

Protein extracts from embryos and ovaries not expressing the Myc-tagged proteins were used as negative controls (\u2212). Two replica experiments were performed for each condition. Proteins were identified by LC-MS-MS and data were blasted against the Flybase database using Mascot Search (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 for detail). The presence of a protein was measured from the total number of peptides (Matches), the number of non-repeated sequence peptides (Sequences) and the respective Score according to Mascot Search. Predictions of Human protein orthologous from <i>Drosophila</i> proteins were made using DIOPT (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 for detail). Proteins were grouped in NTC/Prp19-related complex (light gray), NTC/Prp19 complex (dark gray), general spliceosomal related proteins, miscellaneous, and ribosomal proteins. Non-reproducible (only 1 peptide in one replica) and non-specific proteins (more than 1 peptide in negative controls [\u2212]) are listed separately. (*) Spliceosomal proteins in non-reproducible table, (**) NTC/Prp19 complex or NTC/Prp19-related complex subunits present in non-reproducible and non-specific tables."

As mitosis inhibits not only transcription, but also pre-mRNA splicing, we reasoned that constraints on splicing were likely to exist in the early embryo, being splicing avoidance a possible explanation why most early zygotic genes are intronless. We isolated two mutant alleles for a subunit of the NTC/Prp19 complexes, which specifically impaired pre-mRNA splicing of early zygotic but not maternally encoded transcripts. We hypothesized that the requirements for pre-mRNA splicing efficiency were likely to vary during development. Ectopic maternal expression of an early zygotic pre-mRNA was sufficient to suppress its splicing defects in the mutant background. Furthermore, a small early zygotic transcript with multiple introns was poorly spliced in wild-type embryos. Our findings demonstrate for the first time the existence of a developmental pre-requisite for highly efficient splicing during <i>Drosophila</i> early embryonic development and suggest in highly proliferative tissues a need for coordination between cell cycle and gene architecture to ensure correct gene expression and avoid abnormally processed transcripts."

Protein extracts from embryos and ovaries not expressing the Myc-tagged proteins were used as negative controls (\u2212). Two replica experiments were performed for each condition. Proteins were identified by LC-MS-MS and data were blasted against the Flybase database using Mascot Search (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 for detail). The presence of a protein was measured from the total number of peptides (Matches), the number of non-repeated sequence peptides (Sequences) and the respective Score according to Mascot Search. Predictions of Human protein orthologous from <i>Drosophila</i> proteins were made using DIOPT (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 for detail). Proteins were grouped in NTC/Prp19-related complex (light gray), NTC/Prp19 complex (dark gray), general spliceosomal related proteins, miscellaneous, and ribosomal proteins. Non-reproducible (only 1 peptide in one replica) and non-specific proteins (more than 1 peptide in negative controls [\u2212]) are listed separately. (*) Spliceosomal proteins in non-reproducible table, (**) NTC/Prp19 complex or NTC/Prp19-related complex subunits present in non-reproducible and non-specific tables."

Researchers regularly use a type of fruit fly called <i>Drosophila</i> to study development because it is small, it has a short lifespan, and its whole genome sequence is already known. The development of a <i>Drosophila</i> embryo starts with the nucleus of the fertilized egg, which contains most of the cell\u2019s genetic material, dividing 13 times in quick succession, without the cell itself splitting. These divisions are amongst the fastest known for any animal, and given the fast developmental speed, the embryo must efficiently express all genes it needs to stay alive. Because cell division is known to inhibit gene expression this raises an interesting conundrum about the way fast cell proliferation and gene expression are coordinated."

After fertilization, as nuclei enter interphase 14, the maternal to zygotic transition (MZT) occurs in which the soma suddenly becomes transcriptionally active and many of the maternally encoded gene products are rapidly degraded (<a href=\"#bib3\">Anderson and Lengyel, 1979</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">McKnight and Miller, 1976</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Yasuda et al., 1991</a>). While the major burst of zygotic transcription occurs once the nuclei arrest in interphase 14, there is an initial wave of zygotic gene expression during the syncytial nuclear divisions 8\u201313 (<a href=\"#bib33\">Pritchard and Schubiger, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">ten Bosch et al., 2006</a>). Due to the extreme speed of syncytial nuclear divisions, a limitation to the size of early zygotic transcriptional units has been suggested (<a href=\"#bib28\">McKnight and Miller, 1976</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Rothe et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Shermoen and O\u2019Farrell, 1991</a>). Consistently, approximately 70% of early zygotic genes are small in size and intronless (<a href=\"#bib15\">De Renzis et al., 2007</a>). As only 20% of <i>Drosophila</i> genes are intronless, it has been proposed that small intronless genes have an important selective advantage for transcription during the syncytial blastoderm formation (<a href=\"#bib15\">De Renzis et al., 2007</a>)."

As most early zygotic transcripts are intronless (<a href=\"#bib15\">De Renzis et al., 2007</a>), syncytial blastoderm interphases can be as short as 4 to 5 min, and given the fact that mitosis inhibits splicing (<a href=\"#bib38\">Shin and Manley, 2002</a>), we hypothesized that further to the selective pressure for small transcriptional units, there is also a pressure to avoid pre-mRNA splicing during early zygotic expression. We isolated two mutant alleles for a subunit of the NTC/Prp19 complexes, known to be important for efficient spliceosome activation, which specifically impaired pre-mRNA splicing of early zygotic but not maternally encoded transcripts. We showed that the differential splicing defects were not related to any particular structure/sequence of the early zygotic transcripts or differential association of spliceosomal components to the NTC/Prp19 complexes. Ectopic maternal expression of an early zygotic transcript in a mutant background was sufficient to suppress its splicing defects, suggesting that they were dependent on the developmental context of gene expression. We reasoned that constraints on pre-mRNA splicing are present during <i>Drosophila</i> early embryonic development. Consistently, a small early zygotic transcript with four introns was poorly spliced in wild-type embryos. Such constraints on pre-mRNA splicing are a likely explanation why most early zygotic genes are intronless and suggest that highly proliferative tissues need coordination between cell cycle and gene architecture for correct gene expression and avoidance of abnormally processed transcripts. Our results strongly argue in favor of a developmental pre-requisite for highly efficient splicing during fast development, therefore we propose that the requirement for overall splicing efficiency is likely to vary during development."

Through deficiency mapping and a candidate gene approach we concluded that both were allelic to the uncharacterized coding gene CG6197 (Flybase). To confirm the mutants\u2019 identity, we rescued their zygotic lethality, female sterility (germ-line clones), and blastoderm cellularization defects (maternal mutant embryos) using a genomic fragment construct that contained a wild-type copy of CG6197 (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>, data not shown). Both isolated alleles of CG6197 showed identical phenotypes: maternal mutant embryos (hereafter referred to as mutant embryos) showed normal syncytial nuclear divisions (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>) but subsequently failed to elongate the cortical nuclei, which became mislocalized during blastoderm cellularization (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C\u2013F</a>, quantification in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>).

Mutant clonal analysis of a stronger allele of <i>fandango</i> (nonsense mutation), showed a complete loss of the female germ line in adult ovaries (data not shown). This demonstrated that the two isolated alleles of <i>fandango</i> are hypomorphic and suggested that Fandango was required, albeit at lower levels, for splicing of maternal transcripts. We concluded it is unlikely that a differential expression and/or association of core components of the spliceosome could potentially explain the differential requirements for Fandango between oogenesis and the early embryo. The most likely explanation is that Fandango is quantitatively (but not qualitatively) differentially required during early embryonic development."

Interestingly, the authors describe a differential requirement for the NTC/Prp19 components in the splicing of transcripts from maternally versus early zygotically expressed genes in the Drosophila embryo. The pre-mRNA splicing defects detected in these mutants correlate with zygotic gene expression and the rapid mitoses characteristic of cell division in early Drosophila embryos. These observations are interesting in light of two related findings. First, that mitosis inhibits pre-mRNA splicing in organisms that undergo nuclear membrane breakdown. Second, in yeast intron size is small and most genes lack introns suggesting that the genomes of rapidly dividing cells were selected for intron loss."

Do they accumulate in the nucleus for later splicing or are they degraded by nuclear quality control (NQC) mechanisms. Another interesting question is how splicing efficiency adapts to cell cycle duration, and how a given transcript is processed in highly and non-proliferating cells."
