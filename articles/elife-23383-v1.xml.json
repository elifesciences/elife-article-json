In another sense, the answer is difficult. What does it mean to repeat the methodology? And what qualifies as the \"same\" results? Now that the first five Replication Studies in the <a href=\"https://osf.io/e81xl/wiki/home/\">Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology</a> have been published (see <a href=\"#B1\">Box 1</a>), it is timely to explore how we might answer these questions. The results of the first set of Replication Studies are mixed, and while it is too early to draw any conclusions, it is clear that assessing reproducibility in cancer biology is going to be as\u00a0complex as it was in a similar project in psychology (<a href=\"#bib9\">Open Science Collaboration, 2015</a>)."

In a direct replication, protocols from the original study are followed with different samples of the same or similar materials: as such, a direct replication reflects the current beliefs about what is needed to produce a finding. Conducting a direct replication tests those beliefs empirically. In a conceptual replication, on the other hand, a different methodology (such as a different experimental technique or a different model of a disease) is used to test the same hypothesis: as such, by employing multiple methodologies conceptual replications can provide evidence that enables researchers to converge on an explanation for a finding that is not dependent on any one methodology."

But, on its own, reproducibility does not guarantee validity. For example, the methodology that was repeated could have confounds, or the theoretical explanation for why the finding occurred could simply be wrong. By providing convergent evidence across methodologies, conceptual replication can foster confidence in the explanation for a finding but such evidence, on its own, does not guarantee the reproducibility of any individual piece of evidence. For example, individual findings could have occurred by chance. Together, direct and conceptual replication provides confidence in the reproducibility of a finding and the explanation for the finding."

Indeed, a failed replication can lead to a better understanding of a phenomenon if it results in the generation of new hypotheses to explain how the original and replication methodologies produced different results and, critically, leads to follow-up experiments to test these hypotheses (<a href=\"#bib4\">Ebersole et al., 2017</a>)."

Errors can also be caused by the improper execution of an experimental technique or by problems with samples and materials (such as the contamination of cell lines; <a href=\"#bib10\">Peterson, 2008</a>).

The Registered Report details the experimental designs and protocols that will be used for the replications, and experiments cannot begin until this report has been peer reviewed and accepted for publication. The results of the experiments are then published as a Replication Study, irrespective of outcome but subject to peer review to check that the experimental designs and protocols were followed. Finally, all methods, proposed analyses and data are made publicly accessible via the Open Science Framework to maximize transparency and accountability (<a href=\"#bib8\">Nosek et al., 2015</a>). This approach has two main benefits: first, it improves the experimental designs and protocols with expert input prior to performing\u00a0the\u00a0experiments; second, by removing the possibility that the results of the experiments will influence the peer review process, it avoids certain biases (such as the bias against negative results, and the possibility that referees will accept results that are favorable to their point of view and reject results that are not; <a href=\"#bib2\">Chambers, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Nosek and Lakens, 2014</a>).

Is the effect size in the replication similar to the effect size in the original? Does the original effect size fall within the confidence or prediction interval of the replication (and vice versa)? Does a meta-analytic combination of results from the original experiment and the replication yield a statistically significant effect?

Equally, a single replication cannot make a definitive statement about the original finding. However, the new evidence provided by a replication can increase or decrease confidence in the reproducibility of the original finding. When a replication \"fails\" it can spur productive theorizing about the source of that irreproducibility. For example, it could be that the experimental model did not behave as expected (for example, the rate of tumor onset observed in the replication might be higher than the rate observed in the original research in both the control and experimental conditions). In such circumstances, the original hypothesis and finding may not have been evaluated directly because the experimental circumstances necessary to test them did not recur. Alternatively, the model might have behaved as expected, but the experimental intervention did not result in an effect similar to the original study. These two scenarios have different implications for hypothesizing the underlying causes of irreproducibility, and for deciding on the follow-up investigations that are needed to establish reproducibility."
