                    "text": "Human <i>SEMAPHORIN 5A (SEMA5A)</i> is an autism susceptibility gene; however, its function in brain development is unknown. In this study, we show that mouse <i>Sema5A</i> negatively regulates synaptogenesis in early, developmentally born, hippocampal dentate granule cells (GCs). Sema5A is strongly expressed by GCs and regulates dendritic spine density in a cell-autonomous manner. In the adult mouse brain, newly born <i>Sema5A</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> GCs show an increase in dendritic spine density and increased AMPA-type synaptic responses. Sema5A signals through PlexinA2 co-expressed by GCs, and the PlexinA2-RasGAP activity is necessary to suppress spinogenesis. Like <i>Sema5A</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mutants, <i>PlexinA2</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mice show an increase in GC glutamatergic synapses, and we show that <i>Sema5A</i> and <i>PlexinA2</i> genetically interact with respect to GC spine phenotypes. <i>Sema5A</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mice display deficits in social interaction, a hallmark of autism-spectrum-disorders. These experiments identify novel intra-dendritic Sema5A/PlexinA2 interactions that inhibit excitatory synapse formation in developmentally born and adult-born GCs, and they provide support for SEMA5A contributions to autism-spectrum-disorders."

In this study, we show that mouse <i>Sema5A</i> negatively regulates synaptogenesis in early, developmentally born, hippocampal dentate granule cells (GCs). Sema5A is strongly expressed by GCs and regulates dendritic spine density in a cell-autonomous manner. In the adult mouse brain, newly born <i>Sema5A</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> GCs show an increase in dendritic spine density and increased AMPA-type synaptic responses. Sema5A signals through PlexinA2 co-expressed by GCs, and the PlexinA2-RasGAP activity is necessary to suppress spinogenesis. Like <i>Sema5A</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mutants, <i>PlexinA2</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mice show an increase in GC glutamatergic synapses, and we show that <i>Sema5A</i> and <i>PlexinA2</i> genetically interact with respect to GC spine phenotypes. <i>Sema5A</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mice display deficits in social interaction, a hallmark of autism-spectrum-disorders. These experiments identify novel intra-dendritic Sema5A/PlexinA2 interactions that inhibit excitatory synapse formation in developmentally born and adult-born GCs, and they provide support for SEMA5A contributions to autism-spectrum-disorders."

To augment these data, we conducted a detailed analysis of <i>Sema5A</i> expression in the postnatal hippocampus and entorhinal cortex (EC) using a <i>Sema5A</i> reporter mouse expressing nuclear <i>lacZ</i> (<a href=\"#bib16\">Gunn et al., 2011</a>). In the P18 and P30 hippocampus, strong \u03b2-gal activity is observed in the granule cell layer (GCL), the hilus and in CA3 pyramidal neurons. Moderate-to-strong \u03b2-gal activity is also observed in deep EC layers (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), however more superficial EC layers, including layer II/III neurons that give rise to the perforant path, do not show <i>Sema5A</i> promoter activity. In situ hybridization for <i>Sema5A</i> revealed a similar expression pattern (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). <i>Sema5B</i> expression in the postnatal hippocampus is largely confined to the DG subgranular zone (SGZ). Subcellular fractionation of hippocampal tissue revealed that Sema5A protein is present in synaptic and extra-synaptic membrane fractions and is enriched in detergent-resistant post-synaptic density (PSD) fractions. Sema5B is enriched postsynaptically and only found in the PSDIII fraction (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>)."

Analysis of the frequency and amplitude of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) in 19- to 21-day postmitotic GCs of 9- to 11-week-old mice revealed a significant increase in mEPSC frequency and amplitude in <i>Sema5A</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> hippocampal slices compared to WT slices (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2I\u2013K</a>).

To address whether Sema5A influences spine density through interactions in <i>trans</i> between neighboring GCs or in <i>cis</i> within the same cell, we employed primary hippocampal neurons stained for the GC marker prospero homeobox protein 1 (prox1) (<a href=\"#bib10\">Elliott et al., 2001</a>) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). At DIV21, <i>Sema5A</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> GCs show a significant (33.5%) increase in spine density (2.23 \u00b1 0.08 spines/\u00b5m) as compared to WT controls (1.67 \u00b1 0.04 spines/\u00b5m). To ask whether the supernumerary GC spine phenotype is rescued by recombinant Sema5A, neuronal cultures were transfected at DIV4 and analyzed at DIV21 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Because only a small fraction (\u223c1%) of the neurons in culture is transfected, and since spine density was assessed in isolated, prox1<sup>+</sup>, neurons whose processes did not overlap with any other <i>Sema5A</i>-transfected neurons, <i>trans</i> intercellular Sema5A interactions do not figure in this analysis. Recombinant Sema5A was present on dendrites and cell bodies (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>) and decreased GC spine density by 34% in <i>Sema5A</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> (1.10 \u00b1 0.04 spines/\u00b5m) and by 29% in <i>Sema5A</i><sup><i>+/+</i></sup> (1.18 \u00b1 0.04 spines/\u00b5m) hippocampal cultures (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>). This suggests that a Sema5A <i>cis</i> interaction cell-autonomously constrains the formation of supernumerary GC spines. In these same cultures, expression of recombinant Sema5A in pyramidal neurons leads to a reduction in spine density (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). To examine whether or not Sema5A serves as a receptor (<a href=\"#bib32\">Pasterkamp, 2012</a>), we expressed a Sema5A deletion mutant lacking its cytoplasmic domain (S5A<sup>\u0394cyto</sup>) and asked if this altered Sema5A protein was sufficient to rescue the <i>Sema5A</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> GC spine phenotype. Similar to full-length Sema5A (1.10 \u00b1 0.04 spines/\u00b5m), S5A<sup>\u0394cyto</sup> rescues the <i>Sema5A</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> spine phenotype (1.09 \u00b1 0.03 spines/\u00b5m) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>). We next generated Sema5A deletion constructs lacking either the sema-domain (S5A<sup>\u0394Sema</sup>) or the 7 TSRs (S5A<sup>\u0394TSR</sup>), confirmed that they were appropriately expressed (data not shown), and found that S5A<sup>\u0394Sema</sup> (1.94 \u00b1 0.05 spines/\u00b5m), but not S5A<sup>\u0394TSR</sup> (1.11 \u00b1 0.05 spines/\u00b5m), fails to rescue the <i>Sema5A</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> GC spine phenotype (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>). These results show that the sema-domain of Sema5A is necessary and sufficient to regulate GC dendritic spine density. Further, they suggest that Sema5A functions as a ligand or co-receptor that interacts in <i>cis</i> with a transmembrane-spanning signal transducing receptor to constrain GC spine formation. Independent evidence that Sema5A functions as a ligand stems from experiments in which we bath applied soluble Sema5A-Fc fusion protein to DIV21 GCs. Sema5A-Fc, but not control IgG protein, results in a rapid loss of dendritic spines (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,D</a>)."

However, behavioral studies with a <i>Sema5A</i> gene-trap insertion mouse mutant (<i>Sema5A</i><sup><i>lacZ/lacZ</i></sup>) on a mixed C57Bl/6/129P2 background showed no behavioral differences compared to C57Bl/6 control mice (<a href=\"#bib16\">Gunn et al., 2011</a>). This gene-trap insertion is in the last coding exon of the <i>Sema5A</i> gene, generating a deletion mutant lacking the C-terminal portion of the cytoplasmic domain, a region of Sema5A that we find is not necessary for the regulation of dendritic spine density (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Indeed, when we analyzed GC spine density in these mice we did not observe a significant difference compared to WT controls, suggesting this <i>Sema5A</i> allele is not a null, or strong loss of function, mutation (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Therefore, we extensively backcrossed our <i>Sema5A</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mice to C57Bl/6 mice. These congenic <i>Sema5A</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mutants were confirmed to be &gt;99% C57Bl/6 and were subjected to a panel of behavioral assays. <i>Sema5A</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> congenic mutants show normal locomotor behavior in the open field test (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), and mutant and WT mice exhibit similar anxiety levels (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figures 7\u2014figure supplement 1B,C</a>). They also spend a similar percentage of time in the open and closed arms of the elevated plus maze (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>).

We next assessed the time of direct nose-to-nose interaction of WT C57Bl/6 and <i>Sema5A</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mice with a stranger vs a familiar mouse. WT mice show a strong preference for nose-to-nose contact with the stranger mouse, a behavior representing normal social interaction (<a href=\"#bib53\">Yang et al., 2011</a>).

In the mouse hippocampus, Sema5A negatively regulates dendritic spine density in both developmentally born and adult-born dentate GCs. Loss of Sema5A-PlexA2 signaling results in the formation of supernumerary dendritic spines, exuberant excitatory synapses, and an increase in amplitude and frequency of excitatory synaptic transmission. Sema5A and PlexA2 are co-expressed in GCs and can both function cell-autonomously to prevent the formation of exuberant spine synapses. The rasGAP activity in the PlexA2 cytoplasmic domain is required for Sema5A-mediated inhibition of dendritic spine density. <i>Sema5A</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> congenic mice show normal locomotion and no evidence for elevated fear or anxiety. However, the loss of <i>Sema5A</i> leads to deficiencies in sociability.

                                "text": "Developmentally born and adult-born GCs mature at different rates and in different environments, yet the sequence of neuronal maturation events is stereotyped and temporally segregated (<a href=\"#bib11\">Esposito et al., 2005</a>). GC intrinsic programs may be advantageous in order to preserve the sequence of cellular maturation. Sema5A is strongly expressed in GCs during development and throughout adulthood. Similar to developmentally born GCs, we find that adult-born GCs employ Sema5A to negatively regulate dendritic spine density. In adult-born <i>Sema5A</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> GCs 3-weeks postmitosis, dendritic spine density is increased and correlates with an increase in mEPSC frequency. In addition, the loss of <i>Sema5A</i> increases the amplitude of AMPA receptor currents in these adult-born GCs. Because of its postsynaptic localization, Sema5A may normally negatively regulate AMPA receptor surface expression, synaptic distribution, or downstream signaling events that limit mEPSC amplitude. In primary hippocampal neurons, we find that the loss of <i>Sema5A</i> does not lead to an increase in total GluA1 expression or localization to synapses (data not shown). Sema5A associates with HSPGs and CSPGs (<a href=\"#bib20\">Kantor et al., 2004</a>), and proteoglycans are known to participate in the regulation of surface GluA1 distribution through inhibition of AMPA receptor lateral diffusion at synapses. In the absence of Sema5A, the barrier function of CSPGs may be increased, resulting in elevated synaptic strength (<a href=\"#bib2\">Allen and Barres, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Frischknecht et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Orlando et al., 2012</a>). More indirect mechanisms may also apply here, since two recent studies show that presynaptic HSPGs, including members of the glypican and syndecan families, interact with the LRRTM4 protein to promote the formation of excitatory synapses on GCs (<a href=\"#bib42\">Siddiqui et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">de Wit et al., 2013</a>). Sema5A can interact with neural syndecans (<a href=\"#bib20\">Kantor et al., 2004</a>), and at GC synapses Sema5A may compete with the synaptogenic activity of LRRTM4. While the recombinant sema domain of Sema5A is sufficient to \u2018rescue\u2019 the increased dendritic spine density observed in primary GCs null for <i>Sema5A</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> in vitro, TSR-dependent proteoglycan interactions with endogenous Sema5A may influence the strength of sema-domain dependent <i>cis</i>- and <i>trans</i>-complexes in vivo. It is interesting in this context that, similar to what we observe in <i>Sema5A</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mice, loss of <i>LRRTM4</i> selectivity influences the density of excitatory synapses but has no effect on inhibitory synapse density. Additional studies will elucidate the precise mechanisms by which Sema5A negatively regulates synaptic strength, and whether it serves to directly counter synaptogenic pathways."

Previous studies showed that Sema6A regulates GC axonal targeting in a <i>Plxna2-</i> and <i>Plxna4</i>-dependent manner (<a href=\"#bib45\">Suto et al., 2007</a>), and also that the secreted molecule Sema3F signals through neuropilin-2/PlexA3 to control dendritic spine shape and density in developing GCs (<a href=\"#bib49\">Tran et al., 2009</a>). Similar to Sema3F, Sema5A regulates GC spine density, however Sema3F, but not Sema5A, apparently regulates spine shape. Sema3F is a secreted molecule, and thus can exert long-range effects, while Sema5A is a transmembrane molecule and acts locally. Sema5A, but not Sema3F, continues to be expressed in the adult dentate, and we show that Sema5A regulates synaptic density and function in adult-born GCs.

Similarly, the <i>cis</i>-interaction between PlexA2 and Sema5A on GC dendrites we describe here may suppress the formation of supernumerary protrusions that mature into excitatory synapses.

The brains were quickly removed into the ice-cold solution (in mM: 110 choline chloride, 2.5 KCl, 1.3 KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 25.0 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 0.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 7 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 20 dextrose, 1.3 sodium L-ascorbate, 0.6 sodium pyruvate, 5.0 kynurenic acid). Slices (275 \u03bcm thick) were cut using a vibrotome (Leica VT1200S) and transferred to a chamber containing the external solution (in mM: 125.0 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.3 KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 1.3 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 25.0 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.3 sodium L-ascorbate, 0.6 sodium pyruvate, 10 dextrose, pH 7.4, 320 mOsm), bubbled with 95% O<sub>2</sub>/5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Electrophysiological recordings were obtained at 32\u00b0C\u201334\u00b0C. GFP<sup>+</sup> cells within the granule cell layer were visualized by DIC and fluorescence microscopy. The whole-cell patch-clamp configuration was employed in voltage-clamp mode (V<sub>m</sub> = \u221265 mV). Microelectrodes (4\u20136 M\u03a9) were pulled from borosilicate glass capillaries and filled with the internal solution containing (in mM) 120 potassium gluconate, 15 KCl, 4 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.1 EGTA, 10.0 HEPES, 4 ATP (magnesium salt), 0.3 GTP (sodium salt), 7 phosphocreatine (pH 7.4, 300 mOsm). The recordings were done in the presence of bicuculline (10 \u03bcM) to block GABAergic currents and TTX (1 \u03bcM) to block action potentials. Data were collected using an Axon 200B amplifier and acquired with a DigiData 1322A (Axon Instruments) at 10 kHz. Series and input resistances were monitored and only those with changes of less than 20% during experiments were analyzed. The series resistance ranged from 10 to 30 M\u2126 and was uncompensated."

Subsequently, a cage with a WT C57Bl/6 mouse and a cage with an inanimate object were placed in each of the side chambers. The subject mouse was allowed to enter each chamber freely and interact with the mouse or object for 5 min. Finally, the inanimate object was replaced with a new WT C57Bl/6 mouse, and the subject mouse was allowed to enter each chamber freely and interact with either mouse for 5 min. The behavior of the mice was videotaped and analyzed by Any-maze video tracking system (Stoelting Co.). Video of each subject mouse was reviewed and time engaged in nose-to-nose interaction with other mice and sniffing the inanimate object was quantified manually."

In particular, this manuscript comprehensively characterized the role of semaphorin5A in synaptogenesis in early and late postnatally generated dentate gyrus granule cells. The experiments provided convincing evidence that loss of semaphorin5A leads to an increase in spine density and increased AMPA-mediated synaptic responses using a variety of detailed anatomical, cell biological and electrophysiological approaches. Moreover, their genetic experiments showed that loss of Plexin-A2 leads to a similar spine phenotype, and provided evidence for a genetic interaction. Since GWAS studies have implicated SEMA5A as an autism risk gene, it was exciting that the authors found that mice lacking this gene exhibit behavioral phenotypes relevant to autism (social interaction)."
