Recent work has revealed tissue-specific roles for ILCs; however, the question of how a small population has large effects on immune homeostasis remains unclear. We identify two mechanisms that ILC3s utilise to exert their effects within intestinal tissue. ILC-driven colitis depends on production of granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), which recruits and maintains intestinal inflammatory monocytes. ILCs present in the intestine also enter and exit cryptopatches in a highly dynamic process. During colitis, ILC3s mobilize from cryptopatches, a process that can be inhibited by blocking GM-CSF, and mobilization precedes inflammatory foci elsewhere in the tissue. Together these data identify the IL-23R/GM-CSF axis within ILC3 as a key control point in the accumulation of innate effector cells in the intestine and in the spatio-temporal dynamics of ILCs in the intestinal inflammatory response."

Recent work has revealed tissue-specific roles for ILCs; however, the question of how a small population has large effects on immune homeostasis remains unclear. We identify two mechanisms that ILC3s utilise to exert their effects within intestinal tissue. ILC-driven colitis depends on production of granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), which recruits and maintains intestinal inflammatory monocytes. ILCs present in the intestine also enter and exit cryptopatches in a highly dynamic process. During colitis, ILC3s mobilize from cryptopatches, a process that can be inhibited by blocking GM-CSF, and mobilization precedes inflammatory foci elsewhere in the tissue. Together these data identify the IL-23R/GM-CSF axis within ILC3 as a key control point in the accumulation of innate effector cells in the intestine and in the spatio-temporal dynamics of ILCs in the intestinal inflammatory response."

Several groups of innate lymphoid cells are now known; each group is characterized by the genes that control the cell\u2019s development and the small proteins (called cytokines) that the cells release. One group of innate lymphoid cells, the ILC3s, are generally found in the intestinal tract, albeit in small numbers. Given that innate lymphoid cells are known to manage inflammatory responses, it is possible that ILC3s contribute to intestinal inflammation. However, it remains unclear how such a small population of cells could so dramatically inflame the gut."

Secondly, while ILC3s were traditionally regarded as immobile immune cells, Pearson et al. discovered that these cells can move within the intestinal tissue and mobilize from their starting points within this tissue if they are activated. These two mechanisms could explain how ILC3s can trigger inflammation that occurs throughout the gut."

Nevertheless, clinical trials are underway to investigate the use of anti-GM-CSF drugs to treat other inflammatory conditions (such as rheumatoid arthritis). These studies could offer insight into whether these drugs provide relief to trial participants who suffer from intestinal inflammation as well."

As with conventional Th1, Th2 and Th17\u2009T cells, ILCs can be functionally classified based on the expression of transcription factors and associated signature cytokines (<a href=\"#bib43\">Spits et al., 2013</a>). ILC1 are defined by Th1-like and ILC2 by Th2-like cytokine responses, whereas ILC3 express ROR\u03b3t, and can secrete IL-17 and/or IL-22 upon activation. The ILC3 family includes the prototypic foetal lymphoid tissue inducer (LTi) cells that play a non-redundant role in lymphoid tissue development (<a href=\"#bib33\">Mebius et al., 1997</a>) via lymphotoxin-dependent interactions with stromal cells. This pathway is required not only for lymph node development but also for organised lymphoid structures in the gut such as dendritic cell (DC) and ILC containing cryptopatches (CP) (<a href=\"#bib11\">Eberl and Sawa, 2010</a>), B cell, DC and ILC containing isolated lymphoid follicles (ILFs) (<a href=\"#bib45\">Tsuji et al., 2008</a>), and small intestinal Peyer\u2019s Patches (PP) that have a very similar structure to lymph nodes (<a href=\"#bib8\">Cornes, 1965</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib33\">Mebius et al., 1997</a>).

Both of these behaviours likely contribute to the ability of ILCs to coordinate the immune response in the gut. Initiation and perpetuation of disease occur in distinct anatomical compartments, indicating both a temporal and spatial switch of ILC function during inflammatory conditions."

Strikingly, administration of an anti-GM-CSF blocking mAb reduced both weight loss (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>) and severity of colitis (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Indeed amelioration of colitis with GM-CSF blockade was similar to that observed with anti-IL-23R mAb treatment. Similar effects of GM-CSF blockade were also observed in bacteria-induced innate colitis following <i>Helicobacter hepaticus</i> infection of 129SvEv <i>Rag2</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) supporting a pivotal role for this cytokine in both T cell dependent and innate colitis. GM-CSF has been shown to promote CNS inflammation through effects on inflammatory monocytes (<a href=\"#bib9\">Croxford et al., 2015</a>). Consistent with this and in line with a recent report (<a href=\"#bib41\">Song et al., 2015</a>) GM-CSF blockade led to a marked reduction in the number of inflammatory monocytes in the colon of anti-CD40 treated mice (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). The number of neutrophils and eosinophils also decreased, but this was not significant. These changes were accompanied by an increase in both the percentage and total number of CD11b<sup>-</sup> CD103<sup>+</sup> dendritic cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>)."

Under non-inflammatory conditions, ILCs are found within lymphoid structures in the colon (<a href=\"#bib11\">Eberl and Sawa, 2010</a>), and in <i>Rag</i>-deficient hosts these structures are limited to cryptopatches as there are no B cells to form ILFs. Under homeostatic conditions ILCs primarily reside within lymphoid aggregate cryptopatch (CP) structures (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>) and are found only rarely within the non-inflamed lamina propria. Within CP, ROR\u03b3t<sup>+</sup> and IL-7R\u03b1<sup>+</sup> ILC3s are present at high density surrounded by CD11c and MHCII expressing cells. Some of these ILCs within CP also express CD4, suggesting that some but not all are classical LTi cells that are known to be involved in lymphoid organogenesis (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). In addition to ROR\u03b3t expression, ILCs are known to express IL-23R (<a href=\"#bib4\">Buonocore et al., 2010</a>). FACS analysis of <i>Rag</i>-deficient mice that express GFP under control of the <i>Il23r</i> demonstrates that these mice can be used to study ILC behaviour in vivo (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Two-photon imaging of <i>Il23r</i><sup>gfp/+</sup> <i>Rag</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice\u00a0shows ILCs (green) present within a cryptopatch (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, and <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). Quantification of ILC localization in 3D indicates that greater than 90% of ILCs are present within cryptopatches under steady-state conditions (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). This suggests that IL-23R<sup>+</sup> ILCs are perfectly positioned in close proximity to a high density of CD11c<sup>+</sup> DCs that can be activated by colitogenic stimuli. Indeed <i>Il23r</i> mRNA increased in the colon 6\u2009hr following anti-CD40 injection indicating that the first ILC changes occur in the hours following CD40 stimulation (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>)."

In support of this hypothesis, analysis of ROR\u03b3t protein revealed a transient decrease in the proportion of ILCs expressing it 3 days following anti-CD40 stimulation (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1D&amp;E</a>), similar to a previous report (<a href=\"#bib47\">Vonarbourg et al., 2010</a>).

Alternatively, ILCs may be able to mobilize into the tissue to coordinate the immune response. To understand which mechanism ILCs utilize, we adopted the strategy of McDole <i>et al</i> (<a href=\"#bib31\">McDole et al., 2012</a>) used to study leukocytes in the gut. In the steady-state, ILCs were much more motile than expected. While little motility could be observed within the cryptopatch, ILCs can be observed to enter and exit the cluster near the basal collagen layer (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a> and <a href=\"#media2\">Videos 2</a> and <a href=\"#media3\">3</a>). Interestingly, the cryptopatch did not have an obvious point of entry or exit, implying that trafficking into and out of the structure may be governed by mechanisms different to that of the lymph node. By gating on motile cells outside the cluster, we could see that the average velocity of motile ILCs (approximately 9\u00a0\u03bcm/min) is grossly similar to that of other lymphocytes and while cell velocity decreases after treatment with anti-CD40 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>), this difference does not appear to affect overall cell trafficking. To determine whether ILC trafficking changed in colitis, we plotted the displacements of ILCs in steady-state and after anti-CD40 treatment (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>, <a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a>, and <a href=\"#media5\">Video 5</a>). While no gross changes appeared in track displacements, the overall movement of cells shifted. In steady-state, roughly equal numbers of cells move toward and away from the cluster; however, just 4\u20136\u2009hr after anti-CD40 treatment, a greater proportion of cells exit the tissue and a smaller proportion enter (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). The ratio of entering to exiting cells indicates a significant skewing toward egress from cryptopatches (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). To assess whether GM-CSF may be playing a role in ILC mobilization, we treated mice with anti-GM-CSF 24\u2009hr before imaging. The shift toward exit that is normally observed after anti-CD40 treatment was strikingly reversed when mice were treated with a GM-CSF blocking antibody 24\u2009hr before imaging (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D and E</a>, <a href=\"#media6\">Video 6</a>). It is possible that many of these cells move through blood vessels, but by labelling the blood vessels with texas-red dextran, ILCs appeared to be adjacent to blood vessels, not within them (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>). This indicates that ILCs may be mobilizing into the adjacent tissue from cryptopatches."

The receptor for <i>Ccl19, Ccr7</i>, was also increased (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Blocking GM-CSF prevented the increase of <i>Ccr7</i> and <i>Ccl2</i>, supporting the idea that there is cross-talk between the GM-CSF and migration axes. Staining for CCR7 and CCR2 on lineage<sup>+</sup> and ILC subsets suggested that it is the lineage positive cells that are capable of responding to the increased tissue chemokines (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Histological analysis of the proximal colon 7 days after anti-CD40 treatment showed immune foci at the tips of villi (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Immunofluorescence staining for CD11c and ROR\u03b3t showed colocalization of ILCs with the CD11c positive immune infiltrate. The latter may reflect the inflammatory monocytes identified by flow cytometry from colon digests (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a> and <a href=\"#fig1\">1E</a>). Quantification of cryptopatch cellularity from H&amp;E; after anti-CD40 treatment showed a decrease in cellularity after 24\u2009hr (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). The net egress of cells from cryptopatches over a short imaging window (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>) corresponds to the loss of cells from the tissue over 24\u2009hr. This decrease is followed by an increase in inflammatory infiltrates starting one day later (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>). Blocking GM-CSF resulted in maintenance of cryptopatch structure as would be predicted from the imaging data (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G</a>). Taken together, these data indicate that ILC mobilization from cryptopatches is associated with a decrease in cryptopatch cellularity, increase in tissue chemokines, recruitment of inflammatory cells, and development of inflammatory foci associated with active disease."

Two recent reports indicated a functional role for IL-22, possibly through neutrophil recruitment (<a href=\"#bib12\">Eken et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Song et al., 2015</a>). However our data show no impact of IL-22 blockade or neutrophil depletion (data not shown) on the incidence or severity of disease in this model. By contrast, double blockade of IL-17A and IL-22 reduced colitis severity, indicating that these cytokines may play a redundant role in driving intestinal inflammation possibly through shared effects on intestinal epithelial cells (<a href=\"#bib27\">Liang et al., 2006</a>). The pathogenic role of IL-22 in CD40-triggered colitis may depend on the presence of microbial factors that also influence IL-17A production in the intestine. Consistent with this, IL-22 alone was required for the maintenance of bacteria driven innate colitis-associated cancer (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kirchberger et al., 2013</a>). Together these results suggest that context-dependent effector functions mediate the colitogenic potential of IL-23."

We found that GM-CSF played a non-redundant role in both systemic and intestinal inflammation in the anti-CD40 model and was required for bacteria-induced innate colitis. The role of GM-CSF in anti-CD40 mediated systemic disease has been recently reported (<a href=\"#bib41\">Song et al., 2015</a>) but effects on colitis were not assessed. Our results indicate that IL-23-responsive ILCs can act as the main source of GM-CSF in an innate model. Importantly we also find that ILCs are potent sources of GM-CSF in humans, consistent with a previous report describing cytokine-driven GM-CSF production from an NKp44<sup>-</sup> ILC population (<a href=\"#bib18\">Glatzer et al., 2013</a>). Our study goes further to show that GM-CSF is produced by ILC3s in the blood and colon of patients. The percent of GM-CSF<sup>+</sup> ILCs is larger than the percent of GM-CSF<sup>+</sup> T cells. This GM-CSF<sup>+</sup> ILC3 population is increased in the blood and colonic tissue of patients with IBD, indicating commonalities between mouse models and human disease pathogenesis."

A similar positive feedback loop has been described for T cell derived GM-CSF in CNS inflammation (<a href=\"#bib13\">El-Behi et al., 2011</a>). Such a feedback loop would promote more GM-CSF production from ILCs as IL-23 production increases in disease. The role of GM-CSF may be to recruit myeloid cells to sites of inflammation, and impact their ability to coordinate inflammatory responses, as has recently been shown in EAE (<a href=\"#bib9\">Croxford et al., 2015</a>). Indeed, we found blocking GM-CSF prevented the accumulation of Ly6C<sup>+</sup> inflammatory monocytes following anti-CD40 stimulation, in line with recent evidence for a key role for these cells in driving pathogenesis during anti-CD40 induced colitis (<a href=\"#bib41\">Song et al., 2015</a>).

However, that study did not assess ILC movement within tissues as a mechanism through which ILCs may modulate the immune and inflammatory response. To investigate this, we utilized <i>intra vital</i> microscopy to image ILC movement within cryptopatches under homeostatic conditions and in anti-CD40 induced intestinal inflammation. Cryptopatches may provide a platform for the rapid amplification of the immune response and may provide a potential mechanism by which a very small number of ILCs could initiate an immune cascade that culminates in colonic inflammation. Because of the large overlap of cell surface molecule and transcription factor expression between ILCs and T cells, imaging <i>Rag</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice provided the cleanest system to study ILC motility. The anti-CD40 model provided temporal synchronization, which is a feature unique to this model of colitis. To our surprise, a subset of ILCs associated with the cryptopatch was migratory under steady-state conditions. After anti-CD40 treatment, ILC motility shifted toward egress from the cryptopatch. In agreement with data that suggests they do not recirculate through the blood (<a href=\"#bib16\">Gasteiger et al., 2015</a>), ILCs were not observed migrating into the peripheral blood but appeared to crawl directly through the tissue, possibly following a local chemokine gradient. Future studies will be required to determine what factors govern entrance and exit from lymphoid structures within the tissue, which appears very different from the lymph node. Further understanding of this response may identify pathways that can be targeted to break the proinflammatory cycle within the tissue. As tools become available, studying ILC behaviour in lymphorepleate hosts will further expand these findings and allow increased interrogation of cellular interactions between ILCs and other immune cells as well as spatio-temporal control points in the inflammatory response."

Despite data showing that migration of LTi ILC3s from the gut to the mesenteric lymph nodes is dependent on CCR7 expression (<a href=\"#bib29\">Mackley et al., 2015</a>), expression of CCR7 on ILCs was not assessed in that study and we were unable to identify CCR7 or CCR2 on intestinal ILC3s in anti-CD40 induced colitis. While this argues against CCR7 driven chemotaxis of the ILCs, it does not preclude an organizational function for ILCs in the tissue driven by other mediators. Indeed, our data indicate a role for GM-CSF in the net egress of ILCs from cryptopatches in anti-CD40 induced colitis. Similarly, increased amounts of <i>ccl2</i> and <i>ccr7</i> mRNA in the colon were also GM-CSF-dependent, as was accumulation of inflammatory monocytes which also express CCR7 and CCR2 (<a href=\"#bib44\">Tsou et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">F\u00f6rster et al., 2008</a>). Together, the data are compatible with a model in which GM-CSF-dependent activation of ILCs leads to exit from the cryptopatch to the villus tip. This coincides with the recruitment of CCR7 and CCR2 expressing inflammatory monocytes through a CCL19 and CCL2 gradient, culminating in tissue damage. Sustained production of GM-CSF by ILCs in inflammatory foci could recruit inflammatory progenitor cells and contribute to differentiation of myeloid effector cells. GM-CSF has been shown to control the differentiation of inflammatory monocytes (<a href=\"#bib26\">Lenzo et al., 2012</a>), and this population was markedly reduced following anti-GM-CSF treatment. GM-CSF may also impact on this pathway through altered haematopoiesis and accumulation of granulocyte macrophage progenitors as described in T cell dependent colitis (<a href=\"#bib19\">Griseri et al., 2012</a>). Given the multiple activities of GM-CSF on myeloid cell development and function, further studies will be required to delineate the key downstream pathways."

However, our studies indicate that neutralisation of GM-CSF is as efficacious as blockade of IL-23 in mouse models. In addition, increases in GM-CSF secreting ILCs are a feature of IBD. However, targeting GM-CSF may not be straightforward in IBD as there are clear host protective functions of GM-CSF in the intestine (<a href=\"#bib40\">Sainathan et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Bernasconi et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Hirata et al., 2010</a>). Indeed neutralising anti-GM-CSF autoantibodies are increased in IBD, particularly in patients with ileal and stricturing disease (<a href=\"#bib20\">Han et al., 2009</a>). Furthermore, administration of recombinant GM-CSF (sargramostim) has been used to treat Crohn\u2019s disease (<a href=\"#bib25\">Korzenik et al., 2005</a>) although further trials did not show any substantial benefit of GM-CSF treatment (<a href=\"#bib39\">Roth et al., 2012</a>). Despite these issues, in light of recent developments testing anti-GM-CSF in clinical trials for the treatment of other inflammatory conditions such as multiple sclerosis (<a href=\"#bib7\">Constantinescu et al., 2015</a>) it will be interesting to see if subgroups of patients with hyperinflammatory innate immune activation-driven IBD could benefit from GM-CSF blockade."

The level to which blocking IL-22 ameliorates colitis may depend on microbial factors that also influence IL-17A production in the intestine. Indeed as pointed out by the reviewer our own studies revealed a non-\u00adredundant role for IL\u00ad22 in bacteria driven innate colitis-associated cancer (Kirchberger et al. 2013).

We now show that GM-CSF is required for the mobilization of ILCs from cryptopatches, implicating the cytokine in the pro-inflammatory initiation step of the disease. These data, coupled with a decrease in inflammatory monocytes with anti-GM-CSF blockade, newly implicate ILCs in the development of inflammatory foci within the tissue. While our manuscript was in revision, a new study appeared demonstrating a role for GM-CSF in the systemic anti-CD40 induced disease in <i>Rag<sup>-/-</sup></i>mice and in accumulation of inflammatory monocytes in the intestine. There was no analysis of the functional role of GM-CSF in colitis or movement of ILCs in that study, so our data provide important new mechanistic insight into the functions of GM-CSF in the colon. However both studies together strongly support a role for GM-CSF in monocyte/macrophage accumulation in the intestine."

                    "text": "The inflammatory cytokines downstream of IL-23 likely play different roles in bacterial versus anti- CD40 driven colitis. Indeed anti-CD40 induced colitis occurs in germ free mice indicating the aetiopathogenesis can be microbe independent (Uhlig et al. 2006). However the presence of particular microbes in the RAG colony may alter IL-23 dependent down-stream effector mechanisms in anti-CD40 colitis. Indeed our own data supports this showing a non-redundant role for IL-23 driven IL-22 in <i>H. hepaticus</i> driven innate colitis associated cancer. This may reflect the differential involvement of epithelial derived signals in bacteria versus anti-CD40 induced colitis with IL-17 and IL-22, which act on the epithelium, having a more dominant role in the former. Importantly by contrast with the redundant role of IL-17 and IL-22 in anti-CD40 colitis, GM-CSF is required in both models and we have now included data showing anti-GM-CSF blockade ameliorates colitis in bacteria-driven innate colitis (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). A more in-depth discussion of the context dependent roles of IL-23 driven downstream cytokines, which are of relevance to therapeutic targeting in IBD, has been added to the Discussion."
