Here, we analyze a complex food seeking behavior in the nematode <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> (<i>C. elegans</i>) to derive a general theory describing different searches. We show that <i>C. elegans</i>, like many other animals, uses a multi-stage search for food, where they initially explore a small area intensively (\u2018local search\u2019) before switching to explore a much larger area (\u2018global search\u2019). We demonstrate that these search strategies as well as the transition between them can be quantitatively explained by a maximally informative search strategy, where the searcher seeks to continuously maximize information about the target. Although performing maximally informative search is computationally demanding, we show that a drift-diffusion model can approximate it successfully with just three neurons. Our study reveals how the maximally informative search strategy can be implemented and adopted to different search conditions."

Here, we analyze a complex food seeking behavior in the nematode <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> (<i>C. elegans</i>) to derive a general theory describing different searches. We show that <i>C. elegans</i>, like many other animals, uses a multi-stage search for food, where they initially explore a small area intensively (\u2018local search\u2019) before switching to explore a much larger area (\u2018global search\u2019). We demonstrate that these search strategies as well as the transition between them can be quantitatively explained by a maximally informative search strategy, where the searcher seeks to continuously maximize information about the target. Although performing maximally informative search is computationally demanding, we show that a drift-diffusion model can approximate it successfully with just three neurons. Our study reveals how the maximally informative search strategy can be implemented and adopted to different search conditions."

If the worm has not found food after 15 min, it abruptly switches its behavior to a so-called \u2018global search\u2019 strategy, which features fewer sharp turns and more forays into the surrounding area."

While reliable on small scale, this strategy can prove problematic when the distribution of food is patchy. Calhoun et al. show that in extreme conditions, such as when food is completely removed, the animals determine where and for how long to persist with their search based on their knowledge of what was typical of their environment. Such a strategy is called infotaxis, which literally means \u2018guided by information\u2019. While the neural circuits underpinning these behaviors remain to be found, Calhoun et al. propose a model that suggests that these circuits could be relatively simple, and made up of as few as three neurons."

                        "text": "In considering animal behavior and decision-making, it is exciting to consider the proposal (<a href=\"#bib29\">Polani, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Tishby and Polani, 2011</a>) that animals may be guided by fundamental statistical quantities, such as the maximization of Shannon mutual information (<a href=\"#bib11\">Cover and Thomas, 1991</a>). The advantage of mutual information as a measure is that its maximization encompasses optimization according to many other statistical measures, such as the peak height or the variance of the distribution. These other measures would give valid results only in certain contexts, such as for predominantly unimodal or Gaussian probability distributions underlying the decision variables. The fact that mutual information can be used with different types of probability distributions makes it possible to quantitatively compare the efficiency of behavioral decisions across species, sensory modalities, and tasks. Indeed, this idea has already yielded insights into diverse behaviors including human eye movements patterns (<a href=\"#bib26\">Najemnik and Geisler, 2005</a>) and animal navigation in a turbulent environment (<a href=\"#bib32\">Vergassola et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Masson et al., 2009</a>). Both these patterns of behavior can be accounted for by adapting a maximally informative search strategy to the appropriate behavioral context. This model allocates some actions to improving the estimate of the goal's position rather than directly moving the animal towards the goal (<a href=\"#bib26\">Najemnik and Geisler, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Vergassola et al., 2007</a>). In these contexts, behavioral analyses have shown that strategies aimed at moving directly toward a goal are unable to explain key features of the animal's response. For example, humans sometimes make saccades to examine a region between, rather than directly at, the two likely locations for a target (<a href=\"#bib26\">Najemnik and Geisler, 2005</a>). Similarly, birds and moths zigzag perpendicular to the wind direction to find the source of an odor plume (<a href=\"#bib32\">Vergassola et al., 2007</a>). Information-maximization (\u2018infotaxis\u2019) is consistent with direct strategies such as chemotaxis in certain conditions. When the information content of the environment is very high, such as when chemical gradients can be tracked reliably, strategies based on information maximization converge to chemotaxis (<a href=\"#bib32\">Vergassola et al., 2007</a>). Thus, an information maximization approach can be viewed as a generalization of following direct sensory gradients to a broader and more challenging set of behavioral tasks."

Interestingly, a number of species have been reported to spend more time in areas where they have recently observed food (<a href=\"#bib23\">Karieva and Odell, 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Benedix, 1993</a>), suggesting that there might be an underlying logic to search that generalizes across species. Recent experimental studies have observed similar foraging patterns in the nematode <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> (<a href=\"#bib16\">Hills et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Wakabayashi et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Gray et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Chalasani et al., 2007</a>). After removal from food, the animal first performs an intense search around the area where it believes food is likely to be located (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). This period is characterized by an increased number of abrupt turns allowing the animal to stay in the proximal area (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>) and is termed \u2018local search\u2019. After approximately 15 min, animals reduce their number of turns to a basal rate (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). This produces more extended trajectories (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) and allows the animal to leave the proximal zone and explore a much larger area (\u2018global search\u2019). Although <i>C. elegans</i> is traditionally considered to be a chemotactic searcher (<a href=\"#bib13\">Ferree and Lockery, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Pierce-Shimomura et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Iino and Yoshida, 2009</a>), moving up or down chemical gradients to find the source of an odorant, in these conditions animals have no chemical gradient to follow. We set out to explore whether a single underlying strategy could explain the different aspects of food search behavior in this well-studied model."

For the sake of simplicity, we assume that the probability of finding food is initially distributed as a two-dimensional Gaussian distribution, which imposes the minimal structural constraint beyond the variance of the spatial distribution (<a href=\"#bib21\">Jaynes, 2003</a>). When searching through this space, an animal using the maximally informative trajectory should move in the direction that maximizes its information about the location of food. This can be calculated by taking into account the probability that the nearby environment would emit food odor and then estimating the change in information the animal expects will result from any detection or non-detection events (<a href=\"#bib32\">Vergassola et al., 2007</a>). This means that even a non-detection of a food odorant is informative as it lessens the likelihood that food is nearby. Ultimately, the probability of detecting an odorant depends on the likelihood of food sources across the environment <math id=\"inf1\"><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>r</mi><mo>\u2192</mo></mover></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow></math>. Information maximization can be analyzed with respect to this quantity, see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 for details. Analyzing these solutions, we find that the maximally informative trajectories first take the searcher towards the peak in the maximum likelihood of food distribution (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) and then follow an outward motion (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). This intensive search of a small area is qualitatively consistent with the local search performed by <i>C. elegans</i>."

In mathematical terms, we allow for the probability that a food source is in the nearby area to deviate from 1. Initially, this probability was set to be very close to one (within numerical accuracy, deviation from 1 was \u223c10<sup>\u2212100</sup>).

In experiments, the reduction in the number of turns appears to occur gradually (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). However this difference could be an artifact of the averaging of trajectories across multiple worms. In contrast, individual worm trajectories could still have sharply defined transitions, as can be seen in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>. To investigate the sharpness of this transition within individual worm trajectories, we applied a Hidden Markov model framework (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abeles et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Seidemann et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Bishop, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Jones et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Miller and Katz, 2010</a>) to experimentally recorded trajectories. If segments of single-animal trajectories represent mixtures of states corresponding to local and global parts of the search, then the probability of observing global search patterns will increase gradually. However, analysis of experimental traces revealed a sharp transition between local and global search states on the order of a few minutes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>).

Among these, chemotaxis represents the most widely used and parsimonious model of animal behavior (<a href=\"#bib9\">Brown and Berg, 1974</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Pierce-Shimomura et al., 1999</a>, <a href=\"#bib28\">2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Iino and Yoshida, 2009</a>). A searcher using this strategy would be expected to transiently increase its turning rate when removed from food due to a sudden, large change in food gradient. The subsequent decline in the number of turns would then be explained by adaptation to the low (zero) odorant concentration. Although this explanation seems plausible, it could not quantitatively account for three properties of foraging trajectories: (i) the long duration of the local search, (ii) the rapid exit from the local search state, and (iii) the inability of food concentration to influence local search. An explanation based on adaptation with a single time constant could be ruled out based on the juxtaposition between the relatively long duration of the local search with the fairly rapid transition between the local and global phases of the search. Adaptation with a slow time constant could explain the fairly substantial duration of the local search but not its sharp transition to a global search. On the other hand, adaptation with a short time constant could match the low number of turns during the global search but would underestimate the number of turns and the duration of the local phase of the search (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Quantitatively, adjusting the adaptation time constant to match the observed durations of the local search phase produces trajectories with much broader transitions between local and global phases of the search than is observed experimentally (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, comparison between the solid line and histograms, see also <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

The chemotaxis model makes predictions based on the change in odorant concentration. This change will be smaller for animals that are removed from patches with more diluted food. Therefore, the chemotaxis model in this case would predict that animals will make a smaller number of turns (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). In contrast, the infotaxis model makes predictions based not on the last odorant concentration that the animal experienced prior to its removal from food, but on the relative distribution of food in the environment. The spatial variance of this distribution is not affected by the dilution. Therefore, the infotaxis model would predict that the animals will make the same number of turns regardless of the bacteria concentration within the lawn, provided the lawns have the same size. This prediction was supported by our measurements (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Overall, we have found that <i>C. elegans</i> behavior when removed from food cannot be explained as chemotaxis but is consistent with infotaxis."

This model continuously updates the likelihood of a food source being present throughout the duration of search. At first glance, these calculations require the ability to maintain and update the corresponding \u201cmental maps\u201d of the environment. However, the animals could also approximate complex computations with empirically-tuned simple search heuristics that have only slightly smaller than maximal yields.

In our set-up the drift-diffusion model has effectively only one parameter\u2014the drift rate. While in most applications drift-diffusion models are considered together with an adjustable threshold, here the lower threshold value is fixed to 0 because the dynamical variable represents probability. Similarly, the starting value of this probability (which we set to be just under 1) also has relatively weak influence on the duration of local search.

This analysis formally requires continuous updates to the likelihood of food sources based on incoming sensory inputs. At the same time, we find that the resulting maximally informative foraging strategies can also be implemented with a combination of a random confined walk with an internal drift-diffusion variable to encode the transition to a new search strategy. The presence of such transitions illustrates how emergent discrete decisions occur as a result of continuous exploration of the environment. Previous studies have shown that drift-diffusion models can provide a substrate for optimal calculations in two alternative forced-choice tasks (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bogacs et al., 2006</a>).

Taking the two-phase foraging circuit (<a href=\"#bib15\">Gray et al., 2005</a>) that we analyzed here as an example, one may hypothesize that the initial trigger for the start of the search is provided by sensory input, likely through the AWC sensory neuron (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). AWC neurons respond to a decrease in odorant concentration (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chalasani et al., 2007</a>). However, these responses are transient (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chalasani et al., 2007</a>) and do not last long enough to account for the long duration of local search (\u223c15 min). Instead, we hypothesize that local search is maintained based on the responses of one of the interneurons. The gradual change in state of these neurons that receive sensory input, for example the AIB and AIZ interneurons, may encode the passage of time since the start of local search. Modulating the rate at which the internal state of a neuron changes allows the animal to adjust the duration of local search after sensing aspects of the environment such as how food is spatially distributed and how far the odorant molecules diffuse from this particular food source. We hypothesize that this modulation occurs through neuromodulatory signaling, which is known to be involved in local search behavior (<a href=\"#bib16\">Hills et al., 2004</a>). In summary, a neural circuit based on just a few neurons suffices to implement foraging strategies that approximate the maximally informative, but computationally intensive, decisions."

These include chemotaxis based on local sensory cues, different types of random walks (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bartumeus et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Humphries et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Viswanathan et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Humphries et al., 2012</a>), and computationally intensive models based on detailed memories of past experiences. This raises the question of whether the optimal foraging strategy is constrained not only by the physical environment but also by the computational complexity of its implementation (<a href=\"#bib31\">Tishby and Polani, 2011</a>). One approach to this solution is provided by the conventional chemotaxis model (<a href=\"#bib13\">Ferree and Lockery, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Pierce-Shimomura et al., 1999</a>). A chemotactic behavior can be implemented based on responses of just one sensory neuron. However, the resulting search strategies are driven directly by changes in the gradient and do not necessarily reflect the typical size of food patches. While infotaxis and chemotaxis strategies converge under conditions of smoothly varying gradients, this is not so in cases where transitions between patches are common. In fact, we found that chemotactic trajectories exhibited not only a much weaker dependence on the patch size compared to infotaxis trajectories but also predicted the opposite relationship between patch size and search duration (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). In addition, we found that worm and foraging trajectories were unaffected by the overall food concentration within the patch (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>), in agreement with infotaxis but in contrast to chemotaxis predictions. The addition of interneurons to the circuit, as schematized in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>, makes it possible to dissociate the change in the gradient from the duration of local search. Thus, the modest increase in computational cost associated with the addition of interneurons allows for more flexible behavior than would be seen in a simple chemotaxis strategy."

                                "text": "It has been noted that foraging strategies that maximize the mutual information about target locations do not always produce the maximal yield. Such situations have been observed in cases where the targets are mobile (<a href=\"#bib2\">Agarwala et al., 2012</a>). In this case, although the searcher knows precisely where the food is located at a given time, it might not be able to get to the food source before it moves again. Animals might counteract this problem with predictive coding, using foraging strategies that maximize information about the food source location at a sufficient time in the future (<a href=\"#bib29\">Polani, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Tishby and Polani, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bialek, 2013</a>). So long as the parameters of simpler models can be easily learned through experience, there are no barriers to implementing such strategies with a few neurons. Indeed, including predictive information may take the form of an increased rate of evidence accumulation in an infotaxis-like model."

After all, the drift-diffusion models are fitted to parameters of infotaxis trajectories. These fits dictate how the animals should adjust search times depending on the typical widths of food patches in the environment. While the infotaxis model predicts that local search should last longer for wider food patches, the chemotaxis model makes the opposite prediction (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). At the same time, even to set parameters of drift-diffusion models, one would need to estimate the variance of the food distribution across space. This is quite a feat for such a small animal as <i>C. elegans.</i> Further, it might be possible that <i>C. elegans</i> are capable of adjusting their behavior based on higher-than-second moments of the probability distribution. Demonstrating this would require more fine-scale experiments to control differences in both size and shape of food patches from which the animals are removed. If such sensitivities are observed, they would implicate the involvement of more complicated circuits that could be mapped onto a single drift-diffusion model. Finally, it is worth noting that the local search of <i>C. elegans</i> exhibits striking similarities to other invertebrates, such as crabs (<a href=\"#bib38\">Zeil, 1998</a>), bees (<a href=\"#bib14\">Gould, 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Dyer, 1991</a>), and ants (<a href=\"#bib35\">Wehner et al., 2002</a>). In particular, the search patterns of desert ants that have been displaced on their return to the nest (<a href=\"#bib35\">Wehner et al., 2002</a>). When arriving near the presumed location of the nest, animals follow a spiral search pattern that is consistent with infotaxis trajectories (<a href=\"#bib3\">Barbieri et al., 2011</a>). Following large displacements, ants have great difficulties finding the nest with local search patterns and transition to a strategy that is reminiscent of the global search executed by <i>C. elegans</i> (<a href=\"#bib37\">Wehner, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Wehner et al., 2006</a>). The large-scale foraging patterns in ants are difficult to study quantitatively because of the large areas involved and a few published foraging trajectories (<a href=\"#bib35\">Wehner et al., 2002</a>). Our results add to these by showing that invertebrates can integrate more abstract quantities than spatial position and operate directly on the probability that the food (or nest) is located elsewhere. Importantly, the animals do not need to perform information-theoretic calculations all of the time; instead they can set parameters of the approximating models through learning and experience."

This simple behavioral rule is able to account for multiple search strategies, as well as the emergent transitions between them. While seemingly complex, this strategy can be easily implemented in a reduced neural system. We anticipate that this principle will prove useful as a general theory of search and decision-making in a wide range of contexts."

At each step, the anticipated change in entropy was computed taking into account two possibilities: observing or not observing odorant hits. Although the initial descriptions of the model separated odorant detection events according to the number of odorant hits, in our setup (absent food source) the computation of those probabilities was numerically unstable. This is the reason why we reduce the coding to binary, either \u2018no hits\u2019 or \u2018a non-zero number of hits\u2019. As such, each change in entropy is calculated using the probability to receive a hit or the probability to receive zero hits. Computations are halted upon being within one space of the border or after no movement for 15 time steps. Trajectories are computed as in (<a href=\"#bib32\">Vergassola et al., 2007</a>).

The dependence of the drift rate on the width of food patches matches what is needed to maximize mutual information.

To briefly restate the argument here, a number of measures other than the mutual information can be used to quantify a decrease in the uncertainty of the target position during foraging. These include the variance of its probability distribution or the height of the peak of this distribution. However, mutual information is unique in that it does not assume a certain set up of the foraging problem or properties of the distribution describing the distribution of food in the environment. For example, variance as a measure is only technically valid for Gaussian probability distributions of food locations. Once the probability distribution becomes non-Gaussian (this happens often after the exploration near the initial peak of the distribution), using variance to characterize the distribution leads to misleading results. Thus, the mutual information provides a more general measure to quantify changes in the probability distribution under a variety of circumstances, although one can use other measures in specific cases."
