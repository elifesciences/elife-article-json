We found that <i>Runx1</i> is expressed in all subpopulations of murine mammary epithelial cells (MECs) except the secretory alveolar luminal cells. Conditional knockout of <i>Runx1</i> in MECs by <i>MMTV-Cre</i> led to a decrease in luminal MECs, largely due to a profound reduction in the estrogen receptor (ER)-positive mature luminal subpopulation, a phenotype that could be rescued by loss of either <i>Trp53</i> or <i>Rb1</i>. Mechanistically RUNX1 represses <i>Elf5</i>, a master regulatory TF gene for alveolar cells, and regulates mature luminal TF/co-factor genes (e.g., <i>Foxa1</i> and <i>Cited1</i>) involved in the ER program. Collectively, our data identified a key regulator of the ER<sup>+</sup> luminal lineage whose disruption may contribute to development of ER<sup>+</sup> luminal breast cancer when under the background of either <i>TP53</i> or <i>RB1</i> loss."
