                    "text": "Despite marked advances in breast cancer therapy, basal-like breast cancer (BBC), an aggressive subtype of breast cancer usually lacking estrogen and progesterone receptors, remains difficult to treat. In this study, we report the identification of MELK as a novel oncogenic kinase from an in vivo tumorigenesis screen using a kinome-wide open reading frames (ORFs) library. Analysis of clinical data reveals a high level of MELK overexpression in BBC, a feature that is largely dependent on FoxM1, a master mitotic transcription factor that is also found to be highly overexpressed in BBC. Ablation of MELK selectively impairs proliferation of basal-like, but not luminal breast cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, depletion of MELK in BBC cells induces caspase-dependent cell death, preceded by defective mitosis. Finally, we find that Melk is not required for mouse development and physiology. Together, these data indicate that MELK is a normally non-essential kinase, but is critical for BBC and thus represents a promising selective therapeutic target for the most aggressive subtype of breast cancer."

In this study, we report the identification of MELK as a novel oncogenic kinase from an in vivo tumorigenesis screen using a kinome-wide open reading frames (ORFs) library. Analysis of clinical data reveals a high level of MELK overexpression in BBC, a feature that is largely dependent on FoxM1, a master mitotic transcription factor that is also found to be highly overexpressed in BBC. Ablation of MELK selectively impairs proliferation of basal-like, but not luminal breast cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, depletion of MELK in BBC cells induces caspase-dependent cell death, preceded by defective mitosis. Finally, we find that Melk is not required for mouse development and physiology. Together, these data indicate that MELK is a normally non-essential kinase, but is critical for BBC and thus represents a promising selective therapeutic target for the most aggressive subtype of breast cancer."

Transcriptional profiling analyses have reproducibly identified at least five major \u2018intrinsic\u2019 subtypes of breast cancer: normal breast-like, luminal A, luminal B, HER2/Neu-enriched, and basal-like breast cancer (BBC) (<a href=\"#bib44\">Perou et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Sorlie et al., 2001</a>). These molecular subtypes have recently been confirmed in a comprehensive characterization of human breast tumors at the genomic, epigenetic, transcriptomic, and proteomic levels (<a href=\"#bib5a\">Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012</a>). Among these subtypes, basal-like breast cancer (BBC) is strongly associated with an aggressive phenotype and poor prognosis (<a href=\"#bib46\">Rakha et al., 2008</a>). Unlike their luminal counterparts, BBC cells lack expression of estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR). Most BBC tumors also lack expression of HER2 and thus this subtype largely overlaps with the clinically defined \u2018triple-negative\u2019 breast cancer (TNBC), which is also characterized by the lack of ER, PR, and HER2 expression (<a href=\"#bib46\">Rakha et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Foulkes et al., 2010</a>). The lack of these molecular targets renders BBC or TNBC cells relatively unresponsive to the targeted therapies that are highly effective in the treatment of luminal or HER2 positive breast cancer. Thus, establishing the molecular pathogenesis of this subtype and identifying potential targets for treatment remains a key challenge for BBC/TNBC."

Inhibitors of these kinases are effective at eradicating human cancer cells in culture and in mouse xenograft models, but their efficacy in the clinic has been limited by killing of normal proliferating cells especially the bone marrow (<a href=\"#bib9\">Dar et al., 2010</a>). If a kinase exists that is required for mitosis in a specific type of cancer cell, but not other tumor cells or in normal cells, inhibitors of that kinase might make highly effective and safe drugs.

We further demonstrate that MELK is directly regulated by the FoxM1 transcription factor, a master mitotic regulator also found to be overexpressed in BBC. We discover that MELK is essential in basal-like, but not in luminal breast cancer cells. Notably, mice in which MELK has been genetically ablated display normal development and hematopoiesis. Together, our data establish MELK as a mitosis-regulating kinase involved in the pathogenesis of BBC and a promising molecular target for patients with basal-like breast malignancy."

To this end, we first developed an in vivo tumorigenesis system that models the pathogenesis of human breast cancer, using a previously established human mammary epithelial cell (HMEC)-based transformation system (<a href=\"#bib70\">Zhao et al., 2003</a>). To further optimize this system, we engineered telomerase-immortalized HMECs to express a dominant negative form of p53 (p53DD), NeuT and PI3KCA H1047R. The resulting cells, termed HMEC-DD-NeuT-PI3KCA, were fully transformed as evaluated by their ability to form orthotopic tumors in the mammary fat pads of mice (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

The library was screened as a series of subpools of 10\u201312 kinase ORFs in HMEC-DD-NeuT cells. The infected cells were injected into the inguinal mammary fat pads of mice, and recipient mice were followed for tumor formation. Kinases in 12 pools induced tumor formation with latencies of 2\u20134 months. Genomic DNA was extracted from harvested tumor specimen as well as HMECs infected with matched pools of kinases prior to injection. We then used quantitative PCR to determine the relative abundance of each kinase in these paired samples. In total, 26 kinases were found specifically enriched in the tumors in vivo (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Several candidate kinases that scored in the screen have previously been implicated as proto-oncogenes or cancer-associated genes, such as the inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B kinase subunit epsilon (IKBKE) (<a href=\"#bib5\">Boehm et al., 2007</a>), rearranged during transfection (RET) (<a href=\"#bib55\">Takahashi et al., 1985</a>), casein kinase 1 epsilon (CSNK1E) (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kim et al., 2010</a>), NIMA-related serine/threonine kinase 6 (NEK6) (<a href=\"#bib39\">Nassirpour et al., 2010</a>), and polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) (<a href=\"#bib35\">Liu et al., 2006</a>).

We categorized samples in multiple breast cancer data sets by PAM50 gene signature (<a href=\"#bib42\">Parker et al., 2009</a>). In five independent cohorts with more than 1500 patients in total, we observed a strikingly similar pattern of MELK expression among these different subtypes of breast tumors (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). While luminal A and normal-like subtypes displayed the lowest expression of MELK, basal-like breast cancers (BBC) showed the highest expression level of MELK among all subtypes (p&lt;0.0001). Given that there are more high-grade tumors in the BBC than the other subtypes, we sought to determine the correlation of MELK with subtypes of breast tumors within the same grade. We performed statistical analysis of a large cohort of breast cancer for grade 1, 2 and 3 across all subtypes, respectively, and found that MELK is most highly expressed in BBC (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>), suggesting that MELK expression is most pronounced in basal-like breast tumors with the same pathological grade.

To confirm this observation at the protein level, we analyzed primary tumors samples for MELK expression. Strikingly, all the four ER/PR+ tumor samples lacked detectable signal of MELK expression.

Given that ER/PR expression varies within the molecular HER2+ subtype, we analyzed MELK expression within this subtype.

Because this subtype-categorization has been routinely used in the clinic for diagnosis and selection of treatment strategies, we also examined whether MELK expression correlates with this alternate subtype categorization. In two independent cohorts, the expression level of MELK is the highest in TNBC (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2I</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1G</a>).

Proteins required for mitotic progression typically accumulate during G2 and M phase, and are destroyed by ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis at the end of cytokinesis. A previous study reported that MELK is stabilized in mitosis and partially degraded upon mitotic exit in HeLa cells and <i>Xenopus</i> embryos (<a href=\"#bib1\">Badouel et al., 2010</a>). We found that, in BBC cells, MELK was highly expressed during mitosis, and its protein abundance decreased dramatically when mitotic cells progressed into G1 phase (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). This expression pattern of MELK, which is similar to that of Cyclin B1 and Aurora kinases, indicates that MELK is a mitotic kinase in BBC cells. Interestingly, while luminal breast cancer cells have a similar pattern of MELK expression during cell cycle, their MELK protein levels in the M phase are much lower than those of BBC cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>). The expression levels of other mitotic factors including Cyclin B1 and Aurora A are comparable between basal-like and luminal cancer cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>), suggesting that MELK may play a unique role during mitosis in BBC cells."

This is consistent with the expression pattern of MELK in primary human breast tumors. We also confirmed that the protein abundance of MELK is much higher in BBC cells compared to luminal cells (MCF7 and T47D) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>).

Among the multiple inducible shRNAs that we generated to target MELK, two shRNAs were found to efficiently reduce MELK expression in cells treated with doxycycline (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). We then stably introduced both shMELKs into basal or luminal breast cancer cell lines. Cell proliferation was measured upon induction of the shRNA in the presence of doxycycline. As hypothesized, MELK knockdown strongly impaired the growth of all six BBC cell lines tested, including BT549, MDA-MB-468, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-436, HCC70, and HCC1954 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,D</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). In contrast, in five luminal breast cell lines, MELK knockdown with equivalent efficiency did not result in obvious inhibition on cell growth (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). Similarly, MELK knockdown had little effect on non-transformed HMECs, which have low level of MELK expression (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

We found that the proliferation of MDA-MB-468 cells expressing shMELK was restored, when the MELK expression level in these cells was rescued by expression of a shMELK-resistant allele of MELK (MELK-R) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), confirming that the effects of shRNA are due to the specific knockdown of MELK. Notably, expression of a kinase inactive version of MELK-R, MELK-R (T167A), failed to restore cell proliferation in these cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>), indicating that kinase activity of MELK is critical for the proliferation of these BBC cells."

In the presence of doxycycline, BBC cells underwent cell death indicated by increased apoptotic markers, including cleaved caspase 3, cleaved PARP, and DNA fragmentation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). zVad, a pan-caspase inhibitor, was able to rescue cell death, indicating an active role of caspases in executing cell death upon MELK depletion (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). In contrast, MELK knockdown has little effect on luminal tumor cells, such as MCF7 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). To complement our RNAi-mediated MELK knockdown studies, we used a recently developed chemical inhibitor of MELK, OTSSP167 (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chung et al., 2012</a>), to evaluate the functional dependency on MELK by basal and luminal breast cancer cells. Consistently, OTSSP167 induced apoptotic cell death selectively in basal breast cancer cells (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2A\u2013C</a>)."

Cell death events were dramatically increased upon MELK knockdown (5 out of 235 cells in control, 151 out of 317 in doxycycline-treated cells during 10 hr of imaging). Moreover, cell death events were often preceded by division abnormalities in doxycycline-treated populations. Cells with double nuclei, which had presumably failed cytokinesis, often underwent cell death (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6H</a>, middle panel; <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). Some cells with an apparently normal metaphase plate were unable to progress towards anaphase, instead entering into the process of cell death directly from mitosis (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6H</a>, bottom panel; <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>). Overall, following MELK knockdown, out of 27 examples we noted 16 failed mitoses among which 10 proceeded to cell death after the formation of metaphase plate and six gave rise to binucleated cells. By contrast, mitosis in 36 out of a total of 37 control cells appeared normal (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6H</a>, top panel; <a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a>). The morphological events associated with failed cell division and ensuing cell death resembled the previous reports of the effects of inhibiting essential mitotic kinase such as Aurora B (<a href=\"#bib25\">Keen and Taylor, 2009</a>). Together, these data suggest a model in which BBC cells rely on MELK for proper mitosis; inhibiting MELK in these cells causes impaired mitosis and consequent cell death."

While MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-231 cells readily grew into macroscopic colonies in soft agar, MELK knockdown in these cells upon doxycycline treatment caused a nearly complete inhibition in colony formation (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). To determine whether MELK is also important for BBC cells to grow as tumors in vivo, we transplanted BBC cells expressing inducible shMELK into the mammary fat pads of athymic mice to allow orthotopic tumor formation. While all recipient mice in the control group without doxycycline treatment developed tumors within 2 months, mice treated with doxycycline immediately following transplantation failed to develop tumors (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>), suggesting that MELK is required for the proliferation of these BBC cells in vivo. To further examine whether MELK is required for the maintenance of established tumors, we administered doxycycline to mice bearing xenograft tumors derived from basal-like or luminal breast cancer cells. Remarkably, down-regulation of MELK led to a substantial regression of tumors arising from BBC cells but had little effect on tumors derived from luminal cancer cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C,D</a>, <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

This question is critical to the toxicity of any potential MELK-targeted therapy. To address this question, we generated mice with germ-line knockout (KO) of Melk (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7G</a>). Notably, Melk-deficient mice are viable and appear normal without any noticeable phenotypes in the development of the embryos or adult mice. Both male and female mice are fertile and produce litters of normal size. A study by Hebbard et al. found a high activity of Melk promoter in mouse mammary progenitor cells (<a href=\"#bib19\">Hebbard et al., 2010</a>). Therefore, we anticipated an impairment of mammary gland development in Melk KO mice. However, mammary glands from mice with Melk KO appear normal in both morphology and function (e.g., lactation)."

We also analyzed the hematopoietic stem cells and various progenitor cells in the bone marrow. In both cases, virtually no differences were found between wild-type and KO mice (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7H,I</a>).

In this study, we report that MELK, a novel oncogenic kinase that emerged from an unbiased, in vivo tumorigenesis screen, may indeed be a therapeutic target in this tumor type. In a comprehensive analysis of databases with multiple cohorts of breast cancer, we find MELK to be highly overexpressed in breast cancer lacking the expression of ER/PR, including basal-like breast cancer. Remarkably, overexpression of wild-type MELK induces robust oncogenic transformation both in vitro and in vivo with a transforming potency comparable to that of the highly oncogenic mutant allele of PIK3CA. Even more striking is the finding that only basal-like, but not luminal breast cancer cells, depend on MELK for proliferation. In addition, the dispensable nature of Melk in normal development and hematopoiesis in mice underlines its selective role in BBC. Notably, the kinase activity of MELK is required for its transforming activity as well as for the survival and proliferation of BBC cells. Thus, MELK is potentially a novel oncogenic driver of basal-like breast carcinoma and a promising target for small molecule-based therapeutic intervention."

In multiple independent breast cancer cohorts analyzed, we found a strong association of high expression levels of MELK with a higher grade of malignancy and an unfavorable prognosis regardless of the treatment modality. While high MELK expression seems to be a unique phenomenon for BBC in breast cancer, MELK overexpression has been associated with tumor aggressiveness and poor outcome in a number of other cancer types, including glioblastoma (<a href=\"#bib39a\">Nakano et al., 2008</a>), astrocytoma (<a href=\"#bib38a\">Marie et al., 2008</a>), and prostate cancer (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kuner et al., 2013</a>). The prognostic feature of MELK expression is likely due to its correlation with cell proliferation. In fact, MELK and other proliferation-related genes are major components of multi-gene signature for predicting disease outcome. For example, a recent study developed a cell proliferation signature that consists of the top 1% genes whose expression is most positively correlated with that of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). The authors found that adjusting breast cancer expression data for this cell proliferation signature causes a dramatic reduction in outcome association of most published breast cancer signatures (<a href=\"#bib61\">Venet et al., 2011</a>). Notably, MELK expression strongly correlates with cell proliferation, and in fact is one of the top-ranking signature genes of cell proliferation that correlate with PCNA expression (<a href=\"#bib61\">Venet et al., 2011</a>)."

Consistent with these findings, overexpression of wild-type MELK readily drives transformation in vitro and in vivo. This behavior is similar to that of other established proto-oncoproteins, such ERBB2 (<a href=\"#bib12\">Di Fiore et al., 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Hudziak et al., 1987</a>), and Aurora A kinase (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bischoff et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Zhou et al., 1998</a>), the transforming activity of which is driven by overexpression of the wild-type protein.

Notably, the expression levels of FoxM1 and MELK demonstrate a striking correlation across all breast cancer samples and subtypes examined. Like MELK, FoxM1 is significantly overexpressed in BBC.

MELK was not observed as a hit in systematic screens for essential cell division proteins in HeLa cells (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kittler et al., 2004</a>). Both <i>C. elegans</i> and mice are tolerant of mutation or deletion of MELK ortholog (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cordes et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7G\u2013I</a>). However, MELK can be essential in some circumstances. It is expressed in early frog embryos, where it seems to play some role in cell division (<a href=\"#bib30\">Le Page et al., 2011</a>), and we observed it accumulating in dividing cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>), and playing an important role during cell division in BBC cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). To reconcile these apparently disparate findings, we propose that one or more MELK-related kinase is required for cell division in many, if not all vertebrate cells. In BBC cells, MELK must play this role uniquely and is selectively overexpressed, perhaps because redundant kinases are down-regulated. In other cells, MELK may function during division, but it is not essential due to redundancy with related kinases. Consistent with this hypothesis, the MELK-related kinase AMPK was recently shown to play a role in mitosis (<a href=\"#bib60\">Vazquez-Martin et al., 2009</a>). Perhaps AMPK, or other kinases in the same family, can substitute for MELK in some cells, but not in BBC cells, which seem to have become addicted to MELK for proper execution of cell division. Determining the precise function of MELK in cell division, and the reason this function is selectively required in BBC cells, will require further analysis. Nevertheless, our studies firmly establish MELK as a molecular target for the treatment of BBC. Unlike other mitotic factors like Aurora A, Aurora B, and PLK1, that are normally essential, MELK presents a unique mitotic kinase that is only required by a subset of cancer cells, and is therefore an excellent therapeutic target."

In contrast, the relative uniform overexpression of MELK in basal-like breast cancer makes it a potential common target in an otherwise heterogeneous disease. Thus our data on MELK provide important information for guiding the development of targeted therapies in basal-like breast cancer."

Knockdown of MELK impaired the proliferation of basal cell lines, but had less effect on luminal cell lines, with some caveats (see below). Moreover, MELK knockdown caused tumor regression in xenografts of basal cell lines, but had a more modest effect on xenografts of luminal cell lines. In rescue experiments, kinase-dead MELK was incapable of preventing the toxicity of MELK knockdown. MELK knockdown prevented mitotic progression, leading frequently to apoptosis in basal cell lines. High expression of MELK was correlated with expression of the transcription factor FOXM1. The authors conclude that MELK is a therapeutic target for basal breast cancer, although there is no discussion of the role of MELK in normal cell division and what side effects a MELK inhibitor might be expected to have."

This selectivity is necessary in order to propose that MELK might deserve attention as a target for therapeutic development. The proposed selectivity of MELK for basal breast cancer cells is difficult to reconcile with an essential role for MELK in diverse proliferation systems, including Xenopus oocytes, C. elegans and various proliferating progenitor populations in the mouse (Hebbard et al. Cancer Research 2010 70:8863 and references therein). Indeed, Hebbard et al previously showed that MELK is required for breast cancer tumor initiating cells in a mouse breast cancer model, a fact that is not cited by the authors. Functional studies were restricted to 2 basal and 2 luminal cell lines, so it is difficult to generalize from this small sample set. Moreover, it is unclear whether the knockdown of MELK was equivalent in these experiments between the basal and luminal cell lines since the Western blots were not quantified."

Getting functional effects by knocking down kinases can be difficult given their enzymatic nature. It could be that the degree of knockdown of MELK in the luminal cell lines did not go below a necessary threshold to cause a proliferation effect. <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a> demonstrates that two different MELK shRNAs that have modest differences in their degree of knockdown have very large differences in their effect on proliferation. For these studies to be strengthened, several more cell lines of each type need to be examined and equivalent knockdown needs to be demonstrated by both quantitative protein and mRNA analysis. The xenograft study suffers from the same caveats. In <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2013figure supplement 1</a>, the degree of knockdown in the luminal cell lines was not as great as in the one basal cell line presented, which could explain the difference in effect on tumor growth. These xenograft experiments should be repeated under conditions in which MELK knockdown is equivalent, ideally with additional luminal and basal cell lines."

The authors used a cDNA kinome transformation screen method previously developed in their lab to identify MELK as a potential oncogene. They provided evidence that MELK expression is elevated in BCC and depletion of MELK in BCC cells leads to mitotic defects. Untransformed breast epithelial cells are insensitive to MELK depletion due to low expression levels. These findings indicate that MELK could be a potential target for BCC and other cancer types that show high levels of MELK expression. The data presented in the manuscript is generally of high quality. Previous studies characterizing MELK expression in triple negative breast cancer and other aggressive tumor types somewhat diminish the novelty of this work. The authors showed that the transcription factor FoxM1, which positively regulates MELK expression, is also upregulated in BCC, although the mechanism by which this happens is unclear."

Have the authors also looked at whether MELK over-expression in HMEC-DD or HMEC-DD-NeuT cells affect their cell cycle and proliferation rate? In xenopus embryo both the loss and over-expression of MELK causes mitotic defects.

A recent study from Dr. Joe Gray\u2019s group has systemically analyzed doubling time among 49 breast cancer cell lines. Indeed, basal breast cancer cells have a statistically shorter doubling time (Figure S3A, Heiser et al., 2012). However, we would like to point out that untransformed cells such as HMEC and MCF-10A have much lower expression of levels of MELK than basal breast cancer cells, but have a very similar doubling times. Therefore, it is difficult to conclude on a universal correlation between MELK expression and the rate of cell proliferation."

The criteria applied might explain why MELK was not identified as a breast cancer essential gene. The top-ranked genes from the screens were selected and overlapped against two sets of genes that are likely enriched in essential genes (housekeeping genes (n=1,722), and genes with highly conserved orthologs in eight species (n=1,617)). Interestingly, MELK is not such a housekeeping genes (defined here as expressing in more than 73 of 79 tissues in a human expression compendium), or highly conserved (e.g., MELK ortholog has not been identified in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>)."

The authors' data indicate that not all proliferating cells require MELK, as knockdown of MELK in MCF7, T47D and HMECs does not impair proliferation. Have the authors investigated whether MELK knockdown in these insensitive cells affect their cell cycle distribution?

We now have performed experiments and found that neither MELK knockdown, nor MELK overexpression in untransformed HMECs alters cell cycle or proliferation as assayed in regular tissue culture. However, the information acquired from regular two-dimensional culturing might not be directly applied to the process of cell transformation, which is typically assayed in three-dimensional conditions. Indeed, when we assessed these cells in suspension culture, overexpression of MELK significantly increased the proliferation of HMEC cells (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2013figure supplement 1A</a>). Likewise, MELK overexpression induces colony formation in soft agar (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2013figure supplement 1C</a>). Further study is needed to address the correlation of the transforming activity of MELK overexpression with cell cycle."

In contrast, the relative uniform overexpression of MELK in basal-like breast cancer makes this gene a unique target if its functional importance can be established. Thus our studies on MELK are critical for guiding the development of targeted therapies in basal-like breast cancer."

We are very enthusiastic about this finding, and believe that our work will have enormous impact on guiding the development of therapy for basal-like breast cancer, the most aggressive subtype of breast cancer lacking any proven targeted therapy. In addition, as mentioned by the reviewers, MELK over-expression has been associated with tumor aggressiveness and poor prognosis in several other cancer types, including melanoma, glioblastoma and prostate cancer, though functional studies are lacking. Thus MELK represents a highly promising therapeutic target for BBC and potentially other aggressive tumors."
