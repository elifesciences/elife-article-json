In yeast, partitioning of such circles to the mother cell at mitosis ensures their loss from the population but promotes replicative ageing. Nevertheless, the mechanisms of partitioning are debated. In this study, we show that the SAGA complex mediates the interaction of non-chromosomal DNA circles with nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) and thereby promotes their confinement in the mother cell. Reciprocally, this causes retention and accumulation of NPCs, which affects the organization of ageing nuclei. Thus, SAGA prevents the spreading of DNA circles by linking them to NPCs, but unavoidably causes accumulation of circles and NPCs in the mother cell, and thereby promotes ageing. Together, our data provide a unifying model for the asymmetric segregation of DNA circles and how age affects nuclear organization."

For each daughter cell that buds, the mother cell loses some fitness and eventually dies after a certain number of budding events. This process is called \u2018replicative ageing\u2019, and it also resembles the way that stem cells age.

When recombination involves two homologous chromosomes, the resolution of the Holliday junction leads to a cross-over, the exchange of arms between two chromosomes, in 50% of the cases (<a href=\"#bib30\">Heyer, 2004</a>). However, when recombination occurs between two loci on the same chromosome, i.e. if the break affects a repeated region of the genome, recombination is intra-chromosomal. In 50% of these events, the resolution of the Holliday junction leads to the excision of a DNA circle containing one or several of the involved repeats (<a href=\"#bib21\">Gaubatz, 1990</a>). Accordingly, due to the highly repeated nature of the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) locus, rDNA circles have been found in all eukaryotes tested so far (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cohen et al., 2010</a>). Similarly, double-minute, satellite- and t-circles, as well as a multitude of micro DNAs have been identified in animal cells (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cohen and Segal, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Shibata et al., 2012</a>). However, how cells react to these molecules is not understood.

Indeed, the asymmetry of the budding process generates a mother and a daughter cell with distinct sizes and fate. While most daughter cells are born young, i.e. with a full replicative potential, mother cells age with each budding cycle and therefore generate only a limited number of daughter cells ((<a href=\"#bib48\">Mortimer and Johnston, 1959</a>) and reviewed in (<a href=\"#bib15\">Denoth Lippuner et al., 2014</a>)). Since rDNA circles contain a replication origin they duplicate in S-phase, and due to the asymmetric segregation they accumulate with time in the mother cell. Several arguments indicate that they contribute to replicative ageing of these mother cells. Artificially introducing an ERC into the bud reduces its life span (<a href=\"#bib59\">Sinclair and Guarente, 1997</a>). Likewise, mutations that enhance ERC formation shorten the longevity of mother cells (<a href=\"#bib36\">Kaeberlein et al., 1999</a>). Conversely, mutant cells with reduced rates of ERC formation, such as <i>fob1\u2206</i>, or those defective in ERC retention, such as <i>bud6\u2206</i> mutant cells, live longer (<a href=\"#bib14\">Defossez et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Shcheprova et al., 2008</a>). Interestingly, any artificial circle that replicates in vivo but lacks a partitioning sequence (e.g. a centromere) segregates similarly and promotes replicative ageing when introduced into yeast (<a href=\"#bib18\">Falcon and Aris, 2003</a>). Thus, non-chromosomal DNA circles segregate asymmetrically, affect cellular physiology, and promote ageing in a manner that is independent of their DNA sequence. How these DNA circles contribute to ageing is not known."

                        "text": "One approach to characterize the effects of DNA circles on cellular physiology is to study the mechanism of their segregation. Two models have been proposed to explain the retention of circular DNA molecules in the mother cells (<a href=\"#bib51\">Ouellet and Barral, 2012</a>). The morpho-kinetic model proposes that circles freely diffuse in the nucleus and that their retention results from the morphology of the dividing yeast nucleus and the short duration of anaphase, which together limit the probability that DNA circles diffuse into the bud (<a href=\"#bib22\">Gehlen et al., 2011</a>). Using measured parameters for nuclear geometry and division speed, this model predicts a retention frequency of 0.75\u20130.90 per individual plasmid. However, mathematical modeling indicates that observed ageing curves require retention frequencies above 0.99 per individual ERC (<a href=\"#bib23\">Gillespie et al., 2004</a>), which is higher than what the morpho-kinetic model can achieve. A second model, the barrier model, is based on the observation that a lateral diffusion barrier in the outer membrane of the nuclear envelope impedes the diffusion of membrane proteins through the bud neck and hence their exchange between mother and bud parts of the nucleus (<a href=\"#bib57\">Shcheprova et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Boettcher et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Clay et al., 2014</a>). This model proposes that DNA circles attach to a receptor in the nuclear envelope to ensure their subsequent confinement into the mother cell by the lateral diffusion barrier (<a href=\"#bib57\">Shcheprova et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Clay et al., 2014</a>)."

However, no such mechanism is known yet. Whether DNA circles passively diffuse or are recognized by the cell would be predicted to have distinct consequences on the localization of the circles and their effects on nuclear organization. A passive model predicts that DNA circles do not interact specifically with any nuclear structure. Therefore, their accumulation should have little impact on nuclear organization. On the other hand, if cells recognize DNA circles, accumulating circles would increasingly interact with the corresponding structure and should progressively affect its size and organization. Thus, in order to better understand whether and how DNA circles are recognized by the cell, and to shed light on how they interfere with cellular physiology, we investigated how accumulating DNA circles localize and whether they affect nuclear organization."

In cells expressing a TetR-mCherry fusion protein, which binds the TetO sequence, the plasmid is observed as a focus of red fluorescence. Additionally, the plasmid contains an excisable centromere, leading to the formation of a labeled non-centromeric DNA circle upon expression of the R-recombinase. The plasmid also contains two auxotrophic selection markers: <i>URA3</i> located between the two recombination-sites to select against accidental centromere excision and <i>LEU2</i> on the residual backbone, allowing selection for the plasmid after centromere excision. In budding yeast, all centromeres co-localize with spindle pole bodies (SPBs) throughout the cell cycle (<a href=\"#bib24\">Goshima and Yanagida, 2000</a>). Accordingly, we observe the centromeric plasmid in close proximity to the SPBs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). 3 hr after addition of estradiol to induce centromere excision, plasmids are localized away from the SPBs in 68% of the cells. Most of those cells displayed one or two small plasmid foci (61% or 33%, respectively; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) and only 6% of the cells showed more than two foci. These foci were on average 2.5 times more intense than the nucleoplasmic background (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>) and localized to the vicinity of the nuclear rim (see below, and Figure 5)."

In most cases, the accumulated DNA circles localized adjacent to, but were excluded from, the nucleolus (Fob1-GFP; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Accordingly, they localized opposite to the SPB. Labeling of the nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) indicated that the nuclei loaded with DNA circles were larger than those with no or few circles (average volume increased 1.7-fold; N = 50 cells). Remarkably, accumulation of DNA circles drastically affected the NPC distribution. The circle-loaded cells contained on an average 2.7-fold more nuclear pores compared to cells without plasmids (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). This increase was independent of the NPC reporter used (Nup82-3sfGFP, 2.7-folds, N = 50 cells; Nup82-GFP, 2.6-fold, N = 25 cells; Nup49-GFP, 3.0-fold, N = 25 cells, p &lt; 0.001; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>) and was exclusively observed in the cells that contained DNA circles. Five generations old wild-type cells lacking plasmids did not show such changes (see Figure 9). Most strikingly, NPC distribution over the nuclear envelope was no-longer uniform; a substantial fraction of the NPCs accumulated in a single cap that covered one side of the nucleus (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,C</a>). In all cells, this cap covered the DNA circles. Furthermore, all circle-loaded cells exhibited such a cap. As a consequence, the fluorescence intensity of Nup82-3sfGFP was on an average two-fold higher in the vicinity of the circles (Ic = 2.02 \u00b1 0.80 A.U.) compared with the rest of the nucleus (Ir = 1.0 \u00b1 0.35 A.U., N = 50 cells, p &lt; 0.001; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). In time-lapse movies (5 min intervals for 60 min), the cap and the mCherry patch moved together (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>, <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>), suggesting that DNA circles and the NPC cap were linked to each other. Thus, the accumulated circles failed to randomly diffuse in the nucleoplasm. Instead, they appeared to interact with some structure in the nuclear envelope, and thereby affected the morphology of the nucleus."

While all dividing cells formed two daughter nuclei of different sizes, the mother nucleus being generally larger, this asymmetry was enhanced in cells with accumulated circles (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Furthermore, the density of NPCs was increased in these mother nuclei (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Together, this results in an increase in the asymmetry of NPC segregation in circle-loaded cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). Mother cells containing accumulated plasmids retained a larger fraction of their NPCs (median = 78%, N = 50), compared to cells containing no circles (63%, N = 50 cells, p &lt; 0.001). Interestingly, in these cells both the TetR-mCherry signal and the GFP cap localized to the vicinity of the nuclear bridge linking mother and bud lobes of the dividing nucleus on its mother side (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1A and 2A</a> and <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). Only in very rare cases a fraction of the plasmid mass passed to the bud (2%, N &gt; 50 cells). Qualitatively, the same effects were observed when using Nup82-3sfGFP, Nup82-GFP or Nup49-GFP as reporters. Irrespective of plasmid accumulation, tagging Nup49 slightly enhanced NPC retention (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>), as previously reported (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chadrin et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Makio et al., 2013</a>). Consistent with resulting from DNA circle accumulation, cells in which the centromere was not excised from the plasmid and untransformed cells of a similar age did not show such NPC distribution and segregation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> and see below). Together, these data indicate that the accumulation of non-chromosomal DNA circles affects the size of the nucleus, the organization of the nuclear envelope, and causes the mitotic retention of NPCs in yeast mother cells.

SAGA's function in chromatin anchorage to NPCs involves TREX-2, a multiprotein complex that localizes to nuclear pores, facilitates mRNA export, and physically interacts with SAGA (<a href=\"#bib19\">Fischer et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Rodriguez-Navarro et al., 2004</a>). Thus, we examined whether TREX-2 also contributed to circle retention. Inactivation of the core TREX-2 gene, <i>SAC3</i>, caused circles to propagate to the bud 3 times more frequently than in wild-type cells, i.e. at a frequency similar to SAGA defective cells (pf = 11.5 \u00b1 3.0, N = 3 clones, p &lt; 0.001; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Deletion of <i>SUS1,</i> which inactivates both SAGA and TREX-2 complexes (<a href=\"#bib52\">Pascual-Garcia and Rodriguez-Navarro, 2009</a>), and deleting both the <i>GCN5</i> and <i>SAC3</i> genes led to similar effects (pf = 11.3 \u00b1 1.4, N = 3 clones, p &lt; 0.001 and pf = 11.1 \u00b1 1.3, N = 3 clones p &lt; 0.001, respectively), indicating that the effects of inactivating SAGA and TREX-2 were not additive.

In order to investigate this possibility, we first tested whether individual non-centromeric plasmids co-localize with nuclear pores and whether this required SAGA function. Consistent with this idea, the vast majority of non-centromeric circles localized to the nuclear rim in wild-type cells: only 15% (\u00b12.8%) of plasmid foci were at a resolvable distance from the nuclear envelope (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>).

To determine whether the plasmids localizing to the periphery co-localized with the nuclear pores, Nup82-3sfGFP intensity traces (N &gt; 50 cells) were measured along the nuclear envelope in equatorial focal sections of the nuclei containing a single labeled acentric DNA circle at the rim. High LED-based illumination and fast image acquisition minimized blur due to NPC movement. Aligning all traces with the position of the DNA circle showed that the average Nup82-3sfGFP intensity increased in the vicinity of the circle compared to elsewhere (+33.2% \u00b1 0.09%, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>).

We reasoned that the first set of observations is expected if circles are already tethered to the same NPCs by SAGA. To better understand the effect of the two other fusion proteins, we first investigated whether they localized stably at NPCs, using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP; <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Indeed, anchorage would require a stable interaction, whereas at least Nup2 has been reported to shuttle between NPCs and the nucleoplasm (<a href=\"#bib16\">Dilworth et al., 2001</a>). Accordingly, we found that both Nup2 and Mlp1, as well as Nup60, diffuse more rapidly than the core nucleoporins Nup1, Nup49, and Nup170, at least during anaphase (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>), indicating that their residence at NPCs is transitory. Remarkably, the stable association of nucleoporins with NPCs was highly correlated with their ability to mediate circle retention (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>).

However, it largely bypassed the need for Sgf73 (pf = 6.1 \u00b1 1.3 with Gcn5-Sac3 and 6.8 \u00b1 2.0 with Spt7-Nup49, compared to 11.8 \u00b1 1.6 in <i>sgf73\u2206</i> cells) and <i>Sus</i>1 (pf = 6.5 \u00b1 1.3 with Gcn5-Sac3 and 5.6 \u00b1 0.2 with Spt7-Nup49, compared to 11.3 \u00b1 1.4 in <i>sus1\u2206</i> cells, N = 3 clones, p &lt; 0.001). Thus, the main function of Sgf73 and <i>Sus</i>1 in plasmid retention is to physically link SAGA to nuclear pores. These data establish that SAGA needs to be at NPCs in order to function in circle retention."

Both SAGA components were strongly enriched in the plasmid area, indicating that SAGA interacts more readily with non-chromosomal DNA than with the rest of the genome (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). Accordingly, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments (N = 5 independent experiments) reproducibly showed a clear enrichment of the SAGA proteins Gcn5 and Spt20 on a non-centromeric reporter plasmid (pYB1670/CEN-), as judged by probing for the autonomous replication sequence (ARS) and two non-coding sequences of bacterial origin. Strikingly, this enrichment was nearly lost (p &lt; 0.05) when the same plasmid contained a centromere (CEN+; <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). Thus, SAGA is recruited to higher levels on non-centromeric than on centromeric DNA circles. Together, these data indicate that SAGA more stably associates with non-chromosomal than with chromosomal DNA."

We concluded that SAGA mediates both circle clustering and the formation of the NPC cap. Accordingly, in FLIP experiments the fluorescence decayed homogenously over the entire nuclear envelope, whether they contained circles or not (t<sub>50</sub> = 46 \u00b1 9.1 s for <i>gcn5\u2206</i> and 41 \u00b1 6.7 s for <i>sgf73\u2206</i> mutant cells; <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>), as in wild-type cells devoid of circles (t<sub>50</sub> = 35 \u00b1 5.9 s). Thus, SAGA-dependent attachment of non-centromeric DNA circles substantially, and specifically, reduces the mobility of the corresponding NPCs. These data establish two points. First, in circle-free exponentially growing cells only very few NPCs, if any, are stably attached to and slowed down by chromatin. Second, NPCs that are attached to DNA circles show very slow dynamics, possibly explaining their enhanced retention in the mother cell during mitosis."

We reasoned that, if ERCs rely on an interaction with NPCs for their retention in the mother cell, then the NPCs attached to these ERCs should also be retained and accumulate with age. To test this possibility, we monitored nuclear pores in ageing cells using Nup49-, Nup170-, or Nup82-GFP fusion proteins as a reporter. To allow imaging them throughout their lifespan, the cells were grown in a microfluidic device (<a href=\"#bib39\">Lee et al., 2012</a>) that selectively retains the mother cells, due to their larger size, while their daughter cells are removed by the medium flow. Transmission pictures were taken for 64 hr at 20 min intervals, providing information about the age of all cells present (<a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). In addition, 2h fluorescence movies at 15 min intervals were recorded after 48 hr and 64 hr. At both time points, the original cells and some coincidentally trapped cells born in the chip were present, allowing simultaneous monitoring of pores in cells of different ages (ranging from 0 to 38 generations; <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>). Strikingly, a large majority of the aged cells showed a non-uniform distribution of NPCs on the nuclear surface. A substantial fraction of very old cells formed an even more intense cap (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>). These cells divided maximally three more times before dying. Thus, cap formation was observed upon ageing in wild-type cells."

On the contrary, occasionally an increased amount of nuclear pores was also observed in daughter cells of old mother cells (&gt;15 generations; <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C</a>).

Therefore, we next wondered whether these cells lived longer. Using microdissection, the lifespan of cells lacking Gcn5 and Spt20, a structural component of the SAGA complex, as well as Sgf73, linking SAGA to TREX-2, was determined. Wild-type cells showed a median lifespan of 27 generations, whereas the <i>sgf73\u2206</i> mutant cells lived 60% longer, (44 generations, N = 150 cells, p &lt; 0.001; <a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11A</a> (<a href=\"#bib55\">Schleit et al., 2013</a>)). Strikingly, <i>gcn5\u2206</i> and <i>spt20\u2206</i> mutant cells did not show an increased longevity (27 and 17 generations, N = 50\u2013150 cells; <a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11A</a>). Since SAGA is involved in many cellular processes, we wondered whether the observed lifespan was the result of a balance between the advantages and disadvantages of losing Gcn5 and Spt20. We rationalized that if this was the case, the longevity of these mutant cells would be limited by other factors than ERC accumulation, and thus decreasing ERC formation should not increase the longevity of these cells. Accordingly, removal of Fob1 failed to extend the lifespan of the <i>gcn5\u2206</i> mutant cells (median lifespan of <i>gcn5\u2206 fob1\u2206</i> double mutant cells = 27 generations, N = 150 cells; <a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11B</a>) and <i>spt20\u2206</i> mutant cells (<i>spt20\u2206 fob1\u2206</i> = 16 generations, N = 75 cells; <a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11C</a>). Decreased ERC accumulation in <i>gcn5\u0394</i> mutant cells, as suggested by our Southern Blot experiments, and in <i>gcn5\u0394 fob1\u0394</i> double mutant cells did not prolong lifespan of these cells, suggesting that these cells die of reasons independent of ERC accumulation. Additionally, the fact that we observed increased ERC formation in cells lacking Gcn5 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>) but not a shorter lifespan suggests that indeed the increased ERC formation is compensated by poor circle retention in the mother cells. Thus, cells lacking Gcn5 and Spt20 age through mechanisms independent of ERC formation and accumulation."

The fact that <i>sgf73\u0394</i> mutant cells show reduced ERC formation probably contributes to this phenotype (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a> and (<a href=\"#bib45\">McCormick et al., 2014</a>)). However, the rate of ERC formation is similar in <i>fob1\u2206</i> and <i>sgf73\u2206</i> mutant cells, yet the <i>fob1\u2206</i> mutation has a much more modest effect on lifespan (32 generations) than <i>sgf73\u2206</i> (44 generations). Therefore, Sgf73 also contributes to ageing by additional mechanisms beyond reducing ERC formation. To test whether Sgf73 promotes ageing via the retention of ERCs and NPCs in the ageing cell, we asked whether targeting SAGA back to NPCs restored ageing in the <i>sgf73\u2206</i> mutant cells. Expression of the fusion proteins Gcn5-Sac3 and Spt7-Nup49 did not alter the longevity of the wild-type cells (27 generations, N = 50 cells; <a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11D</a>).

Therefore, we conclude that decreased levels of SAGA at pores largely contribute to the extended lifespan observed in <i>sgf73\u2206</i> cells. Based on the data presented here, we further conclude that SAGA promotes ageing, at least in part, through promoting the anchorage of non-chromosomal DNA circles to NPCs and promoting their joint retention and accumulation with age. Furthermore, non-chromosomal DNA circles alone do not accumulate and do not promote ageing if they are not at NPCs."

First, we propose that both morpho-kinetic parameters (<a href=\"#bib22\">Gehlen et al., 2011</a>) as well as tethering to NPCs are required for efficient circle retention in vivo. The morpho-kinetic constraints provide the baseline for circle retention and ensure that unattached plasmids are still fairly well retained, as observed in SAGA defective cells (this study) or for unattached episomes (<a href=\"#bib22\">Gehlen et al., 2011</a>). Above this baseline, the barrier-tether mechanism further tightens circle retention to achieve high fidelity. Indeed, supporting this model mutations that prolong anaphase (<i>yku70\u2206</i>) and mutations that weaken the nuclear diffusion barrier without prolonging anaphase (<i>bud6\u2206</i>) both affect circle retention. Second, we propose that tight confinement of the circles by the diffusion barrier requires the attachment of the circles to NPCs. Indeed, what the barrier efficiently retains in the mother cell is neither NPCs alone nor the unbound circles but rather the circle-bound NPCs. Accordingly, anchorage of the circles to NPCs strongly enhances the retention of both NPCs and circles."

Although NPC attachment had already been proposed to mediate the retention of DNA circles (<a href=\"#bib57\">Shcheprova et al., 2008</a>), the observation that NPCs were themselves inefficiently retained in exponentially growing cells strongly argued against this model (<a href=\"#bib37\">Khmelinskii et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Colombi et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Menendez-Benito et al., 2013</a>). Populations of exponentially growing cells are primarily composed of young cells, with only about 5% of the cells having divided more than three times. Since only very few, if any, young cells contain an ERC or other DNA circle, our model accounts well for why most exponentially growing cells only weakly retain NPCs in the mother cell."

First, it might result from the reduced mobility of the circle-bound NPCs, which necessarily reduces the frequency at which they approach the barrier, and therefore their chance of passing it. This reduced mobility may be due to the drag that attached plasmids might oppose to NPCs. In addition, it might be exacerbated by the propensity of circle-bound NPCs to cluster, by a yet unknown mechanism. Alternatively, post-translational modifications of the NPC, perhaps by SAGA, may affect the interaction of the NPC with myosin and actin (<a href=\"#bib60\">Steinberg et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Colombi et al., 2013</a>) or with the lipids in the envelope, impeding their dynamics. Second, the barrier might be selective. Previous data have established that the barrier has a much larger impact on large entities than on small ones. Remodeling and clustering of the NPCs might interfere particularly strongly with their ability to pass the barrier."

Indeed, ageing cells accumulate circles with increasing speed. When the circles cannot attach or when the diffusion barrier is defective, the morpho-kinetic model still promotes a retention level of about 88\u201385%. However, our data indicate that the loss of 12\u201315% of the circles per division cycle has a substantial impact on ERC accumulation and the longevity of the cells, the <i>bud6\u2206</i> and the <i>sgf73\u2206</i> mutant cells being remarkably long-lived. This large impact on longevity for apparently small defects in retention is fully in line with the idea that high-fidelity retention is a crucial parameter, as predicted by in silico simulations (<a href=\"#bib23\">Gillespie et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Shcheprova et al., 2008</a>)."

SAGA might modify chromatin or some chromatin-binding component of the NPC and thereby regulate the interaction of specific DNA pieces with the pore. Alternatively, it may function itself as a physical tether. Although our data do not allow any definitive conclusion, it is remarkable that SAGA needs to be both on the NPC and on the chromatin to mediate its function in circle attachment to pores. Thus, we favor the idea that SAGA is an integral part of the tether. The fact that its acetyl transferase activity is also needed for its function might reflect a dual role of SAGA, both as a tether and as a regulator of tethering. Identifying the acetylation targets of SAGA and the role of these modifications in circle retention are now required in order to address how SAGA facilitates chromatin anchorage to NPCs."

Together with the current knowledge, the identification of SAGA as a player in this process suggests an explanation for this observation. The SAGA complex, which associates broadly with chromatin and interacts with every expressed sequence (<a href=\"#bib50\">Ohtsuki et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Bonnet et al., 2014</a>), promotes DNA anchorage to NPCs (<a href=\"#bib43\">Luthra et al., 2007</a>). Current data suggest that this association occurs on both chromosomal and non-chromosomal DNA. Nevertheless, we observed an enrichment of SAGA on non-centromeric DNA circles both by using microscopy and ChIP experiments. Therefore, we propose that either SAGA is more efficiently recruited to or more stably associated with acentric DNA molecules or, alternatively, that during mitosis SAGA interaction or function is specifically repressed on chromosomal DNA."

Since circles containing transcribed sequences are expected to recruit more SAGA, they may be more efficiently marked and retained than non-transcribed circles. In addition, our ChIP data are consistent with previous data indicating that ARSs are also SAGA targets (<a href=\"#bib17\">Espinosa et al., 2010</a>). In fitting, DNA circles with strong replication origins are better retained in mother cells than those with weak origins (<a href=\"#bib20\">Futcher and Cox, 1984</a>). Thus, replicating circles may also be better retained than non-replicating circles. Therefore, a SAGA-based mechanism to discriminate between chromosomal and non-chromosomal DNA would primarily target non-chromosomal DNA molecules of internal or foreign origin based on their expression and replication potential, i.e. on their potential toxicity. Hence, we suggest that this pathway fulfills the functions of a genomic immunity system capable of preventing the spread of extra-chromosomal DNA molecules of both foreign and endogenous origin in a population. Since DNA circles form in all organisms tested so far (<a href=\"#bib21\">Gaubatz, 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Cohen et al., 2003</a>, <a href=\"#bib9\">2010</a>), there must exist some mechanism to restrict their propagation in higher eukaryotes as well."

RecQ helicases inhibit the formation of Holliday junctions (<a href=\"#bib56\">Sharma et al., 2006</a>) and therefore of circles. Thus, an increased rate of circle formation might underlie at least some aspects of the Werner and Bloom syndromes. Interestingly, the Hutchinson\u2013Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS), which is caused by the defects of the nuclear lamina and causes alterations of the nuclear structure (<a href=\"#bib54\">Scaffidi and Misteli, 2006</a>), leads to very similar ageing phenotypes as Werner and Bloom syndromes. These different observations indicate a link between genomic instability, DNA circle formation, and changes in nuclear organization during ageing and suggest that NPCs might be at the center of these relationships. Together, our data indicate that yeast is a powerful system to dissect how NPC number and modifications affect nuclear homeostasis and cellular viability."

After subtraction of the background, the fluorescence was normalized by the median fluorescence of cells without plasmids. To determine fluorescence intensity, the mean gray value of the NPC area adjacent to the accumulated circles (Ic) and the residual NPC area (Ir) was measured and normalized by the median intensity of Ir. For the percentage fluorescence segregated to the mother cell, the integrated density of the nucleus in the mother and the bud was measured after nuclear division, and after subtraction of the background the fluorescence in the mother was divided by the total fluorescence. The nuclear area depicts the 2D area of the nucleus in a sum projection in the mother and daughter of telophase cells. The mean intensity is the total intensity divided by the nuclear area.

Both intensities were set to 100% prior to the first bleaching. Fluorescence decay was plotted for each cell using Prism (GraphPad Software) and t<sub>70</sub> was defined as the time after which 70% of the initial intensity was still recorded. Finally, the average t<sub>70</sub> of several cells was calculated for both Ic and Io and shown in the graph.

Cells were washed with Tris-buffered saline, resuspended in lysis buffer, and lysed in a cooled freezer mill (Spex) for 6 cycles (2 min with 2 min breaks each at 12 cps). Afterwards, the samples were sonicated twice for 15 min by altering cycles of 30 s pulses followed by 30 s cool down periods using a Bioruptor (Diagenode). After centrifugation, supernatants were immunoprecipitated overnight at 4\u00b0C on anti-GFP beads (Chromotek). Washing steps and elution were performed as described (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chymkowitch et al., 2012</a>). After RNase and proteinase K treatment, DNA fragments were purified using QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen) and were analyzed by qPCR using a rotorgene qPCR system (Qiagen).

Images were acquired with a Plan Apo lambda 60\u00d7/1.4 NA objective and a Orca R2 CCD camera (Hamamatsu). Cell growth and budding events were monitored by capturing images using transmitted light every 20 min. Fluorescent images were taken after 24 hr and 36 hr for short-lived strains (e.g. <i>sir2\u0394</i> cells) and after 48 hr and 64 hr for normal or long-lived strains using a mercury lamp as a light source (Intensilight, Nikon Instruments). Stacks of 14 slices covering a range of 7 \u03bcm were captured every 15 min for 2 hr, to follow the nuclear division. Nuclei of cells of different ages were analyzed using sum projections of the fluorescence images from both time points (48 hr and 64 hr). Total fluorescence (integrated density) was measured in the mother and daughter cell after nuclear division using ImageJ. After background subtraction, the values were grouped by the indicated age categories of the mother cells, normalized by the median of the daughter cells in the youngest age category, and plotted using Prism. Alternatively, nuclear fluorescence in the mother cells was divided by the total fluorescence (mother plus daughter nuclei) for each cell and plotted against the age of the mother cell to visualize the increase in asymmetry with age. This data were used to fit a one-phase association curve, which is shown in the graph. Additionally, 10 values were grouped age dependently and plotted showing the average age and percentage of fluorescence segregated to the mother cell as well as the standard deviations. For G1 cells, the total amount of NPCs (integrated density) was measured, plotted against their age, and an exponential curve was fitted using Prism. The values were then normalized by intersection of the curve with the Y-axis and set to 1. The dots on the graph were created from 10 values as described for the dividing cells. Similarly, the mean fluorescence intensity (integrated density divided by area) was plotted as well as the radius of the G1 nuclei, measured drawing a line through the nucleus at its broadest area using ImageJ, dividing it by two and plotting it against the age of the cell."

The reviewers agree with the conclusions that, as yeast cells age, ERCs interact with the NPC through a mechanism that requires SAGA and that this alters the behavior (and potentially the function) of NPCs. However the reviewers also agree that the authors have overstated the mechanistic contribution of SAGA in the linkage of circular DNAs to the NPC. This latter conclusion is unsubstantiated without quite a bit more experimental evidence. To conclude that SAGA is really mediating the interaction with the NPC, the authors need to better define this mechanism. Does SAGA bind equally throughout the plasmid after eviction of the CEN? How does the E173A mutation impact this binding? How different is the acetylation of the histones associated with centromeric vs the non-centromeric plasmid? Therefore, it is recommended that the authors may proceed if they remove these claims. Nevertheless, even to make the case for the SAGA linkage at all, there are couple of things that must be addressed, some with simple straightforward experiments: 1) In the plasmid retention assay, perform the double mutant <i>gcn5\u2206 sac3\u2206</i> (or <i>ada5\u2206sac3\u2206</i> <i>\u2013</i> better) measurements to properly test that there is no additive effect in eliminating TREX and SAGA."

Indeed, we are now adding data on the effect of SAGA inactivation on recombination in the rDNA. As we show now, the <i>gcn5\u2206</i> mutant cells do not show a reduced frequency of rDNA excision; if anything it is rather slightly increased. Thus, the only thing that we can conclude from these data is that in both the <i>gcn5\u0394</i> single and <i>gcn5\u0394 fob1\u0394</i> double mutant cells ERC accumulation is no longer the factor limiting longevity."

(2014)</a>, who suggest that the effect of Sgf73 on ageing is partially due to a decrease in ERC formation. Using the same test as for the <i>gcn5\u2206</i>, we confirmed that indeed, cells lacking Sgf73 show a reduction (2 folds) in ERC formation, similar to the cells lacking Fob1. However, the <i>sgf73\u2206</i> mutant cells show a much more prolonged lifespan compared to the <i>fob1\u2206</i> mutant cells. Thus, the effect of the <i>sgf73\u2206</i> mutation on longevity probably involved a combination of effects, such as a reduction of ERC formation and the lack of retention of the residual ERCs. This interpretation is still fully supported by the fact that restoring SAGA linkage to NPCs in these cells restores ageing."
