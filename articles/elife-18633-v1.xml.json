Although most integrins contain \u03b21, canonical activation mechanisms are based on studies of the platelet integrin, \u03b1IIb\u03b23. Its inactive conformation is characterized by association of the \u03b1IIb transmembrane and cytosolic domain (TM/CT) with a tilted \u03b23 TM/CT that leads to activation when disrupted. We show significant structural differences between \u03b21 and \u03b23 TM/CT in bicelles. Moreover, the 'snorkeling' lysine at the TM/CT interface of \u03b2 subunits, previously proposed to regulate \u03b1IIb\u03b23 activation by ion pairing with nearby lipids, plays opposite roles in \u03b21 and \u03b23 integrin function and in neither case is responsible for TM tilt. Affinities ranging from almost no interaction to the relatively high avidity that characterizes \u03b1IIb\u03b23 exist between various \u03b1 subunits and \u03b21 TM/CTs. The \u03b1IIb\u03b23-based canonical model for the roles of the TM/CT in integrin activation and function clearly does not extend to all mammalian integrins."
