Here we show that the phospholipid remodeling enzyme lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 3 (Lpcat3) is a critical determinant of triglyceride secretion due to its unique ability to catalyze the incorporation of arachidonate into membranes. Mice lacking <i>Lpcat3</i> in the intestine fail to thrive during weaning and exhibit enterocyte lipid accumulation and reduced plasma triglycerides. Mice lacking <i>Lpcat3</i> in the liver show reduced plasma triglycerides, hepatosteatosis, and secrete lipid-poor VLDL lacking arachidonoyl phospholipids. Mechanistic studies indicate that Lpcat3 activity impacts membrane lipid mobility in living cells, suggesting a biophysical basis for the requirement of arachidonoyl phospholipids in lipidating lipoprotein particles. These data identify Lpcat3 as a key factor in lipoprotein production and illustrate how manipulation of membrane composition can be used as a regulatory mechanism to control metabolic pathways."
