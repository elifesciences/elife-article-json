                    "text": "During cell division, progression through mitosis is driven by a protein phosphorylation wave. This wave namely depends on an activation-inactivation cycle of cyclin B-dependent kinase (Cdk) 1 while activities of major protein phosphatases, like PP1 and PP2A, appear directly or indirectly repressed by Cdk1. However, how Cdk1 inactivation is coordinated with reactivation of major phosphatases at mitosis exit still lacks substantial knowledge. We show here that activation of PP2A-B55, a major mitosis exit phosphatase, required the phosphatase Fcp1 downstream Cdk1 inactivation in human cells. During mitosis exit, Fcp1 bound Greatwall (Gwl), a Cdk1-stimulated kinase that phosphorylates Ensa/ARPP19 and converts these proteins into potent PP2A-B55 inhibitors during mitosis onset, and dephosphorylated it at Cdk1 phosphorylation sites. Fcp1-catalyzed dephosphorylation drastically reduced Gwl kinase activity towards Ensa/ARPP19 promoting PP2A-B55 activation. Thus, Fcp1 coordinates Cdk1 and Gwl inactivation to derepress PP2A-B55, generating a dephosphorylation switch that drives mitosis progression."

                    "text": "During cell division, progression through mitosis is driven by a protein phosphorylation wave. This wave namely depends on an activation-inactivation cycle of cyclin B-dependent kinase (Cdk) 1 while activities of major protein phosphatases, like PP1 and PP2A, appear directly or indirectly repressed by Cdk1. However, how Cdk1 inactivation is coordinated with reactivation of major phosphatases at mitosis exit still lacks substantial knowledge. We show here that activation of PP2A-B55, a major mitosis exit phosphatase, required the phosphatase Fcp1 downstream Cdk1 inactivation in human cells. During mitosis exit, Fcp1 bound Greatwall (Gwl), a Cdk1-stimulated kinase that phosphorylates Ensa/ARPP19 and converts these proteins into potent PP2A-B55 inhibitors during mitosis onset, and dephosphorylated it at Cdk1 phosphorylation sites. Fcp1-catalyzed dephosphorylation drastically reduced Gwl kinase activity towards Ensa/ARPP19 promoting PP2A-B55 activation. Thus, Fcp1 coordinates Cdk1 and Gwl inactivation to derepress PP2A-B55, generating a dephosphorylation switch that drives mitosis progression."

                        "text": "We recently reported a critical, transcription-independent, role for the essential RNA polymerase II-carboxy-terminal domain (RNAP II-CTD) phosphatase Fcp1 in Cdk1 inactivation at the end of mitosis (<a href=\"#bib20\">Visconti et al., 2012</a>). Indeed, depleting Fcp1 from living HeLa cells as well as from mitotic HeLa cell extracts, that are nuclei-free thus non-transcribing, substantially impaired cyclin B degradation, Cdk1 inactivation and mitosis exit (<a href=\"#bib20\">Visconti et al., 2012</a>). In that study, we also noticed that Fcp1 depletion impaired bulk mitotic protein dephosphorylation also upon chemical inhibition of Cdk1 in non-transcribing mitotic cell extracts (<a href=\"#bib20\">Visconti et al., 2012</a>). This observation suggested that Fcp1 was required for crucial mitosis exit dephosphorylations even downstream Cdk1 inactivation in a transcription-independent manner. However, bulk dephosphorylation at mitosis exit are likely due to action of major phosphatases like PP1 or PP2A, rather than Fcp1 itself (<a href=\"#bib5\">Ferrigno et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Qian et al., 2013</a>). The PP2A-B55 isoform, in particular, has relevant roles for late mitotic events like spindle breakdown, chromatin decondensation, nuclear membrane and Golgi reassembly and cytokinesis (<a href=\"#bib16\">Schmitz et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Cundell et al., 2013</a>). In addition, PP2A-B55 has been shown to reverse bulk mitotic phosphorylations detectable by a commercially available anti-Cdk1 substrate antibody, recognizing the K/HpSP motif (where pS is phosphorylated Ser), and the phosphorylation of PRC1, a crucial cytokinesis protein, at T481 (<a href=\"#bib16\">Schmitz et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Cundell et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Qian et al., 2013</a>). In preliminary experiments, in which Fcp1 expression was downregulated in HeLa cells by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), we found that dephosphorylations of bulk K/HpSP motif and pT481-PRC1 at mitosis exit were indeed dependent on Fcp1 (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). However, given the role for Fcp1 in inactivation of the spindle assembly checkpoint and of Cdk1 (<a href=\"#bib20\">Visconti et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Visconti et al., 2013</a>), delayed dephosphorylations could be due to persistance of Cdk1 kinase activity rather than impaired PP2A-B55 phosphatase activation at the end of mitosis. To know whether Fcp1 controlled PP2A-B55 activation downstream Cdk1 inactivation, we determined whether Fcp1 depletion impaired bulk K/HpSP motif and pT481-PRC1 dephosphorylation upon chemical inhibition of Cdk1 activity in mitotic cells and cell extracts. Control and Fcp1 siRNAs-depleted, as well as Fcp1 depleted complemented with siRNAs-resistant wild type Fcp1 (Fcp1WT) expression vector, HeLa cells were arrested at pro-metaphase and further treated with the Cdk1 inhibitor RO-3306 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1A,B</a>). Nuclei-free, mitotic HeLa cell extracts were, instead, either mock immunodepleted, as control, or immunodepleted of Fcp1 or immunodepleted of Fcp1 and reconstituted with purified, active, Fcp1 wild type (Fcp1WT) protein before treatment with RO-3306 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1C,D</a>). The results showed that, in cells and cell extracts, Fcp1 was indeed required for timely PP2A-B55-dependent dephosphorylations following Cdk1 inactivation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,C</a>). Fcp1 is relatively resistant to the potent PP2A inhibitor okadaic acid (OA); nevertheless, we confirmed that pT481-PRC1 and bulk K/HpSP motif dephosphorylations were OA sensitive (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) (<a href=\"#bib16\">Schmitz et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Cundell et al., 2013</a>)."

                        "text": "To address mechanistically the Fcp1 dependency of PP2A-B55 activation, we hypothesized that Fcp1 was required to inactivate the Ensa/ARPP19 kinase ability of Gwl and allow PP2A-B55 autoactivation. Gwl is higly phosphorylated in mitosis and several observations indicate that Cdk1 directly phosphorylates Gwl stimulating its kinase activity (<a href=\"#bib18\">Vigneron et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Blake-Hodek et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Dephoure et al., 2008</a>). Once activated by Cdk1, Gwl can autophosphorylate and autophosphorylation appears to contribute to its own overall activity (<a href=\"#bib1\">Blake-Hodek et al. 2012</a>). A study in <i>Xenopus laevis</i> egg extracts has very recently provided compelling evidence that PP1 is the phosphatase that dephosphorylates Gwl at autophosphorylation sites, contributing this way to Gwl inactivation at the end of mitosis. However, the same study showed that dephosphorylation of Gwl at other sites, most likely also those phosphorylated by Cdk1, is PP1-independent (<a href=\"#bib8\">Heim et al., 2015</a>). As Fcp1 is known to be able to reverse Cdk-dependent phosphorylation (<a href=\"#bib6\">Ghosh et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Visconti et al., 2012</a>), we hypothesised that Fcp1 was required for Gwl inactivation by removing Cdk1-dependent, activatory, phosphorylations of Gwl at the end of mitosis. First, we established a way to monitor changes at potential Cdk1-dependent Gwl phosphorylation sites during mitosis exit. Two commercially available anti-Cdk1 substrate antibodies, the previously mentioned anti-K/HpSP motif and an anti-pSPXR/K (where pS is phosphorylated serine and X any aminoacid) motif, can in principle recognize serine 90 and serine 453 in human Gwl (S90-Gwl and S453-Gwl), respectively, being S90-Gwl (89-KSP-91) and S453-Gwl (453-SPCK-456), the only human Gwl serine residues in those contexts. While S453-Gwl has been shown to be specifically phosphorylated in mitosis by proteomic approaches, S90-Gwl has not (<a href=\"#bib4\">Dephoure et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Blake-Hodek et al., 2012</a>). Nevertheless, both antibodies reacted against V5-tagged wild-type Gwl (V5-GwlWT) but not against V5-Gwl versions in which serine 90 and serine 453 were respectively mutated into non-phosphorylatable alanine (V5-GwlS90A; V5-GwlS453A) when the tagged proteins were isolated from transfected, mitotic, HeLa cells, indicating that both residues are phosphorylated in mitosis (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). In addition, these antibodies did not react against V5-GwlWT isolated from HeLa cells in G1, unless it was treated with purified, active, Cdk1 in vitro (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). To analyse potential changes in Gwl phosphorylation at S90 and S453 during mitosis exit, we probed endogenous Gwl isolated from HeLa cells taken at various time points during mitosis exit with anti-K/HpSP and pSPXR/K antibodies (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). PS90- and pS453-Gwl signals were readly detected in prometaphase but were progressively lost as cells transited out of mitosis (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Importantly, dephosphorylation at both sites was resistant to OA at a dose (2 \u03bcM) that potently inhibited PP1 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>), as indicated by persistance, despite Cdk1 inactivation by cyclin B degradation, of Cdk1-dependent inhibitory phosphorylation of PP1 catalytic subunit a (PP1c\u03b1) at T320 (pT320-PP1c\u03b1), a site that PP1 autodephosphorylates upon Cdk1 inactivation (<a href=\"#bib15\">Qian et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Heim et al., 2015</a>) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). However, OA significantly delayed the kinetics of Gwl migration shift on SDS/PAGE, in agreement with the notion that also OA-sensitive phosphatase(s) dephosphorylate Gwl at several other sites during mitosis exit (<a href=\"#bib9\">Hegarat et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Williams et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Heim et al., 2015</a>). Conversely, depletion of Fcp1 delayed Gwl dephosphorylation at both S90 and S453 as well as Gwl migration shift and pS67-Ensa dephosphorylation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). In addition, a 15-min\u00a0treatment with RO-3306 promptly induced pS90- and pS453-Gwl dephosphorylation and Gwl downshift in prometaphase-arrested control and Fcp1 re-expressing cells but not in prometaphase-arrested Fcp1-depleted cells, indicating that Fcp1 was required for these dephosphorylations downstream Cdk1 inactivation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). Prolonging Cdk1 inhibitor treatment up to 30 min resulted in some Gwl dephosphorylation also in Fcp1 siRNAs-treated cells (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>); however, we could not rule out whether this was caused by the action of other phosphatases or of residual Fcp1 after substantial time from Cdk1 inactivation. Nevertheless, the 15-min\u00a0treatment with RO-3306 was able to potently induce autoactivatory pT320-PP1c\u03b1 dephosphorylation in Fcp1-depleted as in control cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). Thus, Fcp1 is required for timely dephosphorylation of at least two Cdk1-dependent sites of Gwl, S90 and S453, at mitosis exit."

Indeed, by co-immunoprecipitation (coIP) of endogenous proteins, we found that Gwl transiently bound Fcp1 during mitosis exit (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Binding was lower in prometaphase, increased during the period of spindle assembly (20-30 min) to decrease thereafter (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>;\u00a0Fcp1 and Gwl appear to be similarly abundant proteins in HeLa cells and we estimate that approximately 8-14% of Fcp1 interacts with Gwl in cells at the peak of interaction as, routinely, ~3-5% of total lysate Fcp1 was found in Gwl IP that contained ~30-40% of total lysate Gwl).

                        "text": "To investigate this hypothesis, we first asked whether purified Fcp1 could dephosphorylate Gwl at S90 and S453 in vitro. Indeed, purified active Fcp1 (Fcp1WT), but not an inactive, catalytic dead, Fcp1 version (Fcp1CD), was able to dephosphorylate Gwl isolated from mitotic cells at both sites (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Next, we asked whether Fcp1-dependent dephosphorylation of Gwl in vitro lowered its kinase activity towards Ensa/ARPP19. To this end, endogenous Gwl, isolated from mitotic cells, was mock-treated or treated with active Fcp1WT or inactive Fcp1CD proteins as described in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>. Subsequently, Gwl activity was assessed on recombinant <i>X. laevis</i>\u00a0Ensa protein as substrate (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). The results clearly show that pre-treatment of mitotic Gwl with Fcp1WT, but not with Fcp1CD, substantially reduced Gwl ability to phosphorylate S67-Ensa (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Similar results were obtained with V5-GwlWT isolated from transfected, mitotic, cells or using ARPP19 as Gwl substrate (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A,1B</a>). We cannot exclude that, in addition to S90 and S453, other Cdk1 phosphorylation sites in Gwl are dephosphorylated by Fcp1; nevertheless, assaying S67-Ensa kinase activity of V5-GwlS90A and V5-GwlS453A mutant proteins, isolated from transfected and prometaphase-arrested HeLa cells, revealed that both mutants had significantly reduced S67-Ensa kinase activity compared to V5-GwlWT (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). The S90A mutation of human Gwl showed highest kinase reduction similarly to what reported for a non-phosphorylatable mutant at equivalent residues in <i><i>X.</i> laevis</i> Gwl (<a href=\"#bib1\">Blake-Hodek et al., 2012</a>). Moreover, a non-phosphorylatable Gwl mutant at S452 (V5-GwlS452A), just preceding serine S453, that is not in a Cdk1 phosphorylation consensus but is found phosphorylated in mitotic cells (<a href=\"#bib4\">Dephoure et al., 2008</a>), had S67-Ensa kinase activity similar to GwlWT (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). In addition, we assessed the S67-Ensa kinase activity of Gwl isolated from the same lysates of the experiment described in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a> in which control, Fcp1-depleted and Fcp1-depleted and complemented prometaphase-arrested cells were treated with the Cdk1 inhibitor for 15 min, and found that while this treatment completely abolished Gwl activity in control cells it had negligible effects in Fcp1-depleted cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>; see also <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). Like for Gwl dephosphorylation, prolonging Cdk1 inhibitor treatment up to 30 min resulted in a reduction of Ensa kinase activity of Gwl also in Fcp1-depleted cells and, again, we cannot rule out whether this is due to the fact that other phosphatases or residual Fcp1 dampened Gwl activity after substantial time from Cdk1 inactivation (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Nevertheless, it is important to remark that the 15-mintreatment with RO-3306 induced full pT320-PP1c\u03b1 dephosphorylation in Fcp1-depleted cells without significantly affecting Gwl kinase activity towards Ensa (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2E</a> and <a href=\"#fig4\">4C</a>)."

We report now that, downstream Cdk1 inactivation, Fcp1 dephosphorylates Gwl at sites probably phosphorylated by Cdk1 and downregulates Gwl kinase activity towards Ensa/ARPP19 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). This ultimately leads PP2A-B55 to take the upper hand in dephosphorylating and releasing Ensa/ARPP19 as competitive inhibitors, getting free to dephosphorylate other substrates to complete mitosis (<a href=\"#bib23\">Williams et al., 2014</a>). Recently, PP1 has been involved in the mechanism of Gwl inactivation at the end of mitosis by reversing Gwl activatory autophosphorylation (<a href=\"#bib8\">Heim et al., 2015</a>). We found that, upon Cdk1 inactivation, Gwl inactivation is strongly delayed if Fcp1 is downregulated, despite potentially active PP1 (see <a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2E</a> and <a href=\"#fig4\">4C</a>). As Cdk1-dependent phosphorylation stimulates Gwl activity not only towards Ensa/ARPP19 but also towards Gwl itself at autoactivatory sites (<a href=\"#bib1\">Blake-Hodek et al., 2012</a>), by reversing Cdk1-dependent phosphorylation Fcp1 could also reduce Gwl autoactivatory strength, favouring this way PP1 action to stably switch off Gwl autoactivation and, along with directly reducing Gwl activity towards Ensa/ARPP19, allow PP1 and PP2A-B55 to shut Gwl activity off\u00a0definitively (<a href=\"#bib9\">Hegarat et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Williams et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Heim et al., 2015</a>). Thus, by controlling Cdk1 and Gwl inactivation, Fcp1 appears to be at the apex of a phosphorylation cascade required to exit mitosis (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Along with other recently described phosphatase activation networks (<a href=\"#bib11\">Lorca and Castro, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Porter et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Nijenhuis et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Grallert et al., 2015</a>), this pathway contributes to ensure coordinated reversal of mitotic phosphorylations to grant correct completion of mitosis."

Eukaryotic expression vectors transfections were performed using Linear Polyethlenimine (Polysciences Inc., Warrington, PA). Recombinant 6His-tagged <i><i>X.</i> laevis</i> Ensa and ARPP19 proteins were expressed in BL21 <i>E. coli</i> cells and purified using Ni-NTA agarose kit (Qiagen,\u00a0Germany) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The Cdk1 inhibitor RO3306 (Calbiochem) was used at 5 and 50 \u03bcM in cells and mitotic cell extracts, respectively. Okadaic acid (Calbiochem) was used at 500 nM or 2 \u03bcM as indicated, MG132 (Calbiochem) at 10 \u03bcM. Cell viability was assessed by trypan blue (EuroClone,\u00a0Italy) exclusion and immunoblots for cleaved caspase 3."

Other antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Immunoprecipitations and immunoblots were performed as previously described (<a href=\"#bib20\">Visconti et al., 2012</a>). For immunofluorescence, cells were grown or spun on microscopy slides, washed in PBS, fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for further 10 min. After blocking with 3% BSA in PBS for 1 hr, samples were incubated with primary antibodies in PBS + 1% BSA for 3 hr. After 3 PBS washes, samples were incubated with secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc., Westgrove, PA) in PBS + 1% BSA for 1 hr at room temperature. DNA was stained by incubation with Hoechst 33258 (10 \u00b5g/ml; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in PBS. Samples were observed and photographed using an Axiovert 200M inverted microscope equipped with the Apotome slider module with 63X or 40X objectives (Zeiss,\u00a0Germany)."

After phosphatase reaction, samples were separated on SDS/PAGE and probed for the indicated antigens or, where indicated, further processed for Gwl kinase activity assays. For Gwl kinase, after phosphatase reactions, each IP set was washed with EB (80 mM \u03b2-glycerophosphate, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 20 mM EGTA), divided into three aliquots and incubated for indicated time points in EB buffer supplemented with 1 mM ATP, 10 mM phosphocreatine, 0.1 mg/ml creatine phosphokinase (kinase buffer, KB) and recombinant <i><i>X.</i> laevis</i>, Ensa or ARPP19 proteins (1 \u03bcg per sample). One-tenth of each reaction was probed on separate blots for total Ensa or ARPP19 proteins, the remaining was probed for pS67/62-Ensa/ARPP19 and Gwl. Total Ensa was also visualized by re-probing blots previosly probed for pS67-Ensa. For in vitro Gwl rephosphorylation assays, V5 IPs from mock- or V5-GwlWT-transfected, G1-synchronised, HeLa cells were split in two portion and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 20 min in KB \u2212 or + active Cyclin A2-CDK1 (126 ng/reaction, ProQuinase,\u00a0Germany)."

Here, they provide evidence that Fcp1 mediates dephosphorylation of CDK1 targets indirectly by dephosphorylating two CDK1 sites on Greatwall (Gwl), a kinase that through phosphorylation of endosulfine creates a potent inhibitor of PP2A/B55, the phosphatase that is responsible for dephosphorylating the majority of the CDK1 substrates, an event needed for exit from mitosis. In summary, here the authors propose a new link between Fcp1 and the Greatwall/Ensa/B55 pathway and suggest that Fcp1 lies at the top of this cascade and triggers mitotic exit by dephosphorylating and inactivating Greatwall kinase."

The reason why these very evident phenotypes induced by Fcp1 downregulation, in our hands, were not picked up in previous large siRNA screens (e.g. mitocheck) is obscure to us. It is worth noting, however, that while the previously mentioned large siRNA screens did not score any phenotype upon Fcp1 downregulation, in other very recent large genetic knockdown screens, Fcp1 was classified as an essential gene in human cells (Science 27 November 2015: 1092-1096 and: 1096-1101.
