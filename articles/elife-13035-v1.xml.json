Our current inability to predict which specific virus subtypes will trigger the next influenza pandemic highlights the vital importance of addressing gaps in the knowledge base. Research on a wide range of topics\u2014including the study of virus transmission, host range, drug resistance, infectivity, immunity and virulence\u2014is urgently needed to fill these gaps. In this article we focus on the issues raised by proposals to use \u2018gain-of-function\u2019 experiments to fill some of these gaps. Such experiments have a long history of providing useful information in virology."

Although potentially dangerous research studies are already subject to stringent regulations in many countries, recent controversies prompted the European Academies Science Advisory Council (EASAC) to set up a working group to examine the issues raised by gain-of-function research and to make recommendations for the management of such research and its outputs in the EU. This working group contained the present authors and other scientists with a wide range of relevant experience. Here we discuss some of the recommendations made by the working group (see <a href=\"#bib4\">EASAC, 2015</a> for the full report)."

It should also be acknowledged that potential benefits of research are sometimes overstated by scientists: however, it is also true that the benefits of research might only become clear much later. Views vary on whether benefit should be quantified in terms of future public health impact or described in terms of the generation of knowledge, and on the extent to which benefits may be lost if research is not allowed. There have been concerns that research that could help to streamline the production of vaccines might suffer if gain-of-function experiments are banned (<a href=\"#bib3\">Cohen, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Ping et al., 2015</a>). Because of the multiple challenges involved in assessing risk and benefit, the EASAC report concludes that any benefit-risk analysis cannot be regarded as a \u2018once and for all\u2019 calculation, and that all the relevant parties need to understand and communicate the issues on an on-going basis."

Rather, all EU Member States should have a clear national advisory mechanism on procedures for assessing and managing biosafety and biosecurity risks. In the UK, for example, the Health and Safety Executive has statutory powers, but other EU Member States have different mechanisms and not all have statutory powers. There is need to harmonise the implementation of good practice in these respects. All countries should also adopt a \u2018layered\u2019 approach with researchers, research institutions, research funders and national authorities all being responsible for the regulation of gain-of-function research. Such a layered approach at the country level will spread good practice, increase accountability, and help to improve public trust in research."

The oversight within the scientific community must involve journals and professional societies, as well as researchers, their funders and institutions (and national advisory bodies in complex cases). Journal editors in the US recently came to a similar conclusion (<a href=\"#bib1\">Casadevall et al., 2015</a>). Regarding the question of what to do when European researchers submit a manuscript to a journal that is not based in Europe, EASAC advises that the use of the EU\u2019s export control regime is an inappropriate and ineffective vehicle to block such submissions."

A <a href=\"http://www.nap.edu/catalog/21666/potential-risks-and-benefits-of-gain-of-function-research-summary\">National Academies workshop</a> in December 2014 observed that the challenges involved in regulating gain-of-function research were international, that attention should be focussed on those experiments of greatest concern, that researchers and their institutions must accept responsibility, and that analysing the risks and benefits is not straightforward. Since then, a quantitative risk-benefit analysis has been initiated (<a href=\"#bib2\">Casagrande et al., 2015</a>), and the NSABB has set up a working group to look into the issues surrounding gain-of-function research (<a href=\"#bib5\">Kanabrocki, 2015</a>). In its interim report the NASBB working group noted that the US already has a robust policy framework for the regulation of research, and any future policies should build on this framework."

Engagement with public interests can be considered at three levels. First, on the global scale, the scientific community has to ensure that the public health benefits that arise from innovation based on gain-of-function research are made available to everyone. Second, on the national level, scientists need to convince the public that taxpayer funds are being spent wisely. Third, on a local level, scientists must engage with those who live near research facilities to reassure them about safety."

Academies of science have a clear role to play at the national level, and international networks of academies can bring scientists from different countries together to study and make recommendations on specific issues: the <a href=\"http://www.interacademies.net/ProjectsAndActivities/10880/27693.aspx\">working group on biosecurity</a> set up by the InterAcademy Partnership is an example of this."
