We report that targeted disruption of TGF-\u03b2 superfamily receptor ALK7 alleviates diet-induced catecholamine resistance in adipose tissue, thereby reducing obesity in mice. Global and fat-specific <i>Alk7</i> knock-out enhanced adipose \u03b2-AR expression, \u03b2-adrenergic signaling, mitochondrial biogenesis, lipid oxidation, and lipolysis under a high fat diet, leading to elevated energy expenditure, decreased fat mass, and resistance to diet-induced obesity. Conversely, activation of ALK7 reduced \u03b2-AR-mediated signaling and lipolysis cell-autonomously in both mouse and human adipocytes. Acute inhibition of ALK7 in adult mice by a chemical-genetic approach reduced diet-induced weight gain, fat accumulation, and adipocyte size, and enhanced adipocyte lipolysis and \u03b2-adrenergic signaling. We propose that ALK7 signaling contributes to diet-induced catecholamine resistance in adipose tissue, and suggest that ALK7 inhibitors may have therapeutic value in human obesity."

We report that targeted disruption of TGF-\u03b2 superfamily receptor ALK7 alleviates diet-induced catecholamine resistance in adipose tissue, thereby reducing obesity in mice. Global and fat-specific <i>Alk7</i> knock-out enhanced adipose \u03b2-AR expression, \u03b2-adrenergic signaling, mitochondrial biogenesis, lipid oxidation, and lipolysis under a high fat diet, leading to elevated energy expenditure, decreased fat mass, and resistance to diet-induced obesity. Conversely, activation of ALK7 reduced \u03b2-AR-mediated signaling and lipolysis cell-autonomously in both mouse and human adipocytes. Acute inhibition of ALK7 in adult mice by a chemical-genetic approach reduced diet-induced weight gain, fat accumulation, and adipocyte size, and enhanced adipocyte lipolysis and \u03b2-adrenergic signaling. We propose that ALK7 signaling contributes to diet-induced catecholamine resistance in adipose tissue, and suggest that ALK7 inhibitors may have therapeutic value in human obesity."

Both belong to a group of chemicals called catecholamines. These chemicals bind to cells carrying proteins called adrenoceptors on their surface and stimulate the breakdown of fat, which releases energy. However, when nutrients are plentiful, fat cells become resistant to catecholamines and instead store fat so it can be used for energy if food becomes scarce. In the industrialized world where food is easily and constantly accessible, this resistance can cause an unhealthy increase in body fat and result in obesity."

Devising a strategy that specifically targets catecholamine resistance in fat cells is therefore desirable."

To understand ALK7's involvement in fat metabolism, Guo et al. created mice whose fat cells lack ALK7, but whose other cells all produce ALK7 as normal. When fed a diet rich in fat, these mice are leaner than regular mice and they burn more energy."

Indeed, Guo et al. demonstrate that fat cells lacking ALK7 have an increased sensitivity to catecholamines when the mice are on a high fat diet, which decreases the amount of fat the mice accumulate. Conversely, increasing the activity of ALK7 reduces the ability of the cells to respond to catecholamines, and they accumulate more fat."

However, efforts to develop similar compounds in humans stalled when it became clear that the pharmacology of rodent and human \u03b23-AR differed and lipolysis in human adipocytes was mainly mediated by classical \u03b21- and \u03b22-AR, which can also induce hypertension, tachycardia, and other undesired complications (<a href=\"#bib2\">Arch, 2011</a>). Alternative strategies to enhance catecholamine sensitivity and \u03b2-adrenergic signaling selectively in adipose tissue may be effective in combating obesity, but remain unproven. In both humans and rodents, obesity is associated with blunted \u03b2-AR-mediated lipolysis and lipid oxidation in adipose tissue (<a href=\"#bib26\">Reynisdottir et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Arner, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Jocken et al., 2008</a>), but the mechanisms linking nutrient overload to catecholamine resistance remain poorly understood."

Mice lacking ALK7 show reduced fat accumulation after a high fat diet (<a href=\"#bib1\">Andersson et al., 2008</a>) and in a polygenic model of obesity (<a href=\"#bib42\">Yogosawa et al., 2013</a>), but the mechanisms underlying the effects of ALK7 signaling on diet-induced obesity are not understood. Pancreatic islets from <i>Alk7</i> knock-out mice show enhanced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bertolino et al., 2008</a>), a phenotype that is also present in islets from mutant mice lacking the ALK7 ligand activin B (<a href=\"#bib39\">Wu et al., 2014</a>). Moreover, the arcuate nucleus of <i>Alk7</i> knock-out mice shows reduced expression of <i>Npy</i> mRNA and lower numbers of <i>Npy</i>-expressing neurons compared to wild type controls (<a href=\"#bib29\">Sandoval-Guzm\u00e1n et al., 2012</a>). It has therefore been unclear whether ALK7 affects fat accumulation cell-autonomously in adipose tissue or through other sites, and whether its effects on adult physiology are developmental or homeostatic, via acute regulation of adult cell function."

Using these animals, as well as cell culture models, we have established that ALK7 functions cell-autonomously and acutely in adult adipocytes to control energy expenditure and fat accumulation by suppressing adipocyte mitochondrial biogenesis, fatty acid oxidation, and \u03b2-AR mediated-lipolysis. Importantly, we found that ALK7 signaling negatively regulates adipocyte \u03b2-AR expression and \u03b2-adrenergic signaling during a high fat diet, providing a link between nutrient overload and catecholamine resistance in adipose tissue."

                                "text": "In order to dissect the cell-autonomous functions of ALK7 in specific tissues, we generated a conditional knock-out allele of the mouse <i>Alk7</i> gene (also known as <i>Acvr1c</i>) with <i>loxP</i> sites flanking exons 5 and 6, encoding essential regions of the ALK7 kinase domain (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Gene deletion in adipose tissue was achieved by crossing <i>Alk7</i><sup>fx</sup> mice with <i>Ap2</i><sup>CRE</sup> mice (<a href=\"#bib15\">He et al., 2003</a>). Although <i>Ap2</i><sup>CRE</sup> has also been reported to be expressed in adipose tissue macrophages (<a href=\"#bib22\">Lee et al., 2013</a>), <i>Alk7</i> mRNA expression could only be detected in the adipocyte fraction of adipose tissue but not in the stromal-vascular fraction (containing macrophages) or in spleen (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A\u2013D</a>). Expression of <i>Alk7</i> mRNA was reduced by 60% in the adipose tissue of <i>Alk7</i><sup>fx/fx</sup>::<i>Ap2</i><sup>CRE</sup> mice, while a 98% reduction was achieved in <i>Alk7</i><sup>fx/\u2212</sup>::<i>Ap2</i><sup>CRE</sup> mice (i.e., compound heterozygotes carrying floxed and knock-out <i>Alk7</i> alleles) (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3A,B</a>). No change in <i>Alk7</i> mRNA expression was observed in the pancreas or brain (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). Both lines of fat-specific <i>Alk7</i> mutant mice showed significantly reduced weight gain during 12 weeks on a high fat diet compared to controls (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>). In contrast, weight gain in <i>Alk7</i><sup>fx/fx</sup>::<i>Nestin</i><sup>CRE</sup> mice, lacking ALK7 expression in the nervous system (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3C</a>), did not differ from controls (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Diet-induced fat accumulation, as measured by epididymal and retroperitoneal fat depot weight (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D\u2013F</a>), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of total fat mass (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G,H</a>), and adipocyte cell size (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1I,J</a>), was also significantly reduced in fat-specific <i>Alk7</i> mutant mice compared to controls. In contrast, fat depots of nervous system-specific <i>Alk7</i> mutant mice were not different from controls (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1K</a>). In agreement with reduced diet-induced obesity, serum leptin levels were also lower after a high fat diet in both global and fat-specific <i>Alk7</i> knock-out mice (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>). However, fed serum insulin levels remained unchanged in fat-specific and brain-specific <i>Alk7</i> knock-out mice (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,D</a>), suggesting unaltered peripheral insulin sensitivity. In addition, glucose and insulin tolerance tests performed in fat-specific <i>Alk7</i> mutant mice and controls indicated normal glucose and insulin responses in the mutants (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E\u2013H</a>). Obesity has been associated with a state of inflammation in adipose tissue in which resident macrophages play important roles (<a href=\"#bib18\">Hotamisligil, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Fujisaka et al., 2009</a>). Following 8 weeks of a high fat diet, adipose tissue of global and fat-specific <i>Alk7</i> knock-out mice showed decreased expression of markers of pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages, such as <i>TNF1\u03b1, IL-12b</i>, and <i>Itgax</i> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2I,J</a>), but increased expression of <i>Mgl2</i>, a marker of M2 macrophages, the major resident macrophages involved in remodeling and repair that are normally present in adipose tissue from lean mice (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2K,L</a>). This profile is in agreement with reduced adipose tissue inflammation and protection against diet-induced obesity. Together, these results indicate that ALK7 functions cell-autonomously in adipose tissue to regulate fat accumulation during nutrient overload."

                                "text": "The reduced obesity in <i>Alk7</i> knock-out mice after a high fat diet could be a result of lower calorie intake or higher energy expenditure. Both global knock-out and fat-specific <i>Alk7</i> mutant mice displayed increased energy expenditure (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>) and oxygen consumption (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,D</a>) after a high fat diet compared to controls. Food intake remained unchanged in the mutant mice (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). Changes in energy expenditure in <i>Alk7</i> mutant mice were not due to \u2018browning\u2019 of subcutaneous adipose tissue, as expression of brown adipose tissue (BAT) marker genes <i>Ucp1</i> and <i>Elovl3</i> was not increased in the subcutaneous fat of the mutants (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). Moreover, the browning effects of the \u03b2<sub>3</sub>-AR-specific agonist CL316243 were comparable in subcutaneous adipose tissue of wild type and <i>Alk7</i> knock-out mice (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C,D</a>). Neither was expression of BAT markers elevated in the BAT of <i>Alk7</i> mutant mice (data not shown). Global and fat-specific <i>Alk7</i> knock-out mice showed higher physical activity than wild type controls after a high fat diet (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F,G</a>). However, it was recently reported that changes in activity do not drive changes in energy expenditure in groups of mice below thermoneutrality (<a href=\"#bib37\">Virtue et al., 2012</a>). We hypothesized that increased energy expenditure in <i>Alk7</i> mutant mice on a high fat diet may be due to higher basal metabolic rate, and investigated adipose tissue mitochondria biogenesis and function, which are impaired by chronic nutrient overload in rodents and humans (<a href=\"#bib16\">Heilbronn et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Rong et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Sutherland et al., 2008</a>). Mitochondria biogenesis, as measured by mitochondrial DNA content (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>), citrate synthase activity (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,D</a>), and ATP content (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E,F</a>), was significantly increased in adipose tissue of both global and fat-specific <i>Alk7</i> knock-out mice on a high fat diet compared to controls. In addition, several markers of mitochondrial biogenesis and function were also significantly upregulated in the mutants, including PGC-1\u03b1, a master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis (<a href=\"#bib40\">Wu et al., 1999</a>), mitochondrial uncoupling protein 3 (UCP-3), <i>cytochrome C</i>, and Hadhb, a key mitochondrial enzyme for \u03b2-oxidation of long chain fatty acids (<a href=\"#bib23\">Middleton, 1994</a>) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G,H</a>). In line with these changes, fatty acid oxidation activity was enhanced in the adipose tissue of global and fat-specific <i>Alk7</i> mutant mice (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4I,J</a>). These results suggest that resistance to diet-induced obesity in <i>Alk7</i> mutant mice is due to increased energy expenditure and enhanced mitochondrial function and lipid oxidation in adipose tissue."

                                "text": "Activation of \u03b2-ARs by catecholamines is the major regulatory pathway of fat mobilization during starvation and exercise. Mice lacking all three types of \u03b2-ARs are massively obese on a high fat diet without an increase in food intake (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bachman et al., 2002</a>). Conversely, \u03b2-agonist treatment induces mitochondria biogenesis in adipose tissue and reduces fat mass (<a href=\"#bib14\">Ghorbani et al., 1997</a>), resembling the phenotype observed in <i>Alk7</i> mutant mice. \u03b2-AR-dependent fat mobilization is severely impaired during a high fat diet, allowing fat accumulation in adipose tissue, but the underlying mechanisms of catecholamine resistance have not been clarified (<a href=\"#bib26\">Reynisdottir et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Jocken et al., 2008</a>). We investigated whether ALK7 could play a role in the catecholamine sensitivity of adipose tissue under a low caloric diet and after nutrient overload. Under a chow diet, injection of the \u03b2<sub>3</sub>-AR-specific agonist CL316243 enhanced lipolysis, as measured by free fatty acid release, significantly more in fat-specific <i>Alk7</i> knock-out mice than in wild type controls (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). After 16 weeks on a high fat diet, global and fat-specific <i>Alk7</i> knock-out mice also displayed elevated lipolysis compared to controls under both basal conditions and following \u03b2<sub>3</sub>-AR stimulation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,C</a>). On the other hand, we detected no change in basal or agonist-stimulated lipolysis in brain-specific <i>Alk7</i> knock-out mice (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). As levels of epinephrine and norepinephrine were not significantly altered in the adipose tissue of <i>Alk7</i> knock-out mice (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), these data suggested enhanced catecholamine sensitivity in adipose tissue lacking ALK7. In agreement with this, the levels of <i>Adrb1</i> and <i>Adrb3</i> mRNAs were significantly protected in <i>Alk7</i> knock-out mice after 16 weeks on a high fat diet, but were barely detectable in the adipose tissue of control mice (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E,F</a>). In addition, expression of the negative regulator of adrenergic signaling <i>Rgs2</i>, an inhibitor of adenylate cyclase, was elevated after a high fat diet in the adipose tissue of wild type mice but not in <i>Alk7</i> knock-out mice (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>) or fat-specific <i>Alk7</i> knock-out mice (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5H,I</a>). <i>Adrb1</i> and <i>Adrb3</i> mRNA levels were also significantly higher in fat-specific <i>Alk7</i> knock-outs compared to controls after a high fat diet (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5H,I</a>). In line with enhanced adrenergic signaling, we observed increased levels of total and phosphorylated hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), a major target of the \u03b2-adrenergic pathway in adipocytes, and phosphorylated PKA substrates in the adipose tissue of <i>Alk7</i> knock-out mice after 16 weeks on a high fat diet compared to wild type controls (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5J,K</a>). Moreover, norepinephrine injection induced a more pronounced increase in PKA activity in the adipose tissue of <i>Alk7</i> knock-out mice than in control mice (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5L</a>). Together, these data suggest that cell-autonomous ALK7 signaling in adipose tissue suppresses catecholamine sensitivity and \u03b2-adrenergic signaling under a high fat diet."

                                "text": "The enhanced catecholamine sensitivity of adipose tissue in <i>Alk7</i> mutant mice prompted us to investigate the acute effects of ALK7 signaling on \u03b2-AR expression and adrenergic signaling in cultured adipocyte cells derived by differentiation from mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Stimulation of wild type adipocytes with the ALK7 ligand activin B reduced expression of <i>Adrb2</i> and <i>Adrb3</i> mRNAs as well as mRNA for the \u03b2-adrenergic target gene <i>Hsl</i> (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Activin B had no effect on adipocytes derived from <i>Alk7</i> knock-out MEFs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>), indicating that its effects on adipocyte gene expression were mediated by ALK7. Activin B also downregulated expression of mRNA encoding PPAR\u03b3, a master regulator of adipogenesis (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). However, the effects of activin B on adipocyte <i>Adrb</i> mRNA expression are likely to be independent of PPAR\u03b3, since inhibition of PPAR\u03b3 had no significant effect on <i>Adrb3</i> mRNA levels and activin B could suppress <i>Adrb3</i> mRNA expression even in the presence of the PPAR\u03b3 inhibitor or the PPAR\u03b3 agonist rosiglitazone (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Conversely, the related ligand activin A, which does not stimulate ALK7 signaling, enhanced adipocyte PPAR\u03b3 mRNA expression but had no significant effect on <i>Adrb2</i>, <i>Adrb3</i>, and <i>Hsl</i> mRNA levels in wild type adipocytes (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Expression of <i>Adrb2</i>, <i>Adrb3</i>, and <i>Hsl</i> mRNAs was also significantly reduced in <i>Alk7</i> knock-out adipocytes following ALK7 adenovirus-mediated overexpression (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>), which leads to ligand-independent receptor activation, showing that ALK7 is sufficient to suppress \u03b2-AR expression and signaling in adipocytes. In addition, activin B antagonized the stimulatory effects of the \u03b2<sub>3</sub>-AR agonist on the phosphorylation of HSL, perilipin, and PKA substrates in wild type adipocytes (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E,F</a>). In line with these findings, activation of ALK7 signaling by either ligand or adenovirus-mediated overexpression suppressed \u03b2-agonist induced lipolysis in wild type adipocytes (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G,H</a>). Interestingly, both activin B and adenovirus-mediated ALK7 overexpression also suppressed \u03b2-agonist stimulated lipolysis in human adipocytes (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6I,J</a>). Together, these results indicate that acute activation of ALK7 is sufficient to suppress \u03b2-adrenergic signaling in both mouse and human adipocytes."

                                "text": "Finally, we sought to determine whether acute blockade of ALK7 signaling in adult mice, by-passing possible developmental effects, could also enhance catecholamine sensitivity in adipose tissue and ameliorate diet-induced obesity. To this end, we devised a chemical-genetic approach to acutely inhibit the ALK7 kinase in adult mice using synthetic ATP analogues (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bishop et al., 1998</a>, <a href=\"#bib6\">2001</a>). An analogue-sensitive kinase allele of <i>Alk7</i> (termed <i>Alk7</i><sup>ASKA</sup>) was engineered by mutation of two residues in the active site of the ALK7 kinase. Substitution of the \u2018gatekeeper\u2019 residue Ser<sup>270</sup> with Gly creates an extra pocket in the ALK7 active site, which can be further expanded by mutating the adjacent residue Leu<sup>250</sup> to Val. As assessed in transfected cells, the mutations had no effect per se on ligand-mediated signaling, but rendered the mutant receptor sensitive to inhibition by ATP competitive inhibitors, such as 2NaPP1 (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). 2NaPP1 treatment did not affect signaling by the wild type ALK7 receptor (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Knock-in mice were generated carrying the two mutations in the <i>Alk7</i> locus (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). <i>Alk7</i><sup>ASKA</sup> mice developed normally, and displayed normal growth and normal fasting insulinemia and glycemia (data not shown). Activin B signaling was suppressed by 1NaPP1 (an isomer of 2NaPP1 with established in vivo stability [<a href=\"#bib30\">Savitt et al., 2012</a>]) in adipocytes derived from <i>Alk7</i><sup>ASKA</sup> homozygote mice but not from wild type controls (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,B</a>). Residual activin B activity in <i>Alk7</i><sup>ASKA</sup> adipocytes treated with 1NaPP1 was likely due to expression of the related receptor ALK4, which can also respond to activin B by activating Smad3. We subjected cohorts of 2-month-old <i>Alk7</i><sup>ASKA</sup> homozygote and wild type mice to a high fat diet together with twice daily injection of 30 mg/kg 1NaPP1 or vehicle, and monitored their weight daily during a period of 2 weeks. <i>Alk7</i><sup>ASKA</sup> and wild type mice gained weight at the same rate on a high fat diet, increasing by approximately 4 g by the end of the second week (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C,D</a>). There was no weight gain on a chow diet for either genotype (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C,D</a>). Injection of 1NaPP1 significantly reduced the weight gain rate in <i>Alk7</i><sup>ASKA</sup> mice, which on average increased by only 1.6 g after 2 weeks on a high fat diet (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). 1NaPP1 had no effect on wild type mice (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). These results indicate that acute disruption of ALK7 signaling can protect adult mice from diet-induced obesity. Analogue treatment significantly reduced fat accumulation in epididymal and retroperitoneal adipose tissue depots in <i>Alk7</i><sup>ASKA</sup> but not wild type mice (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E,F</a>). Adipocyte cell size was also significantly reduced in <i>Alk7</i><sup>ASKA</sup> mice treated with 1NaPP1 compared to vehicle (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7G,H</a>). We also observed enhanced induction of lipolysis by the \u03b2<sub>3</sub>-AR-specific agonist CL316243 in adipose tissue biopsies extracted from <i>Alk7</i><sup>ASKA</sup> mice that had been treated with 1NaPP1 (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). Moreover, treatment with 1NaPP1 increased the levels of <i>Adrb3</i> mRNA in epididymal and retroperitoneal adipose tissue of <i>Alk7</i><sup>ASKA</sup> mice on a high fat diet (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>). In line with enhanced catecholamine sensitivity, 1NaPP1 treatment attenuated the suppressive effects of a high fat diet on adrenergic signaling in adipose tissue of <i>Alk7</i><sup>ASKA</sup> mice, as assessed by the levels of phosphorylated HSL and PKA substrates (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C\u2013E</a>). Together, these data indicated that acute disruption of ALK7 signaling in adult mice can uncouple nutrient overload from catecholamine resistance in adipose tissue, resulting in reduced fat accumulation and decreased weight gain on a high fat diet."

                        "text": "In mice and humans, nutrient overload induces catecholamine resistance in adipose tissue, thereby suppressing lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation, and enhancing fat accumulation. This is an efficient adaptive mechanism for energy storage during times of abundant food supply, enhancing survival upon starvation. In the modern industrialized world, however, the effortless availability of foods with high caloric content, together with reduced physical activity, has resulted in an obesity pandemic. Remarkably, the mechanisms linking nutrient overload to catecholamine resistance in adipose tissue are not well understood. Clarifying these mechanisms is important, as selective enhancement of catecholamine sensitivity and \u03b2-adrenergic signaling in adipose tissue could be useful in the treatment of obesity. Obesity is thought to induce catecholamine resistance in adipose tissue by downregulating \u03b2-AR expression and interfering with downstream \u03b2-adrenergic signaling pathways, such as PKA activity (<a href=\"#bib26\">Reynisdottir et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Arner, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Jocken et al., 2008</a>). Our results demonstrate that ALK7 signaling contributes to catecholamine resistance by limiting both \u03b2-AR expression and signaling in adipocytes during a high fat diet. Signaling pathways are known to be regulated by negative feedback loops that limit intracellular responses upon sustained stimulation. Adrenergic signaling in adipose tissue self-attenuates under a high fat diet through PKA-mediated upregulation of Rgs2 (<a href=\"#bib32\">Song et al., 2010</a>). Interestingly, a mutation in the <i>Rgs2</i> promoter that increases Rgs2 expression has been shown to enhance susceptibility to metabolic syndrome in humans (<a href=\"#bib11\">Freson et al., 2007</a>). However, it is unclear how elevated levels of Rgs2 can be sustained in adipose tissue during persistent catecholamine resistance. In our studies, disruption of ALK7 in adipose tissue largely prevented the upregulation of Rgs2 under a high fat diet, suggesting that ALK7 signaling may contribute to the maintenance of diet-induced Rgs2 expression, possibly by cooperating with intermediate regulators, such as Crtc3 (<a href=\"#bib32\">Song et al., 2010</a>)."

                        "text": "Our studies in fat-specific <i>Alk7</i> knock-out mice and <i>Alk7</i><sup>ASKA</sup> knock-in mice demonstrate that ALK7 functions cell-autonomously and homeostatically in adult adipocytes to regulate catecholamine sensitivity in response to the diet. Adipocytes lacking ALK7 retain significant levels of \u03b2-AR expression and adrenergic signaling, allowing sustained lipid catabolism and increased energy expenditure. Although such a short-circuit would clearly be maladaptive upon starvation, it offers a therapeutic opportunity for the treatment of obesity. The fact that activin B and adenovirus-mediated ALK7 overexpression suppressed \u03b2-agonist stimulated lipolysis in human adipocytes suggests functional conservation of the ALK7 signaling pathway in human diet-induced obesity. A high fat diet and obesity increase adipocyte expression of the two main ALK7 ligands activin B and GDF-3 (<a href=\"#bib38\">Witthuhn and Bernlohr, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Sj\u00f6holm et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Hoggard et al., 2009</a>), suggesting enhanced ALK7 signaling in obesity. In line with this, diet-induced obesity elevates the level of activated phospho-Smad3 in mouse adipose tissue (<a href=\"#bib41\">Yadav et al., 2011</a>). Mouse and human <i>Alk7</i> mRNA expression is highest in adipose tissue, but undetectable in heart, liver or muscle (<a href=\"#bib21\">Kang and Reddi, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Ryd\u00e9n et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Carlsson et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Murakami et al., 2012</a>). Thus, modulation of ALK7 signaling may offer an alternative approach to regulate catecholamine sensitivity and \u03b2-adrenergic signaling specifically and selectively in adipose tissue. We propose that ALK7 represents a novel link between nutrient overload and catecholamine resistance in adipose tissue, and suggest that strategies to suppress ALK7 signaling may be beneficial to combat human obesity."

Adipogenesis was induced by incubation in MEF medium supplemented with 10 \u03bcg/ml insulin, 0.5 mM IBMX, 1 \u03bcM dexamethasone, and 0.5 \u03bcM rosiglitazone (adipocyte differentiation medium). After 2 days, the medium was changed to MEF medium supplemented with only 10 \u03bcg/ml insulin and 0.5 \u03bcM rosiglitazone (adipocyte maintenance medium), and then changed again every 2 days until full differentiation (i.e., day 8\u201310). Human preadipocytes were purchased from Lonza Biologics and differentiated into adipocytes according to the manufacturer's instructions. For activin B or activin A treatment, cells were incubated with 100 ng/ml activin B or activin A (R&amp;D; Systems, UK) in adipocyte maintenance medium for 48 hr before lipolysis assay or, alternatively, harvested for extraction of RNA and proteins. PPAR\u03b3 agonist rosiglitazone was used at 0.5 \u03bcM; PPAR\u03b3 antagonist T0070907 at 1 \u03bcM. Adenovirus particles were produced and amplified in HEK293 cells as previously described (<a href=\"#bib12\">Fujii et al., 1999</a>). Adipocytes were infected with Adeno-ALK7 or Adeno-LacZ at 2.0 multiplicity of infection (MOI) for 48 hr before lipolysis assay or extraction of RNA. For assessment of nuclear p-Smad3, MEF-derived adipocytes were incubated for 150 min with 2 \u03bcM 1NaPP1 or vehicle (DMSO) then treated for 40 min with 20 ng/ml activin B, or left untreated, and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Adipocytes were identified by BODIPY 493/503 staining and p-Smad3 was assessed by immunocytochemistry with antibodies from Epitomics. DAPI was used for nuclear staining. Images were obtained with a Zeiss laser confocal microscope. The intensity of nuclear p-Smad3 was determined using Zen software (Zeiss, Germany) in adipocytes from three random fields in three different wells per condition. The number of cells displaying nuclear p-Smad3 intensity above an arbitrary threshold was determined in each field, added up for each well, and averaged across the three wells of each condition. All values were then normalized to the number of responding cells in cultures of wild type adipocytes stimulated with activin B (set to 100). The experiment was repeated three times and the results were averaged across the three experiments."

To address these concerns, the authors should examine deletion of ALK7 in macrophages and brain and address whether there is an intrinsic effect of ALK7 deletion on macrophage M1/M2 polarization.

Thus, flox/flox mice show all the major phenotypes described here, including resistance to diet-induced obesity, reduced diet-induced fat accumulation and adipose tissue inflammation, enhanced lipolysis, reduced diet-induced catecholamine resistance and enhanced noradrenergic signaling. In fact, flox/flox and flox/\u2013 mice are very similarly affected in all these phenotypes. We therefore do not think that the use of flox/\u2013 mice for some of the experiments has affected the main conclusions of our study. These mice are there simply to address a possible concern about residual Alk7 expression in flox/flox mice."

We conclude from this that deletion of ALK7 in brain does not confer resistance to obesity, accumulation of fat tissue and diet-induced catecholamine resistance, all of which are improved in the Ap2- CRE model. Also, as indicated above, there cannot be an intrinsic effect of ALK7 in macrophage M1/M2 polarization because Alk7 is not expressed in macrophages. The changes that we see in the M1/M2 profile of mutant adipose tissue must be non-cell autonomous to macrophages. Our interpretation is that such changes are most likely the result of reduced fat accumulation and improved catecholamine responses in adipocytes"
