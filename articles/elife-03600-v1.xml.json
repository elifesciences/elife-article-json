Previously we used a series of still diffraction patterns to determine the structure of lysozyme at 2.9 \u00c5 resolution with MicroED (<a href=\"#bib26\">Shi et al., 2013</a>). Here we present the structure of bovine liver catalase determined from a single crystal at 3.2 \u00c5 resolution by MicroED. The data were collected by continuous rotation of the sample under constant exposure and were processed and refined using standard programs for X-ray crystallography. The ability of MicroED to determine the structure of bovine liver catalase, a protein that has long resisted atomic analysis by traditional electron crystallography, demonstrates the potential of this method for structure determination."

Previously we used a series of still diffraction patterns to determine the structure of lysozyme at 2.9 \u00c5 resolution with MicroED (<a href=\"#bib26\">Shi et al., 2013</a>). Here we present the structure of bovine liver catalase determined from a single crystal at 3.2 \u00c5 resolution by MicroED. The data were collected by continuous rotation of the sample under constant exposure and were processed and refined using standard programs for X-ray crystallography. The ability of MicroED to determine the structure of bovine liver catalase, a protein that has long resisted atomic analysis by traditional electron crystallography, demonstrates the potential of this method for structure determination."

The method was substantially improved by employing \u2018continuous rotation\u2019 where data were recorded as the crystals were continuously rotated, resulting in higher quality data and allowing simple integration with existing processing programs used for X-ray crystallography (<a href=\"#bib23\">Nannenga et al., 2014</a>).

Catalase is a more difficult target than lysozyme, because it has a much larger unit cell, lower symmetry, and four molecules in the asymmetric unit. Moreover, each catalase monomer contains one heme group as well as a bound NADP molecule (<a href=\"#bib13\">Fita and Rossmann, 1985</a>). Catalase is one of the earliest samples studied by EM, but despite extensive efforts spanning decades, the 3D structure of catalase has not been solved using electron diffraction. This is because the crystals have variable thicknesses (6\u201310 protein layers have been reported [<a href=\"#bib8\">Dorset and Parsons, 1975b</a>]), and therefore these crystals were not suitable for 3D structure determination by traditional electron crystallography procedures (<a href=\"#bib20\">Longley, 1967</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Matricardi et al., 1972</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Unwin, 1975</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Unwin and Henderson, 1975</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Dorset and Parsons, 1975a</a>). Here we report the 3.2 \u00c5 structure of catalase determined by MicroED. This is an important next step for the MicroED method as the analysis was rapid, taking a total of 3 weeks from crystal growth to final structural refinement, and used data from only a single catalase microcrystal."

Well-ordered catalase microcrystals were grown by solubilizing crystalline catalase from an aqueous suspension followed by overnight dialysis in 0.05 M Sodium phosphate, pH 6.3. Following crystal formation, crystals were deposited on holey carbon grids and the sample was blotted and vitrified in liquid ethane prior to TEM analysis. The grids were screened in over-focused diffraction mode for the presence of thin 3D crystals (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, inset). The average crystal dimensions were found to be on the order of 8 \u00b5m by 4 \u00b5m in length and width and approximately 150 nm thick, in good agreement with previous crystallization results (<a href=\"#bib8\">Dorset and Parsons, 1975b</a>). Suitable crystals were assessed by collecting a single still diffraction pattern at a total dose of 0.05 e<sup>\u2212</sup>/\u00c5<sup>2</sup>, where well-ordered crystals showed sharp reflections extending to approximately 3.0 \u00c5 for untilted crystals (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). When high-quality diffraction was observed for an untilted crystal, the crystal was then tilted to 60\u00b0 to check the diffraction quality at higher tilt angles as crystal flatness and embedding could affect the diffraction quality at higher tilt (<a href=\"#bib16\">Gonen, 2013</a>). Typically, well-embedded and relatively flat crystals yielded data to \u223c2.8 \u00c5 resolution untilted but only \u223c3.2 \u00c5 at high tilt. Data sets were then collected as a sequence of 6 s exposures per frame. An example data set is shown in <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a> and was recorded as the stage was continuously rotated as described previously (<a href=\"#bib23\">Nannenga et al., 2014</a>)."

All crystals yielded comparable resolution but varied in data completeness (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). We combined all five data sets in an effort to increase completeness, multiplicity and to improve the quality of the data and in parallel we processed the data from crystal 4 separately for comparison. Crystal 4 was chosen for processing separately because it had a good compromise between resolution and completeness. The data sets were processed to a range of resolutions (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>) and phases were determined by molecular replacement (MR) as implemented in MOLREP (<a href=\"#bib32\">Vagin and Teplyakov, 1997</a>) with PDB ID: 3NWL (<a href=\"#bib14\">Foroughi et al., 2011</a>) as a search model. Following MR, refinement using PHENIX and REFMAC (<a href=\"#bib22\">Murshudov et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Adams et al., 2010</a>) with electron scattering factors was performed. Merging data from multiple crystals did not have a significant effect on data completeness, because the catalase crystals all orient on the grid with the c-axis parallel to the electron beam (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). When comparing the statistics presented in <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>, it was clear that merging multiple crystals had a negative impact on the final refinement statistics, most likely due to non-isomorphism between crystals, and therefore the multiple crystal data sets were disregarded. Crystals 1, 2, 3, and 5 were relatively isomorphous and their diffraction data merged well, but the completeness of this data set was low (\u223c62%), and we chose not to use it."

Close analysis indicated that the information content in the 3\u20133.2 \u00c5 resolution shell was too low for inclusion, which was not surprising as the crystals did not diffract well beyond 3.2 \u00c5 at high tilt angles. We therefore truncated the resolution to 3.2 \u00c5 yielding a final model with acceptable refinement statistics (R<sub>work</sub>/R<sub>free</sub> = 26.2%/30.8%) and geometry (<a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). The final 2mF<sub>obs</sub>-DF<sub>calc</sub> density map shows well-defined density surrounding the final refined model (overall map CC = 92.3%), both around the backbone and the side-chains (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>), without significant peaks in the mF<sub>obs</sub>-DF<sub>calc</sub> difference density map (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Additionally, the solvent channels between the tetramers in the crystal lattice show very little density (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>), further evidence of the quality of the model and data. The final structure of catalase at 3.2 \u00c5 resolution determined by MicroED agrees well with previously solved X-ray structures, with an RMSD of 0.358 \u00c5 and 0.440 \u00c5 between the MicroED structure and PDB ID: 3NWL (<a href=\"#bib14\">Foroughi et al., 2011</a>) and PDB ID: 4BLC (<a href=\"#bib18\">Ko et al., 1999</a>), respectively."

While the incompleteness of data is significant, the resulting maps are still expected to be good enough for proper interpretation (<a href=\"#bib15\">Glaeser et al., 1989</a>). To test the quality of the data and the resulting maps, and to identify any significant model bias or negative effects of the data incompleteness, the data were put through several validation tests. First, the robustness of the MR solution was tested by repeating the MR with a single monomeric chain of PDB ID: 3NWL (<a href=\"#bib14\">Foroughi et al., 2011</a>) instead of the complete tetramer that was used originally. Even with a single chain, a strong solution was found with all four molecules successfully placed to recreate the complete tetramer (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>; top MOLREP contrast score = 35.8, where a score of &gt;3.0 is considered a strong solution. An identical test with synchrotron X-ray data yielded a top score of 23.7). We also phased the data with a poly-alanine model derived from PDB ID: 3NWL, and the resulting maps show clear density beyond the model where the correct side-chains could be rebuilt (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B,C</a>)."

Bovine catalase binds four NADP cofactors, one per monomer through several side-chain interactions including F197 (<a href=\"#bib17\">Kirkman and Gaetani, 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Fita and Rossmann, 1985</a>). Recently, the structure of bovine catalase was solved lacking the NADP cofactor (PDB ID: 3RGP) (<a href=\"#bib25\">Purwar et al., 2011</a>), and in the NADP-free structure F197 underwent a conformational change as it no longer interacted with NADP. The crystals used for our MicroED analysis do contain NADP. Therefore, we used PDB ID: 3RGP (NADP-free structure) as a molecular replacement model against the MicroED data to determine whether NADP could be visualized in our catalase crystals using difference maps. When analyzing the difference maps, positive density was observed in the location expected for NADP although it appeared fragmented even at lower contour levels (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E,G</a>). For visual comparison, structure factors from PDB ID: 3NWL, which was solved by X-ray crystallography, were truncated to 3.2 \u00c5, and difference maps were calculated for \u2206181\u2013185, \u2206heme and NADP-free model (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,D,F,H</a>). Maps from both MicroED and synchrotron X-ray diffraction appear fragmented around the NADP even at lower contour levels (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G,H</a>). The difference maps for both the MicroED and X-ray synchrotron data suggest that F197 should change its orientation to assume its correct position for NADP binding."

Bovine liver catalase resisted structural determination by traditional electron crystallography for decades, but the structure was readily determined by MicroED in 3 weeks from crystal formation to final structure determination using a single crystal. This is the second example where a single crystal was sufficient for structure determination by MicroED (<a href=\"#bib23\">Nannenga et al., 2014</a>). Moreover, the continuous rotation method yields data similar in quality to X-ray diffraction allowing simple processing with existing X-ray data reduction software and further accelerating structure analysis by MicroED (<a href=\"#bib23\">Nannenga et al., 2014</a>). The resulting maps allow us to distinguish between subtly different protein conformations and to identify of small-molecule ligands such as NADP. This study shows that MicroED can be used as an alternative to X-ray crystallography using extremely small crystals for both mechanistic studies as well as structure-based drug design studies where small ligands are assayed."

The solubilized catalase was then centrifuged and the supernatant was dialyzed against 50 mM sodium phosphate pH 6.3 overnight at 4\u00b0C. Crystals were removed from dialysis, stored in an Eppendorf tube, and incubated an additional 24 hr at 4\u00b0C. Catalase crystals were stored at 4\u00b0C and were washed with water prior to sample preparation. To prepare samples for the TEM, crystals were resuspended and the undiluted catalase crystal suspension was applied, blotted and vitrified in liquid ethane as described previously (<a href=\"#bib26\">Shi et al., 2013</a>)."

Catalase is a much larger protein than lysozyme with much weaker diffraction, and it is a crystal form with a long track record for use as a test specimen for magnification calibration. The paper therefore does move the method forward, and it is in principle suitable to publish as an \u201cadvance\u201d."

The legend and the text state that the crystals were 8x4 um on average, yet the crystal used for the data collection was one of the larger ones at 15x7 um, and at 0.18um thick was also one of the thicker ones. In a sense, this rather undermines the unique selling point of MicroED. This observation does not invalidate the paper, but does reduce its potential impact. On the other hand, the work presented does demonstrate that there are no other serious problems (such as dynamical scattering); if it works on a big crystal, then it should also work on a smaller crystal, although it will be more work to collect the data because more crystals would be needed."

Since the crystal they actually used for the data collection was bigger than the average, it would presumably have a larger contribution from dynamical scattering. It would be useful if the authors had tried to further refine the structure using a protocol such as used by Grigorieff & Henderson in Ultramicroscopy, 1996. This would show how much the R-factor had been affected by dynamical scattering (i.e. increased by how much)."

Moreover, we use a selected area aperture (6 micron diameter at the specimen), therefore we disagree that this \u201cundermines the unique selling point of MicroED\u201d because crystals of 100-200 nm thickness cannot be studied by traditional x-ray crystallography but are studied here."

It would be useful if the authors had tried to further refine the structure using a protocol such as used by Grigorieff &amp; Henderson in Ultramicroscopy, 1996.
