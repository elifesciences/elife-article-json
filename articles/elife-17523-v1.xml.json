However, mechanisms for recruitment of actin nucleators and motors on specific membrane compartments remain unclear. Here we report how Spir actin nucleators and myosin V motors coordinate their specific membrane recruitment. The myosin V globular tail domain (MyoV-GTD) interacts directly with an evolutionarily conserved Spir sequence motif. We determined crystal structures of MyoVa-GTD bound either to the Spir-2 motif or to Rab11 and show that a Spir-2:MyoVa:Rab11 complex can form. The ternary complex architecture explains how Rab11 vesicles support coordinated F-actin nucleation and myosin force generation for vesicle transport and tethering. New insights are also provided into how myosin activation can be coupled with the generation of actin tracks. Since MyoV binds several Rab GTPases, synchronized nucleator and motor targeting could provide a common mechanism to control force generation and motility in different cellular processes."

However, mechanisms for recruitment of actin nucleators and motors on specific membrane compartments remain unclear. Here we report how Spir actin nucleators and myosin V motors coordinate their specific membrane recruitment. The myosin V globular tail domain (MyoV-GTD) interacts directly with an evolutionarily conserved Spir sequence motif. We determined crystal structures of MyoVa-GTD bound either to the Spir-2 motif or to Rab11 and show that a Spir-2:MyoVa:Rab11 complex can form. The ternary complex architecture explains how Rab11 vesicles support coordinated F-actin nucleation and myosin force generation for vesicle transport and tethering. New insights are also provided into how myosin activation can be coupled with the generation of actin tracks. Since MyoV binds several Rab GTPases, synchronized nucleator and motor targeting could provide a common mechanism to control force generation and motility in different cellular processes."

Polarized microtubules span the cytoplasm and serve as tracks for fast long-range transport mediated by dynein and kinesin motors. Myosin molecular motors have a functional area limited by the space in which F-actin tracks are found in cells. The very dynamic nature of the actin cytoskeleton promotes transport on more flexible routes beyond the microtubule network. Recent advances in understanding of the functional links between cargos, myosins and actin assembly regulators demonstrate that they cooperate to accomplish specific membrane transport events (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cheng et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Schuh, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Sirotkin et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Sun et al., 2006</a>). For example, the cooperation of class I myosin with the actin nucleator Arp2/3 complex is required for membrane remodeling in endocytosis (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cheng et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Sirotkin et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Sun et al., 2006</a>). In mouse oocytes, actin nucleators Spir and formin-2 (FMN2) cooperate to generate actin filaments at Rab11 vesicle membranes, while myosin Vb (MyoVb) mediates the Rab11 vesicle long-range transport towards the oocyte cortex at metaphase (<a href=\"#bib28\">Pfender et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Schuh, 2011</a>). Moreover, nucleus positioning in mouse oocytes results from myosin V driven active diffusion of Rab11 vesicles, which also requires Spir:formin-2 dependent actin polymerization on these membranes (<a href=\"#bib2\">Ahmed et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Almonacid et al., 2015</a>)."

Direct interaction between the membrane anchored active Rab11 small GTPase and MyoV (MyoVa and MyoVb) globular tail domain (GTD) is necessary to target the motor to Rab11 vesicles (<a href=\"#bib17\">Lapierre et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Lindsay et al., 2013</a>). In contrast, a direct interaction between Spir and Rab11 could not be detected and it is still unclear how differential recruitment of the motors and the actin track regulators can be specified to promote Rab11-vesicle transport. The Spir actin nucleators (Spir-1 and Spir-2 in mammals) encode a FYVE-type zinc finger membrane-binding domain at their C-termini (<a href=\"#bib15\">Kerkhoff et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Otto et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Tittel et al., 2015</a>) that promiscuously interacts with negatively charged lipids (<a href=\"#bib43\">Tittel et al., 2015</a>). It has been proposed that the interaction of Spir proteins with additional factors provides the specificity for its targeting to the correct subpopulation of vesicles (<a href=\"#bib43\">Tittel et al., 2015</a>)."

We have solved the crystal structures of the MyoVa globular tail domain in complex with Spir-2-GTBM and in complex with Rab11. We have also shown that the MyoV-GTD links Spir-2 and Rab11 into a tripartite complex <i>in vitro</i> and in cells. The Spir:MyoV interaction contributes to the motor activation and to the coordination of the specific membrane recruitment of both actin polymerization and motor machineries required for force production powered by MyoV."

Our initial GST-pulldown experiments showed that GST-MyoVb-GTD is able to pull endogenous Spir-1 from mouse brain lysates, as does the GST-FMN2-eFSI protein that binds directly to the Spir KIND domain (<a href=\"#bib27\">Pechlivanis et al., 2009</a>) as a positive control (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). In co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) experiments employing human embryonic kidney cells transiently over-expressing recombinant Spir and MyoV, the full-length Spir-1 and Spir-2 proteins did interact with the GFP-MyoVb-GTD (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). We mapped the Spir sequences necessary for the interaction with MyoVb by successive N-terminal deletions of Spir-2. The deletion of KIND and WH2 domains did not affect complex formation; however, further deletion of the linker region between the WH2 domains and the Spir-box (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>) completely impaired the interaction (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), demonstrating that the Spir central linker region is important for MyoVb-GTD binding. The GTDs of MyoVb and MyoVa are highly conserved (<a href=\"#bib30\">Pylypenko et al., 2013</a>) and both directly interact with Rab11 (<a href=\"#bib20\">Lindsay et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Roland et al., 2009</a>). Interestingly, GFP-MyoVa-GTD also interacts with Spir-2 (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). This is consistent with the fact that MyoVa and MyoVb have overlapping cellular functions (such as mobilization of Rab11 recycling endosomes for the AMPA receptor transport into dendritic spines [<a href=\"#bib8\">Correia et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Hammer and Wagner, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Wang et al., 2008</a>]), share interacting partners and utilize similar mechanisms for Rab11-vesicle transport."

                                "text": "The detected tight binding of MyoV and Spir suggested that they would interact in cells. Transgenic co-expression of tagged full-length MyoVa (eGFP-MyoVa-FL) and Spir-2 (Myc-Spir-2-FL) proteins in HeLa cells showed a perfect colocalization of the two proteins on vesicular structures in the central cytoplasm, consistent with formation of a Spir:MyoV complex at vesicle membranes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). This was also the case for MyoVb and Spir-2 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). In order to confirm a complex formation of Spir-2 and MyoVa on vesicle membranes we performed FLIM-FRET (fluorescence life time imaging, fluorescence resonance energy transfer) microscopy experiments (<a href=\"#bib41\">Sun et al., 2013</a>) with co-expressed AcGFP-MyoVa-GTD as a donor fluorophore and mStrawberry-Spir-2 deletion mutants as acceptor fluorophores. A mStrawberry-tagged C-terminal Spir-2 protein (mStrawberry-Spir-2-GTBM-SB-FYVE), including the Spir-GTBM (necessary for MyoV interaction), the Spir-box and the FYVE-type zinc finger (Spir membrane interaction) is able to reduce the fluorescence lifetime of the AcGFP-MyoVa-GTD donor at vesicle membrane surfaces (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C\u2013E</a>). In contrast, a mStrawberry-fusion protein encoding only the Spir-box and the FYVE-type zinc finger (mStrawberry-Spir-2-SB-FYVE) or a mutant Spir-2-GTBM-SB-FYVE-LALA protein, in which two essential leucines for MyoV interaction were replaced by alanines, did not alter the lifetime of the AcGFP-MyoVa-GTD donor (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). As the lifetime reduction indicates that MyoVa and Spir-2 proteins are in close proximity (within 10 nm of distance between the fluorophores), these results provide a strong support for a direct interaction of the two proteins at vesicle membranes. The MyoVa-GTD is monomeric in solution (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). To exclude a FLIM-FRET signal by a dense packing of proteins at vesicle membranes, we co-expressed green and red-fluorescent protein tagged MyoVa-GTDs as a donor/acceptor pair (AcGFP-MyoVa-GTD, mStrawberry-MyoVa-GTD) which revealed a similar FRET efficiency as the donor alone (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>), indicating that a direct interaction of MyoVa-GTD and the Spir-2-GTBM is required for the observed FLIM-FRET signal."

Importantly, the Spir residues important for the interaction with MyoV-GTD are conserved among Spir proteins (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). The MyoV-GTD is composed of two closely apposed subdomains (SD-1 and SD-2)\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). The Spir-2-GTBM peptide binds to the SD-1 of the MyoVa-GTD in an extended conformation, forming a two-turn alpha helix at the end, in the cleft between helices H3 and H5 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,D</a>). Spir-2-GTBM can be accommodated on the surface of MyoVa without conformational changes in the GTD (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3A,B</a>), and the Spir-GTBM binding pocket is structurally conserved in MyoVb and MyoVc (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3C,D</a>). Consistently, a direct binding assay also showed that MyoVc-GTD binds Spir-2-GTBM with micromolar range affinity (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3E</a>). We thus conclude that the Spir-binding site structural conservation of the three myosin V isoforms explains Spir promiscuity in binding to MyoVa, Vb and Vc."

Both Spir-2-GTBM and MLPH-GTBM bind the MyoVa-GTD with similar micromolar range affinities (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib30\">Pylypenko et al., 2013</a>). However, in contrast to the Spir-GTBM, which interacts with all three MyoV isoforms, the MLPH-GTBM binding is MyoVa specific (<a href=\"#bib46\">Wei et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Pylypenko et al., 2013</a>). The Spir-2 and MLPH GTBMs exhibit some sequence similarity (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>) and comparison of the complex structures shows that their N-terminal regions interact with MyoVa in a very similar way, forming a network of hydrogen bonds with the H4\u2019\u2019-H5-loop and similarly positioning two conserved leucine residues of the motif (L408 and L409 in Spir-2; L188 and L189 in MLPH) within cavities of the MyoVa-GTD surface (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D,E,H</a>). As mentioned above, mutation of the two highly conserved Spir leucine residues to alanines significantly impairs Spir-2 binding to MyoV (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). The Spir-GTBM C-terminal part anchors itself in the MyoVa hydrophobic cleft between helices H3 and H5 using L414 and M417 side chains; and the small side chain of the strictly conserved Ala411 binds in proximity to the MyoVa Tyr1596 side chain (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D,G</a>). The apo-MyoV-GTD surface is preformed to bind Spir-GTBM (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G,H</a>). In contrast to Spir-GTBM, the MLPH-GTBM cannot be accommodated on the surface of apo-MyoVa-GTD without conformational changes (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H</a>). MLPH-GTBM has a conserved hydrophobic residue (Phe, Ile or Val) Phe191 at the position equivalent to the Spir-2-A411 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E,F,H</a>) and its binding to MyoVa requires rotation of the Tyr1596 side chain in\u00a0towards the protein core to harbor the big Phe side chain in the binding pocket (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H,I</a>; <a href=\"#fig4s4\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). As proposed previously (<a href=\"#bib30\">Pylypenko et al., 2013</a>), the conformational change required for MLPH binding is likely more difficult to achieve in other MyoV isoforms due to the sequence differences in the protein core surrounding the Tyr1596. Moreover, the MyoVa Arg1528 that stabilizes the MLPH-GTBM by two hydrogen bonds (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>) is not conserved in the myosin V isoforms and contributes to the MyoVa binding specificity (<a href=\"#bib46\">Wei et al., 2013</a>). The observed differences in how Spir-2-GTBM and MLPH-GTBM bind to MyoV-GTD thus account for their discrepancy in binding specificity."

Interestingly, Spir-GTBM and MLPH-GTBM have a similar distribution of charged residues along the sequence: their N-terminal part is positively charged, and their C-terminal sequence, after the specific binding motif, contains a cluster of negatively charged residues (<a href=\"#fig4s5\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). Thus, Spir-2-GTBM binding to MyoV also likely use the charge complementarity described for MLPH-GTBM binding to MyoVa (<a href=\"#bib30\">Pylypenko et al., 2013</a>). The low amino acid complexity within the GTBM makes it very difficult to generate a reasonable binding motif profile that can be used for a search of other GTBM containing proteins against protein sequence databases. Unfortunately, our attempts to find other proteins potentially capable of MyoV binding failed. However, the polypeptide chain recognized by the GTD has three characteristic properties as follows: (1) the clusters of charged residues may help to orient the peptide relative to the GTD surface, (2) the extended N-terminal region is able to form hydrogen bonds with backbone atoms of the GTD, and (3) the hydrophobic residues of the motif provide the peptide anchoring in small surface pockets of the GTD."

The structures of MyoVa:Spir-GTBM and MyoVa:Rab11a demonstrate that the Rab11 and Spir binding sites are on opposite ends of the elongated MyoV-GTD while the GTD adopts a similar conformation in the two binary complexes. This implies that the two MyoV partners can bind to the GTD at the same time, as shown in a model of the tripartite complex (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>).

Targeted recruitment of either dynein, kinesins or myosins to vesicles is the essential first step in sorting intracellular cargo within cells yet the logistics of motor activation and vesicle localization are poorly understood. Rab11 GTPases recruit several different molecular motors to vesicles, regulating trafficking of exocytic and recycling vesicles along microtubule and actin tracks (<a href=\"#bib47\">Welz et al., 2014</a>). The actin nucleator Spir is also present on the surface of Rab11-vesicles, enabling them to generate their own tracks for transport by MyoV (<a href=\"#bib34\">Schuh, 2011</a>).

Binding of the Spir-GTBM would displace the N-terminal linker and contribute to MyoV activation. MyoV activation is thus predicted to involve a competition between inter-GTDs stabilizing interactions within the motor OFF state and Spir binding to SD-1. The Spir and MLPH GTBMs share an overlapping binding site, suggesting that MLPH could activate MyoV in a manner similar to Spir. Thus, the Spir/MLPH binding site likely represents a MyoV activation hot spot.

Specifically, the insights revealed here into how Spir interacts with MyoV identify a new role for Spir as a critical regulator of MyoV recruitment and activation. Different splice forms and variants of Spir and MyoV are implicated in a wide range of cellular functions, and MyoV interacts with an array of Rab GTPases with roles in a range of transport processes (e.g. Rab3, Rab8 and Rab 32; [<a href=\"#bib6\">Bultema et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Lindsay et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Roland et al., 2011</a>]). This suggests the possibility that Spir:MyoV complexes might be recruited via Spir and Rab membrane interactions to a number of different membrane compartments for transport along their own self-generated local actin network. For example, a splice form of Spir-1 (Spire1C) is specifically localized to the\u00a0mitochondria (<a href=\"#bib22\">Manor et al., 2015</a>) and it is tempting to speculate that it plays a role in recruiting MyoV that has been implicated in regulating the trafficking of this organelle (<a href=\"#bib26\">Pathak et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Schwarz, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Sheng, 2014</a>). Interestingly, it has previously been shown that a class I myosin recruits the Arp2/3 actin nucleator complex to membranes during endocytic vesicle formation (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cheng et al., 2012</a>). Together with the identification here of a tripartite Spir:MyoV:Rab11 complex that recruits formins to membranes, coordination of actin nucleation and myosin motors is likely to be a general strategy used by cells to promote myosin dependent motility of membranes."

The published sequences of <i>Drosophila</i> Spir and human Spir were taken as seeds. All hits were manually analyzed at the genomic DNA level by comparing the three reading frame translations to the multiple sequence alignments of all Spir proteins to reveal homologous regions missing in gene predictions.

The real-time interaction profiles were double referenced using the Scrubber 2.0 software (BioLogic Software,\u00a0Campbell,\u00a0Australia), both the signals from a reference surface (with a non-relevant protein captured on NTA) and from blank experiments using buffer instead of MyoV-GTD were subtracted. The MyoV-GTD concentration-dependence of the steady-state SPR signals was then analyzed to determine the dissociation equilibrium constants (K<sub>d</sub>) of the different complexes using the numerical integration algorithm software Biaevaluation 4.1.

In case of the MyoVa autoregulation/activation experiments, we quantified the MyoVa expression levels. High expression of GFP-MyoVa-D-FL induced vesicular localization, whereas an even cytoplasmic distribution was observed at low expression levels. In order to clearly distinguish between vesicular and cytoplasmic MyoVa localization, we imaged either high or low expressing cells and determined the sum of pixel gray values per cell as a measure for the MyoVa expression levels. Based on that, we only used cells for the autoregulation analysis having a sum of pixel gray values less than 20 \u00d7 10<sup>6</sup> for the expression of GFP-MyoVa-D-FL.

A PCC value of 1 indicates a perfect colocalization, 0 indicates a random colocalization and a PCC value of -1 indicates a mutually exclusive localization of the analyzed signals. To take the noise of each image into account and to gain an objective evaluation of PCC significance, a Costes significance test was performed. Therefore, the pixels in one image were scrambled randomly and the correlation with the other (unscrambled) image was measured. Significance regarding correlation was observed when at least 95% of randomized images show a PCC less than that of the original image, meaning that the probability for the measured correlation of two colors is significantly greater than the correlation of random overlap (<a href=\"#bib9\">Costes et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Pompey et al., 2013</a>).

Here, Pylypenko et al. approached this question by studying how the actin filament nucleator Spir is targeted to myosin V/Rab11 containing vesicles. Using biochemical and cell biological approaches they revealed that a conserved sequence motif in Spir's central linker region binds MyoVa and MyoVb, and they then determined the structural mechanism of this interaction. A curiosity of the structure is that it shows partial overlap between Spir's GTD-Binding Motif and the binding site of melanophilin (MLPH) on the Globular Tail Domain (GTD) of myosin V. They also provide evidence that this interaction is necessary to target Spir to Rab11-positive vesicles, and that it contributes to activation of MyoV. Finally, the authors present the crystal structure of MyoVa's GTD in complex with Rab11."

The reviewers strongly suggest that the authors provide such evidence. For instance, a Spir-2 mutant no longer capable of binding MyoVa/b (such as the LALA mutant of Spir-2 shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>) could be exploited in knockdown-rescue experiments to test the physiological relevance for the identified trimeric Spir-MyoV-Rab11 complex. This could perhaps be approached by using the system described in Morel et al., Dev Cell (2009), where Spir-1 knockdown in HeLa cells results in a decreased number of endocytic actin patches and diminished Lamp1-dextran co-localization. In the event that such experiments turn out to be unfeasible within the timeframe allowed for resubmission by <i>eLife</i>, the authors should at the minimum discuss this issue (the physiological role of the interaction) and propose follow-up experiments to address this matter."

Cell biological studies of Spir function have been complicated in the past by the relative low expression of the proteins. Transient overexpression of Spir proteins (wt and mutants) severely alters the morphology and motility of Rab11 vesicles (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>, mStrawberry Rab11). This makes rescue experiments of knockdown/knockout phenotypes very difficult, especially if they require a quantitative analysis. The novel CRISPR/Cas9 technologies today allow targeted genome editing in immortalized cell lines and thereby the study of proteins and mutants at their endogenous expression levels. In our opinion this will be necessary to quantitatively address the cell biological functions and uncover the complicated equilibrium of protein interactions that govern the actin and microtubule dependent transport of Rab11 vesicles."
