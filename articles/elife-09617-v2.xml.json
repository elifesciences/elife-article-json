We sought to determine whether, like tapasin, TAPBPR can also influence MHC class I peptide selection by functioning as a peptide exchange catalyst. We show that TAPBPR can catalyse the dissociation of peptides from peptide-MHC I complexes, enhance the loading of peptide-receptive MHC I molecules, and discriminate between peptides based on affinity in vitro. In cells, the depletion of TAPBPR increased the diversity of peptides presented on MHC I molecules, suggesting that TAPBPR is involved in restricting peptide presentation. Our results suggest TAPBPR binds to MHC I in a peptide-receptive state and, like tapasin, works to enhance peptide optimisation. It is now clear there are two MHC class I specific peptide editors, tapasin and TAPBPR, intimately involved in controlling peptide presentation to the immune system."

We sought to determine whether, like tapasin, TAPBPR can also influence MHC class I peptide selection by functioning as a peptide exchange catalyst. We show that TAPBPR can catalyse the dissociation of peptides from peptide-MHC I complexes, enhance the loading of peptide-receptive MHC I molecules, and discriminate between peptides based on affinity in vitro. In cells, the depletion of TAPBPR increased the diversity of peptides presented on MHC I molecules, suggesting that TAPBPR is involved in restricting peptide presentation. Our results suggest TAPBPR binds to MHC I in a peptide-receptive state and, like tapasin, works to enhance peptide optimisation. It is now clear there are two MHC class I specific peptide editors, tapasin and TAPBPR, intimately involved in controlling peptide presentation to the immune system."

                        "text": "Major histocompatibility complex\u00a0(MHC) class I molecules convey a selection of the peptidome of a cell to the immune system. As well as being of crucial importance for the detection of intracellular pathogens, particularly viruses, it is now apparent that peptide presentation by MHC class I is extremely relevant in the recognition of tumours (<a href=\"#bib33\">R\u00f6tzschke et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Duan et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Gubin et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Snyder et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Yadav et al., 2014</a>). Despite this, the molecular mechanisms controlling peptide selection for immune recognition are still poorly understood. Currently, the loading of peptide onto MHC class I is known to be orchestrated by the co-factor tapasin and is thought to occur predominantly within the peptide loading complex (PLC) in the endoplasmic reticulum (<a href=\"#bib34\">Sadasivan et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Li et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Ortmann et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Lehner et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Tan et al., 2002</a>). Tapasin enhances the rate and the extent of MHC class I peptide loading and improves the discrimination that occurs between peptides to ensure MHC class I molecules are loaded with high-affinity peptides, thus prolonging cell surface expression of MHC class I molecules (<a href=\"#bib45\">Williams et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Howarth et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Chen and Bouvier, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Wearsch and Cresswell, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">van Hateren et al., 2013</a>). MHC class I allomorphs differ in their dependence on tapasin for efficient peptide loading (<a href=\"#bib11\">Greenwood et al., 1994</a>;\u00a0 <a href=\"#bib28\">Peh et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Williams et al., 2002</a>). Furthermore, the ability to select and assemble with an optimal peptide cargo in the absence of tapasin is inversely correlated to the enhancement observed in the presence of tapasin (<a href=\"#bib45\">Williams et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">van Hateren et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Rizvi et al., 2014</a>)."

                        "text": "It has recently become apparent that, in addition to tapasin, there is a second MHC class I-specific chaperone, the tapasin-related protein TAPBPR (<a href=\"#bib5\">Boyle et al., 2013</a>). In contrast to tapasin, TAPBPR is not an integral component of the peptide loading complex and cannot compensate for the loss of tapasin (<a href=\"#bib5\">Boyle et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Hermann et al., 2013</a>). Currently, the precise function of TAPBPR in the MHC class I pathway is unknown (<a href=\"#bib14\">Hermann et al., 2015</a>). A functional role in MHC class I antigen presentation is supported by the finding that the presence of TAPBPR slows the anterograde trafficking of MHC class I and prolongs the association of MHC class I with the PLC. This raises the possibility that TAPBPR serves as an additional quality control checkpoint in the MHC class I antigen presentation pathway (<a href=\"#bib5\">Boyle et al., 2013</a>). Although tapasin and TAPBPR only share 22% identity (<a href=\"#bib42\">Teng et al., 2002</a>), both bind MHC class I, and their orientation on MHC class I is similar (<a href=\"#bib8\">Dong et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Hermann et al., 2013</a>). This shared orientation raises the possibility that there is some common functionality between the two molecules, particularly in regard to the ability to influence the peptide repertoire presented on MHC class I. Here, we sought to determine whether, like tapasin, TAPBPR has a peptide editing function."

Due to the intrinsically low affinity between tapasin and MHC class I molecules in vitro, soluble tapasin function on MHC class I is only measurable when the two molecules are brought into close proximity via a Jun/Fos leucine zipper (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chen and Bouvier, 2007</a>) or when tapasin is conjugated to ERp57 (<a href=\"#bib44\">Wearsch and Cresswell, 2007</a>). Since TAPBPR is not integrated into the PLC and can be co-immunoprecipitated with MHC I (<a href=\"#bib5\">Boyle et al., 2013</a>, <a href=\"#bib13\">Hermann et al., 2013</a>), it is likely that TAPBPR has a higher affinity for MHC class I than tapasin.

Using fluorescent polarisation we tested whether TAPBPR enhanced peptide dissociation from HLA-A2, an allomorph that co-immunoprecipitates readily with TAPBPR (<a href=\"#bib13\">Hermann et al., 2013</a>). HLA-A*02:01 molecules were loaded with the fluorescent peptide FLPSDC*FPSV (C* indicates the position of the fluorophore) before excess unlabelled FLPSDCFPSV peptide was added in the presence or absence of TAPBPR. Dissociation of FLPSDC*FPSV was only apparent in the first six hours in the presence of competitor peptide and TAPBPR (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Dissociation of FLPSDC*FPSV was also observed when a vast excess of unlabelled NLVPMVATV was used in the presence of TAPBPR (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). To ensure the enhancement of peptide dissociation was a consequence of direct interaction between TAPBPR and HLA-A2, we repeated the peptide dissociation assays using TAPBPR<sup>TN5</sup> (I261K) which inhibits the ability of TAPBPR to bind to HLA-A2 (<a href=\"#bib13\">Hermann et al., 2013</a>). No enhancement in the dissociation of FLPSDC*FPSV was observed in the presence of TAPBPR<sup>TN5</sup> (red line <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>).

We found that TAPBPR catalysed binding of FLPSDC*FPSV to peptide-receptive HLA-A*02:01 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>).

The dissociation rates of all peptides were enhanced in the presence of TAPBPR and in the presence of tapasin-jun as compared to competing peptide alone (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). However, peptide specific differences were apparent in the ability of tapasin-jun and TAPBPR to enhance dissociation. As different concentrations of active tapasin-jun and TAPBPR proteins were present in these assays, it was not possible to directly compare the dissociation half-lives of specific peptides in the presence of tapasin-jun with TAPBPR. Therefore we compared the hierarchies of dissociation relative to one peptide (KLWEAESK*L) over four independent experiments. This revealed reproducible differences in the hierarchies of peptide dissociation between tapasin-jun and TAPBPR on HLA-A2 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E\u2013G</a>). Interestingly the half-life hierarchy for tapasin was similar to the hierarchy observed in the absence of either cofactor (competitor only) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E,F</a>), with the exception of the dissociation of GLDDIKDLK*V whose dissociation was relatively much slower in the presence of tapasin-jun compared to the other peptides than was observed in the presence of competitor only. This suggests that tapasin enhancement of peptide dissociation generally parallels peptide-MHC complex stability, as previously reported (<a href=\"#bib15\">Howarth et al., 2004</a>). However, the half-life of peptides in the presence of TAPBPR does not follow this trend (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>). Specifically we observed that in comparison to the other peptides, TAPBPR enhanced dissociation of KLVK*EVIAV to a much smaller extent than was apparent in the presence of tapasin-jun or absence of either cofactor (competitor only) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E\u2013G</a>). The same was also true of FLPSDC*FPSV (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E\u2013G</a>). Taken together our results suggest firstly that both tapasin and TAPBPR enhance peptide dissociation, and secondly that there are subtle differences in regard to their peptide specificity."

We wondered if TAPBPR generally exhibited preference for HLA-A allomorphs or whether TAPBPR might interact with HLA-B allomorphs. To explore this, we expressed a small panel of individual HLA allomorphs in the MHC class I negative cell line 721.221, and determined their interaction with endogenous TAPBPR, in a system in which competition between MHC class I allomorphs is absent. Immunoprecipitation of TAPBPR, followed by western blotting for MHC class I, confirmed the strong association between TAPBPR and the HLA-A allomorphs HLA-A2 and HLA-A68 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). However, an association between TAPBPR and HLA-B allomorphs was also detected, although this was weaker (HLA-B8 and -B15), or below the limits of detection (HLA-B40), compared to that for HLA-A2 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). Therefore, although there is clearly a strong association with those HLA-A allomorphs tested, TAPBPR interacts with a broader range of HLA molecules than originally appreciated (<a href=\"#bib5\">Boyle et al., 2013</a>)."

We first asked whether TAPBPR enhanced peptide dissociation from HLA-B*08:01fos molecules. We found that dissociation of EIYK*RWIIL was enhanced in the presence of TAPBPR (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). No enhancement of the dissociation of EIYK*RWIIL was observed in the presence of TAPBPR using HLA-B8:01-T134K in which the T134 residue had been mutated to lysine, which abrogates binding of TAPBPR to MHC I (<a href=\"#bib13\">Hermann et al., 2013</a>) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), demonstrating that the enhanced peptide dissociation was dependent on a direct interaction between TAPBPR and HLA-B8. We also tested the ability of TAPBPR to enhance dissociation of two additional peptides, ELRSRK*WAI and FLRGRK*YGL from HLA-B*08:01. The dissociation of ELRSRK*WAI was not altered in the presence of TAPBPR (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>) and only a very slight change in dissociation of FLRGRK*YGL was observed in the presence of TAPBPR (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). Therefore, our results suggest that TAPBPR can enhance peptide dissociation from HLA-B8 but that this effect is peptide specific. Tapasin has also been reported to exhibit peptide specificity in regard to peptide dissociation (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chen and Bouvier, 2007</a>). Like TAPBPR, tapasin-jun accelerated dissociation of fluorescein isothiocyanate\u00a0(FITC) labelled versions of both EIYK*RWIIL and FLRGRK*YGL from HLA-B*08:01fos, while the dissociation of ELRSRK*WAI was insensitive to tapasin-jun (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chen and Bouvier, 2007</a>)."

Tapasin expression was not affected by the sgRNA targeted to TAPBPR (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). In the absence of TAPBPR, cell surface expression of MHC class I in IFN-\u03b3 treated HeLa did not significantly change as determined by W6/32 staining and flow cytometry (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). When the amino acid sequences of the peptides eluted from MHC class I molecules from IFN-\u03b3 treated HeLa and HeLa-TAPBPR KO cells were compared, the most noticeable difference was a change in the diversity of peptides isolated (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). In IFN-\u03b3 treated HeLa cells, we isolated 1607 different peptides on MHC class I, compared with 2074 in IFN-\u03b3 treated HeLa-TAPBPR KO cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). 1398 peptides were shared between the two cell lines, but 209 peptides were unique to HeLa and 676 were unique to HeLa-TAPBPR KO (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). When the peptides were subdivided into those predicted to bind to HLA-A*68:02 or HLA-B*15:03 based on anchor sequences, an increased repertoire was observed for both allomorphs in the absence of TAPBPR (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Consistent with these findings, a similar pattern of increased peptide diversity was also observed in IFN-\u03b3 treated HeLa-S cells upon TAPBPR depletion using shRNA to TAPBPR (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

Again the most obvious difference was a change in the diversity of peptides isolated (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). We found the total number of different peptides isolated from MHC class I was decreased in cells over-expressing TAPBPR, from 819 MHC class I restricted peptides from HeLa cells down to 296 MHC class I restricted peptides isolated from HeLa cells over-expressing TAPBPR. 210 peptides were shared between the two cell lines (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). Again, when these peptides were further sub-divided into those predicted to bind to HLA-A*68:02 and -B*15:03 based on their motif, an increased repertoire was observed for both allomorphs in the absence of TAPBPR (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). Taken together, these results suggest that TAPBPR restricts the peptide repertoire presented on MHC class I molecules. We compared the anchor residues found at the P2 and C-terminal (P\u03a9) position of the shared peptides, eluted from either TAPBPR negative or TAPBPR expressing cells, which will presumably be permitted release in TAPBPR expressing cells, with unique peptides exclusively eluted from TAPBPR negative cells (HeLa or HeLa-TAPBPR KO+IFN-\u03b3), which are therefore usually removed or restricted by TAPBPR. We found there was an enhancement of canonical anchor residues in the peptides eluted from TAPBPR expressing cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E\u2013H</a>). For example, in IFN-\u03b3 treated HeLa cells 53% of the shared peptides predicted to be bound to HLA-A*A68:02 (which had presumably been subjected to TAPBPR function) had classic anchor residues (P2 = threonine or valine, P\u03a9 = valine or leucine) compared to 43% of the peptides found exclusively in TAPBPR deficient cells which\u00a0are\u00a0the peptides that TAPBPR usually restricts (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). More striking was the restriction of peptides predicted to be bound by HLA-B*15:03 in cells over-expressing TAPBPR (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5H</a>) with only 5% of the peptides eluted exclusively from TAPBPR deficient cells (i.e. the TAPBPR restricted peptides) containing classical anchor motifs (P2 = glutamine or lysine, P\u03a9 = tyrosine or phenylalanine) compared to 24% of the peptides eluted from TAPBPR over expressing cells (i.e. the TAPBPR permitted peptides). This suggests TAPBPR restriction in vivo helps to remove some peptides of lower affinity and therefore assists in improving peptide selection on MHC class I. We found TAPBPR expression did not have a dramatic effect on peptide length (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

TAPBPR was isolated in complex with MHC I from IFN-\u03b3 induced KBM-7 cells (which are HLA-A2+), then incubated in the presence or absence of 100 \u03bcM of the HLA-A2 binding peptide NLVPMVATV. Western blot analysis of the proteins co-immunoprecipitated with TAPBPR revealed a &gt;90% reduction in the amount of HLA-A2 bound to TAPBPR following the addition of the NLVPMVATV peptide (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). To ensure this was a consequence of direct peptide binding to HLA-A2, we tested NLVPMVATV peptide variants in which the anchor residues at position 2 and 9 were substituted, thus lowering the avidity of the peptide. Less dissociation of HLA-A2 from TAPBPR was observed using N<span class=\"underline\">A</span>VPMVATV (\u03942) and NLVPMVAT<span class=\"underline\">M</span> (\u03949) peptides, in which one anchor residue had been substituted, while the N<span class=\"underline\">A</span>VPMVAT<span class=\"underline\">M</span> (\u03942/9) peptide, in which both anchor residues were substituted was unable to induce any HLA-A2 dissociation (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). Next we asked whether peptide loaded HLA-A2 molecules were released from TAPBPR following peptide addition by performing a second immunoprecipitation using BB7.2 from the peptide-treated eluates. Peptide loaded HLA-A2 was released from TAPBPR upon incubation with the NLVPMVATV peptide but not in the absence of the peptide (lanes 2 and 1 respectively <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). Only trace amounts of peptide loaded HLA-A2:\u03b22m molecules were released from TAPBPR using the \u03942 and \u03949 peptides (lane 3 and 4, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>), while no peptide loaded HLA-A2 was released from TAPBPR using the \u03942/9 peptide (lane 5 <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). Together these results demonstrate that MHC I molecules bound to TAPBPR are in a peptide-receptive state and that the association between TAPBPR and MHC I is reduced by high affinity peptide resulting in peptide loaded MHC I being released from TAPBPR."

                                "text": "HLA allomorphs differ in their dependency on tapasin for efficient surface expression. Previous studies have reported that, although the quantity of naturally processed peptides stably bound by HLA-A*02:01 is significantly reduced in the absence of tapasin (<a href=\"#bib3\">Barber et al., 2001</a>), surface expression of HLA-A2 is relatively unaffected in the absence of tapasin (<a href=\"#bib11\">Greenwood et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Barber et al., 2001</a>). In contrast, HLA-B7 expression is reduced in the absence of tapasin (<a href=\"#bib32\">Rizvi et al., 2014</a>). As TAPBPR is also involved in peptide selection on MHC class I molecules, we sought to examine the effect of TAPBPR depletion on surface expression of both HLA-A2 and HLA-B7 in the presence and the absence of tapasin. To investigate this, 721.221 (tapasin positive, MHC class I negative) (<a href=\"#bib37\">Shimizu et al., 1988</a>) and 721.220 (tapasin negative, HLA-A, -B negative, but HLA-Cw1 positive) (<a href=\"#bib11\">Greenwood et al., 1994</a>) cells were transduced with HLA-A2 and -B7 and then depleted of TAPBPR using shRNA. This resulted in a significant, although not complete, reduction of TAPBPR expression (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). Tapasin expression in 721.221 cells was not altered in cells expressing shTAPBPR (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). Consistent with our previous findings in tapasin deficient KBM-7 cells (<a href=\"#bib13\">Hermann et al., 2013</a>), we found an increased interaction between HLA-A2 and TAPBPR in the absence of tapasin in the 721 cell line series (compare TAPBPR IP lanes 1 and 3, <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>) which was apparent even though the expression of TAPBPR appeared to be slightly higher in\u00a0.220 cells compared to\u00a0.221 cells. This phenomenon does not appear to be restricted to HLA-A2, as we similarly observed an increased interaction between HLA-B7 and TAPBPR in the absence of tapasin (compare TAPBPR IP lanes 1 and 3, <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). The increased association between TAPBPR and MHC class I occurs despite the fact that the steady state level of both HLA-B7 and HLA-A2 is severely reduced in the absence of tapasin (compare lysate lanes 1 and 3, <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). We found that the steady state level of HLA-A2 at the cell surface was not affected by TAPBPR depletion in tapasin sufficient cells (left panel <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>). However, the depletion of TAPBPR in tapasin negative cells resulted in a \u223c75% decrease in cell surface expression of HLA-A2 (right panel <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>). In contrast, using an antibody to the Bw6 epitope we observed a significant decrease in the surface expression of HLA-B7 upon depletion of TAPBPR, even in the presence of tapasin (left panel <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>). This is despite the poor ability of HLA-B7 to co-immunoprecipitate with TAPBPR, as compared with HLA-A2 with TAPBPR (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). Only residual expression of HLA-B7 was observed upon the depletion of TAPBPR in the tapasin negative cell 721.220 (right panel <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>). These results suggest that HLA allomorphs differ in their dependency on TAPBPR, and that tapasin and TAPBPR work together to optimise surface expression of MHC class I molecules."

To test directly whether HLA molecules are indeed loaded with low affinity peptides in the absence of TAPBPR, we compared the stability of MHC class I molecules in the presence and absence of TAPBPR. First, the thermal stability of HLA-A2 molecules expressed in TAPBPR-competent and TAPBPR-depleted cells in the presence or absence of tapasin was investigated by heating lysates of radiolabelled cells for a short time, followed by immunoprecipitation with BB7.2 (specific for peptide loaded HLA-A2). We found that the thermal stability of HLA-A2 was reduced in TAPBPR depleted cells (compare grey bar with the red bar in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a>). As the thermal stability of MHC class I correlates with the affinity of its peptide cargo (<a href=\"#bib45\">Williams et al., 2002</a>), these results support the hypothesis that TAPBPR assists in the selection of stable peptides on MHC class I molecules. However, the effect of TAPBPR depletion on HLA-A2 thermal stability was not as severe as that observed in the absence of tapasin (compared red and blue bars in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>). The thermal stability of peptide loaded HLA-A2 was further decreased when TAPBPR was depleted in tapasin negative cells (green bar in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>).

For HLA-A2, tapasin deficiency had a more severe effect than TAPBPR depletion on the rate of decay (compare the blue line with the red line in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E</a>) while for HLA-B7, tapasin deficiency and TAPBPR depletion had a similar effect on the decay rate (see the overlap of the blue and red line in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8F</a>).

This suggests that the luminal region of TAPBPR alone has sufficient affinity for MHC class I to promote peptide loading and to catalyse peptide exchange and does not require other co-factors or to be artificially tethered to MHC class I to perform this function. This is in contrast to soluble tapasin, which others have found does not associate productively with MHC class I in vitro alone, and instead requires either conjugation to ERp57 or to be artificially tethered to MHC class I (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chen and Bouvier, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Wearsch and Cresswell, 2007</a>). We speculate the difference in affinity of tapasin and TAPBPR for MHC class I may have evolved as a consequence of the distinct cellular environment the two peptide exchange catalysts function: tapasin functioning in the context of the PLC, where other proteins collectively form a mutually supportive interaction scaffold, and TAPBPR functioning outside the confines of the PLC. Although both tapasin and TAPBPR clearly function as peptide exchange catalysts in vitro, the activities of the two proteins are not identical. Firstly, we observed differences in the ability of tapasin-jun and TAPBPR to promote dissociation of peptides from HLA-A*02:01. Secondly, we found TAPBPR was unable to promote the binding of ELRSRK*WAI or FLRGRK*YGL to peptide receptive HLA-B*08:01fos molecules, whereas Chen &amp; Bouvier found that tapasin-jun enhanced the binding of FITC labelled variants of both these peptides (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chen and Bouvier, 2007</a>).

Our findings are consistent with tapasin and TAPBPR working together in a sequential manner (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>). The initial peptide loading of MHC I molecules is likely to occur within the PLC and to be assisted by tapasin. Within this relatively peptide-rich environment, peptide loading and exchange mediated by tapasin increases the affinity of peptide bound to MHC class I. We propose that outside of the PLC, the stability of peptide:MHC I complexes is monitored by TAPBPR. Those molecules loaded with high affinity peptides will either circumvent TAPBPR-mediated peptide editing completely or pass through this quality control checkpoint. For MHC class I molecules loaded with peptides of intermediate or low affinity, TAPBPR-mediated peptide editing proceeds. The unique environments in which tapasin and TAPBPR have evolved to operate in are likely to shape the peptide repertoire in different ways. The relatively peptide-rich environment of the PLC may allow tapasin to promote peptide binding and produce a relatively broad peptide repertoire. However, presumably as an MHC I molecule moves away from the PLC, the gradient of optimal peptides is likely to decrease and therefore TAPBPR-mediated peptide editing events within such an environment may favour peptide dissociation rather than association. Thus we speculate that, in a peptide rich environment, acceleration of both association and dissociation (by tapasin) contributes to editing; while in a peptide dilute environment, acceleration of dissociation only (by TAPBPR) may dominate editing, consistent with the increased peptide repertoire observed in TAPBPR deficient cells. Thus, TAPBPR may restrict peptide presentation by enhancing the selection of high affinity peptide on MHC class I."

For HLA-A2, TAPBPR catalyses both the peptide dissociation and association in vitro, in a similar manner described for the function of tapasin, albeit with different peptide preference. Therefore, there may be shared, but not identical, functionality between tapasin and TAPBPR regarding peptide selection onto HLA-A2, i.e. in a peptide abundant environment both chaperones could potentially load and edit peptides bound to HLA-A2. This may explain, at least in part, why surface expression of HLA-A2 is relatively tapasin-independent (<a href=\"#bib19\">Lewis et al., 1998</a>). Surface expression of HLA-A2 is also TAPBPR-independent in the presence of tapasin, and it is not until tapasin and TAPBPR are absent or depleted that a severe effect is observed on HLA-A2 surface expression. In the absence of both tapasin and TAPBPR, surface expression of HLA-A2 resembles that of the HLA-A2 T134K mutant (<a href=\"#bib18\">Lewis et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Peace-Brewer et al., 1996</a>). Therefore the discovery of a peptide editing function for TAPBPR helps explain the previous discrepancies regarding the phenotype of the T134K mutant (in which the HLA-A2 mutant is unable to interact with either tapasin or TAPBPR and exhibits low cell surface expression) and tapasin-deficient cells (in which the HLA-A2 binds TAPBPR and exhibits high cell surface expression)."

                        "text": "Our results clearly demonstrate that TAPBPR also plays a significant role in peptide selection by HLA-B molecules. This importance of TAPBPR in HLA-B biology was underappreciated previously when investigating the interaction between TAPBPR and HLA-B in HeLa cells (<a href=\"#bib5\">Boyle et al., 2013</a>). Although all the HLA-B molecules investigated here (HLA-B7, -B8, -B15 and -B40) exhibit weak or transient association with TAPBPR as compared to HLA-A2 in wild-type cells, the interaction between HLA-B7 and TAPBPR was significantly increased in the absence of tapasin as shown in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>. TAPBPR clearly influenced peptide selection on all of these HLA-B molecules: fluorescent polarisation experiments demonstrate that TAPBPR functions as a peptide loading and exchange catalyst for EIYK*RWIIL on HLA-B8; TAPBPR deficiency in IFN-\u03b3 induced HeLa and KBM-7 cells alters the peptide repertoire expressed by HLA-B15 and HLA-B40 respectively; and depletion of TAPBPR in 721.221 results in a significant decrease in the surface expression of HLA-B7, even in the presence of tapasin. Taken together, these results suggest that TAPBPR is responsible for restricting peptides on HLA-B allomorphs. Clearly, peptide selection by MHC class I molecules is far more complex than previously anticipated. Given that a single T-cell receptor\u00a0(TCR) can in principle see many different peptide-MHC class I complexes (<a href=\"#bib36\">Sewell, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Wooldridge et al., 2012</a>), the two MHC specific chaperones of the MHC class I antigen presentation pathway, may be the crucial influence in selecting immune responses."

Peptides with a charge state other than 2+ or 3+ were rejected from fragmentation. Fragment mass spectra of the five most intense ions of each scan cycle were recorded in the linear ion trap (top5 CID).

To determine classic peptide anchor conservation, TAPBPR permitted peptides (shared peptides) and TAPBPR restricted peptides (peptides unique to HeLa-TAPBPR KO cells or peptides unique to HeLa cells) were compared and the frequency of classic anchors at P2 or P\u03a9 calculated for both HLA-A*68:02 or HLA-B*15:03."

They show that TAPBPR, a tapasin-like protein which was discovered earlier by some members of this group, is a peptide editor for selective loading of MHC I molecules. Unlike tapasin, which functions in the peptide-loading complex (PLC) in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), TAPBPR apparently carries out its peptide editing functions outside the PLC and this editing function does not overlap with that of tapasin. This is a significant advance in our understanding of the peptide-selection mechanisms in the MHC class I antigen processing pathway."

While it is possible to do these experiments, we feel the results would be entirely dependent on the particular peptide we happen to pick from the peptide pool. As our peptide lists have thousands of different peptides and we can only analyse perhaps ten of these peptides in the assay (which would only represent 1% of the total peptide pool) we feel this approach might not be reflective of TAPBPR function on the whole population of peptide and we might inadvertently skew the data depending on the particular 1% of peptides we selected to test in our assay."

This new data can be found <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> (sections E-H). Using this approach, we observed a larger percentage of peptides which are permitted release by TAPBPR have classic anchor residues compared to the peptides restricted by TAPBPR. These results suggest there is some enhancement of peptide anchors on MHC I by TAPBPR and hence TAPBPR has the potential to remove some peptides with lower affinity. We hope this new data analysis fully answers the reviewers point regarding TAPBPR editing out some peptides of lower affinity within a cellular environment."
