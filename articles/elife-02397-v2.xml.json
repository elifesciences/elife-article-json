Pathological disruptions of basal ganglia signaling produce profound deficits in the timing (<a href=\"#bib12\">Buhusi and Meck, 2005</a>), vigor (<a href=\"#bib60\">Turner and Desmurget, 2010</a>), and initiation (<a href=\"#bib38\">Mink, 1996</a>) of voluntary movements. While it is thus clear that the basal ganglia are critical for voluntary movement, the specific mechanisms by which movement is controlled by basal ganglia activity remain unclear (<a href=\"#bib60\">Turner and Desmurget, 2010</a>). Voluntary control of movement can be explained in terms of optimal feedback control theory (<a href=\"#bib20\">Diedrichsen et al., 2010</a>). The basal ganglia circuit can be described as an extended loop that begins with projections from deep layer cortical neurons and ultimately returns to the cortex via projections from the basal ganglia to the ventral thalamus (<a href=\"#bib29\">Haber, 2003</a>). However, the basal ganglia circuit also contains intrinsic feedback projections (<a href=\"#bib24\">Gerfen, 2004</a>). In engineered control systems, feedback is critical for stable performance (<a href=\"#bib3\">Astrom and Murray, 2008</a>)."

The vast majority of neurons in the SNr are projection neurons that synthesize and release the neurotransmitter \u03d2-aminobutryic acid (GABA). Projection neurons of the SNr target pre-motor areas in the ventral thalamus, dorsal midbrain, and tegmentum (<a href=\"#bib47\">Parent, 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Hikosaka, 2007</a>). In addition to these long range targets, nigral projection neurons also elaborate axon collaterals within the SN (<a href=\"#bib36\">Mailly et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Cebri\u00e1n et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Deniau et al., 2007a</a>). There are no known interneurons in the SNr (<a href=\"#bib18\">Deniau et al., 2007a</a>), and thus collaterals of projection neurons are the sole source of intrinsic feedback for the basal ganglia output. Anatomical reconstructions have indicated that the axon collaterals of SNr projection neurons are sparse (<a href=\"#bib36\">Mailly et al., 2003</a>). The functional impact of this intranigral microcircuit remains unclear. Antidromic activation of SNr projection neurons in anesthetized animals has been used to infer the presence of inhibition via projection neurons collaterals (<a href=\"#bib56\">Tepper and Lee, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Brazhnik et al., 2008</a>); however, the relative impact, spatial organization and temporal properties of recruitment of feedback inhibition via SNr collateral inhibition remains largely unknown. In this study, we explore the hypothesis that the microcircuit formed by SNr collaterals could implement a critical negative feedback node in the context of a control system for voluntary behavior that is implemented in the extended cortico-basal ganglia circuit."

For example, at steady state or in the absence of change in the state of the system, there may be no obvious effect of appropriately functioning negative feedback. However, sudden transitions in the state of the system can reveal the contribution of negative feedback\u2014altering, for example, the gain and/or the time course of settling around transitions. By analogy to an engineered system, the SNr microcircuit may have little apparent impact in the absence of sudden changes in the state of the population activity. However, changes in behavior and receipt of sensory stimuli are accompanied by phasic transitions, both increases and decreases, in the activity of the SNr population. We thus reasoned that the role of negative feedback, implemented by the SNr microcircuit, could become apparent under such conditions. Recent work has shown that a salient or conditioned stimulus (CS), for example an auditory tone, can lead to phasic changes in the activity of SNr neurons in rodents (<a href=\"#bib51\">Schmidt et al., 2013</a>). Moreover, these short-latency modulations of activity are predictive of the initiation of conditioned behavioral responses\u2014that is action selection (<a href=\"#bib45\">Pan et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Schmidt et al., 2013</a>). If the basal ganglia act as a control system for behavior, then we would predict that control over the gain or dynamic range of these phasic modulations should be critical for normal voluntary actions."

This optogenetic approach allowed us to stimulate SNr GABA neurons with high temporal and spatial resolution without contamination from excitatory afferents, dopaminergic transmission, or afferent inhibitory input from the striatonigral projection both in vitro and in vivo."

However, we also observed that activation of the SNr projection neuron population could elicit a large and potent feedback inhibition capable of shaping output activity. Here, we show that this unique combination of effects is the result of a number of distinctive features of the SN microcircuit: (1) postsynaptic currents resulting from collateral synaptic input provided robust inhibition with a rapid onset during strong activation of the network; (2) unitary connections are weak with sufficiently low release probability to sustain release during repetitive stimulation; (3) asynchronous basal inhibition in the tonically active network is effectively compensated for by intrinsic conductances that sustain tonic spiking; (4) the potency of feedback inhibition is proportional to total activation of the microcircuit due to a sparse, spatially diffuse connectivity. Together, these properties of the intrinsic microcircuit of the SNr implement a robust inhibition that is rapidly and stably recruited in proportion to the sustained activation of the projection neuron population with little effect in the absence of stimulation\u2014in other words, the inhibitory microcircuit of the SNr mediates a divisive gain control on the basal ganglia output."

In other words, if there were more activity producing collateral inhibition, the phasic response to a stimulus could be blunted. To test this possibility, we examined a dataset of 599 single units recorded from the ventral midbrain of mice (<i>n</i> = 5, strongly biased towards recordings from GABAergic neurons in the SN, \u2018Materials and methods\u2019) performing a classical trace conditioning task described previously (<a href=\"#bib45\">Pan et al., 2013</a>). For each individual unit, we computed the normalized response to a salient stimulus (an auditory tone that predicted a delayed reward) as a function of the normalized activity of the simultaneously recorded population of neurons for 32 recording sessions in which at least eight neurons were recorded simultaneously (median = 12; maximum = 21) for each trial in the recording session (median = 71 trials; range = 42:132) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A\u2013B</a>). This yielded a data set of 28,277 comparisons from which we estimated the correlation between the activation of the population at baseline to the activation of each individual neuron in response to the conditioned stimulus (CS). We found that both the population (\u22120.1; p&lt;0.001 permutation test) and 22/32 individual sessions exhibited significant negative correlations (\u22120.12 \u00b1 0.05 SD; p&lt;0.05, permutation test; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>)."

To quantify the gain effect across the population, we compared the normalized response to photostimulation of increasing duration both in the presence and absence of inhibitory synaptic transmission (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>). We found that the response of the population showed a significant increase as a function of stimulus duration and the magnitude of the increase was significantly reduced by the presence of feedback inhibition (two-factor ANOVA; p&lt;0.05). Divisive gain control is characterized by a suppression of spiking at large stimuli but little to no effect on the response to weak or absent stimuli. Consistent with a divisive gain control, we found that baseline firing was unaffected by removal of inhibition (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>, open circles). To contrast a feedback gain control with the effect predicted for subtractive inhibition, we examined recordings from dopamine neurons of the SN that do not express ChR2, but are strongly inhibited by ChR2 expressing projection neurons (<a href=\"#bib45\">Pan et al., 2013</a>). For dopamine neurons, we observed a constant suppression of spiking across the range of stimuli used (<a href=\"#bib45\">Pan et al., 2013</a>). If the reduction in spiking observed during stimulation was the result of feedback inhibition one would predict that the inhibition should onset after the onset of the population response and truncate the response present in the absence of feedback.

While we do not have a direct measure of the total extent of activation of the SNr by our photostimulation, we note that neurons recorded simultaneously experience the same activation state of the network. Thus, we reasoned that the extent of feedback inhibition in a pair of recorded neurons should be correlated if feedback inhibition is proportional to the total activation of the network. Consistent with this prediction, we found that there was a significant correlation (Pearson's correlation, p&lt;0.01 permutation test) in paired recordings (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3I</a>).

Alternatively, tonic spiking could be the solution. For a neuron to repetitively fire it must, upon the return from a spike, exhibit a net membrane current that is inward and thus drives the membrane towards spike threshold (<a href=\"#bib49\">Raman and Bean, 1999</a>). This implies a positive slope conductance combined with a net inward current below threshold (<a href=\"#bib41\">Nolan et al., 2003</a>)\u2014in other words, the conductances that drive repetitive firing oppose hyperpolarizing currents in the perithreshold regime. Combined with a reduced driving force of inhibition near threshold, these biophysical features suggest that SNr neurons are much less sensitive to inhibition than to excitation in this regime. To test this hypothesis explicitly, we performed dynamic clamp experiments in which we systematically varied the balance between a high background rate of IPSCs and EPSCs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D\u2013F</a>). Indeed, we found that the sensitivity of the spike rate to increasing inhibition was much reduced compared to the sensitivity to increasing excitation. Stimulation strongly biased towards an inhibitory conductance often exhibited no effect on the mean spike rate relative to tonic levels. Consistent with the mechanistic model described above, we found that the slope conductance in the perithreshold regime was indeed nonlinear with a sharp positive slope near the inhibitory reversal potential (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Moreover, we found that measured biophysical properties (e.g., slope conductance, spike threshold) were unaffected by pharmacological blockade of inhibition (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

We found that collateral synapses within the SNr exhibited paired pulse ratios (PPR) less than 1 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5H</a>; PPR = 0.91 \u00b1 0.03). While, in direct contrast, the striatonigral synapse was modestly facilitating (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5H</a>; PPR = 1.17 \u00b1 0.05). This latter observation was consistent with a previous study that used extracellular stimulation of the direct pathway (<a href=\"#bib15\">Connelly et al., 2010</a>). The depressing nature of the PPR for local feedback inhibition is unlikely to reflect desensitization of ChR2 as repeated pulses were all suprathreshold under our stimulus conditions (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). These results are thus consistent with a rapid onset of feedback inhibition sufficient to truncate sustained activation of the SNr population."

Collateral synapses provide sufficient inhibition to regulate the gain of the output of the basal ganglia even during strong activation of the network (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>). However, anatomical reconstruction of individual axons suggests a sparse connectivity within the SNr (<a href=\"#bib36\">Mailly et al., 2003</a>). The modest amplitude of individual mIPSCs (\u223c150 pS; <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) and the low cell density of the SNr (<a href=\"#bib24\">Gerfen, 2004</a>) (\u223c30,000 neurons in a \u223c4 mm<sup>3</sup> volume [<a href=\"#bib42\">Oorschot, 1996</a>]) imply that feedback inhibition derives from a substantial volume. The maximal amplitude of evoked IPSCs was 10,000 pS. If we assume a &lt;1% connection probability then we would predict that inhibition would be derived from neurons in a \u223c600 \u03bcm radius from a given postsynaptic neuron. Consistent with such a model our wide-field stimulation experiments suggested that feedback inhibition magnitude scaled similarly for pairs of neurons (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3I</a>). While reconstructions of individual axons have been studied in detail, such results cannot be used to reliably infer the convergence of input onto an individual projection neuron. Moreover, light-level anatomy data cannot reliably predict the functional impact of feedback inhibition. Thus, we next adapted the ChR2-assisited circuit mapping (CRACM) (<a href=\"#bib48\">Petreanu et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Wang et al., 2007</a>) method developed for the neocortex to study the interconnectivity within nigral microcircuit."

We positioned either 81-point or 140-point grids of stimulation sites to cover the SN (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). To achieve high spatial resolution of ChR2 activation, we used a focused 470 nm laser beam that could be rapidly re-positioned to each point on the grid in a pseudorandom sequence that avoided nearest neighbors. The duration of the light pulse was gated so as to deliver brief (&lt;1 ms) pulses of light at each stimulation site. To obtain reliable and spatially homogeneous expression of ChR2 across nigral projection neurons, we used slices from the <i>Thy1</i>-ChR2 transgenic mouse line. Relative to wide-field stimulation or stimulation targeting axonal fibers, we reduced the maximal power of the laser using neutral density filters and performed calibration experiments to find intensities that would evoke precise, time-locked spikes in a small number of neurons with somatodendritic arbors surrounding the stimulation site (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Our data were consistent with a requirement for propagating action potentials to elicit postsynaptic responses and we found no evidence in recorded neurons of direct axonal stimulation under these conditions (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Furthermore, we focused on the rising phase and initial peak of IPSCs to bias our analysis towards transmission that resulted from highly reliable, low jitter spikes initiated at each stimulus site."

(<b>A</b>) Cell-attached recordings from individual SNr neurons were made while a focused laser beam was scanned throughout a pre-defined grid of stimulation points spanning the SNr (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019). SNr neurons are tonically active, firing at \u223c10\u201340 Hz, thus to access which stimulation point evoked reliable spiking, spike traces were averaged over multiple (&gt;3) trials, and voltage responses surrounding stimulation points were superimposed (<b>A</b>, upper). Voltage deflections which exceeded 50% of the maximum amplitude, and which fell within 1 standard deviation (1 SD) of the mean spike latency, were counted as generating reliable spiking. From this a corresponding color map of spiking reliability (scale bar, 0 = not reliable spiking, and 1 = reliable spiking) was generated (<b>A</b>, lower). (<b>B</b>) Whole cell recordings were then made from the same neuron to access photocurrent amplitude at each stimulation point using the same grid as in <b>A</b>. Cells were held at \u221270 mV to isolate ChR2 mediated photocurrent. Averaged photocurrents evoked at each stimulation point were superimposed (<b>B</b>, upper left) and shown with an expanded time scale (<b>B</b>, upper right) and as a corresponding color map of normalized peak amplitudes (<b>B</b>, right; scale bar, 0 = min amplitude, and 1 = max amplitude).

To test whether suprathreshold axonal stimulation of SNr collaterals could evoke synaptic transmission, SNr GABA neurons were voltage-clamped at V<sub>h</sub> + 20 mV to isolate IPSCs.

(<b>F</b>) For a subset of mapping experiments, the latency to the detected IPSC is plotted as a function of distance from soma of the stimulation site. Although the spread is rather large due to variations in latency of evoked spikes by ChR2 positive SNr neurons, there is significant slope towards added propagation delays of \u223c0.5 ms per 1 mm of stimulation distance. This corresponds to roughly 2 m/s conduction velocities, which is comparable to previously obtained estimates (1.7 m/s) in rats (<a href=\"#bib17\">Deniau et al., 1978</a>)."

In contrast to the first prediction, we found that there was no correlation between the location of individual neurons and the source of the strongest inhibition within the SNr. In other words, we found that neurons with non-overlapping dendritic arbors could have largely overlapping inhibitory receptive fields (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>).

We then made focal injections of a <i>cre</i>-dependent virus expressing a red fluorescent protein into the dorsal striatum 2\u20133 weeks prior to performing circuit mapping experiments in midbrain slices (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

In each slice, we performed circuit mapping for three to six projection neurons at a range of distances from the axonal termination fields (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>).

However, we found no clear organization between the striatonigral projection and the maps of feedback inhibition (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,C</a>). The organization of the local inhibitory circuit in relation to the boundaries of striatonigral axonal tracing suggests that there could be a partial separation between the regions that receive input from the medial and lateral striatum (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>, <a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). However, the consistent fall off of the correlation in inhibitory response maps across neurons (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>) suggests that projection neurons receive feedback inhibition from a diffuse microcircuit and independent of the discontinuous topography of feed forward input."

The in vitro preparation presumably reduces or eliminates structured activity in afferent sources of input that could either directly compete with or modulate the consequence of feedback inhibition. Moreover, the length constant of inhibition was similar in the sagittal and coronal planes (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E,F</a>) and thus, the potency of inhibition measured in vitro is, if anything, an underestimate of the impact of intranigral inhibition. We next asked whether we could use a complementary approach to measure the extent of the intranigral microcircuit in the awake mouse. By contrast to the mapping experiments above where we measured at one location (neuron) and stimulated many other locations, we next used either a silicon probe electrode array (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>) or wire array (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) with integrated optical fibers to stimulate at one (somewhat diffuse due to light scattering) location while measuring the spiking activity of SNr neurons at many neighboring locations."

To distinguish these two possibilities in vivo, we examined neurons that exhibited apparent direct excitation (short-latency increase in stimulus evoked firing) with those that exhibited inhibition (stimulus evoked suppression of firing below baseline). We found that inhibition and excitation were recruited with a similar dependence on stimulus intensity consistent with a model in which intranigral inhibition produces a divisive gain effect on the output of SNr projection neurons (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a>)."

Within this extended circuit there are a number of potential feedback projections (<a href=\"#bib21\">Dudman and Gerfen, 2014</a>). However, the only intrinsic source of feedback to the main basal ganglia output nucleus, the SNr, is the microcircuit formed by collaterals of projection neurons (<a href=\"#bib19\">Deniau et al., 2007b</a>).

The diffuse sources of collateral input to SNr projection neurons suggested that feedback inhibition extended across topographic divisions.

                                "text": "In our experiments, we used two approaches to achieve cell-type specific expression of ChR2 in the GABAergic projection neurons of the SNr. Both viral-mediated infection of GABAergic neurons in the SNr and the <i>Thy1</i>-ChR2 transgenic mouse line exhibited cell-type specific expression of ChR2 in GABAergic neurons of the SN, but not in dopamine neurons. GABAergic projection neurons and dopamine neurons are thought to be the only two cell types present in the rodent SN. Importantly, both approaches had indistinguishable properties of inhibition onto both GABAergic projection neurons (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) and onto dopamine neurons (<a href=\"#bib45\">Pan et al., 2013</a>). Moreover, viral mediated expression allowed for the best possible quantitative comparison between feed forward and feedback pathways by ensuring that expression of the ChR2 was controlled by a common promoter (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). Thus, for these results the only significant differences between the virally-mediated and transgenic expression of ChR2 in the SNr was the fraction of the population found to express ChR2 and the resultant magnitude of feedback inhibition. While viral-mediated expression could be used to estimate the divergence of inhibitory projections from a single stimulation site (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>), it was not suitable for comprehensive mapping of convergence onto individual SNr neurons (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figures 6 and 7</a>). The concern in a transgenic mouse line is that ChR2 expression could be present in afferent fibers. To control for this, we blocked excitatory transmission, confirmed that light-activated currents had kinetics expected of ChR2 positive neurons, and confirmed that neurons of the major source of inhibitory input, the striatonigral pathway, did not express ChR2. Consistent with these observations it has previously been suggested that inhibitory fibers in this <i>Thy1</i>-ChR2 mouse line do not express ChR2 (<a href=\"#bib27\">Gradinaru et al., 2009</a>). However, in addition to expression in the SNr, we did also observe that neurons of the external globus pallidus (GPe) express ChR2. The GPe is the source of a projection to the subthalamic nucleus and a more modest projection to the SNr (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bolam et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Gerfen, 2004</a>; ). Nonetheless, we found that potent feedback inhibition could be observed in <i>Gad2</i>-ChR2 mice and that stimulation of GPe axons yielded relatively less inhibition in SNr neurons than either the striatonigral or intranigral pathways under our stimulus conditions. Finally, we used laser powers that were attenuated relative to the powers necessary to directly stimulate severed axons in these mice (data available from the authors on request), consistent with our observation that only perisomatic stimulation was sufficient to evoke reliable spiking in SNr neurons (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

                                "text": "Unlike many other circuits in which gain control has been studied, projection neurons of the SNr are spontaneously active. Divisive gain control requires that there is little effect of inhibition in the absence of stimulation. In the case of gain control mediated by an interneuron this can be achieved in a number of ways, for example, through facilitating inhibitory synaptic transmission (<a href=\"#bib53\">Silver, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>). However, in spontaneously active neurons, it is less clear how to prevent feedback inhibition from altering the baseline firing rate as we observe here. One possibility suggested by our data is that a broad distribution of firing rates (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>) combined with relatively weak individual connections (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>) could produce inhibition that is essentially tonic and too small to significantly affect intrinsic currents that drive repetitive spiking (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) and so is counteracted via subthreshold inward currents necessary for repetitive firing. We provided support for such a model by demonstrating that there is, indeed, a high frequency (200 Hz) of spontaneous IPSCs bombarding SNr projection neurons (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Further consistent with this model, simulation of a steady background rate of IPSCs using dynamic clamp revealed a relative insensitivity of spike rate to a tonic net inhibitory background of inputs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). This balance in the tonic firing rate can be disrupted by synchronously recruiting neighboring neurons to produce a rapid inhibition that, combined with the positive feedback produced by inhibition and subsequent disinhibition, overcomes via de-activation (<a href=\"#bib41\">Nolan et al., 2003</a>) the inward currents that drive the membrane potential towards threshold. This mechanism combining intrinsic properties and synaptic properties is sufficient for a population of spontaneously active inhibitory neurons to implement divisive gain control in the apparent absence of interneurons (<a href=\"#bib19\">Deniau et al., 2007b</a>). To our knowledge this represents a novel circuit mechanism for divisive gain control (<a href=\"#bib53\">Silver, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>)."

On the one hand, it has been argued for some time that the feed forward pathways of the basal ganglia are topographically organized and largely independent (<a href=\"#bib38\">Mink, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Haber, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Hikosaka, 2007</a>). Movement is thus thought to occur when a focal population of projection neurons becomes inhibited by feed forward input and thus disinhibits downstream pre-motor structures. From this perspective, the diffuse intranigral microcircuit could act to release neighboring projection neurons from intranigral inhibition and thereby suppress unintended movements. Thus, during focal activation of the SNr, collateral inhibition may be thought of as a mechanism for contrast enhancement akin to the role of lateral inhibition in sensory systems. This mechanism may be reflected in the time locked, bidirectional changes in the firing of SNr projection neurons that are commonly observed prior to and during movement in mice (<a href=\"#bib45\">Pan et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Fan et al., 2012</a>) and primates (<a href=\"#bib59\">Turner and Anderson, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Nevet et al., 2007</a>)."

In addition, there may be less precise topographic organization of the indirect pathway that enters the SNr via the subthalamic nucleus (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bolam et al., 2000</a>). The subthalamic nucleus also receives direct cortical input and ascending input from the midbrain (<a href=\"#bib14\">Coizet et al., 2009</a>) and hindbrain (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bevan and Bolam, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Winn, 2006</a>). The topographic organization of these ascending pathways is less well understood. Regardless of the topographic precision, the inputs that arrive at the SNr from the subthalamic nucleus convey a great diversity of information and likely exhibit a diversity of dynamics. While there are mechanisms that could maintain activity within a fixed dynamic range in upstream structures (<a href=\"#bib53\">Silver, 2010</a>), individual neurons that constitute the output of cortical areas project to multiple subcortical structures (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kita and Kita, 2012</a>). It is therefore unlikely that the dynamic range of even the cortical output is appropriate for the diverse computations performed in all target structures. To effectively control the basal ganglia output in the presence of such diverse input dynamics and anatomical divergence would seem to require coordinated processing across functional domains. Thus, divisive gain control supplied by a diffuse but potent inhibitory microcircuit could be well suited to ensure that activity remains within a fixed dynamic range."

Upon break in while diffusion of QX314 was allowed time to progress, negative voltage clamp steps were used to measure the hyperpolarization-activated inward (Ih) current. The presence of detectable inward currents was diagnostic for DA neurons. In current clamp recordings lacking QX314 in the internal solution the intracellular spike waveform and spontaneous firing frequency were further used to confirm cell identity. Analysis of postsynaptic currents (direct photocurrents, sIPSC, mIPSCs and evoke IPSCs) and spiking was performed using custom written analysis code in Igor Pro (Wavemetrics). Peak current amplitude was measured as the peak synaptic current relative to the baseline holding current preceding each stimulus. Tonic current amplitude was measured as the peak evoked synaptic current relative to the holding current preceding each train. The conductance (g) underlying IPSCs were calculated from g = IPSC<sub>peak</sub>/(V<sub>m</sub> \u2212 E<sub>CI</sub>), where IPSC<sub>peak</sub> is the peak amplitude of the IPSC and V<sub>m</sub> is the holding voltage.

Analysis of the full field photostimulation was performed using standard analysis metrics as described in the text. To attempt to minimize the variability in estimates of short-term plasticity stimulation was performed at the half-maximum stimulus intensity determined by generation of an input\u2013output function at the beginning of the experiment. The analysis of circuit mapping experiments was more complicated and is described briefly below and demonstrated more explicitly in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>. Briefly, averages of 3\u201310 multisite photostimulation experiments were used in all analyses. The moment of photostimulation was determined by thresholding a photodiode signal positioned in a parallel light path to the stimulation light path. Galvonometer position signals were recovered from the PrairieView software and aligned using a transmitted light laser scanning DIC image of the brain slice. Offline analysis routines automatically detected the orientation of the stimulus grid and applied a rotation to put that grid into 0 rotation orientation. The dorsal and medial edges of the grid were manually annotated and used to flip or further rotate all grids into a common reference frame. The average dimensions of the SN are 1.67 mm wide by 1 mm tall. We found that the average of all grids had an identical (1.67\u20131) aspect ratio. There was modest variation (\u223c10%) in the dimensions of the SNr grids. All grids were linearly stretched or compacted to the same mean aspect ratio and cell positions moved accordingly. Qualitatively similar results were obtained in the presence and absence of warping. Full depth maps were generated by convolving the response amplitude at individual stimulus positions with an empirically-estimated Gaussian response function. An isocontour of the resulting image was generated at the half maximum level using the \u2018contour\u2019 function supplied by Matlab. The center of mass (COM) was also calculated as the vector average of the Euclidean distance to the stimulus position weighted by response magnitude."

Alternatively, it was also suggested that the manuscript would be improved by the inclusion of cell filling (at a minimum from slices but much better from in vivo staining) showing the axonal arborizations of the SNr projection neurons (this could also potentially address the concern above). If is not so, as the authors claim that the level of convergence of the SNr collaterals onto neighboring SNr (or DA) neurons cannot be reliably inferred from anatomical studies such as this, it would be more correct to say that this is beyond the scope of the present study, since many such studies have been performed in the laboratories of Somogyi, Bolam, Magill and others in the basal ganglia and elsewhere."

We roughly agree with the reviewers that there could be a background rate of spiking in the range of 1B2 kHz (50B100 inputs * 20 Hz); although we note that this estimate is somewhat high given that in our attempts to measure the saturating number of synapses some connections were almost certainly the product of severed axons.

Although we, as in many other cases, do not have a direct measure of P<sub>release</sub> it can be estimated. In general P<sub>release</sub> is closer to 0 than to 1 for many central synapses. Likewise, our data are consistent with a low vesicular release probability combined with multiple release sites similar to that reported for Purkinje cell synapses by the Raman Lab (<a href=\"#bib55\">Telgkamp <i>et al.</i> 2004</a>). The most telling piece of data in this regard is the balance between vesicle recycling and vesicle release revealed by sustained stimulation. Despite the fact that SNr collateral synapses are depressing we found that even with sustained stimulation steady state depression is only \u223c50B60% (very similar to that observed at Purkinje synapses; <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2013figure supplement 2</a>.) This is consistent with a low vesicular release probability that allows vesicle recycling to keep pace with release and preventing complete depletion. If we assume release probabilities in the range of \u223c0.1B0.3 (consistent with a binomial fit to the distribution of IPSCs observed in our voltage clamp experiments) we would obtain estimates of the expected background rate of uIPSCs in the range of 100B600 Hz, or less if some of the release sites were in severed axons or silent somata. We have now directly measured the background rate from spontaneous activity and observed a mean of \u223c200 Hz (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, consistent with these predictions."

                    "text": "Question 2) Given a tonic background rate of IPSCs at \u223c200 Hz this would predict that there is a tonic current less than the peak of a unitary event (\u03c4<sub>decay</sub> \u2248 5 ms). The question posed implies that tonic spiking is the problem. We would suggest that tonic spiking is, in this case, the solution. For a neuron to have tonic background firing it means that upon the return from a spike the net membrane current is constantly inward and thus drives the membrane towards threshold and the regenerative spike is triggered. This implies a positive slope conductance with a net inward current below threshold \u2013 in other words the biophysics of the neuron opposes hyperpolarizing currents in the perithreshold regime. This, combined with the reduced driving force of inhibition near threshold, suggests that tonic spiking neurons such as SNr projection neurons should be much less sensitive to inhibition relative to excitation. To test this hypothesis explicitly we performed dynamic clamp experiments in which we systematically varied the balance between a high background rate of inhibition and excitation. Indeed, we find that the sensitivity of SNr projection neurons to high background rates of inhibition is relatively weak compared with excitation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Indeed, for a tonic conductance equivalent to a uIPSC (\u223c150 pS) little or no change in spiking was observed. An alternative or complementary possibility is that homeostatic mechanisms could serve to counteract such changes. Thus, we also examined phase plots of the perithreshold membrane potential dynamics in the presence and absence of inhibition. We found that there was no change in any perithreshold or threshold properties (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2013figure supplement 1</a>). Moreover, we could directly observe the nonlinear kink in the perithreshold slope conductance such that near the inhibitory reversal potential there is a rather steep positive slope conductance that can oppose transient hyperpolarizing currents (i.e<i>.,</i> a background of uIPSCs)."

We propose that this suggests that evolution has discovered multiple implementations using inhibitory interneurons in other circuits, but in the basal ganglia appears to have discovered a mechanism in a circuit lacking interneurons."

If is not so, as the authors claim that the level of convergence of the SNr collaterals onto neighboring SNr (or DA) neurons cannot be reliably inferred from anatomical studies such as this, it would be more correct to say that this is beyond the scope of the present study, since many such studies have been performed in the laboratories of Somogyi, Bolam, Magill and others in the basal ganglia and elsewhere</i>."

We do note that, to our knowledge, the correspondence between boutons and functional synapses has not yet been directly demonstrated at these collateral synapses and Mailly et al. measurements were made in rats not mice. Both points could be addressed by staining for multiple presynaptic protein markers and counting boutons in mice, however we believe this is beyond the scope of our current study."
