This prioritization is achieved through the regulation of phytohormonal signalling networks. However, it remains unknown how this prioritization affects resistance against non-target herbivores. Here, we identify <i>WRKY70</i> as a specific herbivore-induced, MAPK-regulated rice transcription factor that physically interacts with W-box motives and prioritizes defence over growth by positively regulating jasmonic acid (JA) and negatively regulating gibberellin (GA) biosynthesis upon attack by the chewing herbivore <i>Chilo suppressalis</i>. WRKY70-dependent JA biosynthesis is required for proteinase inhibitor (PI) activation and resistance against <i>C. suppressalis</i>. In contrast, WRKY70 induction increases plant susceptibility against the rice brown planthopper <i>Nilaparvata lugens</i>. Experiments with GA-deficient rice lines identify WRKY70-dependent GA signalling as the causal factor in <i>N. lugens</i> susceptibility. Our study shows that prioritizing defence over growth leads to a significant resistance trade-off with important implications for the evolution and agricultural exploitation of plant immunity."
