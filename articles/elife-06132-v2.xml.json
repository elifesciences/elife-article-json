In characterizing early transcriptional changes following drug treatment of mutant EGFR-addicted cells, we identified the stem cell transcriptional regulator SOX2 as being rapidly and specifically induced, both in vitro and in vivo. Suppression of SOX2 sensitizes cells to erlotinib-mediated apoptosis, ultimately decreasing the emergence of acquired resistance, whereas its ectopic expression reduces drug-induced cell death. We show that erlotinib relieves EGFR-dependent suppression of FOXO6, leading to its induction of SOX2, which in turn represses the pro-apoptotic BH3-only genes <i>BIM</i> and <i>BMF</i>. Together, these observations point to a physiological feedback mechanism that attenuates oncogene addiction-mediated cell death associated with the withdrawal of growth factor signaling and may therefore contribute to the development of resistance."

In characterizing early transcriptional changes following drug treatment of mutant EGFR-addicted cells, we identified the stem cell transcriptional regulator SOX2 as being rapidly and specifically induced, both in vitro and in vivo. Suppression of SOX2 sensitizes cells to erlotinib-mediated apoptosis, ultimately decreasing the emergence of acquired resistance, whereas its ectopic expression reduces drug-induced cell death. We show that erlotinib relieves EGFR-dependent suppression of FOXO6, leading to its induction of SOX2, which in turn represses the pro-apoptotic BH3-only genes <i>BIM</i> and <i>BMF</i>. Together, these observations point to a physiological feedback mechanism that attenuates oncogene addiction-mediated cell death associated with the withdrawal of growth factor signaling and may therefore contribute to the development of resistance."

Several mechanisms leading to such acquired resistance have been identified in patients with <i>EGFR</i>-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with small molecule EGFR inhibitors such as erlotinib. Following dramatic initial tumor shrinkage, tumor regrowth is most frequently associated with the emergence of a secondary genetic change, the T790M \u2018gatekeeper\u2019 mutation within the EGFR kinase domain, which restores ATP binding in the presence of drug (<a href=\"#bib32\">Pao et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Kobayashi et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Yun et al., 2007</a>). In other cases, amplification of related receptor tyrosine kinases (e.g., <i>MET</i>) or mutational activation of downstream kinases (e.g., <i>BRAF, PIK3CA</i>) may bypass the effect of EGFR inhibition (<a href=\"#bib13\">Engelman et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Sequist et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Ohashi et al., 2012</a>). Different drug resistance mechanisms may coexist within different metastatic lesions of individual patients. Recently, clinical trials involving rebiopsy of tumor lesions at the earliest sign of drug resistance have also revealed phenotypic conversions that may contribute to drug resistance, including activation of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and the remarkable trans-differentiation of lung cancers from adenocarcinoma to small cell histologies (<a href=\"#bib48\">Thomson et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Witta et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Sequist et al., 2011</a>). While some well-defined resistance mechanisms, such as the T790M-EGFR gatekeeper mutation and <i>MET</i> amplification, may be addressed using second line targeted drugs, the plasticity of cancer cell adaptation to disrupted oncogenic signaling poses a major challenge to the long-term success of these promising therapies."

By analogy with bacterial models of antibiotic resistance, such an intermediate state may be unstable, but enable treated cells to survive in the presence of drug long enough to acquire mutations that ultimately confer sustained drug resistance (<a href=\"#bib3\">Balaban et al., 2004</a>). In PC9 mutant, EGFR-addicted lung cancer cells, EGFR inhibition triggers apoptosis in the vast majority of cells in vitro, uncovering approximately 0.3% that are drug tolerant, quiescent, and expressing the stem cell marker CD133 and the histone H3K4 demethylase KDM5A (<a href=\"#bib42\">Sharma et al., 2010</a>). These drug tolerant cells readily revert to a drug-sensitive state following removal of the EGFR inhibitor, and their emergence in vitro is suppressed by treatment with an EGFR inhibitor combined with inhibitors of either histone deacetylases (HDACs) or the IGF-1 receptor. While this intermediate resistance mechanism remains to be validated in the clinical setting, it raises the possibility of suppressing pre-conditions that favor the acquisition of drug resistance, in order to circumvent the challenge of treating multiple established drug-resistant pathways."

For instance, acute loss of ERK signaling triggered by RAF or MEK inhibitors in <i>BRAF</i> mutant melanoma cells relieves ERK-dependent inhibition of RAS and CRAF, whose activation through ErbB receptor signaling may lead to paradoxical proliferative signals (<a href=\"#bib36\">Pratilas et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Paraiso et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Lito et al., 2012</a>).

The induction of SOX2 results from the activation of FOXO6, a forkhead family transcription factor, following EGFR inhibition. Knockdown or ectopic expression of SOX2 modulates the degree of apoptosis observed following oncogene withdrawal and promotes drug resistance, pointing to a novel homeostatic mechanism that may contribute to cellular adaptation to the withdrawal of growth factor signaling, which underlies most approaches to targeted cancer therapy."

Cell cultures were treated in triplicate with 1 \u00b5M erlotinib for 6 hr, followed by mRNA isolation and whole transcriptome analysis (Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 expression arrays) (<a href=\"#bibi39\">Rothenberg, 2015</a>)<i>.</i> A total of 35 genes showed &gt;fourfold change in expression (FDR &lt;0.05), including 22 downregulated and 13 upregulated transcripts (represented by 48 unique probe sets; <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Among induced transcripts, SOX2 was unique in the specificity and rapidity of its induction following EGFR inhibition (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Thus, SOX2 was strongly induced in three mutant EGFR-addicted lung cancer cell lines (HCC827, PC9, H3255) following treatment with physiologically relevant concentrations of erlotinib (0.1 \u00b5M), but not when these cells were treated with comparably effective doses of cytotoxic chemotherapy (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). SOX2 was also not induced in other oncogene-dependent models, such as <i>ALK</i>-translocated lung cancer cells treated with crizotinib, <i>HER2</i>-amplified breast cancer cells exposed to lapatinib or <i>BRAF</i>-mutant melanoma cells treated with AZD6244 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). Consistent with its dependence on suppression of mutant EGFR signaling in the context of EGFR \u2018addiction\u2019, SOX2 was not induced following erlotinib treatment of H1975 cells, which harbor both an EGFR activating mutation and the T790M gatekeeper mutation that confers resistant to erlotinib; or in H1650 cells with mutated EGFR that are relatively resistant to the effects of EGFR inhibition in part through genetic loss of <i>PTEN</i> (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib44\">Sos et al., 2009</a>). However, treatment of H1975 cells with the L858R/T790M mutation-selective inhibitor WZ4002 resulted in SOX2 induction (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>, right) (<a href=\"#bib57\">Zhou et al., 2009</a>). In cells that show erlotinib-mediated induction of SOX2, siRNA-mediated knockdown of EGFR also led to strong induction of SOX2 (in the absence of erlotinib), confirming the specificity of the drug effect (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Simultaneous treatment of cells with actinomycin D and erlotinib suppressed the induction of SOX2, consistent with a primary effect of EGFR inhibition in increasing SOX2 transcript levels (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>)."

In addition to SOX2, the 12 other transcripts induced by EGFR inhibition included genes encoding metabolizing enzymes (<i>CYP1B1, CYP1A1</i>) that are normally induced by treatment with a variety of small chemical entities, genes that we also found to be equally well induced by inhibition of downstream signaling pathways (MEK/MAPK inhibition using AZD6244 and PI3K/mTOR inhibition using BEZ235), one transcript (<i>CCNG2</i>) previously described in another EGFR model (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kobayashi et al., 2006</a>) and a long noncoding RNA (<i>NEAT1</i>).

Retreatment of cells after a period of recovery produced similar heterogeneity of SOX2+ cells as the initial treatment, pointing to the absence of enrichment for highly inducible cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4A</a>). In addition, SOX2 could still be induced in cells made resistant to erlotinib, but only at the much higher doses of drug required to fully inhibit EGFR in resistant cells (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4B</a>). Finally, cloning of 5\u20136 individual HCC827 and PC9 cells consistently generated mixed populations, including high level SOX2 inducers together with non-expressing cells, demonstrating that this heterogeneity is likely stochastic, rather than heritable (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s5\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). Thus, erlotinib treatment of <i>EGFR-</i>mutant cells results in transient and heterogeneous induction of SOX2, with a stochastic distribution, integrally tied to inhibition of EGFR, in which the cells with the highest expression have a low proliferative index."

The effectiveness of EGFR inhibitors in treating patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC is well modeled in mouse xenograft assays, where oral administration of erlotinib for a few days is sufficient to cause massive regression of established tumors. We generated PC9 cell-derived subcutaneous tumors in nude mice and treated these with a single oral dose of 100 mg/kg erlotinib when the tumors had reached approximately 500 mm<sup>3</sup>, harvesting tumors 24 hr after treatment. Immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis revealed minimal SOX2 expression in mock-treated xenografts (mean 0.2 SOX2+ nuclei per field), but clearly increased (and heterogeneous) SOX2 positive cells after a single dose of erlotinib (mean: 7.4 SOX2+ nuclei per field, N = 147\u2013151 fields, p &lt; 0.0001) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). Similar studies in HCC827 cell-derived xenografts revealed low (but detectable) levels of SOX2 expression in mock-treated tumors; again, a single oral dose of erlotinib increased both the number of SOX2-positive cells and the level of SOX2 expression per nucleus (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Thus, in a physiological setting that mimics the initial therapeutic response to EGFR inhibitors in <i>EGFR</i>-mutant NSCLC, treated cancer cells rapidly induce SOX2."

Such biopsies are typically obtained at the time of disease progression, where defining drug resistance mechanisms may shape further therapy. We therefore analyzed short-term cultures of EGFR-mutant cells derived by re-biopsy of two patients who had initially responded to erlotinib therapy but subsequently developed progressive disease due to the acquisition of a T790M gatekeeper mutation. SOX2 induction was absent following treatment with erlotinib, which was ineffective in inhibiting EGFR in these resistant patient-derived cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). However, the novel \u2018third line\u2019 irreversible, EGFR-mutant-specific inhibitor WZ4002 demonstrated potent EGFR inhibition in these cells, along with induction of SOX2 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Thus, SOX2 induction is consistently observed following acute withdrawal of EGFR signals in cancer models as well as in patient-derived cells that exhibit oncogene dependence on the EGFR pathway."

Source data are included as <a href=\"#SD10-data\">Figure 5\u2014source data 1</a>. (<b>B</b>) Left, HCC827 cells were stably transduced with a tetracycline-inducible SOX2 expression vector (without an epitope tag). Cells were treated with carrier (lanes 1\u20134) or 0.1 \u00b5g/ml doxycycline (lanes 5\u20138) for 3 hr prior to addition of 0.1 \u00b5M erlotinib, with doxycycline left in the cell culture media during erlotinib treatment to ensure strong induction of exogenous SOX2. Protein lysates were prepared at 3-hr intervals, and immunoblot analysis was carried out with the indicated antibodies. The increase in the intensity of the SOX2 band in lane 1\u20134 with time is due to induction of endogenous SOX2 by erlotinib; in lanes 5\u20138, strong induction of exogenous SOX2 with increasing time in doxycycline masks the endogenous protein. Right, the levels of each BIM isoform were quantitated using ImageJ software and normalized to GAPDH and time zero, confirming suppression of their induction by ectopic SOX2. (<b>C</b>) Physiologic levels of ectopic SOX2 decrease BIM induction by erlotinib. Cells were treated with erlotinib for 12 or 24 hr, \u2212/+ doxycycline to induce tagged SOX2, followed by immunoblot of lysates. Here, doxycycline was added for 3 hr and then removed prior to addition of erlotinib, to maintain ectopic SOX2 induction at physiologic levels during erlotinib treatment. Therefore, ectopic SOX2 is (slightly) apparent at time zero when erlotinib is added (lane 4), peaks 12 hr later (lane 5) and has decreased at 24 hr (lane 6). However, decreased BIM levels, together with decreased cleaved PARP/caspase-3 (lanes 5\u20136 vs 2\u20133), are apparent throughout. The use of a lower percentage acrylamide gel does not permit BIM L and S to be distinguished from BIM EL."

As expected, SOX2 knockdown alone had no significant toxicity, while erlotinib treatment led to massive cell death at 3 days (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>, left and middle images). At high magnification, many more individual surviving cells remained in control transfected cells than after transfection with siRNA targeting SOX2 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>, middle insets). With continued incubation in erlotinib, drug-resistant colonies emerged in control transfected cultures at higher frequency than in those treated with siRNA targeting SOX2 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>, right).

To search for additional targets that mediate SOX2's anti-apoptotic effect, we screened for altered expression of multiple pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic proteins in cells with overexpression of ectopic SOX2, following treatment with erlotinib. In both HCC827 and PC9 EGFR-mutant lung cancer cells, three of 14 BH3-domain containing proteins tested showed strongly reduced mRNA induction by erlotinib in the presence of ectopic SOX2: BIM, BMF, and HRK (but not PUMA) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). All three of these are known to induce apoptosis to different degrees, depending on the type of apoptotic stimulus. The effect of ectopic SOX2 on BIM protein levels was confirmed using two different expression strategies (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B,C</a>). Ectopic expression of SOX2, both at high and physiological levels, attenuated the erlotinib-induced induction of SOX2. In contrast, SOX2 knockdown coincident with erlotinib treatment led to an overall increase in BIM levels, although this effect was attenuated when averaged across a cell population with heterogeneous induction of endogenous SOX2 (<a href=\"#fig5s4\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 4</a>)."

Knockdown of FOXO6 using pooled siRNA constructs, but not the other FOXO proteins (individually or simultaneously), dramatically reduced erlotinib-mediated induction of SOX2 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B,C</a> and <a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). The effect of FOXO6 knockdown on SOX2 was evident using multiple individual siRNAs targeting FOXO6 in both HCC827 and PC9 cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>; effect on other FOXO isoforms is shown in <a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>). Although some individual siRNAs targeting FOXO6 had off target effects on other FOXOs, direct targeting of FOXOs 1, 3a, and 4 had no effect on SOX2 expression, further supporting the specificity of the FOXO6 effect (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). The effect of FOXO6 knockdown on SOX2 was not associated with any consistent effect on other aspects of EGFR signaling, although a moderate decrease in phospho-EGFR was observed in some experiments without significant differences in phospho-AKT or phospho-ERK (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>). Notably, FOXO6 expression was also heterogeneous and partially colocalized with SOX2 expression among populations of both untreated and treated cells (<a href=\"#fig7s3\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). FOXO6 differs from other FOXO proteins in that even the inactive protein is localized in the nucleus (<a href=\"#bib19\">Jacobs et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">van der Heide et al., 2005</a>). However, it shares the FOXO protein AKT-dependent inhibitory phosphorylation, whose suppression following repression of mutant EGFR signaling may in part explain the erlotinib-mediated FOXO6 activation."

The HCC2935 human lung cancer cell line is remarkable for harboring a characteristic oncogene-addicting EGFR mutation (exon 19 deletion) yet having unexplained resistance to erlotinib (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>), including absence of the common T790M gatekeeper mutation within EGFR and no amplification of the MET bypass signaling pathway (<a href=\"#bib56\">Zheng et al., 2011</a>). Notably, SOX2 expression at baseline is detectable in 90% of HCC2935 cells (compared to 3% of HCC827 and &lt;1% PC9 cells), and its expression per cell is further increased upon EGFR inhibition (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>). To test whether increased SOX2 contributes to decreased erlotinib sensitivity in HCC2935 cells, we knocked down SOX2 using siRNA. A striking increase in erlotinib cytotoxicity was evident following SOX2 suppression (IC50 0.8 \u00b5M for siCTRL cells with no further toxicity up to 10 \u00b5M, IC50 0.1 \u00b5M for siSOX2 cells), associated with higher levels of BIM and increased PARP and caspase-3 cleavage (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A,C</a>).

The best studied isoform, FOXO1, is highly expressed in ES cells and has been implicated in the maintenance of pluripotency through activation of SOX2 transcription (<a href=\"#bib55\">Zhang et al., 2011</a>). All FOXO proteins bind to similar DNA sequences, with isoform-specific activity presumably conferred by cellular and promoter context (<a href=\"#bib15\">Furuyama et al., 2000</a>). Indeed, all four FOXO isoforms are expressed in EGFR-mutant lung cancer cells, transcriptionally induced following EGFR inhibition and phosphorylated at homologous Serine residues, yet only FOXO6 regulates SOX2 in these cells. Given variability in knockdown efficacy (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>, column 6), we cannot exclude some contribution from the other FOXO family members on SOX2 expression, but FOXO6 has the dominant effect in the cells tested. Activation of FOXO6 may occur through both AKT dependent and independent pathways (<a href=\"#bib19\">Jacobs et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">van der Heide et al., 2005</a>), and indeed we observed that treatment with PI3K inhibitors alone is insufficient for induction of SOX2 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Other pathways that have been implicated in SOX2 regulation in the developing lung, including FGF10, WNT/beta-Catenin signaling, and TTF1 (<a href=\"#bib37\">Que et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Gontan et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Hashimoto et al., 2012</a>), had relatively modest effects on its induction following erlotinib treatment in EGFR-mutant cancer cells (<a href=\"#fig7s4\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 4</a>), pointing to FOXO6 as the dominant pathway in this model of oncogene-dependent signaling."

In contrast to the latter, BMF binds with significant affinity to a subset of BCL-2 family members (BCL-2, BCL-xL, and BCL-w) (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chen et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Kuwana et al., 2005</a>), yet it clearly contributes to the apoptotic response to erlotinib (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). The direct binding by SOX2 of the <i>BIM</i> and <i>BMF</i> genes is consistent with the ability of the four reprogramming factors (SOX2, OCT-4, KLF-4, and c-MYC) to bind to the promoters of several anti-apoptotic genes (including BMF) which are induced early during the reprogramming process (<a href=\"#bib21\">Kim et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Soufi et al., 2012</a>). Interestingly, control of SOX2 expression and its modulation of apoptosis may differ in EGFR-mutant lung cancer, compared with other forms of NSCLC. In a recent study of lung cancers with wild-type EGFR, the activation of EGFR upregulated SOX2, thereby decreasing apoptosis through BCL2L1, a phenomenon that was notably absent in EGFR-mutant lung cancers (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chou et al., 2013</a>). A similar pathway was reported in a prostate cancer cell line, also with wild-type EGFR (<a href=\"#bib40\">Rybak and Tang, 2013</a>). Thus, an EGFR-SOX2-BCL2L1 pathway may be implicated in cancer cells with wild-type EGFR, whereas the EGFR-FOXO6-SOX2-BIM/BMF pathway we describe is specific for cells that are dependent on mutant EGFR signals for their survival."

                                "text": "The heterogeneous induction of SOX2 within a clonally derived cell population could reflect the existence of an intrinsic subpopulation with heritable traits, as recently proposed in medulloblastoma and skin carcinoma (<a href=\"#bib6\">Boumahdi et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Vanner et al., 2014</a>). Alternatively, it could result from stochastic variation between cells in the activity of cellular signaling pathways. We favor the latter model, given the absent coexpression of SOX2 with putative stem cell markers, the failure to enrich for SOX2 positive cells following repeated erlotinib treatments, and the regeneration of heterogeneous SOX2 inducibility following single cell cloning experiments. A stochastic cell killing model for TRAIL-induced apoptosis of HeLa cells was recently described, in which naturally occurring cell-to-cell variation in the levels or activity of upstream signaling proteins leads to differential induction of mitochondrial membrane permeability and apoptosis only in some cells (<a href=\"#bib46\">Spencer et al., 2009</a>)."

In these respects, our observations are reminiscent of transient drug-tolerant persister cells (DTPs), also observed following erlotinib treatment (<a href=\"#bib42\">Sharma et al., 2010</a>). However, there are also significant differences between the mechanisms underlying DTPs and those observed here. DTPs emerge following longer erlotinib exposure at much higher concentrations, and they constitute a lower percentage of cells within the population. Their expression of the stem cell marker CD133 and the chromatin remodeling protein KDM5A was not reproduced by SOX2+ cells (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplements 2, 6</a>). Furthermore, DTPs are detectable in many cancer cell lines following treatment with multiple cytotoxic and targeted agents, whereas induction of SOX2 appears to be strictly limited to targeted EGFR inhibition in cells addicted to mutant EGFR signaling. SOX2 induction may thus be a specific and early signaling response to EGFR withdrawal, which contributes to increased cell survival, thus enhancing the likelihood of epigenetic events leading to DTPs and ultimately to stable genetic mechanisms of acquired drug resistance. Our results with HCC2935 cells (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>) further suggest that in a subset of cases, high basal SOX2 may even blunt the initial signaling response to EGFR inhibitors."

At the same time, feedback pathways that attenuate these signaling readouts may play a major role in enhancing the development of drug resistance. The EGFR-FOXO6-SOX2 signaling pathway regulating expression of the BIM and BMF apoptotic factors thus identifies a feedback loop that may attenuate the effectiveness of anti-EGFR therapy in cancer and contribute toward the ultimate development of drug resistance (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>). The contribution of key embryonic regulators such as SOX2 points to the conservation of critical developmental pathways in cancer cells, which modulate their response to the disruption of oncogenic signals."

Lentiviral expression constructs were cotransfected into 293T cells with the HIV-1 packaging construct pCMVdeltaR8.91 and the VSV-G envelope construct pMD.G using TransIT-LT-1 transfection reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Viral supernatants were collected at 48 and 72 hr post transfection in DMEM with 30% FCS, filtered through 0.45 \u03bcm syringe filters to remove cell debris and stored in aliquots at \u221280\u00b0C. Transductions were carried out in the presence of 8 \u03bcg/ml Polybrene (Sigma) by spinoculation at 1200\u00d7<i>g</i> and at 32\u00b0C for 60 min in a Sorvall Legend RT table-top centrifuge. Viral supernatant was exchanged for fresh media 24 hr after spinoculation. To generate stable cDNA expressing cell lines, cells were selected in G418. Tetracycline-reduced FBS (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) was substituted for all media for cells transduced with the pInducer 20 vectors. To induce expression of SOX2 or WNT pathway constructs, doxycycline (Sigma) at 0.1 \u00b5g/ml was added to all cultures at least 3 hr prior to addition of erlotinib."

Briefly, Rediject D-Luciferin Ultra (Perkin Elmer) was added in 0.2 ml fresh media (1\u2013200 dilution) to each well of cells in a 96-well plate and incubated for 15 min at 37\u00b0C. Luciferase activity was imaged with the IVIS Lumina II In Vivo Imaging System (Perkin Elmer). The radiance of each well was determined using Living Image 4.2 software (Perkin Elmer), background corrected by subtracting the mean signal from empty wells and normalized both to the relative cell number of each well as determined by Syto60 assay and the resulting normalized mean value of untreated wells."

The mechanisms that cause drug resistance need to be understood if we are to improve the efficacy of cancer treatment. This study, which seeks to understand resistance to EGFR-targeted therapy, is therefore significant. The authors explored gene expression changes induced by erlotinib that might contribute to the development of resistance. The authors report that a FOXO6 - Sox2 pathway represses expression of the pro-apoptotic proteins BIM and BMF to in a sub-set of cells confer survival. The authors propose that this survival pathway provides the tumor cells with the opportunity to accumulate mutations that drive drug resistance. This conclusion, which is not tested, is interesting and potentially important for the design of cancer therapies."

Instead, SOX2 expression returns to basal levels in the absence of drug, and re-treatment re-induces SOX2 to similar levels and with similar cell distribution as with the prior treatment. These data are consistent with a stochastic model of SOX2 induction. As noted by the reviewer, a similar stochastic cell killing model was described in Spencer et al, Nature, 2009 with respect to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. However, this in no way suggests absence of clinical significance, since (as shown in Point #1 above), the transient expression of SOX2 itself enhances the subsequent emergence of stably resistant colonies.

All of these complex mechanisms are noted in patients after prolonged treatment with erlotinib, but only few of these are well recapitulated using the standard cell line models, which tend to favor the gatekeeper mutation mechanism (even MET amplification is very rare in vitro).

Two different siRNA duplexes (-01 and -02) are uniquely targeting FOXO6, without effect on other FOXO family members.

Note in the new figure that with 24 hours of erlotinib treatment, FOXO6 is induced by erlotinib to a much greater degree than the other FOXOs in both HCC827 and PC9 cells, hence these off-target effects are less impressive than the on-target effect on FOXO6.
