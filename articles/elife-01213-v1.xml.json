Sensing of pH has been proposed as a sufficient proxy for determination of PCO<sub>2</sub> and direct CO<sub>2</sub>-sensing largely discounted. Here we show that connexin 26 (Cx26) hemichannels, causally linked to respiratory chemosensitivity, are directly modulated by CO<sub>2</sub>. A \u2018carbamylation motif\u2019, present in CO<sub>2</sub>-sensitive connexins (Cx26, Cx30, Cx32) but absent from a CO<sub>2</sub>-insensitive connexin (Cx31), comprises Lys125 and four further amino acids that orient Lys125 towards Arg104 of the adjacent subunit of the connexin hexamer. Introducing the carbamylation motif into Cx31 created a mutant hemichannel (mCx31) that was opened by increases in PCO<sub>2</sub>. Mutation of the carbamylation motif in Cx26 and mCx31 destroyed CO<sub>2</sub> sensitivity. Course-grained computational modelling of Cx26 demonstrated that the proposed carbamate bridge between Lys125 and Arg104 biases the hemichannel to the open state. Carbamylation of Cx26 introduces a new transduction principle for physiological sensing of CO<sub>2</sub>."

Sensing of pH has been proposed as a sufficient proxy for determination of PCO<sub>2</sub> and direct CO<sub>2</sub>-sensing largely discounted. Here we show that connexin 26 (Cx26) hemichannels, causally linked to respiratory chemosensitivity, are directly modulated by CO<sub>2</sub>. A \u2018carbamylation motif\u2019, present in CO<sub>2</sub>-sensitive connexins (Cx26, Cx30, Cx32) but absent from a CO<sub>2</sub>-insensitive connexin (Cx31), comprises Lys125 and four further amino acids that orient Lys125 towards Arg104 of the adjacent subunit of the connexin hexamer. Introducing the carbamylation motif into Cx31 created a mutant hemichannel (mCx31) that was opened by increases in PCO<sub>2</sub>. Mutation of the carbamylation motif in Cx26 and mCx31 destroyed CO<sub>2</sub> sensitivity. Course-grained computational modelling of Cx26 demonstrated that the proposed carbamate bridge between Lys125 and Arg104 biases the hemichannel to the open state. Carbamylation of Cx26 introduces a new transduction principle for physiological sensing of CO<sub>2</sub>."

The concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> is related to pH because CO<sub>2</sub> reacts with water to form carbonic acid, which quickly breaks down to form hydrogen ions and bicarbonate ions. This close relationship has led many researchers to equate pH-sensing with CO<sub>2</sub>-sensing, and to suggest that a physiological receptor for CO<sub>2</sub> does not exist."

Researchers found that when pH levels were held constant, increasing the level of CO<sub>2</sub> caused the structures to open up, suggesting that CO<sub>2</sub> could be directly detected by the hemichannels. Each hemichannel contains six connexin subunits, but the details of how the CO<sub>2</sub> molecules interact with the individual connexin subunits to open up the hemichannels remained mysterious."

This group then interacts with the amino acid (arginine) at residue 104 in a neighbouring connexin subunit to form a carbamate bridge between the two subunits. This leads to structural changes that cause the gap junction hemichannels to open and release signals that can activate other cells. Since connexin hemichannels are found throughout the human body, these results suggest that CO<sub>2</sub> might act as a signalling molecule in processes as diverse as the control of blood flow, breathing, hearing and reproduction."

Humans produce approximately 20 moles of CO<sub>2</sub> per day (<a href=\"#bib16\">Marshall and Bangert, 2008</a>). The dissolved CO<sub>2</sub> can readily combine with water, aided by carbonic anhydrase, to form H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, which dissociates rapidly to H<sup>+</sup> and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>\u2212</sup>. In any physiological solution therefore, the partial pressure of CO<sub>2</sub> (PCO<sub>2</sub>) will be in equilibrium with, and inescapably related to, the pH and the concentration of HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>\u2212</sup> of that solution.

The field of respiratory chemosensitivity has been dominated by \u2018reaction theory\u2019 which posits that pH is a sufficient signal for detection of changes in PCO<sub>2</sub> (<a href=\"#bib13\">Loeschcke, 1982</a>). Many investigators therefore equate pH-sensing with CO<sub>2</sub>-sensing. There are several areas of the medulla oblongata which contain neurons that respond to changes in pH/CO<sub>2</sub>, especially near the highly vascularised ventral surface. For example a population of neurons highly sensitive to pH/CO<sub>2</sub> have been described in the retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN) (<a href=\"#bib19\">Mulkey et al., 2004</a>, <a href=\"#bib18\">2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Guyenet et al., 2008</a>) and the medullary raph\u00e9 nucleus (<a href=\"#bib21\">Richerson, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Ray et al., 2011</a>). Despite the acceptance of pH-sensing as the predominant mechanism by which PCO<sub>2</sub> is measured, there is substantial evidence for an additional and independent effect of molecular CO<sub>2</sub> (<a href=\"#bib4\">Eldridge et al., 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Shams, 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Huckstepp and Dale, 2011</a>). For example, if pH is carefully controlled at the medullary surface, an increase in PCO<sub>2</sub> at constant pH will still enhance breathing by as much as a pH change at constant PCO<sub>2</sub> (<a href=\"#bib24\">Shams, 1985</a>). We have recently shown that connexin 26 (Cx26) hemichannels, open in response to increases in PCO<sub>2</sub> at constant extracellular pH and are an important conduit for the CO<sub>2</sub>-dependent, as opposed to pH-dependent, release of ATP (<a href=\"#bib10\">Huckstepp et al., 2010a</a>). Cx26 hemichannels contribute to the chemosensory control of breathing (<a href=\"#bib11\">Huckstepp et al., 2010b</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Wenker et al., 2012</a>). Hemichannels of two closely related connexins, Cx30 and Cx32, also exhibited CO<sub>2</sub>-sensitive opening (<a href=\"#bib10\">Huckstepp et al., 2010a</a>). Despite this evidence, widespread acceptance of direct sensing of CO<sub>2</sub> requires a detailed molecular explanation of any putative transduction system."

Here we document an important new advance\u2014the mechanism by which CO<sub>2</sub> binds directly to Cx26, most probably via carbamylation of a lysine residue, to cause hemichannel opening. Our work establishes a new field of direct CO<sub>2</sub> sensing that can be mediated by CO<sub>2</sub>-dependent carbamylation of certain \u03b2 connexins. As these are widely distributed in the brain and other tissues, it is likely that direct detection of CO<sub>2</sub> via this mechanism is important in many different physiological processes."

We expressed, in HeLa cells, either rat Cx31 or rat Cx26 tagged at the C-terminal with mCherry and used a previously described dye loading assay (<a href=\"#bib10\">Huckstepp et al., 2010a</a>) to test whether the cells could load with carboxyfluorescein (CBF) in a CO<sub>2</sub>-dependent manner.

However, HeLa cells expressing Cx31 failed to dye load in a CO<sub>2</sub>-dependent manner (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>). As the connexins were tagged with mCherry, we could verify the presence of fluorescent puncta in both the Cx26 and Cx31 expressing HeLa cells (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). To check for the existence of functional hemichannels in the Cx31-expressing HeLa cells, we removed extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> as a positive control.

We hypothesized that CO<sub>2</sub> carbamylated a lysine residue in Cx26 to induce conformational change and hence opening of the hemichannel. We therefore compared the sequences of the three CO<sub>2</sub>-sensitive connexins to Cx31 to identify a lysine present in all three CO<sub>2</sub> sensitive connexins but absent from Cx31 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). This analysis revealed K125 and four further amino acids as forming a motif that was absent from Cx31. The existing crystal structure for Cx26 (<a href=\"#bib15\">Maeda et al., 2009</a>), shows that K125 is at the end of an alpha helix and that the sequence KVREI (\u2018carbamylation motif\u2019) orients K125 towards R104 on the neighbouring subunit (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>).

Course-grained modelling reduces protein atomistic complexity for more efficient computational studies of harmonic protein dynamics and is particularly suited to examining hemichannel opening over millisecond time scales (<a href=\"#bib25\">Sherwood et al., 2008</a>). We therefore built coarse-grained elastic network models (ENM) to gain insight into the mechanism by which CO<sub>2</sub> maintains Cx26 in the open state. In an ENM the C\u03b1-atom co-ordinates of an atomic resolution structure are used to represent a protein structure. The total global protein motion within the ENM consists of a defined number of modes, each of a characteristic frequency and representing a particular harmonic motion within the protein. ENMs are known to reproduce the global low frequency modes of protein motion well in comparison to experimental data (<a href=\"#bib3\">Delarue and Sanejouand, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Valadie et al., 2003</a>). We used the co-ordinates from a high-resolution crystal structure to construct an ENM (<a href=\"#bib28\">Tirion, 1996</a>) for the Cx26 hexamer in the unbound and CO<sub>2</sub>-bound states. CO<sub>2</sub> was represented in the ENM by the inclusion of six additional Hookean springs between residues K125 and R104 of neighbouring monomers (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>)."

Addition of springs representing CO<sub>2</sub>-binding to the ENM restricted the closing motions of the hemichannel and thus connexin 26 was maintained in the open state (<a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). We examined the overlap in the ordering of the modes in the unbound and CO<sub>2</sub> bound states to gain insight into how this occurs. A significant reordering of the lowest frequency modes to higher frequencies was observed in the presence of CO<sub>2</sub> rather than the removal of any modes from the total protein motion (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Mode 1, the lowest frequency mode that represents the opening/closing mode, represented about 40% of the total protein motion in the absence of CO<sub>2</sub>. In the presence of CO<sub>2</sub> this closing mode is reordered through a change in its frequency as mode 9, which accounts for only about 2% of the total motion (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B,C</a>). CO<sub>2</sub> therefore opens Cx26 through a reordering of the normal modes of global protein motion such that the normal closing motion of Cx26 no longer significantly contributes to the total motion of the hemichannel. We infer from this that the carbamate bridge formed between Cx26 monomers represents a constraining force that hinders hemichannel closure."

Firstly, we demonstrated the sufficiency of the carbamylation motif to confer CO<sub>2</sub> sensitivity by inserting it into a CO<sub>2</sub>-insensitive connexin, Cx31. Secondly, we showed that K125 of the carbamylation motif was essential for this motif to confer CO<sub>2</sub> sensitivity on Cx31. Thirdly and fourthly, we demonstrated that the mutations K125R and R104A in Cx26 (to prevent carbamate bridging at either end of the bridge) destroyed the CO<sub>2</sub> sensitivity of this connexin. Fifthly, by exploiting glutamate as an analogue of the carbamylated K125 (in Cx26<sup>K125E</sup>), we demonstrated a gain of function\u2014Cx26<sup>K125E</sup> was constitutively open, yet had lost sensitivity to CO<sub>2</sub>. Finally, we further tested the bridging concept by demonstrating that the bridge is in effect bidirectional: the mutated hemichannel Cx26<sup>R104E</sup>, in which E104 can bridge to K125 in the reverse direction, was also constitutively open, but had no sensitivity to CO<sub>2</sub>."

This interaction is most probably via carbamylation of K125. Interestingly, the mutations Cx26<sup>K125E</sup> and Cx26<sup>K125R</sup> can be considered respectively as open-state and closed-state analogues of the wild type channel. Collectively, our data strongly suggests that CO<sub>2</sub> binds to the intracellular surface of Cx26 and must therefore cross the membrane to reach this site. This could occur either direct diffusion through the membrane bilayer, potentially via Cx26 itself, or via other CO<sub>2</sub> permeable channels (<a href=\"#bib1\">Boron et al., 2011</a>). Amongst its many other functions, Cx26 can therefore be regarded as a receptor for CO<sub>2</sub>. Interestingly, this mechanism of modulation applies to both Cx30 and Cx32, which can both potentially form a carbamate bridge at equivalent residues to Cx26. In the case of Cx32 this would involve bridging to K104 rather than R104 (in Cx26 and 30). Cx26 can co-assemble with both Cx30 and Cx32 to form heteromeric hemichannels (<a href=\"#bib6\">Forge et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Yum et al., 2007</a>). Our structural studies predict that, as Cx30 and Cx32 have K125 and either R104 or K104, carbamate bridges could form in such heteromeric hemichannels and that they should also therefore be CO<sub>2</sub>-sensitive."

It establishes a CO<sub>2</sub>-dependent signalling paradigm in which the concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> is signalled by ATP release via Cx26 from the chemosensory cell and consequent activation of neighbouring cells, or potentially by a Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through the Cx26 hemichannel (<a href=\"#bib5\">Fiori et al., 2012</a>) to initiate a Ca<sup>2+</sup> wave within the chemosensory cell itself and further Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent signalling processes."

Cells were grown in a humidified 5% CO<sub>2</sub> incubator at 37\u00b0C. The connexin proteins were expressed via transient transfection. Cells were plated in six-well plates at 1 \u00d7 10<sup>5</sup> cells per well for Cx26 and its mutants and 5 \u00d7 10<sup>4</sup> cells per well for Cx31 and its mutants. Following the GeneJuice transfection reagent (Merck-Millipore UK, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) user protocol, cells were transfected with 1 \u00b5g of the appropriate DNA. Experiments were performed when the connexin proteins had reached the cell membrane. This was found to be approximately 2 days for Cx26 and its mutants and approximately 3 days for Cx31 and its mutants."

As an alternative approach, it struck us that we could provide further support for the idea of the bridge between K125 and R104 simply by reversing the direction of the bridge. The mutation R104E provides the required carboxy functionality from residue 104 and it should, on the basis of our hypothesis, be able to form a salt bridge in the reverse direction with K125 and thus also give a constitutively open hemichannel.
