Here, we have mapped with electron microscopy the complete wiring diagram of the <i>Drosophila</i> larval antennal lobe, an olfactory neuropil similar to the vertebrate olfactory bulb. We found a canonical circuit with uniglomerular projection neurons (uPNs) relaying gain-controlled ORN activity to the mushroom body and the lateral horn. A second, parallel circuit with multiglomerular projection neurons (mPNs) and hierarchically connected local neurons (LNs) selectively integrates multiple ORN signals already at the first synapse. LN-LN synaptic connections putatively implement a bistable gain control mechanism that either computes odor saliency through panglomerular inhibition, or allows some glomeruli to respond to faint aversive odors in the presence of strong appetitive odors. This complete wiring diagram will support experimental and theoretical studies towards bridging the gap between circuits and behavior."

Here, we have mapped with electron microscopy the complete wiring diagram of the <i>Drosophila</i> larval antennal lobe, an olfactory neuropil similar to the vertebrate olfactory bulb. We found a canonical circuit with uniglomerular projection neurons (uPNs) relaying gain-controlled ORN activity to the mushroom body and the lateral horn. A second, parallel circuit with multiglomerular projection neurons (mPNs) and hierarchically connected local neurons (LNs) selectively integrates multiple ORN signals already at the first synapse. LN-LN synaptic connections putatively implement a bistable gain control mechanism that either computes odor saliency through panglomerular inhibition, or allows some glomeruli to respond to faint aversive odors in the presence of strong appetitive odors. This complete wiring diagram will support experimental and theoretical studies towards bridging the gap between circuits and behavior."

The olfactory sensory cells communicate with a region of the brain called the olfactory bulb. Olfactory sensory cells of the same type converge onto the same small pocket of the olfactory bulb, forming a structure called a glomerulus. Similarly to how the retina generates an image, the combined activity of multiple glomeruli defines an odor."

In the nervous system, odorants are detected by olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) whose axons organize centrally into glomeruli by olfactory receptor type (<a href=\"#bib75\">Wang et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Vosshall et al., 2000</a>). Uni- and multi-glomerular projection neurons (PNs) relay olfactory inputs to higher-order brain areas (<a href=\"#bib69\">Stocker et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Liang et al., 2013</a>). Common between mammals and insects (<a href=\"#bib73\">Vosshall and Stocker, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Su et al., 2009</a>), PNs target two major brain centers, one associated with learning and memory (such as the mushroom bodies (MB) in insects), and another that mediates some innate behaviors (such as the lateral horn (LH) in insects) (<a href=\"#bib16\">Fischbach and Heisenberg, 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Heisenberg et al., 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Stocker et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Sosulski et al., 2011</a>). Local neurons (LNs) mediate communication between glomeruli, implementing computations such as gain control (<a href=\"#bib52\">Olsen and Wilson, 2008</a>). While the connectivity of a few glomeruli has been recently partially reconstructed in the adult fly (<a href=\"#bib60\">Rybak et al., 2016</a>), the complete number and morphology of cell types and the circuit structure with synaptic resolution is not known for any glomerular olfactory system."

In this tractable system, each glomerulus is defined by a single, uniquely identifiable ORN (<a href=\"#bib17\">Fishilevich et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Masuda-Nakagawa et al., 2009</a>), and almost all neurons throughout the nervous system are expected to be uniquely identifiable and stereotyped (<a href=\"#bib39\">Manning et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Vogelstein et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Li et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Ohyama et al., 2015</a>). Some of the olfactory LNs and PNs have already been identified (<a href=\"#bib40\">Masuda-Nakagawa et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Thum et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Das et al., 2013</a>). This minimal glomerular olfactory system exhibits the general capabilities of the more numerically complex systems. For example, as in other organisms (<a href=\"#bib19\">Friedrich and Korsching, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Nagayama et al., 2004</a>) and in the adult fly (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bhandawat et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Nagel and Wilson, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Kim et al., 2015</a>), the output of the uniglomerular PNs tracks the ORN response (<a href=\"#bib2\">Asahina et al., 2009</a>), which represents both the first derivative of the odorant concentration and the time course of the odorant concentration itself (<a href=\"#bib65\">Schulze et al., 2015</a>). Like in the adult fly (<a href=\"#bib52\">Olsen and Wilson, 2008</a>) and zebrafish (<a href=\"#bib79\">Zhu et al., 2013</a>), gain control permits the larval olfactory system to operate over a wide range of odorant concentrations (<a href=\"#bib2\">Asahina et al., 2009</a>). The olfactory behaviors exhibited by the larva have been well studied (mostly in 2nd and 3rd instar larvae), in particular chemotaxis (<a href=\"#bib8\">Cobb, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Bellmann et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Gomez-Marin et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Gershow et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Schulze et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Gepner et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Hernandez-Nunez et al., 2015</a>), as well as the odor tuning and physiological responses of ORNs (<a href=\"#bib17\">Fishilevich et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Louis et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Asahina et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Kreher et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Montague et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Mathew et al., 2013</a>). Additionally the larva presents odor associative learning (<a href=\"#bib22\">Gerber and Stocker, 2007</a>). Obtaining the wiring diagram of all neurons synaptically connected to the ORNs would enable the formulation of system-level hypotheses of olfactory circuit function to explain the observed behavioral and functional properties. The reduced numerical complexity and dimensions of the larval olfactory system, the similarity of its organization and capabilities to other organisms, and the tractability of the larva as a transparent genetic model organism, make it an ideal model system in which to study the complete circuit architecture of a glomerularly organized olfactory processing center."

The ORN cell bodies are housed in the dorsal organ ganglion, extend dendrites into the dome of the dorsal organ, and emit axons to the brain via the antennal nerve. Like in all insects, neuron cell bodies (circles) reside in the outer layer of the nervous system (grey), and project their arbors into the neuropil (white) where they form synapses. Also shown are the major classes of local neurons (Broad LNs, Picky LNs and Keystone) and the 2 classes of projection neurons (uPNs and mPNs). The arbors of the Broad LNs (black) specifically innervate the AL. LNs and mPN dendrites can extend into the subesophageal zone (SEZ), innervated by sensory neurons of other modalities. uPNs project to specific brain areas (mushroom body calyx and lateral horn; LH), and mPNs mostly project to other nearby brain areas. (<b>b</b>) The larva presents 21 unique olfactory glomeruli, each defined by a single ORN expressing a single or a unique pair of olfactory receptors. We reconstructed each ORN with a skeleton and annotated its synapses, here colored like the skeleton to better illustrate each glomerulus. See <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a> for individual renderings that aided in the identification of each unique ORN. (<b>c</b>) Summary connectivity table for the right antennal lobe with all major neuron classes (4 neuromodulatory neurons and the descending neuron from the brain were omitted), indicating the percent of postsynaptic sites of a column neuron contributed by a row neuron. For most neurons, the vast majority of their inputs originates in other neurons within the antennal lobe. In parentheses, the number of neurons that belong to each cell type. We show only connections with at least two synapses, consistently found among homologous identified neurons in both the left and right antennal lobes. Percentages between 0 and 0.5 are rounded down to 0. (<b>d</b>) Schematic of the innervation patterns of the main classes of LNs and PNs in the antennal lobe. White ovals represent the glomeruli. Solid circles are cell bodies. Shaded areas with dotted outlines represent the extent of the PN dendritic arbors, with each uPN (green) innervating one glomerulus and each mPN (blue) innervating multiple glomeruli. Their axons (arrows) project to the brain. Broad LNs (black) are axonless and present panglomerular arbors. Picky LN (orange) dendrites span multiple glomeruli and their axons (arrow; not shown) target a different yet overlapping set of glomeruli as well as regions outside the olfactory system. Choosy LNs are similar to the Picky LNs but their axons remain within the antennal lobe. (<b>e</b>) A simplified wiring diagram of the larval olfactory system with only the main connections. ORNs are excitatory. All shown LNs are inhibitory. Broad LNs reciprocally connect to all glomeruli and each other and thus engage in presynaptic inhibition (on ORNs) and postsynaptic inhibition (on uPNs). Picky LNs form a hierarchical circuit and selectively synapse onto mPNs. Another LN, Keystone, receives inputs from ORNs, one Picky LN and non-ORN sensory neurons, and can potentially alter the operational mode of the entire olfactory system by altering the pattern of inhibition (see text)."

Per side, we found 21 uniglomerular PNs (uPNs; one per glomerulus), 14 LNs, 14 multiglomerular PNs (mPNs), 4 neuromodulatory neurons, 6 subesophageal zone (SEZ) interneurons and 1 descending neuron (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1c,d</a>). These identified neurons present stereotyped connectivity when comparing the left and right antennal lobes. The lack of undifferentiated neurons in the 1st instar antennal lobe, and comparisons with light-microscopy images of other instars suggests that the 1st instar antennal lobe contains all the neurons present throughout larval life. Here, we analyze this complete wiring diagram on the basis of the known function of circuit motifs in the adult fly and other organisms and known physiological properties and behavioral roles of identified larval neurons. We found two distinct circuit architectures structured around the two types of PNs: a uniglomerular system where each glomerulus participates in a repeated, canonical circuit, centered on its uPN (<a href=\"#bib55\">Python and Stocker, 2002</a>); and a multiglomerular system where all glomeruli are embedded in structured, hetereogeneous circuits read out by mPNs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1e</a>; [<a href=\"#bib11\">Das et al., 2013</a>]). We also found that the inhibitory LNs structure a circuit that putatively implements a bistable inhibitory system. One state could compute odor saliency through panglomerular lateral inhibition, that is, by suppressing the less active glomeruli in favor of the more active ones. The other may enable select glomeruli, specialized for aversive odors, to respond to faint stimuli in a background of high, appetitive odor stimuli. We discuss the role of these two possible operational states and how neuromodulatory neurons and brain feedback neurons participate in the interglomerular circuits."

Notice that the 35a uPN is bilateral, ascends through a different tract, and receives additional inputs outside of the antennal lobe. The 33a uPN does not synapse within the calyx and the 82a uPN does not continue to the lateral horn. The left antennal lobe (not shown) is a mirror image of the right one. (<b>b</b>) Dorsal view of the EM-reconstructed, axonless Broad LNs (Duet in orange; Trio in blue) shown together and individually. All neurons are on the same lineage: BAlc (<a href=\"#bib11\">Das et al., 2013</a>). The pre-(red) and post-(cyan) synaptic sites on these panglomerular neurons are fairly uniformly distributed. ORNs in grey for reference. These neurons extend posteriorly out of the olfactory glomeruli to receive synapses from 2 non-ORN sensory neurons that enter the brain via the antennal nerve. (<b>c</b>) Percentage of the total number of postsynaptic sites on the dendrite of an uPN, Broad LN or Choosy LN (columns) that originate in a given ORN or LN (rows) for the right antennal lobe. Since the 35a uPN is bilateral, we include inputs to it from both antennal lobes. We show only connections with at least two synapses, consistently found among homologous identified neurons in both the left and right antennal lobes. Percentages between 0 and 1 are rounded to 1, but totals are computed from raw numbers. The uniglomerular nature of uPNs (notice the green diagonal) and panglomerular nature of Broad LNs is evident. The Broad LN Duet generally contributes more synapses onto uPNs than the Broad LN Trio does. While the number of synapses that an ORN makes onto its uPN varies widely (24\u2013120 synapses; see <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a> and <a href=\"#SD2-data\">2</a>), this number is tailored to the size of the target uPN dendrite given that percentage of inputs the ORN contributes to the uPN is much less varied (mostly 45\u201365%). For an extended version of this table that includes all LNs, see <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>. (<b>d</b>) Both Broad LN types (Trio and Duet) mediate presynaptic inhibition (synapses onto ORN axons) similarly, but the Duet shows far stronger postsynaptic inhibition (synapses onto uPN dendrites) while the Trio receives far more dendro-dendritic synapses from uPNs.

These 5 Broad LNs also account for most inputs onto the ORN axons (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1c</a>), therefore being prime candidates for mediating both intra- and interglomerular presynaptic inhibition (onto ORNs) as observed in the adult fly with morphologically equivalent cells (<a href=\"#bib76\">Wilson and Laurent, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Olsen and Wilson, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Olsen et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Chou et al., 2010</a>), and in the larva (<a href=\"#bib2\">Asahina et al., 2009</a>)."

While both types provide panglomerular presynaptic inhibition (onto ORN axons), the Duet makes far more synapses onto the dendrites of the uPNs. This may indicate a far stronger role for the Broad LN Duet in postsynaptic inhibition (onto uPN dendrites; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3d</a>). In the adult fly, presynaptic inhibition implements gain control (<a href=\"#bib52\">Olsen and Wilson, 2008</a>), and postsynaptic inhibition plays a role in uPNs responding to the change in ORN activity (<a href=\"#bib45\">Nagel et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Kim et al., 2015</a>). The two types of glomerular inhibition are provided by two separate cell types, and may therefore be modulated independently. For example, the uPNs emit dendritic outputs that primarily target the Broad LN Trio (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3d</a>), indicating that the output of the glomerulus contributes more to presynaptic than to postsynaptic inhibition. Similar excitatory synapses from uPNs to inhibitory LNs have been shown in vertebrates (<a href=\"#bib56\">Rall et al., 1966</a>), and synapses from PNs to LNs and vice versa have been described in the adult fly (<a href=\"#bib60\">Rybak et al., 2016</a>)."

Therefore Broad LNs may be defining a specific dynamic range for the entire antennal lobe, enabling the system to remain responsive to changes in odorant intensities within a wide range. Importantly, Broad LNs also synapse onto each other (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3c,e</a>) like in the adult (<a href=\"#bib49\">Okada et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Rybak et al., 2016</a>). Furthermore, the two types of Broad LNs have a different ratio of excitation and inhibition, originating in the preference of Trio to synapse far more often onto each other than onto Duet (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3e</a>, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>).

Unlike the Broad LNs, Choosy LNs have a clear axon innervating most glomeruli, while their dendrites collect inputs from only a small subset of glomeruli (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3c</a>; <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>; <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Therefore some glomeruli can drive postsynaptic inhibition of most glomeruli. Additionally, the inputs from Choosy LNs tend to be more proximal to the axon initial segment of the uPNs (<a href=\"#bib25\">Gouwens and Wilson, 2009</a>) unlike those of Broad LNs which are more uniformly distributed throughout the uPN dendritic arbor (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). In the adult, ORNs tend to synapse at the most distal PN dendritic terminals, allowing for some LN inhibition to occur via synapses more proximal to the axon initial segment (<a href=\"#bib60\">Rybak et al., 2016</a>).

Most mPNs (green) project via the same tract as the uPNs (mALT). They can project via other tracts (other colors), but never via the mlALT used by the iPNs of the adult <i>Drosophila</i>. The mPNs project to many regions including a pre-calyx area, a post-calyx area, the lateral horn (LH) and the mushroom body vertical lobe (MB vl). mPNs are generated by diverse neuroblast lineages including BAlp4, BAla1, and others (<a href=\"#bib11\">Das et al., 2013</a>). (<b>b</b>) Dorsal view of the EM-reconstructed Picky LNs shown together and individually. When shown individually, the Picky LNs are in 2 colors: blue for the dendrites and soma, and green for the axon. Zoom in to observe that presynaptic sites (red) are predominantly on the axon, whereas postsynaptic sites (cyan) are mostly on dendrites. Collectively, the dendritic arbors of the 5 Picky LNs tile the olfactory glomeruli. The dendrites of the Picky LN 3 and 4 extend significantly into the SEZ. They all originate from the same neuroblast lineage: BAla2 (<a href=\"#bib11\">Das et al., 2013</a>). (<b>c</b>) Percentage of the total number of postsynaptic sites on the dendrite of a mPN or Picky LN (column neuron) that originate from a given glomerulus or Picky LN (row neurons). Here we define the glomerulus as connections from the ORN or via dendro-dendritic synapses from a given ORN\u2019s uPN. This is most relevant for mPN A1, which can receive more synapses from an ORN\u2019s uPN than the ORN itself (see suppl. Adjacency Matrix). We show the inputs to the mPNs and Picky LNs for the right antennal lobe, but for all bilateral mPNs (bil.-lower, bil.-upper, and VUM) we include inputs from both sides. We show only connections with at least two synapses, consistently found among homologous identified neurons in both the left and right antennal lobes. Percentages between 0 and 1 are rounded to 1, but totals are computed from raw numbers. Connections in this table are stereotyped (when comparing the left and right antennal lobes) and selective. Note that mPNs that receive many inputs from non-ORN sensory neurons in the SEZ have a low total of ORN+uPN input. For an extended version of this table that includes all LNs see <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>. (<b>d</b>) The direct upstream connectivity for two mPNs, with ORNs colored by the groups emerging from the PCA analysis of odor tuning. Connections from ORNs and Picky LNs to mPNs create 3 different types of motifs: <i>direct</i> excitatory connections from ORNs, <i>lateral</i> inhibitory connections from ORNs only via Picky LNs, and <i>feedforward loops</i> where an ORN connects both directly to the mPN and laterally through a Picky LN. Note that the activity of Picky LN 0 could alter the integration function for mPN A3 and indirectly for B2, as well as many other mPNs (not shown). Arrow thicknesses are weighted by the square root of the number of synapses between neurons. (<b>e</b>) The Picky LN hierarchy, dominated by Picky LN 0, here showing connections with 2 or more consistent synapses between bilaterally homologous neurons. Some of these connections are axo-axonic (see <a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>)."

Only consistent connections between ORNs and Picky dendrites or ORNs and Picky axons with a threshold of at least 2 consistent synapses per side are used to calculate these ratios.

While both Choosy LNs and Picky LNs are oligoglomerular and present distinct axons, the Choosy LNs are GABAergic whereas at least 4 of the 5 Picky LNs are instead glutamatergic (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a> for Picky LNs and <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> panels L-O in (<a href=\"#bib71\">Thum et al., 2011</a>) for Choosy LNs; see also Supp. Fig. 2 of <a href=\"#bib11\">Das et al. [2013]</a>). The difference in neurotransmitter is consistent with Picky LNs deriving from a different lineage than Choosy LNs (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). In addition, the two Choosy LNs present indistinguishable connectivity, whereas each Picky LN has its own preferred synaptic partners (see <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a> and <a href=\"#SD2-data\">2</a>). Additionally, unlike the Choosy LNs, Picky LNs rarely target uPNs (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Glutamate has been shown to act as a postsynaptic inhibitory neurotransmitter in the adult fly antennal lobe for both PNs and LNs (<a href=\"#bib36\">Liu and Wilson, 2013</a>), and therefore in larva, Picky LNs may provide inhibition onto both mPNs and other LNs. Unlike the Broad LNs, which are panglomerular and axonless, the Picky LNs present separated dendrites and axons (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4b</a>). Collectively, Picky LN dendrites roughly tile the antennal lobe (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4b</a>). While some Picky LN axons target select uPNs, about 40% of Picky LN outputs are dedicated to mPNs or each other (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4c</a>; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>).

This helped interpret the pattern of ORNs onto Picky LNs and mPNs. We found that some Picky LNs aggregate similarly responding ORNs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4d</a>; <a href=\"#fig4s4\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). For example, Picky LN 2 receives inputs preferentially from ORNs that respond to aromatic compounds, and Picky LN 3 and 4 similarly for aliphatic compounds (esters and alcohols; <a href=\"#fig4s4\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 4</a>).

These features are implemented through direct excitatory connections from ORNs or indirect inhibitory connections via Picky LNs (lateral inhibition; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4d</a>). Some ORNs affect the activity of the same mPN through both direct excitatory and lateral inhibitory connections through Picky LNs (incoherent feedforward loop, (<a href=\"#bib1\">Alon, 2007</a>); <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4d</a>).

Additionally, mPN B3 receives inputs from 33a, an ORN whose receptor lacks a known binding compound, and therefore is likely narrowly tuned to other ecologically relevant odorants as was shown for 49a and the pheromone of a parasitic wasp (<a href=\"#bib15\">Ebrahim et al., 2015</a>). The connectivity patterns of the 14 types of mPNs are vastly diverse from each other and likely each one extracts different features from odor space, often integrating inputs from non-ORN sensory neurons as well."

Neuromodulatory neurons that make direct morphological synapses onto LNs are serotonergic (CSD in pink; projects contralaterally after collecting inputs from near the MB calyx) and octopaminergic (lAL-1 and two tdc, in dark and light green), and all arborize well beyond the antennal lobe. Also included is Picky LN 0 (red). (<b>b</b>) A wiring diagram outlining the strong LN-LN connections, showing the core reciprocal inhibition between Broad LN Trio and Keystone that could mediate the switch between homogeneous (panglomerular) presynaptic inhibition and heterogenous (selective) presynaptic inhibition. For simplicity, neurons are grouped together if they belong to the same neuron type, with the number of neurons belonging to each group indicated in parentheses. Connections are weighted by the square root of the number of synapses between groups of neurons. The self-arrow for the Broad LN Trio represents the average number of synapses that one of the Trio neurons receives from the other two. Picky LN 0 inhibits Keystone, thereby disinhibiting the Broad LN Trio and promoting homogeneous presynaptic inhibition. The maxillary nerve sensory neurons are the top input providers of Keystone and may drive the system towards heterogeneous presynaptic inhibition (see C). The effect of direct inputs from neuromodulatory neurons is unknown, but at least it has been suggested that octopaminergic neurons may have an excitatory effect on inhibitory LNs (<a href=\"#bib35\">Linster and Smith, 1997</a>). (<b>c</b>) Cartoon of glomeruli colored by the percentage of inputs onto ORN axon terminals provided by the Broad LN Trio and from Keystone, indicating the amount of presynaptic inhibition (onto ORNs) in either state.

(<b>d</b>) The LNs putatively active in each state. (<b>e</b>) Unlike other Picky LNs, Picky LN 0 makes synapses onto ORN axon terminals and many uPNs. Here connections with 2 or more synapses consistent between bilaterally homologous neuron pairs are shown. Arrow thicknesses are weighted by the square root of the number of synapses between neurons. With the exception of 45a, all shown ORNs and uPNs belong to glomeruli that synapse onto Picky LN 0 as well.

Not surprisingly, one such ORN is 49a (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5c</a>), which is extremely specific for the sexual pheromone of a parasitic wasp that predates upon larvae (<a href=\"#bib15\">Ebrahim et al., 2015</a>). The other two ORNs that escape fully are 1a and 45b. 1a activation drives negative chemotaxis (Hernandez-Nu\u00f1ez et al., unpublished). 45b senses compounds that elicit negative chemotaxis in larvae (<a href=\"#bib31\">Kreher et al., 2008</a>). These three ORNs, and in particular 49a, are under strong postsynaptic inhibition by both Broad LN Duet and Choosy LNs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3c</a>). In summary, reducing presynaptic inhibition in these 3 ORNs may enable larvae to perceive odors evolutionarily associated with life-threatening situations less dependently of the response intensity of other ORNs (i.e. overall odorant concentration). This is consistent with the finding that responses to aversive odors may rely on specific activity patterns in individual ORNs (<a href=\"#bib20\">Gao et al., 2015</a>). The strong postsynaptic inhibition might be instrumental for their corresponding uPN to respond to the derivative of the ORN activity (with an incoherent feedforward loop; [<a href=\"#bib1\">Alon, 2007</a>]), as shown in the adult fly (<a href=\"#bib30\">Kim et al., 2015</a>), facilitating detection of concentration changes."

The wiring diagram therefore indicates that Picky LN 0, a likely glutamatergic LN, engages in seemingly contradictory circuit motifs: simultaneously inhibiting specific ORNs and their uPNs, while also disinhibiting them by inhibiting Keystone. The suppression of Keystone disinhibits the Broad LN Trio and therefore promotes homogeneous inhibition. However this is further nuanced by reciprocal connections between Picky LN 0 and Broad LN Trio (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5b</a>). This push-pull effect of glutamatergic LNs on PNs has been described for the olfactory system of the adult fly as conducive to more robust gain control and rapid transitions between network states (<a href=\"#bib36\">Liu and Wilson, 2013</a>). This refined control could endow Picky LN 0-innervated glomeruli like 42a (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5e</a>) with the ability to better detect odor gradients, consistent with 42a being a strong and reliable driver of appetitive chemotaxis (<a href=\"#bib17\">Fishilevich et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Asahina et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Schulze et al., 2015</a>)."

In zebrafish, GABAergic LNs provide depolarizing currents to PNs (mitral cells) via gap junctions at low stimulus intensities, enhancing low signals, and inhibit the same PNs at high stimulus intensity via GABA release, implementing a form of gain control (<a href=\"#bib79\">Zhu et al., 2013</a>). This role is played by a class of panglomerular excitatory LNs in the adult fly that make gap junctions onto PNs and excite inhibitory LNs (<a href=\"#bib78\">Yaksi and Wilson, 2010</a>). In the larva, all panglomerular neurons are GABAergic; if any were to present gap junctions with uPNs, a cell type for gain control in larva would be equivalent to the one in zebrafish. Particularly good candidates are the Broad LN Duet, which provide the bulk of feedforward inhibitory synapses onto uPNs in larva. Interestingly, postsynaptic inhibition might not be mediated by GABA in the adult fly (supp. fig. 5 in <a href=\"#bib52\">Olsen and Wilson [2008]</a>]), rendering olfactory circuits in larva more similar to vertebrates. Presynaptic inhibition exists both in the adult fly and, as suggested by the present work, in larva, and is mediated by the same kind of panglomerular GABAergic neurons (the Broad Trio LNs in larva; and see [<a href=\"#bib52\">Olsen and Wilson, 2008</a>])."

We found that each uPN receives an unusually large number of inputs from an individual ORN compared to other sensory systems in the larva (<a href=\"#bib48\">Ohyama et al., 2015</a>). This large number of morphological synapses could be interpreted as a strong connection, which would support faster or more reliable signal transmission. In the adult fly, the convergence of multiple ORNs onto an individual PN enables both a fast and reliable PN response to odors (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bhandawat et al., 2007</a>). The temporal dynamics of crawling are far slower than that of flying, and therefore we speculate that the integration over time of the output of a single ORN might suffice for reliability, demanding only numerous synapses to avoid saturation."

We postulate that navigation and feeding correspond to the homogeneous and heterogeneous states of presynaptic inhibition that we described. During navigation, homogeneous presynaptic inhibition (via Broad LN Trio) could best enhance salient stimuli and therefore chemotaxis, enabling the olfactory system to operate over a wide range of odorant intensities (<a href=\"#bib2\">Asahina et al., 2009</a>). During feeding, strongly stimulated ORNs could scale down the inputs provided by other, less stimulated, ORNs. In other words, if homogeneous presynaptic inhibition persisted during feeding, the larvae would lose the ability to detect important odorants that are likely to be faint, for example the scent of a predator such as a parasitic wasp via 49a (<a href=\"#bib15\">Ebrahim et al., 2015</a>). The larva can selectively release presynaptic inhibition via Keystone, which provides presynaptic inhibition to appetitive glomeruli while also inhibiting the Broad LN Trio\u2013the major providers of panglomerular presynaptic inhibition. So the larva could feed and remain vigilant to evolutionarily important cues at the same time. Not surprisingly, the switch might be triggered by neuromodulatory neurons and non-ORN sensory neurons, potentially gustatory, that synapse onto Keystone."

One such task could be the detection of concentration gradients for some odorant mixtures, suggesting an explanation for the observation that some ORNs can only drive chemotaxis when co-activated with other ORNs (<a href=\"#bib17\">Fishilevich et al., 2005</a>). Similar glomerular-mixing circuits have been described in higher brain areas (lateral horn) of the fly (<a href=\"#bib77\">Wong et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Fi\u015fek and Wilson, 2014</a>) and of mammals (<a href=\"#bib68\">Sosulski et al., 2011</a>). We hypothesize that in the larva, the morphological adaptations to a life of burrowing might have led to specific adaptations, relevant to an animal that eats with its head, and therefore the dorsal organ housing the ORNs, immersed in food. It is perhaps not surprising that we found multisensory integration across ORNs and non-ORNs (likely gustatory) already at the first synapse. And we hypothesize that the pooling of chemosensors (ORNs and non-ORNs) onto mPNs and Picky LNs may be related to the reduction in the number of ORNs relative to insects with airborne antennae."

Four of the obtained clusters correspond very well with odorant type (alcohols, aromatics, esters, and pyrazines; <a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3d</a>). The fifth cluster is mixed and mainly includes odorants with very low or no ORN response. Consistent with that, k-means clustering in the 32-dimensional odorant physical descriptor space described in (<a href=\"#bib26\">Haddad et al., 2008</a>) results in 5 clusters, 4 of them matching the non-mixed clusters obtained in ORN space (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3a</a>)."

But this is on purpose: these two neuron types, while deriving from different neurons lineages and presenting different neurotransmitters (which makes them deserving of different names), their connectivity is similar in that they both integrate inputs from a selective subset of ORNs and synapse onto a subset of PNs. To address the potential confusion, we have introduced a number of changes. First, we have changed a previously supplemental figure into a main figure (the revised manuscript\u2019s Figure 2). This figure clearly shows the differences in the synaptic partners for the picky and choosy LNs. Additionally, we added an extra figure supplement to Figure 1 (Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5) that illustrates the different lineages of all 14 of the LNs. The figure makes it clear that Broad LNs, Choosy LNs, Picky LNs, Ventral LN, and Keystone belong to different developmental lineages. Additionally, we have added an extra paragraph describing the differences between LN types before we discuss their functional roles in the circuits of the antennal lobe. Finally, we have added additional language when reintroducing the Picky and Choosy LNs that highlights the differences between the 2 LN types (glutamate vs. GABA; targeting very few uPNs vs. targeting most uPNs; different developmental lineages). We hope that this will clarify the different characteristics of these two cell types and justifies their names."

Since LNs in the Rybak paper are not fully reconstructed, interglomerular interactions (which is a major aspect of our paper) are only very partially addressed. For this reason, we cite Rybak two more times when talking about general intraglomerular LN-PN connections in the uniglomerular circuit: both when discussing connections between LNs and PNs and proximal vs distal connections of ORNs and LNs onto PNs (uPNs)."

Rendering the synapses in the same color as the skeleton seems to best show the glomerular structure of the antennal lobe, as well as the spatial extent of the glomeruli. Since our tracing method represents neurons as single dots in a slice (the skeleton), showing the synapses as the same color of the ORN best allows us to see the spatial extent of the boutons of the ORN and the ORNs relative location in the antennal lobe for identification, which is the main point of that figure. We will in any case offer the skeletons along with the EM online, accessible with a web browser at the Open Connectome Project website."

This allows the neuron to a small dendritic arbor that is selective, and a large axonal arbor that targets the uPNs of most glomeruli."
