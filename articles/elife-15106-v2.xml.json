                    "text": "Adolescent synaptic pruning is thought to enable optimal cognition because it is disrupted in certain neuropathologies, yet the initiator of this process is unknown. One factor not yet considered is the \u03b14\u03b2\u03b4 GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor (GABAR), an extrasynaptic inhibitory receptor which first emerges on dendritic spines at puberty in female mice. Here we show that \u03b14\u03b2\u03b4 GABARs trigger adolescent pruning. Spine density of CA1 hippocampal pyramidal cells decreased by half post-pubertally in female wild-type but not \u03b14 KO mice. This effect was associated with decreased expression of kalirin-7 (Kal7), a spine protein which controls actin cytoskeleton remodeling. Kal7 decreased at puberty as a result of reduced NMDAR activation due to \u03b14\u03b2\u03b4-mediated inhibition. In the absence of this inhibition, Kal7 expression was unchanged at puberty. In the unpruned condition, spatial re-learning was impaired. These data suggest that pubertal pruning requires \u03b14\u03b2\u03b4 GABARs. In their absence, pruning is prevented and cognition is not optimal."

                    "text": "Adolescent synaptic pruning is thought to enable optimal cognition because it is disrupted in certain neuropathologies, yet the initiator of this process is unknown. One factor not yet considered is the \u03b14\u03b2\u03b4 GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor (GABAR), an extrasynaptic inhibitory receptor which first emerges on dendritic spines at puberty in female mice. Here we show that \u03b14\u03b2\u03b4 GABARs trigger adolescent pruning. Spine density of CA1 hippocampal pyramidal cells decreased by half post-pubertally in female wild-type but not \u03b14 KO mice. This effect was associated with decreased expression of kalirin-7 (Kal7), a spine protein which controls actin cytoskeleton remodeling. Kal7 decreased at puberty as a result of reduced NMDAR activation due to \u03b14\u03b2\u03b4-mediated inhibition. In the absence of this inhibition, Kal7 expression was unchanged at puberty. In the unpruned condition, spatial re-learning was impaired. These data suggest that pubertal pruning requires \u03b14\u03b2\u03b4 GABARs. In their absence, pruning is prevented and cognition is not optimal."

In humans, the number of these brain connections increases dramatically from birth to childhood, reflecting a period of rapid learning. However, the number of these brain connections halves after puberty, a dramatic reduction shown in many brain areas and for many species, including humans and rodents. This process is referred to as adolescent synaptic pruning and is thought to be important for optimal learning in adulthood because it is disrupted in autism and schizophrenia. Synaptic pruning is believed to remove unnecessary brain connections to make room for new relevant memories. However, the process that triggers synaptic pruning is not known."

In the \u03b14 KO mouse, pruning does not take place and the cognitive ability of the post-pubertal mice is impaired. We also show \u03b14\u03b2\u03b4 and NMDAR involvement in the pruning process by the administration of selective drugs during the pubertal period (PND 35\u201344) to determine effects on spine density post-pubertally (PND 56). We further suggest that \u03b14\u03b2\u03b4-triggered pruning is due to impairment of NMDAR activation which regulates expression of kalirin-7 (Kal7), a Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) important for stabilizing the actin cytoskeleton (<a href=\"#bib58\">Penzes et al., 2001</a>)."

In contrast, NMDAR current was robust in the \u03b14 KO hippocampus (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a,b</a>), as we have previously shown for the \u03b4 KO hippocampus (<a href=\"#bib66\">Shen\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2010</a>), and after total GABAR blockade with 120\u2009\u03bcM SR95531 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a,b</a>). Thus, we tested the hypothesis that \u03b14\u03b2\u03b4 receptors reduce spine number via impairment of NMDAR activation by examining whether increasing expression of NMDARs during puberty could reduce pruning by overwhelming the \u03b14\u03b2\u03b4-generated inhibition. To this end, MK-801 was administered, at a dose shown to increase hippocampal NMDAR expression compensatorily (<a href=\"#bib25\">Gao and Tamminga, 1995</a>), during the pubertal period (0.25 mg/kg,i.p., once daily for 10 days). Spine density was evaluated post-pubertally. Pubertal MK-801 administration increased spine density by 100% in both proximal and distal dendrites post-pubertally (p&lt;0.001). This reflected a significant increase in the density of mushroom and stubby spines (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2c\u2013e</a>). Conversely, blockade of NMDARs with memantine, which does not alter NMDAR expression (<a href=\"#bib16\">Cole et al., 2013</a>), administered to pubertal \u03b14 KO mice reduced spine density post-pubertally by 50% (p&lt;0.01). Memantine decreased mushroom and stubby spines and increased thin spines (p&lt;0.05, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2f\u2013h</a>). These data suggest that reduced NMDAR activity mediates synaptic pruning at puberty and that \u03b14\u03b2\u03b4 GABARs are novel regulators of NMDARs which trigger this process."

Reduction of current through \u03b15\u03b2\u03b32 GABARs was accomplished with the partial inverse agonist L-655,708 (L655, 50 nM) (<a href=\"#bib60\">Ramerstorfer et al., 2010</a>), which had no effect on evoked NMDA current (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a,b</a>) recorded from pubertal slices. In order to test the effect of GABAR sub-types on synaptic pruning, we administered L655 during the pubertal period (PND 35\u201344) and assessed spine density post-pubertally (PND 56). As predicted, pubertal administration of L655 produced no change in spine density post-pubertally (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>), nor did the benzodiazepine lorazepam (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) which targets the primarily synaptic \u03b32-containing GABARs (<a href=\"#bib69\">Sigel, 2002</a>). These findings suggest that \u03b14\u03b2\u03b4 GABARs selectively reduce spine density at puberty. As expected, total GABAR blockade during puberty (picrotoxin, 3 mg/kg, i.p.) prevented pruning post-pubertally (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>), increasing spine density by ~200%. Both mushroom (&gt;900%) and stubby (100%) spines were increased while thin spines were decreased (75%, p&lt;0.05)."

Kal7 expression in hippocampal dendrites decreased by almost 50% at puberty (p&lt;0.05) compared to pre-puberty (PND 28\u201330), an effect prevented by knock-out of \u03b14, which increased its expression by ~120% (p&lt;0.001) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a\u2013d</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We tested whether NMDARs played a role in Kal7 expression, which is activity-dependent (<a href=\"#bib48\">Ma et al., 2011</a>). Increasing NMDAR expression at puberty increased Kal7 expression by ~100% (p&lt;0.001; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4e,f</a>), while NMDAR blockade with memantine (10 mg/kg, i.p.) reduced Kal7 expression by ~50% in the adult CA1 hippocampus (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4g,h</a>).

In both tasks, post-pubertal \u03b14 KO mice showed impaired acquisition and retention of the second location, despite initial learning scores similar to WT mice (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5c-d, f</a>). This was a cognitive deficit because locomotor activity, shock tolerance and object interest did not differ from WT (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5e,g</a>). As predicted, reducing synaptic pruning in the WT mouse with MK-801 impaired re-learning performance on MPORT, while restoring synaptic pruning in the \u03b14 KO mice by blocking NMDARs with memantine, improved performance on this task (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

In order to explain this outcome, we examined the effect of initial learning and re-learning of MPORT on the distribution of spine types in CA1 hippocampal pyramidal cells. To this end, mouse brains were processed with the Golgi method by 1\u20132\u2009hr after each learning or re-learning paradigm. Initial learning resulted in a ~150% increase in mushroom spine-types (p&lt;0.05), with similar increases in stubby spine types (~200%, p&lt;0.05) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). After the second learning trial (re-learning), mushroom spine types were additionally increased by ~50\u2013100% (p&lt;0.05), while thin spine types were decreased by ~70% (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>); the density of stubby spines did not change significantly. Thus, increases in mushroom spine density accompanied both learning and re-learning trials. Pubertal administration of picrotoxin (3 mg/kg, i.p.) to block GABARs also prevented synaptic pruning (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>) and impaired re-learning (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) in the post-pubertal mouse. Under these conditions, mushroom spine density was almost 300% greater in the na\u00efve condition compared to the untreated mouse (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, <a href=\"#fig6\">6</a>), and additional increases in mushroom spine density were only observed after learning (~50% increase, p&lt;0.05), but not after relearning (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). Stubby spines were additionally increased to a lesser extent (~20%) in the distal dendrites after learning. Because re-learning was impaired in this unpruned condition, these findings suggest that only successful learning/re-learning increases the mushroom spine density of CA1 hippocampal pyramidal neurons."

Our findings suggest that \u03b14\u03b2\u03b4 GABARs play a critical role in this process. \u03b14\u03b2\u03b4 GABARs are uniquely localized to spines during puberty where they reduce NMDAR current (<a href=\"#bib66\">Shen et al., 2010</a>), necessary for spine stability (<a href=\"#bib1\">Alvarez et al., 2007</a>). In contrast, blockade of the predominant extrasynaptic GABAR in CA1 hippocampus, \u03b15\u03b23\u03b32, did not facilitate NMDAR activation or alter synaptic pruning during the pubertal period, nor did modulation of synaptic \u03b32-containing GABARs with 200 nM SR95531 or lorazepam. Thus, these findings suggest that \u03b14\u03b2\u03b4 GABARs selectively trigger synaptic pruning at puberty via impairment of NMDAR activation. This is in contrast to visual cortex, where synaptic \u03b11\u03b22\u03b32 GABARs target dendritic spines (<a href=\"#bib39\">Kawaguchi and Kubota, 1997</a>), and play a role in spine maturation (<a href=\"#bib31\">Heinen et al., 2003</a>). Pubertal synaptic pruning is not dependent upon the ovarian hormone estradiol (<a href=\"#bib82\">Yildirim et al., 2008</a>), which in fact increases spine density (<a href=\"#bib80\">Woolley et al., 1997</a>)."

This is the most likely mechanism by which MK-801 increased spine density in the present study where injections were administered once a day during the pubertal period. In the pre-frontal cortex, only a single low dose of MK-801 increases NMDAR expression on pyramidal cells (<a href=\"#bib81\">Xi et al., 2009</a>), while higher doses have no effect, but decrease NMDAR expression and AMPA receptor-mediated currents of fast-spiking interneurons (<a href=\"#bib78\">Wang and Gao, 2012</a>) suggesting that effects of this drug are cell-type and region specific. Other studies have suggested that peri-adolescent administration of MK-801 alters GABAergic circuits in adulthood (<a href=\"#bib74\">Thomases et al., 2013</a>).

Kal7 activates the small GTPase Rac1 which regulates the actin cytoskeleton via P21-activated kinases within the spine (<a href=\"#bib50\">Ma et al., 2014</a>). Although many proteins localize to the spine, Kal7 is one of the few shown to be necessary for maintenance of existing spines (<a href=\"#bib58\">Penzes et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Ma et al., 2003</a>). That may explain results from the present study where a 50% reduction in Kal7 expression at puberty resulted in a 50% decrease in spine number. The fact that synaptic pruning was prevented in the absence of Kal7 expression suggests that dynamic regulation of Kal7 expression during adolescence may be one factor underlying synaptic pruning. However, many other spine proteins have been identified which alter spine density, including shank3, IQGAP1, valosin, axin and NEDD9 (<a href=\"#bib61\">Roussignol et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Gao et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Wiesmann et al., 1975</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Knutson et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Chen et al., 2015</a>).

These two spine types are well-characterized and sub-serve different functions: Thin spines express abundant numbers of NMDARs, are highly motile and plastic (<a href=\"#bib38\">Kasai et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Holtmaat et al., 2006</a>), while the larger mushroom spines are relatively more stable and express AMPA receptors predominantly (<a href=\"#bib20\">Dumitriu et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Matsuzaki et al., 2001</a>). Recent studies using two photon technology to assess changes in spines produced by NMDAR-dependent LTP, an in vitro model of learning, have shown that smaller 'thin' spines develop enlarged heads and resemble 'mushroom' spines following LTP induction, accompanied by increased expression of AMPA receptors (<a href=\"#bib32\">Hill and Zito, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Kopec et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Harvey and Svoboda, 2007</a>).

The high spine density in the unpruned condition in the present study selectively impaired re-learning, while learning a spatial task was similar to controls. The impairments in re-learning in the unpruned conditions may be due to the higher prevalence of mushroom-type spines and lower density of thin spine-types. Mushroom spine density was only increased above its already elevated level in the unpruned mouse following the learning trial. No additional increases in mushroom spines were observed for the unsuccessful re-learning trial. There may be a maximum number of mushroom spines that can be supported by a dendritic segment due to the energy requirement necessary for spine maintenance or due to spatial constraints. Alternatively, the lower density of thin spines may have been insufficient to permit successful re-learning."

In addition, the spine density of the control, post-pubertal mice may reflect the lower limit of synapse number because these mice were housed in non-enriched cages with limited sensory stimuli. Numerous studies have shown that exposure to more complex environments, even for 1\u2009hr per day, increases spine density in many areas of the CNS, including CA1 hipppocampus (<a href=\"#bib75\">Turner and Greenough, 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Jung and Herms, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Kitanishi et al., 2009</a>).

The most important new finding is that the previously observed expression of the GABA receptor, alpha4-\u03b2-\u03b4 on dendritic spines at the onset of puberty in female mice triggers pruning of synapses in area CA1 of the hippocampus that results in fewer mushroom shaped and stubby spines on CA1 pyramidal neurons in the post-pubertal period. Deletion of \u03b14 containing GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors prevents the pubertal pruning and results in spatial learning deficits after puberty. Furthermore, their results suggest a link between \u03b14 inhibitory drive, resulting in decrease in NMDA receptor function, and decreased Kal7 expression in the initial steps leading to excitatory synaptic pruning in the female adolescent CA1."

Indeed, it detracts from the interest of the data because it is not accurate. The work stands on its own as being important and does not need to be presented as relevant to a disease model. Because autism emerges in very young individuals (2-3 years old), a mechanism that occurs predominantly at puberty may be altered in some autistic patients, but it could not be causal. One paper cited by the authors suggests a link between synaptic pruning and autism, mediated by an mTor pathway, in the cortex. The other citation (Hoogenraad) does not mention synaptic pruning and should not be cited in this context. The link between autism and mutation of GABARalpha-4 is listed on the SFARI website as category 4: minimal evidence, linkage having been found in just two directed studies. There are over 100 gene mutations associated with ASD. Thus, GABARalpha4 isn't seen as having a strong linkage to autism. The link to autism should be removed from the Abstract and Introduction. It would be appropriate to mention it briefly as a possibility in the Discussion, along with a potential link to schizophrenia and other mental illnesses that emerge at adolescence."

This assertion is overstated and should be appropriately qualified. The authors state on page 10 that kalirin-7 is the only spine protein shown to alter spine density. This is not correct. As just one example, IQGAP1 has also been shown to regulate spine density (J. Neurosci. 31: 8533-8542, 2011). The authors need to improve their knowledge of the literature on regulation of spine density and modify this part of the text accordingly. They have shown that expression of kalirin-7 at puberty is changed in the \u03b14 KO and it is appropriate to indicate that this change in expression may contribute to the change in spine density; however, it is not appropriate to attribute the entire effect to kalirin expression. The signaling pathways that control spine density are complex and various. To show that kalirin-7 is the critical link in this system, the authors would have to artificially express kalirin-7 in the CA1 pyramidal neurons at puberty in the WT mice and show that the exogenous over-expression eliminates the pruning. Alternatively, they would need to specifically knock-down kalirin-7 in the KO neurons and show that this leads to increased pruning. Since these experiments haven't been done, and would be difficult, the authors should simply indicate that the increased activation of NMDARs in the \u03b14 KO enhances expression of kalirin-7 at spines, and <i>suggests</i> that kalirin-7 may be a critical part of the mechanism for initiating pruning during puberty."

This is understandable, but it should be stated in the Abstract. Do the authors know whether the ensuing synaptic pruning is related exclusively to the female CA1? Is it known whether \u03b14 containing GABA receptors emerge on dendrites during adolescence in males? Any specific link to females would be important to discuss in connection with the relationship of this pruning mechanism to neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism and schizophrenia. Autism is four times more prevalent in males than females. Similarly, a role for synaptic pruning was recently revisited in schizophrenia, as the authors cite. However, without knowing if the \u03b14 GABAR-mediated pruning is active in males, it is difficult to make a connection to schizophrenia."

Indeed, it detracts from the interest of the data because it is not accurate. The work stands on its own as being important and does not need to be presented as relevant to a disease model. Because autism emerges in very young individuals (2-3 years old), a mechanism that occurs predominantly at puberty may be altered in some autistic patients, but it could not be causal. One paper cited by the authors suggests a link between synaptic pruning and autism, mediated by an mTor pathway, in the cortex. The other citation (Hoogenraad) does not mention synaptic pruning and should not be cited in this context. The link between autism and mutation of GABARalpha-4 is listed on the SFARI website as category 4: minimal evidence, linkage having been found in just two directed studies. There are over 100 gene mutations associated with ASD. Thus, GABARalpha4 isn't seen as having a strong linkage to autism. The link to autism should be removed from the Abstract and Introduction. It would be appropriate to mention it briefly as a possibility in the Discussion, along with a potential link to schizophrenia and other mental illnesses that emerge at adolescence."

This assertion is overstated and should be appropriately qualified. The authors state on page 10 that kalirin-7 is the only spine protein shown to alter spine density. This is not correct. As just one example, IQGAP1 has also been shown to regulate spine density (J. Neurosci. 31: 8533-8542, 2011). The authors need to improve their knowledge of the literature on regulation of spine density and modify this part of the text accordingly. They have shown that expression of kalirin-7 at puberty is changed in the \u03b14 KO and it is appropriate to indicate that this change in expression may contribute to the change in spine density; however, it is not appropriate to attribute the entire effect to kalirin expression. The signaling pathways that control spine density are complex and various. To show that kalirin-7 is the critical link in this system, the authors would have to artificially express kalirin-7 in the CA1 pyramidal neurons at puberty in the WT mice and show that the exogenous over-expression eliminates the pruning. Alternatively, they would need to specifically knock-down kalirin-7 in the KO neurons and show that this leads to increased pruning. Since these experiments haven't been done, and would be difficult, the authors should simply indicate that the increased activation of NMDARs in the \u03b14 KO enhances expression of kalirin-7 at spines, and suggests that kalirin-7 may be a critical part of the mechanism for initiating pruning during puberty."

This is understandable, but it should be stated in the Abstract. Do the authors know whether the ensuing synaptic pruning is related exclusively to the female CA1? Is it known whether \u03b14 containing GABA receptors emerge on dendrites during adolescence in males? Any specific link to females would be important to discuss in connection with the relationship of this pruning mechanism to neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism and schizophrenia. Autism is four times more prevalent in males than females. Similarly, a role for synaptic pruning was recently revisited in schizophrenia, as the authors cite. However, without knowing if the \u03b14 GABAR-mediated pruning is active in males, it is difficult to make a connection to schizophrenia."
