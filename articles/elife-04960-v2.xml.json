The essence of asymmetric cell division (ACD) is the polarization of cells and subsequent division, leading to unequal compartmentalization of cellular/extracellular components that confer distinct cell fates to daughter cells. Because precocious cell division before establishing cell polarity would lead to failure in ACD, these two processes must be tightly coupled; however, the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. In <i>Drosophila</i> male germline stem cells, ACD is prepared by stereotypical centrosome positioning. The centrosome orientation checkpoint (COC) further serves to ensure ACD by preventing mitosis upon centrosome misorientation. In this study, we show that Bazooka (Baz) provides a platform for the correct centrosome orientation and that Baz-centrosome association is the key event that is monitored by the COC. Our work provides a foundation for understanding how the correct cell polarity may be recognized by the cell to ensure productive ACD."

The essence of asymmetric cell division (ACD) is the polarization of cells and subsequent division, leading to unequal compartmentalization of cellular/extracellular components that confer distinct cell fates to daughter cells. Because precocious cell division before establishing cell polarity would lead to failure in ACD, these two processes must be tightly coupled; however, the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. In <i>Drosophila</i> male germline stem cells, ACD is prepared by stereotypical centrosome positioning. The centrosome orientation checkpoint (COC) further serves to ensure ACD by preventing mitosis upon centrosome misorientation. In this study, we show that Bazooka (Baz) provides a platform for the correct centrosome orientation and that Baz-centrosome association is the key event that is monitored by the COC. Our work provides a foundation for understanding how the correct cell polarity may be recognized by the cell to ensure productive ACD."

The spindle consists of long protein filaments that extend from two smaller structures known as centrosomes, which are found at opposite sides of the cell. The position of these centrosomes governs the orientation of the spindle, which in turn determines the plane in which cell division takes place. Thus, cells that need to divide with a certain orientation must have a mechanism that ensures that their centrosomes are correctly positioned. However, the existence of such a mechanism has been underexplored, and it remains unclear how the alignment of the centrosomes is controlled."

The experiments revealed that a protein called Bazooka (or Baz for short) closely associates with the centrosomes just before the cells start to divide. Many other animals\u2014such as humans and worms\u2014have proteins that are closely related to Bazooka, which are needed for asymmetric cell divisions. When Inaba et al. reduced the levels of the Bazooka protein in the fruit fly cells, a large number of these cells ended up with centrosomes that were incorrectly aligned. As a result, these cells' spindles were also oriented incorrectly."

A similar spindle orientation checkpoint mechanism is also reported in fission yeast (<a href=\"#bib6\">Gachet et al., 2006</a>).

Asymmetric stem cell division is achieved by stereotypical positioning of the mother and daughter centrosomes in order to orient the spindle perpendicularly to the hub cells, the major component of the stem cell niche (<a href=\"#bib38\">Yamashita et al., 2003</a>, <a href=\"#bib39\">2007</a>). Stereotypical centrosome behavior that occurs in preparation for asymmetric cell division has been described in other stem cell systems (<a href=\"#bib24\">Rebollo et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Rusan and Peifer, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Wang et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Conduit and Raff, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Januschke et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Lu et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Salzmann et al., 2014</a>), suggesting the evolutionarily conserved nature of the process. Asymmetric GSC division is further ensured by the centrosome orientation checkpoint (COC) that prevents mitotic entry in the presence of incorrectly oriented centrosomes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib4\">Cheng et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Inaba et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Yuan et al., 2012</a>). Upon sensing the centrosome misorientation, COC is activated to prevent mitotic entry (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Thus, the defective COC can be suggested by the presence of misoriented spindles. We have shown that the centrosomal protein Cnn and a polarity kinase Par-1 are critical component of the COC, defects of which leading to high frequency of spindle misorientation (<a href=\"#bib9\">Inaba et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Yuan et al., 2012</a>)."

In the operation of the COC, what is sensed as correct or incorrect centrosome orientation to inactivate or activate the COC remains unknown. Here, we show that Bazooka (Baz)/Par-3, a well-established polarity protein and a known substrate of Par-1 kinase, forms a small subcellular structure that anchors the centrosome right before mitotic entry.

Because we previously found that Par-1 is a critical component of the COC (<a href=\"#bib40\">Yuan et al., 2012</a>), we examined the role of Baz in the centrosome orientation and/or COC. Baz has been reported to localize at the hub-GSC interface along with E-cadherin following overexpression in the germline (nos &gt; Baz-GFP) (<a href=\"#bib14\">Leatherman and Dinardo, 2010</a>), which was confirmed by using independent UAS-Baz-YFP construct (see below). However, closer inspection using antibody staining and Flytrap Baz-GFP that expresses endogenous levels of Baz [CC01941 (<a href=\"#bib11\">Kelso et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Buszczak et al., 2007</a>)] revealed that Baz forms foci at the hub-GSC interface (referred to as the \u2018Baz patch\u2019 hereafter), instead of entirely colocalizing with E-cadherin (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a>). The Baz patch is a small structure, with a size of approximately 1.5 \u00b5m, and this patch is considerably smaller than the GSC-hub interface that is marked by E-cadherin (4\u20136 \u00b5m) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). We noticed that the Baz patch was often closely associated with the apical centrosome (68.8 \u00b1 2.2% of total GSCs; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, arrowheads). We termed this close association of the Baz patch and the centrosome \u2018Baz-centrosome docking\u2019. Baz-centrosome docking is a more specific criteria compared to centrosome orientation: \u223c90% of total GSCs had \u2018oriented\u2019 centrosomes, a category that can be further subdivided into GSCs with \u2018oriented, but not docked\u2019 centrosomes (\u223c20%) and those with \u2018oriented and docked\u2019 centrosomes (\u223c70%) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>).

GSCs that were positive for BrdU were always connected with their differentiating daughters (GBs), which were also positive for BrdU in synchrony. This finding suggests that GSCs (and GBs) enter S phase prior to cytokinesis and that the G1 phase is extremely short.

Thus, late G2 GSCs were detected as nuclear Dap-positive cells.

Ectopic Baz patches were often associated with misoriented centrosomes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>, inset), suggesting that the Baz patch has the ability to dock to centrosomes ectopically, even outside the hub-GSC interface. Strikingly, Baz overexpression led to a high frequency of spindle misorientation as well as centrosome misorientation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F,G</a>). These data indicate that the Baz patch can ectopically dock the centrosome, and this docking is sufficient to satisfy the requirement of the COC, allowing GSCs to enter mitosis with misoriented spindles (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H</a>)."

Recently, we showed that the treatment of testes with colcemid, a microtubule depolymerizing agent, can serve as a sensitive assay to monitor the COC activity (<a href=\"#bib34\">Venkei and Yamashita, 2015</a>). When testes were incubated with colcemid, spermatogonia, the differentiating progeny of GSCs, arrest in mitosis due to the activation of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC). On the contrary, GSCs arrest in G2 phase of the cell cycle instead of mitosis due to centrosome misorientation and activation of COC, which operates prior to SAC. In the absence of functional COC (such as in <i>par-1</i> mutant), however, colcemid treatment leads to SAC-mediated mitotic arrest by bypassing COC-mediated G2 arrest (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3I</a>). Thus, accumulation of mitotic GSCs in the presence of colcemid serves as a sensitive readout of defective COC. By using this method, we assessed the activity of COC in control, Baz RNAi and Baz-overexpressing GSCs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3I</a>). Indeed, the results confirmed the model obtained by the scoring of centrosome/spindle orientation: (1) Baz RNAi GSCs maintain relatively intact COC activity, and (2) Baz-YFP overexpression allows GSCs to enter mitosis, presumably through ectopic Baz-centrosome docking, which inactivates COC activity."

Considering the (partial) requirement of Baz in COC, we speculate that Baz may play dual roles in COC, depending on the centrosome-docking status: it might contribute to activation of COC when undocked with centrosomes, whereas it might inactivate COC when docked with centrosomes."

To begin to address the relationship between Baz and Par-1 in the COC, we first examined the phosphorylation status of Baz using phosphorylation-specific antibodies against phospho-S151 (pS151) and phospho-S1085 (pS1085) (<a href=\"#bib12\">Krahn et al., 2009</a>).

Interestingly, phosphorylation of the Baz patch is dependent on the cell cycle and/or centrosome orientation status. Baz phosphorylation was considerably weaker in GSCs in early G2 phase with undocked but oriented centrosomes (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,D</a>) compared to that in GSCs in late G2 phase when the centrosome is docked to the Baz patch (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,D</a>).

Notably, Baz-SE did not rescue the centrosome misorientation phenotype, and overexpression of Baz-SE in a wild-type background resulted in a high frequency of centrosome misorientation, despite near complete suppression of spindle misorientation caused by Par-1 RNAi. These observations suggest that although phosphorylation of Baz is sufficient for COC function, dephosphorylation is also important for anchoring the centrosomes. The cell cycle-dependent phosphorylation cycle of Baz (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013D</a>) is also consistent with the idea that the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation cycle of Baz may be important for anchoring the centrosomes and monitoring centrosome orientation. Taken together, these results reveal the critical function of Par-1-mediated Baz phosphorylation in the function of the COC."

After inducing GSC clones at a low frequency (i.e., dominantly single GSC clone/testis), symmetric outcome can be assessed by scoring the frequency of \u2018doublet\u2019 clones (i.e. two GSC clones are juxtaposed each other) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A\u2013C</a>) (<a href=\"#bib28\">Salzmann et al., 2013</a>). Wild-type GSC clones showed a basal level of doublet frequency (\u223c10%) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). This is due to expected low frequency events: (1) two juxtaposing GSCs become clones independently, and (2) \u2018crawling back\u2019 of GBs to the niche causes symmetric outcome of the division as described previously (<a href=\"#bib30\">Sheng and Matunis, 2011</a>). dCR4h clones showed increased doublet frequency due to symmetric divisions as described previously (<a href=\"#bib28\">Salzmann et al., 2013</a>). GSC clones of Baz overexpression, Baz RNAi or Par-1 RNAi showed significant increase in the frequency of doublet clones (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). In contrast, GSC clones of Baz-SA as well as dCR4h with Baz RNAi did not increase the frequency of doublet clones. We did not examine Baz-SE, since Baz-SE yielded extremely low frequency of GSC clone induction for unknown reasons. These results demonstrate a correlation between COC defect/spindle misorientation and symmetric GSC division. However, the extent of spindle misorientation and the doublet clone frequency did not perfectly correlate, suggesting that there may be additional mechanisms to contribute to symmetric outcome: for example, spindle misorientation may not necessarily lead to symmetric GSC divisions, if spindle orientation is corrected after entering mitosis or the GSC clones are defective in niche adhesion in addition to spindle orientation."

Precocious cell division before establishment of correct polarity would lead to a deleterious outcome, such as a failure in cell fate determination; however, the presence of checkpoint mechanisms to ensure asymmetric division has not been thoroughly investigated. In <i>Drosophila</i> neuroblasts, which divide asymmetrically by stereotypically oriented spindles, a phenomenon called \u2018telophase rescue\u2019 has been reported: many mutants that compromise correct spindle orientation in neuroblasts eventually divide asymmetrically (<a href=\"#bib15\">Lu et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Schober et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Wodarz et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Peng et al., 2000</a>). In \u2018telophase rescue\u2019, asymmetric outcome of the division is restored by correcting the localization of basal polarity proteins (<a href=\"#bib29\">Schober et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Peng et al., 2000</a>). Such correction might indicate the presence of an orientation/polarity checkpoint, although the mechanistic basis remains unknown. Thus, the COC may serve as a model system to study a new class of checkpoints that specialize in monitoring division orientation in multicellular organisms."

Baz forms a subcellular structure (Baz patch) at the hub-GSC interface, which anchors the apical centrosome prior to mitotic entry. Our data indicate that Baz-centrosome docking is the cellular event that is recognized by the COC as correct centrosome orientation. The data presented in this study point to the following working model (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>): (1) Baz patch is formed at the hub-GSC interphase in an E-cadherin-dependent manner. (2) Baz patch functions to recruit the centrosome. In the absence of Baz, centrosome is highly misoriented. (3) Baz is (partially) required for the COC activity. Baz patch that is not docked to the centrosome might contribute to the activation of COC to prevent mitotic entry. (4) Once Baz patch is docked to the centrosome, this docking is interpreted as 'correct centrosome orientation\u2019, leading to inactivation of COC and thus mitotic entry. This model indicates that Baz plays dual roles in COC depending on its centrosome-docking status: in the absence of docking, Baz patch activates COC, whereas centrosome-docked Baz functions to inactivate COC."

With the currently available data, it is unclear how temporal regulation of Baz phosphorylation relates to steps of Baz-centrosome docking, mitotic entry, and spindle orientation. Furthermore, it is puzzling that overexpression of Baz causes high frequency of spindle misorientation in wild type, whereas the overexpression of the same construct in Par-1 RNAi background lowers spindle misorientation. Future investigation is required to understand how distinct isoforms of Baz (phosphorylated vs non-phosphorylated) participate in distinct aspects of centrosome/spindle orientation."

Also, an important control is to show that overexpression of wild type Baz does not cause this suppression. In any case, the phosphomimetic and phosphodead experiments are done using overexpression experiments. As overexpression of wild-type Baz causes centrosome and spindle defects, these results are not easily interpretable. Since the alternative, of making transformants with wild-type expression is time consuming, the authors should address this issue as a caveat and provide some explanation as to why these data still remain viable. In the absence of such data, perhaps the authors will want to soften their description of this phenomenon as a \u201ccheckpoint\u201d."

However, by the time of second mitosis (which can easily go beyond 20-30 hours after starting the ex vivo culture), the condition of the culture would not be an ideal one, leaving a concern on how valid the measured cell cycle time might be."

We showed that upon addition of colcemid, whereas spermatogonia (differentiating progeny of GSCs) arrest in mitosis due to spindle assembly checkpoint, much like any other cell types reported to date (including mammalian culture cells etc.), GSCs instead arrest in G2 phase due to activation of COC (microtubule depolymerization leads to centrosome misorientation, which activates COC). We have further shown that, in GSCs defective in COC (such as par-1 mutant), GSCs would enter and arrest in mitosis (now due to the spindle assembly checkpoint, which is independent of COC). Thus, accumulation of mitotic GSCs in the presence of colcemid can serve as a very sensitive assay to detect defective COC."

Also, an important control is to show that overexpression of wild type Baz does not cause this suppression. In any case, the phosphomimetic and phosphodead experiments are done using overexpression experiments. As overexpression of wild-type Baz causes centrosome and spindle defects, these results are not easily interpretable. Since the alternative, of making transformants with wild-type expression is time consuming, the authors should address this issue as a caveat and provide some explanation as to why these data still remain viable. In the absence of such data, perhaps the authors will want to soften their description of this phenomenon as a</i> \u201c<i>checkpoint</i>\u201d."

This showed that wild type Baz can also rescue the spindle misorientation phenotype of Par-1 RNAi, whereas Baz-SA does not. These data indicate that: 1) Baz phosphorylation is critical for spindle orientation, 2) but (as reviewer suspected) the timing of phosphorylation might not play a major role in COC. We added these discussions in the main text, and also softened the description of checkpoint as suggested by the reviewers."
