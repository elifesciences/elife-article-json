The RRE assembles a Rev oligomer that displays nuclear export sequences (NESs) for recognition by the Crm1-Ran<sup>GTP</sup> nuclear receptor complex. Here we provide the first view of an assembled HIV-host nuclear export complex using single-particle electron microscopy. Unexpectedly, Crm1 forms a dimer with an extensive interface that enhances association with Rev-RRE and poises NES binding sites to interact with a Rev oligomer. The interface between Crm1 monomers explains differences between Crm1 orthologs that alter nuclear export and determine cellular tropism for viral replication. The arrangement of the export complex identifies a novel binding surface to possibly target an HIV inhibitor and may point to a broader role for Crm1 dimerization in regulating host gene expression."

The RRE assembles a Rev oligomer that displays nuclear export sequences (NESs) for recognition by the Crm1-Ran<sup>GTP</sup> nuclear receptor complex. Here we provide the first view of an assembled HIV-host nuclear export complex using single-particle electron microscopy. Unexpectedly, Crm1 forms a dimer with an extensive interface that enhances association with Rev-RRE and poises NES binding sites to interact with a Rev oligomer. The interface between Crm1 monomers explains differences between Crm1 orthologs that alter nuclear export and determine cellular tropism for viral replication. The arrangement of the export complex identifies a novel binding surface to possibly target an HIV inhibitor and may point to a broader role for Crm1 dimerization in regulating host gene expression."

Without a complete structure, it is unclear, for example, how HIV modulates Rev-RRE activity through mutations in the RRE that change the RNA fold yet minimally affect Rev binding (<a href=\"#bib34\">Legiewicz et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Sloan et al., 2013</a>) or how subtle amino acid substitutions between nearly identical orthologs of Crm1 restrict HIV replication in different species (<a href=\"#bib45\">Nagai-Fukataki et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Sherer et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Elinav et al., 2012</a>). Here we report the overall architecture of the Rev-RRE/Crm1-Ran<sup>GTP</sup> export complex using single-particle electron microscopy (EM). Unexpectedly, Rev-RRE forms a complex with an ordered Crm1 dimer, unlike previously characterized cargoes that bind a Crm1 monomer (<a href=\"#bib16\">Dong et al., 2009</a>). Residues unique to simian primates form a dimerization interface between Crm1 monomers that is seen as a crystal contact in the structure of human Crm1 (<a href=\"#bib16\">Dong et al., 2009</a>). It appears that RRE-directed remodeling of the Rev oligomer (<a href=\"#bib31\">Jayaraman et al., 2014</a>) may organize the Rev NESs to enhance avidity for the Crm1 dimer and help tune its export activity. It will be interesting to determine if some cellular protein-RNA complexes may also utilize Crm1 dimerization to tune nuclear export."

Crm1 co-purified with GB1-Rev in the presence of both Ran<sup>GTP</sup> and the RRE (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, lane 11), but showed only a weak interaction with Ran<sup>GDP</sup> or without the RRE (compare lane 11 to lanes 12 and 9). The interaction between Crm1 and Rev requires a functional NES, as GB1-Rev bearing a dominant-negative M10 mutation in the NES, Leu78Asp and Glu79Leu (<a href=\"#bib37\">Malim et al., 1989</a>), did not bind Crm1 under any condition (lanes 17\u201318 and 21\u201324). These results mirror in vivo and in vitro experiments showing that Rev uses an intact NES to bridge the interaction between the RRE and Crm1 utilizing Ran<sup>GTP</sup> (<a href=\"#bib24\">Fischer et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Fornerod et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Askjaer et al., 1998</a>). Furthermore, our data directly show for the first time that the RRE enhances the Rev-Crm1 interaction, supporting the hypothesis that the Rev NES must be recognized in the proper Rev-RRE context to function (<a href=\"#bib2\">Askjaer et al., 1999</a>)."

We used size-exclusion chromatography to further determine if these Rev-RRE complexes can associate with Crm1 and Ran<sup>Q69L</sup>, a mutant that stabilizes the GTP-bound form of Ran (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bischoff et al., 1994</a>). When increasing amounts of Crm1-Ran<sup>Q69L</sup> were added to a fixed concentration of Rev-RRE, all four components eluted in a 462 kD fraction (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a>), corresponding to two copies of Crm1 and Ran<sup>Q69L</sup> per Rev-RRE complex (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In fact, negatively stained electron micrographs of complexes from this fraction clearly show two Crm1 molecules per single particle, compared to images of Crm1 monomers alone (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E,F</a>). A Crm1 dimer explains the need for at least two NESs in the Rev oligomer to function (<a href=\"#bib30\">Hoffmann et al., 2012</a>), and it may also be important for efficiently transporting the RRE through the nuclear pore complex since the number of receptors required for nuclear transport scales with the size of the cargo (<a href=\"#bib50\">Ribbeck and G\u00f6rlich, 2002</a>). A Crm1 monomer is thought to use a protein adaptor to export relatively small, structured RNAs (<a href=\"#bib39\">McCloskey et al., 2012</a>). In contrast, the RRE is almost twice the size of host RNA cargoes, is embedded in a much larger mRNA, and is bound to the Rev oligomer."

The ends of the interface near Thr346 utilize Glu345 to form a salt bridge with Lys531 (2.8 \u00c5) and hydrogen bond with Gln530 (2.8 \u00c5) on the other monomer. The sum of these interactions enables human Crm1 to form an ordered dimer interface upon Rev-RRE binding."

The apparent binding constant for human Crm1 to Rev-RRE was slightly, yet significantly (p &lt; 0.01), higher than for murine Crm1 (K<sub>1/2</sub> = 297 \u00b1 30 nM vs 450 \u00b1 43 nM), and the human protein achieved higher maximal saturation (M = 0.96 \u00b1 0.010 vs 0.90 \u00b1 0.016, p &lt; 0.01). An interesting but puzzling difference also was observed in the cooperativity term, as measured by the Hill coefficient (h = 2.49 \u00b1 0.02 vs 1.96 \u00b1 0.40, p &lt; 0.05). For human Crm1, the Hill coefficient exceeded the dimeric stoichiometry of the complex, which\u2014while unusual\u2014is not unprecedented (<a href=\"#bib4\">Atkinson, 1966</a>). As an initial interpretation, we considered that the Hill coefficient of two with murine Crm1 reflected the stoichiometry of the complex while the higher value with human Crm1 might also include an additional component of cooperativity resulting from the arrangement of the Crm1 dimer. Overall, the result of these small differences between the human and murine proteins is comparable to the fourfold enhancement in nuclear export activity seen when human Crm1 is expressed in murine cells (<a href=\"#bib52\">Sherer et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Elinav et al., 2012</a>)."

This model has typically been used to analyze protein binding to DNA sites, which may resemble how Crm1 binds to the array of NES peptides in the Rev-RRE complex. According to this model, the affinity between the ligand and each binding site (K<sub>d</sub>) would describe Crm1 binding to one Rev NES, the number of binding sites that a large ligand occludes (n) would reflect the number of Rev sites Crm1 obscures due to its large size, and cooperativity between ligands (\u03c9) would be reflected by \u03c9 &gt; 1, indicating an interaction between Crm1 monomers (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). In this model, human and murine Crm1 both have similar affinities for an individual NES (K<sub>d</sub> \u2248 6\u20138 \u00b5M) but human Crm1 shows more than 2-fold higher cooperativity (\u03c9 = 27.8 \u00b1 3.4 vs 12.1 \u00b1 3.8, p &lt; 0.01). It is common for \u03c9 values to be quite large if complexes have extensive protein\u2013protein interfaces, such as the binding of RecA filaments to DNA, with \u03c9 \u2248 50 (<a href=\"#bib41\">Menetski and Kowalczykowski, 1985</a>). The relative \u03c9 values for Crm1 suggest a tighter interaction between the human Crm1 monomers, but the absolute value of \u03c9 &gt; 1 for murine Crm1 still suggests some interaction between monomers. Indeed, murine Crm1 complexes with Rev-RRE elute from size-exclusion columns with an even larger apparent size than with human Crm1 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>) and display a different, elongated, hour-glass shape in class averages of negatively-stained particles (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>), suggesting that these differences in the dimer complexes may reflect observed differences in Rev-RRE binding and export activities. Both human and murine Crm1 occlude three binding sites (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>), consistent with the stoichiometry of a Rev hexamer harboring six NESs binding to only a dimer of Crm1 (<a href=\"#bib13\">Daugherty et al., 2010b</a>). These binding analyses also suggest that the Crm1 dimer interface helps promote cooperative assembly of the complex. The stabilization of the Rev-RRE export complex imparted by the human Crm1 dimer interface may explain how human Crm1 enhances oligomerization of a Rev-like protein from Human T-cell Leukemia Virus-1 (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hakata et al., 2003</a>) or why it enhances the nuclear export activity of Rev for other lentiviruses, such as feline immunodeficiency virus (<a href=\"#bib17\">Elinav et al., 2012</a>)."

For example, murine Crm1, with apparently weak or no interaction between Crm1 monomers, still binds the Rev-RRE complex with an order of magnitude greater affinity than to a single NES (K<sub>1/2</sub> = 450 nM vs K<sub>d</sub> = 5910 nM). This result may indicate that the increased local concentration of NESs in the Rev-RRE complex enhances Crm1 binding and is consistent with our observations in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a> where the RRE was required for Rev to strongly bind Crm1. Furthermore, a recent study has shown that increasing the local concentration of NESs in the Rev-RRE complex by appending additional NESs to Rev overcomes the defect in murine Crm1 (<a href=\"#bib1\">Aligeti et al., 2014</a>). Overall, the combined contributions from the RRE scaffolding the Rev oligomer and the interaction between Crm1 monomers cooperatively assemble the whole complex for nuclear export and may strongly influence the disassembly of the particle in the cytoplasm to regulate downstream steps for translating viral proteins and virion assembly (<a href=\"#bib56\">Yedavalli et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Nagai-Fukataki et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Elinav et al., 2012</a>)."

If the RRE stabilizes distinct conformations of the Rev oligomer (<a href=\"#bib31\">Jayaraman et al., 2014</a>), then the volume occupied by the Rev NES in those different states could influence the affinity for the Crm1 dimer.

This work proposed an intriguing evolutionary path for Crm1 starting from an ancestral sequence that lacked the full set of residues that we now know form the Crm1 dimer interface. The simian primate lineage might have acquired mutations that stabilize the interface, whereas the murine lineage might have accrued mutations that destabilize the interface. Even though mouse Crm1 lacks the residues to fully stabilize the Crm1 dimer, the Rev-RRE complex can still recruit two Crm1 subunits, which presumably accounts for its partial function in Rev-mediated export. Thus, Rev oligomerization scaffolded by the RRE may have initially allowed ancestral viruses to recruit two Crm1 subunits even if an ancestral form of Crm1 did not have a dimeric interface. The oligomerization of Rev-like proteins in other retroviruses may similarly facilitate binding to existing Crm1 orthologs that lack the dimeric interface. The selective pressures that fixed the dimer interface in the simian primate lineage are unknown, but its evolution has certainly provided an advantage for HIV replication."

However, it seems more likely that the Crm1 dimer plays some role in host cell biology. Previous studies have implicated the same species-specific Crm1 residues as important for binding to RanBP3, a protein that enhances interactions of Crm1 with Ran<sup>GTP</sup> and some NESs, although it is not known if a Crm1 dimer is involved (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hakata et al., 2003</a>). Alternatively, Crm1 dimerization may modulate levels of nuclear export for host mRNAs. Crm1 mediates export of a small set of mRNAs via proteins bound near their 3\u2032 ends (<a href=\"#bib9\">Brennan et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Yang et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Culjkovic et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Prechtel et al., 2006</a>). One of these proteins, HuR, even forms an oligomeric complex at its 3\u2032 RNA element (<a href=\"#bib23\">Fialcowitz-White et al., 2007</a>). Perhaps analogous to the Rev, the HuR oligomer may also bind a Crm1 dimer. Moreover, the positioning of cis-acting elements within a cellular mRNA may define a topology for RNA-binding proteins to recruit a Crm1 dimer without homooligomeric assemblies of proteins. Such a mechanism would allow Crm1-mediated export to integrate different protein signals to tune the levels of nuclear export for a given mRNA."

At these concentrations, Rev-RRE completely assembles with Crm1 and Ran<sup>Q69L</sup> but disassembles through dilution on the column, as supported by native gel electrophoresis (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). The assembly reactions were incubated at 37\u00b0C, filtered through a 0.22 \u00b5m centrifugal filter (EMD Millipore), and then kept on ice. A Shodex KW-804 (Showa Denko America, New York, NY) column equilibrated in buffer G was loaded with 50 \u00b5l of assembly reaction. Complexes were separated at a flow rate of 0.35 ml/min, and the 12.5 ml column volume was collected in 135 \u00b5l fractions. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE as for in vitro pulldowns. Molecular masses were determined using the program ASTRA from MALLS and refractometry (Wyatt Technology Corp, Santa Barbara, CA) measurements following size-exclusion chromatography. For these experiments, the concentration of Rev-RRE was increased to 8 \u00b5M for accurate mass determination. The masses of Crm1 and Ran<sup>Q69L</sup> were determined at 20 \u00b5M and 50 \u00b5M, respectively. Because the technical error of measuring the mass of the nuclear export particle was nearly the same as a Rev monomer, we validated the stoichiometry by densitometry of SDS-PAGE gels stained with Sypro-Ruby scanned on a Typhoon (GE Healthcare Lifesciences) and quantified with ImageQuant. Concentrations for standards of each protein were determined by amino-acid analysis (UC-Davis Proteomics Facility, Davis, CA)."

Particles from untilted negative-stain and cryo-images were subjected to reference free classification followed by multiple rounds of correspondence analysis, k-means classification, and multi-reference alignment using SPIDER (<a href=\"#bib51\">Shaikh et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Liao et al., 2013</a>)."

                                "text": "For each class average of untilted images, we calculated a random conical tilt (RCT) reconstruction from tilted particles with angular parameters from the in plane rotation of class averages and from the tilt angle determined during particle picking. This initial RCT reconstruction was first refined for translational alignment of individual particles. Images of untilted particles were then added to the reconstructions followed by translational alignment. All refinements were performed using FREALIGN (<a href=\"#bib27\">Grigorieff, 2007</a>) in a frequency-limited range of 240\u201338 \u00c5. Volumes were low-pass filtered after each cycle of refinement using the FCREF option. When we compared RCT reconstructions using UCSF Chimera, we concluded the first five classes were different views of the same structure and the remaining two classes were substoichiometric particles (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Untitled and tilted particles from the first five classes were merged into a single dataset for further projection matching refinement. The RCT reconstruction from Class02 was used as an initial model to determine Euler angles and in-plane shifts of all particles. In the subsequent iterative refinement, the frequency was limited between 240 \u00c5 and 34 \u00c5. The final resolution was estimated to be 25 \u00c5 (FSC = 0.143) to 30 \u00c5 (FSC = 0.5) (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The Euler angle distribution of all particles suggests there is no major gap in Euler space. A b-factor of \u22121000 \u00c5<sup>2</sup> with a cosine-edge, low-pass filter to 25 \u00c5 and a 2-pixel width was applied to the final volume using b-factor (N. Grigorieff). We also tested applying C2 symmetry during the refinement and reconstruction. Symmetry improves the resolution of the overall reconstruction but weakens the features from Rev-RRE. We, therefore, only interpreted the volume with no symmetry applied."

In order to find the difference density for Rev-RRE, the hybrid model of the Crm1 dimer crystal structure (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) filtered to 25 \u00c5 resolution was used to mask out Crm1 and Ran density in the EM reconstruction using the \u2018mask\u2019 command in Chimera."

The authors clearly demonstrate that all of these components are required for efficient complex formation and they use a mutant Rev to show that the necessary interaction between Crm1 and Rev NES is indeed taking place. They then go on to present the surprising, but compelling argument that there are two copies of hCrm1 in the complex, rather than the expected single copy, even though Crm1 is monomeric in solution. The presence of a Crm1 dimer is shown both biochemically and by EM. In the EM work, a nominal \u223c30 \u00c5 resolution reconstruction is generated by negative-stain single-particle electron microscopy, using the random conical tilt method to achieve a suitable distribution of viewing angles. The authors can fit a dimer extracted from the lattice of the hCrm1 crystal structure into their reconstruction, even though the intermolecular lattice contact had previously been assumed to be a crystallization artifact. Nicely, the human Crm1 dimer interface also appears to explain, at least in part, why HIV-1 Rev uses human Crm1 better than murine Crm1 (where the dimer interface is missing). The RRE-Rev complex binds more tightly and with greater cooperativity to the human Crm1-RanGTP complex vs. the murine complex (although the differences are modest), and residues that appear to dictate the species specificity of HIV-1 Rev map to the hCrm1 crystallographic dimer interface. Finally, the authors propose a model for the overall architecture of the HIV-1 export complex and posit that the spacing between the Rev binding sites on the Crm1 dimer are optimally distanced to recognized the C-terminal tails of the two terminal Revs in a hexameric complex."

Although Crm1 has been previously characterized as binding other export cargoes as a monomer, the authors argue that Rev-RRE stabilizes the formation of a Crm1 dimer and that the dimer requirement reflects the greater size of this export cargo. The basic observations presented in this paper are an important advance in thinking about the Rev-RRE-Crm1 interactions, and how the HIV (and other) export complexes are formed."

Issues limiting the precision of the reconstruction include: 1) The reconstruction is in negative stain and is at low resolution. 2) There seems to be a large amount of density missing from the complex. Even given that RNA does not stain well during negative staining, Rev-GB1 should stain well, and Rev could be seen as four round spheres in a previous reconstruction of Rev in complex with the RRE. The authors cite this paper, but do not compare that structure with the present structure, nor do they clearly state why there would be such a difference between the two (namely the complete lack of Rev-density in the current data). Furthermore, the Rev-RRE subcomplex adds up to about 75 kDa and should show up more strongly in the class averages than it does.

Issues include: 1) A lack of justification for the assumed jellyfish model and Rev stoichiometry in the context of the Crm1:RRE complex. 2) Questions surrounding the Rev subunits whose NES elements do not engage Crm1. The model suggests that six Rev monomers are correctly spaced to allow the terminal Rev monomers to interact with their binding sites on Crm1. However, it is not entirely clear that, based on the data in the accompanying crystal structure of a Rev dimer:RRE complex, the jellyfish model is the appropriate complex to consider. Furthermore, nothing is said of what happens with the intervening four monomeric tails. These would seem to be steric hindrances in the Crm1-Rev interaction, as it is not clear that the space between Rev and Crm-1 would allow nearly 23 kD of unstructured protein mass."

We can reasonably position the Rev oligomer with respect to the Crm1 dimer because the Rev NES bound to Crm1 has a defined orientation that points the amino-terminal end of the NES in the direction of the C-terminal of the Rev oligomer to which NESs connect through a 12 amino acid linker, extending as much as \u223c40 \u00c5.
