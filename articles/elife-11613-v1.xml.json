Here, we investigate genome-wide patterns of DNA methylation and chromatin accessibility in mouse rods and cones and correlate differences in these features with gene expression, histone marks, transcription factor binding, and DNA sequence motifs. Loss of NR2E3 in rods shifts their epigenomes to a more cone-like state. The data further reveal wide differences in DNA methylation between retinal photoreceptors and brain neurons. Surprisingly, we also find a substantial fraction of DNA hypo-methylated regions in adult rods that are not in active chromatin. Many of these regions exhibit hallmarks of regulatory regions that were active earlier in neuronal development, suggesting that these regions could remain undermethylated due to the highly compact chromatin in mature rods. This work defines the epigenomic landscapes of rods and cones, revealing features relevant to photoreceptor development and function."

Here, we investigate genome-wide patterns of DNA methylation and chromatin accessibility in mouse rods and cones and correlate differences in these features with gene expression, histone marks, transcription factor binding, and DNA sequence motifs. Loss of NR2E3 in rods shifts their epigenomes to a more cone-like state. The data further reveal wide differences in DNA methylation between retinal photoreceptors and brain neurons. Surprisingly, we also find a substantial fraction of DNA hypo-methylated regions in adult rods that are not in active chromatin. Many of these regions exhibit hallmarks of regulatory regions that were active earlier in neuronal development, suggesting that these regions could remain undermethylated due to the highly compact chromatin in mature rods. This work defines the epigenomic landscapes of rods and cones, revealing features relevant to photoreceptor development and function."

It originates from the embryonic diencephalon and contains three layers of neurons: an outer nuclear layer with rods and cones; an inner nuclear layer with bipolar, horizontal, and amacrine cells; and a ganglion cell layer (<a href=\"#bib70\">Swaroop et al., 2010</a>). Rods can respond to a single photon and mediate vision in dim light. Cones are less sensitive to light and mediate color vision. Photoreceptor specialization results from well-defined rod- and cone-specific patterns of gene expression (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kefalov, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Siegert et al., 2012</a>), which are in part controlled by retinal transcription factors (TFs) OTX2, CRX, NRL, and NR2E3. In both rods and cones, OTX2 determines photoreceptor cell fate (<a href=\"#bib46\">Nishida et al., 2003</a>), and CRX regulates expression of terminal photoreceptor genes (<a href=\"#bib13\">Furukawa et al., 1997</a>). Rod photoreceptor fate and gene activation are induced by NRL and its downstream target NR2E3 (<a href=\"#bib43\">Mears et al., 2001</a>). Loss of NR2E3 leads to enhanced S-cone syndrome, an autosomal recessive human retinal disease (<a href=\"#bib20\">Haider et al., 2000</a>) that is recapitulated in retinal degeneration 7 (<i>rd7</i>) mice (<a href=\"#bib21\">Haider et al., 2001</a>). <i>rd7</i> rods show a partial conversion of photoreceptor identity because they retain expression of rod-specific genes but also de-repress a subset of cone-specific genes (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chen et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Corbo and Cepko, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Peng et al., 2005</a>)."

Although these regions are beginning to be defined, current studies have limitations. ChIP-seq can identify TF binding sites but requires high-quality antibodies and can only interrogate one TF at a time. TF binding sites are typically marked by increased chromatin accessibility (<a href=\"#bib71\">Thurman et al., 2012</a>). However, existing datasets measuring chromatin accessibility are limited to whole retina from wild-type mice (<a href=\"#bib73\">Wilken et al., 2015</a>). Because rods make up 70\u201380% of all mouse retinal cells and outnumber cones by 35:1 (<a href=\"#bib26\">Jeon et al., 1998</a>), whole retina studies can approximate features of rods but mask differences between rods and cones that contribute to their unique identities. Therefore, the current understanding of photoreceptor gene regulation also remains limited by the lack of cell type-specific information."

TF binding can result in local regions of low DNA methylation, leading to strong overlaps between regions identified as DNA hypo-methylated and as accessible chromatin. At present, genome-wide, single-base resolution DNA methylation profiles have not been reported for either rods or cones, precluding a large-scale analysis of this phenomenon in either photoreceptor type. Also of interest is the small size of the rod nucleus (~5\u2009\u03bcm; <a href=\"#bib65\">Solovei et al., 2009</a>) and its highly condensed chromatin (<a href=\"#bib29\">Kizilyaprak et al., 2010</a>), which may potentially impact how chromatin accessibility correlates with DNA methylation. In addition, rods are the only known cell type in mice with nuclei that have heterochromatin centers surrounded by peripheral euchromatin (<a href=\"#bib6\">Carter-Dawson and LaVail, 1979</a>). This inverted organization is thought to facilitate nocturnal vision (<a href=\"#bib65\">Solovei et al., 2009</a>). By contrast, cone nuclei are larger and exhibit the conventional arrangement of central euchromatin and peripheral heterochromatin."

Unexpectedly, most rod-specific regions of low DNA methylation are not located in accessible chromatin in adult rods. Instead, our evidence suggests that these regions are potential active regulatory sites in fetal neural tissue and, despite loss of active chromatin marks, remain hypo-methylated in adult rods due to the barrier to cytosine methyltransferases posed by chromatin condensation. In addition, we identify rod- and cone-enriched regions of accessible chromatin that may play gene regulatory functions and carry distinct DNA sequence motifs. Integrated analysis of <i>rd7</i> rods, together with normal rods and cones, shows that NR2E3 function is necessary for rods to gain their complete ensemble of epigenomic features. We further examine epigenomic patterns in retinal photoreceptors versus brain neurons. Overall, our findings highlight both global and local epigenomic differences between retinal rods and cones that reflect unique aspects of their biology."

Furthermore, the WT retina shows lower, but non-zero, levels of accessibility compared to the <i>Nrl KO</i> retina at many ATAC-seq peaks near cone-specific genes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). The analogous result is seen at rod-specific genes, with lower-amplitude <i>Nrl KO</i> retina ATAC-seq signals at sites of higher-amplitude WT retina ATAC-seq peaks. Importantly, low levels of ATAC-seq signals near rod-specific genes in the <i>Nrl KO</i> retina could not have originated from sample contamination by rods. These observations are in line with previous studies showing that rod-specific TFs NR2E3 and NRL bind to regulatory elements near both rod- and cone-specific genes (<a href=\"#bib52\">Peng et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Peng and Chen 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Oh et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Onishi et al., 2009</a>), a phenomenon that presumably reflects a shared photoreceptor identity.

At rod-specific genes (e.g., <i>Nrl, Esrrb, Cnga1), rd7</i> rod methylation levels generally resemble those seen in WT rods or lie midway between WT rods and cones (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C,D</a>; <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>\u2013<a href=\"#fig6s2\">2</a>).

One interpretation of this clustering pattern is that cortical neurons may acquire more extensive\u00a0cell\u00a0type-specific modifications than photoreceptors during their developmental maturation. We therefore defined DMRs across all retinal and cortical samples and found twice as many regions that showed hypo-methylation only in retinal photoreceptors (63384) compared to those that showed hypo-methylation only in cortical neurons (31483; <a href=\"#fig8s2\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 2</a>, <a href=\"#SD4-data\">Supplementary file 4</a>).

First, rods have relatively fewer regions of high chromatin accessibility, and on average, rod-enriched accessible chromatin sites are located closer to promoters. Second, rods have more un-methylated and low-methylated regions compared to cones. Third, compared with cone hypo-DMRs, rod hypo-DMRs are located at greater distances from the TSS and show seven-fold lower overlap with ATAC-seq peaks. Furthermore, rod hypo-DMRs are enriched for regions that are both hypo-methylated and marked by active histone modifications in fetal neural tissue. These findings suggest that many hypo-methylated regions in rods may mark previously active fetal enhancers that have retained their hypo-methylation despite loss of enhancer activity (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>). Such regions have previously been described as vestigial enhancers (<a href=\"#bib24\">Hon et al., 2013</a>), but the factors that contribute to continuing hypo-methylation and to variation in the number of vestigial enhancers across different cell types remained unclear."

Mouse rod nuclei are exceptionally small, and increased chromatin condensation in rods could potentially pose a barrier to DNA methylation by limiting the accessibility of DNA methyltransferases. In support of this hypothesis, we find that <i>rd7</i> rods, a hybrid rod/cone cell with slightly increased nuclear size and lower levels of chromatin condensation compared to rods (<a href=\"#bib8\">Corbo and Cepko, 2005</a>), show higher levels of DNA methylation at putative rod vestigial enhancers. <i>rd7</i> rods also show intermediate levels of mCH relative to normal rods and cones. A previous study showed that dense heterochromatin regions surrounding immunoglobulins or olfactory receptor clusters in brain neurons coincide with regions of low mCH (<a href=\"#bib40\">Lister et al., 2013</a>), consistent with the idea that the highly condensed chromatin in rods could be a global limiting factor to mCH accumulation. Taken together, our results suggest that high chromatin compaction could provide a unifying explanation of some of the unique epigenomic features of rod photoreceptors. These observations may be relevant to other cell types with different nuclear sizes and extents of chromatin condensation. For example, cells in the oligodendrocyte lineage undergo chromatin compaction as they progress from progenitors to mature myelinating oligodendrocytes (<a href=\"#bib61\">Shen et al., 2005</a>)."

In contrast, in mature rods, fetal-only enhancers lose H3K27ac and H3K4me1 but the DNA remains unmethylated, potentially due to the barrier to cytosine methyltransferases posed by their high level of chromatin condensation.

In this landscape, a ball rolls down a succession of narrowing valleys. The ball represents a differentiating cell traveling along a trajectory that leads to a progressively restricted fate. Our finding that rods show fewer accessible chromatin regions than cones suggests that, at the epigenomic level, a rod could represent a more developmentally restricted cell type than a cone. This idea is consistent with current models of photoreceptor genesis, which propose that NRL, perhaps in combination with NR2E3, is necessary to direct photoreceptor precursors to turn off the default S-cone fate and differentiate along the rod lineage (<a href=\"#bib70\">Swaroop et al., 2010</a>)."

In contrast to brain homogenates, which consisted predominantly of singlet nuclei, retinal homogenates showed a mixture of singlet, doublet, and higher order nuclear aggregates.

If a construct showed enhancer activity in either WT retina or <i>Nrl KO</i> retina, enhancer strength was quantified by counting the number of TdT+ nuclei that were also positive for GFP signal. For each construct and genotype (i.e., WT or <i>Nrl KO</i>), over 100 nuclei were counted across three experimental replicates, except for the <i>Opn1sw</i> -1 bp construct in WT retina, where only two replicates were used."

This appears to be the first study of this kind. The authors perform comprehensive epigenomic profiling separately integrating ATAC-seq, DNA methylation, RNA-seq and histone modifications. A main result is the unusual pattern specific for rods of unmethylated reigons in closed chromatin and without enhancer activity, but with enhancer activity at a prior stage (fetal). This idea is not entirely novel as it has previously been called vestigial enhancers. The computational analyses are standard except for the use of a new Motif tool (MotifSpec) which is to be described elsewhere (though the advantage of the tool relative to what is available is unknown)."

The extent of enhancer analysis is not up to what can be done to go beyond mere description. In weighing strengths and weaknesses for <i>eLife</i> publication here one has to balance the overall quality of the descriptive data with the relative lack of really new insights into epigenetics and function. Frankly I am on the fence as to whether this manuscript meets criteria for <i>eLife</i> or its more suitable for a genomics journal. The datasets will be useful to workers in the field but probably not more widely."

Although the work is a bit less mechanistic than would be desired, the vast array of data and comprehensive, broad spanning nature of the work makes this a strong manuscript, suitable for publication in <i>eLife</i>. The focus on NR2E3 loss is quite interesting and impactful; it would have been great if they could identify additional combinations of genes which (when lost/modified) promote the cone-like state to a greater extent/achieve more complete conversion.

It is also only the second report of such a comparison between purified neuronal cell types, the first report being our Neuron paper earlier this year describing that comparison for subsets of cortical neurons. Additionally, the present manuscript pushes the purification, methylome sequencing, and chromatin accessibility technologies to a new level by targeting a cell type (cones) that is rarer than any cell type to which these methods have yet been applied. The high quality datasets that we have generated, the extensive computational analyses that we have performed, the whole genome nature of the insights derived from those analyses, and the surprising differences that we have uncovered between rod and cone epigenomes, all set the present study apart from everything else in the scientific literature on sensory receptor cells."
