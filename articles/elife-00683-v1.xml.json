Nodal-related signaling factors are required for axis formation and germ layer specification from sea urchins to mammals. Maternal transcripts of the zebrafish Nodal factor, Squint (Sqt), are localized to future embryonic dorsal. The mechanisms by which maternal sqt/nodal RNA is localized and regulated have been unclear. Here, we show that maternal control of Nodal signaling via the conserved Y box-binding protein 1 (Ybx1) is essential. We identified Ybx1 via a proteomic screen. Ybx1 recognizes the 3\u2019 untranslated region (UTR) of sqt RNA and prevents premature translation and Sqt/Nodal signaling. Maternal-effect mutations in zebrafish <i>ybx1</i> lead to deregulated Nodal signaling, gastrulation failure, and embryonic lethality. Implanted Nodal-coated beads phenocopy <i>ybx1</i> mutant defects. Thus, Ybx1 prevents ectopic Nodal activity, revealing a new paradigm in the regulation of Nodal signaling, which is likely to be conserved."

Nodal-related signaling factors are required for axis formation and germ layer specification from sea urchins to mammals. Maternal transcripts of the zebrafish Nodal factor, Squint (Sqt), are localized to future embryonic dorsal. The mechanisms by which maternal sqt/nodal RNA is localized and regulated have been unclear. Here, we show that maternal control of Nodal signaling via the conserved Y box-binding protein 1 (Ybx1) is essential. We identified Ybx1 via a proteomic screen. Ybx1 recognizes the 3\u2019 untranslated region (UTR) of sqt RNA and prevents premature translation and Sqt/Nodal signaling. Maternal-effect mutations in zebrafish <i>ybx1</i> lead to deregulated Nodal signaling, gastrulation failure, and embryonic lethality. Implanted Nodal-coated beads phenocopy <i>ybx1</i> mutant defects. Thus, Ybx1 prevents ectopic Nodal activity, revealing a new paradigm in the regulation of Nodal signaling, which is likely to be conserved."

Strikingly, embryos formed abnormally when their maternally derived Ybx1 protein was mutant, and these mutations also prevented the squint RNA from localizing properly. This suggests that maternally derived Ybx1 protein directly regulates the squint RNA."

Indeed, Kumari et al. found that Ybx1 binds to another protein\u2014eIF4E\u2014that recruits mRNAs to the ribosome (the cell\u2019s translational machinery). Ybx1 might therefore prevent eIF4E from associating with other components of the ribosomal complex, and initiating the translation of the squint RNA, until additional signals have been received. It will be interesting to determine how widespread this regulatory mechanism is in other organisms."

RNA localization is an important mechanism that generates asymmetry in cells and organisms. For example, bicoid RNA localization in <i>Drosophila</i> oocytes and embryos is required for specification of anterior cell fates, and localization of maternal pem-1 and macho-1 RNAs determines the posterior end of ascidian embryos (<a href=\"#bib53\">Nishida and Sawada, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Sardet et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">St Johnston and N\u00fcsslein-Volhard, 1992</a>). Mechanisms to ensure correct transport of the RNA and inhibition of translation until the RNA reaches its destination are essential for this process (<a href=\"#bib32\">Johnstone and Lasko, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Martin and Ephrussi, 2009</a>). In addition, translational control is an important step for regulation of some RNAs. For instance, a proportion of maternal nanos RNA is uniformly distributed in the cytoplasm of <i>Drosophila</i> embryos but is not translated, and Nanos protein is only synthesized from localized nanos RNA at the posterior pole (<a href=\"#bib20\">Gavis and Lehmann, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Smibert et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bergsten and Gavis, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Crucs et al., 2000</a>). In zebrafish embryos, transport of maternal sqt/nodal RNA to future dorsal is dependent on the microtubule cytoskeleton (<a href=\"#bib23\">Gore et al., 2005</a>).

Genetic analysis of <i>ybx1</i> mutants shows that maternal Ybx1 function is essential for embryonic development. Loss of Ybx1 function causes mis-localization of sqt RNA and precocious Sqt protein translation, leading to premature and uncontrolled Nodal signaling, and embryonic lethality. Thus, maternal Ybx1 is required for translational control of Nodal signaling. Since the 3\u2032UTR of mammalian nodal RNAs can localize in fish embryos, it is likely that this control mechanism of translational repression is conserved. Our results identify a new mode of regulation of Nodal signaling, and highlight the role of maternal factors in regulation of growth factor signaling and cell-type specification in vertebrates."

To identify the proteins that specifically recognize the DLE, 100-nucleotide long radioactive probes spanning the sqt 3\u2032UTR were used for RNA gel-shift assays with zebrafish whole embryo extracts (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>). We observed a number of binding activities in gel-shift assays with sqt probes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>).

To precisely map the SRBF1 binding site, a 10-nucleotide sqt1 deletion series was tested for binding. Whereas deletions in the coding sequence did not affect SRBF1 binding, deletions 1\u20134 (\u03941\u2013\u03944, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,E</a>) abolish, or significantly reduce binding to the sqt1 probe.

Therefore, to confirm if Ybx1 is SRBF1, <i>ybx1</i> cDNA sequences were cloned, and recombinant Ybx1 (rYbx1) was tested for sqt DLE-binding in gel-shift assays. Embryonic SRBF1 and rYbx1 bind to sense sqt1 RNA, but not to control gapdh, or to antisense sqt1 probes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). Control <i>Escherichia coli</i> lysate did not bind to sqt1 or gapdh probes, and recombinant zebrafish Lin28A, that also contains a cold shock domain (<a href=\"#bib46\">Moss et al., 1997</a>), did not bind the sqt DLE (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). Semi-quantitative competition gel-shift assays show that embryonic SRBF1 and rYbx1 bind to sqt DLE sequences with the same specificity (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). However, rYbx1 does not bind to the UTRs of other localized RNAs, such as vg1 and wnt8a (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>). To determine if Ybx1 forms protein\u2013RNA complexes in vivo with sqt RNA, we performed RNA-immunoprecipitation (RNA-IP) with embryo lysates, and RT-PCR to detect sqt. RNA-IP with anti-Ybx1 antibodies shows a sqt product, whereas control (RT-) and RNA-IP using IgG antibodies do not show any product (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). Under the same conditions, gapdh and wnt8a RNA are not detected. Therefore, Ybx1 specifically binds to sqt RNA in early embryos, and has all the characteristics of SRBF1."

Extracts from wild-type embryos were immunoprecipitated with antibodies to Ybx1, eIF4G or eIF4E, followed by western blot, and RT-PCR to detect sqt RNA. Co-immunoprecipitation assays show that Ybx1 interacts with eIF4E but not with eIF4G, and RNA-IP experiments show that sqt RNA is detected in pull-downs with antibodies towards Ybx1, eIF4G and eIF4E. In contrast, gapdh and wnt8a RNA can be detected in RNA-IP with the eIF4G and eIF4E proteins, but not with Ybx1. Hence, Ybx1 binds sqt RNA and the 5\u2032 7-methyl-guanosine cap binding protein eIF4E, but is not found in translation initiation complexes with gapdh and wnt8a RNA (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,D</a>).

Taken together, these results provide evidence for Ybx1 in regulation of sqt translation by binding to the translation initiation machinery and the 3\u2032UTR of sqt RNA."

This raises the question of whether the phenotypes observed in M<i>ybx1</i> mutants are a direct consequence of Sqt/Nodal translation and diffusion from the yolk in the absence of Ybx1 function, or due to other potential effects of Ybx1. To directly determine the effects of excess Nodal protein from the yolk, we implanted Affi-gel beads that were pre-soaked in either control BSA protein or purified mouse Nodal protein, into the yolk of wild-type embryos, and examined YSN (schematic in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). Bead implantation itself did not disrupt morphogenesis or development (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). Control BSA bead-implanted embryos showed 1 tier of YSL (with 4\u20135 nuclei; n = 17, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B,C</a>), similar to wild-type embryos (<a href=\"#bib35\">Kimmel and Law, 1985</a>). By contrast, most Nodal bead-implanted embryos showed more YSN (75%, n = 32 embryos; arrowhead in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B,C</a>). Therefore, Nodal diffusion from the yolk is sufficient for YSL expansion. Nodal bead implantation in the yolk of MZ<i>oep</i> mutant embryos, which cannot respond to Nodal signals (<a href=\"#bib58\">Schier, 2009</a>), did not affect the YSL (0%, n = 13; <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B,C</a>). Thus, excess Nodal signaling from the yolk directly induces premature and expanded extra-embryonic YSL. Similar YSL expansion and gastrulation defects were reported in lefty-1;lefty-2 double-morphants, where Nodal signaling is deregulated in the absence of the Lefty inhibitors (<a href=\"#bib5\">Branford and Yost, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Feldman et al., 2002</a>). Taken together, these results suggest that the M<i>ybx1</i> phenotypes are likely due to precocious, unregulated and elevated Nodal signaling by de-repression of Sqt translation."

To distinguish between these possibilities, we blocked Nodal signaling in M<i>ybx1</i> mutants by two strategies. Firstly, we injected capped mRNA encoding inhibitor Lefty1 into M<i>ybx1</i> embryos to block Nodal signaling. Injections in control P<i>ybx1</i> embryos were used to assess the efficacy of the RNA. Immunostaining with antibodies to detect E-cadherin in cell membranes and DAPI staining to detect nuclei show that that the expanded YSL phenotype in M<i>ybx1</i> embryos is suppressed by injection of lefty1 RNA, but not with lacZ RNA (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). The margin between the blastoderm and YSL, which is not clearly demarcated in M<i>ybx1</i> embryos, is restored upon injection of lefty1 RNA (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). The majority of M<i>ybx1</i> mutant embryos injected with lacZ RNA fail to initiate gastrulation and none complete gastrulation. In contrast, more than 50% of mutant embryos injected with lefty1 RNA initiate epiboly movements and of these, \u223c80% complete gastrulation, and survive till prim5 stages (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>).

It is possible that other regions of Ybx1 than the CSD, and other factors in the Ybx1\u2013RNP complex confer specificity to the interactions. Such context-dependent specificity has been observed for many transcription factor complexes and other RNA-binding proteins as well. For example, a bipartite RNA recognition module in Lin28 (which contains a CSD) binds to two distinct regions of let-7 RNA to regulate its biogenesis, and two distinct RNA-binding domains in fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), recognize distinct RNA elements (<a href=\"#bib72\">Tong et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Nam et al., 2011</a>). In support of this possibility, we find that in addition to the residues in the CSD, the DD, RNP and ssDBD domains of Ybx1 are also required for binding to sqt RNA, and likely confer specificity to the interactions. By contrast, the CSD-containing Lin28 protein does not bind to the sqt DLE. Furthermore, the <i>ybx1</i><sup><i>sg8</i></sup> mutation, which deletes the Ybx1 C-terminus, which is thought to be a protein interaction domain (<a href=\"#bib78\">Wolffe, 1994</a>), results in more severe phenotypes and earlier lethality than <i>ybx1</i><sup><i>sa42</i></sup>.

Maternal sqt RNA is largely non-polyadenylated at early cleavage stages, and polyA-containing sqt RNA is normally detected from the 16-cell stage (<a href=\"#bib37\">Lim et al., 2012</a>). In M<i>ybx1</i> embryos, polyA-sqt RNA is detected even at the 1-cell stage, indicating premature polyadenylation. Regulating the length of the polyA tail is known to mediate translational control of the RNA; for example, cyclin A RNA is stored in <i>Drosophila</i> oocytes with short polyA tails (<a href=\"#bib45\">Morris et al., 2005</a>). Ybx1 interacts with the translation initiation factor eIF4E and the sqt 3\u2032UTR. Interactions of 3\u2032UTR binding proteins with translation initiation factors, such as the CPEB-Maskin-eIF4E complex, has been shown in translational control of maternal RNAs in <i>Xenopus</i> oocytes. Maskin binds the cap-binding factor eIF4E, and prevents interactions between eIF4G and eIF4E, which is required for recruitment of the 40S ribosome subunit to the 5\u2032end of mRNAs, and thereby represses translation (<a href=\"#bib6\">Cao and Richter, 2002</a>). Similarly, in <i>Drosophila</i> oocytes, cup binds eIF4E and Bruno to regulate oskar RNA translation (<a href=\"#bib48\">Nakamura et al., 2004</a>). Mammalian YB1 prevents eIF4G from binding to eIF4E, and blocks initiation of translation (<a href=\"#bib51\">Nekrasov et al., 2003</a>). Binding of Ybx1 to the sqt 3\u2032UTR and eIF4E likely prevents eIF4G and eIF4E complex formation, and in M<i>ybx1</i> mutants, in the absence of Ybx1 function, Sqt translation occurs precociously. Thus, Ybx1 binding to the translation initiation factors and the sqt 3\u2032UTR can lead to translational repression of sqt RNA."

Surprisingly, the Nodal target <i>lefty2</i> is not detected in mutant embryos. Therefore, <i>lefty2</i> expression requires factors or inputs that are missing in M<i>ybx1</i>. The lack of feedback inhibition in the absence of Lefty2 together with elevated Sqt/Nodal levels likely exacerbates deregulated Nodal signaling in M<i>ybx1</i>. The YSL expansion and gastrulation defects in M<i>ybx1</i> mutants can be rescued by blocking Nodal signaling via lefty overexpression or by using the <i>sqt</i><sup><i>cz35</i></sup> genetic background that lacks the signaling functions of Sqt, indicating that these phenotypes arise from excess Nodal signaling. Interestingly, M<i>ybx1;</i>Z<i>sqt</i> compound mutant embryos are similar to <i>cyc;sqt</i> double mutants (<a href=\"#bib19\">Feldman et al., 1998</a>), suggesting that maternal Ybx1 may have additional functions in regulation of Nodal signaling. We also found that Wnt signaling targets are not induced in M<i>ybx1</i> mutants, where wnt8a RNA localization and Wnt8a-GFP protein expression are normal, but maternal sqt RNA is mis-localized. Therefore, the response to the maternal Wnt signal requires dorsal localization of maternal sqt RNA. This supports our previous findings, where over-expression of localized non-coding sqt RNA increased dorsal \u03b2-Catenin nuclei numbers and elevated Wnt target gene expression, and mis-localization of sqt RNA by morpholinos that also block Sqt translation resulted in loss of dorsal \u03b2-Catenin accumulation (<a href=\"#bib37\">Lim et al., 2012</a>)."

This was surprising since mammalian embryos are thought to undergo regulative development. Moreover, Nodal RNA is not localized in early mouse embryos (<a href=\"#bib55\">Robertson et al., 2003</a>; Cheong and Sampath, unpublished observations). Ybx1 binds the DLE, and regulates localization and translation of sqt. The sqt DLE, therefore, encompasses a localization and translational control element. This suggests that the mammalian NODAL 3\u2032UTR may also harbor a translational control module. Our finding that maternal sqt/nodal must be translationally repressed, and that deregulated maternal Nodal signaling is catastrophic, shows that this is an essential control mechanism. Translational control is a new paradigm in regulation of this pathway. It will be interesting to see if this mechanism regulates Nodal signaling in other organisms or biological processes. Since human NODAL and ALK7 receptors are expressed in the ovary and placenta, and elevated NODAL is associated with pre-eclamptic placentas (<a href=\"#bib47\">Nadeem et al., 2011</a>), precise regulation of maternal Nodal signaling is likely to be important for human placentation. Moreover, uncontrolled and deregulated Nodal signaling has been associated with metastasizing tumors, underscoring the importance of precise and timely regulation of Nodal signaling. Finally, Nodal signaling is essential for maintaining stem cell pluripotency, and current methods to generate and maintain embryonic stem cell (ESC) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) rely upon transcription factors. Our finding that Nodal signaling is maternally regulated by translational repression could allow modulation of these important therapeutic cells by this new mechanism."

The <i>ybx1</i><sup><i>sg8</i></sup> allele used in this study has a 5-nucleotide deletion in exon 5 of <i>ybx1</i>, which leads to a frame-shift after amino acid 197 and premature termination after amino acid 205."
