Despite this well-established role in the control of developmental processes in roots, the root cap\u2019s function in nutrition remains obscure. Here, we uncover its role in phosphate nutrition by targeted cellular inactivation or phosphate transport complementation in <i>Arabidopsis</i>, using a transactivation strategy with an innovative high-resolution real-time <sup>33</sup>P imaging technique. Remarkably, the diminutive size of the root cap cells at the root-to-soil exchange surface accounts for a significant amount of the total seedling phosphate uptake (approximately 20%). This level of Pi absorption is sufficient for shoot biomass production (up to a 180% gain in soil), as well as repression of Pi starvation-induced genes. These results extend our understanding of this important tissue from its previously described roles in environmental perception to novel functions in mineral nutrition and homeostasis control."

Despite this well-established role in the control of developmental processes in roots, the root cap\u2019s function in nutrition remains obscure. Here, we uncover its role in phosphate nutrition by targeted cellular inactivation or phosphate transport complementation in <i>Arabidopsis</i>, using a transactivation strategy with an innovative high-resolution real-time <sup>33</sup>P imaging technique. Remarkably, the diminutive size of the root cap cells at the root-to-soil exchange surface accounts for a significant amount of the total seedling phosphate uptake (approximately 20%). This level of Pi absorption is sufficient for shoot biomass production (up to a 180% gain in soil), as well as repression of Pi starvation-induced genes. These results extend our understanding of this important tissue from its previously described roles in environmental perception to novel functions in mineral nutrition and homeostasis control."

As the root tip can accumulate high amounts of phosphate in order to sustain its own activity, it was important to distinguish uptake of phosphate from the environment from redistribution of phosphate already within the plant. Kanno, Arrighi et al. tackled this issue through the development of a new radioactive micro-imaging technique."

Following the invention of the compound microscope, pioneering descriptions of plant tissues in the seventeenth century by Marcello Malpighi (<a href=\"#bib23\">Malpighi, 1675</a>) and Nehemiah Grew (<a href=\"#bib14\">Grew, 1682</a>) established the bases of plant anatomy. Although both authors drew a connection between plant nutrition and distinct anatomical location, Malpighi proposed the root hairs whereas Grew proposed the root cap, at the distal end of the root tip. Our understanding of the spatial localization of plant nutrition has undergone great advances in the past twenty-five years. Combined efforts in molecular biology, genetics, biochemistry and electrophysiology have identified several key aspects to ion uptake, with a central role for plasma membrane (PM) ion transporters in this process. These transporters often belong to broad multigenic families (a likely consequence of their vital role) with overlapping expression patterns (<a href=\"#bib28\">Nussaume et al., 2011</a>). However, this high redundancy has held back their genetic study to some degree, preventing analysis of ion uptake contribution at specific root localities."

                        "text": "The uptake of phosphate (Pi), an essential plant macronutrient, relies on a family of nine high-affinity transporters, identified as PHT1 in the plant model <i>Arabidopsis</i> (<a href=\"#bib28\">Nussaume et al., 2011</a>). Mineral nutrition is classically associated with the root epidermis, and the various PHT1 members were identified within this cell layer (<a href=\"#bib26\">Mudge et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Karthikeyan et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Misson et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Nussaume et al., 2011</a>). These transporters are particularly abundant where hair cells develop (<a href=\"#bib10\">Daram et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Brady et al., 2007</a>), as this increases the surface area in contact with the environment and improves nutrient uptake (<a href=\"#bib29\">Peret et al., 2011</a>). Transcriptomic analyses of specific root cell layers (<a href=\"#bib5\">Birnbaum et al., 2003</a>) and analysis of the PHT1 expression pattern has revealed the accumulation of these transporters in the root tip (<a href=\"#bib26\">Mudge et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Karthikeyan et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Misson et al., 2004</a>). Nevertheless, determining how PHT1 proteins contribute to Pi uptake at the root tip is difficult, particularly since this area contains the primary root meristem. This tissue, which is essential for root growth, generates new cells that require Pi and its accumulation to build essential components including nucleic acids, ATP, and phospholipids. Consequently, this complicates differentiating Pi uptake from the Pi translocation (from epidermis) necessary to sustain active cell division in the root tip. Our approach to overcome this problem employs a recently developed high-resolution live radioisotope micro-imaging system (<a href=\"#bib16\">Kanno et al., 2012</a>) combined with targeted cell ablation or complementation by genetic manipulation. These findings establish the importance of the root cap in phosphate uptake and homeostasis."

Both transporters are observed in the root tip (primarily in the root cap), where they are expressed at the transcriptional and protein levels (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) with PHF1, a crucial component facilitating PHT1 post-translational regulation and its targeting to the PM (<a href=\"#bib13\">Gonzalez et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bayle et al., 2011</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>).

Previously, this was achieved by introducing a diphtheria toxin A-chain gene driven by a root cap promoter (<a href=\"#bib41\">Tsugeki and Fedoroff, 1999</a>). However, due to the essential functions of the root cap in several physiological processes, these plants exhibited roots with abnormal differentiation and very poor growth rate. Therefore, we employed a conditional approach using the negative marker <i>FCY</i> (cytosine deaminase; <a href=\"#bib35\">Stougaard, 1993</a>) coupled with uracil phosphoribosyltransferase (<i>UPP</i>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Tiraby et al., 1998</a>). These enzymes convert the innocuous 5-fluorocytosine (5FC) to cytotoxic 5-fluorouracil and 5-fluoroUMP (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>), which stop cellular activities. Genes encoding a <i>FCY-UPP</i> fusion were specifically expressed in root cap cells using the Arabidopsis GAL4/UAS binary expression system (<a href=\"#bib20\">Laplaze et al., 2005</a>). The <i>FCY-UPP</i> construct under control of a UAS promoter was introduced in a GAL4 line (Q0171) selected for its specific root cap expression. This line also expresses GFP under the control of a UAS promoter (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), for visualizing tissues in which the transactivation took place (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). As expected, a five-day treatment with 5FC drastically reduced the expression of GFP in the root cap (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>); the low GFP signal may result from high GFP protein stability or low residual expression. Root tip cell viability was not affected, as revealed by propidium iodide staining (PI; <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). In living cells, PI staining is restricted to the cell wall (as in the non-control plants), whereas it is localized to nuclei in dead tissues, as in the heat-shocked WT control (see inserts in <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

We used a PHF1 mutant (<i>phf1-1</i>) to circumvent this obstacle, as this mutation strongly reduces PHT1 accumulation in the PM, resulting in a 70\u201380% reduction in Pi uptake (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bayle et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Gonzalez et al., 2005</a>). Consequently, the <i>phf1-1</i> mutant exhibits phosphate starvation traits in Pi-rich medium, although its growth is only slightly reduced. This offers an appropriate genetic tool for targeted PHF1 complementation to restore Pi uptake in specific tissues. Using the same GAL4/UAS system described above, we back-crossed the GAL4 enhancer trap driving expression in the root cap (line Q0171) in a <i>phf1-1</i> background. The specific complementation of the root cap was obtained by introducing the UAS-PHF1 construct, producing the <i>phf1</i> Q0171&gt;&gt;PHF1 line. The proper targeting of Pi transporters to the PM in the root tip of resulting plants was confirmed by introducing the fluorescent marker mCherry fused to the <i>PHT1;4</i> gene driven by the constitutive 35S promoter. This produced a strong fluorescent signal in the columella and lateral root cap, where the GFP marker driven by GAL4/UAS was also observed (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). The proper targeting of the PHT1;4-mCherry fusion protein was validated by its colocalization with the PM-specific FM4-64 dye (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). This confirms that an effective restoration of PHT1 targeting in the root cap PM has taken place in the <i>phf1</i> Q0171&gt;&gt;<i>P</i>HF1 line (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A,C</a>). A very low, diffuse fluorescence signal could also be detected in other tissues (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>), corresponding to a previously reported low level of ER-retained protein in the <i>phf1-1</i> mutant (<a href=\"#bib13\">Gonzalez et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bayle et al., 2011</a>). The root cap specificity of the <i>phf1</i> Q0171&gt;&gt;PHF1 complementation therefore provides a unique opportunity to investigate the effect of localized Pi uptake in the root cap with physiological studies."

Then, we investigated the growth of plants on soil exhibiting poor P content (less than 0.1% total P). A nutrient solution specifically depleted of Pi was used to water the samples every day. We observed a significant difference after 6 weeks of development, despite the high variability associated with this kind of experiment (as a result of heterogeneous soil composition). In this case, the gain in biomass of the root cap-complemented line turned out to be even higher, reaching 180% (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>) when compared to the <i>phf1-1</i> mutant. The hydroponics and soil experiments were replicated several times, confirming the significant contribution of Pi uptake through the root tip to plant development."

                                "text": "Previous experiments have revealed that Pi starvation drives major transcriptional regulation in the plant genome (<a href=\"#bib38\">Thibaud et al., 2010</a>). PHT1;4 is a well-established marker, and is highly induced under Pi deficiency (<a href=\"#bib25\">Muchhal et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Misson et al., 2004</a>). To determine its contribution to Pi sensing, we used a translational fusion construct comprising a GUS reporter gene associated with endogenous PHT1;4 (<a href=\"#bib24\">Misson et al., 2004</a>). This marker was present in a previously isolated <i>phf1-2</i> mutant background, and was introduced into diverse enhancer lines (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). As a consequence, the complemented lines (<i>phf1J1092&gt;&gt;</i>PHF1, <i>phf1Q0171&gt;&gt;</i>PHF1 and <i>phf1J0481&gt;&gt;</i>PHF1) lost the strong induction of PHT1;4-GUS expression observed in the <i>phf1-2</i> mutant when Pi is present in the growth medium. This complementation effect was confirmed at the molecular level by analyzing the expression of several Pi starvation markers previously identified in a whole-genome transcriptomic analysis (<a href=\"#bib38\">Thibaud et al., 2010</a>). This approach differentiated systemic and locally responsive genes according to their respective response to internal Pi status or to available Pi present in the growth medium. Most of the markers regulated by external phosphate were not affected, and were observed to react identically in WT, <i>phf1-1</i> and <i>phf1Q0171&gt;&gt;</i>PHF1 backgrounds (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>, <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3A\u2014source data 1</a>). Analysis of the systemically regulated Pi starvation-induced genes revealed a different situation, in which a general repression of these markers occurred after transfer of the WT and <i>phf1Q0171&gt;&gt;</i>PHF1 lines into Pi-rich medium after 2 days (results not shown) or 3 days (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>, <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3B\u2014source data 1</a>). As previously reported (<a href=\"#bib13\">Gonzalez et al., 2005</a>), these systemic markers are strongly induced when the <i>phf1-1</i> mutant line is grown in high Pi (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>), whereas these genes are repressed in the WT. This confirms the result obtained with the GUS reporter gene fused with the systemically regulated PHT1;4 (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). The repression of the systemically regulated genes was partially rescued in the root cap PHF1-complemented line. This repression was equivalent to half the repression observed in the WT. This is not proportional to the additional Pi uptake related to root cap complementation (at least 20%), confirming the existence of a non-proportional relationship between Pi uptake, growth and systemic regulation."

Indeed, the elongation zone (distal to the cap) displays poor Pi absorption despite its essential metabolic activity. Various factors can be proposed to explain this observation. For instance, the fast rate of root growth reduces the period spent by cells in this area by 6 to 7\u2009hr (<a href=\"#bib4\">Beemster and Baskin, 1998</a>), limiting the time allocated to protein production. Additionally, the cell elongation process in this region could contribute to diluting the activity of the produced PHT1 transporters. These features do not affect the root cap, which is located below the elongation and meristematic zones of the root and is composed of cells that are 10 to 20 times smaller than mature epidermis cells (<a href=\"#bib4\">Beemster and Baskin, 1998</a>) and that have low turn-over (<a href=\"#bib12\">Dolan et al., 1993</a>).

Pi mobility is consequently very low, which promotes a Pi-depleted zone around the root as a result of its absorption by plants (<a href=\"#bib16\">Kanno et al., 2012</a>). This suggests that the root cap may provide a temporal advantage to the plant (\u00ab first come, first served \u00bb), as the Pi stock available to the growing root becomes limited.

Indeed for plantlets grown in vitro, a 20% increase in Pi uptake generated a 40% gain in biomass for the root tip-complemented line within 4 days. For mature plants grown for a longer period, this gain increased and could even reach 180% as observed with soil experiments."

This observation is in agreement with previous reports that internal Pi may be involved in Pi homeostasis regulation (<a href=\"#bib21\">Liu et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Lv et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Wang et al., 2014b</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Puga et al., 2014</a>). The transcriptional response was not linearly connected to Pi uptake, since absorption in the root cap of the complemented line restored half of the regulation of Pi starvation systemic markers. As previously shown, this confirms that a small amount of Pi absorbed by the root (at the root tip level, as shown in this study) can regulate gene expression in the whole plant (<a href=\"#bib38\">Thibaud et al., 2010</a>)."

This great manuscript finally shows that the root cap is indeed involved in phosphate uptake, can account for 20% of the phosphate absorbed by the root and can contribute to biomass production. This is enormous given its small surface area in comparison to the root epidermis and root hairs. To demonstrate this, the authors elegantly combine radioactive phosphate pulse labelling with root cap specific enhancer trap-mediated ablation, mutant complementation and gene expression analysis in <i>Arabidopsis</i>. They also show that phosphate accumulates in the root tip of <i>Lotus japonicus</i> and rice, suggesting that phosphate uptake via the root cap is widespread in plants."

Therefore, it would have been better to complement <i>phf1-1</i> with PHF1 in all root except the root cap; in other words the exact opposite experiment than that reported in the paper. In this case if the root cap is indeed important, Pi uptake and plant growth should be reduced in lines which have Pi impaired only in the root cap. This would definitely demonstrate the importance of Pi uptake in the root cap. This could be done using a GAL4 enhancer trap driving expression in all epidermal layers of the root except on the root cap or by expressing and RNAi for PHF1 in the root cap using the Q0171 enhancer trap line."

Indeed, a 20% increase in Pi uptake generated a 40 to 180% gain in biomass for the root tip-complemented line, depending on growth conditions and treatment duration\". It starts with the ion concentration in the medium, but then argues with percent uptake and compares two experiments in which not all compared parameters have been determined. If I understand the manuscript correctly, the 20% increased Pi uptake in the root tip complemented line was determined along with the 40% gain in biomass. The percent Pi uptake in the sand and in the soil experiment was not measured but here only biomass was determined. As it is not clear whether uptake is the same in different growth substrates, I advise against discussing the biomass from the long-term experiments along with the uptake values from the short-term experiment. Furthermore, I would either discuss biomass increase relative to the ion concentration in the medium or to the uptake instead of opening the sentence with one parameter and then talking about the other."
