One important Ena/VASP regulator is the mig-10/Lamellipodin/RIAM family of adaptors that promote lamellipod formation in fibroblasts and drive neurite outgrowth and axon guidance in neurons. To better understand how MRL proteins promote actin network formation we studied the interactions between Lamellipodin (Lpd), actin, and VASP, both in vivo and in vitro. We find that Lpd binds directly to actin filaments and that this interaction regulates its subcellular localization and enhances its effect on VASP polymerase activity. We propose that Lpd delivers Ena/VASP proteins to growing barbed ends and increases their polymerase activity by tethering them to filaments. This interaction represents one more pathway by which growing actin filaments produce positive feedback to control localization and activity of proteins that regulate their assembly."

To start moving, many cells begin assembling actin filaments next to the cell membrane.

However, it was unclear whether Lamellipodin could affect the activity of Ena/VASP proteins or their interaction with the actin filaments. Hansen and Mullins have now analyzed the interactions between Ena/VASP, Lamellipodin and actin. The experiments demonstrate that Lamellipodin does not simply tether Ena/VASP proteins to the membrane but also binds directly to actin filaments, via a binding site that is distinct from the site that contacts Ena/VASP. Further experiments with purified proteins revealed that Lamellipodin could interact with both actin filaments and Ena/VASP proteins at the same time. Hansen and Mullins also found that purified Lamellipodin interacted with VASP proteins to form clustered protein complexes, and that together with the tethering of actin filaments to the membrane, this clustering greatly increased VASP's ability to lengthen actin filaments."

Finally, since Lamellipodin interacts with a multitude of signaling molecules in addition to Ena/VASP proteins, the next big challenge is to understand how Lamellipodin itself is regulated. Future studies could also explore how cells harness the power of the actin cytoskeleton to carry out these essential activities."

The architecture and function of these actin networks is specified in part by the properties of membrane-associated regulatory molecules (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bear et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Lacayo et al., 2007</a>). For example, new filaments are created by nucleation factors recruited to the plasma membrane by Rho-family G-proteins, while fast-growing barbed ends of actin filaments near the membrane interact with regulatory factors that alter the rate and duration of filament elongation. Some factors, including formin-family proteins (<a href=\"#bib55\">Romero et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Kovar et al., 2006</a>) and Enabled/Vasodilator (Ena/VASP stimulated phosphoprotein) proteins (<a href=\"#bib4\">Barzik et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Breitsprecher et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Hansen and Mullins, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Breitsprecher et al., 2011</a>), accelerate filament elongation, while others, such as capping protein, terminate filament elongation (<a href=\"#bib20\">Dinubile et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Kuhn and Pollard, 2007</a>). Local changes in the rates of filament elongation and capping can alter the architecture and function of the actin network and thus tip the balance between membrane protrusion and retraction (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bear et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Applewhite et al., 2007</a>)."

Recruitment of Ena/VASP proteins to the plasma membrane often promotes outgrowth of thin, finger-like filopodia and sometimes promotes rapid advance of broad lamellipodial sheets (<a href=\"#bib39\">Lanier et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Rottner et al., 1999</a>). Little is known about the molecular mechanisms that determine localization and activity of Ena/VASP proteins in vivo, but previous work suggests that a combination of membrane-associated binding partners and free barbed ends work together to recruit and maintain Ena/VASP proteins at the plasma membrane (<a href=\"#bib34\">Krause et al., 2004</a>). Stable localization of Ena/VASP to the plasma membrane requires both the Enabled/VASP homology 1 and 2 domains (EVH1 and EVH2) (<a href=\"#bib43\">Loureiro et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Applewhite et al., 2007</a>). The EVH1 domain is a protein\u2013protein interaction motif that binds proline-rich target sequences (e.g., FPPPP) (<a href=\"#bib54\">Prehoda et al., 1999</a>), and removal of the EVH1 sequence abolishes localization of Ena/VASP to focal adhesions and the plasma membrane of fibroblasts (<a href=\"#bib43\">Loureiro et al., 2002</a>). Interaction with actin filaments is mediated by the EVH2 sequence, which contains an actin binding domain (BD) and a tetramerization motif required for polymerase activity. When expressed by itself in cells, the EVH2 domain concentrates in lamellipodial actin networks, but fails to achieve the same tight, membrane-proximal localization pattern as the intact protein (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bear et al., 2002</a>). Cytochalasin D, which caps actin filament barbed ends, rapidly displaces Ena/VASP proteins from the cell periphery (<a href=\"#bib34\">Krause et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Lacayo et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Neel et al., 2009</a>) arguing strongly that free filament ends play a functional role in Ena/VASP localization."

To our surprise, Lpd binds directly to filamentous actin, both in the absence and presence of VASP, an interaction mediated by a cloud of positively charged basic residues scattered through the C-terminal region of the protein (the Lpd Actin Binding Region (ABR), residues 850\u20131250). In cells, Lpd<sup>850\u22121250aa</sup>, lacking the RA-PH domain localizes to leading edge membranes and undergoes retrograde flow with the actin cytoskeleton. Surprisingly, the interaction between Lpd<sup>850\u22121250aa</sup> and the actin cytoskeleton does not require interactions with Ena/VASP proteins or SH3 containing proteins, such as Abi1 and endophilin. In vitro, Lpd increases processivity of barbed end-associated VASP tetramers by tethering them to actin filaments. Together these results provide mechanistic insight into how growing actin filaments feed back on the polymerases and nucleation promoting factors that regulate their assembly."

We, therefore, tested the effect of Lpd oligomerization on actin filament binding. We created stable dimers of the C-terminal region of Lpd by fusing Lpd<sup>850\u22121250aa</sup> to a dimer-forming, leucine-zipper motif (GFP-LZ-Lpd, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E,F</a>). Unlike the monomeric Lpd constructs, GFP-LZ-Lpd dimers bound to single actin filaments in both low- and high-salt buffers (100 mM KCl; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>). Similarly, dimeric Lpd bound more strongly to filamentous actin, both \u2018native\u2019 and phalloidin stabilized, as compared to monomeric Lpd in a co-sedimentation assay (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H,I</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

Nonetheless, we used this assay to test whether membrane tethered Lpd modulates actin network assembly in an autonomous manner.

We discovered that not only does GFP-Lpd<sup>850\u22121250aa</sup>, which lacks the tandem RA-PH domains, localize to leading edge membranes in XTC cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>), this construct also undergoes retrograde flow with the lamellipodial actin network. Analysis of speckle velocities in XTC cells co-expressing GFP-Lpd<sup>850\u22121250aa</sup> and mCherry-Actin revealed that the two proteins move with the same mean velocity: 71.9 \u00b1 17.5 nm/s for Lpd<sup>850\u22121250aa</sup> vs 73.5 \u00b1 14 nm/s for actin (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>, <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). In contrast to mCherry-Actin, GFP-Lpd<sup>850\u22121250aa</sup> speckles were observed less frequently, appeared more diffuse, and had shorter lifetimes (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

Consistent with constitutively dimeric Lpd having a higher affinity for actin, GFP-LZ-Lpd<sup>850\u22121250aa</sup> displayed slightly more robust leading edge membrane localization and the intensity of presumptive endocytic particles were brighter, as compared to those observed in cells expressing GFP-Lpd<sup>850\u22121250aa</sup> (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplements 1, 2</a>)."

To look for such a polarized lipid distribution we expressed a phosphatidylinositol lipid sensor, based on the pleckstrin-homology domain of phospholipase C\u03b4 (GFP-PLC\u03b4 PH). We found that GFP-PLC\u03b4 PH distributes uniformly across the plasma membrane of XTC cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). This result supports our interpretation that failure of Lyn-GFP-Lpd (35A) to localize to leading edge membranes in XTC cells reflects the fact that Lpd coupling to the actin cytoskeleton is required for establishing interactions with Ena/VASP or Abi1/endophilin at actin based membrane protrusions."

First, we simply froze actin assembly and disassembly by adding a mixture of Jasplakinolide and Latrunculin B to cells, without inhibiting myosin activity. Under these conditions we observed rapid retrograde movement of GFP-Lpd<sup>850\u22121250aa</sup> away from the leading edge, identical to the movement of mCherry-Actin (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, <a href=\"#media5\">Video 5</a>). The dynamics of GFP-Lpd<sup>850\u22121250aa</sup> translocation suggests that, in the absence of net actin assembly, myosin can pull GFP-Lpd<sup>850\u22121250aa</sup> off the leading edge via a tight linkage to the actin cytoskeleton. In these experiments, a fraction of membrane-localized GFP-Lpd<sup>850\u22121250aa</sup> remained at the leading edge, presumably due to the maintenance of interaction with Ena/VASP and/or Abi1/endophilin."

Consistent with previous observations (<a href=\"#bib34\">Krause et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Neel et al., 2009</a>), addition of Cytochalasin D to XTC cells strongly inhibited the localization of GFP-VASP to leading edge membranes (unpublished observations). When we treated these cells with a 100 nM Cytochalasin D, we observed a large fraction of leading edge-localized GFP-Lpd<sup>850\u22121250aa</sup> immediately dissociate from the leading edge membrane and flow back with the actin cytoskeleton (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>, <a href=\"#media6\">Video 6</a>). Because GFP-LZ-Lpd<sup>850\u22121250aa</sup> binds more strongly to filamentous actin, dissociation from the leading edge membrane was more dramatic following addition of Cytochalasin D (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>, <a href=\"#media7\">Video 7</a>).

We, therefore, wondered whether Lpd could bind Ena/VASP proteins and filamentous actin simultaneously. To test this idea, we first used TIRF microscopy to demonstrate that several Cy3-labeled VASP constructs\u2014an isolated EVH1 domain and two full length, tetrameric, actin-binding mutants\u2014failed to bind actin filaments (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). Addition of GFP-Lpd<sup>850\u22121250aa</sup>, however, caused all of these VASP constructs to associate with the sides of actin filaments (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). Interaction of the tetrameric Cy3-VASP actin-binding mutant with the monomeric Lpd construct produced higher-order VASP clusters visible on the sides of the filaments (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>, arrowheads). We previously observed this type of protein clustering in vitro when we combined tetrameric VASP and ActA<sup>255\u2212392aa</sup> (unpublished observations)."

We tested this hypothesis by visualizing actin filament elongation in the presence of either monomeric (Lpd<sup>850\u22121250aa</sup>) or dimeric (LZ-Lpd<sup>850\u22121250aa</sup>) GFP-Lpd constructs. The weak interaction between monomeric GFP-Lpd<sup>850\u22121250aa</sup> and filamentous actin turns out to be further antagonized by the presence of monomeric actin or profilin-actin (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). Also, we observed a reduction in the rate of barbed end actin filament elongation in the presence 2 \u00b5M profilin-actin and soluble GFP-Lpd<sup>850\u22121250aa</sup> or GFP-LZ-Lpd<sup>850\u22121250aa</sup> (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>), consistent with Lpd binding to (and partially sequestering) actin monomers.

The cloud of positively-charged amino acid residues is conserved between Lpd homologs of different organisms. These residues, however, are absent from other Ena/VASP binding proteins, such as RIAM, ActA, and Zyxin (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), suggesting that this basic region is important for cellular functions specific to Lpd. The filament-BD does not overlap motifs that bind the EVH1 domains of VASP (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), enabling Lpd to simultaneously interact with both Ena/VASP proteins and filamentous actin. Similar to VASP (<a href=\"#bib28\">Hansen and Mullins, 2010</a>), monomeric Lpd molecules bind actin filaments only weakly in physiological ionic strength (\u223c150 mM KCl), but bind much more strongly when oligomerized or densely clustered on membranes. Because of this effect, local enrichment of Lpd at the plasma membrane can exert a non-linear, cooperative effect on Ena/VASP activity (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>)."

Similar to the Grb protein family, Lpd is predicted to form homo-dimers mediated by interactions between the coiled-coil and tandem RA-PH domain. We find that the C-terminus of Lpd (residues 850\u20131250) is sufficient for recruiting Lpd to leading edge membrane where it directly interacts with free barbed ends and/or the sides of the actin filaments. Importantly, this interaction between Lamelliopodin and filamentous actin can occur independently to those mediated by Ena/VASP proteins or SH3 domains (i.e., Abi1/endophilin). However, Ena/VASP proteins recruited to actin based membrane protrusion can simultaneously associate with free actin filament barbed ends and Lpd. By this mechanism, we speculate that the lifetime of membrane targeted and barbed end associated Ena/VASP proteins are extended at the plasma membrane."

In this study, we establish that Ena/VASP proteins are directly controlled by their membrane-targeting factors. Specifically we show that Lpd-VASP complexes are more persistently localized to polymerizing ends, because the Lpd-actin interaction tethers VASP to the barbed end (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>). Filament tethering in combination with VASP clustering (<a href=\"#bib12\">Breitsprecher et al., 2008</a>) greatly increases the processivity of Ena/VASP proteins. In addition, Lpd-VASP complexes also enhance barbed-end polymerization more effectively compared to individual VASP tetramers, an ability likely based on Lpd's interaction with actin monomers. By increasing the number of monomer binding sites near the barbed end, Lpd may directly contribute to the polymerase activity of VASP tetramers."

In contrast to FL Lpd, however, we find that acute treatment of cells with cytochalasin D rapidly displaces GFP-Lpd<sup>850\u22121250aa</sup> from the leading edge and causes it to translocate toward the cell body with the disassembling lamellipodial actin network. We observed a similar phenotype for Lpd<sup>850\u22121250aa</sup> mutants that cannot interact with Ena/VASP proteins or SH3 domains. Taken together these results demonstrate that the C-terminal region of Lpd harbors autonomous filament binding sites that strongly influence its localization to actin rich protrusions.

This effect is more pronounced in the presence of profilin-actin, as compared to actin alone, indicating that profilin can shunt Lpd towards the filament barbed end. Interestingly, Lpd contains a poly-proline domain situated upstream of the ABR characterized in this study. We speculate that this poly-proline domain, similar to its function in other actin regulatory proteins such as formins and nucleation promoting factors (<a href=\"#bib50\">Paul et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Campellone and Welch, 2010</a>), could bind profilin-actin and promote its interaction with the actin-binding region, influencing the partitioning of Lpd between monomeric and filamentous actin. Previous work by <a href=\"#bib3\">Bae et al. (2010)</a> indicates that the interaction between profilin and phosphatidylinositol lipids (e.g., PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub>) plays a key role in regulating Lpd localization to actin-based membrane protrusions. It will, therefore, be important to characterize the interplay between profilin binding to the Lpd poly-proline domain and phosphatidylinositol lipids in the future.

To minimize protein depletion in the TIRF experiments, the counterglass was coated with PLL-PEG (PLL-PEG), which was dried onto the glass surface before rinsing with water. Synthesis of PLL-PEG was performed as previously described by <a href=\"#bib30\">Huang et al. (2001)</a>. PEG/biotin-PEG functionalized coverslips were then attached to PLL-PEG coated counterglass with double sided tape (Tesa). To reduce nonspecific binding to the PEG functionalized surface the imaging chamber was washed with a 1\u00d7 PBS solution pH 7.2 containing 1% Pluronic F-127 and 100 \u00b5g/ml beta casein. Glass was then washed with buffer containing 20 mM HEPES pH 7, 1 mM DTT, 200 mM KCl, 100 \u00b5g/ml beta-casein (wash buffer). Glass was subsequently incubated for 2 min with 50 nM streptavidin, followed by 50 nM biotin-PEG<sub>11</sub> heavy meromyosin diluted in wash buffer. To minimize nonspecific binding of GFP-Lpd and actin, it is essential that the stock solution of kappa casein is made fresh in water and centrifuged for 20 min at 346716\u00d7<i>g</i> (TLA 100.4 rotor or equivalent) to remove aggregated protein. If this is not possible, kappa casein can be left out of the 1% Pluronic F-127 or replaced with beta casein. Ultimately, the assay quality will depend on your ability to block defects on the biotin-PEG functionalized glass surfaces. Because Lpd<sup>850\u22121250aa</sup> and human VASP are highly basic proteins, poor coverslip functionalization will result in a tremendous amount of non-specific protein absorption to the glass substrates used for TIRF microscopy."

Actin was then incubated at 23\u00b0C for 45\u201360 min to completely polymerize. In parallel, GFP-Lpd or GFP-LZ-Lpd were diluted in buffer containing a final concentration of 20 mM HEPES [pH 7.0], 50\u2013150 mM KCl (depending on the desired final salt concentration), and 1 mM TCEP. Diluted Lpd (10\u201320 \u00b5M) was then subjected to high-speed ultracentrifugation for 30 min in a TLA100 rotor at 60,000 rpm (156,424\u00d7<i>g</i>) to remove potentially aggregated protein or particulate matter. Using a spectrophotometer, the Lpd protein concentration was recalculate from the measured absorbance at 280 nm (\u03b5<sub>280</sub> = 41,370 M<sup>\u22121</sup> cm<sup>\u22121</sup> and 44,350 M<sup>\u22121</sup> cm<sup>\u22121</sup> for GFP-Lpd<sup>850\u22121250aa</sup> and GFP-LZ-Lpd<sup>850\u22121250aa</sup>, respectively). Pre-centrifugation typically results in a loss of 1\u20132% total protein, which is comparable to the error of most spectrophotometer readings. GFP-Lpd is diluted further to a desired 2\u00d7 working concentration, which is then mixed 1:1 with 2\u00d7 pre-polymerized filamentous actin (final reaction volume equals 50 \u00b5l). Lpd and filamentous actin are then allowed to equilibrate at 23\u00b0C for 60 min. Actin filaments with Lpd bound are then pelleted by ultracentrifugation in a TLA100 rotor at 48,000 rpm (100,111\u00d7<i>g</i>) for 30 min. After ultracentrifugation, the supernatant is removed and pellets are resuspended in 50 \u00b5l of 1\u00d7 SDS-PAGE protein sample buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 6.8], 100 mM DTT, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.1% bromophenol blue). We then load 10 \u00b5l of resuspended pellets and load samples that were not centrifuges in a pre-casted NuPAGE 4\u201312% Bis-Tris gradient gel (Invitrogen, Cat# NP0323BOX), which are then resolved using a Tris/MES/SDS running buffer [pH 7.3]. SDS-PAGE gels were subsequently fixed for 30 min in a solution containing methanol:water:acetic acid (50:43:1), before being stained with Sypro Ruby (Invitrogen, Cat# S12000). Gels are then scanned using a Typhoon imaging system (488 nm/610 nm; EX/EM). The concentration of Lpd and actin in the load and pellet were quantifies by measuring the integrated intensity of individual protein bands in gel after applying a local average background subtraction using ImageQuant. When we process samples containing GFP-Lpd or GFP-LZ-Lpd alone that were included during the co-sedimentation assays (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>), we observe the equivalent of 50\u2013100 nM (5\u201310% of a 1 \u00b5M load) Lpd removed from the supernatant in the absence of actin. Because the amount of protein lost during the pre-spin and the co-sedimentation assay are roughly the same, we conclude that protein loss likely reflects non-specific absorption to the walls of the centrifuge tubes. For this reason, we are likely over-estimating the stoichiometry of Lpd bound to actin in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1I</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D</a> by 5\u201310%."

We added 0.5\u20131.0 \u00b5g DNA in complex with 2.5\u20135.0 \u00b5l Superfect (Qiagen, Cat# 1006699) to each well containing complete media. After 5\u20136 hr, the media was changed. 24\u201336 hr after transfection, cells were prepared for live cell imaging."

Laminin coated coverslips were rinse with PBS and then assembled in stainless steel Attofluor cell imaging chamber (Invitrogen). Transfected cells were then trypsinized in 24-well plastic dishes, centrifuged, wash with complete media, and seeded on the laminin coated glass in the presence of filter sterilized Ham's F12 media containing 10% FBS and 50 mM HEPES [pH 7.2]. Cells spread on laminin coated glass within 30 min. Polarized cells were imaged using wide-field epifluorescence and a Nikon Plan Apo 60\u00d7 TIRF (NA 1.45) objective on a Nikon Eclipse microscope."

B16F1 cells were imaged with Nikon Plan Apo 60\u00d7 TIRF (NA 1.45) using wide-field epifluorescence illumination at 37\u00b0C in the presence of CO<sub>2</sub>. We employed the Nikon Perfect Focus instrument to maintain the focal plan throughout image acquisition. GFP/Alexa488, Cy3, and Cy5 fluorophores were excited with 491 nm, 561 nm, and 638 nm Coherent lasers respectively. Laser power was modulated with neutral density filters, an AOTF, and exposure settings such that 1\u20132 mW of laser power was delivered through the objective as measured with a power meter. We used a single filter cube containing a multipass excitation and dichroic filter (Chroma). A rapid switching Sutter Instruments emission filter wheel was positioned before our camera. Images of XTC cells, B16F1 cells, and single actin filament TIRF assay were collected on a cooled Andor Xion EM-CCD camera. The microscope, camera, and lasers were controlled using Micromanager 1.4 (<a href=\"#bib23\">Edelstein et al., 2010</a>). Image processing and data analysis was performed using ImageJ. Kymographs were generated using the ImageJ plugin, MultipleKymographs. Data was graphed using Kaleidagraph and Prism. Figures for the manuscript were made in Adobe Illustrator CS6."

Consistent with our single-actin filament TIRF measurements, the interaction between actin and Lpd is stronger in low ionic strength buffers. For technical reasons we were unable to achieve sufficiently high concentrations of Lpd to saturate the binding interaction with filamentous actin in 150 mM KCl. Instead, we generated complete binding curves for GFP-Lpd and GFP-LZ-Lpd binding actin in 100 mM KCl. Fitting these curves we obtained dissociation equilibrium constants (K<sub>d</sub>) of 1.49 \u00b5M and 3.92 \u00b5M for GFP-LZ-Lpd and GFP-Lpd, respectively (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H-1I</a>).

We find that individual actin filaments elongating in buffers containing 100 mM KCl and either 50 nM tetrameric VASP or 250 nM dimeric GFP-LZ-Lpd alone do not bundle actin filaments. However, the presence of both VASP and GFP-LZ-Lpd results in a large amount of actin filament bundling.

Furthermore, Brietsprecher et al., (2008) showed that clustering enhances VASP anti-capping activity. It is, however, technically challenging to perform an anti-capping experiment in the presence of Lpd because of the prodigious amount of actin bundling that occurs in the presence of both VASP and Lpd. This interaction effectively depletes VASP and Lpd from solution over time and reduces the anti-capping activity of VASP. We, nevertheless, established conditions for measuring capping protein barbed end association in the presence of either Lpd, VASP, or Lpd-VASP in high ionic strength buffer (100 mM KCl). This buffer composition was used to minimize the actin bundling activity of VASP and Lpd, while favoring barbed end association. We find that both Lpd and VASP individually reduce the rate of capping protein barbed end association in the presence of 2 \u00b5M actin-profilin. The combined presence of both Lpd and VASP further enhances the anti-capping to a level that is approximately the sum of the individual protein activities. These experiments are difficult to interpret because we cannot quantify how much of the net anti-capping is contributed by VASP alone, Lpd alone, and Lpd-VASP complexes that associate with free barbed ends. Although these results are promising, we think it's premature to include this data in our revised manuscript. If the reviewers have a strong objection, we can try to integrate the anti-capping data into the manuscript."

Firstly, frozen GFP-Lpd and GFP-LZ-Lpd remain monomeric and, as judged by analytical gel filtration, does not aggregate after thawing. Secondly, to remove large aggregates that might be present in small numbers we always spin GFP-Lpd and GFP-LZ-Lpd at high-speed prior to combining each protein with filamentous actin (see Methods). Following ultracentrifugation, the protein concentration is then re-measured using a spectrophotometer. This high-speed pre-spin removes less than 1-2% of the total Lpd protein (10-20 \u00b5M load), comparable to the error in the spectrophotometer absorbance reading. When we process samples containing GFP-Lpd alone that were included during the co-sedimentation assays (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2013figure supplement 1D</a>), we observe the equivalent of 50-100 nM (5-10% of a 1 \u00b5M load) Lpd removed from the supernatant in the absence of actin. Because the amount of protein lost during the pre-spin and the co-sedimentation assay are roughly the same, we conclude that protein loss likely reflects non-specific absorption to the walls of the centrifuge tubes. The small amount of Lpd lost to the walls of centrifuge tubes in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2013figure supplement 1</a> does not change our overall conclusions. The only significant effect is that the saturating values in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1L</a> would shift down (but not left or right). This does not affect our estimate of the affinity but does alter the apparent binding stoichiometry, which remains difficult to estimate using actin co-sedimentation. To highlight this minor caveat in the revised manuscript, we noted a possible 5-10% over-estimate in the stoichiometry of Lpd bound to actin. We also added a complete description of our co-sedimentation assay to the revised manuscript."

Firstly, we were asked to perform co-sedimentation experiments to verify the binding data that we measured directly using TIRF microscopy. This appears to be based on the assumption that co-sedimentation is a sort of gold standard for actin filament binding. As I am sure the reviewer is aware, co-sedimentation is an inherently flawed binding assay. It is not an equilibrium method and, therefore, not nearly as accurate as fluorescence-based assays such as polarization anisotropy or direct TIRF imaging as presented in our original manuscript. Co-sedimentation systematically underestimates the affinities of actin binding proteins and fails to detect even physiologically relevant interactions when the dissociation equilibrium constant is too high. This problem is exacerbated when the experiment is performed, as the reviewer suggests, in low (substoichiometric) concentrations of the actin-binding protein. Therefore, while a positive result by co-sedimentation can confirm actin filament binding, a negative result does not provide good evidence against binding."

The fact that both monomeric and dimeric constructs reach the same plateau at saturation argues strongly that the two binding domains of GFP-LZ-Lpd can simultaneously bind filaments. In contrast, if only one Lpd in the LZ-Lpd construct could interact with actin filaments, we would expect to see a higher concentration of LZ-Lpd in the pellet at the saturation point, as compared to monomeric Lpd under the same conditions.
