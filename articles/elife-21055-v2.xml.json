Here, we report that peripheral administration of the hypothalamic neuropeptide orexin improves the survival of mice with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced endotoxin shock, a well-studied septic shock model. The effect is accompanied by a suppression of excessive cytokine production and an increase of catecholamines and corticosterone. We found that peripherally administered orexin penetrates the blood-brain barrier under endotoxin shock, and that central administration of orexin also suppresses the cytokine production and improves the survival, indicating orexin\u2019s direct action in the central nervous system (CNS). Orexin helps restore body temperature and potentiates cardiovascular function in LPS-injected mice. Pleiotropic modulation of inflammatory response by orexin through the CNS may constitute a novel therapeutic approach for septic shock."

Here, we report that peripheral administration of the hypothalamic neuropeptide orexin improves the survival of mice with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced endotoxin shock, a well-studied septic shock model. The effect is accompanied by a suppression of excessive cytokine production and an increase of catecholamines and corticosterone. We found that peripherally administered orexin penetrates the blood-brain barrier under endotoxin shock, and that central administration of orexin also suppresses the cytokine production and improves the survival, indicating orexin\u2019s direct action in the central nervous system (CNS). Orexin helps restore body temperature and potentiates cardiovascular function in LPS-injected mice. Pleiotropic modulation of inflammatory response by orexin through the CNS may constitute a novel therapeutic approach for septic shock."

Septic shock is defined as cardiovascular dysfunction triggered by sepsis, representing the most severe stage of the illness (<a href=\"#bib1\">Angus and van der Poll, 2013</a>). Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a major cell wall component of Gram negative bacteria, plays a central role in sepsis as the endotoxin inducing a systemic inflammatory response, and LPS-induced endotoxin shock is one of the\u00a0several well-studied animal models of septic shock. Recent advances have started to reveal the highly complex pathophysiology of sepsis (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cohen, 2002</a>). However, researchers have failed to translate the advances in understanding the pathophysiology of sepsis into effective new therapies, and the mortality of sepsis still remains high. To improve the outcome of patients with sepsis, new therapeutic strategies and agents are essential."

For example, vagal afferents activated by endotoxin and cytokines in sepsis stimulate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and exert anti-inflammatory effects through the release of glucocorticoids (<a href=\"#bib32\">Tracey, 2002</a>). A cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway has also been reported, in which the activation of efferent vagus nerves suppresses systemic inflammatory responses (<a href=\"#bib6\">Borovikova et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Wang et al., 2004</a>). Acetylcholine attenuates cytokine production from LPS-activated macrophages in the spleen through the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (<a href=\"#bib36\">Wang et al., 2003</a>). Vagus nerve stimulation also leads to the activation of the splenic nerve and release of norepinephrine in the spleen (<a href=\"#bib34\">Vida et al., 2011</a>). Norepinephrine inhibits cytokine production in the spleen and suppresses systemic inflammation in experimental sepsis through \u03b22-adnenoceptors on lymphocytes (<a href=\"#bib34\">Vida et al., 2011</a>). Thus, the anti-inflammatory effects of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems seem to be synergistic."

Recent reports show that intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration of orexin modulates heart rate and body temperature, and increases the level of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) in a murine sepsis model induced by cecal ligation and puncture (<a href=\"#bib11\">Deutschman et al., 2013</a>). ICV orexin also partially increases locomotor activity suppressed by a low dose of LPS in rats (<a href=\"#bib15\">Grossberg et al., 2011</a>). However, no information is available as to whether orexin actually improves the survival and/or suppresses the systemic inflammation. Moreover, CNS administration of therapeutic agents in human patients may often be unfeasible; clinical applications of orexin in humans require a tactic to deliver orexin into the brain. Systemic inflammation, the hallmark of sepsis, enhances the permeability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in rodents (<a href=\"#bib17\">Kowal et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Xaio et al., 2001</a>) and humans (<a href=\"#bib2\">Ballabh et al., 2004</a>); some peptides and proteins, including insulin, albumin (<a href=\"#bib38\">Xaio et al., 2001</a>), and antibodies (<a href=\"#bib17\">Kowal et al., 2004</a>), can enter the brain under the condition of systemic inflammation. In this study, we deliver orexin into the brain by taking advantage of the enhanced BBB permeability under the condition of systemic inflammation, rescuing mice with endotoxin shock by targeting the CNS."

We measured the levels of 32 cytokines in serum from LPS-injected mice. Whereas LPS elevated the levels of most cytokines, SC infusion of OXA (1 mg/mouse/24 hr) significantly inhibited the increase of a number of cytokines at 4 hr and 22 hr after LPS injection (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). Simultaneously, OXA ameliorated hypothermia induced by LPS at 4 hr and 22 hr after LPS injection (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Particularly, in the early stage of endotoxin shock, the levels of cytokines produced by LPS-activated macrophages (e.g., tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), macrophage inflammatory protein-1\u03b1 (MIP-1\u03b1, also termed CCL3), and MIP-1\u03b2 [CCL4]) were significantly decreased by OXA treatment. In the later stage, the levels of many more cytokines produced by macrophages and/or lymphocytes were significantly decreased, including the levels of interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) and interleukin-17 (IL-17), of which the decrease by OXA treatment was particularly robust. In healthy mice injected with saline instead of LPS, peripherally administered OXA did not affect the cytokine levels in the peripheral blood (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). To examine the inflammatory state of the CNS, we measured the levels of the same set of 32 cytokines in homogenized brains of LPS-injected mice. LPS increased the levels of most cytokines in the brain, and peripherally administered OXA significantly inhibited the increase of certain cytokines in the brain at 4 hr and/or 22 hr after LPS injection, particularly the microglia-derived chemokines such as MIP-1\u03b1/1\u03b2 (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

We investigated the correlation between survival rate and body temperature in mice with endotoxin shock. Core body temperature of orexin-administered mice with endotoxin shock remained higher than those of saline-administered mice with endotoxin shock (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). The mice that survived through endotoxin shock had significantly higher body temperatures at 24 hr post-LPS injection, as compared with non-survivors (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). A cut-off value of 28.5\u00b0C gave an optimal receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, predicting survival with highest sensitivity and specificity (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). This suggests that body temperature at 24 hr after LPS injection can be a good predictor or marker of eventual survival in our mice with endotoxin shock. This does not necessarily mean that maintenance of body temperature is a sole cause of the improved survival in endotoxin shock. Indeed, we found that the survival of mice with endotoxin shock was not improved by simply warming up the animal on a heat pad to the same degree as the orexin-treated mice (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), although it is reported that the survival is improved by dramatically elevating body temperature through external heating to 42\u00b0C to activate the heat shock protein pathway (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chu et al., 1997</a>)."

ICV administration of OXA (0.1 mg/mouse/4 hr) significantly suppressed the increase in the level of MIP-1\u03b1 and showed a tendency to suppress the increase in the levels of MIP-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 in the peripheral blood at 4 hr after LPS injection (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>).

Raphe nuclei, containing serotonergic neurons, exist in the pons/medulla and midbrain. Medullary raphe nuclei are known as one of the important sites of action for orexin\u2019s thermogenic effect (<a href=\"#bib33\">Tupone et al., 2011</a>). In wild-type mice with endotoxin shock, IP administration of OXA (0.1 mg/mouse) activated serotonergic neurons in the medullary raphe pallidus and raphe magnus (RPa/RMg), as assessed by double immunostaining with anti-Fos and anti-5HT antibodies (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). There was a significant increase in the percentage of Fos-positive serotonergic neurons in RPa/RMg after OXA administration, compared to saline administration (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). This Fos induction was not seen in healthy wild-type mice (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>) or in OXRKO mice with endotoxin shock (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Midbrain dorsal raphe nucleus (the dorsal raphe nucleus, dorsal part and ventrolateral part; DRD/DRVL) is reported to be a thermosensor activated by elevation of body temperature (<a href=\"#bib16\">Hale et al., 2011</a>). In wild-type mice with endotoxin shock, there was also a significant increase of Fos activity in serotonergic neurons in DRD/DRVL by OXA administration (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013C</a>). We systematically surveyed other known orexin targets in the CNS, and detected no statistically significant changes in Fos activities upon OXA administration under endotoxin shock in these areas (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1D\u2013H</a>). Neurons in locus coeruleus (LC), rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM, a sympathetic nucleus), nucleus tractus solitaries (NTS, a parasympathetic sensory nucleus), and dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMNX, a parasympathetic motor nucleus) are known to be activated after LPS injection (<a href=\"#bib12\">Elmquist et al., 1996</a>). Stimulation of LC by corticotropin-releasing hormone is reported to exert an immunosuppressive effect on the peripheral lymphocytes (<a href=\"#bib29\">Rassnick et al., 1994</a>). We confirmed that these neurons were activated after LPS injection (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>), independently of orexin signaling (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). We concluded that, in mice with endotoxin shock, peripheral administration of orexin activated the serotonergic thermoregulatory system in an orexin receptor-dependent manner."

We found that the survival of mice with endotoxin shock is improved by central administration of orexin. Moreover, surprisingly, peripheral injection of orexin also improved survival, because orexin could penetrate into the CNS due to BBB dysregulation under the condition of systemic inflammation. Our findings show that orexin could be a new therapeutic agent for septic shock; we propose here an innovative approach to target the CNS for systemic inflammation, employing an unexpected method to deliver neuropeptides into the brain by taking advantage of the pathophysiology of sepsis."

Inhibiting either IL-17 or IFN-\u03b3 by neutralizing antibodies within 24 hr after cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) is reported to improve survival (<a href=\"#bib13\">Flierl et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">M\u00e1rquez-Velasco et al., 2011</a>). Although these antibodies are administered in the early period only, their life-supporting effects manifest over the next several days, similar to the effects of orexin in the present study. IL-17 produced during sepsis is implicated in the \u2018cytokine storm,\u2019 in which the inflammatory response is amplified, increasing the lethality of septic shock (<a href=\"#bib13\">Flierl et al., 2008</a>). IL-17 synergistically potentiates LPS-induced activation of peritoneal macrophages in vitro and increases the levels of IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-1\u03b2. In our study, orexin did not directly inhibit the increase of cytokine production in LPS-activated peritoneal macrophages, although TNF-\u03b1 production in LPS-stimulated microglia, the\u00a0primary immune cells in the CNS, is reported to be decreased by OXA pretreatment (<a href=\"#bib39\">Xiong et al., 2013</a>). Together with the findings that centrally administered orexin was effective at a lower dose in improving the survival of mice with endotoxin shock and in suppressing MIP-1\u03b1 levels in their peripheral blood, our results indicate that the anti-inflammatory effects of orexin are through its action in the CNS rather than in the peripheral tissues."

The\u00a0blood corticosterone level is increased in mice with LPS-induced lung injury (<a href=\"#bib20\">Landgraf et al., 2014</a>), and even a slight upregulation of corticosterone by exogenous leptin may improve LPS-induced lung injury (<a href=\"#bib20\">Landgraf et al., 2014</a>). Therefore, the increase of corticosterone levels in endotoxin shock may play a role in the anti-inflammatory effects of orexin, although further studies with glucocorticoid agonists/antagonists are necessary to substantiate this possibility. Indeed, glucocorticoids are sometimes used for human patients with sepsis and effective in some cases (<a href=\"#bib10\">Dellinger et al., 2013</a>)."

The increases of catecholamines might not only stabilize hemodynamics by potentiating cardiovascular function, but also modulate inflammation through adrenoceptors (<a href=\"#bib31\">Spengler et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Vida et al., 2011</a>). However, although catecholamines are used to stabilize hemodynamics in human patients with sepsis (<a href=\"#bib10\">Dellinger et al., 2013</a>), their effects are often limited because vascular responsiveness to catecholamines is reduced during sepsis (<a href=\"#bib26\">Parker and Parrillo, 1983</a>). Also, adrenergic modulation of inflammation is complicated. The adrenergic anti-inflammatory effects are mostly mediated by \u03b22-adrenoceptors (<a href=\"#bib34\">Vida et al., 2011</a>), while stimulation of \u03b12-adrenoceptors induces pro-inflammatory effects (<a href=\"#bib31\">Spengler et al., 1990</a>). Moreover, systemically administered catecholamines act on all tissues without coordination. In contrast, catecholamines endogenously released under the CNS command are localized in the specific target tissues and their actions on each target are integrated by the CNS. This may be why the life-supporting effects of orexin administration on sepsis may be longer lasting and more effective than those of catecholamine administration alone. Indeed, in the rat septic shock model, administration of norepinephrine for 24 hr improves the survival rate by only 20% (<a href=\"#bib21\">Li et al., 2009</a>). In contrast, administration of orexin for 24 hr showed 70\u201380% and 40% improvements in the survival rate for prophylactic and post-hoc protocols, respectively, in our study (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig3\">3</a>). Furthermore, it is reported that the treatment with both catecholamines and glucocorticoids synergistically attenuates the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and IL-17 during sepsis (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bosmann et al., 2013</a>)."

Raphe nuclei are reported to be an orexin-regulated region for brown adipose tissue thermogenesis and heart rate modulation (<a href=\"#bib33\">Tupone et al., 2011</a>). Taken together, our findings show that orexin improves the survival of mice with endotoxin shock through a multitude of pathways, including the neuroendocrine and autonomic nervous system, by targeting the CNS (hypothesized in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). The precise mechanism through which CNS orexin modulates inflammatory responses merits further investigation. The present study suggests that a coordinated intervention through the CNS against the complex pathophysiology of systemic inflammation can be a novel therapeutic approach for septic shock. While we therapeutically exploited the leakiness of BBB under sepsis in this study, BBB dysfunction may also permit cytokines and inflammatory cells to freely enter into the CNS, which may constitute an additional element of pathophysiology of sepsis, such as \u2018sepsis-associated encephalopathy\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib37\">Widmann and Heneka, 2014</a>). The failure of traditional therapy (e.g., catecholamines) in septic shock has been commonly attributed to defects in peripheral response mechanisms. Our study suggests that it may be the CNS regulatory machinery that is dysfunctional, which could be partially restored by orexin."

Subcutaneous infusion started at a rate of 8 \u00b5l/hr for 24 hr at the same time of implantation of the pump. To investigate the post-hoc therapeutic effect of peripherally administered orexin on survival, mice were implanted subcutaneously with a programmable microinfusion pump (iPRECIO, SMP300, Primetech,\u00a0Japan) containing 1 mg orexin-A dissolved in 100 \u00b5l saline (or containing 100 \u00b5l saline as a\u00a0control) under anesthesia at 30 min before LPS injection. These pumps are wirelessly controlled by an external scheduler. The infusion schedule was programmed with iPRECIO Management Software ver 1.1. At 30 min after LPS injection, subcutaneous infusion started at a rate of 8 \u00b5l/hr for 24 hr. The next day iPRECIO was refilled with orexin A (1 mg orexin-A dissolved in 100 \u00b5l saline) or 100 \u00b5l saline. To investigate the effect of centrally administered orexin on survival, mice were intracerebroventriculerly (ICV) administered with 0.06 mg orexin-A dissolved in 3 \u00b5l saline (or 3 \u00b5l saline as a\u00a0control) in 5 min and implanted subcutaneously with an osmotic pump containing 200 \u00b5l saline as transfusion (at a rate of 8 \u00b5l/hr) under anesthesia at 30 min before LPS injection. At the same time of LPS injection, ICV infusion was started at the rate of 0.5 \u00b5l /hr (orexin-A concentration was 0.02 mg/\u00b5l). To investigate the effect of warming up to the same degree as orexin-treated mice on survival, mice were warmed on a heat pad at 30\u00b0C for 24 hr at the same time of LPS injection. In all the survival experiments, body temperature was monitored for seven days after LPS injection. We assessed survival as primary endpoint, and body temperature at 24 hr after LPS injection as secondary endpoint. Observation was stopped in seven days or by death. Relationship between survival and body temperature was expressed by the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, plotting true positive rate (Y-axis; sensitivity) against the\u00a0false positive rate (X-axis; one minus specificity) at various body temperature values. The ROC curve was assessed by area under the curve (AUC), and an optimal cut-off values was determined, which gave maximum AUC. The\u00a0sample size was calculated on the following assumptions; \u03b1 is 0.05, power is 0.8, the\u00a0usual survival rate in control group at two days is 0.2 and the\u00a0expected survival rate in the\u00a0treatment group at seven days is 0.6\u20130.9.

The main finding of this study is that peripheral administration of orexin increases survival in mice with endotoxin shock. Furthermore, data is presented demonstrating that during LPS-induced endotoxin shock, peripherally administered orexin crosses the blood brain barrier. In addition, ICV administration of orexin also increased survival of mice with endotoxin shock. Other important measures aimed at providing insight into the potential mechanism(s) by which orexin increases survival include cytokine levels (which are generally decreased by orexin administration), and body temperature (which is significantly decreased by LPS and partially rescued by orexin administration). While the overall findings of a new approach to treatment of endotoxin shock are of great interest, the experiments addressing the mechanism(s) by which this occurs are only observational and in general do not directly test hypotheses about the roles of the measured variables in mediating the increased survival. Nonetheless, these data should provide important bases for future studies addressing the mechanism(s) involved in the increased survival in mice treated with orexin during endotoxin shock."

All of these experiments are well done, but the only conclusion that can be drawn is that \"peripheral injection of orexin depends on the raphe nuclei to stabilize body temperature.\" Given the title of the paper, it would be excellent to repeat the experiments of <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5H and I</a> (inhibiting the raphe nuclei during orexin injection) while performing a survival experiment. This experiment would clearly show that orexin enhances survival rates by raising body temperature, as is implied by the Results and Discussion sections.</i>"

To substantiate the possibility, we have to perform a survival experiment while inhibiting the raphe nuclei during orexin injection as the reviewer suggested. However, the survival DREADD experiments are extremely challenging, because we have to be able to continuously inhibit serotonergic neurons by CNO at least for a few days (there is no precedence as far as we know), and we need very large amounts of orexin peptide for continuous infusion. While we are still considering the feasibility of such experiments for a future project, in this paper, we have deleted the section describing the serotonergic DREADD experiments, following the suggestion from the Senior Editor."

The main finding of this study is that peripheral administration of orexin increases survival in mice with endotoxin shock. Furthermore, data is presented demonstrating that during LPS-induced endotoxin shock, peripherally administered orexin crosses the blood brain barrier. In addition, ICV administration of orexin also increased survival of mice with endotoxin shock. Other important measures aimed at providing insight into the potential mechanism(s) by which orexin increases survival include cytokine levels (which are generally decreased by orexin administration), and body temperature (which is significantly decreased by LPS and partially rescued by orexin administration). While the overall findings of a new approach to treatment of endotoxin shock are of great interest, the experiments addressing the mechanism(s) by which this occurs are only observational and in general do not directly test hypotheses about the roles of the measured variables in mediating the increased survival. Nonetheless, these data should provide important bases for future studies addressing the mechanism(s) involved in the increased survival in mice treated with orexin during endotoxin shock.</i>"
