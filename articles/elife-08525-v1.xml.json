Mtb lipid-specific group 1 CD1-restricted T cells have been detected in Mtb-infected individuals. However, their role in protective immunity against Mtb remains unclear due to the absence of group 1 CD1 expression in mice. To overcome the challenge, we generated mice that expressed human group 1 CD1 molecules (hCD1Tg) and a CD1b-restricted, mycolic-acid specific TCR (DN1Tg). Using DN1Tg/hCD1Tg mice, we found that activation of DN1 T cells was initiated in the mediastinal lymph nodes and showed faster kinetics compared to Mtb Ag85B-specific CD4+ T cells after aerosol infection with Mtb. Additionally, activated DN1 T cells exhibited polyfunctional characteristics, accumulated in lung granulomas, and protected against Mtb infection. Therefore, our findings highlight the vaccination potential of targeting group 1 CD1-restricted lipid-specific T cells against Mtb infection."
