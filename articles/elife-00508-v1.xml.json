Mechanisms that direct neural differentiation of PSCs involve growth factor signaling and transcription regulation. However, it is unknown whether and how electrical activity influences this process. Here we report a high throughput imaging-based screen, which uncovers that selamectin, an anti-helminthic therapeutic compound with reported activity on invertebrate glutamate-gated chloride channels, promotes neural differentiation of PSCs. We show that selamectin\u2019s pro-neurogenic activity is mediated by \u03b32-containing GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors in subsets of neural rosette progenitors, accompanied by increased proneural and lineage-specific transcription factor expression and cell cycle exit. In vivo, selamectin promotes neurogenesis in developing zebrafish. Our results establish a chemical screening platform that reveals activity-dependent neural differentiation from PSCs. Compounds identified in this and future screening might prove therapeutically beneficial for treating neurodevelopmental or neurodegenerative disorders."

Mechanisms that direct neural differentiation of PSCs involve growth factor signaling and transcription regulation. However, it is unknown whether and how electrical activity influences this process. Here we report a high throughput imaging-based screen, which uncovers that selamectin, an anti-helminthic therapeutic compound with reported activity on invertebrate glutamate-gated chloride channels, promotes neural differentiation of PSCs. We show that selamectin\u2019s pro-neurogenic activity is mediated by \u03b32-containing GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors in subsets of neural rosette progenitors, accompanied by increased proneural and lineage-specific transcription factor expression and cell cycle exit. In vivo, selamectin promotes neurogenesis in developing zebrafish. Our results establish a chemical screening platform that reveals activity-dependent neural differentiation from PSCs. Compounds identified in this and future screening might prove therapeutically beneficial for treating neurodevelopmental or neurodegenerative disorders."

Neural induction, the first step in neural differentiation of mESCs, requires active FGF signaling (<a href=\"#bib55\">Ying et al., 2003</a>) and inhibition of the BMP/TGF-beta pathway (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chambers et al., 2009</a>). Subsequent regional identity and lineage-guided differentiation are further regulated by the presence or absence of various morphogens or transcription factors (<a href=\"#bib26\">Lee et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Wichterle et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Andersson et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Martinat et al., 2006</a>).

We identified small molecules that increased the appearance of TH<sup>+</sup> neurons in the assay, including those with known neurotrophic activity and those that are functionally novel. Notably, we show that the anti-parasitic compound selamectin, with reported activity on invertebrate glutamate-gated chloride channels, increased not only TH<sup>+</sup> neurons, but also multiple other neural types including the serotonergic (5-HT), GABAergic, and Islet+ motor neurons as well as Olig2+ oligodendrocytes. We further reveal, through pharmacology, genetics, single-cell electrophysiological recordings and clonal analyses, that selamectin acts by enhancing GABAA receptor signaling, increasing the expression of proneural and lineage-specific transcription factors, and promoting cell cycle exit and differentiation of neural progenitors. We also demonstrate that selamectin can increase neuronal differentiation in human ESCs and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) as well as in vivo in the developing zebrafish."

The GABA induced currents are sensitive to bicucculin (Bicu, 200 \u03bcM), but in some cases the application of 200 \u03bcM Bicu did not completely block the GABA induced currents (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>).

Selamectin indeed induced inward currents in neural rosette cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>), but the response was heterogeneous. We grouped the cells into four groups based on whether they displayed detectable GABA and selamectin-induced currents.

                        "text": "In this study, we have undertaken a chemical genetic approach to identify new mechanisms that regulate neuronal differentiation from PSCs. Three significant advancements are reported here: First, we have established an imaging-based high content small molecule screening method for identifying chemicals that increase the production of TH<sup>+</sup> DA neurons from mESCs. We have further shown that compounds identified through mESC-based screening are applicable to hPSCs. Second, It has been previously reported that mild electrical stimulation influences mESCs to assume a neuronal fate (<a href=\"#bib53\">Yamada et al., 2007</a>). Through the identification of selamectin, we reveal a novel mechanism underlying the activity-dependent regulation of neuronal differentiation from PSCs. Third, by employing single-cell electrophysiological recordings of mESC-derived neural rosette cells, we uncover for the first time the heterogeneity of neural progenitor responses to GABA and selamectin, which has provided a plausible explanation for paradoxical observations of GABA\u2019s effects on in vivo neurogenesis (<a href=\"#bib27\">Liu et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Tozuka et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Song et al., 2012</a>)."

Second, the use of monolayer differentiation also renders the background noise fairly low, with baseline TH<sup>+</sup> cells of 0.5\u20133% in control (DMSO) conditions. Third, compared to previous screening that uses either pluripotency markers (e.g., Oct4) or general neuronal differentiation markers (e.g., a-tubulin or TuJ1), we used the neuronal subtype specific marker TH. The small number of TH<sup>+</sup> cells makes the quantification convenient and accurate, thereby significantly increasing the sensitivity of our assay. Finally, our assay is the first that offers the prospect for identifying compounds that regulate neuronal subtype differentiation, since previous assays use only general pluripotency or neuronal markers."

                        "text": "This screening platform has enabled us to identify selamectin and show that it increases the production of multiple neuronal lineage types including DA, 5-HT, GABA, and Islet<sup>+</sup> neurons as well as olig2<sup>+</sup> oligodendrocytes. Selamectin is known to target invertebrate glutamate-guided chloride channels that have no orthologues in vertebrates. Our pharmacological, genetic and clonal studies provide first evidence that selamectin targets the \u03b32 subunit-containing GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor to promote progenitor cell cycle exit toward terminal differentiation. Single-cell electrophysiological recordings further show that a subset of neural rosette cells responds to GABA and selamectin via functional GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors. The blocking of GABA-induced current by bicuculline (the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonist), however, is incomplete, suggesting that GABA receptors other than GABA<sub>A</sub> are also expressed in neural rosette progenitors. Expression of functional GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors has been demonstrated in ES cells (<a href=\"#bib39\">Schwirtlich et al., 2010</a>). Interestingly, many recorded neural rosette cells display very low membrane input resistance (less than 100 M\u03a9), and high membrane capacitances (up to 50 pF). Furthermore, applications of 100 \u03bcM meclofenamic acid (MFA) (<a href=\"#bib27\">Liu et al., 2005</a>) could reversibly reduce the inward currents when the membrane potential of the cells are held at \u221270 mV. These observations suggest that neural rosette cells may be electrically connected, similar to neural progenitor cells in the ventricular zone of embryonic brains (<a href=\"#bib28\">LoTurco et al., 1995</a>) and those in the sub-ventricular zone of adult brains (<a href=\"#bib27\">Liu et al., 2005</a>). Thus, it is possible that functional GABA receptors expressed in one cell may render other electrically connected cells to display apparent GABA-induced currents."

Clonal analysis and time-lapse live imaging further uncover the role of selamectin (hence, likely GABA) in promoting progenitor cell cycle exit toward terminal differentiation. These molecular and cellular findings, together with the pharmacogenetic and electrophysiological studies, lead us to propose that selamectin-potentiated activation of the \u03b32-containing GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor in mESC-derived neural progenitor cells causes Cl<sup>\u2212</sup> outflow (due to the high internal chloride levels in these progenitor cells), thereby leading to the depolarization of neural progenitors and calcium influx. This further activates proneural and lineage-specific transcription factors, which have established roles in promoting cell cycle exit toward terminal neuronal differentiation (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bertrand et al., 2002</a>) (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8F</a>). Such neural activity-dependent regulation of transcription factor expression has been reported in developing <i>Xenopus</i> embryos (<a href=\"#bib13\">Demarque and Spitzer, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Marek et al., 2010</a>).

Recently, in the context of adult neurogenesis, GABA released by local interneurons has been shown to promote the exit of adult neural stem cells from quiescence (thereby promote their proliferation) (<a href=\"#bib43\">Song et al., 2012</a>). Our single neural rosette cell recordings, which reveal the heterogeneous responses among progenitors, provide an explanation as to why the influence of GABA signaling on neurogenesis appears cell type- and context-dependent."

                                "text": "Neural rosettes are recognized because of the cells\u2019 characteristic bipolar morphology and their radial floral-like arrangement. We used cell line that expresses GFP under SOX1 promoter. For majority of neural rosettes, we also verified their GFP signals. There are also non-rosette GFP positive cells, among which are new born neurons. New born neurons were identified based on their characteristic morphology, round-shaped cell body. The whole-cell recordings were performed at room temperature. Pipette electrodes (Sutter, Novato, CA) were fabricated using a Sutter P-97 horizontal puller and fire-polished and had final tip resistances of 2\u20134 M\u03a9. All recording have been performed using gap free protocol while the membrane potential was holding at \u221270 mV. The bath solution contained (in mM) NaCl 110, KCl 30, CaCl<sub>2</sub> 1.8, MgCl<sub>2</sub> 0.5, HEPES 5, and glucose 10, pH adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH. The internal solution for patch recordings contained (in mM) NaCl 10, KCl 130, MgCl<sub>2</sub> 0.5, HEPES 5, EGTA 1,and MgATP 5, pH adjusted to 7.3 with KOH. The applications of the activation and inhibition reagents were performed by a pressurized micro-perfusion system. The pressure was typically 7\u201310 kPa. The stock solutions were made by dissolving the reagents in the bath solution (GABA) or DMSO (bicuculline and selamectin). The stock solutions were kept at \u221280\u00b0C and were diluted to the working concentration using bath solution before each experiment. Unless otherwise indicated, we used 100 \u03bcM GABA, 100 \u03bcM bicuculline and 8 \u03bcM selamectin. The working solutions of bicuculline and selamectin contained up to 0.5% DMSO, therefore the bath solutions containing the corresponding concentration of DMSO were routinely used as control solution prior to the applications of bicuculline or selamectin."
