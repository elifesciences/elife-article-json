                    "text": "Loss of <i>Foxc1</i> is associated with Dandy-Walker malformation, the most common human cerebellar malformation characterized by cerebellar hypoplasia and an enlarged posterior fossa and fourth ventricle. Although expressed in the mouse posterior fossa mesenchyme, loss of <i>Foxc1</i> non-autonomously induces a rapid and devastating decrease in embryonic cerebellar ventricular zone radial glial proliferation and concurrent increase in cerebellar neuronal differentiation. Subsequent migration of cerebellar neurons is disrupted, associated with disordered radial glial morphology. In vitro, SDF1\u03b1, a direct Foxc1 target also expressed in the head mesenchyme, acts as a cerebellar radial glial mitogen and a chemoattractant for nascent Purkinje cells. Its receptor, Cxcr4, is expressed in cerebellar radial glial cells and conditional <i>Cxcr4</i> ablation with <i>Nes-Cre</i> mimics the <i>Foxc1</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> cerebellar phenotype. SDF1\u03b1 also rescues the <i>Foxc1</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> phenotype. Our data emphasizes that the head mesenchyme exerts a considerable influence on early embryonic brain development and its disruption contributes to neurodevelopmental disorders in humans."

                    "text": "Loss of <i>Foxc1</i> is associated with Dandy-Walker malformation, the most common human cerebellar malformation characterized by cerebellar hypoplasia and an enlarged posterior fossa and fourth ventricle. Although expressed in the mouse posterior fossa mesenchyme, loss of <i>Foxc1</i> non-autonomously induces a rapid and devastating decrease in embryonic cerebellar ventricular zone radial glial proliferation and concurrent increase in cerebellar neuronal differentiation. Subsequent migration of cerebellar neurons is disrupted, associated with disordered radial glial morphology. In vitro, SDF1\u03b1, a direct Foxc1 target also expressed in the head mesenchyme, acts as a cerebellar radial glial mitogen and a chemoattractant for nascent Purkinje cells. Its receptor, Cxcr4, is expressed in cerebellar radial glial cells and conditional <i>Cxcr4</i> ablation with <i>Nes-Cre</i> mimics the <i>Foxc1</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> cerebellar phenotype. SDF1\u03b1 also rescues the <i>Foxc1</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> phenotype. Our data emphasizes that the head mesenchyme exerts a considerable influence on early embryonic brain development and its disruption contributes to neurodevelopmental disorders in humans."

In mouse embryos<i>,</i> the gene that produces Foxc1 is not activated in the developing cerebellum itself, but rather in the adjacent mesenchyme, a primitive embryonic tissue that will develop into the membranes that cover the brain and the skull bones that define the posterior fossa.

These are \u2018progenitor\u2019 cells that develop into the various types of cell found in the cerebellum, and also act as a scaffold for other neurons to migrate across. Therefore, the loss of radial glial cells in Foxc1-deficient mice substantially disrupts how the cerebellum develops, and how the neurons in the cerebellum work."

This protein is released from the tissue that will develop into the posterior fossa, and binds to a receptor protein that is present on radial glial cells in the cerebellum. When this binding occurs, the radial glial cells grow and divide, and so the embryo's cerebellum also grows. Haldipur et al. found that mouse embryos specifically missing this receptor develop many of the abnormalities seen in Foxc1-deficient mice and further, when SDF1-alpha was provided back into Foxc1-deficient cerebella, the defects were rescued. This suggests that the cerebellar defects caused by the loss of Foxc1 stem from disrupting the signalling pathways that are triggered by the interaction between SDF1-alpha and its receptor."

Heterozygous loss of the <i>Foxc1</i> gene contributes to DWM. Although loss of this transcription factor causes significant developmental cerebellar pathology in humans and mice, in mice, its expression is limited to vascular pericytes within the developing cerebellum. In contrast, <i>Foxc1</i> is widely expressed in the posterior fossa mesenchyme surrounding the cerebellar anlage beginning after e12.5 in mice. We therefore hypothesized that disrupted <i>Foxc1</i>-dependent signalling from the posterior fossa head mesenchyme to the adjacent developing cerebellum is key to the DWM phenotype. We previously reported reduced mesenchymal expression of several secreted factors in the mouse Foxc1 e12.5 mutant posterior fossa including Bmp 2, 4 and SDF1\u03b1 (<a href=\"#bib3\">Aldinger et al., 2009</a>). However, <i>Foxc1</i> mutant cerebellar developmental abnormalities were not fully investigated and the relevance of these mesenchymal expression changes remained unexplored."

Initial neurogenesis in the cerebellar anlage occurs in two distinct germinal zones. The cerebellar ventricular zone gives rise to waves of GABAergic neurons including cerebellar Purkinje cells which migrate radially away from the ventricular zone into the developing cerebellar cortex (<a href=\"#bib41\">Seto et al., 2014</a>). The cerebellar rhombic lip gives rise to cerebellar glutamatergic neurons including cerebellar granule neuron progenitors (GNPs), which migrate tangentially over the developing anlage to form the external granule layer (EGL). From the EGL, newly born granule cells migrate inward radially to form the mature internal granule layer (<a href=\"#bib31\">Millen and Gleeson, 2008</a>). Extrinsic signalling has previously been implicated in some aspects of mouse cerebellar development. Transventricular Shh from the choroid plexus regulates cerebellar ventricular zone proliferation from e14.5 (<a href=\"#bib20\">Huang et al., 2010</a>). Mesenchymal Bmp signals induce the cerebellar rhombic lip around e10.5 in mice (<a href=\"#bib1\">Alder et al., 1996</a>, <a href=\"#bib2\">1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Fernandes et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Tong and Kwan, 2013</a>). Additionally, meningeal SDF1\u03b1 has a chemoattractive role in both the tangential migration of GNPs away from the rhombic lip to form the EGL from e12.5, as well as a later role in maintaining their proliferative niche adjacent at the pial surface within the EGL (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hartmann et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Ma et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Zou et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Klein et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Reiss et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Zhu et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Vilz et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Tiveron and Cremer, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Yu et al., 2010</a>)."

This analysis uncovered a dramatic deficit in cerebellar ventricular zone radial glial cell proliferation and differentiation during early cerebellar anlage development. Using a combination of in vitro and in vivo assays, we next determined that SDF1\u03b1, a direct transcriptional target of Foxc1 (<a href=\"#bib54\">Zarbalis et al., 2012</a>) is a major effector of Foxc1 cerebellar pathogenesis. SDF1\u03b1 secreted by the posterior fossa mesenchyme acts through Cxcr4 in cerebellar radial glial cells to drive their proliferation and hence embryonic cerebellar anlage growth. We also show that SDF1\u03b1\u2212Cxcr4 signalling is required to maintain the radial glial scaffold for ventricular zone derived neuronal migration. These studies dramatically expand the known roles of SDF1\u03b1-Cxcr4 signalling to encompass almost every major developmental program of cerebellar development."

RG cells serve as both neuronal progenitors (<a href=\"#bib13\">Feng et al., 1994</a>) and a scaffold for Purkinje cell neurons as they migrate towards the cerebellar cortex (<a href=\"#bib53\">Yuasa et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Hatten, 1999</a>) while BG serve as a scaffold for migrating granule neurons from the EGL. In wild-type animals at e13.5 and e15.5, the nestin-positive soma of RG were located in the ventricular zone with radial fibers extending to the NTZ or pial surface (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, arrows). By e15.5, plentiful nestin-positive radial glial fibers extending from the ventricular surface to the pial surface were apparent in the wild-type anterior cerebellar anlage (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C\u2013C\u2032</a>, arrows). However, by e17.5, radial glial cells in the posterior wild-type anlage transitioned into Bergmann Glial cells with radial fibers spanning just the presumptive molecular layer in the developing cerebellar cortex (<a href=\"#bib27\">Li et al., 2014</a>) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E,G</a>; arrows). In <i>Foxc1</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mutants at e13.5, nestin-positive staining was evident; however extended radial fibers were absent (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). By e15.5 nestin-positive fibers were discontinuous with very few extending to the pial surface (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D,D\u2032</a>, arrows). A similar absence of long radial fibers was evident in the e17.5 mutant (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>, arrows). Additionally, Bergmann glial morphology and arrangement were found to be disrupted in the <i>Foxc1</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mutant (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F\u2013H,J\u2013M</a>, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3K,M</a>; arrows). In the WT, BG were found to overlap with the PL (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E,G,J,L</a>), while in the <i>Foxc1</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mutant cells were found to be present ectopically in the EGL and ML indicating abnormal migration (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3K,M</a>). These changes were accompanied by increased cell death in the ventricular zone of <i>Foxc1</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mutants as measured by TUNEL labeling (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3I</a>). Together, our results suggest that the disruption of radial glial migratory scaffold in <i>Foxc1</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mutants contributes to aberrant PC migratory phenotypes in <i>Foxc1</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mutant mice, which in turn also contribute to an abnormal BG phenotype."

The embryonic cerebellar ventricular zone does not express Bmp-receptors although they are expressed in the rhombic lip (<a href=\"#bib29\">Machold et al., 2007</a>). In contrast, the SDF1\u03b1 receptor, Cxcr4 is highly expressed in the embryonic ventricular zone (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> and data not shown). Addition of SDF1\u03b1 significantly increased cell division in primary dissociated cultures of the wild-type e13.5 cerebellar anlage. Blocking SDF1\u03b1 function using the Cxcr4 receptor antagonist AMD 3100 (<a href=\"#bib37\">Rosenkilde et al., 2004</a>), significantly inhibited BrdU uptake in these cultures (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). The majority of cerebellar progenitors at e13.5 derive from the cerebellar ventricular zone, although both cerebellar rhombic lip progenitors and a small number of granule cell progenitors are also present at this time. To determine if the anti-proliferative AMD3100 could specifically alter cerebellar ventricular zone proliferation, we cultured whole e13.5 cerebellar anlage explants in serum containing media with or without AMD 3100 for 24 hr. Subsequent sections of these whole mount cerebellar cultures revealed that blockage of the SDF1\u03b1-Cxcr4 signalling pathway caused a significant increase in ventricular zone neuronal differentiation and reduced proliferation. (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,C\u2013F</a>)."

Earlier, it also acts as a chemoattractant for cells migrating from the RL to form the EGL (<a href=\"#bib52\">Yu et al., 2010</a>). Since we observed Purkinje cell migration deficits in <i>Foxc1</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mutants, we assessed if SDF1\u03b1 has yet another role, acting as a pial surface chemoattractant to differentiating ventricular zone derived cells. Indeed, SDF1\u03b1 significantly increased the number of e13.5 dissociated cerebellar cells that migrated through a membrane in a standard transwell migration assay. Further, addition of AMD 3100 to cells in the upper chamber significantly reduced the number of migrating cells. (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G,H</a>). To confirm that the cells that were responsive to SDF1\u03b1 responsive cells were indeed cells arising from the ventricular zone and not just the rhombic lip, we performed a matrigel migration assay using explanted e13.5 cerebellar anlage where ventricular zone derived cells were lineally labelled by a Td-tomato reporter (Ptf1a cre/+; Ai14) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4I</a>). Labelled e13.5 explants were embedded in matrigel adjacent to acrylic beads coated with saline or SDF1\u03b1 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4J,K</a>). After 48 hr, Td-tomato positive cells were specifically directed towards the source of SDF1\u03b1 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4K,K\u2032,K\u2032\u2032</a>). Thus, not only can SDF1\u03b1 promote cerebellar ventricular zone progenitor proliferation, it can also function as a chemoattractant to cerebellar ventricular zone derived cells."

Using a BAC transgenic mouse encoding an SDF1\u03b1:mRFP fusion protein (<a href=\"#bib21\">Jung et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Mithal et al., 2013</a>), we confirmed that SDF1\u03b1 protein is expressed in mesenchymal cells adjacent to the cerebellar anlage at e13.5. In addition, we observed scattered RFP-positive cells, likely pericytes, within the cerebellar anlage at this stage (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, arrow).

Concurrently, there was an extensive increase in numbers of differentiated \u03b2-III tubulin positive cells at e13.5 and e15.5. Similar to Foxc1 null mutants, numerous \u03b2-III tubulin -positive cells were also ectopically interspersed throughout the diminished Cxcr4 CKO mutant ventricular zone at both stages (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F,H</a>, Boxed area). Again, similar to <i>Foxc1</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mutant few calbindin-positive Purkinje cells were present at e15.5 in the Cxcr4 CKO and those remaining were scattered throughout the anlage and located adjacent to the pia (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6L</a>, arrow), instead of remaining in a domain more closely associated with the ventricular zone as in wild-type cerebella (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6K</a>, arrow). Although many nestin-positive radial glial cells were present in the Cxcr4-CKO mutant at e13.5 and e15.5, long radial glial fibers were not present at either stage (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6M\u2013P</a>). Notably, radial glial fibers were still readily detected in the midbrain (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6N</a>, arrows). As seen in the <i>Foxc1</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mutant, increased cell death was also observed in the Cxcr4 CKO ventricular zone compared to control at e13.5 and e15.5 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6J</a>). In contrast to the <i>Foxc1</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mutant cerebellum however, nests of ectopic proliferating granule cell progenitors were present within the <i>Cxcr4-Nes-Cre</i> mutant cerebellar anlage at this stage, as others have previously reported (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>, asterisk). Bergmann glia were found ectopically located in the EGL similar to the <i>Foxc1</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mutant (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6R</a>, arrows). We conclude that loss of <i>Cxcr4</i> in the nestin-expressing radial glial cells recapitulates multiple aspects of the <i>Foxc1</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mutant cerebellar phenotype. The striking similarities of these mutant cerebellar phenotypes strongly argues that Foxc1-dependent SDF1\u03b1 secretion by the posterior fossa head mesenchyme and its reception by Cxcr4 in adjacent early cerebellar anlage radial glial cells, represent a major downstream effector pathway mediating Foxc1 Dandy-Walker cerebellar pathogenesis"

Not only is it required to maintain radial glia and their processes, it also functions as a chemoattractant to neurons migrating away from the ventricular zone.

Increased cell death and dysmorphic radial glial fibers are also observed. GCs migrating out of the RL into the EGL follow abnormal paths away from the pial surface into the interior of the cerebellar anlage.

Although extensive cerebellar pathology results from the loss of <i>Foxc1</i>, in the mouse, <i>Foxc1</i> is not highly expressed in the cerebellar anlage, but rather is expressed in the posterior fossa mesenchyme overlying the developing cerebellar anlage beginning at e12.5. This finding leads to the hypothesis that disrupted mesenchyme to brain signalling caused the <i>Foxc1</i> mutant cerebellar phenotype. We previously reported disorganization of the cerebellar RL and nascent EGL located directly adjacent to the mesenchyme by e14.5 (<a href=\"#bib3\">Aldinger et al., 2009</a>). We now find that the cerebellar ventricular zone is not insulated from loss of <i>Foxc1</i> despite its distance from the posterior fossa mesenchyme. Indeed, <i>Foxc1</i> null mutants have an early and devastating reduction in ventricular zone radial glial cell proliferation, increased cell death and increased differentiation at e13.5, 1 day after failure of normal initiation of expression of <i>Foxc1</i> in the posterior fossa mesenchyme. At later stages, residual ventricular zone derived Purkinje cells in the mutant display migratory deficits which correlate with loss of radial glial fibers which normally serve as a scaffold for neuronal migration. Using in vitro and in vivo assays, we demonstrated that SDF1\u03b1, a direct target of Foxc1 in head mesenchyme (<a href=\"#bib54\">Zarbalis et al., 2012</a>), via its receptor, Cxcr4 is a major effector of Foxc1-dependent mesenchymal signalling. Cxcr4 is expressed in ventricular zone progenitors, including the radial glial fibers and their endfeet which associate with the developing pia. Loss of cerebellar Cxcr4 largely phenocopies the <i>Foxc1</i> null phenotype and the <i>Foxc1</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> phenotype can be rescued by the addition of SDF1\u03b1. Together, our data demonstrates SDF1\u03b1-Cxcr4 signalling is a major downstream effector of mesenchymal Foxc1 function and is required to maintain both radial glial proliferative and scaffolding functions in the early cerebellar anlage."

In vivo, published in situ data together with new protein expression analysis demonstrated the presence of Cxcr4 in the cerebellar ventricular zone throughout embryogenesis.

In the early postnatal cerebellum, SDF1\u03b1 also exerts an influence on GNPs of the outer EGL which lie directly underneath the pial surface. Loss of SDF1\u03b1 or Cxcr4 in the cerebellum causes GNPs to prematurely leave their EGL proliferative niche, resulting in ectopic proliferation and dramatic disruptions of the laminar structure of the resultant cerebellum (<a href=\"#bib28\">Ma et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Zou et al., 1998</a>).

This difference may reflect the residual SDF1\u03b1-Cxcr4 signalling in the Foxc1 mutants (<a href=\"#bib3\">Aldinger et al., 2009</a>), vs complete loss in the Cxcr4 CKO. Taken together with other published studies, we conclude that embryonic cerebellar anlage size is regulated by a number of extra-cerebellar signalling systems. Wnt signals derived from both the isthmic organizer (<a href=\"#bib40\">Sato et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Sato and Joyner, 2009</a>) and the early dorsal roof plate (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chizhikov et al., 2006</a>) determine the initial size of the anlage from \u223ce9.0. We have now demonstrated that mesenchymal SDF1\u03b1 signalling is a major driver of early anlage growth from \u223ce12.5. Late embryonic anlage ventricular zone proliferation is influenced by Shh derived from the differentiating choroid plexus from e14.5 (<a href=\"#bib20\">Huang et al., 2010</a>). An outstanding issue remains how each of these signalling systems are coordinately regulated and integrated across embryogenesis to orchestrate normal anlage development."

We observed aberrant migration of Purkinje cells in both Foxc1 null and Cxcr4; nestin-cre mutants, in addition to dysmorphic radial glial fibers. Abnormal migration of cells out of the ventricular zone could be due to the absence or downregulation of SDF1\u03b1 chemoattraction from the mesenchyme and derived meninges. This is buttressed by the fact that blockage of SDF1\u03b1 led to a significant reduction in migration of single cells in the in vitro transwell migration assay. Also, in the matrigel assay, when embryonic cerebellar slices were placed in close proximity with SDF1\u03b1 coated acrylic beads, explant cells and fibers migrated in the direction of the SDF1\u03b1 source. However, our protein expression data using Cxcr4 antibodies, in addition to Cxcr4-GFP transgenic mice indicate that Cxcr4 is also strongly expressed in radial glial fibers themselves. As early as e13.5 and more prominently by e15.5, radial glial fibers were discontinuous and did not extend all the way to the basement membrane of the pia. We conclude that SDF1\u03b1 secreted by the mesenchyme binds to the receptor on the radial fibers to relay signals that are directly required to maintain these radial fibers as a substrate for migration. Indeed in the spinal cord, SDF1\u03b1 protein is detectable in radial end feet and transcytosis across the radial glial length is also observed (<a href=\"#bib32\">Mithal et al., 2013</a>)."

Studies have also shown that the association of BG with PCs greatly contributes to their structural and functional maintenance. Sonic hedgehog secretion by PCs also helps maintain BG in the cerebellum. It is hence plausible that the BG phenotype may be secondary to abnormal RG and PCs. Fate mapping studies have shown that Bergmann glial cells are normally born between e13.5 and e14.5 in the mouse cerebellum (<a href=\"#bib43\">Sudarov et al., 2011</a>). It is also possible that continued SDF1\u03b1-Cxcr4 signalling is actively required for the differentiation of BG from RG. Further analysis is required to distinguish these two possibilities. Regardless, it is certain that a lack of normal Bergmann glial fibers further contributes to the abnormal lamination in neonatal SDF1\u03b1 and Cxcr4 mutant animals as these fibers are normally required for the inward migration of EGL cells to form the internal granule layer."

In the cerebellum, loss of SDF1\u03b1 signalling causes immediate and catastrophic cell cycle exit of radial glial cells and corresponding increased neuronal differentiation. Rapid loss of radial glial fiber morphology is also observed. Loss of SDF1\u03b1 signalling in the forebrain has not been reported to cause microcephaly in mice, and we have shown here that midbrain radial glial cells are relatively unaffected (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6N</a>). A recent study (<a href=\"#bib32\">Mithal et al., 2013</a>) reported that loss of radial glial Cxcr4 in spinal cord radial glial cells causes disruption of radial glial morphology and reduced mitosis in the ventral ventricular zone by e14.5. However, in the spinal cord by this stage a large number of spinal cord neuronal populations have already been generated (<a href=\"#bib44\">Tanabe and Jessell, 1996</a>). Although late born populations such as oligodendrocyte lineages are altered, there are not dramatic morphological consequences. The disproportionate mouse cerebellar phenotypes we report here with loss of Foxc1 and Cxcr4 beautifully model the CNS phenotype of Dandy-Walker malformation patients, where the cerebellum is disproportionately diminished in size and altered in morphology relative to other CNS structures. The reasons for the region-specific sensitivities to loss of the SDF1\u03b1-Cxcr4 signalling remain unknown and may simply reflect regional differences in the timing of proliferative epochs relative to the onset of SDF1\u03b1 and Cxcr4 expression.

The primary antibodies used in this study were BrdU (Abcam, Cambridge, UK; 1:50), \u03b2-III Tubulin (Promega, Madison, WI, USA; 1:1000), Calbindin (Swant, Switzerland; 1:3000), Cxcr4 (Abcam\u20141:100), BLBP (Abcam\u20141:100), Ki67 (Vector\u20141:300), Laminin (Sigma\u20141:25), Raldh2 (Sigma\u20141:400), Pdfgr1 (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA\u20141:200) and Nestin (Millipore, Germany; 1:200). The following day, the following species and subtype appropriate secondary antibodies were used\u2014biotinylated (1:250, Vector laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) or fluorescent dye labelled (Alexa fluors 488 and 594, 1:1000, Molecular probes, Grand Island, NY, USA). Sections were counter stained with DAPI using in Vectashield mounting media with DAPI (4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) (Vector laboratories) or DPX (Distyrene. Plasticizer. Xylene) mounting medium. For each antibody, one section was used as a negative control where in the section was incubated with all the above solutions except the primary antibody. For BrdU immunohistochemistry, sections were treated with 1N HCl for 10 min on ice, 2 N HCl for 30 min at RT, and washed with Borate buffer prior to blocking. TUNEL assay was carried out In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit, TMR red (Roche, Germany). Briefly, cerebellar sections were incubated in the TUNEL mix (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase in storage buffer and TMR red labeled-nucleotide mixture in reaction buffer) for 1 hr at RT. The slides were washed with PBS and mounted with Vectashield mounting media containing DAPI or Propidium Iodide."

All embryos were sectioned at 11 microns sagittally. Sections between WT and mutant were carefully chosen to represent the same orientation along the mediolateral axis. To minimize bias, blind counts were performed. To evaluate proliferation and differentiation, the total number of Ki67, BrdU and Tuj1 positive cells in the ventricular zone was counted. This was followed by a total DAPI count that represented the total cell count in the ventricular zone. The percentage of proliferating and differentiating cells in the ventricular zone was represented in the graph. For cell death, the total number of TUNEL positive cells that spanned the entire length of the ventricular zone was counted. Data are represented as mean \u00b1 s.e.m. Statistical significance was determined by two tailed t-test. p &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant."

While this observation supports the model, it does not necessarily prove that the <i>FoxC1</i> VZ phenotype is caused by demised Sdf1a expression in the meninges. One complication is that <i>FoxC1</i> is required for development of meninges in the forebrain where it regulates production of RA for proper radial glial cell development (Cell, 139: 597, 2009). If development of cerebellar meninges is similarly disrupted, then the authors need to consider the possibility that VZ phenotype in <i>FoxC1</i> mutants is caused by other factors in the meninges that are independent of Sdf1a."

One reviewer was previously concerned about whether <i>FoxC1-KO</i> and <i>Cxcr4-KO</i> mutants have the same phenotype, including cell proliferation, Bergmann glia and Purkinje cell formation. The new data provided in the revision has partially addressed this concern. However both of the reviewers and the BRE feel that data relating to the meninges is lacking and severely reduces enthusiasm for the study. Although it is formally possible that <i>FoxC1-KO</i> disrupts other signaling molecules in the meninges, RA is an unlikely candidate. In the forebrain, loss of RA signaling due to <i>FoxC1-KO</i> blocks neurogenesis, which is very different from what is found in the cerebellum. As raised in the initial review, it is important to show normal formation of the meninges and the new data does not address this issue. This would require analysis with meninges markers. The reviewers are not convinced that the <i>FoxC1</i> phenotype is caused by Sdf1 and whether Sdf1 expression is indeed regulated by <i>FoxC1</i>. There is no data confirming that Sdf1 expression is abolished in <i>FoxC1</i> meninges. The cerebellum phenotype in <i>Cxcr4</i> mutants seems to be similar to that of <i>FoxC1</i> mutants. However, the <i>FoxC1</i> mutant cerebellum is much more severe, with the basement membrane clearly detached from the pial surface (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>), which would invariably disrupt Bergmann glial end feet attachment, likely causing their mis-localization. In summary, there is concern over major conclusions without a clear indication that meninges development is not compromised. In the absence of this evidence, the study cannot rule out the involvement of other factors derived from the meninges; hence the recommendation to reject the study at this stage."

Although it is formally possible that</i> FoxC1-<i>KO disrupts other signaling molecules in the meninges, RA is an unlikely candidate. In the forebrain, loss of RA signaling due to</i> FoxC1-<i>KO blocks neurogenesis, which is very different from what is found in the cerebellum. As raised in the initial review, it is important to show normal formation of the meninges and the new data does not address this issue. This would require analysis with meninges markers. The reviewers are not convinced that the</i> FoxC1 <i>phenotype is caused by Sdf1 and whether Sdf1 expression is indeed regulated by</i> FoxC1<i>.

In summary, there is concern over major conclusions without a clear indication that meninges development is not compromised.
