This noise limits the capacity of the neural code and determines how information can be transmitted and read-out. To accurately decode, the brain must overcome this noise and identify which patterns are semantically similar. We use models of network encoding noise to learn a thesaurus for populations of neurons in the vertebrate retina responding to artificial and natural videos, measuring the similarity between population responses to visual stimuli based on the information they carry. This thesaurus reveals that the code is organized in clusters of synonymous activity patterns that are similar in meaning but may differ considerably in their structure. This organization is highly reminiscent of the design of engineered codes. We suggest that the brain may use this structure and show how it allows accurate decoding of novel stimuli from novel spiking patterns."

In other words, we need to understand network noise well enough to know which patterns are likely to be interchanged in encoding the same stimulus. Several studies suggested intuitive and computationally efficient measures of spike train similarity (<a href=\"#bib68\">Victor and Purpura, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">van Rossum, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Houghton and Sen, 2008</a>). However, they mostly focused on single neurons and often assumed the functional form of similarity between responses. Despite their computational simplicity, it is not clear whether such simple metrics can adequately represent similarity between neural responses. The Hamming distance, for example, is a very intuitive measure of similarity between population activity patterns, simply defined as the number of neurons that switch state from spiking to silence and vice versa. Yet, it measures similarity in form, or syntactic similarity, but not necessarily similarity in meaning, that is, semantic similarity (<a href=\"#bib28\">Huth et al., 2012</a>). This would be analogous to suggesting that \u2018night\u2019 and \u2018light\u2019 are similar in meaning because they differ by just one letter.

For pairs of neurons, average noise correlations are typically weak (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cafaro and Rieke, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Ecker et al., 2010</a>), implying that pairs of neurons are not far from being conditionally independent given the stimulus.

However, weak pairwise correlations do not imply that large groups are conditionally independent in encoding stimuli (<a href=\"#bib49\">Schneidman et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Pillow et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Vidne et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Granot-Atedgi et al., 2013</a>).

We note that <i>I</i>(<i>r|s</i>) measures the total correlations of all orders among the cells. We found that most stimuli did not evoke a substantial response from the retina, which gave rise to low noise correlation in the network for these stimuli. However, when something \u2018interesting\u2019 happened in the video and the ganglion cells increased their firing rates, we found a sharp increase in the degree of network noise correlations for both natural and artificial videos (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>; see <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a> for analysis of sampling properties). Thus, while on average the network noise correlations may be weak, the population was strongly correlated and far from conditionally independent in response to interesting stimuli. In other words, for these stimuli, the variability or noise at the level of the network is significantly reduced compared to what would be expected from the apparent noise level of individual cells."

This is a general framework for mapping the codebook in any sensory system, since it makes no assumptions about what makes two spike trains similar, or that the similarity structure should obey a metric in the strict mathematical sense. Indeed, it revealed that the neural code of the brain is very different than our usual mathematical intuition: what we may regard as intuitive measures, like the Hamming distance, fail to capture the similarity between neural population responses. Instead, we found a highly structured codebook, organized in groups of responses that carry very similar information, and are distinct from all other responses."

There, to overcome noise, different codewords are placed far apart in space of codewords, to allow for error-correction. Since noise may corrupt a message that is sent through a channel, when a pattern is received, it is compared to all possible codewords and is classified according to the nearest one. Importantly, the distance between codewords must be defined by the nature of the noise. Here, we found a neural population code that seems to be built along similar lines. Our thesaurus revealed that most of the information that the population encodes is held by the identity of the cluster that a specific activity pattern belongs to, and that more detailed information may be carried by the fine structure of the pattern. These results generalized across novel stimuli and scaled slowly with the number of stimuli used (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We thus suggest that our analysis reveals a design principle of the population codebook of a sensory circuit."

We note that for a large neural population, most network activity patterns are observed at most once (<a href=\"#bib20\">Ganmor et al., 2011a</a>). Thus, the brain frequently receives from its sensory neurons activity patterns that were never seen before. This may occur either due to sensory noise, corrupting the response to a known stimulus but also as a result of a truly novel stimulus. In either case, a semantic similarity measure between neural population responses may explain how these novel inputs may be deciphered: when a novel response pattern is encountered it can take on the information content of similar responses, whose meaning is already known. Therefore, the thesaurus may not only explain how sensory noise can be overcome but also how the brain can generalize across stimuli. Indeed, the thesaurus enabled us to decode neural activity patterns we have not seen before, based on their similarity to other responses."

These results are surprisingly given that the cells were clearly not conditionally independent. One possible explanation is that the organization of the codebook may be so robust, namely that the separation between clusters is sufficiently large, that even an inaccurate model can capture the identity clusters because the errors of the model are smaller than the distance between clusters. The results of (<a href=\"#bib53\">Schwartz et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Granot-Atedgi et al., 2013</a>) suggest that the contribution of noise correlations to shaping the population response to stimuli will increase significantly with network size. Since by definition, the conditional independent model implies larger encoding noise (noise entropy), this suggests that the clusters would be \u2018wider\u2019 in this case. It would therefore be most interesting to explore the thesaurus that these models would give for larger populations of cells, beyond groups of 20 cells that we used here for sampling reasons.

First, our clustering was not optimized to maximize the information that the clusters carry about the stimulus, but only to group similar responses together. Interestingly, such an information maximization clustering approach (<a href=\"#bib55\">Slonim and Tishby, 1999</a>) does not result in significantly more information using fewer clusters (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

The stimulus was projected onto the salamander retina from a CRT video monitor (ViewSonic G90fB) at a frame rate of 60 Hz such that each acquired frame was presented twice, using standard optics (<a href=\"#bib45\">Puchalla et al., 2005</a>). The original color videos were converted to gray scale, using a gamma correction for the computer monitor. Artificial full-field flicker stimuli were generated by sampling a uniform gray level from a normal distribution. In both cases, the visual stimulus covered the retinal patch that was used for the experiment entirely. A 10 s clip was taken from each video and played to separate retinas repetitively for approximately 2 hr. Each video was therefore replayed to the retina over 600 times."

Two nodes were connected if their dissimilarity was smaller than 0.5 bits (epsilon neighborhood). <i>Isomap</i> was chosen over multi dimensional scaling approaches as it gave better results, in particular since dissimilarities are bounded from above (1 bit maximum).
