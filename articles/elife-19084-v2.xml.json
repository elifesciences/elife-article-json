We have discovered that human cell lines in culture proliferate with intact chromosomal origins of replication after disruption of both alleles of <i>ORC2</i> or of the ATPase subunit, <i>ORC1</i>. The <i>ORC1</i> or <i>ORC2</i>-depleted cells replicate with decreased chromatin loading of MCM2-7 and become critically dependent on another ATPase, CDC6, for survival and DNA replication. Thus, either the ORC ring lacking a subunit, even its ATPase subunit, can load enough MCM2-7 in partnership with CDC6 to initiate DNA replication, or cells have an ORC-independent, CDC6-dependent mechanism to load MCM2-7 on origins of replication"

We have discovered that human cell lines in culture proliferate with intact chromosomal origins of replication after disruption of both alleles of <i>ORC2</i> or of the ATPase subunit, <i>ORC1</i>. The <i>ORC1</i> or <i>ORC2</i>-depleted cells replicate with decreased chromatin loading of MCM2-7 and become critically dependent on another ATPase, CDC6, for survival and DNA replication. Thus, either the ORC ring lacking a subunit, even its ATPase subunit, can load enough MCM2-7 in partnership with CDC6 to initiate DNA replication, or cells have an ORC-independent, CDC6-dependent mechanism to load MCM2-7 on origins of replication"

This process begins at multiple sites (known as origins) on each chromosome. A group of six proteins collectively known as the Origin Recognition Complex (or ORC for short) binds to an origin and then recruits several additional proteins. When the cell is ready, the assembled proteins are activated and DNA copying begins. It is thought that all of the ORC proteins are essential for cells to survive and copy their DNA."

ORC is an essential six-subunit, ring-shaped ATPase complex that recruits and co-operates with the CDC6 protein to promote the loading of CDT1 and then the MCM2-7 subunits of the replicative helicase during the \u2018licensing\u2019 of origins of replication (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bleichert et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Yeeles et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Bell and Stillman, 1992</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib4\">\u00a0Blow and Tada, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Masai et al., 2010</a>). Of the six subunits of human ORC, ORC2-5 form a tight core complex (<a href=\"#bib9\">Dhar et al., 2001</a>). ORC1 is the only subunit responsible for the ATPase activity of ORC (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chesnokov et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Giordano-Coltart et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Klemm et al., 1997</a>) All six ORC subunit genes are essential for the viability of <i>S. cerevisiae</i> and <i>S. pombe</i> (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bell et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Foss et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Herskowitz, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Loo et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Micklem et al., 1993</a>). It is therefore expected that eukaryotic cells will not be viable, and will not replicate, if any of the ORC subunit genes are deleted. However, we have now deleted both alleles of human <i>ORC2</i> or of <i>ORC1,</i> to discover that cells can still survive and replicate in the complete absence of either of these two critical subunits of Origin Recognition Complex."

Taking into consideration repetitive DNA and the diploid nature of the human genome, this method also suggests that about 52,000 origins are fired in the <i>ORC2-/-</i> cells. 40% of the BrIP-seq peaks in <i>ORC2-/-</i> cells overlapped with that in WT cells, comparable to the overlap reported among origins mapped by different groups (<a href=\"#bib13\">Karnani et al., 2010</a>). The\u00a0&lt;100% of overlap is explained by plasticity of origin usage (<a href=\"#bib6\">Cadoret et al., 2008</a>). The inter-origin distances for the BrIPseq origins in <i>ORC2-/-</i> cells (26 kb) were slightly longer than in the WT (25 kb) cells (P value\u00a0~4.3e-07, Wilcoxon rank sum test) and the chromosome-by-chromosome distribution of inter-origin distances was similar to that in WT cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>). The 4-fold shorter inter-origin distance in a population-based approach of origin mapping (BrIPseq) compared to molecular combing is also due to the plasticity of origin usage: only one out of four possible origins in a single DNA segment fire in one S phase, while all four origins are used in the entire population of cells (see discussion in <a href=\"#bib13\">Karnani et al., 2010</a>). Origins are enriched in gene-rich domains and near transcription start sites (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H and I</a>) as reported in previous studies (<a href=\"#bib13\">Karnani et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Cadoret et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Danis et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">MacAlpine et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Mesner et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Sequeira-Mendes et al., 2009</a>)."

Although we believe that no ORC2 protein is synthesized in the <i>ORC2-/-</i> cells, we have to entertain the caveat that up to 1530 ORC2 molecules can escape the limits of detection with our current antibodies. This number is still too few to license the 52,000 origins of replication mapped by two independent methods. It is unlikely that a single ORC complex can catalytically load thirty-five MCM2-7 hexamers distributed 100 kb apart over 3.5 Mb of chromosomal DNA."

To reach that conclusion we have to successfully delete both alleles of the other four subunits, <i>ORC3-6.</i> However, even if the remaining ORC subunits are functional for loading MCM2-7 our result requires reconsideration of existing models of ORC function in replication initiation. (1) The crystal structure suggests that ORC2-3-5-4-1 are arranged in a gapped ring (with a central channel that is wide enough to surround a DNA double-helix), and that later in licensing, CDC6 slips into the gap between ORC2 and ORC1 to close the gap. The ORC-CDC6 ring is proposed to interact with the MCM2-7 ring end-on-end during the loading of MCM2-7 (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bleichert et al., 2015</a>). Loss of one subunit in the five-membered ORC ring makes it difficult for the remaining subunits to form a ring large enough (i) to surround a DNA double-helix in the same manner as wild type ORC or (ii) to interact with the MCM2-7 ring end-on-end. (2) Human ORC1 and ORC4 are the only subunits that have intact Walker A and B motifs. Multiple groups have shown that the ATPase activity of ORC (in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, in <i>D. melanogaster</i> and in <i>H. sapiens</i>) depends exclusively on the Walker A and B motifs of the ORC1 subunit, and that this ATP binding and hydrolysis activity is essential for ORC function (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chesnokov et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Giordano-Coltart et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Klemm et al., 1997</a>). Even if an altered or partial ORC is initiating replication, we have to conclude that any ATPase activity necessary can be provided by ORC4 or CDC6."

However the paper did not show the sensitivity of the western-blot to measure the level of residual ORC, so that it is theoretically possible that there was enough residual maternal ORC in the endoreplicating cells."

The surprise is that inefficient MCM2-7 loading, perhaps with the help of CDC6, is sufficient for replication initiation and cell survival in the absence of six-subunit ORC. The other surprise is that the six-subunit ORC does not appear to associate with chromatin as a holocomplex. Clearly ORC6 associates with chromatin normally despite a decrease in ORC1 (in the <i>ORC2-/-</i> or <i>ORC1-/-</i> cells) or ORC2-5 loading (in the <i>ORC2-/-</i> cells). Similarly ORC2-5 loading is independent of ORC1 loading (in the <i>ORC1-/-</i> cells)."

In summary, we suggest that the absolute requirement for six-subunit ORC for licensing bi-directional origins of replication can be bypassed in some cell lines."

After adding 0.1% Triton X-100, cells were incubated for 5 min on ice and centrifuge at 1300 g, 4\u00b0C. Supernatants were further clarified by centrifugation at 20000 g, 4\u00b0C (S2). Pellets (Nuclei) were washed in buffer A and lysed in buffer B (3 mM EDTA, 0.2 mM, EGTA, 1 mM DTT, protease inhibitor cockatil). After incubation for 30 min on ice, lysate was centrifuged at 1700 g, 4\u00b0C. Pellets (chromatin) were washed in buffer B and lysed in 2 x SDS sample buffer and sonicated (P3)."

ORC is an essential replication protein in simple eukaryotes where origins of replication are defined by specific sequences. In contrast, higher eukaryotes lack a consensus sequence that defines origins and the molecular determinants of the sites of replication initiation in these organisms remain murky. The authors make the intriguing finding that deletions of either the ORC1 or the ORC2 gene are not lethal in human tissue culture cells. They go on to show that loading of the essential Mcm2-7 helicase occurs at reduced levels in these strains but residual loading is observed. Because the chromatin association of Cdc6 and Cdt1, two other helicase-loading proteins is unaffected, the authors suggest that continued association of these proteins mediates the residual Mcm2-7 loading. Intriguingly, depletion of Cdc6 reduced but did not eliminate replication in these cells (perhaps due to incomplete depletion)."

The authors have also done well to show that their deletions are complete and there is not large amounts the proteins retained in the targeted cells. What is less clear is the method by which the residual Mcm2-7 is being loaded. Clearly Cdc6 is still playing a role but whether the remaining ORC subunits are capable of assisting with this is not clear. It would significantly strengthen the paper to show that siRNA of other ORC subunits does not have the same effect as there is either substantial (ORC1 deletion) or residual (ORC2 deletion) binding of other ORC subunits in each case. Overall, this part of the paper convincingly shows that there are other pathways than the canonical ORC-dependent ones to initiate replication."

The authors suggest that ORC is \"critical for the regulation of these genes,\" however, they do not discuss the possibility that the changes in cell cycle progression as a possible reason for these changes.

This is an important and surprising insight into the mechanism of initiation in mammalian cells and is consistent with previous data from this lab and in <i>Drosophila</i> that there could be ORC-independent mechanisms for replication initiation. It remains to be demonstrated whether the residual DNA replication observed is independent of the other ORC subunits (that is truly ORC- independent) or not (this would require double mutants in ORC \u2013 it would be a very nice addition if the authors showed that depletion/elimination of a second ORC subunit in the <i>ORC1-/-</i> or <i>ORC2-/-</i> cells did or did not further reduce replication). The gene expression data is relatively underdeveloped and the strong statements made by the authors about ORC being critical for their regulation seem premature without evidence that there is a direct mechanistic connection between ORC and the expression patterns observed rather than these changes being a general response to the altered cell cycle patterns observed when ORC is depleted."

Specifically, the Orc5 data is interpreted in a way that masks the finding that Orc5 depletion is still important in the absence of Orc1 or Orc2 (last paragraph of the results). The current version concludes that Orc5 is no more important than what is observed when Orc1 and Orc2 is present and hat it does not become more important. The reviewer and I think that the correct conclusion is that Orc5 remains important even in the absence of the other factors, and this is further supported by the now unmentioned result that the authors have been unable to create viable deletions of other Orc subunits (recognizing that this could be a trivial result, but still in contrast to what is observe for Orc1 and Orc2). In fact, it would be useful for the paper to mention the failure to get viable deletions of other Orc subunits, of course with the above caveat. The latter interpretation supports the idea that at least one of the non-deleted subunits is still involved in replication (an important conclusion). If this issue is taken care of, the paper will be accepted."

We show that the replication function and gene expression regulation functions of ORC are separable in mammalian cells. In addition, the positive results on transcription (that loss of ORC deregulates gene expression) provide a great positive control that attests to the successful depletion of functional ORC. This positive result is worth contrasting with the negative effects on DNA replication (that loss of ORC does not have much of an effect on DNA replication initiation)."

ORC is an essential replication protein in simple eukaryotes where origins of replication are defined by specific sequences. In contrast, higher eukaryotes lack a consensus sequence that defines origins and the molecular determinants of the sites of replication initiation in these organisms remain murky. The authors make the intriguing finding that deletions of either the ORC1 or the ORC2 gene are not lethal in human tissue culture cells. They go on to show that loading of the essential Mcm2-7 helicase occurs at reduced levels in these strains but residual loading is observed. Because the chromatin association of Cdc6 and Cdt1, two other helicase-loading proteins is unaffected, the authors suggest that continued association of these proteins mediates the residual Mcm2-7 loading. Intriguingly, depletion of Cdc6 reduced but did not eliminate replication in these cells (perhaps due to incomplete depletion).</i>"

The Orc2-3 complex can associate with Orc5 but not Orc4. The Orc2-3-5 complex brings in Orc4, and finally the Orc2-3-5-4 complex associates with Orc1. This order of subunits entering the complex (Orc2-3-5-4-1) exactly recapitulates the order of the subunits around the ring in the Berger structure. It is hard to imagine how a residual complex can be formed in the absence of Orc2."

The other subunits (Orc2, 3 and 5) have AAA+-like domains but not intact Walker A and B motifs. Multiple groups have shown that the ATPase activity of ORC (in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, in <i>D. melanogaster</i> and in <i>H. sapiens</i>) depends <i>exclusively</i> on the Walker A and B motifs of the Orc1 subunit, and that this ATP binding and hydrolysis activity is essential for ORC function (5-7). For example, Orc1 (and the Walker A motif of Orc1) is essential for human ORC to bind to chromatin and to support DNA replication in <i>Xenopus</i> egg extracts (6). Thus has risen the model that the ATP binding and hydrolysis by the Orc1 subunit of ORC is critical for replication licensing. This model has to be reconsidered now that we show that cells are viable without Orc1, even if an altered or partial ORC is initiating replication. If an alternate cellular molecule substitutes for Orc1 in this critical function, it is most likely Cdc6. This is why we like the result that the Cdc6 gene becomes essential for cell proliferation in the cells deleted for Orc1 (or Orc2)."
