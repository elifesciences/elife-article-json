Surprisingly the binding site was adjacent to but not overlapping with the docking site of an auto-regulatory motif, AutoN, in the N-terminal region (NTR) of ISWI, indicating that AutoN does not act as a simple pseudosubstrate as suggested previously. Rather, AutoN cooperated with a hitherto uncharacterized motif, termed AcidicN, to confer H4-tail sensitivity and discriminate between DNA and nucleosomes. A third motif in the NTR, ppHSA, was functionally required in vivo and provided structural stability by clamping the NTR to Lobe 2 of the ATPase domain. This configuration is reminiscent of Chd1 even though Chd1 contains an unrelated NTR. Our results shed light on the intricate structural and functional regulation of ISWI by the NTR and uncover surprising parallels with Chd1."

Surprisingly the binding site was adjacent to but not overlapping with the docking site of an auto-regulatory motif, AutoN, in the N-terminal region (NTR) of ISWI, indicating that AutoN does not act as a simple pseudosubstrate as suggested previously. Rather, AutoN cooperated with a hitherto uncharacterized motif, termed AcidicN, to confer H4-tail sensitivity and discriminate between DNA and nucleosomes. A third motif in the NTR, ppHSA, was functionally required in vivo and provided structural stability by clamping the NTR to Lobe 2 of the ATPase domain. This configuration is reminiscent of Chd1 even though Chd1 contains an unrelated NTR. Our results shed light on the intricate structural and functional regulation of ISWI by the NTR and uncover surprising parallels with Chd1."

ISWI becomes active when it interacts with a \u2018tail\u2019 region of a histone protein called H4. However, the H4 tail prefers to interact with neighboring nucleosomes instead of with ISWI. Therefore when ISWI slides a nucleosome close to another one, the H4 tail of the nucleosome binds instead to its new neighbor so that ISWI cannot continue to slide. By this mechanism, ISWI is proposed to pile up nucleosomes, which subsequently compact, leading to the inactivation of this part of the genome."

In addition, mutagenesis experiments identified a new motif in the enzyme that is essential for recognizing the H4 tail. In the absence of the nucleosome, this motif \u2013 called AcidicN \u2013 works with a neighboring motif called AutoN to keep ISWI in an inactive state. The two motifs also work together to enable ISWI to distinguish between nucleosomes and DNA. Further evidence suggests that other remodeling enzymes have similar regulation mechanisms; therefore this method of controlling nucleosome remodeling may have been conserved throughout evolution."

Some move nucleosomes along DNA, eject histones or exchange them for histone variants, and some can even perform several of these activities (<a href=\"#bib53\">Zhou et al., 2016</a>). How the various remodelers are regulated in response to cellular needs is not well understood. Several remodelers, for instance, respond to post-translational modifications present on histones (<a href=\"#bib40\">Swygert and Peterson, 2014</a>). Others are directly regulated by post-translational modifications (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kim et al., 2010</a>) or react to small signaling molecules (<a href=\"#bib52\">Zhao et al., 1998</a>). Cells also adjust the subunit composition of remodeling complexes during development (<a href=\"#bib29\">Lessard et al., 2007</a>). All these examples indicate exquisite levels of controls exerted over remodeling complexes. The fact that mutations in subunits of human remodeling factors strongly associate with and in some cases drive cancers underscores the necessity to regulate remodeler activity (<a href=\"#bib25\">Kadoch and Crabtree, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Garraway and Lander, 2013</a>)."

ISWI\u2019s activity is directly regulated by the histone H4 N-terminal tail and by DNA that flanks the nucleosome, so called linker DNA. The regulation imposed by these epitopes has direct consequences for the biological output of ISWI remodelers. By measuring the length of linker DNA, ISWI can generate arrays of evenly spaced nucleosomes (<a href=\"#bib30\">Lieleg et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Yang et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Yamada et al., 2011</a>), a characteristic feature of chromatin. Arrays of nucleosomes can further compact. In the compacted state, the histone H4 N-terminal tail of one nucleosome contacts the acidic patch formed by H2A and H2B of a neighboring nucleosome (<a href=\"#bib31\">Luger et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Dorigo et al., 2004</a>). This interaction sequesters the H4 tail, which now is no longer available for binding to and stimulating the activity of ISWI. Thus, ISWI\u2019s activity on the compacted chromatin would decrease, ensuring the unidirectionality of the reaction. This process is in line with the importance of some ISWI complexes in heterochromatin biology (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bozhenok et al., 2002</a>)."

Notably, ISWI contains an identical motif, here called AutoN. Mutation of AutoN\u2019s two arginines to alanines (referred to as 2RA) increased the DNA-stimulated ATPase activity and nucleosome sliding, and suppressed the dependence of ISWI\u2019s ATPase and sliding activities on the H4 tail. According to the current model, AutoN directly binds to and blocks the H4-tail binding site, acting as a gatekeeper for the H4 tail. This model necessitates a conformational change of the NTR to allow binding of H4 (<a href=\"#bib24\">Hwang et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Clapier and Cairns, 2012</a>). Indeed, a conformational change could be traced to AutoN upon nucleic acid binding (<a href=\"#bib33\">Mueller-Planitz et al., 2013</a>). Of note, the 2RA mutation diminished but did not abolish the H4-tail dependency, implicating also other regions in the H4 recognition process (<a href=\"#bib8\">Clapier and Cairns, 2012</a>)."

With similar approaches, we mapped the H4-tail binding site. We interpret our results within a unified structural and functional framework for the combined inhibition of ISWI by the NTR and recognition of the histone H4 tail. Contrary to current models, we propose that AutoN does not occlude the binding pocket of the H4 tail and that inhibition by AutoN involves a more elaborate mechanism than simple mimicry of the H4 basic patch."

We conclude that ISWI<sub>H483B</sub>, albeit hydrolyzing ATP more slowly than ISWI<sub>WT</sub>, efficiently coupled ATP hydrolysis to chromatin remodeling, which suggested that the mutant remained structurally largely intact. Also, auto-regulation of ISWI<sub>H483B</sub> by its NTR was unperturbed because mutagenesis of the NTR had analogous effects on ISWI<sub>WT</sub> and ISWI<sub>H483B</sub> (see below), further justifying the use of ISWI<sub>H483B</sub> for crosslinking experiments."

Docking of the NTR against Lobe 2 may be necessary for the structural integrity of ISWI-type remodelers (see above).

We carried out three independent docking runs to model the interaction of Lobe 2 with AutoN, AcidicN and AutoN-AcidicN, respectively (see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods for details). All three <i>ab initio</i> docking runs yielded a large cluster of models that identified the preferred binding site for AutoN and AcidicN (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>; <a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>). Docking of scrambled peptides as a control partially diminished the preference for this binding pocket (data not shown). Docking of AutoN-AcidicN against a homology model comprising both ATPase lobes gave very similar results, suggesting specificity of the motifs for binding to Lobe 2 (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>).

                                "text": "Because the peptides may not exclusively bind ISWI in the physiological binding pocket, we pursued a second approach. We reconstituted entire nucleosomes bearing a photo-reactive benzophenone on the N-terminal tail of H4. Benzophenone labeling was achieved by chemical modification of single cysteine mutants of H4 (T1C and L10C). These nucleosomes bound to full-length ISWI and stimulated its ATPase activity like wild-type nucleosomes (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2B,C</a>) suggesting that they were properly recognized by the remodeler. UV-irradiation of full-length ISWI bound to benzophenone-labeled T1C nucleosomes retarded the mobility of the remodeler during SDS-PAGE, indicative of successful crosslinking (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). MS analysis mapped a crosslink to Lobe 2 of ISWI (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B\u2013D</a>). We repeated these crosslinking experiments with the human ISWI homolog SNF2H. Both T1C- and L10C-labeled nucleosomes crosslinked to Lobe 2 of SNF2H (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1G\u2013J</a>). In summary, two very different crosslinking approaches, one employing Bpa-containing peptides and one using benzophenone-derivatized nucleosomes, consistently yielded crosslinks between the H4 tail and Lobe 2 of the ATPase domain. <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a> lists all crosslink candidates, classified in terms of their reliability (see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods). Notably, methionine residues were overrepresented as targets of the photo-crosslinking approach, consistent with the known preference of benzophenones for methionine (<a href=\"#bib46\">Wittelsberger et al., 2006</a>). In summary, our data strongly indicated the H4-tail binding site to reside on or close to Lobe 2."

Charge-reversal of these residues would be expected to weaken docking of AcidicN to Lobe2 and \u2013 in the simplest case \u2013 phenocopy the effects of the mutation of AcidicN. Indeed, the interface mutants had a strongly upregulated DNA-stimulated ATPase activity whereas chromatin-stimulated ATP turnover and nucleosome remodeling were largely unaffected (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B,C</a>; <a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). The interface mutants therefore behaved just like the AcidicN mutants discussed above. A control mutant (ISWI<sub>R486; 488D</sub>), carrying amino acid substitutions just outside of the predicted AcidicN binding interface, however, retained its ability to discriminate chromatin over DNA in the ATP hydrolysis assay (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>).

This model is supported by the observations that the NTR can in principle undergo conformational changes (<a href=\"#bib33\">Mueller-Planitz et al., 2013</a>) and that the chromo domains of Chd1 must rearrange before the ATPase domain assumes a catalytically active conformation (<a href=\"#bib23\">Hauk et al., 2010</a>).

This scenario is fully compatible with our suggestion that the docking sites for the H4 tail and AutoN-AcidicN are adjacent to each other but not overlapping (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). Conceivably, the negatively charged AcidicN motif may even promote binding of the basic H4 tail to a neighboring site. A structural rearrangement of the NTR upon H4 tail binding is compatible with but not required in this model. Similarly, conformational changes of the NTR upon DNA binding (<a href=\"#bib33\">Mueller-Planitz et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Hauk et al., 2010</a>) or during other steps of the reaction cycle are also fully consistent with it."

Thus, the overall conformational architecture of ISWI\u2019s ATPase module may be shared with Chd1. Moreover, both domains are known to inhibit the ATPase, both are predicted to undergo conformational changes upon substrate binding (<a href=\"#bib33\">Mueller-Planitz et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Clapier and Cairns, 2012</a>) and both confer sensitivity towards the histone H4 tail (<a href=\"#bib8\">Clapier and Cairns, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Hauk et al., 2010</a>).

In particular, it lost its H4-tail dependence. This phenotype is reminiscent of mutations in the acidic helix in Chd1 (<a href=\"#bib23\">Hauk et al., 2010</a>), underscoring the functional parallels between the NTR and chromo domains discussed above. The effects of AcidicN mutations were also remarkably similar to AutoN mutations (<a href=\"#bib8\">Clapier and Cairns, 2012</a>), which suggested that they work together. The mechanism of autoinhibition by the NTR therefore may involve more than simple mimicry of H4\u2019s basic patch by AutoN (<a href=\"#bib8\">Clapier and Cairns, 2012</a>).

As suggested by our crosslinking and modeling data, the NTR packed against the ATPase domain in the structure of the thermostable ISWI. We correctly predicted the AcidicN binding pocket on Lobe 2 (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>), and our crosslinks between Lobe 2 and the NTR were fully supported by the structure as well. Finally, the authors succeeded in co-crystallizing a histone H4-tail peptide with Lobe 2 of the ATPase.

Briefly, for each motif three idealized peptide conformations (extended, \u03b1-helical and poly-proline) were generated from sequence and this peptide ensemble was docked rigidly against the protein domain using the ATTRACT coarse-grained force field (<a href=\"#bib51\">Zacharias, 2003</a>).

In the current model for ISWI activation, the H4-tail binding site is blocked by the AutoN-motif in the N-terminal region (NTR) of ISWI, which contains a sequence very similar to the basic patch in the H4 tail. Consequently, it was proposed that H4 and AutoN compete for the same site on the ISWI ATPase domain. Using a combination of site-specific cross-linking, mass spectroscopy and structural modeling, the authors have mapped the approximate binding sites of the NTR and the H4 tail within purified ISWI enzymes in vitro. They deduce that the NTR and the H4 tail both bind to lobe 2 of the ATPase domain, but not at the same site. Their data are therefore inconsistent with the current model. They propose an allosteric model instead. This study also identifies two other important regions in the NTR: the ppHSA motif, which is shown to contribute to the structural stability of the NTR domain, and the AcidicN motif which, together with AutoN, is important for H4-dependent enzyme activation. Mutations in AcidicN or AutoN activate the ISWI ATPase in the absence of chromatin and allow remodeling of nucleosomal arrays even if the H4 tail is absent. These two motifs together confer H4-tail dependence on the enzyme. The authors also point out that ISWI is more similar to Chd1 than expected, given the lack of sequence homology between the NTRs of the two enzymes."

Earlier data had suggested the AutoN negatively regulates the ATPase and remodeling activities of ISWI which can be competed away and relieved by the H4 tail. They present a different explanation in which the AutoN and a flanking region called AcidicN bind to a region of the ATPase domain different than the H4 tail. Instead of competing the H4 tail, AutoN and AcidicN cooperate together to regulate ISWI in an H4 tail dependent manner. A third motif called ppHSA is also presented to bind to lobe 2 of the ATPase domain and stabilizes the interactions of AutoN and AcidicN with lobe 2."

They incorporate photoreactive amino acid analogs either into a site of the ATPase domain they propose to be the binding site of the NTR region or into the H4 tail. Photoaffinity labeling is a powerful technique, but there are certain concerns associated with this approach which need to be considered. Whenever a modification is made, especially one as bulky as benzophenone (essentially 2 benzene rings), it is critical to determine if the modification interferes with the normal function of the protein. The authors have not shown if the modifications in ISWI or the H4 tail peptide interfered with their binding or the associated enzymatic activity. Since their results and conclusions are heavily dependent on these crosslinking data, it is imperative for them to do the necessary controls. They need to determine if the modifications interfered with the ATPase and nucleosome remodeling activity of ISWI and if modifications in the H4 tail interfere with it stimulating the ATPase activity of ISWI with DNA. The other approach uses chemical crosslinking of proximal lysines with a reagent called BS3 and identification of crosslinked pairs by mass spectrometry. The authors failed to present the full spectral dataset of these crosslinking experiments and how they were validated or confirmed. Instead they indicate only one of the potentially many crosslinks they obtained and in this case have picked the one that is consistent with the model. The data needs to be fully presented and properly vetted before it can be accepted."

It is reasonably probable that the photocrosslinking captures a minor population of the protein and may not be a good representation of the bulk protein and the true state of the protein. Possibly only an inactive fraction of the protein is what is being productively crosslinked and thus additional tests need to be in place to confirm the protein interactions. The site-directed mutagenesis unfortunately do not accomplish this purpose, but only demonstrate that particular residues are important for the enzyme's activity. This is further compounded because unlike aryl azides, benzophenone has the ability to cycle between its excited state and ground state until it reaches the appropriate substrate and it has a high preference for Met. Therefore these reagents can search for quite a while until the right substrate presents itself and for these reason make it even more probable of trapping an inactive or inappropriate conformation that may occur infrequently."

Based on only one crosslinked site and additional assumptions does not provide a high confidence in the sites proposed by the authors. This non-objective way of showing the data appears multiple times in this manuscript. And yet this is a major point of the manuscript. Also when they dock the H4 tail on the surface of the ATPase domain based on crosslinking at two sites on H4, they only show one model instead of the family of possible interactions obtained by their modeling method. The choice of only one site on the surface of the ATPase domain seems to be inadequate for probing the interactions of the NTR with the ATPase domain. The rationale for choosing the site based on the premise that it should be the same or similar to that of the chromodomains of Chd1 when there is no sequence homology between these two region doesn't have much supporting evidence and is very tenuous. There should at least by other sites within lobe 1 that are examined as controls in order to confirm the specificity of the observed contacts."

I think it is important for the authors to do all the experiments with the ISWI construct containing the HSS region, because the HSS region is very likely to matter in this regard."

The authors examine recombinant constructs of ISWI with serial truncations from the N-terminus. They examined the stabilities of these proteins using differential scanning fluorimetry and concluded the deletion of the extreme N-terminus containing the ppHSA motif is less stable than the full length ISWI. The data however shows that the truncated proteins are more complex that full length ISWI and did not give a simple one curve. Indeed there seems to be components within the sample that may actually be more stable than full length. The purity of these proteins as visualized by SDS-PAGE analysis are not very high and could lead to the complicated scan of these truncated proteins. The author average all this together to give them a lower thermal stability for the truncated constructs and is misleading. The also conclude that the ppHSA motif dies not contribute to the regulation of the activity of ISWI; however they see a 3.6 fold reduction when this motif is removed. I would have thought that was a substantial effect and should not be discounted."

They present a different explanation in which the AutoN and a flanking region called AcidicN bind to a region of the ATPase domain different than the H4 tail. Instead of competing the H4 tail, AutoN and AcidicN cooperate together to regulate ISWI in an H4 tail dependent manner.

Photoaffinity labeling is a powerful technique, but there are certain concerns associated with this approach which need to be considered. Whenever a modification is made, especially one as bulky as benzophenone (essentially 2 benzene rings), it is critical to determine if the modification interferes with the normal function of the protein. The authors have not shown if the modifications in ISWI or the H4 tail peptide interfered with their binding or the associated enzymatic activity. Since their results and conclusions are heavily dependent on these crosslinking data, it is imperative for them to do the necessary controls.

It is reasonably probable that the photocrosslinking captures a minor population of the protein and may not be a good representation of the bulk protein and the true state of the protein. Possibly only an inactive fraction of the protein is what is being productively crosslinked and thus additional tests need to be in place to confirm the protein interactions. The site-directed mutagenesis unfortunately do not accomplish this purpose, but only demonstrate that particular residues are important for the enzyme's activity. This is further compounded because unlike aryl azides, benzophenone haas the ability to cycle between its excited state and ground state until it reaches the appropriate substrate and it has a high preference for Met. Therefore these reagents can search for quite a while until the right substrate presents itself and for these reason make it even more probable of trapping an inactive or inappropriate conformation that may occur infrequently.</i>"
