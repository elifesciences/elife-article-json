How this post-transcriptional RNA-regulatory machine impacts cell fate decisions and differentiation is poorly understood. Previously, we demonstrated that exosome complex subunits confer an erythroid maturation barricade, and the erythroid transcription factor GATA-1 dismantles the barricade by transcriptionally repressing the cognate genes. While dissecting requirements for the maturation barricade in <i>Mus musculus</i>, we discovered that the exosome complex is a vital determinant of a developmental signaling transition that dictates proliferation/amplification versus differentiation. Exosome complex integrity in erythroid precursor cells ensures Kit receptor tyrosine kinase expression and stem cell factor/Kit signaling, while preventing responsiveness to erythropoietin-instigated signals that promote differentiation. Functioning as a gatekeeper of this developmental signaling transition, the exosome complex controls the massive production of erythroid cells that ensures organismal survival in homeostatic and stress contexts."

How this post-transcriptional RNA-regulatory machine impacts cell fate decisions and differentiation is poorly understood. Previously, we demonstrated that exosome complex subunits confer an erythroid maturation barricade, and the erythroid transcription factor GATA-1 dismantles the barricade by transcriptionally repressing the cognate genes. While dissecting requirements for the maturation barricade in <i>Mus musculus</i>, we discovered that the exosome complex is a vital determinant of a developmental signaling transition that dictates proliferation/amplification versus differentiation. Exosome complex integrity in erythroid precursor cells ensures Kit receptor tyrosine kinase expression and stem cell factor/Kit signaling, while preventing responsiveness to erythropoietin-instigated signals that promote differentiation. Functioning as a gatekeeper of this developmental signaling transition, the exosome complex controls the massive production of erythroid cells that ensures organismal survival in homeostatic and stress contexts."

To replenish the red blood cells that are lost, first a protein called stem cell factor (SCF) instructs stem cells and precursor cells to proliferate, and a second protein, known as erythropoietin, then signals to these cells to differentiate into mature red blood cells. It is important to maintain this balance between these two processes because too much proliferation can lead to cancer while too much differentiation will exhaust the supply of stem cells."

The experiments showed that these cells were no longer able to respond when treated with SCF in culture, whereas the control cells responded as normal. Further experiments showed that cells with less of the exosome complex also made less of a protein named Kit. Normally, SCF interacts with Kit to instruct cells to multiply. Lastly, although the experimental cells could no longer respond to these proliferation signals, they could react to erythropoietin, which promotes differentiation. Thus, normal levels of the exosome complex keep the delicate balance between proliferation and differentiation, which is crucial to the development of red blood cells."

The first subunit was discovered from an analysis of mechanisms controlling yeast rRNA synthesis. Mutations of <i>Exosc2 (Rrp4</i>) disrupt 5.8S rRNA 3\u2019-end processing (<a href=\"#bib49\">Mitchell et al., 1996</a>). Exosc2 assembles into a complex with components homologous to bacterial 3\u2019 to 5\u2019 exoribonuclease (PNPase) (<a href=\"#bib48\">Mitchell et al., 1997</a>). Nine exosome complex subunits form a cylindrical core consisting of the RNA binding subunits Exosc1 (Csl4), Exosc2 (Rrp4) and Exosc3 (Rrp40), which cap a ring formed by Exosc4 (Rrp41), Exosc5 (Rrp46), Exosc6 (Mtr3), Exosc7 (Rrp42), Exosc8 (Rrp43) and Exosc9 (Rrp45) (<a href=\"#bib39\">Liu et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Makino et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Makino et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Wasmuth et al., 2014</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Despite homology with bacterial PNPases, the vertebrate core subunits lack RNA-degrading activity (<a href=\"#bib39\">Liu et al., 2006</a>). Whereas Dis3 (Rrp44) (nuclear) and Dis3L (cytoplasmic) catalytic subunits bind the same position of the core complex, adjacent to Exosc4 and Exosc7, the predominantly nuclear catalytic subunit Exosc10 (Rrp6) binds the opposite site (<a href=\"#bib15\">Dziembowski et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Makino et al., 2015</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). The catalytic subunits, which may function redundantly in certain contexts, mediate RNA degradation and/or processing (<a href=\"#bib29\">Kilchert et al., 2016</a>). Unlike Dis3L and Exosc10, which are strictly exoribonucleases, Dis3 is also an endoribonuclease (<a href=\"#bib35\">Lebreton et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Tomecki and Dziembowski, 2010</a>). The core subunits, except Exosc1, are considered to confer structural integrity (<a href=\"#bib39\">Liu et al., 2006</a>)."

Analogous to Exosc8 and Exosc9 (<a href=\"#bib46\">McIver et al., 2014</a>), experiments in which Exosc3 expression is impaired suggest that this protein also suppresses maturation of primary murine fetal liver lineage-negative hematopoietic precursor cells. In particular, Exosc3 downregulation using two distinct shRNAs increased the R4 (late basophilic/orthochromatic erythroblasts) cell population nine fold (p=0.006 and p=0.01 for the two shRNAs, respectively) (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). However, it remains unclear whether the single subunit perturbations impact exosome complex integrity. To address this, we developed a co-immunoprecipitation assay to test whether individual components mediate complex integrity (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Using the X-ray crystal structure of the exosome complex as a guide (<a href=\"#bib39\">Liu et al., 2006</a>), the strategy involved testing whether downregulating endogenous Exosc8 or Exosc9 alter interactions between endogenous Exosc2 and Exosc3, subunits that do not interact directly in the complex (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). As Exosc2 and Exosc3 are only expected to co-immunoprecipitate when residing in the complex or a sub-complex, the extent of co-immunoprecipitation constitutes a metric of complex integrity."

Estradiol activation of ER-GATA-1 induces an erythroid transcriptional program and recapitulates a physiological window of erythroid maturation (<a href=\"#bib68\">Welch et al., 2004</a>). G1E-ER-GATA-1 cells were infected with retroviruses expressing control (luciferase) shRNA or shRNAs targeting <i>Exosc8</i> or <i>Exosc9</i>. Whole cell lysates prepared 48 hr post-infection were immunoprecipitated with anti-Exosc3 or isotype-matched control antibody, and Western blotting was conducted with anti-Exosc2 antibody. Whereas knocking down <i>Exosc8</i> or <i>Exosc9</i> by ~75% (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>) did not alter Exosc2 levels in the input, the knockdowns reduced the amount of Exosc2 recovered with the anti-Exosc3 antibody (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Densitometric analysis indicated that <i>Exosc8</i> and <i>Exosc9</i> knockdowns reduced the amount of Exosc2 co-immunoprecipitated with Exosc3 by 58 (p=0.007) and 87% (p=1.3 \u00d7 10<sup>\u20134</sup>), respectively (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, right). Of relevance to this result, yeast <i>Exosc8 (Rrp43)</i> mutations decrease exosome complex stability and RNA binding (<a href=\"#bib41\">Lourenco et al., 2013</a>). As Exosc8 or Exosc9 downregulation disrupted Exosc3-Exosc2 interactions that only occur in the complex, erythroid maturation resulting from downregulating either of these subunits is associated with dismantling or destabilizing intra-complex protein-protein interactions."

Alternatively, lowering Epo might impair a mechanism that supports erythroid precursor proliferation, independent of enhanced maturation; thus, precursor cell survival would be compromised. Using flow cytometry to quantitate the erythroid cell surface markers Ter119 and CD71, we determined the impact of Exosc8 downregulation on erythroid precursor cell maturation under normal and Epo-limiting conditions. In this expansion culture, control cells were largely unaffected by limiting Epo. Whereas Exosc8 downregulation stimulated erythroid maturation (1.5 fold increase in R2 to R3 transition, p=0.003) in media containing 0.5 U/ml Epo, maturation of Exosc8-knockdown cells did not proceed without exogenous Epo (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>). Without Epo, Exosc8 downregulation also increased the percentage of immature erythroid precursors (R1). Morphological analysis of DRAQ7<sup>-</sup> cells using Giemsa stain provided further evidence for the Epo-dependent R2 to R3 transition resulting from Exosc8 knockdown (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). The exosome complex-dependent erythroid maturation barricade was also quantitated using an alternative flow cytometric assay based on CD44 staining and cell size. Exosc8 or Exosc9 downregulation induced accumulation of more mature erythroid cells when cultured in 0.5 U/ml Epo (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

Erythrocytes (gate VI) increased two fold (Exosc8, p=0.005, Exosc9, p=0.005). Immature erythroid cells (proerythroblasts and basophilic erythroblasts, gates I and II) decreased proportionally. Exosc8 downregulation reduced the number of early SCF, IL-3 and Epo-dependent BFU-E (Burst Forming Unit \u2013 Erythroid) colonies by 10 fold (p=4.7 \u00d7 10<sup>\u201310</sup>).

                                "text": "Erythroid maturation instigated by Exosc8 downregulation was Epo-dependent. We tested whether Exosc8 downregulation corrupted a proliferation/amplification mechanism, thereby promoting maturation. SCF signaling supports erythroid precursor proliferation (<a href=\"#bib50\">Munugalavadla and Kapur, 2005</a>), whereas Epo signaling promotes maturation (<a href=\"#bib72\">Wu et al., 1995b</a>). SCF and Epo can synergistically promote proliferation (<a href=\"#bib27\">Joneja et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Sui et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Wu et al., 1997</a>). Using a phospho-flow cytometry assay (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hewitt et al., 2015</a>), we quantitated the capacity of SCF (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>) or Epo (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>) to instigate cell signaling using the shared downstream substrate Akt. SCF induced maximal Akt phosphorylation in immature erythroblasts (Ter119<sup>-</sup>/CD71<sup>high</sup>) (5.5 fold, p=3 \u00d7 10<sup>\u20136</sup>). As erythroid maturation progressed to Ter119<sup>+</sup>/CD71<sup>high</sup> and Ter119<sup>+</sup>/CD71<sup>low</sup> stages, the SCF response was diminished (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Exosc8 downregulation abrogated SCF-mediated induction of phospho-Akt (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Epo induced maximal Akt phosphorylation in Ter119<sup>+</sup>/CD71<sup>high</sup> erythroblasts, and Exosc8 downregulation accelerated acquisition of this signaling response. Whereas Epo did not affect Akt phosphorylation in control Ter119<sup>-</sup>/CD71<sup>high</sup> erythroblasts, Epo increased phospho-Akt 4 fold (p=0.003) in Exosc8-knockdown Ter119<sup>-</sup>/CD71<sup>high</sup> erythroblasts (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Similar results were obtained using a phospho-flow cytometric assay to quantitate phosphorylation of ERK, an additional shared downstream effector of SCF and Epo signaling, although phospho-ERK was higher in the unstimulated Exosc8 condition in comparison with the control condition (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Thus, downregulating an exosome complex subunit that dismantles intra-complex protein-protein interactions abrogates SCF signaling that supports precursor proliferation/amplification, while precociously inducing pro-differentiation Epo signaling. By orchestrating this developmental signaling transition, the exosome complex ensures a balance between proliferation/amplification and differentiation - a balance that shifts physiologically towards differentiation as GATA-1 represses genes encoding exosome complex subunits (<a href=\"#bib46\">McIver et al., 2014</a>). Artificially, shRNA-mediated downregulation of exosome complex subunits, which impairs exosome complex integrity, skews the balance."

Since GATA-2 directly activates <i>Kit</i> transcription in immature erythroblasts, and GATA-1 directly represses <i>Kit</i> transcription during maturation (<a href=\"#bib26\">Jing et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Munugalavadla et al., 2005</a>), we tested whether exosome complex disruption impacted GATA-2 and GATA-1 levels. Exosc8 downregulation modestly increased <i>Gata2</i> mRNA in R3 cells, but GATA-2 protein levels were not significantly affected in Ter119<sup>-</sup> cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). Previously, we demonstrated that <i>Exosc8</i> knockdown did not influence <i>Gata1</i> mRNA levels (<a href=\"#bib46\">McIver et al., 2014</a>). GATA-1 increased slightly in <i>Exosc8</i>-knockdown Ter119<sup>-</sup> cells (1.4 fold, p=0.02) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). GATA-2 activates transcription of <i>Samd14</i>, encoding a facilitator of SCF/Kit signaling (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hewitt et al., 2015</a>). In certain contexts, Kit signaling creates a positive autoregulatory loop that increases <i>Kit</i> transcription (<a href=\"#bib73\">Zhu et al., 2011</a>). Downregulating Exosc8 had little to no effect on <i>Samd14</i> expression (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). To assess whether Exosc8 downregulation reduced expression of genes resembling <i>Kit</i> in being transcriptionally downregulated upon maturation, we quantitated expression of <i>Vim</i> (encoding vimentin) (<a href=\"#bib12\">DeVilbiss et al., 2015</a>) and the GATA-2 target gene <i>Hdc</i> (encoding histidine decarboxylase) (<a href=\"#bib28\">Katsumura et al., 2014</a>). Downregulating Exosc8 did not affect the maturation-dependent reduction in <i>Vim</i> or <i>Hdc</i> mRNA levels (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). The Exosc8 requirement for <i>Kit</i> transcription and expression of functional, cell surface Kit therefore does not involve a major alteration in GATA factor levels nor a general Exosc8 activity to sustain expression of genes destined for downregulation upon erythroid maturation."

                                "text": "Previously, we demonstrated that exosome complex disruption induces erythroid precursor cells to arrest in the G1 phase of the cell cycle and is associated with increased expression of genes promoting (or implicated in promoting) cell cycle arrest (<a href=\"#bib46\">McIver et al., 2014</a>). As erythroid maturation requires cell cycle progression (<a href=\"#bib55\">Pop et al., 2010</a>), we asked whether Kit downregulation precedes, is concomitant with, or a consequence of GATA-1 and Exosc8-mediated regulation of cell cycle arrest genes. At 24 hr post-infection of fetal liver erythroid precursor cells with shRNA-expressing retrovirus, <i>Exosc8</i> mRNA declined by 70% (p=0.005). Whereas <i>Kit</i> mRNA decreased by 46% (p=0.002), expression of the GATA-1/Exosc8-regulated cell cycle-regulatory genes <i>Cdkn1b</i> (p27Kip1), <i>Ddit3, Gadd45a, Gas2l1</i> and <i>Trp53inp1</i> was not significantly altered (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). Analysis of the cell cycle status of Kit-expressing Ter119<sup>-</sup> erythroid precursor cells 24 and 72 hr post-infection revealed only a slight increase in the percentage of G1 cells at 24 hr (30% in control and 33.5% in <i>Exosc8</i>-knockdown cells (p=2 \u00d7 10<sup>\u20136</sup>)). At 72 hr post-infection, 49.5% of <i>Exosc8</i>-knockdown Ter119<sup>-</sup> cells were in G1, in comparison with 36% of control cells (p=1.6 \u00d7 10<sup>\u20136</sup>) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>). Thus, the prominent cell cycle arrest resulting from Exosc8 downregulation occurs after Kit is repressed. To more definitively establish the relationship between Kit downregulation and cell cycle arrest, we tested whether Exosc8 downregulation reduces Kit expression in a system not competent for differentiation. shRNA-mediated <i>Exosc8</i> downregulation in GATA-1-null G1E proerythroblast-like cells reduced <i>Kit</i> mRNA by 37% (p=0.002) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>), and Kit cell surface expression by 44% in the GFP<sup>+</sup> population (p=3.3 \u00d7 10<sup>\u20138</sup>). Importantly, cell surface Kit was unaffected in the GFP<sup>-</sup> population (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5H</a>). In aggregate, these analyses support a model in which exosome complex disruption downregulates Kit expression independent of alterations in cell cycle status and is not a consequence of cell cycle arrest or cellular maturation. Consistent with these results, mining RNA-seq data from normal and <i>Exosc3</i><sup>-/-</sup> ES cells (<a href=\"#bib54\">Pefanis et al., 2015</a>) revealed <i>Kit</i> expression 5.9 fold lower in mutant versus control cells (transcripts per million, false discovery rate &lt; 0.05)."

However, considering that the exosome complex associates with elongating RNA polymerase II (<a href=\"#bib4\">Andrulis et al., 2002</a>) and rapidly degrades promoter upstream transcripts (PROMPTs), which are believed to be generated at many genes (<a href=\"#bib43\">Lubas et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Preker et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Preker et al., 2008</a>), one might predict that the exosome complex has a broader distribution in and surrounding genes.

Cells were infected with a range of retrovirus concentrations to establish the amount required to restore Kit to the endogenous level after Exosc8 downregulation. Exosc8 downregulation reduced Kit MFI six fold (p=0.001). At 48 hr post-infection, 50 \u03bcl of Kit retroviral supernatant (half of that used in the time-course) increased Kit cell surface expression in Exosc8-knockdown cells to approximately the endogenous level (1.2 fold higher than control). Under these conditions, infection of control cells increased Kit cell surface expression three fold (p=0.002). Exosc8 downregulation, without ectopic Kit expression, increased the percentage of R3 cells ~two fold (p=0.003) 48 hr post-infection. The increased R3 population cells induced by Exosc8 downregulation was prevented by enforced Kit expression at 1.2 fold higher than the endogenous level (control R3, 19.7% versus Exosc8/Kit R3, 16.5%). A three fold increase in Kit cell surface expression in the control condition decreased the R3 population cells from 19.7% to 6% (p=0.001) (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). As enforced Kit expression negated erythroid maturation induced by exosome complex disruption, the exosome complex activity to establish and/or maintain Kit expression is a critical step in the exosome complex-dependent maturation process."

Herein, we demonstrated that the exosome complex is a critical determinant of the proliferation versus differentiation balance of erythroid precursor cells, and many unanswered questions existed regarding how this balance is controlled (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). The exosome complex establishes the balance by ensuring expression of a receptor tyrosine kinase, Kit, which is essential for proliferation, under conditions in which progenitors are not competent to transduce Epo pro-differentiation signals. Disrupting exosome complex integrity downregulated Kit and SCF-mediated proliferation signaling, while inducing Epo signaling (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). Physiologically, GATA-1 represses expression of exosome complex subunits, instigating the developmental signaling transition. Reduced SCF signaling upon exosome complex disruption would be predicted to underlie or contribute to activation of Epo signaling in erythroid precursor cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4</a>, <a href=\"#fig5\">5</a>) and promote erythroid differentiation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3</a>, <a href=\"#fig7\">7</a>). Our results establish a paradigm in which an RNA-regulatory machine orchestrates the balance between opposing developmental signaling pathways. Considering the apparent ubiquitous expression of the exosome complex, it is attractive to propose that the paradigm may operate to control additional progenitor cell transitions."

Exosome complexes are highly conserved RNA processing/degrading machines that are present in almost all eukaryotic cells. Here, the authors explore the role of individual exosome subunits in complex stability and report that disruption of EXOSC8 or 9 perturbs exosome complex assembly, prevents normal signaling by the c-kit receptor and accelerates Epo responsiveness, leading to enhanced erythroid maturation. They further dissect likely mechanisms by which exosome complex disruption alters erythropoiesis, and implicate transcriptional control of c-kit as a key regulatory mechanism. Overall, the study is well-designed and executed and the data are presented clearly and provide compelling support for the authors' conclusions. Although investigation of the in vivo relevance of exosome complex activity to the generation of erythroid cells is notably lacking, in light of the fact that exosome complex functions in stem/progenitor cells have been relatively unexplored to date, the in vitro results reported here provide an appropriate model system to begin exploring this biology and yield new insights into potential regulatory mechanisms that dictate cell fate decisions during differentiation of mammalian cells. However, a major weakness of the paper is its lack of mechanistic insight into EXOSC8/9 mediated control of Kit expression. Additional experiments are needed to clarify the mechanism by which loss of Exosc8/9 leads to a loss of Kit expression beyond what the authors have previously published (McIver et al. (2014) Blood 124:2285) and to warrant publication in <i>eLife</i>."

The authors should quantify the overexpression of Kit by flow cytometry or Western and ensure that Kit expression in Exosc8 knockdown cells is only expressed to endogenous control levels and not vastly overexpressed to cause everything to be supershifted to an R2 fate. <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a> shows that Kit is overexpressed by 5-7.5 fold its normal levels.

As the authors cited, work in <i>Arabidopsis</i> and <i>Drosophila</i> has demonstrated that each exosome subunit has seemingly distinct functions. The authors attempt to address this by demonstrating that without Exosc8 or Exosc9, the stability of the complex is compromised due to a loss of interaction between Exosc3 and Exosc2. However, this is not a robust measure of complex integrity. The authors should knockdown Exosc8 or Exosc9 and then probe for Exosc3 or Exosc2 using a native gel to determine the size of the complex before and after subunit knockdown. Furthermore it is important to determine whether Exosc3 and Exosc2 are necessary for erythroid cell self-renewal. The authors can do this by knocking down Exosc3 and Exosc2 and evaluating the effects on erythroid maturation, similar to the Exosc8 or Exosc9 knockdowns."

For example during an asymmetric division one progeny is another stem cell maintaining the population (self-renewal), while the other progeny is not a stem cell (differentiation). The Lin- population of fetal liver cells is not a pure population of cells so it is difficult to conclude that Kit signaling maintains self-renewal of this population. A better term would be proliferation of a transient amplifying population."

Analogous to Exosc8 and Exosc9 (McIver et al., 2014), experiments in which Exosc3 expression is impaired suggest that this protein also suppresses maturation of primary murine fetal liver lineage-negative hematopoietic precursor cells. In particular, Exosc3 downregulation using two distinct shRNAs increased the R4 (late basophilic/orthochromatic erythroblasts) cell population 9 fold (p = 0.006 and p = 0.01 for the two shRNAs, respectively) (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). However, it remains unclear whether the single subunit perturbations impact exosome complex integrity. To address this, we developed a co-immunoprecipitation assay to test whether individual components mediate complex integrity (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Using the X-ray crystal structure of the exosome complex as a guide (Liu et al., 2006), the strategy involved testing whether downregulating endogenous Exosc8 or Exosc9 alter interactions between endogenous Exosc2 and Exosc3, subunits that do not interact directly in the complex (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). As Exosc2 and Exosc3 are only expected to co-immunoprecipitate when residing in the complex or a sub-complex, the extent of co-immunoprecipitation constitutes a metric of complex integrity.\""

Exosc9 occupied the <i>Kit</i> promoter and open reading frame, as well as <i>Alas2, Slc4a1</i> and <i>Hbb-b1</i> promoters. As discussed in the text, the exosome complex can associate with elongating RNA Polymerase II and directly suppresses synthesis of PROMPTs at promoters. Thus, our results are consistent with expectations that the complex would have a reasonably broad distribution at endogenous loci, rather than residing at a specific site, like a transcription factor with intrinsic sequence-specific DNA binding activity. Regarding why the exosome complex might function as a transcriptional activator and repressor, many transcriptional factors and coregulators mediate activation or repression in a context-dependent manner. It will be important to dissect how the exosome complex might toggle between activation and repression states and/or how the chromosomal locus dictates exosome complex functionality. Addressing this issue will require a major new project beyond the scope of our current discovery of an exosome complex-Kit regulatory mechanism that orchestrates a developmental signaling switch that determines erythroid precursor proliferation versus differentiation."

Macrocytic anemia of W mice is apparent by E12, persists after birth and is associated with much lower red cell numbers, presumably caused by inefficient proliferation of hematopoietic precursor cells (Russel et al. 1968). Anemia in W mutants can be cured by transplant of hematopoietic tissue from wild type mice. Hematopoietic cells from W/W bone marrow exhibit a 200 fold decreased ability to form splenic colonies after transplant into irradiated recipients, indicating a deficiency in colony forming cells (McCulloch et al. 1964). In vitro colony assays demonstrated that BFU-E and CFU-E activity is reduced in bone marrow and spleen cells from W/W mice in comparison with wild type controls (Gregory and Eaves, 1978). Cells isolated from W/W fetal livers do not form splenic colonies when introduced into irradiated host animals. In in vitro colony assays, W/W fetal livers exhibit normal numbers of CFU-GM and BFU-E colonies, but generate much fewer CFU-Es (Nocka et al. 1989). These phenotypes reflect, at least in part, a defect in the formation and or function of both hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. Importantly, our analyses involve isolation of wild type fetal liver hematopoietic precursors, which are cultured under conditions that support erythroid precursors. Our loss-of-function analysis demonstrated that Exosc8 downregulation reduces <i>Kit</i> expression in erythroid precursors. This is a very different scenario than analyzing Kit-defective HSCs and/or other multi-potent precursors. Thus, we do not believe our results are predictable or inconsistent with descriptions of W mutant phenotypes."

As the authors cited, work in Arabidopsis and Drosophila has demonstrated that each exosome subunit has seemingly distinct functions. The authors attempt to address this by demonstrating that without Exosc8 or Exosc9, the stability of the complex is compromised due to a loss of interaction between Exosc3 and Exosc2. However, this is not a robust measure of complex integrity. The authors should knockdown Exosc8 or Exosc9 and then probe for Exosc3 or Exosc2 using a native gel to determine the size of the complex before and after subunit knockdown. Furthermore it is important to determine whether Exosc3 and Exosc2 are necessary for erythroid cell self-renewal. The authors can do this by knocking down Exosc3 and Exosc2 and evaluating the effects on erythroid maturation, similar to the Exosc8 or Exosc9 knockdowns.</i>"

We believe that our test of whether downregulating a single exosome complex subunit impacts a protein-protein interaction between two other endogenous subunits, as guided by the X-ray structure, is an effective (and unique) means of measuring complex integrity. There are no examples in which the exosome complex has been resolved on a nature protein gel. We have considerable biochemical expertise and predict that several months of developmental work would be required to assess feasibility of establishing this type of assay. Furthermore, mobility of a multimeric complex in a native gel will be influenced by <i>complex size and shape,</i> and therefore the consequences of disrupting interactions within the complex may not be predictable, based on simple assumptions.
