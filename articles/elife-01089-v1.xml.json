These range from highly toxic small oligomers, each consisting of a few monomers, to large insoluble aggregates known as amyloid fibrils, which are less toxic (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Much effort has therefore focused on identifying compounds that inhibit oligomer and fibril assembly or promote their disassembly (<a href=\"#bib4\">Hard and Lendel, 2012</a>). However, progress has been hampered by a lack of detailed knowledge of the structure of amyloid oligomers and fibrils, particularly when they are bound to inhibitor molecules. Now, in <i>eLife</i>, Lin Jiang, David Eisenberg and co-workers at the University of California, Los Angeles, have designed several new compounds that reduce amyloid toxicity (<a href=\"#bib3\">Jiang et al., 2013</a>). The starting point for their study was the high resolution structure of an Alzheimer\u2019s peptide in an amyloid-like conformation bound to an inhibitor molecule (<a href=\"#bib5\">Landau et al., 2011</a>)."

More than 20 years ago, this approach was used to generate inhibitors of the HIV protease, and led to multiple antiviral drugs entering the clinic years earlier and at a much lower cost than would have otherwise been possible (<a href=\"#bib9\">Wlodawer and Erickson, 1993</a>)."

One reason is that the methods used to solve high-resolution structures of most soluble proteins (X-ray crystallography and NMR) are not readily amenable to insoluble aggregates such as amyloid oligomers and fibrils. This has led to decades of painstaking research using alternative methods such as solid-state NMR to generate structural models of amyloid fibrils (<a href=\"#bib8\">Tycko, 2006</a>), but the uncertainties in these structures limit their usefulness for drug design. Nevertheless, these tour de force studies have revealed several key structural features of amyloid fibrils. They have shown that monomers within fibrils are oriented perpendicular to the fibril axis and form stacks of \u03b2-strands in which the residues are aligned (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). These structural models also reveal large flat interfaces along the fibril axis, which appear more difficult to target with drugs than the pockets and grooves that are typically seen on the surface of soluble proteins such as enzymes."

Its high-resolution atomic structure showed important similarities to lower resolution models of amyloid fibrils formed from other larger peptides and proteins. Since then, the UCLA researchers have crystallized a number of different amyloid-forming peptides (including multiple Alzheimer\u2019s peptide fragments) (<a href=\"#bib7\">Sawaya et al., 2007</a>). They have also solved the atomic structure of an Alzheimer\u2019s peptide fragment in complex with a compound (\u2018orange-G\u2019) that inhibits the toxic effects of amyloid on cells (<a href=\"#bib5\">Landau et al., 2011</a>). Notably, orange-G binds to a flat interface along the fibril axis in a manner that appears to stabilize the fibrils (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, inset)."

This approach yielded several compounds that bound to these fibrils with higher affinity than orange-G and also inhibited amyloid toxicity. Although the best inhibitors bound with modest (micromolar) affinity, it is likely that additional rounds of fibril-inhibitor co-crystallization and structural analysis will lead to the identification of inhibitors with even higher affinities."

Instead, they appear to prevent toxicity by stabilizing Alzheimer\u2019s fibrils and preventing them from dissociating into toxic oligomers or into monomers that could reassemble into toxic oligomers (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). This is consistent with the observation that fibrils associated with Parkinson\u2019s disease can release toxic oligomers (<a href=\"#bib2\">Cremades et al., 2012</a>) and that certain compounds can prevent Alzheimer\u2019s amyloid toxicity without preventing fibril formation (<a href=\"#bib1\">Chen et al., 2010</a>). However, the findings of the UCLA team provide some of the most direct evidence to date that small molecules can abolish the toxicity of mature fibrils solely by stabilizing them against dissociation. Nevertheless, this interesting finding will need to be studied in more detail to better understand how such inhibitors block amyloid toxicity."

First, the co-crystallization and X-ray structural analysis of additional small molecule inhibitors with Alzheimer\u2019s peptide fragments will likely reveal additional binding sites, and may lead to the design of even more effective inhibitors. In addition, this approach should be readily applicable to amyloid fibrils linked to other disorders such as Parkinson\u2019s and prion diseases because peptide fragments from their corresponding amyloid-forming proteins have already been crystallized in fibril-like conformations (<a href=\"#bib7\">Sawaya et al., 2007</a>). Moreover, the insights from these studies will be valuable for guiding the design and selection of antibody and peptide inhibitors that have larger binding interfaces, and thus have the potential to bind with higher affinity and specificity than their small molecule counterparts. This important study has brightened the future for structure-based drug design by providing a path forward for generating inhibitors of one of the most complex and difficult-to-drug targets linked to human disease."
