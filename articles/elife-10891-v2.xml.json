Here we report that polyQ ATXN1 oligomers can propagate locally in vivo in mice predisposed to SCA1 following intracerebral oligomeric tissue inoculation. Our data also show that targeting these oligomers with passive immunotherapy leads to some improvement in motor coordination in SCA1 mice and to a modest increase in their life span. These findings provide evidence that oligomer propagation is regionally limited in SCA1 and that immunotherapy targeting extracellular oligomers can mildly modify disease phenotypes."

Here we report that polyQ ATXN1 oligomers can propagate locally in vivo in mice predisposed to SCA1 following intracerebral oligomeric tissue inoculation. Our data also show that targeting these oligomers with passive immunotherapy leads to some improvement in motor coordination in SCA1 mice and to a modest increase in their life span. These findings provide evidence that oligomer propagation is regionally limited in SCA1 and that immunotherapy targeting extracellular oligomers can mildly modify disease phenotypes."

In the same study, we showed that ATXN1 oligomers are internalized into the cell and seed the formation of new ATXN1 oligomers\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib12\">Lasagna-Reeves et al., 2015</a>). This 'seeding' concept has been explored in several other proteinopathies and is believed to be one of the drivers of neurodegeneration (<a href=\"#bib5\">Frost et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Munch et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Holmes and Diamond, 2012</a>). What\u2019s more, evidence has mounted that soluble aggregates of amyloidogenic proteins including Tau, A\u03b2 and \u03b1\u2013synuclein, can propagate pathology from cell-to-cell in a prion-like fashion, thereby causing pathology progression from one brain region to the\u00a0another in a disease-specific pattern (<a href=\"#bib8\">Hardy and Revesz, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Holmes and Diamond, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Guo and Lee, 2014</a>). Passive immunotherapy has been recently proposed as a feasible strategy to inhibit pathology propagation in mouse models for proteinopathy (<a href=\"#bib1\">Banks et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Chai et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Masliah et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Yanamandra et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Castillo-Carranza et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Games et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Tran et al., 2014</a>). Despite these advances, it is not clear whether a mostly nuclear protein like ATXN1 will propagate from cell-to-cell in vivo and whether passive immunotherapy targeting oligomers will modify disease course."

Notably, this focal distribution coincided with cellular toxicity (<a href=\"#bib12\">Lasagna-Reeves et al., 2015</a>). This observation, together with the finding that ATXN1 oligomers are able to penetrate cells in culture and seed the formation of new ATXN1 oligomers led us to hypothesize that if ATXN1 oligomers propagate in vivo, intracerebral injection of brain extract from a symptomatic SCA1 mouse into a\u00a0disease-free mouse would predispose the latter to develop neuropathology. To test this hypothesis, we injected cerebellar extract (10 \u00b5g, 2.5 \u03bcL) either from <i>Atxn1<sup>154Q/+</sup></i>or wild-type mice into the deep cerebellar nuclei of wild type, <i>Atxn1<sup>-/-</sup></i> and <i>Atxn1<sup>78Q/+</sup></i>mice (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). <i>Atxn1<sup>78Q/+</sup></i>mice express one allele of murine Atxn1 with a 78Q expansion. These mice do not display behavioral abnormalities nor any neuropathology, including ATXN1 inclusions, indicating that a single copy of 78Q-Atxn1 is insufficient to generate disease within the short lifespan of a mouse (<a href=\"#bib14\">Lorenzetti et al., 2000</a>). These characteristics make this mouse an ideal model to determine the seeding abilities of ATXN1 soluble oligomers from <i>Atxn1<sup>154Q/+</sup></i>mice lysates."

                                "text": "Before performing injections, we confirmed by western blot analysis that the injected material from <i>Atxn1<sup>154Q/+</sup></i>mouse cerebella was indeed enriched in oligomers (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Nine different groups of mice (each constituting 8 animals) were injected at 3 months of age (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Three months after injection, ELISA revealed that cerebellar extracts from the SCA1 <i>Atxn1<sup>154Q/+</sup> </i>mice caused a two-to-three fold increase in oligomer formation in the cerebellum and brain stem of <i>Atxn1<sup>78Q/+</sup></i>mice compared to other groups (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, left panels). Oligomer levels in the cortex, which were lower to begin with than in the cerebellum and brainstem, did not significantly change in any of the groups following injection of cerebellar lysate. Neuropathology confirmed that oligomers were located in cerebellum and brain stem, but not in cortex, hippocampus, striatum or olfactory bulb (data not shown). ATXN1 oligomers thus appear to propagate only to neighboring areas, and, at least under these conditions, trans-synaptic propagation was not detected. Nevertheless, we can\u2019t exclude the possibility that a higher concentration of inoculum and/or a longer incubation time might lead to oligomer propagation to farther areas. In all of the groups of\u00a0mice tested, we observed similar amounts of total ATXN1 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, right panels), which indicates that the increase of oligomers in the cerebellum and brain stem of <i>Atxn1<sup>78Q/+</sup></i>mice was produced by a seeding effect of ATXN1-154Q soluble oligomers rather than by inducing more expression of ATXN1-78Q. To evaluate whether or not pathology propagation was triggered by oligomers presented in the injected material from <i>Atxn1</i><sup>154Q/+,</sup>we performed a cell-based seeding assay using the injected materials as previously described (<a href=\"#bib12\">Lasagna-Reeves et al., 2015</a>). Specifically, we added the injected material from <i>Atxn1</i><sup>154Q/+</sup> alone or pre-incubated with the anti-oligomer antibody F11G3 to cells that express ATXN1(82Q) fused to mRFP. After a 10 hr incubation, we then quantified the amount of oligomeric inclusions. In comparison with cells incubated with the injected material from wild type or non-treated group, the cells exposed only to the injected material from <i>Atxn1</i><sup>154Q/+</sup> developed the largest proportion of oligomeric inclusions (37.25%). Moreover, when cells were exposed to the injected material from <i>Atxn1</i><sup>154Q/+</sup> pre-incubated with F11G3, the proportion of oligomeric inclusions (15.25%) did not increase in comparison with the control groups thus suggesting that the active material in the injected lysate are the oligomers (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In addition, this oligomeric pathology did not result from the surgical procedure itself: only PCs of <i>Atxn1<sup>78Q/+</sup></i>knockin mice injected with cerebellar extract from <i>Atxn1<sup>154Q/+</sup></i> mice, not those injected with WT cerebellar extract, showed an increase in oligomers (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). The observation that no oligomers were detected in PCs from either wild-type or <i>Atxn1</i> null mice injected with <i>Atxn1<sup>154Q/+</sup></i> lysates suggests that host expression of polyQ-expanded ATXN1 is necessary for the\u00a0de novo formation of ATXN1 oligomers in PCs. Immunofluorescence confirmed that the oligomers detected in <i>Atxn1<sup>78Q/+</sup></i>PCs were indeed ATXN1 oligomers (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). Overall, these data suggest that the ATXN1 oligomers present in the injected material from <i>Atxn1</i><sup>154Q/+</sup> are responsible for inducing propagation of ATXN1 oligomers in <i>Atxn1<sup>78Q/+</sup></i>mice. Nevertheless, it is possible that other factors present in the inoculum play an important role in promoting propagation. Further, downstream exploration of the precise biochemical composition of these lysates will surely shed insight into this matter."

Even though the performance varied during training, there was no evidence of sustained deficit in the <i>Atxn1<sup>78Q/+</sup></i>knockin mice injected with cerebellar extract from <i>Atxn1<sup>154Q/+</sup></i> mice (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Despite the fact that oligomers propagate through the cerebellum in <i>Atxn1<sup>78Q/+</sup></i>knockin mice, the newly formed 78Q ATXN1 oligomers appear insufficient to induce motor deficit or degeneration (data not shown). This lack of toxicity could be because in <i>Atxn1<sup>78Q/+</sup></i>knockin adult mice, the neurons are relatively healthy and thus can counteract the toxic effect of newly formed oligomers. In contrast, in <i>Atxn1<sup>154Q/+</sup></i>mice, the neurons become dysfunctional by four weeks (<a href=\"#bib12\">Lasagna-Reeves et al., 2015</a>) rendering them more susceptible to the toxicity of oligomers. Another possibility is that the newly formed 78Q ATXN1 oligomers adopt a different structure or conformation that is less toxic than the 154Q ATXN1 oligomers. Further studies will be necessary to determine if these newly formed ATXN1 oligomers are solely derived from 78Q ATXN1 molecules or whether they contain some persistent 154Q ATXN1 seeds."

Because <i>Atxn1<sup>154Q/+</sup> </i>mice develop motor incoordination as early as 5 weeks of age (<a href=\"#bib22\">Watase et al., 2002</a>), we began treatment at 4 weeks of age, where <i>Atxn1<sup>154Q/+</sup> </i>mice already have a modest accumulation of oligomers in the cerebellum (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Wild-type and <i>Atxn1<sup>154Q/+</sup></i> mice were injected intraperitoneally with F11G3 or control IgM antibodies (5 mg/Kg) once a week for 6 weeks. One week after the last injection, we performed the rotarod assay, sacrificed the mice and performed pathological and biochemical analyses. Injected mice were separated into two cohorts, one for biochemical and pathological analysis and one for behavioral and survival analysis. We focused our pathological examination on the cerebellum. Brain sections were immunostained with the anti-oligomer antibody, A-11 (<a href=\"#bib11\">Kayed et al., 2003</a>), to ensure depletion of oligomers at the site of interest. <i>Atxn1<sup>154Q/+</sup> </i>mice treated with the anti-oligomer antibody showed fewer PCs with oligomers than the control group (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A and B</a>). We further analyzed the cerebella by ELISA and noted a decrease in the amount of oligomers and ATXN1 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C and D</a>). Notably, the immunotherapy did not affect the formation and total number of nuclear inclusions in the cortex (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>): either these cortical inclusions are not preceded by oligomers or the antibody did not get internalized into these cells in vivo. Considering our previous study where we demonstrated that the anti-oligomer antibody blocks the seeding effect of ATXN1 oligomers in cell culture without getting internalized into the cell (<a href=\"#bib12\">Lasagna-Reeves et al., 2015</a>), we suggest that the anti-oligomer antibody arrests the propagation of ATXN1 oligomer complexes to neighboring areas by targeting extracellular oligomeric entities rather than directly targeting intracellular oligomers. To confirm that the immunotherapy was indeed targeting ATXN1 oligomers, we analyzed the treated and control samples by western blot using F11G3 and anti-ATXN1 antibody (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A and B</a>). The western blot analysis revealed a decrease in ATXN1 oligomers in the treated group, but no observable change at the level of monomeric ATXN1 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A and B</a>)."

It is widely accepted that amyloid formation is characterized by such seeding (<a href=\"#bib20\">Serio et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Pedersen et al., 2004</a>). This phenomenon has been explored in cell culture assays, several of which have demonstrated that extracellular aggregates that are internalized into the cell induce aggregation of intracellular proteins (<a href=\"#bib5\">Frost et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Munch et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Holmes and Diamond, 2012</a>). Moreover, the concept of cell-to-cell spread of many amyloidogenic proteins in vivo has been demonstrated by the progression of protein aggregate pathology from one brain region to another in a disease-specific pattern (<a href=\"#bib8\">Hardy and Revesz, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Holmes and Diamond, 2012</a>). In our study, however, we found that injected oligomers induced formation of new ATXN1 oligomers only in areas proximal to the injection site. It thus seems unlikely that ATXN1 oligomers propagate transsynaptically in SCA1, as has been suggested with other neurodegenerative diseases (<a href=\"#bib9\">Harris et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">de Calignon et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Liu et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Pecho-Vrieseling et al., 2014</a>). Rather, we suggest ATXN1 propagates through a secretion and reuptake mechanism between neighboring cells as has been proposed for other proteinopathies (<a href=\"#bib7\">Guo and Lee, 2014</a>). Furthermore, no obvious signs of degeneration or motor incoordination were observed in the injected mice. This suggests that the cell must continuously express the toxic entity\u00a0to trigger degeneration and behavioral deficits in mice. This notion is supported by the observation that immunotherapy targeting the ATXN1 oligomers slightly modified the phenotype in the <i>Atxn1<sup>154Q/+</sup> </i>mice: the antibody hindered the local propagation of ATXN1 oligomers. This treatment is not curative, however, because neurons expressing polyQ ATXN1 will still form their own toxic oligomeric entities, and some non-oligomeric forms of PolyQ ATXN1 might contribute to toxicity."

Our findings suggest that such therapy might slightly impact disease progression by blocking the propagation of these oligomeric entities, but to halt or reverse symptoms it would likely be necessary to incorporate a joint therapy that targets the root cause of disease, the abnormal accumulation of polyQ ATXN1 (<a href=\"#bib17\">Park et al., 2013</a>). Altogether, our findings revealed that ATXN1 oligomer propagation contributes to SCA1 pathogenesis, and that such propagation especially in the vicinity of affected cells, could be targeted through passive immunotherapy. That the benefit from such therapy was small highlights the need to develop therapies that target ATXN1, the protein driving the pathogenesis. The need for such combination therapy is likely to extend to other disease-driving proteins."

Cells were plated in 24-well plates (2*104 cells/ml). 24 hr later, cells were treated with 2.5 \u03bcl brain extract (3.9 \u03bcg/\u03bcL) from <i>Atxn1<sup>154Q/+</sup></i>or Wild Type mice. After 10 hr of treatment, cells were fixed with methanol at \u221280\u02daC for 45 min. RFP-positive inclusions ranging from 350 to 900 nm were considered oligomeric; inclusions larger than 900 nm and not detected by F11G3 were considered fibrillar. One hundred cells were quantified per group in triplicates. Analyses were manually performed with Image J. For blocking assays, each sample was mixed with F11G3 antibody (2.5 mg/ml) in a ratio 1:1 (vol/vol) for 1 hr and then added to the cells."

Here the authors test whether injected oligomers can drive regional propagation of SCA1 pathology and whether passive immunotherapy can reverse disease phenotypes. The authors show data that oligomers can propagate within a localized region and that this propagation is limited only to neighboring areas. Immunotherapy results provide some indication that this approach could have limited efficacy. The major points are that for ataxin-1, propagation does not appear to be the major driver of toxicity, therefore immunotherapy against extracellular oligomers would require additional therapeutic strategies in combination. This is a very important point relating to treatment that passive immunotherapy may not be curative because neurons will form toxic oligomeric entities internally and that one would need to target abnormal accumulation of polyQ ATXN1."

The authors interpret this to mean that the \"toxic entity\" (presumably the 154Q) needs to be continuously expressed to observe a phenotype. As the 78Q expansion is abnormal yet insufficient to cause disease in the mouse, presumably due to their short lifespan (subsection \u201cATXN1 oligomers seed the formation of new endogenous ATXN1 oligomers in vivo\u201d, first paragraph), seeding the formation of oligomers was insufficient to increase the pathogenicity of this abnormal repeat as hypothesized by the authors. This would call into question the true pathogenicity of the oligomers if their presence does not alter phenotype. Can the authors comment on whether pure 78Q oligomers are likely formed following seeding from the 154Q lysate or whether all the oligomers likely contain one or more 154Q molecules? If pure 78Q oligomers are formed post-seeding, then why is there no phenotype? If the 78Q is simply insufficient to cause disease, does injection of the oligomers back into 154Q itself worsen that phenotype?"

As the 78Q expansion is abnormal yet insufficient to cause disease in the mouse, presumably due to their short lifespan (subsection \u201cATXN1 oligomers seed the formation of new endogenous ATXN1 oligomers in vivo\u201d, first paragraph), seeding the formation of oligomers was insufficient to increase the pathogenicity of this abnormal repeat as hypothesized by the authors. This would call into question the true pathogenicity of the oligomers if their presence does not alter phenotype. Can the authors comment on whether pure 78Q oligomers are likely formed following seeding from the 154Q lysate or whether all the oligomers likely contain one or more 154Q molecules? If pure 78Q oligomers are formed post-seeding, then why is there no phenotype? If the 78Q is simply insufficient to cause disease, does injection of the oligomers back into 154Q itself worsen that phenotype?</i>"

Nevertheless, we comment in the results section whether pure 78Q ATXN1 oligomers are likely formed following seeding from the <i>Atxn1<sup>154Q/+</sup> </i>brain lysate or whether all the oligomers likely contain one or more 154Q ATXN1 molecules (subsection \u201cATXN1 oligomers seed the formation of new endogenous ATXN1 oligomers in vivo\u201d, last paragraph). In the same section, we also discussed that the newly formed oligomers are insufficient to cause disease, possibly either because the healthy neuronal environment in <i>Atxn1<sup>78Q/+</sup></i> mice can counteract the toxic effect of these oligomers or because they are structurally different from 154Q toxic oligomers."
