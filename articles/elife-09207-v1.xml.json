In prostate cancer, structural genomic rearrangements are a common mechanism driving tumorigenesis. However, somatic alterations predisposing to chromosomal rearrangements in prostate cancer remain largely undefined. Here, we show that <i>SPOP</i>, the most commonly mutated gene in primary prostate cancer, modulates DNA double strand break (DSB) repair, and that <i>SPOP</i> mutation is associated with genomic instability. <i>In vivo</i>, <i>SPOP</i> mutation results in a transcriptional response consistent with <i>BRCA1</i> inactivation resulting in impaired homology-directed repair (HDR) of DSB. Furthermore, we found that SPOP mutation sensitizes to DNA damaging therapeutic agents such as PARP inhibitors. These results implicate SPOP as a novel participant in DSB repair, suggest that <i>SPOP</i> mutation drives prostate tumorigenesis in part through genomic instability, and indicate that mutant <i>SPOP</i> may increase response to DNA damaging therapeutics."
