We have identified mutations in genes encoding ribosomal components in <i>Mycobacterium smegmatis</i> that confer resistance to several structurally and mechanistically unrelated classes of antibiotics and enhance survival following heat shock and membrane stress. These mutations affect ribosome assembly and cause large-scale transcriptomic and proteomic changes, including the downregulation of the catalase KatG, an activating enzyme required for isoniazid sensitivity, and upregulation of WhiB7, a transcription factor involved in innate antibiotic resistance. Importantly, while these ribosomal mutations have a fitness cost in antibiotic-free medium, in a multidrug environment they promote the evolution of high-level, target-based resistance. Further, suppressor mutations can then be easily acquired to restore wild-type growth. Thus, ribosomal mutations can serve as stepping-stones in an evolutionary path leading to the emergence of high-level, multidrug resistance."

We have identified mutations in genes encoding ribosomal components in <i>Mycobacterium smegmatis</i> that confer resistance to several structurally and mechanistically unrelated classes of antibiotics and enhance survival following heat shock and membrane stress. These mutations affect ribosome assembly and cause large-scale transcriptomic and proteomic changes, including the downregulation of the catalase KatG, an activating enzyme required for isoniazid sensitivity, and upregulation of WhiB7, a transcription factor involved in innate antibiotic resistance. Importantly, while these ribosomal mutations have a fitness cost in antibiotic-free medium, in a multidrug environment they promote the evolution of high-level, target-based resistance. Further, suppressor mutations can then be easily acquired to restore wild-type growth. Thus, ribosomal mutations can serve as stepping-stones in an evolutionary path leading to the emergence of high-level, multidrug resistance."

The process by which bacteria develop resistance to multiple drugs is generally viewed as a stepwise accumulation of different mutations.

Gomez, Kaufmann-Malaga et al. identified mutations in these bacteria that unexpectedly gave the bacteria resistance to several unrelated classes of antibiotics."

As well as increasing their resistance to antibiotics, these mutations also reduced the growth rate of the bacteria. This meant that when the bacteria were grown in an antibiotic-free environment they survived less well than non-mutant bacteria. However, the mutations gave the bacteria an advantage in environments that contained many different antibiotics, as they could more easily develop mutations that made them more resistant to other drugs. Thus, the mutant bacteria can serve as stepping-stones toward the development of high-level resistance to multiple drugs."

A 2013 report from the CDC (<a href=\"#bib12\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 2013</a>) identified the most significant antibiotic resistant pathogens, including <i>S. pneumoniae</i>, extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamase producing <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i>, vancomycin-resistant Enterococci, and methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (MRSA), which has now achieved pandemic spread (<a href=\"#bib45\">Monecke et al., 2011</a>). This report estimates that in the United States, antibiotic resistant infections kill at least 23,000 people each year. The threat of antibiotic resistant bacteria is however not limited to the developing world, as the prevalence of multidrug resistant (MDR) and extensively drug resistant (XDR) tuberculosis (TB) has been on the rise for the last decade (<a href=\"#bib42\">Migliori et al., 2010</a>), and untreatable gonorrhoea infections are now emerging (<a href=\"#bib68\">Unemo and Nicholas, 2012</a>). A U.K. task force estimates up to 10 million deaths each year due to antibiotic resistant infections world-wide by 2050 (<a href=\"#bib49\">O\u2019Neill, 2016</a>).

Resistance can nonetheless emerge through acquisition of chromosomal mutations that confer resistance in a variety of ways, including altering the target to prevent antibiotic binding (<a href=\"#bib47\">Musser, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Jacoby, 2005</a>), increasing target expression (<a href=\"#bib3\">Banerjee et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Rouse et al., 1995</a>), decreasing intracellular drug concentration via enhanced efflux or reduced permeability (<a href=\"#bib27\">Fern\u00e1ndez and Hancock, 2012</a>), or reducing the activation of prodrugs (<a href=\"#bib62\">Scorpio and Zhang, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Zhang et al., 1992</a>).

Concentrations below the MPC but above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) define the traditional mutant selection window (<a href=\"#bib23\">Drlica, 2003</a>), the range of concentrations in which a single mutation can confer a selective advantage. However, even concentrations well below the MIC can select for resistant organisms (<a href=\"#bib30\">Gullberg et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Liu et al., 2011</a>), and the enhanced fitness of even low-level resistant mutants can contribute to the development of high-level resistance (<a href=\"#bib4\">Baquero et al., 1998</a>)."

Combinations of antibiotics with different pharmacokinetic properties, along with pharmacogenomic differences between individuals, can also result in periods where one or more of the antibiotics is present at subinhibitory concentrations, wherein a single mutation could allow for an enrichment of a monoresistant strain, which would in turn increase the likelihood of the emergence of a strain carrying multiple, independent resistance-conferring mutations (<a href=\"#bib44\">Mitchison, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Ramachandran and Swaminathan, 2012</a>).

We found novel ribosomal mutations that confer resistance to antibiotics of several different classes that do not target the ribosome, as well as to non-antibiotic stressors. Despite the fact that these mutations have an associated fitness cost in the absence of antibiotic stress and confer relatively modest levels of resistance, they can facilitate evolution to high levels of antibiotic resistance while escaping the fitness cost associated with these mutations through a subsequent reversion. Such transient mutations can thus serve as stepping-stones that facilitate evolution from antibiotic sensitivity to multidrug resistance."

We thus PCR amplified and sequenced <i>gyrA</i> from each of the 19 isolated mutants, but none had mutations at this locus. We then performed whole genome sequencing (WGS, <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>) of each mutant, which revealed resistance-conferring mutations in the <i>lfrR</i> gene in four mutants (21%). The <i>lfrR</i> gene encodes a transcriptional repressor of the LfrA efflux pump (<a href=\"#bib10\">Buroni et al., 2006</a>). LfrA contributes to the intrinsic resistance of <i>M. smegmatis</i> to FQs (<a href=\"#bib65\">Takiff et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Sander et al., 2000</a>), and de-repression of <i>lfrA</i> was shown to increase the MIC to CIP 16-fold (<a href=\"#bib24\">Drusano, 2004</a>). The isolated <i>lfrR</i> mutants were significantly more resistant to CIP (mean 34-fold increase in IC50 over wild-type, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>), than the other 15 mutants (mean 7-fold increase, p=0.0003). The <i>lfrR</i> mutants also arose more rapidly, with 3/4 reaching detectable fluorescence levels within 3 days. In contrast, the 15 non-<i>gyrA</i>, non-<i>lfrR</i> mutants arose more slowly, taking up to 7 days to reach detectable fluorescence (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>)."

Intriguingly, ribosomal mutants showed cross-resistance to antibiotics of unrelated classes to which they had never been exposed (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>), as well as collateral sensitivity to meropenem. The most pronounced shifts were to the cell-wall biosynthesis inhibitor isoniazid (INH), with an average 40-fold increase in IC50 over wild-type (range 6.5 to 158-fold). In contrast, <i>lfrR</i> mutants showed little cross-resistance to INH, consistent with previous characterizations of this efflux system. Cross-resistances were not due to acquisition of additional mutations during the MIC assay, because the assay duration does not allow single cells, i.e. de novo mutants, to reach detectable levels of fluorescence. The rplO-1 and rpsE-1 allelic exchange mutants also displayed these phenotypes (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We also evaluated the ability of ribosomal mutants to tolerate non-antibiotic stresses. Ribosomal mutants were better able to tolerate membrane stress due to SDS exposure (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>) and high temperature (54\u00b0C, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>) compared to wild-type bacteria. Altogether, these data demonstrate that perturbations to the ribosome can have broad ranging consequences on bacterial survival under duress, leading us to investigate the mechanisms underlying these phenotypes."

We thus first measured doubling times of the ribosomal mutants both in the presence and absence of CIP (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). In contrast to the 2.4 hr doubling time calculated for the parental wild-type strain or <i>lfrR</i> mutants, ribosomal mutants had doubling times ranging from 4\u20136.5 hr. The slow growth of mutants generated via allelic exchange confirmed that the ribosomal lesions directly reduce growth rates (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Because conditions that limit bacterial growth have been show to reduce the bactericidal activity of antibiotics (<a href=\"#bib67\">Tuomanen et al., 1986</a>), we examined whether the observed shifts in antibiotic sensitivity could be a simple consequence of slowed bacterial growth. To directly test whether slow growth itself was causing the MIC shifts, we manipulated the growth rate of wild-type <i>M. smegmatis</i> by altering the temperature or restricting the carbon source in the growth medium (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Slower growth rates alone did not recapitulate the IC50 shifts seen in the ribosomal mutants. Additionally, we looked to see whether the growth rates in our panel of mutants were correlated with the magnitude of the changes in antibiotic susceptibility (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Although growth was correlated with INH resistance (R<sup>2</sup>\u00a0=\u00a00.48) it was actually weakly inversely correlated with CIP and novobiocin (NOV) resistance (R<sup>2</sup>\u00a0=\u00a00.13, 0.14), showing that the higher IC50s of the mutants are cannot be accounted for solely by their slower growth."

These drugs associate with the ribosome at different locations, interfering with various steps in translation (<a href=\"#bib73\">Yonath, 2005</a>). If resistance were a general consequence of impaired translation, all would display an antagonistic relationship with CIP and INH. We performed 2D checkerboard experiments (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>), diluting a protein synthesis inhibitor horizontally and a test antibiotic (CIP or INH) vertically across 384-well plates, with the pattern of outgrowth indicating how the two antibiotics interact (<a href=\"#bib22\">DePristo et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Yeh et al., 2009</a>). Most protein synthesis inhibitors tested behaved additively with CIP or INH, thus ruling out general impairment of protein synthesis as the likely mechanism of resistance in these mutants. Only tetracycline significantly suppressed the activity of INH (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>) and CIP (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). Among the inhibitors tested, tetracyclines act uniquely by inhibiting tRNA entry at the A-site (<a href=\"#bib17\">Connell et al., 2003</a>), suggesting that this step in protein synthesis may be a common impairment among our ribosomal mutants, and that the consequences of such impairment are transduced to produce multidrug resistance."

Using DESeq2, we identified genes in each mutant that were differentially regulated relative to the parent. All of the ribosomal mutants showed abundant changes relative to the parent; on average, 1023 of 6718 transcripts (15%) were differentially expressed (range 471\u20132046), and these changes were highly overlapping as demonstrated by a core set of 227 genes that were significantly regulated in all nine ribosomal mutants (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). In contrast, of the 407 genes that were differentially regulated in the <i>lfrR</i> mutant, only 12 were among the core 227 shared by all of the ribosomal mutants.

We found 7574 unique peptides with masses corresponding to mistranslated peptides (i.e. the mass corresponds to a known peptide with a single AA change). If mistranslation was occurring in the rplO-1 mutant, these mistranslated peptides should be more relatively abundant in the rplO-1 mutant, which should be reflected in the rplO-1/parent ratio for these peptides. However, the mean and median ratios seen in the mistranslated peptides are no different than the ratios seen across the larger set of \u2018normal\u2019 peptide; thus, mistranslated, antibiotic-insensitive targets are unlikely to contribute to resistance. In summary, the ribosomal mutations, while impairing 70S assembly, do not appear to lead to mistranslation; nevertheless, they cause an overall stress to the cell that results in a major reprogramming of the transcriptome and proteome of the bacteria, that ultimately lead to a multi-drug resistant phenotype."

For example, the genome-scale data provided an immediate hypothesis to the nature of the observed INH resistance seen in the ribosomal mutants. Among the genes and gene products underexpressed in all strains by RNAseq and also in the iTRAQ dataset was MSMEG_6384, encoding the catalase KatG, which is required for converting the prodrug INH to its active form <a href=\"#bib74\">Zhang et al. (1992)</a>. Relative to the parent strain. levels of <i>katG</i> transcript were reduced 7.1-fold in the rplO-1 mutant (adjusted p-value=1.0\u00d710<sup>\u221254</sup>) and in all of the other ribosomal mutants (average of 3.9-fold across all of the mutants, minimum 2.5-fold, adjusted p-value=1.1\u00d710<sup>\u221213</sup>), while iTRAQ showed a 4.2-fold reduction at the protein level in the rplO-1 mutant. The changes <i>katG</i> expression were confirmed by qRT-PCR (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) and Western blot analysis (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). We hypothesized that among the dramatic overall transcriptome and resulting proteomic changes, the specific reduced KatG levels in the mutants could account for INH resistance. To test this, we introduced a plasmid (pIkatG) carrying an anhydrotetracycline (AHT) inducible copy of <i>katG</i> into an rplO-1 background. We then titrated the concentration of AHT to restore wild-type levels of KatG, measured by Western blot. Indeed, INH sensitivity was restored in the mutant background solely by restoring KatG levels back to wild-type levels, (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>), suggesting that INH resistance is due to the perturbations in KatG levels caused by the ribosomal mutations on the transcriptome and subsequently, on the proteome."

As measured by iTRAQ, WhiB7 was one of the most highly induced proteins (6.0-fold, adjusted p-value=2.5\u00d710<sup>\u22124</sup>) and by RNAseq, <i>whiB7</i> mRNA was up 7.4-fold in rplO-1 relative to the parent strain (p adj.=4.4\u00d710<sup>104</sup>) and in all of the other ribosomal mutants (average of 3.2-fold; minimum 1.7-fold, adjusted p-value=2.1\u00d710<sup>\u22126</sup>). In <i>M. smegmatis</i>, <i>whiB7</i> has been shown to be highly induced after exposure to specific classes of protein synthesis inhibitors, particularly tetracyclines and macrolides (<a href=\"#bib9\">Burian et al., 2012</a>). We also observed high induction in the mutants of many genes known to be part of the <i>whiB7</i> regulon, including several transporters that may contribute to antibiotic resistance by export (MSMEG_5187, a known antiporter of tetracycline (<a href=\"#bib21\">De Rossi et al., 1998</a>), and MSMEG_5102). In addition to <i>whiB7</i>, there was strong correlation between the genes induced in our studies and genes previously shown to be upregulated in a strain lacking MSMEG_6129, a putative anti-sigma factor that is an indirect negative regulator of <i>whiB7</i> (\u00a059) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, highlighted).

In the rplO-1 background, deletion of <i>whiB7</i> restored sensitivity to a CIP, ethionamide (ETH) and cycloserine (CYC) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>), indicating a critical role for WhiB7 in the broad-spectrum resistance observed in the rplO-1 mutant. Deletion of <i>whiB7</i> however, did not fully restore INH sensitivity to rplO-1, nor did it alleviate the increased sensitivity to meropenem. We then constitutively expressed WhiB7 at a high-level from a plasmid in a wild-type background and found that it alone did not confer resistance to CIP, INH, ETH, or MER (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Thus, WhiB7 induction does play a role in the multi-resistance phenotypes; however, it alone is insufficient to account for the entire resistance profiles of the ribosomal mutants. It must act in concert with other pathways to exert its effect on CIP, ETH, MER and INH resistance, with the example of INH resistance resulting via additional alterations in <i>katG</i> expression."

Subsequent acquisition of compensatory changes could restore fitness, thereby relegating the ribosomal mutations to a role as an evolutionary \u2018bridge\u2019 across periods of exposure to antibiotic or other stress. To test for this possibility, we first sought to determine if compensatory changes that restore fitness could occur in the absence of antibiotic selection. We serially passaged three parallel cultures of the rplO-1 mutant in antibiotic-free medium. By passage 12, cultures demonstrated wild-type growth rates (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>) as well as wild-type sensitivities to CIP and INH (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). Evolved strains in all three cultures had acquired an additional insertion or deletion at the <i>rplO</i> locus (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>, <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>), restoring the wild-type reading frame but leaving short deletions or coding changes in the region between the two sequential mutations. We then demonstrated that reversion to wild-type growth rates can also occur readily in a <i>rplO gyrA</i> double mutant (rplO-1 gyrA-1, <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>) during continued passage at 3.5 \u00b5g/ml CIP (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G\u2013H</a>, <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>); INH resistance is lost as a consequence of a compensatory one base insertion that restores the original reading frame but alters one codon in <i>rplO</i>. Thus, these secondarily acquired mutations within <i>rplO</i> that restore the reading frame provide a facile, straightforward mechanism for restoring bacterial fitness after a higher level resistance lesion, <i>i.e., gyrA</i> mutation, has been acquired."

Fluorescence was detected in well A-G20 after 5 days of CIP exposure, a timing consistent with the slow emergence of ribosomal mutants in this assay. The culture expanded from A-G20 was also resistant to INH, NOV, ETH and CYC, consistent with a ribosomal mutation. However, after further expansion for genomic DNA preparation, WGS revealed SNPs in both <i>lfrR</i> (T452C) and <i>rrlB</i> (C904A). Additionally, MIC assays showed high level resistance to CIP, consistent with the presence of an <i>lfrR</i> efflux mutation. To better understand how these two SNPs came to coexist in the A-G20-derived culture, we colony-purified 23 clones from the frozen stock originally expanded from well A-G20 and used PCR to characterize the <i>rrlB</i> and <i>lfrR</i> loci (<a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>). While the majority (19/23 clones) had only the <i>rrlB</i> C904A mutation, three had both the <i>rrlB</i> C904A and <i>lfrR</i> T452C mutation. Surprisingly, the final clone had the <i>rrlB</i> C904A mutation paired with a different <i>lfrR</i> allele, 63(+C). Thus, the <i>rrlB</i> C904A mutation likely arose first, enabling slow replication in the presence of CIP and accounting for the delayed emergence of well A-G20 on day 5. Continued selective pressure during the remainder of the multiwell assay and during subsequent expansion in 0.3 \u00b5g/ml CIP enabled the eventual emergence of <i>lfrR</i> mutants from the <i>rrlB</i> C904A background. These second mutations, providing high level CIP resistance, would increase fitness in the presence of CIP; as seen in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, the growth rate of <i>rrlB</i> mutants is slower in the presence of 0.3 \u00b5g/ml CIP than in antibiotic-free medium. Thus, a single cycle of selection and expansion was sufficient to demonstrate the evolutionary value of ribosomal mutations to the development of high level resistance."

Despite strategies such as combination therapy, resistance is nevertheless arising in complex, multidrug environments. In this work we have identified a novel class of mutations in ribosomal subunits and rRNA that surprisingly confers resistance to several mechanistically diverse antibiotics. These alterations in the ribosome do not result in mistranslation, yet cause misassembly of the ribosome, leading to a dramatic shift in the transcriptional program of the bacterium by that imparts resistance to multiple antibiotics with different mechanisms of action. Within the large-scale changes are numerous, discrete changes in individual genes that result in resistance to specific antibiotics. For example, changes in <i>katG</i> expression confer INH resistance while induction of <i>whiB7</i> plays a role in altering susceptibility to CIP, ethionamide, and cycloserine. Single mutations in the ribosome allow a bacterium, when simultaneously exposed to lethal concentrations of multiple antibiotics (CIP and INH), to survive, grow, and ultimately acquire additional mutations that confer high-level resistance. These mutations are thus beneficial in multidrug environments."

Whether the mutations allow them to survive in general or simply to prolong their time to death, this extended survival provides the ribosomal mutants an increased opportunity, relative to wild-type bacteria, to acquire a second mutation to become high-level resistant. Thus the presence of a small population of ribosomal mutants could contribute to the survival of the larger population, especially in antibiotic concentrations fluctuating near or above the MIC (as might be seen during treatment of a bacterial infection), and facilitate fixation of the second high-level resistance conferring mutation in the population."

However, the nature of these particular mutations are remarkable because locus-specific reversions can easily occur to restore fitness upon passage in conditions where these mutations no longer confer an advantage. Such conditions include an antibiotic-free environment or the continued presence of an antibiotic but after the acquisition of a second, higher-level resistance-conferring mutation that renders the ribosomal mutation dispensable. The nature of the identified lesions (frameshifts in protein coding genes and substitutions in <i>rrlB</i>) and their respective reversions (restoration of the original reading frame) illustrate the straightforward means for regaining fitness via additional insertions/deletions or via gene conversion. This is particularly facile in the case of the 23S rRNA mutations because like many bacteria, <i>M. smegmatis</i> has multiple rRNA operons (two). Resistance-conferring <i>rrlB</i> mutations were acquired only in one copy of the rRNA, thereby facilitating, RecA-mediated gene conversion from the other, wild-type copy (<a href=\"#bib54\">Prammananan et al., 1999</a>). Similar to the way reversions contribute to the evolution of cefotaxime resistant \u00df-lactamases by removing mutations that alone increase fitness but are deleterious in combination with certain other fitness-enhancing mutations (<a href=\"#bib22\">DePristo et al., 2007</a>), the ability to revert in this manner greatly expands the number of possible trajectories to resistance. Thus, these particular mutations make accessible an efficient evolutionary path to multidrug resistance via a temporary state of impaired fitness that is ultimately reversed to restore wild-type fitness."

The two ribosomal subunits together contain over 50 proteins, the functions of which have not yet been fully elucidated. The majority of these proteins are expected to be essential, although recent studies suggest in <i>E. coli</i> and <i>B. subtilis</i> that as many as 22 may be conditionally dispensable (<a href=\"#bib64\">Shoji et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Akanuma et al., 2012</a>). Among these non-essential proteins are two identified in this study that can play a role in multidrug resistance, namely L15 (RplO) and L25 (RplY). The other ribosomal proteins identified in our study, L6 (RplF) and S5 (RpsE), are essential in these organisms. Transposon-based studies of gene essentiality in the related mycobacterium <i>M. tuberculosis</i> (<a href=\"#bib61\">Sassetti et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Zhang et al., 2012</a>) show that <i>rplF</i> and <i>rplE</i> are also essential in <i>M. tuberculosis</i>, while <i>rplY</i> was non-essential and the essentiality of <i>rplO</i> was indeterminate. The mutations we found in <i>rplF</i> and <i>rpsE</i> occur near the 3\u2019 end of the open reading frames, leaving the majority of the corresponding proteins, L6 and S5 unaltered."

Although tetracycline binds to the ribosome at several locations (<a href=\"#bib19\">Day, 1966</a>), its primary binding site is located near the A site, where it interacts with 16S RNA in the 30S subunit (<a href=\"#bib8\">Brodersen et al., 2000</a>). At this site, tetracycline inhibits protein synthesis by interfering with tRNA entry (<a href=\"#bib71\">Wurmbach and Nierhaus, 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Maxwell, 1967</a>). Thus, the ribosomal mutations we have identified may have subtle effects in translation initiation that are similar to the effects of low concentrations of tetracycline. These are then sensed by the cell, leading to a large shift in the overall transcriptome, including the specific induction of <i>whiB7</i> and other specific transcriptional alterations that affect antibiotic sensitivity to other antibiotics. As a corollary, this work raises the question of whether tetracyclines may more generally interact with antibiotics negatively to impact sensitivity."

The existence of natural bacterial isolates with submaximal ribosome kinetics implies that under certain conditions, suboptimal or altered ribosome function may in fact be beneficial. By linking alterations in ribosome assembly with broad transcriptional reprogramming that enhances survival in fluctuating environments, <i>M. smegmatis</i> and other actinomycetes may benefit from ribosomal variants, even at the cost of decreased maximal growth rate. Via genetically accessible paths to reversion, these populations can serve as stepping-stones to higher levels of drug resistance without any irreversible cost in fitness. Because environmental or pathogenic bacteria face extended or fluctuating periods of stress, the generation of minority populations that are resistant to a broad range of antibiotic and other stresses could serve as an evolutionary bridge to the eventual emergence of fit, antibiotic resistant strains."

For determination of <i>gyrA</i> and <i>lfrR</i> sequences, these loci were amplified using the primers lfrR F, lfrR R, gyrA QRDR F1 and gyrA QRDR R1and sequenced at the MIT Biopolymers Laboratory. Whole-genome sequencing of an initial set of 8 strains, including A-M17, A-L8, A-A13, A-H2, B-03, B-I24, B-A9 and B-P7, was performed at Texas A and M University using an Illumina GenomeAnalyzer IIx, as described in <a href=\"#bib31\">Ioerger et al. (2010)</a>. Fragment libraries were constructed using a genomic DNA sample preparation kit from Illumina, Inc. Sequencing data was collected in paired-end mode (from both ends of each fragment) with a read length of 36 bp. Reads were aligned to the genome of <i>M. smegmatis</i> mc<sup>2</sup>155 as a reference sequence (Genbank accession number NC_008596.1). Insertions and deletions were determined using a local contig-building algorithm, and then single-nucleotide polymorphisms were identified from a re-alignment of the reads. The depth of coverage ranged between 23x to 42x (mean number of reads covering each site in the genome).

Hygromycin sensitive colonies were screened for the presence of the mutant allele by PCR amplification of the relevant ribosomal gene. Complementation of the rplO-1 allelic exchange mutant was carried out by transforming that strain with pUV15tet-rplO, a pUV15tetORm derivatave in which <i>rplO</i> expression is controlled via a tetracycline-regulated promoter.

We then determined the time at which each dilution crossed a threshold, roughly 3-fold above the auto-fluorescence background. The delay in crossing this threshold between adjacent twofold dilutions reflects the doubling time in this format.

Bead-beaten tubes were centrifuged at 12,000x<i>g</i> for 15 min. 0.4 mL of aqueous phase was added to equal volume of 100% EtOH, vortexed, and loaded onto Zymo DirectZol columns and RNA was purified according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Illumina cDNA libraries were generated using a modified version of the RNAtag-seq protocol as described (<a href=\"#bib63\">Shishkin et al., 2015</a>). Briefly, 500 ng of total RNA was fragmented, depleted of genomic DNA, and dephosphorylated prior to its ligation to DNA adapter carrying 5\u2019-AN8-3\u2019 barcodes with a 5\u2019 phosphate and a 3\u2019 blocking group. Barcoded RNAs were pooled and depleted of rRNA using the RiboZero rRNA depletion kit (Epicentre). These pools of barcoded RNAs were converted to Illumina cDNA libraries in three main steps: (i) reverse transcription of the RNA using a primer designed to the constant region of the barcoded adaptor; (ii) addition of a second adapater on the 3\u2019 end of the cDNA during reverse transcription using SmartScribe RT (Clontech) as described (<a href=\"#bib66\">Trombetta et al., 2014</a>); (iii) PCR amplification using primers that target the constant regions of the 3\u2019 and 5\u2019 ligated adaptors and contain the full sequence of the Illumina sequencing adaptors. cDNA libraries were sequenced on Illumina HiSeq 2500. For the analysis of RNAtag-Seq data, reads from each sample in the pool were identified based on their associated barcode using custom scripts, and up to one mismatch in the barcode was allowed with the caveat that it did not enable assignment to more than one barcode. Barcode sequences were removed from reads, and the reads from each sample were aligned to genes in their cognate strain using BWA (<a href=\"#bib35\">Li and Durbin, 2010</a>). Differential expression analysis was conducted with raw reads counts per gene using DESeq2 (<a href=\"#bib38\">Love et al., 2014</a>)."

                                "text": "Duplicate 30 ml cultures of mc<sup>2</sup>155 and rplO-1 were harvested in mid-log phase by pelleting at 4000xg and washed twice in cold PBS\u00a0+\u00a00.05% Tween 80, followed by two additional washes in cold PBS without Tween 80. Pellets were resuspended in 750 \u00b5l PBS and beaten for 3 \u00d7 1 min with zirconia \u2013silica beads to lyse the cells. Lysates were centrifuged for 20 min at 4\u00b0C at 16,000xg to separate soluble proteins from beads and cell debris/unlysed cells. These supernatants were removed and transferred to new 1.5 ml tubes, The silica pellets were rinsed in an additional 150 \u00b5l of PBS, vortexed 15 s. The supernatants and rinsed beads were centrifuged an additional 20 min at 16,000xg (a small pellet was seen in the supernatant), and then approx. 700 \u00b5l of cleared supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube. The supernatants from the rinsed beads were transferred to new tubes and centrifuged an additional 20 min at 16,000xg. Again a small pellet was seen in the supernatant. 200 \u00b5l was removed and added to the original cleared lysate. To 900 \u00b5l of samples, 100 \u00b5l of cold 100% TCA was added and the samples were left at 4\u00b0C overnight. TCA-precipitated material was pelleted 16,000xg (20 min, 4\u00b0C). The supernatant was removed by pipetting. Ice cold acetone (1 ml) was added and the tube was swirled. The sample was again centrifuged at 16,000xg (10 min 4\u00b0C), acetone was removed by pipetting, and pellet was dried 10 min. Pellets were resuspended in 6M urea/50 mM ammonium bicarbonate. Protein content of each sample was measured using Pierce BCA protein assay. 20 mM DTT was added 500 \u00b5g of protein and samples were incubated for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. Iodoacetamide was added at a final concentration of 50 mM and samples were incubated for 30 min in the dark at room temperature. Prior to trypsin digestion, urea concentration was diluted to less than 1M by adding water and pH adjusted to 8 with 1M Tris solution. 10 \u00b5g sequencing grade trypsin (Cat. No. V5280, Promega, Madison, WI) was added (1:50 enzyme to substrate ratio) and samples were incubated at 37\u00b0C with shaking for 16 hr. The reaction was stopped by addition of formic acid (FA) to a final concentration of 1% and the solution was desalted with a one cc (30 mg) Oasis HLB reverse phase cartridge (Cat. No. WAT054955, Waters, Milford, USA) conditioned with 3 \u00d7 500 \u03bcL acetonitrile (ACN), followed by 4 \u00d7 500 \u03bcL 0.1% FA. Samples were loaded onto the cartridges and washed with 3 \u00d7 500 \u03bcL 0.1% FA. Desalted peptides were eluted by 2 applications of 500 \u03bcL of 80% ACN/0.1% FA. Eluates were frozen, dried via vacuum centrifugation and stored at \u221280\u00b0C prior to peptide fractionation. For each sample the desalted peptides were labeled with iTRAQ 4-plex reagents according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (AB Sciex, Foster City, CA).The differentially labeled peptides were mixed to form a single pooled sample and subsequently desalted on 500 mg SepPak columns. The pooled sample was then fractionated by reverse phase chromatography into 21 fractions and then analyzed by liquid chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry. Briefly, each of the 21 fractions were resuspended in 8 \u03bcL of 3% ACN/0.5% FA before analysis using a Q Exactive mass spectrometer coupled to an EASY-nLC 1000 UHPLC (Thermo Scientific). A PicoFrit column (New Objective, Woburn, MA), with an inner diameter of 75 \u03bcm and packed with 20 cm of ReproSil-Pur C18 1.9 \u03bcm particles, was directly interfaced to the Q Exactive instrument equipped with a custom nano-electrospray ionization source. Two \u00b5g of the peptide mixture from each of the 21 fractions were injected and separated by a 180 min gradient from 5\u201360% solvent B. MS/MS analysis settings for protein identification were as follows: one precursor MS scan at 70,000 resolution in profile mode was followed by data-dependent scans of the top 12 most abundant ions at low-resolution (17,500) in profile mode. Dynamic exclusion was enabled for a duration of 20 s. MS/MS spectra were collected with a normalized collision energy of 28 and an isolation width of 2.5 m/z. The extensive peptide fractionation coupled with in depth MS analysis allowed detection and identification of very low levels of peptides. All MS data were processed using Agilent Spectrum Mill MS Proteomics Workbench (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, USA) Rev B.04.00.120. To identity of significantly regulated proteins we used the Limma package in the R environment to calculate moderated <i>t</i>-test <i>P</i> values corrected by the Benjamini-Hochberg method."

It is state-of-the-art, interesting, and provocative. The mutant selection is innovative, as the authors set up mini-cultures in 384 well plates seeded with 10 cells in each well. When the population in each well reaches 10<sup>5</sup> cells per ml, ciprofloxacin is added. This design ensures that the mutants analyzed from different wells are not siblings. Of those, 19 mutants were screened for polymorphisms in <i>gyrA</i>, and interestingly no mutations mapped to this gene. Whole genome sequencing was then performed on the 19 independent mutants. Four mutations map to the repressor of the LfrA efflux pump. Of the 15 remaining mutants, 14 possessed mutations in ribosomal genes. The authors generate specific mutations in the parental strain, and indeed confirm the mutations mediate the phenotypes. Interestingly, these mutations confer resistance to numerous other antibiotics that have notably different mechanisms of action, with the greatest cross-resistances to isoniazid, detergent and heat stress. Not only are the results interesting, the approach is innovative taking advantage of modern high throughput methodologies and will become a blueprint for future studies."

The parental strain is actually not wild type, but rather a mutant of <i>M. smegmatis</i> ATCC 607 that was first isolated in 1988 (Snapper et al. PNAS 85: 6987-6991). The efficient plasmid transformation phenotype of this strain relates to its being permissive for plasmid replication (Snapper et al. 1990 Mol. Microbiol. 11:1911-1919). Recently, it was demonstrated that this property maps to a gene encoding an SMC protein (Panas et al. 2014 PNAS 111:13264-13271). The precise mechanism by which SMC allows plasmid replication has yet to be elucidated, but in wild type strains it either prevents replication or plasmid segregation to daughter cells. The authors use a concentration of ciplofloxocin that may not be bactericidal (in the second paragraph of the subsection \u201cSelection for Low Level Ciprofloxacin Resistance Identifies Ribosomal Mutants\u201d, it is stated that ciprofloxacin has a relatively slow killing rate \u2013 the data should be included as a supplemental figure), and the surrogate measure of escape from killing is indirect and relies on plasmid replication to measure green florescent protein activity. Therefore, it is possible, perhaps likely, that ciprofloxicin at the level being used may be limiting plasmid replication in the cell rather than selecting for resistance to killing, and the mutations obtained relieve that inhibition. It is therefore important to distinguish between allowing the pAL5000 replicon to replicate and cell death (It is ambiguous whether the GFP tag is on a self-replicating plasmid or integrated. Loss of the plasmid from the cell would be scored as a dead cell in most of the assays. Even if an integrated plasmid was used, excision could be dependent on the topology of the DNA altered by fluoroquinolones. In the Methods, it is important to note whether the selecting antibiotic is included during the experiments.) Several approaches might be useful in resolving the ambiguity, including directly assessing killing; using the parent of mc<sup>2</sup>155, mc<sup>2</sup>6, to see if the mutations identified confer resistance to bactericidal killing, such as engineering the <i>rplO</i> and <i>rplJ</i> mutations in mc<sup>2</sup>6, etc."

Changes in specific genes within the large-scale reorganization can be used to account for the individual resistance phenotypes that we see to individual antibiotics. For example, a repression of KatG expression accounts for the observed resistance to isoniazid while the upregulation of WhiB7 contributes to ciprofloxacin resistance. We have tried to clarify that changes in specific genes within the global shifts can account for resistance to different antibiotics (subsection \u201cGenome-Scale Studies suggest an overall transcriptional reprogramming contributing to multi-drug resistance\u201d, first two paragraphs). In addition, we now provide additional data to suggest that the global changes that occur in the ribosomal mutants may be occur as a result of the ribosomal mutations causing stress to the bacterial cell due to defective assembly of the large 70S ribosome, thereby providing further molecular insight into the consequences of carrying these described ribosomal mutations (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C-D</a>, subsection \u201cGenome-Scale Studies Illuminate the effects of ribosomal mutations on ribosome assembly\u201d, first three paragraphs)."

This new, rich dataset shows that all of the mutants are behaving very similarly based on a common transcriptional program and now allows us to identify transcriptional perturbations that are common across all ribosomal mutants sharing these resistance phenotypes, that explain some of the individual resistance mechanisms (i.e., downregulation of katG to explain isoniazid resistance and WhiB7 induction to explain ciprofloxacin resistance). This new data strongly supports the notion that a common, highly altered transcriptional program relative to wild-type underlies the resistances observed in this manuscript."
