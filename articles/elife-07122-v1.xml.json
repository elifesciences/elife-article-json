To better understand the functional roles of AgRP neurons, we performed optetrode electrophysiological recordings from AgRP neurons in awake, behaving <i>AgRP-IRES-Cre</i> mice. In free-feeding mice, we observed a fivefold increase in AgRP neuron firing with mounting caloric deficit in afternoon vs morning recordings. In food-restricted mice, as food became available, AgRP neuron firing dropped, yet remained elevated as compared to firing in sated mice. The rapid drop in spiking activity of AgRP neurons at meal onset may reflect a termination of the drive to find food, while residual, persistent spiking may reflect a sustained drive to consume food. Moreover, nearby neurons inhibited by AgRP neuron photostimulation, likely including satiety-promoting pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons, demonstrated opposite changes in spiking. Finally, firing of ARC neurons was also rapidly modulated within seconds of individual licks for liquid food. These findings suggest novel roles for antagonistic AgRP and POMC neurons in the regulation of feeding behaviors across multiple timescales."

To better understand the functional roles of AgRP neurons, we performed optetrode electrophysiological recordings from AgRP neurons in awake, behaving <i>AgRP-IRES-Cre</i> mice. In free-feeding mice, we observed a fivefold increase in AgRP neuron firing with mounting caloric deficit in afternoon vs morning recordings. In food-restricted mice, as food became available, AgRP neuron firing dropped, yet remained elevated as compared to firing in sated mice. The rapid drop in spiking activity of AgRP neurons at meal onset may reflect a termination of the drive to find food, while residual, persistent spiking may reflect a sustained drive to consume food. Moreover, nearby neurons inhibited by AgRP neuron photostimulation, likely including satiety-promoting pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons, demonstrated opposite changes in spiking. Finally, firing of ARC neurons was also rapidly modulated within seconds of individual licks for liquid food. These findings suggest novel roles for antagonistic AgRP and POMC neurons in the regulation of feeding behaviors across multiple timescales."

Furthermore, as soon as food became available, the firing rate of the AgRP neurons suddenly dropped\u2014even though the animals' energy reserves would still have been low. These results are consistent with the findings of two recent studies reported earlier this year that used different methods to indirectly measure neuronal activity in awake mice. Notably, even after the drop in activity, the firing rates of AgRP neurons remained above those recorded in fully sated mice\u2014which possibly reflects the fact that the animals' energy reserves were still low. The putative POMC neurons generally showed opposite effects to the AgRP neurons."

Moreover, the seemingly paradoxical drop in AgRP firing and increase in POMC firing upon receiving food may act as a signal to temporarily stop searching for food, so that feeding itself can begin. Alternatively, since the release of satiety hormones after eating a meal is slow, these rapid changes in firing may provide more immediate feedback to the neuronal circuits that regulate the drives to seek and consume food."

Both opto- and pharmaco-genetic activation of AgRP neurons drive intense feeding in ad libitum-fed mice (<a href=\"#bib1\">Aponte et al., 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib35\">Krashes et al., 2011</a>), while loss-of-function experiments in food-restricted mice lead to a reduction in food consumption (<a href=\"#bib28\">Gropp et al., 2005</a>, <a href=\"#bib42\">Luquet et al., 2005</a>, <a href=\"#bib35\">Krashes et al., 2011</a>).

Consistent with the hypothesized enhancement of AgRP neuron firing in times of caloric deficit, in vitro recordings of AgRP neurons in brain slices from mice during their dark cycle or during a period of fasting revealed enhanced action potential firing and spontaneous subthreshold currents as compared to recordings during the light cycle (<a href=\"#bib66\">Yang et al., 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib40\">Liu et al., 2012</a>, <a href=\"#bib36\">Krashes et al., 2013</a>). Interestingly, opposite effects were observed in satiety-promoting POMC neurons (<a href=\"#bib67\">Yaswen et al., 1999</a>, <a href=\"#bib1\">Aponte et al., 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib68\">Zhan et al., 2013</a>), which are known to be inhibited by GABA release from AgRP neurons (<a href=\"#bib18\">Cowley et al., 2001</a>, <a href=\"#bib6\">Atasoy et al., 2012</a>). Studies performed in vitro further suggest that AgRP and POMC neurons exert antagonistic influences, not only on each other's activity (<a href=\"#bib16\">Cone et al., 2001</a>, <a href=\"#bib66\">Yang et al., 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib6\">Atasoy et al., 2012</a>), but also on the activity of common long-range target nuclei (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bagnol et al., 1999</a>, <a href=\"#bib17\">Cowley et al., 1999</a>, <a href=\"#bib6\">Atasoy et al., 2012</a>, <a href=\"#bib5\">Atasoy et al., 2014</a>). However, these in vitro experiments were performed under conditions in which most endogenous circulating factors are absent, and most sources of slow and fast afferent neuronal input are severed. Indeed, in the presence of realistic levels of synaptic inhibition, recordings from de-afferented AgRP neurons show minimal action potential firing in vitro (<a href=\"#bib66\">Yang et al., 2011</a>). High-temporal resolution in vivo recordings of spiking activity in identified single neurons in the intact ARC would be necessary to confirm these findings regarding sensitivity to slow changes in energy deficit and could potentially reveal novel roles for AgRP and other ARC neurons in guiding food-seeking and feeding behaviors at shorter timescales."

Because the only ARC neurons currently known to be inhibited by AgRP neurons are POMC neurons (<a href=\"#bib18\">Cowley et al., 2001</a>, <a href=\"#bib6\">Atasoy et al., 2012</a>), a large fraction of ARC<sub>inh</sub> neurons are likely to be POMC neurons. We found that AgRP neuron firing rates increased across hours over the course of the light period. Surprisingly, we also found that AgRP neurons exhibited a sudden and sustained decrease in spiking over the course of minutes, in response to feeding as well as to cues that predicted the availability of food. This decreased level of spiking, which persisted throughout the meal, nevertheless exceeded spiking rates during recordings from ad libitum fed, sated mice at the onset of the light cycle. This abrupt change in spiking cannot simply reflect homeostatic changes but instead suggests that the drop in AgRP neuron spiking reflects a reduction in the drive to seek food at the initiation of food consumption. Finally, we observed that the activity of ARC neurons could be modulated on the timescale of seconds by feeding-related behaviors, including individual licks for liquid food. In general, neurons inhibited by AgRP neuron photostimulation show opposite effects to AgRP neurons. Together, these results suggest that, in addition to sensing slow systemic changes in energy balance, AgRP and POMC neurons may also integrate this information with complex environmental cues regarding food availability and feeding context, in order to dynamically adjust feeding behaviors at timescales from hours to seconds."

Across 75 daily sessions in 15 mice, we recorded spiking activity in 100 ARC neurons, of which 41 were optogenetically identified as AgRP neurons on the basis of sustained firing increases during photostimulation (see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>; see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 for additional details of classification).

Because the only ARC neurons currently known to be inhibited by AgRP neurons are POMC neurons (<a href=\"#bib18\">Cowley et al., 2001</a>, <a href=\"#bib6\">Atasoy et al., 2012</a>), a large fraction of ARC<sub>inh</sub> neurons are likely to be POMC neurons.

Further, the release of peptides is also likely to depend on spike frequency (<a href=\"#bib56\">Summerlee and Lincoln, 1981</a>, <a href=\"#bib1\">Aponte et al., 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib3\">Arrigoni and Saper, 2014</a>, <a href=\"#bib52\">Schone et al., 2014</a>). Thus, we sought to gain insight into instantaneous spiking frequency in our sample of ARC neurons by considering the distribution of inter-spike intervals (ISIs). Most neurons (94/100) demonstrated tonic firing with unimodal ISI distributions (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>; Hartigan's Dip Test, p &lt; 0.05), suggesting the absence of pronounced burst-like behavior (<a href=\"#bib61\">van den Top et al., 2004</a>). In contrast to in vitro recordings, where spiking often demonstrates machine-like regularity, we observed that ISI distributions in vivo were quite broad (ratio of standard deviation to mean, or coefficient of variation, exceeding a value of 1; see <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a> for details) for all three classes of neurons, likely reflecting strong moment-to-moment fluctuations in synaptic input in vivo, as well as differences in the cellular milieu in vivo vs. ex vivo. It is notable that, in the context of recordings from AgRP neurons in free-feeding mice, we rarely observed short ISIs (&lt;50 ms) in morning recordings, but observed a roughly 14-fold increase in occurrence of such events in afternoon recordings (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>; p = 0.02). In contrast, the non-AgRP neurons (ARC<sub>inh</sub> and ARC<sub>other</sub>) show the opposite trend, with short ISIs occurring more often in the morning than in the afternoon (p = 0.13). Taken together, these in vivo increases in AgRP firing and decreases in ARC<sub>inh</sub> firing from morning to afternoon recordings are consistent with the homeostatic roles proposed for AgRP and POMC neurons in feeding behavior (<a href=\"#bib35\">Krashes et al., 2011</a>)."

This index, called the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (auROC; see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019), has a value of 0 (blue) in periods where a neuron's firing has decreased robustly (i.e., the distribution of firing rates at the tested period is entirely below the firing rate distribution of the baseline period), a value of 1 (red) in periods where firing has increased robustly, and a value of 0.5 for periods with no change in firing (i.e., where the distribution of firing rates in the test period is indistinguishable from baseline). Using this index, we observed that AgRP neurons typically showed a rapid and sustained decrease in firing (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>) when comparing pre-lickspout baseline firing (prior to gray vertical bar) with firing rates in a sliding window following onset of feeding (black vertical bars).

In addition to these changes in firing, our data provided additional information regarding absolute activity levels following the onset of feeding. Interestingly, while feeding reduced firing rates, it did not abolish firing in AgRP neurons, and firing rates remained elevated relative to certain ad libitum conditions. Specifically, we found that the spiking rate of AgRP neurons recorded in food-restricted mice following refeeding (15\u201345 min after onset of feeding, whether during epochs that involve or do not involve licking, 5.9 \u00b1 1.3 and 5.8 \u00b1 1.3 spikes/s, respectively; N = 22 neurons) was significantly higher than firing rates measured in free-feeding mice at the onset of the light cycle following night feeding (1.4 \u00b1 0.3 spikes/s; N = 10; p = 0.03 in both cases). These data suggest that the early, feeding-related drop in AgRP neuron activity represents a partial drop in firing that does not reach the lower levels of firing exhibited by these neurons in the absence of caloric deficiency."

Indeed, almost half of all ARC neurons recorded (45%, 22/49; 2 sample KS-test, p &lt; 0.025) showed significant changes in mean firing in the 5-min period following lickspout placement, but prior to feeding.

By contrast, 50% (6/12) of ARC<sub>inh</sub> neurons showed significant anticipatory <i>increases</i> in firing, while none showed a significant drop.

Thus, a large subset of AgRP neurons decrease spiking activity in the minutes following presentation of a food-predicting cue, while ARC<sub>inh</sub> neurons showed the opposite effect. These findings suggest that AgRP neurons decrease their firing upon identification of an upcoming source of food, either to decrease the drive to continue the search for food (see \u2018Discussion\u2019), or in anticipation of future meal-induced restoration of caloric deficit."

Previous studies, however, were performed in freely moving mice with access to solid food. We confirmed that AgRP photostimulation in a headfixed mouse trained to lick for liquid Ensure also drives feeding. First, at the end of feeding experiments (described above), when mice were sated (defined by voluntary abstinence from licking for liquid food), we repeated the photostimulation procedure to confirm identification of recorded cells. Here, we investigated whether this AgRP photostimulation would induce additional licking for liquid food (n = 11 sated sessions from 4 mice, including all sessions in which the mouse did not lick for Ensure in the 3 min preceding laser stimulation onset).

Because the observed increase in endogenous afternoon firing in AgRP neurons does not drive feeding, additional circuits may exist downstream of AgRP neurons (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>) that prevent significant daytime feeding until dark period onset, at which point this \u2018drive state\u2019 is released and food-seeking and feeding rapidly occur (<a href=\"#bib41\">Lu et al., 2002</a>). The slow changes in firing that we observed across the light cycle as caloric deficit increases are consistent with prior studies employing indirect measures of AgRP activity (<a href=\"#bib41\">Lu et al., 2002</a>, <a href=\"#bib25\">Ellis et al., 2008</a>), as well as with in vitro recordings from AgRP neurons across times of day (<a href=\"#bib66\">Yang et al., 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib36\">Krashes et al., 2013</a>).

These data further support the notion that additional circuits downstream of AgRP neurons may prevent additional feeding, even in contexts where AgRP neurons continue to fire at intermediate spike rates. Moreover, these data suggest that the rapid decrease in AgRP firing, associated with food cues and meal-initiation (<a href=\"#fig3 fig4\">Figures 3, 4</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Betley et al., 2015</a>, <a href=\"#bib14\">Chen et al., 2015</a>), may be separable from the firing that persisted at intermediate spiking rates during the meal, which may be associated with homeostatic signals of residual negative energy balance."

In contrast to AgRP neurons, ARC<sub>inh</sub> neurons\u2014including putative POMC neurons\u2014responded with fast and persistent <i>increases</i> in firing to both food-predicting cues and food reward. Furthermore, acute modulation of ARC firing rates even occurred down to a timescale of approximately 1 s. Such seconds-long modulations could occur prior to, as well as during, individual licks or bouts of licking for food, which themselves elicited a transient decrease in firing in several AgRP neurons. These fast changes in firing that we observed on the timescale of minutes to seconds in classes of ARC neurons were surprising, as these neurons were presumed, until recently, to be mainly driven by slow homeostatic signals (<a href=\"#bib41\">Lu et al., 2002</a>, <a href=\"#bib25\">Ellis et al., 2008</a>, <a href=\"#bib34\">Kim et al., 2014</a>).

More recently, in vivo fiber photometry was used to monitor bulk changes in population calcium activity, pooled from many ARC AgRP neurons (<a href=\"#bib14\">Chen et al., 2015</a>), while another recent study used epifluorescence measurements of calcium activity in individual AgRP neurons in awake mice (<a href=\"#bib12\">Betley et al., 2015</a>).

While manipulations of several different brain areas can produce initiation or cessation of food consumption, it remains unknown whether neurons exist whose endogenous in vivo spiking activity parallels the slowly increasing and rapidly terminating drive state associated with food seeking. The motivational drive to find food grows during periods of increasing energy deficit (<a href=\"#bib51\">Saper et al., 2002</a>). During appropriate contexts, this drive should bias actions towards food-seeking, as demonstrated in rodents with increased exploration at the time of scheduled feeding (<a href=\"#bib45\">Moran and Tamashiro, 2007</a>, <a href=\"#bib44\">Mistlberger, 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib57\">Tan et al., 2014</a>). This behavior persists until a source of food is secured, at which point seeking must stop so that feeding can begin (<a href=\"#bib19\">Craig, 1917</a>, <a href=\"#bib10\">Berridge, 2004</a>). Our findings of slow diurnal increases and fast feeding-related decreases in AgRP neuron firing support the hypothesis that AgRP neurons may also encode a food-seeking drive that can be transiently shut off when food becomes available (<a href=\"#bib57\">Tan et al., 2014</a>), possibly to avoid further \u2018appetitive phase\u2019 food-seeking in lieu of consummatory behavior (<a href=\"#bib19\">Craig, 1917</a>, <a href=\"#bib10\">Berridge, 2004</a>). Similar to our recordings in AgRP neurons, previous studies involving a neural circuit that regulates drinking reported rapid <i>reductions</i> in firing of vasopressin-secreting supraoptic neurons during drinking of water (<a href=\"#bib2\">Arnauld and du Pont, 1982</a>, <a href=\"#bib55\">Stricker and Hoffmann, 2007</a>). These findings suggest that rapid reductions in firing of neurons promoting specific motivational drives during consumption may be a general mechanism. It is also possible that the fast modulation in spiking activity represents the anticipation of future meal-induced restoration of caloric deficit. To further distinguish between contributions of AgRP neurons to appetitive, consummatory, and/or anticipatory feeding behaviors, it will be instructive, in future studies, to (i) employ larger delays between delivery of food rewards (<a href=\"#bib15\">Cohen et al., 2012</a>; currently inter-reward interval was \u2265 2.5 s), (ii) use lever pressing rather than instrumental licking in order to distinguish requests for food from food consumption (<a href=\"#bib30\">Histed et al., 2012</a>), and (iii) use virtual reality methods in head-fixed mice (<a href=\"#bib23\">Dombeck et al., 2007</a>) to study simulated foraging activity with precise behavioral control and monitoring. Our demonstration that AgRP neuron activity recorded in awake, head-restrained mice shows similar changes as observed in freely moving mice (<a href=\"#bib12\">Betley et al., 2015</a>, <a href=\"#bib14\">Chen et al., 2015</a>), and that activation of AgRP neurons in head-fixed mice has similar effects on consummatory behaviors as previous studies in freely behaving mice (<a href=\"#bib1\">Aponte et al., 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib35\">Krashes et al., 2011</a>), sets the stage for using head-fixation as a means to probe this feeding circuit during well-controlled behaviors with precise behavioral monitoring, large numbers of trials, and easier experimental access to stable, dense recordings using electrophysiology or two-photon calcium imaging with fewer weight restrictions."

The recent observations of a rapid increase in population POMC calcium activity in response to food cues, to sustained feeding, as well as during brief individual bouts of licking of liquid food (<a href=\"#bib14\">Chen et al., 2015</a>) are consistent with our spiking data in ARC<sub>inh</sub> neurons. Optogenetic photostimulation of POMC neurons results in reduced food consumption, although this effect is only evident at longer timescales (<a href=\"#bib1\">Aponte et al., 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib68\">Zhan et al., 2013</a>). Our data suggest that at least some POMC neurons may act on faster timescales to reduce the drive to seek food. It remains an open question whether these opposing changes in firing are primarily driven by direct inhibition by AgRP neurons (<a href=\"#bib18\">Cowley et al., 2001</a>, <a href=\"#bib6\">Atasoy et al., 2012</a>), or by additional sources of fast input to these neurons (see above). Future studies can begin to elucidate which of the local and long-range sources of fast synaptic input to AgRP and POMC neurons (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Krashes et al., 2014</a>) are responsible for various fast and slower changes in firing that we have observed, using optetrode recordings from these inputs as well as by combining ARC recordings with methods for selective silencing of each source of input."

This allowed sub-second measurements of correlations between ARC neuron firing and lick microstructure, as well as sub-second correlations in firing between ARC neurons. Optetrode methods present some challenges, particularly in the ARC: the optetrode (\u223c300 \u03bcm in diameter, with 4\u20138 70 \u03bcm diameter tetrodes extending into the ARC) must penetrate approximately 5.5 mm into the brain to gain access to the relatively small ARC nucleus, likely resulting in lower yield. Similar to previous optetrode studies (e.g., <a href=\"#bib15\">Cohen et al., 2012</a>), some actual AgRP neurons may be classified as ARC<sub>other</sub> neurons in cases of insufficient photostimulation. While a previous study found that AgRP neurons almost exclusively decrease their calcium activity upon food presentation (<a href=\"#bib12\">Betley et al., 2015</a>), we only observed significant decreases in spiking in approximately two-thirds of AgRP neurons and noted increases in firing in 14\u201323% of AgRP neurons. These differences may reflect real heterogeneity across AgRP neurons, as previous studies have demonstrated anatomically and functionally distinct populations of AgRP neurons in the ARC (<a href=\"#bib11\">Betley et al., 2013</a>). Alternatively, experimental differences (e.g. different states of baseline meal expectation across paradigms) and/or a possible misclassification of a small number of non-AgRP cells as AgRP neurons could explain the heterogeneity in our data (for additional discussion, see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). As discussed above, recordings of GCaMP6 activity in populations of ARC neurons (<a href=\"#bib14\">Chen et al., 2015</a>) and single cells (<a href=\"#bib12\">Betley et al., 2015</a>) provide powerful complementary approaches to the method described here. Recordings using calcium indicators allow chronic monitoring of calcium activity in AgRP neurons, albeit with some caveats including temporal resolution, estimation of relative contributions of spike-evoked vs intracellular release of calcium, and the potential for neuropil contamination during single-cell recordings. By contrast, our current approach provides robust sensitivity to single action potentials, information regarding inter-spike interval structure of tonic vs bursting ARC neurons, and the capacity to record from both AgRP neurons and other ARC neurons simultaneously. In addition, our recordings of absolute spiking levels (in contrast to relative changes in calcium activity) revealed differences in baseline firing across times of day and across satiety states following refeeding as compared to free-feeding conditions. Together, these mutually informative studies demonstrate consistent changes in the activity of classes of ARC neurons across timescales and feeding behaviors, leading to refinements in the hypotheses regarding the potential roles of these neurons in feeding, food-seeking, valence coding and reinforcement learning, and suppression of competing drive states (<a href=\"#bib12\">Betley et al., 2015</a>, <a href=\"#bib14\">Chen et al., 2015</a>, <a href=\"#bib26\">Garfield et al., 2015</a>, <a href=\"#bib48\">Palmiter, 2015</a>, <a href=\"#bib53\">Seeley and Berridge, 2015</a>) across multiple timescales and behavioral paradigms."

In addition, our data suggest that AgRP and POMC neurons can be modulated on timescales inconsistent with a purely homeostatic role in feeding. In particular, the rapid drop in spiking activity of AgRP neurons at meal onset may reflect a termination of the drive to seek sources of food, while residual, persistent spiking in these neurons may reflect a sustained drive to consume food."

Mice were trained to consume a high-calorie liquid meal replacement (Ensure) from a lickspout, while head-fixed on a spherical treadmill. Licking was detected via disruption of an infrared beam positioned in front of the lickspout. Upon detection of a lick, a 10 \u00b5l drop of Ensure was released using a solenoid and MonkeyLogic software (<a href=\"#bib4\">Asaad and Eskandar, 2011</a>) in Matlab. After \u223c2\u20134 days of training, food-restricted mice would readily consume large quantities of Ensure. In a typical session, recordings began with spontaneous activity for \u223c5 min followed by a laser photostimulation protocol (\u223c5\u201310 min). After a variable period of time (5\u201310 min), a lickspout was positioned in front of the mouse's snout. After an additional variable period of time (3\u201315 min), Ensure was made available, and the mouse subsequently engaged in instrumental licking for food reward (delivered in 10-\u00b5l increments). We then recorded activity as long as the mouse continued to eat (typically 1 hr, with consumption of 3\u20135 ml of Ensure, equivalent to 4.5\u20137.5 Cal). The hour-long recording typically includes \u223c30 min of constant feeding, during which mice lick almost continuously and delivery of Ensure was contingent on detection of a lick. Of note, a minimal duration between Ensure drops was defined to be 2.5 s, even in periods of near-continuous licking behavior. This period of continuous feeding was then typically followed by more sparse bouts of feeding (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, orange highlights). If the mouse stopped drinking for a substantial period of time, the software delivered a drop of Ensure to encourage additional licking. However, these Ensure drops constituted &lt;15% of all drops delivered. When feeding further diminished, a second round of laser stimulation was performed to help with cell identification (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Mice were additionally given chow in their home cage (1.5\u20132 g, given between the hours of 6\u20138 PM) to help maintain a weight of approximately 87% of free-feeding weight. We confirmed that the chow was fully consumed by 8 AM the following morning, such that the subsequent recordings took place after at least 8 hr without access to food. In practice, since 2 g of chow is typically consumed within 4\u20135 hr, it is more likely that these recordings took place following at least 16 hr without feeding."

In the days following optetrode insertion (to depth of 4.8 mm ventral to Bregma), and prior to the beginning of recordings, tetrodes were gradually lowered by 0.5 mm (0.15 mm/day). All tetrodes were glued to the fiber with epoxy, such that the ends of the tetrodes were 400\u2013600 \u03bcm beyond the end of the fiber. Each tetrode was then gold plated (Gold NC Solution, Neuralynx Inc), to reach a final impedance between 500 and 800 K\u03a9. Neural signals and time stamps for behavior were recorded using a Digital Lynx SX recording system (Neuralynx). Broadband signals from each wire, filtered between 0.1 and 9000 \u2009Hz, were recorded continuously at 32 \u2009kHz. To extract the timing of spikes, signals were band-pass filtered between 400 and 6000 \u2009Hz. Spikes were detected whenever a signal crossed a selected threshold value. For each electrode, the threshold was defined as four times an estimated noise level. The standard deviation of the background noise was estimated as the median of the absolute value of the band-pass filtered recording, divided by 0.6745 (<a href=\"#bib24\">Donoho and Johnstone, 1994</a>, <a href=\"#bib50\">Quiroga et al., 2004</a>).

Second, for each spike, we defined two features, amplitude of the peak and amplitude of the valley, for each of the four electrodes within a tetrode (a total of 8 features). Clusters were then defined according to these feature distributions, manually selecting the dimensions that best separated different clusters. We used several criteria to include a neuron in our data set. First, we inspected the ISI distribution. A histogram of the ISI distribution for the spikes within each cluster is expected to show a refractory period, that is, a dearth of spikes that occur within milliseconds of each other (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hill et al., 2011</a>). Therefore, only clusters in which none of the ISIs were less than 1 ms and less than 5% of the ISIs were smaller than 5 ms were considered for further examination as candidates for single-units, thus ensuring minimal contamination. Second, the clustered waveforms were also inspected by eye to exclude those with aphysiological shapes. The waveform shape and amplitude were examined across the duration of the recording to ensure stability and reject the possibility of contamination by multiple neurons or potential loss of a neuron at an intermediate time within the recording. Finally, we performed cross-correlation between each spike waveform and the averaged waveform, and specified that the averaged correlation coefficient must exceed 0.95. To ensure stable recordings, we confirmed that the correlation coefficients between spikes in the first and last 5 min of recordings were not significantly different than those between the same number of randomly selected spikes across the recording. Recording sites were also verified histologically with electrolytic lesions at the termination of the experiment, when possible, using 15\u201320 \u2009s of 100\u2009\u03bcA direct current, or by visualizing the optical fiber track (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>)."

First, to classify AgRP neurons, we delivered blue-light photostimulation pulses at 20 Hz, a stimulation frequency shown to elicit feeding and as well as sustained spiking in ChR2-expressing AgRP neurons in vitro (<a href=\"#bib1\">Aponte et al., 2011</a>). Specifically, we delivered 1-s-long trains of 20-ms light pulses at 20 Hz (wavelength: 473 nm; intensity: 5\u201320 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>), with 3 s between pulse trains (typically 50\u2013100 trains were used at a given laser intensity). The laser beam was passed through a Pockels cell to ensure accurate control of laser pulse shape (&lt;0.2 ms timing accuracy) and amplitude (calibrated with a power meter and a photodiode). To ensure that spontaneous and light-evoked waveforms originated from the same cell, we validated that the correlation coefficients of the cross-correlations between spontaneous and light-evoked waveforms were above 0.95 and were not significantly different than the correlation between pairs of spontaneous spike waveforms (see also <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

This method was chosen because some clearly driven neurons showed more pronounced excitation after a delay of several 100's of milliseconds (see <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>; peri-stimulus time histograms show binned firing rates relative to laser train onset; estimated with 100-ms bins). For neurons that fired significantly below pre-train baseline (inhibited by AgRP neuron photostimulation) according to the above t-test, we added an additional criterion that the cells be suppressed by greater than 20% relative to baseline, which removed a subset of weakly but significantly inhibited cells (7% of all recorded cells). This class of cells was labeled \u2018ARC<sub>inh</sub>\u2019. Cells not significantly modulated according to the t-test were assigned to the \u2018ARC<sub>other</sub>\u2019 category. Finally, we noticed that in a small subset of recordings (&lt;10%), the initial trial of a 1-s laser pulse train in the series of 1-s trains could lead to a sharp increase or decrease in firing that did not return to pre-photostimulation baseline until 0\u20132 min after the end of the final laser photostimulation trial. We reasoned that these effects were clearly laser-evoked (two-sample Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov (KS) test, p &lt; 0.05), and thus, we also used this information in our classification. This additional criterion only changed the cell classification in 7% (2/33) of AgRP neurons and 12% (3/25) of ARC<sub>inh</sub> neurons and did not affect the main conclusions of the study. While histology showed reasonably high penetrance of ChR2 expression in AgRP neurons, the ARC<sub>other</sub> category may include a small subset of AgRP neurons lacking sufficient or any ChR2 expression, or that an insufficient intensity of light reached the tetrode on which the unit was recorded. Note that ARC<sub>other</sub> and ARC<sub>inh</sub> neurons were only included from recordings during or subsequent to identification of a putative AgRP neuron, to ensure that no neurons from regions dorsal to the ARC were included."

Neurons with low excitability and low-spontaneous firing rates in vivo may be unsuitable for identification protocols demanding entrainment at high frequencies (<a href=\"#bib38\">Kravitz et al., 2013</a>). This may be the case with AgRP neurons, whose excitability we found to be low in the morning (in ad libitum-fed mice, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>) and following feeding (in food-restricted mice, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). Further, the intrinsic membrane properties of AgRP neurons have themselves been shown to be state dependent (<a href=\"#bib8\">Baver et al., 2014</a>), thus providing an additional source of in vivo variability that may affect entrainment, but that is not present during most in vitro recordings (e.g., <a href=\"#bib1\">Aponte et al., 2011</a>). Moreover, AgRP neurons might also not show entrainment due to other cell-intrinsic mechanisms that would only be influential in certain in vivo contexts, in the presence of strong, summating synaptic input (<a href=\"#bib31\">Jo et al., 2005</a>). To quantify fast entrainment of spiking activity to each laser pulse, 50-ms cycle histograms were calculated in 5-ms bins (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). To determine significant laser entrainment, a shuffling procedure was applied to spikes during individual laser cycles (20 ms of laser stimulation followed by 30 ms of no laser stimulation). We created a distribution of shuffled cycle histograms by shuffling the spikes within a given cycle 5000 times while maintaining the same total number of spikes per cycle. We compared the firing rate in our cycle histogram of individual 5-ms bins with the distribution of shuffled cycle histograms to determine if any bins were significantly modulated by photostimulation (p &lt; 0.0001, corrected for number of neurons and number of bins)."

If the relationship is indeed linear, then one should be able to perfectly predict the moment-by-moment firing of the neuron as the sum of the following three terms: (i) a fixed constant firing rate (in spikes/s), (ii) the convolution of the \u2018lick\u2019 kernel (units: spikes/s/lick; <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>, left panels) with each individual lick, and (iii) the convolution of the \u2018lick bout\u2019 kernel (units: spikes/s/lick; <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>, left panels) with each individual lick bout.
