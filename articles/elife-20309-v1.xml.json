Here, we demonstrate that overexpression of DHFR in <i>E. coli</i> causes a toxic metabolic imbalance triggered by interactions with several functionally related enzymes. Though deleterious in the overexpression regime, surprisingly, these interactions are beneficial at physiological concentrations, implying their functional significance <i>in vivo</i>. Moreover, we found that overexpression of orthologous DHFR proteins had minimal effect on all levels of cellular organization - molecular, systems, and phenotypic, in sharp contrast to <i>E. coli</i> DHFR. Dramatic difference of GDT between '<i>E. coli</i>'s self' and 'foreign' proteins suggests the crucial role of evolutionary selection in shaping protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks at the whole proteome level. This study shows how protein overexpression perturbs a dynamic metabolon of weak yet potentially functional PPI, with consequences for the metabolic state of cells and their fitness."
