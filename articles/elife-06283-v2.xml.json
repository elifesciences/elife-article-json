Herein, we found that <i>MAF1</i> knockdown induced <i>CDKN1A</i> transcription and chromatin looping concurrently with Pol III recruitment. Simultaneous knockdown of <i>MAF1</i> with Pol III or <i>BRF1</i> (subunit of TFIIIB) diminished the activation and looping effect, which indicates that recruiting Pol III was required for activation of Pol II-mediated transcription and chromatin looping. Chromatin-immunoprecipitation analysis after <i>MAF1</i> knockdown indicated enhanced binding of Pol III and BRF1, as well as of CFP1, p300, and PCAF, which are factors that mediate active histone marks, along with the binding of TATA binding protein (TBP) and POLR2E to the <i>CDKN1A</i> promoter. Simultaneous knockdown with Pol III abolished these regulatory events. Similar results were obtained for <i>GDF15</i>. Our results reveal a novel mechanism by which MAF1 and Pol III regulate the activity of a protein-coding gene transcribed by Pol II."

Herein, we found that <i>MAF1</i> knockdown induced <i>CDKN1A</i> transcription and chromatin looping concurrently with Pol III recruitment. Simultaneous knockdown of <i>MAF1</i> with Pol III or <i>BRF1</i> (subunit of TFIIIB) diminished the activation and looping effect, which indicates that recruiting Pol III was required for activation of Pol II-mediated transcription and chromatin looping. Chromatin-immunoprecipitation analysis after <i>MAF1</i> knockdown indicated enhanced binding of Pol III and BRF1, as well as of CFP1, p300, and PCAF, which are factors that mediate active histone marks, along with the binding of TATA binding protein (TBP) and POLR2E to the <i>CDKN1A</i> promoter. Simultaneous knockdown with Pol III abolished these regulatory events. Similar results were obtained for <i>GDF15</i>. Our results reveal a novel mechanism by which MAF1 and Pol III regulate the activity of a protein-coding gene transcribed by Pol II."

MAF1 represses Pol III transcription through association with BRF1, a subunit of initiation factor TFIIIB, which prevents attachment of TFIIIB onto DNA. This interaction also inhibits Pol III from binding to BRF1, which in turn prevents recruitment of Pol III to Pol III promoters. Furthermore, MAF1 also inhibits Pol III transcription through direct binding with Pol III, which interferes with the recruitment of Pol III to the assembled TFIIIB/DNA complexes (<a href=\"#bib11\">Desai et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Vannini et al., 2010</a>). In addition, association of MAF1 with Pol III-transcribed genes has been detected genome-wide concomitant with an increase in occupation during repression; this indicates that direct interaction of MAF1 with Pol III genes is also an important attribute of repression (<a href=\"#bib31\">Roberts et al., 2006</a>)."

Simultaneous knockdown of Pol III and <i>MAF1</i> abolished both promoter looping and activation of <i>CDKN1A</i> transcription, which indicates that Pol III actively participated in regulation of Pol II genes.

We noticed a MIR3 element (a SINE with Pol III promoter) that could be transcribed by Pol III and therefore might represent the target-binding site of MAF1. To test this possibility, we used an in vitro DNA binding reaction (<a href=\"#bib5\">Britten, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Toth and Biggin, 2000</a>) to examine whether purified MAF1 protein could bind to the cloned <i>CDKN1A</i> promoter. Consistent with ChIP, in vitro DNA binding assay showed that purified MAF1 protein could indeed bind to the <i>CDKN1A</i> promoter that contained the MIR3 element (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>), but the binding was abolished when the MIR3 repeat element was deleted, which indicates specificity of MAF1 binding to the MIR3 element (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>). To further show that the Pol III promoter of the MIR3 element is responsible for the binding, an in vitro binding assay was carried out with DNA in which the MIR3 DNA sequence from the <i>CDKN1A</i> promoter had a deleted or mutated A-box sequence (Pol III promoter element). In vitro DNA-protein binding assays performed by the above method or colorimetric assay (Abcam, ab117139) both showed that the DNA with deleted or mutated A-box sequences exhibited significantly lower binding of MAF1, which indicates the specificity of MAF1 for the Pol III promoter element (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013C</a>). Moreover, consistent with ChIP data, MAF1 did not bind in vitro to the <i>ACTB</i> promoter that did not contain a SINE or sequences that would resemble the Pol III promoter element (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of direct binding of MAF1 to a specific DNA sequence."

To directly demonstrate the enhancement of Pol II transcription by removing MAF1 and recruiting Pol III, we carried out in vitro transcription using commercial HeLa cell nuclear extract. Constructed DNA templates of the genes analyzed are described in the \u2018Materials and methods\u2019. The in vitro, newly transcribed RNA was labeled with biotin, and the products were affinity purified. The nature of the affinity-purified nascent RNA was then analyzed by qRT-PCR. Negative control without biotin labeling was used. First, we showed that the in vitro transcription was indeed mediated by Pol II by inhibition of transcription either by \u03b1-amanitin treatment (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>) or by depletion of Pol II in the extract using anti-Pol II antibody (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>).

Microarray analysis showed that 124 genes were upregulated after <i>MAF1</i> knockdown. Of these, 76% contained SINEs within the promoter region, which indicates the regulation potential of these genes by MAF1 and Pol III. However, microarray analysis of steady-state mRNA level alone is not sufficient to show whether these genes are directly regulated by MAF1 at the transcriptional level or as the result of downstream secondary effects. Further analysis using in vitro transcription, reporter gene analysis, and nuclear run-on would be required to unambiguously establish how general Pol II genes are regulated by MAF1 and Pol III. In vitro transcription using HeLa cell extracts with depletion or addition of specific transcription regulators could provide very strong support of the involvement of specific factors in transcription regulation."

Active Pol III-transcribed genes and non-coding RNAs often associate with Pol II transcription start sites. Pol II and its associated epigenetic marks are also present at active Pol III-transcribed genes (<a href=\"#bib4\">Barski et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Raha et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Canella et al., 2012</a>). This shows that there is common epigenetic regulation between these two types of transcription units, and the polymerases may work with one another to regulate gene expression. Indeed, cross-talk between Pol III and Pol II transcription factors, such as TFIIS in Pol III transcription, has also been reported in yeast and mice (<a href=\"#bib12\">Ghavi-Helm et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Carriere et al., 2011</a>). The core Pol III transcription factor TFIIIC can also directly regulate transcription from a Pol II promoter (<a href=\"#bib19\">Kleinschmidt et al., 2011</a>). Binding of TFIIIC to SINE promoters has been shown to mediate the relocation and transcription of neuronal genes (<a href=\"#bib9\">Crepaldi et al., 2013</a>). <i>RPPH1</i>, to which BRF2, Pol III, GTF2B, and Pol II bind, can be transcribed by either Pol II or Pol III (<a href=\"#bib17\">James Faresse et al., 2012</a>). Our results indicate that Pol III and Pol II association may have functional relevance for genome functional organization, because simultaneous knockdown of both Pol III and <i>MAF1</i> diminished the induced active transcription caused by knockdown of only <i>MAF1</i>. Furthermore, enhanced binding of TBP to TFIIIB and TFIIB can lead to formation of Pol III and Pol II complexes to initiate transcription (<a href=\"#bib39\">Zhao et al., 2003</a>). We propose that this type of SINE-associated-Pol II promoter architecture may introduce an additional layer of control in gene expression."

Johnson et al. showed that MAF1 binds to the Elk-1-binding site of the <i>TBP</i> promoter to prevent the binding of Elk-1. Indeed, there is a SINE with an A-box (\u221210 to +1) and B-box (\u2212105 to \u221295) that encompass the Elk-1-binding site of the <i>TBP</i> promoter. In our analysis, <i>MAF1</i> knockdown only slightly increased <i>TBP</i> expression (1.6-fold) compared with the results reported by Johnson et al. (twofolds). This may be due to the already high expression of <i>TBP</i> in cell lines, and we did not detect binding of MAF1 to this active promoter."

Removal of <i>MAF1</i> by knockdown then leads to recruitment of TFIIIB through enhanced binding of TBP; the shared surface of TBP then directs both Pol II and Pol III binding through association with TFIIB and TFIIIB, respectively. Further recruitment of active regulatory factors would then induce transcription by Pol II and Pol III. This model is consistent with those proposed by previous studies, which were based on a component of TBP-associated complexes, p300, interacting with SET1C-coupled histone modifications to activate <i>CDKN1A</i> transcription (<a href=\"#bib2\">Abraham et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Tang et al., 2013</a>). Moreover, our model is also supported by a previous study on the relocation of inducible neuronal genes to transcription factors that involve acetylation of distal promoter SINEs by p300 (<a href=\"#bib9\">Crepaldi et al., 2013</a>)."

Chromatin was immunoprecipitated by using Pol III (ab96328, Abcam), Pol II (ab5131, Abcam), MAF1 (GTX106776, Acris), H3K4me3 (04\u2013745, Millipore; Billerica, MA), H3K27me3 (ABE44, Millipore), TBP (ab28175, Abcam), H3K9Ace (06\u2013942, Millipore), H3K27Ace (07\u2013360, Millipore), CFP1 (ABE211, Millipore), p300 (05\u2013257, Millipore), POLR2E (ab180151, Abcam) BRF1 (ab74221, Abcam)or IgG (ab46540, Abcam) antibody, with 10 \u03bcg/ml of BSA and 50 \u03bcl of Dynabeads Protein A and G (Invitrogen) for overnight at 4\u00b0C. The beads were washed once with each washing buffer, including low salt immune complex wash buffer, high salt immune complex wash buffer, and LiCl immune complex wash buffer, and twice with 1\u00d7 TE buffer. Precipitates were eluted with 1% of SDS and 100 mM of NaHCO<sub>3</sub>. Proteinase K was added to the samples, and rotated at 65\u00b0C for 2 hr followed by 95\u00b0C for 10 min and cooled down to room temperature. RNase A was added and samples were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 hr. After genomic DNA extraction, qPCR was performed. The degree of enrichment is calculated relative to the ratio of signals obtained in the input DNA fraction subtracting IgG-immunoprecipitated DNA."

After the addition of Triton-X to a final concentration of 1.8% to sequester the SDS, the mixture was incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 hr, which was followed by the addition of 800 U of PstI and incubation at 37\u00b0C overnight to digest the chromatin. The reaction was terminated by adding SDS to a final volume of 1.6% and then the solution heated to 65\u00b0C for 20 min. Ligation of DNA in situ was carried out using 0.5\u20132.0 ng/\u03bcl of chromatin in 800 \u03bcl of ligation buffer (NEB; Ipswich, MA) plus 1% Triton-X and 30 Weiss Units of T4 ligase (NEB) for 4 hr at 16\u00b0C. After reversing of the crosslinks with proteinase K digestion at 65\u00b0C overnight, the DNA was purified by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. The ligation products were detected by PCR using primers located near Pst1 cutting sites. The PCR products were purified from an agarose gel, cloned and sequenced."

However, the reviewers found several issues that must be addressed in the revised manuscript before it could be recommended for publication:"

The two genes examined throughout the manuscript, <i>CDKN1A</i> and <i>GDF15</i>, are the two most potently transcribed p53 target genes (Allen et al., <i>eLife</i> 2014). However, the authors do not examine the effects that p53 may play in their system. It is entirely possible that most of the effects described upon <i>MAF1</i> knockdown are driven indirectly by activation of p53 downstream of a cellular stress response caused by deregulated RNAPIII function. The authors should check for p53 induction upon <i>MAF1</i> knockdown. Key experiments should be repeated in an isogenic system -/+ p53. This could be done with stable p53 knockdown MCF7 cells (Agami et al.) or HCT116 p53 -/+ cells (Vogelstein et al.)."

However, the occupancy of Pol III prior to <i>MAF1</i> knockdown is relatively very weak. Thus, we speculate that since the down-regulation of <i>CDKN1A</i> and <i>GDF15</i> is not as efficient as tRNA genes after Pol III knockdown, the amount of Pol III binding at <i>CDKN1A</i> and <i>GDF15</i> prior to <i>MAF1</i> knockdown may be too low to be differentiated from background (MAF1/Pol III knockdown). Thus, although knockdown Pol III showed a decrease in Pol III binding at tRNA genes, the amount of Pol III is relatively the same as the <i>CDKN1A</i> and <i>GDF15</i> knockdown control and MAF1/Pol III knockdown. It is possible that there is a minor subpopulation of alleles with Pol III bound at the promoter, and they are responsible for the low level background transcription. Knockdown of Pol III will thus reduce the background expression level from this subset of alleles. However, the low level of binding does not allow us to show that unequivocally. Therefore, we modify the manuscript in the Discussion to state that Pol III may be able to regulate expression of <i>CDKN1A</i> and <i>GDF15</i>, before <i>MAF1</i> knockdown, but the low level of Pol III binding prior to <i>MAF1</i> knockdown does not allow us to validate this possibility unequivocally (Discussion)."
