The viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) causes the TSS/surrounding region to undergo a conformational shift postulated to inhibit translation. Using optical tweezers (OT) and steered molecular dynamic simulations (SMD), we found that the unusual stability of pseudoknotted element H4a/\u03a8<sub>3</sub> required five upstream adenylates, and H4a/\u03a8<sub>3</sub> was necessary for cooperative association of two other hairpins (H5/H4b) in Mg<sup>2+</sup>. SMD recapitulated the TSS unfolding order in the absence of Mg<sup>2+</sup>, showed dependence of the resistance to pulling on the 3D orientation and gave structural insights into the measured contour lengths of the TSS structure elements. Adenylate mutations eliminated one-site RdRp binding to the 3\u2019UTR, suggesting that RdRp binding to the adenylates disrupts H4a/\u03a8<sub>3</sub>, leading to loss of H5/H4b interaction and promoting a conformational switch interrupting translation and promoting replication."

The viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) causes the TSS/surrounding region to undergo a conformational shift postulated to inhibit translation. Using optical tweezers (OT) and steered molecular dynamic simulations (SMD), we found that the unusual stability of pseudoknotted element H4a/\u03a8<sub>3</sub> required five upstream adenylates, and H4a/\u03a8<sub>3</sub> was necessary for cooperative association of two other hairpins (H5/H4b) in Mg<sup>2+</sup>. SMD recapitulated the TSS unfolding order in the absence of Mg<sup>2+</sup>, showed dependence of the resistance to pulling on the 3D orientation and gave structural insights into the measured contour lengths of the TSS structure elements. Adenylate mutations eliminated one-site RdRp binding to the 3\u2019UTR, suggesting that RdRp binding to the adenylates disrupts H4a/\u03a8<sub>3</sub>, leading to loss of H5/H4b interaction and promoting a conformational switch interrupting translation and promoting replication."

Driven by conformational plasticity, RNA elements can assume alternative forms required for different biological functions (<a href=\"#bib11\">Dethoff et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Simon and Gehrke, 2009</a>). For example, riboswitches in untranslated regions (UTRs) of bacterial genes can cycle between active and inactive conformations through binding to small metabolites, thereby inhibiting translation or attenuating transcription of downstream genes (<a href=\"#bib41\">Soukup and Soukup, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Winkler and Breaker, 2003</a>). Regulatory RNA elements found in viral RNA genomes can also switch between mutually exclusive conformations to regulate incompatible processes such as translation and replication (<a href=\"#bib8\">D'Souza and Summers, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Huthoff and Berkhout, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Patel et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Simon and Gehrke, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Stammler et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Stupina et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Yuan et al., 2009</a>)."

TCV is a positive-strand RNA virus (genus Carmovirus, family <i>Tombusviridae</i>) with a single uncapped, non-poly(A) genome of 4053 nt encoding five proteins (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The TCV 3\u2019UTR contains at least five hairpins (H4, H4a, H4b, H5 and Pr) and three critical H-type pseudoknots (\u03a8<sub>1</sub>, \u03a8<sub>2</sub>, \u03a8<sub>3</sub>) (<a href=\"#bib27\">McCormack et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Simon and Miller, 2013</a>), a type of RNA structure that forms when loop residues in a hairpin pair with nearby\u00a0residues to create a second stem-loop. The coaxially stacked double pseudoknots H4a/\u03a8<sub>3</sub> and H4b/\u03a8<sub>2</sub> in conjunction with hairpin H5 fold into a T-shaped structure known as the TSS (<a href=\"#bib27\">McCormack et al., 2008</a>). The TSS serves as a 3\u2019CITE by binding to 80S ribosomes at the P-site through an interaction with the 60S ribosomal subunit (<a href=\"#bib43\">Stupina et al., 2008</a>). Substituting the entire TSS or H4a/\u03a8<sub>3</sub>/H4b with the analogous regions from the related <i>Cardamine chlorotic fleck virus</i> (CCFV) led to viral genomic (g)RNA accumulation that was similar to or greater than wild-type (wt) TCV. In contrast, TCV gRNA accumulated poorly when individual hairpins or other combinations of CCFV hairpins and pseudoknots were substituted. These results suggested that all, or a specific subset of hairpins and pseudoknots, function as a structural domain or subdomain (<a href=\"#bib27\">McCormack et al., 2008</a>)."

The TSS region is also important for replication of a small, non-translated satellite RNA (satC) that contains two TCV-derived 3\u2019 regions (<a href=\"#bib60\">Zhang et al., 2006a</a>, <a href=\"#bib61\">2006b</a>). The basal TSS conformation did not change substantially when bound to ribosomes (<a href=\"#bib44\">Stupina et al., 2011</a>), but was significantly altered when a 3\u2019UTR fragment (252 nt) or a 320 nt 3\u2019 terminal fragment was bound by the RdRp (<a href=\"#bib56\">Yuan et al., 2009</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"#bib57\">2012</a>). Prominent changes included enhanced flexibility of: (1) hairpin H3 in the coat protein ORF and adjacent upstream sequences; (2) the terminal loop of hairpin H4 located just upstream of the TSS; and (3)\u00a0H4a/\u03a8<sub>3\u00a0</sub>in the TSS. Sequences with reduced flexibility included: (1)\u00a0the 5\u2019 side of the basal stem of H5; (2) the sequence between H4b and H5; and (3) the A-rich sequence upstream of H4a.

For this current\u00a0report, optical tweezers (OT), a type of single molecule force spectroscopy, and steered molecular dynamic simulations (SMD) were used to examine the folding/unfolding pathways of the TSS. Our results indicate that the TSS follows an unexpected folding pathway that can be reproduced by SMD for conditions that exclude Mg<sup>2+</sup>. In the absence of Mg<sup>2+</sup>, H4b unfolded first, followed by H5 and then H4a/\u03a8<sub>3</sub>, which had been predicted to be the least stable element. In the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup>, H4b unfolded cooperatively with H5, followed by H4a/\u03a8<sub>3</sub>. Mg<sup>2+</sup> was not required to form H4a/\u03a8<sub>3</sub> but enhanced the stability of H4a/\u03a8<sub>3</sub> and all other elements tested. Disrupting H4a/\u03a8<sub>3</sub> eliminated the cooperative unfolding of H4b and H5, and H4a/\u03a8<sub>3</sub> was unstable in the absence of the upstream stretch of five adenylates. Mutating two of these adenylates\u00a0or adjacent downstream residues eliminated specific binding of RdRp to a 3\u2019UTR fragment, suggesting a model where binding of the RdRp to the five\u00a0adenylate region disrupts H4a/\u03a8<sub>3</sub>, leading to loss of interaction between H5 and H4b and promoting the conformational switch that interrupts translation and promotes replication."

A truncated version of this fragment that terminated precisely at the two pseudoknots and omitted the upstream five adenylates (5A) (positions 11 to 110 in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) was subsequently used to determine the TSS structure by NMR and SAXS (<a href=\"#bib64\">Zuo et al., 2010</a>). This shorter fragment was not initially stable, and stability required addition of two guanylates at the 5\u2019 end that extended \u03a8<sub>3</sub> and disrupted hairpin H4a. One possibility for why the TSS-only fragment was not stable was the omission of the upstream 5A, as it was subsequently shown that adjacent doublet mutations in 5A (positions 8 and 9 in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) or single mutations disrupting \u03a8<sub>3</sub> caused identical enhancements in flexibility of residues throughout the 5A/H4a/\u03a8<sub>3</sub> region as assayed by in-line structure probing (<a href=\"#bib56\">Yuan et al., 2009</a>).

To investigate this further, we examined the unfolding/folding behavior and stability (i.e., resistance to pulling force) of single TSS molecules under the induction of force using optical tweezers, a form of single molecule force spectroscopy that can be used to investigate conformational changes in single RNAs (<a href=\"#bib16\">Green et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Greenleaf et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Li et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Liphardt et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Ritchie and Woodside, 2015</a>). TSS118 was joined to 500-nt RNA handles at its 5\u2019 and 3\u2019 ends, which were made double stranded after hybridization to complementary DNA tagged with biotin or digoxigenin (DIG). The biotin DNA handle was attached to a streptavidin-coated polystyrene bead and the DIG DNA handle was attached to an anti-digoxigenin (AD)-coated bead. The streptavidin bead was held in place by a micropipette fixed on a glass chamber and the AD bead was held in an optical trap, which allowed the location of the focal point of the trap to be moved by a piezo (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). By moving the focal point of the optical trap mechanically, the AD bead was pulled away from the pipette, allowing the connected single-stranded TSS to unfold. Alternatively, the AD bead in the optical trap was repositioned proximal to the pipette, leading to TSS refolding (<a href=\"#bib48\">Tinoco et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Vilfan et al., 2007</a>).

In the absence of Mg<sup>2+</sup>, the TSS was expected to unfold with three transitions, corresponding to hairpins H4a, H4b, and H5.

At higher force, three transitions (termed \u2018rips\u2019) labeled \u20181\u2019, \u20182\u2019, and \u20183\u2019 appeared in stepwise fashion, corresponding to successive unfolding of three TSS structural elements (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, red line). No rips were observed when the force exceeded 20 pN (data not shown). When the force was released, the TSS refolded in three successive steps corresponding to its three unfolding transitions (3, 2, and 1; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, blue line). Differences in the force required to unfold and fold the individual elements signified hysteric characteristics of the two processes due to the slow unfolding/folding rate of the molecule as compared to the fast loading rate of the applied force, suggesting that these transitions were taking place outside of their thermal equilibrium."

The elements involved in each\u00a0transition in the extension vs time curves were identified by their disappearance followed hybridization with complementary oligonucleotides (for H4b and H5) or mutations in H4a/\u03a8<sub>3</sub> (data not shown).\u00a0At critical force levels, in the absence of Mg<sup>2+</sup>, three hopping transitions were observed when TSS118 was held at constant force for 1.5 to 2 min, consistent with the three transitions found by force ramping (H4b, H5 and H4a/\u03a8<sub>3</sub>) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). In the absence of Mg<sup>2+</sup>, H4b unfolded at 10 to 13.5 pN, H5 at 13 to 15.5 pN, and H4a/\u03a8<sub>3</sub> at 14.5 to 18.5 pN (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Slowly increasing the force extended the time the hairpins spent in the unfolded state. For example, H4b spent less than 20% of its time in an unfolded state at 11.5 pN, 96% of the time at 13 pN and 100% at 14 pN and higher. Mg<sup>2+</sup> increased the mechanical stability of all TSS elements, with H4b now unfolding between 13 and 16.5 pN; H5 from 14.5 to 17.5 pN; and H4a/\u03a8<sub>3</sub> from 16.5 to 18 pN (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>; the slightly higher unfolding force [19.95\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.06 pN] of H4a/\u03a8<sub>3</sub> obtained by force ramping might be due to the effect of the force loading rate [<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>]). In addition, cooperative unfolding of H4b and H5 was only observed in the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> (hops labeled with asterisks in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a> and not observed in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Mg<sup>2+</sup> also caused abrupt changes in the hopping behavior of H4b and H4a/\u03a8<sub>3</sub>. The unfolded state for H4b was less than 1% of the total time at 15 pN, changing to 40% at 15.5 pN, and was nearly 100% at 16 pN (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). For H4a/\u03a8<sub>3</sub>in Mg<sup>2+</sup>, the unfolded state was less than 1% of the total time at 17.5 pN and 100% of total time at 18 pN (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). These results show that unfolding of H4b and H4a/\u03a8<sub>3</sub> in Mg<sup>2+</sup> reflects brittle behavior, meaning that in the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup>, the distance from the unfolded state of these elements is much closer to their transition states."

Since the TSS is a central hub for RNA interactions within the 3\u2019UTR and upstream sequences (<a href=\"#bib57\">Yuan et al., 2012</a>), it seemed possible that the widespread conformational rearrangement could be triggered by RdRp binding to, and disrupting, the TSS. One consequence of RdRp binding to fragments containing the TSS was reduced flexibility of 5A residues, suggesting that this motif might be a target site for the RdRp (<a href=\"#bib56\">Yuan et al., 2009</a>). To assess the validity of this hypothesis, RdRp filter binding assays were conducted on an extended 3\u2019 fragment (positions 3858 to 4053) to determine if binding dissociation constants were affected by mutations in 5A. Recombinant TCV RdRp bound to the wt fragment with a K<sub>d</sub> = 2.6 \u03bcM (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). In contrast, RdRp did not exhibit specific one-site binding to MDV (midivariant RNA, 221 nt), which is a non-template satellite RNA associated with Q\u03b2 bacteriophage. A two nucleotide mutation in 5A at positions 8 and 9 (A to U; m74) prevented specific binding of RdRp to the fragment. Loss of specific binding supports our previous finding that m74 also reduced RdRp-directed in vitro transcription of this fragment by 3.6-fold (<a href=\"#bib56\">Yuan et al., 2009</a>). The ability of the RdRp to continue transcribing low levels of complementary strands in the absence of 5A binding is likely due to the presence of the 3\u2019 terminal Pr hairpin, which in combination with upstream hairpin H4 can promote a low level of transcription (<a href=\"#bib46\">Sun and Simon, 2006</a>). Since mutations in 5A disrupt the stability of H4a/\u03a8<sub>3,</sub> RNA fragments were also examined that contained mutations in \u03a8<sub>3</sub>. Two individual alterations in the loop of H4a (m27, m41) improved binding of the RdRp to the template by 2.5-fold. In contrast, mutations in the two partner residues of m27 and m41 located just downstream of 5A (m26, m40) eliminated one-site binding to the template (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). These results suggest that disruption of H4a/\u03a8<sub>3</sub> (which occurs when the adenylates are altered in m74) is not the proximal cause of the loss of specific RdRp binding, but rather the RdRp may be specifically interacting with 5A and adjacent downstream sequences, and this interaction may be facilitated by the absence of \u03a8<sub>3</sub>."

Full base-pair opening for the extension of the 5\u2019 and 3\u2019 ends could be achieved by an additional equilibration step at the end of these simulations (i.e., with holding to maintain the extension, but without pulling) or by slowing down the pulling speed to 0.1 \u00c5/ps. These runs yielded an unfolding sequence different from the experimental results, even at the 0.05 \u00c5/ps pulling speed (resulting in the longest practical explicit solvent simulation times). The key observation based on these simulations was that pulling speed affected the orientation of helices relative to the direction of pulling (refer to Appendix 1\u00a0for more details). This led to formation of new, transient tertiary interactions by H4b after all hydrogen bonds between H4b and \u03a8<sub>2</sub> opened, increasing the resistance to pulling and impacting the order of TSS unfolding. These observations are consistent with results of OT unfolding of a pseudoknot (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chen et al., 2007</a>). Introducing a pause in the pulling simulation immediately after \u03a8<sub>2</sub> opening to re-equilibrate the system and avoid transient H4b interactions changed the order of TSS opening events to H4b opening first, followed by H5 and then H4a."

In addition, as was the case in the majority of the explicit solvent simulations at higher pulling speeds, in the few implicit solvent simulations in which H4b opened last, strong tertiary interactions occurred between H4b loop residues and other nucleotides after the original base pairs involved in \u03a8<sub>2</sub> opened. The resulting tertiary structure was oriented approximately in parallel with the direction of pulling.

Unfolding begins with C<sub>6</sub> and 5A adenylates losing their initial triple interactions with \u03a8<sub>3</sub> and the extended pairing in \u03a8<sub>3</sub> (A<sub>11</sub>). Next, the stacking between H4a and H4b is opened (C<sub>34</sub> and G<sub>35</sub> are pulled apart). This is followed by \u03a8<sub>2</sub> opening and H4b pivoting toward vertical (perpendicular to the direction of pulling) without forming any transitional tertiary interactions and unwinding fully as the first of the major TCV TSS helices. In the next stage, the entire H5 opens. Finally, H4a/\u03a8<sub>3</sub> opens with H4a helix pairs opening from the 5\u2019\u22123\u2019 end toward the hairpin. The illustrated simulation exhibited separation of H4b from pseudoknot \u03a8<sub>2</sub> without any transient tertiary interactions, and this clean transition appears to contribute to the clearly defined sequence of events. The individual helices open sequentially, one at a time, rather than partially and in parallel (concurrently). The latter scenario was observed in many SMD simulations at all pulling speeds, although it was most pronounced at faster pulling speeds. For example, rather than \u2018waiting for its turn\u2019 to begin opening, H4a/\u03a8<sub>3</sub> opens its 5\u2019\u22123\u2019 base pair or pairs and pauses as weaker base pairs open elsewhere in the TCV. Gradual changes in the hydrogen-bond interactions that maintain the pseudoknotted 3D topology of the 5\u2019 end are similar to the case of H4b \u2018slipping\u2019 (see Appendix\u00a01). This scenario could explain the difference between estimated (13.6 nm) and experimental (9.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.5 nm) contour length of H4a/\u03a8<sub>3</sub>, which would not include any \u2018premature\u2019 base pair openings. In multiple runs, we observed partial opening of H4a/\u03a8<sub>3</sub> foreshortening the contour length, first to 11.2 nm (C<sub>12</sub> through G<sub>30</sub> or G<sub>13</sub> through C<sub>31</sub>), and then to 9.4 nm (U<sub>15</sub> through G<sub>30</sub>), after which the remaining structure opened rapidly. Similar foreshortening of the contour length was also observed for the opening simulations of H5. A pause in unzipping is predicted for the substructure between C<sub>71</sub> and G<sub>100</sub>, followed by a rapid opening of H5, especially across the non-canonical pairing in its large internal loop. The contour length of this substructure is 17.7 nm, well within the experimental measurements.

How the TSS along with at least 300 nt at the 3\u2019 end of the TCV gRNA convert between the two conformations is unknown. In the T-shaped structure, the TSS contains hairpin H5 in conjunction with the coaxially stacked pseudoknots H4a/\u03a8<sub>3</sub> and H4b/\u03a8<sub>2</sub> (<a href=\"#bib27\">McCormack et al., 2008</a>). Based on Mfold-predicted \u0394G\u2019s for the three TSS hairpins, H4a (in the absence of the pseudoknot) should be the least stable element (\u0394G\u00a0=\u00a0\u22126.9 kcal/mol), followed by H4b (\u0394G\u00a0=\u00a0\u22129.2 kcal/mol), and H5 (\u0394G\u00a0=\u00a0\u221221.8 kcal/mol).

In addition to H5 being substantially less stable than expected, it also has a smaller than expected contour length (15 to 17 nm compared with the expected length of 25 nm). Reduced stability of H5 may reflect instability of its lower stem (~5.9 nm) (<a href=\"#bib27\">McCormack et al., 2008</a>), which might unfold at a lower force range, as suggested by SMD.

In the presence of upstream sequences, including 5A and sequences that form \u03a8<sub>3</sub>, H4a/\u03a8<sub>3</sub> is the most stable TSS element and folding is independent of Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig3\">3</a>). High force was also necessary to unfold the human telomerase pseudoknot (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chen et al., 2007</a>). Stability of H4a/\u03a8<sub>3</sub> was dependent upon association with the upstream 5A as the element did not form when the adenylates were converted to uridylates (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). 5AtoU also caused structural changes in H4a/\u03a8<sub>3</sub> residues (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>), similar to what was previously found when just A<sub>9</sub> and A<sub>10</sub> were altered, or \u03a8<sub>3</sub> was disrupted (<a href=\"#bib56\">Yuan et al., 2009</a>).

It is therefore possible that interactions other than those proposed in the model and that are stable in MD simulations form between 5A and H4a/\u03a8<sub>3.</sub> H4a/\u03a8<sub>3</sub> may also be highly stable due to its coaxially stacked stems, creating base-pair planes perpendicular to the direction of the unfolding force requiring high force to overcome resistance of multiple base pairs at the same time. Computer simulations of the unfolding pathway support this hypothesis by indicating that the structural resistance to pulling is increased for the TSS pseudoknotted motifs beyond their free energy predictions by their orientation parallel (and nearly co-axial) to the direction of pulling (along the top of the TSS\u2019s \u2018T\u2019 shape). Of the two pseudoknots, the long-distance \u03a8<sub>2</sub> is weaker than the short-distance H-type \u03a8<sub>3</sub> and opens first, exposing H4b and H5, now oriented approximately perpendicular to the direction of pulling. H4b is shorter (and has a higher predicted free energy) and opens first, followed by H5. Beside the alignment between the motif axis and the direction of pulling, akin to \u2018static resistance', we observed what could be labeled as \u2018kinetic resistance\u2019 based on the formation of transient (\u2018slipping\u2019) tertiary interaction between the helices oriented (initially or transiently) along the direction of pulling and in the proximity of other (downstream or upstream) parts of the TSS. For example, \u03a8<sub>3</sub> opens gradually and, as the entire \u03a8<sub>3</sub> motif opens, transient tertiary interactions outside of the original \u03a8<sub>3</sub> base pairs maintain the pseudoknot topology, thus increasing the resistance to pulling and delaying the opening of H4a/\u03a8<sub>3</sub>."

We propose that a basal conformation of the 3\u2019UTR contains the TSS, which serves as a 3\u2019CITE for translation of the RdRp from the gRNA template when the gRNA first enters a cell. When a threshold level of RdRp has been synthesized, the RdRp binds to the 5A region that includes \u03a8<sub>3</sub> residues, disrupting H4a/\u03a8<sub>3</sub>, which consequently disrupts the interaction between H4b and H5. Since the TSS serves as a central hub for interactions throughout the region (<a href=\"#bib57\">Yuan et al., 2012</a>), disruption of the TSS would likely cause additional structural changes leading to the alternative conformation of the RNA that is found upon RdRp binding. Although this site of RdRp binding is distal to the 3\u2019end where transcription commences, previous results indicated that a structural connection exists between the 3\u2019 terminus and the 5A region (<a href=\"#bib57\">Yuan et al., 2012</a>), which could place the 3\u2019 end in a position to be accessed by the 5A-bound RdRp. We believe that this scenario provides an intriguing blueprint for possible RNA structural transitions in other viruses with 3' translation elements."

A fragment including C5 through A<sub>112</sub> (marked in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>), to which we will refer as TSS108, was selected for SMD because it contained all TCV TSS stable interactions and limited the maximum single-stranded chain extension, helping to keep the explicit solvent systems as small as possible (discussed further in the Results section). Heavy atoms C<sub>5</sub>:O5\u2019 and A<sub>112</sub>:O3\u2019 were selected to determine the direction of pulling and have the restraints applied to (starting distance between the two selected atoms, target end distance, time interval and spring constant) that simulated pulling at a constant speed (in one simulation) with a spring constant of 6.0 kcal/mol\u00c5. Pulling simulations at 1 \u00c5/ps, 0.5 \u00c5/ps, 0.1 \u00c5/ps and 0.05 \u00c5/ps yielding distinctly different results, as discussed in the Results section. Other PME protocol parameters were the same as in the unrestrained MD (see above)."

The much smaller size of the simulated system also permitted the use of the fast Amber PMEMD module. The GB-based SMD simulations were performed with constant pulling speeds of 0.01 \u00c5/ps and 0.005 \u00c5/ps, with three variants of intrinsic Born radii parameters: GB (mbondi, igb\u00a0=\u00a01), GB-HCT (mbondi, offset\u00a0=\u00a00.13 \u00c5, igb\u00a0=\u00a01) (<a href=\"#bib14\">Gaillard and Case, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Hawkins et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Tsui and Case, 2000a</a>) and the latest GB-neck2 (mbondi3, igb\u00a0=\u00a08) (<a href=\"#bib30\">Nguyen et al., 2015</a>). The Langevin thermostat was employed with a collision frequency of 1.0 ps<sup>\u22121</sup> and no cutoff. Simulations were run at 300 K, with a two fs time step, SHAKE, and a Debye-H\u00fcckel salt screening concentration of 1.0. No explicit ions were used. The equilibration protocol used for all the GB runs started with energy minimization, followed by heating to 300 K with harmonic restraints of 15 kcal/mol/\u00c5<sup>2</sup> applied to the RNA and six MD stages with harmonic restraints gradually lowered to 0.1 kcal/mol/\u00c5<sup>2</sup> for the total equilibration time of 2.0 ns. SMD runs that followed the equilibration phase extended TSS108 up to 700 \u00c5 in 63.4 and 126.8 ns, depending on the simulated pulling speed. In addition to the SMD runs, the overall stability of the TSS108 model was verified in implicit solvent unrestrained MD simulations with all GB parameter variants at time scales equal to and longer than those employed in SMD."

Heavy atoms C5:O5\u2019 and A112:O3\u2019 were selected to determine the direction of pulling (along the top of the TSS \u2018T\u2019) and the distance restraint parameters were applied to them."

Thus, we first assessed the impact of several SMD pulling speeds on the predicted unfolding sequence of events and ran the pulling simulations at the slowest speeds practicable with the explicit, then implicit solvent approaches (see Materials and Methods). The most important finding was that pulling speed influences the orientation of helical regions relative to the direction of pulling, most importantly that of H4b, which, in turn, leads to formation of transient tertiary interactions that change the resistance to pulling and alter the sequence of opening of the key domains in the TSS model. Chen at al. previously observed that the parallel orientation of the helices of a pseudoknot to the direction of pulling (i.e. perpendicular orientation of their base pairs) increases the resistance because a shear force is applied to stems, rather than the unzipping force that opens base pairs one at a time (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chen et al., 2007</a>). Our results are consistent with theirs, but additionally indicate that the speed of pulling influences transient orientations of structural elements."

The backbone of the single-stranded (opened) portion of the molecule was overstretched, with the straight-line P-to-P atom distances up to 33% above those found in a relaxed A-form helix. An additional 1.0 ns MD simulation was conducted with the ends held 700 \u00c5 apart to let the remaining base pairs open and the forces measured at the end to relax to zero. This was a clear indication that a pulling simulation at this speed keeps the TCV RNA away from (ahead of) its equilibrium state. At 0.5 \u00c5/ps pulling speed, the simulation ended with less base paired structure, and only at 0.1 \u00c5/ps pulling speed were all TSS base pairs open at the end of the simulation."

At the highest pulling speed, the H5 helix pivoted toward the horizontal (the direction of pulling), formed tertiary interactions with upstream nucleotides and acted like a pseudoknot, additionally increasing resistance to pulling. At all pulling speeds, after the opening of \u03a8<sub>2</sub>, H4b remained horizontally oriented and formed new transient tertiary interactions between the adenylates in the H4b terminal loop and the uridylates in the single-stranded linker between H4b and H5. These interactions formed a transient H-type pseudoknot and also increased the resistance to pulling. Such transient tertiary interactions that replaced the original pseudoknots or added new ones influenced the order of TSS unfolding, with H4a/\u03a8<sub>3</sub> opening first, in disagreement with the experimental OT results. Of the seven simulations run at 0.1 \u00c5/ps (two with higher NaCl salt concentrations that did not change the results) only one run yielded a sequence of unfolding events ending with H4a/\u03a8<sub>3</sub> opening last. These simulations clearly showed dependence of the sequence of unfolding events on pulling speed and pointed to the need for longer SMD runs simulating slower pulling speed. The longest practical explicit solvent simulation times with the pulling speed of 0.05 \u00c5/ps did not improve the results."

Following this event, the SMD was run for one ns with the TCV TSS ends held at a constant distance (~215 \u00c5) to re-equilibrate the system. During this time, the H4b terminal loop adenylates maintained H-bond contacts with the H4b-H5 linker uridylates, but changed their horizontal orientation to point further away (closer to the perpendicular) from the direction of pulling. After the pause in pulling, the SMD at 0.05 \u00c5/ps was resumed until the full extension of 700 \u00c5 was reached. Even though the re-equilibration pause did not lead to immediate full separation of the H4b from the rest of the structure and did not prevent the transient alternative tertiary interaction from forming, the global sequence of structure opening events changed to H4b opening first, H5 opening second and H4a opening last. This was in general agreement with the experimental OT data."

In order to perform slower pulling speed simulations (i.e. longer SMD runs) in reasonable real time, we employed the implicit solvent simulations (Generalized Born model implemented in Amber). These confirmed the crucial role of the pulling speed in bringing the simulation and experimental results into agreement, and they are described in detail in the text of this study."

                    "text": "The manuscript by Le et al., describes an RNA element located in the 3'UTR of turnip crinkle virus that undergoes a conformational switch resulting in a switch from translation to replication. Previous studies have shown that the TSS structure functions as a unit. That its structure is not altered by binding to ribosomes however, it was significantly altered upon RdRp binding. The authors used optical tweezers to understand how this structure folds and unfolds in order to understand how the conformational change is triggered. This work adds to our understanding of the structure of the TSS beyond what has already been published since it includes sequences adjacent that have been shown to be important ribosome binding and stability of the structure. Here the authors show that stem-loop H4A and pseudoknot (PK) 3 form a stable structure that drives cooperative folding of the rest of the TSS structure. Formation of this structure is dependent on 5 upstream adenosines, which can function as a type of molecular switch by either stabilizing the TSS or upon RDRP binding destabilize it. This manuscript provides convincing data for order of folding and unfolding of the TSS using several different approaches. However, this becomes a bit tedious and redundant. The authors also include supporting data on gRNA TCV transcript levels accumulated with mutations in the 5A region and K<sub>d</sub> measurements of TSS mutants with RDRP that supports their conclusion for how these structures are important for the translation/replication switch. Overall, this is a very nice study that adds to our understanding of the mechanisms for how the TSS structure serves as a molecular switch between translation and replication of the viral RNA. While the detailed study sheds light on the behavior of the TSS, however, more general insights into the folding properties of structured RNAs also come out of this work. This manuscript is generally interesting and would be a good addition to the papers published in <i>eLife</i>."
