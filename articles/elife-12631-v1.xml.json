Toc75 is a member of the Omp85 family of bacterial and organellar membrane insertases, characterized by N-terminal POTRA (polypeptide-transport associated) domains and C-terminal membrane-integrated \u03b2-barrels. We demonstrate that the Toc75 POTRA domains are essential for protein import and contribute to interactions with TOC receptors, thereby coupling preprotein recognition at the chloroplast surface with membrane translocation. The POTRA domains also interact with preproteins and mediate the recruitment of molecular chaperones in the intermembrane space to facilitate membrane transport. Our studies are consistent with the multi-functional roles of POTRA domains observed in other Omp85 family members and demonstrate that the domains of Toc75 have evolved unique properties specific to the acquisition of protein import during endosymbiotic evolution of the TOC system in plastids."

Toc75 is a member of the Omp85 family of bacterial and organellar membrane insertases, characterized by N-terminal POTRA (polypeptide-transport associated) domains and C-terminal membrane-integrated \u03b2-barrels. We demonstrate that the Toc75 POTRA domains are essential for protein import and contribute to interactions with TOC receptors, thereby coupling preprotein recognition at the chloroplast surface with membrane translocation. The POTRA domains also interact with preproteins and mediate the recruitment of molecular chaperones in the intermembrane space to facilitate membrane transport. Our studies are consistent with the multi-functional roles of POTRA domains observed in other Omp85 family members and demonstrate that the domains of Toc75 have evolved unique properties specific to the acquisition of protein import during endosymbiotic evolution of the TOC system in plastids."

First, this part of the transporter interacts with the other components of the import system that make the transporter more selective and control which direction the proteins are transported. Second, the domains interact with proteins during transport to help move them across the chloroplast membrane. Finally, the domains recruit other molecules called chaperones, which stop the protein from aggregating or misfolding during the transport process.

Structural and electrophysiological studies of Toc75 demonstrate that the protein forms a cation-selective channel with a pore size sufficient to transport unfolded polypeptide substrates (<a href=\"#bib27\">Hinnah et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">2002</a>). In vitro pull-down experiments with recombinant POTRA domains of Toc75 suggest that they can interact with the TOC GTPases and chloroplast preproteins (<a href=\"#bib19\">Ertel et al., 2005</a>). This has led to the proposal that they function in TOC complex assembly, interactions with the TOC GTPases, preprotein recognition, or to provide a chaperone-like activity for the preprotein during membrane translocation (<a href=\"#bib68\">S\u00e1nchez-Pulido et al., 2003</a>, <a href=\"#bib19\">Ertel et al., 2005</a>). In this study, we combine molecular genetic and biochemical analyses to examine the roles of the POTRA domains in protein import and membrane targeting in chloroplasts. We demonstrate that POTRA domains contribute essential functions to the Toc75 channel. Furthermore, expression of Toc75 lacking one or more of the three POTRA repeats leads to dominant negative phenotypes in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>. Expression of specific deletion mutants alters the size and distribution of the TOC complexes and disrupts preprotein import into the organelle. Biochemical analyses indicate that the Toc75 POTRAs interact specifically with chloroplast preproteins and two proposed chaperones of the intermembrane space, Tic22-III and Tic22-IV. Our results demonstrate multiple roles for the POTRAs in protein import, including TOC complex assembly, preprotein translocation and the recruitment of chaperones to facilitate transport across the intermembrane space."

The <i>TOC75-III</i> genomic fragment retains both the native promoter and introns and was previously shown to complement <i>toc75-III-1</i> (<a href=\"#bib77\">Shipman-Roston et al., 2010</a>). Heterozygous <i>toc75-III-1</i> plants were transformed with a wild-type TOC75 gene construct (<i>TOC75), TOC75\u0394P1, TOC75\u0394P1-2</i> or <i>TOC75\u0394P1-3</i>. Transformants were selected for hygromycin resistance linked to the <i>toc75-III-1</i>\u2009T-DNA insertion and for the DsRed fluorescence marker linked to the <i>TOC75</i> and POTRA-deletion constructs. The presence of <i>TOC75, TOC75\u0394P1, TOC75\u0394P1-2</i> or <i>TOC75\u0394P1-3</i> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>) and the <i>toc75-III-1</i> allele (data not shown) was confirmed by PCR of genomic DNA in T3 transformants homozygous for the DsRed marker. Plants homozygous for the <i>TOC75, TOC75\u0394P1, TOC75\u0394P1-2</i> or <i>TOC75\u0394P1-3</i> transgenes were selected in the heterozygous <i>toc75-III-1</i> (<i>toc75III-1</i>[<i>+/-</i>])\u00a0background, and the progeny of these plants were segregated to test for complementation of the lethal phenotype of <i>toc75-III-1</i> homozygous plants. At least five independent lines were selected for each construct. The segregation analysis of representative T3 lines is shown in <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>. As expected, <i>toc75-III-1</i>(<i>+/-</i>)\u00a0progeny carrying the homozygous <i>TOC75</i> wild type transgene segregated at a near 3:1 ratio of hygromycin resistant:sensitive plants, consistent with complementation of the <i>toc75-III-1</i> insertion (<a href=\"#bib5\">Baldwin et al., 2005</a>, <a href=\"#bib77\">Shipman-Roston et al., 2010</a>) (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1A</a>).

Although most plants transformed with the Toc75 POTRA-deletion constructs (e.g. <i>TOC75\u0394P1#1, TOC75\u0394P1-2#1</i> or TOC75\u0394P1-3#1; <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1B</a>) were phenotypically indistinguishable from <i>toc75-III-1</i> plants (data not shown), several transformed lines (<i>TOC75\u0394P1#2, TOC75\u0394P1-2#2</i> or <i>TOC75\u0394P1-3#2</i>) showed progressively increased pale phenotypes and reduced growth rates (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). The chlorophyll levels in <i>TOC75\u0394P1#2 and TOC75\u0394P1-2#2</i> plants were reduced by 26% and 62%, respectively (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). <i>TOC75\u0394P1-3#2</i> plants were nearly albino and exhibited severe growth defects (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>).

These data suggest that expression of Toc75\u0394P1, Toc75\u0394P1-2 or Toc75\u0394P1-3 proteins in these lines competed with the normal function of native Toc75, expressed from the single wild-type allele in the <i>toc75-III-1</i>(<i>+</i>/-background, resulting in disruption of the import apparatus and a consequent impact on plant growth and viability."

To further examine the nature of the aberrant segregation, we focused on <i>TOC75\u0394P1#2, TOC75\u0394P1-2#2</i> lines. We were unable to pursue further characterization of <i>TOC75\u0394P1-3</i> because of the severe phenotype in lines expressing this construct (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). We compared the expression levels of Toc75\u0394P1 or Toc75\u0394P1-2 in lines showing normal 2:1 hygromycin resistance segregation (<i>TOC75\u0394P1#1 and TOC75\u0394P1-2#1</i>) and those showing aberrant segregation (<i>TOC75\u0394P1#2 and TOC75\u0394P1-2#2</i>) (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1B and C</a>). <i>TOC75\u0394P1#1</i> and <i>TOC75\u0394P1-2#1</i> plants were nearly indistinguishable from heterozygous <i>toc75-III-1</i> plants, whereas <i>TOC75\u0394P1#2</i> and <i>TOC75\u0394P1-2#2</i> plants showed a lower germination rate and significant growth defects when grown on agar plates (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Real-time reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>) and immunoblotting of extracts (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>) from seedlings of these lines indicated that the expression of the Toc75 POTRA deletion was higher in <i>TOC75\u0394P1#2</i> and <i>TOC75\u0394P1-2#2</i> plants compared to <i>TOC75\u0394P1#1</i> and <i>TOC75\u0394P1-2#1.</i> The examination of additional transformants confirmed that the severity of defects in growth (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1 \u2013 supplement 1</a>) and germination (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2 - supplement 1A and B</a>) correlated with the levels of Toc75\u0394P1 or Toc75\u0394P1-2 accumulation (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2 \u2013 supplement 1C</a>). Although we did not examine the reasons for the differences in expression between the lines, the location of transgene insertion in the Arabidopsis genome could account for the variation (<a href=\"#bib23\">Gelvin and Kim, 2007</a>). These data indicate that increased expression of the POTRA deletions induces significant phenotypic defects, consistent with a dominant-negative effect on native Toc75 function in the <i>toc75-III-1</i>(<i>+</i>/-) background. Consistent with this observation, the levels of Toc75\u0394P1 or Toc75\u0394P1-2 mRNA in <i>TOC75\u0394P1#2</i> or <i>TOC75\u0394P1-2#2</i> plants were 3.5\u20134.5 times higher than those of native Toc75 mRNA, whereas the Toc75\u0394P1 or Toc75\u0394P1-2 protein levels were significantly lower than native Toc75. This suggests that expression of <i>TOC75\u0394P1#2</i> and <i>TOC75\u0394P1-2#2</i> is tightly controlled post-transcriptionally or by proteolytic degradation of Toc75\u0394P1 or Toc75\u0394P1-2, most likely in response to the negative impact of the POTRA deletions on chloroplast function."

To test how deletion of the POTRA domains might impact preprotein translocation at the outer membrane, we measured time-dependent import kinetics in chloroplasts isolated from <i>toc75-III-1</i> (<i>+</i>/-), <i>TOC75, TOC75\u0394P1#2 and TOC75\u0394P1-2#2</i> plants.\u00a0Isolated chloroplasts were incubated with [<sup>35</sup>S]-labeled chloroplast preprotein, preSSU, in the presence of 3\u2009mM ATP to promote import for 2, 5 or 10\u2009min at 26\u00b0 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Quantitative analysis indicates that preprotein import rates in chloroplasts from <i>toc75-III-1</i> (+/-)\u00a0and <i>TOC75</i> plants were statistically indistinguishable (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>), consistent with the normal phenotype of these plants. By contrast, the levels of [<sup>35</sup>S]preSSU import into chloroplasts expressing Toc75\u0394P1, and Toc75\u0394P1-2 were reduced to ~35% of the levels observed in chloroplasts from <i>toc75-III-1</i> (+/-)\u00a0and <i>TOC75</i> plants (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). A similar reduction in import was observed for an additional preprotein, the precursor of the E1\u03b1 subunit of pyruvate dehydrogenase ([<sup>35</sup>S]preE1\u03b1) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). PreE1\u03b1 utilizes an import pathway involving Toc75 and a set of TOC receptor GTPase isoforms distinct from those involved in preSSU import (<a href=\"#bib39\">Ivanova et al., 2004</a>). These data demonstrate that Toc75\u0394P1 and Toc75\u0394P1-2 disrupt the function of protein import complexes involved in multiple import pathways, resulting in the defects in chloroplast biogenesis observed in <i>TOC75\u0394P1#2 and TOC75\u0394P1-2#2</i> plants."

In the absence of ATP, preproteins bind to chloroplasts in a low-affinity, energy-independent interaction involving the Toc159 and Toc33 GTPase receptors (<a href=\"#bib3\">Aronsson and Jarvis, 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib34\">Inaba and Schnell, 2008</a>). In the presence of 0.1\u2009mM ATP, preproteins are promoted to a higher affinity intermediate, which is inserted across the outer membrane and represents the initial translocation of preprotein across the envelope (<a href=\"#bib20\">Fitzpatrick and Keegstra, 2001</a>, <a href=\"#bib34\">Inaba and Schnell, 2008</a>). The distinction between energy-independent binding and the formation of the higher affinity intermediate is apparent by an increase in the levels of preprotein that stably associates with chloroplasts (<a href=\"#bib63\">Olsen and Keegstra, 1992</a>). As expected <i>TOC75 and toc75-III-1</i>(+/-)\u00a0chloroplasts showed 53% and 97% increases in chloroplast-associated preprotein, respectively, in the presence of 0.1\u2009mM ATP compared to chloroplasts depleted of ATP (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A and B</a>).

Incubation of the chloroplasts from the 0.1\u2009mM ATP-binding experiment with 3\u2009mM ATP to promote import of the intermediate into the stroma resulted in translocation and processing of 70\u201385% of bound [<sup>35</sup>S]preSSU in the <i>TOC75 and toc75-III-1(+/-)</i> control\u00a0chloroplasts and <i>TOC75\u0394P1#2</i>, and <i>TOC75\u0394P1-2#2</i> chloroplasts (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A and C</a>).

To test this hypothesis, we investigated the kinetic parameters of import in <i>TOC75\u0394P1#2</i> and <i>TOC75\u0394P1-2#2</i> chloroplasts to determine the affinity and maximum translocation capacity of TOC translocons for preSSU. We generated a preprotein binding curve with increasing concentrations of purified <i>E. coli</i>-expressed preSSU-FLAG-HIS in the presence of 0.1\u2009mM ATP and visualized bound preprotein by immunoblotting with anti-FLAG (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). The apparent dissociation constants (K<sub>d(app)</sub>) of preSSU-FLAG-HIS for TOC translocons in <i>TOC75</i> and <i>TOC75\u0394P1#2</i> and <i>TOC75\u0394P1-2#2</i> chloroplasts were 158.6 \u00b1 29 nM, 187.7 \u00b1 46 nM and 126.5 \u00b1 24\u2009mM, respectively (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). This indicates that there were no measurable differences in the affinity of TOC translocons for preprotein in these plants. However, the maximum binding capacity was estimated as 91.4 \u00b1 6.2, 57.1 \u00b1 5.6 and 48.2 \u00b1 3.3 fmol preSSU/\u03bcg chloroplast protein in <i>TOC75</i> and <i>TOC75\u0394P1#2</i> and <i>TOC75\u0394P1-2#2</i> chloroplasts, respectively (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>).

These data are consistent with the hypothesis that deletion of the POTRA domains reduces the number of active TOC complexes at the outer envelope by interfering with their ability to mediate outer membrane translocation."

As shown in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a> i, Toc33, Toc75 and Toc159 from <i>TOC75</i> chloroplasts co-migrated in complexes, which peaked at ~1.3 MDa (region a). A second complex, with a peak at ~440\u2009kDa (region b) migrated between 400 and 880\u2009kDa and contained Toc75 and Toc33, but lacked detectable levels of Toc159. The presence of the ~1.3 MDa and ~440\u2009kDa complexes is consistent with the 800\u20131000\u2009kDa and 300\u2013450\u2009kDa TOC complexes previously reported from pea chloroplasts (<a href=\"#bib46\">Kikuchi et al., 2006</a>) on 2D blue-native gels. The minor differences in the mobilities of the TOC complexes reported here and in the previous study are likely due to differences in the sizes of TOC components in Arabidopsis versus pea chloroplasts. Both 1.3 MDa and 440\u2009kDa complexes containing native Toc75, Toc33 and Toc159 were also observed in <i>TOC75\u0394P1</i>#2 and <i>TOC75\u0394P1-2</i>#2 plants (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>).

By contrast, Toc75\u0394P1-2 was absent from the 1.3 MDa complexes and present only in complexes with a mobility similar or smaller than the 440\u2009kDa complexes in <i>TOC75\u0394P1-2</i>#2 plants (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a> iii). In conjunction with the observation that Toc75\u0394P1-2 co-immunoprecipitates with Toc33 (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>), the results from 2D blue-native gels suggest that Toc75\u0394P1-2 is able to interact with Toc33 but is unable to assemble into the 1.3 MDa complexes containing all three core TOC components."

Previous work had demonstrated a potential interaction between the N-terminal POTRA domains of an Omp85 family member in the outer membrane of the cyanobacteria, <i>Anabeana sp.

These observations led us to examine a possible physical interaction between Toc75 and Tic22 in the chloroplast intermembrane space. A protein fragment encompassing all three Toc75 POTRA domains and a C-terminal hexahistidine tag (POTRA-His) was expressed and purified from <i>E. coli</i> and tested for binding to Tic22-III and Tic22-IV. The recombinant POTRA-His was immobilized on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) matrix and incubated with in vitro\u2013translated [<sup>35</sup>S]Tic22-III and [<sup>35</sup>S]Tic22-IV.

Expression (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>) and 2D blue-native PAGE (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>) analyses revealed significant changes in the levels and assembly of the core TOC components, which likely results in a population of defective or non-functional translocons.

However, Toc75\u0394P1-2 was only detected in novel complexes that migrated between 200\u2013880\u2009kDa. A major fraction of Toc33, but not native Toc75 or Toc159, exhibited a coincident broad range of distribution with Toc75\u0394P1-2 (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>). Together with the observation that Toc75\u0394P1-2 co-immunoprecipitated with Toc33, this suggests that Toc75\u0394P1-2 is able to associate normally with Toc33, but not Toc159, evidenced by the lack of Toc159 in the 200\u2013880\u2009kDa complexes in <i>TOC75\u0394P1-2</i> chloroplasts. This implicates POTRA-2 alone, or in combination with POTRA-1, in interactions between Toc75 and Toc159, which is a requirement for proper TOC complex assembly and function."

Despite the conservation of functional domains, Toc75 appears to be unique amongst Omp85 family members because it evolved to mediate protein import into plastids from the cytoplasm. The reversal of the transport activity relative to the bacterial and mitochondrial Omp85 family members occurred with the diversification of Toc75 from the cyanobacterial Omp85 ancestor and was driven by the association of Toc75 with the Toc33 and Toc159 receptors. Toc33 and Toc159 provide the GTP-dependent driving force for the unidirectional transport of preproteins from the cytoplasm into the organelle. The Toc33-Toc75-Toc159 core is a universal feature of the plant lineage, and the adaptation of POTRAs to facilitate these interactions was, therefore, a key event in the evolution of TOC complexes."

As is the case in other Omp85 family members, each domain is likely to contribute individual activities, but also work in association with the other domains to mediate assembly of the translocon complex and coordinate preprotein translocation. In contrast to bacterial and mitochondrial outer membranes, chloroplasts contain two Omp85 family members: Toc75 and OEP80 (Outer Envelope Protein 80) (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hsu and Inoue, 2009</a>). Similar to Toc75, OEP80 is essential in Arabidopsis (<a href=\"#bib66\">Patel et al., 2008</a>) and is predicted to contain three N-terminal soluble POTRA domains and a C-terminal \u03b2-barrel (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hsu and Inoue, 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib30\">Hsu et al., 2012</a>).

Although phylogenetic analyses indicated that Toc75 and OEP80 are more closely related to each other than either is to other bacterial Omp85 family members, distinct sequence signatures have been identified in both the POTRA and \u03b2-barrel domains of the chloroplast proteins to account for evolutionary divergence of these two \u03b2-barrel channels (<a href=\"#bib16\">Day et al., 2014</a>). The evolution of an import apparatus to mediate the transport of nucleus-encoded preproteins into plastids was an essential element of endosymbiosis. Our data are consistent with the divergent evolution of Toc75 and OEP80 from the ancestral cyanobacterial <i>OMP85</i> gene to retain the pathway for \u03b2-barrel protein biogenesis, while providing a novel pathway for protein import into the organelle."

Proteins of this family contain a \u03b2-barrel membrane-embedded domain in their C-terminal part and one to five POTRA domains in the N-terminal region. However, little is known about the functions of the <i>TOC75</i> POTRA domains and there is also uncertainty about the orientation of these domains in the outer membrane. The manuscript describes a first attempt at a comprehensive analysis of the <i>TOC75</i> POTRA domains and also addresses the membrane orientation. The authors analyzed the outcome of deleting one, two, or all three POTRA domains of Toc75. In addition they characterized the import behavior of organelles coexpressing one of the deletion variants together with a native form. They also analyzed the assembly of the TOC complex in such chloroplasts. An interesting side aspect of this report is the Toc75 topology analysis, which is in agreement with the bacterial and mitochondrial Omp85 homologs. This is important since a previous controversial study (Sommer et al., 2011) proposed just the opposite orientation for chloroplasts. Finally, the authors show that a recombinant polypeptide corresponding to the three POTRA domains can interact with precursor protein and with Tic22. In general, the data presented in the manuscript is technically sound and represents the first characterization of the Toc75 POTRA domains for protein import into chloroplasts. The elucidation of <i>TOC75</i> POTRA function will represent a significant step forward in the field, and so this manuscript is potentially of considerable interest."
