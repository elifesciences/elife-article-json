To adjust the X gene dosage between genders, female mouse preimplantation embryos undergo an imprinted form of X chromosome inactivation (iXCI) that requires both <i>Rlim</i> (also known as Rnf12) and the long non-coding RNA <i>Xist</i>. Moreover, it is thought that gene expression from the single active X is upregulated to correct for bi-allelic autosomal (A) gene expression. We have combined mouse genetics with RNA-seq on single mouse embryos to investigate functions of <i>Rlim</i> on the temporal regulation of iXCI and <i>Xist</i>. Our results reveal crucial roles of <i>Rlim</i> for the maintenance of high <i>Xist</i> RNA levels, <i>Xist</i> clouds and X-silencing in female embryos at blastocyst stages, while initial <i>Xist</i> expression appears <i>Rlim</i>-independent. We find further that X/A upregulation is initiated in early male and female preimplantation embryos."

To adjust the X gene dosage between genders, female mouse preimplantation embryos undergo an imprinted form of X chromosome inactivation (iXCI) that requires both <i>Rlim</i> (also known as Rnf12) and the long non-coding RNA <i>Xist</i>. Moreover, it is thought that gene expression from the single active X is upregulated to correct for bi-allelic autosomal (A) gene expression. We have combined mouse genetics with RNA-seq on single mouse embryos to investigate functions of <i>Rlim</i> on the temporal regulation of iXCI and <i>Xist</i>. Our results reveal crucial roles of <i>Rlim</i> for the maintenance of high <i>Xist</i> RNA levels, <i>Xist</i> clouds and X-silencing in female embryos at blastocyst stages, while initial <i>Xist</i> expression appears <i>Rlim</i>-independent. We find further that X/A upregulation is initiated in early male and female preimplantation embryos."

In contrast, epiblast cells in the inner cell mass (ICM) of blastocysts that will give rise to the embryo reactivate the Xp and undergo a random form of XCI (rXCI) around implantation (E5-E5.5) (<a href=\"#bib15\">Disteche, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Payer and Lee, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Galupa and Heard, 2015</a>). During XCI the long non-coding RNA <i>Xist</i> progressively paints the X chromosome from which it is synthesized, thereby triggering repressive histone modifications including H3K27me3 (<a href=\"#bib44\">Plath et al., 2003</a>) and transcriptional silencing of X-linked genes (<a href=\"#bib15\">Disteche, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Payer and Lee, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Galupa and Heard, 2015</a>). <i>Xist</i> is required both for iXCI and rXCI (<a href=\"#bib31\">Marahrens et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Penny et al., 1996</a>). The X-linked gene <i>Rlim</i> encodes a ubiquitin ligase (<a href=\"#bib38\">Ostendorff et al., 2002</a>) that shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm (<a href=\"#bib23\">Jiao et al., 2013</a>) and modulates transcription via regulating nuclear multiprotein complexes (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bach et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">G\u00fcng\u00f6r et al., 2007</a>). <i>Rlim</i> promotes the formation of <i>Xist</i> clouds both during iXCI in female mice (<a href=\"#bib53\">Shin et al., 2010</a>) and in female embryonic stem cells (ESCs) undergoing rXCI in culture (<a href=\"#bib57\">van Bemmel et al., 2016</a>). In mice, however, <i>Rlim</i> is dispensable for rXCI in epiblast cells (<a href=\"#bib54\">Shin et al., 2014</a>). While both <i>Rlim</i> and <i>Xist</i> play essential roles during iXCI in mice (<a href=\"#bib31\">Marahrens et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Shin et al., 2010</a>), questions remain with regards to their functions on the general kinetics of X-linked gene expression, their functional interconnection and the contribution of maternally vs embryonically expressed RLIM for iXCI. Moreover, while evidence for X/A upregulation was observed not only in adult mouse tissues but also in mouse ES cells and epiblast cells at blastocyst stages (<a href=\"#bib13\">Deng et al., 2013</a>, <a href=\"#bib14\">2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib29\">2007</a>), details on the developmental X upregulation are lacking."

                                "text": "Several studies have investigated the dynamics of XCI and X-silencing in female ES cells (<a href=\"#bib29\">Lin et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Marks et al., 2015</a>) or trophoblasts (<a href=\"#bib8\">Calabrese et al., 2012</a>) using RNA-seq. To assess the general dynamics of X-linked gene expression and iXCI in vivo, we have adapted single cell RNA-seq technology (<a href=\"#bib51\">Shalek et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Jaitin et al., 2014</a>) to elucidate the pre- and peri-implantation transcriptome using single mouse embryos (<a href=\"#bib52\">Sharma et al., 2016</a>). This is a valid strategy because (1) early embryos consist of a limited number of cell types: essentially one totipotent cell type up to E3, and three cell types at blastocyst stages - epiblast, trophoblast and primitive endoderm cells - that express known marker genes (2) cells of preimplantation embryos undergo iXCI that exclusively silences the Xp and (3) in mice there is only a relatively small number of genes that escape XCI (<a href=\"#bib59\">Yang et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Finn et al., 2014</a>). Thus, using RNA-seq we examined embryos at the 4- and 8-cell stages, early and late morula (E2.5 and E3.0), and blastocyst stages (E3.5, E4.0 and E4.5), comparing global changes in gene expression. We also included trophoblasts isolated from blastocyst outgrowths of cultured E4.0 embryos in our analyses. In contrast to previous studies on single cells of preimplantation embryos that were performed in a mixed genetic background (<a href=\"#bib12\">Deng et al., 2014</a>), embryos were generated in a C57BL/6 background to exclude potential background influences on the general kinetics of iXCI and/or X upregulation. Moreover, because the known functions of <i>Rlim</i> during mouse embryogenesis are restricted to XCI in females (<a href=\"#bib53\">Shin et al., 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib54\">2014</a>), RNA-seq experiments were performed on WT and <i>Rlim</i>KO embryos. Based on a mouse model allowing a conditional KO (cKO) of the <i>Rlim</i> gene, we have previously generated females carrying a maternally transmitted <i>Sox2</i>-Cre-mediated cKO allele and a paternally transmitted germline KO allele (<i>Rlim<sup>cKOm/\u0394p-SC</sup></i>). These females appear healthy, fertile and lack RLIM in all somatic tissues as well as their germline (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib54\">Shin et al., 2014</a>). Thus, to efficiently generate male and female germline <i>Rlim</i> KO embryos (<i>\u0394/Y</i>, <i>\u0394/\u0394</i>) and to eliminate potential influences of maternal RLIM in oocytes on the iXCI process, all <i>Rlim</i> KO embryos were generated by crossing <i>Rlim<sup>cKOm/\u0394p-SC</sup></i> females with germline KO males (<i>Rlim<sup>\u0394/Y</sup></i>) (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). RNA was prepared and barcoded RNA-seq libraries were constructed from 187 samples that were distributed between two 96-well plates, each with similar numbers of embryos from each stage and mating. Libraries were pooled and sequenced to an average read depth of 2.95 million reads. This read depth lies within the range typically obtained by using single-cell technology (<a href=\"#bib51\">Shalek et al., 2013</a>). The gender of each embryo was determined by assessing expression of Y-linked genes, which occurs only in male embryos, and <i>Xist</i>, which is expressed only in females (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a>). 12 samples for which gender could not be assigned or displayed less than 280,000 total reads were removed, leaving 175 samples for further analysis (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>; <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). Mapping reads from WT and KO embryos to the <i>Rlim</i> locus showed that the deleted region in KO embryos was not represented (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>; data not shown), validating both the mating strategy and the specificity of the data obtained via whole embryo RNA-seq. Because of expected differences in expression of X-linked genes during preimplantation development between genders and between females WT and KO for <i>Rlim</i>, each library was normalized to its total autosomal gene expression rather than expression of all genes on chromosomes. As expected, comparing Log2-transformed data of 10552 annotated genes that are expressed at all examined developmental stages revealed no significant differences in gene expression at the chromosome level between Rlim<sup>\u0394/Y</sup> and WT/Y males (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>), consistent with the finding that male mice lacking <i>Rlim</i> develop normally (<a href=\"#bib53\">Shin et al., 2010</a>). Analyses of WT embryos (pooled male and female embryos for each stage), showed that the developmental transcript profiles matched well with expression of epiblast markers <i>Pou5f1</i> (Oct4) (<a href=\"#bib49\">Rosner et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Sch\u00f6ler et al., 1990</a>) and <i>Nanog</i> (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chambers et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Mitsui et al., 2003</a>) and trophoblast marker <i>Krt8</i> (Troma1) (<a href=\"#bib6\">Br\u00fblet and Jacob, 1982</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). The observed variations between replicates were well within margins previously observed for single cell RNA-seq technology (<a href=\"#bib21\">Jaitin et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Shalek et al., 2013</a>), and comparison of expression levels of these cell markers between <i>Rlim<sup>\u0394/\u0394</sup></i> and WT/WT females suggested that the general cell type specification events that occur at blastocyst stages were similar in embryos of both genotypes (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). Because <i>Rlim</i> is X-linked and its functions appear restricted to females (<a href=\"#bib53\">Shin et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Jiao et al., 2012</a>), expression of this gene was evaluated in female WT/WT embryos only. <i>Rlim</i> RNA levels decreased from the 4-cell to the 8-cell stage, possibly due to depletion of maternal pools, then gradually increased up to E3.5, and decreased thereafter (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). High relative levels of <i>Rlim</i> were detected in trophoblasts, suggesting that the cells of the ICM are mostly responsible for the diminished <i>Rlim</i> levels in E4.5 embryos, consistent with a drop in RLIM protein levels specifically in epiblast cells (<a href=\"#bib54\">Shin et al., 2014</a>). Random subsampling of libraries to 200,000 reads per embryo (<a href=\"#bib45\">Robinson and Storey, 2014</a>) showed similar results (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>), indicating that the sequencing depth was not a limiting factor in our data analyses."

                                "text": "<i>Xist</i> RNA levels were very low in males at all stages (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), as expected. Much higher levels of <i>Xist</i> were measured in females, although variations among replicates at each stage were high relative to those obtained for <i>Pou5f1 (Oct4)</i>, <i>Nanog</i> and <i>Krt8</i>, likely reflecting biological variations in individual animals in addition to the technical variability of single-embryo RNA-seq (compare <a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1F</a> and <a href=\"#fig2\">2A</a>). Because the <i>Xist</i> gene is located within the <i>Tsix</i> gene, which is transcribed in the antisense orientation (<a href=\"#bib27\">Lee and Lu, 1999</a>), we examined the locations of reads mapping to this locus. We detected a high read density located precisely within the <i>Xist</i> transcription unit (&gt;90% of reads) and very few reads in introns or exons specific to <i>Tsix</i> (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), indicating that the detected reads mostly correspond to <i>Xist</i> RNA. <i>Xist</i> levels in WT female embryos increased dramatically from the 4-cell to the 8-cell stages and peaked around E3.5 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Consistent with the detection of <i>Xist</i> transcription foci in early <i>Rlim</i> KO female embryos (<a href=\"#bib53\">Shin et al., 2010</a>), the developmental onset of <i>Xist</i> was similar in <i>Rlim<sup>\u0394/\u0394</sup></i> females, but significantly lower levels of <i>Xist</i> were measured only after E3.5 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Random subsampling of libraries to 200,000 reads per embryo (<a href=\"#bib45\">Robinson and Storey, 2014</a>) showed a similar <i>Xist</i> expression profile (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Moreover, strand-specific RT-qPCR confirmed that <i>Rlim<sup>\u0394/\u0394</sup></i> females expressed similar levels of <i>Xist</i> when compared to WT/WT at E2.5, but much lower levels at E3.5 and thereafter (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). These results prompted us to examine <i>Xist</i> clouds in females at E2.5 morula and E3.5 blastocyst stages, comparing <i>Rlim<sup>\u0394/\u0394</sup></i> with WT/WT embryos. This was done via RNA FISH, co-staining with probes against <i>Rlim,</i> which recognizes both the WT and KO transcripts (<a href=\"#bib53\">Shin et al., 2010</a>), and <i>Xist</i>. As expected, <i>Xist</i> clouds were detected in WT embryos of both embryonic stages (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B\u2013D</a>). In these female embryos most/all cells exhibited clouds except those undergoing mitosis. <i>Xist</i> clouds were also detected in a significant number of <i>Rlim</i> KO embryos at both developmental stages. In contrast to WT/WT, however, in <i>Xist</i> cloud-positive <i>Rlim<sup>\u0394/\u0394</sup></i> embryos at E2.5, the number of cells displaying clouds was highly variable, ranging between 1 cell to most cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,D</a>). As few cells of 8-cell staged female embryos lacking RLIM display <i>Xist</i> clouds (<a href=\"#bib53\">Shin et al., 2010</a>), these results indicate that <i>Rlim<sup>\u0394/\u0394</sup></i> females develop <i>Xist</i> clouds at morula stages, but likely with a slower kinetics when compared to WT/WT females. As expected, at E3.5 the vast majority of cells exhibited transcription foci for <i>Xist</i> and only few cells displayed <i>Xist</i> clouds in <i>Rlim<sup>\u0394/\u0394</sup></i> embryos (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,D</a>). Combined, these data reveal that <i>Rlim</i> is dispensable for initial <i>Xist</i> expression in 4-cell stage embryos but required for upregulation/maintenance of <i>Xist</i> expression after E3. They further show that <i>Xist</i> clouds transiently form in <i>Rlim<sup>\u0394/\u0394</sup></i> female morulae, which cannot be maintained at blastocyst stages."

                                "text": "To examine the function of <i>Rlim</i> on global X-silencing during iXCI we compared normalized reads (FPKM) of all annotated X-linked genes from WT/WT or <i>Rlim<sup>\u0394/\u0394</sup></i> female embryos with all male embryos generated in this dataset. In female WT/WT embryos the gene dosage was close to two-fold that of males at early developmental stages (likely due to two active X chromosomes) and then, starting at morula stages, gradually decreased to a gene dosage similar to that of males by late blastocyst stages, consistent with Xp silencing (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). These results are in agreement with recent data obtained from allele-specific RNA-seq on single cells both from early mouse preimplantation embryos with a mixed genetic background (<a href=\"#bib12\">Deng et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Chen et al., 2016</a>) and human preimplantation embryos (<a href=\"#bib43\">Petropoulos et al., 2016</a>). Consistent with the formation of transient <i>Xist</i> clouds (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>) the X gene dosage in female <i>Rlim<sup>\u0394/\u0394</sup></i> embryos was not significantly different from that of WT/WT females up to E3, revealing a partial silencing of X-linked genes at these early stages in the absence of RLIM. However, the continued further silencing of X-linked genes observed in WT/WT during blastocyst stages was significantly inhibited in <i>Rlim<sup>\u0394/\u0394</sup></i> females (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Again, random subsampling of libraries for each embryo to 200.000 reads showed similar results (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>, and data not shown), demonstrating that these libraries are sequenced to a depth sufficient to accurately measure X-silencing. Considering an estimated average half-life of around 10\u00a0hr for mRNAs in mammalian cells (<a href=\"#bib58\">Yang et al., 2003</a>) including mouse preimplantation embryos (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kidder and Pedersen, 1982</a>), the detection of initial X-silencing at late morula/early blastocyst stages via RNA-seq on whole embryos (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>) fits well with published data obtained by RNA FISH that show diminished transcription foci of X-linked protein-encoding genes generally starting between the 8-cell and morula stages (<a href=\"#bib40\">Patrat et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Namekawa et al., 2010</a>). Moreover, the gradual X-silencing from the 8-cell stage to E4.5 in WT/WT females as determined by whole embryo RNA-seq (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>) is consistent with the existence of long-lived mRNAs in mouse preimplantation embryos (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kidder and Pedersen, 1982</a>)."

                                "text": "We next analyzed Log<sub>2</sub>-transformed data of 10552 annotated genes that are expressed at all examined developmental stages. Comparing the developmental expression pattern between female <i>Rlim<sup>\u0394/\u0394</sup></i> and male embryos revealed very few changes in autosomal gene expression due to the <i>Rlim</i> mutation, suggesting that the main function of <i>Rlim</i> in early embryonic gene regulation is in X-silencing (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3B</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Indeed, examination of the silencing pattern of 351 annotated X-linked genes in WT females showed that gene silencing occurs within most regions on the X chromosome both during the early (8-cell to E3) and late phase (E3 to E4.5) of iXCI (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). However, expression of several genes located in a region on the XqE3/F1 border is notably higher at early preimplantation stages in females WT and KO for <i>Rlim</i> when compared to males. Interestingly, this region overlaps a 1.1 Mb region that has been involved with meiotic regulation during spermatogenesis (<a href=\"#bib60\">Zhou et al., 2013</a>). Moreover, levels of genes known to escape X-silencing during rXCI including <i>Kdm6a</i> and <i>Kdm5c</i> (<a href=\"#bib5\">Berletch et al., 2010</a>) were also not significantly down-regulated during iXCI (not shown). As we are not able to distinguish mRNAs transcribed from the Xm or Xp, we cannot exclude the contribution of developmental transcriptional regulation and/or effects of differential parental imprinting in these regions. To further examine X expression profiles in females, we compared the distributions of female E3/8-cell and E4.5/8-cell expression ratios of 755 X-linked genes that are expressed in at least 3 embryos. Results showed that there are little differences in expression profiles between E3/8-cell ratios of WT/WT and <i>Rlim<sup>\u0394/\u0394</sup></i> females (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>), whereas E4.5/8-cell ratios in <i>Rlim<sup>\u0394/\u0394</sup></i> females are generally two-fold higher when compared to WT/WT (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). To verify global Xp silencing we performed an independent RNA-seq experiment on 3 male and 3 female WT embryos with a heterozygous C57Bl/6 (B6) and castaneus/Eij (CAST) background (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>) allowing a direct comparison of data processed via F/M or by an allele-specific analysis. We chose embryos at E3.5 because at this stage about half of the X is silenced in female embryos (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>; <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). Indeed, in B6<sub>m</sub>/CAST<sub>p</sub> embryos we measured only around 50% of X-linked CAST transcripts when compared to transcripts originating from the B6 X chromosome (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>). These results provide independent confirmation that the decline in F/M values of X-linked transcripts in females (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>) is due to X<sub>p</sub>-silencing. These data corroborate our previous results and are consistent with (1) partial silencing of overall X-linked genes in female E3 embryos of both genotypes, and (2) the general silencing of one X chromosome in E4.5 WT/WT but not <i>Rlim<sup>\u0394/\u0394</sup></i> females. Thus, our combined results distinguish an early <i>Rlim</i>-independent phase of iXCI in totipotent cells up to around E3 that leads to partial Xp-silencing, and a late phase after E3 that is <i>Rlim</i>-dependent and leads to robust Xp-silencing. These data further confirm that the process of iXCI progressively adjusts the X-linked gene dosage from the 8-cell stage to E4.5 during early female development."

To confirm that embryonic RLIM plays a crucial role for iXCI after E3 we targeted the maternally transmitted conditional <i>Rlim</i> allele via a paternally transmitted <i>Rosa26</i>-Cre (R26C) transgene (<a href=\"#bib55\">Soriano, 1999</a>), from which Cre is induced after zygotic genome activation (ZGA). Indeed, an R26C-mediated deletion of the <i>Rlim</i> allele on the Xm led to embryonic lethality in a female-specific parent-of-origin effect (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>), similar to the germline <i>Rlim</i> KO (<a href=\"#bib53\">Shin et al., 2010</a>). This deletion proved highly penetrant, as a maternally transmitted floxed <i>Rlim</i> allele was no longer detectable at early stages of the second iXCI phase (E3.5; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). RNA FISH experiments showed that <i>Xist</i> cloud formation was strongly diminished in trophoblasts of female R26C-mediated cKO<sub>m</sub> blastocysts isolated at E4 and cultured ex vivo for 2 days (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Moreover, the detection of transcription foci of <i>Xist</i> adjacent to <i>Rlim</i> in these trophoblasts indicated defects in Xp silencing (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>), consistent with previously published results (<a href=\"#bib53\">Shin et al., 2010</a>).

To functionally connect <i>Rlim</i> and <i>Xist</i> during iXCI we next examined female embryos that carry a germline <i>Xist</i> mutation on the paternally inherited X (<i>Xist<sup>WT/\u0394p</sup></i>). These females are devoid of functional <i>Xist</i> RNA because during iXCI, the Xp is exclusively silenced and <i>Xist</i> is not expressed from the Xm. We used a floxed <i>Xist</i> mouse line (<a href=\"#bib11\">Csankovszki et al., 1999</a>) to generate males with a <i>Sox2</i>-Cre-mediated cKO of <i>Xist</i> (<i>Xist<sup>cKO/Y-SC</sup></i>). <i>Xist<sup>cKO/Y</sup></i> males were mated with WT/WT females (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>) and, confirming the previously observed sex-specific parent-of-origin embryonic lethality (<a href=\"#bib31\">Marahrens et al., 1997</a>), only male but no female pups were born (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Using single embryo RNA-seq, we analyzed 141 embryos generated by this cross in a similar manner as described for the RlimKO/WT dataset (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>; <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>). Consistent with the fact that the floxed region in these mice encompasses parts of the promoter, reads in <i>Xist</i> were low in all embryos of all developmental stages (not shown). Therefore, the gender of each embryo was determined by assessing expression of Y-linked genes (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Data obtained for each embryo were processed and normalized to autosomal gene expression as described for the WT/RlimKO dataset. The global F/M expression profiles of 8127 genes in this dataset with mapped reads across all developmental stages, showed increased expression specifically of X-linked transcripts in <i>Xist<sup>WT/\u0394p</sup></i> embryos, while general gene expression from autosomes was similar (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Confirming a central role for the <i>Xist</i> lncRNA during iXCI, the F/M expression profiles of X-linked genes were high in <i>Xist<sup>WT/\u0394p</sup></i> embryos of all stages (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Comparisons with WT/WT revealed significant defects in X dosage compensation in <i>Xist<sup>WT/\u0394p</sup></i> females at around E3.5 blastocyst stages (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>), consistent with published findings (<a href=\"#bib35\">Namekawa et al., 2010</a>)."

                                "text": "Studies of various adult somatic cell types have revealed general X/A expression ratios of around 1, indicating that gene expression from the active X is upregulated around two-fold. Indeed, male mouse ES cells and epiblast cells in blastocysts display X/A values of around 0.8 (<a href=\"#bib13\">Deng et al., 2013</a>, <a href=\"#bib14\">2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib29\">2007</a>). While these results indicate incomplete X upregulation they nonetheless suggest that this upregulation might be initiated during preimplantation development. To assess alterations in the X/A ratio during preimplantation development we calculated the average total expression (FPKM) of X-linked versus total autosomal genes within each embryo. This approach removes the possibility that low expressing genes, which are more frequent on the X chromosome when compared to autosomes and vary in different cell types, influence or bias the results (<a href=\"#bib14\">Deng et al., 2011</a>). Because of XCI in females, this analysis was first carried out on males. Our results revealed gradually increasing levels of transcription from the X relative to autosomes (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>) and the total increase between the 4-cell stage to E4.5 was 1.58 fold (P&lt;10\u201311; Students t-test). Calculating X/A values using a previously published RNA-seq dataset (GSE45719 in GEO repository) on single mouse preimplantation cells (<a href=\"#bib12\">Deng et al., 2014</a>), generally confirms these data (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). When we examined average expression from single chromosomes (normalized against 4-cell stage levels) we observed that, among all chromosomes, gene expression from the X displayed the highest increase (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Next, we compared the contribution of chromosomes towards total gene expression in males of each developmental stage by taking into account the numbers of annotated genes located on each chromosome. These analyses showed that, consistent with the presence of one X chromosome, at the earliest time point measured, the contribution of the X was much lower than that of any autosome, only around 0.5 fold of the average autosome (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). This contribution gradually increased to around 0.77 fold measured at E4.5, which was the 14<sup>th</sup> most highly expressed of the 20 chromosomes. These results are in general agreement with X/A levels previously measured in male murine ES cells as well as epiblast cells (<a href=\"#bib29\">Lin et al., 2007</a>), and indicate that X upregulation is initiated during preimplantation development. Including female embryos in these analyses (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>), our data reveal that X/A upregulation is initiated both during male and female preimplantation development, as female <i>Rlim<sup>\u0394/\u0394</sup></i> and <i>Xist<sup>WT/\u0394p</sup></i> embryos, which are defective in iXCI, display high E4.5/4-cell ratios of 1.58 and 1.75, respectively, similar to those of males (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). Upon examination of early developmental stages, we found that all females start out with high X/A ratios compared to those measured in males (between 1.58\u20131.87 at the 4-cell stage; <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>). However, by E4.5, whereas X/A ratios of <i>Rlim<sup>\u0394/\u0394</sup></i> and <i>Xist<sup>WT/\u0394p</sup></i> females are still high compared to males (around 1.8 fold), those of WT/WT females have decreased to levels close to 1 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>). Combined, these results indicate that X upregulation occurs during preimplantation development in males and females. In WT/WT females, X upregulation takes place concurrently with iXCI that compensates the general X gene dosage to that of males."

This approach has been recently established (<a href=\"#bib52\">Sharma et al., 2016</a>) and we provide several lines of evidence for high accuracy of RNA-seq datasets at multiple levels including single genes as well as chromosome-wide: (1) Mapping reads to single genes demonstrates high fidelity of reads within the <i>Rlim</i> regions that are present on the genome (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>), as well as reads within the <i>Tsix/Xist</i> genomic region which allows a quantitative distinction between expression of <i>Xist</i> vs <i>Tsix</i> (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). (2) The developmental expression profiles of single genes correspond to those published in the literature. This is true for cell markers (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>) as well as for <i>Xist</i> that is highly expressed in females but not males (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). (3) Our results obtained by RNA-seq on <i>Xist</i> expression (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) have been confirmed using alternative methods such as strand-specific RT-qPCR (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>) and RNA-FISH (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,C</a>). Analyzing chromosome-wide gene expression of WT mouse embryos reveals that the X dosage in females is around two-fold that of males at early embryonic stages and is subsequently adjusted to those in males at late stages (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>), in agreement with recent findings in mouse and human embryos (<a href=\"#bib43\">Petropoulos et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Chen et al., 2016</a>). Analysis of XistKO females that cannot undergo iXCI shows, as expected, around two-fold higher X-linked gene dosages when compared to males throughout preimplantation development. These data combined with results obtained by subsampling of library sizes (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>; <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>; <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>) and direct comparisons of various genotypes (WT vs RlimKO; female and male; e.g. <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplements 1C, D; 2</a>; not shown) confirm the high overall robustness and accuracy of our RNA-seq data. However, likely reflecting technical variability of single-embryo RNA-seq, variations of single gene expression levels among replicates were generally higher when compared to those of chromosome/genome-wide data, where hundreds/thousands of genes are averaged."

To study iXCI, X upregulation and the effects of <i>Xist</i> and <i>Rlim</i> on X-linked gene expression we have used embryos with congenic genetic background because this approach allows for simpler mouse genetics and excludes influences of the genetic background on X-linked gene expression. The facts that (1) females have two and males have one X chromosome and (2) <i>Xist</i> is crucial for iXCI, comparing females to males combined with the inclusion of the XistKO mouse model allows for an overall chromosome-wide assessment of the dynamics of X-linked gene expression via comparisons of gene expression profiles between the genders and/or between females with different genotypes. This is because XistKO female embryos display around two-fold higher F/M levels throughout early development (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>), thereby providing genetic evidence that the global X profile differences between XistKO and WT/WT females is the direct consequence of iXCI and that there is no other, major female-specific mechanism in preimplantation embryos that significantly influences the global X-linked gene dosage. Concerning allele-specific X-chromosome-wide gene expression, as males have a single maternally inherited X combined with the fact that iXCI in females silences exclusively the Xp (<a href=\"#bib12\">Deng et al., 2014</a>), indicates that the steady decline in F/M values seen in WT/WT females is mostly due to decreased Xp expression levels, and using B6<sub>m</sub>/CAST<sub>p</sub> hybrid embryos we have confirmed this for stage E3.5 (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). However, in contrast to chromosome-wide X-linked gene expression, at the gene level we cannot resolve the parental origin of single RNAs, as our RNA-seq data do not reveal an allele-specific resolution."

Such spatial concordance of silencing is consistent with studies in ESCs which show that <i>Xist</i> does not spread linearly along the X chromosome, but rather spreads to multiple loci on the X simultaneously, due to the three dimensional folding of the chromosome (<a href=\"#bib16\">Engreitz et al., 2013</a>). The finding that the average F/M ratios of females of all genotypes (WT/WT, <i>Rlim<sup>\u0394/\u0394</sup></i> and <i>Xist<sup>WT/\u0394p</sup></i>) remained below 2 even at early developmental stages (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2A; 5C</a>) is likely explained by a previously reported <i>Xist</i>-independent partial silencing of some X-linked transcripts (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kalantry et al., 2009</a>).

This combined with the fact that males lacking either <i>Xist</i> or <i>Rlim</i> appear healthy and are fertile indicates that crucial roles for both genes are restricted to X dosage compensation in females. Indeed, our results reveal that high levels of <i>Xist</i>, the maintenance of <i>Xist</i> clouds and X-dosage compensation in female blastocysts depend on <i>Rlim</i>. Combined, these results imply that RLIM\u2019s function on iXCI is exerted through regulation of <i>Xist</i>. Moreover, because only iXCI globally and significantly influences X-linked gene expression specifically in females, the development of temporary <i>Xist</i> clouds in RlimKO females (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>) and a similar silencing pattern at E3 between WT/WT and RlimKO females (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>; <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>) suggests that initiation of the iXCI process might\u00a0occur normally at early stages in RlimKO females.

This is further corroborated by our results targeting the <i>Rlim</i> cKO via Rosa26-Cre early during female embryogenesis (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>), confirming crucial roles for the maintenance of iXCI in blastocyst-staged female embryos. In this context, it is important to note that RLIM protein levels are down-regulated specifically in epiblast cells of E4.5 blastocyst embryos (<a href=\"#bib54\">Shin et al., 2014</a>), at a time point when these cells start to reactivate the Xp (<a href=\"#bib30\">Mak et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Okamoto et al., 2004</a>) before undergoing rXCI. Thus, because RLIM is crucial for the maintenance of iXCI at peri-implantation stages (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2</a>\u2013<a href=\"#fig4\">4</a>), this down-regulation provides an attractive molecular mechanism for triggering the Xp reactivation process."

Our analyses uncover that upregulation of X-linked transcripts is initiated in early male and female mouse embryos. In females X upregulation occurs concomitant with iXCI, which progressively leads to X gene dosage compensation between genders in an <i>Rlim</i> and <i>Xist</i>-dependent manner."

Briefly, single embryos/trophoblast cells were placed in 10ul TCL Buffer (Qiagen) supplemented with 1% BME, and snap frozen. A total of 187 samples representing WT and <i>Rlim</i>KO embryos were distributed on two 96-well plates (plus 5 mock wells) and thawed at RT for 10 min prior to RNA purification using Ampure RNA beads (Beckman-Coulter, Brea, CA).

For edgeR, we followed the workflow as described in (<a href=\"#bib1\">Anders et al., 2013</a>), except that the library size of each embryo was set as the total number of the effective counts of the autosomal genes. Specifically, edgeR was used for the removal of the unmapped, ambiguous, and not annotated reads as well as reads in rRNA and the filtering out of low expression genes after regrouping samples according to developmental stage, as the X chromosome contains many reproduction-related genes that are not expressed in somatic tissues (<a href=\"#bib25\">Khil et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Mueller et al., 2008</a>) and genes with no or low expression may influence the X/A expression ratios (<a href=\"#bib14\">Deng et al., 2011</a>). Therefore, genes that were not expressed or lowly expressed genes as determined for embryos at each stage were filtered out before normalization, via removal of genes without at least 1 read per million in n of the samples, where n is the size of the smallest group of biological replicates within each developmental stage (<a href=\"#bib1\">Anders et al., 2013</a>). The library size was then reset as the total number of the effective counts of autosomal genes. The TMM method (Trimmed Mean of M-value) was used to calculate normalization factors between samples of the same stage (<a href=\"#bib47\">Robinson and Oshlack, 2010</a>). Fragments per kilobase of exon per million reads mapped (FPKM) (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary files 1</a>, <a href=\"#SD2-data\">2</a>) and LogFC were calculated using edgeR. For gender assessment counts per million (cpm) of mapped reads in <i>Xist</i> and the seven Y-linked genes <i>Ddx3y, Eif2s3y, Kdm5d, Usp9y, Uty, Zfy1</i> and <i>Zfy2</i> were evaluated. 12 samples out of 187 sequenced in the combined <i>Rlim</i>KO/WT RNA-seq experiment, and 33 samples out of 174 sequenced in the <i>Xist</i>KO RNA-seq experiment were disregarded due to low reads or because gender could not be clearly determined. Random subsampling of library sizes to 200.000 reads per embryo was performed as described (<a href=\"#bib45\">Robinson and Storey, 2014</a>). Analyses of the subsampled datasets were carried out as described above. F/M analyses were carried out by averaging ratios per gene within each developmental stage using females of defined genotype and pooled males (WT and KO). For calculations in <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C,D</a>, 755 X-linked genes with cpms&gt;1 (before normalization) in at least three embryos at each stage were included. The dataset was then normalized against autosomal gene expression and Log2 fold change was calculated using edgeR. For the allele-specific expression analysis of X-linked transcripts in B6/CAST heterozygous females, the SNPs were called with mpileup and bcftools in the SAMtools package (<a href=\"#bib28\">Li, 2011</a>) using the aligned BAM files. A python program allelecounter was used to obtain the allele counts (<a href=\"https://github.com/secastel/allelecounter\">https://github.com/secastel/allelecounter</a>). SNPs called in females were verified by comparisons to sequences in males (C57BL/6). Data analysis was carried out by comparing SNPs with reference genomes C57BL/6 (mm10; UCSC) and CAST/Eij (<a href=\"http://csbio.unc.edu/CCstatus/index.py?run=Pseudo\">http://csbio.unc.edu/CCstatus/index.py?run=Pseudo</a>)."

However, they felt that single-cell RNA-seq analysis of embryos was critical for making conclusions about the dynamics of X-linked expression. Without this, the results on embryos were viewed as only an incremental advance over published work. In particular Chen et al. (Genome Research online) \"Single-cell analyses of X Chromosome inactivation dynamics and pluripotency during differentiation\" follow up on the Deng et al. (Science, 2014 \"Single-cell RNA-seq reveals dynamic, random monoallelic gene expression in mammalian cells) study, so single cell early development RNA-seq exists for mouse (as well as human \u2013 Petropoulos)."

Single-cell RNA-seq experiments on embryos are not required. However, if they are not done (and presumably this would take considerable time), the \"dynamics\" aspect of the work must be considerably downplayed including citing all the relevant work on the subject and placing the current results into that context. To put it simply, the RLIM aspect of the work is of sufficient interest for <i>eLife</i>, whereas the dynamics aspect is not. The original reviews are included below, but the summary above comes from considerable discussion among the reviewers and BRE."
