Despite their important role in protecting tissues against mechanical force, no cytoplasmic IF proteins have been convincingly identified in arthropods. Here we show that the ancestral cytoplasmic IF protein gene was lost in the entire panarthropod (onychophoran + tardigrade + arthropod) rather than arthropod lineage and that nuclear, lamin-derived proteins instead acquired new cytoplasmic roles at least three times independently in collembolans, copepods, and tardigrades. Transcriptomic and genomic data revealed three IF protein genes in the tardigrade <i>Hypsibius dujardini</i>, one of which (cytotardin) occurs exclusively in the cytoplasm of epidermal and foregut epithelia, where it forms belt-like filaments around each epithelial cell. These results suggest that a lamin derivative has been co-opted to enhance tissue stability in tardigrades, a function otherwise served by cytoplasmic IF proteins in all other bilaterians."

Despite their important role in protecting tissues against mechanical force, no cytoplasmic IF proteins have been convincingly identified in arthropods. Here we show that the ancestral cytoplasmic IF protein gene was lost in the entire panarthropod (onychophoran + tardigrade + arthropod) rather than arthropod lineage and that nuclear, lamin-derived proteins instead acquired new cytoplasmic roles at least three times independently in collembolans, copepods, and tardigrades. Transcriptomic and genomic data revealed three IF protein genes in the tardigrade <i>Hypsibius dujardini</i>, one of which (cytotardin) occurs exclusively in the cytoplasm of epidermal and foregut epithelia, where it forms belt-like filaments around each epithelial cell. These results suggest that a lamin derivative has been co-opted to enhance tissue stability in tardigrades, a function otherwise served by cytoplasmic IF proteins in all other bilaterians."

The third protein, which has been named \"cytotardin\", was found outside of the nucleus.

Although tardigrades have become renowned for their ability to survive extreme conditions (<a href=\"#bib47\">M\u00f8bjerg et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Raml\u00f8v and Westh, 2001</a>), including exposure to space (<a href=\"#bib49\">Persson et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Rebecchi et al., 2011</a>), only little is known about the actual mechanisms that allow their cells to resist severe mechanical stress caused by desiccation and freezing (<a href=\"#bib47\">M\u00f8bjerg et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Raml\u00f8v and Westh, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Wright, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Tanaka et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Yamaguchi et al., 2012</a>). The integrity and plasticity of tardigrade tissues might be achieved by specialised cytoskeletal components, such as IF proteins, which are known to be essential for stress resilience of cells (<a href=\"#bib27\">Herrmann et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Coulombe and Wong, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Kim and Coulombe, 2007</a>). While lamins, a group of IF proteins found in the nucleus, occur in most eukaryotes, including social amoebae (<a href=\"#bib37\">Kr\u00fcger et al., 2012</a>) and all metazoans (<a href=\"#bib14\">Dittmer and Misteli, 2011</a>), cytoplasmic IF proteins are thought to have evolved from an ancestral <i>lamin</i> gene by duplication in the bilaterian lineage (<a href=\"#bib17\">Erber et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Herrmann and Strelkov, 2011</a>). Genomic and biochemical studies have revealed that the cytoplasmic IF proteins are present in all bilaterian taxa excluding arthropods (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bartnik and Weber, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Goldstein and Gunawardena, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Erber et al., 1998</a>) [but see a contradictory report (<a href=\"#bib43\">Mencarelli et al., 2011</a>) of a putative cytoplasmic IF protein in a collembolan]. The apparent loss of cytoplasmic IF proteins in the arthropod lineage might correlate with the acquisition of an exoskeleton (<a href=\"#bib28\">Herrmann and Strelkov, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Goldstein and Gunawardena, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Erber et al., 1998</a>), which provides mechanical support to the arthropod skin.

Although this model tardigrade (<a href=\"#bib19\">Gabriel et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Gross et al., 2015</a>) shows only a limited ability to tolerate desiccation (anhydrobiosis), it clearly survives immediate freezing (cryobiosis; see <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). Our analyses revealed only one putative IF protein transcript in each of the five onychophoran species but three in <i>H. dujardini</i>. Additional screening of the recently sequenced genome (<a href=\"#bib5\">Boothby et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Koutsovoulos et al., 2015</a>) of <i>H. dujardini</i> confirms that the identified transcripts correspond to the three potential IF protein-coding genes of this species. According to sequence comparisons with well-characterized IF proteins from humans and the nematode <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>, all corresponding proteins of the three identified genes share a similar \u03b1-helical rod domain organization with three coiled coil-forming segments (coil 1A, coil 1B, coil 2; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplements 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s2\">2</a>) (review <a href=\"#bib8\">Chernyatina et al., 2015</a>).This, in conjunction with the highly conserved intermediate filament consensus motifs (review <a href=\"#bib26\">Herrmann and Aebi, 2004</a>) at the beginning and end of the rod domain of all three tardigrade proteins, classify them as intermediate filament proteins. The three tardigrade IF proteins further possess 42 residues in the coil 1B (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) \u2014 a feature that is shared between all eukaryote lamins and protostome cytoplasmic IF proteins but that must have been deleted from the ancestral cytoplasmic IF protein gene in chordates (<a href=\"#bib27\">Herrmann et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Peter and Stick, 2015</a>). In contrast to the similar organization of the rod domain, the flanking sequences vary between all three tardigrade IF proteins. One of them, which we named lamin-2, possesses all major regions known from other eukaryote lamins (<a href=\"#bib27\">Herrmann et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Dittmer and Misteli, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Burke and Stewart, 2013</a>), including the nuclear localization signal (NLS) \u2014 which generally mediates the import of proteins into the nucleus (<a href=\"#bib44\">Mical et al., 2004</a>) \u2014 the lamin-tail domain (LTD), and the carboxy-terminal CaaX motif (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A, B</a>). In contrast, the second tardigrade IF protein (named lamin-1) lacks the CaaX box, whereas the third IF protein from <i>H. dujardini</i> is missing all three motifs, including the NLS, indicating this protein may instead localize in the cytoplasm rather than the nuclear lamina of <i>H. dujardini</i> cells. Since the structure of the latter resembles the domain composition of known bilaterian cytoplasmic IF proteins (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplements 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s2\">2</a>) we consequently named it cytotardin."

In our phylogenetic analyses, all identified tardigrade and onychophoran sequences cluster within the bilaterian lamin clade, whereas none of them groups with cytoplasmic IF protein-coding genes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplements 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s2\">2</a>). Surprisingly, the three identified IF sequences of <i>H. dujardini</i>, together with two sequences from <i>Milnesium tardigradum</i>, form a strongly supported monophyletic clade of tardigrade lamins (GTR+G: Bootstrap support BS=77, LG+G: BS=80) in our analyses (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplements 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s2\">2</a>). This implies that there were at least two duplication events in the tardigrade lineage that gave rise to <i>lamin-1, lamin-2</i> and <i>cytotardin</i> genes \u2014 consequently characterizing the tardigrade IFs (including cytotardin), for example, as co-orthologous to nematode lamins rather than orthologous to nematode cytoplasmic IFs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplements 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s2\">2</a>). Our results further show that the isomin sequence of the collembolan <i>Isotomurus maculatus</i> does in fact cluster with other identified collembolan transcripts (GTR+G: BS=74, LG+G: BS=70) within the clade of arthropod lamins (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplements 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s2\">2</a>); it had previously been interpreted (<a href=\"#bib43\">Mencarelli et al., 2011</a>) as closely related to cytoplasmic IF proteins of nematodes and therefore as an ortholog of the bilaterian cytoplasmic IF proteins, likely due to the narrower dataset used for their phylogenetic analysis. These results clearly challenge the identity of isomin as a member of the bilaterian cytoplasmic IF protein clade (<a href=\"#bib43\">Mencarelli et al., 2011</a>) and suggest that orthologs of genes encoding these proteins are entirely missing in arthropods, at least in those with known genomic sequences. In fact, besides the putative IF proteins from chelicerates, crustaceans and hexapods obtained from publicly available databases (e.g. GenBank), our transcriptomic and genomic analyses, which included screening of the genome of the centipede <i>Strigamia maritima</i> (see\u00a0<a href=\"#bib9\">Chipman et al., 2014</a>), the water flea <i>Daphnia pulex</i> (see\u00a0<a href=\"#bib10\">Colbourne et al., 2011</a>), and more than 70 transcriptomes from hexapod species sequenced as part of the 1KITE project (<a href=\"#bib46\">Misof et al., 2014</a>), strongly suggest that these genes were already lost in the panarthropod lineage, since all of these panarthropod IF proteins cluster within a well-supported monophyletic clade of bilaterian lamins (GTR+G: BS=84, LG+G: BS=76; <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplements 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s2\">2</a>). In this respect, even if the metazoan lamins are polyphyletic, as recently proposed by <a href=\"#bib34\">Kollmar, 2015</a> based on the finding of putative nematocilin homologs in Bilateria, our results favour the tardigrade, copepod, and collembolan IF proteins as members of the bilaterian lamins rather than the bilaterian cytoplasmic IFs or nematocilins (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplements 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s2\">2</a>)."

Immunolocalization of lamin-1, lamin-2 and cytotardin proteins in whole-mount preparations and cryosectioned specimens, in conjunction with confocal laser-scanning microscopy, revealed a highly specific subcellular distribution and tissue-restricted expression of these proteins in <i>H. dujardini</i>. As predicted, lamin-1 and lamin-2 proteins both display a typical, lamin-like distribution within all nuclei (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013D</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). While lamin-1 is localised throughout the nucleoplasm\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), lamin-2 is restricted to the nuclear periphery (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), although there is a small overlap region between these two proteins (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). The intranuclear distribution of lamin-1 corresponds to its lack of the CaaX motif, which is responsible for the association of lamins with the nuclear envelope (<a href=\"#bib33\">Kitten and Nigg, 1991</a>). In contrast to the two lamins, cytotardin of <i>H. dujardini</i> is not localised within the nucleus, but in the peripheral cytoplasm of all epidermal and foregut cells, where it appears to be closely associated or aligned with the plasma membrane (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E\u2013G</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

Immunofluorescence analyses using cytotardin antibody revealed that this protein is located exclusively in the cytoplasm of transfected MCF-7 cells, where it forms both short filaments and extensive cytoskeletal networks which most likely are homopolymeric (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013F</a>). Notably, some of the cytotardin arrays display cage-like perinuclear structures, while others are located in the periphery close to the cell membrane (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E,F</a>). Double labelling for cytotardin and desmoplakin, a desmosomal protein mediating membrane attachment of mammalian IF proteins (<a href=\"#bib55\">Simpson et al., 2011</a>), shows that cytotardin occurs close to desmosomes but is not co-localised with desmoplakin (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,D</a>). To examine whether this arrangement was mediated by interactions between cytotardin and keratins endogenously expressed in MCF-7 cells, we double-labelled the transfectants for cytotardin and keratin-8. Our data show that these two proteins are not co-localised and that the endogenous keratin networks are displaced in cells with dense cytotardin arrays (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E,F</a>). These findings strongly support an intrinsic ability of the cytotardin protein of <i>H. dujardini</i> to both form homopolymeric filaments and cytoplasmic networks \u2014 both properties that are functionally analogous to mammalian cytoplasmic IFs (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bohnekamp et al., 2015</a>)."

Thus, the entire tardigrade body is ensheathed by a grid of belt-like filaments formed by the cytotardin protein, which retain their integrity even in contracted specimens (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E\u2013G</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

This process was most likely triggered by an initial loss of the CaaX motif and nuclear localization signal from the ancestral <i>lamin</i> gene in the tardigrade lineage. Expression of the cytotardin protein in tissues that are subject to mechanical stress might have served as a pre-adaptation for the ability of tardigrades to survive extreme environmental conditions. Similar duplication and neofunctionalization events might have occurred in the collembolan and copepod lineages, as our findings demonstrate that these two taxa also show duplicated lamins that have lost their nuclear localization signals (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3</a> and <a href=\"#fig6\">6C</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplements 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s2\">2</a>). While isomin might stabilize the intestinal epithelial cells in collembolans (<a href=\"#bib43\">Mencarelli et al., 2011</a>), the localization and function of the putative lamin-derived cytoplasmic IF protein in copepods has yet to be clarified."

The Illumina-sequenced transcriptomes of <i>H. dujardini</i> and five onychophoran species from <a href=\"#bib24\">Hering et al., 2012</a> and <a href=\"#bib25\">Hering and Mayer, 2014</a> were screened for expressed intermediate filament genes, including lamins, by BLAST searches (<a href=\"#bib2\">Altschul et al., 1997</a>) with known metazoan lamins and cytoplasmic IF genes as bait sequences. Three putative IF protein genes from <i>H. dujardini</i> and one from each of the onychophoran species studied were verified afterwards by reciprocal BLAST searches against the nr database of GenBank (<a href=\"http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi\">http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi</a>). In addition, BLAST searches of the putative tardigrade intermediate filament genes in the genome of <i>H. dujardini</i> (<a href=\"http://badger.bio.ed.ac.uk/H_dujardini/\">http://badger.bio.ed.ac.uk/H_dujardini/;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib36\">Koutsovoulos et al., 2015</a></a>) yielded nearly identical sequences as obtained in our transcriptomic data, although the automatically predicted transcripts from the genome seem to be erroneous as previously reported by <a href=\"#bib25\">Hering and Mayer, 2014</a> and had to be corrected manually. Furthermore, publicly available resources and databases [nr, TSA and EST databases of GenBank, Compagen (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hemmrich and Bosch, 2008</a>)] as well as the genome of the centipede <i>Strigamia maritima</i> (see\u00a0<a href=\"#bib9\">Chipman et al., 2014</a>), the water flea <i>Daphnia pulex</i> (see\u00a0<a href=\"#bib10\">Colbourne et al., 2011</a>), and more than 70 transcriptomes from hexapod species sequenced as part of the 1KITE project (<a href=\"#bib46\">Misof et al., 2014</a>) were comprehensively screened for putative eukaryotic intermediate filament genes. In total, 447 eukaryotic lamin and cytoplasmic IF genes were manually curated and selected for further analyses. Each of the sequences was verified by screening for the presence of a coiled-coil-forming domain (Pfam PF00038), a typical feature of intermediate filament proteins, and the presence or absence of a lamin tail domain (LTD; Pfam PF00932, SCOP d1ifra_, PDB 2lll/2kpw/1ufg/1ivt) using the webserver of Pfam 27.0 (<a href=\"#bib18\">Finn et al., 2014</a>) and SMART (<a href=\"#bib53\">Schultz et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Letunic et al., 2015</a>), respectively. In addition, the occurrence of a nuclear localization signal (NLS motif) was predicted for all sequences by using the webserver of NucPred (<a href=\"#bib6\">Brameier et al., 2007</a>) and cNLS Mapper (<a href=\"#bib35\">Kosugi et al., 2009</a>) (cut-off score = 2.0). The protein structures (\u03b1-helices and \u03b2-sheets) were predicted for the tardigrade lamin-1, lamin-2 and cytotardin using Jpred3 and JNetPRED (<a href=\"#bib11\">Cole et al., 2008</a>). For phylogenetic analyses, the rod domains of all sequences were aligned using the Mafft online version v7.245 (<a href=\"#bib30\">Katoh and Standley, 2013</a>) with the most accurate option L-INS-i and default parameters. To remove homoplastic and random-like positions, the alignment was afterwards masked with the software Noisy rel. 1.15.12 (<a href=\"#bib15\">Dress et al., 2008</a>) (-cutoff=0.8, -seqtype=P, -shuffles=20,000). Two Maximum likelihood analyses were conducted with the Pthreads version of RAxML v8.1.15 (<a href=\"#bib56\">Stamatakis, 2014</a>). For each run, the best tree was obtained from 10 independent inferences and GAMMA correction of the final tree under either the empirical LG substitution model or a dataset-specific GTR substitution matrix. The LG model was automatically selected by RAxML (PROTGAMMAAUTO option) as best-fitting substitution model, which is in line with the best-fitting model obtained with ProtTest v3.4.1 (<a href=\"#bib13\">Darriba et al., 2011</a>) (LG+G) according to the Akaike information criterion (<a href=\"#bib1\">Akaike, 1974</a>) (AIC), Bayesian Information Criterion (<a href=\"#bib54\">Schwarz, 1978</a>) (BIC), corrected AIC (<a href=\"#bib57\">Sugiura, 1978</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Hurvich and Tsai, 1989</a>), and Decision Theory Criterion (<a href=\"#bib45\">Minin et al., 2003</a>) (DT). Notably, the analysis using the dataset-specific GTR+G model yielded a better log likelihood score (\u2212174,216.74) for the best tree than using the best obtained empirical model LG+G (\u2212178,092.26). Bootstrap support values for both trees were calculated using the rapid bootstrapping algorithm implemented in RAxML from 1,000 pseudoreplicates. The protein domain structures of the sequences analysed were mapped on the trees using iTol v2 (<a href=\"#bib38\">Letunic and Bork, 2011</a>)."

Transfected MCF-7 cells grown in 10 cm<sup>2</sup> dishes were lysed in 200 \u00b5L 5x Laemmli sample buffer, boiled for 10\u2009min at 98\u00b0C and briefly centrifuged prior to use. Concentrated specimens of <i>H. dujardini</i> were lysed in 800 \u00b5L 5x Laemmli buffer containing protease inhibitor, boiled for 10\u2009min, sonicated and boiled again for 10\u2009min. SDS-PAGE and Western blotting were performed as described previously (<a href=\"#bib40\">L\u00f6ffek et al., 2010</a>). Primary antibodies, diluted in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 (A4974; AppliChem, Darmstadt, Germany), were used at the following concentrations: anti-lamin-1, 1:10,000; anti-lamin-2, 1:5,000; anti-cytotardin, 1:10,000, anti-HA tag (MMS-101P;\u00a0Covance), 1:1,000 and anti-GFP (sc-5385;\u00a0Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas,\u00a0TX), 1:1,000. Anti-lamin-1 and anti-lamin-2 antibodies were only tested in Western blots based on lysates of tardigrade specimens."

Coil 1B is missing 4 amino acids and coil 2 carries a 3-amino acid insertion. The size of these helical segments including coil 1A is highly conserved, with the rare exception of coil 2 of the single lamin of <i>C. elegans</i>, which is missing 2 heptads or 14 amino acids. Notably, the IF consensus motif in coil 1A exhibits high conservation as does the IF consensus motif at the end of the rod in coil 2. More surprisingly, the linker segment L1 is entirely kept both to the very amino acid number and with respect to the quality of amino acids, which all are good for \u03b1-helix formation; the same holds true for linker L12 from what one can conclude that structural principals in the \u03b1-helical rod domain are highly conserved. <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> does not give any clue to how related these domains are. In <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a> the subdivision in 2A and 2B is completely illusory, it is wrong. The authors should refer to a recent structural review of Sergei Strelkov (Leuven) in Current Opinion in Cell Biology (2015). \"Head\" and \"tail\" sequences vary very much in IF proteins \u2013 notably here: the Ig fold sequence in the carboxyl-terminal domain exhibits highest identity with that of human lamin A, when the whole amino acid sequence is considered. The NLS shows an interesting variation from the standard, both CDK1 sequences flanking the rod are there but slightly shifted compared with the position of lamin A. In summary, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a> gives the impression that everything is like in every IF protein and that lamin-1 to -3 are identical: to what extent are they? The tree in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> does not tell anything in detail. So how different is the tardigrade cytoplasmic IF protein from its lamins, and how closely is it related to human keratins K8 and K18? Does it have features that are anything like \"keratin-related\"? Along these lines: the structural models shown as Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3 are pretty meaningless \u2013 all three lamin-1 to -3 should form coiled coils."

This important finding suggests that the development of an exoskeleton may not have been the main driving force for the loss of cytoplasmic IFs in euarthropods. Moreover, the presented phylogenetic analysis strongly supports that several members of this taxon, notably tardigrades, collembolans and copepods each independently evolved novel cytoplasmic IFs, again originating from gene duplications of a nuclear lamin gene, long after the first bilaterian cytoplasmic IF arose. Furthermore, the authors demonstrated the capacity of the novel cytoplasmic IF protein lamin-3 to form IF networks within transfected cultured cells and traced its expression in the tardigrade <i>H. dujardini</i>, showing a unique, belt-like distribution within the peripheral cytoplasm of ectodermally derived epithelial cells, such as the epidermis."

Overall the results and conclusions presented in the submitted manuscript are convincing, making a valuable contribution to both, a better understanding of the evolutionary history of the IF protein family and how the novel cytoplasmic IF may account for the tardigrades ability to withstand the extraordinary mechanical stress enforced by extreme environmental conditions such as desiccation and cryobiosis."

Strange enough, the latter organism is not centrally discussed, as for this worm Klaus Weber and his group in G\u00f6ttingen demonstrated how lamins and invertebrate cytoplasmic intermediate filament proteins are related, i.e. by loss of the nuclear localization signal (NLS) the cytoplasmic IF proteins emerged (Dodemont et al. 1990 &amp; 1994 EMBO J., Andreas Erber et al. 1998 &amp; J. Mol. Evol., and several more papers). Obviously a fruitful strategy. A selected paradigmatic-type comparison would be very instructive. I took the CAAX-box-free version and compared its sequence with human lamin A: 1. Coil 1B is missing 4 amino acids and coil 2 carries a 3-amino acid insertion. The size of these helical segments including coil 1A is highly conserved, with the rare exception of coil 2 of the single lamin of C. elegans, which is missing 2 heptads or 14 amino acids. Notably, the IF consensus motif in coil 1A exhibits high conservation as does the IF consensus motif at the end of the rod in coil 2. More surprisingly, the linker segment L1 is entirely kept both to the very amino acid number and with respect to the quality of amino acids, which all are good for \u03b1-helix formation; the same holds true for linker L12 from what one can conclude that structural principals in the \u03b1-helical rod domain are highly conserved. <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> does not give any clue to how related these domains are. In <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a> the subdivision in 2A and 2B is completely illusory, it is wrong. The authors should refer to a recent structural review of Sergei Strelkov (Leuven) in Current Opinion in Cell Biology (2015).</i>"

It forms filamentous structures in the cytoplasm of epithelial cells. This part of the manuscript is clear and convincing. From their data they conclude that the genes for cytoplasmic IF proteins have been lost at the base of the panarthropod lineage and that cIF genes have been acquired at least three times independently in collembolans, copepods, and tardigrades. This is a very interesting point. This statement is based solely on evolutionary tree construction of a broad range of IF rod sequences. However, it is not fully convincing. For the collembolan lineage it is based solely on the fact that the isomin rod sequence groups with bilaterian lamin rod sequences. At none of the nodes of the two trees bootstrap values exceed 50%.

First, the authors perform a detailed phylogenetic analysis of IF proteins and their relatives, including isomin. They conclude that isomin clusters with lamins rather than with cytoplasmic IFs. Second, the authors experimentally explore the localization of three lamins (1,2 and 3) present in a tardigrade. They show that while 1 and 2 are located in the nucleus as expected, lamin-3 is observed in the cytoplasm of epithelial cells. The main conclusion of the paper is that the true cytoplasmic IFs were lost in panarthropods, but lamin-like IFs can take over their functions in the cytoplasm. While this theory certainly needs additional proof (beyond the reported data on tardigrade lamin-3 and in fact on isomin as well), I think that this is an important advance. The new findings also suggest that the current terminology may need some adjustment, as the name 'cytoplasmic IFs' becomes ambiguous as one reads through the paper. Should one speak of 'non-lamin' IFs vs. lamins to reflect the phylogeny, which would then be uncoupled from the cytoplasmic vs. nuclear localization?</i>"
