Structural information on two-thirds of the complex has been limited to coarse subunit mapping onto 2-D images from electron micrographs. We have performed chemical cross-linking and mass spectrometry, and combined the results with information from X-ray crystallography, homology modeling, and cryo-electron microscopy by an integrative modeling approach to determine a 3-D model of the entire Mediator complex. The approach is validated by the use of X-ray crystal structures as internal controls and by consistency with previous results from electron microscopy and yeast two-hybrid screens. The model shows the locations and orientations of all Mediator subunits, as well as subunit interfaces and some secondary structural elements. Segments of 20\u201340 amino acid residues are placed with an average precision of 20 \u00c5. The model reveals roles of individual subunits in the organization of the complex."

Structural information on two-thirds of the complex has been limited to coarse subunit mapping onto 2-D images from electron micrographs. We have performed chemical cross-linking and mass spectrometry, and combined the results with information from X-ray crystallography, homology modeling, and cryo-electron microscopy by an integrative modeling approach to determine a 3-D model of the entire Mediator complex. The approach is validated by the use of X-ray crystal structures as internal controls and by consistency with previous results from electron microscopy and yeast two-hybrid screens. The model shows the locations and orientations of all Mediator subunits, as well as subunit interfaces and some secondary structural elements. Segments of 20\u201340 amino acid residues are placed with an average precision of 20 \u00c5. The model reveals roles of individual subunits in the organization of the complex."

Mediator performs this important role in all organisms from yeast to humans, but it is not clear how it works. A crucial step towards the solution of this problem is to understand the three-dimensional structure of the complex."

First, the X-ray crystal structure of pol II and also that of the Mediator Head module could be used to assess the validity of cross-links, as 130 of the 402 high confidence cross-links were between residues in these structures. Only five of these 130 cross-links occurred between residues further apart than the 35 \u00c5 threshold (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). This number of violations was therefore consistent with the FDR of 4.1%, estimated from the number of decoy database hits. Second, we constructed an integrative model of pol II based on the cross-link dataset, a cryo-EM electron density map (EMD-1883, 20.9 \u00c5 resolution using FSC 0.5), and X-ray crystal structures of the pol II subunits, using IMP. The X-ray crystal structures of the subunits were represented as independent rigid bodies, and the regions not observed in the structure were represented by flexible strings of beads. A low resolution EM map was used for comparison with the EM data available for Mediator (see below). Starting from scrambled configurations, the positions and orientations of the pol II subunits were optimized with a Monte Carlo procedure (which applies a large number of random movements guided by the input data), resulting in configurations that satisfied the input data well. This ensemble of good-scoring solutions recapitulated the known architecture of pol II (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). The average root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of the solutions with respect to the crystal structure of pol II was 14 \u00c5. All subunits were correctly placed, except for Rpb8 and Rpb9, whose locations were undetermined, due to a lack of cross-link restraints."

The 38 cross-links were selected according to our minimal length requirement of four amino acid residues per cross-linked peptide; three cross-links were common to both datasets. This modest overlap is likely due to the use of a different chemical cross-linker, as well as to the presence of additional subunits in our full native Middle module. The complete dataset of 294 inter-subunit cross-links defined an interaction map of 19 of the 21 Mediator proteins (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). The two subunits for which there were no inter-subunit cross-links have been crystallized in complexes with other Mediator subunits: Med6 as part of the Head module (<a href=\"#bib48\">Robinson et al., 2012</a>), and Med31 in a complex with the N-terminal region of Med7 (<a href=\"#bib33\">Koschubs et al., 2009</a>). Both proteins were present in our native holoenzyme preparations, as shown by SDS PAGE and mass spectrometry (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Two subunits, Med17 (Head module) and Med14 (Tail module) showed patterns of cross-links split between two or more different Mediator modules. The majority of Med17 (residues 123\u2013687) formed an extensive cross-link network with other subunits of the Head module, as expected from the X-ray crystal structure (<a href=\"#bib48\">Robinson et al., 2012</a>). The N-terminal region of Med17 (1\u2013122), not observed in the Head module crystal structure, formed many cross-links with Med7 and Med21, subunits of the Middle module (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Similarly, Med14, a presumptive Tail module subunit, formed cross-links to other Tail module proteins (Med2 and 15), but almost exclusively in its C-terminal region (residues 712\u20131082), while the N-terminal region and the majority of the protein (residues 1\u2013711) cross-linked instead to Middle module subunits (Med4, Med9, Med10, and Med21). The N-terminal regions of Med17 and Med14 not only extended into the Middle module but also formed many cross-links with each other. For these reasons, we redefine the Mediator modules to include the N-terminal domains of Med17 (residues 1\u2013122) and Med14 (residues 1\u2013711) in the Middle module rather than the Head and Tail modules (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, Med14 and Med17 colored by module localization)."

To confirm that we had sampled conformational space sufficiently to reach model convergence, we compared two independent halves of the solutions to each other and to the entire set, showing they were all similar to one another (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a>)."

In fact, the Bayesian scoring function automatically assigned a low scoring weight to the inter-modular cross-links, pointing to an inconsistency of the inter-modular cross-links in the holoenzyme dataset with the EM density map of the free Mediator. The satisfaction of intra-modular cross-links suggests that the arrangement of Mediator subunits within modules of the holoenzyme is similar to that in the free Mediator, whereas the inconsistency of the inter-modular cross-links with the EM map suggests that motions of the modules relative to one another occur upon association with pol II in the holoenzyme. Indeed, EM studies have indicated large motions about hinges between the modules, opening the compact structure of free Mediator for wrapping around pol II in the holoenzyme (<a href=\"#bib4\">Asturias et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Davis et al., 2002</a>). Based on these observations, the inter-modular cross-links were not considered in our analysis of the free Mediator."

The precision of the Middle and Tail modules is 24 and 33 \u00c5, respectively. These values represent the average fluctuations of the individual residues or beads in 3-D space across the ensemble of solutions comprising the highest scoring cluster. Precision defined in this way is not directly comparable to the resolution of an EM map, which refers to the uncertainty of the overall electron density, without regard to the placement of components within the density. Although the precision of the Tail module is lower than that of the Middle or Head modules, it is sufficient to position the Tail subunits within the Tail EM density as features with high cross-link density, and consequently high local precision values (such as the Middle-Tail junction), provide strong spatial restraints. The overall precision of the Mediator model sufficed to determine the positions and orientations of all Mediator subunits, and 20\u201340 residue beads could be localized with precisions of 10\u201350 \u00c5 (<a href=\"#fig2s5\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 5</a>), depending on the density of cross-linking restraints. We represented the cluster of solutions by a localization density (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>), defined as the probability of observing a particular subunit at a specific point in space in the cluster of solutions. Because the model is three-dimensional, it depicts the contact surfaces between subunits, with residue-level resolution at many points where cross-links are formed between them. This contact information is especially rich and reliable in regions where multiple cross-links are formed and where contacts occur in multiple models in the cluster, as depicted by the darkest boxes in the domain interaction map (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). Some cross-links anticipated from the domain interaction map were not observed, most likely because cross-linking depends on the occurrence of unprotonated, appropriately oriented, solvent\u2013accessible pairs of lysine residues, and on the formation of tryptic peptides with physicochemical properties amenable to liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry."

There were only three discrepancies (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>, red lines), corresponding to the Med3-Med21, Med1-Med7, and Med1-Med5 interactions. The Med3-Med21 interaction, from two-hybrid data, is clearly spurious, because the proteins are found in different Mediator modules (Head and Tail) and our model, consistent with an EM localization study (<a href=\"#bib58\">Tsai et al., 2014</a>), places the two subunits more than 100 \u00c5 apart. A second subunit interaction that is unsupported by our model, between the C-terminal domain of Med1 and Med5, also comes from two-hybrid data (<a href=\"#bib23\">Guglielmi et al., 2004</a>). Although it also relates proteins located in different modules (Middle and Tail), the two proteins are less than 30 \u00c5 apart in our model. The holoenzyme cross-link dataset includes one cross-link of Med5 (Tail) to Med1 (Middle) and two cross-links of Med5 (Tail) to Med15 (Tail). Because the Med1-Med5 cross-links are inter-modular, they were assigned lower weights by our scoring function and were not satisfied in the final model. It is possible that the interactions occur in alternative conformational states, where Med1 is in close proximity to Med5. A third subunit interaction that is unsupported by our model, between Med1-Med7, comes from immunoprecipitation data (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kang et al., 2001</a>), and cannot be ruled out, because the N-terminus of Med1 is in the vicinity of the 16 C-terminal residues of Med7, which are unmodeled in the crystal structure and not well localized in our study (<a href=\"#fig2s5\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). A lack of lysine residues in the 16 C-terminal residues of Med7 might explain why this putative interaction was not detected by cross-linking."

Med7C and Med21 form a four-helix bundle, proposed to stack end-to-end on a four-helix bundle of Med4 and Med9, in a manner analogous to the packing observed in Med7C-21 crystals. In our modeling, we did not impose end-to-end stacking, but rather represented the Med7C-21 crystal structure and the Med4-Med9 homology model as two distinct rigid bodies. In our final Mediator model, the ends of the two four-helix bundles are in close proximity (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,C</a>), although without enforcing end-to-end helical stacking. Satisfaction of the EM restraints in other regions of the Middle module appears to require a distortion of the putative end-to-end interaction (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>), and many solutions displayed a twist of one four-helix bundle with respect to the other, reflecting the asymmetrical nature of the Middle module EM density."

The Middle module can be subdivided into two halves: Med7C-Med21, with interacting proteins Med10, Med19, and Med31; and Med4-Med9, with interacting protein Med1. The only two proteins that interact extensively with both halves of the Middle module are Med14 and Med17, which perform special architectural roles in the Mediator complex, discussed in more detail below. A Med7N-Med31 heterodimer, connected to the helical Med7C domain by an unstructured 27 amino acid residue linker, is localized to a distinct protrusion within the central portion of the EM map. The flexible C-terminal domain of Med4 is localized to the same region. The Med4-9 half of the Middle module is defined by a close association of the two large subunits Med1 and Med14 with opposite faces of the helical backbone. The N-terminus of Med1 forms an extensive interaction surface with Med4-9 (<a href=\"#fig3 fig4\">Figures 3, 4</a>), with eight cross-links between residues in the first 418 residues of Med1 and residues of Med4-9 located on one face of the N-terminal four-helix bundle (<a href=\"#fig1 fig4\">Figures 1D, 4B</a> and <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). This high density of cross-links leads to a precise localization of the first half of Med1, with Cluster 1 showing low root-mean-square fluctuations (RMSFs) for residues within this portion of the protein. In contrast, the C-terminus of Med1 lacks cross-links (<a href=\"#fig1 fig4\">Figures 1D, 4B</a>) and is restrained only by the EM density, resulting in a lower precision of the model and higher RMSF values (<a href=\"#fig2s5\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 5</a>)."

The C-terminus of Med14 also contributes to the structure of this region, consistent with the finding that a C-terminal deletion of Med14 results in the loss of all Tail subunits from Mediator (<a href=\"#bib40\">Li et al., 1995</a>). The Med2 and Med3 NTDs are modeled with relatively high precision (<a href=\"#fig2s5\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 5</a>), and structural similarity searches with these NTDs show a number of high similarity hits to coiled-coil proteins, in particular to multiple chains within the highly elongated Fibrinogen trimeric coiled-coil structure (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 5\u2014source data 1</a>). We extended this analysis to calculate the odds that each of these NTDs forms a coiled-coil structure, with the use of two independent prediction servers (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). We found a good correspondence between regions of similarity to coiled-coil proteins and regions predicted with high confidence (p &gt; 0.8) to form coiled-coil structures. These analyses, together with the co-localization of these domains in our Mediator model and the previous observation that Med2 and Med3 can be isolated as a heterodimer (<a href=\"#bib7\">Beve et al., 2005</a>), suggest that the N-termini of Med2 and 3 form a coiled-coil motif in the Middle-Tail contact region."

We extended this analysis and identified a number of high-confidence hits to seven-bladed \u03b2-propeller structures. The most complete match to a full \u03b2-propeller was to Sec31, a component of the <i>S. cerevisiae</i> coat protein complex (COPII) involved in ER vesicle transport (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a> and <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 5\u2014source data 1</a>). We used a homology model, in which the first 540 residues of Med16 were mapped onto the Sec31 \u03b2-propeller structure, in our modeling of the Tail module architecture (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Two intra-protein cross-links of Med16 could be mapped onto the homology model without violation (<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). In our model, the Med16 \u03b2-propeller was located in a central position at the base of the Tail module, making extensive contacts with Med5 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). The central location of Med16 within the Tail module and a large interaction surface with Med5 are consistent with the finding that the entire Tail module is destabilized and lost in Mediator preparations from a strain from which the <i>MED16</i> gene was deleted (<a href=\"#bib40\">Li et al., 1995</a>). In contrast, Med5 occupies a terminal position within the Tail module, and the <i>MED5</i> gene can be deleted without disrupting the remainder of the module (<a href=\"#bib58\">Tsai et al., 2014</a>). Although the majority of Med5 occupies a single location within the Tail module, the N-domain of Med5 follows a path around the outside edge of the Med16 \u03b2-propeller domain before interacting with Med15 at a more internal locus (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). This interaction is consistent with an earlier finding that Med5 can form a tetrameric complex with the Med2-Med3-Med15 trimer in the absence of Med16 (<a href=\"#bib7\">Beve et al., 2005</a>)."

(2015)</a> recently reported a 9.7 \u00c5 structure of a yeast \u2018core initiation complex\u2019, comprising the Mediator Head module, a minimal Middle module, pol II, a nucleic acid scaffold, and the general transcription factors TBP, TFIIB and TFIIF, obtained by cryo-EM and chemical cross-linking (<a href=\"#bib45\">Plaschka et al, 2015</a>). The Mediator portion of the cryo-EM map represents only about 50% of the mass of Mediator, as the \u2018core initiation complex\u2019 does not include the 480 kDa Tail module or the Middle module protein Med1. The structure shows the \u2018neck\u2019 of the Head module binding to pol II near subunits Rpb 4 and Rpb7, with the \u2018mobile jaw\u2019 regions of Med 18 and Med20 extending to contact the TFIIB-binding site and subunits Rpb 3, 10, 11, and 12. Cross-links between subunits within the Head (30 unique cross-links) and Middle (71 unique cross-links) modules are in complete agreement with our three-dimensional architectural model of the free Mediator complex (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Docking our Mediator model to the EM map of <a href=\"#bib45\">Plaschka et al. (2015)</a> resulted in a holoenzyme model that was also largely consistent with Mediator to polymerase cross-links (12 non-redundant and within the modeled sequence) identified by <a href=\"#bib45\">Plaschka et al. (2015)</a> (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,C</a>). However, a set of 17 Mediator to polymerase cross-links from our study of holoenzyme showed agreement only in the region where the Head module contacts Rpb4 and Rpb7 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). Cross-links between the Tail and Middle modules to pol II in our study were not consistent with the map of <a href=\"#bib45\">Plaschka et al. (2015)</a> (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). As mentioned above, cross-links between Mediator modules in our study were also poorly satisfied by the EM density for free Mediator used in our integrative modeling. Together, these findings suggest a different conformation of the Mediator-polymerase holoenzyme in the presence of the Tail module (not included in the map of <a href=\"#bib45\">Plaschka et al. (2015)</a>) and in the absence of the nucleic acid scaffold and general factors. Our results point to a similar contact site between the Head module and pol II to that in the model of the \u2018core initiation complex\u2019, but suggest that a conformational change in the Mediator brings the Tail module in contact with pol II near the DNA binding cleft of pol II in the holoenzyme, a suggestion that is consistent with our own preliminary cryo-EM data on the holoenzyme (P Robinson, unpublished) (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). Such conformational dynamics are in keeping with the idea that interaction between Mediator and pol II in the absence of other factors is largely determined by interactions between the Rpb1 CTD and the neck of the Head module (<a href=\"#bib48\">Robinson et al., 2012</a>)."

The vector for C-terminal protein G tag cassette amplification [pCEMM-CTAP(KanMX)] was first generated by sub-cloning a 1633 bp fragment containing the Tn903 <i>KanMX</i> marker gene with flanking LoxP sites from pUG6 between the XhoI (597) and NotI (616) sites of mammalian expression vector pCEMM-CTAP(SG), positioned immediately C-terminal to the protein G domain sequence (Forward primer 5\u2032-3\u2032: actgtcactgaatagctcgaggaacgcggccgccagctgaagcttcgtacg\u2013Reverse primer 5\u2032-3\u2032: ggcggaatttacgtagcggccgcccgcggccgcataggccactagtggatctg).

The use of two distinct protease cleavage sites allowed the isolation of stable holoenzyme complex using a two-stage elution approach (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). First-stage TEV cleavage led to the release of free Mediator, with Mediator retention occurring through complex formation with uncleaved RNA pol II. Subsequent cleavage with 3C PreScission protease led to the release of both free RNA pol II and holoenzyme complex. The order of protease cleavage could be reversed with equivalent yields of holoenzyme complex (\u223c5 mg/3 Kg dry cell mass). The holoenzyme was further purified from free RNA pol II (TEV-3C) or Mediator (3C-TEV) using ion exchange (75\u2013600 mM (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>; HiTrap FFQ) and size-exclusion (200 mM (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.8, 5% glycerol, 2 mM DTT; Superose 6) chromatography steps. In the case of the TEV-3C cleavage order, the holoenzyme eluted from the IE column as a leading shoulder in the large peak due to free RNA pol II. Using the 3C-TEV cleavage order, the holoenzyme was retained longer in IE than free Mediator and could be resolved as an independent peak."

SVM models were trained on half of the data and evaluated for their ability to correctly classify true negatives (hits to the decoy database) on the test set. CSMs were considered decoy matches if either of the two constituent peptides came from the decoy database. The final SVM model included a metric reflecting the number of product ions matched to the less fragmented of the two peptides (score_difference) and a metric for the overall match of the spectrum (percentage of the total ion current annotated). The inclusion of additional metrics did not increase the predictive power of the model. An SVM decision value of 0 was taken as the acceptance threshold for reporting cross-linked peptides. FDRs were calculated by dividing the number of decoy hits at this threshold by 10 (to account for the larger decoy database size) and dividing by the number of hits to the target database."

When spectra could be interpreted by multiple cross-linked peptide-pairs, CSMs were considered to be unambiguous if the second best match was further than 0.3 SVM decision value units from the top match. Intra-protein cross-links were selected over inter-protein cross-links if there were still conflicts. The remaining decoy matches were also removed from consideration. Following these selection criteria, most CSMs identified a single cross-linked peptide-pair. The remaining spectral redundancy came exclusively from ambiguous site localizations, where there was sufficient evidence to identify both peptides, but the position of the modified amino acid remained ambiguous. In these cases, all possible sites were reported using a spectral identifier and used in subsequent modelling steps."

We used an unbiased, exhaustive computational docking procedure to determine whether the Head module can be docked unambiguously within this map. We employed the Colores search module within Situs 2.7 (<a href=\"#bib12\">Chacon and Wriggers, 2002</a>) that performs a 3-stage 6D cross-correlation search of a single rigid body PDB structure within a map density at a user-defined resolution and angular sampling. Because the EM map resolution is worse than 10 \u00c5, a Laplacian filter is applied by default to maximize the fitting contrast. We ran Colores using the map resolution value (25 \u00c5) and threshold (0.35) reported in the EM database (using FSC 0.5 criterion) with the default angular sampling of 30\u00b0. The unnormalized correlation coefficient of the top-scoring docking solution was within the range 0.3\u20130.5 expected for appropriately docked Laplacian-filtered densities. The top scoring solution (unnormalized CC 0.302) was 24% higher than the next best unormalized docking solution (unnormalized CC 0.243) and was found to be in close agreement with previous manual docking and localization studies.

We promoted cross-links with high spectral redundancy, and we assigned different weight parameters to the inter- and intra-module cross-links. The goal was to lessen the impact of inter-module cross-links while benefitting from intra-module ones. Because the cross-links were collected on a sample of Mediator Holoenzyme complex, we expected the inter-module cross-links to be less accurate than the intra-module cross-links in describing the apo-mediator state. This finding is consistent with EM studies in which the presence of RNA pol II induces large motions about the hinge regions between the Mediator modules, while the intra-module topology appears unchanged (<a href=\"#bib4\">Asturias et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Davis et al., 2002</a>). We grouped the cross-links into two classes, including a class of inter-module cross-links (23 cross-links defined by 44 spectral matches), and a class with intra-module cross-links (271 cross-links defined by 1856 spectral matches) (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>)."

The Monte Carlo moves included random translation and rotation of rigid bodies (up to 2 \u00c5 and 0.04 radians, respectively), and random translation of individual beads in the flexible segments (up to 3 \u00c5). 64 replicas were used, with temperatures ranging between 1.0 and 2.5. 10 independent sampling calculations were performed, each one starting with a random initial configuration. A model was saved every 10 Gibbs sampling steps, each consisting of a cycle of Monte Carlo steps that moved every rigid body and flexible bead once. The sampling produced a total of 165,523 models in 20 independent runs. Additionally, we performed 34 sampling runs by randomly removing (i.e., \u2018jackknifing\u2019) 10% of the cross-links, thereby producing 198,498 models. The entire sampling procedure took approximately 2 weeks on a cluster of 1280 computational cores."

The localization density map of a subunit was contoured at a density of 0.15. Importantly, the two localization density maps were similar to each other, and to the density map obtained considering the whole ensemble of models, demonstrating that the Monte Carlo algorithm likely sampled all solutions that satisfy the input restraints.

As we are interested only in models that best satisfy the restraints, we select a small fraction of the models representing the very best scoring solutions (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>). These models then undergo pairwise-RMSD clustering to separate out divergent structural states (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>). In our study, most of the best scoring models (92%, n = 500) gave a unique subunit arrangement for 18 of the 21 Mediator subunits. The divergent clusters differed only in the relative locations of Med5, Med15 and Med16 within the Tail module (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3C</a>). We compared these three clusters in terms of crosslink violation statistics (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3E</a>) and consistency with prior EM localization experiments (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3H</a>). A single cluster showed both consistency with earlier localizations and significantly better violation statistics and was therefore deemed to be the Mediator architecture with the highest confidence."

These sources had 63 cross-links in common. Hence, the current study used 201 unique cross-links. The atomic structures for the twelve-subunit yeast pol II have been previously determined by X-ray crystallography (PDB accession ID: 1WCM, [<a href=\"#bib3\">Armache et al., 2005</a>]). The crystallographic structure covers 89% of the residues in the pol II complex. A 20.9 \u00c5 resolution density map from single particle EM reconstruction of the pol II complex was also considered (EMDB accession id: 1883, [<a href=\"#bib16\">Czeko et al., 2011</a>]). The 12 pol II subunits were represented as 15 domains, where Rpb1 was decomposed into 3 domains (residues: 1\u20131140, 1141\u20131274, 1275\u20131733), Rpb2 was decomposed into 2 domains (residues 1\u20131102, 1103\u20131224), and the remaining subunits were represented as single domains. Regions without a crystal structure were modeled as beads containing up to 5 amino acid residues. We followed the same 4-stage procedure as described for the Mediator complex above."

This multi-subunit complex acts in concert with the RNA polymerase to regulate transcription, notably initiation, in eukaryotes. Current direct structural data of the holoenzyme complex are limited to a low-resolution cryo-EM map and crystal structures of some subunits or domains. By gathering additional indirect structural information through chemical cross-linking and mass spectrometry (MS) the authors derive a molecular model through integrative modelling in which the subunits are placed taking into account previously available data, in particular the existing cryo-EM map at 25 \u00c5 resolution of the yeast mediator holoenzyme complex. To validate the modelling procedure, the authors used the RNA polymerase part of the complex for which the crystal structure is known. Taken together, the new MS data (about 200 unique cross-links) and the impressive integrative modelling offer a useful molecular model of the mediator complex providing many new insights into the complex organisation and inter-subunit interactions. Some caution though should be taken considering that this is mostly based on indirect rather than direct structural evidence, and this should be clarified to the general reader. It should also be stressed that the major steric constraints used to compute the model come from the envelope of the Mediator that was obtained previously by Tsai et al. (Cell 2014) and the X-ray structure of Mediator subunits (several papers)."

The top scoring solution was also consistent with the subunit localizations suggested by <a href=\"#bib58\">Tsai et al. 2014</a> (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2013figure supplement 3G</a>). Taken together, these results give high confidence in our proposed Tail module architecture. We also performed additional quality tests to assess the model sampling convergence and the robustness of the cross-link dataset (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2013figure supplement 4</a>). First, since the arrangements of the subunits were identical when we took the whole ensemble of models, and two randomly chosen subsamples that comprises 50% of the models, ruled out any limited-sampling artefact. Second, the same subunit arrangement was reproduced by cross-link dataset jackknifing (i.e., randomly removing 10% of the crosslinks), demonstrating the robustness of the crosslink dataset, which is critical in determining the architecture of the whole complex."

The precision of our model reflects not a limitation of our method but rather of the input data. The model reflects the sparseness and uncertainty of the input data, without over-interpretation. In the example of Pol II, we derived a model from 201 cross-links and a 21 \u00c5 resolution EM map. Because the input data was sparse and noisy, an ensemble of solutions was obtained. The precision of the model (defined above) of 14 \u00c5 was nevertheless sufficient to unambiguously determine the positions of the Pol II subunits in the map. The analysis of Pol II was performed in this way to enable comparison with our study of Mediator, which employed a 25 \u00c5 resolution EM map. The precision of placement of subunits in the best model is addressed in <a href=\"#fig2s5\">Figure 2\u2013figure supplement 5</a>. There we represent the root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) of each non-Head module subunit across the entire length of the subunit, both as a graphical plot and as a 3-D heat map, in which gradients of color are used to display regions of higher and lower localization precision.

As stated in the aforementioned paragraph, an analysis of the satisfaction of crosslinks in the best scoring cluster shows that whereas intra-modular Mediator crosslinks (residue-residue distances within modules) are 95% satisfied in this cluster, inter-modular crosslinks (residue-residue distances between modules) are only 10% satisfied. This statistic alone is strongly suggestive that the configuration of modules in the free Mediator state (Asturias cryo-EM map) is not consistent with that found in the Holoenzyme state."
