Using a <i>Toxoplasma</i> vaccination model, we delineate the sequence of events that na\u00efve CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells undergo to become terminal effectors and the differentiation steps controlled by IL-12. We demonstrate that direct IL-12 signaling on CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells is essential for the induction of KLRG1 and IFN-\u03b3, but the subsequent downregulation of CXCR3 is controlled by IL-12 indirectly through the actions of IFN-\u03b3 and IFN-\u03b3-inducible chemokines. Differentiation of nascent effectors occurs in an extrafollicular splenic compartment and is driven by late IL-12 production by DCs distinct from the classical CD8\u03b1<sup>+</sup> DC. Unexpectedly, we also found extensive proliferation of both KLRG1<sup>\u2212</sup> and KLRG1<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the marginal zone and red pulp, which ceases prior to the final KLRG1<sup>Hi</sup> CXCR3<sup>Lo</sup> stage. Our findings highlight the notion of an extrafollicular pathway for effector T cell generation."
