Gazelles roar during mating displays (<a href=\"#bib10\">Blank et al., 2014</a>), songbirds stimulate reproductive activity in females by singing (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bentley et al., 2000</a>), sac-winged bats produce complex serenades during sexual displays (<a href=\"#bib7\">Behr and von Helversen, 2004</a>), and anurans phonotaxis towards ultrasonic courtship vocalizations (<a href=\"#bib75\">Shen et al., 2008</a>). In mice <i>(Mus musculus)</i>, several indirect observations suggest that ultrasonic vocalizations play a role in courtship. For example, USVs occur during mating (<a href=\"#bib73\">Sewell, 1972</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Hanson and Hurley, 2012</a>), urine from females but not males stimulates vocal production in males (<a href=\"#bib60\">Nyby et al., 1979</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Musolf et al., 2010</a>), female mice spend more time near vocalizing males than mute males (<a href=\"#bib66\">Pomerantz et al., 1983</a>), and female mice preferentially approach a speaker playing male vocalizations rather than a speaker playing background noise (<a href=\"#bib56\">Musolf et al., 2010</a>) or whistle-like control sounds (<a href=\"#bib30\">Hammerschmidt et al., 2009</a>)."

However, mice are adaptable and opportunistic animals that thrive in diverse conditions. Mice can occupy large and sparsely populated territories, where dyadic interactions would be most common, or small, densely inhabited regions where multiple individuals would frequently interact (<a href=\"#bib3\">Anderson, 1961</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Berry and Bronson, 1992</a>). <a href=\"#bib67\">Portfors (2007)</a> reported that USV rate and complexity increase when mice are housed in large, mixed sex groups. Moreover, mice living in large populations for extended periods exhibit social interactions that are affected by the dynamics of multiple group members (<a href=\"#bib74\">Shemesh et al., 2013</a>) and complex dominance hierarchies (<a href=\"#bib84\">Weissbrod et al., 2013</a>). These interactions may have reproductive consequences that impact courtship by forcing females to choose between males (<a href=\"#bib77\">Silk, 2007</a>). Therefore, examining the vocal repertoire of groups of mice housed together is a unique, untapped opportunity to examine USV production during complex social contexts. These conditions may provide insight into the role vocalizations play in mouse social behavior."

Males are believed to produce the majority of vocalizations during male-female encounters. Previous reports have shown that female mice rarely vocalize in the presence of an anesthetized or devocalized male, and more often than not are completely silent (<a href=\"#bib86\">Whitney et al., 1973</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Warburton et al., 1989</a>). However, females have been reported to vocalize at high rates during same sex interactions (<a href=\"#bib47\">Maggio and Whitney, 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Moles et al., 2007</a>). Therefore, females may be vocalizing during encounters with males when animals are intact and freely behaving. To further complicate our ability to identify the source of a vocalization, these signals are similar across individuals, both within and between sexes (<a href=\"#bib31\">Hammerschmidt et al., 2012a</a>). These complications require a technological advance to unmask the vocal contribution of each individual mouse."

The system has three components: (1) estimating the likelihood that the vocalization was produced at any position in the cage, (2) automatically determining the spatial position of every mouse in the cage at the time of the vocalization, and (3) combining the positional information of the mice and sound source estimate to assign a vocalization to a specific mouse. First, we show that the system precisely and accurately assigns vocalization to mice. After determining the resolution of the system, we investigated the vocal behavior of groups of male and female mice during courtship. Using the array, we revealed that both sexes vocalize, contrary to the belief that courtship vocalizations are male-specific. Furthermore, we discovered a temporal correlation between male and female vocalizations. Vocal interactions were observed between all possible male-female pairs in the colony. Moreover, these vocal exchanges were predominantly detected during chases. Finally, females that vocally interacted with pursuing males had lower chase speeds than silent females, suggesting a role for these exchanges in communicating female receptivity."

To control for this behavioral phenomenon, we ran a second more restrictive simulation. Instead of using 3 virtual mice at random locations within the cage, the simulation randomly generated the position of a single virtual mouse that was located within a 10 cm radius of the true source. Since vocalizations occur across a range of relative distances between two mice, this control analysis will overestimate the error rate and provide a lower bound for the accuracy. When applying our inclusion criteria, the vocal signal was assigned to the real mouse 89.5% of the time and 40.4% of the localized signals were assigned. The decreased assignment rate indicates the conservative approach we used when assigning the signals to mice.

The signal was partitioned into 8 snippets that were confined to the nose of a female mouse while the other three mice were positioned in remote locations in the cage.

To address this possibility, we examined whether any consistent differences were detected between assigned and unassigned vocalizations as a function of time or space (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). In all groups, both assigned and unassigned vocalizations occurred throughout the experiment (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Moreover, the spatial distribution was similar for assigned and unassigned vocalizations (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). The evidence from these analyses demonstrates that there is no temporal or spatial bias in vocalization assignment. We next examined the relative positions of the two mice closest to the estimated sound source. For all vocal signals, two distances were calculated: (1) the distance between the estimated sound source position and the closest mouse and (2) the distance between the estimated sound source position and the next closest mouse. These two distances were plotted in relation to each other to create two distance distribution matrices, one for assigned and one for unassigned vocal signals. Next, a difference distribution was calculated (assigned-unassigned). The results revealed that assigned vocalizations occurred predominantly when the estimated sound source is close to one mouse, whereas unassigned vocalizations occur when two mice are equidistant from the estimated sound source (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). This indicates that the major reason for excluding vocalizations was ambiguity in the source of the signal and highlights the effort taken to avoid incorrect assignments. With this system, we were able to follow the vocal and physical interactions of mice in large, mixed sex groups and precisely distinguish sex-specific contributions during social interactions."

A striking temporal correlation was revealed\u2014when male vocalizations occurred, the probability of female vocalizations peaked. Similarly, when female vocalizations occurred, the probability of male vocalizations peaked. We quantified this effect by calculating the average rate of vocalizations triggered by either sex (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D\u2013E</a>; peak male vocalization rate was 0.78 Hz; one-way ANOVA, F<sub>59,360</sub> = 2.04, p &lt; 5 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22125</sup>; peak female vocalization rate was 0.19 Hz; one-way ANOVA, F<sub>59,360</sub> = 5.2, p &lt; 10<sup>\u221222</sup>).

Overall, we found that 24% of male vocalizations occurred within 1 s of a female vocalization, while 61% of female vocalizations occurred within 1 s of a male vocalization.

This pattern was called a <i>vocal sequence</i> and the vocalizing male and female were called the <i>vocal pair</i>. Because four mice were present in the cage, the other mice were called the <i>non-vocal pair</i>. For each pair, we measured the speed and distance between the male and female during a 60 s window centered on vocal sequence onset (see <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a> for example trajectories). The speed of the vocal pair was significantly faster at the time of the vocal sequence than either before or after the event (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>; before: 1\u201330 s, after: 2\u201330 s; one-way ANOVA, F<sub>1740,10,446</sub> = 11.9, p &lt; 10<sup>\u22126</sup>). Despite a slight peak, the speed of the non-vocal pair did not change significantly over time (one-way ANOVA, F<sub>1740,10,446</sub> = 1.0, p &gt; 0.9). We believe this peak occurs because all four mice are in the same cage, and therefore the behavior of the vocal pair may affect the behavior of the non-vocal pair. Moreover, the members of a vocal pair were significantly closer to each other at the onset of the vocal sequence than either before or after the event (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>; before: 30\u20133.2 s, after: 5\u201330 s; one-way ANOVA, F<sub>1740,10,446</sub> = 15.5, p &lt; 10<sup>\u22126</sup>). In contrast, the distance between non-vocal mice did not change significantly over time (one-way ANOVA, F<sub>1740,10,446</sub> = 0.4, p &gt; 0.99). For the vocal pair, we examined the relative positions of the mice before, during, and after the vocal sequence (\u221225, 0, and 25 s, respectively).

(2013)</a>; see Materials and methods). In every cage, each male chased each female (median = 113; interquartile range (IQR) = 162.5\u201335). In addition, each male vocally interacted with each female (median = 111; IQR = 166\u201377.5). The relationship between chases and vocal interactions was then examined for all male and female pairs (n = 28; <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). The proportion of chases performed by each male varied across groups. In some cases, only one of the males did the majority of the chasing (e.g., group 4, red symbols). In other cases, both males chased equally (e.g., group 6, pink symbols). Similarly, the amount each of the females was chased varied. Most of the time, one of the females in the group was chased more than the other (e.g., groups 1, 3, 4, 6, and 7; black, green, red, pink, and cyan symbols). In contrast, females in groups 2 and 5 were chased for similar amounts of time (blue and gray symbols). Despite this variation, the number of male-initiated vocal interactions was strongly correlated with both total chase time (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>, r = 0.74, p &lt; 10<sup>\u22125</sup>) and number of chases (r = 0.55, p &lt; 0.003). Given this correlation we asked whether there was a consistent temporal relationship between vocal interactions and chases. Vocal interactions that occurred within 30 s of a chase (1743/3075) were plotted in relation to the onset of the nearest chase (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). The rate of vocal interactions occurring inside a chase was significantly higher than outside the chase (inside: median = 0.18 Hz, IQR = 0.61\u20130; outside: median = 0.02 Hz, IQR = 0.04\u20130; Mann\u2013Whitney U-test, z = 9.74, p &lt; 10<sup>\u221221</sup>), with 47.2% of these vocal interactions occurring during a chase (823/1743). Analyses of female-initiated vocal interactions showed a similar pattern (total chase time\u2013vocal interaction correlation: n = 28; r = 0.80, p &lt; 10<sup>\u22126</sup>; vocal interaction and chase timing: inside: median = 0.16, IQR = 0.50\u20130; outside: median = 0.02, IQR = 0.02\u20130; Mann\u2013Whitney U-test, z = 9.77, p &lt; 10<sup>\u221221</sup>). Our observation that the vocal interaction rate increased during chases suggests that both males and females actively participate in courtship displays."

Therefore, a possibility exists that the female's vocal contribution to the interaction was actually a male vocalization incorrectly assigned to a female. To control for this possibility, we used the data from the single mouse recordings and simulated a close proximity social interaction by randomly generating a second virtual mouse. To determine the possible positions of the virtual mouse that reflected the relative positions of vocally interacting mice in the multiple mouse experiment, we calculated the distance between each vocally interacting male and female at the time of the female vocalization as well as the orientation of the female relative to the male. The distance and orientation distributions were then sampled with replacement to generate the position of the virtual mouse relative to the real mouse in the single mouse experiments. In this control simulation, vocal signals were assigned to the real mouse 93.0% of the time, which indicates a 7% error rate."

In the 1743 vocal interactions that occurred within 30 s of a chase, there were a total of 3486 vocalizations emitted. If male mice were the only animals vocalizing and all female vocalizations were incorrectly assigned based on a 7% error rate, we would have only expected a total of 244 female vocalizations. Instead, 1743 vocalizations were assigned to the female, which is greater than 7 times the number of expected incorrectly assigned male vocalizations. This analysis not only suggests that female mice vocalize in the presence of males, but moreover, they are vocally interacting with the males during courtship."

To isolate the effect of the female vocalization, we compared chases in which both the male and female vocalized (vocal interaction chases) with those in which only the male vocalized (male only chases). We used speed at the time of the male vocalization as a proxy for female receptivity (<a href=\"#bib45\">Kowalski et al., 2004</a>). When examining the speed of the males, we found no difference between the two chase types (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>, top panel; vocal interaction: median = 28 cm/s, IQR = 0.45\u20130.17; non-vocal interaction: median = 31 cm/s, IQR = 0.45\u20130.20; Mann\u2013Whitney U-test, z = 1.13, p &gt; 0.25). In contrast, female speed was significantly slower during chases with vocal interactions than without vocal interactions (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>, bottom panel; vocal interaction: median = 28 cm/s, IQR = 0.49\u20130.12; non-vocal interaction: median = 51 cm/s, IQR = 0.73\u20130.32; Mann\u2013Whitney U-test, z = 6.73, p &lt; 10<sup>\u221210</sup>). In addition, vocal interaction chases were on average longer in duration than non-vocal interaction chases (vocal interaction: median = 3.28 s, IQR = 5.02\u20132.07; non-vocal interaction: median = 2.38 s, IQR = 3.72\u20131.22; Mann\u2013Whitney U-test, z = 4.45, p &lt; 10<sup>\u22125</sup>). Our results show that the female drives the overall reduction in speed during a chase; thus, female vocal interaction may function as a signal of receptivity."

In all of these social contexts, the presence of multiple vocalizing mice has hindered our ability to determine the specific role vocalizations play in social behaviors. Assigning a vocalization to a particular mouse in a social group is difficult for two reasons. First, there is no obvious visual sign that a mouse is producing a USV (<a href=\"#bib15\">Chabout et al., 2012</a>). Second, although mice appear to produce characteristic vocal patterns or songs (<a href=\"#bib36\">Holy and Guo, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Sugimoto et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Hoffmann et al., 2012</a>), individual ultrasonic vocalizations are similar across animals, both within and between sexes (<a href=\"#bib31\">Hammerschmidt et al., 2012a</a>). Therefore, a vocalization's acoustic features are likely inadequate for identifying which mouse in a social group emitted the sound. Previous studies have addressed the difficulty in determining the source by assuming a single mouse produced the majority of the observed vocalizations (<a href=\"#bib4\">Barthelemy et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Choi et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Hanson and Hurley, 2012</a>), or by experimentally preventing one mouse from vocalizing (<a href=\"#bib86\">Whitney et al., 1973</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Warburton et al., 1989</a>). Both conditions overlook how social interactions may be impacted by the vocal contribution of multiple individuals. More importantly, these conditions cannot detect vocal exchanges between individuals. Consequently, the ability to track the vocal behavior of each animal is crucial in determining the function of mouse USVs. To examine the vocal contribution of every mouse during a social interaction, we developed and employed a microphone array system. In the past, microphone arrays have been used to study the acoustic features of many species (<a href=\"#bib63\">Payne et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Mennill et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Chiu et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Collier et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Kalcounis-Rueppell et al., 2010</a>). Other systems capitalized on the power of an array to determine the number of animals hidden in dense terrain (<a href=\"#bib14\">Celis-Murillo et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Blumstein et al., 2011</a>) or map the boundaries of an animal\u2019s territory (<a href=\"#bib43\">Kirschel et al., 2011</a>), whereas our system was specifically designed to link, with high resolution and accuracy, the vocal and social behaviors of mice recorded in a laboratory environment."

Moreover, recent work has shown that mouse vocal behavior (<a href=\"#bib67\">Portfors, 2007</a>) and patterns of social interactions (<a href=\"#bib74\">Shemesh et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib84\">Weissbrod et al., 2013</a>) are significantly different when mice are housed in more complex social groups than in dyads. These studies emphasize the importance of capturing the full behavioral repertoire. In the present study using a more dynamic social environment of two males and two females, we show that all mice vocalize and vocal exchanges occur between all possible male-female pairs. These findings illustrate the utility of the microphone array for clarifying the function of vocalizations in mouse social behavior."

These results are surprising because most previous studies concluded that only male mice produce courtship USVs (<a href=\"#bib86\">Whitney et al., 1973</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Warburton et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Barthelemy et al., 2004</a>). However, male and female mice emit USVs with practically identical acoustic structure (<a href=\"#bib31\">Hammerschmidt et al., 2012a</a>), leaving open the possibility that some courtship USVs attributed to males are actually produced by females. Moreover, it is known that female mice possess the neural circuitry necessary to emit USVs during interactions with males because surgical or genetic lesions to the vomeronasal organ unmask this behavior (<a href=\"#bib42\">Kimchi et al., 2007</a>). Our findings expand on this observation and show that the behavior can be triggered in unaltered females. Our observation that the majority of a female's vocalizations occur during vocal exchanges with males suggests that female vocal behavior may depend on the presence of a vocally competent partner. This in turn, may explain the absence of ultrasonic vocalizations when female mice are exposed to male odor (<a href=\"#bib47\">Maggio and Whitney, 1985</a>) or paired with an anesthetized (<a href=\"#bib86\">Whitney et al., 1973</a>) or devocalized (<a href=\"#bib83\">Warburton et al., 1989</a>) male. Taken together, these results suggest that information from multiple modalities is necessary to activate these social neural networks."

Female responsiveness modulates male mating behavior throughout the animal kingdom (<a href=\"#bib20\">Coleman et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Higham et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Akre and Ryan, 2011</a>). For example, in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, males modulate their song patterning in response to variation in sensory cues about the female's position and motion (<a href=\"#bib19\">Coen et al., 2014</a>). Without accounting for the behavior of the female, the male's song pattern appears random. A similar interdependence of behavior between partners occurs in the early stages of human courtship, where a female's non-verbal displays modulate a male's approach behavior (<a href=\"#bib55\">Moore, 1985</a>). Interactions between males and females during courtship also occur in the vocal domain (<a href=\"#bib37\">Janson, 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Tobias et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Garamszegi et al., 2007</a>). Most studies have found that vocal behavior is either important for joint territorial defense or maintaining affiliation, particularly between mated pairs (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hall, 2004</a>). The association between vocal interactions and courtship chases in this study implies that vocal exchanges between mice may be involved in affiliation. As for the role of female vocalizations in courtship, many believe a female's participation may serve as an indication of her receptivity (<a href=\"#bib37\">Janson, 1984</a>) or may encourage competition between males (<a href=\"#bib54\">Montgomerie and Thornhill, 1989</a>). In rats (<a href=\"#bib80\">Thomas and Barfield, 1985</a>) and hamsters (<a href=\"#bib25\">Floody et al., 1977</a>), female vocal participation in courtship is modulated by estrous state and has been proposed to signal female receptivity to nearby males, also consistent with a role in affiliation. Our results strengthen the argument that female vocalizations are associated with receptivity in rodents, since female speed during a chase is significantly slower when she subsequently vocalized than when she was silent. This is akin to other species; receptive females slow down permitting the courting male to approach and mate (<a href=\"#bib49\">McGill, 1962</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Beach, 1976</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Hall, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Kowalski et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Szykman et al., 2007</a>). Based on the behaviors of the animals that co-occur during these vocal exchanges, we believe that the female's vocal contribution may facilitate this bond by indicating her receptivity."

These interactions are supported by information exchange through a variety of sensory modalities (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adolphs, 2010</a>). Transfer of social information occurs over a wide range of timescales, from short-term information about an individual's current motivational state (<a href=\"#bib53\">Moles and D'Amato F, 2000</a>) to longer-term information about dominance status (<a href=\"#bib23\">Ficken et al., 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Grosenick et al., 2007</a>) or fertility (<a href=\"#bib46\">Leong et al., 2003</a>). Capturing the details of this information exchange is critical to developing a mechanistic understanding of how social information supports motivated behavior, and also in illuminating deficits of social interaction, such as autism. The microphone array system described here allows unprecedented access to the details of social interactions in groups of freely behaving mice, revealing temporally precise and behaviorally meaningful vocal communication between males and females."

After removing signals below 30 kHz, overlapping segments in time were Fourier transformed using multiple discrete prolate spheroidal sequences as windowing functions (K = 43, NW = 22). An F-test (<a href=\"#bib88\">Percival and Waldan, 1993</a>) was used to infer whether each time-frequency point was significantly above noise based on these independent estimates of intensity (p &lt; 0.05). This procedure was performed for multiple segment lengths on each microphone channel to capture data at different temporal and spectral scales (NFFTs = 128, 256, 512). The data were combined in a single spectrogram whose pixel size corresponded to the time resolution of the shortest segment and frequency resolution of the longest. This image was then convolved with a square box (15 pixels in time X 7 pixels in frequency) to fill in small gaps before the locations of contiguous regions, which exceeded a minimum pixel number (1500), were characterized. Because one or more animals could produce discontinuous vocal signals, each discontinuous signal was extracted separately unless harmonics were present. Overlapping signals were considered harmonics when the overlapped length exceeded 90% of the shortest signal, and the frequencies of 90% or more of the overlap were within 10% of a factor of two or three of each other."

The preprocessing steps involved cutting each extracted signal into time-frequency \u2018snippets\u2019\u2014filtered pieces of the signal 5 ms long and 2 kHz wide. Because video data were collected at 29 Hz (roughly 35 ms), each frame was associated with 7 time bins of audio data. Each of time bins used the same mouse position, making the localization sampling rate dependent upon the video sampling rate, as opposed to a per snippet sampling rate of 200 Hz. To determine the optimal duration of snippets, localization error as a function of snippet duration was plotted (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). Localization error increased dramatically for snippet durations under approximately 4 ms. Consequently, we selected 5 ms for snippet durations to improve the accuracy of the system. To select a frequency bandwidth, we examined \u2018hot pixels\u2019\u2014pixels in the combined spectrogram that pass the multi-taper F-test for being significantly louder than noise. <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a> shows that localization error exponentially decays as the numbers of hot pixels within a snippet increases. After applying a cutoff criterion of 11 hot pixels, a bandwidth of 2 kHz was selected because it produced more than three snippets for most vocalizations. Therefore, localization was restricted to snippets that were 5 ms long and contained at least 11 hot pixels. This allowed us to use multiple estimates to determine the source location. Cage boundaries and microphone positions were manually annotated using the images from the video recordings."

The shuffle-dependent male vocalization rate for each group was then averaged to produce a mean shuffle-dependent vocalization rate. The random permutation process was repeated 1000 times to generate a distribution of average shuffle-dependent vocalization rates, which were used to determine the probability that the male vocalization rate was higher than expected by chance. For each of the 60 bins, the number of times that the actual data were above the shuffled data was calculated. These proportions were used with a binomial parameter estimate to determine significance. The actual data were considered significant at a conservative alpha &lt;0.006 if at most one of the average shuffle-dependent vocalization rates was greater than the average from the actual data."

The classifier was trained on 5228 frames of video (2341 positive examples and 2887 negative examples), using the mouse position data extracted by Motr. A subset of non-training frames (4040) was manually scored and compared to the output of the classifier to determine the accuracy of the system. The chase classifier had a false negative rate of 2.7% and a false positive rate of 7.5%. To determine which of the two males was following the identified female, we used a set of heuristics. First, the trajectories of the potential male participant had to overlap with that of the chased female by at least 20%. Second, the distance between the two mice at the start of the chase had to be within 20 cm. Consecutive chases involving the same participants were merged when the two events were separated by \u223c0.3 s or less. All chases needed to exceed \u223c0.17 s."

When mice are moving quickly, this will have the effect of introducing a difference between the video estimate of mouse position and the snippet-based estimate.

There are two reasons we believe that this is not a contradictory result and we have attempted to emphasize these two points more clearly in the text: First, because previous researchers have shown that female mice can produce high rates of vocalizations when paired with other females (Sales, 1972; <a href=\"#bib47\">Maggio and Whitney, 1985</a>), and because the acoustic structure of female vocalizations has been shown to be similar to that of males (Hammerschmidt et al., 2012), it has not previously been possible to determine what fraction (if any) of the vocalizations emitted during male-female interactions were produced by the female. And, secondly, rather than female vocalizations being produced independently of male vocalizations (albeit at a lower rate), female vocalization timing is coordinated with that of males (as shown in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5 and 6</a>)."

We have added a statement to that effect to the Methods section. We definitely agree that the exact temporal relationship between calls is a fascinating one, which we plan to address in a future manuscript, but we believe that the system needs additional improvements in assignment percentage before a more precise temporal analysis is appropriate. We plan to improve the system in future by doubling the number of microphones (from 4 to 8) and experimenting with different arena shapes (notably, a circle, which should lack the \u2018dead\u2019 spots in the current square arena). In addition, we plan to explore the suggestion of Reviewer 1, of adapting snippet frequency bandwidth to the local structure of the vocalization to see if that can also improve accuracy and resolution."
