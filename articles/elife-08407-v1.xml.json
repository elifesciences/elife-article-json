In <i>Drosophila</i>, commissural axons avoid premature responsiveness to the midline repellant Slit by expressing the endosomal sorting receptor Commissureless, which reduces surface expression of the Slit receptor Roundabout1 (Robo1). In this study, we describe a distinct mechanism to inhibit Robo1 repulsion and promote midline crossing, in which Roundabout2 (Robo2) binds to and prevents Robo1 signaling. Unexpectedly, we find that Robo2 is expressed in midline cells during the early stages of commissural axon guidance, and that over-expression of Robo2 can rescue <i>robo2</i>-dependent midline crossing defects non-cell autonomously. We show that the extracellular domains required for binding to Robo1 are also required for Robo2's ability to promote midline crossing, in both gain-of-function and rescue assays. These findings indicate that at least two independent mechanisms to overcome Slit-Robo1 repulsion in pre-crossing commissural axons have evolved in <i>Drosophila</i>."

In <i>Drosophila</i>, commissural axons avoid premature responsiveness to the midline repellant Slit by expressing the endosomal sorting receptor Commissureless, which reduces surface expression of the Slit receptor Roundabout1 (Robo1). In this study, we describe a distinct mechanism to inhibit Robo1 repulsion and promote midline crossing, in which Roundabout2 (Robo2) binds to and prevents Robo1 signaling. Unexpectedly, we find that Robo2 is expressed in midline cells during the early stages of commissural axon guidance, and that over-expression of Robo2 can rescue <i>robo2</i>-dependent midline crossing defects non-cell autonomously. We show that the extracellular domains required for binding to Robo1 are also required for Robo2's ability to promote midline crossing, in both gain-of-function and rescue assays. These findings indicate that at least two independent mechanisms to overcome Slit-Robo1 repulsion in pre-crossing commissural axons have evolved in <i>Drosophila</i>."

Based on previous studies, it was not clear how Robo2 could have such opposing effects on different sets of nerve cells."

Instead, the Robo2 receptor instructs other Robo1-producing nerve cells to cross the midline. These findings reconcile the previous, seemingly paradoxical, observations about the activity of Robo2."

Slits are normally expressed at the midline of the central nervous system (CNS), and axons expressing Robo receptors are thus repelled from the midline (<a href=\"#bib3\">Battye et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Brose et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Kidd et al., 1999</a>). Prior to crossing the midline, commissural neurons in vertebrates and insects prevent premature responsiveness to Slit by regulating the expression and activity of Robo receptors through a variety of mechanisms (<a href=\"#bib9\">Evans and Bashaw, 2010a</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Neuhaus-Follini and Bashaw, 2015</a>). For example, the divergent Robo receptor Robo3/Rig-1 in vertebrates negatively regulates the activity of the Robo1 (Roundabout1) and Robo2 (Roundabout2) receptors in pre-crossing commissural axons in the spinal cord, thereby allowing midline crossing (<a href=\"#bib36\">Sabatier et al., 2004</a>). In <i>Drosophila</i>, Commissureless (Comm) antagonizes Slit-Robo1 repulsion by preventing the trafficking of the Robo1 receptor to the growth cone, instead diverting newly synthesized Robo1 into the endocytic pathway (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kidd et al., 1998b</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Keleman et al., 2002</a>, <a href=\"#bib20\">2005</a>). As commissural axons approach the midline, Comm expression is high, allowing axons to cross the midline (<a href=\"#bib19\">Keleman et al., 2002</a>). Once the midline is reached, Comm is down regulated, restoring Robo1-dependent Slit sensitivity and ensuring that commissural axons do not re-cross the midline. Accordingly, loss of Robos or Slits can cause axons to ectopically cross the midline, while loss of Comm or Robo3/Rig1 prevents commissural axons from crossing (<a href=\"#bib41\">Tear et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Kidd et al., 1998a</a>, <a href=\"#bib21\">1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Long et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Sabatier et al., 2004</a>)."

Although Robo2 contributes to promoting midline repulsion, gain-of-function genetic experiments suggest that in some contexts Robo2 can also promote midline crossing (<a href=\"#bib35\">Rajagopalan et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Simpson et al., 2000b</a>). More recently, endogenous roles for <i>robo2</i> in promoting midline crossing were identified during the guidance of foreleg gustatory neurons in the adult, as well as during the guidance of interneurons in the embryonic CNS (<a href=\"#bib30\">Mellert et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Spitzweck et al., 2010</a>). Robo2's pro-crossing role in the embryo is highlighted in <i>frazzled</i> and <i>Netrin</i> mutant backgrounds, in which midline attraction is partially compromised (<a href=\"#bib40\">Spitzweck et al., 2010</a>). In the absence of Netrin-dependent midline axon attraction, loss of <i>robo2</i> (but not <i>robo1</i> or <i>robo3</i>) leads to a dramatic disruption in midline crossing that is far more severe than the complete loss of Netrins, indicating that <i>robo2</i> likely acts in parallel to Netrin-Fra to promote midline crossing (<a href=\"#bib40\">Spitzweck et al., 2010</a>)."

Consistent with these observations, replacing endogenous Robo2 by homologous recombination with chimeric receptors, in which the cytoplasmic domains of the Robo1 and Robo2 receptors were exchanged, reveals that the Robo2-1 chimeric receptor (containing the extracellular region of the Robo2 receptor) can rescue the commissural guidance defect observed in <i>Netrin</i>, <i>robo2</i> mutants more effectively than the reciprocal chimeric receptor (<a href=\"#bib40\">Spitzweck et al., 2010</a>). However, the mechanism by which Robo2 promotes midline crossing remains unclear. We can envision two alternative models that could account for Robo2's role in promoting midline crossing of commissural axons. First, Robo2 may act as an attractive receptor to signal midline attraction in response to a ligand produced by midline glia, analogous to Frazzled/Deleted in Colorectal Cancer (DCC)'s role in Netrin-dependent midline attraction. Indeed, a role for Robo2 in mediating attractive responses to Slit has been described in the context of muscle cell migration (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kramer et al., 2001</a>). Alternatively, Robo2 may antagonize Slit-Robo1 repulsion by preventing Robo1 from signaling in response to midline-derived Slit, similar to the proposed role of Robo3/Rig-1 in pre-crossing commissural axons in the vertebrate spinal cord (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Although Comm is an essential regulator of Robo1 activity in <i>Drosophila</i>, low levels of Robo1 escape Comm-dependent sorting and can be detected on commissural axons, raising the question of whether and how the activity of these Robo1 receptors is regulated (<a href=\"#bib22\">Kidd et al., 1998a</a>)."

Moreover, Robo2 can bind to Robo1 in <i>Drosophila</i> embryonic neurons, and this biochemical interaction, like Robo2's pro-crossing role, correlates with the presence of Ig1 and Ig2. Surprisingly, we observe that Robo2 is able to promote midline crossing of axons non-cell autonomously when mis-expressed in midline cells, and we further show that Robo2 is expressed in midline glia and neurons during the early stages of commissure formation. Finally, we find that restoring Robo2 expression in midline cells can rescue midline crossing of axons in <i>robo2, fra</i> double mutants and that this rescue activity is dependent on Ig1 and Ig2. Together, our results indicate that Robo2 acts non-autonomously to bind to Robo1 and prevent Slit-Robo1 repulsion in pre-crossing commissural axons.

In <i>robo2</i>, <i>fra</i> double mutants, midline crossing of commissural axons is severely compromised, leading to thin or absent commissures, a phenotype that is qualitatively and quantitatively more severe than loss of <i>fra</i> alone (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>).

To test whether the Robo2 cytoplasmic domain contributes to its pro-crossing activity, we tested whether a truncated Robo2 receptor lacking its cytoplasmic domain (Robo2\u2206C) could promote midline crossing when mis-expressed in embryonic neurons. We found that, as with full-length Robo2, pan-neural mis-expression of Robo2\u2206C (with <i>elav-GAL4</i>) produced strong ectopic crossing of FasII-positive axons in the embryonic CNS (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). Indeed, the Robo2\u2206C mis-expression phenotype was stronger than full-length Robo2. In contrast, pan-neural over-expression of Robo1 did not generate ectopic crossing (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). In these experiments, all UAS-Robo transgenes are expressed from the same genomic insertion site in order to ensure that they are expressed at similar levels. Importantly, the pro-crossing activity of Robo2\u2206C is unlikely to be caused solely by a dominant-negative effect of the truncated receptor, as a similarly truncated form of Robo1 (Robo1\u2206C) has a qualitatively weaker ectopic crossing phenotype when combined with <i>elav-GAL4</i> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). Robo2\u2206C expression, unlike Robo1\u2206C, leads to ectopic crossing of all of the ipsilateral FasII axon bundles and also results in many segments exhibiting a <i>slit</i>-like phenotype (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). Due to the strong phenotypic effects of the targeted insertion lines of Robo1\u2206C and Robo2\u2206C, we also compared the phenotypes generated by lower levels of expression of the two truncated receptors using standard UAS inserts and observed that Robo2\u2206C is significantly more potent at driving ectopic midline crossing than comparable levels of the Robo1\u2206C receptor (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>).

To test whether Robo2's pro-crossing activity depends on its ability to bind Slit, we deleted the canonical Slit-binding domain (the first immunoglobulin-like domain: Ig1) from Robo2. As predicted by previous in vitro binding studies using <i>Drosophila</i> Robo1 (<a href=\"#bib4\">Brose et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Fukuhara et al., 2008</a>), we found that deleting Ig1 from Robo2 prevented Slit binding in cultured <i>Drosophila</i> cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Pan-neural over-expression of Robo2 produces a phenotype in which some axons are repelled from the midline, and some axons ectopically cross the midline, reflecting Robo2's two opposing activities in regulating midline crossing. As expected, deleting the Ig1 domain prevents Robo2 from signaling midline repulsion in vivo, both broadly in all neurons (when expressed pan-neurally with <i>elav-GAL4</i>) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>) and in a subset of commissural neurons (the EW neurons, labeled by <i>eg-GAL4</i>) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>), confirming that Slit binding is required for Robo2-mediated repulsion. In contrast, we found that the Robo2 receptor lacking Ig1 retained a partial ability to promote ectopic midline crossing of FasII-positive axons, indicating that the pro-crossing activity of Robo2 does not strictly depend on its ability to bind Slit (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). Notably, the ectopic crossing phenotype produced by Robo2\u2206Ig1 mis-expression was significantly weaker than that caused by mis-expression of full-length Robo2 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). This result suggests that the Ig1 domain contributes to, but is not strictly required for, promotion of midline crossing by Robo2."

Further, replacing Ig1\u2013Ig2 of Robo2 with Robo1 Ig1\u2013Ig2 (Robo2<sup>R1Ig1+2</sup>) abolishes its pro-crossing activity (<a href=\"#bib10\">Evans and Bashaw, 2010b</a>). To directly test whether Ig2 is necessary for Robo2 to promote midline crossing, we generated a Robo2 receptor lacking Ig2 but with all other Ig domains intact (Robo2\u2206Ig2). We found that deleting Robo2's Ig2 domain did not interfere with Slit binding (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>), nor did it affect Robo2's ability to signal repulsion in commissural neurons (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). However, deletion of Robo2's Ig2 domain strongly disrupted its ability to promote ectopic midline crossing (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). The low level of ectopic crossing induced by Robo2\u2206Ig2 was indistinguishable from that caused by Robo3, a related receptor that does not share Robo2's pro-midline crossing activity (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). These results contrast with those observed with Robo2\u2206Ig1, which lacks Slit-dependent midline repulsive activity but retains some pro-midline crossing activity (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4, 5</a>). These data indicate that Robo2's Ig2 domain is essential for promoting midline crossing when Robo2 is mis-expressed in all neurons. In these experiments, all UAS-Robo transgenes are expressed from the same genomic insertion site in order to ensure that they are expressed at similar levels. In addition, we assayed the protein localization and expression levels of Robo2 and its deletion variants and observed comparable surface expression in cultured S2R+ cells in vitro, as well as comparable expression levels and localization in CNS axons in vivo (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

Indeed, <i>elav-GAL4</i> is transiently expressed in midline glia as well as post-mitotic neurons, preventing us from ruling out a non-neuronal contribution to the observed mis-expression phenotypes. Notably, we have never observed a clearly cell-autonomous pro-crossing phenotype caused by Robo2. We have previously described a series of experiments in which we mis-expressed full-length, truncated, or chimeric receptor variants of Robo1 and Robo2 in a subset of ipsilateral neurons (the apterous neurons, labeled by <i>ap-GAL4</i>) (<a href=\"#bib10\">Evans and Bashaw, 2010b</a>).

We note that <i>Hb9-GAL4</i> expression initiates earlier than <i>ap-GAL4</i> and includes a larger number of neurons, including some located near the CNS midline (such as the RP motor neurons), suggesting the possibility that early midline-proximal expression of Robo2 accounts for the non-autonomous effect observed with <i>Hb9-GAL4.</i>"

We found that mis-expression of Robo2 or Robo2\u2206C in midline cells caused many FasII-positive axons which do not express <i>slit-GAL4</i> to ectopically cross the midline, confirming that Robo2 can act non-autonomously to promote midline crossing of axons, and that this effect does not depend on the cytoplasmic domain (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). We observed a significantly milder effect with mis-expression of Robo1, suggesting that Robo2's non-cell autonomous activity is not solely a consequence of Slit titration (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). Moreover, this non-cell autonomous activity of Robo2 appears to be Ig1/Ig2-dependent, as Robo1<sup>R2Ig1+2</sup> but not Robo2<sup>R1Ig1+2</sup> promoted strong ectopic midline crossing when expressed using <i>slit-GAL4</i> (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). In addition, expression of Robo2 variants missing either Ig1 or Ig2 with <i>slit-Gal4</i> did not result in any ectopic midline crossing (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). The requirement for both Ig1 and Ig2 in this context contrasts with our findings with pan-neural mis-expression, in which Robo2\u2206Ig1 retained some pro-crossing activity. However, it is worth noting that the phenotype generated by <i>elav-GAL4</i> mis-expression of Robo2 is stronger than that generated by <i>slit-GAL4</i>, perhaps because <i>slit-GAL4</i> is expressed in a much smaller number of cells."

During embryogenesis, <i>robo2</i> expression is dynamically regulated: it is broadly expressed in neurons during early stages of CNS development, including transient expression in a number of ipsilateral pioneer neurons, and later becomes restricted to neurons whose axons form longitudinal pathways in the lateral regions of the neuropile (<a href=\"#bib38\">Simpson et al., 2000a</a>). To gain additional insight into Robo2's role in promoting midline crossing of commissural neurons, we examined <i>robo2</i> mRNA and protein expression in embryos during the early stages of axon path finding, when the first commissural axons are crossing the midline (stages 12\u201313). Using fluorescent mRNA in situ hybridization, we were able to detect <i>robo2</i> mRNA expression in cells labeled by <i>slit-GAL4</i> in late stage 12 embryos, around the time that pioneer commissural axons are crossing the midline (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>). <i>robo2</i> mRNA expression persists through the end of stage 13, but is no longer detectable by stage 14; thus, midline expression of <i>robo2</i> coincides with the time when most commissural axons are crossing the midline (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>, <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

Expression of <i>UAS-HARobo2</i> with <i>robo2-Gal4</i> and detection of transgenic Robo2 with anti-HA reveals an expression pattern that closely resembles the endogenous pattern of Robo2 protein, suggesting that the <i>robo2-GAL4</i> faithfully reports Robo2 expression (data not shown). In addition, we could detect weak expression of Robo2 protein produced by an HA-tagged knock-in allele of <i>robo2</i> (<a href=\"#bib40\">Spitzweck et al., 2010</a>) in a subset of <i>slit-GAL4</i> expressing cells at stage 12, confirming that Robo2 protein is produced in midline cells during the stages of commissural axon path finding, and raising the possibility that Robo2 endogenously acts in these cells to promote midline crossing of commissural axons (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>)."

To address this question, we attempted to rescue <i>robo2</i>'s endogenous pro-crossing activity by restoring <i>robo2</i> expression in restricted subsets of cells in <i>robo2, fra</i> double mutants. We first expressed Robo2 in the commissural EW neurons (using <i>eg-GAL4</i>) in <i>robo2, fra</i> double mutants.

Does Robo2 antagonize Slit-Robo1 repulsion through another mechanism? In order to test this hypothesis, we took advantage of <i>comm</i> mutants, which provide a genetic background in which hyperactive Slit-Robo1 signaling completely prevents midline crossing. In <i>comm</i> mutants, endogenous Robo1 is inappropriately trafficked to the growth cone plasma membrane in pre-crossing commissural axons, triggering premature Slit repulsion and preventing commissure formation. We reasoned that if Robo2 antagonizes Slit-Robo1 repulsion, then Robo2 mis-expression might restore midline crossing in <i>comm</i> mutant embryos. Indeed, pan-neural mis-expression of Robo2 with <i>elav-GAL4</i> significantly restored commissure formation in <i>comm</i> mutant embryos (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>). To specifically test the Ig1/Ig2-dependence of Robo2's pro-crossing activity in this assay, we mis-expressed our Ig1+2 chimeric receptors (Robo1<sup>R2Ig1+2</sup> and Robo2<sup>R1Ig1+2</sup>) with <i>elav-GAL4</i> in <i>comm</i> mutant embryos. We found that pan-neural mis-expression of Robo1<sup>R2Ig1+2</sup> in <i>comm</i> mutant embryos strongly suppressed the commissureless phenotype and restored midline crossing of many axons, as assayed by anti-HRP antibody staining, while mis-expression of Robo2<sup>R1Ig1+2</sup> had a much milder effect (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>).

One possibility is that Robo2 may form an inhibitory receptor\u2013receptor complex with Robo1 to prevent it from signaling midline repulsion in response to Slit. If this is the case, we reasoned that we might be able to detect a physical interaction between Robo2 and Robo1 in embryonic protein extracts. To test this idea, we mis-expressed epitope-tagged forms of Robo1 and Robo2 in <i>Drosophila</i> embryonic neurons with <i>elav-GAL4</i> and looked for physical interactions by co-immunoprecipitation (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11</a>). We found that Robo1-myc and HA-Robo2 co-immunoprecipitated from embryonic lysates when both were expressed in embryonic neurons (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11A</a>). Interactions were also observed between Robo1 and the closely related Robo3 receptor but not with a similarly tagged and structurally related Fra receptor (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11A</a>). As we would predict from our gain of function experiments, Robo2's ability to bind to Robo1 is independent of its cytoplasmic domain (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11</a>, <a href=\"#fig11s1\">Figure 11\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Importantly, Robo2's ability to bind Robo1 depends on the Ig1\u2013Ig2 region of Robo2, as Robo1<sup>R2Ig1+2</sup> was readily co-immunoprecipitated with Robo1, while binding between Robo1 and the reciprocal receptor Robo2<sup>R1Ig1+2</sup> was only weakly detected (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11B</a>). Consistently, deleting both of the Ig1 and Ig2 domains from Robo2 results in a diminished interaction with Robo1 in vivo and in vitro (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11</a>, <a href=\"#fig11s1\">Figure 11\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The fact that not all binding is eliminated when both Ig1 and Ig2 are deleted suggests that other regions of the Robo2 receptor may contribute to the interaction with Robo1. Thus, we see a correlation between the presence of the Ig1 and Ig2 domains, a biochemical interaction with Robo1, and pro-crossing activity in the Robo2 receptor. These observations suggest that Robo2 may promote midline crossing through inhibitory interactions with Robo1, likely mediated at least in part by the Robo2 Ig1 and Ig2 domain. Of note, the Ig2 domain is essential for Robo2's pro-crossing activity but is not required for the interaction with Robo1 or Slit, suggesting the existence of an Ig2-specific activity that is distinct from the ability to bind Robo1 or Slit. One possible mechanism that could explain how receptor\u2013receptor interactions could prevent Robo1 signaling is through blocking the access of Slit to the Ig1 region of Robo1. Deleting Robo1's Ig1 domain does not significantly attenuate the interaction with Robo2, but further experiments will be necessary to determine if Robo2 interferes with Robo1's interaction with Slit (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11</a>, <a href=\"#fig11s1\">Figure 11\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

We tested this prediction by transfecting <i>Drosophila</i> cultured S2R+ cells with either Robo1-myc or HA-tagged Robo2 and assaying for physical interactions by co-immunoprecipitation.

Loss of function experiments point to an endogenous requirement for Robo2 in promoting midline crossing. Additional genetic analyses indicate that Robo2 can antagonize Robo1 in the absence of its cytoplasmic domain and that this inhibitory effect can be generated by non-cell autonomous expression of Robo2. These observations, together with the demonstration that Robo2 variants that promote midline crossing are potent suppressors of <i>comm</i> mutants, support the model that Robo2 inhibits Slit-Robo1 repulsion, rather than acting as a receptor that promotes midline axon attraction. Biochemical and gain of function genetic analyses show that Robo2 can bind to Robo1 in vivo through its Ig1 and Ig2 domains and that this binding interaction correlates with Robo2's pro-crossing activity. Furthermore, cell type specific rescue experiments and analysis of Robo2 mRNA and protein expression are consistent with a requirement for Robo2 in midline cells and support an endogenous requirement for Robo2's Ig2 domain in promoting midline crossing. Taken together, the data in this manuscript support the model that Robo2 expressed in cells other than commissural neurons acts to inhibit Robo1 receptor activity through extracellular domain binding interactions, and that this activity ensures the precise execution of midline guidance (<a href=\"#fig13\">Figure 13</a>). Our model reconciles two previously confounding observations: one, that a small amount of Robo1 protein is detectable on commissural axons as they cross the midline, yet this pool of Robo1 is unable to signal midline repulsion; and two, that the single known isoform of Robo2 can act to both promote and inhibit midline crossing."

This mechanism is revealed in contexts where axon attraction to the midline is limited. In ipsilateral neurons, Comm is not expressed, and Robo2 works together with Robo1 to mediate repulsion from the midline in response to Slit."

Indeed, in wild-type animals, there is no obvious requirement for Robo2's pro-crossing activity, at least not at the embryonic midline in the populations of neurons that we have assayed. A requirement for Robo2 in promoting midline crossing in otherwise wild-type animals has been described for the guidance of foreleg gustatory neurons in the adult nervous system, although it is not clear in this context if the same mechanism that we have described is at work (<a href=\"#bib30\">Mellert et al., 2010</a>). Nevertheless, a clear endogenous contribution for Robo2 at the embryonic midline can be demonstrated in conditions where attractive guidance cues, such as Netrin, are compromised. One probable explanation for the existence of this second regulatory mechanism is that it confers robustness on the essential process of midline circuit formation, and that this is important to the animal when developmental conditions are not optimal."

Low levels of Robo1 can be detected on commissural axons by immunostaining and immunoelectron microscopy (<a href=\"#bib22\">Kidd et al., 1998a</a>). Data from surface labeling experiments indicate that Comm acts on newly synthesized Robo1, and the question of how Robo1 receptors already present on the plasma membrane prior to the initiation of <i>comm</i> expression might be regulated remains unresolved (<a href=\"#bib19\">Keleman et al., 2002</a>). The role of Robo2 may thus be to negatively regulate the low levels of Robo1 that escape Comm-dependent sorting."

In particular, a recent study shows quite convincingly that Comm's role in sorting Robo1 is insufficient to explain how Robo1 activity is limited in pre-crossing commissural axons. Specifically, embryos in which the endogenous Robo1 receptor is replaced with a variant of Robo1 that is insensitive to the sorting activity of Comm by homologous recombination show no defects in midline crossing (<a href=\"#bib16\">Gilestro, 2008</a>). This observation is in marked contrast to the prediction of the sorting model, in which embryos carrying a Comm-resistant Robo1 receptor would be expected to resemble <i>comm</i> mutants. It will be of great interest to obtain an explanation for this paradoxical finding and to determine what additional targets of Comm could also regulate Slit-dependent repulsion."

Cis-inhibitory interactions, such as those that occur between the transmembrane protein Kekkon 1 and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFr) (<a href=\"#bib15\">Ghiglione et al., 2003</a>), and between ligand and receptor pairs, as in the cases of Ephs/ephrins and Notch/Delta, have been well documented (<a href=\"#bib8\">del Alamo et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Kao and Kania, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Yaron and Sprinzak, 2012</a>). While we were not able to detect trans interactions by co-immunoprecipitation or by an S2 cell aggregation assay (data not shown), our genetic data strongly suggest that Robo2 acts in trans to inhibit Robo1 signaling. A recent in vitro screen for trans interactions among <i>Drosophila</i> cell surface receptors did not report a direct interaction between Robo1 and Robo2, suggesting that if trans interactions do occur, they might be mediated by a cofactor (<a href=\"#bib47\">\u00d6kzan et al., 2013</a>). Indeed, Slit-dependent trans interactions between Robo1 and Robo2 have been proposed to play a role in the migration of sensory neurons in the <i>Drosophila</i> peripheral nervous system, although in this case Robo2 is thought to promote Slit-Robo repulsive signaling by presenting Slit to Robo receptors expressed in trans (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kraut and Zinn, 2004</a>)."

In the case of EGFr, receptor signaling is blocked because the soluble inhibitory factor Argos binds to and sequesters the EGF ligand, thereby preventing receptor activation (<a href=\"#bib25\">Klein et al., 2008</a>). The mechanism through which Robo2 regulates Robo1 is similar in that it acts cell non-autonomously and that it depends on extracellular interactions, but distinct, since Robo2 does not appear to act solely by binding and sequestering Slit, as the Robo2\u2206Ig2 receptor can still bind Slit, but is completely unable to inhibit Robo1 activity."

In this case, secreted DKK binds to the lipoprotein related proteins (LRP5 and 6), which are co-receptors for Wnt, and prevents LRP interaction with the Frizzled/Wnt ligand receptor complex (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ahn et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Chen et al., 2011</a>). While Robo2 is not secreted, there is evidence that Robo1 receptor extracellular domains can be cleaved and shed into the extracellular space (<a href=\"#bib7\">Coleman et al., 2010</a>), and we have observed that the Robo2 ectodomain can also be shed in vitro and in vivo (Evans and Bashaw, unpublished). In the future, it will be interesting to investigate whether Robo2 binding prevents Robo1 from interacting with Slit in vivo, and whether Robo2 receptor cleavage is important for its ability to promote midline crossing. Alternatively, Robo2 could prevent the recruitment of Robo1's downstream signaling molecules such as Enabled, Nck/Dock and Son of Sevenless (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bashaw et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Fan et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Yang and Bashaw, 2006</a>)."

In the context of midline axon repulsion, Robo2 binds Slit through its extracellular Ig1 domain and cooperates with Robo1 to prevent abnormal midline crossing. It is not known how Robo2 signals repulsion, but based on receptor swap experiments that demonstrate that Robo1 can substitute for Robo2's midline repulsive activity, it seems likely that a common cytoplasmic signaling output shared by Robo1 and Robo2 (perhaps mediated by the shared CC0 or CC1 motifs) is important for repulsion (<a href=\"#bib40\">Spitzweck et al., 2010</a>). Robo2 also directs the mediolateral position of axons in the CNS, an activity conferred by a combination of its extracellular Ig1 and Ig3 domains (<a href=\"#bib10\">Evans and Bashaw, 2010b</a>). In this context, distinct biochemical properties conferred by Ig3 appear to direct Robo2 receptor multimerization, and this property correlates with the ability to regulate lateral position in vivo (<a href=\"#bib10\">Evans and Bashaw, 2010b</a>). Finally, in addition to these activities, we have recently discovered a new function for Robo2 in regulating the guidance of specific populations of motor axons to their appropriate muscle targets. In this case, Robo2's guidance activity depends on unique features of its cytoplasmic domain (<a href=\"#bib37\">Santiago et al., 2014</a>)."

One important factor that is likely to contribute to the coordination of these activities is the regulation of the spatial and temporal expression of Robo2. For example, in late stage embryos, Robo2 protein expression is restricted to the lateral most regions of the longitudinal connectives where it is presumably acting to control lateral positioning, while in younger embryos <i>robo2</i> mRNA can be detected in ipsilateral pioneer neurons where it is likely contributing to midline repulsion. Robo2 is also detected in midline glia and neurons, where we propose it may act to prevent premature responses to Slit. At present, little is known about how these patterns of expression are established and temporally regulated, although we have recently shown that the homeodomain transcription factors <i>dHb9</i> and <i>nkx6</i> are required for <i>robo2</i> expression in a subset of motor neurons (<a href=\"#bib37\">Santiago et al., 2014</a>)."

Here, we note that Robo2 does not appear to be able to promote midline crossing cell-autonomously, either in subsets of commissural neurons in rescue experiments, or in the apterous ipsilateral interneurons in gain-of-function experiments. This could be because Robo2 is unable to bind to Robo1 in cis in vivo, or alternatively because Robo1\u2013Robo2 cis interactions confer a distinct outcome from the inhibitory effect of Robo2 presented from other cells. This is reminiscent of the different responses produced by cis and trans interactions between receptors and their ligands (<a href=\"#bib46\">Yaron and Sprinzak, 2012</a>). How distinct signaling responses are triggered by the different structural conformations resulting from cis vs trans interactions remains poorly understood. Future experiments to define the mechanisms that control the specific expression domains and biochemical activities of Robo2 promise to continue to offer new insights into the molecular biology of axon guidance."

Modified BACs were generated by replacing <i>robo2</i> exons 2\u201314 and intervening introns with untagged or HA-tagged cDNAs via recombineering. Briefly, partial <i>robo2</i> cDNAs plus a kanamycin-resistance selective marker were cloned into a plasmid vector flanked by 50 bp homology arms matching the 3\u2032 end of the <i>robo2</i> first intron and the beginning of the <i>robo2</i> 3\u2032 UTR. This cassette was excised by PmeI digestion and electroporated into DY380 cells containing the original CH321-22K18 BAC in which expression of lambda recombination genes had been induced by heat shock. Potential recombinant BACs were selected on LB plates containing chloramphenicol (12.5 \u03bcg/ml) and kanamycin (25 \u03bcg/ml), and verified by PCR amplification and sequencing of the entire recombineered region."

Embryos were mounted in 70% glycerol/PBS. Fluorescent mRNA in situ hybridization was performed as described, with digoxigenin labeled probe (<a href=\"#bib45\">Yang et al., 2009</a>). Briefly, hybridized probe was detected with anti-digoxigenin-HRP (Roche), using fluorescein-labeled tyramide as a substrate (TSA Fluorescence System, Perkin Elmer, Waltham MA). Phenotypes were analyzed and images were acquired using a spinning disk confocal system (Perkin Elmer) built on a Nikon Ti-U inverted microscope using a Nikon OFN25 60\u00d7 objective with a Hamamatsu C10600-10B CCD camera and Yokogawa CSU-10 scanner head with Volocity imaging software. Images were processed using ImageJ. For fluorescence quantification of HA and Slit antibody staining in S2R+ cells, ImageJ was used to generate max projections and to obtain the average pixel intensity for a region of interest (four cells or more). For each channel, relative fluorescence intensity was calculated by dividing the average pixel intensity of transfected cells by that of untransfected cells from the same slide. The values from three images per Robo2 variant (Robo2, Robo2\u0394Ig1, Robo2\u0394Ig2, Robo2\u0394Ig1+2) were averaged; all images were acquired using identical imaging parameters."

                    "text": "The manuscript by Evans et al. describes a role for <i>Drosophila</i> Robo2 in the promotion of midline crossing by embryonic CNS axons. The work builds upon an earlier finding from the Dickson lab that demonstrated an unexpected role for Robo2 in promoting midline crossing, in addition to its previously characterized role as a midline repellant. In the current work, the authors expand upon this finding and provide data that suggests Robo2 functions in promoting midline crossing by inhibiting Robo1 activity that escapes the commissureless routing effects. The authors characterize this role for Robo2 by examining midline crossing defects in the sensitized background where Netrin-Frazzled signaling is disrupted. The authors demonstrate this effect can occur non-cell autonomously, and provide evidence that midline cells express Robo2 at the correct time of development for it to inhibit Robo1-Slit biology. The authors use domain deletions to show that this effect of Robo2 on promoting crossing is independent of its Slit-binding properties, separating it from the requirements for Robo2 as a midline repellant. The authors also demonstrate binding of Robo2 to Robo1, with some evidence for a trans interaction, and suggest a potential pathway by which Robo2 expressed on midline cells inhibits residual Robo1 on axons to facilitate midline crossing. Among the many features of the paper that are quite compelling is the demonstration that midline crossing by Robo2 does not require its intracellular domain, which likely eliminates a signal-transduction role for Robo2 as a receptor for an unknown positive attractor. This points to an inhibitory role for Robo2. The question then becomes how Robo2 acts. One model would be a cis-inhibition as found for Robo3 in mammalian commissural axons, where it blocks the function of the other Robos. The authors provide data for an alternative model that Robo2 instead acts in midline cells to non-cell autonomously silence Robo1 in a trans interaction. In summary, the data are thorough and the data strongly support new ideas concerning the mechanisms that shape complex neural circuitry during embryonic development. As such, the paper is considered appropriate for the general audience of <i>eLife</i>. However, there are a few experimental concerns that should be addressed. Finally, given the general audience targeted by <i>eLife</i>, the manuscript needs to be re-written to enable the general readership to better understand access the data and logic presented in this paper."

The authors have gone the extra length to control for differential transgene expression by integrating transgenes at a single expression locus. This is considered excellent. However, concerns were raised by the reviewers that this does not account for the possibility that mutant proteins fail to reach the cell surface. The reviewers acknowledge that it is not possible to make such a determination in the embryo with available reagents. However, controls in heterologous cells to tests that transgenic proteins are processed and traffic correctly would be a nice addition to the manuscript. This experiment would be able to determine gross changes in the trafficking of mutant proteins and would not be expected to measure subtle differences, as this could not be directly compared to the gene expression in vivo."

More specifically, the conclusion that Robo1 and Robo2 interact in trans should be tempered (\u201cAlthough we detected strong interactions between Robo1 and Robo2 in co-transfected cells, we could not detect interactions in cells that were transfected separately and mixed together\u201d). This is one possibility supported by the data, yet there are caveats. For example, no interaction is seen in separately transfected cells unless lysates are prepared where cis and trans can no longer be distinguished. There is some robust biochemistry to demonstrate the Robo2-Robo1 interaction, although the evidence for a strictly trans interaction are the weakest of the data in this section."

The authors have gone the extra length to control for differential transgene expression by integrating transgenes at a single expression locus. This is considered excellent. However, concerns were raised by reviewers that this does not account for the possibility that mutant proteins fail to reach the cell surface. The reviewers acknowledge that it is not possible to make such a determination in the embryo with available reagents. However, controls in heterologous cells to tests that transgenic proteins are processed and traffic correctly would be a nice addition to the manuscript. This experiment would be able to determine gross changes in the trafficking of mutant proteins and would not be expected to measure subtle differences, as this could not be directly compared to the gene expression in vivo</i>."

In the original <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, all three of the deletion variants are robustly expressed and localized to the plasma membrane as detected by their N-terminal HA epitope tags. In addition, since Robo2\u2206Ig2 is able to bind to bath applied Slit (and mediate Slit-repulsion in vivo), this receptor must be present on the surface. We also note that the \u2206Ig1 variant still has significant pro-crossing activity, which is consistent with surface localization. In addition, our western blots show clear bands of the expected sizes for all of the variants that we analyze, suggesting that there are not problems with protein folding."

We find that the Robo2\u2206Ig1 and Robo2\u2206Ig1-2 do not detectably bind Slit in this assay. The Slit signal detected on these cells is no different from that observed on untransfected cells. In addition, we note a slight reduction in the ability of Robo2\u2206Ig2 to bind Slit. The biological meaning of this, if any, is unclear, especially given that Robo2\u2206Ig2 is equivalent to wild-type Robo2 in its ability to mediate repulsion in response to Slit in vivo. This is true when Robo2\u2206Ig2 is expressed as a UAS transgene and when Robo2\u2206Ig2 is expressed from a BAC. In order to more rigorously compare any differences in Slit binding due to deletion of Ig2, more quantitative biochemical/biophysical experiments would be needed. We believe that the key observation here is that as predicted from the structural data, deleting Robo2\u2019s Ig1 domain prevents Slit binding."

We do not see any obvious differences in the ability of Slit to bind cells that co-express Robo1 and Robo2 from cells that are individually transfected. However, we do not believe that this is a clearly interpretable experiment. Even if Robo2 were able to prevent Slit binding to Robo1, the fact that Robo2 itself is a strong Slit binding receptor would complicate the interpretation of this experiment. In order to rigorously address this issue, future competition binding experiments using purified proteins and surface plasmon resonance will be needed. We feel that such analysis is beyond the scope of the current manuscript and that given the caveats to interpreting the cell binding in co-transfected cells, we would rather not include this data in the manuscript."

This is one possibility supported by the data, yet there are caveats. For example, no interaction is seen in separately transfected cells unless lysates are prepared where cis and trans can no longer be distinguished.
