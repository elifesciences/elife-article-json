Cells maintain mitochondrial homeostasis through a number of pathways that remodel the mitochondrial proteome or alter mitochondrial content during times of stress or metabolic adaptation. Here, using yeast as a model system, we identify a new mitochondrial degradation system that remodels the mitochondrial proteome of aged cells. Unlike many common mitochondrial degradation pathways, this system selectively removes a subset of membrane proteins from the mitochondrial inner and outer membranes, while leaving the remainder of the organelle intact. Selective removal of preexisting proteins is achieved by sorting into a mitochondrial-derived compartment, or MDC, followed by release through mitochondrial fission and elimination by autophagy. Formation of MDCs requires the import receptors Tom70/71, and failure to form these structures exacerbates preexisting mitochondrial dysfunction, suggesting that the MDC pathway provides protection to mitochondria in times of stress."

Cells maintain mitochondrial homeostasis through a number of pathways that remodel the mitochondrial proteome or alter mitochondrial content during times of stress or metabolic adaptation. Here, using yeast as a model system, we identify a new mitochondrial degradation system that remodels the mitochondrial proteome of aged cells. Unlike many common mitochondrial degradation pathways, this system selectively removes a subset of membrane proteins from the mitochondrial inner and outer membranes, while leaving the remainder of the organelle intact. Selective removal of preexisting proteins is achieved by sorting into a mitochondrial-derived compartment, or MDC, followed by release through mitochondrial fission and elimination by autophagy. Formation of MDCs requires the import receptors Tom70/71, and failure to form these structures exacerbates preexisting mitochondrial dysfunction, suggesting that the MDC pathway provides protection to mitochondria in times of stress."

Metabolic pathways that occur within mitochondria include the TCA cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, amino acid metabolism, and biosynthesis of lipids, heme, and iron-sulfur clusters (<a href=\"#bib60\">Rutter and Hughes, 2015</a>). Because so many vital processes take place within mitochondria, cells have evolved multiple mechanisms to maintain mitochondrial homeostasis under the diverse array of physiological states that a cell can exist in. These mechanisms are important for maintaining mitochondrial function during development, cellular specialization, aging and environmental challenges of nutrient availability or toxic stresses. Failure to maintain mitochondrial homeostasis under these conditions contributes to the development of numerous age-associated and metabolic disorders (<a href=\"#bib51\">Nunnari and Suomalainen, 2012</a>)."

In the area of mitochondrial protein degradation, cells are equipped with numerous proteolytic pathways that function to maintain mitochondrial homeostasis (<a href=\"#bib3\">Anand et al., 2013</a>). Some of these pathways target individual mitochondrial proteins, whereas others act more broadly and remove large portions of the organelle. Examples of the former include AAA<sup>+</sup>-ATPase proteases within all mitochondrial compartments that promote the degradation of unassembled protein complex subunits, oxidatively damaged proteins, and tail-anchored membrane proteins mistargeted to the mitochondrial outer membrane (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chen et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Gerdes et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Okreglak and Walter, 2014</a>).

In metazoa, the PINK1/Parkin pathway serves as a paradigm of mitophagy (<a href=\"#bib56\">Pickrell and Youle, 2015</a>). PINK1 is a mitochondrial-localized kinase that is rapidly turned over in healthy mitochondria, but becomes stabilized on the surface of mitochondria with a reduced mitochondrial membrane potential, or \u25b3\u03a8 (<a href=\"#bib48\">Narendra et al., 2010</a>). Upon stabilization, PINK1 recruits the E3 ligase Parkin, which ubiquitinates a number of mitochondrial surface proteins to promote fragmentation and destruction of dysfunctional mitochondria in the lysosome by autophagy (<a href=\"#bib47\">Narendra et al., 2008</a>). Importantly, all the general machinery of autophagy must be active for mitophagy to occur. The apparent specificity comes in tagging mitochondria for autophagy."

The most clearly defined version of mitophagy in budding yeast requires a mitochondrial outer membrane protein, Atg32, to link fragments of mitochondria to the autophagy machinery for degradation (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kanki et al., 2009b</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Okamoto et al., 2009</a>). Unlike the PINK1/Parkin pathway, the Atg32 pathway does not appear to respond to loss of \u25b3\u03a8 and does not utilize ubiquitin tagging for mitochondrial destruction. Instead, expression of Atg32 on the surface of mitochondria promotes turnover of mitochondria, primarily during times of regulated metabolic remodeling such as during the transition from robust growth to a starved or stationary phase-like state. In this regard, Atg32-dependent mitophagy may be a functional homologue to the tagging of mitochondria by the NIX protein during reticulocyte maturation (<a href=\"#bib50\">Novak et al., 2010</a>). NIX is proposed to serve as a receptor on mitochondria to mediate mitophagy in this developmental process."

PINK1/Parkin are also needed for MDV formation and degradation, but interestingly the core autophagy machinery is not required (<a href=\"#bib40\">McLelland et al., 2014</a>).

We and others have shown that aged yeast cells have reduced \u25b3\u03a8, decreased mitochondrial import, and altered mitochondrial morphology that transitions from a typical tubular shape to one that is highly fragmented and amorphous with increasing age (<a href=\"#bib21\">Hughes and Gottschling, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Lam et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">McFaline-Figueroa et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Scheckhuber et al., 2007</a>).

In the present study, we followed the fate of these age-associated changes in mitochondria to further our understanding of how cells maintain mitochondrial homeostasis during the course of aging.

Therefore we tested whether autophagy played a role in maintaining mitochondrial function in aged yeast. Specifically, we examined aged cells for the presence of a mitochondrial outer membrane protein, Tom70-GFP, within vacuoles. No GFP signal was detected in the vacuole of wild-type cells across a wide range of ages (data not shown). However, vacuolar proteases rapidly degrade proteins taken up by autophagy and thus frequently prevent protein detection in the vacuole. Therefore, we re-assessed the presence of vacuolar Tom70-GFP in aged cells lacking <i>PEP4</i>, a gene encoding a master vacuolar protease that is required for turnover of autophagosomes in the vacuole (<a href=\"#bib30\">Klionsky et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Takeshige et al., 1992</a>). In young cells, which had functional mitochondria, no Tom70-GFP was detected in vacuoles by fluorescence microscopy (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). However, vacuoles in 70% of aged cells contained Tom70-GFP (marked by white arrows in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Tom70-GFP in the vacuole appeared as a body exhibiting constant Brownian motion within the boundary of the vacuole membrane (data not shown), which is characteristic of autophagosomes that cannot be broken down in <i>pep4\u25b3</i> cells (<a href=\"#bib75\">Takeshige et al., 1992</a>)."

Aged <i>atg5\u25b3 pep4\u25b3</i> cells contained no Tom70-GFP in the vacuole, which indicated that Tom70-GFP normally entered the vacuole via autophagy (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). In addition to the core autophagy machinery, some forms of mitochondrial autophagy require the mitochondrial fission machinery (<a href=\"#bib45\">Muller et al., 2015</a>). Delivery of Tom70-GFP to the vacuole in aged cells also required the mitochondrial fission machinery, as this process was inhibited in cells lacking <i>DNM1</i>, which encodes a conserved GTPase required for mitochondrial fission (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bleazard et al., 1999</a>). Lastly, starvation-induced mitophagy in yeast relies on Atg32, a receptor on the mitochondrial surface that links mitochondria to the autophagy machinery for degradation (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kanki et al., 2009b</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Okamoto et al., 2009</a>). However, Tom70 degradation in aged cells is independent of Atg32; aged cells lacking <i>ATG32</i> delivered Tom70-GFP to the vacuole at the same level as in wild-type cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). These results suggest we identified an autophagy-dependent pathway for degrading Tom70 in mitochondria from aging yeast cells that requires mitochondrial fission and is distinct from the previously characterized Atg32-dependent pathway."

This decline coincided with a highly fragmented vacuole, depicted in the third panel of <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>. For reasons that are unclear, vacuoles increase in size with age and then can become severely fragmented in very old cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib34\">Lee et al., 2012</a>). Interestingly, in all cells with a severely fragmented vacuole, Tom70-GFP appears in small vesicle-like structures in the cytoplasm (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> and <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). These structures are not cytosolically-localized autophagosomes, because they are still present in old cells lacking <i>ATG5</i> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a> and <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). However, their formation does require the mitochondrial fission GTPase <i>DNM1</i> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a> and <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>). Thus, although mitochondrial protein destruction is activated in middle-aged cells, this autophagy-dependent degradation appears compromised in very old yeast, leading to production of Dnm1-dependent vesicle-like structures."

                                "text": "We previously showed that mitochondrial dysfunction in aged cells is caused by disruption of a metabolic relationship between mitochondria and vacuoles (<a href=\"#bib21\">Hughes and Gottschling, 2012</a>). Vacuoles are acidified by the Vacuolar-H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase (V-ATPase) (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kane, 2006</a>), and the proton gradient generated by this protein complex is required for amino acid storage within the vacuole lumen (<a href=\"#bib31\">Klionsky et al., 1990</a>). Loss of vacuole acidity in aged cells causes mitochondrial dysfunction through an undefined mechanism that likely involves altered storage of cellular amino acids (<a href=\"#bib21\">Hughes and Gottschling, 2012</a>). To test if loss of vacuole acidity triggers autophagy-dependent mitochondrial protein degradation, we took advantage of the fact that treatment of young cells with concanamycin A (conc A), a specific inhibitor of the V-ATPase (<a href=\"#bib13\">Drose et al., 1993</a>), recapitulates age-associated changes in mitochondria (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib21\">Hughes and Gottschling, 2012</a>). Consistent with our previous findings, treatment with conc A caused an immediate loss of vacuolar acidity, followed by a decline in mitochondrial \u25b3\u03a8 within 30 min as measured by microscopy (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>) using the common mitochondrial membrane potential fluorescent dye DiOC<sub>6</sub> (<a href=\"#bib57\">Pringle et al., 1989</a>), or by flow cytometry (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) using DiOC<sub>6</sub> and another mitochondrial membrane potential dye, TMRM (<a href=\"#bib61\">Scaduto and Grotyohann, 1999</a>). Similar to our observations in aged cells, treatment of young cells with conc A caused accumulation of Tom70-GFP-containing bodies within the vacuole (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, white arrows). Because no Tom70-GFP was present in the vacuoles of untreated <i>pep4\u25b3</i> cells, we conclude that loss of vacuolar acidity triggers activation of this pathway. Additionally, in contrast to old cells, it was not necessary to delete <i>PEP4</i> to observe Tom70-GFP within the vacuole of conc A treated cells. This is likely because inhibition of the V-ATPase with conc A creates an environment within the lumen that prevents autophagosome breakdown (<a href=\"#bib46\">Nakamura et al., 1997</a>). The appearance of Tom70-GFP in the conc A treated vacuole occurred within three hours after mitochondrial depolarization, and was preceded by the formation of a single bright focus that contained Tom70-GFP, but appeared somewhat distinct from the rest of the mitochondria (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, white *). As in old cells, delivery of Tom70-GFP to the vacuole was dependent on both the autophagy (Atg5) and mitochondrial fission machineries (Dnm1), but independent of Atg32 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>).

Once released by vacuolar proteases, GFP is stable in the vacuole lumen. The release of GFP from Tom70-GFP was monitored by immunoblot analysis in cells treated with conc A, and the results mirrored what was observed in the microscopy-based assay (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>).

Although treatment of cells with these inhibitors caused mitochondrial depolarization equal to or greater than conc A (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A and B</a>), we did not observe Tom70-GFP delivery to the vacuole at any point during treatment with these compounds (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>).

However, although fission-defective <i>dnm1\u2206</i> cells formed MDCs normally at two hours after conc A addition, at later timepoints, MDCs grew very large in these cells and were not released from mitochondria to the vacuole (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, white arrows). This suggests that mitochondrial membrane fission activity is required for release of MDCs for autophagic degradation. In support of this conclusion, Fis1, an essential component of the mitochondrial fission machinery that recruits Dnm1 to mitochondrial membrane (<a href=\"#bib43\">Mozdy et al., 2000</a>), is also required for release of MDCs from mitochondria (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Moreover, foci of Dnm1-GFP, representing sites of mitochondrial fission, localize near MDCs in 88% of cells (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Collectively, these data suggest that the mitochondrial fission machinery is required for MDC release."

However, at later timepoints, Tom70-GFP did not enter the vacuole in these mutants, and MDCs were less apparent. Instead, Tom70-GFP was present in small vesicle-like structures (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>) that looked similar to those that formed in very old cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Further supporting the role of autophagy in MDC degradation, MDCs in 68% of cells localized at or near the preautophagosomal structure (PAS) at the vacuole membrane, which is the site of autophagosome formation and target engulfment in yeast (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) (<a href=\"#bib15\">Feng et al., 2014</a>). Taken together, these results suggest that the MDC is an intermediate step on the way to Tom70-GFP degradation in the vacuole by autophagy, and that its release from the mitochondrial surface relies on mitochondrial fission. At this point, we also cannot rule out other alternative fates for the MDC, such as delivery to other cellular compartments."

If this were true, proteins incorporated into MDCs would be newly synthesized, not preexisting mitochondrial proteins. To test this, old and newly synthesized versions of proteins were monitored for their incorporation into the same MDC using the recombination induced tag exchange (RITE) system (<a href=\"#bib80\">Verzijlbergen et al., 2010</a>). As illustrated in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, fusion of the RITE cassette to a protein of interest allows rapid and permanent switching of epitope tags through an estradiol-inducible Cre/loxP based mechanism. With this system, old protein synthesized before the switch is GFP tagged, while all subsequently synthesized protein is mRFP tagged. The RITE cassette was fused to Tom70 and Oac1, outer and inner membrane MDC substrates, respectively. Cells expressing these proteins were treated with conc A to induced MDC formation, along with estradiol to switch tags on the proteins from GFP to mRFP. Both mRFP and GFP versions of each protein were found in the MDC (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>), suggesting that MDCs incorporate old, preexisting proteins, and are not specific to unimported mitochondrial substrates. Because the mRFP-tagged protein targeted to MDCs may be synthesized prior to their formation, we cannot determine with this assay whether newly synthesized mitochondrial proteins are also targeted to this compartment. However, further supporting the idea that MDCs incorporate proteins that preexist within mitochondria, MDCs still formed in the presence of cycloheximide, which effectively prohibited synthesis of the newly synthesized version of both RITE-tagged Tom70 and Oac1 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). These results suggest that preexisting mitochondrial proteins are segregated into MDCs prior to degradation by autophagy."

                        "text": "Using yeast as a model, we have identified a new form of autophagy-dependent mitochondrial protein degradation that is activated in aged cells undergoing vacuole-induced mitochondrial dysfunction. This pathway specifically destroys a subset of the mitochondrial membrane proteome through a series of steps outlined in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>. First, loss of acidity in the vacuole of aged or young cells triggers formation of a mitochondrial derived compartment, or MDC, through an unknown signal. Preexisting mitochondrial outer and inner membrane proteins that rely on Tom70 for import into the mitochondria are sequestered into the MDC through a mechanism that requires the import receptors Tom70/71. After formation, the entire MDC or portions of it are released from the mitochondria by a process that requires the mitochondrial fission machinery, and subsequently delivered to the vacuole by autophagy. Our data suggests that MDC formation helps protect mitochondria from vacuole-induced stress, as cells that cannot form MDCs exhibit a greater loss of membrane potential in response to disruption of vacuolar acidity (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). A collapse of MDC-mediated autophagy occurs in very old yeast cells, leading to Dnm1-dependent formation of small Tom70-containing vesicle-like structures in the cytoplasm (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Interestingly, deletion of <i>DNM1</i> has been reported to extend lifespan in yeast (<a href=\"#bib62\">Scheckhuber et al., 2007</a>), raising the possibility that these Tom70-containing mitochondrial fragments may contribute to cell toxicity or death in aged yeast."

The MDC pathway appears mechanistically distinct from other autophagy-dependent systems such as PINK1/Parkin- and Atg32-dependent mitophagy (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kanki et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib84\">Youle and Narendra, 2011</a>). Both of these pathways are thought to degrade whole portions of mitochondria, whereas MDCs selectively destroy a subset of mitochondrial membrane associated proteins. In this light, MDCs appear to have more in common with mitochondrial-derived vesicles, or MDVs, an autophagy-independent form of mitochondrial quality control thus far only identified in mammals (<a href=\"#bib73\">Sugiura et al., 2014</a>). Several different classes of MDVs have been described to date, and all of them selectively incorporate a subset of the mitochondrial proteome for delivery to the peroxisome or lysosome (<a href=\"#bib49\">Neuspiel et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Soubannier et al., 2012a</a>). However, MDCs also differ from MDVs. Although the complete substrate specificity of MDVs is not well defined, it is clearly different than MDCs (<a href=\"#bib49\">Neuspiel et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Soubannier et al., 2012b</a>). Additionally, unlike MDCs, release of MDVs from mitochondria does not require the mitochondrial fission machinery (<a href=\"#bib49\">Neuspiel et al., 2008</a>). Interestingly, recent studies have suggested that the PINK1/Parkin- and Atg32-mitophagy pathways might also act in substrate selective manners like MDCs and MDVs (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abeliovich et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Chan et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Vincow et al., 2013</a>).

                        "text": "What is the function of the MDC pathway? The answer to this question may lie in the nature of the substrates targeted for degradation through MDCs. By screening through the mitochondrial proteome, we found that membrane proteins lacking defined mitochondrial-targeting presequences are sequestered into MDCs. These proteins require the mitochondrial surface receptor Tom70 for import into the mitochondria (<a href=\"#bib64\">Schmidt et al., 2010</a>). The largest class of these Tom70-dependent import substrates is the mitochondrial carrier proteins, an evolutionarily conserved family of nutrient transporters that facilitate exchange of metabolites across the mitochondrial inner membrane (<a href=\"#bib54\">Palmieri and Pierri, 2010</a>). Yeast contain ~35 members of this family in their inner membrane, which have affinity for many different metabolites including amino acids, nucleotides, metals, and TCA cycle intermediates. Interestingly, MDC formation is triggered by inhibiting vacuolar function. One important function of the vacuole is storage of nutrients (<a href=\"#bib31\">Klionsky et al., 1990</a>), and we previously showed that mitochondrial failure in response to loss of vacuole acidity results from impaired storage of nutrients such as amino acids within the vacuole lumen (<a href=\"#bib21\">Hughes and Gottschling, 2012</a>). This raises the possibility that the purpose of the MDC pathway is to sequester mitochondrial nutrient transporters in response to cytoplasmic nutrient overload (<a href=\"#bib83\">Wellen and Thompson, 2010</a>), perhaps to prevent unregulated nutrient influx into the mitochondria. Alternatively, the MDC pathway may degrade nutrient transporters to adjust mitochondrial metabolism towards a state preferable to survive vacuole impairment."

These compartments form from the vacuole membrane in response to cellular nutrient fluctuations, and have been shown to sequester a vacuolar lysine transporter away from the rest of the vacuolar membrane. They look morphologically similar to MDCs, but interestingly, are destroyed after release from the vacuole membrane by the multivesicular body pathway, not autophagy. Whether these vacuole-derived compartments are related in any way to MDCs is currently unclear. However, given the intimate metabolic relationship between the vacuole and mitochondria (<a href=\"#bib60\">Rutter and Hughes, 2015</a>), and the recent identification of a physical tether (vCLAMP) between these organelles (<a href=\"#bib14\">Elbaz-Alon et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Honscher et al., 2014</a>), it will be important to explore the relationship between MDCs and vacuole-derived compartments (<a href=\"#bib35\">Li et al., 2015</a>), as well as to determine the role of the MDC in vacuole-mitochondria crosstalk."

At this point, we know that the MDC contains both inner and outer mitochondrial membrane-associated proteins, and that proteins incorporated into MDCs preexist within mitochondria. This suggests a sorting and segregation system exists in the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes. The nature of how that might occur is unclear, but the import receptor Tom70/71 plays a role in the formation of the MDC. This suggests that these proteins have roles beyond their function in mitochondrial import. Consistent with this idea, Tom70/71 are known to be required for recruiting an F-box protein Mfb1 to the mitochondrial surface (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kondo-Okamoto et al., 2008</a>), and were recently shown to form an ER-mitochondrial tether with the ER sterol-transport protein Ltc1/Lam6 (<a href=\"#bib44\">Murley et al., 2015</a>). It will ultimately be important to determine whether MDC\u2019s contain a single or double membrane, which along with identifying more MDC formation machinery will begin to shape our understanding of how proteins might be incorporated into these structures.

Autophagy can selectively degrade a number of organelles, cellular substructures, and protein aggregates (<a href=\"#bib72\">Stolz et al., 2014</a>). In mammals, the degradation of these structures is often facilitated by ubiquitination of target molecules to be degraded (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kirkin et al., 2009</a>). Ubiquitin tags are recognized by adaptor proteins such as p62, which bind both ubiquitin and the autophagy protein Atg8/LC3 to link target molecules to the autophagy machinery (<a href=\"#bib55\">Pankiv et al., 2007</a>). However, yeast homologs of p62 lack ubiquitin-binding domains, and until very recently, it was unclear if yeast could target proteins for autophagy-dependent degradation through ubiquitin tagging (<a href=\"#bib59\">Rogov et al., 2014</a>). However, a recent study identified the conserved CUET protein Cue5 as an ubiquitin/Atg8-binding adaptor protein that facilitates autophagy-dependent turnover of ubiquitylated protein aggregates (<a href=\"#bib38\">Lu et al., 2014</a>). It remains to be seen whether ubiquitylation and the CUET protein family play any role in the MDC pathway."

First, we created pAG306-GPD-eGFP-ccdB chr I, a plasmid for high expression of N-terminal GFP fusion constructs from the <i>GPD</i> promoter that can be integrated into chromosome I (199456\u2013199457) after NotI digestion.

Along these lines, the origination of the MDC with the autophagy machinery needs a deeper look and each reviewer has suggested a few experiments. Finally, the analysis of which mitochondrial perturbations can generate the MDC needs a little more analysis and suggestions to include mitochondrial toxins is a good place to start. Overall, the reviews are very favorable and please contact the Reviewing editor if you need additional input."

As a control to address this point, we previously showed that MDCs still form in the presence of cycloheximide, which completely blocks all new synthesis of the RITE tag protein. Thus, the MDC is not formed from newly synthesized, unimported protein in this instance. In addition, outer membrane proteins that are MDC substrates do not require mitochondrial membrane potential for import into the mitochondria, and would not be expected to accumulate outside the mitochondrial under depolarizing conditions. Lastly, we have now included data in the manuscript as new <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> (see question 2 below) that shows that loss of membrane potential is not sufficient to trigger MDC formation. If the MDC were simply a collection of unimported substrates, it would form under all mitochondrial depolarizing conditions that block mitochondrial import (e.g. loss of membrane potential), but we find that it does not."

Briefly, we added a new <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> to the manuscript addressing whether loss of mitochondrial membrane potential or oxidative stress is sufficient to trigger MDC formation by treating cells with FCCP, antimycin A, or hydrogen peroxide. None of these three treatments resulted in MDC formation, suggesting that loss of membrane potential is not sufficient to trigger this pathway. We also agree with the reviewer(s) that the MDC pathway may not necessarily be a quality control pathway, but rather, a pathway for another type of mitochondrial dynamics/reprogramming. With the current set of data, we cannot exclude either possibility. As noted above, we have modified the manuscript accordingly to reflect this different view. The signal that activates the MDC pathway in response to changes in vacuole function is unknown, but could very well be metabolic in nature."

Our current data suggests that the MDC or pieces of it gets released from the mitochondria by fission, and then degraded by autophagy in autophagosomes. This suggests that MDCs follow a traditional autophagy degradation route to the vacuole through autophagosomes. In support of this, we added data to the paper showing that loss of <i>VAM3</i> prevents the appearance of Tom70 within the vacuole of conc A treated cells. Vam3 is part of the vacuolar homotypic fusion machinery, and is required for fusion of autophagosomes with vacuoles. This data has been added to <a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig4\">4</a>, and strongly supports the conclusion that MDCs are engulfed by autophagosomes and delivered to the vacuole through the normal autophagy route. The reviewer raises the idea that conc A should interfere with endomembrane trafficking to the vacuole. While this is the case in mammals, this is not true in yeast. We added a brief discussion of this point in the paper, highlighting previous literature that shows that autophagosomes are delivered efficiently to vacuoles in the absence of vacuolar acidity (Nakamura et al., J of Biochem 1997). However, autophagosomes cannot be broken down in non-acidic vacuoles and accumulate there, and we see this in our assay as well."

Thus, this pathway is not constitutively on in young cells, and must be induced by a signal originating from loss of vacuolar acidity.
