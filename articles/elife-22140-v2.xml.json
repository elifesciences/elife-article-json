During its assembly, \ufb02agellins are transported unfolded through the central channel in the \ufb02agellum to the growing tip. Here we applied <i>in vivo</i> \ufb02uorescent imaging to monitor in real time the <i>Vibrio alginolyticus</i> polar \ufb02agella growth. The \ufb02agellar growth rate is found to be highly length-dependent. Initially, the \ufb02agellum grows at a constant rate (50nm/min) when shorter than 1500nm. The growth rate decays sharply when the \ufb02agellum grows longer. We modeled \ufb02agellin transport inside the channel as a one-dimensional diffusive process with an injection force at its base. When the \ufb02agellum is short, its growth rate is determined by the loading speed at the base. Only when the \ufb02agellum grows longer does diffusion of \ufb02agellin become the rate-limiting step, dramatically reducing the growth rate. Our results shed new light on the dynamic building process of this complex extracellular structure."
