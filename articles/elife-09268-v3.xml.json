PTBP2 was found to maintain embryonic splicing patterns of many synaptic and cytoskeletal proteins during differentiation of neuronal progenitor cells (NPCs) into early neurons. However, the role of the earlier PTBP1 program in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and NPCs was not clear. We show that PTBP1 controls a program of neuronal gene expression that includes the transcription factor Pbx1. We identify exons specifically regulated by PTBP1 and not PTBP2 as mouse ESCs differentiate into NPCs. We find that PTBP1 represses Pbx1 exon 7 and the expression of the neuronal Pbx1a isoform in ESCs. Using CRISPR-Cas9 to delete regulatory elements for exon 7, we induce Pbx1a expression in ESCs, finding that this activates transcription of neuronal genes. Thus, PTBP1 controls the activity of Pbx1 to suppress its neuronal transcriptional program prior to induction of NPC development."

PTBP2 was found to maintain embryonic splicing patterns of many synaptic and cytoskeletal proteins during differentiation of neuronal progenitor cells (NPCs) into early neurons. However, the role of the earlier PTBP1 program in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and NPCs was not clear. We show that PTBP1 controls a program of neuronal gene expression that includes the transcription factor Pbx1. We identify exons specifically regulated by PTBP1 and not PTBP2 as mouse ESCs differentiate into NPCs. We find that PTBP1 represses Pbx1 exon 7 and the expression of the neuronal Pbx1a isoform in ESCs. Using CRISPR-Cas9 to delete regulatory elements for exon 7, we induce Pbx1a expression in ESCs, finding that this activates transcription of neuronal genes. Thus, PTBP1 controls the activity of Pbx1 to suppress its neuronal transcriptional program prior to induction of NPC development."

PTBP1 is expressed in neuronal progenitor cells and many non-neuronal cells. Upon neuronal differentiation, PTBP1 expression is repressed allowing the induction of PTBP2 and the initiation of a neuronal splicing program that is essential for neuronal maturation and survival (<a href=\"#bib7\">Boutz et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Li et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Licatalosi et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Makeyev et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Tang et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib96\">Zheng et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Gueroussov et al., 2015c</a>). In addition to splicing, the PTB proteins affect other aspects of posttranscriptional regulation in neurons, including miRNA targeting (<a href=\"#bib88\">Xue et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib91\">Yap et al., 2012</a>). It has been shown that depletion of PTBP1 from fibroblasts is sufficient to drive cells towards a neuronal phenotype (<a href=\"#bib88\">Xue et al., 2013</a>).

In these cases, PTBP1 and PTBP2 serve to repress adult splicing patterns during neuronal maturation, yielding isoforms that are expressed only after PTBP2 levels have declined. In other cases, exons are more sensitive to PTBP1 and shift their splicing when PTBP1 is shut off early in neuronal differentiation even though PTBP2 is present (<a href=\"#bib7\">Boutz et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Makeyev et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Markovtsov et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Tang et al., 2011</a>).

By immunofluorescence, Day 2 MNs express the progenitor marker Nestin, whereas Day 5 GFP+ cells express the postmitotic MN marker HB9 and the neuronal marker TuJ1 (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A and B</a>, and data not shown). The presence of PTBP2 in GFP+ cells was also seen by immunofluorescence (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). To monitor PTBP1 and PTBP2 protein specifically in the differentiated neurons, we used fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to isolate GFP+ cells at Days 5 and 8. By western blot, these GFP positive cells express low amounts of PTBP1 and high levels of PTBP2 at Day 5. At Day 8 only trace amounts of PTBP1 are found, while PTBP2 expression remains high (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). We did not observe the late decline in PTBP2 expression that occurs during neuronal maturationin vivo. This decline in PTBP2 expression may take place with longer culture times, or cells may not fully mature in this system. These results show that the switch from PTBP1 to PTBP2 expression occurs during MN differentiation, similar to earlier observations in the developing cortex."

Nestin+ NPCs are observed early in EB cultures, but these cells could not be isolated in pure populations (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). To examine NPCs in more detail, ESCs were grown in N2B27 media and expanded in the presence of EGF and FGF, to yield cultures where greater than 80% of the cells were Nestin+ and with very few TuJ1+ neurons (<a href=\"#bib13\">Conti et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib93\">Ying et al., 2003</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1E and F</a>). We examined both the Hb9-GFP line and the 46C ESC line used in the original monolayer NPC protocol, finding minimal differences in marker staining (<a href=\"#bib93\">Ying et al., 2003</a>). By western blot, we found that both PTBP1 and PTBP2 proteins were expressed in these NPC cultures. As these NPCs were differentiated into neurons with retinoic acid, PTBP1 protein expression was lost while PTBP2 protein was induced (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1G and H</a>). The EB and monolayer culture systems likely give rise to different neuronal populations with differences in gene expression attributable to different neuronal types (<a href=\"#bib20\">Gaspard et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib86\">Wichterle et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Lee et al., 2000b</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Murashov et al., 2005a</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Su et al., 2006c</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Salero and Hatten, 2007</a>).

Poly-A plus RNA was isolated from undifferentiated ESCs (high PTBP1 and low PTBP2), Nestin+ progenitor cells (intermediate PTBP1 and PTBP2), and post-mitotic HB9-GFP+ MNs (low PTBP1 and high PTBP2). Strand specific libraries for each cell type were subjected to 100 nt paired-end sequencing to generate 200 to 250 million mapped reads per sample. Alternative splicing events were quantified using SpliceTrap to identify cassette exons, 5\u2019 and 3\u2019 splice sites, and retained introns that differ between all sample pairs (<a href=\"#bib87\">Wu et al., 2011</a>). PSI values for the HB9 and 46C cell lines were highly correlated (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.92 and 0.90 in ESCs and NPCs respectively), indicating that the two cell lines are similar in splicing phenotype (data not shown). Differentially spliced events were filtered for p-value below 0.05 and ranked by the change in percent spliced in value (\u0394PSI). Using a \u0394PSI cutoff of 15%, we identified a large set of alternative splicing events that change across neuronal differentiation (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A and B</a>). With these filters 1201 differential splicing events were identified between ESCs and MNs, 1218 differential events between NPCs and MNs, and 750 differential events between ESC and NPC (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>). To identify enriched functional categories, transcripts exhibiting differential splicing were compared to the total expressed transcript set by Gene Ontology analyses (<a href=\"#bib28\">Huang et al., 2009a</a>). Differential splicing events between NPCs and MNs were enriched (FDR&lt;0.05) in biological processes and cellular compartments relevant to neuronal differentiation such as cell projection organization, axonogenesis, and cell morphogenesis (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C and D</a>). It is expected that a subset of these splicing changes are the result of changes in PTBP1 and PTBP2 expression."

This number was only slightly increased by double PTBP1/2 depletion, with similar changes in PSI when compared with the single knockdown (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). The splicing changes between the single and double knockdowns showed a strong correlation (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.91, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>), indicating that these events are more strongly affected by PTBP1. A majority of the exons altered by PTB protein depletion also change in the same direction during ESC to MN differentiation (exons in the upper right and lower left quadrants of the plots in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Applying a \u0394PSI cutoff of 15% for both data sets, 30% of neuronal exons are regulated by PTBP1, including 97 neuronally activated exons that are PTBP1 repressed, and 56 neuronally skipped exons that are PTBP1 activated (indicated by red and blue data points respectively in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, left panel; <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 2</a>). 31% of neuronal exons were PTBP1/2 repressed (101) and activated (55) following PTBP1/2 double knockdown (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, right panel). As expected, many exons that change during neuronal differentiation are not affected by PTB protein depletion, indicating likely regulation by other proteins (grey data points along the y-axes of the plots in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>)."

Comparing this list to the splicing changes between NPCs and Day 5 GFP+ MNs identified 16% of neuronal exons regulated by PTBP1 (66 PTBP1-repressed exons increased with differentiation; 23 PTBP1-activated exons decreased with differentiation; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>, left panel; <a href=\"#SD5-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 4</a>). Interestingly, PTBP1/2 double knockdown increased the number of regulated neuronal exons to 30% (116 PTBP1/2-repressed exons increased with differentiation; 45 PTBP1/2-activated exons decreased with differentiation; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>, middle panel). These changes in splicing after double PTBP1/2 knockdown in NPCs also tended to be larger than PTBP1 knockdown alone (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>), yielding a lower correlation than seen in ESC (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.69, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1F</a>). Knockdown of PTBP2 alone in NPCs had only a small effect on the splicing of neuronal exons, indicating that PTBP2 largely regulates a subset of PTBP1 targets, with relatively few targets of its own (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A and D</a>) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>, right panel). This is in agreement with previous results that a large set of exons in the developing mouse brain is regulated by both PTBP1 and PTBP2. These include Dlg4 (Psd-95) exon 18 (<a href=\"#bib7\">Boutz et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Li et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib96\">Zheng et al., 2012</a>). In these new data, PTBP1 and PTBP2 single knockdown each only moderately increased Dlg4 exon 18 splicing (\u0394PSI = 8% and 13% respectively), whereas PTBP1/2 double knockdown increased exon 18 splicing by 42%. Other exons where PTBP2 can compensate for the loss of PTBP1 are found in the Magi1, Ap2a1, and Tnrc6a transcripts (<a href=\"#SD6-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 5</a>). Thus, PTBP1 and PTBP1/2 depletion from NPCs identifies exons that are coregulated by both proteins. Whereas, depletion from ESCs identifies exons affected largely by PTBP1."

Neuronal exons regulated by PTBP1 in ESCs showed significant enrichment (FDR = 0.04) in the cellular compartment ontology term, cell junction. Neuronal exons regulated by PTBP1/2 in NPCs were enriched (FDR = 0.01) in the cellular compartment ontology term, cytoskeleton. The total set of neuronal exons identified during ESC and NPC differentiation were also enriched for these terms among others (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2C and D</a>). The relative lack of enriched terms might reflect a broad number of functions for PTBP targets, but this will require further analysis to assess. Enrichment for cytoskeletal functions is in agreement with previous analyses of PTBP2 function in mice, and with the dramatic cytoskeletal changes during the transition from PTBP1 to PTBP2 during early neuron differentiation (<a href=\"#bib45\">Li et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Licatalosi et al., 2012</a>)."

Many other exons are expected to be direct targets but were excluded due to failure to fulfill a cutoff value in one dataset. The exons in this minimal set affect a wide range of cellular processes including GTPase signaling (Dock7), synaptic function (Gabbr1), and transcriptional regulation (Tcf20) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013D</a>). For example, Gabbr1 is a subunit of a metabotropic gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor. PTBP1 induced skipping of Gabbr1 exon 15 leads to premature translation termination in exon 16 and predicted nonsense mediated decay of the Gabbr1 mRNA (<a href=\"#bib53\">Makeyev et al., 2007</a>). We observe PTBP1 binding within exon 15 and upstream, consistent with the increased exon 15 splicing observed during neuronal differentiation and after PTBP1 depletion (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). This gene is similar to Dlg4, where PTBP1 regulates its overall expression during development rather than the production of a neuronal isoform. However unlike Dlg4, Gabbr1 is more sensitive to PTBP1 than PTBP2, allowing its expression to be induced earlier."

PTBP1 target transcripts influence an array of important cellular functions, and understanding how splicing alters each target\u2019s activity in differentiating cells will be a challenge. We were particularly interested in how the early PTBP1 program affects gene regulation. We identified a number of transcriptional regulators whose splicing is controlled by PTBP1 during ESC differentiation into NPCs, including Tcf20, Med23, Gatad2a, and Pbx1. These early changes in the structure of transcriptional regulators have the potential to broadly alter gene expression programs during neuronal development (<a href=\"#bib19\">Gabut et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Raj et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Demir and Dickson, 2005b</a>)."

Multiple studies implicate Pbx1 and its family members as transcriptional regulators during neuronal development (<a href=\"#bib52\">Maeda et al., 2002a</a>; <a href=\"#bib85\">Vitobello et al., 2011b</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Sgad\u00f2 et al., 2012c</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Schulte et al., 2014</a>). Exon 7 in the Pbx1 transcript is conserved across mammals and its inclusion leads to production of the Pbx1a isoform. Skipping exon 7 shifts the translational reading frame to introduce a new termination codon (PTC) in exon 8 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). This translation stop does not result in NMD but instead generates the shorter isoform, Pbx1b, which retains the DNA binding homeodomain but lacks the 83 amino acids at the C-terminus of Pbx1a. During development, early embryonic tissues predominantly express Pbx1b, whereas Pbx1a is found in neural tissues (<a href=\"#bib68\">Redmond et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Schnabel et al., 2001b</a>). We found a similar isoform switch in cultured cells, where ESCs express low levels of Pbx1b. As ESCs differentiate into NPCs and HB9+ MNs, both overall Pbx1 expression and exon 7 splicing are induced, such that MNs predominantly express the Pbx1a isoform (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B and C</a>). Previous work indicates that the Pbx1a and Pbx1b isoforms have different transcriptional activities and cellular functions. The proteins differ in their ability to activate or repress reporter gene expression, their interactions with the transcriptional corepressors NCoR1 and NCoR2, and their activity for cell transformation when fused to E2A (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kamps et al., 1991</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib16\">Di Rocco et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Asahara et al., 1999b</a>).

To examine the role of Pbx1a repression, we modified the Pbx1 locus using the CRISPR-Cas9 technology to force exon 7 splicing in cells containing PTBP1 (<a href=\"#bib17\">Doudna and Charpentier, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Cong and Zhang, 2015e</a>). Intron 6 upstream of exon 7 contains a PTBP1 iCLIP cluster as well as regions of mammalian sequence conservation, possibly indicative of additional splicing regulatory elements. Guide RNA pairs were designed to target the Cas9 endonuclease to sites within intron 6 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). After Cas9 catalyzes double-strand breaks at each site, non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) of the free ends will potentially generate genomic deletions within intron 6 (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). The largest deletion, between guides 1 and 4, would remove 5.5 kb of intron 6 containing all of the conserved regions, while preserving the splice sites (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). HB9-GFP ESCs were transiently transfected with expression plasmids for Cas9 and two guide RNAs, and clones were isolated from single transfected cells and genotyped by PCR, with the deletion event confirmed by sequencing. Using guides g1 and g4, we identified no homozygous deletions among 60 ESC clones, although heterozygotes were readily isolated (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B and C</a>). We expanded five heterozygous deletion clones with preserved splice sites. Notably, we were still unable to isolate homozygous null cells after reintroducing guides 1 and 4 into a heterozygous cell line. Shorter deletions were also tested. Guides 3 and 4 generated a 1.4 kb deletion that includes the PTBP1 binding site. Again this deletion was only isolated as a heterozygote (1/6 clones). In contrast, guides 2 and 3 generated a 1.5 kb deletion from the middle of the intron that was isolated as a homozygous allele (3/10 clones)."

These levels of regulation are intricately connected, where one type of regulator will target effectors at different steps in the gene expression pathway. In particular, alternative splicing plays a key role in defining the neuronal proteome with thousands of spliced isoforms found specifically in neurons or particular neuronal subtypes (<a href=\"#bib5\">Barbosa-Morais et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Grabowski and Black, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Merkin et al., 2012</a>).

In previous work, we found that the transition from PTBP1 to PTBP2 expression during neuronal differentiation causes a large scale reprogramming of splicing patterns (<a href=\"#bib7\">Boutz et al., 2007</a>). More recently, we identified a second transition late in neuronal maturation, where PTBP2 levels decline allowing for the expression of many adult-specific spliced isoforms (<a href=\"#bib45\">Li et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Licatalosi et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib96\">Zheng et al., 2012</a>). Like many splicing regulators, the PTB proteins also affect other aspects of mRNA metabolism. The depletion of PTBP1 from mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) was shown to induce the trans-differentiation of these cells into neurons (<a href=\"#bib88\">Xue et al., 2013</a>). This was linked to PTBP1 bound in 3\u2019 UTRs altering miRNA targeting of transcripts driving neuronal differentiation, including the REST transcriptional repressor. In contrast, alterations in neuronal differentiation were not observed in mice carrying a conditional <i>Ptbp1</i> knockout mutation in nestin-positive NPCs (<a href=\"#bib78\">Shibasaki et al., 2013</a>). Similarly, we have not found that PTBP1 depletion is sufficient to induce neuronal differentiation of ESCs. This could reflect a difference between ESCs and NPCs compared to MEFs, or differences in culture conditions. Notably, we find here that, like its 3\u2019 UTR targets, the PTBP1 splicing program also includes targets that enhance neuronal development, such as Pbx1."

This raised questions about the mechanisms of their differential targeting and the biological roles of the early and late neuronal splicing programs. The late program was illuminated in the PTBP2 knockout mouse where many exons that are repressed by both proteins were identified (<a href=\"#bib45\">Li et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Licatalosi et al., 2012</a>). However, the early program composed of exons primarily targeted by PTBP1 was harder to define in the developing brain. By examining the PTBP1 splicing program in ESC culture, we now identify a large set of targets primarily responsive to PTBP1 regulation. Interestingly in ESCs, exons that are sensitive PTBP1 depletion are largely not responsive to the concomitant PTBP2 induction. This contrasts with NPCs where exons whose splicing shifts with PTBP1 depletion are often more strongly affected by PTBP1/2 co-depletion. We previously found that in mice heterozygous for the PTBP2 knockout mutation, certain exons were spliced at 50% the level seen in the homozygous null, indicating a strong effect of PTBP2 concentration. Similarly, we find here that certain exons, such as Gabbr1 exon 15, are very sensitive to moderate changes in PTBP1 expression, such as the reduction seen when ESCs differentiate into NPCs. Like PTBP2, the PTBP1 targets display a range of responsiveness to PTBP1 concentration, and the ESC system gives us a new tool for examining this earlier PTBP1 dependent program."

A question of interest is how targeting by the PTB proteins is affected by other neuronal splicing factors. Two known PTBP1 cofactors that may also affect PTBP2 are Matrin3 and Raver1 (<a href=\"#bib11\">Coelho et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Rideau et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Huttelmaier, et al., 2001d</a>). Both these proteins are likely to affect the activity of PTBP1 and PTBP2 on certain targets. We find that both proteins are well expressed in ES cells, and Matrin3 is strongly upregulated with differentiation into NPCs and neurons. We recently identified several potential cofactors that alter the splicing of the PTBP1/2 target exon in Dlg4 (<a href=\"#bib95\">Zheng et al., 2013</a>). These will also be interesting to examine in relation to additional PTBP targets, and whether they more strongly affect exons controlled by PTBP1, PTBP2 or both proteins. A protein that can counteract PTBP repression is nSR100/SRRM4, which is induced with neuronal differentiation and whose targets include some PTBP1/2 targets (<a href=\"#bib9\">Calarco et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Raj et al., 2014</a>). SRRM4 expression coincides with PTBP2, and its role may be to specifically antagonize the effects of PTBP2 on certain exons in immature neurons. It will be also interesting to identify the SRRM4 target exons during NPC differentiation and to assess their sensitivity to PTBP2 compared to PTBP1."

This early switch in Pbx1 isoforms was sufficient to induce a variety of transcripts, including multiple mRNAs implicated in neuronal lineage commitment. Thus, one function of PTBP1 is to repress the neuronal form of Pbx1 and prevent its action at target genes early in development. It will be interesting to further examine how different interactions of the two Pbx1 isoforms might lead to their different activities. Pbx1b lacks 83 amino acids at the C-terminus of Pbx1a but retains domains that facilitate interactions with the Hox, Prep, and Meis transcription factors (<a href=\"#bib50\">Longobardi et al., 2013</a>). An earlier study found that Pbx1a and Pbx1b differ in their interactions with the transcriptional corepressors NCoR1 and NCoR2 and their ability to repress reporter gene expression (<a href=\"#bib4\">Asahara et al., 1999b</a>). Our data indicates that Pbx1a may enhance Meis1 binding at the Hoxc5 locus to activate its expression. Thus, the changes in Pbx1 structure likely influence enhancer complex assembly at specific genes."

The complexity of these regulatory programs is a challenge for understanding their biological roles. Mouse mutations in splicing regulators often exhibit lethal or highly pleiotropic phenotypes. Among the many affected transcripts, few isoforms are usually sufficiently analyzed to understand their altered activity. Cas9 genome editing offers an tool for examining differential isoform activity in the developing nervous system (<a href=\"#bib24\">Gueroussov et al., 2015c</a>). Combining genome editing with stem cell differentiation allows the characterization of isoform activity in specific cells at specific times in development, and provides means for investigating the function of other PTB targets within the larger programs of neurogenesis."

Gene Ontology analyses were performed using DAVID\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib28\">Huang et al., 2009a</a>). Differentially expressed genes were evaluated for Pbx1 ChIP clusters (<a href=\"#bib60\">Penkov et al., 2013b</a>). Pbx1 binding was determined if a ChIP cluster was present within a window 1 kb upstream and downstream of the gene locus."

They characterize the expression dynamics and contributions of these factors to splicing regulation during different stages of differentiation. They then investigate the function of a conserved PTBP1/2-regulated target, exon 7 of the homeodomain transcription factor Pbx1. Derepression by PTBP1 results in increased inclusion of exon 7 and expression of the Pbx1a isoform during differentiation. By utilizing the CRISPR/Cas9 system, the authors delete a PTBP1 intronic splicing repressor element proximal to exon 7. Using RNA-Seq analysis, the authors show that this results in earlier activation of the Pbx1a isoform, and activation of Pbx1 target genes, during MN differentiation."

Alternative splicing regulators typically control large numbers of target exons and introns during development, yet the functions of the vast majority of these targets events are not known. Characterizing the contributions of individual regulated splicing events to differentiation programs is therefore of considerable interest.

It is of course well known from work of multiple labs that loss of PTBP1 induces PTBP2 expression during neuronal development. The program of splicing controlled by PTBP2 has been characterized in the mouse by ourselves and Licatalosi et al. However, the program controlled by PTBP1 has been difficult to define in mice due to embryonic lethality, and the other systems where PTBP1 has specifically been examined are not of clear relevance to actual neuronal development. There are studies of PTBP dependent exons in cell lines such as Hela, usually defined as responsive to double PTBP1/PTBP2 knockdown. There are the very interesting results from the Fu lab showing transdifferentiation of MEF and other cell lines into neuronal-like cells in response to PTBP1 knockdown. It is difficult to relate these results to normal neuronal development because MEFs do not express the same gene set as true pluripotent progenitor cells, and it is not clear whether their transdifferentiation goes through an NPC-like intermediate. The intent of our study was to define the targets of PTBP1 regulation within a well-characterized pathway of differentiation into actual neuronal progenitor cells and then into a defined neuronal cell type, motor neurons. Targets defined in this system can then be assessed relative to neuronal development in the animal. Indeed, we find that ESC do not simply differentiate into neurons upon loss of PTBP1, as was seen in MEFs. However, neuronal gene expression programs are clearly upregulated under these conditions. Since our last submission, Benjamin Blencowe has also published data examining PTBP1 expression in differentiating ESC. This paper (Gueroussov et al. 2015) shows a very nice profile of PTBP1 expression across differentiation, and then goes on to focus on activity differences between PTBP1 isoforms during neuronal differentiation rather than differences between PTBP1 and PTBP2. By comparing ESC cells to NPC, we have identified a set of exons that are more responsive to PTBP1 than PTBP2. These were difficult to identify in cell lines and in the mouse, and using these data we can now begin to examine how the PTBP1 and PTBP2 regulatory programs might differ. These exons are also a resource for those of us interested in mechanistic questions of how differential targeting by related splicing factors is achieved. Thus, these results provide an essential foundation not available from the prior work, both for the subsequent experiments in the paper that begin to analyze the PTBP1 program, and for many future studies."

We do not observe differences in DNA binding by Pbx1 between the mutant and wild type cells. This may not be surprising given that the DNA binding domain of the protein is not altered by the splicing change. We went on to perform ChIP-qPCR of the Meis1 and Prep1 co-factors for Pbx1. These are also seen to bind the target genes. In one case we see an increase in binding of the Meis1 cofactor on the target gene Hoxc5, when expression is shifted to the Pbx1a isoform.
