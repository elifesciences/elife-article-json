The forebrain knockout mice showed &gt;90% deletion of BMAL1 in the SCN and exhibited an immediate and complete loss of circadian behavior in constant conditions. Circadian rhythms in peripheral tissues persisted but became desynchronized and damped in constant darkness. The loss of synchrony was rescued by light/dark cycles and partially by restricted feeding (only in the liver and kidney but not in the other tissues) in a distinct manner. These results suggest that the forebrain/SCN is essential for internal temporal order of robust circadian programs in peripheral clocks, and that individual peripheral clocks are affected differently by light and feeding in the absence of a functional oscillator in the forebrain."

The forebrain knockout mice showed &gt;90% deletion of BMAL1 in the SCN and exhibited an immediate and complete loss of circadian behavior in constant conditions. Circadian rhythms in peripheral tissues persisted but became desynchronized and damped in constant darkness. The loss of synchrony was rescued by light/dark cycles and partially by restricted feeding (only in the liver and kidney but not in the other tissues) in a distinct manner. These results suggest that the forebrain/SCN is essential for internal temporal order of robust circadian programs in peripheral clocks, and that individual peripheral clocks are affected differently by light and feeding in the absence of a functional oscillator in the forebrain."

The circadian clock in the SCN as well as in other mammalian cells is composed of interacting positive- and negative-transcriptional and post-translational feedback loops involving <i>Clock</i> and <i>Bmal1</i> transcription factors and their target genes, <i>Period</i> (<i>Per1</i>, <i>2</i>, and <i>3</i>) and <i>Cryptochrome</i> (<i>Cry1</i> and <i>2</i>) (<a href=\"#bib30\">King et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Gekakis et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Hogenesch et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Kume et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Lee et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Lowrey and Takahashi, 2004</a>, <a href=\"#bib42\">2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Huang et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Mohawk et al., 2012</a>). Extensive evidence suggests that the SCN controls not only behavioral rhythms but also the circadian programs of peripheral tissues (<a href=\"#bib82\">Yoo et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Guo et al., 2005</a>, <a href=\"#bib23\">2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Saini et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Yamaguchi et al., 2013</a>).

To clarify the contribution of a central clock to the circadian rhythms of peripheral tissues, we sought to find a way to disable the molecular oscillators in the brain without affecting the genetic components in the rest of the body."

While this approach provides a powerful method to study the function of genes in vivo, it cannot be applied to genes that affect developmental or metabolic processes crucial for survival. Moreover, even if the knockout mice survive to adulthood, some lines suffer from systemic conditions and hence require special handling in experiments. For instance, although a global knock out of <i>Bmal1</i> (<i>Bmal1</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup>) completely eliminates circadian rhythms (<a href=\"#bib10\">Bunger et al., 2000</a>), the animals suffer from morbid conditions including arthropathy (<a href=\"#bib9\">Bunger et al., 2005</a>), sterility (<a href=\"#bib4\">Alvarez et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Boden et al., 2010</a>), defects in glucose homeostasis (<a href=\"#bib58\">Rudic et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Lamia et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Marcheva et al., 2010</a>), premature aging, and decreased lifespan [their average lifespan is 37 weeks (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kondratov et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Sun et al., 2006</a>)]. Possibly due to the pleiotropic effects of <i>Bmal1</i>, results of studies such as food entrainment behavior with <i>Bmal1</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mice have been controversial (<a href=\"#bib14\">Fuller et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Mistlberger et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Fuller et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Pendergast et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Storch and Weitz, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Mistlberger et al., 2009a</a>, <a href=\"#bib49\">2009b</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Mieda and Sakurai, 2011</a>). To circumvent these problems, conditional knockout techniques utilizing Cre recombinase and <i>loxP</i> sequences have been applied widely in the nervous system (<a href=\"#bib16\">Gav\u00e9riaux-Ruff and Kieffer, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Taniguchi et al., 2011</a>). However, until recently, Cre drivers that can efficiently recombine a floxed allele in the majority of SCN neurons have not been identified (<a href=\"#bib46\">Mieda and Sakurai, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Musiek et al., 2013</a> but see <a href=\"#bib27\">Husse et al., 2011</a>)."

The resulting knockout mice were devoid of BMAL1 expression in the forebrain/SCN but not in other peripheral tissues. Unlike <i>Bmal1</i> global knockout mice, <i>Bmal1</i> forebrain knockouts did not display detectable defects in reproduction, activity, body weight, or life span, thereby providing an ideal model to study circadian physiology in the absence of a central clock. These genetically engineered mice are better experimentally controlled than mice that receive SCN lesions, which is a classic method to induce arrhythmic behavior in rodents (<a href=\"#bib45\">Meijer and Rietveld, 1989</a>). With SCN lesions, precise removal of the SCN tissue varies from mouse to mouse and requires laborious confirmation of the excision. In addition, ablation of the SCN destroys neuronal networks and communication pathways, rendering the network responses and mechanisms incapacitated."

Cre-mediated excision of <i>Bmal1</i> in the forebrain/SCN confers complete arrhythmicity to circadian behavior. In contrast to the abolition of rhythms in the SCN, all peripheral tissues in these mice sustained circadian rhythmicity; however, they lacked phase coordination and normal amplitude in constant darkness. The synchrony and the oscillatory amplitude of peripheral rhythms in these mice were completely rescued by exposure to light dark cycles but not fully in time-restricted feeding experiments. The feeding cues appear to control the phase expression of the peripheral clocks in a tissue-specific way and in a distinct manner from light. These results demonstrate that an intact central clock plays an essential role in driving normal circadian behavior as well as synchronized and robust circadian programs in peripheral clocks and that light and feeding act on individual peripheral clocks differently in the absence of a functional oscillator in the SCN."

To generate a forebrain-specific knockout of circadian rhythms, we crossed floxed <i>Bmal1</i> (<i>Bmal1</i><sup><i>fx/fx</i></sup>) mice (<a href=\"#bib29\">Johnson et al., 2014</a>) to <i>Camk2a</i>::<i>iCre</i>BAC mice (<i>CamiCre</i> or Cre) (<a href=\"#bib11\">Casanova et al., 2001</a>) and produced <i>CamiCre+</i>; <i>Bmal1</i><sup><i>fx/fx</i></sup> (that we denote as \u2018Brain\u2019 Knockout, BKO, defined as a forebrain-specific knockout) as well as <i>Bmal1</i><sup><i>fx/fx</i></sup> (Fx/Fx), <i>CamiCre+</i> (Cre), and <i>CamiCre+</i>; <i>Bmal1</i><sup><i>fx/+</i></sup> (Het) control mice. <i>Camk2a</i>::<i>iCre</i>BAC mice were used because their Cre expression is faithful to the endogenous <i>Camk2a</i> gene expression pattern: it is neuron-specific, forebrain-enriched (<a href=\"#bib11\">Casanova et al., 2001</a>), and expressed highly in the SCN as observed in Cre-dependent fluorescence reporter mice, <i>CamiCre</i>+; <i>tdTom</i>+ (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A\u2013E</a>). Although there are more than 37 different <i>Camk2a::Cre</i> transgenic lines reported in Mouse Genome Informatics database (<a href=\"http://www.informatics.jax.org/searchtool/Search.do?query=Camk2a-cre%26page=featureList\">http://www.informatics.jax.org/searchtool/Search.do?query=Camk2a-cre&amp;page=featureList</a>), the majority do not appear to express well in the SCN (e.g., <a href=\"http://connectivity.brain-map.org/transgenic/experiment/81162458\">http://connectivity.brain-map.org/transgenic/experiment/81162458</a>), likely because of shorter promoter regulatory sequences and position effects. The other advantage of this Cre driver is that its Cre expression is post-natal and starts at P3 (<a href=\"#bib11\">Casanova et al., 2001</a>), thus reducing potential developmental effects. <i>Bmal1</i><sup><i>fx/fx</i></sup> mice were generated by inserting <i>loxP</i> sites into the introns surrounding exon 4, which codes for the DNA-binding bHLH domain (<a href=\"#bib29\">Johnson et al., 2014</a>). Upon Cre recombination, exon 4 is deleted in BKO brain tissues that express <i>Camk2a</i>::<i>iCre</i>. The predicted BMAL1 sequence encounters a STOP codon after a stretch of 18 non-native residues following native coding exon 3. The resulting protein is 91 amino acids long (vs 626 amino acids of native BMAL1) and is almost identical to the truncated BMAL1 protein of <i>Bmal1</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mice (<a href=\"#bib10\">Bunger et al., 2000</a>); both proteins contain no known functional domains and do not accumulate to a detectable level."

To further characterize the tissue specificity of the BKOs, we used Western blot analyses to measure BMAL1 protein levels in various brain and body tissues at ZT16 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1K,L</a>). In contrast to Fx/Fx and Cre controls, BMAL1 (\u223c69 kD) was detected only faintly in BKO frontal cortex and olfactory bulb (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1K</a>), likely due to glial and non-neuronal expression of BMAL1 since <i>Camk2a</i> is not expressed in glial cells (<a href=\"#bib40\">Lin et al., 1987</a>). Levels of BMAL1 in the cerebellum of BKOs were similar to Fx/Fx and Cre control mice (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1L</a>).

The activity patterns of Cre, Fx/Fx, and Het mice during the skeleton photoperiod were virtually indistinguishable from the activity patterns in LD 12:12 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). In contrast, none of the 10 BKO mice used in this study entrained normally to the skeleton photoperiod (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>): 3 BKO mice showed activity that resembled their activity in DD (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, <i>left</i>), 2 BKO mice displayed a bimodal activity pattern (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, <i>right</i>), and 5 BKO mice exhibited activity that was intermediate between these two phenotypes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, <i>middle</i>). Unlike control mice, BKO mice distributed their running activity equally between the subjective day and the subjective night of the skeleton photoperiod (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,D</a>). In fact, controls spent 97.9% of their activity during the skeleton night, compared to only 52.5% for BKO mice (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). The amount of activity that BKOs spent during skeleton day vs night was not significantly different. This type of abnormal entrainment to skeleton photoperiods is reminiscent of the entrainment behavior of pinealectomized sparrows, which behave as a population of circadian oscillators that entrain with two opposite phase relationships to the skeleton photoperiod (<a href=\"#bib70\">Takahashi and Menaker, 1982</a>). Therefore, we conclude that entrainment in <i>Bmal1</i> brain knockout mice is abnormal under skeleton photoperiods, consistent with the idea that the coherence of phase during entrainment may be compromised. Overall this suggests that the periodicity seen in LD 12:12 in BKOs arises from entrainment of a population of driven oscillators in which phase control is labile."

Thus BKOs failed to mask during the first 30 min of the light phases. Plotting actograms on a 7-hr time scale aids in visualization of this masking impairment in BKOs (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). These entrainment and masking studies led us to conclude that BKOs lack an endogenous clock but also exhibit some impaired masking."

Compared with the robust oscillation of the control SCN, the SCN of BKOs exhibited blunted expression patterns with low-amplitude but detectable rhythms, which were close to 24 hr (23.54 \u00b1 0.29 hr in Fx/Fx control SCN vs 22.99 \u00b1 2.36 hr in BKO SCN for mean period length \u00b1 SD, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). These rhythms are likely to be derived from glial cells and/or residual neurons in which Cre-mediated excision of floxed <i>Bmal1</i> was incomplete (see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1J</a>) or possibly from residual stochastic oscillations that we have observed in the SCN of global <i>Bmal1</i> knockouts (<a href=\"#bib31\">Ko et al., 2010</a>). Rhythmic expression in the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH) in BKOs was also significantly attenuated. In contrast to the SCN and DMH, peripheral tissues retained persistent circadian rhythms (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), consistent with the normal expression of BMAL1 in peripheral tissues (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1K</a>)."

For the SCN and DMH in which <i>Bmal1</i> is deleted from the majority of neurons, only residual amplitude was detected (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>). Likewise, the amplitude of the pituitary was lower in BKOs from LD, which was likely due to the partial deletion of BMAL1 (see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1K</a>). This decrease was further pronounced when BKO pituitary was harvested from DD (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>). For all other peripheral tissues, the relative amplitude was significantly decreased when a light-driven signal was removed from BKOs in DD, but the severe reduction was not observed in BKOs from LD (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>, except for liver).

The size of the grid was narrowed down to 40 \u00b5m \u00d7 40 \u00b5m. Circadian rhythms in the brightest 200 grids were aligned in the order of expression intensity in a heat map (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). Consistent with the organotypic recording by LumiCycle luminometry (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>), the heart cells from a wild-type mouse exhibited robust oscillation, while those from a BKO displayed damped rhythms with broader phase distribution. The damped rhythms were also clear in a linear graph in which the top 50 time-series were plotted (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F,G</a>). Amplitude analysis of these 50 time-series data showed that the oscillatory amplitude was significantly reduced within the grids in the BKO heart sample (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6H</a>). Furthermore, their phases were significantly dispersed (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6I</a>). These results suggest that the amplitude decrease in the BKO tissue is caused by a combined effect of amplitude reduction and phase desynchrony at the cellular level."

Horizontal black and white bars represent lights off and on, respectively. Gray bars represent food availability. Since abrupt shifts to FR can have a high morbidity in mice, a gentle temporal FR paradigm was used (FR ramp), decreasing the duration of daily food availability from constant to a final 4 hr window over the course of 5 days. Because free-running in DD can obscure FAA in control mice, we obtained DD baseline activity and then switched mice to 14 days of LD (not shown). We then transferred our mice directly from LD into DD FR following an LD food ramp (<i>lower</i>).

Notably, the mean FAA profiles of BKOs were enhanced in DD during temporal food restriction (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C,G</a>), and the total daily activity levels in BKOs during FR were significantly higher (almost two-fold higher) than those of controls, despite the observation that BKOs exhibited a trend to eat less during FR (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Surprisingly, FAA profiles showed that, during FR in DD, BKOs had extended activity for up to 15 hr before food availability, while controls allocated most of their activity to the 6-hr window of FAA (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F,G</a>). Another study has found similarly longer FAA in <i>Bmal1</i>-deficient mice (<a href=\"#bib71\">Takasu et al., 2012</a>). To further characterize the food-anticipatory behavior, we measured the time course over which FAA emerged in BKOs and controls after the start of food restriction. We found FAA development to be similar in the two genotypes under both LD and DD conditions. FAA appeared after about 2 days and reached a plateau after about 4 days in both genotypes (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D,H</a>). The mean time by which FAA anticipated the daily onset of food (phase angle with respect to food presentation) was not significantly different between the two genotypes during FR in LD (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>). During FR in DD, the random activity in BKOs partially obscured their FAA; however, FAA was still recognizable above the baseline both in individual records (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>) and in the population activity profile (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7G</a>). This activity change was statistically significant (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7I</a>). Therefore, behavioral responses to temporal food restriction in BKOs were enhanced in DD."

To examine <i>Bmal1</i> deletion and <i>Per2</i> gene expression at this anatomical site, we conducted in situ analysis on the DMH. We collected brains at CT6 and CT18 on the third day of <i>ad lib</i> feeding in DD. Controls showed high expression levels of <i>Bmal1</i> mRNA in the DMH, albeit with no circadian fluctuation. On the other hand, BKOs had no significant <i>Bmal1</i> mRNA in the DMH at either time point (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Despite a complete lack of <i>Bmal1</i> in the DMH, BKOs exhibited normal FAA, indicating that <i>Bmal1</i> in the DMH is not necessary for food entrainment.

However, when the peak phases were converted to the circadian time of the animal at harvest, the phases in a majority of tissues examined (except for pituitary and liver) became markedly clustered (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E,G</a>; <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 8\u2014source data 1A</a>), suggesting that the circadian rhythms in many peripheral tissues in wild-type mice are still dictated by the signals from the intact central clock. On the other hand, the peripheral tissues of BKOs showed distinct changes in phase expression patterns in response to restricted feeding cues (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8F</a>). Although BKOs exhibited prolonged pre-feeding activity in DD (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>; <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>), only the liver and kidney showed tightly clustered phases (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8G</a>; <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 8\u2014source data 1A</a>). Other tissues (heart, lung, spleen) were variable in phase, though their phase distribution was different either from that found in an <i>ad libitum</i> condition (see also <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>) or from those in Fx/Fx (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8G</a>, <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 8\u2014source data 1A</a>). These results suggest that feeding cues differentially entrain peripheral clocks; FR strongly synchronizes circadian clocks in the liver and kidney but has weaker effects on other peripheral tissues such as the pituitary, heart, lung, and spleen."

In this study, we succeeded in removing <i>Bmal1</i> specifically from the forebrain using a <i>Camk2a::iCre</i>BAC line (<a href=\"#bib11\">Casanova et al., 2001</a>). Notably, this <i>CamiCre</i> driver was able to efficiently recombine and delete our target floxed gene in the entire SCN. These forebrain/SCN-specific <i>Bmal1</i> knockouts exhibited a total loss of circadian behavioral rhythmicity, and their circadian phenotype in DD and LL is similar to that of global <i>Bmal1</i> knockouts (<a href=\"#bib10\">Bunger et al., 2000</a>). Thus, <i>Bmal1</i> in the forebrain is essential for normal circadian activity rhythms.

Second, there is a delay in masking behavior to light under LD 3.5:3.5 which is similar to that seen in <i>Clock</i> mutants (<a href=\"#bib57\">Redlin et al., 2005</a>).

Using the forebrain <i>Bmal1</i>-deficient animals, we were able to conduct food restriction experiments under completely standard conditions. In contrast to global <i>Bmal1</i> knockouts, altered experimental conditions such as enriched liquid food (<a href=\"#bib66\">Storch and Weitz, 2009</a>), LD 18:6 (<a href=\"#bib55\">Pendergast et al., 2009</a>), or food placed on the cage bottom, and gentle handling to prompt feeding (<a href=\"#bib14\">Fuller et al., 2008</a>) were not required for these mice. Our results show that BKOs indeed displayed normal FAA as other studies using global <i>Bmal1</i> knockouts have reported (<a href=\"#bib50\">Mistlberger et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Pendergast et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Storch and Weitz, 2009</a>), demonstrating that BMAL1 in the forebrain is not essential for food entrainment behavior. Specifically, our <i>Bmal1</i> in situ results in the DMH indicate that the DMH is not necessary for FAA as reported previously (<a href=\"#bib37\">Landry et al., 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib38\">2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Moriya et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Acosta-Galvan et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Landry et al., 2011</a>). In our experiments, BKOs tend to exhibit intact food-anticipatory behavior under constant darkness conditions. However, overall activity of BKO's circadian behavior was also significantly elevated in DD, which makes it difficult to distinguish whether the elevated pre-feeding activity is due to enhanced FAA or to the effect of overall activity increase. Nevertheless, these results suggest that an inhibitory system (<a href=\"#bib13\">Davis and Menaker, 1980</a>) suppresses the total activity of both circadian behavior and FAA. It remains to be determined what factors underlie suppression of the activity and how their regulation in the SCN and other brain regions is altered by the deletion of BMAL1."

While peripheral oscillators can be uncoupled from the central clock in the SCN, recent studies have suggested that SCN-derived signals counteract the feeding cues for rapid phase-shifting of peripheral clocks (<a href=\"#bib59\">Saini et al., 2013</a>) and that phase-shifting rates are variable among different tissues (<a href=\"#bib12\">Damiola et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Yamazaki et al., 2000</a>). Consistent with these observations, peripheral tissues in our control mice displayed variable phases relative to the FR schedule when conducted in constant darkness (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a>). In these free-running conditions, the circadian activity rhythms of the mice were not affected by FR; and as a consequence, the phase relationships between the FR schedule and circadian phase could be dissociated. When control mice in DD under <i>ad libitum</i> conditions were compared to control mice in DD under FR using circadian phase as a marker, the liver, kidney and heart significantly shifted their mean circular phase in response to feeding, showing an effect of FR on these tissues [<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>, compare Fx/Fx from DD with Fx/Fx from DD + FR (in CT); <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 9\u2014source data 1A</a>]. However, the phases of the peripheral rhythms were significantly clustered with the phase of the activity rhythm (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E</a>), strongly suggesting that signals from the SCN continue to dictate the expression of peripheral phases in wild-type mice despite the expression of FAA behavior. Indeed, only the liver was strongly clustered in phase with FR in DD (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8G</a>, Fx/Fx from DD + FR) compared to the circadian phase of activity [<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8G</a>, Fx/Fx from DD + FR (in CT)] in which all peripheral tissues were clustered in phase.

We speculate that, while feeding cues can antagonize SCN-derived signals, LD cycles appear to act in concert with the SCN or signals arising from the SCN. Although detailed pathways through which the SCN controls the peripheral clocks remain unknown, recently, SRF was identified as a transcription factor that regulates gene expression in peripheral tissues in response to systemically oscillating signals (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gerber et al., 2013</a>). It will be interesting to explore how these signals affect circadian gene expression in vivo to determine the mechanisms by which the SCN communicates with peripheral oscillators. Our experiments reveal the diverse behavioral and peripheral physiological consequences of inactivating a forebrain clock. They pave the way for further exploring the complex relationship between central and peripheral clocks."

Coronal sections of the brain were sliced at 300-\u03bcm thickness by a vibratome in ice-cold Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS, Invitrogen). Each individual SCN was dissected out and cultured on a Millicell organotypic membrane (PICM ORG50, Millipore, Billerica, MA) in a 35 mm tissue culture dish containing 1.2 ml DMEM (90-013-PB, Mediatech, Manassas, VA), supplemented with 2% B27 (Invitrogen), 10 mM Hepes (pH 7.2), 4 mM L-glutamine, 0.035% sodium bicarbonate, 25 units/ml penicillin, 25 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin, and 0.1 mM luciferin (L-8240, Biosynth AG, Staad, Switzerland). Other tissues were processed as previously described (<a href=\"#bib81\">Yamazaki and Takahashi, 2005</a>) and cultured as above. The bioluminescence was monitored by a light-tight 32-channel LumiCycle luminometry (Actimetrics, Wilmette, IL) maintained at 36\u00b0C and was recorded at an interval of 10-min continuously for a minimum of 8 days followed by medium change to confirm the viability of the samples."

Briefly, raw data of bioluminescence records were corrected for background counts and PMT gain. For animals harvested from a DD condition (30\u201344 days in DD), activity onset of each Fx/Fx control mouse was set as CT12. The time-series data were detrended by a 24-hr running average and then subjected to FFT-NLLS analysis to calculate periods and phases. The initial 20 hr of data were trimmed because they contain an acute effect of explant preparation. Data beyond 192 hr before medium change were also trimmed except for one group (1 Fx/Fx control and 1 BKO), which was affected by an electrical shutdown on day 6. The amplitude was computed at a 36\u201360 hr range and normalized as previously described (<a href=\"#bib28\">Izumo et al., 2006</a>). For all data, the calculations were averaged where duplicated samples were prepared from the same tissue within an individual mouse, and the averaged value was used to map or calculate for all mice collected. Samples with RelAmp Error \u22650.84 (background counts) or out of a circadian (17\u201331 hr) range (24 hr \u00b1 30% of 24 hr) in the periodicity were excluded from the analysis. A total of 1106 LumiCycle files were processed and used in this study. To construct a phase map, smoothed time-series were used to determine the peak on the second day. Phase angles and circular variances of circular plots were computed using Oriana (Kovach Computing Services, Wales, UK). The variance of the peak phases between two groups was compared using bootstrap analysis (<a href=\"#bib62\">Sato et al., 2007</a>). For each iteration of the bootstrap, the difference of the variance between the two groups was calculated by random sampling with replacement from the data within the each of the two groups. Following 20,000 iterations, ninety-five percent confidence intervals were used to determine whether the differences were significantly different from zero."

The tissue collection was repeated for a total of three pairs of mice. The tissues were processed and prepared in the same manner as in the luminometry recording, except that a glass bottom culture dish (MatTek, Ashland, MA) was used. The sealed culture was placed onto the stage chamber maintained at 36\u00b0C inside the LV200 Bioluminescence Imaging System (Olympus America, Irving, TX). The sample was imaged using a 10\u00d7 objective lens with 10-min exposure time at 25-min interval for 7 days. The imaging files were converted to linear time-series by quantifying the signals on grid matrices. The heat map was generated using the top 200 time-series data starting with the strongest signals. The top 50 of these time-series data were analyzed for period, phase, and relative amplitude by FFT-NLLS as described above. The phases calculated by FFT-NLLS were further converted to the actual time and divided by each circadian period to normalize period differences. Statistical analysis was conducted between paired mice as described above."

In constant darkness, these mice are behaviorally arrhythmic, while their peripheral clocks were still oscillating, albeit in a desynchronized way as compared to control mice."

Because the temporal organization of peripheral clocks in KO mice exposed to a light-dark cycle (LD) matches remarkably that in SCN-functional control mice (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>), this indicates that the direct effects of light cues given by LD are sufficient to maintain temporal organization in peripheral clocks (i.e., light cues do not rescue any defect in KO mice). Based on the immediate behavioral arrhythmicity after transfer to DD, while the rhythmicity is apparent under regular LD, there is no obvious reason to speak of weak entrainment to light in KO mice. The apparent rhythmicity under LD is likely due to direct effects of daily exposure to 12 hours of light per cycle. A recent study using Syt10(Cre) driver to alter the clock in the SCN has shown that timing in a peripheral clock (i.e., adrenal gland) can be maintained by exposure to LD (Husse et al. 2014 FASEB J). If really the authors consider that light rescues temporal organization of peripheral clocks in KO mice without involving masking effects of light, they should prove it by investigating such temporal organization in KO mice exposed to lighting conditions that maintain entrainment of the suprachiasmatic nuclei, while limiting the masking effects of light, such as a skeletal photoperiod (as used here for behavioral measurements shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>) or daily 1 h light pulses followed by 23 h of darkness."

The authors' conclusion is based on data converted in circadian times for control mice, and compared to data expressed according to Zeitgeber (feeding) time in KO mice. Even with data conversion, phase dispersion in KO mice is not different for the pituitary, liver and kidney. The question here is to investigate the synchronizing effects of feeding in DD and because it is not possible to convert data of KO mice in circadian times, data from both fx/fx and KO mice should be compared according to feeding time. The results will probably lead to the conclusion that feeding cues have synchronizing effects in KO mice, at least not worst, and maybe better than in control mice with functional SCN.

This conclusion is summarized in the Discussion section, by statements that light appears to be a stronger entraining signal than feeding cues for most peripheral clocks, and that the SCN plays a 'critical' role in actively sustaining internal synchronization. I would argue that this representation of the results is not quite accurate, and that the conclusion is overstated, for the following reasons:"

The statement of the results in the Abstract should be revised to acknowledge that loss of synchrony was rescued by restricted feeding in the liver and kidney, but only partially in the other tissues. Synchrony among peripheral tissues requires central bmal1 dependent clocks, while synchrony of individual tissues to a feeding schedule may not require central clocks."

Relative strength has already been established by studies of intact animals; when food is restricted to the daytime, peripheral clocks uncouple from LD and SCN and shift to align with mealtime. There may be conditions under which light is more effective than feeding, for some tissues (possibly the minority, pending further study), but references to relative strength of food and light should be avoided, or stated in a more nuanced fashion."

Presumably, hypothetical bmal1-dependent FEOs (in PVN, DMH, arcuate, brainstem?) communicating with peripheral organs would have to be distinct from FEOs responsible for food anticipatory behavioral rhythms, given that the behavioral rhythms were quite robust in the BKOs."

The LD cycle in BKO mice drives a daily rhythm of activity and presumably feeding, and the effects of light may be mediated by stimuli associated with these behaviors. Indeed, it would not be surprising if the heart and lung circadian clocks are regulated by various systemic effects of wheel running (exercise); the phase of those clocks may be regulated by the timing of behavior. FAA in DD was much longer in duration in the BKO mice, and that might explain the lower degree of synchrony of heart and lung clocks during restricted feeding in those mice. I would recommend briefly noting this as a potential mechanism."

This conclusion is summarized in the Discussion section, by statements that light appears to be a stronger entraining signal than feeding cues for most peripheral clocks, and that the SCN plays a 'critical' role in actively sustaining internal synchronization.

The LD cycle in BKO mice drives a daily rhythm of activity and presumably feeding, and the effects of light may be mediated by stimuli associated with these behaviors. Indeed, it would not be surprising if the heart and lung circadian clocks are regulated by various systemic effects of wheel running (exercise); the phase of those clocks may be regulated by the timing of behavior. FAA in DD was much longer in duration in the BKO mice, and that might explain the lower degree of synchrony of heart and lung clocks during restricted feeding in those mice.
