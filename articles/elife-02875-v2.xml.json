Here, we show that distinct subpopulations of astral microtubules exist, which have differential functions in regulating spindle orientation and division symmetry. Specifically, in polarized stem cells of developing mouse neocortex, astral microtubules reaching the apical and basal cell cortex, but not those reaching the central cell cortex, are more abundant in symmetrically than asymmetrically dividing cells and reduce spindle orientation variability. This promotes symmetric divisions by maintaining an apico-basal cleavage plane. The greater abundance of apical/basal astrals depends on a higher concentration, at the basal cell cortex, of LGN, a known spindle-cell cortex linker. Furthermore, newly developed specific microtubule perturbations that selectively decrease apical/basal astrals recapitulate the symmetric-to-asymmetric division switch and suffice to increase neurogenesis in vivo. Thus, our study identifies a novel link between cell polarity, astral microtubules, and spindle orientation in morphogenesis."

Here, we show that distinct subpopulations of astral microtubules exist, which have differential functions in regulating spindle orientation and division symmetry. Specifically, in polarized stem cells of developing mouse neocortex, astral microtubules reaching the apical and basal cell cortex, but not those reaching the central cell cortex, are more abundant in symmetrically than asymmetrically dividing cells and reduce spindle orientation variability. This promotes symmetric divisions by maintaining an apico-basal cleavage plane. The greater abundance of apical/basal astrals depends on a higher concentration, at the basal cell cortex, of LGN, a known spindle-cell cortex linker. Furthermore, newly developed specific microtubule perturbations that selectively decrease apical/basal astrals recapitulate the symmetric-to-asymmetric division switch and suffice to increase neurogenesis in vivo. Thus, our study identifies a novel link between cell polarity, astral microtubules, and spindle orientation in morphogenesis."

However, in the primary stem cells of the mammalian brain, subtle off-vertical tilting suffices for asymmetric divisions to occur. This tilting must be finely regulated: if not, neurodevelopmental disorders, such as microcephaly and lissencephaly, may arise."

Cell division symmetry is controlled by orienting the metaphase spindle along a specific plane. Cytokinesis then segregates cell components symmetrically or asymmetrically, depending on their distribution on either side of that plane. Pioneering work in fungi and nematodes has shown spindle orientation to involve mitotic astral microtubules. These astrals dynamically link the spindle poles with the cell cortex (<a href=\"#bib49\">Pearson and Bloom, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Siller and Doe, 2009</a>)."

A classic example is <i>Drosophila</i> neurogenesis, where neuroepithelial cells proliferate by dividing symmetrically, with a cleavage plane parallel to the apico-basal axis. Neuroblasts derived from them delaminate from the apical surface and divide in turn asymmetrically, to self-renew and produce neurogenic progenitors. The mitotic spindle in these asymmetric divisions is re-oriented by 90\u00b0, with the cleavage plane now perpendicular to the apico-basal axis. This leads to the asymmetric distribution of polarized fate-determinants to the daughter cells (<a href=\"#bib63\">Southall et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Sousa-Nunes et al., 2010</a>). This major spindle re-orientation in <i>Drosophila</i> requires interactions between cell cortical G\u03b1i, a heterotrimeric G protein subunit, and Partner of Inscuteable (Pins), which are in turn linked to the Par polarity complex (Par3, Par6, aPKC) by Inscuteable (<a href=\"#bib28\">Knoblich, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Brand and Livesey, 2011</a>)."

Mammalian neurogenesis, however, shows major differences to <i>Drosophila</i> with regard to spindle orientation in symmetric vs asymmetric divisions of polarized neural stem cells. In the developing neocortex, neuroepithelial cells progressively become radial glia, and both of these highly related subtypes of neural stem cells exhibit a characteristic polarized, apico-basal architecture and undergo apical mitosis, hence the collective term \u2018apical progenitors\u2019 (APs) (<a href=\"#bib35\">Kriegstein and G\u00f6tz, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">G\u00f6tz and Huttner, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Miller and Gauthier, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Corbin et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Martynoga et al., 2012</a>). Importantly, the switch of APs from symmetric proliferative to asymmetric neurogenic divisions occurs mostly without large and defined re-orientations of the spindle, but with only subtle deviations (<a href=\"#bib26\">Huttner and Brand, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Haydar et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Kosodo et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Konno et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Shitamukai et al., 2011</a>). These can nonetheless tilt the division plane enough to no longer bisect, but rather bypass the small apical end-foot, leading to its asymmetric distribution (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kosodo et al., 2004</a>). Similarly, subtle spindle deviations can also influence the inheritance of the basal process (<a href=\"#bib57\">Shitamukai et al., 2011</a>, see also <a href=\"#bib33\">Kosodo et al., 2008</a>). The proper regulation of these symmetry changes is thought to be an important determinant in neocortical neurogenesis (<a href=\"#bib22\">G\u00f6tz and Huttner, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Kriegstein and Alvarez-Buylla, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Miyata et al., 2010</a>), and its perturbation can lead to neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders (<a href=\"#bib16\">Feng and Walsh, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Fish et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Yingling et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Gauthier-Fisher et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Godin et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Lizarraga et al., 2010</a>)."

Despite these findings, it remains to be elucidated how alterations in these or other spindle regulators actually lead to the spindle orientation changes that switch the cell division mode of APs (<a href=\"#bib7\">Buchman and Tsai, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Lancaster and Knoblich, 2012</a>)."

Specifically, a decrease in apical/basal astrals causes the subtle spindle orientation deviations that lead to the switch of mammalian APs from symmetric proliferative to asymmetric neurogenic divisions. Moreover, we find that a selective down-regulation of LGN at the basal cell cortex, rather than a general reduction of cell cortical LGN, explains the specific decrease in apical/basal astrals. Our study, which combines live and immunofluorescence microscopy of neocortical tissue from transgenic mice, provides a new model for the control of symmetric vs asymmetric cell division in cells that maintain spindle orientation perpendicular to the apico-basal axis, such as cortical neural stem cells."

Crucially however, whether such deviations are different in proliferating vs neurogenic progenitors is unknown. To ask if the amplitude of spindle deviations is involved in neurogenesis, a transgenic mouse was used where neurogenic divisions are identified by EGFP driven by the promoter of the pan-neurogenic marker Tis21 (<a href=\"#bib27\">Iacopetti et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Haubensak et al., 2004</a>) and thereby distinguished from proliferative divisions. Specifically, embryonic day (E) 14.5 mouse dorsolateral telencephalon in organotypic slice culture stained with a vital DNA dye was analysed by dual-colour live 3D imaging. Consistent with previous studies, the metaphase spindles of most progenitors, as reported by the chromosome plates, continuously changed their angles with respect to the apical\u2013basal axis until anaphase, and did so in apparently random fashion. Interestingly, these dynamic deviations increased in amplitude from Tis21::GFP\u2013 (proliferating) AP divisions to Tis21::GFP+ (neurogenic) AP divisions (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B,D,E</a>; <a href=\"#media1\">Videos 1,2</a>). In neurogenic APs, the total amplitude of deviations was on average twice as high as in proliferating APs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>; AP proliferating 15.7 \u00b1 1.4\u00b0, AP neurogenic 30.7 \u00b1 4.3\u00b0). Importantly, the range of metaphase spindle orientations (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D,E</a>) was consistent with the previously reported cleavage plane orientations of fixed (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kosodo et al., 2004</a>) and live (<a href=\"#bib31\">Konno et al., 2008</a>) mouse APs, which have been observed to be mostly perpendicular to the apical surface."

Mouse BPs also lack the canonical apical\u2013basal polarity features of APs (<a href=\"#bib4\">Attardo et al., 2008</a>) and mostly undergo terminal divisions that produce two neurons (<a href=\"#bib24\">Haubensak et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Miyata et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Noctor et al., 2004</a>). Compared to proliferating APs, neurogenic BPs showed deviations of the metaphase plate axis from the apical\u2013basal axis of the developing cortical wall that were even greater than those of neurogenic APs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,F</a>; <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>). The total amplitude of deviations in BPs increased to 38.3 \u00b1 5.6\u00b0 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>). Importantly, the range of metaphase spindle orientations (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>) was consistent with the highly variable cleavage plane orientation of mouse BPs reported previously (<a href=\"#bib24\">Haubensak et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Attardo et al., 2008</a>). This leads to the conclusion that metaphase spindle orientation variability increases as progenitors become neurogenic. Interestingly, this variability is characteristic of both, neurogenic APs that divide asymmetrically with a cleavage plane largely parallel to the apical\u2013basal tissue axis, and of neurogenic BPs which divide symmetrically with a near-random cleavage plane orientation."

LGN is enriched in the cell cortex, especially around the central part of the cell, where it participates in spindle orientation in non-neural cells in vitro (<a href=\"#bib13\">Du and Macara, 2004</a>). Also, upon LGN perturbation in neural progenitors in vivo, spindle orientation variability increased, changing progenitor identity (<a href=\"#bib45\">Morin et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Konno et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Shitamukai et al., 2011</a>). How LGN regulates spindle orientation in neurogenesis remains unknown. LGN could control spindle orientation in neural progenitors by regulating the number of astrals that anchor the spindle to the cell cortex. Therefore, the higher spindle orientation variability observed upon LGN perturbation could be caused by fewer apical/basal astrals. Indeed, in the E14.5 neocortex of LGN knock-out (KO) mice (<a href=\"#bib31\">Konno et al., 2008</a>) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013D</a>), fewer apical/basal astrals were found in APs of homozygous compared to heterozygous mice (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>; homozygous 8.4 \u00b1 0.5, heterozygous 11.2 \u00b1 0.7). By contrast, no significant reduction was seen in the central astrals (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>; homozygous 9.1 \u00b1 0.5, heterozygous 8.9 \u00b1 0.3, similar to unperturbed APs; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2I</a>). No significant change was observed in BPs either (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>; homozygous 5.9 \u00b1 0.4, heterozygous 6.4 \u00b1 0.4), where the number of apically/basally oriented astrals was also similar to unperturbed BPs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a>)."

LGN-C has the GoLoco motifs that bind to G\u03b1i at the cell cortex, and its overexpression saturates the G\u03b1i anchoring sites for microtubules. However, it lacks the TPR motifs in the N-terminal region and cannot interact with microtubules via NuMA and dynein (<a href=\"#bib45\">Morin et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Shitamukai et al., 2011</a>). APs overexpressing 6Myc-LGN-wt or 6Myc-LGN-C showed staining mostly around the basolateral cell cortex (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4I,J</a>), similar to previous LGN stainings (<a href=\"#bib31\">Konno et al., 2008</a>). Consistent with our LGN-KO mouse results, APs overexpressing LGN-C also showed a significant reduction in apical/basal astrals at E14.5 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4J,K</a>, 7.9 \u00b1 0.5), similar to LGN KO homozygous mouse APs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). By contrast, APs in the electroporated area that were either non-electroporated or overexpressing LGN-wt had a similar number of apical/basal astrals (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H,I,K</a>, 11.0 \u00b1 0.6 and 11.2 \u00b1 0.4) as unperturbed (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a>) or LGN-KO heterozygous (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>) APs. Together, these results show that LGN perturbations lead to a reduction specifically in apical/basal astrals, likely through reduced anchoring of astrals to the cell cortex."

To test this, the distribution of LGN was analysed in different progenitors. No major differences in overall levels of LGN immunoreactivity were observed, but the subcellular distribution of the signal was different between proliferating and neurogenic E14.5 APs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013C</a>). In proliferating APs, cortical LGN increased from the apical to the central region of the cell cortex and remained high in most of the central and basal regions (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,E</a>). In neurogenic APs, cortical LGN levels were similar to proliferating APs at the apical and central regions, but markedly lower at the basal region (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,E</a>). These data show that neurogenic APs lose LGN enrichment in the basal region of the cell cortex, which could lead to less anchoring of basal astrals. Consistent with this, the strongest decrease in astrals of APs was in the basal region of neurogenic progenitors (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2J</a>). A more modest but significant decrease in astrals in the apical region was also observed, yet the levels of apical LGN remained low in all progenitors. This suggests that additional factors may contribute to spindle orientation stability at the apical side."

This suggests that the stabilization of spindle orientation variability produced by an increase in apical/basal astrals is specific of APs. This difference is not fully unexpected. BPs are substantially different to APs, as they have delaminated from the apical surface and therefore lack canonical apical\u2013basal polarity features of APs (<a href=\"#bib4\">Attardo et al., 2008</a>). A consequence of this polarity loss is that, regardless of their mitotic cleavage orientation, most mouse BPs undergo terminal divisions, which are symmetric in that two neurons are produced (although the neurons could be of different type) (<a href=\"#bib24\">Haubensak et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Miyata et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Noctor et al., 2004</a>). Therefore, changes in spindle orientation are not predicted to significantly change the symmetry or outcome of BP divisions. Consistent with our results, it is thus plausible that BPs may naturally be less responsive to the microtubule and spindle changes that are here described as key for APs."

This is consistent with a model where a simple increase in the sub-population of apical/basal astrals is not enough and these astrals must be anchored to the cell cortex in order to exert a stabilizing effect on spindle orientation."

An established assay was adapted to determine the proportion of symmetric vs asymmetric divisions with respect to the distribution of the apical domain, identified by the absence of cadherin staining (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kosodo et al., 2004</a>). The previously published low percentage of asymmetric divisions was confirmed with BRO culture in controls (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9H</a> top bar, white = 12%). However, with 30 pM nocodazole, the proportion of asymmetric divisions in proliferating APs increased to a level similar to control neurogenic divisions (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9H</a>, second and third bar, white = 60% vs 62%). Nocodazole at 30 pM did not increase much the proportion of asymmetric divisions in neurogenic APs (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9H</a> bottom bar, white = 69%), showing that this nocodazole concentration mostly influences the division symmetry of proliferating APs. Together, these data show that 30 pM nocodazole is sufficient to induce mitotic proliferating APs to behave as neurogenic ones with respect to the number of apical/basal astrals (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A\u2013F</a>), spindle orientation variability (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A\u2013E</a>), and cell division symmetry (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9F\u2013H</a>)."

(<b>J</b>) Conceptual model of mitotic spindle orientation control by local astral microtubule abundance, in proliferating vs neurogenic progenitors. We propose that mitotic astral microtubules that reach the apical or basal cell cortex (light green rods) of neural stem and progenitor cells regulate the dynamics of spindle orientation variability. Like guy ropes do for a camping tent, these astrals help anchor the spindle to the cell cortex, most likely through interactions with factors that have specific cortical enrichments, such as LGN (red; colour intensity indicates local abundance in the three progenitor types shown). In APs undergoing proliferative division (Tis21::GFP\u2013), these apical/basal astrals at relatively high abundance minimize deviations in spindle orientation, thereby maintaining the canonical cleavage orientation, perpendicular to the apical (ventricular) surface, and thus favouring symmetric proliferative divisions. In neurogenic (Tis21::GFP+) APs, and even more so in BPs, a reduction in the number of these astrals decreases cortical anchoring and increases random deviations in spindle orientation. For APs, this favours asymmetric neurogenic divisions that can generate a BP or a neuron. By contrast, astrals that reach the central cell cortex (medium green rods) of neural progenitors may be more involved in the fundamental establishment of a centrally located and functional bipolar spindle that can congress, and then faithfully segregate, chromosomes. (Dark green rods are kinetochore microtubules; for simplicity, other microtubule populations, such as interpolar microtubules, are omitted.)"

Strikingly, this reduction in astrals is not homogeneous, but happens only in the astrals that reach the basal and apical cell cortex. This shows that a distinct subpopulation of astrals, the apical/basal astrals, governs spindle orientation."

The reduction in apical/basal astrals shown here generated more newborn Tbr2-positive BPs in the VZ and mitotic BPs in the SVZ.

Nevertheless, these newborn Tis21::GFP-positive BPs, generated by just tilting the spindle, may still temporarily exhibit certain AP features, such as an AP-like cell cycle length, which is shorter than that of mature BPs (<a href=\"#bib2\">Arai et al., 2011</a>). These newborn BPs may therefore undergo mitosis soon after arrival in the SVZ, which would explain its increased mitoses without a significant increase in Tbr2-positive interphase cells. A shorter than normal cell cycle of the BPs generated by minimal nocodazole would also be consistent with the newborn neurons increasingly observed after 24 hr of this treatment being derived not only directly from the asymmetrically dividing APs, but also indirectly from these BPs."

This study aimed at specifically perturbing spindle orientation while avoiding other effects. For this, a minimal concentration of the highly specific microtubule polymerization inhibitor nocodazole was identified that was several orders of magnitude lower than previously used in spindle studies. This minimal nocodazole decreased only the number of apical/basal astrals, those detected to change when APs switch from proliferation to neurogenesis, but did not affect other types of microtubules, notably the central astrals. This suggests that these astrals are more sensitive to depolymerisation, perhaps due to being highly dynamic. Moreover, this decrease was titrated to the physiological level observed in unperturbed neurogenic APs, and other effects, notably on progenitor and spindle features, mitotic morphology, and progression, were not detected. Consistent with this, a similarly low concentration of the specific microtubule stabilizer taxol showed the opposite effect, increasing the number of apical/basal astrals. Therefore, treatment with minimal concentrations of compounds acting specifically on microtubules constitutes an alternative approach to genetic manipulations, allowing direct probing of spindle orientation per se and of the symmetry of cell division in tissue."

Mammalian LGN has been shown to participate in the anchoring of the spindle to the cell cortex in cultured MDCK cells, as part of a complex with NuMA and dynein, by mediating the attachment of astrals to cell cortical G\u03b1i subunits (<a href=\"#bib13\">Du and Macara, 2004</a>). Consistent with this role, previous studies showed that LGN is important for normal cleavage plane and symmetric AP divisions in the mouse (<a href=\"#bib31\">Konno et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Shitamukai et al., 2011</a>) and the chick (<a href=\"#bib45\">Morin et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Peyre et al., 2011</a>), but how LGN achieved this was unknown. Using an LGN KO mouse (<a href=\"#bib31\">Konno et al., 2008</a>), LGN is now shown to be necessary for APs to have a normal number of apical/basal astrals. Importantly, lack of LGN did not affect the number of central astrals, corroborating that loss of apical/basal astrals is sufficient to increase spindle deviations and asymmetric divisions. These data were complemented by overexpressing a dominant-negative version of LGN that interacts with cell cortical G\u03b1i, but cannot interact with NuMA and dynein to anchor microtubules (<a href=\"#bib45\">Morin et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Shitamukai et al., 2011</a>). This also reduced apical/basal astral abundance. Conversely, when wt LGN was overexpressed in the presence of the microtubule-stabilizing compound taxol, neurogenic APs could be switched back to a mitosis behaviour characteristic of proliferating APs. Together, these data show that LGN is required for maintaining symmetric AP divisions through cortical anchoring of apical/basal astrals."

When APs switched to neurogenesis, the enrichment of LGN at the basal cell cortex was largely reduced, and it was further reduced all around the cell cortex in BPs. This closely corresponds to the abundance pattern of astrals and also to the levels of spindle orientation variability in these different progenitors. A spatially selective loss of cortical LGN could therefore reduce cortical anchor points and lead to fewer astrals in specific regions of the cell cortex (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10J</a>)."

An intriguing scenario is that this baseline number of remaining astrals is required for the primary establishment and structural stability of a spindle.

This diameter represented also the length of the entire spindle, including some central astrals (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>).

After showing that there is a correlation between the numbers of apical and basal astral microtubules and the spindle orientation variability, they then go on to manipulate the number of apical/basal microtubules and ask whether this influences the spindle orientation variability and, ultimately, symmetric versus neurogenic divisions. The study address a very interesting and timely question, the cellular mechanisms that determine asymmetric versus symmetric stem cell divisions and the paper is well-written and presented. In addition, the experiments, which are largely based upon live imaging approaches, are carefully performed and analyzed. However, the conclusions that the authors draw, while largely convincing, would be greatly strengthened by considering the following issues."

However, they need to ensure that cells progress through mitosis normally and at the same rate as controls.

Here the authors use the cleavage plane as a measure of division orientation, which seems more prone to subjective calls as to where the cleavage line is traced, depending on the quality of the cadherin staining and section angle. The authors might want to consider including a discussion of their method relative to that of Knoblich et al., as this could lead to some controversies."
