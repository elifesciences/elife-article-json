Unlike Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP), which fragments and solubilizes total chromatin, CUT&RUN is performed in situ, allowing for both quantitative high-resolution chromatin mapping and probing of the local chromatin environment. When applied to yeast and human nuclei, CUT&RUN yielded precise transcription factor profiles while avoiding crosslinking and solubilization issues. CUT&RUN is simple to perform and is inherently robust, with extremely low backgrounds requiring only ~1/10th the sequencing depth as ChIP, making CUT&RUN especially cost-effective for transcription factor and chromatin profiling. When used in conjunction with native ChIP-seq and applied to human CTCF, CUT&RUN mapped directional long range contact sites at high resolution. We conclude that in situ mapping of protein-DNA interactions by CUT&RUN is an attractive alternative to ChIP-seq."

Unlike Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP), which fragments and solubilizes total chromatin, CUT&RUN is performed in situ, allowing for both quantitative high-resolution chromatin mapping and probing of the local chromatin environment. When applied to yeast and human nuclei, CUT&RUN yielded precise transcription factor profiles while avoiding crosslinking and solubilization issues. CUT&RUN is simple to perform and is inherently robust, with extremely low backgrounds requiring only ~1/10th the sequencing depth as ChIP, making CUT&RUN especially cost-effective for transcription factor and chromatin profiling. When used in conjunction with native ChIP-seq and applied to human CTCF, CUT&RUN mapped directional long range contact sites at high resolution. We conclude that in situ mapping of protein-DNA interactions by CUT&RUN is an attractive alternative to ChIP-seq."

In CUT&RUN, unlike in ChIP, the DNA in the starting cells does not need to be broken up first; this means that protein-DNA interactions are more likely to be maintained in their natural state. With CUT&RUN, as in ChIP, a specific antibody identifies the protein of interest. But in CUT&RUN, this antibody binds to the target protein in intact cells and cuts out the DNA that the protein is bound to, releasing the DNA fragment from the cell. This new strategy allows the DNA fragments to be sequenced and identified more efficiently than is currently possible with ChIP."

TF profiling is most commonly carried out using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), a protocol that has changed little since it was first introduced over 30 years ago (<a href=\"#bib44\">Solomon and Varshavsky, 1985</a>). Cells are crosslinked with formaldehyde, chromatin is fragmented and solubilized, an antibody is added, and the antibody-bound chromatin is recovered for DNA extraction. Successive advances in DNA mapping technologies have revolutionized the use of X-ChIP (formaldehyde crosslinking ChIP), and with ChIP-seq, base-pair resolution mapping of TFs became feasible (<a href=\"#bib38\">Rhee and Pugh, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Skene and Henikoff, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">He et al., 2015</a>). Improvements to ChIP-seq retain the crosslinking step to preserve the in vivo pattern while the entire genome is fragmented to create a soluble extract for immunoprecipitation. However, crosslinking can promote epitope masking and can generate false positive binding sites (<a href=\"#bib48\">Teytelman et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Park et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Jain et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Baranello et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Meyer and Liu, 2014</a>)."

An important class of non-ChIP mapping methods involves tethering of an enzyme to a DNA-binding protein by a chimeric fusion and action of the enzyme on DNA in the local vicinity. For example, in DamID (<a href=\"#bib50\">van Steensel et al., 2001</a>) and related methods (<a href=\"#bib45\">Southall et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Hass et al., 2015</a>), <i>Escherichia coli</i> Dam methyltransferase is tethered to the TF and catalyzes N<sup>6</sup>-methylation of adenine at GATC sites in vivo. Sites can be mapped genome-wide using an N<sup>6</sup>-methyl-directed restriction enzyme. However, as the resolution of DamID is limited by the distribution of GATC sites, DamID cannot obtain the high resolution that is potentially attainable using a sequencing read-out (<a href=\"#bib4\">Aughey and Southall, 2016</a>). An alternative enzyme tethering method, chromatin endogenous cleavage (ChEC) tethers the endo-exonuclease Micrococcal Nuclease (MNase) to the TF (<a href=\"#bib41\">Schmid et al., 2004</a>). In ChEC, MNase is activated by permeabilizing cells and adding calcium for controlled cleavage. We recently applied an Illumina sequencing read-out to ChEC (ChEC-seq), achieving near base-pair resolution (<a href=\"#bib54\">Zentner et al., 2015</a>). Enzyme tethering methods fundamentally differ from ChIP because they are carried out in vivo (DamID) or in situ (ChEC), with extraction of DNA directly from live or permeabilized cells, thus eliminating the need to solubilize and recover chromatin."

In the original chromatin immunocleavage (ChIC) method, crude nuclei from crosslinked cells are first treated with a TF-specific antibody, followed by addition of a chimeric fusion between Protein A and MNase (pA-MN) and activation by calcium (<a href=\"#bib41\">Schmid et al., 2004</a>). Protein A binds specifically to Immunoglobulin G, which obviates the need for a fusion protein. Here we report a major development of ChIC that retains the advantages of enzyme tethering methods, while extending its applicability and ease-of-use to a point that it replaces other existing methodologies. A key feature of our protocol is that in the absence of crosslinking, seconds after calcium-induced MNase cleavage on both sides of the TF, the TF-DNA complex is released into solution, allowing for recovery of pure TF-bound DNA fragments for sequencing simply by centrifugation and DNA extraction. By carrying out the procedure on magnetic beads, our \u2018Cleavage Under Targets and Release Using Nuclease\u2019 (CUT&amp;RUN;) technique is simpler than ChIP-seq while retaining the advantages of in situ methods. Targeted digestion by CUT&amp;RUN; greatly reduces background relative to complete genomic fragmentation for ChIP, requiring only\u00a0~1/10th the sequencing depth of standard ChIP methods. Simple spike-in controls allow accurate quantification of protein binding not possible by other methods. Furthermore, the method allows low starting cell\u00a0numbers, and robotic automation is possible by performing the reaction on magnetic beads."

We expected that targeted cleavage on both sides of a TF would release the TF-DNA complex into the supernatant, leaving the remainder of the genome in the pelleted nuclei.

The best Reb1 data were obtained with 80 mM NaCl extraction, and the best Abf1 data were obtained with 600 mM NaCl, although the dynamic range for Reb1 was always better than that for Abf1 with frequent false positive occupancy (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, lower middle panels). In contrast, CUT&amp;RUN; showed the same dynamic range for both TFs over the same range of digestion time points with\u00a0~10 fold fewer paired-end reads, demonstrating that CUT&amp;RUN; is more robust than ORGANIC ChIP-seq. Relative to these high-resolution methods (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kasinathan et al., 2014</a>), standard ChIP-seq using crosslinking and sonication showed inferior sensitivity and specificity (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, right panels).

Such 10 bp periodic cleavage preferences match the 10 bp/turn periodicity of B-form DNA, which suggests that the DNA on either side of these bound TFs is spatially oriented such that tethered MNase has preferential access to one face of the DNA double helix. Tethering of MNase to a TF constrains it to cleave nearby DNA even on the surface of a nucleosome, suggesting flexibility of the chromatin fiber (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Thus, the very rapid kinetics that we observe at 0\u00b0C are due to immobilized MNase poised for cleavage near the tethering site."

For example, the\u00a0~1 megadalton 17-subunit RSC nucleosome remodeling complex dynamically slides a nucleosome that it transiently engulfs (<a href=\"#bib26\">Lorch et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Ramachandran et al., 2015</a>), and the Mot1 DNA translocase dynamically removes TATA-binding protein (TBP) from sites of high-affinity binding (<a href=\"#bib53\">Zentner and Henikoff, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Auble et al., 1997</a>). Although X-ChIP crosslinks nucleosome remodeling complexes to their nearest nucleosomes, native ChIP successfully captures yeast chromatin remodelers at their sites of action, both in nucleosome-depleted regions (NDRs) and on nucleosomes (<a href=\"#bib55\">Zentner et al., 2013</a>). For CUT&amp;RUN; to profile such large chromatin-associated complexes we found it necessary to extract total DNA rather than chromatin solubilized by CUT&amp;RUN; in situ, which may be too large to diffuse through nuclear pores. Therefore, we extracted all DNA and preferentially removed large DNA fragments with AMPure beads. When this modified protocol was applied to Mot1 over a\u00a0&gt;2 order-of-magnitude digestion range, we observed chromatin profiles that were very similar to those obtained using ORGANIC profiling, but with only\u00a0~15% the number of paired-end reads (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). As expected, Mot1 peaks on the upstream side of TBP binding sites are seen for both CUT&amp;RUN; and ORGANIC profiles, confirming that Mot1 approaches TBP from the upstream side in vivo (<a href=\"#bib53\">Zentner and Henikoff, 2013</a>)\u00a0as it does in vitro (<a href=\"#bib52\">Wollmann et al., 2011</a>).

In budding yeast, there is only only one centromeric nucleosome per chromosome, which is only\u00a0~1% the molar abundance of Abf1 or Reb1. An additional challenge to studying the centromeric nucleosome, which contains the CenH3 (Cse4) histone variant in place of H3, is that it is part of the multi-megadalton kinetochore complex throughout the cell cycle (<a href=\"#bib1\">Akiyoshi et al., 2010</a>), which renders it highly insoluble (<a href=\"#bib24\">Krassovsky et al., 2012</a>). To profile the Cse4 nucleosome by CUT&amp;RUN;, we split the samples after digestion, extracting just the supernatant from one aliquot, and total DNA from the other. In this way we could compare the recovery of the soluble and the insoluble kinetochore complex. In parallel, we similarly profiled histone H2A. By taking the difference between total and soluble chromatin, we can infer the occupancy of each histone in the insoluble pellet. As expected for the insoluble kinetochore, the highest Cse4 occupancy on the chromosome is seen at the centromere (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Strikingly, occupancy of insoluble H2A, which is present in every nucleosome througout the genome, is also maximum at the centromere. Indeed, at all 16 yeast centromeres we observe very similar enrichments of Cse4 and H2A confined to the\u00a0~120 bp functional centromere over the digestion time-course, with resolution that is 4-fold better than that of standard X-ChIP (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). We also extracted total DNA from the bead-bound chromatin derived from cells that had been formaldehyde crosslinked prior to applying CUT&amp;RUN;, with similar results (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Interestingly, crosslinking results in a more distinct profile and the appearance of phased nucleosomes on either side, which we interpret as a reduction in chromatin flexiblity with crosslinking, while demonstrating that the basic strategy can be applied to crosslinked cells."

We obtained similar results for the high-salt fraction as for total DNA (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

Moreover, as the yeast centromeric nucleosome wraps DNA that is\u00a0&gt;90% A+T (<a href=\"#bib24\">Krassovsky et al., 2012</a>), the intactness of the centromeric particle over a\u00a0&gt;100 fold digestion time-course (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>) demonstrates that CUT&amp;RUN; is not biased by the inherent preference of MNase for AT-rich DNA (<a href=\"#bib12\">Chung et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">McGhee and Felsenfeld, 1983</a>).

To directly compare the efficiency of various methods, we randomly selected 10 million reads for each technique and plotted the raw scores as an indication of information content per sequenced read. As was the case for yeast TFs, CTCF CUT&amp;RUN; showed higher dynamic range than other profiling methods, including standard X-ChIP-seq and ChIP-exo (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). When aligned to CTCF motifs found within DNaseI hypersensitive sites or previously identified binding sites, CUT&amp;RUN; and X-ChIP-seq CTCF heat maps showed strong concordance, with CUT&amp;RUN; having a higher dynamic range (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>).

As was the case for budding yeast TFs, we observed release of the neighboring fragments, which correspond to phased nucleosomes immediately adjacent to CTCF sites. By plotting just the end positions of the short CUT&amp;RUN; fragments that are the cleavage positions of the tethered MNase, we observed pronounced \u2018tram-tracks\u2019 separated by 44 bp at defined positions relative to the CTCF motif. Furthermore, the exact cleavage pattern is consistent over a\u00a0~300 fold time-course digestion range, with a predominant single base-pair cut site on either side of the CTCF-bound site, highlighting the limit digest obtained (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). This pattern indicates that the cleavage positions are precise and highly homogeneous within the population of cells. Our results suggest that CUT&amp;RUN; accurately maps both the TFs and their flanking chromatin in the same experiment."

To bind DNA at E-boxes, Myc forms a heterodimer with Max (<a href=\"#bib7\">Blackwood et al., 1991</a>) but in addition Max has other binding partners (<a href=\"#bib5\">Ayer and Eisenman, 1993</a>), As expected, we see very high overlap with Max present at almost all Myc binding sites. In contrast, there is poor overlap between previously identified binding sites by ENCODE X-ChIP-seq for Myc and Max, as 10-fold fewer Max sites were identified. However, when we lined up Max ENCODE X-ChIP-seq data over Max CUT&amp;RUN; sites, we saw high occupancy (<a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3C</a>), suggesting that the lower dynamic range of X-ChIP-seq relative to CUT&amp;RUN; was responsible for the failure to identify these Max binding sites by X-ChIP-seq."

Chromosome-Conformation-Capture (3C) methods, such as Hi-C and ChIA-PET (<a href=\"#bib46\">Tang et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Lieberman-Aiden et al., 2009</a>), are the preferred techniques for mapping 3D genome-wide contacts. These methods use the same formaldehyde crosslinking protocol as X-ChIP to identify 3D interactions, such as between a TF bound at an enhancer and its contact with a promoter via co-activators. In this example the binding sites for a protein identified by X-ChIP will include both the promoter and the enhancer, even though one of the interactions is via indirect protein-protein interactions crosslinked by formaldehyde. But in both X-ChIP and 3C-based mapping there is no systematic way to distinguish between direct and indirect sites. We therefore attempted to map CTCF binding sites using native ChIP, which we have previously shown results in mapping only direct binding sites containing the TF-specific DNA-binding motif, due to the transient nature of protein-protein interactions (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kasinathan et al., 2014</a>). We developed a new native ChIP protocol (Appendix 1), and achieved near-complete protein extraction with no evidence of protein redistribution (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Under native conditions, we identified 2298 sites with high motif scores. In contrast, CUT&amp;RUN; mapping of CTCF detected\u00a0~22,000 sites that were also present in X-ChIP (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), with a diverse range of motif scores (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). As expected, all sites identified by native ChIP also were robustly detected by CUT&amp;RUN; and X-ChIP, showing a similar signal distribution (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). CUT&amp;RUN; sites lacking a significant native ChIP signal nevertheless showed a robust footprint in the native ChIP input with a similar cumulative distribution of counts (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>), indicating the presence of unknown bound factors, as would be expected for 3D genomic interactions. This suggests that CUT&amp;RUN;, as with X-ChIP, can discover both direct (native CTCF peak) and indirect (CUT&amp;RUN; peak only) chromatin interactions at high resolution."

To adapt ChIC into a genome-wide profiling method, we made five critical modifications. First, we immobilize permeabilized cells or crude nuclei to magnetic beads, allowing for rapid and efficient solution changes, so that CUT&amp;RUN; is performed in a day and is suitable for automation. Second, we bind antibodies and pA-MNase to native unfixed nuclei, where epitopes are preserved and accessible. Third, as cleavage by immobilized MNase is a zero-order reaction, we performed digestion at ice-cold temperature, which limits diffusion of released fragments, thus reducing background. Fourth,\u00a0we use native chromatin, which allows us to fractionate cleaved fragments based on solubility (<a href=\"#bib40\">Sanders, 1978</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Teves and Henikoff, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Jahan et al., 2016</a>) to enrich specifically for the released chromatin complex. We simply remove the insoluble bulk chromatin, and only chromatin fragments with cleavages on both sides of a particle enter the supernatant. Fifth, after DNA extraction we use these soluble fragments for Illumina library preparation and paired-end DNA sequencing. We find that CUT&amp;RUN; performs as well as or better than ChIP-seq with respect to simplicity, resolution, robustness, efficiency, data quality, and applicability to highly insoluble complexes. CUT&amp;RUN; requires only\u00a0~1/10th of the sequencing depth of other high resolution methodologies due to the intrinsically low background achieved by performing the reaction in situ. As nuclei are intact when MNase is activated, CUT&amp;RUN; can probe the local environment around the targeted site. Indeed, we find that CUT&amp;RUN; recovers sites of 3D contacts with base-pair resolution at relatively low sequencing depth in human cells."

Backgrounds are low with CUT&amp;RUN;, because cleavages occur only around binding sites, whereas ChIP first pulverizes the entire genome, and these fragments contribute to a genome-wide background noise that must still be sequenced. The near absence of detectable background under the brief low-temperature conditions that we used, the lack of preference for accessible or AT-rich DNA, and the recovery of essentially all Abf1 and Reb1 motifs in the yeast genome, suggests that CUT&amp;RUN; is not subject to the types of artifacts that sometimes have plagued ChIP (<a href=\"#bib48\">Teytelman et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Park et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Jain et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Baranello et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Kasinathan et al., 2014</a>).

Recently, Hi-C contact sites have been predicted computationally with a high degree of confidence given sites of CTCF binding (<a href=\"#bib39\">Sanborn et al., 2015</a>). As CUT&amp;RUN; maps both CTCF binding sites and interactions, and our native ChIP protocol identifies those sites that are directly TF-bound, it can provide a complete high-resolution 1D map of a genome while enriching its 3D contact map with high-resolution distinctions between direct and indirect TF binding sites."

In ChIP-seq, whole genome fragmentation leads to a constant low density genome-wide background that provides a basis for normalization, for example, in comparing wildtype and knockdown cell lines. Although normalization fails on abundant proteins, this can be corrected by the use of spike-in controls (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bonhoure et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Chen et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Orlando et al., 2014</a>). However, a rigorous spike-in strategy requires the addition of cells from a different species, and quantification is reliant upon antibody cross-reactivity (<a href=\"#bib31\">Orlando et al., 2014</a>).

For example only\u00a0~10 million paired-end reads were required for each CTCF time point, similar to the requirement for low-resolution ChIP-seq, and many fewer than for ChIP-exo, which required\u00a0~100 million reads for CTCF (<a href=\"#bib38\">Rhee and Pugh, 2011</a>). Furthermore, in the cases of Max and H3K27me3, 10 million reads for CUT&amp;RUN; provided very high dynamic range, but 10 million reads were insufficient for calling peaks from Max ENCODE X-ChIP-seq. This cost-effectiveness makes CUT&amp;RUN; attractive as a replacement for ChIP-seq especially where depth of sequencing is limiting. We might attribute the high efficiency of CUT&amp;RUN; to fundamental differences between in situ profiling and ChIP: CUT&amp;RUN; retains the in vivo 3D conformation, so antibodies access only exposed surfaces in a first-order binding reaction, whereas in ChIP, antibodies interact with the solubilizable genome-wide content of the pulverized cells or nuclei. Furthermore, CUT&amp;RUN; cleavage is effectively a zero-order reaction, resulting in steady particle release during the brief low temperature time-course for all bound epitopes in the genome. Accounting for epitope abundances, we estimate that our mapping of\u00a0~22,000 direct and indirect CTCF sites with 600,000 cells is comparable to the sensitivity of ultra-low input ChIP-seq protocols that are typically restricted to abundant histone modifications, such as H3K27me3, with\u00a0~5000 cells (<a href=\"#bib9\">Brind'Amour et al., 2015</a>). Whereas ultra-low-input ChIP provides only\u00a0~2 kb resolution, CUT&amp;RUN; provides near base-pair resolution. The inherent robustness, high information content, low input and sequencing requirements and suitability for automation of our method suggests that CUT&amp;RUN; profiling of CTCF and other TFs might be applied to epigenome diagnostics."

Ten million cells were harvested by centrifugation (600\u00a0g, 3 min in a swinging bucket rotor) and washed in ice cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Nuclei were isolated by hypotonic lysis in 1 ml NE1 (20 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.9; 10 mM KCl; 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>; 0.1% Triton X-100; 20% Glycerol) for 5 min on ice followed by centrifugation as above. (We have found that nucleases in some cells cause Mg<sup>++</sup>-dependent degradation of DNA, in which case 0.5 mM spermidine can be substituted for 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>.) Nuclei were briefly washed in 1.5 ml Buffer 1 (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5; 150 mM NaCl; 2 mM EDTA; 0.5 mM Spermidine; 0.1% BSA) and then washed in 1.5 ml Buffer 2 (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5; 150 mM NaCl; 0.5 mM Spermidine; 0.1% BSA).

Nuclei were resupended in 300 \u00b5l Buffer 2 and 5 \u00b5l pA-MN added and incubated at 4\u00b0C for 1 hr. Nuclei were washed 3 x in 0.5 ml Buffer 2 to remove unbound pA-MN. Tubes were placed in a metal block in ice-water and quickly mixed with 100 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> to a final concentration of 2 mM. The reaction was quenched by the addition of EDTA and EGTA to a final concentration of 10 mM and 20 mM respectively and 1 ng of mononucleosome-sized DNA fragments from Drosophila DNA added as a spike-in. Cleaved fragments were liberated into the supernatant by incubating the nuclei at 4\u00b0C for 1 hr, and nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation as above. DNA fragments were extracted from the supernatant and used for the construction of sequencing libraries. We have also adapted this protocol for use with magnetic beads (Appendix 3)."

For standard normalization, the number of fragment ends corresponding to each base position in the genome was divided by the total number of read ends mapped. However, the inherently low background levels of CUT&amp;RUN; necessitate a spike-in control for quantitative comparisons (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hu et al., 2014</a>). For spike-in normalization of human CUT&amp;RUN;, we added a low constant amount of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> DNA to each reaction. We mapped the paired-end reads to both human and fly genomes, normalizing human profiles to the number of fly reads (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>). Using internal normalization, we observed no increase in cleavages over a digestion time-course. However, by normalizing to the fly spike-in DNA, we observed an\u00a0~4 fold increase in cleavage level over time. As such, CUT&amp;RUN; is amenable to accurate quantification of protein-DNA interactions."

To deplete total DNA samples of large fragments originating from insoluble chromatin, samples were mixed with \u00bd volume of Agencourt AMPure XP beads, held 5\u201310 min, placed on a magnet stand, and the supernatant was retained, discarding the beads. To reduce the representation of the remaining large fragments, the number of PCR cycles using the KAPA polymerase library preparation method was increased to 14 cycles and adapter concentrations were increased accordingly: Increasing the number of PCR cycles favors exponential amplification of shorter fragments over linear amplification of fragments that are too long for polymerase to completely transit. Libraries were sequenced for 25 cycles in paired-end mode on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center Genomics Shared Resource. Paired-end fragments were mapped to the sacCer3/V64 genome and build and to release r5.51 (May 2013) of the <i>D.\u00a0melanogaster</i> genomic sequence obtained from FlyBase using Novoalign (Novocraft) as described to generate SAM files.

This identified 1899 Abf1 sites and 1413 Reb1 sites.

MEME was used to construct log-odds PSSMs from peaks called using the threshold method of Kasinathan et al. (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kasinathan et al., 2014</a>). Peak-calling cut-off was the 99.5th percentile of normalized counts for pooled 1 s\u221232 s \u2264120 bp Abf1 and Reb1 datasets, where the interpeak distance\u00a0=\u00a0100, minimum peak width\u00a0=\u00a050, and maximum peak width\u00a0=\u00a01000.

In this method, native nuclei were immobilized and incubated with antibody against the protein of interest, and treated with protein A-MNase fusion protein for a very short time at 4o C. DNA released from MNase digestion was subjected to deep-sequencing. The authors tested this method with transcription factors including CTCF and with centromeric histone variant CenH3, and reported data with high resolution and sensitivity. Subsequent long-range interaction mapping by this method showed near base-pair resolution. Overall, the study provided a useful option for genome-wide mapping.

That would imply that native ChIP must be performed in parallel to CUT&RUN to identify direct binding sites. That seem a major limitation that disqualifies the technique as a full replacement for ChIP-seq. Is this limited to CTCF or they see evidence of indirect sites also in their yeast data? Are these indirect contacts captured by conventional X-ChIP? Is there any way to distinguish direct from indirect bioinformatically or by modifications to the CUT&RUN protocol?"

Additionally, they sometimes lack resolution or depth. However, they have the advantage of working in native conditions or even in vivo. The presented method has the advantages of ChIP-seq since it requires only an antibody to the protein of interest without the need of generating a transgenic cell lines. Thus, it can be complemented and compared directly to ChIP-seq. It also gains in resolution over conventional ChIP-seq by relying on an enzymatic digestion of the DNA under native conditions. Additionally, by releasing MNase accessible regions, the method reduced background reads. Finally, it allows the investigation of the local accessibility state.

This was a point that we made in describing how yeast kinetochores, the cores of which are the most AT-rich regions in the genome, remain fully intact in our Cse4 and H2A CUT&amp;RUN; profiles. However, the well-known preference for cleaving AT-rich DNA (e.g. McGhee &amp; Felsenfeld, \u201cAnother potential artifact in the study of nucleosome phasing by chromatin digestion with micrococcal nuclease\u201d, Cell 1983, PMID: 6301684) has led to the understandable assumption that tethered MNase would have the same DNA accessibility artifact. In stark contrast to this expectation, our study shows that CUT&amp;RUN; has remarkably little bias either for or against accessible or inaccessible regions genome-wide. We now demonstrate this fact more directly by showing that our No Antibody negative controls show no difference between NDRs and flanking nucleosomes for both yeast (new <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>) and human (new <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Also, our new H3K27me3 CUT&amp;RUN; profiling data also indicate that local accessibility is not a factor when the MNase is tethered. This is in contrast to freely diffusing MNase, which has such a strong preference for linker DNA that it has been used for 40 years to define linker accessibility (e.g. Reeves &amp; Jones, Science 1976, PMID:1264202). As targeting MNase is the key feature that distinguishes CUT&amp;RUN; from Native ChIP-seq, MNase-seq, DNAse-seq, ATAC-seq and other popular nuclease-based methods we have modified the title to better emphasize that the MNase is <i>targeted</i>."

To illustrate this distinction, we now compare CUT&amp;RUN; size fractions to MNase-seq data at Abf1 and Reb1 sites (compare <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a> top and bottom rows of panels).
