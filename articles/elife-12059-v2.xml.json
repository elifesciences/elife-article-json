Here, we describe new methods to apply quantitative arbor and network context to iteratively proofread and reconstruct circuits and create anatomically enriched wiring diagrams. We measured the morphological underpinnings of connectivity in new and existing reconstructions of <i>Drosophila</i> sensorimotor (larva) and visual (adult) systems. Synaptic inputs were preferentially located on numerous small, microtubule-free 'twigs' which branch off a single microtubule-containing 'backbone'. Omission of individual twigs accounted for 96% of errors. However, the synapses of highly connected neurons were distributed across multiple twigs. Thus, the robustness of a strong connection to detailed twig anatomy was associated with robustness to reconstruction error. By comparing iterative reconstruction to the consensus of multiple reconstructions, we show that our method overcomes the need for redundant effort through the discovery and application of relationships between cellular neuroanatomy and synaptic connectivity."

Here, we describe new methods to apply quantitative arbor and network context to iteratively proofread and reconstruct circuits and create anatomically enriched wiring diagrams. We measured the morphological underpinnings of connectivity in new and existing reconstructions of <i>Drosophila</i> sensorimotor (larva) and visual (adult) systems. Synaptic inputs were preferentially located on numerous small, microtubule-free 'twigs' which branch off a single microtubule-containing 'backbone'. Omission of individual twigs accounted for 96% of errors. However, the synapses of highly connected neurons were distributed across multiple twigs. Thus, the robustness of a strong connection to detailed twig anatomy was associated with robustness to reconstruction error. By comparing iterative reconstruction to the consensus of multiple reconstructions, we show that our method overcomes the need for redundant effort through the discovery and application of relationships between cellular neuroanatomy and synaptic connectivity."

Understanding the architecture of a neuron\u2019s branches is important to understand the role that a particular neuron plays in processing information. Therefore, neuroscientists strive to reconstruct the architecture of these branches and how they connect to one another using imaging techniques."

However, reconstructing neural circuits from such images is notoriously time consuming and error prone. These errors could result in the reconstructed circuit being very different than the real-life circuit. For example, an error that leads to missing out a large branch could result in researchers failing to notice many important connections in the circuit. On the other hand, some errors may not matter much because the neurons share other synapses that are included in the reconstruction."

Here, Schneider-Mizell, Gerhard et al. study this relationship in detail and then devise a faster reconstruction method that uses the shape and other properties of neurons without sacrificing accuracy. The method includes a way to include data from the shape of neurons in the circuit wiring diagrams, revealing circuit patterns that would otherwise go unnoticed."

Such omissions do not have a big effect on the reconstructed circuit because strongly connected neurons make multiple synapses onto each other."

Combining multiple independent reconstructions of the same neuron can reduce errors (<a href=\"#bib27\">Helmstaedter et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Kim et al., 2014</a>) at the cost of multiplying the required labor. Current computational approaches operate only with 'local' information, that\u00a0is, the EM micrographs and algorithmically detected fine structures such as cell membranes and mitochondria. They are therefore sensitive to noise (<a href=\"#bib31\">Jain et al., 2010</a>), particularly in anisotropic EM data where the smallest neurites may be thinner than the thickness of individual serial sections (<a href=\"#bib70\">Veeraraghavan et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Helmstaedter, 2013</a>).

Mesoscale anatomy, particularly the placement of large branches, is a key component of circuit structure (<a href=\"#bib76\">Zlati\u0107 et al., 2003</a>, <a href=\"#bib77\">2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Wu et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Couton et al., 2015</a>). Similarly, the connectivity graph of a stereotyped circuit can relate back to anatomy by consideration of the location of the synaptic sites between pairs of neurons. However, little is known about the smallest scales of synaptic connectivity, the distribution of individual synapses on a neuron. Microtubule-free and actin-rich structures have been identified as key sites of excitatory input in the adult <i>Drosophila</i> visual system (<a href=\"#bib60\">Scott et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Leiss et al., 2009</a>), but it is unclear how ubiquitous these are in the nervous system."

We implemented the calculation and visualization of such features on-demand as an extension of the web-based large image data viewer CATMAID (<a href=\"#bib56\">Saalfeld et al., 2009</a>). We propose a novel method for interactively using these features to reconstruct neuronal circuits through iterative proofreading at the level of both EM images and higher\u00a0level features. We validated this approach by comparing the speed and accuracy of our iterative method to a consensus method, where multiple independent reconstructions are used to calculate regions of agreement across individuals (<a href=\"#bib28\">Helmstaedter et al., 2013</a>). Because the detection of high-impact errors can occur concurrently with reconstruction via interactive analysis, our tool removes the need for time-consuming repeated reconstructions (<a href=\"#bib28\">Helmstaedter et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Kim et al., 2014</a>). Moreover, because reconstructed neurons did not need to be hidden to ensure independence between repeated reconstructions, our method facilitates concurrent, synergistic collaboration between expert neuroanatomists who, for example, map circuits in different brain regions that happen to spatially overlap or synaptically interact. We demonstrate our methods by mapping a sensorimotor circuit in the <i>Drosophila</i> larva from proprioceptive sensory neurons to motor neurons."

We found a similar majority of inputs onto twigs in three hemisegmental pairs of premotor interneurons (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>) and brain neurons (<a href=\"#bib47\">Ohyama et al., 2015</a>) in the first instar larva (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). We tested whether the observed distribution of postsynaptic sites onto twigs generalizes across larval stages by comparing a somatosensory interneuron in the first instar to its homologue in late third instar (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>). At both life stages, we find more than 80% of inputs were onto twigs, suggesting that twigs are not a temporary developmental structure. In the adult fly, light microscopy-level analysis of lobula plate tangential cells of the visual system suggests a similar distribution of postsynaptic sites onto twigs (<a href=\"#bib40\">Leiss et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Scott et al., 2003</a>). We annotated EM skeletonizations of medullar Tm3 neurons reconstructed by <a href=\"#bib67\">Takemura et al. (2013)</a> in the adult visual system neuropil and found that nearly all their inputs were onto twigs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>). Our findings suggest that microtubule-free twigs are a general feature of <i>Drosophila</i> neurons and constitute the primary anatomical location of synaptic input. Spine-like twigs are found in all cell types, but host a variable, typically non-majority, amount of synaptic input (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C\u2013G</a>). We consider all twigs for the remainder of our analysis."

Motor neurons each received between 1 and 28 synaptic inputs from individual presynaptic neurons, with a maximum of 7.3% of all inputs coming from a single neuron (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). The fraction of synapses accounted for by their presynaptic partners, rank-ordered by number of synapses, is well-fit by an exponential survival function, with a decay indicating that approximately the top 22 presynaptic partners of one motor neuron contribute 63% of all its synaptic inputs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>)."

To investigate whether the spatial distribution of mitochondria is a signature of different arbor compartments, we annotated the location of all mitochondria in the four motor neurons and the six premotor interneurons from <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013C</a>). Most mitochondria (348/425) were associated with backbone across motor neurons (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>) and interneurons (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). Surprisingly, we found that 97% of central presynaptic sites were located within 3 \u00b5m of a mitochondrion (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>), although only 47% of cable was located within the same distance. A similar rule did not hold with postsynaptic sites, which were more broadly distributed (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>). This suggests that presynaptic sites and mitochondria are kept near one another, making mitochondrial proximity a useful constraint for validating synapse annotation."

For example, one strong inconsistency in this network, the connection from A02l to A31k (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>), was due to the expected synapse locations being outside the imaged volume on one side but not the other (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

Of these, two directly premotor interneurons (A27j and A31k) are immunoreactive to anti-GABA (<a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), whereas the others, all from A02 lineage, are members of the glutamatergic neuron class described in <a href=\"#bib35\">Kohsaka et al.

Our approach assumes that the neuron can be split into distinct compartments, and at the end checks to see if the split was successful. First, we calculate all paths along the skeleton from each of the neuron\u2019s input synapses to each of its output synapses and for each node of the skeleton compute the number of centripetal (toward soma) and centrifugal (away from soma) paths that pass through it (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A\u2013B</a>). This quantity, which we call \u201csynapse flow centrality\u201d (SFC), is analogous to a synapse-specific version of betweenness centrality (<a href=\"#bib45\">Newman, 2010</a>). For most neuronal arbors, we find that the most proximal skeleton node with the highest centrifugal SFC corresponds to an intuitive generalization of the locations of spike initiation zones in known polarized neurons of <i>Drosophila</i> (<a href=\"#bib21\">Gouwens and Wilson, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">G\u00fcnay et al., 2015</a>) and other insects (<a href=\"#bib20\">Gabbiani et al., 2002</a>)."

A very low segregation index means that pre- and post-synaptic sites are intermingled and an axon/dendrite compartmentalization is inappropriate (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Using this approach, we classified all identifiable neurons found in both the left and right hemisegments of the proprio-motor circuitry described above. Of the 3834 synapses between these cells, we found 79% were axo-dendritic (3033), 11% axo-axonic (424), 9% dendro-dendritic (334) and 1% dendro-axonic (43)."

First, we analyzed how different proprioceptive inputs converge onto motor neuron RP2 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C\u2013E</a>). By splitting interneuron A02b into axon and dendrite, we observed that its dendrites receive bilateral proprioceptive input, while its axon synapses both onto the ipsilateral RP2 and axo-axonically onto its strong premotor partner, A03a1 in both hemisegments (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). In contrast, while dbd only connects indirectly with A02b (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>), it synapses exclusively ipsilaterally and axo-axonicaly onto A03a1 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). This suggests that the role of dbd in modulating motor patterns could be qualitatively different than the other proprioceptive sensory neurons, since its direct pathways are typically longer or involve connections types other than axo-dendritic."

We found that a neuron presynaptic to the aCC motor neuron on both sides targets dendro-dendritically a pre-RP2 neuron (A27h), potentially coordinating the joint excitation of their targets (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). We also found a premotor interneuron (A27e) with reciprocal connections with a GABAergic premotor interneuron (A27j; see <a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3</a>) that receives convergent inputs from dorsal proprioceptive neurons (dmd1, ddaD, ddaE; <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>).

We thus extended the concept of splitting a neuron into two arbor compartments to an arbitrary number, by defining a compartment as a cluster of synapses near each other along the arbor cable (see 'Materials and methods'). As an example, we consider the axon terminal of dbd, which enters at the interface between two segments and extends symmetric arbors toward the anterior and posterior segments (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). The synapses form multiple well-separated clusters that we can visualize as a group of graph nodes (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B\u2013C</a>), revealing that the anterior and posterior branches synapse onto homologous interneurons (A08a) for their respective segments (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D\u2013E</a>). This pattern suggests that each A08a cell gets convergent input from the dbd of two consecutive segments, which could reflect that adjacent pairs of segments move together during locomotion (<a href=\"#bib26\">Heckscher et al., 2012</a>)."

An initial systematic review consists in traversing a whole arbor from distal to proximal to follow the expected gradual changes in anatomical properties (e.g. caliber tapering and cytoskeletal changes from microtubule-free to increasing number of microtubules). By freeing mental attention from complex spatial navigation, we found that the systematic review leads to the quick discovery of attentional errors, such as missed synapses, or anatomical inconsistencies, such as a non-contiguous microtubule cytoskeleton. The systematic review status is stored on a per-skeleton node and per-contributor basis (see 'Materials and methods' for details). To allow contributors to incorporate the level of proofreading for each neuron into their evaluation of the neurons and circuits, review status of a neuron is displayed throughout CATMAID, as measured by fraction of the skeleton nodes reviewed. For example, when listing synaptic partners for neurons of interest, the review status of all partners is shown alongside information such as neuron name and number of associated synapses."

Moreover, we are concerned less about adding extra synapses to true connections and more about adding false edges that would be interpreted as pathways that are not actually present. To estimate the likelihood of introducing a false edge between cell types not just once, but twice (e.g. in a left and right pair of homologs), we simulated adding false twigs to a neuron. The probability of adding a false edge depends both on the probability of adding a false twig (observed false positive error rate: 7 errors in 605 twigs) and the number of nearby but unconnected neurons with presynaptic sites. This will vary depending on the circuit in question. For example, a neuropile with all-to-all connectivity will have no opportunity for false positive edges, while in an array of rigorously separated labeled lines any false positive synapse would be a false positive edge. Further, larger neurons offer more opportunities for false positives than smaller neurons."

Here, we presented our approach to circuit mapping in EM by building tools in CATMAID that ease and emphasize the use of high level features concurrent with image-level reconstruction. While every reconstruction and editing decision is performed manually, it is informed by a host of quantitative neuroanatomical and connectivity measures computed on demand and, where possible, tightly linked to specific locations in the EM image volumes. In addition to applying existing metrics, we also devised novel algorithms and measures to describe the distribution of synapses across neurons, a feature uniquely well-measurable by EM. Because this method is based extensively on existing information, contributors iterate reconstructions towards\u00a0more and more correct states. We showed that this more efficiently produces data at least as accurate as computing the consensus of multiple independent reconstructions."

If, contrary to observations, neurons were to only contact each other via a single twig that hosts many postsynaptic sites, then this connection would be fragile with respect to developmental noise (<a href=\"#bib15\">Couton et al., 2015</a>). Backbones define the spatial extent and stereotyped shape of a neuron, and we found that most presynaptic sites are located on or very near the backbone\u2019s microtubules and mitochondria.

The presence of existing and correct skeletons in complicated areas, such as registration errors between consecutive sections or gaps, reduces the time necessary for resolving possible ambiguities and effectively provides an extra step of proof-reading by not allowing contradictory reconstructions. Further savings originate in the reuse of data, for example exploratory reconstruction of backbones in search of specific neurons or branches pruned during proofreading are merged into the arbor currently being reconstructed.

Our methods for analysis of arbor morphology, synaptic distribution and circuit structure and reliability, and their application in proof-reading, apply equally to manually and automatically reconstructed neurons. Neuroanatomical measurements suggest mixed strategies for leveraging both automated algorithms and human effort. For example, mitochondria can be reliably located automatically (<a href=\"#bib42\">Lucchi et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Funke et al., 2014</a>) which, together with our finding of a distance constraint between mitochondria and presynaptic sites, could assist in automated synapse detection (<a href=\"#bib37\">Kreshuk et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Becker et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Kreshuk et al., 2014</a>). Similarly, the properties of neuronal backbone and twigs suggest that algorithms for the automatic detection of microtubules in serial section EM would be a profitable source of constraints for automated reconstruction of neurites across consecutive sections (<a href=\"#bib69\">Vazquez-Reina et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Funke et al., 2012</a>). While we only considered the relationship between error rate and the presence or absence of microtubules, with the use of automated detection methods it will be important to look at more detailed measures of arbors such as the number of microtubules, curvature, or caliber."

Shaft synapses are less likely to be missed because both sides of the synapse present microtubules. Our finding that the connection between two neurons is resilient to errors of omission of spines or twigs is based on the redundancy afforded by the distribution of postsynaptic sites across the receiving arbor. Instances of this pattern have been observed in mammals in multiple brain regions (<a href=\"#bib25\">Hamos et al., 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bock et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Kasthuri et al., 2015</a>). However, the particulars of the distribution of postsynaptic sites over the postsynaptic arbor will be specific to each species\u2014even to brain regions or cell types within each species\u2014and therefore must be measured for the tissue of interest. We have shown that this distribution enables estimating an acceptable false negative rate, the amount of missed synaptic connections that still allow the recovery of strong synaptic connections in the wiring diagram, and thus determines the minimal effort that must be dedicated to twigs or spines."

This motif is well-posed to provide an inhibitory 'mission accomplished' signal to suppress motor neuron activity after a successful contraction during forward locomotion (<a href=\"#bib30\">Hughes and Thomas, 2007</a>). However, we also observed that many synaptic partners of dbd were themselves presynaptic to neurons downstream of the other proprioceptive axons, suggesting other, more complex roles for proprioceptive feedback in modulating motor activity. Surprisingly, the axon terminals of proprioceptive neurons themselves almost entirely lacked presynaptic input.

A new node, generated by a key press or mouse click, becomes the topological \u2018child\u2019 of an explicitly selected \u2018active node\u2019. The active node updates to the most recently created node, and branch points are generated by selecting a node that already has child nodes and generating an additional one.

Since neurons are typically linear at short distances, nodes do not have be manually placed in every image section. In image sections between those containing manually placed skeleton nodes, CATMAID produces intermediate, linearly interpolated virtual nodes that can be interacted with like a real skeleton node.

In effect, then, the process of finishing a neuronal reconstruction becomes a task of continuing every unlabeled leaf node until no more exist. Eventually, all open leaves have been explicitly declared finished and the first draft of the arbor is complete. To ease this process, a single key press (\u2018R\u2019) will position the field of view on the closest unlabeled leaf node of a selected neuron, making it simple and efficient to jump to to the next part of the arbor in need of reconstruction."

For this purpose, we partition the arbor to generate the smallest possible set of the largest possible sequences of continuous nodes to minimize the number of times that the reviewer has to switch to a different arbor path. We sort leaf nodes by path length (in number of intermediate nodes) to the root node in descending order. Starting from the most distal leaf node, we generate a sequence of nodes all the way to the root. Then we pick the second most distal node and generate another sequence of nodes until reaching a branch point that has already been assigned to a sequence, and so on for each remaining leaf node. When done, sequences of nodes are sorted by length. The reviewer then iterates each sequence, automatically marking each node as reviewed upon visiting it (using \u2018q\u2019 and \u2018w\u2019 key bindings to go forward and backward in a sequence, and \u2018e\u2019 to jump to the beginning of the longest unreviewed sequence). As a visual aid, each node is centered in the screen, facilitating the detection of changes in the contour of the sectioned neurite, as well as drastic shifts of the field of view that indicate an error (e.g. a jump to an adjacent neurite). The enforcement of a unique directionality and simple one-dimensional path\u2014from distal ends towards\u00a0inner parts of the arbor or the soma\u2014facilitates noticing glaring inconsistencies such as a path starting off large and microtubule-rich, then reducing to small and microtubule-free, then becoming again large and microtubule-rich. In other words, a review approach coherent with the expected tapering out of neurite caliber and cytoskeleton from soma to distal ends adds context that helps the reviewer."

Other cues can include the smooth endoplasmatic reticulum that lines large and mid-size neurites; the presence of vesicles of a specific kind (e.g. dark, 50-nm diameter neuropeptide vesicles, or clear large unevenly shaped vesicles, or small, packed clear-core cholinergic vesicles, and others); or other distinctive characteristics such as the presence of microtubules on a specific side of the neurite, or membrane-associated structures, or distinctive cytoplasm texture, such as relative darkness compared to neighboring neurites."

Second, to quantitatively estimate the cable distance between the axon terminals and dendritic arbor by measuring the amount of cable with the maximum centrifugal SFC value. Third, to measure the cable length of the main dendritic shafts using centripetal SFC, which applies only to insect neurons with at least one output synapse in their dendritic arbor.

The number of contributors was chosen based on available, trained users at the time. Each contributor reconstructed the six neurons (skeletons plus synapses) in an otherwise completely unannotated volume that only he or she was working in and then did skeleton-centered review of their own neurons. To determine a consensus skeleton from these four reconstructions, we re-implemented the RESCOP algorithm <a href=\"#bib27\">Helmstaedter et al.

We simulated the 10<sup>6</sup> iterations of the model for <i>k<sub>\u03b8</sub> = 1-4</i>. To investigate more extreme errors than the ones measured, we also considered <i>m</i> = 37 synapses, the largest twin twig observed across all neurons looked at, and <i>m</i> = 20 synapses, a more typical value for the largest twig of a single neuron."

We estimate the total amount of time spent skeletonizing an arbor\u2014including its synapses\u2014by counting the number of 20-second\u00a0intervals that contain at least one skeleton node or connector node related to the skeleton. This approach is robust to the discontinuity in time and authorship of adjacent skeleton nodes, but tends to overestimate slightly reconstruction time, given the contribution of 20-second\u00a0intervals for single nodes that were created earlier in time as pre- or postsynaptic placeholder skeletons with a single node, and which were subsequently merged into the growing skeleton. If the latter were each counted as contributing 6 seconds\u00a0only, reconstruction times per skeleton typically shrink between 15 and 25%."

Specifically, they extended the web-based image data viewer CATMAID (Saalfeld et al., 2009) to enable multiple researchers to map neuronal circuitry. A neuron is reconstructed with a skeleton, a directed tree graph with one or more nodes in every cross-section of neurite in an EM volume. Synapses are annotated as a relation from a node on the presynaptic neuron skeleton to an intermediate \"connector node\" and then to a node of a postsynaptic neuron skeleton. Reconstructions are immediately synchronized across all users to avoid duplicate or conflicting work, and to take advantage of existing reconstructions to aid further reconstruction and circuit discovery."

Moreover, they reconstruct a proprioceptive network from sensory axons to motor neurons and provide insightful micro-anatomical comparisons between putative inhibitory and excitatory interneurons."

They make a compelling case for this approach by analyzing networks of tens to hundreds of neurons. However, the manuscript is a complicated mixture of pointing out the unique features of <i>Drosophila</i> neurons that make them amenable to the described approach (Figures 1-2, 6) and the description of the actual methods employed and error quantification (Figure 3-5). I understand why the authors organized it as they did, but the necessity to point out the unique features of fly neurons before getting to the various analysis methods raises the question of how generalizable their approach is to neurons in other nervous systems."

The authors draw the somewhat obvious conclusion that the localization of synapses along neurites will alter the impact of tracing errors. If, however, the morphologies of vertebrate/mammalian neurons are substantially more intricate, it is not clear how many of the principles described in the manuscript will carry over. I am thinking of, for example, thin 100 nm unmyelinated cortical axons extending over millimeters of path length where single errors could significantly impact a connectivity matrix by mis-assignment of all synapses downstream of an error. I commend the authors of making full use of the benefits of <i>Drosophila</i> neuroanatomy, but I remain unsure that many of their conclusions are generally applicable to neurons/circuits in other species."

This is particularly an issue with Figure 3, which shows 4 different wiring diagrams each using different analysis tools. Given that the authors are not constrained to a 6-figure paper in <i>eLife</i> (as far as I am aware), Figure 3 could have been broken out into multiple figures each demonstrating a particular analysis tool in more detail."

A flow chart of the method should be added in the main text (supported by the text) that demonstrates the collaborative process and points out where in the collaborative process each of the 'high-level' metrics/comparisons were made. The interesting biological findings of the paper are not sufficiently explored in the main text but rather relegated to supplementary data.

The data support all of the major conclusions as well as convincingly support the use of an integrative process with its great time-savings, over the consensus model (that requires repeated full reconstructions by many people). When the EM images are outstanding, as they are in this work, then the iterative approach is surely more efficient and equally accurate to a consensus approach. My one main comment is that the authors need to define the two different approaches in the Abstract, Introduction, Methods, and Discussion more clearly \u2013 the references are a little obtuse right now, and even though I think I know the difference (iterative being not repeated full reconstruction of neurons where they are easy to follow vs. consensus being full reconstructions of whole neurons by multiple people \u2013 costing 4-10 times the amount of time).</i>"

They make a compelling case for this approach by analyzing networks of tens to hundreds of neurons. However, the manuscript is a complicated mixture of pointing out the unique features of Drosophila neurons that make them amenable to the described approach (Figures 1-2, 6) and the description of the actual methods employed and error quantification (Figure 3-5). I understand why the authors organized it as they did, but the necessity to point out the unique features of fly neurons before getting to the various analysis methods raises the question of how generalizable their approach is to neurons in other nervous systems. Many of the conclusions and error quantifications hinge on the localization of presynaptic input synapses to twigs and the distribution of inputs across twigs. The authors draw the somewhat obvious conclusion that the localization of synapses along neurites will alter the impact of tracing errors. If, however, the morphologies of vertebrate/mammalian neurons are substantially more intricate, it is not clear how many of the principles described in the manuscript will carry over. I am thinking of, for example, thin 100 nm unmyelinated cortical axons extending over millimeters of path length where single errors could significantly impact a connectivity matrix by mis-assignment of all synapses downstream of an error. I commend the authors of making full use of the benefits of Drosophila neuroanatomy, but I remain unsure that many of their conclusions are generally applicable to neurons/circuits in other species.</i>"
