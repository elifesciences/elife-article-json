The activation of WASP constitutes a key pathway for actin filament nucleation. Yet, when WASP function is eliminated there is negligible effect on actin polymerization at the immunological synapse, leading to gaps in our understanding of the events connecting WASP and calcium ion signaling. Here, we identify a fraction of total synaptic F-actin selectively generated by WASP in the form of distinct F-actin \u2018foci\u2019. These foci are polymerized de novo as a result of the T cell receptor (TCR) proximal tyrosine kinase cascade, and facilitate distal signaling events including PLC\u03b31 activation and subsequent cytoplasmic calcium ion elevation. We conclude that WASP generates a dynamic F-actin architecture in the context of the immunological synapse, which then amplifies the downstream signals required for an optimal immune response."

The activation of WASP constitutes a key pathway for actin filament nucleation. Yet, when WASP function is eliminated there is negligible effect on actin polymerization at the immunological synapse, leading to gaps in our understanding of the events connecting WASP and calcium ion signaling. Here, we identify a fraction of total synaptic F-actin selectively generated by WASP in the form of distinct F-actin \u2018foci\u2019. These foci are polymerized de novo as a result of the T cell receptor (TCR) proximal tyrosine kinase cascade, and facilitate distal signaling events including PLC\u03b31 activation and subsequent cytoplasmic calcium ion elevation. We conclude that WASP generates a dynamic F-actin architecture in the context of the immunological synapse, which then amplifies the downstream signals required for an optimal immune response."

All of these ligands when presented with ICAM1 in supported lipid bilayers (SLB) trigger a series of changes in T cell synaptic cytoskeleton and morphology (<a href=\"#bib12\">Campi et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Kaizuka et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Burkhardt et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Ilani et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Beemiller et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Kumari et al., 2012</a>).

One such context is provided by the loss of an actin effector protein\u2014Wiscott Aldrich Syndrome Protein (WASP). F-actin polymerization relies on regulatory factors such as nucleation promoting factors (NPFs) and downstream nucleation factors such as Arp2/3 complex (<a href=\"#bib5\">Blanchoin et al., 2000</a>). WASP is a hematopoietic-cell-specific NPF activated downstream of TCR, originally identified as a target of loss-of-function mutations in the X-linked immunodeficiency Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) (<a href=\"#bib24\">Derry et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Machesky and Insall, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Takenawa and Miki, 2001</a>).

As an NPF, WASP binds to Arp2/3 and G-actin, increasing the ability of Arp2/3 to nucleate actin branches from existing filaments. Moreover, WASP binds hematopoietic lineage cell-specific protein 1 (HS1) through its SH3 domain (<a href=\"#bib22\">Dehring et al., 2011</a>). HS1 is also activated in response to TCR stimulation (<a href=\"#bib80\">Taniuchi et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Gomez et al., 2006</a>) and can weakly activate Arp2/3 complex, as well as stabilize branched F-actin filaments (<a href=\"#bib87\">Weaver et al., 2001</a>). HS1 deficient T cells show defects similar to WASP\u2212/\u2212 T cells in TCR activation dependent calcium elevation, proliferation, IL-2 secretion and NFAT activation (<a href=\"#bib80\">Taniuchi et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Hutchcroft et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Gomez et al., 2006</a>). It is therefore possible that a previously uncharacterized subclass of the synaptic F-actin network at the TCR MC that represent a small fraction of total synaptic F-actin, is generated by WASP and stabilized by HS1, supports calcium signaling. Alternatively, it has also been proposed that WASP is a modular scaffolding protein capable of interacting with other proteins of the TCR signalosome, independent of its role as an NPF (<a href=\"#bib36\">Huang et al., 2005</a>). Although these two hypotheses are not mutually exclusive, an F-actin dependent role could be addressed by identifying the F-actin network in the immunological synapse to which WASP contributes, and independently targeting this network to investigate the role of the WASP-generated F-actin subpopulation in calcium signaling at the synapse. Thus, WASP can be utilized as a tool to probe for functionally distinct organizational categories of F-actin within the synapse."

TCR ligation triggers a molecular program that results in activation of phospholipase C-\u03b31 (PLC\u03b31), through phosphorylation on Y-783 by Itk (<a href=\"#bib58\">Park et al., 1991</a>). Once it has been activated, phospho-PLC\u03b31 catalyzes the conversion of phosphatidylinositol-4,5 bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>) to inositol trisphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>) and diacylglycerol. IP<sub>3</sub> then acts as a second messenger and facilitates release of calcium ions from intracellular stores. Following TCR activation, PLC\u03b31 recruitment at the synapse is primarily mediated via binding to linker of activated T cells (LAT) (<a href=\"#bib7\">Braiman et al., 2006</a>). Additionally, recent studies using Jurkat T cells and thymocytes have reported a role for the cortical cytoskeleton in both promoting and inhibiting PLC\u03b31 activation (<a href=\"#bib1\">Babich et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Tan et al., 2014</a>). Although PLC\u03b31 binds F-actin in biochemical assays, and loss of F-actin dynamics led to reduced PLC\u03b31 phosphorylation in Jurkat T cells (<a href=\"#bib21\">DeBell et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Carrizosa et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Patsoukis et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Babich et al., 2012</a>), the dependence of PLC\u03b31 activation on WASP activity has not been tested in primary T cells. We hypothesize that WASP and HS1 generate an F-actin network that maintains phosphorylation of PLC\u03b31 at the synapse, accounting for their role in calcium ion elevation (<a href=\"#bib16\">Carrizosa et al., 2009</a>)."

The results presented here identify and functionally characterize a WASP-dependent actin network at the immunological synapse that regulates phospho-PLC\u03b31 levels at TCR MC and calcium ion elevation in T cells. This network is visualized as F-actin foci that result from new F-actin actin polymerization at TCR MC. Disruption of these actin foci does not impair initial synapse formation or early TCR signaling. Importantly, disruption of the F-actin foci using a selective Arp2/3 complex inhibitor also spares early TCR signaling, but results in the same impairment in HS-1 and PLC-\u03b31 activation that has been observed in WASP deficient T cells. Defining a new F-actin network in the immunological synapse, and its molecular regulation, furthers our mechanistic understanding of the cytoskeletal regulation of T cell activation and its dysfunction in WAS pathology."

To resolve dynamic F-actin networks, we employed a labeling strategy designed to highlight growing filament ends (<a href=\"#bib30\">Furman et al., 2007</a>). A 1 min pulse of Rhodamine-ATP-G-actin in live-permeabilized cells identified freshly incorporated subunits (Fresh F-actin), while subsequent fixation and Alexa488-phalloidin staining identified total F-actin. T cells synapses were visualized using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRF) to selectively illuminate structures within 200 nm of the interface. WT T cells exhibited discrete F-actin rich features (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, arrowheads). We refer to these structures as F-actin \u2018foci\u2019. To selectively extract and quantify F-actin foci from the lamellar actin background, we utilized a spatial frequency-filter based local background correction method (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> graph, <a href=\"#fig1s1 fig1s2\">Figure1\u2014figure supplement 1A,2</a>, \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). This foci extraction method is capable of reliably identifying foci on a variable background of lamellar F-actin (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Assessment of the amount of newly polymerized actin in foci vs surrounding lamellar areas using the above-mentioned labeling and quantification method revealed that the F-actin foci incorporate fresh actin subunits (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). This indicates that the foci are dynamically polymerizing structures, rather than sites where F-actin accumulates due to rearrangement of preexisting filaments. Furthermore, the polymerization rate of individual filaments (Fresh/Total ratio) is similar between foci and surrounding areas in WT T cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), indicating that the foci result from preferential local nucleation, rather than enhanced polymerization rate of existing filaments. When compared at the whole synapse scale, overall synaptic F-actin levels, as well as the rate of actin polymerization were similar in WT and WASP\u2212/\u2212 T cells, as expected (<a href=\"#bib13\">Cannon and Burkhardt, 2004</a>). However, there was a significant reduction in F-actin foci in WASP\u2212/\u2212 cell synapse (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>), suggesting that dynamic F-actin foci are formed in a WASP dependent manner. The loss of foci in WASP\u2212/\u2212 T cells is not due to non-specific developmental defects, since acute siRNA mediated knockdown of WASP in activated mouse CD4 T cells resulted in a similar phenotype to the WASP\u2212/\u2212 T cells. No reduction in total F-actin and significant reductions in foci were observed in WASP siRNA transfected cells imaged on SLB with anti-CD3 and ICAM1 (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). This lack of effect on total F-actin in WASP deficient or depleted cells may be attributed to the fact that these foci contribute to &lt;10% of the total synaptic F-actin intensity (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a> top graph), or perhaps to a compensatory increase in the lamellar and lamellipodial actin when more ATP-G-actin is available for polymerization regulated by other NPFs such as WAVE2. These results indicate that WASP dependent F-actin foci form in the T cell synapse."

Briefly, we first used a rank filter selecting for the 25<sup>th</sup>, 50<sup>th</sup> (median) or 75<sup>th</sup> percentile intensity value in a 1.6 \u00d7 1.6 \u00b5m moving window, to extract the \u2018background image\u2019. This \u2018background image\u2019 was then subtracted from the raw image to generate a high-pass filtered image where we could clearly visualize F-actin foci. The processed image was manually checked for co-localization of F-actin foci with the F-actin foci in the raw image. As shown in the \u2018merge\u2019 panel, the 50% rank filter was found to be most optimal for F-actin foci extraction, while the 25% filter overestimated and 75% filter underestimated the number of F-actin foci. The 50% rank filter corrected image was therefore used to quantify F-actin foci per cell, as indicated in the corresponding figure legends. In some experiments, this processing was also carried out for TCR and ICAM1 image, to estimate co-localization between F-actin foci and TCR MC. (<b>B</b>) Characterization of range of F-actin foci intensities to assess the efficacy of foci extraction method. Intensities of pixels corresponding to foci were quantified in raw images (upper graph) or in images generated using 50% intensity rank filtering (\u2018Background images\u2019, lower graph). CD4 T cells were incubated with bilayer containing MHCp and ICAM1 for 2 min, fixed, and stained with Alexa488-phalloidin (F-actin). TIRF images of the T cell synapse were processed to extract F-actin foci as described above in (<b>A</b>). These foci were used to create a binary mask to outline the foci or total synaptic cell regions in either original raw images (upper graph) or background images (lower graph). Each graph shows the intensity distribution of individual pixels corresponding to foci or total synapse area, and the X-axis represents the binned pixel intensity, normalized to the mean synaptic F-actin intensity from each cell's raw image. The Y-axis represents the number of pixels in the foci or synapse area, normalized to either the total number of pixels in the synapse (\u2018/total number of pixels\u2019 traces), or to only the total number of pixels in the foci area (\u2018/foci pixels\u2019 trace). The data is represented as the mean number of pixels from 13 cells \u00b1SEM. It is notable that the number of pixels encompassing foci regions is &lt;10% of total number of pixels (top left graph). Also note that in both raw and background images, the pixels in foci do not exclude the high-intensity range, suggesting that our foci identification method does not preclude foci in high intensity neighborhoods, and identifies higher intensity patches even in high background neighborhood."

NWASP (WASL) is a close homolog of WASP and is capable of compensating for WASP's function in T cell development (<a href=\"#bib20\">Cotta-de-Almeida et al., 2007</a>). However, primary CD4 T cells from <i>Wasl\u2212/\u2212</i> mice (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>) formed immunological synapses with F-actin foci similar to T cells from WT mice. WAVE2 is required for immunological synapse formation itself (<a href=\"#bib54\">Nolz et al., 2006</a>), thus we could not examine synaptic foci in WAVE2 deficient T cells. Instead, we determined the localization of NWASP and WAVE2 in the immunological synapse in order to gain further insight into their possible role in foci formation. Activation of T cells with anti-CD3 and ICAM1 recruited NWASP and WAVE2 to the IS (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib54\">Nolz et al., 2006</a>), but the recruited proteins failed to co-localize with F-actin foci (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4B</a>, NWASP coloc. = 9.48% \u00b1 0.76 n = 78; WAVE2 coloc. = 14.36% \u00b1 1.25, n = 54). We were unable to identify suitable reagents for staining of endogenous WASP in the immunological synapse. These results demonstrate that NWASP does not contribute to F-actin foci and suggest that WAVE2 is unlikely to contribute directly to formation of F-actin foci."

                                "text": "In addition to WASP, deficiency of HS1, a cortactin-related NPF, also leads to reduced calcium ion signaling in T cells (<a href=\"#bib32\">Gomez et al., 2006</a>). Therefore, we examined the role of HS1 in generation of F-actin foci using T cells from WT and HS1\u2212/\u2212 mice. F-actin foci formation was only marginally impaired in HS1\u2212/\u2212 T cells, this reduction was modest compared to T cells from mice lacking both HS1 and WASP (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). A similar marginal reduction in F-actin foci intensity was obtained by siRNA-mediated knockdown of HS1 in activated mouse CD4 T cells (<a href=\"#fig1s5\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5A</a>). HS1 is phosphorylated on Y397 (phospho-HS1) during T cell activation (<a href=\"#bib37\">Hutchcroft et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Gomez et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Carrizosa et al., 2009</a>). We next determined if this phosphorylation is WASP dependent. WT mouse CD4 T cells activated with anti-CD3 and ICAM1 displayed foci of phospho-HS1 in the synapse (<a href=\"#fig1s5\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5B</a>). These phospho-HS1 foci were significantly reduced in WASP\u2212/\u2212 or WASP\u2212/\u2212 NWASP\u2212/\u2212 CD4 T cells, but not in CD4 T cells from NWASP deficient mice (<a href=\"#fig1s5\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5B</a>). Thus, HS1 is recruited to the T cell synapse in a WASP dependent manner."

In murine polyclonal CD4 T cells activated on anti-CD3 and ICAM1 containing bilayers, as in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, TCR MC localized with F-actin foci (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, upper panels, arrows). Similar co-localization of F-actin foci with TCR MC was observed with monoclonal AND TCR transgenic T cells stimulated with MHCp and ICAM1 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, lower panels). The tracking of TCR with H57 Fab allowed accurate quantification of co-localization between TCR and F-actin. After 1 min of cell attachment, 40 \u00b1 1.7% of TCR MCs co-localized with F-actin foci in these cells (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>, \u2018Materials and methods\u2019, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), significantly above chance level co-localization (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), whereas only 15 \u00b1 0.07% of total ICAM1 exhibited association with actin foci (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), which was not different from chance. When examined in Human primary CD4 T cells as well, F-actin foci formed in WASP-dependent manner (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A,B</a>), and TCR MCs, but not ICAM1 MCs, were associated with F-actin foci (TCR co-localization with F-actin foci was 34.5% \u00b1 2.0, n = 76, co-localization of ICAM1 with F-actin foci was 13.1% \u00b1 0.8, n = 66) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,D</a>). Furthermore, TCR-activation led to HS1 phosphorylation at the T cell synapse, as shown previously (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib37\">Hutchcroft et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Gomez et al., 2006</a>), and the phospho-HS1 co-localized with F-actin foci in both TCR-activation stimuli (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>). This indicated that TCR-MCs associated foci exist in a variety of primary CD4 T cells including mouse and human primary T cells, stimulated with diverse TCR-triggering contexts, namely anti-CD3 and peptide-MHC complexes."

The images show snapshots of TIRF images for the indicated time points from the start of observation. The circle on the top left of the t = 235 s image tracks an example TCR MC that exhibits movement along with F-actin foci in subsequent frames, until it finally merges with cSMAC, concomitant with disappearance of actin foci. The images on the right show kymographs obtained from the central section of the cell (marked with white bar in 260 s \u2018merge\u2019 panel).

High magnification microscopy of T cell synapses formed by mouse CD4 T cells on anti-CD3 and ICAM1 SLB provided insight into both synaptic and non-synaptic F-actin organization (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a>, <a href=\"#media1 media2\">Videos 1\u20132</a>). As expected (<a href=\"#bib76\">Stinchcombe et al., 2006</a>), the F-actin signal progressively decreases toward the synapse center where central TCR MC are devoid of F-actin foci (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a>, asterisks in the \u2018Merge\u2019 panel). To eliminate the possibility that the lack of foci on TCR MC in the nascent cSMAC is a consequence of cell fixation methodology, we examined foci in live T cells by transfecting them with LifeAct-GFP, a peptide construct that selectively labels F-actin (<a href=\"#bib64\">Riedl et al., 2008</a>). Since primary mouse T cells showed poor survival after transfection, we used human primary CD4 T cells that exhibit higher viability (<a href=\"#bib17\">Chicaybam et al., 2013</a>). In live cell synapses, LifeAct-GFP was observed to form foci on TCR MCs, which continued to co-migrate until the delivery of MCs to the cSMAC (<a href=\"#fig2s5\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 5</a>, <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>). Analysis of kymographs revealed that the average TCR MC speed was 5.66 \u00b1 2.2 \u03bcm/min, average Foci speed was 6.63 \u00b1 3.1 \u03bcm/min (p <i>= 0.21</i>, <i>ns</i>). The TCR signals persisted in the cSMAC, whereas the GFP foci were extinguished, consistent with continual nucleation of F-actin at the MC site (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) until it reaches the cSMAC, where TCR signals are known to be terminated (<a href=\"#bib85\">Vardhana et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Choudhuri et al., 2014</a>)."

Consistent with this, phospho-SFK localized to F-actin foci associated MC (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Furthermore, inhibition of SFK phosphorylation using PP2 (<a href=\"#bib86\">Varma et al., 2006</a>) significantly reduced the number of F-actin foci (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>), indicating that TCR-driven SFK signaling is required for their formation.

PLC\u03b31 is one of the key effector molecules regulating calcium ion flux downstream of TCR-activation, which mediates inositol-1,3,4-trisphosphate synthesis in the plasmamembrane, thereby facilitating calcium ion release from endoplasmic reticulum stores (<a href=\"#bib21\">DeBell et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Babich et al., 2012</a>). In addition, there is evidence that PLC\u03b31 can bind to F-actin (<a href=\"#bib16\">Carrizosa et al., 2009</a>). We therefore reasoned that F-actin foci may locally enrich PLC\u03b31 at the TCR MC, supporting PLC\u03b31 interaction with TCR signalosome effectors such as Itk and LAT, thereby promoting its phosphorylation and activation (<a href=\"#bib7\">Braiman et al., 2006</a>). We therefore assessed the role of WASP in PLC\u03b31 activation in WT and WASP\u2212/\u2212 T cells. WASP\u2212/\u2212 T cells exhibited significantly reduced phospho-PLC\u03b31 levels at the synapse (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). The reduction in phospho-PLC\u03b31 levels was not due to a general decrease in total PLC\u03b31 levels in the WASP\u2212/\u2212 T cells, as the levels of total cellular PLC\u03b31 were comparable in WT and WASP\u2212/\u2212 whole T cell lysates (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Thus, a loss of WASP-driven F-actin foci is correlated with impairment of PLC\u03b31 activation at the synapse."

                                "text": "We next asked whether the well-established role of WASP in T cell calcium ion signaling pathway could be accounted for by F-actin foci, or by other pathways involving WASP-dependent protein\u2013protein interactions. WASP is a scaffolding protein and interacts with a variety of proteins at MCs (<a href=\"#bib81\">Thrasher and Burns, 2010</a>). To distinguish between two possible roles of WASP, activating Arp2/3 complex to generate F-actin foci, or acting as a direct molecular scaffold, in the regulation of PLC\u03b31 activation at the synapse, we overexpressed mutant forms of human WASP, including an Arp2/3-activation deficient form (WASP \u0394473\u2013480 or WASP\u0394C) and SFK scaffolding deficient form (WASPY291F) in human CD4 T cells. WASP binds with Arp2/3 via its C-terminal verprolin-homology, central, acidic (VCA) domain, while a stretch of hydrophobic residues in the central domain is reported to facilitate Arp2/3 activation without affecting the binding of Arp2/3 to the acidic domain (<a href=\"#bib45\">Machesky and Insall, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Panchal et al., 2003</a>). WASP\u0394C lacks this Arp2/3 activation sequence within the C-region (<a href=\"#bib40\">Kato et al., 1999</a>) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, schematic). Indeed, T cells expressing GFP-WASP\u0394C showed normal levels of Arp2/3 complex recruitment (data not shown), as well as total F-actin at the synapse, and synaptic recruitment of WASP\u0394C was comparable to WT WASP (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,D</a>). However, WASP\u0394C expressing cells were severely defective in F-actin foci generation, as well as in PLC\u03b31 phosphorylation at the synapse (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,D</a>). This result indicates that WASP-dependent Arp2/3 activation is essential for foci genesis and activation of calcium ion signaling effector PLC\u03b31 at the synapse. Overexpression of WASP Y291F (<a href=\"#bib27\">Dovas et al., 2009</a>), a mutant form defective in phosphorylation dependent interaction with SH2 domain of SFKs (<a href=\"#bib56\">Padrick and Rosen, 2010</a>), had no effect on foci formation or PLC\u03b31 activation. This result suggests that WASP's scaffolding of SFKs via Y291 does not play a role in foci formation or PLC\u03b31 phosphorylation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Together these results demonstrate a critical requirement of WASP's Arp2/3 activation and foci nucleation ability for PLC\u03b31 activation. Thus, decoupling of WASP's interactions in MC from the ability to activate the Arp2/3 complex, but not SFKs, results in a strong disruption of F-actin foci."

A previous study utilizing shRNA-mediated silencing of the Arp2/3 complex subunits in Jurkat T cells had demonstrated that actin polymerization at the synapse can occur independent of the Arp2/3 complex (<a href=\"#bib31\">Gomez et al., 2007</a>). However, the high-resolution subsynaptic distribution of Arp2/3 complex at the primary T cell synapse remains unknown. We first assessed the association of Arp2/3 complex with TCR MCs. A significant fraction of endogenous Arp2/3 complex is recruited at the TCR MC sites (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). In T cells treated with CK666, a small molecule inhibitor affecting conformational change in Arp2/3 complex and thus actin nucleation (<a href=\"#bib53\">Nolen et al., 2009</a>), the association of both Arpc2 and 3 with TCR MCs was reduced (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). The same treatment conditions also led to loss of F-actin foci (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). As a control, CK689, an inactive isomer of CK666 (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), and the inhibitor for another class of actin nucleation factors, formins (<a href=\"#bib65\">Rizvi et al., 2009</a>), or inhibition of myosin II using blebbistatin (<a href=\"#bib77\">Straight et al., 2003</a>), did not inhibit F-actin foci (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>), indicating that these foci specifically require Arp2/3 complex for nucleation, and myosin-mediated actin rearrangement is not required for their formation."

Given the small size and large lamellar actin background at the primary T cell synapse as well as highly mobile nature of MCs, this analysis would be extremely challenging to perform in the bilayer system. Therefore, we activated T cells on micron-scale anti-CD3 dots adsorbed on a glass surface where the remaining space was coated with ICAM1 in an attempt to restrict TCR signaling to a known, micron scale location in an artificial immunological synapse. Due to their aforementioned performance in time-lapse studies after transfection, human CD4 T cells were utilized for LifeAct-GFP transfection and live imaging on anti-CD3 microdots. Incubation with the patterned surface triggered rapid actin polymerization at the anti-CD3 microdot, reflected in LifeAct-GFP accumulation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C\u2013E</a>). This enrichment of LifeAct at the microdot was not due to the topography of the cell contact interface (<a href=\"#bib55\">Owen et al., 2013</a>), since a global membrane labeling dye, DiI, and integrin LFA1 were not enriched at these sites (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2A,B</a>). Within 5 s of CK666 treatment, pre-existing LifeAct enrichment was lost from the microdot site (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C\u2013E</a> <a href=\"#media5\">Video 5</a>) and fresh microdot contact events failed to elicit LifeAct-GFP enrichment in the presence of CK666 (<a href=\"#media5\">Video 5</a>). These data confirm that the TCR engagement sites dictate Arp2/3 complex-dependent F-actin foci formation at the synapse, de novo. Furthermore, ligand microdots can spatially pattern F-actin foci by predefining the sites of TCR engagement, and thus provide a suitable platform for spatially isolating TCR dependent mechanisms."

                                "text": "We have shown above that WASP's foci forming ability is required for PLC\u03b31 activation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). In order to test whether the independent elimination of foci by perturbation of Arp2/3 complex would phenocopy this effect, we chose to deplete foci using CK666 and monitor the consequences of this treatment on early TCR signaling, PLC\u03b31 activation and subsequent calcium ion signaling. CK666 treatment, which resulted in severe inhibition of F-actin foci (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), did not diminish TCR-proximal activation events. While fewer T cells formed synapses after CK666 treatment (37% reduction), upon adhesion, F-actin dependent processes including formation of TCR MC and exclusion of CD45 phosphatase from MCs (<a href=\"#bib12\">Campi et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib86\">Varma et al., 2006</a>) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>), and the phosphorylation of Zap70 on Y319 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>) proceeded normally in CK666-treated cells. In addition, other TCR-activation dependent signaling events leading to calcium flux, such as the phosphorylation of LAT on Y171 and SLP76 on Y145 were not altered in CK666-treated cells in comparison to control treated cells (data not shown). However, a severe defect was observed in the levels of TCR-induced PLC\u03b31 phosphorylation on Y783 after CK666 treatment (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C,D</a>), where a drop was observed in both the number and intensity of phospho-PLC\u03b31 clusters at the synapse (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Furthermore, while phospho-PLC\u03b31 localized with F-actin foci in control cells, treatment with CK666 led to loss of foci-associated phospho-PLC\u03b31 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Upon attenuation of F-actin foci, total PLC\u03b31 levels were also reduced at the synapse, matching the decline in phospho-PLC\u03b31 levels (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>) and indicating that the impaired levels of phospho-PLC\u03b31 at the whole cell level may be accounted for by the reduction in PLC\u03b31 enrichment at the TCR signalosome. When assaying signaling events downstream of PLC\u03b31 activation, such as TCR-induced calcium ion elevation in the cytoplasm and nuclear mobilization of NFAT1, CK666-treated cells showed significant reduction in these processes (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G,H</a>). Although a reduction in lamellipodial and lamellar actin was observed in CK666 treated cells (mean total F-actin 42% reduced), this reduction was relatively lower than foci depletion (mean 67% reduced) or under global F-actin depletion (CytoD, mean F-actin 90% reduced), and did not affect early TCR signaling (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). We thus conclude that WASP and Arp2/3 dependent foci play a non-redundant role in PLC\u03b31 activation and calcium ion signaling at the synapse. In line with this result, CK666-treated cells exhibited a loss of phospho-HS1, as well as HS1, at the synapse (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>), similar to that observed in WASP\u2212/\u2212 T cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). Similar to the TCR-distal signaling defects observed in CK666 treated mouse CD4 T cells described above, CK666-treated human CD4 T cells also displayed a reduction in phospho-PLC\u03b31, but not in phospho-Zap70 (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), indicating that foci-dependent PLC\u03b31 activation cascade is conserved in T cells from diverse origins."

PLC\u03b31 localized with TCR microclusters in live cell synapse, and this distribution was lost upon treatment of cells with CK666 (<a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). As a control, the association of human Zap70-GFP with MC was maintained after CK666 treatment (<a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). However, due the mobile nature of MC, it was challenging to follow individual cluster before and after CK666 treatment in this setting. We thus chose to utilize anti-CD3 microdots to activate human T cells. Human CD4 T cells expressing PLC\u03b31-YFP were incubated with micron-size immobile anti-CD3 dots, and visualized using live cell imaging immediately after cell attachment. Similar to F-actin foci assembly at the microdot, PLC\u03b31 enrichment was also visible at the microdot sites. CK666 treatment of cells led to a reduction of PLC\u03b31 enrichment at microdots (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6I,J</a>). These data show that TCR MC associated F-actin foci assist in sustained accumulation of PLC\u03b31 at the TCR MC."

Thus we utilized an activated cultured endothelial cells (EC) based planar APC system, where a flat synaptic interface is formed that is ideal for <i>en-face</i> visualization (<a href=\"#bib67\">Sage et al., 2012</a>). Using this system, F-actin and HS1 rich \u2018invadopod-like-protrusions\u2019 (ILPs) are observed at TCR MC-like features in the periphery of the synapse (<a href=\"#bib67\">Sage et al., 2012</a>). We found that ILPs were associated with the Y397 phosphorylated form of HS1, similar to F-actin foci (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). Furthermore, when pre-formed T cell-EC conjugates were treated with CK666, there was concomitant loss of ILPs and phospho-HS1, indicating that these structures also require Arp2/3-dependent continuous polymerization of F-actin, and support local phospho-HS1 levels (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013C</a>). Since CK666-treatment also led to a reduction in total synaptic F-actin, which could be a consequence of inhibition of the EC cytoskeleton (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013C</a>), we utilized specific shRNA-mediated reduction in WASP levels in T cells, and examined foci (ILPs), total F-actin and phospho-HS1 levels at the T cell-EC conjugate interface (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,B</a>). WASP silenced T cells display selective loss of both ILPs as well as phospho-HS1, while maintaining total F-actin levels (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A\u2013C</a>). Therefore, the F-actin foci that we have primarily been characterized using SLB in this study, are the counterparts of ILPs in the cell conjugate system, and are necessary for efficient T cell activation. Thus, F-actin foci may represent a cytoskeletal module that functions to optimally support TCR distal signaling (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>) in diverse antigen presenting contexts."

The conjugates were then imaged using an EMCCD-coupled spinning disc confocal microscope. Each image represents a single confocal plane of T cell synapse, where the planar endothelial interface is in focus.

(<b>C</b>) Model of temporal sequence of events leading to F-actin foci formation and PLC\u03b3 signaling at the immunological synapse. Multiple pathways can result in actin polymerization and remodeling at the synaptic interface, contributing to F-actin organization in different SMAC zones. One such pathway involves WAVE2 recruitment by activated LFA1, followed by WAVE2 dependent Arp2/3 complex activation resulting in thick lamellipodial (dSMAC) and lamellar (pSMAC) F-actin meshworks. WAVE2-dependent F-actin pool is required for calcium-dependent calcium entry via the CRAC channel. Additional pathways including MyosinII-mediated actin remodeling is required for maintaining lamellar actin flow and directional persistence of microclusters (MCs) towards the cSMAC, and formin-mediated nucleation of F-actin promotes MTOC docking and stability of synapse. Another pool of F-actin or \u2018F-actin foci\u2019 is generated by the activity of WASP protein in the p- and dSMAC zones. Following TCR triggering, WASP is recruited at TCR signalosome via several possible mechanisms \u2013 such as via Vav, via NCK, via Zap70 and CrkL mediated WIP release and other effector mechanisms, and, through Fyn or PIP2 or PTP-PEST-binding at the plasma membrane (PM). Once activated, WASP recruits Arp2/3 complex to the MC, which then leads to actin branch nucleation and polymerization at the MC, over and above the local background actin. This process continues even during MC movement in the lamellar region, with a high F-actin turnover at the foci until its delivery to the cSMAC. In the foci, HS1 is recruited via binding both the Arp2/3 complex as well as F-actin, and is subsequently phosphorylated. As a consequence of early TCR signaling, PLC\u03b31 is also recruited to the MC signalosome, where it is stabilized via interactions with both F-actin, and foci residing HS1. F-actin foci dynamics in the proximity of the plasma membrane further support PLC\u03b31 phosphorylation, potentially by facilitating its interaction with PM-bound, upstream activators such as Itk. Phosphorylation of PLC\u03b31 by Itk then triggers phosphoinositide signaling, which in turn initiates calcium ion flux and NFAT1 activation. WASP deficiency or failure to activate Arp2/3 complex by WASP\u0394C mutant leads to selective loss of nucleation of foci at the MC. As a result, early signaling is not affected, however, both HS1 and PLC\u03b31 levels are severely reduced at the microcluster sites. The remaining PLC\u03b31 at synapse allows cell spreading and synapse formation, however, it is not sufficient to achieve calcium flux comparable to the control cells. Direct pharmacological inhibition of Arp2/3 complex using CK666 yields similar results; early TCR signaling is preserved while PLC\u03b31 phosphorylation and late signaling are severely perturbed. As actin polymerizing processes other than WASP also utilize Arp2/3 Complex, CK666-treated cells show a general reduction in lamellipodial and lamellar actin as well. However, the remaining F-actin levels are sufficient to support early TCR signaling. In contrast, total F-actin depolymerization at the synapse using CytochalasinD results in defects in early as well as late signaling, as has been reported in earlier studies. The image on the bottom shows a maximum intensity projection of synaptic contact interface of a human primary CD4 T cell, acquired using spinning disc confocal microscope. This cell was activated on a bilayer reconstituted with Alexa568 tagged anti-CD3 (red) and ICAM1 (unlabeled), for 2 min, fixed and stained for F-actin (green), and imaged."

At the immunological synapse, the compartmentalization of TCR signalosome proteins is regulated for optimal function (<a href=\"#bib29\">Fooksman et al., 2010</a>). It is therefore surprising that cytoskeletal behavior is routinely measured as an all-or-none response of total polymerized F-actin, effectively ignoring different F-actin network subpopulations that could have distinct contributions to specific steps of the TCR signaling process. The WASP-dependent F-actin microarchitecture at the TCR MC that we report here is an important example. These F-actin \u2018foci\u2019 facilitate specific downstream TCR signaling steps, including PLC\u03b31 activation and calcium ion elevation, but are not required for TCR MC formation and other proximal signaling events such as Zap70 phosphorylation. Our study has shown that, when F-actin foci are depleted by WASP deficiency or CK666 treatment, the remaining lamellipodial and lamellar F-actin networks are not able to support optimal PLC\u03b31 activation, indicating that actin foci are indeed necessary for this later signaling step. Furthermore, we found that the molecular machinery associated with \u2018flat\u2019 TCR MC formed on planar substrates is the same as that in the distinctly three-dimensional ILP structures formed in T cell interfaces with antigen presenting endothelial cells. Others have noted the three dimensional nature of T-APC synapses that appear to have a classical immunological synapse/SMAC architecture (<a href=\"#bib8\">Brossard et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Biggs et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Roybal et al., 2013</a>).

Ours is the first study, to our knowledge, to have performed a detailed characterization of foci as structures that are polymerized de novo via a WASP dependent mechanism. Previously, it was proposed that similar TCR associated F-actin foci were formed through a buildup of retrogradely flowing F-actin moving over artificially immobilized TCR on chrome micro-barriers in both Jurkat and primary T cells (<a href=\"#bib74\">Smoligovets et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib90\">Yu et al., 2010</a>).

Similarly, in B cells, a thick cortical actin meshwork that is inhibitory for early B cell receptor signaling has been reported (<a href=\"#bib83\">Treanor et al., 2011</a>), but evidence of any \u2018foci-like\u2019 organization is missing. In such cell types, WASP could serve other roles, and may not promote immunoreceptor signaling via foci generation at the synapse."

                                "text": "In the case of both CD4 and CD8 primary T cells, foci are robustly triggered following TCR ligation. In activated mouse T cell blasts, antigen-dependent induction of foci was observed as well; however, a few low intensity actin features were visible in a fraction of T cell blasts activated on ICAM1 in SLB (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). We do not understand the origin of these low-intensity foci. It is possible that foci are generated at a basal level throughout the active signaling state of T cell blasts after initial priming, and antigen re-stimulation is a potent trigger for their formation. Alternatively, it is possible that integrins such as LFA-1 are capable of forming a few transient actin-rich features in activated lymphocytes in a specific chemokine environment, when its ligand ICAM1 is highly expressed. In contrast to the primary T cell systems, we have not detected foci in the Jurkat T cell line activated using the SLB system. A signaling network linking TCR to WASP has been outlined in the Jurkat cells (<a href=\"#bib2\">Barda-Saad et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Thrasher and Burns, 2010</a>), so it is likely this signaling pathway is intact. However, any WASP-dependent foci that may exist in these cells are either smaller than the resolution limit, or are transient in nature and rapidly dissipate into the lamellar network before they can be observed. Interestingly, in Jurkat T cells, the actin polymerizing function of WASP is not required for its role in calcium ion signaling (<a href=\"#bib71\">Silvin et al., 2001</a>), and Arp2/3 silencing does not prevent PLC\u03b31 activation (<a href=\"#bib31\">Gomez et al., 2007</a>). Thus, it is also possible that these cells utilize an alternative WASP-independent cytoskeletal pathway to support TCR-induced calcium ion elevation (<a href=\"#bib1\">Babich et al., 2012</a>), and therefore do not need to utilize foci for this purpose. For example, the lack of negative regulators like PTEN may allow Jurkat cells to sustain calcium ion signals through alterations in lipid metabolism, without F-actin foci. A detailed comparison of the differential organization and function of F-actin modalities between Jurkat cells and the primary T cells will provide fundamental insights into the operation of compensatory cytoskeletal pathways that assist TCR distal signaling and may be important at different developmental stages in the T cell lineage or part of the failure of growth control in malignancy."

The first component is critical for very early signaling events encompassing TCR triggering and the proximal signaling cascade. This fraction is represented by a slow turnover CK666-resistant cortical F-actin pool, which most likely relies on filament remodeling proteins other than actin branching for its dynamics. The second component, the WASP and Arp2/3-dependent F-actin foci network is responsible for assisting PLC\u03b31 activation and calcium ion signaling. Furthermore, in addition to these two networks, there is evidence for a third, CK666-sensitive network that we have not investigated in this study. This network is made up of a fraction of lamellar and lamellipodial F-actin that is rapidly eliminated under even short duration treatments of CK666 based on the reduction in \u2018total F-actin\u2019 (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). This observation indicates that this third sub-population is composed of dynamic F-actin. This network is not required for the early TCR signaling steps that we have tested, indicating that it may play other roles at the synapse that are known to be dependent on F-actin. For example, it may be equivalent to the WAVE2 dependent network that is not required for early TCR signaling or PLC\u03b31-dependent calcium ion efflux from endoplasmic reticulum, but is necessary for CRAC channel mediated calcium ion entry from extracellular medium (<a href=\"#bib54\">Nolz et al., 2006</a>)."

Given the small size of T cells, the highly dynamic nature of their F-actin structures and the pleotropic action of pharmacological inhibitors on all F-actin organizations, it is challenging to dissect the specific roles of these sub-populations during TCR signaling. Thus, further interrogation of these networks will require a combination of genetic tools enabling conditional perturbation, as well as rescue, of Arp2/3 complex and NPFs (<a href=\"#bib51\">Moulding et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Blundell et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Sato et al., 2013</a>), in combination with super-resolution microscopy in primary T cells.

                                "text": "The precise manner by which accumulation at actin foci promotes PLC\u03b31 activation is not clear. There are several possible mechanisms that could underlie this process. First, it is probable that the continual nucleation of F-actin filaments at foci provides a sustained cytoskeletal microenvironment for the enrichment of PLC\u03b31 around the TCR signalosome. As the TCR MC traverses regions with highly variable levels of lamellar F-actin en route to the cSMAC, the foci would provide for the continuous presence of high levels of F-actin at the TCR microcluster, which may in turn ensure continuous local enrichment of PLC\u03b31 at the MC. Second, foci F-actin growing in juxtaposition to the plasma membrane may facilitate the interaction of F-actin bound PLC\u03b31 with its plasma-membrane anchored effectors such as Itk, thereby enhancing its phosphorylation. In this model, the growth of foci would exert force on and push the plasma membrane in its vicinity. Consistent with this mechanism, we find that foci zones mark areas of high membrane tension, observed as the foci-dependent localization and increased phosphorylation of mechanosensory protein CasL (<a href=\"#bib44\">Kumari et al., 2012</a>;; <a href=\"#bib91\">Yu et al., 2012</a>) at the MC-foci sites (Santos et al., manuscript under review). This is also consistent with the manifestation as ILPs on the softer endothelial cell substrates. This observation also implies a possible role of F-actin foci in supporting synapse stability. Previously we have shown that WASP\u2212/\u2212 T cell synapses form normally with normal pSMAC and dSMAC actin organizations, however they lost stability faster than those of WT cells (<a href=\"#bib72\">Sims et al., 2007</a>). It will therefore be interesting to investigate whether the synapse stabilizing role of WASP is mediated by actin foci, and if foci influence pSMAC oscillations, as reported earlier in WASP\u2212/\u2212 cells (<a href=\"#bib72\">Sims et al., 2007</a>)."

The factors contributing to residual calcium ion elevation may be either residual phopspho-PLC\u03b31 in CK666-treated cells, or an additional mechanism of PLC\u03b31 activation that is insensitive to this inhibition. In accordance with this, we do not observe a complete loss of PLC\u03b31 at microdot sites in CK666 treated cells. In contrast to the above mentioned processes that augment calcium ion signaling in mature T cells, there are alternative actin cytoskeletal pathways in immature thymocytes that impinge upon PLC\u03b31, and total F-actin is inhibitory for PLC\u03b31 activation and calcium ion flux (<a href=\"#bib79\">Tan et al., 2014</a>). Detailed examination of F-actin networks in T cells during different developmental stages will clarify how the actin cytoskeleton can generate different activation outcomes at the level of PLC\u03b31 (<a href=\"#bib43\">Kumari et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Roybal et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Malissen et al., 2014</a>)."

WASP\u2212/\u2212 T cells show normal levels of total F-actin at the synapse, but no TCR MC associated F-actin foci. This lack of effect on total F-actin in WASP deficient or depleted cells may be attributed to the fact that the foci contribute to &lt;10% of the total synaptic F-actin intensity (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), and perhaps to a compensatory increase in the background actin networks when more ATP-G-actin is available for polymerization regulated by other NPFs such as WAVE2. We have shown that WASP's role in generating F-actin foci cannot be substituted for by NWASP. This selective requirement for WASP could be due to its specific interactions with upstream activators at the TCR signalosome. For example, a conventional mode of WASP and NWASP activation is through interaction with Cdc42 GTPase, However, WASP recruitment can occur independently of Cdc42 at the T cell synapse (<a href=\"#bib14\">Cannon et al., 2001</a>). In agreement with this, in preliminary experiments, Cdc42\u2212/\u2212 T cells showed normal F-actin foci (data not shown) indicating that these foci form without the aid of Cdc42. Additionally, Cdc42-dependent phosphorylation of WASP at Y291 by SFK is known to increase its affinity for Arp2/3 complex (<a href=\"#bib82\">Torres and Rosen, 2003</a>). Overexpression of a phospho-deficient mutant (WASP Y291F) (<a href=\"#bib6\">Blundell et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Dovas et al., 2009</a>) did not perturb F-actin foci formation or PLC\u03b31 phosphorylation, indicating that the WASP activation pathway utilized for foci formation may be distinct from the upstream regulatory pathways involving Cdc42 activation, or SFK binding at phospho-Y291. While it was not possible to dominantly uncouple TCR MC from PLC\u03b31 activation by over-expressing WASP that is able to activate Arp2/3, but does not interact with SFKs, it is possible that other regulatory phosphorylation sites can scaffold WASP's interaction partners, thereby playing an ancillary role in PLC\u03b31 activation (<a href=\"#bib82\">Torres and Rosen, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Blundell et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Macpherson et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Reicher et al., 2012</a>). These results, and the failure of compensation by NWASP, suggest that WASP is activated and employed in a specialized manner in T cells to generate F-actin foci. The dimerization property of WASP and positive feedback with Arp2/3 complex (<a href=\"#bib56\">Padrick and Rosen, 2010</a>), as well as its role in polarizing micron-scale \u2018lipid rafts\u2019 at the synapse (<a href=\"#bib28\">Dupre et al., 2002</a>) may contribute towards a specific enrichment and involvement of WASP at foci. At this stage, the mechanistic basis for WASP vs NWASP utilization is not understood."

These actin foci provide a signaling scaffold that is required for TCR-distal signaling and play a critical regulatory role in calcium ion signaling. There are significant questions that remain to be answered. For example, we do not yet know the MC-intrinsic properties that temporally regulate F-actin foci formation. We find that \u223c40% of TCR MCs are associated with F-actin foci at steady-state. While a large fraction of remaining clusters are in the central cSMAC region of the cell, previously characterized to be an actin depleted zone containing signaling incompetent TCR (<a href=\"#bib39\">Kaizuka et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib85\">Vardhana et al., 2010</a>), a smaller fraction of foci-unassociated MC resides in the lamellar zone as well. At lamellar zone TCR MCs, it is unclear which MC-intrinsic attributes dictate foci induction, maintenance and subsequent termination of actin nucleation on entry into the cSMAC, and if integrin signaling assists in any of these steps. Further investigation will not only provide a deeper understanding of subsynaptic F-actin dynamics, but will also illuminate other specialized roles that F-actin subpopulations play during the lifetime of a signalosome. The results will also provide deeper insights into signaling compartmentalization of the T cell synapse that is regulated by the actin cytoskeleton and its alteration in WAS pathology."

The authors have developed a novel assay that reveals actin foci that form after activation of the T cell receptor. These have not been noticed before, since this newly polymerized actin represents just a subset of the total actin filament pool. The discovery of distinct types of actin filaments in the T cell is interesting in its own right. These actin foci are associated with TCR microclusters and require WASP and HS-1 for their formation. Interestingly, disruption of the formation of these foci by WASP depletion or Arp2/3 inhibition with CK666 results in the inhibition of PLCg activation and calcium mobilization; however, proximal signaling is not affected. These results provide new insight into the role of actin networks in signaling and also provide a potential explanation of the immunodeficiency defected associated with mutations or knockdown of WASP. This is a very comprehensive and well-conducted study (perhaps a bit dense read in places)."

Ideally, it would have been best to express these in WASP-/- T cells, which they employed in panel a-c of the same figure (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013C</a>). This would rule out potential complications with having endogenous WASP also present (particularly important for the lack of an effect of Y291F expression). Also I do not understand how Y291F serves as a control. This phosphorylation should enhance WASP activation and increase affinity for Arp2/3. Thus, a mutant would be impaired in these activities but still would retain a scaffolding function. Thus, isn't it still possible that WASP activates PLCg by acting as a scaffold? Again, please make the experiments internally consistent (e.g., use WASP-/- cells throughout as recipient cells) and explain the choice of Y291F as a control."

While the foci are marginally more reduced, it is difficult to attribute the defects in calcium flux and NFAT translocation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G, H</a>) to foci reduction rather than lamellipodia and lamellar actin reduction. It might be better to test these downstream signaling defects in WASP deficient cells because depleting WASP appears to be more selective for reducing foci and does not affect lamellar actin structures as much. Further, at least some of the results obtained using CK666 should be confirmed with a more selective approach based on Arp2/3 silencing."

This makes it difficult to estimate the time of formation of these structures. It would be important to investigate the time kinetics of foci formation and of their migration towards cSMAC using time-lapse video microscopy to define whether the kinetics are altered (delayed) upon WASP/Arp2/3 silencing. It would also be interesting to monitor the kinetics of foci formation and of their lifetime in different areas of the synapse (independently of WASP silencing) in parallel with [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] i increases. This approach would allow to establish whether foci formation precedes or not the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] i increase."

However, they do not show a mechanistic link between foci formation and PLC\u03b31. An alternative explanation of the data might be that the WASP pathway might control PLC\u03b31 activation. In turn PLC\u03b31 signaling might promote actin dynamics as suggested by a recent report (A. Brodovitch et al., J Immunol, 2013; 191:2064-2071). To address this point, the authors should investigate the impact of PLC\u03b31 silencing (or of its pharmacological inhibition) on F-actin foci formation and the time kinetics of foci formation and of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i (see above)."

This data is consistent with the previous reports, where TCR-dependent calcium signaling was found to be dysregulated in both WASP-/- mouse as well as WAS human T cells (Introduction). We thus utilized these conserved features of the pathway to overcome the technical limitations of individual experimental systems. As such, a large number of the presented experiments were replicated in both human and mouse antigen and agonist antibody-based systems. However, due to the methodological limitations in some contexts, as outlined below, some of our experiments were more suitable to perform in a specific system."

Thus, even though CK666 is a broad-range inhibitor, its functional consequences highlight a stage -specific role of Arp2/3 and WASP in TCR signaling. It is indeed interesting that a loss of an additional 50% of total F-actin in CK666 treatment, as compared to WASP-/- cells, causes similar defects in late TCR signaling. The functional significance of the large lost fraction of total F-actin is unclear at the moment, however, it is unlikely to impact WASP-dependent calcium ion signaling cascade (Discussion section, paragraph 5)."

Arp3 shRNA or CK666 both reduced cortical actin by about 50%, very similar to our findings in T cells and thus validating our use of the inhibitor over genetic manipulation of Arp2/3 complex. Additionally, given the benefit that CK666 provides better temporal control of Arp2/3 complex inhibition compared to Arp2/3 knockdown, during live imaging of cells, we chose to utilize it for our experiments."

From the results of Huse et al, we know that Calcium flux takes place \u223c6 seconds after TCR ligands become available. The kinetic window between TCR microcluster formation, foci induction and calcium release is too small to be captured distinctively. Tracking individual foci and calcium flux is further complicated by the fact that synapse maturation is a rapid and highly dynamic process, where lamellar fluctuations occur continuously (Sims et al., 2007) and fresh microclusters/foci continue to form and migrate centripetally in the synaptic interface (<a href=\"#fig2s5\">Figure 2\u2013figure supplement 5</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2013figure supplement 3</a>). Therefore, we would have to assay calcium ion dynamics at the sites of individual mobile foci. Additionally, calcium ions rapidly diffuse in the cytoplasm, preventing the recording of calcium ion fluxes at the site of single foci. Thus, given the challenging nature of the process for live cell imaging purpose, and the inadequacy of current imaging methodologies to achieve it, we were unable to pursue this question further."

While this feed-forward involvement of PLC\u03b3 is essential for synapse formation, it is WASP independent. Our current data show that eliminating WASP or inhibiting Arp2/3 complex both decrease, but do not eliminate PLC\u03b3 from TCR microclusters. Therefore, normal synapse formation in WASP deficient T cells is fully consistent with WASP independent PLC\u03b3 activation that is critical for synapse formation.
