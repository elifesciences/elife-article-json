Biological stability of human telomerase RNA (hTR) relies on H/ACA proteins, but other eukaryotes use other RNP assembly pathways. To investigate additional rationale for human telomerase assembly as H/ACA RNP, we developed a minimized cellular hTR. Remarkably, with only binding sites for telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT), minimized hTR assembled biologically active enzyme. TERT overexpression was required for cellular interaction with minimized hTR, indicating that H/ACA RNP assembly enhances endogenous hTR-TERT interaction. Telomere maintenance by minimized telomerase was unaffected by the elimination of the telomerase holoenzyme Cajal body chaperone TCAB1 or the Cajal body scaffold protein Coilin. Surprisingly, wild-type hTR also maintained and elongated telomeres in TCAB1 or Coilin knockout cells, with distinct changes in telomerase action. Overall, we elucidate trafficking requirements for telomerase biogenesis and function and expand mechanisms by which altered telomere maintenance engenders human disease."

Biological stability of human telomerase RNA (hTR) relies on H/ACA proteins, but other eukaryotes use other RNP assembly pathways. To investigate additional rationale for human telomerase assembly as H/ACA RNP, we developed a minimized cellular hTR. Remarkably, with only binding sites for telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT), minimized hTR assembled biologically active enzyme. TERT overexpression was required for cellular interaction with minimized hTR, indicating that H/ACA RNP assembly enhances endogenous hTR-TERT interaction. Telomere maintenance by minimized telomerase was unaffected by the elimination of the telomerase holoenzyme Cajal body chaperone TCAB1 or the Cajal body scaffold protein Coilin. Surprisingly, wild-type hTR also maintained and elongated telomeres in TCAB1 or Coilin knockout cells, with distinct changes in telomerase action. Overall, we elucidate trafficking requirements for telomerase biogenesis and function and expand mechanisms by which altered telomere maintenance engenders human disease."

Maintenance of this telomeric repeat array requires <i>de novo</i> repeat synthesis by the ribonucleoprotein (RNP) reverse transcriptase telomerase to balance the repeat erosion inherent in DNA-dependent DNA-polymerase replication of the genome (<a href=\"#bib5\">Blackburn et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Hug and Lingner, 2006</a>). Telomerase extends chromosome 3' ends by copying a template within the telomerase RNA subunit (hTR in human cells), using an active site in the telomerase reverse transcriptase protein (TERT). The intricate co-folding and co-function of telomerase RNA and TERT obliges a step-wise RNP assembly process and generates a network of protein- and RNA-domain interactions (<a href=\"#bib4\">Blackburn and Collins, 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib33\">Schmidt and Cech, 2015</a>)."

Among the best-studied RNP transit points are Cajal bodies, defined as foci of the protein Coilin (<a href=\"#bib31\">Nizami et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Machyna et al., 2015</a>). Enzymes resident in Cajal bodies catalyze numerous RNA processing and modification reactions as well as RNP assembly and remodeling (<a href=\"#bib26\">Machyna et al., 2013</a>). Beyond RNA processing and RNP biogenesis factors, Cajal bodies also recruit regulatory complexes such as CDK2-cyclinE (<a href=\"#bib24\">Liu et al., 2000</a>) and have widespread influence on gene expression (<a href=\"#bib43\">Wang et al., 2016</a>).

In human cells, telomerase shares the same mature H/ACA proteins (dyskerin, NHP2, NOP10, GAR1) and H/ACA RNP biogenesis chaperones as the intron-encoded small nucleolar (sno) or small Cajal body (sca) RNPs that catalyze cleavage and pseudouridylation of ribosomal and small nuclear RNAs (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kiss et al., 2010</a>). Because precursor hTR is released from its site of synthesis as an autonomous transcript rather than the spliced intron lariat of other human H/ACA RNAs, it is sensitized to degradation in dyskeratosis congenita (DC) patient cells with a mutation of an H/ACA protein (<a href=\"#bib16\">Egan and Collins, 2012b</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Armanios and Blackburn, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Sarek et al., 2015</a>). Also, unlike other H/ACA RNAs, hTR requires a 5' trimethylguanosine cap to prevent 5'-3' exonuclease processing (<a href=\"#bib30\">Mitchell et al., 1999</a>). Models for vertebrate telomerase RNA trafficking suggest an initial transit of Cajal bodies, where 5' trimethylguanosine cap modification is thought to occur, followed by localization to nucleoli (<a href=\"#bib15\">Egan and Collins, 2012a</a>). Subsequent RNP trafficking from nucleoli to steady-state concentration in Cajal bodies depends on the\u00a0binding of the Cajal body chaperone and telomerase holoenzyme protein TCAB1/WDR79/WRAP53\u03b2 to an hTR 3' stem-loop CAB-box motif (<a href=\"#bib41\">Venteicher et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Tycowski et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Zhong et al., 2011</a>), which is present in both stem-loops of an H/ACA scaRNA (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kiss et al., 2010</a>).

Evidence for Cajal body delivery of telomerase to telomeres builds from studies depleting TCAB1 or Coilin using RNA interference, which reduced or eliminated hTR colocalization with telomeres and induced telomere shortening (<a href=\"#bib41\">Venteicher et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Zhong et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Stern et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Zhong et al., 2012</a>).

With all of this experimental support for Cajal body delivery of human telomerase to telomeres, it is puzzling that mouse telomerase RNA does not localize to Cajal bodies (<a href=\"#bib38\">Tomlinson et al., 2010</a>).

As a new approach, we first bypassed the endogenous hTR stability requirement for H/ACA proteins. Remarkably, we found that a minimal hTR (hTRmin) containing only binding sites for TERT can assemble active RNP in cells, and this active RNP can maintain stable telomere length homeostasis. TERT overexpression was required for cellular assembly with hTRmin, suggesting that hTR H/ACA RNP assembly enhances TERT interaction at scarce endogenous telomerase subunit levels. KO of TCAB1 or Coilin did not alter hTRmin RNP function at telomeres. Surprisingly, TCAB1 KO or Coilin KO was also permissive for hTR telomerase to maintain telomeres. In cancer and pluripotent stem cell lines with endogenous hTR and TERT expression, TCAB1 KO resulted in a slow decline of telomere length followed by stable telomere length homeostasis. We conclude that aside from conferring hTR stability and facilitating active telomerase assembly in cells with scarce TERT, hTR assembly as H/ACA RNP is not essential. Also, Cajal body localization is not essential for hTRmin or hTR telomerase to maintain stable telomere length homeostasis. Our findings illuminate the influences of nuclear trafficking on human telomerase biogenesis and action at telomeres, account for why telomerase biogenesis pathways can be so divergent in eukaryotic evolution, and give new interpretation to the mechanisms by which different telomerase subunit mutations impose human disease."

We also tested 6 or 14 nucleotide (nt) lengths of single-stranded RNA spacer separating the t/PK and CR4/5 regions. For 3'-end formation, we tested the MALAT1 triplex motif with or without an adjacent RNase P cleavage site mimicking a pre-tRNA (<a href=\"#bib7\">Brown et al., 2012</a>). We also omitted or included a hepatitis delta virus ribozyme (HDV RZ), which can increase hTR accumulation by stabilizing the precursor 3' end with an exonuclease-resistant 2',3' cyclic phosphate (<a href=\"#bib16\">Egan and Collins, 2012b</a>)."

Accumulation of hTRmin to a level detectable by Northern blot required both the RNA triplex and the RNase P site (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). We next tested if this cellular hTRmin could form active RNP. We transiently co-expressed hTRmin or hTR with 3xFLAG-tagged (F) TERT in the telomerase-negative U2OS cell line and assayed for telomeric primer extension by immunopurified TERT. Cellular reconstitution with hTRmin yielded lower RNA accumulation and proportionally lower overall activity than reconstitution with hTR, but hTRmin and hTR telomerase RNPs had similar profiles of repeat synthesis (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). For continued optimization, we next compared hTRmin accumulation with no 5\u2019 leader, LeaderG, or LeaderC and with 6 nt versus 14 nt spacer (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>), all with the RNA triplex and RNaseP cleavage site. The presence of a 5\u2019 leader increased accumulation, and the quadruplex-mutant LeaderC was as good or better than the native hTR LeaderG (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). Also, the 6 nt spacer between t/PK and CR4/5 was as good or better than the 14 nt spacer (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). HDV RZ addition downstream of the MALAT1 3' processing elements improved hTRmin accumulation from some transfected constructs but did not notably increase accumulation of the optimal LeaderC-containing hTRmin with 6 nt spacer (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>), which in subsequent experiments we designate LhTRmin for distinction from the leader-less hTRmin."

As expected, TERT, dyskerin, and TCAB1 each bound hTR whereas only TERT bound LhTRmin. As in 293T cells, in VA-13 cells both leader-free hTRmin and LhTRmin accumulated, with LhTRmin being optimal (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>). The robust 3' end protection activity of the MALAT1 triplex was evident when it was appended to full-length hTR (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>; note that mature hTR sometimes migrates as a doublet due to in-gel folding). To compare the cellular localizations of LhTRmin and hTR, we overexpressed LhTRmin or hTR with TERT by transient transfection. While hTR concentrated in nuclear puncta as expected, LhTRmin distributed throughout the nucleoplasm (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>). Transfection of cells lacking endogenous hTR (see below) confirmed that hTRmin and LhTRmin have a diffuse nucleoplasmic distribution distinct from that of hTR or hTR with a CAB-box mutation (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>).

After selection, the polyclonal population of targeted cells was assayed for RNA accumulation by Northern blot. Consistent with results from transient transfection, LhTRmin accumulation exceeded that of hTRmin, with or without a downstream HDV RZ (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1I</a>). Stably expressed hTRmin was barely detectable, and even LhTRmin accumulated to a level lower than endogenous hTR (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1I</a>).

All of the LhTRmin cell lines had higher steady-state RNA accumulation than the hTRmin lines (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). LhTRmin levels varied more than hTRmin, and TERT levels varied more in LhTRmin lines than hTRmin lines (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a> and <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>, symbols). Telomerase activity measured by fluorescence quantification of telomeric repeat amplification (QTRAP) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>, bars and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1D</a> for replicates) or hotTRAP (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>) was generally greatest in cell lines with high telomerase subunit expression (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>, compare symbols to bars). Higher telomerase activity in cell extract correlated generally but not absolutely to longer telomere length at homeostasis (compare <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>, bars to <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). We suggest that differences in telomerase subunit expression levels could in part reflect epigenetic differences introduced upon transgene integration, which was an independent event in each clonal cell line. In addition, differences in subunit expression levels could result from the stochastic fluctuation established to occur in many model systems, including HeLa cells (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bryan et al., 1998</a>)."

These High-Telomerase (HiT) polyclonal cell cultures had increased telomere length by the first time point after selection (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Telomere elongation was rapid in TCAB1 KO HiT cell cultures, reaching the limit of length discrimination almost immediately. Rapid telomere elongation in TCAB1 KO cells is consistent with telomere elongation in wild-type HeLa cells by overexpression of CAB-box-mutant hTR (<a href=\"#bib18\">Fu and Collins, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Cristofari et al., 2007</a>). In comparison, Coilin KO HiT cells had less telomere elongation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). These results were replicated in an independently performed HiT conversion of the same cell lines (not shown). Telomeres in both TCAB1 KO and Coilin KO cells elongated upon expression of a truncated POT1 compromised for binding to single-stranded telomeric-repeat DNA (<a href=\"#bib25\">Loayza and De Lange, 2003</a>), expressed by transgene integration at AAVS1 (data not shown). No obvious hTR foci were detected in HCT116 HiT cells lacking TCAB1 or Coilin (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>), indicating that the hTR foci detected in HeLa cells lacking Coilin (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chen et al., 2015</a>) are challenging to detect. We conclude that if telomerase is abundant, TCAB1 is not required to support telomerase-mediated elongation of even relatively long telomeres. Integrating all of the findings of this study, we conclude that human telomerase H/ACA RNP assembly is essential not only for the\u00a0biological stability of hTR but also for active RNP biogenesis at scarce subunit expression levels. In addition, H/ACA RNP assembly gives endogenous-level hESC telomerase the ability to maintain long telomeres. Remarkably, all of these H/ACA RNP assembly roles can be bypassed using hTRmin (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). This plasticity of telomerase RNP biogenesis and holoenzyme composition informs mechanisms of telomerase diversification across eukaryotes."

We set out to uncover the rationale for a\u00a0vertebrate telomerase evolutionary gain of H/ACA RNP biogenesis. H/ACA RNP biogenesis confers hTR biological stability, but across eukaryotes, telomerase RNA stability can be conferred by diverse other RNP assembly pathways. To bypass the essential role of H/ACA proteins in hTR cellular stability, we designed hTRmin RNAs containing the activity-essential hTR motifs and a 3\u2019 triplex structure but not an H/ACA motif. Although hTRmin did not bind H/ACA proteins or TCAB1, it did assemble catalytically active telomerase. The opposite TER redesign strategy was used to test the significance of the relative positioning of a large number of holoenzyme protein binding motifs in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> TLC1 (<a href=\"#bib47\">Zappulla et al., 2005</a>). <i>S. cerevisiae</i> Mini-T retains all of the holoenzyme protein interactions but condenses the length of spacing between them (<a href=\"#bib47\">Zappulla et al., 2005</a>)."

Therefore, most telomerase holoenzyme proteins may serve indirect roles in telomerase function that are readily adapted to evolutionary divergence of nuclear architecture and its cell cycle regulation. Other than hTR biological stability, the contributions of H/ACA RNP assembly, TCAB1, and Cajal bodies to endogenous human telomerase function could all be accounted for by changes in subunit and RNP distribution within the nucleus (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>, right)."

Cellular assembly of minimized hTRmin into catalytically active telomerase RNP required a higher than endogenous expression level of TERT. One simple model for this influence would be that H/ACA RNP biogenesis directs trafficking of assembly-competent hTR to meet assembly-competent TERT. Based on the cell cycle regulation of human telomerase subunit synthesis and subunit exchange in assembled RNPs, we have suggested that active RNP assembly may occur with only newly synthesized TERT and/or hTR subunits prior to their steady-state distribution (<a href=\"#bib42\">Vogan and Collins, 2015</a>). Newly synthesized subunits could meet in Cajal bodies, as pre-mature hTR transits to acquire 5' cap trimethylation, or in nucleoli. Additional non-exclusive possibilities for cellular role(s) of hTR H/ACA RNP assembly in active RNP biogenesis include hTR folding, which would parallel the precedent from ciliate telomerase biogenesis (<a href=\"#bib37\">Stone et al., 2007</a>), and/or exclusion of non-productive hTR-protein interactions."

As one model to account for these results, TCAB1 could influence the subnuclear distribution of active RNP between nucleoli and nucleoplasm (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>, right). This change in distribution would have different influence on the amount of new telomeric repeat synthesis depending on telomerase expression level and other variables across human cell types. Of note, we have not ruled out an influence of TCAB1 related to its proposed function in DNA damage repair (<a href=\"#bib19\">Henriksson and Farnebo, 2015</a>). However, in studies here it is striking that TCAB1 KO affected telomere length only in cells with hTR telomerase, not in cells with hTRmin telomerase. Therefore, TCAB1 functions directly related to active telomerase assembly and trafficking are more logical hypotheses."

Coilin KO clonal cell lines generated in this work had telomere lengths similar to the parental cell lines. Because Coilin KO cells with endogenous telomerase levels have apparently unperturbed telomere length homeostasis, we suggest that they will be useful for visually tracking telomerase interactions with telomeres without the complication of Cajal body clustering of active with inactive hTR. Curiously, Coilin KO HCT116 cells had dampened telomere elongation upon an increase in telomerase expression. This could reflect less synergistic telomerase RNP loading on telomeres. Alternately, Cajal bodies could coordinate telomerase with other factors important for telomere synthesis, or they could safeguard telomere integrity. Our results support a paradigm of nuclear bodies as zones that draw factors together to fine-tune the likelihood of their physical association or functional cooperation rather than their interaction or reaction specificity."

For example, opposite the impact of TCAB1 and Coilin KOs on telomere lengths described above, previous studies found that endogenous hTR colocalization with telomeres was reduced more by Coilin depletion than TCAB1 depletion and overexpressed hTR colocalization with telomeres was reduced more by TCAB1 depletion than by Coilin depletion (<a href=\"#bib50\">Zhong et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Stern et al., 2012</a>).

Recognizing that over evolution, telomerase RNAs in different species have acquired different 3' ends, the author test whether the box H/ACA 3' region of hTR is needed for telomerase to function at telomeres. They demonstrate that the H/ACA-interacting regions of hTR are dispensable if modifications are made to stabilize the RNA. The authors use the cleaver trick of putting an alternative stable 3' end from the MALAT1 triplex structure on the 3' end of hTR and find that when expression levels are sufficiently high, this minimal hTR functions to elongate telomeres in transformed human cells and hES cells. They go on to test the importance of TCAB1 and Coilin in telomere length maintenance and show they are not required for telomere elongation in vivo. This paper is important because it establishes that the minimal region for the human telomerase RNA does not require the 3' region or several accessory proteins. The work expands our understanding of the roles of TCAB1 and Coilin, which have been the subject of some controversy."
