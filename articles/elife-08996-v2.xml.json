Here, we report a novel Hif-3\u03b1 variant, Hif-3\u03b12, in zebrafish. Hif-3\u03b12 lacks the bHLH, PAS, PAC, and ODD domains, and is expressed in embryonic and adult tissues independently of oxygen availability. Hif-3\u03b12 is a nuclear protein with significant hypoxia response element (HRE)-dependent transcriptional activity. Hif-3\u03b12 overexpression not only decreases embryonic growth and developmental timing but also causes left-right asymmetry defects. Genetic deletion of Hif-3\u03b12 by CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing increases, while Hif-3\u03b12 overexpression decreases, Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling. This action is independent of its HRE-dependent transcriptional activity. Mechanistically, Hif-3\u03b12 binds to \u03b2-catenin and destabilizes the nuclear \u03b2-catenin complex. This mechanism is distinct from GSK3\u03b2-mediated \u03b2-catenin degradation and is conserved in humans. These findings provide new insights into the oxygen-independent actions of HIFs and uncover a novel mechanism regulating Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling."

These proteins switch on genes that help cells and tissues adapt to the shortage in oxygen, for example, by stimulating the production of red blood cells. Each HIF is made up of two subunits called \u03b1 and \u03b2 that only bind to each other when the oxygen levels drop. This two-subunit complex, or 'dimer', then activates a set of genes by binding to a stretch of DNA known as the hypoxia response element. HIFs also play important roles in many different stages of animal development. There are many different HIF proteins that are each present at different developmental stages; this has made them difficult to study."

The experiments show that this \u03b1 subunit is not regulated by oxygen, but may still be able to activate genes that have the hypoxia response element. When Hif-3\u03b12 was injected into zebrafish embryos, the body pattern that is normally set up in embryogenesis was disrupted. Further experiments revealed that Hif-3\u03b12 regulates embryo development by destabilizing a protein called \u03b2-catenin. This inhibits a cell communication system called Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling. Zhang et al. also show that the two distinct activities of Hif-3\u03b12 \u2013 binding to the hypoxia response element and destabilizing \u03b2-catenin \u2013 involve two different regions of the protein."

HIFs are heterodimers, consisting of an oxygen-regulated \u03b1 subunit and a stable \u03b2 subunit. All three HIF\u03b1 proteins contain a bHLH (basic helix-loop-helix) domain, two PAS (Per-Arnt-Sim) domains, a PAC (PAS associated C-terminal) domain, and an ODD (oxygen-dependent degradation) domain. HIF-1\u03b1 and HIF-2\u03b1 have two TADs (transactivation domains) (<a href=\"#bib54\">Pugh et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Tian et al., 1997</a>). HIF-3\u03b1 has only one TAD but it has a unique LZIP (leucine zipper) domain in the C-terminal region (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gu et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Hara et al., 2001</a>). Under normal oxygen tension, HIF\u03b1 proteins are hydroxylated at conserved proline residues in their ODD domains by PHDs (prolyl hydroxlase domain proteins). The prolyl hydroxylated HIF\u03b1 proteins are recognized by the pVHL (von Hippel-Lindau protein). pVHL polyubiqutinates HIF\u03b1 proteins and targets them to the proteasome for degradation (<a href=\"#bib24\">Huang et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Kageyama et al., 2004</a>). Under hypoxia, prolyl hydroxylation is decreased and HIF\u03b1 proteins are stabilized. They then dimerize with HIF\u03b2, translocate into the nucleus, bind to the hypoxia response elements (HREs) in the promoter regions of their target genes, and up-regulate their expression (<a href=\"#bib61\">Semenza, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Simon and Keith, 2008</a>). These HIF target genes participate in many adaptive and pathological processes such as erythropoiesis, angiogenesis, metabolic reprograming, cell-cycle regulation, and tumorigenesis (<a href=\"#bib61\">Semenza, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Simon and Keith, 2008</a>). In addition to their well-known functions in coordinating the transcriptional responses to hypoxia, HIFs have been shown to have oxygen-independent roles in early development in mammals, frogs, fish, and invertebrates (<a href=\"#bib3\">Barriga et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Dunwoodie, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Simon and Keith, 2008</a>). The mechanisms underlying these oxygen-independent roles of HIFs, however, are not well understood."

The human <i>HIF-3\u03b1</i> gene, for example, has 19 predicted variants that result from the use of different promoters, different transcription initiation sites, and alternative splicing (<a href=\"#bib11\">Duan, 2015</a>). Eight of them have been experimentally shown to encode proteins (<a href=\"#bib21\">Heikkila et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Maynard et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Pasanen et al., 2010</a>). The mouse <i>Hif-3\u03b1</i> locus also gives rise to several different variants, resulting in the full-length HIF-3\u03b1, NEPAS (neonatal and embryonic PAS), IPAS (inhibitory PAS) and possibly others (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gu et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Makino et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Yamashita et al., 2008</a>). These isoforms are often expressed in different tissues, at different developmental stages, and are differentially regulated. They have distinct or even opposite functions when tested by overexpression approaches (<a href=\"#bib11\">Duan, 2015</a>). For instance, while human HIF-3\u03b11, the full-length human HIF-3\u03b1, can stimulate HRE-dependent reporter construct activity and up-regulate unique target genes (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gu et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Zhang et al., 2014</a>), human HIF-3\u03b14 isoform, a shorter isoform that lacks the TAD domain, inhibits the activity of HIF-1\u03b1 and HIF-2\u03b1 (<a href=\"#bib44\">Maynard et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Maynard et al., 2007</a>). Similarly, IPAS was shown to inhibit HIF-1\u03b1 activity (<a href=\"#bib41\">Makino et al., 2001</a>), while NEPAS has weak transcriptional activity and is thought to inhibit HIF-1/2\u03b1 activity by competing for the common HIF\u03b2 in cells with limited amounts of HIF\u03b2 (<a href=\"#bib70\">Yamashita et al., 2008</a>). The existence of such a large array of HIF-3\u03b1 variants has posed enormous challenges to studying HIF-3 biology. While the conventional gene knockout technology has been used to knockout the NEPAS/HIF-3\u03b1/IPAS in mice (<a href=\"#bib70\">Yamashita et al., 2008</a>), the interpretation of the results is not straightforward because multiple isoforms are deleted. The new CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technology makes it possible to address this problem."

The Wnt signaling pathway also regulates stem cell renewal and adult tissue homeostasis. Aberrant expression and/or activation in Wnt signaling leads to many human diseases such as birth defects, cancer, and degenerative disorders (<a href=\"#bib10\">Clevers and Nusse, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">MacDonald et al., 2009</a>). In the absence of Wnt ligands, the transcriptional co-activator \u03b2-catenin is phosphorylated in the cytoplasm by a protein complex consisting of APC, CK1, Axin, and GSK3\u03b2. This leads to \u03b2-catenin recognition by the ubiquitin ligase \u03b2-TrCP. \u03b2-TrCP binds to the N-terminal region of \u03b2-catenin in a phosphorylation-dependent manner and promotes \u03b2-catenin degradation. The binding of a Wnt ligand to Frizzled and co-receptors inhibits the phosphorylation and degradation of \u03b2-catenin. The stabilized \u03b2-catenin accumulates and translocates into the nucleus to form complexes with TCF/LEF, and thereby activates target gene expression (<a href=\"#bib10\">Clevers and Nusse, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">MacDonald et al., 2009</a>). In addition to the canonical pathway, Wnt also regulates planar cell polarity and Akt/mTOR through non-canonical pathways (<a href=\"#bib10\">Clevers and Nusse, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">MacDonald et al., 2009</a>)"

In this study, we have identified a novel zebrafish Hif-3\u03b1 spliced variant, termed Hif-3\u03b1 isoform 2 (Hif-3\u03b12). Hif-3\u03b12 is an oxygen-insensitive nuclear protein. Despite its lack of the bHLH and PAS domains, Hif-3\u03b12 has HRE-dependent transcriptional activity. We investigated the in vivo role of Hif-3\u03b12 using transgenesis and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing. Our results suggest that Hif-3\u03b12 inhibits canonical Wnt signaling by binding to \u03b2-catenin and destabilizing the nuclear \u03b2-catenin complex. This action is independent of its HRE-dependent transcriptional activity and is evolutionarily conserved."

                                "text": "The discovery of Hif-3\u03b12 has raised the possibility that it may play a role in early development in an O<sub>2</sub>-independent manner. Overexpression of Hif-3\u03b12 resulted in reduced body growth and developmental timing in zebrafish embryos (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplemental 1A\u2013B</a>). This effect is similar to what has been reported for the full-length Hif-3\u03b11 (<a href=\"#bib73\">Zhang et al., 2014</a>). This action of Hif-3\u03b12 appears to require its transcriptional activity because overexpression of the \u0394TAD mutant did not change body size or somite number, while the \u0394LZIP mutant did (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplemental 1A\u2013B</a>). While GFP mRNA-injected or \u0394TAD mRNA-injected embryos were mostly morphologically normal, many Hif-3\u03b12- and \u0394LZIP-expressing embryos exhibited morphological abnormality, (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplemental 1C\u2013D</a>). Approximately 84% of the Hif-3\u03b12 mRNA-injected embryos had partial or complete loss of <i>myod1</i>-mRNA expressing somites on one or both sides of the body (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Similar results were found with <i>myog</i> mRNA expression (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). The expression patterns of two asymmetric genes, <i>spaw</i> and <i>lefty2</i> (<i>lft2</i>) (<a href=\"#bib1\">Amack et al., 2007</a>), were examined. While the <i>spaw</i> expression was detected on the left side of the body plan in all GFP mRNA-injected embryos, its expression was detected on the right side, bilaterally, or was completely lost in ~58% of the Hif-3\u03b12-expressing embryos (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Similar changes were found with <i>lft2</i> expression (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). During zebrafish development, the shape of the heart changes from a tube-like structure in the middle to a left looped structure (<a href=\"#bib64\">Stainier, 2001</a>). The cardiac tube remained in the middle or even looped to the right side in half of the Hif-3\u03b12 expressing embryos (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). No such phenotype was observed in Hif-3\u03b11 mRNA-injected embryos (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). The effect of Hif-3\u03b12 expression was further examined using LiPan fish, a transgenic zebrafish line that has liver-specific expression of DsRed RFP and pancreas-specific expression of GFP (<a href=\"#bib33\">Korzh et al., 2008</a>). In the control embryos, the liver was located on the left and pancreas on the right side of the body plan in all embryos (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>). In the Hif-3\u03b12 group, the liver was found on the right side or in the midline in many embryos (28.5%) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>). These data suggest that overexpression of Hif-3\u03b12 but not the full-length Hif-3\u03b11 impairs LR axis development."

KV is derived from the dorsal forerunner cells (DFCs). DFCs emerge at mid-gastrulation and migrate collectively to the vegetal pole. At the tail bud, they form a rosette structure. The lumen and cilia are then developed to form KV (<a href=\"#bib42\">Matsui and Bessho, 2012</a>).

                                "text": "Several signaling pathways, including Wnt/\u03b2-catenin, Fgf, Notch, Hedgehog, and Akt, have been implicated in KV organogenesis (<a href=\"#bib25\">Husken and Carl, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Matsui and Bessho, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Roussigne et al., 2012</a>). qRT-PCR assays showed that Hif-3\u03b12 overexpression resulted in a significant reduction in the mRNA expression of <i>vent</i> and <i>vox</i> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E, F</a>), two genes acting downstream of the canonical Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway. No significant changes were detected in the mRNA expression of the Fgf target gene <i>dusp6</i>, the Hedgehog target gene <i>gli1</i>, or the Notch target gene <i>her4</i> (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplemental 1A\u2013C</a>). No marked changes were observed in the phospho-Akt and phospho-Erk levels (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplemental 1D\u2013E</a>). Topflash, a Luciferase reporter construct containing TCF binding sites was used to directly test whether Hif-3\u03b12 inhibits Wnt/\u03b2<i>-catenin signaling</i> (<a href=\"#bib16\">Flowers et al., 2012</a>). Injection of Wnt3a mRNA into zebrafish embryos resulted in a robust induction in Topflash reporter activity (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>). This induction was abolished by Hif-3\u03b12 co-injection (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>). Co-injection of Hif-3\u03b12 also abolished the induction of Topflash activity by \u03b2-catenin\u0394N (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H</a>). \u03b2-catenin\u0394N is a constitutively active \u03b2-catenin mutant lacking part of the N-terminal sequence (<a href=\"#bib67\">Xiong et al., 2006</a>). This action is specific to Hif-3\u03b12 because the full-length Hif-3\u03b11 did not inhibit Wnt3a- or \u03b2-catenin\u0394N-induced Topflash activity (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplemental 2A\u2013B</a>). Hif-1\u03b1 had a modest but statistically significant effect on Wnt3a-induced Topflash activity (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplemental 2A\u2013B</a>). Co-injection of Hif-3\u03b12 also abolished the Wnt3a- and \u03b2-catenin\u0394N-induced dorsalization phenotype (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplemental 2C</a>). Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling has been shown to regulate KV development and LR asymmetry by stimulating the expression of the ciliogenic transcription factor <i>foxj1a</i> (<a href=\"#bib5\">Caron et al., 2012</a>) and the calcium channel <i>cav1.2</i> (<a href=\"#bib49\">Muntean et al., 2014</a>). If Hif-3\u03b12 impairs KV development via inhibition of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling, then expression of Hif-3\u03b12 should block Wnt/\u03b2-catenin-induced <i>foxj1a</i> and <i>cav1.2</i> gene expression. Indeed, co-injection of Hif-3\u03b12 mRNA abolished the \u03b2-catenin\u0394N induction of <i>foxj1a</i> and <i>cav1.2</i> gene expression (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4I\u2013J</a>). These results suggest that forced expression of Hif-3\u03b12 but not the full-length Hif-3\u03b11 inhibits Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling and impairs Kupffer's vesicle development."

                                "text": "The lack of major phenotypes in body patterning was surprising. Excessive Wnt/\u03b2-catenin activity has been linked to major phenotypic changes in zebrafish. For example, the <i>masterblind (mbl)</i> mutant fish had no eyes, reduced telencephalon, and expanded diencephalon (<a href=\"#bib22\">Heisenberg et al., 2001</a>). Likewise, treatment of zebrafish embryos with Lithium and BIO, which increase \u03b2-catenin signaling by inhibiting GSK3\u03b2, results in the absence of eyes or reduced eyes (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kim et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Nishiya et al., 2014</a>). A recent study has shown that zebrafish can activate compensation mechanisms to buffer against deleterious genetic mutations (<a href=\"#bib57\">Rossi et al., 2015</a>). For instance, while knockdown of egfl7 resulted in major phenotypic changes, no phenotype was found in the <i>egfl7</i>-/- genetic mutants (<a href=\"#bib57\">Rossi et al., 2015</a>). To test this possibility, we designed a morpholino (MO) targeting the Hif-3\u03b12 ATG site. Injection of the Hif-3\u03b12 MO but not the control MO reduced the Hif-3\u03b12 protein levels (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7A<i>\u2014</i>figure supplement 1A</a>). Injection of Hif-3\u03b12 MO did not change the levels of Hif-3\u03b11 mRNA (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7<i>\u2014</i>figure supplement 1B</a>). Because the full-length Hif-3\u03b11 protein is rapidly degraded under normoxia (<a href=\"#bib72\">Zhang et al., 2012</a>), it could not be detected nor affected by the Hif-3\u03b12 MO. Topflash reporter assay and qRT-PCR measurement showed that knockdown of Hif-3\u03b12 significantly increased Wnt/\u03b2-catenin activity at 9 hpf (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B\u2013D</a>). Therefore, the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin activity is elevated in the morphants. Many of the morphants had phenotypes resembling those of <i>mbl</i> mutant embryos (<a href=\"#bib22\">Heisenberg et al., 2001</a>), including the absent or reduced eyes and reduced forebrain (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>). These phenotypes were unlikely caused by MO toxicity because the Hif-3\u03b12 targeting MO did not increase embryo mortality nor did it increase p53 mRNA expression at the injected dose (3 ng) (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7<i>\u2014</i>figure supplement 1C</a>). Furthermore, the <i>hif-3\u03b1</i>\u039442 embryos were significantly less sensitive to the Hif-3\u03b12 MO (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>). qRT-PCR results showed that the expression of <i>boz</i>, a maternal Wnt signaling target gene (<a href=\"#bib35\">Leung et al., 2003</a>), increased at 6 hpf but returned to the control levels at 9 and 24 hpf in the <i>hif-3\u03b1</i>\u039442 mutants (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). No change was detected in <i>boz</i> expression in the morphants at any of these stages (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a>). The <i>vent</i> and <i>vox</i> mRNA levels increased significantly at 6 and 9 hpf but these increases disappeared at 24 hpf in the <i>hif-3\u03b1</i>\u039442 mutant embryos (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B\u2013C</a>). In contrast, knockdown of Hif-3\u03b12 resulted in elevated <i>vent</i> and <i>vox</i> mRNA expression at 6, 9, as well as 24 hpf (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E\u2013F</a>). A reciprocal decrease was observed with <i>tp63</i> expression; <i>tp63</i> is a direct transcriptional target of Bmp signaling in zebrafish (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bakkers et al., 2002</a>) (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8G\u2013H</a>). These results support the notion that the <i>hif-3\u03b1</i>\u039442 mutant embryos have activated certain compensatory mechanisms. Next, <i>w</i>e subjected the <i>hif-3\u03b1</i>\u039442 mutant embryos to Lithium and BIO. We reasoned that the <i>hif-3\u03b1</i>\u039442 mutant embryos should be more sensitive to these Wnt activating agents even if they can survive by activating as-yet-unidentified compensatory mechanisms. Indeed, when treated with Lithium and BIO, a significantly greater portion of the <i>hif-3\u03b1</i>\u039442 embryos exhibited the no eye or small eye phenotype compared to the wild type controls (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8I\u2013J</a>)."

Co-expression of Hif-3\u03b12-GFP decreased the levels of both \u03b2-catenin and Lef1 in the complex (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>). Likewise, overexpression of Hif-3\u03b12-GFP also reduced the \u03b2-catenin and Tcf4 levels in the IP complex (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C</a>). Analysis of the Western blotting results of the cell lysates showed that the levels of total \u03b2-catenin, Lef1, and Tcf4 were all decreased by Hif-3\u03b12 in a dose-dependent manner (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B\u2013C</a>). Overexpression of Hif-3\u03b12 had no effect on the levels of Tcf3 levels and Hif-3\u03b12-GST failed to pull down Tcf3 (<a href=\"#fig9s3\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 3A\u2013B</a>). We postulated that Hif-3\u03b12 inhibits \u03b2-catenin by destabilizing \u03b2-catenin and its nuclear co-activators. To test this idea, the proteasome inhibitor MG132 was added. While Hif-3\u03b12 expression resulted in a marked reduction in \u03b2-catenin levels, this reduction was blocked by MG132 treatment (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9D</a>). Likewise, MG132 treatment also partially inhibited the Hif-3\u03b12-induced reduction in Lef1 levels (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9E</a>). MG132 treatment increased Hif-3\u03b12 levels (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9D\u2013E</a>). Next, HEK293T cells co-transfected with \u03b2-catenin and Hif-3\u03b12-GFP were fractionated into nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions and analyzed. The expression of Hif-3\u03b12 greatly reduced the levels of nuclear \u03b2-catenin, while it had a minimal effect on the levels of cytoplasmic \u03b2-catenin (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9F</a>). Addition of BIO and Lithium, two chemical inhibitors of GSK\u03b2, did not affect the Hif-3\u03b12-induced \u03b2-catenin degradation (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9G</a>). Taken together, these data indicate that Hif-3\u03b12 binds to \u03b2-catenin and destabilizes the active \u03b2-catenin complex through a mechanism that is independent of GSK\u03b2/\u03b2-TrCP-mediated degradation."

It is rapidly degraded under normoxia. Under hypoxia, Hif-3\u03b11 is stabilized and regulates the expression of many target genes, which in turn slow down growth and developmental timing (<a href=\"#bib73\">Zhang et al., 2014</a>).

To date, a number of HIF-3\u03b1 protein-coding variants have been reported, including: a) the full-length protein; b) a HIF-3\u03b1 variant similar to the full-length protein; c) HIF-3\u03b1 variants lacking the LZIP domain; d) HIF-3\u03b1 variants lacking both bHLH and LZIP domains; e) Short HIF-3\u03b1 variants lacking the C-terminal half region; f) Truncated HIF-3\u03b1 variants lacking the bHLH, ODD/N-TAD, and LZIP domains; and g) HIF-3\u03b1 variants lacking the bHLH domain (<a href=\"#bib11\">Duan, 2015</a>). Zebrafish Hif-3\u03b12 has a structure distinct from those reported previously. Hif-3\u03b12 lacks the entire N-terminal region and only contains the N-TAD and LZIP domains. Hif-3\u03b12 is expressed in all embryonic stages and in many adult tissues examined. Although the Hif-3\u03b12 mRNA levels were lower compared to those of the full-length Hif-3\u03b11, the Hif-3\u03b12 protein was abundantly expressed in embryonic and adult tissues under both normoxia and hypoxia. Functional analysis results show that Hif-3\u03b12 has significant HRE-dependent transcriptional activity. This activity depends on its TAD. Although Hif-3\u03b12 has the ability to induce HRE-dependent gene expression, its action is not identical to that of the full-length Hif-3\u03b11. The transcriptional activity of Hif-3\u03b12 is weaker compared to that of Hif-3\u03b11. Among the five Hif-31\u03b1 target genes examined, Hif-3\u03b12 increases the expression of <i>igfbp-1a, mlp3c</i> and <i>redd1</i> but not that of <i>zp3v2</i> and <i>sqrdl</i>."

This is similar to what has been reported for Hif-3\u03b11 (<a href=\"#bib73\">Zhang et al., 2014</a>). This action apparently requires the transcriptional activity because it was abolished by deletion the TAD but not LZIP domain. Another phenotype is the defective LR asymmetry. Forced expression of Hif-3\u03b12 altered the expression of several asymmetry genes and resulted in the randomization of laterality of the heart, liver, and pancreas. This action is unique to Hif-3\u03b12 because no such phenotype was observed in the Hif-3\u03b11 expressing embryos. Importantly, the A36G mutant, which had no HRE-dependent transcriptional activity, caused a similar heart randomization, suggesting that this action does not required its HRE transcriptional activity. The LR axis development in zebrafish is divided into several phases, beginning from the symmetry breaking, and continuing with DFC appearance and clustering, KV organogenesis, lateral plate mesoderm asymmetry, and left- or right-specific organ formation (<a href=\"#bib4\">Carl et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Matsui and Bessho, 2012</a>). Our results suggest that forced expression of Hif-3\u03b12 impairs LR axis development at the step of KV organogenesis/function. This conclusion is supported by the findings that Hif-3\u03b12 overexpression altered KV morphology and <i>spaw</i> expression, while it did not affect DFC appearance or DFC clustering."

                        "text": "We provided several lines of evidence suggesting that Hif-3\u03b12 impairs KV development by inhibiting the canonical Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway. These include: i) Hif-3\u03b12 overexpression decreases Wnt target gene expression while it had no effect on Fgf-, Hedgehog-, and Notch target genes; ii) Co-expression of Hif-3\u03b12 inhibits Wnt3 and \u03b2-catenin-induced gene expression and dorsalization; iii) genetic deletion of Hif-3\u03b12 (without affecting Hif-3\u03b11 expression and function) increases Topflash reporter activity and Wnt target gene expression; iv) MO-based knockdown had similar effects in elevating Wnt signaling. These data strongly suggest that Hif-3\u03b12 is a negative regulator of canonical Wnt signaling. Wnt signaling plays multiple roles in vertebrate axis specification (see <a href=\"#bib23\">Hikasa and Sokol, 2013</a>). While the maternal Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling contributes to the dorsoventral axis establishment in early embryogenesis, the zygotic Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling is involved in anteroposterior axis specification. It has been suggested that these two different roles are mediated by two distinct sets of target genes (<a href=\"#bib23\">Hikasa and Sokol, 2013</a>). As discussed earlier, canonical Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling also plays an important role in KV development and the establishment of the LR axis in zebrafish. Our results showed that overexpression of Hif-3\u03b12 acts at the step of KV development. This may be related to the fact that it takes several hours for the injected mRNA to be translated into protein, and for resulting biological activities to manifest. Since Hif-3\u03b12 mRNA is maternally deposited, the endogenous Hif-3\u03b12 may act earlier. Indeed, we observed a significant increase in maternal Wnt signaling and elevated mortality in early stages in the mutant embryos. Although deletion of Hif-3\u03b12 by either genetic mutations or gene knockdown results in elevated Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling, the two approaches gave rise to very different phenotypes. The F3 <i>hif-3\u03b1</i>\u039442 mutant embryos had significantly elevated mortality in early stages. This increase in embryo mortality was also observed in F3 <i>hif-3\u03b1</i>\u039420 mutant embryos. In contrast, no mortality increase was detected in the morphants. In both genetic alleles, the vast majority of the surviving embryos looked morphologically normal. The morphants, however, displayed phenotypes characteristic of excessive Wnt signaling. There are several possible explanations for the different phenotype. It is conceivable that the lack of a body patterning phenotype in the surviving mutant embryos may be due to activation of compensatory mechanisms. Such compensation mechanisms have been demonstrated recently in zebrafish and accounted for the different phenotypes found in the <i>egfl7-/-</i> genetic mutants and Egfl7 morphants (<a href=\"#bib57\">Rossi et al., 2015</a>). In support of this view, the <i>hif-3\u03b1</i>\u039442 mutant embryos displayed a transient and dynamic activation of Wnt signaling, while a sustained elevation in Wnt signaling was observed in the morphants. A concomitant reduction in BMP signaling was observed in the <i>hif-3\u03b1</i>\u039442 embryos but not in the morphants. Furthermore, the <i>hif-3\u03b1</i>\u039442 mutant embryos were more sensitive to the Wnt activating agents Lithium and BIO. Another possible explanation is the differential effects of genetic mutations and MO knockdown on the maternal Wnt signaling. The maternal Wnt signaling is significantly elevated in the F3 <i>hif-3\u03b1</i>\u039442 mutant embryos, as indicated by the increased boz expression, while no such increase was observed in the morphants. It is also possible that Hif-3\u03b12 may have other activities in vivo. In fact, our results show that Hif-3\u03b12 can regulate gene expression via its TAD domain. We cannot exclude the possibility Hif-3\u03b12 may affect other pathways directly or indirectly."

                        "text": "A biochemical and functional interaction between an HIF-3\u03b1 isoform and Wnt signaling has not been reported before. However, HIF-1\u03b1 has been shown to both inhibit and activate Wnt signaling in mammals. Kaidi et al. (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kaidi et al., 2007</a>) reported that hypoxia inhibits the \u03b2-catenin/TCF4 complex formation and activity, resulting in a G1 arrest in cultured colon cancer cells. These authors proposed that HIF-1\u03b1 acts by competing with TCF4 for \u03b2-catenin binding. Lim et al. (<a href=\"#bib36\">Lim et al., 2008</a>) reported that HIF-1\u03b1 inhibits Wnt signaling by binding to human arrest defective 1 (hARD1), which is responsible for \u03b2-catenin acetylation. Another mechanism was reported by <a href=\"#bib6\">Chen et al. (2013)</a>. They showed that HIF-1\u03b1 indirectly inhibits the Wnt signaling pathway by inducing the expression of a Wnt antagonist Sclerostin in MC3T3 osteoblastic cells. In a very recent paper, Majmundar et al. demonstrated that tissue-specific knockout of HIF-1\u03b1 in mice has little effect on embryonic and fetal myogenesis but increases adult muscle regeneration (<a href=\"#bib40\">Majmundar et al., 2015</a>). HIF-1\u03b1 acts by repressing canonical Wnt signaling in adult skeletal muscle. HIF-1\u03b1 has also been shown to activate Wnt signaling in mammals. Using \u03b2-Gal Wnt reporter and Hif-1a conditional knockout mouse lines, <a href=\"#bib47\">Mazumdar et al. (2010)</a>Mazumdar et al. (2010)\u00a0showed that HIF-1\u03b1 increases Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling activity in murine embryonic mesencephalon and adult hippocampal neuronal stem cells and precursor cells in vitro and in vivo. These authors further showed that HIF-1\u03b1 activates canonical Wnt signaling by increasing the expression levels of \u03b2-catenin and its downstream effectors LEF-1 and TCF-1. Subsequently, Jeong and Pack reported that HIF-1\u03b1 increases \u03b2-catenin expression level and action in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells (<a href=\"#bib26\">Jeong and Park, 2013</a>). Medley et al. reported that hypoxia activates Wnt signaling in undifferentiated iPS cells (<a href=\"#bib48\">Medley et al., 2013</a>). As in the case of HIF-1\u03b1, HIF-2\u03b1 has been shown to inhibit or/and enhance Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling (<a href=\"#bib9\">Choi et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Santoyo-Ramos et al., 2014</a>). Another mechanism by which HIF-1\u03b1 and -2\u03b1 can active the Wnt signaling pathway was reported by Yuen et al. recently (<a href=\"#bib71\">Yuen et al., 2014</a>). They reported that HIF-1\u03b1 and -2\u03b1 directly bind to the promoters of the Wnt7a and 7b genes and induce their expression in murine oligodendrocytes. Our study is different from the above studies in that Hif-3\u03b12 is an oxygen-insensitive and constitutively expressed Hif-3\u03b1 isoform and therefore functions under both normoxia and hypoxia. Importantly, our biochemical analysis results revealed that Hif-3\u03b12 directly binds to \u03b2-catenin and promotes the degradation of the nuclear \u03b2-catenin complex. This action is specific, as shown by the fact that Hif-3\u03b12 overexpression had no effect on the level of Tcf3, a \u03b2-catenin suppressor. This mechanism is distinct from those reported for HIF-1\u03b1 and -2\u03b1."

                        "text": "In addition to the GSK3\u03b2/\u03b2-TrCP-mediated degradation mentioned earlier, \u03b2-catenin is also subject to negative regulation by pVHL. The \u03b2-catenin degradation induced by pVHL is dependent on the presence of Jade-1, an E3 ubiquitin ligase (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chitalia et al., 2008</a>). These two pathways are unlikely to be involved in the Hif-3\u03b12-induced degradation for several reasons. First, both \u03b2-TrCP and Jade-1 bind to the N-terminal region of \u03b2-catenin in a phosphorylation-dependent manner and predominantly degrade \u03b2-catenin in the cytosol. Our results showed that Hif-3\u03b12 inhibits the activity of \u03b2-catenin\u0394N, a constitutively active \u03b2-catenin mutant lacking the N-terminal sequence. Second, two GSK-3\u03b2 inhibitors, BIO and lithium, did not inhibit Hif-3\u03b12-induced \u03b2-catenin degradation. Finally, Hif-3\u03b12 not only reduces the levels of \u03b2-catenin but also decreases the levels of Tcf-4 and Lef1. GST-Hif-3\u03b12 did not directly interact with Tcf-4 and Lef1. Therefore, Hif-3\u03b12 probably binds to \u03b2-catenin, which in turn interacts with Tcf-4 and Lef1. It is unclear whether other factors may be involved in the physical association between Hif-3\u03b12 and \u03b2-catenin and whether post-translational modification of Hif-3\u03b12 and/or \u03b2-catenin is involved its their binding. \u03b2-catenin can shuttle in and out of the nucleus (<a href=\"#bib34\">Krieghoff et al., 2006</a>). The results of our cell fractionation experiment showed that Hif-3\u03b12 expression resulted in a marked decrease in the nuclear \u03b2-catenin levels without notable changes in the cytosolic \u03b2-catenin levels. In general, the fate of active \u03b2-catenin in the nucleus is not well understood. A recent study reported that the RING finger E3 ubiquitin ligase c-Cbl preferentially targets the active nuclear \u03b2-catenin for degradation by binding to the ARM domains of \u03b2-catenin (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chitalia et al., 2013</a>). Wnt activation promotes c-Cbl phosphorylation at Y371, and the phosphorylated c-Cbl dimerizes, translocates into the nucleus and promotes nuclear active \u03b2-catenin degradation during the Wnt-on phase (<a href=\"#bib62\">Shivanna et al., 2015</a>). TRIM33, another E3 ubiquitin ligase, has been reported to interact with and ubiquitylate nuclear \u03b2-catenin, and promote nuclear \u03b2-catenin degradation in a GSK-3\u03b2 and \u03b2-TrCP-independent manner (<a href=\"#bib69\">Xue et al., 2015</a>). It is unknown where c-Cbl and/or TRIM33 mediated the degradation of the \u03b2-catenin/Tfc4/Left1 complex. Future studies will be needed to determine the molecular mechanism(s) responsible for the Hif-3\u03b12-induced \u03b2-catenin complex destabilization."

                        "text": "Another intriguing and potentially important finding made in this study is that Hif-3\u03b12 has HRE-dependent transcriptional activity. The current dogma is that HIFs act as \u03b1/\u03b2 heterodimers (<a href=\"#bib61\">Semenza, 2012</a>). The bHLH domain in HIF\u03b1 is known to be involved in DNA binding, and the PAS-A and PAS-B domains are proposed to be involved in dimerization with HIF-\u03b2 and target gene specificity (<a href=\"#bib13\">Erbel et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Simon and Keith, 2008</a>). Although Hif-3\u03b12 has a TAD, it lacks the bHLH and PAS domains. While our findings suggest that Hif-3\u03b12 has transcriptional activity under normoxia, it is not clear whether this action requires HIF-\u03b2. <a href=\"#bib41\">Makino et al. (2001)</a> reported that mouse IPAS could not form dimers with HIF-\u03b2. Rather, it formed a complex with HIF-1\u03b1 but this complex did bind to an HRE. Using co-immunoprecipitation assays, <a href=\"#bib44\">Maynard et al. (2005)</a> showed that HIF-3\u03b14 interacted with HIF-1\u03b1 when transfected into HEK293 cells. HIF-3\u03b14 also formed a complex with HIF-\u03b2. The HIF-3\u03b14/HIF-\u03b2 complex did not appear to be capable of binding to an HRE, but it inhibited the binding of the HIF-1\u03b1/\u03b2 complex to the HRE in a dose-dependent fashion. A similar relationship between HIF-3\u03b14 and HIF-2\u03b1 was reported (<a href=\"#bib45\">Maynard et al., 2007</a>). The structure of mouse IPAS and human HIF-3\u03b14 is very different from zebrafish Hif-3\u03b12. Mouse IPAS and human HIF-3\u03b14 contain bHLH, PAS-A and -B, and PAC domains but lack the ODD/T-NAD and LIZP domains. In contract, zebrafish Hif-3\u03b12 contains N-TAD and LZIP only. The LZIP domain is only found in HIF-3\u03b1 among the 3 HIF\u03b1 isoforms (<a href=\"#bib11\">Duan, 2015</a>). LZIP is the dimerization domain of the ATF-6/CREB subfamily of bZIPs (a class of eukaryotic transcription factors) (<a href=\"#bib66\">Vinson et al., 1989</a>) and it facilitates dimerization and in some cases higher oligomerization of proteins (<a href=\"#bib37\">Lu et al., 1997</a>). LZIP containing regulatory proteins include c-Fos and c-Jun and the LZIP domains in Fos and Jun are necessary for the formation of the AP1 heterodimer (<a href=\"#bib55\">Ransone et al., 1989</a>). The LZIP domains in Fos and Jun have also been shown to bind to cAMP-responsive elements as a homodimer and can activate transcription from CRE-containing reporter genes (<a href=\"#bib37\">Lu et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Lu et al., 1998</a>). Our available data showed that the \u0394LZIP mutant had stronger transcriptional activity. Future studies are needed to elucidate whether Hif-3\u03b12 exerts its HRE-dependent activity independently of Hif \u03b2 and to determine the functional relationships between Hif-3\u03b12, Hif-3\u03b11, and other Hif\u03b1 proteins."

                        "text": "In summary, Hif-3\u03b12 represents a novel and O<sub>2</sub>-insensitive HIF/Hif-3\u03b1 variants. Hif-3\u03b12 has two distinct functions: activating HRE-dependent gene expression and binding to \u03b2-catenin and destabilizing the nuclear \u03b2-catenin complex. The corresponding region of human HIF-3\u03b1 possesses both activities, suggesting that both actions are evolutionarily conserved. In agreement with this notion, Wnt3a knockout mice exhibit randomized internal organ positioning across the midline (<a href=\"#bib50\">Nakaya et al., 2005</a>). The Hif-3\u03b1<sup>-/-</sup> mice had enlarged embryonic right atrium and right ventricle and this phenotype became more prominent in neonatal mice and continues until the adult stage (<a href=\"#bib70\">Yamashita et al., 2008</a>). In contrast, no enlargement was observed in the left ventricle in these mutant mice (<a href=\"#bib70\">Yamashita et al., 2008</a>). Our mutation analysis results suggested that different structural element(s) are responsible for these two distinct biological actions. Interestingly, the full-length Hif-3\u03b11, while exhibiting strong HRE-dependent transcriptional activity, does not inhibit \u03b2-catenin activity. It is possible that there are structural element(s) in the full-length Hif-3\u03b1 proteins that mask this important activity. In support of this view, we found that while the full-length human HIF-3\u03b19 has no \u03b2-catenin inhibitory activity, deletion of its N-terminal sequence can unmask this ability (<a href=\"#fig10s2\">Figure 10\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). An earlier study suggested that there are structural element(s) in the full-length human HIF-3\u03b1 inhibiting its ubiquitylation (<a href=\"#bib46\">Maynard et al., 2003</a>). Sequence analysis of human and fish HIF/Hif\u03b1s indicate that the residues critical for promoting \u03b2-catenin degradation are conserved in human and fish HIF/Hif\u03b1s. It is possible that all HIF\u03b1s may have the ability to interact with \u03b2-catenin. Future studies will determine whether this activity is conserved in the full-length HIF\u03b1s and reveal how they are regulated. This would explain the inconsistent and even opposite results regarding the interactions between HIF-1/2\u03b1 and Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling."

Hif-3\u03b12open reading frame (ORF) was amplified by PCR using F_ and R_full-length Hif-3\u03b12 primers, cloned into the pBluescript SK(-) vector, and sequenced. For functional analysis, Hif-3\u03b12ORF DNA was subcloned into pCS2-eGFP and pCS2-Flag vectors. To determine the Hif-3\u03b12domains and motifs important for its biological functions, several truncation and point mutants were engineered.

The DNA template for Hif-3\u03b12 gRNA (5\u2019- GCCCCGCTGAAGAGCTGCCCA-3\u2019) synthesis was generated by PCR using the pDR274 plasmid (Addgene) as template and primers shown in <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplemental file 1</a>. In vitro transcription was carried out using 200 ng template DNA and T7 RNA polymerase (Promega). Zebrafish codon-optimized Cas9 plasmid was linearized by XbaI digestion, and Cas9 capped mRNA was transcribed using a mMESSAGE mMACHINE T3 kit (Ambion). The size and quality of the capped mRNA and gRNA were confirmed by electrophoresis using a 2% (wt/vol) agarose gel. One-cell stage embryos were injected with 1 nl solution containing 200 ng/\u03bcl Cas9 mRNA and 20 ng/\u03bcl gRNA. The injected embryos were raised to adulthood. F0 fish were crossed to wild type fish to generate F1 progeny. F1 embryos were genotyped by T7E1 mutagenesis assay, NcoI digestion and DNA sequencing. Heterozygous F1 fish were crossed to generate F2 fish. The F2 fish were genotyped. The stable lines were maintained by inbred crossing. F3 homozygous embryos were used for phenotypic and molecular analysis."

A detailed analysis uncovers that \u03b2-catenin destabilisation by HIF-3a2 occurs independently of its hypoxia response element (HRE) dependent transcriptional activity. In the zebrafish, the authors find HIF-3\u03b12 expressed in all adult tissues analysed.

They also show varying morphological phenotypes with most embryos looking pretty unhealthy (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Their only marker analysis on embryos injected with mRNA of unknown concentration (200-800 pg as stated in the Experimental Procedures is very vague) show an early loss of somitic structures (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). The KV dependent establishment of brain and organ laterality during early embryonic development is a highly sensitive process and is influenced by numerous structures, processes and conditions ranging from cilia formation and motor protein function to gastrulation defects and even temperature (i.e. Basu and Brueckner, 2008; Bisgrove et al., 2005; Capdevilla et al., 2000; Dreosti et al., 2014; Nonaka et al., 1998; Supp et al., 1997; Wilkinson et al., 2009 and others). Given all the alterations observed by the authors, the specificity of the effect on gene expression in the Kupffer's vesicle and its connection to the concomitant rather mild effect on heart laterality needs a vigorous validation. Granted, the in vivo rescue experiments in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> regarding general early morphology look convincing, but canonical Wnt signaling has many important roles during early embryonic development. Therefore a minimum requirement to verify a potential specific effect would be to for instance manipulate gene expression specifically in the DFCs (gain and loss of function) or the KV as has been reported previously (e.g. Caron et al., 2012) and to perform a detailed analysis of KV morphology and function (for instance cilia morphology and functionality). Thereafter, the additional analysis of asymmetric organs other than the heart such as liver, pancreas and brain should be considered to validate the laterality defect."

Importantly, the difference in intron exon structure is not explained properly, \"it lacks portions of intron 1 and 11\", this is unclear as spliced RNA has no introns. The figure is too small to get any wiser. Therefore, the paper needs to state the difference between HIF3a1 and HIF3a2 more clearly and explicitly somewhere in the main text; where is the alternative start codon does it correspond to a codon in the a1 isoform? In addition it needs to explain as well that the mutant obtained does NOT affect HIF3a1 and why. A DNA alignment of the 2 variant transcripts with annotated start codon and the deleted sequence in the mutant allele would do all of this. As sequence deletions in the primary transcript might affect splicing of other splice variants a northern blot might be the best way to prove specificity of the mutant."

Research on the O2 labile HIF-\u03b1 subunits has been dominated by the relatively less complicated HIF1A and HIF2A genomic loci, which encode alternative mRNA species, but are not nearly as complex as human HIF3A which encodes &gt; 19 predicted mRNA variants, and at least 8 distinct polypeptides. As such, the HIF-3\u03b1 subfamily and its role in HIF biology should clearly be delineated for the sake of completeness. The manuscript reports on a novel Hif-3\u03b1 variant in zebrafish (\"Hif-3\u03b12\") and its possible role in regulating developmental left-right asymmetry. The authors wisely employ CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to complement their Hif-3\u03b1 overexpression studies, and conclude that Hif-3\u03b1 imposes its developmental activity via inhibition of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway. Here Hif-3\u03b12 (which lacks bHLH, PAS, and ODD domains) binds \u03b2-catenin and destabilizes nuclear \u03b2-catenin complexes. Surprisingly this effect is independent of the well-characterized GSK3B pathway and O2 availability, as Hif-3\u03b12 abundance is not regulated by O2 levels. The paper describes novel, O2-independent HIF functions, and suggests that Wnt/\u03b2-catenin can be regulated by previously uncharacterized mechanisms."

While I feel that these potentialities do not need further addressing in the current manuscript, hif-3\u03b1\u039442 mutants carry a mutation in both hif-3\u03b12 and hif-3\u03b11 and possibly other existing hif-3\u03b1 forms even if only hif-3\u03b12 function seems affected. Even if this may be semantic, sticking to the naming hif-3\u03b1\u039442 instead of hif-3\u03b12 mutant would be scientifically sound.)"

We showed that overexpression of Hif-3\u03b12 altered LR asymmetry, while the full-length Hif-3\u03b11 protein had no such activity. We examined DFC clustering and migration and found no significant change (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A-C</a>). Wnt signaling plays several distinct roles in vertebrate axis specification. While maternal Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling contributes to the dorsoventral axis establishment in early embryogenesis, the zygotic Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling is involved in anteroposterior axis specification. It has been suggested that these two roles are mediated by two distinct sets of target genes. Canonical Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling also regulates KV development and the establishment of the LR axis in zebrafish. Overexpression of Hif-3\u03b12 mainly impairs KV development and results in subsequent changes in organ laterality (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). This is probably because it takes some time for the injected mRNA to be translated into protein and for resulting biological changes to manifest. Since Hif-3\u03b12 mRNA is maternally deposited, the endogenous Hif-3\u03b12 may act earlier. Indeed, we observed a significant increase in maternal Wnt signaling and early mortality in the hif-3\u03b12-/- embryos (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a> and <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). Since the goal of our study is to determine the role of the oxygen-insensitive Hif-3\u03b12 in regulating Wnt signaling, we did not perform the suggested experiments to manipulate gene expression specifically in the DFCs or the KV. As mentioned earlier, we have modified the title of this manuscript to tone down the emphasis on LR asymmetry development. Another and more practical reason is that the first author of this work has moved on. Given that this manuscript already contains 6 years of work and 10 multi-panel figures plus 14 supplemental figures, we feel that this body of new and original data is sufficient to stand on its own.

Importantly, the difference in intron exon structure is not explained properly, \"it lacks portions of intron 1 and 11\", this is unclear as spliced RNA has no introns. The figure is too small to get any wiser. Therefore, the paper needs to state the difference between HIF3a1 and HIF3a2 more clearly and explicitly somewhere in the main text; where is the alternative start codon does it correspond to a codon in the a1 isoform? In addition it needs to explain as well that the mutant obtained does NOT affect HIF3a1 and why.

We also compared the genetic mutants with MO-knocked down embryos (please see responses to editor's comment#2 and Reviewer 2's comments). These data suggested that some compensatory mechanisms have been activated in the genetic mutant to buffer against deleterious genetic mutations of hif-3\u03b12-/-. However, it is also possible that Hif-3\u03b12 may have other activities in vivo. In fact, our results show that Hif-3\u03b12 can regulate gene expression via its TAD domain (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>) and this activity is required for its role in body growth (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We cannot exclude the possibility Hif-3\u03b12 may affect other pathways directly or indirectly. We have discussed these possibilities (paragraph three, Discussion)."

This notion is likely with respect to the experimental data presented, but there may still be not identified functional changes due to for instance protein folding or other consequences of the deletion. While I feel that these potentialities do not need further addressing in the current manuscript, hif-3\u03b1\u039442 mutants carry a mutation in both hif-3\u03b12 and hif-3\u03b11 and possibly other existing hif-3\u03b1 forms even if only hif-3\u03b12 function seems affected.
