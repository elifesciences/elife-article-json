A &gt;30-fold variation in hepatic TG accumulation was observed among the strains. Genome wide association studies revealed three loci associated with hepatic TG accumulation. Utilizing transcriptomic data from the liver and adipose tissue, we identified several high-confidence candidate genes for hepatic steatosis, including <i>Gde1</i>, a glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase not previously implicated in triglyceride metabolism. We confirmed the role of <i>Gde1</i> by <i>in vivo</i> hepatic over-expression and shRNA knockdown studies. We hypothesize that <i>Gde1</i> expression increases TG production by contributing to the production of glycerol-3-phosphate. Our multi-level data, including transcript levels, metabolite levels, and gut microbiota composition, provide a framework for understanding genetic and environmental interactions underlying hepatic steatosis."
