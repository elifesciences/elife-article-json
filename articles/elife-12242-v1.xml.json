Here we show that in vivo delivery of an engineered DNA-binding protein uncoupled from the repressor domain can produce efficient and gene-specific transcriptional silencing. To interfere with RHODOPSIN (<i>RHO</i>) gain-of-function mutations we engineered the ZF6-DNA-binding protein (ZF6-DB) that targets 20 base pairs (bp) of a <i>RHOcis</i>-regulatory element (CRE) and demonstrate <i>Rho</i> specific transcriptional silencing upon adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector-mediated expression in photoreceptors. The data show that the 20 bp-long genomic DNA sequence is necessary for <i>RHO</i> expression and that photoreceptor delivery of the corresponding cognate synthetic trans-acting factor ZF6-DB without the intrinsic transcriptional repression properties of the canonical ED blocks <i>Rho</i> expression with negligible genome-wide transcript perturbations. The data support DNA-binding-mediated silencing as a novel mode to treat gain-of-function mutations."

Here we show that in vivo delivery of an engineered DNA-binding protein uncoupled from the repressor domain can produce efficient and gene-specific transcriptional silencing. To interfere with RHODOPSIN (<i>RHO</i>) gain-of-function mutations we engineered the ZF6-DNA-binding protein (ZF6-DB) that targets 20 base pairs (bp) of a <i>RHOcis</i>-regulatory element (CRE) and demonstrate <i>Rho</i> specific transcriptional silencing upon adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector-mediated expression in photoreceptors. The data show that the 20 bp-long genomic DNA sequence is necessary for <i>RHO</i> expression and that photoreceptor delivery of the corresponding cognate synthetic trans-acting factor ZF6-DB without the intrinsic transcriptional repression properties of the canonical ED blocks <i>Rho</i> expression with negligible genome-wide transcript perturbations. The data support DNA-binding-mediated silencing as a novel mode to treat gain-of-function mutations."

However, in eukaryotes TF DNA binding and effector activities are typically structurally modular (<a href=\"#bib3\">Brent, 1985</a>) consisting of a DNA-binding domain (DBD) controlling the TF topology on genomic targets and an effector domain (ED) (<a href=\"#bib3\">Brent, 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Kadonaga, 2004</a>) that recruits co-activator or co-repressor complexes (<a href=\"#bib17\">Malik and Roeder, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Perissi et al., 2010</a>) resulting in either transcriptional activation or repression of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) (<a href=\"#bib22\">Neph et al., 2012</a>). Engineered TFs mimic the design of natural TFs (<a href=\"#bib24\">Pavletich and Pabo, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Beerli and Barbas, 2002</a>). To generate target specificity the DBD module is engineered to recognize unique genome sites (<a href=\"#bib2\">Beerli and Barbas, 2002</a>), whereas the transcriptional activation or repressor properties are conferred by the selection of the ED (<a href=\"#bib10\">Konermann et al., 2013</a>). To silence gain-of-function mutations, while studying the features of genomic DNA-TF interactions, here we investigated the hypothesis that engineered DNA-binding proteins without canonical ED activity possess transcriptional repression properties. As a transcriptional repression target we selected the G-protein-coupled Receptor Rhodopsin (RHO) gene whose gain-of-function mutations are those most commonly associated with autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (adRP), an incurable form of blindness (<a href=\"#bib6\">Dryja et al., 1990</a>)."

The deletion of the ED resulted in a protein, ZF6-DB targeting 20 base pairs of genomic CRE, here named ZF6-cis, found at -84 bp to -65 bp from the transcription start site (TSS) of the human RHO gene (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1a</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Mitton et al., 2000</a>). Genomic ZF6-cis is without apparent photoreceptor-specific endogenous transcription factor-binding sites (TFBS; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1a</a>), as reported (<a href=\"#bib11\">Kwasnieski et al., 2012</a>). To study the CRE features of ZF6-cis that ZF6-DB would interfere with upon binding in the absence of KRAB-mediated co-repressor recruitment, we deleted the 20 bp genomic ZF6-cis sequence and assessed its function by eGFP reporter assay (<a href=\"#bib11\">Kwasnieski et al., 2012</a>) in living porcine retina by AAV delivery. The 776 bp-long <i>RHO</i> promoter fragment carrying the ZF6-cis deletion upstream of the eGFP reporter gene (AAV-RHO-cis-del-EGFP), after delivery to the porcine retinal photoreceptor, showed loss of eGFP expression compared to the control vector (AAV-RHO-EGFP) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b,c</a>). This suggests that ZF6-cis CRE is necessary for <i>RHO</i> expression (at least for the 776 bp region used in the assay) and that binding of the synthetic ZF6-DB trans-acting counterpart of ZF6-cis, may indeed repress <i>RHO</i> transcription."

To evaluate whether ZF6-DB represses transcription of the <i>RHO</i> gene in a physiological genomic context, we used the porcine retina (<a href=\"#bib21\">Mussolino et al., 2011b</a>), which shares 19 out of 20 DNA bp with the human genomic ZF6-cis sequence (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1a</a>). Subretinal delivery of a low AAV8 vector dose (1x10<sup>10</sup> genome copies; gc) of ZF6-DB (AAV8-CMV-ZF6-DB) resulted in a 45% decrease of porcine <i>Rho</i> transcript levels at 15 days post-injection (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1d</a>). Immunofluorescence analysis showed depletion of Rho protein and consequent collapse of the rod outer segments in ZF6-DB positive cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1e,f</a>). Despite the lack of detectable <i>Rho</i> expression in most of the transduced rods, rows of photoreceptor nuclei were preserved from degeneration at this time point (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1e</a>). To further evaluate the extent of <i>Rho</i> silencing in rod photoreceptors by ZF6-DB, we performed FACS analysis on eGFP-labelled rod cells. Rod cells were isolated from porcine retina that had received a subretinal injection of an AAV vector encoding eGFP under the control of a rod-specific promoter (human <i>Guanine Nucleotide Binding Protein1, GNAT1</i> promoter elements (<a href=\"#bib12\">Lee et al., 2010</a>); AAV8-GNAT1-eGFP; dose 1x10<sup>12</sup> gc) with or without the vector encoding ZF6-DB (5x10<sup>10</sup> gc). Fifteen days after injection, the retina were disaggregated and FACS-sorted. The retina co-transduced with eGFP and ZF6-DB vector showed virtually a 'somatic knock-out' of <i>Rho</i> expression (~85% decrease of Rho transcript levels; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1g,h</a>)."

                        "text": "To evaluate genome\u2013wide transcriptional specificity, we analyzed the porcine retinal transcriptome by RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) from retina harvested 15 days after subretinal injection of the AAV8 vector encoding ZF6-DB (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). For comparison we used the engineered TF with the ED, KRAB (AAV8-CMV-ZF6-KRAB). The low vector doses delivered to the porcine retina (1x10<sup>10</sup> gc) resulted in about twenty-fold lower expression levels of the ZF6-DB and ZF6-KRAB transgenes compared to <i>Crx</i> and <i>Nrl</i>, two retina-specific TFs (<a href=\"#bib31\">Swaroop et al., 2010</a>) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a</a>). Of note, despite these low expression levels, we observed robust <i>Rho</i> transcriptional repression (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2b</a>). We then analyzed the transcriptional perturbation in response to the AAV retinal gene transfer of ZF6-DB by determining the differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Remarkably, <i>in vivo</i> the ZF6-DB protein generated about ten-fold less transcriptional perturbation compared with the ZF6-KRAB protein (19 vs. 222 DEGs; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2e</a>). Notably, this magnitude of perturbation is twenty five-fold lower than that induced by the ablation of an endogenous rod-specific TF (NRL, 500 DEGs vs 19 DEGs, ZF6-DBD; [<a href=\"#bib28\">Roger et al., 2014</a>]). Retinal-specific pathway analysis of DEGs showed that ZF6-DB\u2013induced down-regulation is restricted to the <i>Rho</i> biochemical interactor <i>Gnat1</i> (<a href=\"#bib23\">Palczewski, 2012</a>), and the up-regulation of 2 genes associated with acute phase inflammatory response, <i>alpha-2-macroglobulin (A2m</i>) and <i>glial fibrillary acidic protein (Gfap)</i> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2c</a>). ZF6-KRAB induced the de-regulation of 17 retinal network associated genes (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). These results suggest that both ZF6-DB and the consequent <i>Rho</i> down-regulation marginally interferes with photoreceptor specific pathways, apart from <i>Gnat1</i> repression, and that the up-regulation of the inflammatory response genes may be due to the collapse of the retinal scaffold caused by Rho depletion. The intersection of retinal transcriptome changes between ZF6-DB and ZF6-KRAB showed that both drive similar perturbation in the expression of 16 genes, which represent 84% of the entire pool of ZF6-DB DEGs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2e</a>). Consistently, both ZF6-DB and ZF6-KRAB generated similar functional effects, i.e. concordant up- or down- differential expression of these 16 shared genes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2d</a>). These results suggest that both ZF6-DB and ZF6-KRAB bind to similar genomic targets. We next studied whether the differential transcriptional repression induced by ZF6-DB and ZF6-KRAB was due to similar biochemical binding properties for the ZF6-cis DNA target. Both ZF6-DB and ZF6-KRAB proteins bind the ZF6-cis <i>RHO</i> DNA target site with similar affinities (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). These data suggest that, despite the presence of an active canonical repressor domain, ZF6-KRAB generated <i>Rho</i> silencing by DNA binding. Indeed, ZF6-DB, being exclusively a DNA-binding protein identical to the DBD of ZF6-KRAB, showed similar <i>Rho</i> silencing effects but far less retinal transcriptional perturbations. This indicates that the specificity is conferred by both the engineered design of the DNA-binding on a genome-specific target (<a href=\"#bib2\">Beerli and Barbas, 2002</a>) and the lack of the ED. In addition, this finding supports the notion that that ZF6-cis CRE is necessary for <i>Rho</i> expression genome-wide."

To achieve simultaneous photoreceptor transduction of both ZF6-DB and <i>hRHO</i>, we cloned the two expression cassettes into a single vector (DNA-binding repression and replacement, DBR-R, construct; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a</a>). The key variables to achieve highly differential expression required for balanced simultaneous <i>RHO</i> repression and replacement are the vector dose and promoter strength. Indeed, ZF6-DB (~200 counts; RNA-seq expression levels) generated a decrease of about 100,000 <i>Rho</i> RNA-seq counts after transduction (~250,000 counts in controls vs. ~150,000 after treatment; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a,b</a>). Thus, to ensure high and rod-specific <i>hRHO</i> replacement, we opted for a high vector dose and the strength of the <i>GNAT1</i> promoter (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1h</a>; [<a href=\"#bib12\">Lee et al., 2010</a>]). To decrease ZF6-DB expression levels at high vector dose, while keeping rod-specificity, we both shortened the human <i>RHO</i> promoter and deleted the 5\u2019 sequence of the ZF6-DB target ZF6-Cis (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

The combination of <i>Rho</i> transcriptional silencing and the restricted transcriptome perturbation induced by ZF6-DB, without the intrinsic repression activity contained in an ED, indicate that the local binding to ZF6-cis per se is the determinant of transcriptional repression, whereas the high specificity observed may result by both DNA-binding specificity (biochemical affinity) of ZF6-DB and the rod genomic context. The transcriptional repression mechanism of ZF6-DB binding likely relies on the interference occurring between TFs and local DNA sequence features within the <i>RHO</i> proximal promoter region (<a href=\"#bib19\">Mitton et al., 2000</a>), which we showed here to be necessary to control <i>Rho</i> expression at the genomic level. The lack of known TFBSs and the low level of expression of ZF6-DB expressed in the photoreceptors, which was twenty-fold below the levels of photoreceptor specific TFs (<i>Crx</i> and <i>Nrl</i>), suggest that the molecular determinant of silencing may not be the simple displacement of key <i>RHO</i> TFs (<a href=\"#bib18\">Mao et al., 2011</a>). We propose a model in which the molecular features of the DNA (loop, twisting, bending, for instance) may contribute to <i>Rhodopsin</i> transcriptional output. In this context, the DNA may be envisaged as not being exclusively the source of storage of functional information (protein coding and non-coding transcripts) or an inert DNA-binding protein harbor (i.e. positional information for TFs DNA binding), but also as an intrinsically active operator of the transcriptional function. This contribution of DNA is supported by both the\u00a0transcriptional repression upon the ZF6-cis deletion of 20 bp of DNA and intereference in trans by using a synthetic DNA binding protein that, not being encoded by the genome, may occupy a protein-free portion of the genome. It follows that in terms of signaling, the information source, the DNA, generates an output signal the RNA and eventually a protein (TF), whose final output functional activity is completed back by the DNA. Thus the information source, the DNA, becomes also integral part of the signaling (<i>Rhodopsin</i> transcriptional output).\u00a0In this vision, to act (interfere) upstream the DNA, an external function is necessary, which is, in this study, the synthetic ZF6-DB carried by the vector."

DNA binding interference via ZF6-DB in transduced retina generated 45% <i>Rho</i> transcriptional repression, which reached 85% when rods were sorted, supporting its use for diseases requiring correction of a large number of affected cells, such as adRP and other Mendelian disorders due to gain-of-function mutations. Furthermore, <i>Rho</i> transcriptional silencing and its complete <i>RHO</i> replacement support in principle the use of the DBR-R constructs for treatment of any <i>RHO</i> mutation including those caused by a dominant negative mechanism (<a href=\"#bib18\">Mao et al., 2011</a>). However, the 38% silencing and replacement observed may not yet be sufficient to achieve therapeutic efficacy/benefit in patients with adRP. Therefore, further development of this proof-of-concept will include optimization of the design of the silencing and replacement double construct (tuning the strength of the promoter elements), vector selection and dose, and the surgical approach. In conclusion, in vivo retinal gene transfer of an AAV vector (<a href=\"#bib5\">Doria et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Liang et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Scatchard, 1949</a>) carrying a 22\u2009kDa orthogonal (<a href=\"#bib30\">Surace et al., 2005</a>) and gene-extrinsic noise-resistant (the permissive rod photoreceptor cell-specific environment; [<a href=\"#bib13\">Li et al., 2011</a>]) synthetic protein acts as a transcriptional repressor, which results in a potent and specific silencing of the <i>Rho</i> gene upon binding to an essential <i>Rho</i> DNA element."

The following oligonucleotides were used as primers: primer 1, (GGAATTCCATATGGAATTCCCCATGGATGC) and primer 2, (CGGGATCCCTATCTAGAAGTCTTTTTACCGGTATG), for ZF6-KRAB primer 3, (GGAATTCCATATGCTGGAACCTGGCGAAAAACCG) and primer 4,(CGGGATCCCTATCTAGAAGTCTTTTTACCGGTATG) for ZF6-DB. All the PCR products were digested with the restriction enzymes NdeI and BamH1 and cloned into NdeI BamH1-digested pMal C5G (New England Biolabs,\u00a0Ipswich, MA) bacterial expression vector. All the plasmids obtained were sequenced to confirm that there were no mutations in the coding sequences. The fusion proteins were expressed in the <i>Escherichia coli</i> BL21DE3 host strain. The transformed cells were grown in rich medium plus 0.2% glucose (according to protocol from New England Biolabs) at 37\u00b0C until the absorbance at 600 nm was 0.6\u20130.8, at which time the medium was supplemented with 200 \u00b5M ZnSO4, and protein expression was induced with 0.3\u2009mM isopropyl 1-thio-\u03b2-D-galactopyranoside and was allowed to proceed for 2\u2009hr. The cells were then harvested, resuspended in 1X PBS (pH 7.4), 1\u2009mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1\u00a0\u00b5M leupeptin, 1\u00a0\u00b5M aprotinin, and 10 \u00b5g/ml lysozyme, sonicated, and centrifuged for 30\u2009min at 27,500 relative centrifugal force. The supernatant was then loaded on amylose resin (New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. To remove the MBP from the proteins, bound fusion proteins as cleaved in situ on the amylose resin with Factor Xa (1 unit/20 \u00b5g of MBP fusion protein) in FXa buffer (20\u2009mM Tris, pH 8.0, 100\u2009mM NaC1, 2\u2009mM CaC1<sub>2</sub>) for 24\u201348\u2009hr at 4\u00b0C and collected in the same buffer after centrifugation at 500 relative centrifugal force for 5\u2009min.

They show that the engineered transcription factor lacking the effector domain silences rather specifically the expression of rhodopsin gene as determined by transcriptome analyses. They report that AAV-based delivery of the engineered rhodopsin-specific transcription factor protein without ED to the retina of a transgenic mouse with a human rhodopsin gene harboring a dominant negative RHO mutation prevented retinal degeneration.

While the data reported in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> suggest that repression of RHO expression in transduced photoreceptor cells is closer to 90%, it is unclear if suppressing RHO expression in 35% of photoreceptor cells would be therapeutic.
