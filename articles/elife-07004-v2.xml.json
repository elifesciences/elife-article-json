These observations suggest an active selection process for tumor-initiating cells. Here, we use quantitative mRNA- and miR-Seq to determine the impact of <i>Hras</i><sup><i>G12V</i></sup> on the transcriptome of keratinocytes. We discover that <i>microRNA-203</i> is downregulated by <i>Hras</i><sup><i>G12V</i></sup>. Using a knockout mouse model, we demonstrate that loss of <i>microRNA-203</i> promotes selection and expansion of tumor-initiating cells. Conversely, restoration of <i>microRNA-203</i> using an inducible model potently inhibits proliferation of these cells. We comprehensively identify <i>microRNA-203</i> targets required for <i>Hras</i>-initiated tumorigenesis. These targets include critical regulators of the <i>Ras</i> pathway and essential genes required for cell division. This study establishes a role for the loss of <i>microRNA-203</i> in promoting selection and expansion of <i>Hras</i> mutated cells and identifies a mechanism through which <i>microRNA-203</i> antagonizes <i>Hras</i>-mediated tumorigenesis."

These observations suggest an active selection process for tumor-initiating cells. Here, we use quantitative mRNA- and miR-Seq to determine the impact of <i>Hras</i><sup><i>G12V</i></sup> on the transcriptome of keratinocytes. We discover that <i>microRNA-203</i> is downregulated by <i>Hras</i><sup><i>G12V</i></sup>. Using a knockout mouse model, we demonstrate that loss of <i>microRNA-203</i> promotes selection and expansion of tumor-initiating cells. Conversely, restoration of <i>microRNA-203</i> using an inducible model potently inhibits proliferation of these cells. We comprehensively identify <i>microRNA-203</i> targets required for <i>Hras</i>-initiated tumorigenesis. These targets include critical regulators of the <i>Ras</i> pathway and essential genes required for cell division. This study establishes a role for the loss of <i>microRNA-203</i> in promoting selection and expansion of <i>Hras</i> mutated cells and identifies a mechanism through which <i>microRNA-203</i> antagonizes <i>Hras</i>-mediated tumorigenesis."

These common mutations lead to the uncontrolled activation of genes that are normally tightly controlled, which in turn allows the cells to divide more and live for longer: these are two key features of cancer cells."

One mechanism rests on binding sites in their messenger RNA sequence that are recognized by smaller RNA molecules called microRNAs. RNA molecules are created when genes are transcribed. Some RNAs, called messenger RNAs, are then decoded to create proteins. Many other RNAs, including microRNAs, do not code for proteins, but instead bind to many messenger RNA targets, and repress their ability to be decoded into proteins. Three genes, called <i>Hras</i>, <i>Kras</i>, and <i>Nras</i>, are regulated in this way by numerous microRNAs, which together act to dampen the normal activities of these genes."

This microRNA, called <i>microRNA-203</i>, acts to limit the proliferation of skin cells when these cells are dividing rapidly. When the gene encoding <i>microRNA-203</i> was deleted in mice, the skin cells proliferated more.

When genome sequencing data were utilized to construct the history of cancer cells in breast cancer, it was revealed that a considerable amount of \u2018molecular time\u2019 exists between the common ancestors that harbor the great majority of driver mutations and the phenotypically identified cancer cells that compose the bulk of the tumor (<a href=\"#bib30\">Nik-Zainal et al., 2012</a>). In support of these observations, lineage tracing experiments conducted in genetically engineered mouse models revealed that only a few clones give rise to tumors whereas a vast majority of mutated cells are unable to sustain tumorigenesis (<a href=\"#bib12\">Driessens et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Schepers et al., 2012</a>). These results suggest that even after the acquisition of key driver mutations in the nascent cancer cells, these cells must still undergo continuous evolution and likely clonal selection before developing into clinically apparent tumors. To begin to understand the molecular basis underlying such selection, we examined papilloma formation driven by oncogenic <i>Hras</i> in the skin, a well-characterized model where <i>Hras</i> has been shown to initiate the formation of tumors that clonally evolve (<a href=\"#bib8\">Brown et al., 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Driessens et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Beck and Blanpain, 2013</a>). Oncogenic <i>Ras</i> mutations are some of the most frequently detected driver mutations in human cancer. Among the three <i>Ras</i> genes (<i>H</i>-, <i>K</i>-, and <i>N-ras</i>), <i>Hras</i> is commonly mutated in tumors originated from stratified epithelial tissues including squamous cell carcinoma in the skin, head, and neck cancer as well as bladder cancer (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bos, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Agrawal et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Stransky et al., 2011</a>). Experimental and genomic sequencing studies have revealed that the vast majority of <i>Ras</i> mutations are missense, point mutations at amino acid residues glycine 12 (G12), glycine 13 (G13), or glutamine 61 (Q61) (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bos, 1989</a>). Structural and biochemical studies have further confirmed that all of these mutations generally interfere with the GTP binding pocket and compromise the GTPase activity of <i>Ras</i> proteins. In turn, these mutations lead to uncontrolled activation of downstream effectors including Raf/MEK/ERK and PI(3)K pathways, resulting in sustained cell survival and proliferation observed in human cancers. Because of the prominent role of <i>Ras</i> mutations in human cancer, extensive efforts have been devoted to uncover and subsequently target downstream pathways that are regulated by <i>Ras</i> mutations. However, the immediate impact of <i>Ras</i> mutations on the transcriptome, in particular, with regards to microRNAs (miRNAs) remains unclear."

These regulatory RNA molecules function by repressing the protein producing ability of mRNA targets through destabilization of mRNAs and inhibition of translation (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bartel, 2009</a>). miRNAs typically target a large number of mRNAs in a dosage- and cell context-dependent manner (<a href=\"#bib29\">Mukherji et al., 2011</a>). As prominent proto-oncogenes, <i>Ras</i> mutations have long been recognized to interact with the miRNA pathway. Indeed, <i>Hras</i>, <i>Kras</i>, and <i>Nras</i> all harbor multiple binding sites for the <i>let-7</i> miRNA, a founding member of miRNAs, in their 3\u2032UTRs (<a href=\"#bib19\">Johnson et al., 2005</a>). Additionally, impaired miRNA biogenesis in the form of <i>Dicer1</i> disruption has been shown to be a tumor-suppressing mechanism for the development of <i>Kras</i>-induced lung cancer in a mouse model (<a href=\"#bib21\">Kumar et al., 2007</a>). A number of individual miRNAs were also found to function as modifiers for <i>Ras</i>-induced tumorigenesis that include <i>miR-21</i>, <i>-29,</i> and <i>miR-17\u223c92</i> as tumor-promoting miRNAs and <i>miR-34, -15/16</i>, and <i>miR-143/145</i> as tumor-suppressing miRNAs (<a href=\"#bib20\">Kasinski and Slack, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Iorio and Croce, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Mendell and Olson, 2012</a>). Collectively, these seminal studies demonstrate unequivocally that the miRNA pathway and individual miRNAs play important roles in <i>Ras</i>-induced tumorigenesis. However, it is unclear how <i>Ras</i> mutations, usually the tumor-initiating drivers, directly alter the landscape of miRNA expression during tumorigenesis. Importantly, it is also unknown whether the changes in miRNA expression play a role in the selection of oncogenic <i>Ras</i>-transformed cells during tumor initiation. Finally, the lack of a comprehensive survey of high-confidence miRNA targets that may play a role downstream of <i>Ras</i> mutations hinders our mechanistic understanding and limits the potential to develop miRNA-based therapeutics."

However, the molecular consequences defining the cellular changes that accompany expansion of oncogenic <i>Hras</i>-transformed keratinocytes to initiate papillomas remain elusive. We first investigated the consequences of <i>Hras</i><sup><i>G12V</i></sup> activation on the mRNA transcriptome using a modified form of PolyA+ RNA-Seq, known as 3P-Seq, or 3seq (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A\u2013C</a>). Compared to traditional RNA-Seq, 3Seq allows both quantification of mRNA transcripts and detection of changes in alternative 3\u2032 UTR formation (<a href=\"#bib37\">Wang et al., 2013</a>). To examine the immediate impact of <i>Hras</i><sup><i>G12V</i></sup> on primary skin cells, we used primary keratinocytes isolated from newborn skin and performed 3Seq after <i>Hras</i><sup><i>G12V</i></sup> transduction. We did not observe widespread shortening or alternative formation of 3\u2032UTRs, which are often ascribed to oncogenic transformation when comparing tumor cell lines to normal cells (data not shown). This is similar to our previous observation that alternative 3\u2032UTR usage is infrequent within the skin lineages (<a href=\"#bib37\">Wang et al., 2013</a>). Over 1100 transcripts were differently expressed (two-fold change and FDR &lt;0.05) in keratinocytes expressing <i>Hras</i><sup><i>G12V</i></sup>, compared to the control (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a> and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>). Gene ontology functional analysis revealed profound deregulation in three core processes by <i>Hras</i><sup><i>G12V</i></sup>: activation of cellular migration, upregulation of pro-angiogenic pathways, and suppression of the terminal differentiation program (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). All of these three processes are identified as hallmarks of human cancer (<a href=\"#bib16\">Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011</a>). The observed widespread changes in the transcriptome also endorse the driver role of <i>Hras</i><sup><i>G12V</i></sup> in skin tumorigenesis. Importantly, transcripts upregulated by <i>Hras</i><sup><i>G12V</i></sup> in our primary keratinocytes strongly and significantly overlapped with the putative cancer stem cell signatures obtained from murine squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) models (<a href=\"#bib32\">Schober and Fuchs, 2011</a>). In addition, transcripts upregulated by <i>Hras</i><sup><i>G12V</i></sup> significantly overlapped with transcripts known to be targets of the <i>c-Fos</i> transcription factor in a genetic model of SCC (<a href=\"#bib13\">Durchdewald et al., 2008</a>). Furthermore, known core components of the <i>Hras</i> signaling pathway were also among the differentially detected genes (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bild et al., 2006</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). These transcriptome data indicate that we have captured the initiating changes induced by oncogenic <i>Hras</i> in the keratinocytes."

The upregulation of <i>miR-21</i> is also consistent with its well-appreciated oncogenic function in skin cancer (<a href=\"#bib10\">Darido et al., 2011</a>). <i>miR-146</i> was also induced by <i>Hras</i><sup><i>G12V</i></sup>.

We previously characterized the transcribed genomic region of <i>miR-203</i> including the promoter region and transcription start site (<a href=\"#bib18\">Jackson et al., 2013</a>). Because the primary transcript <i>of miR-203</i> harbors a polyadenylation [Poly(A)] signal and generates a Poly(A) tail, we directly quantified the abundance of the primary transcripts by counting the 3\u2032end reads of the primary miRNA obtained by 3seq (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). This result was further confirmed by qPCR measurement specific to the <i>pri-miR-203</i> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). The degree of downregulation for both mature and primary <i>miR-203</i> transcripts was similar as judged by these two independent assays.

We further investigated <i>miR-203</i> expression with in situ hybridization during skin tumorigenesis in vivo. In classic chemical carcinogenesis models initiated by DMBA/TPA treatment of mouse skin, <i>Hras</i> is preferentially mutated, which compromises the GTPase activity and results in constitutive Hras activation. Mutating <i>Hras</i> at Q61 leads to papilloma development and infrequent malignant transformation to SCCs (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abel et al., 2009</a>). We first examined <i>miR-203</i> expression in benign papillomas. Consistent with our in vitro results, <i>miR-203</i> expression was absent from epithelial compartments adjacent to tumor stroma, the region where putative cancer stem cells reside. Although we also observed moderately expressed <i>miR-203</i> in tumor regions with evidence of cellular differentiation (keratin pearls and large differentiated morphology), the levels of <i>miR-203</i> was considerably lower in these regions compared to the suprabasal cells of adjacent normal skin, where <i>miR-203</i> is normally expressed (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). Overall, <i>miR-203</i> expression levels were strongly reduced in tumor tissues compared to adjacent epidermal regions. In an independent mouse model of SCC, we also found that <i>miR-203</i> expression was gradually lost in a <i>Kras</i><sup><i>G12D</i></sup><i>/Smad4</i><sup><i>cKO</i></sup> model where skin tumors progressed to invasive SCC through serial passages of tumors (<a href=\"#bib38\">White et al., 2013</a>) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>). Taken together, these results demonstrate that <i>miR-203</i> is significantly downregulated at both early and late stages of papilloma and SCC formation in mouse models."

In these human skin SCC samples, <i>miR-203</i> was already downregulated at the onset of tumorigenesis and progressively lost during the course of tumor progression, similar to the pattern observed in the mouse models. In the poorly differentiated SCC samples, the <i>miR-203</i> signal was completely absent, yet readily detectable in surrounding hyperplastic or normal epidermal regions (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G\u2013O</a>). In addition, we mined publically available data sets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and detected a significant reduction in <i>miR-203</i> and an elevation of <i>miR-21</i> in head and neck SCC samples compared to patient-matched normal tissues (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2P</a>). Altogether, these results corroborate our observations in mouse models and validate the strong correlation between the loss of <i>miR-203</i> and the development of skin cancer at multiple stages of tumorigenesis. These expression analyses suggest that the loss of <i>miR-203</i> coincides with the tumor-initiating events and <i>miR-203</i> might function as a tumor-suppressing mechanism in skin cancer."

Because <i>miR-203</i> begins to be expressed by E13 when the epidermis begins to stratify, we examined the proliferation rate and thickness of embryonic skin from E16 to P4. At E16, we observed a mild increase in cell proliferation in the KO, as measured by BrdU incorporation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E,F</a>). Although the difference in BrdU incorporation did not achieve statistical significance (p = 0.07), the thickness of the KO epidermis was significantly increased, compared to WT littermates (p = 0.03). Interestingly, the increase in epidermal thickness was most prominent at early stages (E16 and E17) and waned as skin development progressed (P4) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>). At P4, <i>miR-203</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> mice displayed normal histological development of the epidermis and hair follicles, and the difference in proliferation and epidermal thickness between KO and WT became indistinguishable (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>).

Lastly, a ranked sum analysis that ranked genes based on expression changes correlated with the levels of <i>miR-203</i> showed that genes with the 8-mer or 7-mer seed ranked significantly higher than those transcripts without seed matches (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>)."

The HITS-CLIP faithfully captured miRNA species expressed in keratinocytes, including <i>miR-203</i> (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2B,E</a>). Overall our HITS-CLIP reads and clusters alignment were similar to previous published results with a significant portion aligned to 3\u2032UTRs (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2D</a>). To further validate our approach, we analyzed the positional enrichment of miRNA seed sequences within the 3\u2032UTR HITS-CLIP clusters and detected strong enrichment over dinucleotide shuffled cluster sequences or randomly distributed 3\u2032UTR regions (<a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>). Additionally, de novo motif searching for 8mer motifs identified the seed sequences of miRNAs that are highly expressed in keratinocytes (<a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>). The motif corresponding to <i>miR-203</i> detected by the HITS-CLIP was also ACAUUUCA (p = 1 \u00d7 10<sup>\u221219</sup>), identical to the motif detected by our transcriptome analysis (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>).

Given our findings that the loss of <i>miR-203</i> promotes the selection and expansion of oncogenic <i>Hras</i>-transformed cells both in vivo and in vitro, we were interested in understanding the underlying mechanism. Overall, <i>miR-203</i> targets identified in the meta-analysis were enriched in the upregulated transcripts in <i>Hras</i><sup><i>G12V</i></sup>-transformed keratinocytes, compared to non-targeted transcripts, consistent with the downregulation of <i>miR-203</i> in these cells (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Among these targets, we were intrigued by the observation that multiple regulators of the <i>Ras</i> signaling pathway and critical factors for DNA replication and cell cycle progression were among our high confidence targets and additionally were among the most upregulated <i>miR-203</i> targets in <i>Hras</i><sup><i>G12V</i></sup>-transformed keratinocytes (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). To begin to validate the high-confidence set of <i>miR-203</i> targets, we selected <i>Pola1</i> and <i>Hbegf</i> for further study. <i>Pola1</i> is the catalytic subunit of the DNA-POL-alpha holoenzyme, which is required in initiation of DNA replication during S-phase (<a href=\"#bib22\">Lehman and Kaguni, 1989</a>). <i>Hbegf</i> is an Egf-like ligand that activates MAPK signaling through activation of EGF-receptors, <i>Erbb1</i> and <i>Erbb4</i>. In keratinocytes, <i>Hbegf</i> is mitogenic and promotes keratinocyte migration (<a href=\"#bib33\">Stoll et al., 2012</a>). In an epithelial cancer cell line, <i>Hbegf</i> acts as an oncogene promoting cell proliferation (<a href=\"#bib27\">Miyamoto et al., 2004</a>). <i>Pola1</i> and <i>Hbegf</i> contain 3\u2032 UTR <i>miR-203</i> target sites (9-mer and 8-mer respectively) that are targeted by <i>miR-203</i>, validated by luciferase assay (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). Furthermore, in <i>miR-203</i> null epidermis, both <i>Pola1</i> and <i>Hbegf</i> mRNAs were elevated (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). In addition to mRNA levels, <i>Pola1</i> protein levels were also elevated in the absence of <i>miR-203</i>. It was further elevated in the presence of <i>Hras</i><sup><i>G12V</i></sup> and repressed by <i>miR-203</i> induction (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C,D</a>). We were unable to measure the protein level of <i>Hbegf</i> due to poor antibody performance. Additionally, we observed that the expression of <i>Ccnd1</i>, an essential cell cycle regulator that is often induced or amplified by oncogenic <i>Ras</i> (<a href=\"#bib11\">Downward, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Stransky et al., 2011</a>), showed a strong negative correlation to <i>miR-203</i> (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C,D</a>). This suggested that loss of <i>miR-203</i> increases the levels of <i>Ccnd1</i> and contributes to the observed upregulation of this critical gene."

                        "text": "Identification and experimental validation of driver gene mutations have been instrumental for our understanding of cancer biology (<a href=\"#bib36\">Vogelstein et al., 2013</a>). Although it is clear that not all cells harboring driver gene mutations develop into tumors, the mechanism of clonal selection within cells that have acquired driver gene mutations remains poorly understood. In this study, we used an oncogenic <i>Hras</i>-induced tumor model to determine the molecular consequences of this oncogenic driver mutation and to study the selection process. We quantitatively measured the impact of oncogenic <i>Hras</i><sup><i>G12V</i></sup> on the landscape of mRNA and miRNA expression. Whereas our mRNA-Seq data confirmed the profound ability of <i>Hras</i><sup><i>G12V</i></sup> in promoting cellular transformation, our miR-Seq data revealed new insights into the dynamic changes in highly expressed miRNAs caused by <i>Hras</i><sup><i>G12V</i></sup> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). In particular, the downregulation of <i>miR-203</i>, one of the most highly expressed miRNAs in the skin, likely occurs at the transcriptional level (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,D</a>). By examining tumor samples obtained from both mouse and human at multiple stages, we showed that the downregulation of <i>miR-203</i> is associated with tumor initiation and progression (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E\u2013P</a>). To determine the role of <i>miR-203</i> in this process, we generated a KO mouse model. Initial insights into the function of <i>miR-203</i> came from the analysis of <i>miR-203</i> null epidermis during skin development. Whereas we and others have shown the potent inhibition of epidermal proliferation by <i>miR-203</i> with gain-of-function approaches (<a href=\"#bib23\">Lena et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Yi et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Jackson et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Benaich et al., 2014</a>), it is unknown how the loss of <i>miR-203</i> affects the skin and mouse development in general. By analyzing the KO mouse, we revealed an early, albeit mild, hyperproliferative phenotype in the embryonic but not postnatal skin (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E\u2013I</a>). However, when we subjected <i>miR-203</i> WT and null cells obtained from postnatal skin for their colony-forming ability, we observed an increased ability of the <i>miR-203</i> null cells to give rise to colony-forming cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3J,K</a>). This observation was indicative of a role for <i>miR-203</i> in restricting the expansion of highly proliferative cells. Of note, we did not observe any defects in the formation of the differentiated layers of the skin in the <i>miR-203</i> KO mice. This suggests that the primary function of <i>miR-203</i> is to restrict cell proliferation but not to promote epidermal differentiation per se. When we examined the role of <i>miR-203</i> during DMBA/TPA-mediated chemical carcinogenesis, we observed strong increase in the number of papillomas formed in the KO skin (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013C</a>). In vitro colony formation assays with serial passages further illustrated the enhanced ability for selecting tumor-initiating cells with <i>miR-203</i> KO cells when subjected to <i>Hras</i><sup><i>G12V</i></sup> transformation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). However, due to tumor resistance of our C57BL/6 strain, we were unable to determine if the loss of <i>miR-203</i> also promotes malignant transition. Of note, a recent study showed interesting results that restoration of <i>miR-203</i> suppresses human SCC metastasis (<a href=\"#bib5\">Benaich et al., 2014</a>). Collectively, our results provide experimental evidence for an important role of <i>miR-203</i> in suppressing clonal selection and expansion of <i>Hras</i>-mutated nascent cancer cells."

                        "text": "A major challenge in understanding miRNA functions is to identify their high-confidence targets globally. To this end, we employed two independent approaches: transcriptome analysis with our KO and inducible models and direct miRNA target capture by <i>Ago2</i> HITS-CLIP (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). Importantly, with our expansive data set, we confirmed that <i>miR-203</i> utilizes the 5\u2032 seed sequences to target perfectly matched sequences located on the 3\u2032UTRs of its target genes. Consistent with recent genome-wide studies for the impact of miRNA on mRNA levels and translation efficiency in mammals (<a href=\"#bib15\">Guo et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Eichhorn et al., 2014</a>), we found no evidence for global changes of translational efficiency in the absence of <i>miR-203</i>, one of the most highly expressed miRNAs in the skin. However, we also noted that <i>Trp63</i>, a well-established <i>miR-203</i> target, showed little change at the mRNA levels under all conditions (not shown). Our analysis with differential gene expression did not identify <i>Trp63</i> as a <i>miR-203</i> target. In contrast, the recognition of the 3\u2032UTR site of <i>Trp63</i> by <i>miR-203</i> was robustly detected by the HITS-CLIP (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). Thus, it is likely that our identification of <i>miR-203</i> targets based on the transcriptome analysis alone was conservative. More studies will be required to further integrate direct miRNA target capture with transcriptome analysis for miRNA target identification. Nevertheless, we still observed strong enrichment of <i>miR-203</i> targets in genes required for cell proliferation. These high-confidence targets illustrate the broad targeting of cell proliferation by <i>miR-203</i> and suggest mechanisms by which loss of <i>miR-203</i> can facilitate the expansion of oncogenic <i>Hras</i>-transformed cells. These new insights point to the potential of utilizing <i>miR-203</i> to simultaneously target multiple effectors required for cell division in human cancers. We also note that <i>miR-203</i> is known to antagonize human papillomaviruses (HPV) (<a href=\"#bib25\">Melar-New and Laimins, 2010</a>). Our identification of <i>Pola1</i>, a critical cellular gene required for HPV genome replication, as a target of <i>miR-203</i> may provide a potential mechanism for miR-203-mediated antagonism against HPV infection. Finally, the relatively mild requirement for <i>miR-203</i> in slowly proliferating cells suggests that a reduction or increase in the level of <i>miR-203</i> may be well tolerated by most normal cells. This unexpected discovery could be further explored to determine <i>miR-203</i>'s therapeutic potential in treating certain types of epithelial cancers."

Primary keratinocytes were then plated in 6-cm or 10-cm dishes with E-Low media supplemented with 0.2 mM calcium chloride for the first 24 hr then switched to E-Low media with 0.05 mM Ca<sup>++</sup>. Lentiviral particles were produced by transient transfection of pLKO-shRNA constructs, PsPax.2, and pVSVG. 24 hr post transfection, the media was changed to E-Low calcium. Retroviral particles were produced by transient transfection of pBabe-vector-puro, pBabe-Hras<sup>G12V</sup>-puro, pBabe-vector-neo, or pBabe-Hras<sup>G12V</sup>-neo, with PCL-Eco and pAdvantage packaging plasmids. Viral supernatant was harvested every 12 hr for up to 96 hr, pooled and filtered with 0.45-\u03bcM filter. <i>Ad-eGFP</i> or <i>Ad-CREeGFP</i> adenoviruses were obtained from the Iowa Gene Transfer Core and used at MOI of 50. Retroviral and lentiviral infections were performed 3\u20134 days after plating primary keratinocytes. Keratinocytes were selected with 2 \u03bcg/ml puromycin for 48 hr or 50 \u03bcg/ml neomycin for 7 days, at which time non-infected cell cultures were non-viable. Spontaneously immortalized <i>miR-203</i><sup><i>+/+</i></sup>, <i>miR-203</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup>, and <i>miR-203</i><sup><i>fl/fl</i></sup> mouse keratinocyte cell lines were also generated via serial passage on mitomycin-C treated NIH-3T3 feeder cell culture layer and utilized for assays as noted in the text. Flow cytometry was performed as previously described, with minor modifications (<a href=\"#bib18\">Jackson et al., 2013</a>). Cell cultures derived from <i>pTre2-miR-203/Krt14-rtTA</i> animals were treated with 5 \u03bcg/ml doxycycline for 24 hr to induce <i>miR-203</i> expression, pulsed with EdU (10 \u03bcM) for 30 min, harvested and analyzed according to the Click-IT EdU Plus instructions on an BD Cyan flow cytometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For colony formation assays, 2000 cells were split into individual wells of 6-well plates, cultured for 10\u201314 days, fixed with 4% PFA, and stained with 0.2% crystal violet in 70% ethanol. For induction of <i>miR-203</i>, 24 hr after plating, cells were supplied with fresh media containing doxycycline at 5 \u03bcg/ml. Sigma\u2013Aldrich TRC lentiviral shRNAs against <i>Hbegf</i> and <i>Pola1</i> were obtained from the Functional Genomic Facility (University of Colorado at Boulder, sequences listed in <a href=\"#SD5-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>)."

They report the repression of <i>miR-203</i> by oncogenic H-Ras in squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, purporting that the stem cell pool is affected. This work emanates from previous work connecting <i>miR-203</i> to skin stem cell biology. Through loss and gain-of-function studies, the authors document the tumor suppressive role of <i>miR-203</i>, however, the mechanistic basis for the growth inhibitory role of <i>miR-203</i> is less well established in this study. The authors performed a large number of transcriptome-wide analyses on <i>miR-203</i>-deficient and overexpressing cells (RNA-seq, microarray, ribosome profiling, CLIP-seq) in an attempt to identify the mechanisms underlying the phenotypic effects they observed. Unfortunately, these studies were not highly informative, especially in the case of <i>miR-203</i>-/- cells, where only very minor gene expression changes were observed. Two targets of <i>miR-203</i> were documented and their loss of function diminishes cell viability, but whether this is H-Ras specific is not established. That is, whether knockdown of <i>Pola1</i> affect non-transformed cells was not specifically addressed, since the authors suggest that <i>Pola1</i> is involved in the 'Ras signaling pathway.' The mechanism by which activated H-Ras silence <i>miR-203</i> expression was also not addressed. Notwithstanding these concerns, the work appears quite extensive and thorough and therefore could be suitable for publication in <i>eLife</i>. The strength of the paper is the novel demonstration, through genetic deletion studies, that <i>miR-203</i> functions as a bona fide tumor suppressor in vivo. These findings are nicely correlated with in vitro data, establishing the ability of <i>miR-203</i> to modulate <i>Hras</i>-mediated transformation."
