We identify five different circadian (E) neurons that are a major source of rhythmicity and locomotor activity. Brief firing of PDF cells at different times of day generates a phase response curve (PRC), which mimics a light-mediated PRC and requires PDF receptor expression in the five E neurons. Firing also resembles light by causing TIM degradation in downstream neurons. Unlike light however, firing-mediated phase-shifting is CRY-independent and exploits the E3 ligase component CUL-3 in the early night to degrade TIM. Our results suggest that PDF neurons integrate light information and then modulate the phase of E cell oscillations and behavioral rhythms. The results also explain how fly brain rhythms persist in constant darkness and without CRY."

We identify five different circadian (E) neurons that are a major source of rhythmicity and locomotor activity. Brief firing of PDF cells at different times of day generates a phase response curve (PRC), which mimics a light-mediated PRC and requires PDF receptor expression in the five E neurons. Firing also resembles light by causing TIM degradation in downstream neurons. Unlike light however, firing-mediated phase-shifting is CRY-independent and exploits the E3 ligase component CUL-3 in the early night to degrade TIM. Our results suggest that PDF neurons integrate light information and then modulate the phase of E cell oscillations and behavioral rhythms. The results also explain how fly brain rhythms persist in constant darkness and without CRY."

Intracellular timekeeping mechanisms include transcriptional feedback loops, which involve many key genes in <i>Drosophila</i>. They include <i>period</i> (<i>per</i>), <i>timeless</i> (<i>tim</i>), <i>clock</i> (<i>clk</i>), <i>cycle</i> (<i>cyc</i>), and <i>doubletime</i> (<i>dbt</i>). Coordination of their encoded protein activities (<i>period</i>, PER; <i>timeless</i>, TIM; <i>clock</i>, CLK; <i>cycle</i>, CYC: and <i>doubletime</i>, DBT) contributes to the intracellular cycling of the molecular pacemaker, which is similar between flies and mammals (<a href=\"#bib9\">Dubruille and Emery, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Menet and Rosbash, 2011</a>). PER and TIM concentrations increase during the day, and they eventually negatively regulate their own transcription. Biochemical oscillations in the head occur in part through a direct interaction of PER and TIM with the positive transcription factor CLK: CYC (<a href=\"#bib9\">Dubruille and Emery, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Menet and Rosbash, 2011</a>). They also require the photoreceptor cryptochrome (CRY) as well as a cycling light:dark (LD) environment, that is, RNA and protein oscillations damp rapidly in constant darkness (<a href=\"#bib36\">Stanewsky et al., 1998</a>). The central brain is probably different as its molecular and behavioral rhythms persist in constant darkness and is CRY-independent (<a href=\"#bib36\">Stanewsky et al., 1998</a>)."

There is good evidence in favor of a cell-autonomous view of <i>Drosophila</i> phase-shifting: light penetrates the thin insect cuticle (<a href=\"#bib12\">Fogle et al., 2011</a>) and causes a CRY conformational change within circadian neurons (<a href=\"#bib29\">Ozturk et al., 2011</a>).

The phase of these cells is shifted by the M cell firing and requires PDF as well as the PDF receptor within these five E cells. Moreover, brief firing of M cells at different times of day generates a phase response curve (PRC), which resembles a proper light-mediated PRC. Brief M cell firing also resembles light by causing rapid TIM degradation within downstream circadian neurons, but firing-mediated phase-shifting is CRY-independent and exploits the E3 ligase components CUL-3 to degrade TIM, at least in the early night-delay zone. Our findings suggest that E cells are very important for timekeeping under light\u2013dark conditions whereas an important function of PDF cells is for light-mediated phase adjustment, that is, to integrate light information and appropriately fire. This degrades TIM within E cells, which modulates the phase of E cell oscillations and behavioral rhythms."

Although M cells (PDF neurons) are considered master pacemakers, neither expression of DBT<sup>S</sup> in M cells nor in its direct downstream target neurons-DN1ps (<a href=\"#bib49\">Zhang et al., 2010a</a>, <a href=\"#bib50\">2010b</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Seluzicki et al., 2014</a>) changes the locomotor activity pattern or phase (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). In contrast, the evening peak phase is dramatic advanced when accelerating the endogenous clock in the 5 Dv-E cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>), indicating that the E cells independently determine the major activity phase in LD (<a href=\"#bib37\">Stoleru et al., 2007</a>)."

Compared to control flies, that is, flies that express inactive tetanus toxin UAS-Tet, <i>Dv-E GAL4/UAS-TNT</i> flies have a severe circadian locomotor activity deficiency.

Moreover, the effect of CUL-3 is particularly striking when TIM is cytoplasmic in the early night. This suggests that CUL-3 might be important for PDF mediated, CRY-independent TIM degradation and phase-shifting, especially in the early night-delay zone. Indeed, co-expression of CUL-3 RNAi with dTrpA1 under <i>DvPdf-GAL4</i> control did not significantly affect DD rhythmicity and period at 21\u00b0C (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Grima et al., 2012</a>). However, these flies had reduced firing-mediated phase delays at ZT15 (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). TIM staining revealed that the co-expression also substantially reduced TIM degradation in <i>DvPdf-GAL4</i> labeled M and E cells (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B,C</a>). In contrast, TIM degradation within the DNs was potent and indistinguishable from control strains, presumably because the <i>DvPdf-GAL4</i> driver and UAS constructs are not expressed in the DNs (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>). This suggests that the effects of the CUL-3 RNAi constructs are principally cell-autonomous and that dTrpA1-mediated M cell-firing remains potent despite co-expression of the RNAi constructs. The results taken together indicate that M cell firing in the early night activates a PDFR-CUL-3 pathway to reduce cytoplasmic TIM accumulation. The results also imply that TIM levels within the <i>DvPdf-GAL4-</i>labeled pacemakers make a substantial contribution to the magnitude of the phase delay. We therefore suggest that E cells are major pacemakers under more natural L-D conditions and that M cells serve principally to integrate light information and phase adjust the E cells through firing and PDF release (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>)."

Here we provide a modified configuration with a more prominent role for 5 Dv-E cells (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>). This view is based on several new and unanticipated results. First, the 5 Dv-E cells are not only responsible for the evening anticipation peak and its timing, but they also contribute to the morning peak, free running rhythms and total activity. Otherwise put, these cells appear to play a key role in all aspects of circadian rhythms and locomotor activity. Second, E cell resetting can occur in a non cell-autonomous manner, through M cell neuron firing, PDF release and E cell PDFR activation. Third, TIM level changes within the 5 Dv-E cells in response to M cell firing likely make a major contribution to the resulting phase changes, at least in the early night when phase delays occur, and therefore make a major contribution to circadian timekeeping under more normal LD conditions."

Because many aspects of Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) function in mammals resemble those of PDF in flies (<a href=\"#bib44\">Vosko et al., 2007</a>), it will be interesting to know if VIP cell firing can mimic light and phase-shift mammalian rhythms."

This conclusion is also consistent with more recent data from Emery et al. (<a href=\"#bib19\">Lamba et al., 2014</a>). Our data here also point to a more important role of the LNds rather than the M cells: the LNds show more TIM degradation in response to firing and a bigger response to the CUL-3 knockdown, which correlates with the decrease in phase delay caused by the knockdown (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>)."

Our data extend this picture to the more dorsal circadian DNs by showing that TIM degradation within this circadian subpopulation is probably also not essential, at least to phase delays (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B,C</a>) (<a href=\"#bib19\">Lamba et al., 2014</a>).

Yet previous results connect the M cells to morning activity (<a href=\"#bib7\">Choi et al., 2012</a>). These cells also communicate via PDF with the DN1p dorsal neurons, which also impact the morning anticipation peak (<a href=\"#bib49\">Zhang et al., 2010a</a>, <a href=\"#bib50\">2010b</a>). Although all of these considerations suggest that redundant circuits downstream of the M cells underlie the morning anticipation peak, only output from the Dv-E cells has been shown to be necessary for morning activity, and there is evidence that even the M cells are not necessary for the morning activity peak (<a href=\"#bib35\">Sheeba et al., 2010</a>)."

However, their firing-resetting properties, the identification of the Dv-E cells as major activity neurons even in DD and the likely importance of TIM degradation within these cells for phase adjustment suggest a different reason for the strong molecular rhythms of the PDF neurons in DD and their contribution to behavioral rhythmicity under these conditions. These features likely reflect the important role of the PDF neurons as light-sensitive cells, directly through CRY and indirectly as post-synaptic targets of other light-sensitive cells such as photoreceptor cells within the eye and dorsal brain (<a href=\"#bib26\">Malpel et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Yoshii et al., 2008</a> and unpublished data). We therefore suggest that a major function of the PDF neurons is to integrate light information and use it to phase-adjust the Dv-E cells, which are important pacemakers under LD conditions (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>). Phase is a more important parameter than period under these more \u2018natural\u2019 conditions, and expression of period-altering mutants under Dv-E control appropriately alters the phase of the major evening peak but fails to do so under PDF control (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a> and data not shown)."

The amplitude of peripheral oscillators is dependent on light as they damp rapidly after transfer of flies to constant darkness. Fly peripheral oscillators are also dependent on the photoreceptor CRY (<a href=\"#bib36\">Stanewsky et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Malpel et al., 2002</a>). In contrast, the circadian brain network and resultant rhythmic behavior persist in constant darkness and in the absence of CRY (<a href=\"#bib10\">Emery et al., 1998</a>, <a href=\"#bib11\">2000</a>). Our work here can explain this difference in a simple way: neuronal firing replaces the function of light and CRY and even acts at the same step in the circadian cycle, namely, to promote TIM degradation within circadian neurons. We suggest that this step is intrinsically weak and that TIM degradation is normally potentiated every day, by light and/or by firing. This ensures the maintenance of robust rhythms of brain and behavior without compromising the light- and firing-sensitivity needed for phase adjustment."

In particular, the authors ask whether phase-shifting of the clock (synchronization to day-night cycles) involves neuronal firing and intercellular communication. Although cell-autonomous CRYPTOCHOME-dependent degradation of the TIMELESS clock protein is a key mechanism in molecular phase-shifting, previous work from the same lab has shown that non cell-autonomous resetting mechanisms also operate in the clock neuronal network. They show here that neuronal excitation of the PDF-expressing morning cells can induce both advances and delays of the behavioral rhythms, similarly to what light pulses do. These behavioral phase shifts are correlated with TIM degradation in morning and evening cells. TIM degradation does not require CRY and appears to rely upon the activity of CUL-3 ubiquitylation complexes for evening signals."
