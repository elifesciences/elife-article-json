The centriolar protein Cp110 is a regulator of this process and cilia inhibitor, but its positive roles in ciliogenesis remain poorly understood. Using <i>Xenopus</i> we show that Cp110 inhibits cilia formation at high levels, while optimal levels promote ciliogenesis. Cp110 localizes to cilia-forming basal bodies and rootlets, and is required for ciliary adhesion complexes that facilitate Actin interactions. The opposing roles of Cp110 in ciliation are generated in part by coiled-coil domains that mediate preferential binding to centrioles over rootlets. Because of its dual role in ciliogenesis, Cp110 levels must be precisely controlled. In multiciliated cells, this is achieved by both transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation through ciliary transcription factors and microRNAs, which activate and repress <i>cp110</i> to produce optimal Cp110 levels during ciliogenesis. Our data provide novel insights into how Cp110 and its regulation contribute to development and cell function."

The centriolar protein Cp110 is a regulator of this process and cilia inhibitor, but its positive roles in ciliogenesis remain poorly understood. Using <i>Xenopus</i> we show that Cp110 inhibits cilia formation at high levels, while optimal levels promote ciliogenesis. Cp110 localizes to cilia-forming basal bodies and rootlets, and is required for ciliary adhesion complexes that facilitate Actin interactions. The opposing roles of Cp110 in ciliation are generated in part by coiled-coil domains that mediate preferential binding to centrioles over rootlets. Because of its dual role in ciliogenesis, Cp110 levels must be precisely controlled. In multiciliated cells, this is achieved by both transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation through ciliary transcription factors and microRNAs, which activate and repress <i>cp110</i> to produce optimal Cp110 levels during ciliogenesis. Our data provide novel insights into how Cp110 and its regulation contribute to development and cell function."

Modified centrioles, called basal bodies, dock to the cell membrane, serve as microtubule organizing centers (MTOCs) during cilia formation and anchor cilia to the membrane as well as to the Actin cytoskeleton (<a href=\"#bib30\">Marshall, 2008</a>). Because centrioles also act as MTOCs during spindle formation, cell division and cilia formation are mutually exclusive events. Thus, switching from cell division to cilia formation needs precise molecular regulation at the centriole (<a href=\"#bib2\">Avidor-Reiss and Gopalakrishnan, 2013</a>). One key event during this process is the removal of the Centriolar Coiled Coil Protein 110kDa (Cp110) from the distal end of the mother centriole, which then matures into a basal body (<a href=\"#bib46\">Tsang and Dynlacht, 2013</a>). Failure of distal end removal or excess cellular levels of Cp110 prevent cilia formation in various cell types. Conversely, loss of Cp110 was suggested to initiate aberrant cilia formation during the cell cycle (<a href=\"#bib41\">Spektor et al., 2007</a>). Of note, some studies indicate that <i>Cp110</i> knockdown initiates elongation of cytoplasmic centrioles, rather than <i>bona fide</i> cilia formation (<a href=\"#bib36\">Schmidt et al., 2009</a>)."

MCCs can form &gt;100 basal bodies, and their biogenesis occurs through an alternative, MCC-specific deuterosome pathway (<a href=\"#bib5\">Brooks and Wallingford, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Zhang and Mitchell, 2015</a>). MCC cilia are motile and account for the generation of directional extracellular fluid flow along epithelia, such as that required for mucus clearance from the conducting airways (<a href=\"#bib28\">Mall, 2008</a>). Interestingly, while Cp110 levels are mainly regulated via the ubiquitin-dependent proteasome system during the cell cycle (<a href=\"#bib12\">D'Angiolella et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Li et al., 2013</a>), Cp110 levels in differentiated MCCs are also subject to post-transcriptional repression by microRNAs (miRs) from the <i>miR-34/449</i> family (<a href=\"#bib40\">Song et al., 2014</a>). Surprisingly, we also found that loss of Cp110 inhibits cilia formation in MCCs (<a href=\"#bib40\">Song et al., 2014</a>), suggesting a more complex, and supportive role for Cp110 in ciliogenesis than previously anticipated. A recent report further supports this view, as deletion of <i>Cp110</i> exon 5 impairs primary cilia formation in the mouse (<a href=\"#bib54\">Yadav et al., 2016</a>)."

We show that Cp110 localizes to cilia-forming basal bodies and is required for the formation and function of all principal types of cilia (i.e. primary sensory cilia, motile mono-cilia and motile cilia of MCCs). In MCCs, Cp110 is specifically needed for ciliary adhesion complex (<a href=\"#bib1\">Antoniades et al., 2014</a>) formation and basal body interactions with the Actin cytoskeleton. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Cp110's opposing roles in ciliogenesis are determined by its multi-domain protein structure. Due to its dual role, optimal Cp110 levels need to be produced to facilitate multi-ciliogenesis. We provide evidence, that optimal regulation of cellular Cp110 levels in MCCs is achieved through a transcriptional/post-transcriptional gene regulatory module, consisting of ciliary transcription factors and miRNAs (<a href=\"#bib40\">Song et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Choksi et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Marcet et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Chevalier et al., 2015</a>)."

Extracellular fluid flow was analyzed by high-speed microscopy and particle tracking of fluorescent beads (<a href=\"#bib51\">Walentek\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2014</a>). Control embryos generated a directional and robust flow along the epidermis, while Morpholino oligonucleotide (MO)-mediated knockdown of <i>cp110</i> caused strongly reduced fluid flow velocities and loss of directionality (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A\u2013B</a>; <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>).

MCCs in control embryos showed directionally uniform and metachronal synchronous ciliary beating, while depletion of Cp110 caused asynchronous beating, reduced motility and randomization of directionality or a complete loss of motility (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013B</a>; <a href=\"#media2\">Videos 2</a>\u2013<a href=\"#media3\">3</a>).

About 95% of targeted MCCs were fully ciliated in controls, but less than 1% of targeted MCCs were fully ciliated in <i>cp110</i> morphants (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>; <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). <i>cp110</i>MO's effects on MCC ciliation were cell-autonomous as non-targeted MCCs showed normal cilia, suggesting that basal body maturation or function was disrupted, rather than signaling or epithelial morphogenesis. While control MCCs showed basal bodies interspersed into a dense Actin network at the apical membrane, apical Actin formation was disrupted in Cp110-deficient MCCs and a large portion of basal bodies remained deep in the cytoplasm, indicating deficient apical transport of basal bodies (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>; <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B\u2013D</a>). Loss of basal body transport is predicted to prevent basal body apical docking, alignment, as well as cilia formation (<a href=\"#bib30\">Marshall, 2008</a>). In order to gain more insight into the primary versus secondary effects of Cp110 loss, we injected embryos with increasing concentrations of <i>cp110</i>MO. These experiments revealed a dose-dependent effect of <i>cp110</i> knockdown (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C\u2013D</a>). At low doses <i>cp110</i>MO caused loss of basal body alignment and mild apical Actin defects, without interfering with basal body apical transport, docking and cilia formation. In contrast, high doses of <i>cp110</i>MO primarily interfered with basal body apical transport and prevented cilia formation. Rescue experiments further confirmed the specificity of the MCC phenotype in <i>cp110</i> morphants (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D\u2013E</a>; <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>): co-injection of MO-insensitive <i>cp110</i> DNA (<i>cp110-fs</i>) restored ciliation rates and partially restored apical basal body localization. As previously described for Cp110 gain-of-function experiments (<a href=\"#bib40\">Song et al., 2014</a>), a more potent <i>cp110</i> DNA from which the <i>miR-34/449</i> target site was removed (<i>cp110-fs</i>\u0394<i>miR34/449</i>) showed higher rescue efficiencies."

GRP cells were more sensitive to <i>gfp-cp110</i> overexpression, possibly because of the limited number of centrioles/basal bodies as compared to MCCs. This led to another interesting observation: GFP-Cp110 basal body levels inversely correlated with GRP cilia length, i.e. high expression levels inhibited cilia, intermediate levels caused shorter cilia, and low levels permitted normal cilia formation (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). This implies that, in contrast to previous reports, Cp110 might play a role in ciliary length control. Our hypothesis was further supported by the observation that Cp110 can localize to ciliary tips in some GRP cells (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>).

In control MCCs, FAK-GFP normally accumulated at basal bodies and rootlets, and this localization was strongly reduced in Cp110-deficient MCCs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Higher magnification revealed residual FAK-GFP levels at basal bodies in <i>cp110</i> morphants (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>), which was further confirmed by analyzing the ratio of fluorescent intensity of FAK-GFP/Centrin4-CFP: on average, FAK-GFP levels were reduced to about 30% in Cp110-deficient MCCs as compared to controls (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>). We also addressed whether other ciliary adhesion components were affected by Cp110 depletion. As with FAK-GFP, both Vinculin-GFP and Paxillin-GFP levels were strongly reduced in <i>cp110</i> morphant basal bodies and rootlets, and Vinculin-GFP was also reduced at the apical membrane (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2A\u2013Ds</a>). Ciliary adhesion components appeared to be more dramatically reduced at rootlets than at basal bodies. To confirm that loss of ciliary adhesions was not primarily caused by a loss of the rootlet, we analyzed FAK-GFP localization in <i>cp110</i> morphants which were triple-injected with <i>centrin4-cfp</i>, the rootlet marker <i>clamp-rfp</i> and <i>FAK-gfp</i>. These experiments confirmed strong reduction of FAK-GFP from basal bodies and rootlets, while Centrin4-CFP and Clamp-RFP were still present, at least in basal bodies residing close to the apical membrane (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). These results are further supported by published mouse data, which demonstrated that Rootletin localizes to Cp110-deficient basal bodies (<a href=\"#bib54\">Yadav et al., 2016</a>), and that Rootlet-deficient basal bodies still form cilia in mono- and multi-ciliated cells (<a href=\"#bib55\">Yang\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2005</a>)."

Indeed, the two opposing roles of Cp110 in cilia formation might be promoted by specific protein domains, interacting with different protein complexes. We first analyzed the <i>Xenopus tropicalis</i> (Xt) Cp110 sequence and found that the deposited reference sequence (matching BC167469) predicted a shorter product than in other species. Compared to the Xt7.1 genome sequences (<a href=\"#bib19\">Hellsten et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Karpinka\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2014</a>), the clone has a frameshift producing a premature stop codon and a truncated Cp110 (Cp110-FS) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). Restoration of the missing Adenine generated a full-length Cp110 version of 962 amino acids, which contains the\u00a0domains described for human Cp110 (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chen et al., 2002</a>) at similar positions, including two coiled-coil domains (CCDs), CDK phosphorylation sites, Cyclin binding domains (RXL) and CaM-binding domains (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). Interestingly, the KEN box motif, which is required for proteasomal targeting of Cp110, is positioned more towards the N-terminus in Xt Cp110 than in human Cp110, which instead contains an additional destruction-box (D box) with the same function at a similar position. Judging from our functional experiments employing <i>cp110-fs</i> and <i>cp110-fs</i>\u0394<i>miR34/449</i> and correction of the sequence, we conclude that (a) Cp110-FS is still largely functional, (b) the <i>miR-34/449</i> target site is located within the wild-type coding sequence, and (c) the domain structure of Cp110 is highly conserved among vertebrates."

Most deletion constructs inhibited cilia formation at similar rates to full-length GFP-Cp110, but not a construct missing both CCDs (GFP-Cp110\u0394CCD1&amp;2), which had very mild effects on cilia (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>; <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013B</a>). CCDs can facilitate intramolecular interactions as well as intermolecular interactions during complex formation (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kuhn et\u00a0al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Burkhard et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Salisbury, 2003</a>). We therefore deleted Cp110 CCDs separately and tested these constructs for cilia inhibition. Deletion of the first CCD alone (GFP-Cp110\u0394CCD1) did not affect cilia inhibition, while deletion of the second CCD (GFP-Cp110\u0394CCD2) only weakly affected cilia suppression (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). This suggested that CCDs overlap in activity. For all constructs, effects were cell-autonomous, and non-targeted MCCs formed cilia comparable to uninjected controls. We conclude from this data, that (a) expression of all deletion constructs results in the\u00a0production of functional protein, which we have confirmed by immunoblotting for GFP-Cp110 constructs at relevant stages (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>), (b) the CCDs of Cp110 inhibit ciliation in a redundant manner, and (c) Cp110 CCDs likely mediate binding to protein complexes at the basal body which support cilia inhibition."

In MCCs, a conserved transcriptional cascade regulates ciliation (<a href=\"#bib10\">Choksi et al., 2014</a>). Notch signaling inhibition activates <i>multicilin (mci</i>; or <i>MCIDAS</i> in humans) (<a href=\"#bib42\">Stubbs et al., 2012</a>). Mci forms a ternary complex with E2F-4 or -5 and Dp1 to activate downstream ciliary transcription factors, including <i>rfx2, foxj1</i> and <i>myb</i> (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chung et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Ma et al., 2014</a>). Together with RFX2 and Foxj1, the Mci complex regulates expression of core multi-ciliogenesis genes. Because Cp110 is indispensable for ciliogenesis, we tested whether its expression is regulated through the MCC transcriptional program. RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed on manipulated animal cap explants that develop into mucociliary organoids in culture (<a href=\"#bib53\">Werner and Mitchell, 2012</a>), and successful manipulation was monitored by assessing expression levels of <i>foxj1</i>. During MCC specification stage (st. 16), inhibition of Notch signaling (<i>su(h)-dbm</i>) or stimulation of multi-ciliogenesis (<i>mci</i>) resulted in strongly increased <i>cp110</i> expression as compared to overactivation of notch signaling (<i>notch-icd</i>) or inhibition of multi-ciliogenesis (<i>dominant-negative- (dn-)mci</i>) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>; <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Furthermore, ciliary transcription factors bind to the <i>cp110</i> locus; Chromatin Immunoprecipitation and DNA-sequencing (ChIP-seq) showed binding of E2F4, RFX2 and Foxj1 to the transcriptional start site of <i>cp110</i>, and additional Foxj1 binding to intronic regions of <i>cp110</i> (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Therefore, Cp110 is a core multi-ciliogenesis protein, which is regulated by ciliary transcription factors in MCCs."

A similar low-level localization of endogenous Cp110 can be also observed in primary cilia of RPE-1 cells (see also Figure 4C in <a href=\"#bib43\">Tanos et al. 2013</a>). Furthermore, we demonstrate that optimal cellular levels of Cp110 are required for cilia formation. The general conclusion that Cp110 is required for ciliogenesis is in line with our previous report (<a href=\"#bib40\">Song et al., 2014</a>) as well as a recent study in mice, in which <i>Cp110</i> was knocked out (<a href=\"#bib54\">Yadav et al., 2016</a>)."

In this work, we provide evidence that, additionally, loss of Cp110 prevents formation of ciliary adhesion complexes, which in turn mediate interactions of basal bodies and rootlets with F-actin in MCCs and thereby promote cilia formation. As previously described for knockdown of <i>FAK</i> (<a href=\"#bib1\">Antoniades et al., 2014</a>), knockdown of <i>cp110</i> exerts dose-dependent effects on basal bodies and cilia in MCCs: At low concentrations, these effects include loss of sub-apical Actin-dependent basal body alignment and mild defects in apical Actin formation, but nonetheless successful ciliogenesis. At high concentrations, basal bodies fail to migrate to the apical membrane, which prevents apical docking, apical Actin formation and ciliogenesis. Conversely, overexpression of <i>cp110</i> leads to increased basal body/rootlet levels of FAK. This indicates that Cp110 is required for ciliary adhesion complex recruitment. It remains to be seen if Cp110 is able to directly interact with FAK or if it requires additional intermediate protein complexes, as seems to be the case for Cp110 interactions with Centrins."

Disruption of F-actin in quail oviduct MCCs prevents apical transport of basal bodies, but eventually basal bodies dock to cytoplasmic membranes and form aberrant intracellular cilia (<a href=\"#bib4\">Boisvieux-Ulrich et al., 1990</a>). Furthermore, ciliary vesicles (CVs) seem to localize apically even in the\u00a0absence of basal body docking in MCCs (<a href=\"#bib31\">Park et al., 2008</a>). Therefore, we propose that apical basal body transport promotes efficient basal body fusion with CVs by facilitating spatial proximity. This interpretation is supported by the finding that about 10% of embryonic fibroblasts were capable of CV fusion and cilia formation in <i>Cp110</i> knockout mice, which should lack Cp110 altogether (<a href=\"#bib54\">Yadav et al., 2016</a>). Alternatively, Cp110 might promote basal body fusion with CVs through independent interactions."

On the one hand, increased Cp110 levels at the base of cilia are correlated with shorter GRP cilia. On the other hand, we observe ciliary tip localization of Cp110 in a subset of GRP cilia. GRP cilia have to be resorbed after LR-asymmetric gene expression is induced, to allow these cells to re-enter the cell cycle and to contribute to other embryonic structures like the somites or the notochord (<a href=\"#bib23\">Komatsu et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Shook et al., 2004</a>). At the GRP, cells ingress from lateral to medial, and cilia with Cp110 at their tips were more frequently found on lateral GRP cells. At ciliary tips, Cp110 may promote axoneme depolymerization via recruitment of Kif24, which was previously shown to interact with Cp110 and to specifically depolymerize centriolar-derived microtubules, but not cytoplasmic microtubule populations (<a href=\"#bib22\">Kobayashi et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Kim et al., 2015</a>)."

CCD-containing proteins are commonly found among centriolar/basal body components, and are thought to regulate pericentriolar material as well as centrioles by acting as a structural lattice and by mediating protein-protein interactions (<a href=\"#bib46\">Tsang and Dynlacht, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Kuhn et\u00a0al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Salisbury, 2003</a>). Deletion of Cp110's CCDs prevents efficient cilia inhibition, and decreases binding to centrioles as well as to the distal basal body, but not to rootlets. Therefore, it will be interesting to further dissect Cp110-binding to basal body-associated protein complexes in the future. Our Cp110 deletion constructs might facilitate such dissection using a proteomics approach, as some of them display opposing functions and localization patterns."

Because Cp110 localizes to both the basal body and tip of rootlets, does Cp110 MO also affect rootlet structure (e.g., length)? In <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1D, E</a>, the localization of ciliary adhesion complex around the basal bodies (possibly the rootlet region) seems to be more dramatically affected than at the basal bodies. Does Cp110 loss lead to overall reduction of CA proteins or preferential disappearance of CA proteins at the tip of rootlet? Triple staining of CA proteins, basal bodies and rootlets may help."

In normal embryos, Cp110 and ciliary adhesion complex levels differ among basal bodies at anterior and posterior aspects. How does this asymmetric distribution correlate with the role of Cp110 in ciliogenesis? Basal bodies with lower Cp110 levels are also likely to have lower levels of ciliary adhesion proteins that contribute to basal body docking to actin, so does docking of these basal bodies with lower Cp110 differ as compared to those with higher Cp110 levels? Also, do cilia that emanate from basal bodies with higher and lower Cp110 levels differ? Does overexpression of Cp110 recruit excess CA proteins to the basal bodies/rootlets?"

They find that CP110 levels are elaborately regulated by the MCC regulatory network. Depletion of CP110 causes a range of phenotypes including loss of cilia, loss of cilia organization, loss of basal body docking and loss of adhesion complex localization. Overexpression of CP110 has previously been reported to cause ciliogenesis defects, but they further these studies by perform domain mapping to determine the functional domains of CP110 responsible for localization and function at the basal body. Additionally, they perform detailed localization studies and find GFP-CP110 localized adjacent to basal bodies towards the rootlet and weakly at the tip of the rootlet. These results are consistent with a potential role in adhesion complex formation which is disrupted in morphants. CP110 is a very interesting protein and this paper suggests novel previously unappreciated functions for it during ciliogenesis. The manuscript contains a large amount of high quality imaging data and is well written. Clearly the loss of CP110 is detrimental to the function of MCCs. The challenge is determining the primary vs. secondary defects associated with CP110 which I think requires a bit more effort. My main concern is that many of the phenotypes might not be directly attributable to CP110 but to any basal body that has failed to dock."

While this claim is consistent with the rootlet polarity (1C) it is a bit concerning as one does not know which rootlets actually contain a cilium, as most probably do not give the observed ciliogenesis phenotype. Since rootlets without cilia or with immotile cilia will likely not be polarized, I suspect that any polarity defect is secondary to ciliogenesis and should be presented as such."

The finding that levels of ciliary adhesion complexes and Cp110 also vary along the axis of polarization is an interesting observation, but at this point we can only speculate about the mechanism of asymmetric distribution as well as about the functional consequences of this asymmetry. It could be related to the mechanism by which tissue-level planar cell polarity signaling (e.g. via Frizzled6 and Vangl1) is transduced to the polarity of basal bodies in MCCs. Vladar and colleagues (2015, Methods in Cell Biology, 127, 37-54) have proposed that in the trachea \u2013 where cilia beat along the proximal-distal axis \u2013 proximally localized Frizzled connects to the \u201cfirst row\u201d of basal bodies via microtubules. This is thought to polarize these basal bodies, which pass this polarity on to the remaining basal bodies within the cell via the apical and sub-apical actin networks. Therefore, the differences in levels of ciliary adhesion complex proteins and Cp110 along this axis might reflect the strength of polarization and mechanical coupling. Such a reasoning is also discussed by Antoniades et al. (2014, Dev Cell 28, 70-80)."

This triple staining revealed that Cp110 overlaps posteriorly with Centrin, while FAK mainly overlaps with and extends Cp110 at the posterior domain. These data thus further support a role for Cp110 in linking ciliary adhesions to the basal body. Ciliary adhesions, in turn, were shown to directly interact with the actin cytoskeleton in MCCs by FRET analysis (Antoniades et al. 2014, Dev Cell 28, 70-80)."
