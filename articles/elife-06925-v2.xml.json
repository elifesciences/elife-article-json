However, the sensitivity and threshold for the activation of BCRs resulting from the stimulation by mechanical forces are unknown. Here, we addressed this question using a double-stranded DNA-based tension gauge tether system serving as a predefined mechanical force gauge ranging from 12 to 56 pN. We observed that IgM-BCR activation is dependent on mechanical forces and exhibits a multi-threshold effect. In contrast, the activation of isotype-switched IgG- or IgE-BCR only requires a low threshold of less than 12 pN, providing an explanation for their rapid activation in response to antigen stimulation. Mechanistically, we found that the cytoplasmic tail of the IgG-BCR heavy chain is both required and sufficient to account for the low mechanical force threshold. These results defined the mechanical force sensitivity and threshold that are required to activate different isotyped BCRs."

However, the sensitivity and threshold for the activation of BCRs resulting from the stimulation by mechanical forces are unknown. Here, we addressed this question using a double-stranded DNA-based tension gauge tether system serving as a predefined mechanical force gauge ranging from 12 to 56 pN. We observed that IgM-BCR activation is dependent on mechanical forces and exhibits a multi-threshold effect. In contrast, the activation of isotype-switched IgG- or IgE-BCR only requires a low threshold of less than 12 pN, providing an explanation for their rapid activation in response to antigen stimulation. Mechanistically, we found that the cytoplasmic tail of the IgG-BCR heavy chain is both required and sufficient to account for the low mechanical force threshold. These results defined the mechanical force sensitivity and threshold that are required to activate different isotyped BCRs."

Wan et al. investigated how the different B cell receptors are activated using a technique involving a DNA-based tension gauge. The experiments show that the activation of IgM-BCRs depends on the amount of mechanical force applied. Low levels of mechanical force only weakly activated the receptors, while higher levels of force resulted in more robust activation."

The next challenge is to understand why the B cell receptors on memory B cells are less dependent on mechanical forces than IgM-BCRs."

The BCR is composed of a membrane-bound immunoglobulin (mIg) and a non-covalently associated heterodimer of Ig\u03b1 and Ig\u03b2 in a 1 mIg: 1 Ig\u03b1\u2013Ig\u03b2 heterodimer stoichiometry (<a href=\"#bib54\">Schamel and Reth, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Tolar et al., 2005</a>). BCRs are distinguished from other types of receptors by their ability to recognize a wide range of antigen molecules. In addition to the BCR's ability to recognize antigen diversity, the activation of BCR signaling is also efficiently regulated by the presentation of variable forms of antigens. These forms include antigen density (<a href=\"#bib22\">Fleire et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Liu et al., 2010a</a>), antigen affinity (<a href=\"#bib22\">Fleire et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Liu et al., 2010a</a>), antigen valency (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bachmann et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Liu et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Liu and Chen, 2005</a>), the Brownian mobility feature of the antigen (<a href=\"#bib67\">Wan and Liu, 2012</a>), and the stiffness feature of the substrates presenting the antigen (<a href=\"#bib68\">Wan et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Zeng et al., 2015</a>). All these results suggest that the BCR is an extraordinary receptor which can efficiently discriminate the chemical and physical features of an antigen ligand."

However, chemical cues are not the only type of external information that is delivered to the BCRs by antigens. In fact, physical cues are another layer of important information derived from the antigens for the purposes of regulating B cell activation and subsequent responses (<a href=\"#bib34\">Liu et al., 2015</a>). For example, a recent study by Tolar and his colleagues demonstrated that B cells used the mechanical forces to rupture the bonds between BCRs and membrane-bound antigens. The authors found that only the high affinity BCR and antigen microclusters would be internalized for antigen processing, giving a new mechanism to explain B cell affinity discrimination (<a href=\"#bib48\">Natkanski et al., 2013</a>). Physiologically, the physical cues can also come from the stiffness of the substrates presenting the antigens. Stiffness usually describes the extent that an object can resist deformation in response to an applied force. Stiffness is quantified by Young's modulus with a measurable unit of Pascal (Pa or N/m<sup>2</sup> or m<sup>\u22121</sup>\u00b7kg\u00b7s<sup>\u22122</sup>) (<a href=\"#bib15\">Discher et al., 2005</a>). B cells could encounter the antigens presented on substrates with various levels of stiffness in vivo (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bachmann and Jennings, 2010</a>). For example, viral capsid substrates presenting antigen exhibited a high degree of stiffness (45,000\u20131,000,000 kPa) (<a href=\"#bib43\">Mateu, 2012</a>), while substrates presenting antigen on the membrane of the host cell infected by virus showed a medium level of stiffness (0.01\u20131000 kPa) (<a href=\"#bib49\">Nemir and West, 2010</a>). Additionally, B cells can also efficiently acquire antigens that are associated with extracellular matrix (ECM) in the tissue (<a href=\"#bib13\">Ciechomska et al., 2014</a>), which is well documented to exhibit an extraordinary range of stiffness from 0.012 to 20 kPa (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bao and Suresh, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Engler et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Paszek et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Nemir and West, 2010</a>). Soluble antigen in plasma has also been detected and displayed a remarkably low level of stiffness (several Pa) (<a href=\"#bib4\">Araujo Gde et al., 2012</a>). More recently, Kam and his colleagues quantified the traction forces between T cell receptors (TCRs) and the pillar substrates presenting antigens (<a href=\"#bib9\">Bashour et al., 2014</a>). Indeed, significant shape changes of the substrates were observed due to the bending of the pillars by TCRs after TCR and antigen recognition (<a href=\"#bib9\">Bashour et al., 2014</a>). Since stiffer substrates are known to be more resistant to shape changes (<a href=\"#bib62\">Trappmann et al., 2012</a>), it is reasonable to expect that antigens presented on stiffer or softer substrates will inevitably produce and deliver different mechanical forces to the BCRs. Indeed, our recent study showed that the activation of a B cell is very sensitive to the stiffness of the substrates presenting the antigens (<a href=\"#bib68\">Wan et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Zeng et al., 2015</a>)."

                        "text": "Thus, all these studies suggest that physical cues, such as mechanical force, comprise important external information delivered to the BCRs by antigens for the purposes of regulating B cell activation and subsequent responses. However, the mechanism regulating the strength of the BCR activation in response to mechanical forces that are delivered to the BCR by the antigens on the grounding substrates remains unknown (<a href=\"#bib51\">Pierce and Liu, 2010</a>). There are several important questions which need to be addressed. First of all, does the BCR itself have mechanosensing capability, or do B cells perform mechanosensing through the conventional mechanosensors such as lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA-1) (<a href=\"#bib12\">Chen et al., 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib11\">2012</a>). Second, is there a threshold for BCR activation from the mechanical forces that are delivered to the BCR by the antigen? Third, how sensitive will the BCR be toward different mechanical forces above that threshold in the initiation of BCR activation? Fourth, B cells use different isotypes of BCRs to recognize antigens and initiate transmembrane activation signaling (<a href=\"#bib45\">McHeyzer-Williams and McHeyzer-Williams, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Pierce and Liu, 2010</a>). Mature naive B cells use IgM-BCRs, while memory B cells mainly use IgG-BCRs along with a small fraction that use IgE-BCRs. We do not know how IgM-BCRs expressed by naive B cells and IgG-BCRs (or IgE-BCRs) expressed by memory B cells show differences in terms of the sensitivity and threshold toward mechanical forces in their activation."

                        "text": "A major obstacle to answer all of these questions is that it is technically challenging to set up an experimental system with predefined mechanical forces between BCR and antigen, which shall then be linked to an assay to accurately measure BCR activation. This is especially challenging since it is known that BCR activation may begin seconds after the recognition of the BCR and the antigen (<a href=\"#bib51\">Pierce and Liu, 2010</a>). To overcome these technical difficulties, we took advantage of a platform utilizing a dsDNA-based tension gauge tether (TGT) that was recently developed by Ha and his colleagues (<a href=\"#bib69\">Wang and Ha, 2013</a>). DNA is an excellent molecule showing force application geometry that has been accurately calculated and validated by in vitro single molecule force measurements (<a href=\"#bib1\">Albrecht et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Lang et al., 2004</a>). Ha and his colleagues used these TGT sensors to probe the tension on a single integrin\u2013ECM ligand (cyclic RGDfK) bond required for cell adhesion. Here, we modified this TGT system by conjugating the B1-8 BCR-specific antigen, 4-Hydroxy-3-nitrophenylacetyl (NP), to the ligand chain of the TGT system (NP-TGT). By doing so, we acquired a series of 8 TGT sensors with predefined mechanical force of 12, 16, 23, 33, 43, 50, 54, and 56 pN respectively. We analyzed the activation of BCRs in response to these TGT molecules using high resolution high speed live cell imaging techniques via total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM). This allowed us to determine the sensitivity and threshold for the mechanical force signal in the activation of IgM-BCR or isotype-switched IgG-BCR and IgE-BCR."

                                "text": "To further our understanding of how mechanical forces influence BCR activation, we constructed the NP-TGT sensors by modifying a dsDNA-based TGT system (<a href=\"#bib69\">Wang and Ha, 2013</a>). Each NP-TGT molecule is composed of two single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) molecules with different modifications (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>). The first ssDNA molecule is biotin-conjugated at different positions to provide a defined range of rupture force anchoring positions as illustrated in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>. In the original version of the TGT system utilized by Ha and his colleagues (<a href=\"#bib69\">Wang and Ha, 2013</a>), the second ssDNA molecule was conjugated with a well-characterized integrin ligand, cyclic RGDfk peptide, to provide an integrin binding site for quantifying the mechanical force spectrum (12, 16, 23, 33, 43, 50, 54, and 56 pN) in the activation of integrin molecules. As stated by the authors (<a href=\"#bib69\">Wang and Ha, 2013</a>), TGT molecules with modifications can provide an experimental system for the study of many other types of receptors. Here, we conjugated the B1-8-BCR-specific antigen, NP, to the second ssDNA molecule (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Since we just exchanged the cyclic RGDfk peptide with the NP hapten antigen and did not change the sequence and design of these dsDNA-based TGT sensors, our NP-TGT system shall have the same tension gauge scales as the one used by Ha and his colleagues (<a href=\"#bib69\">Wang and Ha, 2013</a>). In our experimental system, each NP-TGT molecule can be recognized by the B1-8-IgM-BCRs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Thus, the NP-TGT sensor that is immobilized on the surface of coverslip would be ruptured if the mechanical force applied by the B1-8-IgM-BCR is larger than the predefined tension force of a certain NP-TGT sensor. A key feature of dsDNA-based mechanical force sensor is that the specific force value of each sensor is not an absolute value but presents a distribution with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 5 pN for unzipping rupture mode and 15 pN for shearing rupture mode (<a href=\"#bib32\">Lang et al., 2004</a>). So, precisely, the actual range of any given NP-TGT sensor represents a distribution with the most possible value of rupture force at 12, 16, 23, 33, 43, 50, 54, and 56 pN, respectively."

To check it, we examine the NP-TGT-triggered responses of primary mature naive B cells from wild-type C57BL/6 mice, which do not express NP-specific B1-8-IgM-BCRs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). These primary B cells did not accumulate BCRs into the B cell IS in response to coverslip presenting NP-TGT sensor compared to the case of coverslip alone, although a dramatic accumulation was readily observed in the case of encountering coverslip that was coated with anti-mouse IgM surrogate antigens as a positive control (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). The B cell activation is known to be very sensitive to the density of antigen on the surface of the antigen-presenting substrates (<a href=\"#bib22\">Fleire et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Liu et al., 2010a</a>). To exclude such a variant, we then used NP-specific antibodies to quantify the density of each NP-TGT sensor (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). Thus, we established the B1-8-BCR-specific NP-TGT sensor system which showed a predefined mean mechanical force gauge ranging from 12 to 56 pN."

Numerous early studies showed that after BCR-antigen recognition, B cells immediately begin to spread over the antigen-containing surfaces to form the B cell IS and attempt to acquire the antigens by actively accumulating BCRs and antigens into the B cell IS (<a href=\"#bib22\">Fleire et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Liu et al., 2010a</a>, <a href=\"#bib39\">2010b</a>, <a href=\"#bib41\">2010c</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Seeley-Fallen et al., 2014</a>). Thus, we first examined the B cell spreading response and the concomitant accumulation of BCRs into the B cell IS by TIRFM imaging using J558L cells expressing B1-8-IgM-BCR in NP-TGT-based experimental system (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). The results suggested that NP-TGT sensors with higher mechanical force generally triggered more aggressive spreading response and enhanced BCR synaptic accumulation than NP-TGT molecules with lower mechanical force (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A\u2013C</a>). More strikingly, a careful examination of the response of B cells toward these series of NP-TGT sensors with mechanical forces ranging from 12 to 56 pN suggested that there are three levels of thresholds. The low-force (12\u201316 pN) NP-TGT sensors triggered a weak activation, whereas the middle-force (23\u201343 pN) NP-TGT sensors initiated a medium-level activation, and the high-force (50\u201356 pN) NP-TGT sensors accounted for a strong activation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). This unique pattern of the dependence on mechanical forces suggested that IgM-BCR activation exhibits a multi-threshold effect. Specifically, an increase of the mechanical force from one threshold to another threshold dramatically enhanced the activation of the naive IgM-BCRs. However, within these three threshold barriers, increasing the mechanical force, such as from 23 pN to 33 pN or to 43 pN (the medium level threshold), will not result in dramatically enhanced activation responses of IgM-BCRs."

Furthermore, we were concerned that the density of the NP-TGT sensors on coverslip might affect the pattern of the activation response of the naive IgM-BCRs. Thus, we quantified the density (number of molecules/\u00b5m<sup>2</sup>) of NP-TGT sensors on the coverslip, which was coated with different incubation concentration (2, 5, 10, 50 nM) of NP-TGT sensor (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B\u2013E</a>) following a published protocol (<a href=\"#bib38\">Liu et al., 2010a</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Wang and Ha, 2013</a>). At the density of 4.0 NP-TGT molecule/\u00b5m<sup>2</sup> (5 nM incubation concentration), we can capture the same pattern of the activation response of IgM-BCRs (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1F,G</a>). At the very low density of 0.3 NP-TGT molecule/\u00b5m<sup>2</sup> (2 nM incubation concentration), we found that only 56 pN NP-TGT sensor can very mildly trigger the BCR accumulation, while both 12 pN and 43 pN NP-TGT failed to trigger B cell activation (data not shown), suggesting that we cannot use the incubation concentration of 2 nM for these experiments. Thus, it is clear that the activation of the IgM-BCR is extremely sensitive to the changes in mechanical forces exceeding the thresholds such as the increase in the forces from 12 pN to 23 pN instead of 16 pN, or from 23 pN to 56 pN instead of 43 pN.

As expected, we found that the synaptic accumulation of the BCRs in the entire 10-min time lapse was dependent on mechanical forces with high-force NP-TGT sensor (56 pN) exhibiting the highest accumulation, medium force NP-TGT sensor (43 pN) showed medium-level accumulation, and low-force NP-TGT sensor (12 pN) had the lowest level of accumulation, consistent with the results from the above mentioned end point experiments.

We thus assessed the volume of the BCR microclusters produced by the series of NP-TGT sensors by quantifying the fluorescence intensity (FI) of each individual BCR microcluster. We mathematically fitted each BCR microcluster using a 2D Gaussian function as reported earlier (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Source code 1</a>) (<a href=\"#bib38\">Liu et al., 2010a</a>). We similarly observed that the volume of the BCR microclusters is dependent on the strength of the mechanical force with 56 pN NP-TGT sensors producing much bigger and brighter BCR microclusters than 43 pN and 12 pN NP-TGT molecules (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>). The multi-threshold effect was also observed when we analyzed the volume of the generated BCR microclusters. NP-TGT molecules with low mean rupture force (12\u201316 pN) triggered the formation of small BCR microclusters, whereas NP-TGT sensors with medium mean rupture force (23\u201343 pN) initiated medium-level volume BCR microclusters, and NP-TGT molecules with high mean rupture force (50\u201356 pN) accounted for bigger and brighter BCR microclusters (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>). Thus, the volume of the IgM-BCR microcluster produced by different NP-TGT sensors is dependent on mechanical forces and exhibits a similar multi-threshold effect."

All of these signaling molecules play essential roles in the transmembrane signaling transduction of BCR. For example, Syk binds to the phosphorylated Immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) on the cytoplasmic tail of Ig\u03b1 and Ig\u03b2, and subsequently Syk will undergo auto-phosphorylation at multiple tyrosine sites within its linker regions to be converted to a signaling active form (<a href=\"#bib53\">Saouaf et al., 1994</a>). The phosphorylated Syk also provides docking sites for PLC\u03b32 (<a href=\"#bib70\">Weber et al., 2008</a>). We found that the membrane proximal recruitment of each of these signaling molecules is dependent on mechanical forces with the 56 pN NP-TGT sensors showing the highest recruitment, while the 43 pN NP-TGT sensors had a medium level of recruitment and the 12 pN NP-TGT sensors had the lowest level of recruitment (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013C</a>), consistent with the results from the above mentioned experiments quantifying the synaptic accumulation of the BCR molecules (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>).

To address this question, we co-tethered both NP-TGT sensors and the adhesion molecule, intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1, which is a ligand for integrin LFA-1) on the surface of coverslip and similarly performed TIRFM imaging experiments. The addition of ICAM-1 dramatically enhanced the synaptic accumulation of the BCRs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>), suggesting the increased sensitivity to antigen stimulation in the initiation of B cell activation, consistent with the published studies in both the BCR (<a href=\"#bib10\">Carrasco et al., 2004</a>) and TCR system (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bachmann et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Dustin, 2009</a>). However, it was clear that the outside-in activation of integrin did not change the fact that B cell activation is dependent on mechanical forces with a similar multi-threshold effect (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). To further confirm this conclusion, we inactivated the function of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), a member of the non-receptor protein-tyrosine kinase family, that is known to play a key role in the activation of integrin signaling pathways (<a href=\"#bib57\">Slack-Davis et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Yu et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Bashour et al., 2014</a>). We pretreated B cells with FAK-specific inhibitor PF573-228 (<a href=\"#bib57\">Slack-Davis et al., 2007</a>). We found that the pretreated B cells still maintained the general patterned dependence on mechanical forces with a multi-threshold effect (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,D</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). However, it was clear that the high-end (56 pN) and medium-level (43 pN) but not low-end (12 pN) mechanical force threshold was more influenced by the inactivation of integrin, suggesting that the breakthroughs of the medium-level and high-end threshold of mechanical forces are partially supported by the inside-out activation of integrin."

There are recent studies showing that B cells utilize the contraction forces generated by myosin IIA to rupture the interaction between the BCR and antigen molecules (<a href=\"#bib48\">Natkanski et al., 2013</a>), while dynein is required for the retrograde motile feature of the BCR microclusters into the center of B cell IS (<a href=\"#bib55\">Schnyder et al., 2011</a>). Thus, we assessed the contribution of these two motor proteins to the patterned dependence on mechanical forces during IgM-BCR activation. Unexpectedly, the inactivation of myosin IIA did not dramatically change the dependence on mechanical forces, however we observed a significant drop in the strength of the synaptic accumulation of the BCRs for the high threshold NP-TGT sensor at 56 pN only, and no drop was observed for the medium-level threshold NP-TGT sensor at 43 pN, nor the low threshold NP-TGT sensor at 12 pN (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E,F</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>).

                                "text": "B cells use different isotypes of BCRs to recognize antigens and to initiate transmembrane activation signaling. Mature naive B cells use IgM-BCRs (termed naive IgM-BCR thereafter), while memory B cells mainly use IgG-BCRs (termed memory IgG-BCR thereafter) with a fraction of these use IgE-BCRs (termed memory IgE-BCR thereafter). Memory B cells are responsible for the rapid antigen recall humoral responses upon vaccine immunization (<a href=\"#bib45\">McHeyzer-Williams and McHeyzer-Williams, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Pierce and Liu, 2010</a>). Here, we explore the sensitivities and thresholds toward mechanical forces in the activation of memory B cells expressing isotype-switched IgG-BCRs or IgE-BCRs. We addressed this question using J558L cells expressing memory B1-8-IgG-BCR in the same experimental system that has been used for the naive B1-8-IgM-BCR-expressing J558L cells as described in detail above. Surprisingly, we observed a totally different pattern in terms of the dependence on mechanical forces for the activation of memory IgG-BCRs. Each of the three NP-TGT sensors producing mechanical forces at 12, 43, or 56 pN similarly drove the cells to undergo spreading responses and the synaptic accumulation of BCRs or pSyk signaling molecules into the IS (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A\u2013D</a>). This suggested that the activation of memory IgG-BCRs requires either no tension or a mechanical force below the mean rupture force of the lowest-force NP-TGT we used (12 pN). Similar patterned activation of memory IgG-BCR was observed at different surface density of NP-TGT sensors on coverslip (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013C</a>). Furthermore, a similar phenomenon was observed when examining the activation of B1-8 primary B cells expressing memory IgG-BCRs that were derived from an in vitro class-switch response following our published protocol (<a href=\"#bib39\">Liu et al., 2010b</a>) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E,F</a>). We also used high speed TIRFM imaging to test the dynamics of memory IgG-BCR accumulation into the B cell IS starting with the initial immune recognition of memory IgG-BCRs with 12 pN, 56 pN and NP non-conjugated control TGT molecules within a 13-min time course (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G,H</a>, <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>). It was clear that 12 pN and 56 pN NP-TGT molecules similarly drove the accumulation of BCRs into the B cell IS. All of these results show that the activation of the memory IgG-BCR is independent on mechanical forces ranging from 12 to 56 pN as tested in our NP-TGT experimental system."

This question is especially intriguing as both memory IgG-BCR and naive IgM-BCR use the exact same BCR component, the Ig\u03b1 and Ig\u03b2 heterodimer, to initiate BCR signaling. In contrast, the mIgG and the mIgM are the BCR components to recognize the antigens (<a href=\"#bib54\">Schamel and Reth, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Tolar et al., 2005</a>). In addition to the constant region of the Ig, mIgG and mIgM also differ greatly in their cytoplasmic domain. In fact, mIgM has only three-amino acids in its cytoplasmic tail (KVK), while all mIgG subtypes have 28-amino acid cytoplasmic tails, which are extremely conserved across species (<a href=\"#bib52\">Reth, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Tarlinton, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Liu et al., 2010a</a>, <a href=\"#bib36\">2012b</a>). Early mice model studies utilizing biochemical assays and live cell imaging demonstrated that the cytoplasmic tail of mIgG is both necessary and sufficient to confer an enhanced activation of IgG-BCR expressing memory B cells compared to the case of IgM-BCR expressing naive B cells (<a href=\"#bib29\">Kaisho et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Martin and Goodnow, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Wakabayashi et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Horikawa et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Waisman et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Engels et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Liu et al., 2010b</a>, <a href=\"#bib36\">2012b</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Engels et al., 2014</a>). To examine the contribution of the cytoplasmic tail of mIgG in the low mechanical force threshold for the activation of the memory IgG-BCR, we took advantage of the four types of J558L cells expressing naive B1-8-IgM-BCR and memory B1-8-IgG-BCR with cytoplasmic tail swapped forms as reported in our previous study (<a href=\"#bib39\">Liu et al., 2010b</a>): (1) memory B1-8-IgG-BCR; (2) mIgG swapped with a mIgM cytoplasmic tail (memory B1-8-IgG-BCR equipped with a mIgM cytoplasmic tail, termed GGM thereafter); (3) naive B1-8-IgM-BCR; (4) mIgM swapped with a mIgG cytoplasmic tail (naive B1-8-IgM-BCR equipped with a mIgG cytoplasmic tail, termed MMG thereafter) (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). We found that the J558L cells expressing GGM showed the force dependent activation by accumulating more BCRs and pSyk into the IS with the higher mean rupture force NP-TGT molecules, similar to the case of J558L cells expressing naive B1-8-IgM-BCR (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B\u2013D</a>). In contrast, it was apparent that the J558L cells expressing MMG behaved similarly to the case of J558L cells expressing memory B1-8-IgG-BCR in a force-independent manner (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E\u2013G</a>). All of these results suggested that the lower mechanical force threshold of memory IgG-BCR activation depends on its cytoplasmic tail."

The use of these NP-TGT molecules in combination with the high resolution high speed live cell imaging technique through TIRFM allows us to investigate several intriguing questions: (1) Does the BCR itself possess any mechanosensing properties?

Since such a patterned dependence on mechanical force in the initiation of IgM-BCR does not strictly rely on integrin or adhesion molecule, we propose that IgM-BCR alone could function as a mechanosensor. The performance of IgM-BCRs in TGT-based mechanical force experimental system is mostly consistent with the reported findings on integrin molecules (<a href=\"#bib69\">Wang and Ha, 2013</a>). However IgM-BCR and integrin also exhibit some obvious differences in their respective responding pattern to the same mechanical force spectrum (12 pN\u201356 pN) produced by TGT sensors."

Though, it is a fact that the strength of such activation produced by 12 pN NP-TGT sensor is dramatically weaker than those produced by other NP-TGT molecules bearing higher force (such as 56 pN NP-TGT). In contrast, integrin does not seem to get activated under 12 pN or even 16 pN TGTs (<a href=\"#bib69\">Wang and Ha, 2013</a>). These results suggested that the initiation of BCR signaling could be extremely sensitive to mechanical forces. BCR might rely on such fine sensitivity to initiate its signaling cascade during the surveillance for non-self-antigens that could be of very low density. Subsequently, those initially weak signals could be further boosted by other well-characterized mechanisms through activating co-receptors (such as CD19) (<a href=\"#bib14\">Depoil et al., 2008</a>) or co-stimulatory factors (such as LFA-1) (<a href=\"#bib59\">Spaargaren et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Carrasco et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">McLeod et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Dustin et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Tseng et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Arana et al., 2008a</a>, <a href=\"#bib3\">2008b</a>)."

The low-force 12\u201316 pN NP-TGT sensors triggered a weak activation, whereas the middle-force 23\u201343 pN NP-TGT sensors initiated a medium-level activation, and the high-force 50\u201356 pN NP-TGT sensors accounted for a strong activation. Within these three thresholds, there is a quite obvious barrier effect as an increase in mechanical force, such as from 23 pN to 33 pN or to 43 pN within the medium-level mechanical force barrier, will not result in any dramatically enhanced activation responses of IgM-BCRs. Instead, the activation of IgM-BCR is extremely sensitive to the changes of mechanical forces exceeding these barriers, such as the increase of the mechanical force from 12 pN to 43 pN or from 43 pN to 56 pN. We speculate that these observations might reflect some key features of dsDNA-derived mechanical force sensor that each sensor represents a distribution of force value with an FWHM of 5 pN for unzipping rupture mode and 15 pN for shearing rupture mode (<a href=\"#bib32\">Lang et al., 2004</a>). Thus, the actual rupture force of any given TGT sensor shall not be viewed as a fixed value, but rather a distribution with \u2018shoulder overlap\u2019 to the nearby TGT sensors. We also speculate that these findings would potentially deliver key meanings with biological significance. Different from many other receptors, IgM-BCR composes a mIgM and a heterodimer of Ig\u03b1 and Ig\u03b2 in a 1 mIg: 1 Ig\u03b1\u2013Ig\u03b2 stoichiometry with mIgM, the biosensor for antigens, and Ig\u03b1\u2013Ig\u03b2 heterodimer, the BCR signaling initiator (<a href=\"#bib54\">Schamel and Reth, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Tolar et al., 2005</a>). The antigenic signal needs to be delivered from the antigen binding region on the extracellular domain of mIgM to the signaling active ITAM on the cytoplasmic domain of both Ig\u03b1 and Ig\u03b2. It is still a big open question in terms of the molecular mechanism of how exactly BCR transduces physical and chemical signals. Here, we tried to interpret our data in a way that such multi-threshold effect of the activation of IgM-BCRs reflects the multi-threshold progress of delivering these mechanical forces induced potential conformational changes from mIgM to Ig\u03b1 and Ig\u03b2 heterodimer complex. It is also our speculation that such multi-threshold likely provides a chance for the proof-testing of the mechanical forces applied to IgM-BCR during its activation. All these speculations are under our further extensive investigation."

This especially intrigues a question when considering the recent study by Zhu and his colleagues (<a href=\"#bib33\">Liu et al., 2014</a>), showing that the mechanical force prolongs lifetime of catch bond between TCR and agonist pMHC, but decreases the lifetime of slip bond between TCR and antagonist pMHC antigen. The authors showed that both the value of the force and the lifetime of the force are important factors in TCR activation. The situation with BCR shall be more complicated as different from TCR, BCR is a bivalent binding receptor, stating that one BCR can bind to two NP-TGT molecules. Additionally, the recent advance of the super-resolution imaging studies demonstrated that BCRs form obvious nanoclusters with 20\u201350 IgM-BCRs per nanocluster on quiescent B cells (<a href=\"#bib44\">Mattila et al., 2013</a>). All these features of BCR demonstrated the high possibility of multivalent bonds based mechanical forces in regulating the initiation of B cell activation. Additionally, Tolar and his colleagues recently used AFM to examine the rupture forces between B1-8-IgM-BCR and NP antigen (<a href=\"#bib48\">Natkanski et al., 2013</a>).

Rupture force measuring systems using AFM-based vs magnetic tweezers-based approaches show many differences including but not limited to different spring constants, different loading rate and different time under load (<a href=\"#bib1\">Albrecht et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Lang et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Hatch et al., 2008</a>). Thus, all these differences prevented the feasibility of a direct comparison of the mechanical force value that is acquired from different kind of measurements (constant force vs constant loading). From this point of view, it would be of great importance to use the constant force measurements to examine the interaction of B1-8-BCR with NP antigen, and to investigate how the magnitude and duration of mechanical forces will influence B cell activation. During the measurement, the time of the force under load shall be carefully picked up because it is known that such a parameter greatly influence the measured value of the rupture forces (<a href=\"#bib32\">Lang et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Natkanski et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Wang and Ha, 2013</a>).

The source accounting for the applied force would be quite diverse in a live cell. In the case of BCR, motor proteins including myosin IIA and dynein molecules are known to be the mechanical force provider. Myosin IIA executes the vertical forces to BCR microclusters to rupture the bonds between BCRs and membrane-bound antigens, and such event is used by B cells to discriminate antigen affinity (<a href=\"#bib48\">Natkanski et al., 2013</a>). Dynein is shown to be required for the retrograde motile feature of BCR microclusters into the center of the B cell IS, suggesting dynein would more likely execute a lateral force (<a href=\"#bib55\">Schnyder et al., 2011</a>). We assessed the contribution of myosin IIA and dynein in the patterned dependence on mechanical forces of IgM-BCR activation. Unexpectedly, the inactivation of either myosin IIA or dynein did not dramatically changed the patterned dependence on mechanical forces in IgM-BCR activation, suggesting the formation of the basic barrier for the patterned multi-threshold effect does not strictly reply on myosin IIA or dynein. However, in primary naive B cells expressing B1-8-IgM-BCR expressing B cells with inactivated myosin IIA, we observed a significantly decreased accumulation of BCR in response to high-end 56 pN NP-TGT sensor only, and such drop was not observed in the case of medium-level threshold 43 pN NP-TGT sensor or low-end 12 pN NP-TGT sensor. No such drop was observed in each of these multi-threshold NP-TGT molecules after inactivating dynein. All these data drive us to speculate that the breakthrough of the high-end but not the medium-level or low-end mechanical force threshold might be contributed by myosin IIA. In contrast, dynein does not seem to play an obvious role in the establishment of the barriers of mechanical forces."

We speculate from these data that the breakthrough of the high-end and medium-level threshold but not low-end mechanical force barriers might be contributed by the inside-out activation of integrin. This is in consistent with the role of myosin IIA as discussed above. Myosin IIA bound actin filaments are physically connected with integrin through the key focal adhesion molecules talin and vinculin and was shown to be important for the function of TCR microclusters (<a href=\"#bib28\">Ilani et al., 2009</a>).

All these results highlighted the significant low-force requirement to initiate the activation of IgG-BCR or IgE-BCR that are expressed on memory B cells compared to the case of IgM-BCR on mature naive B cells, implicating a new possible mechanism to explain the rapid and high-titered IgG antibody responses upon re-encounter with antigen of memory B cells. It is worth noting that the recent study by Ha and his colleagues showed that the activation of Notch receptor also requires either no tension or a single molecule force smaller than 12 pN (<a href=\"#bib69\">Wang and Ha, 2013</a>). It is of great interest to address the underlying fundamental mechanism of the different mechanical force requirements for different receptors. In this report, we investigated which domain of mIgG resulted in the low or none requirements on mechanical forces for IgG-BCRs compared to the case of IgM-BCRs since both of these two forms of BCRs use the same signaling initiation component, Ig\u03b1 and Ig\u03b2 heterodimer. By a systemic swap experiment we demonstrated that the lower threshold on mechanical forces of memory IgG-BCR activation is dependent on its cytoplasmic tail. At this moment, we are addressing the question of why an evolutionarily conserved cytoplasmic tail confers such low threshold on mechanical forces for the activation of memory IgG-BCR. We hypothesize that the cytoplasmic tail of mIgG (or mIgE) might have some capabilities to facilitate the conformational changes of the \u2018umbrella-opening like\u2019 cytoplasmic domain of Ig\u03b1 and Ig\u03b2 complex during the transmembrane signaling transduction of BCR activation (<a href=\"#bib61\">Tolar et al., 2005</a>)."

In brief, biotin liposomes were prepared by sonication of 1,2-Dioleoyl-sn-Glycero-3-phosphocholine and 1,2-Dioleoyl- sn-Glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-cap-biotin (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL) in a 25:1 molar ratio in PBS at a lipid concentration of 2.5 mM. The PLBs were prepared in 8-well chambers (Nunc Lab-Tek) with the coverslip cleaned by nanostrip buffer. The coverslip was incubated with 0.1 mM biotin liposomes in PBS for 20 min at room temperature. After washing with 10 ml PBS, the PLB was incubated with 40 nM streptavidin for 15 min and excessive streptavidin was washed away with 10 ml PBS. And then the streptavidin-containing PLBs were incubated with 30 nM biotinylated, NP8-BSA (pre-mixed Alexa488-conjugated NP8-BSA with non-fluorescent conjugated NP8-BSA at 1:10 molar ratio) for 15 min. After washing, PLBs were blocked with 1% (wt/vol) Casein in PBS for 30 min at 37\u00b0C and washed thoroughly for further use."

One strand of the duplex is attached to the substrate and the other strand has a hapten that is recognized by an IgM or IgG on the surface of a live B cell. The duplexes are claimed to be calibrated to dissociate to single strands with application of forces exceeding a threshold in the range of 12-56 pN, which is a biologically relevant range. When dissociation takes place the strand with the hapten would go with the BCR, but because the engagement is monovalent it would likely lose any ability to hold the receptor in the interface or stimulate signaling. The authors follow accumulation of BCR in the interface and recruitment of phosphorylated signaling molecules that associate with the BCR. They find that IgM generates a continuum of responses across the range of force thresholds, whereas IgG activates similarly across the entire spectrum. They show that this difference in sensitivity to the linker is encoded by the short cytoplasmic domains of IgM and IgG heavy chains based on analysis of chimeric receptors. The paper contains important quantitative new insights into mechanisms of B cell receptor signaling and the effects of heavy chain isotype on this process, but a number of issues must be resolved before the work is suitable for publication in <i>eLife</i>:"

This is about as much force as is needed to separate the weakest tethers in this manuscript, and much less than the separation forces of the tethers at the two thresholds for B cell spreading (23 pN and 50 pN). The two thresholds correspond to approximately two times and four times the rupture force of the single NP-B1-8 bond, raising a possibility that the separation somehow depends on multivalent bonds.

We provide the positive control experiments for each inhibitor to show that these inhibitors are working in pretreated B cells (please refer to <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2013figure supplement 1A-C</a>). We agree with the reviewers on the importance of evaluating through confocal microscopy the internalization of BCR and antigen molecules after B cell activation. All these experiments can better help us understand the mechanisms of the different response of B1-8-BCRs when encountering the mechanical forces from NP-TGT sensors. We performed these experiments and the results showed that there is no obvious internalization of BCRs in case of each of these three NP-TGT sensors (12, 43 and 56 pN, see <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2013figure supplement 2A-C</a>). We did not detect obvious internalization events at time point of 10 min after the immune recognition of B1-8-BCR and NP-TGT (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2013figure supplement 2A-C</a>). We picked up a time point of 10 min to examine the efficiency of internalization as we used 10 min as an end point to compare the different activation of B cells when encountering NP-TGT sensors providing low-, middle- or high-forces in our original and revised manuscript. All these experiments demonstrated that the different levels of the synaptic accumulation of BCRs are mainly induced by the different mechanical forces applied to BCRs through NP-TGT sensor, rather than induced by the antigen acquisition and the subsequent internalization events. To further confirm this statement, we pretreated B cells with monodansylcadaverine (MDC), which is an inhibitor to block internalization (Tolar P, et al., Nature Immunology, 2005, 6:1168-76; Chaturvedi A, et al., Immunity, 2008, 28:799-809; Liu W, et al., The Journal of Experimental Medicine, 2010, 207:1095-111). We found the activation of the pretreated B cells still maintained the sensitivity to the mechanical forces and exhibited the multi-threshold effect (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2013figure supplement 2D-F</a>). Thus, all these new data showed that, regarding \u201cthe issue of antigen harvesting from the surface vs. mechanotransduction by the receptor<i>\u201d</i>, mechanical force mainly drives the different response in the initiation of B cell activation."

Fleire et al. can only examine and quantify the efficiency of the internalization of antigen at an end point as early as 2 hrs after placing the B cells on PLBs containing different densities of antigen (20, 100, and 200 molec/\u00b5m<sup>2</sup>) (Science, 2006, 312:738-41). Both of these studies indicate that B cells can only efficiently internalize BCRs and antigens on softer substrates (like PMS) in short period of incubation time (20 min) or on stiffer substrates but with very long incubation time (2 hrs). In our experimental condition (10 min reaction time and the highest density of the antigen at 29 molec/\u00b5m<sup>2</sup> on stiff coverslip), it is not a surprise that internalization would only occur at a very low efficiency."

When revising the manuscript, we chose the second approach to re-address the internalization question. However we found that it is technically difficult to accurately stain the NP-TGT sensors by NP-specific antibodies at the interface between the B cells and coverslip presenting high-force NP-TGT (this interface was termed as B cell IS thereafter). In our tests, we performed the standard protocol to stain NP-TGT sensors in permeabilized B cells following the published studies of ours and those of others (Vascotto F, et al., The Journal of Cell Biology, 2007, 176:1007-19; Liu W, et al., The Journal of Experimental Medicine, 2010, 207:1095-111; Kumari S, et al., <i>eLife</i>, 2015, v.4; Tolar P, et al., Immunity, 2009, 30:44-55). We cannot detect obvious fluorescent signal for 56 pN NP-TGT sensor (fluorophore-conjugated NP-specific antibodies) at the area within the B cell IS, although such signal can be readily detected at the area without B cells (see <a href=\"#fig8\">Author response image 1A</a>). We tested different batches of NP-specific polyclonal antibodies and consistently observed these results. Although as the reviewers have commented that \u201c\u2026the cell might create a hole in a substrat\u2026,\u201d we speculate there are two explanations for the production of these \u201choles\u201d (area lack of fluorescent signal, see <a href=\"#fig8\">Author response image 1A</a>): (1) NP-conjugated DNA strain on 56 pN NP-TGT sensors were ruptured and dissociated from the coverslip. Subsequently, these dissociated NP-DNA strains can either be internalized by the B cells or diffuse into the bulky aqueous buffer; (2) The adhesion of B cells with 56 pN NP-TGT presenting coverslip was so tight that it would greatly diminish the accessibility of NP-specific antibodies to NP-TGT molecules within the B cell IS. Through a series of further tests, we figured out that the second possibility makes more sense."

Since we have used the non-alternative method as recommended by the reviewer to address this question, we will not include these negative NP-TGT staining data (<a href=\"#fig8\">Author response image 1</a>) in our manuscript."

This is about as much force as is needed to separate the weakest tethers in this manuscript, and much less than the separation forces of the tethers at the two thresholds for B cell spreading (23 pN and 50 pN). The two thresholds correspond to approximately two times and four times the rupture force of the single NP-B1-8 bond, raising a possibility that the separation somehow depends on multivalent bonds.

We would definitely agree with the reviewers that our experimental system does not allow us to make the statement that we are precisely quantifying single molecule force, or more specifically single bond rupture, during the activation of BCRs. A major reason is that BCR monomer itself is a well-characterized bivalent binding receptor with two identical antigen binding domain (Schamel, W.W., and Reth, M., Immunity, 2000, 13:5-14.). Additionally, the recent advance of the super-resolution imaging studies demonstrated that BCR forms obvious nanoclusters with 20-50 IgM-BCRs per nanocluster on quiescent B cells (Mattila PK, et al., Immunity, 2013, 38:461-74). Moreover, the time scale we used in our experiments also indicated that it might not be a monovalent bond. All these points demonstrated the high possibility of multivalent bonds based mechanical forces in regulating the initiation of B cell activation. In the revised manuscript, we eliminated the overstatement of \u201csingle molecule force\u201d or \u201csingle-bond rupture\u201d, but rather reinforce the concept of how mechanical forces applied to BCRs by the NP-TGT antigens influence B cell activation."

The conditions where the rupture force values were obtained are different in these two papers. The values of the rupture forces of these TGT sensors were calculated based on the data measured by magnetic tweezers system with a loading rate of 0 pN/s (constant force with a time under force mode of 2 sec during the measurements), while the values of the rupture forces between NP hapten antigen and B1-8 BCR were measured by AFM system with a loading rate of around 1000 pN/s if we refer to a rupture force of 12-15 pN (different loading rates will lead to the calculation of quite different rupture forces in AFM measurements). Rupture forces measured at different conditions (different loading rate, time under load, spring constants, etc.) in even the same hardware system (either magnetic tweezers or AFM system) are different. Also quite different is the sensitivity for the measurement of mechanical forces of these two hardware systems. Thus, in our opinion, the mechanical force values of the TGT sensors and NP-antigen/BCR cannot be compared directly. In the revised manuscript, we discussed that it would be of great importance to use the magnetic tweezers experimental system to examine the interaction of B1-8-IgM-BCR with NP antigen, and ask how the magnitude and duration of mechanical forces will influence B cell activation."

However, we would like to clarify that the time scale of rupturing any single NP-TGT sensor in our experiments system is not 10 minutes. The 10 minute time point is just the end point that we stopped the interaction of the B cell with NP-TGT sensors and used TIRFM imaging to quantify the strength of B cell activation. In our original manuscript, we also used time lapse TIRFM imaging to examine the dynamics in a 10 minute time course of the response of B cells when initially encountering NP-TGT molecules (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C-E</a>) and we can conclude that the high-force NP-TGT sensors obviously drove better B cell activation responses than low-force NP-TGT ones as early as 3 minutes after loading the B cells to NP-TGT presenting coverslip. We clarified this point in the revised manuscript to avoid confusions. Then what should the time scale of rupturing a single NP-TGT sensor at the physiological condition be? We have to say that there is no direct experimental evidence to allow us to tell the exact answer. We fully agree with the reviewer that the results in the paper by Natkanski et al. can best help us answer this question. We also agree with the reviewer that the best guess of the relevant time scale of rupturing single NP-TGT sensor in our experimental system would be a seconds to dozens of seconds. From this point of view, such a time scale would definitely be larger but does not differ too much from the 2-sec force under load time scale that was used to measure the rupture force of TGT molecules by Ha and his colleagues (Wang X and Ha T, Science, 2013, 340:991-4)."

However, we did take the suggestions from the reviewers to extensively discuss these points in the revised manuscript. In particular, we remind the reviewers that there is no direct evidence to show that the absolute value of the mechanical forces that were taken from the TGT paper (Wang X and Ha T, Science, 2013, 340:991-4) can exactly fit to the situation between B1-8-BCR and NP antigen at the physiological condition. Thus, the usage of low-force NP-TGT, middle-force NP-TGT and high-force NP-TGT might better represent the core findings of this manuscript that the activation of IgM-BCR and isotype-switched BCR exhibit distinct sensitivity and threshold toward the mechanical forces. We did make changes in the revised manuscript to reflect all these facts. Lastly, in our opinion, although the absolute values of the mechanical forces of the TGT sensors used in our experimental condition might differ from those in the paper of Ha and his colleagues (Wang X and Ha T, Science, 2013, 340:991-4), the trends of the dependence on high, middle or low mechanical forces should be the same."
