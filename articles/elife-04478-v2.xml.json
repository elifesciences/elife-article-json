Emotional arousal, a process mediated by the amygdala, can enhance attention to stimuli in a non-spatial manner. However, amygdala neural activity was recently shown to encode spatial information about reward-predictive stimuli, and to correlate with spatial attention allocation. If representing the motivational significance of sensory stimuli within a spatial framework reflects a general principle of amygdala function, then spatially selective neural responses should also be elicited by sensory stimuli threatening aversive events. Recordings from amygdala neurons were therefore obtained while monkeys directed spatial attention towards stimuli promising reward or threatening punishment. Neural responses encoded spatial information similarly for stimuli associated with both valences of reinforcement, and responses reflected spatial attention allocation. The amygdala therefore may act to enhance spatial attention to sensory stimuli associated with rewarding or aversive experiences."

Emotional arousal, a process mediated by the amygdala, can enhance attention to stimuli in a non-spatial manner. However, amygdala neural activity was recently shown to encode spatial information about reward-predictive stimuli, and to correlate with spatial attention allocation. If representing the motivational significance of sensory stimuli within a spatial framework reflects a general principle of amygdala function, then spatially selective neural responses should also be elicited by sensory stimuli threatening aversive events. Recordings from amygdala neurons were therefore obtained while monkeys directed spatial attention towards stimuli promising reward or threatening punishment. Neural responses encoded spatial information similarly for stimuli associated with both valences of reinforcement, and responses reflected spatial attention allocation. The amygdala therefore may act to enhance spatial attention to sensory stimuli associated with rewarding or aversive experiences."

As expected, amygdala neurons responded to cues that predicted the reward and also to cues that signaled the air puff. Surprisingly, however, the neurons also varied their responses according to the location of the cues."

Enhanced spatial attention improves sensory processing of behaviorally relevant stimuli (<a href=\"#bib7\">Anderson et al., 2011</a>) and quickens purposeful actions based on these stimuli (<a href=\"#bib53\">Posner, 1980</a>). Subjects must not only register the emotional significance of a stimulus to enhance spatial attention, but they also must locate the stimulus. For example, in the wild, carnivores must identify potential predators and prey, register their emotional or motivational significance, and then locate the predator or prey if they want to mount an attack or retreat. The brain must therefore combine information about the motivational significance and location of stimuli to enhance spatial attention and facilitate actions."

A substantial body of literature has documented the amygdala's importance in processing both aversive (<a href=\"#bib13\">Campeau and Davis, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Quirk et al., 1995</a>) and appetitive stimuli (<a href=\"#bib58\">Sanghera et al., 1979</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Nishijo et al., 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Holland and Gallagher, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Schoenbaum et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Baxter and Murray, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Carelli et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Sugase-Miyamoto and Richmond, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Ambroggi et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Tye et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Shabel and Janak, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Bermudez and Schultz, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Jenison et al., 2011</a>). Recent studies have compared amygdala neural responses to the same conditioned stimulus (CS) when paired with a rewarding or aversive unconditioned stimulus (US); neurons often responded differentially to the CS depending on whether it predicted a positive or negative outcome (<a href=\"#bib44\">Paton et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Belova et al., 2007</a>, <a href=\"#bib11\">2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Morrison et al., 2011</a>) suggestive of a valence-specific coding scheme where neurons respond to stimuli on a \u2018good-to-bad\u2019 scale. Further, different populations of neurons fired more for either reward- or punishment-predicting stimuli, raising the possibility that the amygdala contains distinct networks for processing stimuli possessing appetitive and aversive associations (<a href=\"#bib67\">Zhang et al., 2013</a>). Neural signals encoding valence are likely critical for a range of cognitive and behavioral functions where adaptive responses differ fundamentally depending upon valence, such as approach and defensive or avoidance behaviors, economic choice behavior, and many psychophysiological responses that are known to be valence-specific (e.g. the startle response) (<a href=\"#bib29\">Lang and Davis, 2006</a>). Indeed, a recent study has now documented that distinct appetitive and aversive circuits in the amygdala are causally related to valence-specific behavior (<a href=\"#bib56\">Redondo et al., 2014</a>)."

Emotional intensity may be related to processes like arousal, which can be triggered by stimuli of both valences and be characterized quantitatively by psychophysiological measures (<a href=\"#bib30\">Lang et al., 1993</a>). Prior studies indicate that the firing rates of amygdala neurons are correlated in some circumstances with valence-nonspecific aspects of conditioned (<a href=\"#bib61\">Shabel and Janak, 2009</a>) and unconditioned stimuli (<a href=\"#bib10\">Belova et al., 2007</a>), suggesting that the amygdala could modulate arousal or related processes. Nearly all previous studies have assumed that if the amygdala modulates valence-nonspecific processes, it does so in a non-spatial manner (<a href=\"#bib25\">Holland and Gallagher, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Maddux et al., 2007</a>)."

Amygdala neurons encode information about both the spatial location and reward association of visual stimuli (<a href=\"#bib47\">Peck et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Peck and Salzman, 2014</a>), and the maintenance of coordinated amygdala signals representing space and reward is task dependent (<a href=\"#bib49\">Peck et al., In press</a>). The encoding of space and reward in the primate amygdala has now also been confirmed by human neuroimaging data (<a href=\"#bib43\">Ousdal et al., 2014</a>). Furthermore, amygdala neural activity is correlated with a behavioral measure of spatial attention, saccadic reaction times to a barely perceptible target (<a href=\"#bib47\">Peck et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Peck and Salzman, 2014</a>). Correlations between reaction time and amygdala activity have a different sign depending upon the location of the target, with increased activity predicting shorter reaction times to some locations and longer reaction times to other locations. A framework in which the amygdala merely represents the motivational significance of a stimulus in a valence-nonspecific and spatial-nonspecific manner cannot explain these data due to the spatial dependence of these correlations. If an amygdala neuron merely represents motivational significance then correlations between amygdala activity and reaction times would have the same sign regardless of the location of the saccade target. Increased activity, for example, would predict shorter reaction times for all target locations, which is not consistent with the recent findings."

Of course, subjects often exhibit enhanced attention to stimuli threatening aversive events, a behavior that may be mediated by the amygdala as well. In humans, an intact amygdala is vital for guiding gaze towards emotionally-relevant features of fearful face stimuli (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adolphs et al., 2005</a>) and for augmenting BOLD responses to these stimuli in the ventral visual areas (<a href=\"#bib66\">Vuilleumier et al., 2004</a>) that receive amygdalar input (<a href=\"#bib2\">Amaral and Price, 1984</a>) and play an important role in attentional processing (<a href=\"#bib57\">Reynolds and Chelazzi, 2004</a>). Moreover, neuroimaging data has revealed that unilateral amygdala lesions are associated with decreased selectivity for negatively valenced stimuli in ipsilateral visual cortices (<a href=\"#bib66\">Vuilleumier et al., 2004</a>), a finding consistent with amygdalar projections to visual cortex being primarily ipsilateral (<a href=\"#bib26\">Iwai and Yukie, 1987</a>). Thus, the pathway from the amygdala to ventral visual areas may be important in guiding spatial attention towards stimuli associated with both rewarding and aversive outcomes."

Furthermore, neural activity should reflect the allocation of attention to stimuli threatening aversive events. We therefore determined if neural activity in the amygdala reflects the motivational significance of sensory stimuli of both valences in a spatial framework. We recorded the activity of individual amygdala neurons while monkeys performed a task in which stimuli associated with aversive or appetitive outcomes attracted spatial attention. Amygdala neurons represented the spatial location of both reward- and punishment-predicting stimuli, and modulation occurred in the same direction for both types of stimuli. These results suggest that the amygdala provides a means for modulating the neuronal networks responsible for spatial attention allocation to emotionally significant stimuli of both valences."

While monkeys maintained fixation, two visual cues appeared briefly for 300 ms on either side of the fixation point. Following cue offset, a variable-length delay period ensued before the 50 ms presentation of a barely-perceptible target in the same location as one of the two cues. The monkeys completed the trial correctly (a \u2018hit\u2019) by making a saccadic eye movement to the location of the target within 600 ms. Generally, \u2018miss\u2019 trials occurred when the monkey failed to make a saccade at all (61% of miss trials) since the timing of target onset was variable and the target itself was difficult to detect; however, miss trials also included those where a saccade was directed towards the location opposite the target (28% of incorrect trials) or elsewhere (11% of incorrect trials). All trials where monkeys' gaze left the fixation window before target onset were repeated such that they could not avoid a particular trial type."

In agreement with the relatively small effect the punishment cue had on behavior as compared to the reward cue (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>), spatial-punishment selectivity was generally weaker than spatial-reward selectivity. The population of spatial-punishment selective sites was significantly smaller than the population of spatial-reward selective sites (\u03c7<sup>2</sup>-test, p &lt; 10<sup>\u22124</sup> for each time window), and the magnitude of spatial-reward selectivity was significantly greater than that of spatial-punishment selectivity (compare |ROC\u20140.5|; Paired Wilcoxon, p &lt; 10<sup>\u22125</sup> in each time epoch). These observations do not necessarily imply that the behavioral significance of reward is inherently greater than that of punishment, only that the punishment was made relatively mild in our task in order to keep the monkeys engaged in the task.

This relationship (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>) was not a byproduct of the correlation between reward and spatial-reward selectivity; using a multiple linear regression, we found that spatial-reward selectivity (<i>\u03b2</i> = 0.22, 0.12, 0.10 in each time epoch), more so than reward selectivity (<i>\u03b2</i> = 0.08, \u22120.00, \u22120.02), was predictive of spatial-punishment selectivity. There was a significant effect of time epoch on the slope of the regressions lines (ANCOVA, p &lt; 10<sup>\u22126</sup>), which were greatest in the 100\u2013400 ms epoch (see <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>).

The correspondence between spatial-reward and spatial-punishment selectivity was also apparent for individual recording sites. Of those responses (i.e. for each site and time window) with significant spatial-reward and spatial punishment selectivity (n = 64), the sign of selectivity was the same for 54 (84%; Binomial-test, p &lt; 10<sup>\u22127</sup>). Since attention was biased contralaterally when either a reward (on R/P or R/N trials) or punishment cue appeared contralaterally (on P/N trials), the positive relationship and sign-agreement between these selectivity indices suggest that the spatial signals in the amygdala may influence spatial attention in a similar manner for stimuli promising rewards or threatening punishments."

We hypothesized that neural activity would reflect the bias in attention elicited by the P cue. To compare neural activity when the P cue appeared on R/P trials to when the N cue appeared on R/N trials, we again computed selectivity indices (ROC) to assess the difference in firing rates on R/P and R/N trials given a particular spatial configuration. We analyzed the effect of including the P cue contralaterally when the reward cue was ipsilateral (punishment-contra selectivity; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>, top) as well as the effect of the P cue appearing ipsilaterally while the R cue was contralateral (punishment-ipsi selectivity; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>, bottom). On an individual site basis, the P cue had a relatively small influence on firing rate when appearing along with the reward cue.

The difference in this relationship across time epochs was verified by a significant effect of epoch for the spatial-reward/punishment-ipsi relationship (ANCOVA, p = 0.0136). Both punishment-contra and punishment-ipsi selectivity indices were correlated across time epoch (100\u2013400 -&gt; 400\u2013700 ms &amp; 400\u2013700 -&gt; 700\u20131000 ms; linear regression, p &lt; 0.001 in each case) suggesting consistent coding across time even when its strength differed.

Since both of these relationships were present late in the trial during times when the target could appear, these signals could have influenced perceptual detection. Overall, amygdala neurons reflect changes in attention driven by stimuli threatening aversive outcomes even when attention is primarily directed at the location of a reward-predicting cue. While not a trial-to-trial measure, the neural tracking of these small biases in spatial attention may be related to the correlation between small trial-to-trial fluctuations in attention and amygdala firing rates that we have described previously (<a href=\"#bib47\">Peck et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Peck and Salzman, 2014</a>)."

Second, monkeys were more likely to abort trials that included the P cue, indicated that the trials were associated with a less desirable outcome. When the monkey's gaze left the fixation window before the target appeared, some saccades were directed at one of the two cue locations (false alarms) and others were directed elsewhere (aborts). False alarms likely reflect a monkey's desire to detect a target at a given location (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>), but aborts likely indicating that a monkey preferred not to complete a particular trial type. By this logic, if the P cue was associated with aversive meaning to monkeys, we would observe the highest abort rate on the least valuable trials (P/N), and the lowest abort rate on the most valuable trials (R/N)."

In contrast, the inclusion of the P cue tended to increase the frequency of aborts (compare R/P vs R/N trials; p &lt; 0.05 for each monkey). We observed this behavior during distinct portions of the trial for each monkey: monkey O exhibited this pattern for aborts around the time that the cue was on (0\u2013300 ms after cue onset), and monkey L exhibited this pattern during the subsequent delay (300\u20131000 ms after cue onset). The results in the <i>other</i> time window for each monkey (Monkey L, 0\u2013300 ms; Monkey O, 300\u20131000 ms) did not contradict these results; neither monkey showed a significant difference in abort frequency between R/P and R/N trials (p &gt; 0.62). Abort frequency therefore correlated with the overall reinforcement value of the cues where R/N trials are the most valuable and P/N trials are the least valuable.

In the present report, monkeys allocated attention towards stimuli that promised reward or threatened punishment. Amygdala neural activity represented the location and motivational significance of visual stimuli in a coordinated manner. Neurons that responded more strongly when a stimulus associated with motivationally significant outcomes appeared also responded more strongly when such stimuli appeared in the contralateral field. Other neurons had the opposite response profile, responding least strongly to visual stimuli associated with motivationally significant outcomes, especially when they appeared in the contralateral field. Importantly, neural activity reflected biases in spatial attention that were induced by the appearance of stimuli associated with appetitive or aversive outcomes. The amygdala therefore may not merely influence attention by modulating arousal, a non-spatial mechanism. Instead, the amygdala may also influence spatial attention\u2014a process distinct from arousal\u2014by encoding information about both the spatial location and motivational significance of sensory cues associated with appetitive and aversive outcomes."

In rodents, experimental lesions and pharmacological or optogenetic manipulations of neural activity in the amygdala affect approach or defensive behaviors (<a href=\"#bib16\">Ciocchi et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Haubensak et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Stuber et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Redondo et al., 2014</a>). Physiological data from rodents and monkeys have linked amygdala neural activity to either appetitive or aversive valence (<a href=\"#bib58\">Sanghera et al., 1979</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Nishijo et al., 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Quirk et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Schoenbaum et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Sugase-Miyamoto and Richmond, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Paton et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Belova et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Shabel and Janak, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Bermudez and Schultz, 2010</a>). Prior work has also implicated the amygdala in mediating valence-nonspecific processes such as autonomic and metabolic arousal (<a href=\"#bib17\">Davis and Whalen, 2001</a>). Furthermore, we have previously shown that expectation can modulate amygdala neural responses to rewarding or aversive unconditioned stimuli in a similar manner (<a href=\"#bib10\">Belova et al., 2007</a>), reminiscent of unsigned prediction errors in reinforcement learning algorithms (<a href=\"#bib45\">Pearce and Hall, 1980</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Schultz and Dickinson, 2000</a>). These results were suggestive of a role for the amygdala in generating arousal, which can be produced by motivationally significant stimuli of both valences. However, the results did not pertain to visuo-spatial attention since the observed response characteristics were tied to the unconditioned stimulus, not to conditioned stimuli. Furthermore, in those experiments, conditioned stimuli were not presented at peripheral locations. Recent work has suggested that the amygdala participates in the modulation of spatial attention induced by emotional stimuli (<a href=\"#bib66\">Vuilleumier et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Adolphs et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Peck et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Ousdal et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Peck and Salzman, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Peck et al., In press</a>), but these studies have not examined whether amygdala neurons encode spatial information about stimuli of both valences, and, if so, whether that activity correlates with spatial attention deployment."

Attention can be modulated by motivationally significant stimuli of both valences, and stimuli with high motivational significance may therefore be considered to be more salient. In general, as value increases, motivational significance and attention can increase, presenting an interpretive conundrum (<a href=\"#bib36\">Maunsell, 2004</a>). One approach for disentangling these quantities involves testing whether neural responses are modulated similarly for stimuli predicting rewarding and aversive outcomes. Even this approach has caveats, because a neuron might encode both valence and motivational significance. Titration of outcome intensity across valences might be helpful in characterizing the relative contribution of valence and intensity on neuronal firing. This approach, however, presents experimental challenges because the subjective assessment of stimulus intensity and valence can change within experiments due to satiation to rewards and/or habituation to punishments."

Conceivably, this could mean that the modulation of neural activity was related to the rewarding aspects of avoiding an aversive air-puff and not to the threat of an aversive air-puff. For several reasons, we consider it unlikely that the rewarding aspects of punishment avoidance could explain our results. First, air puff delivery was still associated with the P cue on \u223c45% of trials in which the target appeared at the P location. Second, monkeys aborted R/P trials at a higher rate than R/N trials, suggesting that the punishment cue was more aversive than the neutral cue. Third, prior studies have shown that air puffs have aversive value to monkeys (<a href=\"#bib5\">Amemori and Graybiel, 2012</a>), and our experience is that monkeys' propensity to quit performing a task relates to the number of air puffs they have received in that session. Finally, even if monkeys find successful avoidance to be rewarding, this would not be apparent until later in the trial after the monkey successfully acquires the target."

When a P cue appeared on the contralateral side, neural activity in the amygdala predicted whether or not the monkey would later abort the trial in a manner dependent upon the reward selectivity of neurons. Neurons that fire more strongly in a more rewarding situation (e.g. R/N trials) tend to fire less on trials when a monkey breaks fixation. By contrast, neurons that fire more strongly when a monkey is in a less rewarding situation (e.g. P/N trials), fire more on trials when a monkey aborts."

It is possible that monkeys exhibit two different kinds of abort behaviors in our task, one in which the monkey's concentration simply lapsed and another where the monkey aborted specifically in response to the value of the trial, that is to the threat of air-puff. The former behavior might be equally likely to occur on all trial types, would not be related to an assessment of threat, and also may have occurred more rarely. The second type of trial abort would occur preferentially on trials in which the R cue did not appear. The fact that amygdala neurons are correlated with trial aborts only when the punishment cue appeared contralaterally, but not ipsilaterally, suggests that there is a spatial component to this response property as well. This is reminiscent of our previous observation that correlations between reaction times and firing rates are apparent only when motivationally significant stimuli appear in the contralateral hemifield (<a href=\"#bib47\">Peck et al., 2013</a>). Overall, the relationship between neural activity and the tendency to abort trials does suggest that the amygdala represents threats as well as rewards within a spatial framework."

Previous studies that described signals in relation to motivational significance or arousal in the amygdala did not determine whether these properties were represented in a spatial framework (<a href=\"#bib10\">Belova et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Shabel and Janak, 2009</a>). The present study indicates that for many amygdala neurons, the representation of motivational significance is linked to a representation of space. These results highlight the possibility that the amygdala's influence on attention may not be limited to non-spatial processes like emotional arousal. Instead, the amygdala may provide signals that contribute directly to spatial attention. This implies that for a neuron that encodes both space and motivational significance, increases in firing rates may pull attention more towards the contralateral visual hemifield, and less to the ipsilateral field. Since the amygdala also contains neurons with opposite response preferences for space and motivational significance, these other amygdala neurons could have the opposite relationship with spatial attention. Of note, the neural representation provided by the amygdala differs fundamentally from representations that encode motivational significance independent of space, or that encode space and motivational significance but in a non-coordinated manner."

Finally, <a href=\"#bib31\">Leathers and Olson (2012)</a> found that lateral intraparietal area (LIP) neurons fired in proportion to the intensity of predicted outcomes, regardless of valence. Although these neurons may be distinct from those typically recorded in LIP given differences in their fundamental response properties (<a href=\"#bib41\">Newsome et al., 2013</a>), they do seem to exhibit responses reflecting motivational significance. The population of neurons described in LIP, however, does not include neurons that prefer less salient stimuli.

The physiological studies in rodents, however, have not reported a systematic relationship between the encoding of motivational significance and space. In the present paper, some neurons fire more strongly for more motivationally significant (or salient) stimuli, especially when they appear contralaterally.

First, the amygdala projects directly to neurons in primate ventral visual areas (<a href=\"#bib2\">Amaral and Price, 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Iwai and Yukie, 1987</a>) whose firing rates modulate depending upon where attention is allocated (<a href=\"#bib15\">Chelazzi et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Desimone and Duncan, 1995</a>). Stimuli predicting aversive events have not been employed while investigating modulation of individual neurons' visual responses in the ventral stream. One prediction of the current work is that if the amygdala directly modulates visual representations, then attention-attracting stimuli associated with aversive outcomes should modulate responses in the same manner as reward-predicting stimuli. Supporting this notion, unilateral amygdala lesions attenuate preferential BOLD response for negative-valence stimuli (<a href=\"#bib66\">Vuilleumier et al., 2004</a>)."

Selective visual attention in rodents appears to involve a projection from the amygdala central nucleus to the basal forebrain (<a href=\"#bib23\">Holland, 2007</a>), which may be important for influencing attention-related cortical processing given the basal forebrain's widespread cortical projections (<a href=\"#bib37\">Mesulam et al., 1983</a>) and attention-like influences over cortical activity (<a href=\"#bib21\">Goard and Dan, 2009</a>). Recent data indicate that the basal forebrain also encodes spatial and reward information (<a href=\"#bib46\">Peck and Salzman, 2014</a>), but the output of basal forebrain neurons does not appear to be correlated with spatial attention on a trial-by-trial basis. Enhanced attention to conditioned stimuli may also involve projections between the amygdala central nucleus to dopamine neurons (<a href=\"#bib19\">El-Amamy and Holland, 2007</a>). Amygdala and dopamine neurons are reciprocally connected (<a href=\"#bib54\">Price and Amaral, 1981</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Amaral et al., 1982</a>), and dopamine neurons signal quantities related to motivation (<a href=\"#bib35\">Matsumoto and Hikosaka, 2009</a>).

Distinct populations of amygdala neurons decrease or increase firing rate with respect to spatial attention, unlike modulation in brain areas such as V4 (<a href=\"#bib38\">Mitchell et al., 2007</a>) and LIP (<a href=\"#bib64\">Sugrue et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Peck et al., 2009</a>) where firing rates typically only increase when attention is directed towards the contralateral hemifield. The sign of modulation for amygdala neurons does not predict whether spiking statistics are characteristic of excitatory or inhibitory neurons (<a href=\"#bib47\">Peck et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Peck and Salzman, 2014</a>). Amygdala projections to visual cortices are primarily ipsilateral (<a href=\"#bib26\">Iwai and Yukie, 1987</a>) and excitatory in nature (<a href=\"#bib20\">Freese and Amaral, 2006</a>). Future studies must therefore discern whether the sign of amygdala neurons' spatial selectivity predicts whether projections target excitatory or inhibitory neurons in visual cortex. In addition, much work remains to characterize the spatial specificity of signals provided by the amygdala. The present results suggest that the amygdala could play a role in influencing attention at the level of the hemifield, but the topographical specificity of these signals remains to be characterized."

The physiological data presented in this paper provide a unifying view of the role of the amygdala in representing these emotionally significant stimuli in space so as to modulate attention. Amygdala neurons not only register the emotional significance of stimuli promising reward and threatening aversive events, but they also represent information about the spatial location of those stimuli. Given that the motivational significance and location of stimuli together bias spatial attention, the spatial representation in the amygdala may serve to link our emotional world to cognitive actions\u2014the enhancement of spatial attention to relevant stimuli\u2014that promote our survival."

Four to eight electrodes were individually lowered into the left (monkeys O and L) amygdala using a multiple electrode microdrive (NaN Instruments, Nazareth, Israel). Extracellular activity was recorded using tungsten electrodes (2 M\u03a9 impedance at 1000 Hz; FHC Inc., Bowdoinham, ME). Analog signals were amplified, bandpass filtered (250\u20137500 Hz), and digitized (30,000 Hz) for unit isolation (Blackrock Microsystems, Salt Lake City, Utah). We initially defined SUA online as units whose waveforms were clearly distinguishably from noise and/or other units; this classification was made online using either a time-amplitude window or manual clustering in principal component space. After experiments, we reanalyzed the waveforms (Plexon Offline Sorter, Plexon, Dallas, TX) and manually clustered the waveforms of SUA in principal component space; waveform groups were defined as SUA only if they formed a distinct, non-overlapping cluster in principal component space. Because neurons occasionally drift over the course of an experiment such that their waveforms either emerge or descend into the noise cluster, we defined the time interval during which the SUA was clearly distinguishable from the noise and excluded all other data within that session from our analyses. Mutli-unit activity consisted of waveforms that were not sorted as single-units. We re-thresholded the data offline to correct any major deviations in MUA baseline firing rate due to threshold changes over the course of an experimental session. When MUA and SUA(s) were recorded on the same channel, we removed MUA timestamps within 2 ms of any SUA timestamp to ensure that threshold \u2018double-crossings\u2019 by the single-unit did not contaminate the multi-unit signal."

After a fixation period of 500\u20131500 ms (exponential distribution, \u03bb = 170 ms), two cues appeared at either side of the fixation point along the horizontal axis (7\u00b0 eccentricity) for 300 ms.

At a randomly chosen time 400\u20134000 ms (exponential distribution, \u03bb = 390 ms) later, a target appeared (50 ms) at one of the two locations at which the cues had been presented.

For trials in which the monkeys' eye position left the fixation window before the appearance of the target, eye movements were classified as either a <i>false alarm</i> if the saccade was directed within 3\u00b0 of one of the two cue locations (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>) or as an <i>abort</i> if they were directed elsewhere (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). Since the target appeared at a random time, the time range within which false alarms and aborts could occur varied from trial-to-trial. Additionally, saccades within 100 ms of the target were considered to be false alarms or aborts since it is unlikely that the monkey could have reacted to the target's appearance within this short time window. False alarm and abort trials were repeated so that monkeys weren't able to avoid selected trial types; cue configuration, target position, and delay length were re-randomized on repeated trials. For trials where the monkey maintained fixation until target onset, a \u2018hit\u2019 occurred when the monkey successfully made a saccade to the target's location, and a \u2018miss\u2019 occurred when monkeys (1) failed to make a saccade, (2) made a saccade to the opposite cue location, or (3) made a saccade elsewhere. Miss trials that involved a saccade to the opposite cue location or elsewhere were fundamentally distinct from false alarms/aborts since the monkey could receive a punishment in these instances whereas a false alarm or abort simply resulted in a repeated trial. Both hit and miss trials were considered to be \u2018completed\u2019 trials, and outcomes were delivered 1000 ms (monkey L) or 400 ms (monkey O) after trials were completed. Reward consisted of \u223c1 ml of water controlled by a solenoid and delivered to the monkey through a lick tube; punishments came in the form of a 70 millisecond long 20-40 PSI puff of compressed air aimed at the cheek."

Reward delivery occurred only on hit trials where the target had appeared at the same location as the reward cue. Punishments occurred only on miss trials where the target appeared at the same location as a punishment cue had appeared. These contingencies meant that monkeys never received both a reward and a punishment on the same trial. All completed trials resulted either in reward (\u2018hit\u2019 to the target when an R cue had appeared at that location), punishment (\u2018miss\u2019 when the target appeared at the location where the P cue had appeared), or no reinforcement (\u2018miss\u2019 when the target had appeared at the R location, or \u2018hit\u2019 when the target appeared at the P location). Cues were colored rectangles (2.25 deg.<sup>2</sup> at 7\u00b0 eccentricity) equated for luminance, and we randomly interleaved two distinct sets of cues associated with the same outcomes (6 cues total). Targets were Gabor patches; we adjusted the contrast and size of the Gabors online to maintain an overall performance level of \u223c70% correct. Because the interval during which the target could appear was long and the reaction time window was relatively short, theoretical chance performance was about 23%. Maximal chance performance levels were determined by assuming that all saccades were made at the specific time in the trial at which a hit was most likely to \u2018accidently\u2019 occur. Given the reaction time window of 100\u2013600 ms, the optimal time to saccade was 100 ms after the 500 ms within which targets were most frequent, in which case \u223c46% of saccades would occur within the reaction time window. Finally, since these saccades would only be directed at the correct location 50% of the time, chance performance was determined to be 23%. In practice, false alarms were distributed throughout the delay period and occurred most frequently at 790 ms after cue onset, 60 ms <i>before</i> the most frequent time of target onset (850 ms), whereas the optimal time to saccade would have been at 1080 ms. Thus, monkeys did not follow this strategy, and effective chance levels were lower than 23%."

The other two time windows (400\u2013700 ms and 700\u20131000 ms after cue onset) were chosen to surround the earliest time that the target could possibly appear, which was \u223c700 ms after cue onset. Since monkeys could not predict exactly when the target would appear, it was in their best interest to be prepared for the target's appearance at all times after 700 ms. Since we excluded responses where the target appeared during that time window (46% of targets appeared in the 700\u20131000 ms window), a decreasing number of trials were available for analysis in later time windows which occasionally results in a site being included in the analysis of early, but not late, time windows. For the neural analysis of abort trials (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>), we truncated firing rates at the time that the abort occurred (truncated at the time of the abort, included only if the abort occurred at least 100 ms after the start of the epoch), again resulting in a decreasing sample size for later time windows."

We also estimated the number of recording sites in the basolateral nucleus, the central nucleus, and the anterior amygdala area by comparing our MRI reconstructions with an anatomical atlas (Paxinos, Huang and Toga, 1999 brain atlas). As with previous work (<a href=\"#bib47\">Peck et al., 2013</a>), we estimated that the vast majority of our recordings were in the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala (n = 283) as opposed to the central nucleus (n = 51) or anterior amygdaloid area (n = 11). Further, those recordings in the basolateral nuclei excluded the most lateral extent of the amygdala suggesting that these neurons were mainly in the basal and accessory basal nuclei. We targeted these amygdala nuclei because they are the densest source of the projections to the ventral visual stream and/or the basal forebrain, which we believe may have the most direct role in influencing spatial attention."

Crucially, spatial-reward and spatial-punishment selectivity indices were also positively correlated in each time window (p\u22640.0007); these results were statistically indistinguishable between monkeys (ANCOVA, p=0.10, 0.59, 0.74 for each time window, respectively) and between single- and multi-unit data (p=0.51, 0.59, 0.65).

This observation was verified by a significant effect of epoch for the spatial-reward/punishment-ipsi relationship (ANCOVA, p=0.0136) but not the spatial-reward/punishment-contra relationship (p=0.83). In each case (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D,E</a>), relationships were statistically indistinguishable when comparing single- and multi-unit data (ANCOVA, p&gt;0.15).

False alarms were distributed throughout the trials with peaks occurring while the cues were on the screen and around the time that the target was most likely to appear. Of note, on the assumption that monkeys knew that saccades directed at the cues themselves would never yield an outcome, only false alarms after cue offset were included in the analysis of <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a> in the manuscript. Consequently, we examined the timing of the second peak in false alarms (since this was more likely to coincide with the time of target onset). This peak on average occurred slightly before the time when the target was most likely to appear (Monkey <i>L:</i> \u221240 ms; Monkey O: \u2212100 ms). While this result suggests that the monkey may understand the task timing in terms of when the target is most likely to appear, they do not suggest that they followed an optimal strategy in terms of maximizing hit rate. Given the reaction time window (100\u2013600 ms after target onset), the monkeys\u2019 best strategy would have been to saccade 100 ms after the 500 ms period within which targets were most frequent, which was 1070 and 1080 ms after cue onset for Monkey L and Monkey O, respectively (green lines in <a href=\"#fig8\">Author response image 1</a>). We also found that the increased false alarm rate did not coincide with increased hit rate. False alarms were most frequent early in the time period where targets could appear, but hit rate grew steadily as a function of time (<a href=\"#fig8\">Author response image 1</a>, blue line).

There was only enough data for analyzing the false alarms directed towards the most \u2018salient\u2019 location on each trial type (R-cue location on R/P, R/N trials and P-cue location on P/N trials) given that false alarms were more frequent there (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). For each trial type (R-contra, R-ipsi, P-contra, and P-ipsi), we computed selectivity indices (ROC) comparing firing rates on trials where the monkey false alarmed with those on trials where they did not and evaluated the significance of these firing rate differences (Wilcoxon, p&lt;0.05). The proportion of neurons exhibiting significant selectivity exceeded chance when false alarms were to the contralateral or ipsilateral sides where a reward would have resulted in a correct detection (Binomial-test; contralateral false alarms: 100\u2013400 ms: 13%, p&lt;10<sup>\u22124</sup>; 400\u2013700 ms: 15%, p&lt;10<sup>\u22124</sup>; 700\u20131000 ms: 7%, p=0.1183; ipsilateral saccades: 12%, p&lt;10<sup>\u22124</sup>; 9%, p=0.0023; 9%, p=0.0045 for the 3 time epochs). On trials where the reward cue did not appear, neural activity did not predict false alarms to a punishment location for either side (p&gt;0.33). Despite the presence of selectivity, this signal did not appear to be coordinated across the population with other aspects of the neurons\u2019 physiological properties; we did not observe a relationship between either spatial-reward selectivity indices or reward selectivity indices (as in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4B and 5D,E</a>) and any of these forms of false alarm selectivity indices (linear regression, p&gt;0.17 in each time epoch). Further, the slope of the regressions between spatial-reward and spatial-punishment selectivity indices (as in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>) did not differ significantly when separately considering false alarm and non-false alarm trials (ANCOVA, p&gt;0.08 in all epochs). Given the lack of a relationship between these findings and other physiological response properties, we find it difficult to interpret the significance of these analyses. As such, we have not included these results in the revised manuscript, but are happy to do so if the reviewers believe that it would make an important contribution."

We consider monkeys to have two adaptive ways of responding to the threat of an airpuff. One is to successfully detect the target, which results in avoidance. The second is to abort the trial. Thus, to the extent that neural activity predicts whether a monkey will abort a trial, one might interpret this activity as representing the threat of the airpuff."

The intuition is that neurons that respond more when a trial is more rewarding (\u201cpositive\u201d neurons) should fire less on aborted trials compared to those that were not aborted. By contrast, neurons that respond less when a trial is more rewarding (\u201cnegative\u201d neurons) should fire more on aborted trials.

We note that this analysis was only possible for a subset of neurons since aborts were relatively infrequent (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). Data was analyzed only in epochs prior to or encompassing the abort (truncated at the time of fixation break; we only included data if the abort occurred at least 100 ms after the start of the time epoch being analyzed). As a result, the number of neurons available for analysis decreased for later time epochs. Significant selectivity (Wilcoxon, p&lt;0.05) for aborts was observed in more cells than expected by chance when considering P-contra trials (7.9%, 7.6%, 10.3% of neurons in each of the 3 time epochs analyzed; Binomial-test, p&lt;0.0414, 0.0707, 0.0050).

One possibility is that monkeys exhibited two different kinds of abort behaviors in our task, one in which the monkey\u2019s concentration simply lapsed and another where the monkey aborted specifically in response to the value of the trial. The former behavior might be equally likely to occur on all trial types. However, for \u201cvalue-based\u201d aborts, neural selectivity might only be present on trials of more negative value to the monkey, such as the P/N trials. The fact that abort selectivity appears when the punishment cue appeared contralaterally, but not ipsilaterally, suggests that there is a spatial component to this selectivity. This is reminiscent of our previous observation that correlations between reaction times and firing rates are apparent only when motivational significant stimuli appear in the contralateral hemifield (<a href=\"#bib47\">Peck et al., 2013</a>). We now include these results and possible interpretations in the revised manuscript (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>, Results and Discussion section). Overall, the relationship between neural activity and the propensity to abort trials does suggest that the amygdala represents threats as well as rewards within a spatial framework."

The positive relationship between spatial-reward and spatial-punishment selectivity indices (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>) did not differ between SUA/MUA in any epoch (ANCOVA, p&gt;0.50) and was generally significant for each (p&lt;0.05 in each epoch, except p=0.2374 in the 700\u20131000 ms epoch for MUA). We also observed a similar selectivity for SUA and MUA in the analyses of <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E,D</a>; the slope of the regression lines did not differ between activity type for either comparison (ANCOVA, p&gt;0.15)."

We initially defined SUA online as units whose waveforms were clearly distinguishable from noise and/or other units; this classification was initially made online using either a time-amplitude window or manual clustering in principal component space. After experiments, we reanalyzed the waveforms using Plexon Offline Sorter and manually clustered the waveforms of SUA in principal component space; waveform groups were defined as SUA only if they formed a distinct, non-overlapping cluster in principal component space. Because neurons occasionally drift over the course of an experiment such that their waveforms either emerge or descend into the noise cluster, we defined the time interval during which the SUA was clearly distinguishable from the noise and excluded all other data within that session from our analyses of SUA."
