Proper glycosylation of the \u03b1-dystroglycan (\u03b1-DG) subunit is essential for these activities, and lack thereof results in neuromuscular disease. Currently, neither the glycan synthesis pathway nor the roles of many known or putative glycosyltransferases that are essential for this process are well understood. Here we show that FKRP, FKTN, TMEM5 and B4GAT1 (formerly known as B3GNT1) localize to the Golgi and contribute to the O-mannosyl post-phosphorylation modification of \u03b1-DG. Moreover, we assigned B4GAT1 a function as a xylose \u03b21,4-glucuronyltransferase. Nuclear magnetic resonance studies confirmed that a glucuronic acid \u03b21,4-xylose disaccharide synthesized by B4GAT1 acts as an acceptor primer that can be elongated by LARGE with the ligand-binding heteropolysaccharide. Our findings greatly broaden the understanding of \u03b1-DG glycosylation and provide mechanistic insight into why mutations in B4GAT1 disrupt dystroglycan function and cause disease."

Proper glycosylation of the \u03b1-dystroglycan (\u03b1-DG) subunit is essential for these activities, and lack thereof results in neuromuscular disease. Currently, neither the glycan synthesis pathway nor the roles of many known or putative glycosyltransferases that are essential for this process are well understood. Here we show that FKRP, FKTN, TMEM5 and B4GAT1 (formerly known as B3GNT1) localize to the Golgi and contribute to the O-mannosyl post-phosphorylation modification of \u03b1-DG. Moreover, we assigned B4GAT1 a function as a xylose \u03b21,4-glucuronyltransferase. Nuclear magnetic resonance studies confirmed that a glucuronic acid \u03b21,4-xylose disaccharide synthesized by B4GAT1 acts as an acceptor primer that can be elongated by LARGE with the ligand-binding heteropolysaccharide. Our findings greatly broaden the understanding of \u03b1-DG glycosylation and provide mechanistic insight into why mutations in B4GAT1 disrupt dystroglycan function and cause disease."

Dystroglycan helps to connect the structural network inside the cell with the matrix outside of the cell. The extracellular matrix fills the space between the cells to serve as a scaffold and hold cells together within a tissue. It is well established that the interaction of cells with their extracellular environments is important for structuring tissues, as well as for helping cells to specialize and migrate. These interactions also play a role in the progression of cancer."

Enzymes called glycosyltransferases are responsible for sequentially assembling a complex array of sugar molecules on dystroglycan. This modification is essential for making dystroglycan \u2018sticky\u2019, so it can bind to the components of the extracellular matrix. If sugar molecules are added incorrectly, dystroglycan loses its ability to bind to these components. This causes congenital muscular dystrophies, a group of diseases that are characterized by a progressive loss of muscle function."

This reveals that a glycosyltransferase known as B3GNT1 is one of the enzymes responsible for adding a sugar molecule to the complex. This enzyme was first described in the literature over a decade ago, and the name B3GNT1 was assigned, according to a code, to reflect the sugar molecule it was thought to transfer to proteins. However, Willer et al. (and independently, Praissman et al.) find that this enzyme actually attaches a different sugar modification to dystroglycan, and so should therefore be called B4GAT1 instead."

Some viruses\u2013including Lassa virus, which causes severe fever and bleeding\u2013also use the \u2018sticky\u2019 sugar modification of dystroglycan to bind to and invade cells, causing disease in humans. Understanding the structure of this complex, and how these sugar modifications are added to dystroglycan, could therefore help to develop treatments for a wide range of diseases like progressive muscle weakening and viral infections."

DG is composed of a cell-surface \u03b1-subunit and a transmembrane \u03b2-subunit. \u03b1-DG acts as a receptor for laminin-G domain-containing extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins such as laminin, agrin, perlecan and neurexin (<a href=\"#bib4\">Barresi and Campbell, 2006</a>).

Defects in the proper post-translational processing of \u03b1-DG result in loss of receptor function, and in a broad spectrum of congenital muscular dystrophies (CMDs) that are accompanied by a variety of brain and eye malformations. Collectively, these dystrophies are classified as dystroglycanopathies (<a href=\"#bib4\">Barresi and Campbell, 2006</a>).

Although LARGE is known to be a dual glycosyltransferase that synthesizes repeating units of [\u20133-xylose\u2013\u03b11,3-glucuronic acid-\u03b21\u2013] on \u03b1-DG, the identities of both the initiating sugar and the acceptor sugar for this laminin-binding polymer remained unknown. To determine which sugar is initially transferred by LARGE, we developed an in vitro glycosylation assay using a recombinant soluble (transmembrane domain deleted) form of LARGE (LARGEdTM) and the acceptor protein DGFc340. DGFc340 isolated from the culture medium of <i>Large</i><sup><i>myd</i></sup> (<i>Large</i>-deficient) MEFs lacks the LARGE modification on phosphorylated O-mannosyl glycans, and is hypothesized to terminate in a glycan acceptor structure that can be recognized by LARGE (<a href=\"#bib25\">Inamori et al., 2012</a>) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). To determine which of the sugars in the polymer is initially transferred by LARGE we incubated DGFc340 isolated from the <i>Large</i><sup><i>myd</i></sup> MEF culture medium with LARGEdTM and [<sup>14</sup>C]-labeled UDP-xylose (Xyl) and/or UDP-glucuronic acid (GlcA) radionucleotide sugar donors. The glycosyl-transfer reaction was measured as the transfer of radioactivity onto the DGFc340 acceptor glycoprotein. As negative control we used a DGFc340 mutant construct (T317A/T319A), which lacks the O-mannosylation sites that are the crucial acceptor platform for subsequent synthesis of the laminin-binding glycan (<a href=\"#bib24\">Hara et al., 2011</a>). When the radionucleotide sugars were tested individually in the LARGEdTM in vitro assay, the addition of [<sup>14</sup>C] UDP-Xyl, but not that of [<sup>14</sup>C] UDP-GlcA radionucleotides, resulted in radioactive labeling of the DGFc340 acceptor (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). However, in the presence of both UDP-Xyl and UDP-GlcA, the transfer of radioactivity was significantly increased consistent with the fact that the LARGE glycan is a heteropolysaccharide (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A/B</a>). These results indicate that xylose is the initial sugar transferred by LARGE, and that this is followed by the transfer of GlcA to form the repeating [\u20133-xylose\u2013\u03b11,3-glucuronic acid-\u03b21\u2013] heteropolymer."

LARGEdTM was able to efficiently modify DGFc340 from Pro5 (wild-type), Lec2 (CMP-sialic acid-deficient), Lec8 (UDP-galactose-deficient) and Lec13 (GDP-fucose-deficient) cells, suggesting that sialic acid, galactose and fucose do not contribute to functional glycosylation of \u03b1-DG (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). ldlD cells deficient for UDP-galactose (UDP-Gal) and UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine (UDP-GalNAc) demonstrated reduced acceptor activity for LARGEdTM, which can be explained by the fact that B3GALNT2 requires UDP-GalNAc for synthesis of the initial Core M3 structure. Similarly, DGFc340 from Lec15 cells, which are deficient for Dol-P-Man synthesis, did not serve as LARGEdTM acceptor because POMT1 (Protein <i>O</i>-mannosyltransferase) and POMT2 require the Dol-P-Man sugar donor to initiate the O-mannosyl Core M3 structure. Most interestingly, in the LARGEdTM in vitro assay DGFc340 from UDP-Xyl-deficient pgsI-208 CHO cells was not modified (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). It had also been shown that ectopic LARGE expression in pgsI-208 CHO cells did not induce \u03b1-DG hyperglycosylation (<a href=\"#bib25\">Inamori et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Ashikov et al., 2013</a>), consistent with the fact that UDP-Xyl is essential for synthesis of the LARGE glycan in vivo. However, in our LARGEdTM in vitro assay, pgsI-208 DGFc340 was also not modified by LARGEdTM, despite the presence of both of the required sugar nucleotides, UDP-GlcA and UDP-Xyl. This clearly demonstrated that one or more xylose residues are required on \u03b1-DG before it can be functionally glycosylated by LARGE (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>)."

Among the group of unassigned genes (<i>FKTN, FKRP, TMEM5, B4GAT1</i>) only the <i>B4GAT1</i> gene product showed homology to glucuronyl-transferases. In particular it shares 44% similarity with the LARGE GlcA-T (Glucuronyltransferase) domain (CAZy: GT49; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). This designated B4GAT1 as a promising candidate for the GlcA-T transferase upstream of LARGE. To test this hypothesis, we generated a 6xHis-tagged soluble construct of B4GAT1 (transmembrane domain deleted, B4GAT1dTM), expressed it in HEK293T cells and purified the recombinant enzyme from the culture medium (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We then conducted a transfer assay with B4GAT1dTM as the enzyme source, UDP-GlcA as the sugar donor and fluorescently labeled \u03b2-xyloside (4-methylumbelliferyl-\u03b2-D-xyloside, Xyl-\u03b2-MU) as the acceptor. The reaction products were separated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). A unique product peak was detected only when UDP-GlcA was used as donor (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). We also tested the acceptor specificity, which revealed that B4GAT1dTM GlcA-T activity has low preference for \u03b1-linked Xyl, but showed &gt;10- fold higher preference and specificity towards \u03b2-linked Xyl acceptors (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). The fact that the LARGE glycan disaccharide Xyl-\u03b11,3-GlcA-MU was a very weak acceptor for B4GAT1dTM GlcA-transfer suggests that B4GAT1 overexpression does not interfere with LARGE mediated synthesis of the laminin-binding glycan. A characterization of the B4GAT1 GlcA-T activity revealed a metal dependence for manganese (Mn<sup>2+</sup>) divalent cations (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>) and a pH-optimum near pH 7.0 (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>). The product peak obtained from the enzymatic reaction of B4GAT1dTM with \u03b2-Xyl-MU acceptor was isolated, and its analysis by NMR revealed that the GlcA residue was \u03b2-linked to the four position of the xylose \u03b2-MU (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 1</a>).

In the current study we found that a \u03b21,4-linked GlcA transferred by B4GAT1 serves as the acceptor glycan for initiation of synthesis of the LARGE glycan, via the addition of a xylose. To assess if LARGE can use one or the other glycosidic linkage \u03b2-linked GlcA acceptor with higher efficiency, we tested LARGEdTM Xyl-T activity on two disaccharides GlcA-\u03b21,4-Xyl-\u03b2-MU and GlcA-\u03b21,3-Xyl-\u03b1-MU along with the monosaccharide GlcA-\u03b2-MU (4-methylumbelliferyl-\u03b2-D-glucuronide). As shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>, LARGE did not distinguish between GlcA-\u03b21,3-Xyl and GlcA-\u03b21,4-Xyl, as similar activities were measured in the presence of both disaccharide acceptors. However, the length of the acceptor appears to be important, since the disaccharide acceptor showed 25-fold higher activity than the monosaccharide acceptor (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). In summary, it is currently unknown why the \u03b21,4-linked GlcA acceptor in the initial LARGE acceptor primer and the \u03b21,3-linked GlcA in the terminal LARGE glycan have different linkages, and how each linkage contributes spatially to the overall structure, while LARGE shows similar activity towards both acceptors."

Immunoblotting revealed that whereas control MEFs were positive for functional glycosylation of, and laminin-binding by, \u03b1-DG from <i>Large</i><sup><i>myd</i></sup> MEFs completely lacked both features (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Also, <i>B4gat1</i>-deficient MEFs demonstrated strongly reduced but detectable residual functional glycosylation and laminin binding, and normal levels of hypoglycosylated \u03b1-DG core protein (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Adenovirus-mediated ectopic expression of B4GAT1 did not affect the glycosylation status of \u03b1-DG in control and <i>Large</i><sup><i>myd</i></sup> MEFs but, as expected, was able to rescue the \u03b1-DG glycosylation defect in <i>B4gat1</i>-deficient MEFs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>).

In contrast, <i>B4gat1</i>-deficient cells showed only a low level of \u03b1-DG hyperglycosylation after LARGE overexpression (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), suggesting that in the context of mutant B4GAT1, only few acceptor sites for LARGE modification are available. Finally, ectopic co-expression of B4GAT1 and LARGE resulted in \u03b1-DG hyperglycosylation in all three tested MEF lines (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). This result is consistent with the hypothesis that B4GAT1 acts prior to the glycosyltransferase LARGE."

                                "text": "To date, several disease-causing <i>B4GAT1</i> (formerly termed <i>B3GNT1</i>) mutations have been reported in human patients (<a href=\"#bib11\">Buysse et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Shaheen et al., 2013</a>), in an N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU)-induced mutant mouse model (<a href=\"#bib58\">Wright et al., 2012</a>) and in a genetic screen for modifiers of LASV entry (<a href=\"#bib28\">Jae et al., 2013</a>). To test how reported <i>B4GAT1</i> missense mutations affect the intracellular localization of B4GAT1 and its enzymatic activity, we cloned three mutant B4GAT1-Myc expression constructs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>): Mut1 (N390D) represents a mutation identified in a patient with Walker-Warburg syndrome (<a href=\"#bib11\">Buysse et al., 2013</a>); Mut2 (D227N/D229N) is a mutation in the glycosyltransferase signature DXD motif (<a href=\"#bib54\">Wiggins and Munro, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bao et al., 2009</a>); and Mut3 (M155T) mimics a mutant allele identified in a <i>B4gat1</i>-deficient mouse model with axon guidance defects (<a href=\"#bib58\">Wright et al., 2012</a>). Immunoblot analysis confirmed that expression levels were similar for the Myc-tagged B4GAT1 control and all three mutant constructs Mut1-Mut3 in stably expressing HEK293T cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Previously, it had been shown that B4GAT1 localizes to the <i>trans</i>-Golgi near the TGN (<i>trans</i>-Golgi network) (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bao et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Lee et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Buysse et al., 2013</a>). In our immunofluorescence analysis, we found both the control and mutant construct Mut1 to exhibit normal Golgi localization and to co-localize with the Golgi marker Giantin (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). B4GAT1 mutations in constructs Mut2 and Mut3, however, resulted in a high degree of mislocalization to the ER, as judged by overlap of the signal with the ER marker ERp72 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>), indicating that the B4GAT1 mutant proteins are misfolded and retained in the ER. Analysis of B4GAT1 enzyme activity in lysates from cells stably overexpressing these constructs revealed strongly reduced activity in the cases of all three mutants, of less than 5% compared to activity levels in wild-type control (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). Similarly, none of the B4GAT1 mutant constructs was able to complement and rescue the \u03b1-DG glycosylation defect in <i>B4gat1</i>-deficient MEFs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>). These findings confirm that the identified B4GAT1 mutations are pathological and have a direct negative impact on B4GAT1 activity regardless of their subcellular localization. Additionally, the finding that the B4GAT1 DXD motif is essential further supports a role for B4GAT1 as a glycosyltransferase, since the DXD motif is thought to be involved in binding carbohydrate sugar-nucleoside diphosphates in manganese-dependent glycosyltransferases (<a href=\"#bib54\">Wiggins and Munro, 1998</a>)."

Similar to the LARGE acceptor experiment in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, we used radiolabeled [<sup>14</sup>C] UDP-GlcA sugar donor and measured transfer of [<sup>14</sup>C] to the protein A-bound DGFc340 acceptor. As expected, DGFc340 isolated from <i>B4gat1</i>-deficient cells was the only acceptor that incorporated substantial levels of the radioactive label (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). This confirmed that only the DGFc340 acceptor from <i>B4gat1</i>-deficient cells resembled the terminal acceptor glycan suitable for B4GAT1dTM to add GlcA. Our B4GAT1dTM in vitro enzyme assay demonstrated acceptor specificity for \u03b2-linked xylose (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). To corroborate the hypothesis that \u03b2-linked xylose also serves as the endogenous B4GAT1 \u03b1-DG acceptor we pre-treated DGFc340 from <i>B4gat1</i>-deficient cells with \u03b2-xylosidase and measured the transfer of [<sup>14</sup>C] GlcA by B4GAT1dTM. After \u03b2-xylosidase treatment, the ability of <i>B4gat1</i>-deficient DGFc340 to act as an acceptor was strongly reduced; this constitutes indirect evidence that a \u03b2-linked xylose is indeed the postulated endogenous acceptor for B4GAT1 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>), and that a yet unidentified xylosyltransferase acts upstream of B4GAT1."

The detection of the interglycosidic cross-peaks of BH1/AC4, CC1/BH3, and DH1/CC3 in the HMBC spectrum (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>) clearly indicates the presence of a 1\u21924 interglycosidic linkage between sugar residues B and A, a 1\u21923 interglycosidic linkage between residues C and B, and a 1\u21923 interglycosidic linkage between residues D and C, respectively. A strong rotating-frame Overhauser effect (ROE) was observed from the H1 to H3 and H5 protons of residues A, B, and D in the ROE spectroscopy (ROESY) spectrum (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>), demonstrating that they have a \u03b2-configuration. The observed strong ROE from the residue C H1 proton to its own H2, but not to H3 and/or H5 demonstrates that the residue C has an \u03b1-configuration. The inter-residue ROEs observed in the ROESY spectrum are also consistent with the interglycosidic linkage assignments determined from the HMBC spectrum.

We show that B4GAT1 is a xylose \u03b21,4-glucuronyltransferase, and that it is involved in synthesizing the glycan primer that subsequently can be elongated by LARGE with the ligand-binding glycan. B4GAT1 was initially cloned and described by Sasaki et al., (<a href=\"#bib48\">Sasaki et al., 1997</a>) as \u03b21,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (iGnT, \u03b23GNT1 or B3GNT1), which is essential for the synthesis of poly-N-acetyllactosamine. Furthermore, the B3GNT1 enzyme was proposed to contribute to the i antigen synthesis pathway by transferring N-acetylglucosamine onto a \u03b2-galactose acceptor with \u03b21,3 linkage (<a href=\"#bib48\">Sasaki et al., 1997</a>). In contrast our data reveal a \u03b21,4-glucuronyltransferase activity, which we have designated B4GAT1. We tested B4GAT1dTM with UDP-GlcNAc and the proposed Gal-\u03b21,4-GlcNAc-\u03b2-MU acceptor, but we were not able to validate any N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase activity (<a href=\"#fig3s4\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). Therefore, we propose to rename the enzyme B4GAT1, as a new member of the glucuronyltransferase family of proteins. To date, only 2 other enzymes are known to have \u03b21,4-glucuronyltransferase activity. These are EXT1 and EXT2, and both are involved in the synthesis of heparan sulphate proteoglycans (<a href=\"#bib36\">Lidholt and Lindahl, 1992</a>)."

Furthermore, in both cases assembly of the terminal heteropolymer glycan is initiated by a disaccharide primer, which is part of a larger glycan linker that anchors the polysaccharide to a protein backbone. Future studies are needed to elucidate the full \u03b1-DG glycan structure and determine the roles of the putative glycosyltransferases FKTN, FKRP and TMEM5 in anchoring the \u03b1-DG ligand-binding glycan moiety to the phosphorylated Core M3 structure. At this point it cannot be ruled out that other, currently unidentified, genes also contribute to synthesis of the functional \u03b1-DG glycan."

Proper \u03b1-DG glycosylation is essential for early embryonic development in the mouse, including formation of the basement membrane, as defects in the Reichert's membrane are the suspected cause of death in \u03b1-DG glycosylation-deficient mice (<a href=\"#bib57\">Williamson et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Willer et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Kurahashi et al., 2005</a>). However, an ENU-based genetic screen for abnormal CNS axonal tracks identified a viable <i>B4gat1</i> <i>(</i><i>B3gnt1</i><i>)</i> dystroglycanopathy mouse model carrying a p.M155T <i>B4gat1</i> mutation (<a href=\"#bib58\">Wright et al., 2012</a>). The majority of compound heterozygous mice with both a <i>LacZ</i> (<i>B4gat1</i><sup><i>LacZ</i></sup>) null allele and a hypomorphic p.M155T (<i>B4gat1</i><sup><i>M155T</i></sup>) allele die perinatally, but a few survive and develop a characteristic CMD phenotype. In this study we used MEFs isolated from the <i>B4gat1</i><sup><i>LacZ/M155T</i></sup> mice and measured endogenous B4GAT1 activity. As expected the <i>B4gat1</i>-deficient MEFs were hypomorphic, producing low-level residual B4GAT1 activity (&lt;3% relative to levels in wild-type control) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). This corroborates that our B4GAT1 assay can be a valuable diagnostic tool for measuring endogenous activity in patient cells and tissues. The residual B4GAT1 enzyme activity in the <i>B4gat1</i>-deficient MEFs was also reflected when the \u03b1-DG glycosylation status was analyzed biochemically, by immunoblotting. Although B4GAT1 endogenous activity was very low, it was sufficient to synthesize low amounts of functionally active \u03b1-DG that was capable of binding the ligand laminin (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). This finding accounts for the difference between the early embryonic lethal phenotype in <i>B4gat1</i> null (<i>B4gat1</i><sup><i>LacZ/LacZ</i></sup>) mice and the slightly milder phenotype in <i>B4gat1</i> hypomorphic (<i>B4gat1</i><sup><i>LacZ/M155T</i></sup>) mice (<a href=\"#bib58\">Wright et al., 2012</a>)."

To date, it is not fully understood what causes the tissue-specific differences in \u03b1-DG processing, which are reflected as differences in its molecular weight and its ability to bind laminin (<a href=\"#bib22\">Goddeeris et al., 2013</a>). LARGE, the key contributor to assembly of the terminal laminin-binding glycan, and B4GAT1 as the upstream priming enzyme are broadly expressed at the RNA level (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Although both genes are similarly expressed in most tissues they are strikingly different in heart with <i>LARGE</i> expression being high and <i>B4GAT1</i> being low. Based on published case reports it does not appear that <i>LARGE</i> patients (<a href=\"#bib39\">Longman et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Clarke et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Meilleur et al., 2014</a>) are more prone to cardiac defects than other dystroglycanopathy patients. Also lower <i>B4GAT1</i> expression in the heart does not present a significant bottleneck for \u03b1-DG functional glycosylation as heart \u03b1-DG has full ligand binding ability (<a href=\"#bib22\">Goddeeris et al., 2013</a>). Therefore, the functional consequences of such uncoordinated expression of <i>B4GAT1</i> and <i>LARGE</i> are currently unknown. It is more likely that other gene products involved in \u03b1-DG functional glycosylation can become limiting factors and that the integration of all involved players account for the tissue-specific differences of this complex and highly controlled synthesis pathway. Furthermore, whether \u03b1-DG that is not properly glycosylated possesses an as yet unidentified ligand binding activity remains unclear. LARGE has been shown to be highly tunable in the context of cancer, T-cell development and muscle regeneration (<a href=\"#bib16\">de Bernabe et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Liou et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Goddeeris et al., 2013</a>). Repression of <i>LARGE</i> expression is responsible for the defects in DG-mediated cell adhesion that are observed in epithelium-derived cancer cells, and point to a defect of its glycosylation as a factor in cancer progression (<a href=\"#bib16\">de Bernabe et al., 2009</a>). Similarly, it was demonstrated that expression of <i>B4GAT1</i> (<i>B3GNT1</i>) is absent in a IIH6-negative subpopulation (PC3-L) of an otherwise IIH6-positive human prostate cancer cell line (PC3). The loss of <i>B4GAT1</i> expression and laminin-binding by \u03b1-DG in these cells was inversely correlated with the observed malignancy and tumor progression of the prostate cancer when these cells were transplanted into SCID mice (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bao et al., 2009</a>). In general, these results emphasize that proper \u03b1-DG glycosylation plays a critical role in tumor suppression."

It was also hypothesized that B4GAT1 may regulate LARGE, as B4GAT1 overexpression promoted formation of the LARGE-generated laminin-binding glycan (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bao et al., 2009</a>). However, in light of data presented in this study, in particular the finding that endogenous LARGE activity is not affected in <i>B4gat1</i>-deficient cells and vice versa, it seems more likely that B4GAT1 and LARGE have independent enzyme activities (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B/C</a>)."

The goal was to show radioactive labeling of DGFc340 expressed in <i>B4gat1</i>-deficient MEFs with [3H]-xylose, which could subsequently be released by \u03b2-xylosidase treatment. However, this type of metabolic cell labeling proved to be technically challenging since only an insignificant amount (\u223c0.01%) of the total [3H]-xylose radioactivity was incorporated into the secreted DGFc340 fusion protein even after 4 day long-term labeling (data not shown). It is known that xylose uptake from the media into cells is poor (<a href=\"#bib50\">Snider et al., 2002</a>), which in our case becomes the limiting factor and made this experimental approach not feasible. Nevertheless, we feel confident that the sum of our indirect data including B4GAT1 Xyl-\u03b2-MU acceptor specificity (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>), pgsI-208 DGFc340 LARGE acceptor test (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>), \u03b2-xylosidase B4GAT1 acceptor treatment (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>) and finally the in vitro synthesis of a GlcA-\u03b21,3-Xyl-\u03b11,3-GlcA-\u03b21,4-Xyl-\u03b2-MU tetrasaccharide by the sequential action of B4GAT1 and LARGE (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>) provide strong and convincing evidence that \u03b2-xylose is indeed the endogenous acceptor for B4GAT1."

Many result from genetic defects in the formation of a novel GlcA-Xyl glycosaminoglycan (GAG), assembled by the LARGE glycosyltransferase on a trisaccahride-Man-PO4 containing core. Knowledge of this interesting and complex receptor glycan has been driven by the identification of a number of disease genes predicted to encode novel glycosyltransferases. However, the biochemical contributions of many of the gene products, and the nature of the linker between the GAG and the Man-PO4 core, remain unknown. This manuscript 1) identifies the final sugar of the linker as a beta-GlcA, 2) shows that the beta-GlcA becomes modified by the alpha-3-XylT activity of LARGE, 3) shows that Xyl contributes to the linker, and 4) provides strong evidence that the previously identified B3GNT1 disease gene is directly responsible for addition of beta-GlcA to the underlying core, possibly forming a GlcA(beta)1-4Xyl(beta)-linkage. Overall, this is a thorough and excellently documented piece of detective work to characterize the LARGE primer on alpha-DG, in which a role for B3GNT1/B4GAT1 is systematically built up first using small molecules, then an alpha-DG surrogate and alpha-DG itself. In addition, the new activity assigned to this gene will induce reinterpretation of the basis for its interesting cellular functions in cancer. Other interesting information regarding the roles of other GT-like genes, the biochemical and cellular effects of 3 B3GNT1/B4GAT1 disease mutations, and expression of B3GNT1/B4GAT1 RNA, is also presented. The paper would, however, be strengthened if the following issues are addressed."

However, there is a problem, because they do not directly demonstrate the presence of the disaccharide on native alpha-DG or DGFc340. Although they show that B3GNT1 is capable of catalyzing the transfer of GlcA from UDP-GlcA in beta-linkage to the 4 position of a beta-linked Xyl residue, this was carried out at high enzyme and substrate concentrations (ratio unspecified) that might drive alternative reactions that are not relevant at native concentrations in vivo (e.g.,: Lairson et al. (2006) Nat Chem Biol 2:724-8). While they convincingly showed that the enzyme has high selectivity toward UDP-GlcA relative to other potential donor substrates, they did not screen other possible acceptors. However, they did show that the B3GNT1 acceptor activity of DGFc340 from B3GNT1-deficient cells was inhibited by pretreatment with a commercial preparation of beta-xylosidase, but the enzyme concentration was high, release of Xyl was not verified, and alternative glycosidase activities were not excluded. Thus the conclusion that the sugar underlying GlcA is Xyl(beta) is based on converging lines of evidence that alone are rather soft. This conclusion will not be incontrovertible until the presence of the disaccharide on DGFc340 or alpha-DG is directly demonstrated, such as might be supported by mass spectrometry. The authors could quite easily label DGFc340 produced in B4GAT1 mutant MEFs with 3H-xylose, show that treatment of the captured DGFc340 substrate by beta-xylosidase releases 3H-xylose and destroys it as a substrate of recombinant B4GAT, and show that, once B4GALT1 has acted on untreated DGFc340, 3H-xylose can no longer be released by treatment with beta-xylosidase. If these data are not forthcoming (and this may well be), a qualification of their conclusions is warranted."

While it can be argued that the latter activity was also assigned based on indirect evidence, the authors did not adequately address the potential for beta-3-GlcNAc-transferase activity because they only tested Gal(beta)-MU as an acceptor, which is not a substrate, and did not test the preferred Gal(beta)1-4GlcNAc-. If it is not too difficult, they should try to clarify this directly. The authors should explain clearly at the beginning that their data will show that the gene called B3GNT1 in the literature, in fact encodes a glucuronisyltransferase and not an N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase as previously thought."

The data in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a> show that LARGE cannot override a defect in FKRP, FKTN, B4GAT1 or TMEM5. However, the latter does not mean that all these activities act prior to LARGE in cells. The evidence that B4GAT1 acts prior to LARGE is strong and described in the manuscript. It is also clear as shown later that LARGE acting in the absence of these activities in vitro can generate laminin binding glycans. However, one or more of the remaining three activities could potentially act after LARGE and be required to modify LARGE-generated glycans such that they become capable of binding to laminin or a different binding partner when LARGE is expressed at endogenous levels in vivo. Determining whether these activities act prior to or post LARGE is beyond the scope of this manuscript. However, the authors should qualify their conclusions with respect to <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> and the model in Figure 18."

We followed up with [3H] xylose labeling of DGFc340 in cells as suggested by the reviewers.

When we performed [3H] xylose metabolic cell labeling only \u223c0.01% of the total radioactivity was incorporated into the secreted DGFc340 fusion protein. We validated the presence of the DGFc340 and DGFc340mut fusion protein by Western Blot, however the radioactive labeling for DGFc340 and DGFc340mut expressed in B3gnt1-deficient MEFs were indistinguishable and not significant.

Indeed the tested Gal-b-MU is not the preferred acceptor substrate for the reported iGnT enzyme activity. To further validate our statement that B4GAT1 has no GlcNAc-transferase activity we synthesized and purified the hypothesized preferred substrate Gal-b1,4-GlcNAc-MU in vitro, confirmed it by NMR and tested it with B4GAT1dTM as acceptor for GlcNAc transferase activity. Using the same iGnT acceptor and enzyme conditions as described in Sasaki et al. (1997) we were not able to detect any enzyme product, further confirming that B4GAT1 does not have GlcNAc transferase activity and that the enzyme originally described as iGnT / B3GNT1 had been falsely assigned."

Patient studies have shown that all loss-of-function mutations in FKRP, FKTN, B4GAT1 and TMEM5 result in loss of aDG functional glycosylation and ligand binding. Furthermore it was demonstrated by Goddeeris et al., 2013 that the GlcA-Xyl heteropolymer synthesized by LARGE is sufficient for ligand binding. If any of the proteins in question would be involved in the post LARGE modification, mutations should not result in loss of ligand binding as the basic ligand binding LARGE glycan scaffold would still be preserved and present. Based on our current knowledge of the aDG functional glycosylation we feel that an involvement of FKRP, FKTN, B4GAT1 and/or TMEM5 in post LARGE glycan modification can be considered highly unlikely. We included a new <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> and added the following statement to the figure legend: \u201cThe putative glycosyltransferases B4GAT1 (B3GNT1), FKTN, FKRP and TMEM5 are proposed to act prior to LARGE, which adds a [GlcA-Xyl] heteropolymer that is responsible for ligand binding. However based on current knowledge it cannot be completely ruled out that they are involved in the modification of the LARGE glycan repeat itself to modulate ligand binding.\u201d"
