In this study, we report that the CIDE-N protein Drep-2 is a novel synaptic protein important for learning and behavioral adaptation. Drep-2 was found at synapses throughout the <i>Drosophila</i> brain and was strongly enriched at mushroom body input synapses. It was required within Kenyon cells for normal olfactory short- and intermediate-term memory. Drep-2 colocalized with metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs). Chronic pharmacological stimulation of mGluRs compensated for <i>drep-2</i> learning deficits, and <i>drep-2</i> and <i>mGluR</i> learning phenotypes behaved non-additively, suggesting that Drep 2 might be involved in effective mGluR signaling. In fact, <i>Drosophila</i> fragile X protein mutants, shown to benefit from attenuation of mGluR signaling, profited from the elimination of <i>drep-2</i>. Thus, Drep-2 is a novel regulatory synaptic factor, probably intersecting with metabotropic signaling and translational regulation."

In this study, we report that the CIDE-N protein Drep-2 is a novel synaptic protein important for learning and behavioral adaptation. Drep-2 was found at synapses throughout the <i>Drosophila</i> brain and was strongly enriched at mushroom body input synapses. It was required within Kenyon cells for normal olfactory short- and intermediate-term memory. Drep-2 colocalized with metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs). Chronic pharmacological stimulation of mGluRs compensated for <i>drep-2</i> learning deficits, and <i>drep-2</i> and <i>mGluR</i> learning phenotypes behaved non-additively, suggesting that Drep 2 might be involved in effective mGluR signaling. In fact, <i>Drosophila</i> fragile X protein mutants, shown to benefit from attenuation of mGluR signaling, profited from the elimination of <i>drep-2</i>. Thus, Drep-2 is a novel regulatory synaptic factor, probably intersecting with metabotropic signaling and translational regulation."

Metabotropic glutamate receptors and their signaling pathways are important for regulating certain changes to the synapses that mediate learning processes.

Stimulating the regulatory glutamate receptors with drugs helped to overcome learning deficits that result from the lack of Drep-2."

One of their targets is the DNase Dff40/CAD, which degrades DNA during apoptosis (<a href=\"#bib17\">Enari et al., 1998</a>). Dff40 is a member of the DNA fragmentation factor (Dff) family of proteins, characterized by CIDE-N domains that mediate protein\u2013protein interactions (<a href=\"#bib83\">Wu et al., 2008</a>). In <i>Drosophila</i>, four CIDE-N domain proteins were identified and named Dff related protein Drep-1 to Drep-4 (<a href=\"#bib30\">Inohara and Nu\u00f1ez, 1999</a>). Caspase-regulated Drep-4 is the ortholog of mammalian Dff40/CAD (<a href=\"#bib87\">Yokoyama et al., 2000</a>). Drep-4 is inhibited by Drep-1, the ortholog of Dff45/ICAD, which is also cleaved by caspases (<a href=\"#bib50\">Mukae et al., 2000</a>).

Among them, several proteins regulating translation were found: for example, the eIF4G-related, cap-independent translation initiation factor NAT1/p97/DAP5 (<a href=\"#bib42\">Levy-Strumpf et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Hundsdoerfer et al., 2005</a>) and Caprin, a dendritic translational repressor (<a href=\"#bib69\">Shiina et al., 2005</a>).

At these synapses, acetylcholine is released from PNs upon transmission of odor signals (<a href=\"#bib8\">Busto et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Gu and O'Dowd, 2006</a>). While elimination of Drep-2 in the whole animal severely impaired olfactory short-term and anesthesia-sensitive intermediate-term memory (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>), re-expression of Drep-2 restricted to KCs was sufficient to fully rescue these learning deficits. As sensation of electric shock, the unconditioned stimulus in aversive olfactory learning, is mediated via dopamine in the MB lobes (<a href=\"#bib2\">Aso et al., 2012</a>), Drep-2 most likely plays its role at PN::KC synapses during reception of the odor, the conditioned stimulus."

Which exact role this metabotropic signaling plays in synaptic plasticity processes at PN::KC synapses is essentially unknown. Motivated by the close match between Drep-2 and DmGluRA localization on the level of individual PSDs of the PN-KC synapse (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>), we started to address a potential functional connection between Drep-2 and DmGluRA-dependent signaling and behavior. We observed that the learning deficits of <i>dmGluRA</i> and <i>drep-2</i> single mutants did not add up to a stronger phenotype in double mutants (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). Moreover, the <i>drep-2</i> memory deficit was effectively rescued by pharmacological stimulation of DmGluRA (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Drep-2 might, therefore, affect plasticity processes downstream of DmGluRA. In this pathway, the protein could be required for extracting relevant aspects of the olfactory information (odor discrimination vs generalization) and thereby influence subsequent learning. Interestingly, preliminary experiments indicate that the learning deficits of <i>drep-2</i> mutants might involve decreased Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses in KCs (<i>not shown</i>)."

However, we did confirm the presence of the fragile X mental retardation protein FMRP in complexes containing Drep-2 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>).

We observed that only chronic activation of mGluRs starting during development could improve the learning scores of <i>drep-2</i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>).

Moreover, murine <i>fmr1</i> mutants showed exaggerated LTD, while the double mutant exhibited normal LTD. This demonstrated that synaptic proteins, if misregulated by either impaired or excessive mGluR-induced translation, impede appropriate LTD.

The STED and co-localization experiments played well with the genetic interactions with dFMR1 and mGluRA in olfactory learning and take this out of the realm of simply being a \u201cnew gene\u201d identification paper. However, after a long discussion amongst the reviewing editor and the three reviewers there was agreement that this version of the manuscript is not suitable for publication. The overall consensus was that the manuscript needs to be streamlined both in terms of the data that are presented and in terms of the interpretation of the experiments, especially the relationship of Drep2 to dFMR1 and mGluRA. While the central findings in the paper (localization, role in olfactory learning) are solid, the way the paper is structured, the numerous ancillary data sets and the unfocused discussion tend to distract from what could be a strong message. To some degree these might be considered cosmetic problems, but they make the study seem much weaker than it probably is and more importantly, the lack of clarity in the Discussion results in a somewhat misleading bottom line about Drep2 function."

The fact that the mutants do not show any appreciable level of initial courtship means that there was no opportunity for these males to actually learn since performance of courtship is required for training (the behavior has operant features). While the reintroduction of Drep2 rescues learning, it also rescues initial courtship meaning this experiment does not necessarily imply that Drep2 has a role in courtship learning, it could have simply allowed the animals to be trained. We recommend these data are removed since they are not central to the paper."

The alpha lobe imaging data were felt to be peripheral to the point of the paper, not because this would not be a valid way of looking at the mutant, but rather that the particular experiment the authors chose to do was not particularly relevant. Why look at the alpha lobes? Changes in Ca+2 and its function in learning is better understood elsewhere like the gamma lobes, and given the clear role of Drep2 in calyx why not look there? The alpha lobes are far downstream from the calyx and the presumptive site of Drep2 action, and probably not important for STM. It is not at all clear what the difference shown represents. The data as they stand could be removed, though the paper could conceivably be strengthened by addition of imaging from either gamma lobe or calyx."

The data strongly suggest that this interaction may happen early in development (or at least have an important developmental component) since rescue only works if the protein is present developmentally. The authors are encouraged to show the negative result with the adult-only rescue since this constrains models. While the current data make it impossible to posit a very specific model, the authors should at least give a cogent set of possibilities. As is, there is an implication in the paper that Drep2 may function like mGluR acutely and this is misleading."

The findings are significant and interesting. The work is technically impressive. The authors move from a protein with a completely unknown function, through a series of impressive localization studies that demonstrate enrichment around post-synaptic densities. They generate null alleles, and then use these alleles demonstrate a role for Drep-2 in alleles in associative short and intermediate term memory. Expression of Drep-2 in the mushroom body neurons is sufficient to rescue the memory phenotypes of the Drep-2 null alleles. Importantly, the authors show that the Drep-2 short term memory phenotype is also rescued by developmental activation of mGluRA receptors and by mutation of the dFMR1, demonstrating a genetic interaction with the proteins. The authors also perform proteomics to isolate the Drep-2 core network of interacting proteins, which include FRMP and several proteins involved in translational control. This work takes Drep-2 from an unknown function to a new component in the FMRP pathway regulating postsynaptic plasticity."

The null allele has a phenotype in each of these behaviors. In courtship conditioning and locomotor behavior, the authors do not show that the phenotype is due to the loss of Drep-2 through genetic rescue. Also in courtship conditioning, an unpublished automated system is used to score the many assays they have run. The median learning scores using this system are quite low and may miss many courtship behaviors. Alternatively, the assay set up may be suppressing courtship. The authors also do not provide any indications if hyperactivity can provide false positives for courtship with this system. Is it possible that hyperactive drep-2EX13 flies are not courting, and therefore not learning, but their high level of activity is somehow scored as courting behavior in this system?"

In the description of this experiment, the authors focused on Drep-2 expression in the ring neurons of the ellipsoid body\u2014the site of the homer requirement in ethanol sedation and tolerance. However, they never show that the Drep-2 is required in these neurons. When discussing the absence of an interaction with mGluRA, the authors should also cite the possibility that Drep-2 may be required outside of the ring neurons for normal levels of sedation. It is common to perform ethanol sedation experiments separately in males and female as the differences in body size lead to large differences in the rate of sedation. As far as I can tell, this was not done and there is no indication of whether the number of females/males was controlled between genotypes. The rate of sedation was so quick, that there may be a floor effect for the drep-2 mutants, which could confound the ability of ACPD to rescue this phenotype. Also, I am unclear of the status of the white gene in the mutant genotypes. The level of white activity can dramatically impact the rate of sedation (Chan, et al. 2014. Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research 38:1582-1593). It is highly unlikely that the rescue is due to increasing the copies of mini-white, but the authors need to indicate whether the mutants are in a w1118 or w+ background. Also the authors need to justify using frozen fly weight and not protein content as was done in Moore, et al., to normalize ethanol content in the absorption studies. Although, these experiments on ethanol sedation are potentially interesting and could add value to this manuscript, they are not necessary."

We, therefore, preferred using c305a-Gal4 here to simply avoid any possible confusion between pre- and postsynaptic specializations."

When discussing the absence of an interaction with mGluRA, the authors should also cite the possibility that Drep-2 may be required outside of the ring neurons for normal levels of sedation. It is common to perform ethanol sedation experiments separately in males and female as the differences in body size lead to large differences in the rate of sedation. As far as I can tell, this was not done and there is no indication of whether the number of females/males was controlled between genotypes. The rate of sedation was so quick, that there may be a floor effect for the drep-2 mutants, which could confound the ability of ACPD to rescue this phenotype</i>."

However, they carry a <i>mini-white</i> insertion on the second chromosome as a remnant of the p-elements used for generating the mutant. Therefore, <i>drep-2</i> mutants have red eyes.

We included two sets of controls for ethanol sedation experiments: one with white eyes and one with red eyes.
