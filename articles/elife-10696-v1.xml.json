Their function is well-understood during passive stimulation but, under natural behaving conditions, sense organs are under active, motor control. In an attempt to predict primary neuron firing under natural conditions of sensorimotor integration, we recorded from primary mechanosensory neurons of awake, head-fixed mice as they explored a pole with their whiskers, and simultaneously measured both whisker motion and forces with high-speed videography. Using Generalised Linear Models, we found that primary neuron responses were poorly predicted by whisker angle, but well-predicted by rotational forces acting on the whisker: both during touch and free-air whisker motion. These results are in apparent contrast to previous studies of passive stimulation, but could be reconciled by differences in the kinematics-force relationship between active and passive conditions. Thus, simple statistical models can predict rich neural activity elicited by natural, exploratory behaviour involving active movement of sense organs."

Their function is well-understood during passive stimulation but, under natural behaving conditions, sense organs are under active, motor control. In an attempt to predict primary neuron firing under natural conditions of sensorimotor integration, we recorded from primary mechanosensory neurons of awake, head-fixed mice as they explored a pole with their whiskers, and simultaneously measured both whisker motion and forces with high-speed videography. Using Generalised Linear Models, we found that primary neuron responses were poorly predicted by whisker angle, but well-predicted by rotational forces acting on the whisker: both during touch and free-air whisker motion. These results are in apparent contrast to previous studies of passive stimulation, but could be reconciled by differences in the kinematics-force relationship between active and passive conditions. Thus, simple statistical models can predict rich neural activity elicited by natural, exploratory behaviour involving active movement of sense organs."

However, accurate prediction is difficult without experimental control of stimulus parameters and, despite early studies of awake, behaving animals (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hubel, 1959</a>), subsequent work has most often effected experimental control by employing anaesthesia and/or passive stimulation. However, the active character of sensation (<a href=\"#bib15\">Gibson, 1962</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Yarbus, 1967</a>), based on motor control of the sense organs, is lost in reduced preparations. Recent methodological advances permit a way forward: in the whisker system, it is now possible to record neuronal activity from an awake mouse, actively exploring the environment with its whiskers, whilst simultaneously measuring the fundamental sensory variables (whisker kinematics and mechanics) likely to influence neuronal activity (<a href=\"#bib31\">O'Connor et al., 2010b</a>)."

Moment coding accounts for spiking during both whisker-object interaction and whisker motion in air. Moment coding can also account for findings in previous studies of passive stimulation in the anaesthetized animal; indicating that the same biomechanical framework can account for primary somatosensory neuron responses across diverse states. Our results provide a mechanical basis for linking receptor mechanisms to tactile behaviour."

At the same time, we recorded whisker motion and whisker shape using high-speed videography (1000 frames/s; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). As detailed below, PWNs were diverse, with some responding only to touch, others also to whisker motion. Since each PWN innervates a single whisker follicle, we tracked the \u2018principal whisker\u2019 of each recorded unit from frame to frame, and extracted both the angle and curvature of the principal whisker in each video frame (total 1,496,033 frames; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B\u2013E</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Bale et al., 2015</a>). Whiskers are intrinsically curved, and the bending moment on a whisker is proportional to how much this curvature changes due to object contact (<a href=\"#bib8\">Birdwell et al., 2007</a>): we therefore used \u2018curvature change\u2019 as a proxy for bending moment (<a href=\"#bib30\">O'Connor et al., 2010a</a>). Whisker-pole contacts caused substantial whisker bending (curvature change), partially correlated with the whisker angle (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1E</a>, <a href=\"#fig4\">4E</a>) and, consistent with <a href=\"#bib53\">Szwed et al.

This is a stringent, single-trial measure of model prediction performance (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). We then repeated this entire procedure for the whisker curvature time series. Although angle GLMs predicted spike trains of a few units moderately well (2/20 units had PCC &gt; 0.5), they performed poorly for the majority (median PCC 0.06, IQR 0.019\u20130.3; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B\u2013D</a>, orange). This was unlikely to be because of non-linear tuning to whisker angle, since quadratic GLMs fared only marginally better (median PCC 0.097, IQR 0.042\u20130.31; p=0.044, signed-rank test, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). In contrast, we found that, at the population level, the curvature GLMs were substantially more accurate than the angle GLMs (median PCC 0.52, IQR 0.22\u20130.66; p=0.0044, signed-rank test; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B\u2013D</a>, blue) with prediction accuracy up to PCC 0.88. Curvature GLMs also predicted spikes during touch episodes significantly more accurately (median PCC 0.57, IQR 0.23\u20130.72) than did angle GLMs during non-touch episodes (median 0.06, IQR 0.02\u20130.35; p=0.005, signed-rank test). At the level of individual units, 90% had above chance PCC and we termed these \u2018curvature-sensitive\u2019 (Materials and methods). Of the curvature-sensitive units, 61% were sensitive to positive curvature change and 39% to negative curvature change (Materials and methods)."

We wondered whether the discrepancy might be due to differences in whisker mechanics between passive and active stimulation conditions. To test this, we analysed the relationship between angle and curvature change during active touch and compared it to that during passive whisker stimulation. During active pole exploration, angle and curvature change were, over all, only loosely related (median correlation coefficient 0.20, IQR 0.079\u20130.39, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4D\u2013E</a>).

Theories of sensory encoding suggest that neural circuits have evolved to operate efficiently under natural conditions (<a href=\"#bib50\">Simoncelli and Olshausen, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Reinagel, 2001</a>). Previous studies have succeeded in predicting/decoding spikes evoked by passive presentation of natural sensory stimuli to anaesthetised/immobilised animals (<a href=\"#bib25\">Lewen et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Arabzadeh et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Pillow et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Mante et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Lottem and Azouz, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bale et al., 2013</a>), but it has been difficult to extend this approach to encompass natural, active movement of the sense organs. Here, we have addressed this general issue, taking advantage of experimental possibilities recently created in the whisker system (<a href=\"#bib30\">O'Connor et al., 2010a</a>), and the ability of computational methods, such as GLMs, to uncover stimulus-response relationships even from data with complex statistical structure (<a href=\"#bib33\">Paninski et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Fairhall and Sompolinsky, 2014</a>). Our main finding was that responses of PWNs, recorded as an awake mouse actively explores an object with its whiskers, can be predicted from the forces acting on the whiskers. Given that, for each unit, we were attempting to predict the entire ~70\u2009s time course of activity, the variability of the behaviour of untrained mice (<a href=\"#bib30\">O'Connor et al., 2010a</a>), and the lack of trial-averaging as a noise reduction strategy, it is remarkable that we found model prediction correlation coefficients up to 0.88. A challenge of studying neural coding under unconstrained, awake conditions is that sensory variables tend to correlate. A valuable feature of the GLM training procedure is that it takes such correlations into account. We found that, although whisker angle predicted spikes for a subset of units, this effect was very largely explained by a curvature-coding model, together with the correlation between angle and curvature."

In apparent contrast, previous studies using passive stimulation in anaesthetised animals have consistently reported a tight relationship between whisker kinematics and PWN response. In the cantilever whisker model, passively induced changes in whisker angle correlate highly with whisker bending. We confirmed that this applies to real whiskers in vivo and demonstrate that moment-sensitive units can thereby appear angle-tuned. In this way, moment-encoding can account for primary neuron responses not only during active touch but also under passive stimulation.

The silicone seal was removed and a 3/4 shank tungsten microelectrode array (FHC,\u00a0Bowdoin,\u00a0ME, recording electrodes 8\u00a0M\u03a9 at 1\u00a0kHz, reference 1\u00a0M\u03a9; tip spacing ~500 \u03bcm) was lowered through the brain (angle 4\u00b0 to vertical in the coronal plane) using a micromanipulator (PatchStar,\u00a0Scientifica, Uckfield,\u00a0UK) under isoflurane anaesthesia. Extracellular potentials were pre-amplified, digitised (24.4 kHz), filtered (band pass 300\u20133000\u2009Hz) and acquired continuously to hard disk (RZ5,\u00a0TDT). The trigeminal ganglion was encountered 6\u20137 mm vertically below the pial surface and whisker-response units identified by manual deflection of the whiskers with a small probe. Once a well-isolated unit was found, the whisker that it innervated (the \u2018principal whisker\u2019, PW) was identified by manual stimulation. To define the PW, we deflected not only untrimmed whiskers, but also the stubs of the trimmed whiskers. Any unit whose PW was a trimmed whisker was ignored. At this point, anaesthesia was discontinued. Once the mouse was awake, we recorded neuronal activity during repeated presentations of the pole (\u2018trials\u2019). Before the start of each trial, the pole was in the down position, out of reach of the whiskers. The pole was first moved anterior-posteriorly to a position chosen randomly out of a set of 11 possible positions, spanning a range \u00b1 6 mm with respect to the resting position of the base of the PW. A trial was initiated by activating the pneumatic slide relay, thus moving the pole up into the whisker field, where it remained for 3\u00a0s before being lowered. At the end of a recording session, the microelectrode array was withdrawn, the craniotomy sealed with silicone elastomer, and the mouse returned to its home cage."

However, since neurons in the ganglion innervate individual whiskers, it is sufficient to track only one whisker (the PW) for each recorded neuron. To extract kinematic/mechanical whisker information, we therefore developed a whisker tracker (\u2018WhiskerMan\u2019; <a href=\"#bib4\">Bale et al., 2015</a>) whose design criteria, different to those of other trackers (<a href=\"#bib37\">Perkon et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Clack et al., 2012</a>), were to: (1) be robust to whisker cross-over events; (2) track a single, target whisker; (3) track the proximal segment of the whisker shaft. The shape of the target whisker segment was described by a quadratic Bezier curve <b>r</b>(<i>t,s</i>) (a good approximation away from the zone of whisker-object contact; <a href=\"#bib45\">Quist and Hartmann, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Pammer et al., 2013</a>): <b>r</b>(<i>t,s</i>) = [<i>x(t,s), y(t,s</i>)], where <i>x, y</i> are horizontal/vertical coordinates of the image, <i>s =</i> [0,..,1] parameterises (<i>x,y</i>) location along the curve and <i>t</i> is time. We fitted such a Bezier curve to the target whisker in each image frame using a local, gradient-based search. The initial conditions for the search were determined by extrapolating the solution curves from the previous two frames, assuming locally constant, angular velocity. The combination of the low-parameter whisker description and the targeted, local search made the algorithm robust to whisker cross-over events. The \u2018base\u2019 of the target whisker was defined as the intersection between the extrapolated Bezier curve and the snout contour (estimated as described in <a href=\"#bib4\">Bale et al., 2015</a>). The solution curve in each frame was visually checked and the curves manually adjusted to correct occasional errors."

Amplitudes were discretised (30 equi-populated bins) and the spiking data used to compute amplitude tuning functions. Phases for bins where the amplitude exceeded a given threshold were discretised (8 equi-populated bins) and used to construct phase tuning functions. To determine whether a unit was significantly amplitude-tuned, we fitted a regression line to its amplitude tuning curve and tested whether the slope was statistically significantly different to 0 (p=0.0025, Bonferroni-corrected). To determine whether a unit was significantly phase-tuned, we computed the maximum value of its phase tuning curve and compared this to the distribution of maxima of chance tuning functions. Chance tuning functions were obtained by randomly shifting the recorded spike sequences by 3000\u20138000 ms and recomputing tuning functions (500 times). A unit was considered phase-tuned if its tuning function maximum (computed using amplitude threshold of 2\u00b0) exceeded the 95th percentile of the shuffled distribution."

For all units, model prediction performance on the test set was robust to variation of <i>\u03b1</i> over several orders of magnitude: <i>\u03b1</i> was therefore set to a standard value of 0.01. To quantify the performance of the model, the sensory time series of the testing set was used as input to the best-fitting GLM to generate a \u2018predicted\u2019 spike train in response. Both real and predicted spike trains were then smoothed by convolution with a 100 ms box-car filter and the similarity between them quantified by the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC). For each unit, the entire training/testing procedure was repeated for 10 random choices of training/testing set and the final prediction accuracy defined as the median of the 10 resulting PCC values. Data from these 10 samples were also used to test whether an individual unit exhibited statistically significant prediction performance for different sensory features. To test whether the results were robust to the smoothing time-scale, the above procedure was repeated for a range of box-car smoothing filters (1, 5, 10, 20, 50, 70 ms). To test whether a given \u2018actual\u2019 PCC was statistically significant, we tested the null hypothesis that it could be explained by random firing at the same time-averaged rate as that of the recorded unit. To this end, the recorded spike sequences were randomly shifted by 3000\u20138000 ms and the training/testing procedure above applied to this surrogate data. This was repeated 10 times and the resulting chance PCCs compared to the actual PCC using a signed-rank test, p=0.0025 (Bonferroni-corrected). This analysis was used to classify units as being \u2018curvature-sensitive\u2019."

Parameters <math id=\"inf42\"><mo>(</mo><mover><mi>h</mi><mo>\u2192</mo></mover><mo>,</mo><mo>\u00a0</mo><mi>b</mi><mo>,</mo><mo>\u00a0</mo><mi>\u03b3</mi><mo>)</mo></math> were adjusted to produce two spike trains (one for training, the other for testing) with a realistic white noise induced firing rate (~50 spikes/s; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bale et al., 2013</a>). We then attempted to predict the simulated, curvature-evoked (training) spike train by fitting GLMs (length 5 stimulus filter, 8 free parameters) using as input either angle or curvature change. Cross-validated model accuracy was computed as the PCC between the predicted spike train and the testing spike train (both smoothed by convolution with a 5 ms box-car)."

Since the random component of a neuron\u2019s response is inherently unpredictable, the best any model can do is to predict the probability of the spike train. To enable this, encoding models have generally (with few exceptions; <a href=\"#bib35\">Park et al., 2014</a>) been applied to a \u2018repeated-trials\u2019 paradigm, where a stimulus sequence (e.g., frozen white noise) is repeated on multiple \u2018trials\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib2\">Arabzadeh et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Lottem and Azouz, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bale et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Petersen et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Pillow et al., 2008</a>). Model accuracy can then be quantified, largely free of contamination from random response variability, by comparing (using PCC or otherwise) the trial-averaged response of the model to the trial-averaged response of the neuron."

By simulating the response of model neurons, we could deliver identical, repeated trials and thereby compare model prediction performance by a metric based on trial-averaging with that based on the single-trial approach. To this end, for each recorded unit, we used the best-fitting curvature change GLM to generate 100 trials of spike trains evoked by the curvature time series measured for that unit. Data from the first of these trials was used to fit the parameters of a minimal \u2018refitted GLM\u2019 (stimulus filter length 1, spike history filter length 2; bias; total 4 free parameters), and the single-trial performance quantified, using the approach of the main text (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>, left). Next, we used the refitted GLM to generate 100 repeated trials of spike trains evoked by the curvature time series. Repeated-trials performance was then quantified as the PCC between PSTHs obtained by trial-averaging (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>, right)."

Thus a study of parameters that lead to spiking in the awake case would be a welcome contribution to the vibrissa field.

Related to this is a need to re-evaluate claims, as noted by reviewer 3 \"[\u2026]only 50% of the data shows a drop in performance when angle is used instead of curvature. The other 50% seems to perform as well for angle as it does for curvature. The conclusion that curvature is therefore the single most important parameter seems not to be supported by the data.\" This requires reanalysis, yet also may require some additional data to increase the spike count."

It would be thus imperative for the author to show the feature vector and the history term for at least a few units, as opposed to just predictions. In fact, the feature vector is a main point of such an analysis. Further, while the recorded data show clear cycle-by-cycle whisks (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>), and \"whisking\" cells in the trigeminal ganglion faithfully respond on a cycle-by-cycle basis, these fast changes do not appear in the predicted spike rates of <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>.

But it is known that touch dominates PWN spiking responses, so including touch periods when assessing angle GLM decoding will trivially result in very low GLM angle performance. More interesting would be comparing the performance of angle GLMs during non-touch, free whisking periods with performance of curvature GLMs during touch periods.\" The critical issue is to determine if there is a big difference between passive and active states or if, within strong statistics, there is not a big difference. This requires reanalysis, yet also may require some additional data to increase the spike count."

There are 2 problems with it. One, portions of the pad rotate with significant angles during active whisking such that the absolute angle of a whisker changes but this has no effect on the shaft-follicle mechanical interactions (the entire complex moves together). This can be seen in the supplementary video of the paper, when examining the pad. Thus, the angle should be measured relative to the pad surrounding the whisker and not to the fixed head. Second, the relevant angular variable in the sensory coding game is most likely the <i>change</i> in angle upon contact. Both the \"push angle\" (Quist and Hartman, 2012; Bagdasarian et al., 2013) and the \"Angle absorption\" (Bagdasarian et al., 2013) carry meaningful information. This analysis of relative angular changes upon touch will also make the angle-curvature comparison more symmetric (currently the change in curvature upon touch is compared with the absolute angle)."

(2003), the former respond to whisking in air and are sensitive to the phase of whisking and the latter respond to touch and are sensitive to curvature changes. This fact should be described at the outset (Abstract, Introduction, Discussion) and compared with the relevant previous reports."

In fact, the insisting on a single mechanical variable does not make much sense, is not convincing and, as said, is not consistent with the data presented in the paper. I strongly recommend re-considering it. First, the paper shows that half of the cells (the whisking cells) are actually sensitive to a kinematic variable, acceleration. Indeed, it is associated with force but aren't all kinematic changes associated with forces? Also, selecting whisker acceleration instead of other angular variables, such as phase and velocity, and even angle itself, seems to be arbitrary. As for the Touch cells, indeed the curvature is correlated with various angular variables, but the parameters of these correlations depend on the interactions with external objects (see Bagdasarian et al., 2013), interactions that are not investigated here. In fact, Bagdasarian et al. showed that relying on a single mechanical variable must lead to ambiguity about external features."

Analysis at higher temporal resolutions (as was impressively done by the Petersen lab previously) is probably not possible in the current challenging setup of TG recording in awake animals. Yet, perceptual processing depends crucially on within-cycle millisecond time scales. This should be emphasized at the outset and discussed in relation to candidate sensory variables and relevant external features.

In Bale (2013), again the positional tuning was in the context of positional deflection not free whisking angle. Indeed, Leiser (2007) showed that firing rates are 10x higher in PWNs during contact than during awake free whisking.

This can be seen in the supplementary video of the paper, when examining the pad. Thus, the angle should be measured relative to the pad surrounding the whisker and not to the fixed head.

Indeed, it is associated with force but aren't all kinematic changes associated with forces? Also, selecting whisker acceleration instead of other angular variables, such as phase and velocity, and even angle itself, seems to be arbitrary. As for the Touch cells, indeed the curvature is correlated with various angular variables, but the parameters of these correlations depend on the interactions with external objects (see Bagdasarian et al., 2013), interactions that are not investigated here.

Our aim was to assess the influence of two types of rotational force (moment) on PWN activity: first, the moment associated with whisking bending; second, the moment associated with whisker motion. We did this by means of proxies. We used curvature as a proxy for bending moment, since bending moment is closely related to the curvature of a whisker at its base (Birdwell et al. 2007). We used angular acceleration as a proxy for the rotational force acting on the follicle during whisker self-motion, since, through the rotational form of Newton\u2019s second law, these two quantities are proportional, under our experimental conditions (Quist et al. 2014). For this reason, we argue that our choice to use acceleration for our analysis is not arbitrary, but well-motivated by the physics. As the reviewer points out, angular acceleration is a kinematic variable but, in the sense that it is a proxy for moment, it can also be considered a \u201cmechanical\u201d variable.

In this way, one can make very precise measurements of the variability in spike timing (jitter) from trial to trial: noise is attenuated by trial-averaging. As the reviewer correctly implies, it is difficult to analyze the dynamics of coding on the ms time-scale in the awake, behaving animal. In the awake, actively whisking rodent, there are no precisely repeated trials and trial-averaging is not an available option. As we show in <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>, the lack of repeated trials was a limiting factor for model prediction accuracy in our study.

Nevertheless, if we understand correctly, the reviewer\u2019s concern is with the sensitivity of PWNs to smaller curvatures. We can address this point, since our dataset contains a wide range of curvature change values, by constructing tuning curves.

As we discuss in the manuscript (subsection \u201cMechanical framework for tactile coding\u201d, first paragraph), Hartmann and colleagues (Solomon and Hartmann 2006; Birdwell et al. 2007) proposed that the evidence that PWNs respond to touch (Szwed et al. 2003; 2006) could, in principle, be explained by the hypothesis that mechanoreceptors in the follicle are sensitive to whisker bending moment. However, before our work, no study had ever directly tested the theory by simultaneously measuring both PWN activity and whisker reaction forces. This is significant, since the theory makes simplifying approximations and assumptions (for example, concerning boundary conditions) that it is unsafe to assume will necessarily hold in the awake, behaving animal. Since the whisker system is an important model in neuroscience, we argue that this was a major gap in the literature and that our study makes a substantial contribution to putting our general understanding of somatosensory coding on a more solid, mechanical basis."

The classic studies refer to PWN tuning to angle of deflection not absolute angle. These particular studies had no ability to assess PWN tuning in the absence of deflection. In Bale (2013), again the positional tuning was in the context of positional deflection not free whisking angle. Indeed, Leiser (2007) showed that firing rates are 10x higher in PWNs during contact than during awake free whisking. The logical interpretation of this and many other cited studies of PWN coding is that deflection-induced forces (often quantified as deflection angle) are the primary driver of PWN spiking, not whisker position absent deflection.</i> We agree with the reviewer that passive whisker stimulation can be understood from a force-encoding point of view and we accept that the quoted sentence from the original submission (\u201cat odds with[\u2026]\u201d) lacked nuance.

With passive stimulation, whisker angle (more precisely, change in whisker angle with respect to a whisker\u2019s resting angle) correlates with firing rate (Zucker and Welker 1969; Gibson and Welker 1983; Lichtenstein et al. 1990; Jones et al. 2004; Arabzadeh et al. 2005; Bale and Petersen 2009; Lottem and Azouz 2011; Bale et al. 2013) whereas, in our data, whisker angle did not predict PWN firing rate. Thus, apparently the same variable exerts different effects under the two conditions. The reason that this is not actually a contradiction (consistent with the reviewer\u2019s remark) is, as we show, that passive stimulation does not just change whisker angle but also bends the whisker (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). This characteristic has, however, not been widely appreciated: passive stimulation is usually carried out on shortened whiskers, which are so stiff that the bending is hard to detect unless, as here, measured with high-resolution imaging."
