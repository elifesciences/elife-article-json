Integrative genomic analysis, combining global occupancy of Lsd1, genome-wide analysis of its substrates H3K4 monomethylation and dimethylation, and gene expression profiling, reveals that Lsd1 represses hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) gene expression programs during hematopoietic differentiation. We found that Lsd1 acts at transcription start sites, as well as enhancer regions. Loss of Lsd1 was associated with increased H3K4me1 and H3K4me2 methylation on HSPC genes and gene derepression. Failure to fully silence HSPC genes compromised differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells as well as mature blood cell lineages. Collectively, our data indicate that Lsd1-mediated concurrent repression of enhancer and promoter activity of stem and progenitor cell genes is a pivotal epigenetic mechanism required for proper hematopoietic maturation."

Integrative genomic analysis, combining global occupancy of Lsd1, genome-wide analysis of its substrates H3K4 monomethylation and dimethylation, and gene expression profiling, reveals that Lsd1 represses hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) gene expression programs during hematopoietic differentiation. We found that Lsd1 acts at transcription start sites, as well as enhancer regions. Loss of Lsd1 was associated with increased H3K4me1 and H3K4me2 methylation on HSPC genes and gene derepression. Failure to fully silence HSPC genes compromised differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells as well as mature blood cell lineages. Collectively, our data indicate that Lsd1-mediated concurrent repression of enhancer and promoter activity of stem and progenitor cell genes is a pivotal epigenetic mechanism required for proper hematopoietic maturation."

For example, DNA is wrapped around histone proteins and the addition of a methyl group to these proteins, a process known as histone methylation, can increase the expression of a gene, whereas the removal of a methyl group (demethylation) can repress gene expression. Lysine-specific demethylase 1 (Lsd1) is an enzyme that is known to mediate the demethylation of lysine amino acids on histone proteins. The role of Lsd1 in embryonic stem cells has been widely studied, and deletion of the gene that codes for Lsd1 is known to result in the death of mice embryos. However, very little is known about its roles in the later stages of mammalian development."

While active promoters are typically marked by dimethylation and trimethylation at Lys4 of histone H3 (H3K4) around transcriptional start sites (TSS), enhancer elements are characterized by high levels of H3K4 monomethylation and low levels of H3K4 trimethylation (<a href=\"#bib16\">Heintzman et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Koch et al., 2007</a>). The regulation of lysine methyl modifications is a dynamic process, tightly controlled by the opposing forces of lysine methyltransferases (KMTs) and lysine demethylases (KDMs). Histone monomethylation, dimethylation, and trimethylation of H3K4 are mediated by a group of SET domain-containing lysine methyltransferases, for example, MLL1-5 and ASH1 (<a href=\"#bib43\">Ruthenburg et al., 2007</a>). Among KDMs, KDM2B is restricted to removal of trimethylated H3K4, whereas the KDM5 family (KDM5 A\u2013D) and NO66 demethylate H3K4me2/3 (<a href=\"#bib5\">Cloos et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Lan et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Kooistra and Helin, 2012</a>). Lysine-specific demethylase 1 (Lsd1/KDM1A) and its homolog KDM1B, however, demethylate monomethylated and dimethylated H3K4, but not H3K4me3 (<a href=\"#bib48\">Shi et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib4a\">Ciccone et al., 2009</a>). Hence, Lsd1/KDM1A and KDM1B are the only KDMs known with substrate specificity for H3K4me1, a crucial enhancer mark. Lsd1 mediates its repressive functions as part of the CoREST (corepressor for element-1-silencing transcription factor; <a href=\"#bib31\">Lee et al., 2005</a>) or NuRD (nucleosome remodeling and histone deacetylation; <a href=\"#bib57\">Wang et al., 2009b</a>) repressor complexes, but has also been implicated in gene activation, however, only when in complex with androgen or estrogen receptors through demethylation of H3K9me1/me2 (<a href=\"#bib36\">Metzger et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Ruthenburg et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Wissmann et al., 2007</a>)."

Targeted deletion of Lsd1 in mice is lethal. In Lsd1<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> embryos, the egg cylinder fails to elongate and gastrulate, resulting in developmental arrest around embryonic day (E) 5.5 and loss of Lsd1<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> embryos by E7.5 (<a href=\"#bib55\">Wang et al., 2007</a>, <a href=\"#bib55\">2009a</a>).

Injection of Lsd1<sup>fl/fl</sup> and Lsd1<sup>fl/fl</sup> Mx1Cre mice with the dsRNA poly(I:C) (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>) resulted in efficient Lsd1 inactivation and a massive reduction in peripheral blood counts (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B\u2013D</a>). In keeping with this, the majority of Lsd1<sup>fl/fl</sup> Mx1Cre mice died with severe anemia 7\u201310 days after the final dose (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). As in Lsd1<sup>fl/fl</sup> VavCre animals, Lsd1<sup>fl/fl</sup> Mx1Cre animals were largely deficient in LS<sup>+</sup>K<sup>+</sup> as well as LS<sup>\u2212</sup>K<sup>+</sup> cells, again at the expense of LS<sup>+</sup>K<sup>\u2212</sup> cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). We suspected that loss of Lsd1 might alter the immunophenotype of stem and progenitor cells and therefore adopted an additional FACS-gating strategy to allow the potential identification of LT-HSCs. We inverted the commonly used stem cell gating strategy (i.e., LS<sup>+</sup>K<sup>+</sup> CD150<sup>+</sup> CD48<sup>\u2212</sup>), by first gating on lineage-negative CD150<sup>+</sup> CD48<sup>\u2212</sup> cells, succeeded by Sca-1 and c-Kit analysis. With this approach, we identified a population of cells in Lsd1 knockout animals, resembling immunophenotypic LT-HSCs, albeit with slightly decreased c-Kit expression levels (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Interestingly, the frequency of Lsd1 knockout lin<sup>\u2212</sup> CD150<sup>+</sup> CD48<sup>\u2212</sup> Sca-1<sup>+</sup> c-Kit<sup>+</sup> cells was increased about fourfold (p\u22640.001).

This suggests compensatory LT-HSC expansion due to downstream differentiation defects. We isolated Lsd1<sup>fl/fl</sup> and Lsd1<sup>fl/fl</sup> Mx1Cre LT-HSCs, assessed Lsd1 mRNA expression levels by qPCR, and validated that Lsd1<sup>fl/fl</sup> Mx1Cre LT-HSCs had Lsd1 deleted and did not represent Lsd1<sup>fl/fl</sup> Mx1Cre cells that had escaped excision (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>)."

We profiled single Lsd1 knockout LT-HSCs for &gt;30 cell surface markers by highly multiplexed microfluidics qPCR (for complete gene list and data set, see <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>; <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1</a>). We further applied this method to determine whether immunophenotypically altered myeloid progenitor cells, such as granulocyte macrophage progenitors (GMPs), were concealed in the Lsd1<sup>fl/fl</sup> Mx1Cre LS<sup>+</sup>K<sup>\u2212</sup> cell population, and if not, to categorize these cells. We performed hierarchical clustering of the resulting gene expression matrices of Lsd1 knockout LT-HSCs and LS<sup>+</sup>K<sup>\u2212</sup> cells, with data sets consisting of \u223c30 defined wild-type hematopoietic cell types also characterized by multiplexed microfluidics qPCR (Guo et al., complete data set will be published elsewhere). Lsd1<sup>fl/fl</sup> Mx1Cre LT-HSCs clustered closest with wild-type LT-HSCs, further substantiating that knockout lin<sup>\u2212</sup> CD150<sup>+</sup> CD48<sup>\u2212</sup> Sca-1<sup>+</sup> c-Kit<sup>+</sup> cells represent authentic LT-HSCs (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2E,F</a>; LT-HSC cluster).

However, about 50% of knockout LS<sup>+</sup>K<sup>\u2212</sup> cells displayed features of plasmacytoid dendritic cells, characterized by high expression of toll-like receptor 9 and leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (<a href=\"#bib11\">Guiducci, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Heng et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"http://www.immgen.org\">http://www.immgen.org</a>).

LT-HSCs from control and Lsd1<sup>fl/fl</sup> Mx1Cre animals were purified prior to Lsd1 deletion. This strategy ensured that control and Lsd1<sup>fl/fl</sup> Mx1Cre cells would be comparable (i.e., immunophenotypically identical LT-HSCs). To delete Lsd1 in vitro, we added interferon alpha (IFN\u03b1) to control and Lsd1<sup>fl/fl</sup> Mx1Cre cultures (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>), and although colony numbers were comparable between Lsd1 knockout and control, stark differences in colony and cell morphology were observed (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D,F</a>). Control LT-HSCs generated large colonies of multipotential granulocyte, erythroid, macrophage, and megakaryocyte progenitor identity (CFU-GEMM), whereas Lsd1-deficient colonies were smaller and consisted almost exclusively of immature blasts. Lsd1 knockout colonies primarily consisted of lineage-negative c-Kit<sup>+</sup> Sca-1<sup>+</sup> hematopoietic progenitor cells, whereas wild-type colonies were largely composed of mature Gr1<sup>+</sup> Mac1<sup>+</sup> myeloid cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E,G\u2013J</a>). Together, the absence of LS<sup>\u2212</sup>K<sup>+</sup> myeloid progenitors determined by flow cytometry, the single cell multiplex qPCR immunoprofiling data, and colony assays indicate that Lsd1 function is vital for efficient differentiation of LT-HSCs into more mature myeloid progenitor cells."

After poly(I:C) treatment, we evaluated the kinetics of peripheral blood (PB) multilineage donor contribution. The initial contribution of Lsd1<sup>fl/fl</sup> Mx1Cre or Lsd1<sup>fl/fl</sup> cells to mature myeloid and lymphoid lineages was equivalent (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). By 4 weeks after poly(I:C), the contribution of Lsd1<sup>fl/fl</sup> Mx1Cre cells to the myeloid lineage was barely detectable and remained low for 12 weeks (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Correspondingly, the contribution of Lsd1<sup>fl/fl</sup> Mx1Cre cells to the B and T lymphoid lineages decreased &gt;50% at 4 weeks after poly(I:C) and progressively declined over 12 weeks (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>).

These results suggested a defect in HSC self-renewal in the absence of Lsd1. To address this directly, we evaluated the contribution of Lsd1<sup>fl/fl</sup> Mx1Cre donor cells among immature hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. 12 weeks after poly(I:C) treatment, the level of Lsd1<sup>fl/fl</sup> Mx1Cre cells that either contributed to lineage-negative CD150<sup>+</sup> Sca-1<sup>+</sup> c-Kit<sup>+</sup> hematopoietic stem cells, CD150<sup>\u2212</sup> LS<sup>+</sup>K<sup>+</sup> multipotent progenitor cells, or various lineage-negative myeloid progenitor cells (i.e., GMP, PreGM, PreMegE, MkP, PreCFU-E, CFU-E) was virtually undetectable (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E,F</a>).

The number of Neutr.7/4<sup>\u2212</sup> F4/80<sup>+</sup> monocytes was unaffected. Cytospin preparations of Gr1<sup>+</sup> Mac1<sup>+</sup> cells confirmed the lack of mature neutrophils and the accumulation of immature myeloid cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Thus, loss of Lsd1 culminates in a differentiation block at the transition of immature Gr1<sup>dim</sup> Mac1<sup>+</sup> to mature Gr1<sup>high</sup> Mac1<sup>+</sup> granulocytes. Next, we used EpoRCre mice to perform erythroid-specific gene inactivation of Lsd1 (<a href=\"#bib15\">Heinrich et al., 2004</a>). As EpoRCre-mediated deletion of Lsd1 was lethal in the prenatal period, we analyzed Lsd1<sup>fl/fl</sup> EpoRCre embryos. Combinatorial FACS staining of the cell surface markers CD71 and Ter119, or combination of CD71 with c-Kit, were used to stage erythroid maturation in vivo (<a href=\"#bib62\">Zhang et al. 2003</a>). Lsd1 knockout embryos displayed a 300% increase of CD71<sup>high</sup> Ter119<sup>low</sup> proerythroblasts (R2), but a 20-fold reduction of reticulocytes and erythrocytes (R5; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D,E</a>). Similar results were obtained using c-Kit and CD71 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D,E</a>). Thus, erythroid cell maturation in Lsd1-deficient embryos is impaired at the transition from proerythroblasts/R2 to basophilic erythroblasts/R3. In keeping with this, enucleated mature definitive erythroid cells were markedly reduced in Lsd1-deficient fetal livers (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Overall, Lsd1-deficient embryos were small and exhibited pale fetal livers at E13.5, similarly consistent with compromised erythropoiesis (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>). By E14.5, embryos displayed grave developmental defects, most likely due to insufficient oxygenation (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). Cross sections of E13.5 fetal livers showed a disturbed architecture with multiple pyknotic cells displaying karyorrhexis, indicative of increased cell death (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>), also confirmed by flow cytometry (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Taken together, these data demonstrate that Lsd1 is essential not only for differentiation and self-renewal of hematopoietic stem cells but also for terminal granulocytic and erythroid differentiation."

                                "text": "To investigate an underlying molecular basis for the profound multilineage hematopoietic differentiation defects, we performed global gene expression profiling of Gr1<sup>dim</sup> Mac1<sup>+</sup> granulocytic precursor cells, CD71<sup>+</sup> c-Kit<sup>+</sup> proerythroblasts, and CD150<sup>+</sup> CD48<sup>\u2212</sup> LS<sup>+</sup>K<sup>+</sup> hematopoietic stem cells. Several genes that are typically highly expressed in normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells were substantially upregulated in Lsd1 mutant cells (e.g., CD34, 41-fold; HoxA9, 35-fold; Sca-1, 16-fold; <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). To pursue the potential significance of this observation, we performed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA; <a href=\"#bib51\">Subramanian et al., 2005</a>) using a gene signature derived from HSPCs (LSK signature; <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 5\u2014source data 1</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Krivtsov et al., 2006</a>). Strikingly, the stem/progenitor cell gene signature was highly enriched across all of the assayed Lsd1-deficient cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013C</a>; Gr1<sup>dim</sup> Mac1<sup>+</sup> cells: NES: \u22122.1; FDR \u2264 10<sup>\u22124</sup>; CD71<sup>+</sup>c-Kit<sup>+</sup> proerythroblasts: NES: \u22122.2; FDR \u2264 10<sup>\u22124</sup>; CD150<sup>+</sup> CD48<sup>\u2212</sup> LS<sup>+</sup>K<sup>+</sup> HSCs: NES: \u22122.0; FDR \u2264 10<sup>\u22124</sup>). Similar results were obtained using independently derived stem/progenitor cell signatures (<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 5\u2014source data 2</a>). Quantitative PCR analysis of Lsd1 knockout cells for selected hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell genes confirmed the derepression of HSPC genes (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). Next, we assessed whether derepression of stem and progenitor cell genes in mature cells might affect the expression of the key transcriptional regulators that instruct and orchestrate granulocytic or erythroid differentiation (such as C/EBP\u03b1 or Gata1). However, mRNA expression levels of these master transcription factors were not downregulated in Gr1<sup>dim</sup> Mac1<sup>+</sup> cells or in CD71<sup>+</sup>c-Kit<sup>+</sup> proerythroblasts, indicating that the block in terminal differentiation could not be ascribed simply to the reduced expression of these regulators (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). In order to identify signaling pathways that potentially drive or maintain the upregulation of a stem and progenitor cell gene signature, we again performed gene set enrichment analysis and found that Hox genes, which are typically associated with early hematopoiesis, were significantly upregulated in Lsd1 knockout cells (NES: \u22121.46; FDR \u2264 0.02; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). In keeping with this, we discovered significant enrichment of HoxA7-driven (Z-score: 2.746; p=1.63 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22128</sup>) and HoxA9-driven (Z-score: 2.314; p=1.13 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22123</sup>) gene expression networks (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>) by performing pathway enrichment analysis with the \u2018Ingenuity Systems\u2019 pathway analysis tool. We found that the expression of downstream HoxA9 target genes, including <i>Bcl2</i>, <i>Msi2</i>, and <i>Sox4</i>, were also significantly upregulated (NES: \u22121.78; FDR \u2264 0.001; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>). Based on these findings, we hypothesized that failure to repress earlier lineage gene expression programs impairs early, as well as later, hematopoietic maturation programs."

We focused our search for direct Lsd1 target genes within the granulocytic lineage. Sufficient cellular material for Lsd1 ChIP-Seq could not be prepared from primary Gr1<sup>dim</sup> Mac1<sup>+</sup> cells to generate high-quality occupancy data. Therefore, we used an immature murine granulocytic cell line (i.e., 32D) that can be differentiated into mature neutrophils upon addition of G-CSF (<a href=\"#bib42\">Rovera et al., 1987</a>). In total, we identified a total of 25,173 Lsd1 binding sites (peaks) from the ChIP-Seq data set. We chose 18 peaks for validation by ChIP-qPCR in primary Gr1<sup>dim</sup> Mac1<sup>+</sup> cells. We found that 16 (&gt;85%) of these binding sites were also occupied by Lsd1 in Gr1<sup>dim</sup> Mac1<sup>+</sup> cells (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Genome-wide analysis of Lsd1 peak distribution revealed only limited binding to proximal promoters (15%). Lsd1 binding peaks were predominantly positioned at intergenic (40%) and intronic (38%) regions (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>; <a href=\"#SD4-data\">Figure 5\u2014source data 3</a>). Next, we compared the Lsd1 ChIP-Seq binding sites with gene expression changes extracted from Gr1<sup>dim</sup> Mac1<sup>+</sup> microarray data and found that Lsd1 occupied 55% of genes (i.e., 1361 out of 2473) that were at least 1.5-fold (p\u22650.05) upregulated in Lsd1 knockout cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5H</a>). Using the Ingenuity Systems functional categorization tools on these direct Lsd1 target genes, we found that the majority of these genes are indeed involved in regulation of blood cell function (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5I</a>)."

No differences in global methylation levels were detected (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Based on the distribution of regions occupied by, we sought to determine whether Lsd1 participates in the control of promoter regions, as well as distal enhancer elements. H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 typically mark active promoters, whereas distal enhancer elements are characterized by high levels of H3K4me1 and low levels of H3K4me3 (<a href=\"#bib16\">Heintzman et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Koch et al., 2007</a>). Active enhancers are distinguished from poised enhancers by the presence of H3K27 acetylation (H3K27ac; <a href=\"#bib6\">Creyghton et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Rada-Iglesias et al., 2011</a>). To determine the relative contribution of Lsd1 toward regulation of promoter or enhancer activities, we performed ChIP-Seq for promoter-associated H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 and the enhancer-associated H3K4me1 and H3K27ac marks in wild-type Gr1<sup>dim</sup> Mac1<sup>+</sup> cells, and compared Lsd1 binding with the allocation of the respective histone marks. Peak overlap analysis of Lsd1 with the respective histone methylation marks confirmed that Lsd1 occupied about three times more putative enhancers (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>) than active promoters (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>), implying that Lsd1 in fact regulates both promoter and enhancer activities."

Similar results were obtained for KO-specific H3K4me3 (ES: 3.83; p=4.9 \u00d7 10<sup>\u221220</sup>) and H3K27ac (ES: 2.98; p=1.3 \u00d7 10<sup>\u221234</sup>) peak target genes (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). We reasoned that genes downregulated in Lsd1 knockout Gr1<sup>dim</sup> Mac1<sup>+</sup> cells should not show considerable enrichment of KO-specific methylation marks. Consequently, we determined the enrichment of histone methylation peaks within a mature granulocyte signature, which was downregulated in Lsd1 knockout Gr1<sup>dim</sup> Mac1<sup>+</sup> cells (NES: 2.8; FDR \u2264 10<sup>\u22124</sup>; <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). As expected, KO-specific peak target genes were not meaningfully enriched in the granulocyte gene signature (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>). To assess direct involvement of Lsd1 in the regulation of HSPC genes, we examined the occupancy of Lsd1 on LSK and granulocyte signature genes. We divided Lsd1 target genes into three groups: genes that had Lsd1 either bound at distal sites and at the promoter (1), only at distal regions (2), or only at the proximal promoter (3) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G</a> and <a href=\"#SD6-data\">Figure 6\u2014source data 2</a>). We found that genes of group (1) were highly enriched (ES: 2.02; p=2.53 \u00d7 10<sup>\u221211</sup>) and that genes of group (2) were slightly but significantly enriched (ES: 1.15; p=0.02) in the LSK signature. As expected, none of the three groups were significantly enriched in the granulocyte signature (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G</a>), suggesting that Lsd1 is directly involved in the repression of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell genes but not in the activation of mature granulocyte genes. Among the genes occupied by Lsd1 at distal sites and at the promoter were <i>Meis1</i>, <i>Gfi1b</i>, <i>Myb</i>, <i>\u03b2-catenin</i>, and <i>Runx1</i> (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>; <a href=\"#SD6-data\">Figure 6\u2014source data 2</a>), a set of genes with established roles in hematopoietic stem cells. These findings provide evidence of the relevance of this class of Lsd1 target genes. Representative tracks of genes bound by Lsd1 at distal regulatory and promoter regions (<i>Meis1</i> and <i>\u03b2-catenin</i>) are depicted in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6H</a>. Collectively, we established that Lsd1 occupies distal regulatory regions as well as proximal promoters of stem and progenitor cell genes and that deletion of Lsd1 is associated with increased levels of the Lsd1 substrates H3K4me1 and H3K4me2 on enhancers and promoters of HSPC genes."

Conditional deletion of Lsd1 resulted in severe pancytopenia, the consequence of combined defects in early hematopoietic stem cell differentiation and terminal blood cell maturation. We used Cre recombinase mouse strains to permit deletion of Lsd1 at early or later developmental stages. In this manner, we dissected the complex phenotypes ensuing from Lsd1 loss. We established that Lsd1 is crucial not only for immature hematopoietic stem cell differentiation, as might have been expected from the previous ES cell studies (<a href=\"#bib56\">Wang et al., 2009a</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Adamo et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Whyte et al., 2012</a>), but also critical for differentiation of mature hematopoietic cells. Taken together, we found that Lsd1-deficient HSCs were severely impaired in their capacity to mature into immature progenitors. Deletion of Lsd1 not only compromised early hematopoietic differentiation but also strongly interfered with terminal granulocytic and erythroid differentiation. Our data are most consistent with a requirement for Lsd1 at promoters and enhancers of stem and progenitor cell genes in hematopoietic cells. As a consequence, differentiating Lsd1 knockout cells aberrantly express HSPC genes normally expressed only in HSCs and progenitors. We propose that failure to silence these LSK-associated genes in Lsd1 mutants interferes with proper differentiation, culminating in detrimental consequences for hematopoiesis (see <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a> for model)."

PB was collected from the submandibular vein, and CBC\u2019s were determined using a Hemavet 950 FS (Drew Scientific Group, Waterbury, CT). RBCs were lysed with ammonium chloride buffer prior to staining. Prior to staining, cells were incubated with purified anti-mouse CD16/CD32 antibody (FC Block) for a minimum of 15 min. LT-HSCs and myeloid progenitors were isolated and analyzed as in <a href=\"#bib8\">Ema et al. (2006)</a> and <a href=\"#bib37\">Pronk et al. (2007)</a> with minor modifications. In brief, bone marrow cells were isolated by crushing iliac crest bones, femurae, and tibiae in PBS containing 0.2% BSA and 2 mM EDTA. Isolated bone marrow cells were then subjected to Ficoll (Ficoll-Paque Premium; GE Healthcare) density gradient centrifugation. Cells from buffy coat were washed twice with PBS/0.2% BSA/2 mM EDTA and then labeled at subsaturating levels with the biotin mouse lineage depletion kit (eBioscience, San Diego, CA). Lineage-positive stained cells were magnetically depleted with Biotin Binder Dynabeads (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY). The remaining cells were then stained with lineage cocktail CD150, CD48, c-Kit, and Sca-1 antibodies.

Single-stranded cDNA amplification products were purified using QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen, Hercules, CA) and labeled with the FL-Ovation cDNA Biotin Module V2 (NuGEN Technologies, San Carlos, CA). Hybridization to Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 arrays (GeneChip Mouse Genome 430A for the erythroid samples), washing, and scanning was performed by the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute microarray core facility. CEL files were imported into the Gene Pattern Software Suite (<a href=\"#bib41\">Reich et al., 2006</a>) for GC-RMA normalization and extraction of signal intensities. Independent biological repeats were combined by averaging the signal intensities of each probe represented on the microarray. Data were further analyzed by gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA; <a href=\"#bib51\">Subramanian et al., 2005</a>) and IPA (Ingenuity Systems, Redwood City, CA; <a href=\"http://www.ingenuity.com\">www.ingenuity.com</a>): The IPA functional analysis identified the biological functions and/or diseases that were most significant to the data set. Molecules from the data sets that met the \u22651.5-fold cutoff at p\u22640.05 were associated with biological functions and/or diseases in the Ingenuity Knowledge Base were considered for the analysis. Right-tailed Fisher\u2019s exact test was used to calculate a p-value determining the probability that each biological function and/or disease assigned to that data set is due to chance alone. GSEA provides a general statistical method to test for the enrichment of sets of genes in expression data, and has been particularly useful in identifying molecular pathways at play in complex gene expression signatures, as recently reported (<a href=\"#bib51\">Subramanian et al., 2005</a>). GSEA considers a priori defined gene sets, for example, genes in a signature such as the self-renewal associated signature or members of a pathway. It then provides a method to determine whether the members of these sets are overrepresented at the top (or bottom) of a gene list of markers that have been ordered by their correlation with a specific phenotype or class distinction, and produces a gene set\u2013gene list specific Enrichment Score (ES). The running enrichment score (red line) is graphed vs the gene number in a gene list ordered based on the correlation of interest. Simply, the higher the ES score and the earlier in the ordered gene list the max ES score is obtained, the greater the enrichment of the gene set. GSEA setting applied in this study: dataset was collapsed to gene symbols and 1000 permutations were run (Permutation type: Gene Set)."

Processing samples by ligation, amplification, and size selection are not required by Helicos sequencing. Briefly, 6\u201310 ng of ChIP DNA or input DNA was used in the 3\u2032 polyA tailing reaction in 14.8 \u03bcl containing 2 \u03bcl of 2.5 mM CoCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 \u03bcl of 10\u00d7 terminal transferase buffer, and nuclease-free water. The reaction mixture was denatured in 95\u00b0C for 5 min, followed by rapid cooling in ice water slurry. Then 1 U of terminal transferase, 4 \u03bcl of 50 \u03bcM dATP, and 0.2 \u03bcl of NEB BSA were added to the mixture. Samples were incubated in a thermocycler at 37\u00b0C for 1 hr and 70\u00b0C for 10 min, followed by denaturing at 95\u00b0C for 5 min and rapid cooling in ice water slurry. For 3\u2032 ddATP-blocking, 0.5 \u03bcl of 200 \u03bcM ddATP, 1 \u03bcl of 10\u00d7 terminal transferase, 1 \u03bcl of 2.5 mM CoCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 U of terminal transferase, and 6.5 \u03bcl of nuclear-free water were added to the above reaction. Samples were incubated in a thermocycler at 37\u00b0C for 1 hr and 70\u00b0C for 20 min. Then 2 pmol of carrier oligonucleotide were added to the reaction, and samples (H3K4me2-ChIP and H3K4me3-ChIP from wild-type and Lsd1 knockout Gr1<sup>dim</sup> Mac1<sup>+</sup> cells + matching input control) were hybridized to the Helicos flow cells for sequencing at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) Molecular Biology Core Facility. Sequencing reads were aligned to mouse genome assembly mm9 (NCBI Build 37) using Helisphere software with default parameters. Only the reads that were uniquely aligned to reference genome with read alignment score higher than 4.5 were retained for further analysis."

Peaks significantly enriched of ChIP-Seq tags were identified by using Model-based Analysis for ChIP-Seq (MACS; <a href=\"#bib63\">Zhang et al., 2008</a>). Distribution of enrichment peaks in the distal promoters (\u221210 kb to \u22124 kb of TSS), proximal promoters (\u22124 kb to +2 kb of TSS), exons, introns, and intergenic regions (outside of these defined regions) was calculated. Identified peaks were then mapped to RefSeq annotated genes (<a href=\"#bib38\">Pruitt et al., 2004</a>) for downstream analyses. To use \u2018MAnorm\u2019 normalization (<a href=\"#bib46\">Shao et al., 2012</a>), one assumes that the true intensities of most common peaks are the same between two ChIP-Seq samples. This assumption is valid when the binding regions represented by the common peaks show a much higher level of colocalization between samples than that expected at random, and thus binding at the common peaks should be determined by similar mechanisms and exhibit similar global binding intensity between samples. Second, the observed differences in sequence read density in common peaks are presumed to reflect the scaling relationship of ChIP-Seq signals between two samples, which can thus be applied to all peaks. Based on these hypotheses, the log<sub>2</sub> ratio of read density between two samples M = log<sub>2</sub> (read density in Lsd1 knockout sample/read density in wild-type sample) was plotted against the average log<sub>2</sub> read density A = 0.5 \u00d7 log<sub>2</sub> (read density in Lsd1 knockout sample \u00d7 read density in wild-type sample) for all peaks, and robust linear regression was applied to fit the global dependence between the M-A values of common peaks for H3K27ac and H3K4me3, whereas only those common peaks that did not overlap with identified Lsd1 peaks were used to fit the model for H3K4me1 and H3K4me2. Finally, the derived linear model was used as a reference for normalization and extrapolated to all peaks. The normalized M value was then used as a quantitative measure of differential binding in each peak region between two samples, with peak regions associated with larger absolute M values exhibiting greater differences in binding. Peaks that displayed twofold higher normalized read density in knockout cells were defined as Lsd1 knockout\u2013specific (KO-specific). A similar analysis was performed to identify wild type\u2013specific peaks (wt-specific). Peaks with less than twofold changed normalized read densities were defined as common peaks (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2A\u2013D</a>)."

Derepression of these genes in the absence of Lsd1 is associated with HSC depletion, hematopoietic failure, and impaired myeloid differentiation. The manuscript is technically well done. A strength of the manuscript is that it integrates CHIP-seq data with gene expression profiling and an analysis of the knockout mouse phenotype. The observation that Lsd1 activity is required to repress genes expressed by primitive cells, that it appears to regulate enhancer elements, and that failure of this impedes myeloid differentiation is conceptually interesting. On the other hand, Lsd1 has already been shown to be required for hematopoiesis (Sprussel et al, Leukemia 2012) and there was previously published evidence of activity at enhancer elements (Whyte et al. Nature, 2012; Cai et al. Cancer Cell 2011)."

Looking at Lsd1 gene expression across numerous murine tissues and cell types using the <a href=\"http://BioGPS.org\">BioGPS.org</a> (Wu et al. 2009) online platform (Affymetrix probe sets for murine Lsd1: 1426761_at and 1426762_s_at), it seems that, with few exceptions, Lsd1 mRNA is expressed at similar levels throughout murine tissues/cell types. We did not find evidence that Lsd1 functions specifically in primitive cells. One may speculate that different cell type/lineage specific transcription factors recruit Lsd1 to different target genes and therefore drive other gene expression programs. However, taking into account that we observed derepression of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell gene signatures in fully committed cells such as Gr1<sup>dim</sup> Mac1<sup>+</sup> myeloid cells, CD71<sup>+</sup> c-Kit<sup>+</sup> proerythroblasts, as well as primitive hematopoietic stem cells, suggests that Lsd1 is regulating this particular kind of gene expression program in multiple cell types. Our data, however, cannot exclude the possibility that Lsd1 regulates additional functions in hematopoietic or other cell types. It is interesting to note that Lsd1 is very highly expressed in murine embryonic stem cells. In line with our findings, downregulation of Lsd1 in murine embryonic stem cells impairs their differentiation capacity and interferes with downregulation of pluripotency genes (<a href=\"#bib58\">Whyte et al. 2012</a>). Taken together, the findings in ESCs and our findings in hematopoietic stem cells, one can conclude that Lsd1 is critically important in two kinds of primitive cells, but it remains to be tested in other developmental contexts."
