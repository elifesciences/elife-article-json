                    "text": "Centromeres are unique chromosomal loci that promote the assembly of kinetochores, macromolecular complexes that bind spindle microtubules during mitosis. In most organisms, centromeres lack defined genetic features. Rather, they are specified epigenetically by a centromere-specific histone H3 variant, CENP-A. The Mis18 complex, comprising the Mis18\u03b1:Mis18\u03b2 subcomplex and M18BP1, is crucial for CENP-A homeostasis. It recruits the CENP-A-specific chaperone HJURP to centromeres and primes it for CENP-A loading. We report here that a specific arrangement of Yippee domains in a human Mis18\u03b1:Mis18\u03b2 4:2 hexamer binds two copies of M18BP1 through M18BP1\u2019s 140 N-terminal residues. Phosphorylation by Cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) at two conserved sites in this region destabilizes binding to Mis18\u03b1:Mis18\u03b2, limiting complex formation to the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Using an improved viral 2A peptide co-expression strategy, we demonstrate that CDK1 controls Mis18 complex recruitment to centromeres by regulating oligomerization of M18BP1 through the Mis18\u03b1:Mis18\u03b2 scaffold."

In most organisms, centromeres lack defined genetic features. Rather, they are specified epigenetically by a centromere-specific histone H3 variant, CENP-A. The Mis18 complex, comprising the Mis18\u03b1:Mis18\u03b2 subcomplex and M18BP1, is crucial for CENP-A homeostasis. It recruits the CENP-A-specific chaperone HJURP to centromeres and primes it for CENP-A loading. We report here that a specific arrangement of Yippee domains in a human Mis18\u03b1:Mis18\u03b2 4:2 hexamer binds two copies of M18BP1 through M18BP1\u2019s 140 N-terminal residues. Phosphorylation by Cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) at two conserved sites in this region destabilizes binding to Mis18\u03b1:Mis18\u03b2, limiting complex formation to the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Using an improved viral 2A peptide co-expression strategy, we demonstrate that CDK1 controls Mis18 complex recruitment to centromeres by regulating oligomerization of M18BP1 through the Mis18\u03b1:Mis18\u03b2 scaffold."

During mitosis, chromosomes bi-orient on the mitotic spindle, a structure made of microtubules, microtubule motors, and microtubule-binding proteins (<a href=\"#bib24\">Heald and Khodjakov, 2015</a>). Chromosomes attach to spindle microtubules through large multisubunit assemblies known as kinetochores (<a href=\"#bib43\">Pesenti et al., 2016</a>). Besides microtubule binding, kinetochores harness a poorly understood molecular mechanism of \u2018error correction\u2019 that leads to selective stabilization of bi-oriented attachments (<a href=\"#bib15\">Foley and Kapoor, 2013</a>). Upon completion of bi-orientation, removal of sister chromatid cohesion allows the separation of the sister chromatids to the two newly forming daughter cells."

Kinetochores assemble on centromeres, unique chromosomal loci characterized by a strong enrichment of the histone H3 variant centromere protein A (CENP-A) (<a href=\"#bib12\">Earnshaw and Rothfield, 1985</a>). Centromeres in different organisms often consist of long arrays of repetitive sequences, such as the human 171-basepair \u03b1-satellite repeats (<a href=\"#bib20\">Fukagawa and Earnshaw, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">McKinley and Cheeseman, 2016</a>). However, centromeres are often found associated with non-repetitive and non-evolutionarily conserved sequences in different organisms. Furthermore, there are instances in humans and other species of neo-centromeres that become established on non-repetitive sequences (<a href=\"#bib20\">Fukagawa and Earnshaw, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">McKinley and Cheeseman, 2016</a>).

CENP-A is required for the recruitment of several inner (centromere-proximal) kinetochore proteins, now generally referred to as constitutive centromere associated network (CCAN) (<a href=\"#bib17\">Foltz et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Hori et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Izuta et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Obuse et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Okada et al., 2006</a>), and thus acts as the kinetochore\u2019s foundation. CENP-A, together with other CCAN proteins, also promotes the recruitment of specialized machinery devoted to its own incorporation in chromatin (<a href=\"#bib20\">Fukagawa and Earnshaw, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">McKinley and Cheeseman, 2016</a>). This limits incorporation of new CENP-A to the position of the existing CENP-A domain, thus preserving centromere identity. Importantly, the amount of CENP-A at centromeres is halved during DNA replication, and the ensuing CENP-A \u2018vacancy\u2019 may be filled with histone H3.3 (<a href=\"#bib10\">Dunleavy et al., 2011</a>). The reduction in CENP-A is compensated with new CENP-A deposition after cell division, in the G1 phase of the cell cycle (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bodor et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Jansen et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Shelby et al., 2000</a>), likely in a reaction that replaces H3.3 with CENP-A."

Both regions retained the ability to bind Mis18\u03b1:Mis18\u03b2, indicating that each region retains measurable binding affinity for Mis18\u03b1:Mis18\u03b2, with M18BP1<sup>1\u201360</sup> binding apparently more strongly than M18BP1<sup>61\u2013140</sup>\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). We performed pull-down assays with M18BP1 fragments that had been previously phosphorylated with recombinant human CDK1:Cyclin B1. Complete phosphorylation of the fragments was confirmed by mobility shift of the bands on Phos-tag gels. All phosphorylated M18BP1 fragments showed reduced binding affinity for Mis18\u03b1:Mis18\u03b2 compared to the non-phosphorylated fragments (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>)."

CDK1-treated T4V and T40V mutants of M18BP1<sup>1-60</sup> showed reduced mobility shift, and a T4V/T40V double mutant of M18BP1<sup>1\u201360</sup> showed no shift on Phos-tag gels, suggesting Thr4 and Thr40 are the major phosphorylation sites of M18BP1<sup>1\u201360</sup>. The interaction between M18BP1<sup>1\u201360/T4V</sup> and Mis18\u03b1:Mis18\u03b2 was sensitive to CDK-phosphorylation, while the interaction between M18BP1<sup>1\u201360/T40V</sup> and Mis18\u03b1:Mis18\u03b2 was not affected by CDK activity, indicating that phosphorylation of Thr40 is a determinant of the interaction.

The Mis18\u03b1:Mis18\u03b2 complex appeared monodisperse in size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) profiles (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). We analyzed its stoichiometry with both sedimentation velocity and sedimentation equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B\u2013D</a>). We obtained molecular weight (MW) estimates of about 150 kD for the Mis18\u03b1:Mis18\u03b2 complex from both AUC methods (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B\u2013D</a>). This corresponds to the predicted MW of a hexameric complex of Mis18\u03b1 and Mis18\u03b2, but the stoichiometry remains unclear due to the similar size of the Mis18\u03b1 and Mis18\u03b2 subunits. To determine the stoichiometry of Mis18\u03b1 and Mis18\u03b2 within the complex, we tagged either Mis18\u03b1 or Mis18\u03b2 with MBP and purified two different complexes, 6His-Mis18\u03b1:MBP-Mis18\u03b2 or MBP-Mis18\u03b1:6His-Mis18\u03b2 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). The presence of each MBP in the complex increases the molecular mass of the complex by 42 kDa. The AUC results indicated unequivocally that 6His-Mis18\u03b1:MBP-Mis18\u03b2 complex contains two MBPs and that MBP-Mis18\u03b1:6His-Mis18\u03b2 complex contains four MBPs, thus demonstrating that the stoichiometry of the Mis18\u03b1:Mis18\u03b2 complex is 4:2 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C\u2013D</a>). Another notable feature of the Mis18\u03b1:Mis18\u03b2 complex is an elongated conformation, as suggested by the early elution volume of SEC analysis and the high frictional ratio emerging from the AUC analysis in comparison to that of globular standard proteins (<a href=\"#bib13\">Erickson, 2009</a>)."

We therefore co-expressed 6His-Mis18\u03b1 and MBP-Mis18\u03b2 in <i>E. coli</i> with a bicistronic expression system. After removal of affinity tags, the <i>E. coli</i> and insect cell expressed Mis18\u03b1:Mis18\u03b2 complexes showed essentially identical elution profiles in analytical SEC experiments at two different concentrations (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). The two complexes also behaved essentially identically in sedimentation velocity AUC experiments (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B\u2013C</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). These results are in agreement with our contention that the Mis18 complex is hexameric. Untagged Mis18\u03b1 and Mis18\u03b2 were insoluble when expressed in isolation in <i>E. coli</i> (unpublished data), but tagging them with 6His-MBP delivered soluble products. 6His-MBP-Mis18\u03b2 appeared monodisperse in analytical SEC experiments, whereas 6His-MBP-Mis18\u03b1 appeared polydisperse, despite good purity (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Removing the 6His-MBP-tag without prior mixing of 6His-MBP-Mis18\u03b1 and 6His-MBP-Mis18\u03b2 caused precipitation of both Mis18\u03b1 and Mis18\u03b2, indicative of poor stability of the individual untagged subunits. Tag cleavage after subunit mixing at 1:1 molar ratio yielded (in addition to a precipitate that was removed by centrifugation) Mis18\u03b1:Mis18\u03b2 complex that eluted from an analytical SEC column at the same volume (~1.45 ml) as the Mis18\u03b1:Mis18\u03b2 complex obtained by co-expression in <i>E. coli</i> or insect cells (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>, compare with <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Mixing 6His-MBP-Mis18\u03b1 and 6His-MBP-Mis18\u03b2 at 2:1 molar ratio and cleaving off the tags reduced precipitation and increased the final yield of soluble Mis18\u03b1:Mis18\u03b2 complex, without changing the elution volume of the complex (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). Finally, we repeated these SEC experiments using the detergent-containing SEC buffer reported by Nardi and colleagues (<a href=\"#bib39\">Nardi et al., 2016</a>), again without observing significant changes in the elution profile of the Mis18\u03b1:Mis18\u03b2 complex (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>)."

However, in the absence of a molecular basis for the interaction of M18BP1 with Mis18\u03b1:Mis18\u03b2, the details of this regulation had remained unclear. We show that each of the two Mis18\u03b1:Mis18\u03b2 binding regions of M18BP1<sup>1\u2013140</sup> (1-60 and 61\u2013140) contains a highly\u00a0conserved CDK-phosphorylation motif. Using a series of purified M18BP1 proteins with non-phosphorylatable and phosphomimetic mutations, we demonstrated that Thr40 and Ser110 are targets of the CDK1:Cyclin B complex. When introduced in full length M18BP1, the phosphomimetic mutations T40D and S110E reduced recruitment of M18BP1, prevented recruitment of Mis18\u03b1 to centromeres, and interfered with new CENP-A deposition. These defects are very similar to the defects observed upon expression of EGFP-M18BP1<sup>141\u20131132</sup> in cells depleted of endogenous M18BP1, and point to M18BP1<sup>1\u2013140</sup> as a controlled interaction module for complex formation with Mis18\u03b1:Mis18\u03b2."

The functional importance of oligomerization of Mis18\u03b1 and Mis18\u03b2 for CENP-A loading has been highlighted in two additional recent studies (<a href=\"#bib39\">Nardi et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Subramanian et al., 2016</a>). The single fission yeast ortholog of Mis18 uses both the Yippee and the C-terminal coiled-coil domains to form homo tetramers (<a href=\"#bib56\">Subramanian et al., 2016</a>). Full-length human Mis18\u03b1 and Mis18\u03b2, on the other hand, have been reported to oligomerize via their C-terminal coiled-coil domains to form 2:2 heterotetramer (<a href=\"#bib39\">Nardi et al., 2016</a>).

We show that recombinant Mis18\u03b1:Mis18\u03b2 complexes produced in insect cells and <i>E coli</i> have essentially identical hydrodynamic properties in different buffers and concentrations.

Our results are consistent with evidence that M18BP1 interacts with the Mis18\u03b1:Mis18\u03b2 complex only when both Mis18\u03b1 and Mis18\u03b2 subunits are co-expressed in a yeast-three-hybrid assay (<a href=\"#bib19\">Fujita et al., 2007</a>).

Mouse M18BP1 and frog M18BP1 isoforms were shown to interact with the CCAN protein CENP-C (<a href=\"#bib5\">Dambacher et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Moree et al., 2011</a>) through a binding domain located between the SANTA and SANT domains (<a href=\"#bib5\">Dambacher et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Stellfox et al., 2016</a>). We demonstrated that forced dimerization of M18BP1<sup>141-1132</sup> using GST-tag increased its localization to centromeres in HeLa cells, supporting the hypothesis that Mis18\u03b1:Mis18\u03b2-mediated dimerization of M18BP1 is required to strengthen the interaction between the Mis18 complex and centromeric recruiters. However, GST-mediated dimerization did not rescue centromeric localization of EGFP-M18BP1<sup>141\u20131132</sup> to the levels of full length EGFP-M18BP1, indicating that the interaction with Mis18\u03b1:Mis18\u03b2 contributes to the localization mechanism even beyond dimerization. A physical interaction of Mis18\u03b2 with the CENP-C C-terminal region might account for increased binding affinity (<a href=\"#bib55\">Stellfox et al., 2016</a>)."

Our analysis demonstrates that the phosphorylation of Thr40 and Ser110 of M18BP1 by CDK1 prevents assembly of the Mis18 complex, thus describing a crucial mechanism to temporally restrict CENP-A loading to early G1 phase, when the levels of Cyclin B rapidly decline after their mitotic peak. In conclusion, the available evidence depicts a complex binding mechanism for the centromere localization of the Mis18 complex, with multiple binding interfaces and a complex regulation by mitotic kinases. Here, we have dissected the regulation of a crucial element of this interface."

Then, the cells were treated with Lipofectamine RNAiMAX, serum-free OptiMEM (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 10 nM M18BP1 siRNA (5\u2019-GAAGUCUGGUGUUAGGAAAdTdT-3\u2019) (<a href=\"#bib19\">Fujita et al., 2007</a>) for 48 hr according to the manufacture\u2019s protocol, and the control cells were treated with Lipofectamine RNAiMAX and serum-free OptiMEM without siRNA. Doxycycline (Sigma) was added to the culture at a concentration of 50 ng/ml to induce protein expression and was kept in the media until the fixation of cells. Thymidine (1 mM final concentration) was used to arrest cells at S/G1 transition phase. When cells were released from thymidine, existing CENP-A-SNAP proteins were blocked using SNAP-Cell Block (NEB) according to the manufacture\u2019s protocol. STLC (5 \u03bcM final concentration) was used to arrest cells in prometaphase. The cells arrested in prometaphase were separated from other cells by mitotic-shake-off, released from STLC by extensive wash with the media and placed in wells of 24-well plates containing poly-lysine coated coverslips. Three hours later, the cells in early G1 phase attached on the coverslips and were treated with SNAP-Cell 647-SiR (NEB) to label newly synthesized CENP-A-SNAP according to the manufacture\u2019s protocol. Cells were fixed with PBS/PHEM (Pipes, Hepes, EGTA, and MgCl<sub>2</sub>)-paraformaldehyde 4% followed by permeabilization with PBS/PHEM\u2013Triton X-100 0.5% and immunostaining. The following antibodies were used for immunostaining: CREST/anticentromere antibodies (human autoimmune serum, Antibodies, Inc.), anti-M18BP1 (Bethyl A302-825A), anti-rabbit Rodamine red\u2013conjugated, anti-human DyLight 405\u2013conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. Coverslips were mounted with Mowiol mounting media (EMD Millipore) and imaged using a 60\u00d7 oil immersion objective lens on a DeltaVision deconvolution microscope. Quantification of centromere signals were performed using the software Fiji with a script from a previous study (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bodor et al., 2012</a>) with modifications for semi-automated processing. Briefly, average projections were made from z-stacks of recorded images. Centromere spots were chosen based on the parameters of shape, size, and intensity using the images obtained with CREST-staining, and their positions were recorded. The mean intensity value of adjacent pixels of a centromere spot was subtracted as background intensity from the mean intensity value of the centromere spot. Statistical analysis of the quantified intensity was performed and the plots were generated with the software Prism 7 (GraphPad Software Inc.)."

Although these contributions are worthwhile, the fact that M18BP1 phosphorylation regulates Mis18\u03b1/\u03b2 binding has been reported previously which impinges on the overall novelty of the manuscript. Moreover, since very different experimental protocols for reconstitutions are used between this and an earlier study, it remains possible that the complex may exist in different stoichiometry, this issue still remains open for discussion at this stage. Overall, the reviewers were of the opinion that the manuscript represents a modest advance in the field at this stage and discussed that the manuscript could perhaps be improved either by: (1) firmly establishing the biological role of the hexamer vs. a tetramer and by providing a better explanation for the difference between their results and the previous literature, or (2) from better delineating the role of the dimerization of M18BP1 via the Mis18 complex."

Furthermore, the phoshomimics of the same fragment (1-140/T40D/S110E) did not show any dominant negative effect, which the authors explained by stating that the Mis18\u03b1/Mis18\u03b2 interaction is lost.

In this work, Pan, et al. use sedimentation velocity and equilibrium ultracentrifugation to determine that the Mis18 complex comprises a Mis18 heterohexamer (4\u03b1:2\u03b2), which in turn can bind 2 copies of the M18BP1 N-terminus. The authors argue that a Mis18 hexamer is the true stoichiometry because the methods used in the previous study are more error-prone. In addition, they suggest that the previous study may have obtained a 2:2 stoichiometry because they combined a 1:1 molar ratio of separately purified Mis18\u03b1 and Mis18\u03b2 rather than coexpressing them in eukaryotic cells."

By size exclusion, Nardi et al. also appear to observe a mono-dispersed species with a migration consistent with their calculated molecular weight. Pan, et al. argue based on their analyses that the Mis18 complex adopts an elongated conformation, leading to its earlier elution in size exclusion chromatography. Therefore, if anything I would expect a molecular weight calculation based on SEC elution of this complex to overestimate rather than underestimate its stoichiometry. In the absence of data supporting the idea that the stoichiometry of the complex is 'titratable,' I also don't find the notion that Nardi et al. observed a tetramer simply because they mixed Mis18\u03b1 and Mis18\u03b2 in a 1:1 ratio compelling. If the ratio were off, presumably Nardi et al. would have seen a population at equilibrium containing some hexamer and some monomer/dimer/trimer. The difference in observed species may likely be due to the different expression systems used (bacterial vs. eukaryotic) and resulting differences in protein modifications/folding/etc., but there may also be some interesting biology in the differences. On the other hand, elaborating on the technical differences between the methods to clarify why the Siegel-Monty method is more error-prone would be helpful."

Do the coiled-coil mutations described by Nardi et al. affect hexamer formation? Is the hexamer comprised of a Mis18\u03b1/\u03b2 tetrameric core mediated by coiled coils with additional Mis18\u03b1 bound by a different mechanism (e.g., the Yippee domain, which is also used for tetramerization in SpMis18)?

Removing the 6His-MBP tag before mixing 6His-MBP-Mis18\u27e8 and 6His-MBP-Mis18\u00ae caused both proteins to precipitate, but if the tags were removed after mixing, the complex remained soluble.

On the other hand, elaborating on the technical differences between the methods to clarify why the Siegel-Monty method is more error-prone would be helpful.</i> "

We have therefore removed the sentences about 1:1 mixing from our Discussion. We already underlined the implicit difficulty of using Siegel-Monty with samples like the ones used by Nardi and co-workers. Co-expression is the gold standard to solve the solubility and assembly problems of macromolecular complexes. When writing our manuscript we have tried to be respectful of the biochemical work of Nardi et al., even if we felt that it does not meet the standards required to reach definitive conclusions. Importantly, we have not been able to purify 6His-Mis18\u27e8 or 6His-Mis18\u00ae in isolation from bacteria due to the very poor behavior of these proteins. Addition of an MBP tag partly solved the problem, as long as the tag was not cleaved off. As already referred to above, we have only been able to purify the Mis18 complex after co-expression of Mis18\u27e8 and Mis18\u00ae in <i>E. coli</i>. While not as stable as the complex produced in insect cells, this bacterially expressed complex behaves in gel filtration and AUC assays precisely like the sample produced in insect cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>)."

I think it's important for the authors to provide some additional characterization of the hexamer. Is the coiled-coil domain involved in hexamerization? Do the coiled-coil mutations described by Nardi et al. affect hexamer formation? Is the hexamer comprised of a Mis18\u03b1/\u03b2 tetrameric core mediated by coiled coils with additional Mis18\u03b1 bound by a different mechanism (e.g., the Yippee domain, which is also used for tetramerization in SpMis18)? The Musacchio lab has made extensive use of cross-linking/mass spectrometry in the past to understand the organization of multi-protein complexes \u2013 perhaps this could shed light on differences between the Nardi and Pan Mis18 complexes.</i> "

Partly for this reason, we have decided not to analyze this question in detail. In addition, given the very extensive level of phosphorylation of M18BP1 and other proteins in the CENP-A loading pathway, we surmise that it is unlikely that preventing the phosphorylation of the two residues we have discussed will be sufficient to bypass cell cycle inhibition of CENP-A loading. Of note, the work of Janssen and co-workers focuses precisely on this point, and reached the conclusion that lack of phosphorylation at different residues (on HJURP and M18BP1) may be sufficient to prevent CENP-A deposition in G2. More pervasive phosphorylation in M-phase may extend the regulation of additional sites, such as the ones we have identified."
