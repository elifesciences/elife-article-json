To identify dosage-sensitive genes that cause DS phenotypes, including CHD, we used chromosome engineering to generate a mapping panel of 7 mouse strains with partial trisomies of regions of mouse chromosome 16 orthologous to Hsa21. Using high-resolution episcopic microscopy and three-dimensional modeling we show that these strains accurately model DS CHD. Systematic analysis of the 7 strains identified a minimal critical region sufficient to cause CHD when present in 3 copies, and showed that it contained at least two dosage-sensitive loci. Furthermore, two of these new strains model a specific subtype of atrio-ventricular septal defects with exclusive ventricular shunting and demonstrate that, contrary to current hypotheses, these CHD are not due to failure in formation of the dorsal mesenchymal protrusion."

To identify dosage-sensitive genes that cause DS phenotypes, including CHD, we used chromosome engineering to generate a mapping panel of 7 mouse strains with partial trisomies of regions of mouse chromosome 16 orthologous to Hsa21. Using high-resolution episcopic microscopy and three-dimensional modeling we show that these strains accurately model DS CHD. Systematic analysis of the 7 strains identified a minimal critical region sufficient to cause CHD when present in 3 copies, and showed that it contained at least two dosage-sensitive loci. Furthermore, two of these new strains model a specific subtype of atrio-ventricular septal defects with exclusive ventricular shunting and demonstrate that, contrary to current hypotheses, these CHD are not due to failure in formation of the dorsal mesenchymal protrusion."

These affect almost 1% of the population and are a major cause of morbidity and infant mortality (<a href=\"#bib15\">Fahed et al., 2013</a>). The chance of being born with CHD is drastically increased (to ~50%) in DS (<a href=\"#bib49\">Vis et al., 2009</a>) in which a range of heart defects is seen, including ventricular septal defects (VSD) and outflow tract abnormalities such as overriding aorta (OA) and double outlet right ventricle (DORV). Notably, defects that affect the atrioventricular (AV) junction, especially atrio-ventricular septal defects (AVSD) (<a href=\"#bib16\">Freeman et al., 1998</a>) are often seen in DS. AVSD comprise a spectrum of cardiac malformations characterized by a common AV junction, guarded by an essentially common valve, as opposed to separate AV junctions guarded by mitral and tricuspid valves. People diagnosed with AVSD can present with communication between left and right heart chambers (shunting) at the atrial level (ostium primum defect) or at the ventricular level or with shunting at both atrial and ventricular levels (<a href=\"#bib30\">Mahle et al., 2006</a>)."

In humans, rare cases of partial trisomy 21 have been used to identify critical regions that contain dosage-sensitive genes that when present in 3 copies cause DS phenotypes (<a href=\"#bib12\">Delabar et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Korbel et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Korenberg et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Lyle et al., 2009</a>).

The first two DS models generated, Ts65Dn (<a href=\"#bib11\">Davisson et al., 1990</a>) and Ts1Cje (<a href=\"#bib40\">Sago et al., 1998</a>) have duplications of regions of mouse chromosome 16 (Mmu16) that are orthologous to Hsa21, and have been used to identify dosage-sensitive genes contributing to some DS phenotypes (<a href=\"#bib3\">Baek et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Chakrabarti et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Lana-Elola et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Salehi et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Sussan et al., 2008</a>). However, both models also have additional aneuploidy (trisomy of 60 genes on Mmu17 in Ts65Dn and monosomy of 7 genes on Mmu12 in Ts1Cje mice), making interpretation of their phenotypes difficult (<a href=\"#bib13\">Duchon et al., 2011</a>). Another DS model, the Tc1 mouse, carries a freely-segregating copy of Hsa21 and shows many DS phenotypes, including CHD (<a href=\"#bib14\">Dunlevy et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">O'Doherty et al., 2005</a>), although the Hsa21 in this strain is not intact and the mice are mosaic for the human chromosome, again making interpretation difficult (<a href=\"#bib19\">Gribble et al., 2013</a>). Thanks to recent advances in chromosome engineering, a number of mouse strains with duplications of regions of mouse chromosomes orthologous to Hsa21 have been generated, resulting in partial trisomies, including the most complete mouse model for DS to date (Dp(16)1Yey/+;Dp(17)1Yey/+;Dp(10)1Yey/+), which carries a duplication of all Hsa21-orthologous regions on Mmu16, Mmu17 and Mmu10 (<a href=\"#bib6\">Brault et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Li et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Liu et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Olson et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Pereira et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Yu et al., 2010</a>).

We use this panel to investigate the cardiac defects in DS, employing high-resolution episcopic microscopy (HREM) to analyze the precise three-dimensional (3D) morphology of the developing hearts. This combined approach enabled us to narrow down the critical region for CHD in DS to a minimal region containing 39 protein-coding genes and to show that this region contains at least two dosage-sensitive loci required in three copies to cause CHD. Furthermore using dual-wavelength HREM we show that the DMP develops normally in these DS models, and conclude that CHD in these DS models are not caused by failure in formation or growth of the DMP."

Of the protein-coding genes on Hsa21 that have orthologues in the mouse, the largest fraction (~58%) is located in the telomeric region of Mmu16. Thus we used long-range Cre/loxP mediated recombination to engineer the Dp1Tyb mouse strain carrying a duplication from <i>Lipi</i> to <i>Zbtb21</i> on Mmu16 spanning 23 Mb and 148 coding genes. We then generated 3 further strains with contiguous segmental duplications completely covering the region duplicated in Dp1Tyb: Dp9Tyb (from <i>Lipi</i> to <i>Hunk</i>), Dp2Tyb (from <i>Mis18a</i> to <i>Runx1</i>) and Dp3Tyb (from <i>Mir802</i> to <i>Zbtb21</i>).

These methods are particularly suited to examination of complex 3D structures, such as the developing heart, overcoming limitations of conventional 2D histological methods. We observed a significant increase of CHD in E14.5 Dp1Tyb embryos compared to their wild-type (Wt) littermates (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a</a>). Detailed examination of heart morphology in the mutant embryos revealed a range of defects (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). About 18% of Dp1Tyb hearts show abnormal arterial trunk arrangements such as OA or DORV with subaortic communication and 62% had a VSD either alone or in combination with other defects (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2b,c</a> and <a href=\"#media1\">Videos 1</a> and <a href=\"#media2\">2</a>). Two subtypes of VSD were observed: perimembranous VSD (pVSD), located in the membranous portion of the ventricular septum and muscular or trabecular VSD (mVSD), which opens to the inlet of the right ventricle (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2c</a> and <a href=\"#media3\">Videos 3</a> and <a href=\"#media4\">4</a>). Around 25% of Dp1Tyb embryos displayed AVSD presenting two bridging leaflets across the single AV junction and an \u2018unwedged\u2019 morphology of the left outflow tract (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2c</a> and <a href=\"#media5\">Video 5</a>). Notably, the AVSD in Dp1Tyb mice were associated exclusively with a ventricular shunt and never with an atrial shunt (<a href=\"#media6\">Video 6</a>). Thus Dp1Tyb model a subtype of AVSD with a ventricular component, in which the cushions are attached to the leading edge of the atrial septum.

HREM analysis of embryonic hearts at E14.5 revealed that neither Dp9Tyb nor Dp2Tyb showed a significant increase of CHD compared to Wt littermates (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a</a>). In contrast, the telomeric duplication of 39 coding genes in the Dp3Tyb strain was sufficient to cause a significant increase in embryos with CHD. We observed VSD such as pVSD, mVSD in the inlet portion of the ventricular septum, as well as AVSD (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b</a>, <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a> and <a href=\"#media7\">Videos 7</a> and <a href=\"#media8\">8</a>). We noted a reduced frequency of outflow tract defects in Dp3Tyb embryos compared to Dp1Tyb, however this difference was not statistically significant. Overall the types of defects observed in Dp3Tyb were very similar in both type and severity to the ones in Dp1Tyb mice, suggesting that all the dosage-sensitive gene(s) required to cause CHD in Dp1Tyb mice were located in this shorter region."

We and others have previously reported that this strain does not show CHD (<a href=\"#bib14\">Dunlevy et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Liu et al., 2011</a>). However, in our earlier study we had examined Ts1Rhr on the mixed 129S8;C57BL/6JNimr genetic background, whilst Dp1Tyb and Dp3Tyb are maintained on the C57BL/6JNimr background. Thus in order to eliminate possible confounding effects of background differences, we backcrossed Ts1Rhr to the C57BL/6JNimr background and used HREM to look for CHD. Once again we found no increased frequency of CHD in the Ts1Rhr strain (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3c</a>). Thus an extra copy of one or more of the 8 genes duplicated in Dp3Tyb but not in Ts1Rhr is required to cause CHD. Next we analyzed Dp4Tyb, Dp5Tyb and Dp6Tyb mice each of which carry a duplication that between them cover the whole of the duplicated region in Dp3Tyb mice. Remarkably, none of these 3 strains showed significant increased rates of CHDs indicating that there are at least two dosage-sensitive loci in the Dp3Tyb mouse that contribute to CHD (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3c</a>)."

In order to assess if DMP development was perturbed in the Dp1Tyb mouse model of DS, we first established a method to follow its development during formation of the AV junction. The <i>Isl1</i> gene is expressed in the SHF and also in the DMP which is derived from it and hence can be used as a marker for this tissue. We visualized expression of <i>Isl1</i> using 2 different mouse strains: the Isl1Cre (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cai et al., 2008</a>) strain crossed to Rosa26RLacZ reporter mice (<a href=\"#bib44\">Soriano, 1999</a>) to identify cells that are expressing or had expressed <i>Isl1</i>, and thus are derived from the SHF; and the Isl1nLacZ strain (<a href=\"#bib45\">Sun et al., 2007</a>) to visualize ongoing expression of <i>Isl1</i>. Gene expression studies have traditionally relied on staining individual sections and rendering a 3D expression pattern by compiling histological sections, but this approach results in loss of resolution and is constrained by the chosen sectioning plane. To get around this, we utilized dual-wavelength HREM (<a href=\"#bib32\">Mohun and Weninger, 2011</a>) to visualize \u03b2-galactosidase expression in the 3D context of the developing heart in order to get an accurate view of the development of the DMP. At E11.5 analysis of both strains shows there is an expansion of <i>Isl1</i>-expressing mesenchymal tissue from within the right pulmonary ridge, which forms the DMP and has started to protrude ventrally into the cavity of the right atrium (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). One day later at E12.5, the DMP has protruded more ventrally and it is now in contact with the inferior atrioventricular cushion. At these stages both reporters give a similar picture, as the DMP is actively expressing <i>Isl1</i>. Later in development (E13.5) the expression of <i>Isl1</i> diminishes and totally disappears by E14.5 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>) (<a href=\"#bib43\">Snarr et al., 2007b</a>). However development of the DMP can still be followed using the Isl1Cre/Rosa26RLacZ fate reporter strain. This revealed that by E14.5 the DMP forms the ventro-caudal buttress at the core of the AV junction sandwiched between the atrial septum and the endocardial cushions that have now developed into the tricuspid and mitral valves (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Overall, using two different genetic lineage markers of the SHF, these data show a detailed 3D view of the spatio-temporal development of the DMP."

To evaluate this issue directly we examined E14.5 Dp1Tyb hearts with AVSD for the presence of the DMP. Once again we used HREM with 3D modeling and examined the same Wt and Dp1Tyb hearts using three different views. In a short axis view across the AV junction we saw an AVSD in the Dp1Tyb heart with the superior and inferior bridging leaflets across the single AV junction while the Wt heart showed a normal AV junction (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5b</a>, left panels). A long axis four-chamber view of the same hearts showed an intact ventricular septum in the Wt heart but a VSD in the Dp1Tyb heart (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5b</a>, middle panels). Finally, a more dorsal plane of the long axis view of the same hearts showed that the DMP was located in the correct position at the AV junction in both the Wt and the Dp1Tyb hearts (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5b</a>, right panels, and <a href=\"#media6\">Video 6</a>). We performed the same analysis on the Dp3Tyb mice and once again found that the DMP was present in embryos with AVSD (not shown). Taken together these data show that the AVSD found in these new mouse models of DS are not caused by perturbations of the growth of the DMP. Importantly, we note that defects in the DMP have been previously shown to result in atrial septal defects or AVSD with atrial shunting (<a href=\"#bib7\">Briggs et al., 2012</a>), neither of which are seen in Dp1Tyb or Dp3Tyb mice. In contrast these strains show AVSD with exclusive ventricular shunting, implying that this subtype of AVSD must be due to defects in tissues other than the DMP."

Approximately half of all babies born with DS have a heart defect, many of which are serious and need to be surgically repaired. In order to understand the genetic and molecular mechanisms that lead to CHD in DS it is essential to establish mouse models for DS that accurately recapitulate them. Here we report the generation of a new mouse strain Dp1Tyb with a 23 Mb duplication of the entire region of Mmu16 orthologous to Hsa21, and show that it recapitulates the main types of CHD seen in DS. The Dp(16)1Yey mouse strain carries a similar duplication to Dp1Tyb encompassing the same set of genes and was also reported to have heart defects during embryogenesis (<a href=\"#bib24\">Li et al., 2007</a>). Interestingly, the cardiac phenotypes in Dp1Tyb are very similar to the ones we previously observed in the transchromosomic strain Tc1 (<a href=\"#bib14\">Dunlevy et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">O'Doherty et al., 2005</a>), despite differences in the Hsa21 orthologous gene content in the two strains and the different species origin for the duplicated genes: mouse in Dp1Tyb mice, human in Tc1 mice. This phenotypic similarity supports the conclusion that the CHD seen in these strains are caused by the same pathological mechanisms as those in people with DS. As with CHD in humans with DS we observed incomplete penetrance of the phenotype in Dp1Tyb mice. In humans this has been ascribed to genetic modifiers (<a href=\"#bib25\">Li et al., 2012</a>). However the Dp1Tyb mouse strain was analyzed on an inbred background, suggesting that incomplete penetrance may be caused by stochastic effects during embryonic cardiogenesis. While the recovery of E14.5 Dp1Tyb embryos was consistent with expected Mendelian numbers (not shown), the recovery of Dp1Tyb mice at weaning was reduced to 50% of the expected numbers (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Some of this loss could be due to the most severe CHDs, since AVSDs were found in ~25% of E14.5 Dp1Tyb embryos, but it is likely that there are other unknown causes for this perinatal lethality. The other strain to show AVSDs, Dp3Tyb, showed a 25% reduction in recovery of mice at weaning, similar to the observed frequency of AVSDs at E14.5, making this a likely cause of the reduced yield of mutant mice."

We used this mapping panel to identify a 4.9 Mb genomic region (from <i>Mir802</i> to <i>Zbtb21</i>) that when present in 3 copies is sufficient to cause CHD. Furthermore, from analysis of shorter duplications, we show that the phenotype is caused by at least two distinct dosage-sensitive loci. By combining this data with analysis of the Ts1Rhr strain, we have determined that, minimally, one of the two loci lies either in an interval at the centromeric end of the duplication in Dp3Tyb (from <i>Mir802</i> to <i>Setd4</i>) or at the telomeric end (from <i>Mx2</i> to <i>Zbtb21</i>) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6a</a>). These two segments between them contain only 7 coding genes (<i>Setd4, Mx2, Tmprss2, Ripk4, Prdm15, C2cd2</i> and <i>Zbtb21</i>) and one microRNA gene (<i>Mir802</i>), none of which had been previously implicated in causing CHD in DS. A previous study proposed that a 3.7 Mb genomic region of Mmu16 (<i>Ifnar1</i> \u2013 <i>Kcnj6</i>) in Dp(16)4Yey was sufficient to cause CHD (<a href=\"#bib27\">Liu et al., 2013</a>); this region overlaps the centromeric end of the duplicated region of Dp3Tyb by 1.9 Mb from <i>Mir802</i> to <i>Kcnj6</i>, which may help to further narrow down the search for causative genes (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6b</a>). We note that while the Dp5Tyb and Ts1Rhr strains did not show a statistically significant increase in CHDs compared to their wild-type littermate controls, in both strains we detected 2 mutant embryos with AVSDs (out of 20 or 21 embryos analyzed respectively). Thus it is possible that these strains have a weak phenotype \u2013 a larger number of embryos from these strains would need to be analyzed to establish whether this is significant. If true, it would suggest that one or more of the causative genes may reside within the Dp5Tyb interval (which is entirely contained within the Ts1Rhr interval)."

An individual (PM) trisomic for the 7.7 Mb region from <i>PSMG1</i> to <i>PRMT2</i> had a VSD, whereas the shortest partial trisomy (individual BA) that gave rise to AVSD extended 10.0Mb from <i>HLCS</i> to <i>PRMT2</i> (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6b</a>). We note that that while both of these intervals overlap substantially with the minimal Dp3Tyb region identified in our studies, the duplicated region in individual PM does not overlap at all with the <i>Ifnar1</i> \u2013 <i>Kcnj6</i> region identified by Liu et al as being sufficient to cause CHDs (<a href=\"#bib27\">Liu et al., 2013</a>). In particular the human studies suggested that increased dosage of the <i>DSCAM</i> gene may be responsible for the CHDs (<a href=\"#bib21\">Korbel et al., 2009</a>). In contrast the mouse studies show that duplication of <i>Dscam</i> is neither necessary or sufficient to cause CHDs, since the gene is not within the minimal <i>Ifnar1</i> \u2013 <i>Kcnj6</i> region identified by Liu et al as being sufficient for CHDs (<a href=\"#bib27\">Liu et al., 2013</a>) but is duplicated in the Dp6Tyb strain which we show here does not have CHDs. Taking the human and mouse data together, this suggests that several dosage-sensitive genes may contribute to CHDs, with potentially no single gene being absolutely required."

Thus, although Dp1Tyb mice show AVSD, they only model one subtype of AVSD seen in people with DS \u2013 AVSD with ventricular shunting. It is not known why some cases of DS have complete AVSD whereas others have subtypes with only atrial or ventricular shunting, but it is tempting to speculate that there are distinct mechanisms driving defects in the atrial and ventricular septa."

Importantly, a variety of different genetic manipulations that affect the DMP all resulted in AVSD with exclusive atrial shunting, demonstrating the importance of the DMP for the correct formation of the atrial side of the AV junction (<a href=\"#bib7\">Briggs et al., 2012</a>). In contrast, in Dp1Tyb mice we found normal DMP development and no AVSD with atrial shunting, but instead saw exclusively AVSD with ventricular shunting (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6c</a>). Thus we propose that defects in the atrial septum causing the ostium primum type of AVSD are caused by malformation of the DMP, whereas ventricular defects are due to perturbations in other tissues, such as endocardial cushions or myocardium. Interestingly, Gata4-deficient mice display AVSD and have a normal DMP, but show perturbations in myocardial signaling to the adjacent atrioventricular cushion mesenchyme, suggesting that defects in myocardial signaling could lead to AVSD (<a href=\"#bib31\">Misra et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Rajagopal et al., 2007</a>). To our knowledge the Dp1Tyb and Dp3Tyb mouse strains are the first to have been shown to have AVSD with ventricular shunting and thus will allow direct studies of the pathological mechanisms underlying this subtype of AVSD."

Hearts from Ts1Rhr and Dp5Tyb each had 2 AVSD (of 21 and 20 examined respectively), which is undoubtedly statistically different from the incidences in Dp1Tyb and Dp3Tyb, but it is difficult to say with certainty that there is no effect in Ts1Rhr and Dp5Tyb, particularly given that there was only 1 AVSD observed in about 170 wild type hearts. There could be a weak combinatorial effect of a number of genes throughout the region. The authors should be more cautious in the wording of their conclusions.

In other words, this 1.77 Mb region has been identified based on several individuals and on mouse data, and there is no known individual trisomic just for this 1.77 Mb region who has CHD. In view of this, we thought it was more useful to show the extent of trisomy in two individuals (PM and BA) reported in Korbel 2009 who had the shortest trisomies leading to VSD and AVSD (7.7 Mb and 10.0 Mb respectively). As can be seen in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>, these two regions overlap partly with the Dp3Tyb region reported in our study, but the trisomy in individual PM does not overlap with the <i>Ifnar1-Kcnj6</i> region identified by Liu et al. 2013. Taken together this suggests that several dosage-sensitive genes may contribute to CHDs, with potentially no single gene being absolutely required."

We can point to our earlier study with Tc1 mice where we found the frequency of CHDs after N2 backcross to B6 was higher than that found in embryos on a 129xB6 F1 background (Dunlevy 2010), implying that more backcrossing to B6 makes the phenotype stronger.

The sequences nearest the duplication will always be 129P2-derived, and the extent of remaining 129P2 DNA around this point is variable will depend stochastically on the location of meiotic crossovers.

Of course it might turn out that all three intervals are needed, in which case we might need to make a triple Dp4Tyb x Dp5Tyb x Dp6Tyb cross to reconstitute the phenotype, which would take longer still.
