ORC1, the Origin Recognition Complex (ORC) large subunit, is inherited into newly born cells after it binds to condensing chromosomes during the preceding mitosis. We demonstrate that ORC1 represses Cyclin E gene (<i>CCNE1</i>) transcription, an E2F1 activated gene that is also repressed by the Retinoblastoma (RB) protein. ORC1 binds to RB, the histone methyltransferase SUV39H1 and to its repressive histone H3K9me3 mark. ORC1 cooperates with SUV39H1 and RB protein to repress E2F1-dependent <i>CCNE1</i> transcription. In contrast, the ORC1-related replication protein CDC6 binds Cyclin E-CDK2 kinase and in a feedback loop removes RB from ORC1, thereby hyper-activating <i>CCNE1</i> transcription. The opposing effects of ORC1 and CDC6 in controlling the level of Cyclin E ensures genome stability and a mechanism for linking directly DNA replication and cell division commitment."

The Cyclin E-CDK2 kinase inhibitory activity is compromised by <i>ORC1</i> Meier-Gorlin syndrome mutations that also alter the interaction between ORC1 and histone H4K20me2 (<a href=\"#bib27\">Hossain and Stillman, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Kuo et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Zhang et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bicknell et al., 2011b</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bicknell et al., 2011a</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">de Munnik et al., 2012</a>). Unlike the well-characterized yeast complex that is a stable, six subunit complex throughout the cell division cycle, ORC in human cells is a very dynamic complex (<a href=\"#bib57\">Sasaki and Gilbert, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">DePamphilis, 2005</a>). ORC1 binds to mitotic chromosomes as cells enter into mitosis (<a href=\"#bib30\">Kara et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Okuno et al., 2001</a>), and in human cells, it is modified by ubiquitin and then degraded during the G1 to S phase transition (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abdurashidova et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Kara et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Kreitz et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Mendez et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Ohta et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Siddiqui and Stillman, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Tatsumi et al., 2000</a>).

This decision is made by a complex regulatory process known as START in yeast and the restriction point in mammalian cells (<a href=\"#bib28\">Johnson and Skotheim, 2013</a>). Key among these regulators are the Cyclin D-CDK4/6 kinases that mono-phosphorylate the retinoblastoma (RB)\u00a0protein and contributes to the release of repression of E2F-transcription factors (<a href=\"#bib42\">Narasimha et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Ewen et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Hinds et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Lundberg and Weinberg, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Resnitzky et al., 1994</a>). E2F1-regulated genes include genes encoding Cyclin E (<i>CCNE1</i>) and CDC6 (<a href=\"#bib24\">Hateboer et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Ohtani et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Yan et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">DeGregori et al., 1995</a>). Cyclin E-CDK2 amplifies the phosphorylation of RB, but how this is achieved is not known (<a href=\"#bib42\">Narasimha et al., 2014</a>). Here, we demonstrate that ORC1 is required for repression of the gene encoding Cyclin E and that CDC6 is involved in relieving the repression in cooperation with Cyclin E-CDK2. We suggest that ORC1 establishes a period in the newly\u00a0born cells during which Cyclin E is not expressed, allowing time for the cells to decide whether to proliferate again or enter into replicative quiescence."

That work suggested that ORC1 might also control Cyclin E by regulating its protein level during the G1 phase of the cell division cycle. To determine if this was the case, ORC1 was depleted using siRNA in U2OS cells that had been synchronized in mitosis by nocodazole treatment and released into the next cell cycle. As early as 9\u2009hr post release, Cyclin E protein level was elevated in ORC1-depleted U2OS cells, compared to control siRNA treated cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>).

RB binds other binding partners dependent on a canonical LxCxE motif and although ORC1 has a conserved LPCR<sup>D</sup>/<sub>E</sub> sequence, it was not required for the interaction between ORC1 and RB (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A and B</a>). Consistent with this finding, two pocket mutants within RB (R661W and N757F) that are defective in binding to LxCxE containing proteins (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chen and Wang, 2000</a>) showed no defect in binding to ORC1 in vitro (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>) or in vivo (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). In fact, the mutant RB proteins bound ORC1 better than the wild type, perhaps due to loss of competition between ORC1 and other RB binding proteins or due to conformational changes in RB. When Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP)-RB fusion protein was expressed in cells with ORC1-Flag-tagged protein, the ORC1-Flag protein bound WT and pocket mutant RB, but other ORC subunits did not bind to RB (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). We confirmed this observation by showing that immunoprecipitation with anti-ORC2 or anti-ORC3 antibodies failed to precipitate GFP-RB or its mutants, but did bind ORC1-Flag (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). Given that the ORC1-RB interaction is independent of other ORC subunits, it suggests that ORC1 has additional functions that are separate from its role in DNA replication."

Specifically, it has been suggested that RB binds to the SUV39H1 histone methyltransferase that tri-methylates histone H3K9 and then HP1\u03b1 binds to histone H3K9me3 and that these direct interactions contribute to repression of <i>CCNE1</i> transcription (<a href=\"#bib44\">Nielsen et al., 2001</a>). It is important to note, however, that others suggested that another protein mediates the RB-SUV39H1 interaction (<a href=\"#bib64\">Vandel et al., 2001</a>). Since ORC1 interacts with both RB and HP1\u03b1 (<a href=\"#bib52\">Prasanth et al., 2010</a>), we tested whether ORC1 also interacts with SUV39H1. Using purified proteins we found that both RB and ORC1 directly bound to SUV39H1, and ORC1 directly bound to CDC6 (<a href=\"#bib56\">Saha et al., 1998</a>) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Under these conditions, ORC1 bound to HP1\u03b1 weakly, but the binding increased when higher levels of GST-HP1\u03b1 were added, consistent with published data (<a href=\"#bib52\">Prasanth et al., 2010</a>). Although both RB and ORC1 directly interacted with SUV39H1, ORC1 bound SUV39H1 much better than RB (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A\u2013D</a>). Consistent with the in vitro\u00a0data, we observed that anti-SUV39H1 antibodies precipitated ORC1 and RB in the RB-positive cells (U2OS and MCF7), with ORC1 being the predominant interacting protein in MCF7 cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Furthermore, the interaction between SUV39H1 with ORC1 protein did not require RB because anti-ORC1 antibodies co-precipitated SUV39H1 from RB-negative SaOS-2 cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). This observation was confirmed when GFP-RB or GFP-ORC1 were transiently expressed with T7-SUV39H1 in 293 cells; ORC1 more readily bound to SUV39H1 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>), whereas higher levels of GFP-RB were required to observe an interaction with SUV39H1 (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>). Domain mapping demonstrated that SUV39H1 interacted with ORC1 through its SET domain containing C-terminus, which is required for its histone methyltransferase (HMT) activity. Moreover, SUV39H1 interacted with ORC1 and ORC1 mutants that could not be phosphorylated by Cyclin-CDK and did not interact in a complex with other ORC subunits, similar to the ORC1-RB interaction (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3B\u2013C</a>). These data suggest that the ORC1-SUV39H1 interaction does not require other ORC subunits or CDK phosphorylation of ORC1, and therefore ORC1 plays a role independent of its role in DNA replication."

Purified ORC1 bound to unmodified or mono-, di- or tri-methylated H3K9 or H3K14-tri-methyl modifications, while the interaction was abolished when histone H3 was acetylated at the same positions or when H3 serine-10 was phosphorylated, which normally occurs during mitosis (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). Thus, ORC1 can bind to RB, SUV39H1 and to the repressive H3K9-me3 modification on histone H3, suggesting that it might mediate repression of E2F1-dependent <i>CCNE1</i> transcription."

Transfection of plasmids expressing E2F1 and its binding partner DP1 activated gene expression, whereas expression of ORC1 or SUV39H1 protein repressed <i>CCNE1</i> expression in a dose-dependent manner (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>). In a GAL4-based reporter gene assay, expression of either GAL4-ORC1 or GAL4-SUV39H1 also repressed transcription of the reporter gene in a dose-dependent manner (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4A</a>). In contrast, neither expression of ORC3 nor ORC4 altered E2F1-driven <i>CCNE1</i> transcription (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4B</a>). Moreover, SUV39H1 co-operated with ORC1 to further repress the <i>CCNE1</i> promoter, but a mutant of SUV39H1 (H324K) (<a href=\"#bib34\">Li et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Rea et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Stewart et al., 2005</a>) that has lost its catalytic activity was unable to do so (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>). We therefore conclude that ORC1-SUV39H1 co-operation for transcriptional repression of the <i>CCNE1</i> gene is mediated through the HMT activity of SUV39H1."

A previous publication (<a href=\"#bib14\">Dellino et al., 2013</a>) reported ORC1 chromatin immuno-precipitation following crosslinking (ChIP) and re-analysis this whole genome Chip-Seq data revealed a weak ORC1 peak (peak height of 7 reads) within the <i>CCNE1</i> promoter; however, a duplicate was not reported. Therefore, to test whether ORC1 associated with the <i>CCNE1</i> promoter, we modified a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) method for ORC1 initially using asynchronously growing MCF7 cells and the immunoprecipitated DNA was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using multiple primer pairs across the <i>CCNE1</i> promoter (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). ORC1 bound to the <i>CCNE1</i> promoter encompassing the region from -280 to +63 base pairs (probes E and F), a region that is known to bind the E2F1 transcription factor (see Gene Expression Omnibus [GEO] transcription factor binding site accession numbers GSM935484 and GSM935477) and contains five E2F1 consensus binding sites (red bars, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Our ChIP analysis also showed that RB bound to the same regions bound by ORC1, but not to other probes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>).

Since CDC6 protein levels increase during late G1 phase (<a href=\"#bib24\">Hateboer et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Mendez and Stillman, 2000</a>) and CDC6 binds ORC1 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), we hypothesized that CDC6 may help alleviate ORC1-mediated repression of the <i>CCNE1</i> gene. CDC6 and Cyclin E-CDK2 were purified and increasing amounts were titrated into a mixture containing purified RB and ORC1 (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) and the interaction between RB and ORC1 was monitored. MBP-ORC1 bound to CDC6 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>) and increasing amounts of Cyclin E-CDK2 did not interfere with this interaction (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Moreover, increased binding between CDC6 and ORC1 did not interfere with binding between ORC1 and RB (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>).

If this is the case, then CDC6 overexpression should increase <i>CCNE1</i> expression in vivo.\u00a0To test this hypothesis, we expressed GFP-tagged CDC6 wild type or its 'Cy' mutant in nocodazole arrested U2OS cells and released them from the nocodazole block to estimate the level of endogenous Cyclin E protein at different times in G1. Expression of wild type CDC6 but not its 'Cy' mutant led to an increase in the endogenous level of Cyclin E protein (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). In fact, the Cdc6 'Cy' mutant acted as a dominant negative to prevent normal Cyclin E expression. Consistent with these results, overexpression of CDC6 wild type but not its 'Cy' mutant further enhanced E2F1-DP1 activated transcription from the <i>CCNE1</i> promoter (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>). Based on these data, we suggest that CDC6 co-operates with Cyclin E-CDK2 kinase to abolish the interaction between RB and ORC1, contributing to alleviating the repression imposed by RB on the <i>CCNE1</i> gene, leading to <i>CCNE1</i> gene transcription."

We therefore transfected into RB<sup>+</sup> U2OS cells a <i>CCNE1</i>-luciferase reporter plasmid with E2F1-DP1 and depleted ORC1, SUV39H1 or CDC6 using siRNA (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Depletion of either ORC1 or SUV39H1 with two different siRNAs led to significant increases in <i>CCNE1</i> promoter activity above its basal, E2F1/DP1-dependent level. In contrast, depletion of CDC6 protein had no effect on the basal, E2F1/DP1-dependent promoter activity (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). We further investigated the binding to the <i>CCNE1</i> promoter of SUV39H1 and the presence of its product, the histone H3K9me3 mark, upon depletion of ORC1 protein in asynchronously growing U2OS cells by ChIP assay. Upon depletion of ORC1 compared to control siRNA the methyltransferase activity of SUV39H1 was drastically reduced on the <i>CCNE1</i> promoter as evident by a dramatic reduction in the histone H3K9m3 mark at the promoter, while the binding of SUV39H1 was only slightly reduced (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). The reduced binding of H3K9me3 was most evident within the region -280 to -143 of the <i>CCNE1</i> promoter, where ORC1 binding was centered (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Depletion of ORC1 also resulted in reduced levels of the histone H3K9me3 mark as well as a slight reduction in the level of SUV39H1 protein (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Our results support the hypothesis that ORC1 is involved in transcription repression by recruiting the SUV39H1 protein, which thereby creates the histone H3K9me3 transcriptional repressor mark on <i>CCNE1</i> promoter."

In contrast, ORC1 in the budding yeast <i>S. cerevisiae</i> binds to the Sir1 protein and is involved in repression of transcription of mating type genes (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bell et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Triolo and Sternglanz, 1996</a>). In <i>Drosophila</i> and animal cells, ORC, including human ORC1, binds the HP1 proteins that are often involved in transcriptional repression, but a direct link between this interaction and transcription repression has not been established (<a href=\"#bib2\">Auth et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Badugu et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Lidonnici et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Pak et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Prasanth et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Sasaki and Gilbert, 2007</a>). In this report, we have established opposing roles for ORC1 and CDC6 in control of transcription of the Cyclin E gene <i>CCNE1</i>. ORC1, with RB and SUV39H1, bind to the <i>CCNE1</i> promoter adjacent to the E2F1 transcription factor binding sites and repress the E2F1-dependent promoter and this repression is relieved by CDC6 that is bound to Cyclin E-CDK2 kinase. Consistent with this model, CDC6 binds to the <i>CCNE1</i> promoter transiently, just at the time during G1 phase when Cyclin E levels increase dramatically. We suggest that low levels of both Cyclin E and CDC6, both E2F1-controlled genes, appear upon activation of Cyclin D-CDK4 (<a href=\"#bib42\">Narasimha et al., 2014</a>). The expression of CDC6-Cyclin E-CDK2 provides positive feedback, disrupting the repressive RB-ORC1 interaction. The disruption of RB-ORC1 interaction further weakens ORC1 association the with\u00a0promoter and results in a dramatic reduction in the repressive histone H3K9me3 mark at the promoter, increasing <i>CCNE1</i> gene transcription and amplifying the levels of CDC6 and Cyclin E-CDK2 (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>, bottom panel). The opposing expression levels of ORC1 and CDC6 during the cell cycle (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>, top panel) are consistent with this model. The production of higher levels of Cyclin E-CDK2 and CDC6 can then function in pre-RC assembly, as they are known to do (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cook et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Coverley et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Hateboer et al., 1998</a>)."

If proliferation and cell division are destined to occur, Cyclin D-CDK4/6 mono-phosphorylates RB and primes it for Cyclin E-dependent activation of E2F regulated genes (<a href=\"#bib42\">Narasimha et al., 2014</a>). We show that low levels of CDC6-Cycin-E-CDK2 can, in a feedback loop, amplify this commitment by antagonizing ORC1-RB interactions (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). Consistent with the model, we demonstrated that over-expression of CDC6, but not a CDC6 that cannot bind Cyclin E, enhances the levels of endogenous Cyclin E during the very earliest period of G1 phase. Cell-cycle regulated Cyclin E is essential for maintenance of genome stability since cancer cells that have de-regulated Cyclin E fail to produce sufficient pre-RCs during G1 phase and as a consequence have problems in S phase and accumulate DNA damage (<a href=\"#bib19\">Ekholm-Reed et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Jones et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Odajima et al., 2010</a>).

We suggest that the events that occur at the <i>CCNE1</i> promoter, ORC1 binding first and recruitment of SUV39H1 and RB, followed by recruitment of Cyclin E-CDK2 and CDC6, may occur at many ORC1 binding sites in the genome, even those sites that are destined to assemble the entire ORC protein and promote pre-RC formation. SUV39H1 binding to ORC1 may influence its temporally dynamic nuclear localization during G1 phase. Such a scenario may also explain observations that have implicated a role for RB in DNA replication (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bosco et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Kennedy et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Sterner et al., 1998</a>).

The beads were washed 3 times with washing buffer containing 20\u00a0mM Tris-HCl pH7.5, 100\u00a0mM NaCl, 0.1% NP-40, 5\u00a0mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.1\u2009mM EDTA, 10% Glycerol, 1\u00a0mM DTT and protease as well as phosphatase inhibitor tablets from Roche. Finally, the washed beads were suspended in Laemmli sample buffer and 8% SDS-PAGE gels were run and immunoblotted. For immunoprecipitation of endogenous ORC1 and SUV39H1 proteins from U2OS or MCF7 cells and SaOS-2 cells, we have used monoclonal ORC1 antibody coupled to magnetic beads as described previously (<a href=\"#bib30\">Kara et al., 2015</a>) as well as rabbit polyclonal SUV39H1 antibody (A302-128A; Bethyl Laboratories), respectively."

The cells (3.0x10<sup>7</sup>) were fixed with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. The cross-linking was stopped by addition 125\u2009mM of glycine for 5 min on ice. The fixed cells were washed with cold PBS and lysed for 10 min on ice with buffer containing 10\u2009mM Tris pH 8.0, 10\u2009mM NaCl, 2\u2009mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.4% NP40, 1\u2009mM DTT, 10% Glycerol, protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Preliminary experiments demonstrated that ORC1 was most efficiently extracted from the resulting cells by digestion of the cross-linked chromatin with micrococcal nuclease (MNase; Sigma) and extraction with high salt (300\u2013600\u2009mM NaCl). Thus, the nuclei were treated with MNase with 1\u2009mM CaCl2 at 37\u00b0C (so that most of the extracted DNA ran on an agarose gel as ~1\u20134 nucleosome length), the reaction was quenched with 2\u2009mM EGTA and washed with buffer containing 10\u2009mM Tris pH 8.0, 10\u2009mM NaCl, 2\u2009mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1\u2009mM DTT, 10% Glycerol, protease and phosphatase inhibitors. The pelleted residual nuclei were further lysed in buffer containing 20\u00a0mM Tris pH 8.0, 1\u2009mM EDTA, 0.5\u2009mM EGTA, 300\u2009mM NaCl, 0.5% TritonX-100, 0.05% Sodium Deoxycholate, 0.1% IGE-PAL, 1\u2009mM PMSF and protease/phosphatase inhibitors for 30\u2009min at 4\u00b0C with rotation. The lysate was further diluted to bring the salt concentration to 200\u2009mM and sonicated very briefly. The lysate was centrifuged (20,800 X g in an Eppendorf centrifuge) at 4\u00b0C to pellet down the debris and supernatant was used for pre-clearing with protein G Dynabeads (Invitrogen) for 2\u2009hr 4\u00b0C. The antibodies were bound to protein G Dynabeads for 5\u2009hr at 4\u00b0C in PBS containing 0.5% BSA. The antibodies used for chromatin immunoprecipitation were as follows: mouse monoclonal ORC1 [78-1-172; (<a href=\"#bib30\">Kara et al., 2015</a>)], mouse RB (#9309, Cell Signaling), rabbit polyclonal SUV39H1 (A302-128A; Bethyl Laboratories), rabbit polyclonal CDC6 (CS1881), rabbit polyclonal histone H3K9me3 (ab8898, Abcam) as well as control mouse and rabbit IgG (Invitrogen). Pre-cleared nuclear extracts was incubated with antibody-bound beads overnight with rotation at 4\u00b0C. 0.4\u2009ml of the nuclear extract was used for each IP and 0.1\u2009ml was kept aside for 'Input' in Q-PCR analysis. Beads were then washed with three times with low-salt buffer (20\u00a0mM Tris pH8.0, 200\u00a0mM NaCl, 0.5% TritonX-100, 0.05% Sodium Deoxycholate, 0.1% IGE-PAL, 1\u2009mM PMSF), three times high-salt buffer (20\u00a0mM Tris pH8.0, 500\u00a0mM NaCl, 0.5% TritonX-100, 0.05% Sodium Deoxycholate, 0.1% IGE-PAL, 1\u2009mM PMSF), three times with lithium chloride buffer (20\u00a0mM Tris pH8.0, 200\u00a0mM NaCl, 250\u00a0mM LiCl, 0.5% TritonX-100, 0.05% Sodium Deoxycholate, 0.1% IGE-PAL, 1\u2009mM PMSF) and twice with TE buffer (10\u00a0mM Tris pH8.0, 1\u2009mM EDTA). Chromatin was eluted from beads twice with 100 ul elution buffer (100\u2009mM sodium bicarbonate, 1% SDS) at room temperature. Protein-DNA crosslinks in the IP samples as well as in input samples were reversed overnight by addition of 300\u2009mM NaCl and 2 ug RNase A at 65\u00b0C. The ChIP and input samples were then incubated with 60 ug of proteinase K for 2\u2009hr at 42\u00b0C. The samples were further extracted with phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alchol [IAA] (once for ChIP and twice for input) and once with chloroform extraction. The ethanol precipitation were done by adding 10 ug of glycogen, washed with 70% ethanol, air dried and then re-suspended in 50 ul of RNase-DNase free water. The purified DNA was used as template in different PCR amplifications (Applied Biosystems Thermocycler). The sequences of the various primers is listed in <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>. Due to very high GC content of human <i>CCNE1</i> promoter, the number of PCR cycles was extensively and independently optimized with different DNA polymerases (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>) for each primer set to maintain linear amplification in all experiments. PCR products were resolved by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis. Images of ethidium bromide-stained DNAs were acquired using an UV trans-illuminator equipped with a digital camera. Intensities of the amplified PCR bands were quantitated by ImageJ software."

As the central ATPase and the major DNA binding subunit of the ORC complex, ORC1 is of course key for the initiation of DNA replication; the protein also functions in the regulation of centrosomes and centrioles in direct ways through its negative regulation of Cyclin E-dependent CDK activity. The present story ostensibly is about the roles of ORC1 in negative regulation of the transcription of the Cyclin E gene (<i>CCNE1</i>) through the recruitment of SUV39H1, binding directly to the proximal regulatory regions of the gene. The model put forward is that together with Rb, E2F1/DP and HP1 the transcription is turned down. The work then builds upon the finding that Cdc6 interferes in many of their assays with this negative regulation. All together a fascinating and potentially exciting proposal is made that links all of this into a model for how an autocatalytic stimulatory cascade, starting with cyclin D/Cdk activity in early G1 might feed into a control for a switch to enough Cyclin E expression to execute progression through the restriction point. We believe that the work is at present not yet ready for a publication in <i>eLife</i> but would be with further critical new studies that substantiate the overarching and exciting new ideas."

Many other such experiments are consistent with the central proposals as are the scholarly arguments tying together points from the literature. However, one finds most of the cell-based findings dependent upon over-expression of recombinant proteins and acute transfection protocols."

What is missing is a clear demonstration that (a) the endogenous CCNE promoter is epigenetically repressed by the recruitment of this ORC1-dependent complex under normal levels of expression of E2F1/DP1, Rb, ORC1 and SUV39H1 and (b) that the physical interaction of endogenous levels of ORC1 with Rb and SUV39H1 is essential for this regulation. If this deficit is rectified, there could be two papers: \"ORC1 inhibits CCNE by epigenetic modification of the CCNE promoter\" and \"CDC6 together with Cyclin E-CDK2, disrupts an ORC1-RB-SUV39H1 repressor complex to activate the CCNE promoter\". While we do not suggest writing two papers the authors should in a revision more completely describe how CDC6 actually works for activation (see below #9)."

At the time of initial submission of this paper to <i>eLife</i>, we tried to do conventional chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays for ORC1 protein but our attempts failed due to highly GC-rich region of <i>CCNE1</i> promoter. The region -363 to +63 of <i>CCNE1</i> promoter is 85% GC rich, where all of the E2F1 sites lie and RB protein binds. Thus conventional ChIP-seq experiments did not work. Because of the reviewers\u2019 comments, we invested considerable time in designing specific primer pairs that would allow detection of protein binding using ChIP and PCR. We also optimized the immunoprecipitation protocol using a monoclonal anti-ORC1 antibody that we made that specifically immunoprecipitates human ORC1 and found that ChIP using this antibody best worked with chromatin fragmented by micrococcal nuclease, followed by salt extraction from nuclei (ORC1 is known to bind tightly with a nuclear structure). Using this new protocol and synchronization of cells into early G1 phase, we were able to detect binding of ORC1, SUV39H1 and RB to the <i>CCNE1</i> promoter in early G1 phase and transient CDC6 binding to the <i>CCNE1</i> promoter precisely at the time when the promoter is activated in vivo. In the revised manuscript, we provide the data for binding ORC1, RB, SUV39H1, H3K9me3 and CDC6 proteins to the <i>CCNE1</i> promoter in asynchronously growing MCF7 cells as well as in synchronized U2OS cells."

What is missing is a clear demonstration that (a) the endogenous CCNE promoter is epigenetically repressed by the recruitment of this ORC1-dependent complex under normal levels of expression of E2F1/DP1, Rb, ORC1 and SUV39H1 and (b) that the physical interaction of endogenous levels of ORC1 with Rb and SUV39H1 is essential for this regulation. If this deficit is rectified, there could be two papers: \"ORC1 inhibits CCNE by epigenetic modification of the CCNE promoter\" and \"CDC6 together with Cyclin E-CDK2, disrupts an ORC1-RB-SUV39H1 repressor complex to activate the CCNE promoter\". While we do not suggest writing two papers the authors should in a revision more completely describe how CDC6 actually works for activation (see below #9).</i>"

We suggest that repression is caused by DNA binding proteins recruited to the <i>CCNE1</i> promoter and establishment of a histone H3K9me3 mark that can bind HP1. The combination of ORC1, RB and SUV39H1 results in the repressive histone H3K9me3 mark at the promoter. We provide new data that shows that this repressive mark on the endogenous promoter is dependent on ORC1. Furthermore, our new data from synchronized U2OS cells shows binding of ORC1, RB, SUV39H1 to the <i>CCNE1</i> promoter in early G1 phase and then at the time when Cyclin E levels increase, CDC6 is transiently recruited to the endogenous <i>CCNE1</i> promoter. These data are entirely consistent with our model that ORC1 and CDC6 have opposing roles in control of <i>CCNE1</i> gene transcription. The experiments were done under normal levels of expression of E2F1/DP1, RB, ORC1 and SUV39H1 proteins. The significance of CDC6 in transcriptional activation is more elaborated in the revised manuscript. Entirely consistent with the model, we showed that increased expression of CDC6 actually causes increases in endogenous Cyclin E protein levels very early in G1 phase.

For example, we have the mapped the region in ORC1 required for binding the SUV39H1 protein using in vitro interactions, but when mutant versions were used in vivo, it was not as straight forward as the in vitro data. We suspect that this might be due to the fact that RB interacts also with SUV39H1. We also mapped the regions of ORC1 that interacts with RB and found that the N-terminus of ORC1 binds the C-terminus of RB, but in addition, the C-terminus of ORC1 binds the N-terminus of RB. Thus the interaction between ORC1 and RB involves two separate domains in both proteins. Thus, in the present study, it was difficult to map the minimal interaction region in ORC1 required to bind either SUV39H1 or RB proteins and do the experiments suggested. We are continuing to study these protein-protein interactions, but think the new additional data strengthens our paper without this protein interaction data."
