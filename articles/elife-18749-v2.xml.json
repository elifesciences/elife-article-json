To do so, corollary discharges are conveyed to sensory areas and gate expected reafference. Such gating is observed in neonatal rats during wake-related movements. In contrast, twitches, which are self-generated movements produced during active (or REM) sleep, differ from wake movements in that they reliably trigger robust neural activity. Accordingly, we hypothesized that the gating actions of corollary discharge are absent during twitching. Here, we identify the external cuneate nucleus (ECN), which processes sensory input from the forelimbs, as a site of movement-dependent sensory gating during wake. Whereas pharmacological disinhibition of the ECN unmasked wake-related reafference, twitch-related reafference was unaffected. This is the first demonstration of a neural comparator that is differentially engaged depending on the kind of movement produced. This mechanism explains how twitches, although self-generated, trigger abundant reafferent activation of sensorimotor circuits in the developing brain."

To do so, corollary discharges are conveyed to sensory areas and gate expected reafference. Such gating is observed in neonatal rats during wake-related movements. In contrast, twitches, which are self-generated movements produced during active (or REM) sleep, differ from wake movements in that they reliably trigger robust neural activity. Accordingly, we hypothesized that the gating actions of corollary discharge are absent during twitching. Here, we identify the external cuneate nucleus (ECN), which processes sensory input from the forelimbs, as a site of movement-dependent sensory gating during wake. Whereas pharmacological disinhibition of the ECN unmasked wake-related reafference, twitch-related reafference was unaffected. This is the first demonstration of a neural comparator that is differentially engaged depending on the kind of movement produced. This mechanism explains how twitches, although self-generated, trigger abundant reafferent activation of sensorimotor circuits in the developing brain."

These experiments show that a brain area known as the external cuneate nucleus (ECN) was mostly inactive when awake rats vigorously moved their front legs, but became highly active when these same legs twitched during sleep. Drugs that disinhibited electrical activity in the ECN unmasked leg movement signals produced by awake rats, but these same drugs had no effect on leg movement signals produced during twitching. Thus, these experiments indicate that, when infant rats are awake, the ECN compares signals from the senses with signals from the parts of the brain that produce movements, a key feature of motor control. However, when the rats are asleep and twitching, the comparison mechanism is disengaged and sensory signals are allowed to cascade through the ECN to many other structures in the brain."

Also, the challenge remains to identify the specific mechanisms by which twitches help develop and refine the brain circuits that enable mammals to move around as effectively as they do."

First, to be a comparator, the ECN must be a sensory structure; in fact, the ECN processes proprioceptive inputs from forelimb and nuchal muscles (<a href=\"#bib14\">Campbell et al., 1974</a>) and recordings from anesthetized cats have demonstrated that the ECN codes, with high fidelity, the stretch on muscle fibers (<a href=\"#bib30\">Mackie et al., 1999</a>). Second, the ECN must receive motor-related input; in fact, the ECN receives direct and indirect input from premotor areas, including the red nucleus (<a href=\"#bib25\">Holstege and Tan, 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Edwards, 1972</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Martin et al., 1974</a>) and C3-C4 PNs (<a href=\"#bib33\">Pivetta et al., 2014</a>). Third, the ECN should not participate in the production of movement; as shown here, disinhibition of the ECN had no discernible effect on the production of wake movements or twitches (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>)."

Therefore, it may be that (a) premotor structures like the red nucleus are state-dependently modulated such that they convey motor copies to the ECN (or an intervening structure) only during wake movements, or (b) the ECN receives motor copies from both types of movements, but state-dependent modulation of the ECN prevents the twitch-related motor copies from engaging the inhibitory mechanism. Indeed, in neonatal rats, there are structures, including the noradrenergic locus coeruleus, that could play a state-dependent modulatory role (<a href=\"#bib27\">Karlsson et al., 2005</a>). Regardless of which mechanism turns out to be correct, the fact remains that wake movements and twitches are processed very differently at the level of the ECN."

In the context of a developing system that relies heavily on activity-dependent processes (<a href=\"#bib29\">Kirkby et al., 2013</a>), the gating of twitch-related reafference would suppress the very activity upon which some of these processes depend. Because reafference is not gated during twitching, it is permitted to sequentially activate interconnected sensorimotor structures\u2014including the ECN (as shown here), red nucleus (<a href=\"#bib17\">Del Rio-Bermudez et al., 2015</a>), cerebellum (<a href=\"#bib39\">Sokoloff et al., 2015a</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">2015b</a>), thalamus (<a href=\"#bib45\">Tiriac et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Khazipov et al., 2004</a>), sensorimotor cortex (<a href=\"#bib44\">Tiriac et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Khazipov et al., 2004</a>), and hippocampus (<a href=\"#bib32\">Mohns and Blumberg, 2010</a>).

Spindle bursts were defined as comprising at least three oscillations, a dominant frequency of 10\u201315\u2009Hz, and a duration of at least 100 ms (<a href=\"#bib28\">Khazipov et al., 2004</a>).

Five random high-amplitude spindle bursts were averaged and the baseline value of the RMS channel was calculated. The midpoint between those two values was used as a threshold for identification of spindle bursts. A second pass through the data was performed to manually remove any spindle bursts that did not match the requisite criteria. Throughout this process, artifacts in the LFP and MUA signals were identified and manually removed."

Five random wake movements that met these criteria were selected and their maximum amplitude was averaged.

Here, Tiriac and Blumberg examine forelimb movements in the rat and show that the external cuneate nucleus in the brainstem acts as a comparator of intended movement, as defined by a reference signal or so called \"corollary discharge' of motor control, and the measured output from cutaneous or proprioceptive receptors or the so called \"reafferent signal\". In fact, if the two signals are congruent, the nucleus gates sensory input generated by the motion. Interestingly, the gate is inactive during sleep so that sensory signals from self-generated muscle twitches can activate cortical neurons."

They investigated whether the external cuneate nucleus (ECN) acts a comparator of corollary discharge and reafferent signals in relation to wake-state forelimb movements and REM sleep-state forelimb twitches. The authors addressed this question during spontaneous waking and sleeping epochs with LFP and MU recordings in sensorimotor cortex and the ECN, with EMG recordings in forelimb, hindlimb, and nuchal muscles, and with pharmacological manipulations of the ECN. They provide compelling evidence substantiating their claims. First, they convincingly show that sensorimotor cortex responds to sleep-twitches but not to wake-movements. Second, they likewise demonstrate that the ECN has a stronger response to sleep-twitches than to wake-movements. Finally and critically, by disinhibiting ECN, the authors uncover a reafference signal in ECN in response to wake-movements without having an effect on sleep-twitches. These results represent strong evidence that the ECN meets the criteria of a comparator of corollary discharge and reafferent signals."

The experimental design and procedures are suitable for the questions investigated, the results (and figures) are clear, and the discussion of potential mechanisms and the implications of reafferent signals during twitches in relation to development are plausible and interesting. My only recommendations are positive ones. My main suggestion is to expand upon the Discussion (last paragraph) of the potential role of twitches in organizing networks during sleep. A minor suggestion is to include the supplemental figure into the main text."
