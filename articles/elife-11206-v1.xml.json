The sAHP amplitude increases with aging and may underlie age related memory decline. The sAHP is due to a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent, voltage-independent K<sup>+</sup> conductance, the molecular identity of which has remained elusive until a recent report suggested the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> channel, IK1 (KCNN4) as the sAHP channel in CA1 pyramidal neurons. The signature pharmacology of IK1, blockade by TRAM-34, was reported for the sAHP and underlying current. We have examined the sAHP and find no evidence that TRAM-34 affects either the current underling the sAHP or excitability of CA1 or basolateral amygdala pyramidal neurons. In addition, CA1 pyramidal neurons from IK1 null mice exhibit a characteristic sAHP current. Our results indicate that IK1 channels do not mediate the sAHP in pyramidal neurons."

The sAHP amplitude increases with aging and may underlie age related memory decline. The sAHP is due to a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent, voltage-independent K<sup>+</sup> conductance, the molecular identity of which has remained elusive until a recent report suggested the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> channel, IK1 (KCNN4) as the sAHP channel in CA1 pyramidal neurons. The signature pharmacology of IK1, blockade by TRAM-34, was reported for the sAHP and underlying current. We have examined the sAHP and find no evidence that TRAM-34 affects either the current underling the sAHP or excitability of CA1 or basolateral amygdala pyramidal neurons. In addition, CA1 pyramidal neurons from IK1 null mice exhibit a characteristic sAHP current. Our results indicate that IK1 channels do not mediate the sAHP in pyramidal neurons."

These nerve impulses result from ions flowing through proteins called ion channels in the neuron\u2019s membrane, and they determine how the neuron communicates with neighboring neurons. The number of action potentials a neuron can produce can vary over a wide range. In the brain, a particular kind of ion channel limits the number of action potentials that many neurons produce via a negative feedback mechanism. That is to say, nerve impulses activate this ion channel and the activated channel then makes the neuron less able to send further nerve impulses for a while.The activity of this ion channel increases with age and it may be responsible for some forms of age-related decline in cognitive abilities. However, the exact identity of the ion channel responsible was unclear."

                        "text": "In 1980, Hotson and Prince described a long lasting hyperpolarization (AHP) that followed current-induced repetitive firing of action potentials in CA1 pyramidal neurons (<a href=\"#bib15\">Hotson and Prince, 1980</a>). Since this initial finding the role of the slow afterhyperpolarization (sAHP) has been elucidated particularly in the hippocampus where its activity profoundly impacts learning. Thus, for example, the sAHP increases with aging and ovarian hormone deficiency (<a href=\"#bib44\">Wu et al., 2011</a>) and this may underlie cognitive deficits in older or hormone deficient individuals. In 1982, Madison and Nicoll demonstrated that this sAHP was blocked by application of noradrenaline, via protein kinase A (PKA), since the effect is prevented by PKA antagonists and mimicked by application of cyclic AMP or the PKA catalytic subunit (<a href=\"#bib24\">Madison and Nicoll, 1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Pedarzani and Storm, 1993</a>). Blocking the sAHP eliminated spike-frequency adaptation and resulted in dramatically enhanced repetitive firing (<a href=\"#bib24\">Madison and Nicoll, 1982</a>). This same effect can be observed following application of other neurotransmitter receptors, such as histamine (<a href=\"#bib13\">Haas and Konnerth, 1983</a>), dopamine (<a href=\"#bib4\">Benardo and Prince, 1982a</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Pedarzani and Storm, 1995</a>), cholinergic agonists (<a href=\"#bib5\">Benardo and Prince, 1982b</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Benardo and Prince, 1982c</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Cole and Nicoll, 1984</a>), and various peptides (<a href=\"#bib14\">Haug and Storm, 2000</a>). In 1984, these same authors reported that loading cells with the Ca<sup>2+</sup> chelator, EGTA, or extracellular application of the voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel blocker, Cd<sup>2+</sup>, blocked the sAHP (<a href=\"#bib25\">Madison and Nicoll, 1984</a>). In 1986, Lancaster and Adams used a hybrid clamp technique to record the sAHP in current clamp and the underlying current in voltage clamp. This showed a characteristic slowly activating current, the IsAHP, with a reversal potential that shifted with the concentration of extracellular K<sup>+</sup> in a manner consistent with a K<sup>+</sup> current (<a href=\"#bib21\">Lancaster and Adams, 1986</a>). In 2002, Power et al. showed that activation of the IsAHP was voltage independent (<a href=\"#bib33\">Power et al., 2002</a>). Taken together, these and other reports strongly support the proposal that the sAHP was due to the activity of a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent, voltage-independent K<sup>+</sup> channel. Given the importance of the sAHP the identity of the underlying channel(s) and associated molecular components are of great interest. In 1996, Kohler et al. reported the cloning and expression of three Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated, voltage independent K<sup>+</sup> channels, the SK (small conductance) channels (SK1-3; KCNN1-3) (<a href=\"#bib20\">Kohler et al., 1996</a>) and in 1997 the fourth member of this family, SK4 (IK1; KCNN4; intermediate conductance) was reported (<a href=\"#bib16\">Ishii et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Joiner et al., 1997</a>). The pharmacological fingerprints of these channels are distinct. Apamin, an 18 amino acid peptide isolated from honeybee venom selectively blocks SK2 and SK3 channels, while SK1 is less apamin sensitive and IK1 is not apamin sensitive (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adelman et al., 2012</a>). Importantly, the sAHP is not blocked by apamin. IK1 (SK4) is blocked by charybdotoxin (ChTX) a 37 amino acid peptide isolated from scorpion venom that also blocks BK channels (<a href=\"#bib16\">Ishii et al., 1997</a>). The antimycotic agent, clotrimazole also blocks IK1 (<a href=\"#bib16\">Ishii et al., 1997</a>), but this is also a P450 inhibitor. However, the related triarlymethane, TRAM-34, potently and specifically blocks IK1 channels (<a href=\"#bib45\">Wulff et al., 2000</a>). Sensitivity to TRAM-34 has therefore been taken as the signature of IK1 channels."

                        "text": "The biophysical and pharmacological properties of the SK/IK channels fulfill many of the expected characteristics of the channels underlying the sAHP in CA1 and basolateral amygdala (BLA) pyramidal neurons: Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated, voltage-independent, K<sup>+</sup> selective. <i>In situ</i> hybridization and immunohistochemistry suggest that SK1-3 are widely expressed in overlapping yet distinct patterns in the brain, including hippocampus and amygdala (<a href=\"#bib38\">Stocker and Pedarzani, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Sailer et al., 2002</a>). IK1 mRNA expression was detected in some limited brain areas but hippocampus and amygdala were ambiguous (<a href=\"http://mouse.brain-map.org/experiment/show/130911\">http://mouse.brain-map.org/experiment/show/130911</a>; <a href=\"http://mouse.brain-map.org/experiment/show/119686\">http://mouse.brain-map.org/experiment/show/119686</a>). Knock out mice for each of the three SK channels revealed that the apamin-insensitive IsAHP was not affected in any of the SK null mice, eliminating them as candidates for the sAHP channel (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bond, 2004</a>). However, a recent report used an IK1 reporter mouse to show that the IK1 promoter was active in several brain regions including hippocampus (<a href=\"#bib40\">Turner et al., 2015</a>). Turner and colleagues further reported that the sAHP and the IsAHP in CA1 pyramidal neurons were greatly reduced by application of TRAM-34, and the sAHP was absent in CA1 pyramidal neurons from IK1 null mice, strongly suggesting that IK1 channels underlie the sAHP (<a href=\"#bib18\">King et al., 2015</a>). In line with this, a recent paper reported that IK1 channels were suppressed by direct phosphorylation by PKA (<a href=\"#bib43\">Wong and Schlichter, 2014</a>). Given the disparity on the role of IK1 channels, we have examined the sensitivity of the sAHP in pyramidal neurons from area CA1 of the hippocampus and the BLA to TRAM-34 and found that this compound did not significantly affect the current underlying the sAHP measured in voltage clamp. TRAM-34 also had no effect on the sAHP amplitude or intrinsic excitability measured in current clamp. Moreover, IK1 null mice express a characteristic IsAHP. Together our results indicate that IK1 channels do not mediate the sAHP in pyramidal neurons."

                                "text": "As previously described (<a href=\"#bib31\">Pedarzani and Storm, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Madison et al., 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Gerlach et al., 2004</a>), a robust IsAHP was recorded in whole-cell voltage clamp configuration (22\u201324\u02daC) from CA1 pyramidal neurons in freshly prepared hippocampal slices from 6\u20138 week old rats. From a holding potential of -63 mV, a 200 ms voltage command to +7 mV was delivered to promote Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. Repolarization to -63 mV elicited a characteristic slowly decaying outward tail current, the IsAHP that decayed over several seconds with a time constant of 2.9 \u00b1 0.2 s (n = 20). Apamin was included in the bath solution to eliminate the SK channel contribution that overlaps with the initial decay phase of the IsAHP (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bond, 2004</a>). The IsAHP was measured as the current at 1 sec after the voltage step. The tail current protocol was repeated every 30 sec for 25 min, and showed modest rundown of the IsAHP in control cells, being reduced to 0.74 \u00b1 0.17 of the initial current amplitude (n = 12, P &lt; 0.001). In some experiments carbachol (CCh; 1 \u03bcM), a muscarinic agonist that potently blocks the IsAHP, was applied after 25 min (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B-D</a>). To test the effects of TRAM-34, control tail currents were first obtained for 5 min in the absence of drug. The average amplitude of the IsAHP in this baseline control period was 209.3 \u00b1 27.9 pA (n = 11), not different for control cells (195.0 \u00b1 28.3 pA, n = 12)\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a>). TRAM-34 (1 \u03bcM) was added to the bath solution and the tail current protocol was continued. After 25 min in TRAM-34, the IsAHP relative to control baseline was 0.79 \u00b1 0.18 (n = 11), not different than rundown in control cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). As in control, subsequent addition of CCh abolished the IsAHP (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). While TRAM-34 rapidly blocks native and cloned IK1 channels when applied in the bath solution, the binding site for TRAM-34 is internal (<a href=\"#bib46\">Wulff, 2001</a>). Therefore, TRAM-34 was also applied through the patch pipette (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,D-F</a>). With intracellular dialysis of TRAM-34, the relative amplitude of the IsAHP measured 25 min after dialysis was not different from external TRAM-34 application (0.92 \u00b1 0.13 of the initial current, n = 4); CCh treatment eliminated the IsAHP. The sensitivity of the IsAHP to 5 \u03bcM TRAM-34 was also tested and this increased concentration of TRAM-34 was without effect (0.83 \u00b1 0.07, n = 9). ChTX (100 nM) was also tested and as for TRAM-34, ChTX did not affect the IsAHP (relative IsAHP 0.83 \u00b1 0.11, n = 10). To be certain that the drugs, TRAM-34 and ChTX, were active each was bath-applied to HEK293 cells transiently expressing cloned IK1 channels. TRAM-34 (1 \u03bcM) produced a rapid block within 30 sec of the IK1 current (relative current after TRAM-34 compared to baseline = 0.07 \u00b1 0.03, n = 3) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). Similarly, ChTX (100 nM) blocked cloned IK1 currents (relative current after ChTX = 0.05 \u00b1 0.01, n = 8; not shown). These data show that ChTX or TRAM-34 does not block the IsAHP but they do block IK1 channels."

A brief spike train was evoked by depolarizing current injection (200 pA for 100 ms), and was followed by characteristic medium (m) and slow (s) AHPs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). The peak AHP amplitudes recorded in normal aCSF were 4.36 \u00b1 0.39 mV for the mAHP, and 2.79 \u00b1 0.41 mV for the sAHP (n = 6). The cells treated with TRAM-34 for 30 min (n = 7) showed similar AHP amplitudes: 4.46 \u00b1 0.33 mV for the mAHP and 3.17 \u00b1 0.27 mV for the sAHP (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). In a different set of neurons (n = 5) TRAM-34 application for at least 25 min did not affect the sAHP (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>), but the sAHP was rapidly blocked by subsequent bath application of noradrenaline (10 \u03bcM) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,D,E</a>).

Similar results were obtained either using acute hippocampal slices or hippocampal slice cultures, so the data were pooled together (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). Finally, intrinsic excitability was examined in CA1 pyramidal cells in acute hippocampal slices. Spike trains were evoked by a series of depolarizing current pulses (0-400 pA; 1s) in control or TRAM-34 containing bath solution (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>).

BLA pyramidal neurons were first recorded in whole-cell voltage clamp (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>). From a holding potential of \u221250 mV a depolarizing command to 10 mV was given for 100 ms.

                        "text": "The sAHP conductance in CA1 pyramidal neurons is a powerful modulator of intrinsic excitability and many neurotransmitters activate second messenger pathways that converge on the sAHP, suppressing the sAHP and increasing intrinsic excitability (<a href=\"#bib14\">Haug and Storm, 2000</a>). Modulation of the sAHP has been implicated in behavioral learning: animals with a smaller sAHP in CA1 pyramidal neurons learn hippocampus-dependent tasks better than those with a larger sAHP (<a href=\"#bib28\">Moyer et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Tombaugh, 2005</a>), and a reduction of the sAHP is observed after successful learning (<a href=\"#bib27\">Moyer et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Oh, 2003</a>). The sAHP increases with age (<a href=\"#bib22\">Landfield and Pitler, 1984</a>), and this may underlie cognitive deficits in older animals (<a href=\"#bib9\">Deyo et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Knuttinen et al., 2001</a>). Thus, understanding the molecular basis of the sAHP is important and may lead to novel therapeutic approaches to manage cognitive decline. Compelling evidence suggests that the sAHP reflects the activity of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent, voltage-independent K<sup>+</sup>-selective channels. Members of the SK (KCNN) channel family share many features that are similar to those that mediate the sAHP. Thus, all four members (KCNN1-4; SK1-3, IK1) are voltage independent and are Ca<sup>2+</sup>-gated via constitutively bound calmodulin (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adelman et al., 2012</a>). The fourth member of the family, IK1, has a larger unitary conductance than the other family members (~40 pS vs ~10 pS in symmetrical K<sup>+</sup>) (<a href=\"#bib20\">Kohler et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Ishii et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Joiner et al., 1997</a>) and, importantly, the SK and IK channels are pharmacologically distinct. The peptide toxin, apamin potently and selectively blocks SK2 and SK3 channels (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adelman et al., 2012</a>), while IK1 channels are apamin-insensitive but are selectively blocked by TRAM-34 (<a href=\"#bib45\">Wulff et al., 2000</a>). IK1 is additionally blocked by the scorpion peptide charybdotoxin (ChTX) (<a href=\"#bib16\">Ishii et al., 1997</a>) that also blocks BK channels. I<i>n situ</i> hybridization and immunohistochemistry data indicate that SK1-3 are expressed in overlapping but distinct patterns in the CNS. In hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons and BLA pyramidal neurons, SK2 is heavily expressed while SK1 and SK3 are expressed at lower levels (<a href=\"#bib38\">Stocker and Pedarzani, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Sailer et al., 2002</a>). IK1 mRNA is expressed in peripheral tissues such as smooth muscle endothelium, gastrointestinal tract, lung, and salivary glands, but brain expression is limited (<a href=\"#bib3\">Begenisich et al., 2004</a>)."

In contrast, a recent study using both immunohistochemistry and a GFP reporter mouse suggested that IK1 expression was significant in both cortex and hippocampus, including CA1 pyramidal neurons (<a href=\"#bib40\">Turner et al., 2015</a>). Using a monoclonal antibody to IK1, immunohistochemistry detected IK1 throughout the hippocampal formation (<a href=\"#bib40\">Turner et al., 2015</a>). However this antibody also recognized a band on Western blots using tissue derived from either of two independently generated IK1 knockout mice (<a href=\"#bib40\">Turner et al., 2015</a>). Therefore, the specificity of the monoclonal antibody is questionable. For both of these transgenic IK1 gene disruption mouse lines previous work reported the loss IK1 mRNA expression (<a href=\"#bib37\">Si, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Begenisich et al., 2004</a>), and for one line, the line employed here, the loss of IK1 protein expression as well (<a href=\"#bib37\">Si, 2006</a>). Indeed, <a href=\"#bib37\">Si et al. (2006)</a> used a different IK1 antibody that detected robust expression in Western blots with red blood cells prepared from wild type but did not detect a band in protein samples from the null mice, engendering confidence in this IK1 null mouse. We used these IK1 null mice to record the characteristic IsAHP in CA1 pyramidal neurons. Additionally, <a href=\"#bib40\">Turner et al. (2015)</a> generated an IK1 promoter GFP-reporter mouse. In this mouse GFP was detected throughout the hippocampus. Assuming that the BAC employed contained all of the requisite regulatory sequences to direct normal IK1 expression, these results suggest that the IK1 promoter is active in hippocampus, but stands in contrast to transcriptome results (<a href=\"#bib47\">Zeisel et al., 2015</a>). In red blood cells, IK1 has been shown to be the \u2018Gardos' channel, responsible for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent K<sup>+</sup> efflux. The channel protein is presumably very stable as erythrocytes live for ~120 days after enucleation. Thus it is possible that a very brief \u2018pulse\u2019 of IK1 mRNA could give rise to channels that are stable long after the mRNA has been degraded."

In primary afferent neurons of the gastrointestinal tract there is a late AHP that follows the action potential that bears many similarities to the sAHP in CA1 pyramidal neurons. IK1 is prominently expressed in these myenteric neurons and the late AHP is blocked by TRAM-34 (<a href=\"#bib29\">Nguyen et al., 2007</a>). Thus, it is likely that IK1 channel activity is responsible for this late AHP. A recent report showed that the sAHP in CA1 pyramidal neurons was at least partially blocked by the signature agent, TRAM-34, and that the sAHP was absent in IK1 null mice. The authors concluded that IK1 channel activity is also responsible for the sAHP in CA1 pyramidal neurons (<a href=\"#bib18\">King et al., 2015</a>). Consistent with this, PKA has been shown to inhibit IK1 channel activity via direct phosphorylation of the channel (<a href=\"#bib43\">Wong and Schlichter, 2014</a>)."

                        "text": "We re-examined the sAHP in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons and found that TRAM-34 or ChTX did not block it, and TRAM-34 had no effect on intrinsic excitability. Similar results were obtained from pyramidal neurons of the BLA. We noted that the average amplitude of the IsAHP in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> is higher than previously recorded in CA1 pyramidal cells (<a href=\"#bib12\">Gu et al., 2005</a>). There are two aspects to this. First, the IsAHP increases with age, and for the IsAHP in CA1 pyramidal neurons we used older (8 weeks) rats. Second, the amplitude of the IsAHP is sensitive to changes in temperature (<a href=\"#bib21\">Lancaster and Adams, 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Sah and Isaacson, 1995</a>) that may explain the larger IsAHP amplitude in our present study (recorded at 22\u201323\u00b0). However, this is unlikely to affect our overall interpretation, since IsAHP may be increased at lower temperatures and therefore any IK1 component might be even bigger. Importantly, IK1 null mice showed a prominent IsAHP. Moreover, IK1 channels have been reported to have a single channel conductance of ~12 pS (<a href=\"#bib17\">Joiner et al., 1997</a>), however, while not directly recorded, channels underlying the IsAHP have been proposed to have a much lower single channel conductance of 2\u2013 5 pS (<a href=\"#bib35\">Sah and Isaacson, 1995</a>). Our data show no effect of TRAM-34 in contrast to <a href=\"#bib18\">King et al. (2015)</a> This discrepancy may be related to a combination of several factors: 1) run-down of IsAHP during whole-cell recordings has been observed in several previous studies and cannot be excluded in absence of time course plots. 2) The Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and IsAHP may differ during synaptic stimulation (<a href=\"#bib18\">King et al., 2015</a>) or somatic current pulses by recruitment of different Ca<sup>2+</sup> sources. This may affect activation of IK1 depending on its specific subcellular localization. Regardless, data from three different laboratories using different conditions failed to find an effect of TRAM-34. Therefore, we conclude that the channel(s) underlying the sAHP is not IK1 and has not yet been identified. Several possibilities remain. For example, the sAHP might not be due to the activity of one particular type of K channel, but rather an ensemble of channels (<a href=\"#bib2\">Andrade et al., 2012</a>). It has also been proposed that the sAHP is mediated at least in part by Kv7/KCNQ (M) channels with Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity endowed by the calcium binding protein, hippocalcin (<a href=\"#bib42\">Tzingounis et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Tzingounis et al., 2007</a>), although the Kv7/KCNQ (M) channel blocker XE991 fails to block the sAHP of CA1 pyramidal cells (<a href=\"#bib12\">Gu et al., 2005</a>) (see <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Alternatively, the K<sup>+</sup> channel superfamily contains several subunits that do not express functional channels on their own. In either case, the pore-forming subunits may be co-assembled into larger signaling complexes that endow Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity and characteristic slow activation kinetics. Recapitulating the sAHP using cloned components, together with gene targeting and pharmacology will eventually reveal the molecular details of the sAHP."

(2015). In addition, the authors examined AHP currents in an IK1 KO animal and examined IsAHP and the sAHP in pyramidal cells from the basolateral amygdala. The principal findings are in direct opposition to those of King et al. (2015). The current study found that the IK1 KO had normal IsAHP currents and that the reported IK1-selective blocker TRAM-34 had no effect on the sAHP or IsAHP in either CA1 (acute or organotypic slices) or basolateral amygdalar pyramidal neurons (despite clear effects of TRAM-34 on IKI currents in HEK293 cells)."

                    "text": "There are several aspects to this, and we assume the reviewer refers to Gu et al., 2005 (no voltage clamp data in Gu et al., 2008). First, the IsAHP increases with age and for our experiments on the IsAHP in CA1 pyramidal neurons we used older rats (8 weeks). A second point is temperature. The IsAHP tends to be larger at lower temperatures, and in Gu et al., 2005 the IsAHP was recorded at 30 \u00b0C and here, it was recorded at 22-23 \u00b0C. Pedarzani et al., 1998 recorded at room temperature as well (21-24 \u00b0C) but the internal solution was K-gluconate, which explains the smaller current amplitude (see also Kaczorowski, Disterhoft and Spruston, 2007). On one hand, the referee has a point, since King et al., 2015 recorded at 32-34 \u00baC and in our manuscript the IsAHP experiments in CA1 were done at 22-23 \u00baC while the rest of experiments were done at 34 \u00baC. On the other hand, this is unlikely to affect the overall interpretation, since Ca<sup>2</sup> -dependent K currents may be increased at lower temperatures (and therefore any IK1 component might be even bigger). Therefore, we believe the fact that we showed no effect, even at different temperatures actually strengthens our conclusions. We have added this to the Discussion."
