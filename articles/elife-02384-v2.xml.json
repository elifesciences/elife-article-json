ATP and RecA play essential roles in the activation of pol V for DNA synthesis including translesion synthesis (TLS). We have established three features of the roles of ATP and RecA. (1) RecA-activated DNA polymerase V (pol V Mut), is a DNA-dependent ATPase; (2) bound ATP is required for DNA synthesis; (3) pol V Mut function is regulated by ATP, with ATP required to bind primer/template (p/t) DNA and ATP hydrolysis triggering dissociation from the DNA. Pol V Mut formed with an ATPase-deficient RecA E38K/K72R mutant hydrolyzes ATP rapidly, establishing the DNA-dependent ATPase as an intrinsic property of pol V Mut distinct from the ATP hydrolytic activity of RecA when bound to single-stranded (ss)DNA as a nucleoprotein filament (RecA*). No similar ATPase activity or autoregulatory mechanism has previously been found for a DNA polymerase."

ATP and RecA play essential roles in the activation of pol V for DNA synthesis including translesion synthesis (TLS). We have established three features of the roles of ATP and RecA. (1) RecA-activated DNA polymerase V (pol V Mut), is a DNA-dependent ATPase; (2) bound ATP is required for DNA synthesis; (3) pol V Mut function is regulated by ATP, with ATP required to bind primer/template (p/t) DNA and ATP hydrolysis triggering dissociation from the DNA. Pol V Mut formed with an ATPase-deficient RecA E38K/K72R mutant hydrolyzes ATP rapidly, establishing the DNA-dependent ATPase as an intrinsic property of pol V Mut distinct from the ATP hydrolytic activity of RecA when bound to single-stranded (ss)DNA as a nucleoprotein filament (RecA*). No similar ATPase activity or autoregulatory mechanism has previously been found for a DNA polymerase."

After the activated polymerase has attached to the DNA, it will break down the molecule of ATP to free itself from the DNA. Furthermore, although the RecA protein can also break down ATP, Erdem, Jaszczur et al. found that a mutant RecA without this ability could still activate DNA polymerase V to break down this molecule itself."

The same ATP effect was observed for pol V Mut WT synthesis on DNA containing an abasic site (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). dATP activation does not result in appreciable DNA extension (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). For pol V Mut E38K/K72R, synthesis is observed with either ATP\u03b3S, ATP or dATP (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Pol V Mut E38K/\u0394C17 can also use ATP, ATP\u03b3S or dATP as a required nucleotide cofactor (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Notably, the requirement for ATP\u03b3S/ATP was completely masked in earlier studies of transactivation of pol V by RecA* filaments that remain in the solution with pol V Mut, because the ATP\u03b3S or ATP needed to form RecA* is always present in the transactivation reaction (<a href=\"#bib23\">Schlacher et al., 2006</a>)."

This is unprecedented for a DNA polymerase. A very sensitive ATPase assay, based on the fluorescence of a P<sub>i</sub> binding protein, is used in this work. The assay permits observation of the first 5 \u03bcM of ATP hydrolyzed, which is limited by the concentration of the fluorescent P<sub>i</sub> binding protein found in solution. A 30 nt ssDNA oligomer (1 \u03bcM) is present in all reactions. In <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, results are shown with pol V Mut made with WT RecA protein (pol V Mut WT). WT RecA protein alone exhibits limited stability on short oligonucleotides when present at sub-micromolar concentrations. Limited ATP hydrolysis by RecA WT alone is seen in this assay; the initial filaments produce a burst of ATP hydrolysis and then level off to a much slower rate, presumably reflecting filament binding, dissociation, and slow reassembly. Both phases of the reaction exhibit a dependence on RecA WT protein concentration (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). In contrast, after detectable free RecA protein and RecA* have been removed, equivalent concentrations of pol V Mut WT exhibit higher levels of ATP hydrolysis than do similar amounts of RecA alone (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>).

But that's in fact not the case. To address whether the pol V Mut -associated ATPase activity can be distinguished from the intrinsic DNA-dependent ATPase activity of RecA, we assembled pol V Mut with a RecA (E38K/K72R) mutant deficient in ATPase activity (<a href=\"#bib15\">Gruenig et al., 2008</a>). Using the same highly sensitive fluorescence-based assay as described for panel 2A, we were unable to detect DNA-dependent ATPase activity for RecA E38K/K72R above background (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). However, in contrast, pol V Mut E38K/K72R exhibits substantial ATPase activity. The observed ATPase scales with the concentration of pol V Mut E38K/K72R (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), as is also the case for pol V Mut WT (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Therefore, pol V Mut is a DNA-dependent ATPase (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). As RecA E38K/K72R protein hydrolyzes little or no ATP on its own (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), the pol V Mut activity cannot be attributed to a low level of contamination by RecA protein. A small amount of ATP hydrolysis above background can be observed with RecA E38K/K72R by increasing its concentration to 2.5 \u03bcM (84 nM Pi release/min, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>)."

Binding is absolutely dependent on a nucleotide cofactor. Pol V Mut WT binding to p/t DNA with a 3 nt template overhang (3 nt oh) increases roughly linearly up to about 180 \u03bcM ATP\u03b3S, saturating at about 220 \u03bcM (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). However, binding is not detectable in the presence of ATP. Increasing the length of the template overhang to 12 nt has essentially no effect on binding as a function of nucleotide concentration (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). However, with ATP\u03b3S pol V Mut binds with higher affinity to the p/t DNA 12 nt oh (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). DNA synthesis corresponds closely to ATP\u03b3S-dependent pol V Mut WT binding, showing a linear increase in primer extension up to about 180 \u03bcM ATP\u03b3S, reaching about 70% total primer usage at about 500 \u03bcM ATP\u03b3S (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>).

Since binding is a precursor to synthesis, the same nucleotide requirement holds for pol V Mut-catalyzed primer extension (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1B</a>, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). The link that's missing is the role of ATP hydrolysis in the DNA binding/synthesis process. Indirect evidence hinting at just such a link is the observation that pol V Mut WT hydrolyzes ATP about 9-fold more rapidly on ssDNA than pol V Mut E38K/K72R and about 2-fold more rapidly than pol V Mut E38K/\u0394C17 (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>), suggesting perhaps that the more rapid ATP hydrolysis by pol V Mut WT diminishes its ability to remain bound to DNA long enough to catalyze synthesis under these in vitro conditions. Pol V Mut WT-dependent primer extension significantly decreases with a mixture of ATP/ATP\u03b3S (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), further suggesting that the fraction of enzyme that binds and hydrolyzes ATP is not associated with DNA long enough to catalyze appreciable primer elongation. With p/t DNA, ATP hydrolysis is slower for pol V Mut E38K/K72R compared to pol V Mut WT (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>), which could account for incorporation with added ATP. In the case of pol V Mut E38K/\u0394C17, although ATP hydrolysis is more rapid on p/t DNA compared to pol V Mut WT (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>), binding is much tighter (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>), which could plausibly explain primer extension observed with added ATP."

                                "text": "To obtain direct evidence for a possible role of ATP hydrolysis in the pol V Mut reaction pathway, we used pol V Mut formed with RecA E38K/\u0394C17, which binds p/t DNA with higher affinity than either pol V Mut WT or pol V Mut E38K/K72R (measured K<sub>d</sub> for pol V Mut E38K/\u0394C17 = 469 nM, compared to 876 nM for pol V Mut WT; <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). There is a concomitant \u223c5 to 10-fold greater DNA-dependent ATPase activity for pol V Mut E38K/\u0394C17 compared with pol V Mut WT (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). The pol V Mut E38K/\u0394C17-p/t DNA complex formed in the presence of ATP was stable for a long enough time to conveniently monitor its dissociation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Fluorescent-labeled p/t DNA (12 nt oh, 50 nM) has a rotational anisotropy (RA) of 0.05 when diffusing freely in solution (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). When incubated in the presence of eightfold excess pol V Mut E38K/\u0394C17 (400 nM), essentially all of the DNA is bound in a complex with pol V Mut (RA = 0.12). Immediately following complex formation (t \u223c 0), 160-fold excess unlabeled p/t DNA (8 \u03bcM) was added to trap pol V Mut as it dissociates. Pol V Mut E38K/\u0394C17 forms a stable complex with p/t DNA in the presence of ATP\u03b3S, remaining bound for at least 4 min without dissociating. In contrast, when the complex is formed with ATP, pol V Mut E38K/\u0394C17 dissociates exponentially as a function of time, asymptotically reaching \u223c100% free DNA at about 75 s (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). The off-rate determined as the first-order rate constant is 0.053 s<sup>\u22121</sup>. The magnitude of the off-rate is in remarkably close agreement with the DNA-dependent ATPase single-turnover rate constant for pol V Mut E38K/\u0394C17 = 0.054 s<sup>\u22121</sup> (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). The data strongly suggest that ATP hydrolysis is responsible for pol V Mut-p/t DNA dissociation. This can also be seen during DNA synthesis, where longer segments of DNA are synthesized with ATP\u03b3S than with a similar concentration of ATP (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The correspondence of dissociation rate to ATP hydrolysis rate further suggests that perhaps a single ATP turnover is sufficient to trigger dissociation of pol V Mut from a 3\u2032-OH primer end. The absence of dissociation in the presence of the weakly hydrolyzed ATP\u03b3S strongly reinforces this conclusion. Pol V Mut WT and pol V Mut E38K/K72R, act similarly to pol V Mut E38K/\u0394C17, remaining stably bound to p/t DNA in the presence of ATP\u03b3S (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Although ATP hydrolysis affects pol V Mut\u2013DNA complex stability, the integrity of the pol V Mut protein complex is not affected by hydrolysis, with RecA remaining bound to UmuD\u2032<sub>2</sub>C (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3A,B</a>)."

To determine if pol V Mut WT can synthesize DNA in the presence of ATP (as must presumably happen in vivo) we have used the \u03b2 sliding clamp to enhance pol V Mut binding to the 3\u2032-primer end. Pol V Mut WT binds to \u03b2 clamp and is able to synthesize DNA with moderately high processivity (<a href=\"#bib17\">Karata et al., 2012</a>).

The ATP hydrolytic sites in RecA protein filament are situated at the interfaces of adjacent RecA subunits, and each neighboring subunit contributes key residues to the active site. There are no readily identifiable ATP-binding motifs present in either the UmuD\u2032 or UmuC subunits of pol V. The avid ATPase activity observed with the ATPase-deficient RecA E38K/K72R indicates that the RecA subunit is not contributing a Walker A motif (or P-loop) to the aggregate site. We speculate that the ATPase active site in pol V Mut is newly created when RecA is added to the complex during activation, perhaps at the interface between the RecA subunit and UmuC or UmuD\u2032. This interface appears to play a central role in polymerase activation because the RecA(S117F) mutant (initially referred to as RecA1730), was shown to be SOS-non mutable in vivo (<a href=\"#bib8\">Dutreix et al., 1989</a>). The S117 residue is situated at the 3\u2032-proximal tip of RecA* (<a href=\"#bib26\">Sommer et al., 1998</a>), and, notably, pol V Mut S117F has no measurable DNA synthesis activity in vitro (<a href=\"#bib24\">Schlacher et al., 2005</a>)."

When the regulation of pol V fails, as it does for the constitutive RecA E38K mutant, pol V Mut is induced in the absence of DNA damage generating \u223c100-fold increase in mutations (<a href=\"#bib30\">Witkin, 1967</a>). This huge increase in mutations likely occurs by copying undamaged DNA with exceptionally poor fidelity (<a href=\"#bib28\">Tang et al., 2000</a>). The regulation of pol V is needed to limit mutations, especially in stationary phase cells (<a href=\"#bib6\">Corzett et al., 2013</a>). Our biochemical data suggest that in vivo ATP adds another level to this regulation; not only is the timing of pol V activity regulated, but also its access to p/t DNA. A model for the role of ATP in pol V Mut activity is sketched in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>. ATP is required to bind pol V Mut to DNA. ATP hydrolysis releases the enzyme from DNA, which in vivo would ensure that tracts of DNA synthesized by pol V Mut are short, limiting the opportunity for misincorporation to the region immediately adjacent to the template lesion. Therefore, the internally regulated DNA-dependent ATPase of pol V Mut provides a way to limit mutational load."

In a 70-\u03bcl reaction, etheno-ATP was mixed in standard reaction buffer with pol V Mut, pol V or RecA. The concentration of protein used for measurements was 400 nM. Rotational anisotropy was measured using a QuantaMaster (QM-1) fluorometer. Samples were excited with vertically polarized light at 410 nm and both vertical and horizontal emissions were monitored at 425 nm."

The data clearly show that the SOS activated DNA Pol V, containing a single RecA molecule as part of the holoenzyme, requires ATP binding for association with a primer/template substrate and that hydrolysis leads to dissociation. The results are clearly presented and the data do provide very strong support for the idea that ATP hydrolysis serves as a switch to prevent the mutation prone polymerase from staying on the chromosome for too long and creating too many unwarranted mutations. It leaves the readers with the thought that during evolution, the Pol V co-opted the RecA, piggy-backing on it to use the RecA ATPase properties for its (Pol V) own design. Thus, RecA binds ATP in order to bind DNA, and hydrolyzes ATP to eject from DNA \u2013 and Pol V does the same. It is really quite brilliant and makes an excellent story about evolution of an enzyme that adapts to obtain extended mechanical features over those of simpler polymerases. The story should be published in <i>eLife</i>. A couple of points should be addressed in a simple revision."

A mutant unable to bind ATP will not form a RecA* filament, and the assembly of an active pol V Mut requires pol V to interact with the 3\u2032-tip of the RecA* nucleoprotein filament, which is required to transfer a RecA monomer to UmuD\u2032<sub>2</sub>C (Jiang et al. 2009. The active form of DNA polymerase V is UmuD\u2032<sub>2</sub>C-RecA-ATP. Nature, 460:359-63). We note that RecA cannot hydrolyze ATP as a monomer. In a RecA filament, the RecA active site for ATP hydrolysis is a composite site that is formed at the interface of two RecA subunits, both of which contribute residues essential to active site function. Thus, a RecA filament can hydrolyze ATP, a monomer cannot."

We also suspect that there had been a small amount of adventitious RecA present in the earlier report that could assemble as RecA* on unannealed primer strands and increase synthesis by transactivation of pol V Mut. Our significantly improved method of assembling pol V Mut using ssDNA covalently attached to Sepharose beads (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) eliminates ATP/ATP\u03b3S (and free RecA). The purpose of this experiment (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>) was to determine if activity for pol V Mut WT can be obtained with ATP in the presence of the \u03b2 clamp. The overall activity in the presence of ATP is low as a result of the dynamic behavior of \u03b3 complex using ATP to load and unload \u03b2. Additionally in these experiments the HP p/t DNA has biotin/streptavidin to prevent the loaded \u03b2 clamp from sliding off, which partially inhibits pol V Mut activity. The key point is that pol V Mut WT DNA synthesis occurs with ATP in the presence of \u03b2/\u03b3 complex."
