The configuration and function of the kinetochore\u2013centromere interface is poorly understood. We report that a protein at this interface, CENP-M, is structurally and evolutionarily related to small GTPases but is incapable of GTP-binding and conformational switching. We show that CENP-M is crucially required for the assembly and stability of a tetramer also comprising CENP-I, CENP-H, and CENP-K, the HIKM complex, which we extensively characterize through a combination of structural, biochemical, and cell biological approaches. A point mutant affecting the CENP-M/CENP-I interaction hampers kinetochore assembly and chromosome alignment and prevents kinetochore recruitment of the CENP-T/W complex, questioning a role of CENP-T/W as founder of an independent axis of kinetochore assembly. Our studies identify a single pathway having CENP-C as founder, and CENP-H/I/K/M and CENP-T/W as CENP-C-dependent followers."

The configuration and function of the kinetochore\u2013centromere interface is poorly understood. We report that a protein at this interface, CENP-M, is structurally and evolutionarily related to small GTPases but is incapable of GTP-binding and conformational switching. We show that CENP-M is crucially required for the assembly and stability of a tetramer also comprising CENP-I, CENP-H, and CENP-K, the HIKM complex, which we extensively characterize through a combination of structural, biochemical, and cell biological approaches. A point mutant affecting the CENP-M/CENP-I interaction hampers kinetochore assembly and chromosome alignment and prevents kinetochore recruitment of the CENP-T/W complex, questioning a role of CENP-T/W as founder of an independent axis of kinetochore assembly. Our studies identify a single pathway having CENP-C as founder, and CENP-H/I/K/M and CENP-T/W as CENP-C-dependent followers."

However, while it is structurally and evolutionarily related to enzymes called GTPases, CENP-M is not an enzyme. Instead, the CENP-M protein interacts with three other centromeric proteins to form a complex that becomes part of the inner layer of the kinetochore. Basilico, Maffini, Weir et al. also find that another centromeric protein, CENP-C, appears to start the assembly of the inner layer. This protein then recruits two complexes made of other centromeric proteins to the kinetochore, including the complex that contains CENP-M."

In either case, chromosome segregation is executed by molecular machinery that is largely conserved in the evolution of eukaryotes. Kinetochores are essential elements of such machinery (<a href=\"#bib74\">Santaguida and Musacchio, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib95\">Westermann and Schleiffer, 2013</a>). They are biochemically complex structures, which contain multiple copies of approximately 30 core subunits, in turn contributing to recruit many additional regulatory proteins (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Schematically, kinetochores can be viewed as layered structures, whose inner and outer layers directly contact centromeric chromatin and spindle microtubules, respectively."

Subsequent work led to biochemical reconstitution of at least three CCAN sub-complexes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). First, the 4-subunit CENP-O/P/Q/U complex (also known as COMA complex in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>) has been implicated in microtubule binding and spindle checkpoint control (<a href=\"#bib63\">Perpelescu and Fukagawa, 2011</a>), and is believed to interact with CENP-R, a protein of unknown function (<a href=\"#bib39\">Hori et al., 2008b</a>). Second, the 2-subunit CENP-N/L complex binds directly to the CATD box, a specific segment of CENP-A that has been implicated in the epigenetic specification of centromeres (<a href=\"#bib8\">Carroll et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Black and Cleveland, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Hinshaw and Harrison, 2013</a>). Third, the 4-subunit CENP-T/W/S/X complex contains proteins with histone-fold domains that bind DNA and have been proposed to form a nucleosome-like structure (<a href=\"#bib38\">Hori et al., 2008a</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Nishino et al., 2012</a>). Together with CENP-C (<a href=\"#bib20\">Earnshaw and Rothfield, 1985</a>), the CENP-T/W sub-complex has been shown to contribute to outer kinetochore assembly. CENP-C and CENP-T/W interact directly with the Mis12 and Ndc80 complexes, respectively (<a href=\"#bib26\">Gascoigne et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Przewloka et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Screpanti et al., 2011</a>). CENP-C provides additional important scaffolding functions, as it binds directly to the CENP-A nucleosome and to the CENP-N/L complex (<a href=\"#bib34\">Hinshaw and Harrison, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Kato et al., 2013</a>). Several of these interactions among CCAN subunits have been recognized in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> and in <i>S. pombe</i>, suggesting a conserved plan of kinetochore assembly (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cheeseman et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Measday et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">De Wulf, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Pidoux et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Pot et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib94\">Westermann et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Liu et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib86\">Tanaka et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib95\">Westermann and Schleiffer, 2013</a>)."

To gain insight into CENP-M function, we depleted it by RNA interference (RNAi) in HeLa cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C\u2013E</a>). No change in the levels of several other kinetochore proteins was observed (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). In mitotic HeLa cells, depletion of CENP-M prevented chromosome alignment at the metaphase plate to a comparable degree to that caused by Hesperadin, a small-molecule competitive inhibitor of Aurora B kinase, whose activity is crucially required for chromosome alignment (<a href=\"#bib30\">Hauf et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). CENP-M depletion also caused robust mitotic arrest, likely a consequence of spindle checkpoint activation caused by chromosome alignment defects (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>).

                                "text": "CENP-I (known as Mis6 and Ctf3 in <i>S. pombe</i> and <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, respectively [<a href=\"#bib73\">Saitoh et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Measday et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Nishihashi et al., 2002</a>]) had been initially excluded from these analyses because its expression in bacteria or insect cells had not resulted in a soluble product in cell lysates. Previous observations suggested that CENP-I might interact with CENP-H and CENP-K (<a href=\"#bib69\">Pot et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Okada et al., 2006</a>), but formal proof through reconstitution with recombinant proteins had been missing. CENP-H (known as Fta3 and Mcm16 in <i>S. pombe</i> and <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, respectively [<a href=\"#bib75\">Sanyal et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Sugata et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Liu et al., 2005</a>]) and CENP-K (known as Sim4 and Mcm22 in <i>S. pombe</i> and <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, respectively [<a href=\"#bib68\">Poddar et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Pidoux et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Foltz et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Okada et al., 2006</a>]) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>) form a tight dimer when co-expressed in, and purified from, insect cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, panel A). Co-expression of full-length CENP-I or CENP-I<sup>57\u2013C</sup> (a CENP-I fragment lacking the first 56 residues of CENP-I, predicted to be disordered) with CENP-H and CENP-K led to a partial solubilization of CENP-I, but the resulting soluble material was unstable and could not be purified homogenously (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, panel D). We therefore asked if further co-expression of CENP-M favored solubilization of CENP-I<sup>57\u2013C</sup>. Indeed, co-expression of CENP-M with CENP-I<sup>57\u2013C</sup>, CENP-H and CENP-K resulted in a soluble and stable 4-subunit complex that could be purified to homogeneity (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, panels C\u2013E). Thus, CENP-M stabilizes a quaternary complex containing CENP-H, CENP-I<sup>57\u2013C</sup>, CENP-K, and CENP-M, to which we refer as \u2018HIKM complex\u2019. The theoretical molecular masses of the HIKM complex and of recombinant HI<sup>57\u2013C</sup>KM complex used in our studies are 166 and 159 kDa, respectively. In SEC experiments, the HI<sup>57\u2013C</sup>KM complex eluted close to the 158-kDa protein marker (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>), suggesting that the recombinant complex contains a single copy of each subunit."

Subsequent mass spectrometry analysis identified numerous cross-links between CENP-H and CENP-K, the majority of which mapped to the central domains of these proteins, which are likely to adopt an \u03b1-helical arrangement. The specific co-linear distribution of cross-links in this region suggests that CENP-H and CENP-K interact through an extended interface in a parallel arrangement (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>; the list of crosslinks is available in <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1</a>)."

Two cross-links, however, were observed between CENP-M and CENP-I (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). In SEC experiments, CENP-M did not interact with CENP-I<sup>57\u2013281</sup> (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, panel G) or with the CENP-HI<sup>57\u2013281</sup>K complex (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>), collectively suggesting that the incorporation of CENP-M in the CENP-HIKM complex requires CENP-I, and that the interaction of CENP-M with CENP-I requires residues located C-terminally to residue 281. However, co-expression of CENP-M with CENP-I was insufficient to solubilize CENP-I (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, left part of panel E). In summary, these observations suggest that CENP-I bridges CENP-H/K and CENP-M, and that both CENP-H/K and CENP-M contribute to CENP-I solubility and stabilization."

They can act as molecular switches by engaging in different interactions with effectors that depend on the bound nucleotide (GTP or GDP). Small GTPases describe a superfamily of proteins, which are generally classified in several families (<a href=\"#bib72\">Rojas et al., 2012</a>). Structural superposition with representative members of different families identified Rab proteins as the closest structural homologs of CENP-M (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). A sequence alignment derived from the structural superposition of HsCENP-M with HsRab1A (PDB code 4FMC, [<a href=\"#bib19\">Dong et al., 2012</a>]) shows that CENP-M has lost essential sequence motifs required for GTP binding and hydrolysis by small G-proteins (<a href=\"#bib92\">Vetter and Wittinghofer, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). For instance, the glycine-rich P-loop (GX<sub>4</sub>GKS/T, where X is any aminoacid), which is involved in GTP binding by GTPases, lacks two essential Gly residues in CENP-M. The so-called switch I and switch II regions of small GTPases, which are sensitive to nucleotide hydrolysis and create a dependency on nucleotide status for the interaction of GTPases with their effectors (<a href=\"#bib92\">Vetter and Wittinghofer, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Cherfils and Zeghouf, 2013</a>), are also profoundly modified in CENP-M. A deletion of the entire \u03b11-\u03b22 loop and the \u03b22 strand effectively removed the switch I region (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>), while the sequence corresponding to switch II (DxxG motif) is highly divergent. Thus, HsCENP-M has the fold of a small GTPase, but may be unable to bind (and therefore hydrolyze) GTP. Experiments with MANT nucleotides (<a href=\"#bib35\">Hiratsuka, 1983</a>) confirmed this prediction directly (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, panel D)."

For instance, distant CENP-M family members retain a canonical P-loop (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, panel E, \u2018Discussion\u2019). More importantly, phylogenetic analyses using a CENP-M/Rab1 structure-based sequence alignment (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>, see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 for details) replicated the distribution of Ras sub-families previously described using a different template alignment (<a href=\"#bib72\">Rojas et al., 2012</a>). CENP-M family members cluster at the base of the RAB/RAS sub-families, suggesting that CENP-M might have originated at a similar time. The relative location of the ARF/SRPRB sub-families seems to exclude CENP-M as a basal member of the superfamily. Early divergent eukaryotes (such as amoebas) and early metazoans (molluscs) express both CENP-M and <i>bona fide</i> GTPases. CENP-M, however, has been lost from most fungi, where additional protein products of specific lineage expansions or existing Rab proteins may fulfill its role (\u2018Discussion\u2019). In conclusion, we identify CENP-M as a \u2018pseudo G-protein\u2019, in analogy to inactive kinase domains, indicated with the term \u2018pseudokinase\u2019."

Furthermore, the only two cross-links between CENP-M and CENP-I mapped near the N- and the C-termini of CENP-I (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>).

To overcome this objection, we sought to identify point mutations in CENP-M affecting its interaction with CENP-I. To identify such mutants, we focused on conserved residues exposed at the surface of CENP-M (indicated with an asterisk in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a> and displayed in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>; see also the alignment in <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, panel E), reasoning that at least a subset of such conserved surface-exposed residues might be involved in CENP-I binding. We then co-expressed GST-CENP-M or its point mutants with CENP-H, CENP-I, and CENP-K in insect cells, and monitored the amount of CENP-I co-purifying with GST-CENP-M on a glutathione\u2013sepharose resin (data not shown).

Both these proteins likely span a large fraction of the physical distance that separates chromatin from microtubules (<a href=\"#bib38\">Hori et al., 2008a</a>, <a href=\"#bib40\">2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib93\">Wan et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Gascoigne et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Przewloka et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Screpanti et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Suzuki et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Schleiffer et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Nishino et al., 2013</a>). CENP-C interacts directly with the CENP-A nucleosome (<a href=\"#bib7\">Carroll et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Kato et al., 2013</a>). CENP-T, on the other hand, has been proposed to form a nucleosome-like structure that might flank the CENP-A nucleosome and other canonical H3 nucleosomes in centromeres (<a href=\"#bib38\">Hori et al., 2008a</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Nishino et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib85\">Takeuchi et al., 2014</a>).

Indeed, both CENP-T and CENP-C interact directly with outer kinetochore components, and the CENP-T/W complex has been proposed to contribute to a pathway of Ndc80 recruitment that is independent of the Mis12 complex (<a href=\"#bib26\">Gascoigne et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Schleiffer et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Hori et al., 2013</a>)."

CENP-C has been implicated in a direct interaction with the Mis12 complex (<a href=\"#bib71\">Przewloka et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Screpanti et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Consistently with the retention of CENP-C in cells depleted of CENP-M, the kinetochore levels of Nsl1, a subunit of the Mis12 complex, remained largely normal after CENP-M depletion (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Depletion of CENP-M, on the other hand, resulted in co-depletion of CENP-T/W from kinetochores. Importantly, this defect was rescued by GFP-CENP-M<sup>wt</sup> but not CENP-M<sup>L94A\u2013L163E</sup> (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). In line with the idea that CENP-T/W contributes to recruit the Ndc80 complex to kinetochores, loss of CENP-T/W in CENP-M depleted cells correlated with a severe reduction of the kinetochore levels of Ndc80 (also known as Hec1), a subunit of the Ndc80 complex (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>).

Untagged CENP-T/W/X/S complex (<a href=\"#bib59\">Nishino et al., 2012</a>) bound directly to the HIKM complex and was retained on GST-HIKM beads (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>.

A version of the CENP-T/W/S/X complex containing CENP-T<sup>458\u2013C</sup>, which only contains the histone-fold domain of CENP-T, rather than full-length CENP-T, bound to GST-HIKM equally effectively (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>).

For instance, at least six kinetochore proteins, including the CCAN subunit CENP-O and CENP-P (respectively orthologs of Mcm21 and Ctf19 of <i>S. cerevisiae</i>), contain RWD domains (<a href=\"#bib78\">Schmitzberger and Harrison, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Petrovic et al., 2014</a>). More recently, the structure of the Chl4/Iml3 complex of <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, respectively orthologs of CENP-N and CENP-L, revealed structural similarity with the bacterial recombination-association protein RdgC and with TATA-binding protein TBP (<a href=\"#bib29\">Guo et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Hinshaw and Harrison, 2013</a>). In this study, we have extended the collection of kinetochore folds by demonstrating that CENP-M folds like a small GTPase, as recently postulated based on prediction methods (<a href=\"#bib95\">Westermann and Schleiffer, 2013</a>). CENP-M is devoid of all essential sequence signatures associated with nucleotide binding, hydrolysis and conformational switching of small GTPases (<a href=\"#bib92\">Vetter and Wittinghofer, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Rojas et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Cherfils and Zeghouf, 2013</a>). An invariant feature of CENP-M is the presence of leucine at position 52 (of HsCENP-M), equivalent to Gln61 (Q61) at the end of the Switch II region of Ras (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Mutation of Gln61 to Leu impairs GTP hydrolysis (<a href=\"#bib76\">Scheidig et al., 1999</a>) and unleashes the transforming potential of Ras. Thus, the first step leading CENP-M to diverge from genuine GTPases might have been an impairment of GTP hydrolysis, followed by the loss of other features associated with GTP handling. Consistent with this hypothesis, a substantially conserved P-loop is present in distant CENP-M family members (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, panel E). Our phylogenetic analysis identified CENP-M as a <i>bona fide</i> member of the small GTPase tree and suggests that CENP-M might have evolved from an ancestor shared with Rab-family GTPases."

Conversely, the other components of the complex, CENP-H, CENP-I, and CENP-K, are nearly ubiquitously conserved and are clearly identified in fungi, where they appear to interact (<a href=\"#bib53\">Measday et al., 2002</a>). Given the importance of CENP-M in kinetochore assembly and stability, and its interaction with evolutionarily conserved proteins, its absence in several representatives of Opisthokonta is puzzling. We consider it unlikely that the fission yeast protein Mis17 is a CENP-M ortholog, as recently proposed (<a href=\"#bib81\">Shiroiwa et al., 2011</a>), because all computational prediction tools we tested failed to identify a domain related to GTPases in Mis17 (data not shown). It is possible, however, that Mis17 acts as a functional analogue of CENP-M. It is also legitimate to speculate that a functional GTPase, possibly a Rab-family GTPase given its evolutionary proximity to CENP-M, might take up the function of CENP-M in those organisms in which CENP-M cannot be identified."

An N-terminal domain of CENP-I (residues 57\u2013281) is sufficient to bind the CENP-H/K sub-complex, while the C-terminal half (residues 282-C) is necessary to bind CENP-M. Contiguity between CENP-H, CENP-I, and CENP-K had been previously hypothesized based on proteomic analysis of precipitates from cellular lysates, from the similarity of phenotypes caused by depletion of individual subunits, and from 2-hybrid interaction data (<a href=\"#bib53\">Measday et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Okada et al., 2006</a>). However, that the interactions among these subunits were direct, and that CENP-M was also part of the complex, had remained unclear. Thus, our reconstitution of a stable quaternary complex, the HIKM complex, significantly extends these previous analyses and identifies a new stable sub-complex of crucial importance for kinetochore stability."

However, we now show that the HIKM complex is mutually required for stable association of CENP-T/W with kinetochores. The identification of a direct interaction between the HIKM complex and the CENP-T/W complex may configure a mechanistic basis for this phenomenon. Thus, the sole interaction with centromeric chromatin (\u2018Introduction\u2019) is not sufficient to recruit or retain CENP-T/W at kinetochores in the absence of the subunits of the HIKM complex. Collectively, our observations, together with (a) recent structural data on DNA-bound CENP-T/W/S/X (<a href=\"#bib85\">Takeuchi et al., 2014</a>), (b) previous observations that CENP-T and CENP-W undergo relatively rapid turnover times at centromeres (<a href=\"#bib70\">Prendergast et al., 2011</a>), and (c) previous observations that CENP-S/X occupies a rather peripheral position within kinetochores (<a href=\"#bib2\">Amano et al., 2009</a>) suggest that the hypothesis that CENP-T/W/S/X are embedded in a nucleosome-like structure (<a href=\"#bib59\">Nishino et al., 2012</a>) might require further scrutiny."

Conversely, disruption of the CENP-M/CENP-I interaction, or depletion of CENP-T, did not have major effects on the kinetochore localization of CENP-C, as previously suggested (<a href=\"#bib27\">Goshima et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Liu et al., 2006</a>). These findings unequivocally position CENP-T/W downstream of CENP-C, as previously proposed (<a href=\"#bib7\">Carroll et al., 2010</a>), and imply that the interaction of CENP-C with CENP-A, possibly together with the interaction of CENP-L/N with CENP-A, represents the apex of the CCAN recruitment pathway (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>).

                                "text": "To search for CENP-M homologous sequences, we first conducted PSI-blast searches using HsCENP-M. This identified a distant CENP-M ortholog from <i>Crassostrea gigas</i> (K1QTP9_CRAGI), whose sequence was then used for further iterative searches of the NCBI non-redundant database using hidden Markov models (HMM) (<a href=\"#bib21\">Eddy, 2011</a>). At the third iteration, four sequences gave a significant match above threshold: a predicted protein from the sponge <i>Amphimedon queenslandica</i> (gi|340373098, e-value 0.00094), the GTP binding protein SAS1 from the fungus <i>Lodderomyces elongisporus</i> (gi|146447565, e-value 0.0036), a hypothetical protein from the amoeba <i>Dictyostelum purpureum</i> (gi|330794657, e-value 0.0017), and a Ras-related protein from the arthropod <i>Aedes aegypti</i> (gi|157117562, e-value 0.0092). We removed the redundancy of this alignment (50%) to keep the most representative sequences from the profile. Only common regions to the retrieved and CENP-M proteins present in the alignment were extracted (\u223c140 amino acids). We then removed the four retrieved sequences from the alignment, built a new profile consisting only of 18 CENP-M sequences and searched the non-redundant database using hmmsearch (<a href=\"#bib21\">Eddy, 2011</a>). The discarded sequences were again identified above threshold. Reciprocally, we then removed the CENP-M sequences from the alignment keeping only the four distant orthologs and generated a new HMM profile that was used to search the non-redundant database. The CENP-M protein from <i>Crassostrea gigas</i> (gi|405975648, or K1QTP9_CRAGI) was recovered at e-value 0.00034. Additional Blast (delta) searches with this protein provided CENP-M proteins. Given the large divergence in sequence similarity and the inability to obtain reliable sequence alignments for the N-terminal part of the CENP-M sequences with <i>bona fide</i> small GTPases, we created a sequence alignment from structural alignments. Rab1A (PDB 4FMC_D) was the best template found using CE algorithm (<a href=\"#bib80\">Shindyalov and Bourne, 1998</a>) (3.6 \u00c5 root mean square deviation). The region spanning residues 66\u2013156 of HsCENP-M displays the highest structural conservation between GTPases and CENP-M and identified reciprocal sequence similarities in iterative HMM searches. We derived a sequence alignment from the CENP-M/Rab1A structural alignment and built a profile from it. CENP-M, Rab1A, the identified GTPases, additional hits, and a selected group of sequences from the five classical GTPase families were aligned to the profile using hmmalign (<a href=\"#bib21\">Eddy, 2011</a>). The alignment was visually inspected to detect inaccuracies and was used as input for phylogenetic inference using Maximum Likelihood (<a href=\"#bib28\">Guindon et al., 2009</a>). PhyML was run using mpi implementation, with SPR and 5 starting trees. All parameters were optimized and 1002 bootstrap replicates were obtained from the tree (commands: mpirun -n 6 phyml-mpi -i 175toPhyML.phylip -b 1002 -d aa -m LG -f m -s SPR --rand_start --n_rand_starts 5 -v e -a e -o tlr). The tree was visualized using iTOL (<a href=\"#bib45\">Letunic and Bork, 2007</a>) and is depicted in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>."

In this manuscript, Basilico and colleagues define the structure, function and interactions of an essential protein complex at centromeres the protein the CENP-HIKM complex.

What follows is an impressive biochemical, structural and bioinformatic characterisation of CENP-HIKM (HIKM).

This model would be further supported by depleting CENP-I and showing complete loss of CENP-M from kinetochores. For example, if CENP-M had other roles at centromeres that didn't involve CENP-I, but did involve the CENP-M's L94 and L163 residues, I would expect the same results as those presented in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>."

This result was previously published and should be better referenced (<a href=\"#bib7\">Caroll et al. 2010</a>).

The principle conclusions are that the fold of the protein is that of a degenerate GTPase and is required for the formation of a larger \u201cHIKM\u201d complex that acts upstream of several other CCAN components, notably the TWSX histone fold complex. These conclusions are supported by a variety of structural, biochemical and cell-based studies. In addition, a model for the HIKM complex based upon bioinformatic, cross-linking and EM studies is proposed. The data are well presented, thorough and of high quality. The notion that that the HIKM complex is upstream of TWSX recruitment and does not necessarily constitute a parallel pathway is also consistent with the evolutionary distribution of CCAN components. Overall, I think the study is eminently suitable for publication in <i>eLife</i>."

While it may prove to be broadly accurate, a more detailed bioinformatic analysis would strengthen the paper. For example, given that the predicted structure contains multiple HEAT repeats, can these then be identified on the basis of sequence alone, and aligned to each other? Are the predicted structures of Ctf3 and Mis6 similar to that of CENP-I (and do they contain putative repeats)? Presumably if the interaction with CENP-M occurs on the concave inner surface by analogy to the Ran-Importin structure, there should be conserved features present. Can these been identified and mapped to the modelled structure? I'm also not entirely convinced that the cross-linking data supports the N- to C- termini interaction as claimed. While there are indeed intramolecular cross-links found between these regions, there appear to be an almost equal number between the extreme N-terminal of the protein and the region around residue 300, implicated CENP-H/K binding. It is a little difficult to reconcile these observations with the model presented. Furthermore the schematic presented in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a> implies that the coiled-coil of CENP-HK runs parallel to the outside surface of CENP-I (which is convex in the model) and would place the axis of the coiled-coil at right angles to the axis of the HEAT repeat, which seems unlikely (and also would probably not fit into the EM reconstruction as suggested in supplemental <a href=\"#fig4\">figure 4</a>). I appreciate that in the absence of experimental data, these types of modelling study are useful, but there is a danger of them becoming accepted as reality, particularly if determining the high-resolution structure of the complex proves intractable."

This model would be further supported by depleting CENP-I and showing complete loss of CENP-M from kinetochores.

We have therefore tried to perform this experiment by using silencing oligonucleotides designed based on a previous report (Liu et all, NCB 2003). We first tested the protocol described in the paper and that consisted in one round of transfection and a depletion time of 72 hrs. The results were disappointing, as the cells showed a very modest decrease in CENP-I levels. We therefore performed another experiment, using a protocol similar to the one used for CENP-M in our manuscript. Unfortunately, the depletion levels remained low (approximately a 20-30% decrease). It appears therefore that this experiment might require significant more preparation and troubleshooting than we had anticipated, and ultimately opted to submit the revised manuscript without it. We note however that Obuse <i>et al.</i> (Nature Cell Biology 2006) reported loss of CENP-M in DT40 chicken cells knockout for CENP-I, in line with the prediction that these proteins may be co-dependent for kinetochore localization."
