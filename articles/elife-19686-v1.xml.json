Here, we focus on the endocrine control ecdysis behavior, which is used by arthropods to shed their cuticle at the end of every molt. Ecdysis is triggered by ETH (Ecdysis triggering hormone), and we show that the response of peptidergic neurons that produce CCAP (crustacean cardioactive peptide), which are key targets of ETH and control the onset of ecdysis behavior, depends fundamentally on the actions of neuropeptides produced by other direct targets of ETH and released in a broad paracrine manner within the CNS; by autocrine influences from the CCAP neurons themselves; and by inhibitory actions mediated by GABA. Our findings provide insights into how this critical insect behavior is controlled and general principles for understanding how neuropeptides organize neuronal activity and behaviors."

But how does the nervous system decide when to start or stop a particular behavior? Molecules called neuropeptides are thought to play a key role in these decisions. Neuropeptides are produced by organs throughout the body and also by the nervous system itself. When neuropeptides act on neurons responsible for a particular behavior \u2013 such as feeding \u2013 they can inform those neurons about conditions elsewhere in the body and the brain. This enables the nervous system to decide whether to start or stop the behavior. Yet, how the signals from the different neuropeptides are integrated is poorly understood."

A number of neuropeptides control ecdysis: for example, a key neuropeptide called ecdysis-triggering hormone (ETH) triggers the process. However, it was not clear how each of the other neuropeptides that are released at this time contributes to the behaviors involved in ecdysis."

ETH can therefore cause different behavioral outcomes depending on the actions of the other neuropeptides."

The mapping of the neural circuits that underlie a behavior is considered a necessary first step toward this goal, and efforts to determine the \u2018connectome\u2019 of different parts of the nervous system have been present since the beginnings of modern neuroscience. They start with the classical inferred synaptic relationships in Cajal\u2019s anatomical analyses (<a href=\"#bib49\">Ram\u00f3n y Cajal, 1899</a>), through the detailed information on the wiring of some invertebrate circuits (e.g., <a href=\"#bib9\">Carew et al., 1981</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Comer and Robertson, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">King, 1976a</a>, <a href=\"#bib33\">1976b</a>), culminating with the complete map of the <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> central nervous system (CNS) (<a href=\"#bib62\">White et al., 1986</a>), and the wiring diagrams of the <i>Drosophila</i> optic lobes (<a href=\"#bib57\">Takemura et al., 2013</a>) and the mammalian retina (<a href=\"#bib26\">Helmstaedter et al., 2013</a>). Yet, research into the functioning of neuronal networks has revealed that a wiring diagram is usually not enough to understand what a neuronal network can do, although it does inform on its possible outcomes. One of the elements that adds tremendous multiplicity to the universe of possible outputs of a neural circuit is the action of neuromodulators, including biogenic amines and neuropeptides. In conjunction with classical transmitters, they can gate the input to a circuit or reconfigure its pattern of activity, thereby causing the same circuit to produce qualitatively different outputs (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bargmann, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bargmann and Marder, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Brezina, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Leinwand and Chalasani, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Marder, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Nusbaum and Blitz, 2012</a>)."

How these actions are effected is poorly understood because neuropeptides can be broadly released within the CNS and exert combinatorial and non-linear effects (<a href=\"#bib7\">Brezina, 2010</a>). In addition, we know little about how these gatekeepers are themselves regulated, yet such knowledge is also critical for understanding how the expression of a behavioral state is controlled. Here, we report on the genetic dissection, using <i>Drosophila</i>, of the response of a network of peptidergic neurons that controls the stereotyped and sequential insect behavior of ecdysis, and which represents a tractable system in which these questions can be addressed."

A current model proposes that each class of peptidergic ETH targets then activates or modulates specific phases of ecdysis behavior (<a href=\"#bib31\">Kim et al., 2006</a>). However, the mechanism responsible for producing the sequential activation of these targets in response to a common ETH stimulus is currently unknown."

For this we focused on the subset of neurons that produce CCAP (Crustacean cardioactive peptide), which play a key role in the control of ecdysis (<a href=\"#bib31\">Kim et al., 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib31\">2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Lahr et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Park et al., 2003</a>). We show that the response of CCAP neurons to ETH and the ensuing ecdysis behaviors depend on direct actions mediated by the ETH trigger as well as on the actions of neuropeptides downstream of ETH together with inhibition mediated by GABA. Importantly, we found that removal of a downstream neuropeptide can eliminate the rhythmic pattern of neuronal activity induced by ETH, revealing that such neuropeptides are critical for the expression of the fundamental features of this neural response. Our findings have implications for understanding how this vital insect behavior is controlled. The principles that emerge are also relevant for understanding how peptidergic networks control behavioral states."

Pupal ecdysis consists of a sequence of behavioral subroutines, which starts with the preparatory behavior of pre-ecdysis, during which the hardened larval cuticle of the puparium is loosened from the underlying pupal cuticle through slow anteriorly\u00a0directed movements of the body. This phase is followed by ecdysis proper, during which alternating left-right contractions lead into a phase of anteriorly\u00a0directed peristalses that eventually cause head eversion, during which the brain is pushed anterior to the mouth. During the final phase of the behavioral sequence (post ecdysis), alternating left-right contractions and then posteriorly directed movements produce a body with the external shape of an adult fly (<a href=\"#bib31\">Kim et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Lahr et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Park et al., 2003</a>). Each of these phases has a stereotyped duration and pattern of activity, which can be recorded in intact (<a href=\"#bib31\">Kim et al., 2015</a>, <a href=\"#bib36\">Lahr et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Park et al., 2003</a>) and puparium-free preparations (<a href=\"#bib31\">Kim et al., 2006</a>; cf., Figure 2, below). In addition, fictive ecdysis can be visualized in ex vivo CNS preparations challenged with ETH that express the calcium sensor, GCaMP, in motoneurons (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>). Consistent with the behaviors observed at ecdysis, the pattern of motor activity expressed in vitro in response to ETH consists of an initial phase that primarily recruits activity in the posterior region of the ventral nervous system (VNS) ('P' region, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1Ab,Ba</a>; corresponding to pre-ecdysis) followed by a barrage of activity throughout the left and right sides of the VNS neuropils ('L', <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1Ac; Bb</a>; and 'R' regions, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1Ad; Bd</a>). Importantly, expansion of this latter section of the record reveals that the 'L' and 'R' regions are active in an alternating pattern (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1Be</a>), consistent with the prominent left-right repetitive contractions seen at ecdysis in the intact animal."

In control animals, the two pairs of serial CCAP homologs showed a characteristic response to 600 nM ETH: whereas one set of neurons (called here \u03b1 neurons, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C\u2013E</a>) responded ca. 20 min after ETH challenge with a barrage of GCaMP spikes, the other (called here \u03b2 neurons, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,D</a>) responded after a similar delay with a sustained increase in fluorescence. Based on the electrophysiological activity recorded in <i>Manduca</i> (<a href=\"#bib21\">Gammie and Truman, 1997</a>), we assume that the \u03b1 neurons correspond to the projection \u2018Cell 27\u2019 neurons, whereas the \u03b2 neurons correspond to interneurons \u2018IN704\u2019. Expression of ETHR RNAi in CCAP neurons caused a significant delay in the onset of the response (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F,H</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Kim et al., 2015</a>), and the period of activity was shorter and included a smaller number of peaks (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F,I,J</a>) (In these records, the responses of \u03b1 and \u03b2 neurons have been combined as they could not be unambiguously distinguished). This weakening of the response was seen in CCAP neurons in thoracic segment 3 (TN3) as well as in serial homologs in abdominal segments 1\u20134 (AN1-4) but was not detected in AN8-9, which may not express ETHR (<a href=\"#bib15\">Diao et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Kim et al., 2006</a>). Further reduction of ETHR function, accomplished using <i>ETHR</i> hemizygosity, did not simply reduce the response further, revealing that indirect as well as direct ETH actions may be involved in determining the response of CCAP neurons to ETH. Indeed, in such animals, the latency to respond was generally more similar to that of the control (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G,H</a>), whereas its duration and number of spikes was more similar to those observed when ETHR RNAi was expressed in a wild-type background (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3I,J</a>). Significantly, however, as illustrated in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F,G</a> and quantitated in <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, both manipulations severely reduced the amplitude of the response. Thus, for animals expressing ETHR RNAi it was reduced four-fold for CCAP neurons AN1-4 and AN8-9, and eight-fold in CCAP neurons TN3, AN1-4, and AN8-9 for animals expressing ETHR RNAi in a ETHR hemizygous background. This reduced response may be the basis for the much weaker behavior expressed by these genotypes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1C</a> and <a href=\"#fig2\">2</a>). We do not know the cause of the differential effects on CCAP neurons TN3 vs. AN1-4 for these and other manipulations carried out in this study; we assume that they are due to differential ETHR expression and/or synaptic inputs."

However, genetic analyses have shown that <i>pburs</i>, which encodes one of the subunits of the heterodimeric bursicon hormone, also plays a role in the control of ecdysial behaviors (<a href=\"#bib36\">Lahr et al., 2012</a>). Bursicon is of particular interest in the context of this work because it is expressed by a subset of the CCAP neurons themselves and could therefore play a (direct or indirect) autocrine role in determining the response of these neurons to ETH. Consistent with the findings of <a href=\"#bib36\">Lahr et al. (2012)</a>, the lack of PBURS (and thus of the heteromeric bursicon) in intact puparia caused a lengthening of ecdysis, with only 5/8 animals executing the behavior (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Puparium-free preparations lacking PBURS, by contrast, expressed a significantly shorter ecdysis motor program (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>); a similar defect was obtained expressing <i>pburs</i> RNAi in CCAP neurons (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Importantly, the defects expressed by hemizygous mutant animals in both types of preparations were rescued by a transgene containing the <i>pburs</i> gene (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>) indicating that they are due to the lack of <i>pburs</i> function. The apparently opposite phenotypes expressed by these two types of preparations are likely due to the different criteria that are used to define the ecdysial phases in intact vs. puparium-free animals. At the level of the response of CCAP neurons, the lack of PBURS caused, on average, a two-fold decrease in the amplitude of the response to ETH of CCAP neurons AN1-4 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>; see also <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). (These and other experiments involving mutations in <i>pburs</i> had to be done using the LexA/LexAop binary expression system due to interference from GAL4; see legend to <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a> for further details.) It also accelerated the time of onset and shortened the response for some of the CCAP neurons (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C,D</a>). No effects on the timing or amplitude of the response were detected in CCAP neurons AN8-9, suggesting that they may not express the bursicon receptor. In summary, the absence of <i>pburs</i> function caused quantitative changes to the response of CCAP neurons to ETH, revealing that a neurohormone made by the CCAP neurons themselves participates in determining their response to the ETH trigger."

For this reason, GCaMP responses to ETH of <i>pburs</i> mutants were assessed using <i>Ccap</i>-LexA driver (cf., <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). Genotypes: Control (GAL4): CCAP-GAL4+UAS-GCaMP; Control (LexA): CCAP-LexA+LexAop-GCaMP.

Thus, although EH (<a href=\"#bib31\">Kim et al., 2006</a>) and Kinin (<a href=\"#bib15\">Diao et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Kim et al., 2015</a>) neurons respond within ca. 10 min of an ETH challenge, CCAP neurons do not respond until around ca. 20 min after ETH stimulation, with different subsets showing different and characteristic latencies (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C,F</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Kim et al., 2006</a>). The delay in the execution of the ecdysial phase of ecdysis behavior, which correlates with the time of activation of CCAP neurons, has been hypothesized to occur through inhibitory influences originating from the brain and/or subesophageal ganglion (<a href=\"#bib4\">Baker et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Ewer and Reynolds, 2002</a>); <a href=\"#bib17\">Ewer and Truman, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Fuse and Truman, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Zitnan and Adams, 2000</a>). Nevertheless, the exact origin and nature of this inhibition is currently unknown. In order to investigate the role of inhibition in the response of CCAP neurons to ETH, we first examined their time course of activation in the presence of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor (GABA-RA) blocker, picrotoxin (100 \u00b5M; <a href=\"#bib53\">Rohrbough and Broadie, 2002</a>). As shown in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D,F</a>, pharmacological inhibition of GABA-RA caused a significant reduction in the latency to respond; this effect was most dramatic in neurons from segments AN1-4, where the time to onset was reduced by almost 50% (from around 20 to 10 min). Other changes were also apparent in these preparations. Most noteworthy was the more sustained nature of the response (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a>), which suggests that the pronounced spikes that are normally seen (e.g., <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>) are partly accomplished through inhibitory processes mediated by GABA. Similar results were obtained using the GABA-RA inhibitor, gabazine (100 \u00b5M; <a href=\"#bib28\">Hosie and Sattelle, 1996</a>; data not shown)."

We assume that the neuron expressing the spikes corresponds to the \u03b1 neuron (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>), whereas the other corresponds to the \u03b2 member of the pair. Most importantly, the main effect of challenging the preparations with ETH in the presence of picrotoxin was a shortening of the latency to depolarize, without significantly affecting the total duration of the entire response (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C</a>). Finally, a quantitative analysis of the latency and duration of the voltage vs. GCaMP response (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9D</a>) reveals that both responses show an overall very similar timecourse. These results suggest that GABA inhibition delays the depolarization of CCAP neurons caused by ETH. This inhibition would then be lifted at around 20 min, causing the depolarization and firing of CCAP neurons, which results in the calcium spikes recorded using the GCaMP sensor (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>) and the activation of the ecdysis motor program."

                        "text": "Ecdysis behavior consists of behavioral routines and physiological events that are expressed in a specific sequence. At the neural level, the sequential nature of ecdysis is based on the sequential activation of different ETH targets. Here, we have identified some of the elements involved in determining the time course of activation of CCAP neurons. The CCAP neurons express ETHR, and by targeting ETHR RNAi to these neurons we showed that the timecourse and intensity of their response to ETH is sensitive to the dosage of ETHR. The associated lengthening of pre-ecdysis and failures in ecdysis underscore the well-established role for these neurons as key regulators of ecdysis (<a href=\"#bib31\">Kim et al., 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib31\">2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Lahr et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Park et al., 2003</a>). In addition to ETH, however, we show that several elements downstream of this triggering hormone including EH, PBURS, and GABA play a key role in determining the response of CCAP neurons (whether GABA neurons mediating this inhibition are direct or indirect targets of ETH is currently unknown). Thus, we found that the response of CCAP neurons is qualitatively changed in the absence of EH, causing a decrease in the amplitude and dramatically altering the temporal features of the response, with a concomitant failure to ecdyse. Interestingly, we show that PBURS, which is produced by a subset of CCAP neurons, is also involved in patterning the response of these neurons to ETH, revealing a (direct or indirect) autocrine regulation of CCAP activation. Finally, we show that GABA inhibition mediates at least part of the delay between exposure to ETH and CCAP neuron activation and may also sculpt the shape of the resulting pattern of activation. Our findings are summarized in the model shown in <a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>; the model details the contributions to the activation of CCAP neurons from ETH, peptides produced by targets of ETH including the CCAP neurons themselves, as well as inhibitory effects mediated by GABA, and define the times when these influences participate during the expression of the different phases of ecdysis. In addition to these actions, there are several features of the response to ETH whose origins await elucidation. For instance, decreasing ETH effectiveness using RNAi or different concentrations of ETH revealed the existence of non-linear processes whose basis is currently unknown. They could simply reflect the non-linear activation of GPCRs and/or may occur because the various targets that are activated or inhibited by ETH may respond differentially and non-linearly to different concentrations of this neuropeptide, as occurs in other cases of neuromodulation (<a href=\"#bib7\">Brezina, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Marder et al., 2014</a>). Similarly, there remains a 10-min delay in the onset of the response of CCAP neurons that is not mediated by GABA inhibition. Dissecting the contributions of different modulators and their targets to the response of this neuronal ensemble will undoubtedly be aided by the availability of recently developed genetic tools (<a href=\"#bib15\">Diao et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Luan et al., 2006</a>) that can be used for the precise manipulation of receptor spatial expression. Finally, we still do not know how the activation of the various peptidergic targets of ETH causes the production of the ecdysial motor programs (cf., <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>). Preliminary evidence indicates that CCAP may play an important role in directly activating these motor programs because the timing of GCaMP activity in motoneurons follows closely the pattern of GCaMP activity of CCAP neurons (Mena and Ewer, unpublished)."

                        "text": "In many motor systems, repetitive motor outputs are produced by central pattern generators (CPG\u2019s) whose exact pattern of activity is then modulated by biogenic amines and neuropeptides (<a href=\"#bib7\">Brezina, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Marder et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Nusbaum and Blitz, 2012</a>). In the case of the ecdysis motor program, intrinsic modulatory actions (<a href=\"#bib29\">Katz, 1995</a>) appear to play a defining role in the expression of the neural response elicited by ETH and of its accompanying motor output. Thus, for example, the lack of EH destroys the repetitive pattern of firing of CCAP neurons induced by ETH (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>) as well as that of the resulting motor output (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B and F</a>). What might the advantage be of not hardwiring the neural bases of such a vital behavior as ecdysis? One clue may lie in the fact that, despite the diversity in ecdysial behaviors expressed by different arthropods during different molts, the neuropeptides that drive ecdysis as well as their receptors are extremely well conserved, and clear homologs can be identified even in chelicerates (<a href=\"#bib12\">Christie et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Grbi\u0107 et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Veenstra et al., 2012</a>), which diverged from the insects ca. 600 million years ago (<a href=\"#bib50\">Regier et al., 2005</a>, <a href=\"#bib50\">2010</a>). One way for such a conserved signaling pathway to produce different behavioral outputs would be to change the pattern of receptor expression. Consistent with this hypothesis, the exact function of particular ecdysial neuropeptides can differ in different insect groups and stages (<a href=\"#bib17\">White and Ewer, 2014</a>). For instance, whereas <i>Drosophila</i> lacking CCAP express normal ecdysis behaviors (<a href=\"#bib36\">Lahr et al., 2012</a>), RNAi inhibition of CCAP causes ecdysial failures in <i>Tribolium</i> (<a href=\"#bib1\">Arakane et al., 2008</a>). Likewise, bursicon is involved in postecdysial maturation following the emergence of the adult fly (<a href=\"#bib27\">Honegger et al., 2008</a>), yet is involved in the control of the earlier ecdysial phase at pupation (<a href=\"#bib36\">Lahr et al., 2012</a>). Finally, it is especially interesting to identify an inhibitory input to CCAP neurons mediated by GABA, as it could provide a route through which sensory input could modulate the time of onset of the ecdysial phase. Such an input appears to be absent in <i>Drosophila</i> larval and pupal ecdysis but plays an important role in orthopteran ecdysis (<a href=\"#bib10\">Carlson and Bentley, 1977</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Ewer and Reynolds, 2002</a>) as well as in dipteran (<a href=\"#bib4\">Baker et al., 1999</a>) and lepidopteran adult emergence (<a href=\"#bib17\">Ewer and Truman, 1997</a>). It will be very interesting to determine the extent to which differences in neuropeptide receptor expression underlie the diversity of ecdysial behaviors expressed by insects with different body plans. In other systems, the different responses elicited by well-conserved neuropeptides may also be accomplished through changes in receptor expression. Such appears to be the case for oxytocin in voles, where differences in pair bonding in monogamous vs. gregarious species are at least in part due to differences in receptor distribution (<a href=\"#bib67\">Young et al., 1999</a>)."

                        "text": "Neuropeptides can be released at synapses, along axons, and even from dendrites, from where they can influence distant targets with a timecourse that can span from seconds to hours (<a href=\"#bib38\">Leng and Ludwig, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">van den Pol, 2012</a>). Despite this mode of delivery, with low spatial and temporal specificity, their actions are typically very specific and can lead to the expression of tightly regulated responses. In the case of ecdysis behavior, for example, EH and CCAP are both broadly released into the ventral CNS, yet the timing of pre-ecdysis and ecdysis is normally extremely precise (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). Similarly, in the case of the mammalian circadian system, robust and precise circadian rhythmicity of pacemaker activity in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and of the behavioral output depends on Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide (VIP), which is released in a broad paracrine manner in the SCN (<a href=\"#bib25\">Hastings et al., 2014</a>). A similar situation may occur in the <i>Drosophila</i> circadian system, where the neuropeptide, Pigment Dispersing Factor (PDF), is critical for the coupling of the different circadian oscillators (<a href=\"#bib41\">Lin et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Shafer and Yao, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Yao and Shafer, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Yoshii et al., 2009</a>). Overall, these examples show that neuropeptides play a critical role in determining the precise output of a neural network and of the behavior it controls. In the case of ETH, the precision of the timing and phasing of the different ecdysial phases depends on its combinatorial actions with other neuropeptides including EH and CCAP, and which are likely to be highly non-linear (<a href=\"#bib7\">Brezina, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Marder et al., 2014</a>). A similar situation applies for other neuropeptide controlled behaviors such as hunger, where neurons in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus that express Agouti-related protein (Agrp) regulate feeding by integrating inputs mediated by circulating hormones (ghrelin and letpin), transmitters (glutamate, and GABA) and other peptidergic neurons (POMC neurons) (<a href=\"#bib2\">Atasoy et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Gao and Horvath, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Sohn et al., 2013</a>). These inputs provide a readout of the animal\u2019s physiological state and are then translated into a non-linear switch-like behavior, consistent with the switch-like features of hunger states (<a href=\"#bib64\">Yang et al., 2011</a>). For most systems, however, we lack information on the detailed actions exerted by each neuropeptide within a network. The inner working of the peptidergic network that controls ecdysis provides a tractable system for understanding how neuropeptides trigger and modulate complex patterns of neuronal activity and behaviors."

Focusing on a subset of neurons that produce CCAP (Crustacean cardioactive peptide), which known play a key role in the control of ecdysis, they show that the response of CCAP neurons to ETH and the ensuing ecdysis behaviors depend on direct actions mediated by ETH as well as on the actions of neuropeptides downstream of ETH together with inhibition mediated by GABA. Removal of a downstream neuropeptide, EH, can eliminate the rhythmic pattern of neuronal activity induced by ETH. These results indicate that neuropeptides are critical for the expression of the fundamental features, including timing of the underlying neuronal program for pupal ecdysis. The work has broad implication for how neuropeptides can orchestrate complex behaviors and imply that they build flexibility into neuronal networks that can be exploited developmentally and evolutionarily."

For example, the genotypes of the flies used in imaging experiments on RNAi manipulated brains should be clearly indicated either in the Results section or figure legend for every experiment. For example, it isn't clear from the description of the imaging experiments in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> how GCaMP and the ETH-R RNAi constructs were independently driven in motor neurons and CCAP expressing neurons, respectively. Was the CCAP-LexA used to drive UAS-RNAi? If so, there does not seem to be a LexAop-ETH-RNAi element described. Or was a LexA used for motor neurons (in which case the driver and the LexAop-GCaMP should be described)? With the genotypes unclear, it is difficult to access how well controlled these experiments are. For example, how well have the authors controlled for the possibility of leaky RNAi expression in the imaging experiments? Some evidence that the genetic driver is required for the RNAi effects would strengthen these experiments. The authors should ensure that every fly line used in the study is described in the Methods section."

As organized, there are several highly related experiments that are spread over two or even three figures in the manuscript. The need to move between multiple figures to compare behavioral and physiological data for similar experimental manipulations makes the manuscript difficult to follow at times. For example, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> does a nice job summarizing a great deal of data, but as presented it is a bit challenging to navigate. I would consider breaking these data up among the other figures. The reader would be better served if the ETH-R knockdown data in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> were included in the current <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> and if the ETH dose response data were combined with the current <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>.

It has been shown that the two subunits of bursicon (BURS and PBURS) heterodimerize spontaneously to the bioactive BURSICON if expressed together. Thus, the knock down of PBURS expression would prevent the production of a bioactive bursicon. In my opinion, it is simpler to assume that BURSICON has a feedback effect on the CCAP/BURSICON expressing AN neurons. Otherwise, the authors must show that in the early phases of ecdysis only PBURS is expressed, not BURS, and need to hypothesize a specific receptor for PBURS in these cells."

I would like to emphasize that the Benjamin White lab has shown convincingly that two bursicon-expressing neurons in the SEG project into all abdominal neuromers and thus may have a direct effect on the release of bursicon from the ANs. It might be worthwhile to discuss whether the indirect GABA inhibition on these cells originates from the inhibition of the SEG neurons."

It has been shown that the two subunits of bursicon (BURS and PBURS) heterodimerize spontaneously to the bioactive BURSICON if expressed together. Thus, the knock down of PBURS expression would prevent the production of a bioactive bursicon. In my opinion, it is simpler to assume that BURSICON has a feedback effect on the CCAP/BURSICON expressing AN neurons. Otherwise, the authors must show that in the early phases of ecdysis only PBURS is expressed, not BURS, and need to hypothesize a specific receptor for PBURS in these cells.</i> "

Nevertheless, there is the nagging fact that PBURS and BURS are not strictly co-expressed. Most notably, BURS is expressed in 1 pair of CCAP neurons in 8 abdominal segments whereas PBURS is only expressed in 4 of these. Thus, there are 4 segments in which CCAP neurons express only the BURS subunit of bursicon. Even though there is currently no activity associated with BURS-BURS homodimers it is difficult to escape the possibility that homodimers may be active in some context. Since we don\u2019t know which this activity may be, we chose to use the more conservative description of our results because, in our manipulations, all that we are really sure of is that we eliminated PBURS. Nevertheless, we do acknowledge in the text that the lack of PBURS causes a lack of bursicon (=BURS-PBURS heterodimer) (\u201cConsistent with the findings of (Lahr et al., 2012), the lack of PBURS (and <b>thus of the heteromeric bursicon</b>; our emphasis here) in intact puparia caused a significant lengthening of ecdysis, with only 5/8 animals executing the behavior (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>).\u201d"

Although the inhibitory SEG neurons described in these reports and mentioned by this reviewer could contribute the delay in expression of the ecdysial phase of ecdysis, there is no direct evidence that this is the case. We did not cite this work because the control of ecdysis differs between pupal and adult ecdysis (e.g., the role of bursicon changes dramatically).

Here we have advanced our understanding of the nature of this inhibition by showing that at least part of the delay in activation of CCAP neurons is due to a direct inhibition of CCAP neurons by GABA.

In addition there are several dozen neurons that express ETH-RB, whose identity is currently unknown. Yet it is unlikely that motoneurons are relevant ETH targets. Indeed, expressing ETHR RNAi in motoneurons had, at most, a modest effect on ecdysis behavior: no effect was detected on ecdysis behavior monitored in intact preparations, and only an effect on ecdysis frequency could be detected in puparium free preparations (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Thus it is unlikely that motoneurons are direct targets of ETH. Rather it is possible that peptide downstream of ETH are involved in directly controlling or modulating the ecdysis motor programs. Preliminary evidence indicates that CCAP may play an important role, because the timing of GCaMP activity in motoneurons follows closely the pattern of GCaMP activity of CCAP neurons.
