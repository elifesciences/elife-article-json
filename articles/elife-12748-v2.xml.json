One of the proteases is the a-disintegrin-and-metalloprotease 10 (ADAM10) which acts as alpha-secretase of the Alzheimer's disease amyloid precursor protein. ADAM10 is also required for neuronal network functions in murine brain, but neuronal ADAM10 substrates are only partly known. With a proteomic analysis of Adam10-deficient neurons we identified 91, mostly novel ADAM10 substrate candidates, making ADAM10 a major protease for membrane proteins in the nervous system. Several novel substrates, including the neuronal cell adhesion protein NrCAM, are involved in brain development. Indeed, we detected mistargeted axons in the olfactory bulb of conditional ADAM10-/- mice, which correlate with reduced cleavage of NrCAM, NCAM and other ADAM10 substrates. In summary, the novel ADAM10 substrates provide a molecular basis for neuronal network dysfunctions in conditional ADAM10-/- mice and demonstrate a fundamental function of ADAM10 in the brain."

One of the proteases is the a-disintegrin-and-metalloprotease 10 (ADAM10) which acts as alpha-secretase of the Alzheimer's disease amyloid precursor protein. ADAM10 is also required for neuronal network functions in murine brain, but neuronal ADAM10 substrates are only partly known. With a proteomic analysis of Adam10-deficient neurons we identified 91, mostly novel ADAM10 substrate candidates, making ADAM10 a major protease for membrane proteins in the nervous system. Several novel substrates, including the neuronal cell adhesion protein NrCAM, are involved in brain development. Indeed, we detected mistargeted axons in the olfactory bulb of conditional ADAM10-/- mice, which correlate with reduced cleavage of NrCAM, NCAM and other ADAM10 substrates. In summary, the novel ADAM10 substrates provide a molecular basis for neuronal network dysfunctions in conditional ADAM10-/- mice and demonstrate a fundamental function of ADAM10 in the brain."

This led to the nerve cells forming abnormal networks in the regions of the brain that process smells and emotions. Overall the experiments proved that ADAM10 is important not only for the prevention of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, but also for the normal development of the brain. Future studies could now explore how stimulating ADAM10 affects the levels of its substrates. Also, a better understanding of the substrates of ADAM10 may be useful both to predict side effects of drugs that activate ADAM10 and to monitor patients who are responding well to these drugs."

One of them is ADAM10, which is a ubiquitously expressed type I membrane protein whose active site is located within its ectodomain, well positioned to shed the ectodomains of its substrates (<a href=\"#bib61\">Weber and Saftig, 2012</a>). A key substrate for ADAM10 is the Notch receptor, which requires ADAM10-mediated shedding for its signaling during differentiation and development (<a href=\"#bib16\">Hartmann et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Qi et al., 1999</a>). Consequently, constitutive ADAM10-deficient mice die at embryonic day 9.5 most likely due to a loss of Notch signaling (<a href=\"#bib16\">Hartmann et al., 2002</a>). Another major substrate of ADAM10 is the amyloid precursor protein (APP) for which ADAM10 acts as the constitutive alpha-secretase (<a href=\"#bib43\">Postina et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Lammich et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Kuhn et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Jorissen et al., 2010</a>) and thus possesses the ability to prevent the generation of the pathogenic A\u03b2 peptide in Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) (<a href=\"#bib33\">Lammich et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Kuhn et al., 2010</a>). This makes ADAM10 a major drug target for AD (<a href=\"#bib43\">Postina et al., 2004</a>), and an activator of ADAM10 expression has been tested in a clinical trial for AD (<a href=\"#bib12\">Endres et al., 2014</a>). Whether such a therapeutic approach is safe, remains to be seen, in particular because relatively little is known about ADAM10 substrates in brain."

To this aim, we isolated and cultured primary neurons from E15/E16 brains of a conditional Adam10 knockout mouse model (Ad10 fl/fl) allowing an Adam10 specific knockout upon iCre expression (<a href=\"#bib15\">Gibb et al., 2010</a>). After two days in vitro (DIV) neurons were either transduced with an empty control lentivirus or a lentivirus that coded for iCre (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Two days later, neurons were incubated for another two days with the chemically modified sugar ManNAz, which is metabolized and incorporated as sialic acid into the glycan moieties of newly synthesized, cellular glycoproteins. Staining for beta III tubulin suggests that knockout of ADAM10 did not alter neuronal differentiation of primary neurons in vitro (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Media of both experimental conditions (conditioned for 48\u2009hr) were processed with the SPECS method to selectively enrich the endogenous, cellular glycoproteins in the medium. Considering at least two unique peptides per protein and detection of the protein (protein group) in at least 4 out of 5 biological replicates the mass spectrometric analysis identified 313 proteins annotated as glycoproteins. For every glycoprotein we mapped all identified peptides to its extracellular, transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains, using the QARIP webserver (<a href=\"#bib22\">Ivankov et al., 2013</a>). The majority of peptides matched to the extracellular domain, but not to the transmembrane or cytoplasmic domains (data not shown), which demonstrates that we had detected the proteolytically released ectodomain and not the full-length membrane proteins in the neuronal secretome."

The formerly known ADAM10 substrate N-Cadherin (CDH2) was borderline significant due to one outlier. Our SPECS-based substrate identification was characterized by high sensitivity as even small reductions in total shedding were detected in ADAM10-/- cells. For example, in neurons APP is mostly shed by the aspartyl protease BACE1 and only to a low extent by ADAM10 (<a href=\"#bib7\">Colombo et al., 2013</a>). Yet a 20% reduction in APP shedding upon Adam10 deletion was clearly detected in our SPECS analysis. Interestingly, some substrates, such as Neuroligin-1 are \u2018exclusive\u2019 ADAM10 substrates, as their shedding was nearly completely abolished upon ADAM10 deletion. However, for other substrates including APP and CHL1, shedding was only partly reduced in ADAM10-/- neurons, indicating that they are not only substrates for ADAM10, but also for other proteases."

In case of the receptor tyrosine phosphatase family shedding of PTPRU, PTPRG, PTPRK, PTPRS, PTPRT and PTPRD was reduced down to 12%, 17%, 26%, 40% and 43% and 42% respectively while shedding of NLGN1, NLGN3 and NLGN4 was reduced down to 17%, 38% and 56% in the Neuroligin family. Interestingly, NLGN2 shedding was not significantly affected upon ADAM10 knockout. Presynaptic Neurexins 2 and 3, binding partners of Neuroligins, showed only a mild reduction in shedding upon ADAM10 deletion (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>) suggesting that ADAM10 plays only a minor role in their proteolytic processing. Besides these families ectodomain cleavage of member 1 and 3 of the SLITRK family was strongly reduced (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>).

The L1 family, which consists of NgCAM-related cell adhesion molecule (NRCAM), L1 cell adhesion molecule (L1), Close homologue to L1 (CHL1) and Neurofascin has been proposed to play a role in axon targeting and function. We observed that shedding of NRCAM was strongly reduced down to 33%. Shedding of CHL1 was mildly reduced down to 60%. L1 shedding was reduced down to 64% (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>), which is in agreement with their additional cleavage by the protease BACE1 (<a href=\"#bib31\">Kuhn et al., 2012</a>). However, the reduction of L1 shedding did just not reach statistical significance. Another axon targeting molecule whose ectodomain shedding was reduced upon Adam10 deletion was Neogenin (NEO1), which belongs to the DCC family. Adam10 deletion also resulted in reduced ectodomain cleavage of CADM1, 3 and 4 which are members of the Cellular adhesion molecule family that has been proposed to play a role in axon myelination (<a href=\"#bib37\">Maurel et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Park et al., 2008</a>). Interestingly, we identified the Low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) as a substrate of ADAM10 whose ectodomain shedding was almost completely abolished. Finally, our data revealed that ectodomain shedding of the GPI-anchored membrane-tethered matrix metalloprotease 4 (MT4MMP/MMP17) depends to a great extent on ADAM10 activity."

Hence, we used an antibody directed against the CDH6 cytoplasmic domain and thus detected CDH6 full-length protein and CDH6 C-terminal fragment (CTF) resulting from proteolytic cleavage in the cell lysate. Adam10 deletion strongly reduced CDH6 CTF formation with CDH6 full-length protein levels being unaltered (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, CDH6), indicating that ADAM10 is required for CDH6 proteolysis. In case of the Notch ligand Delta-Notch EGF receptor (DNER) we observed increased full-length protein levels in the cell lysate, which indicates that DNER is cleaved by ADAM10.

For other substrate candidates identified by SPECS no antibodies were available for validation by immunoblot. Thus, to be independent of antibodies we complemented our SPECS analysis of the secretome by a similar analysis of the levels of membrane proteins in the neuronal membrane, which may provide additional validation of more ADAM10 substrate candidates. An added value of this analysis is the opportunity to identify membrane proteins that are not direct ADAM10 substrates, but whose protein levels are instead indirectly changed. For example, it is conceivable that an ADAM10 substrate is part of a protein complex. Hence, its increased full-length protein levels upon ADAM10 deficiency might indirectly stabilize the other complex partner, such as ion channels or neurotransmitter receptors."

Instead of collecting the supernatant, labeled cells were then reacted with the biotinylated alkyne in order to label the cellular glycoproteins carrying the modified sugar (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Because sialic acid \u2013 to which ManNAz is converted - occurs as a terminal glycan modification in the Golgi, our approach is not expected to label all cellular glycoproteins, but only mature glycoproteins within the Golgi and beyond, including the plasma membrane. As the biotin-reagent is membrane-permeable, SPECS is expected to label glycoproteins not only at the plasma membrane, but also in membranes of the secretory and endocytic pathway. Using SPECS for labeling primary murine neurons, we identified 432 glycoproteins of which 37 were significantly changed upon Adam10 deletion considering a p-value of less than 0.05 based on 4 biological replicates (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B, C</a>, <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2</a> \u2013 A10 knockout surfaceome dataset). Applying multiple hypothesis testing none of the hits would remain significantly changed. However, we could confirm increased levels of APP, CNTN2 and L1CAM by Western blot (see below, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>) indicating that correction for multiple hypothesis testing was too strict. Of the 37 candidate proteins, 5 showed reduced levels, while 32 proteins had increased levels (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). 62% of the significantly changed proteins possessed a type-I topology (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>) while 22% were polytopic proteins (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). Among the significantly changed proteins we found previously known substrates like APP, L1CAM or CX3CL1 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>) (<a href=\"#bib33\">Lammich et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Kuhn et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Hundhausen et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Colombo et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Maretzky et al., 2005</a>). Furthermore, we found substrate candidates that we had already identified in the secretome of ADAM10 knockout neurons like ISLR2, CNTN2 or Neurexin 3 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B, C</a>). NRCAM which showed increased levels in neurons after ADAM10 knockout in immunoblots (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) was borderline significant in the surface analysis. The small overlap of only 13 proteins between significantly changed glycoproteins in the secretome and significantly changed glycoproteins in neurons upon ADAM10 knockout showed that ADAM10 cleavage regulated full-length protein levels only in a fraction of cases. Potentially, ADAM10 regulates substrate function by cleavage mainly at the cell surface without affecting total full-length substrate levels, which instead may be subject to lysosomal degradation."

We observed a mild but statistically significant accumulation in the full-length protein levels of the presynaptically localized Neurexin family member NRXN3 which matches the observed concomitant mild modulation of shedding in the secretome. On the contrary, full-length protein levels of postsynaptic Neurexin binding partners Neuroligin 1, 3 and 4 (NLGN-1/-3/-4) were not increased upon Adam10 deletion. Besides accumulation of full length protein levels of ADAM10 substrates, we additionally detected an accumulation of polytopic membrane proteins like the ionotropic glutamate receptor GLUR1 that plays a role in excitatory synaptic transmission and Reticulon-4 (RTN4) which has been implicated to play a role in axon outgrowth (<a href=\"#bib52\">Schmandke et al., 2014</a>). Furthermore, we detected membrane proteins, which accumulate in the cellular glycoproteome but were not detected in the secretome like LRRTM1 that has been implicated to play a role in modulating the synapse architecture (<a href=\"#bib54\">Soler-Llavina et al., 2013</a>). Hence, changes in shedding of a given protein do not necessarily result in accumulation of its precursor in the membrane and, conversely, accumulation of a given protein can also be caused indirectly."

This suggests a potential cross-talk between both proteases and raises the possibility of redundancy between ADAM10 and BACE1 for the cleavage of some of its substrates. To test this possibility, we used immunoblots and analyzed cellular full-length protein levels as well as ectodomain levels in response to BACE1 inhibition, Adam10 deletion or a combination of both (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). We investigated ectodomain cleavage and cellular levels of 11 substrates (CHL1, L1, CNTN2, NLGN1, NRCAM, LDLR, CDH2, MT4MMP, SEZ6, APP, NEO1), which we selected according to their quantitative reduction in ectodomain shedding in the current ADAM10 and the previous BACE1 SPECS study (<a href=\"#bib31\">Kuhn et al., 2012</a>). We selected substrates that were predominantly (NLGN1, NRCAM, MT4-MMP) or partially (CDH2, NEO1) cleaved by ADAM10 or that are predominantly cleaved (SEZ6) and partially cleaved by BACE1 (APP, CHL1, L1, CNTN2). Blotting for ADAM10 confirmed deletion of Adam10 upon lentivirus-mediated expression of Cre recombinase (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). This was further corroborated by abolishment of sAPP\u03b1 in ADAM10 deleted neurons. BACE1 inhibition was monitored with the abolishment of sAPP\u03b2 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A, B</a>) and led to a compensatory increase in sAPP\u03b1 which previously has been described (<a href=\"#bib7\">Colombo et al., 2013</a>)."

However, CDH2, NRCAM, NLGN1, MT4MMP, NEO1 and LDLR ectodomain levels were reduced and their full length protein levels in some cases increased exclusively upon Adam10 deletion while simultaneous BACE1 inhibition had no additional effect. In contrast to the L1 family member NRCAM, Adam10 deletion and BACE1 inhibition had an additive effect in the reduction of ectodomain cleavage and accumulation of full length protein levels for the members CHL1 and L1CAM in a similar fashion as for APP (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A, B</a>). This also held true for CNTN2. However, in case of APP the lack of BACE1 cleavage seems to be compensated by ADAM10, which does not appear to be the case for CHL1, L1CAM or CNTN2. In summary, the 11 investigated substrates can be subdivided into three classes, namely predominant ADAM10 substrates, predominant BACE1 substrates and substrates which are cleaved by ADAM10 and BACE1, demonstrating that there is a cross-talk between ADAM10 and BACE1 for some but not all substrates."

Due to technical limitations we were only able to analyze the membrane fraction of ADAM10 knockout brains. We observed a 50% reduction of total ADAM10 in the brain membrane fraction, which is in line with the excitatory neuron-specific CamkII-Cre driver line sparing GABAergic neurons and the fact that ADAM10 besides neurons is also expressed in glial cells. Similar to our in vitroexperiments with primary cortical neurons full-length levels of NLGN1 were not changed in brain membrane extracts. In contrast to NLGN1, we observed a clear increase of full-length protein levels for NEO1, NRCAM, CHL1 and MT4-MMP (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>) similar to what we had observed previously in neuronal lysates upon Adam10 deletion (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2A</a>,<a href=\"#fig4\">4A</a>).

To this end we crossed ADAM10-/- mice with sAPP\u03b1 knockin (sAPP\u03b1ki) mice that do no longer express APP-FL but solely the secreted APPs\u03b1 ectodomain due to a stop codon insertion into the mouse APP locus behind the \u03b1-secretase cleavage site (<a href=\"#bib49\">Ring et al., 2007</a>).

Studying ADAM10 substrates in primary cells or tissue has not been possible until the advent of conditional Adam10 knockout mice as constitutive Adam10 knockout mice die latest at embryonic day 9.5 (E9.5). These mice succumb to malformations like a retarded heart development, extracorporeal formation of blood vessels and improper formation of somites, which are considered to result from a lack in proteolytic processing of Notch by ADAM10 (<a href=\"#bib16\">Hartmann et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Jorissen et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Krebs et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Kageyama and Ohtsuka, 1999</a>). However, postnatal neuron-specific disruption of Adam10 in the brain leads to impaired learning, defects in long term potentiation and seizures which are considered to result from defects in synapse function and architecture and microglial and astrocytic activation (<a href=\"#bib44\">Prox et al., 2013</a>). These phenotypes point to an important postnatal function of ADAM10 via cleavage of additional substrates beyond Notch. So far, Notch and other ADAM10 substrates like N-Cadherin, fractalkine, Neuroligin-1 or E-Cadherin have already been described (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hundhausen et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Suzuki et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Reiss et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Maretzky et al., 2005</a>).

                        "text": "Here, we provide the first systematic analysis of ADAM10 substrates in primary cortical neurons of a conditional Adam10 knockout mouse. Applying SPECS to enrich newly synthesized glycoproteins from conditioned media and the cell surface of primary neurons we identified more than 300 glycoproteins in the secretome, which is slightly more than in our previous study identifying BACE1 substrates in neurons (<a href=\"#bib31\">Kuhn et al., 2012</a>). Additionally, we identified and quantified more than 400 membrane glycoproteins on or close to the cell surface of neurons which is 10 times more membrane proteins than in a previous study where cell surface biotinylation was used, but without the SPECS labeling (<a href=\"#bib51\">Sanz et al., 2015</a>). This demonstrates the power of the metabolic SPECS labeling to an in-depth quantification of the neuronal membrane proteome. Our analysis revealed that almost 50% of all membrane proteins released into the secretome are reduced upon Adam10 deletion of which 70% possess a type-I topology. Furthermore, we found that 13 secreted proteins like clusterin were reduced. Because ADAM10 cleaves membrane-bound substrates, the reduced clusterin levels are likely to be the consequence of secondary effects such as an increased internalization due to stabilization of its surface receptor in ADAM10-deficient neurons. The large number of substrates makes ADAM10 a major sheddase in the nervous system and an important modifier of the neuronal secretome. Among the candidate ADAM10 substrates in the secretome we could identify whole protein families having roles in synapse function and architecture. Their reduced cleavage upon Adam10 deletion fits to the phenotypes described in neuron-specific conditional Adam10 knockout mice, including defects in long term potentiation and seizures (<a href=\"#bib44\">Prox et al., 2013</a>). For example, Neurexins and Neuroligins are known to form trans-synaptic complexes which are especially necessary for synapse function (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>) (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bang and Owczarek, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">S\u00fcdhof, 2008</a>). Adam10 ablation caused a strong reduction in ectodomain shedding of postsynaptic NLGN1, 3 and slightly less pronounced for NLGN4. Hence, shedding of Neuroligins might negatively regulate their synaptic function (<a href=\"#bib55\">Suzuki et al., 2012</a>). Surprisingly, NLGN2 shedding was not affected by Adam10 deletion, which might be explained by the distinct roles played by these proteins. In fact, NLGN1 and 3 contribute to the function of excitatory, glutamatergic synapses while NLGN2 contributes to the function of inhibitory, GABAergic synapses (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kang et al., 2014</a>) suggesting that ADAM10 might preferably be involved in the modulation of glutamatergic, excitatory but not GABAergic inhibitory synapse functions. This is additionally supported by the fact that the ionotropic glutamate receptor GLUR1 (Gria1), previously described to be modulated by synaptic NLGN1 levels (<a href=\"#bib64\">Wittenmayer et al., 2009</a>), was increased in the cellular glycoproteome upon Adam10 deletion while GABA receptors which are known to interact with NLGN2 were not increased (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kang et al., 2014</a>). Besides the reduction of NLGN1, 3 and 4 shedding, Adam10 deletion resulted in a concomitant shedding reduction of the NLGN receptors NRXN 2 and 3 while the full length NRXN precursors mildly accumulated in the cellular glycoproteome. We additionally observed reduced ectodomain shedding for almost all members of the receptor tyrosine phosphatase family (PTPR) and the Slit and receptor tyrosine kinase domain (SLITRK) family which both play roles in synapse function and formation (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>) (<a href=\"#bib60\">Um et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Yim et al., 2013</a>). Specific members of both families like for example PTPRD and SLITRK3 have been shown to interact with each other transsynaptically (<a href=\"#bib60\">Um et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Takahashi et al., 2012</a>). While SLITRK1, 2, 4 and 5 and PTPRS have been implicated in the formation of excitatory synapses, SLITRK3 and PTPRD seem to be involved in the formation of inhibitory synapses (<a href=\"#bib66\">Yim et al., 2013</a>)."

While for L1 differential functional outcomes of ADAM10 and BACE1 cleavage have not been investigated so far, it recently has been shown that CHL1 cleavage by BACE1 is indispensible for Semaphorin 3a induced axon repulsion while inhibition of metalloprotease mediated CHL1 cleavage had no impact which suggests that modulation of axon growth in the axonal or presynaptic compartment via CHL1 is only modulated by BACE1 (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bar\u00e3o et al., 2015</a>). Interestingly, as shown here for conditional ADAM10 knockout CamKII-Cre mice, misplaced hippocampal mossy fiber terminals were also observed in CHL1- or NCAM-deficient (<a href=\"#bib7\">Colombo et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Yasuda et al., 2007</a>) but also in BACE1-deficient mice (<a href=\"#bib19\">Hitt et al., 2012</a>). Likewise, CHL1-, NrCAM-, BACE1-, or ADAM10-deficiency all result in mistargeted axons in olfactory glomeruli (<a href=\"#bib38\">Montag-Sallaz et al., 2002</a>), which may indicate functions for the refinement of connectivity (<a href=\"#bib38\">Montag-Sallaz et al., 2002</a>). Nevertheless, other identified substrates, such as neogenin (NEO1) and contactin-2 (CNTN2) may also contribute (<a href=\"#bib11\">Denaxa et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Braisted et al., 2000</a>), which makes a substrate phenotype correlation difficult."

One important chemokine expressed by neurons is fractalkine (CX3CL1) which has previously been proposed to be cleaved by ADAM10 and ADAM17 (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hundhausen et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Garton et al., 2001</a>). Abolished constitutive shedding of CX3CL1 and increased CX3CL1 full length protein levels in neurons upon knockout of ADAM10 demonstrate that ADAM10 regulates CX3CL1 levels in neurons (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). The biological role of ADAM10 cleaved soluble CX3CL1 might be a reduction of microglial activation leading to neuroprotection. This is supported by the finding that microglial activation and neuronal cell death in the substantia nigra upon MPTP treatment are increased in a CX3CL1 knockout mouse model and can be rescued by soluble but not membrane bound CX3CL1 suggesting a neuroprotective role of soluble CX3CL1 (<a href=\"#bib59\">Ueno et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Nash et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Morganti et al., 2012</a>)."

MT4MMP is assumed to mostly cleave soluble proteins in the extracellular matrix (<a href=\"#bib21\">Itoh, 2015</a>).

Additionally, while we identified ADAM10 substrates in neurons, ADAM10 is also expressed in astrocytes and oligodendrocytes and certain proteins are expressed at later developmental stages than what we have investigated (<a href=\"#bib50\">Sakry et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Ludwig et al., 2005</a>).

In brief, 40 million neurons were plated. After two div, neurons were infected with concentrated lentiviruses coding for iCre or Control. After five div neurobasal medium was exchanged for neurobasal medium supplemented with 200 nM tetraacetyl-N-azidoacetyl mannosamine (ManNAZ). Two days conditioned media were subsequently collected and filtered through 0.45 \u00b5m PVDF Millex\u00a0filter (Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany) into a VivaSpin 20 centrifugal concentrator (30\u2009kDa) at 4\u00b0C. VivaSpin 20 columns were centrifuged at 4600 rpm at 4\u00b0C to remove non-metabolized ManNAZ. The retentate was filled with 20 ml H2O. This procedure was repeated three times. In the last step, the ddH2O refill step was omitted. Instead, 100 nM of DBCO-PEG12-biotin (Click\u00a0Chemistry Tools, Scottsdale, AZ) diluted in 1 ml ddH2O was added to biotinylate metabolically azide-labelled glycoproteins. Centrifugal concentrators were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. For removal of non-reacted DBCO-PEG12-Biotin, VivaSpin20 centrifugal concentrators were subjected to three times of centrifugation with subsequent ddH2O refill. After the last centrifugation step, the retentate was diluted in 5 ml PBS with 2% SDS (v/v) and 2 mM Tris 2-carboxyethyl-phosphine (TCEP). For purification of biotinylated proteins, the sample was loaded on a 10-ml polyprep column with a streptavidin bead bed formed of 300 \u00b5l streptavidin slurry. After binding of proteins, streptavidin beads were washed three times with 10 ml PBS supplemented with 1% SDS. To elute the biotinylated and azide-labelled glycoproteins, streptavidin beads were boiled with urea sample buffer containing 3 mM biotin to compete for the binding of biotinylated proteins."

Two missed cleavages were allowed. Peptide as well as protein false discovery rate was set to 1%. Mass accuracy was set to 20 ppm for the first search and 5 ppm for the main search. Quantification was performed between the respective control and ADAM10 knockout conditions on the basis of unique and razor peptides. Missing values were imputed in Perseus 1.5.16 following a standard distribution. p-values were calculated from log2 transformed relative intensity ratios of 5 biological replicates for the neuronal secretome and 4 biological replicates for the neuronal surface proteome with a heteroscedastic, two-sided student\u2019s t-test.

This manuscript will make an important contribution to our understanding of the role of ADAM10, one of the major sheddases, in the brain. The unbiased approach taken by Kuhn et al. is extremely valuable, since it not only highlights the breadth of the substrate repertoire of ADAM10 in the brain (which is not unexpected), but also identifies some of the top candidates, and addresses the very important concept of the relative contribution to different sheddases to the processing of individual substrates. Anyone studying the role of proteolysis in the context of an intact organism requires this information to take a more holistic and general approach towards understanding the role of proteases and of substrate processing in development and disease. This study sets the stage for further analysis of the role of ADAM10 various processes that are regulated by specific substrates in the brain, and provides a clear outline of how this can be accomplished in other cell types. As such, this timely study should be of significant interest to the readers of <i>eLife</i>."

Thus, we have carried out the suggested experiment, which is already published in one of our earlier papers (Kuhn et al. EMBO J 2010). We knocked-down ADAM10, which nearly completely abolished APP \u03b1-secretase cleavage. Using qRT-PCR we found that the expression of ADAM17 and ADAM9 was not increased in the absence of ADAM10. The neuronal cultures in the previous study and in our current study were identical. Thus, we feel that a compensatory upregulation of ADAM17 \u2013 which is the closest homolog to ADAM10 and another major sheddase \u2013 is not a relevant mechanism upon ADAM10 loss-of-function in our neuronal cultures. Hence, we included the sentence: Another important finding was that in contrast to other proteases like ADAM17 or ADAM9 (Kuhn et al., ADAM10 is the physiologically relevant, constitutive \u03b1-secretase of the amyloid precursor protein in primary neurons. The EMBO journal. 2010;29(17):3020-32), cellular levels of the GPI-anchored, neuronally expressed metalloprotease MT4MMP increased while MT4MMP ectodomain shedding was abolished upon Adam10 deletion (Rikimaru et al.

Given that ADAM10 is a membrane-bound sheddase all identified and verified substrates are membrane proteins. Thus, it is expectable that the secretion of only few soluble proteins would be changed in ADAM10-/- cells. And these proteins are not expected to be direct substrates of ADAM10, but to be changed as an indirect consequence of ADAM10-deletion. The number of soluble proteins identified in wild type and ADAM10 knockout mice was the same. However, few of these soluble proteins were quantitatively reduced in ADAM10 knockout mice most likely due to stabilization of their receptors at the neuronal membrane or due to their reduced expression."
