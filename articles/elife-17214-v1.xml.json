The regulation of leaf senescence is a complex process. However, the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. Here, we uncovered a novel and the pivotal role of <i>Arabidopsis</i> HDA9 (a RPD3-like histone deacetylase) in promoting the onset of leaf senescence. We found that HDA9 acts in complex with a SANT domain-containing protein POWERDRESS (PWR) and transcription factor WRKY53. Our genome-wide profiling of HDA9 occupancy reveals that HDA9 directly binds to the promoters of key negative regulators of senescence and this association requires PWR. Furthermore, we found that PWR is important for HDA9 nuclear accumulation. This study reveals an uncharacterized epigenetic complex involved in leaf senescence and provides mechanistic insights into how a histone deacetylase along with a chromatin-binding protein contribute to a robust regulatory network to modulate the onset of plant aging."

The regulation of leaf senescence is a complex process. However, the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. Here, we uncovered a novel and the pivotal role of <i>Arabidopsis</i> HDA9 (a RPD3-like histone deacetylase) in promoting the onset of leaf senescence. We found that HDA9 acts in complex with a SANT domain-containing protein POWERDRESS (PWR) and transcription factor WRKY53. Our genome-wide profiling of HDA9 occupancy reveals that HDA9 directly binds to the promoters of key negative regulators of senescence and this association requires PWR. Furthermore, we found that PWR is important for HDA9 nuclear accumulation. This study reveals an uncharacterized epigenetic complex involved in leaf senescence and provides mechanistic insights into how a histone deacetylase along with a chromatin-binding protein contribute to a robust regulatory network to modulate the onset of plant aging."

However, if leaves age and yellow too early, it can limit how much energy the plant can harvest from light. Thus, it is crucial for plants to know when they should start the leaf aging process.

As such, one of the ways that plants regulate the activity of their genes is by chemically modifying the DNA or histones to alter how tightly the DNA is packaged. For example, to switch particular genes off, enzymes known as histone deacetylases remove an acetyl group from their histones. However, it is not clear how these enzymes know which genes to modify and how this helps to make sure that leaf aging happens at the appropriate time."

Although efficient senescence is important to increase plant viability in the next generation, premature senescence often causes a decrease in the yield and quality of crops (<a href=\"#bib2\">Avila-Ospina et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Distelfeld et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Guo and Gan, 2014</a>). Thus, the\u00a0knowledge of mechanisms underlying leaf aging has profound implications in many biotechnological applications, including increasing plant productivity and preventing post-harvest loss during transportation and storage. Regulation of leaf senescence is a complex process controlled by developmental and environmental signaling pathways (<a href=\"#bib40\">Lim et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Woo et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Schippers, 2015</a>). Many senescence-associated genes (<i>SAGs</i>) and transcription factors have been identified (<a href=\"#bib15\">Gepstein et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Buchanan-Wollaston et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Breeze et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Guo and Gan, 2012</a>). However, their in vivo function in senescence remains largely unknown. For the relatively well-studied senescence-associated transcription factors, current knowledge of their function is mostly derived from knockout mutants, transgenic overexpressing plants, or identification of downstream target genes. Little is known how these transcription factors are regulated and function mechanistically in the global control of leaf senescence."

Genetic studies have revealed the\u00a0critical function of HDACs in crosstalk between plant genomes and the environment in plant responses to diverse stresses at the cellular and organismal levels (<a href=\"#bib37\">Krogan and Long 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Kim et al. 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Pikaard and Mittelsten Scheid, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Wang et al., 2014</a>).

Interplays between HDACs and other epigenetic modifications have also been documented.

For instance, early studies using an\u00a0antisense approach to knockdown histone deacetylases suggest a potential role of histone deacetylation in leaf senescence (<a href=\"#bib64\">Tian and Chen, 2001</a>). HDA6 is implicated in leaf senescence by downregulation of two <i>SAGs</i> in the loss-of-function mutants (<a href=\"#bib77\">Wu et al., 2008</a>).

Our genome-wide profiling of HDA9 occupancy reveals that HDA9 directly binds to the promoters of key negative regulators and this binding requires PWR. PWR physically interacts with HDA9 and loss-of-function <i>pwr</i> mutants phenocopy <i>hda9</i>, indicating that this complex is biologically relevant. Furthermore, we demonstrate that PWR is important for HDA9 nuclear accumulation as HDA9 protein level is significantly reduced in the nucleus in <i>pwr</i> mutants. Thus, we propose that PWR acts at multiple levels to regulate HDA9 function. To our knowledge, this is the first genome-wide study on targeting and regulating mechanism for a histone deacetylase in plants. Together, this study reveals an uncharacterized epigenetic complex involved in leaf senescence and provides mechanistic insights into how a histone deacetylase along with a chromatin-binding protein contribute to a robust regulatory network to promote the onset of plant aging."

To identify the in vivo binding pattern of HDA9, we determined the genomic occupancy of HDA9 using ChIP-seq in plants expressing HDA9-FLAG. The ChIP-seq was performed in parallel with WT. HDA9 is highly enriched in gene-rich euchromatic regions, but depleted in repeat-rich centromeric heterochromatin (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Further analysis identified a total of 9489 binding peaks (p=1e-03) corresponding to 8232 genes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 1A</a>). The majority of HDA9 binding peaks (6515 or approximately 69%) were located in promoter regions (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Similar observations were reported in a genome-wide profiling of mammalian HDACs (<a href=\"#bib74\">Wang et al., 2009</a>). We next examined the relationship between HDA9 binding and gene expression levels. We divided all 28,000 <i>Arabidopsis</i> genes equally into five groups based on their expression levels and correlated them with HDA9 binding. Surprisingly, we found that HDA9 is preferentially enriched in the promoters of active genes but not silent genes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). We also found that HDA9 bound genes showed significantly higher expression than the average expression levels of all genes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). To further examine the relationship between HDA9 and active genes, we correlated HDA9 binding with DNase I hypersensitive sites that are generally associated with accessible chromatin states (<a href=\"#bib83\">Zhang et al., 2012</a>). We found co-localization between HDA9 binding and DNase I hypersensitive sites in gene promoters (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>).

Although the expression of 30% of the <i>SAGs</i> (1023 out of 3474) increased in senescing leaves of both <i>hda9</i> and WT compared to the young leaves (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>), the fold change was significantly less in <i>hda9</i> compared to WT (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>).

These differentially expressed genes showed enrichment in senescence related pathways including jasmonic acid (JA) and ABA response (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). To further explore the biological significance of HDA9 binding, we examined the correlation between HDA9 binding and altered gene expression in <i>hda9</i>. We found 222 genes (~28%) were shown to be bound by HDA9 and significantly upregulated in <i>hda9</i> (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>, <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 1B</a>), suggesting that they are directly regulated by HDA9. Of the 222 genes, 151 (~68%) showed increased H3K27ac in <i>hda9</i>, indicating a positive correlation between gene upregulation and H3K27ac increase of HDA9 targets (p=1.2e-10) (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1F</a>). Interestingly, the majority of HDA9 bound genes did not show significant expression change in <i>hda9</i> (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D,E</a>). Similar observations are reported in human (<a href=\"#bib74\">Wang et al., 2009</a>) and maize (<a href=\"#bib78\">Yang et al., 2016</a>). It is possible that HDA9 is not a primary regulator of transcription at the majority of its targets. Another possibility is that other HDACs or chromatin/transcriptional repressors function together with HDA9 to regulate gene expression, and thus loss of HDA9 itself is insufficient to release the transcriptional repression of its targets. Given the function of HDA9 in leaf senescence, we sought to investigate whether HDA9 directly regulate genes involved in this process. By searching the 222 genes with HDA9 binding and upregulation in <i>hda9,</i> we found 11 genes with potential or known functions in senescence (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1G</a>), including catalase that protects cells from oxidative damage (CAT1) (<a href=\"#bib10\">Du et al., 2008</a>), autophagy proteins that delay senescence and programmed cell death (APG9, ATG2, ATG8E and ATG13) (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hanaoka et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Yoshimoto et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Suttangkakul et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Wang et al., 2011b</a>), proteins that negatively regulate ABA signaling pathway known to promote senescence (NPX1, PLL5, AFP2, AFP4) (<a href=\"#bib59\">Schweighofer et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Huang and Wu, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Garcia et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Kim et al., 2009b</a>), BIK1 that negatively regulates the salicylic acid (SA) signaling pathway (<a href=\"#bib70\">Veronese et al., 2006</a>), and WRKY57 (a WRKY family transcription factor) acts as a negative regulator of JA to prevent leaf senescence (<a href=\"#bib27\">Jiang et al., 2014</a>)."

In this study, we found that many ABA-responsive genes were downregulated in <i>hda9</i> (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>), indicating that the ABA signaling pathway is impaired in <i>hda9</i> during leaf senescence. This is consistent with a previous study showing insensitivity to ABA-mediated seed dormancy and germination inhibition in <i>hda9</i> (<a href=\"#bib68\">van Zanten et al., 2014</a>). ABA is known to promote leaf senescence (<a href=\"#bib28\">Jibran et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Khan et al., 2014</a>) and loss-of-function of the ABA receptor PYL8 or PYL9 causes delayed leaf senescence (<a href=\"#bib38\">Lee et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib84\">Zhao et al., 2016</a>). Our ChIP-seq and RNA-seq analyses reveal that neither PYL8 nor PYL9 is a primary target of HDA9. Instead, we found that HDA9 directly binds and represses two negative regulators of the ABA signaling pathway, <i>NPX1</i> and <i>AFP4/TMAC2</i> (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 1B</a>). NPX1 and AFP4/TMAC2 are proposed to act as negative regulators in ABA signaling because their overexpression reduces plant sensitivity to ABA (<a href=\"#bib23\">Huang and Wu, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Kim et al., 2009b</a>). Based on these findings, we propose that HDA9 promotes leaf senescence in part by repressing the negative regulators of the ABA signaling pathway (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). Besides ABA, one negative regulator of the JA pathway, WRKY57, is also shown to be a direct target of HDA9 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figures\u00a05</a> and <a href=\"#fig6\">6</a>, <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 1B</a>). WRKY57 is a transcription factor that represses JA-induced leaf senescence (<a href=\"#bib27\">Jiang et al., 2014</a>), suggesting that HDA9 may also regulate leaf senescence through the JA signaling pathway. Autophagy is an intracellular process for protein degradation and is associated with leaf longevity (<a href=\"#bib2\">Avila-Ospina et al., 2014</a>). APG9 is an essential component of the plant autophagy pathway and <i>apg9</i> mutants display early leaf senescence (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hanaoka et al., 2002</a>). Consistently, we found <i>APG9</i> and several other autophagy genes (<i>ATG8E</i>, <i>ATG2</i> and <i>ATG13</i>) are directly targeted and repressed by HDA9 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figures\u00a05</a> and <a href=\"#fig6\">6</a>, <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 1B</a>)."

Our RNA-seq analysis also revealed a significant increase of <i>CAT1</i> expression in <i>hda9</i> (<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 5\u2014source data 1B</a>), suggesting that HDA9 represses <i>CAT1</i> to allow the accumulation of oxidation during leaf senescence.

The positive correlation between HDA9 bound regions and DNase I hypersensitive sites also supports this observation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Different from the mammalian and maize studies, we found only a very small fraction of HDA9-enriched genes are silent genes (~5%) (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Remarkably, none of the 222 HDA9-bound genes that were upregulated in <i>hda9</i> are inactive genes (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). The precise mechanism why HDA9 binds to the promoters of actively expressed genes is unclear. One explanation could be that HDA9 may be recruited to the promoters of active genes to prevent promiscuous cryptic transcription. Another possibility is that HDA9 may compete with more active HDAs for binding to the similar genomic regions. It is also unclear why silent genes are not the preferred targets of HDA9. One possibility is that silent genes in <i>Arabidopsis</i> tend to have high promoter DNA methylation and thus may be repressed by DNA methylation (unpublished data). Another difference is that our HDA9 affinity purification and MS analysis failed to detect Pol II subunits, which were reported to associate with HDAC in mammals (<a href=\"#bib74\">Wang et al., 2009</a>)."

Supporting the relevance of HDA9-WRKY53 interaction, we found that HDA9 binding peaks are significantly enriched for WRKY binding motifs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>).

Although the mechanism is unclear, several possibilities could account for this pattern. First, the ultimate gene expression level is determined by the combined actions of multiple redundant repressors or activators, exemplified by yeast Rpd3 and chromatin remodeling enzyme Isw2 (<a href=\"#bib13\">Fazzio et al., 2001</a>). It is possible that other HDACs (e.g. HDA6 and HDA19) or transcriptional repressors function redundantly with HDA9 to regulate gene expression, and thus loss of HDA9 itself is insufficient to release the transcriptional repression of its targets. This may also provide an explanation for the low number of mis-regulated genes in <i>hda6</i> (<a href=\"#bib65\">To et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Blevins et al., 2014</a>). In support of this notion, loss-of-function <i>hda6</i> mutations induce delayed leaf senescence and repress the expression of <i>SAG12</i> and <i>SEN4</i> (<a href=\"#bib77\">Wu et al., 2008</a>). The molecular basis of HDA6 in leaf senescence is unclear. It will be interesting to explore the precise relationship between HDA9 with HDA6 in targeting and regulating gene expression in leaf senescence as well as other biological processes. Second, our GO analysis reveals that HDA9-bound genes that have no significant change in RNA transcripts in <i>hda9</i> are enriched for various developmental processes and environmental responses (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). It is possible that the association of HDA9 with the promoters of these developmental genes can rapidly induce the repression of their expression in response to certain internal and/or external signals. Indeed, many photosynthesis-related genes are reported to be upregulated in <i>hda9</i> seeds during imbibition (<a href=\"#bib68\">van Zanten et al., 2014</a>). Third, HDA9 may act to regulate chromatin structure rather than acting through transcriptional regulation. We found that HDA9 binds 177 chromatin factors, including SWI/SNF chromatin remodelers, ATP-dependent helicases, methyl DNA binding proteins, Tudor/PWWP/MBT superfamily proteins, and WD-40 proteins (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 1C</a>). Fourth, HDA9 may be recruited to the promoters of active genes to prevent promiscuous cryptic transcription as suggested by mammalian and maize studies (<a href=\"#bib74\">Wang et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Yang et al., 2016</a>). Finally, some of the HDA9 enriched loci may not be its <i>bona fide</i> targets. Further experiments will be required to determine the precise function and mechanism of HDA9 in the regulation of its target genes."

                                "text": "Our results suggest that HDA9, PWR and the WRKY53 transcription factor form a previously unknown complex that promotes leaf senescence. This complex may be analogous to HDAC3-SMRT/N-CoR repressor complex in animals. Although the function of HDAC3-SMRT/N-CoR in various cellular processes (e.g. development, differentiation, and diseases) has been well studied (<a href=\"#bib30\">Karagianni and Wong, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Shahbazian and Grunstein, 2007</a>), its role in cellular senescence and aging remains unclear in mammals. Our ChIP assay showed that PWR and HDA9 are enriched at the same loci, and HDA9 binding to these loci requires PWR in vivo (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,D</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure\u00a06\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). This is consistent with the role of SMRT/N-CoR in targeting HDAC3 to chromatin (<a href=\"#bib18\">Guenther et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Karagianni and Wong, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">You et al., 2013</a>). SMRT/N-CoR has an additional function in stimulating HDAC3 deacetylase activity in vitro (<a href=\"#bib17\">Guenther et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Watson et al., 2012</a>). Despite extensive testing, we have been unable to find in vitro conditions that allow the\u00a0robust HDA9 deacetylase activity. Thus, it remains to be determined whether PWR promotes HDA9 catalytic activity. On the other hand, we discovered a potential role of PWR in HDA9 nuclear localization (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). Contrast to a previous study showing that HDA9 predominantly localized in the nucleus (<a href=\"#bib29\">Kang et al., 2015</a>), we found a significant fraction of HDA9 protein is present in the cytoplasm (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). Such difference in observation may be due to the fact that mature leaves were examined in our experiment whereas the 10-day-old seedlings were used in the previous study. It will be interesting to examine whether HDA9 localizes differently in the cell during the different developmental stages."

We wonder whether the induction of senescence by PWR also partially depends on miRNA pathways. Although we cannot completely rule out this possibility, several lines of evidence suggest it is less likely. First, the expression of miRNA genes reported in (<a href=\"#bib81\">Yumul et al., 2013</a>) is not affected in <i>hda9</i> mutants according to our RNA-seq analysis (<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 5\u2014source data 1</a>). Second, <i>hda9 pwr</i> double mutant shows no further delay in leaf senescence than any of the <i>hda9</i> or <i>pwr</i> single mutants, suggesting that PWR and HDA9 act through the same pathway in promoting leaf senescence. Additionally, senescence-related genes regulated by HDA9 and PWR are largely the same group of genes (<a href=\"#SD5-data\">Figure 5\u2014source data 3</a>).

Masses for both precursor and fragment ions were treated as mono-isotopic. Oxidized methionine (+15.995 Da) and the gly-gly footprint on lysine (+114.043 Da) were allowed as dynamic modifications and carbamidomethylated cysteine (+57.021 Da) was searched as a static modification. The database search permitted for up to two missed trypsin cleavages and ion masses were matched with a mass tolerance of 10 ppm for precursor masses and 0.1 Da for HCD fragments. The output from the SEQUEST search algorithm was validated using the Percolator algorithm.

However, none of these four genes are actually in the 277 gene list. I found <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> in particular very misleading in this regard. This begs the question what the purpose of the genomic datasets presented is \u2013 if in the end known candidate genes are studied. In addition, when I checked which of the 277 genes upregulated in both <i>hda9</i> and <i><span class=\"underline\">pwr</span></i> are direct HDA9 targets, I found that only roughly one third are (91 genes). Given that HDA9 binds 8000/24000 loci, the 277 gene list is thus not enriched in HDA9-bound genes. Likewise, the genes upregulated in <i>hda9</i> mutants are not enriched in HDA9 bound loci."

Surprisingly the authors find that \u2013genome-wide \u2013 HDA9 binds to actively expressed genes, most of which are not differentially expressed in <i>hda9</i> mutants. While the latter can be attributed to redundantly acting HDACs, this nevertheless raises the question why HDA9 is present at active loci. Of note, the authors also report a global reduction in two active marks H3K9ac and H3K27ac in <i>hda9</i> mutants on Westerns. One explanation could be that HDA9 resides at genomic loci in an inactive, latent form that needs to be activated or unblocked to have enzymatic activity. Another possibility is that HDA9 binding may prevent binding of other, more active HDAs, to these loci. In either case, one would expect high levels of H3K9ac or H3K27ac at the HDA9 bound highly expressed loci. This should be tested- either genome-wide or at select HDA9 targets in this category. If indeed H3K9ac and H3K27ac levels are high at HDA9-bound loci, HDA9 binding is not directly linked to altered transcriptional output. A complementary approach, monitoring changes in histone acetylation levels genome-wide in <i>hda9</i> and <i>pwr</i> mutants relative to the WT, might also help to understand the role of HDA9 in gene regulation."

I think that it is most likely that gene expressions are regulated and repressed by multiple redundant or parallel repressors and eliminating one of them is usually not enough to derepress and activate transcription.

In <i>hda9</i> and <i>pwr</i> mutants there is perhaps a stronger increase in H3K27ac at HDA9 bound loci than at nonbound loci. Is that true? This could be tested statistically. One remaining question is how do the changes in H3K27ac in the mutant compared to the wild type link to the changes in gene expression in the same genetic backgrounds?

We chose specific genes for further studies when they fulfilled all three of the following criteria: a) they are bound by HDA9 by ChIP-seq (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 1</a>); b) they are significantly upregulated in <i>hda9</i> by RNA-seq (<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 5\u2014source data 1</a>); and c) their roles in leaf senescence. Thus, our molecular analysis would be on HDA9 directly bound targets that had a transcriptional response in the senescence phenotype. Using these three criteria, we narrowed down to 11 genes and focused on four genes (<i>WRKY57</i>, <i>APG9, CAT1, NPX1</i>) for further investigation. We have now presented this selection strategy as a new <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1F</a> for clarity.

Of note, the authors also report a global reduction in two active marks H3K9ac and H3K27ac in hda9 mutants on Westerns. One explanation could be that HDA9 resides at genomic loci in an inactive, latent form that needs to be activated or unblocked to have enzymatic activity. Another possibility is that HDA9 binding may prevent binding of other, more active HDAs, to these loci. In either case, one would expect high levels of H3K9ac or H3K27ac at the HDA9 bound highly expressed loci. This should be tested- either genome-wide or at select HDA9 targets in this category. If indeed H3K9ac and H3K27ac levels are high at HDA9-bound loci, HDA9 binding is not directly linked to altered transcriptional output. A complementary approach, monitoring changes in histone acetylation levels genome-wide in hda9 and pwr mutants relative to the WT, might also help to understand the role of HDA9 in gene regulation.</i>"
