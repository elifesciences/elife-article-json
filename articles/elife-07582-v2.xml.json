However, it remains unknown whether a given sensory memory trace is being maintained as a unitary item to associate. Here, we used conditioned taste aversion learning in the rat model, wherein animals associate a novel taste with visceral nausea, and demonstrate that there are two parallel memory traces of a novel taste: a short-duration robust trace, lasting approximately 3\u2009hr, and a parallel long-duration weak one, lasting up to 8\u2009hr, and dependent on the strong trace for its formation. Moreover, only the early robust trace is maintained by a NMDAR-dependent CaMKII- AMPAR pathway in the insular cortex. These findings suggest that a memory trace undergoes rapid modifications, and that the mechanisms underlying trace associative learning differ when items in the memory are experienced at different time points."

The weaker, longer-lasting memory trace only forms if the shorter, stronger trace also occurs."

Upper panel depicts the experimental design. (<b>B</b>) Rats demonstrated high aversion to a novel palatable taste upon sampling for the first time. This is referred to as neophobia, i.e., reluctance to consume a novel taste due to lack of knowledge regarding the post-ingestive consequences. However, rats exhibited less aversion upon the second and third encounter, demonstrating that taste preference is an adaptive process. This phenomenon is called attenuation of neophobia. Each line represents a rat and a dotted line is a mean of the group (one way ANOVA; F (1.427, 14.273) = 27.925, p=0.00003.

The long-trace CTAs were not different from an unpaired control group by extinction day4, in comparison with day7 aversion index (AI) in short-trace CTAs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a> and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>). Reverse conditioning did not lead to taste aversion (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>), which indicates the importance of temporal order between taste and nausea in CTA learning. The strength of an association can be affected by ITI between CS and US or by the strength of US. We thus conducted an ITI-CTA with a weak US (0.025M LiCl) to test whether weaker CTA learning can be acquired when an association is made during the short- (1\u20133\u2009hr) but not the long-trace (4\u20138\u2009hr) intervals. We found that CTA was formed following the short-trace intervals, and interestingly, also following a 4\u2009hr but not 5\u2009hr trace interval. Together these results suggest that there is a shift in the associability of the taste memory trace at around 3\u20134\u2009hr after exposure to the taste stimulus (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>)."

This observation is further supported by the previous demonstration that micro-injection of the protein synthesis inhibitor, anisomycin, into the insular cortex (IC) within 3\u2009hr but not 4\u2009hr after the taste inhibits associative taste memory in the latent inhibition of CTA paradigm (<a href=\"#bib29\">Merhav and Rosenblum, 2008</a>).

Moreover, we were encouraged by the previous report that showed that novel taste consumption increases CaMKII\u03b1 expression in the IC (<a href=\"#bib3\">Belelovsky et al., 2005</a>). Therefore, we followed up this finding and expanded it by measuring the phosphorylation/expression levels of CaMKII\u03b1 in the IC for up to 8\u2009hr after the consumption of novel taste. We subjected IC samples of rats exposed to either water or novel taste solution (0.1% saccharin) to biochemical fractionation (<a href=\"#bib42\">Stern et al., 2013</a>), and examined the phosphorylation and expression levels of CaMKII\u03b1 in the crude synaptosomal fraction (P2-fraction) by Western-blotting analysis (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A\u2013C</a> and Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1). We replicated the finding from the previous report (Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2), that 15\u00a0min after novel taste consumption, CaMKII\u03b1 expression is increased in the IC. Interestingly, we observed that the T286 phosphorylation of CaMKII\u03b1 (pT286CaMKII\u03b1) was increased in the P2-fraction 30\u00a0min following novel taste consumption, persisting for up to 3\u2009hr (1 and 3\u2009hr), but not 5 or 8\u2009hr afterwards (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D,E</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>,<a href=\"#fig2s2\">2</a>)."

Therefore, we examined if NMDAR activation is necessary for novel taste-dependent CaMKII\u03b1 activation. Indeed, novel taste experience-induced phosphorylation of T286CaMKII\u03b1 is NMDAR-dependent, since i.p. injection of the NMDAR antagonist, MK801 (0.2\u00a0mg/kg b.w), 30\u00a0min before novel taste learning precluded phosphorylation of T286CaMKII\u03b1 in the IC (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H,I</a> and Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3). pT305CaMKII\u03b1 and total CaMKII\u03b1 levels did not differ among the water group injected with saline and the novel taste groups injected with either saline or MK801 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2J,K</a> and Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3)."

Therefore, the correlation between the consumption of novel taste and NMDAR-dependent T286CaMKII\u03b1 phosphorylation can serve the taste memory trace for an association, and/or incidental taste memory. In order to dissociate between these possibilities, we investigated the role of NMDAR and CaMKII\u03b1 in non-associative incidental and associative CTA learning by micro-infusing the NMDAR antagonist APV (10\u00a0\u03bcg/1\u00a0\u03bcl/hemisphere) or CaMKII\u03b1 inhibitor TatCN21 (0.3\u00a0nM/1\u00a0\u03bcl/ hemisphere (<a href=\"#bib6\">Buard et al., 2010</a>)) bilaterally into the IC. Consistent with the literature, our data reveal that NDMAR in the IC is dispensable for incidental taste learning but necessary for CTA learning (Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1) (<a href=\"#bib37\">Rosenblum et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Barki-Harrington et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Parkes et al., 2014</a>).

We micro-injected the NMDAR antagonist into the IC 25\u2009min from the beginning of the taste consumption in 1\u2009hr ITI-CTA conditioning with a weak US and observed an attenuated CTA memory, consistent with a previous report in which a strong US was administered (<a href=\"#bib37\">Rosenblum et al., 1997</a>; but also see <a href=\"#bib11\">Ferreira et al., 2002</a>)\u00a0(Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3A). Intriguingly, we did not observe any effect when we made a similar manipulation in the IC 4\u2009hr after the taste consumption in 5\u2009hr ITI-CTA conditioning with a strong US (Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3B; all the remaining experiments were done with a strong US).

If this is the case, then inhibiting CaMKII 2\u2009hr after novel taste consumption in 3\u2009hr ITI-CTA should still impede the CS-US association. To answer this, we performed a 3\u2009hr ITI-CTA experiment in which we micro-infused CaMKII\u03b1 inhibitor TatCN21 2\u2009hr after the taste consumption, and administered the LiCl 1\u2009hr later. We observed a small non-significant effect (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>).

However, when it encounters nausea, it forms an associative aversive taste memory (CTA). The strength of the CS or the US or the time lapse between the two or other sensory cues at the time of learning can affect the formation of the internal representation. Here, we focused on the variable of ITI between the CS and US. (<b>B</b>) In the present model we aim to explain the temporal constraints and biological mechanisms underlying trace-CTA. Using sodium saccharin as CS and 0.14M LiCl as strong US we found that the novel taste memory trace is generated after the consumption of novel taste, and lasts for approximately 8\u2009hr to associate with its outcome. The associability of the taste memory trace changes at around 4\u2009hr after the novel taste consumption with the US. Taken together, the behavioral readout with different ITIs and pharmacological manipulations of the NMDAR-CaMKII\u03b1-GluA1 axis in the IC using different ITI-CTA training, we reason that there are two parallel taste memory traces with different underlying mechanisms: one that is robust but decays quickly (strong-trace; solid blue line) and the second trace, which is weak but lasts longer (weak-trace; dashed blue line). X-axis depicts the time in hours between the taste and malaise. Y-axis indicates the strength of the associable taste memory trace. It is possible that the weak taste-memory trace is parallel to that of the strong taste-memory trace or independent of the strong trace. Given our findings that different pharmacological manipulations in the insular cortex (APV, TatCN21, CNQX) affect the associability of the taste-memory trace when applied only during the strong-trace timescale but not in the weak taste-memory trace timescale (longer than 3\u2009hr), we suggest that the weak-taste memory trace is parallel to that of the strong one. (<b>C</b>) Finally, we add the dimension of additional information registered during the association phase by additional brain areas. We propose a multiple memory systems/trace theory, which posits that CTA learning may engage multiple memory systems to take part in the long-trace associative process and that after experiencing the taste, the NMDA receptor-dependent CaMKII\u03b1 and GluA1 pathway in the insular cortex plays a critical role only during the short-trace, whereas NMDA receptors in the hippocampus play a crucial role as the time increases (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chinnakkaruppan et al., 2014</a>), for the association with the US. Note that the background information/experience exists right from the CS stimulus experience but arguably they accumulate more with time."

TatCN21 application reduced novel taste experience-dependent GluA1 expression in the P2-fraction (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a> and Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2).

It is also noteworthy that several previous reports demonstrate that pharmacological perturbations in the IC during CTA conditioning only partially disrupt CTA memory, and that the disrupted CTA appears similar to long-trace CTA memory (<a href=\"#bib38\">Rosenblum et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Rosenblum et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Berman et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Eisenberg et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Guti\u00e9rrez et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Barki-Harrington et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Inberg et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Stern et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Parkes et al., 2014</a>).

First, in support of the learned safety theory, and in line with the previous reports, we found that animals exhibit higher preference to the taste hours following the first-time experience (Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 4) (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kalat and Rozin, 1973</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Guti\u00e9rrez et al., 2003</a>). Second, with regards to background interference theory, we propose that the multi-channeled background information can be viewed as episodic components and that, for example, the hippocampus is critical to assimilate the episodic component in CTA (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chinnakkaruppan et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Koh et al., 2009</a>). Third, in line with the trace decay theory, our findings demonstrate that the robust short-trace fades within 3\u2009hr in the IC but the long-trace, which is weak, lasts longer. Moreover, the non-linear decay of the short trace suggests that it dominates over the long trace, so that and when the former fades, the latter is revealed (Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 5). We propose a multiple memory trace theory, wherein we suggest that CTA learning may engage multiple memory systems to take part in the long-trace associative process and that after experiencing the taste, the IC plays a critical role during short-trace (Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 5)."

For instance, protein acetylation, phosphorylation, and induction of proteins were observed in the IC many hours following novel taste consumption, and it is possible that these correlative molecular changes (proteins synthesis and epigenetic regulation) may contribute to the long-trace CTA (<a href=\"#bib43\">Swank and Sweatt, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Yefet et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Elkobi et al., 2008</a>; for reviews see <a href=\"#bib13\">Gal-Ben-Ari and Rosenblum, 2012</a>)."

On the other hand, the long-trace CTA challenges this assumption, and it is possible that because of the multi-channeled background information with an increasing time interval as discussed above, homeostatic plasticity may play a crucial role to encode multiple memory traces via coordinating several brain structures such as the IC, amygdala, hippocampus, prefrontal cortices in the long-trace CTA (<a href=\"#bib47\">Vitureira et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Turrigiano, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Pozo and Goda, 2010</a>).

They were sacrificed 0.25, 0.5, 1, 3, 5, or 8\u2009hr later. Brains were quickly excised and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and transferred to -80\u00b0C. Insular cortex was extracted from cryostat sections at -20\u00b0C. Sub-cellular fractionation was performed according to (<a href=\"#bib42\">Stern et al., 2013</a>). Briefly, brain tissues were homogenized (H) in ice-cold homogenization buffer (10\u00a0mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1\u00a0mM EDTA, 1\u00a0mM EGTA, 320\u00a0mM sucrose (all from Sigma-Aldrich,\u00a0Rehovot, Israel), 1X protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma-Aldrich Rehovot,\u00a0Israel\u00a0or Thermo Scientific,\u00a0Rockford,\u00a0USA); and 1X phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Sigma-Aldrich or Thermo Scientific). The homogenates were sonicated, kept on ice for 20\u00a0min and then centrifuged at 1000\u00a0g for 8\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C to isolate nuclei and large debris (P1). The supernatant (S1) was centrifuged at 12,000\u00a0g for 30\u00a0min at 4\u00b0C in a conventional Eppendorf centrifuge to obtain a crude synaptosomal fraction (P2), and subsequently lysed hypo-osmotically (7\u00a0mM HEPES buffer, pH 7.5) and centrifuged at 25,000\u00a0g in a Beckman Coulter ultracentrifuge at 4\u00b0C for 23\u00a0min, to pellet a synaptosomal membrane fraction (LP1). The resulting supernatant (LS1) was centrifuged at 165,000\u00a0g for 2\u2009hr at 4\u00b0C to obtain a synaptic vesicle enriched fraction (LP2). The supernatant (S2) obtained from the fraction P2 was centrifuged at 165,000\u00a0g for 2\u2009hr to obtain a cytosolic fraction (S3) and a light membrane fraction (pellet; P3).

After transfer to a 0.2\u00a0\u03bcm pore size nitrocellulose membrane, the blots were blocked with 4% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in tris-buffered saline plus 0.5% tween-20 (TBST) at room temperature for 1\u2009hr. They were then incubated overnight with the suitable primary antibodies: CaMKII\u03b1 (1:25,000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, SCBT), pT286CaMKII\u03b1 (1:1000; SCBT), pT305CaMKII\u03b1 (1:1000; Novus biological), GluN2B (1:1000; SCBT), GluA1 (1:1000; Abcam or SCBT), pS831GluA1 (1:5000; Epitomics), PSD-95 (1:1000; SCBT), HMGB1 (1:10,000; Abcam), eIF2\u03b1 (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology), pY1472GluN2B (1:1000; a gift from Prof. Nakazawa), pS1303GluN2B (1:10,000; Abcam), \u03b2-actin (1:3000; SCBT) and \u03b2-tubulin (1:30,000; Sigma). The blots were then subjected to three 5\u00a0min washing steps in TBST, after which they were incubated with the corresponding HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies: goat anti-rabbit (IgG), goat anti-mouse (IgG) or rabbit anti-goat (IgG) (1:10,000; Millipore Bioscience Research Reagents) for 1\u2009hr at room temperature followed by three 10\u00a0min washing steps with TBST. Immunodetection was performed with the enhanced-chemiluminescence EZ-ECL kit (Biological Industries, Israel). The immunoblots were quantified with a CCD camera and Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). Each immunoblot was measured relative to the background and normalized to the endogenous controls (\u03b2-tubulin). Phosphorylation levels were calculated as the ratio between the readings from the antibody directed against the phosphoproteins and those from the antibody directed against the phosphorylation state-independent forms of the proteins."

They suggest the possible existence of two parallel taste memory traces: one which is strong but limited in time and lasts up to 3 hours and a second one weaker but longer in duration and lasts up to 8 hours from CS presentation. Furthermore, by applying biochemical and pharmacological techniques they suggest the involvement of specific molecular mechanism mediated by CamKII-GluA1 pathway that underlies the strong and shorter memory type but not of weak and longer memory type. Importantly, their results help to explain previous results from the same and other groups regarding the partial disruption of CTA memory by some pharmacological interventions. The possibility of parallel memory traces, which are dependent on separate molecular mechanisms, is exciting. The presented data is highly interesting with a clear potential to make it into <i>eLife</i>."
