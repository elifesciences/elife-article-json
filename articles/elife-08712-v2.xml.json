                    "text": "Sphingolipids are abundant membrane components and important signaling molecules in eukaryotic cells. Their levels and localization are tightly regulated. However, the mechanisms underlying this regulation remain largely unknown. In this study, we identify the Golgi-associated retrograde protein (GARP) complex, which functions in endosome-to-Golgi retrograde vesicular transport, as a critical player in sphingolipid homeostasis. GARP deficiency leads to accumulation of sphingolipid synthesis intermediates, changes in sterol distribution, and lysosomal dysfunction. A GARP complex mutation analogous to a <i>VPS53</i> allele causing progressive cerebello-cerebral atrophy type 2 (PCCA2) in humans exhibits similar, albeit weaker, phenotypes in yeast, providing mechanistic insights into disease pathogenesis. Inhibition of the first step of de novo sphingolipid synthesis is sufficient to mitigate many of the phenotypes of GARP-deficient yeast or mammalian cells. Together, these data show that GARP is essential for cellular sphingolipid homeostasis and suggest a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of PCCA2."

However, the mechanisms underlying this regulation remain largely unknown. In this study, we identify the Golgi-associated retrograde protein (GARP) complex, which functions in endosome-to-Golgi retrograde vesicular transport, as a critical player in sphingolipid homeostasis. GARP deficiency leads to accumulation of sphingolipid synthesis intermediates, changes in sterol distribution, and lysosomal dysfunction. A GARP complex mutation analogous to a <i>VPS53</i> allele causing progressive cerebello-cerebral atrophy type 2 (PCCA2) in humans exhibits similar, albeit weaker, phenotypes in yeast, providing mechanistic insights into disease pathogenesis. Inhibition of the first step of de novo sphingolipid synthesis is sufficient to mitigate many of the phenotypes of GARP-deficient yeast or mammalian cells. Together, these data show that GARP is essential for cellular sphingolipid homeostasis and suggest a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of PCCA2."

Sphingolipids can also be recycled from endocytic vesicles back to the plasma membrane via the Golgi apparatus (<a href=\"#bib11\">Choudhury et al., 2002</a>).

The phosphorylation of Orm1/2 releases these proteins from SPT, thereby initiating sphingolipid synthesis and the generation of the early synthesis intermediates, long-chain bases. In addition, Ypk1/2 kinases phosphorylate key subunits of the sphingolipid metabolic enzyme ceramide synthase, increasing its activity and flux of more distal steps of sphingolipid biosynthesis (<a href=\"#bib42\">Muir et al., 2014</a>)."

To evaluate this possibility, we determined the levels of long-chain bases before and after myriocin treatment in <i>vps52\u0394</i>, <i>vps53</i>\u0394, <i>vps54</i>\u0394, and control cells. Importantly, myriocin treatment greatly reduced the accumulation of long-chain bases in each of the GARP mutants (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F,G</a>). The rate of long-chain base decrease during the myriocin treatment time course was similar in wild-type and <i>vps53\u0394</i> cells (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), arguing that myriocin is equally effective in reducing sphingolipid synthesis in either strain.

A prediction from this hypothesis is that <i>vps53\u0394</i> and wild-type cells would distribute exogenously added, fluorescently labeled sphingosine (NBD-sphingosine) differently. Testing this possibility, we found that added NBD-sphingosine and FM4-64, a marker of endocytic membranes both initially label the plasma membrane, but then segregate into different compartments in wild-type cells: as expected, after 60 min, FM4-64 stained the yeast vacuole, whereas the NBD-sphingosine signal localized in one or a few foci likely representing compartments of the endosomal/secretory pathway (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, top control panels). In <i>vps53\u0394</i> cells, however, both lipids co-localized after 60 min in what appeared to be highly fragmented vacuoles (<a href=\"#bib13\">Conboy and Cyert, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Conibear and Stevens, 2000</a>) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a> middle control panels). Intriguingly, the abnormal vacuolar morphology in <i>vps53\u0394</i> cells was partially rescued by 12-hr myriocin treatment, resulting in a few small vacuoles (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a> bottom-myrocin, <a href=\"#fig3\">3B, 3C</a>, and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a> for characterization of vacuolar classes). However, NBD-sphingosine still localized to the vacuoles in myriocin-treated <i>vps53\u0394</i> cells, not to the plasma membrane as in wild-type cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Together, these results suggest that exogenously added long-chain bases are maintained to a large degree in the endosomal/secretory pathway of wild-type cells, but accumulate in the vacuole of GARP mutants. The data also suggest that myriocin treatment of these cells does not restore proper endosome to Golgi recycling of sphingolipids, but partially rescues vacuolar dysfunction, as indicated by restoration of vacuole morphology."

Among the 3347 proteins analyzed, we found that the levels of three proteins under control of the zinc-dependent transcription factor Zap1 (<a href=\"#bib35\">Lyons et al., 2000</a>) were strongly decreased (Adh4, Zrt1, Zps1; P &lt; 1e<sup>\u221211</sup>; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). Since the yeast vacuole is the main storage organelle for intracellular zinc (<a href=\"#bib54\">Simm et al., 2007</a>), we hypothesized that the altered vacuolar morphology of <i>vps53\u0394</i> mutants results in increased zinc release from the vacuole contributing to toxicity.

In yeast, loss of the GARP complex results in reduced levels of complex sphingolipids and the accumulation of sphingolipid synthesis intermediates, most notably long-chain bases. Importantly, this accumulation is correlated with abnormal vacuolar morphology and function, suggesting this build-up may be toxic. The depletion of a GARP complex subunit in mammalian cells results in similar phenotypes. Retrograde trafficking likely influences the subcellular localization of a large number of proteins. It is thus remarkable that many of phenotypes associated with GARP deficiency are greatly attenuated by pharmacological inhibition of SPT, the first and rate-limiting step in sphingolipid synthesis. Together, these results suggest that accumulation of toxic lipids may underlie a substantial degree of cellular dysfunction due to genetic defects in retrograde trafficking and that restoration of sphingolipid balance may be a strategy to treat diseases due to these defects."

In both yeast and mammalian cells, GARP complex deficiency disrupted sphingolipid and sterol homeostasis and resulted in the accumulation of sterols in the endo-lysosomal system. Normally, lipids retrieved from the plasma membrane by endocytosis can be recycled via the retrograde endosome-to-Golgi pathway to supply lipids necessary for rapid membrane expansion during growth. In GARP mutants, however, some membrane-derived lipids appear to be rerouted to vacuoles (or lysosomes) for degradation. This rerouting of lipids likely reduces their levels in the plasma membrane and increases the levels of sphingolipids, and their break-down products, in the vacuole/lysosome. This reduction in membrane sphingolipids may explain GARP's apparent role in plasma membrane organization, reported previously in genome-wide visual screens (<a href=\"#bib22\">Grossmann et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Frohlich et al., 2009</a>). It is yet unclear whether sphingolipids and sterols follow bulk flow of membrane materials in the endocytic pathway or are preferably recycled by retromer and GARP complexes. Regardless, our data are most consistent with the hypothesis that in the absence of GARP, sphingolipids and sterols are rerouted to vacuoles/lysosomes. In lysosomes, sphingolipids are broken down by acid sphingomyelinase and ceramidase, likely contributing to the elevation in sphingoid bases. However, it is also possible that missorting of sphingolipid synthesis enzymes or trafficking proteins in GARP mutants contributes to the observed phenotypes. For instance, a protein important for the export of sphingolipid intermediates from lysosomes/vacuoles could be missorted in GARP mutants, thus increasing vacuolar sphingolipid accumulation."

We show that inhibition of SPT, which lowers long-chain bases in GARP mutants, suppresses the growth defect of these strains. In contrast, the inhibition of later steps of sphingolipid synthesis, for example, by blocking ceramide synthase or inositolphosphoryl ceramide synthase, does not lower long-chain base levels and increases toxicity in GARP mutants. In addition, treatment with the long-chain base PHS exacerbated this toxicity. In yeast, low levels of plasma membrane sphingolipids activate TORC2/Slm/Ypk signaling to phosphorylate the Orm-proteins, relieving their inhibition of SPT, increasing sphingolipid synthesis (<a href=\"#bib8\">Breslow et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Han et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Roelants et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Berchtold et al., 2012</a>). Consistent with a decrease of plasma membrane sphingolipids, we found that the Orm1/2 proteins are hyperphosphorylated in GARP mutants suggesting that de novo sphingolipid synthesis is also upregulated. This increase may exacerbate GARP deficiency-induced lipotoxicity due to increased production of these early synthesis intermediates."

One possibility is that long-chain bases possess detergent-like properties, especially in an acidic environment (<a href=\"#bib28\">Jimenez-Rojo et al., 2014</a>), such as in the yeast vacuole. In model membranes, such as giant unilamellar vesicles, this detergent-like action leads to vesicular leakage (<a href=\"#bib15\">Contreras et al., 2006</a>). This could explain the findings of marked vacuolar fragmentation and potential leakage of zinc from GARP-deficient yeast vacuoles. In support of this hypothesis, we found that inhibition of SPT and reduction of long-chain bases suppressed the zinc sensitivity in GARP mutants in yeast. Also consistent with this hypothesis, the accumulation of sphingolipid intermediates impairs ion homeostasis in mammalian lysosomes of a cellular Niemann\u2013Pick type-C disease model (<a href=\"#bib33\">Lloyd-Evans et al., 2008</a>). Alternatively, long-chain bases are known to inhibit glycerolipid synthesis (<a href=\"#bib64\">Wu et al., 1993</a>), which might contribute to their cytotoxicity."

Sphingolipids and sterols are thought to interact with each other in membranes. Thus, GARP deficiency likely results in missorting of both to the vacuole/lysosome. Our data are most consistent with a model where sphingolipids are degraded in the lysosome/vacuole leading to a toxic build-up of sphingolipid metabolites, whereas sterols are exported and stored in cytoplasmic lipid droplets as more inert fatty acid esters. Consistent with this, lowering sphingolipid levels by myriocin treatment of wild-type cells increases sterols stained by filipin. Possibly, this indicates that in the absence of sufficient sphingolipids, sterols that are not complexed with sphingolipids build-up and are stored in ester form. A surprising finding is that the accumulation of sterols in GARP mutants is suppressed by inhibiting sphingolipid synthesis. These data argue that in addition to sterol missorting in GARP mutants, accumulation of sphingolipid intermediates impairs normal sterol homeostasis, for example, by interfering with sterol export from the vacuole/lysosome or synthesis regulation. This further highlights that a primary cause for defects due to GARP deficiency may be lysosomal/vacuolar dysfunction due to sphingolipid accumulation."

Analyses of brain lipid profiles suggest sphingolipid intermediates and sterol esters accumulate in ALS patients (<a href=\"#bib16\">Cutler et al., 2002</a>). In addition, mutations in the endo-lysosomal trafficking machinery have been implicated in neurodegenerative disorders including ALS and FTD (CHMP2B, FIG4, VAPB, and VCP) (<a href=\"#bib66\">Yang et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Parkinson et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Johnson et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Maruyama et al., 2010</a>) and defects in retrograde trafficking increase the risk for Parkinson's disease (VPS35) (<a href=\"#bib67\">Zimprich et al., 2011</a>). Our data therefore suggest that lipid imbalance and toxicity due to impaired endo-lysosomal trafficking could be a common feature of this group of neurodegenerative diseases. Since inhibition of SPT reversed some aspects of cellular dysfunction in our studies, our findings suggest that inhibition of the initial step of sphingolipid synthesis may provide a useful therapeutic strategy to pursue in these diseases."

The authors use genome wide proteomics and lipidomics to show that loss of GARP leads to the accumulation of long chain base sphingolipid synthesis intermediates that may trigger toxicity by release of zinc from the vacuole. Ergosterol esters also increased, as did lipid droplets. Finally, a disease causing allele showed similar defects. These data reveal a surprising result: inhibition of the first step in sphingomyelin synthesis may be able to suppress neurological defects in the GARP complex."

Concerning the first point, we have now analyzed sterol accumulation in <i>vps53</i> and <i>vps54</i> mutants in response to myriocin. Indeed, sphingolipid depletion is sufficient to rescue the observed accumulation of filipin-positive structures. Interestingly, myriocin treatment in wildtype cells has the opposite effect, resulting in the accumulation of filipin-positive structures. Similar effects have been observed in a mutant carrying a temperature sensitive allele of the serine palmitoyl transferase, <i>lcb1-100</i> (Baumann et al., Biochemistry, 2005). While the underlying mechanisms for this redistribution are not clear, the authors speculate that depletion of sphingolipids affects the plasma membrane ratios of sphingolipids and sterols resulting in more \u201cfree\u201d sterols not in complex with sphingolipids, and that these \u201cfree\u201d sterols redistribute to intracellular compartments. In line with this model, we also observe lower levels of complex sphingolipids in GARP mutants. We have added the data to <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> and modified the text and Discussion accordingly."

Thus, the best evidence for sphingolipid accumulation due to mis-sorting of the lipids, rather than an enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway, is indirect: i) the enzymes of LCB synthesis are ER localized and we do not observe changes for their abundance or localization; ii) since long chain base levels decrease slowly after myriocin treatment in GARP mutants, we believe that sphingolipids are increasingly trafficked to vacuoles for degradation. If the alternative model was true, and the LCB increase in GARP mutants would result solemnly from de novo biosynthesis, long chain base levels should be depleted faster as SPT inhibition is near instantaneous. However, at this time, we cannot rule out that proteins important for sphingolipid synthesis and/or handling are miss-sorted in GARP mutants. We consider it an interesting model that a protein important for the transport of long chain bases out of vacuoles is not reaching its destination and therefore contributes to the observed phenotype. We have edited the Discussion to better reflect these important points."
