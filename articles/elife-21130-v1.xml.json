                    "text": "Branching morphogenesis is a fundamental program for tissue patterning. We show that active YAP, a key mediator of Hippo signaling, is distributed throughout the murine lung epithelium and loss of epithelial YAP severely disrupts branching. Failure to branch is restricted to regions where YAP activity is removed. This suggests that YAP controls local epithelial cell properties. In support of this model, mechanical force production is compromised and cell proliferation is reduced in <i>Yap</i> mutant lungs. We propose that defective force generation and insufficient epithelial cell number underlie the branching defects. Through genomic analysis, we also uncovered a feedback control of pMLC levels, which is critical for mechanical force production, likely through the direct induction of multiple regulators by YAP. Our work provides a molecular pathway that could control epithelial cell properties required for proper morphogenetic movement and pattern formation."

We show that active YAP, a key mediator of Hippo signaling, is distributed throughout the murine lung epithelium and loss of epithelial YAP severely disrupts branching. Failure to branch is restricted to regions where YAP activity is removed. This suggests that YAP controls local epithelial cell properties. In support of this model, mechanical force production is compromised and cell proliferation is reduced in <i>Yap</i> mutant lungs. We propose that defective force generation and insufficient epithelial cell number underlie the branching defects. Through genomic analysis, we also uncovered a feedback control of pMLC levels, which is critical for mechanical force production, likely through the direct induction of multiple regulators by YAP. Our work provides a molecular pathway that could control epithelial cell properties required for proper morphogenetic movement and pattern formation."

The lung primordium arises from the ventral foregut and its emergence is marked by the expression of the <i>Nkx2.1</i> transcription factor (<a href=\"#bib59\">Zhou et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Minoo et al., 1999</a>). The lung primordium is composed of two parts: the future trachea and two endodermal buds. Both components are composed of an epithelial layer of endoderm surrounded by mesodermal cells. During lung branching morphogenesis, three characteristic modes of branching are repeatedly used at many different times and positions (<a href=\"#bib30\">Metzger et al., 2008</a>). They include formation of lateral branches from the parent branch (domain branching) and bifurcation at the tip of branches (planar and orthogonal bifurcation) (<a href=\"#bib30\">Metzger et al., 2008</a>). Initially, the buds grow ventrally and caudally, and initiate lateral branches at invariant positions, beginning around 10.5 <i>days post coitus</i> (<i>dpc</i>) in mice. In this way, five buds are generated, four on the right side and one on the left side, leading to the formation of four right lobes (cranial, middle, accessory and caudal) and one left lobe of the mature mouse lung. In this process, proximal-distal specification is associated with the emergence of <i>Sox9</i>-expressing progenitors and non-branching <i>Sox2</i>-expressing airways, which will become the conducting airway in the mature lung (<a href=\"#bib54\">Yang and Chen, 2014</a>). These complicated morphological movements culminate in an elaborate branching organ that also contains various differentiated cell types to fulfill the primary function of gas exchange. Acquisition of the spatial and temporal sequence of lung morphogenesis forms the basis of understanding the molecular mechanisms of lung development."

Several genes and pathways involved in this process have been identified (<a href=\"#bib34\">Morrisey et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Ornitz and Yin, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Volckaert et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Domyan and Sun, 2011</a>). However, we lack a mechanistic understanding of how lung epithelial cell properties are dictated by these genes and pathways during growth and patterning. This is a central unresolved issue in understanding lung development and homeostasis. Since lung growth and patterning is a tightly controlled process, we speculate that a master regulatory pathway is required for integrating diverse inputs and coordinating a multitude of cellular behaviors. A strong candidate is the Hippo pathway, which mediates organ size control in several other organs. Indeed, several recent studies show that the Hippo pathway controls key aspects of lung development, homeostasis and repair (<a href=\"#bib28\">Mahoney et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Zhao et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Lange et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Lin et al., 2015</a>)."

The key executor of the Hippo pathway is the transcriptional coactivator Yes-associated protein (YAP), which governs multiple aspects of cell physiology (<a href=\"#bib49\">Varelas, 2014</a>). YAP activity is negatively regulated through a kinase cascade, and YAP phosphorylation is correlated with its cytoplasmic sequestration and degradation. Consequently, the transcriptional targets of YAP in the nucleus are not expressed. In contrast, when upstream kinases are inactivated in response to external signals (such as low cell density), YAP becomes hypophosphorylated. It is postulated that this form of YAP enters the nucleus and activates Hippo targets in conjunction with the TEAD1-4 transcription factors. This is required for orchestrating a multitude of cellular functions including cell proliferation, differentiation and death and changes in cell properties."

Nuclear YAP could be found in both SOX2<sup>+</sup> (proximal) and SOX9<sup>+</sup> (distal) epithelial populations in wild-type lungs at 11.5, 12.5 and 14.5 <i>dpc</i> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A\u2013P</a>; <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), suggesting that YAP is active throughout the lung epithelium. YAP staining was barely detectable in the epithelium but was present at wild-type levels in the mesenchyme of <i>Yap</i>-deficient (<i>Yap<sup>f/f</sup>; Shh<sup>Cre/+</sup></i>) lungs (see below) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1Q,R</a>; <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1M</a>), indicating the specificity of YAP antibodies. A high percentage of SOX2<sup>+</sup> cells and SOX9<sup>+</sup> cells displayed nuclear YAP staining in wild-type lungs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1S</a>). Consistent with the distribution of active YAP along the entire lung epithelium, expression of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), an established YAP target, was detected in both the proximal and distal airways (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1T\u2013V</a>). We did not observe a sharp transition of YAP from the cytoplasm to the nucleus at the junction between the SOX2<sup>+</sup> and SOX9<sup>+</sup> populations, a region dubbed the transition zone (TZ) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1W</a>), as previously reported (<a href=\"#bib28\">Mahoney et al., 2014</a>). In that study, inactive cytoplasmic YAP was detected in SOX2-expressing cells except those that abut SOX9-expressing cells at 12.5 and 14.5 <i>dpc</i>. We found that phosphorylated YAP (pYAP) was present in both SOX2<sup>+</sup> and SOX9<sup>+</sup> epithelial cells. pYAP levels were, in general, higher in the proximal than distal epithelium, but pYAP levels varied significantly from cell to cell in both the proximal and distal airways (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Nevertheless, in many cells, low levels of pYAP were associated with the presence of nuclear YAP (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Lung epithelial cells that do not have nuclear YAP usually stain positive for cytoplasmic YAP. This is consistent with a model in which pYAP is sequestered and degraded in the cytoplasm, but it also indicates a dynamic shuttling and distribution of YAP along the entire airway epithelium (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chen et al., 2015</a>)."

The mutant lung buds failed to produce five fully separated buds. In particular, the buds that will produce the future cranial and middle lobes remained largely connected (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,N</a>; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>). This is likely due to the inability to undergo proper branching at very early stages of lung development. While stereotyped branching was actively underway in the wild-type lungs, the limited branching in <i>Yap</i> mutants came to a halt around 13.5 <i>dpc</i> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2I\u2013R</a>). In the absence of <i>Yap</i>, unbranched lung buds enlarged during development and turned into a multi-cyst structure. It is important to point out that cystic lung defects in <i>Yap</i> mutants that affect all lobes can be observed at very early stages of lung development, preceding expression of definitive epithelial markers.

Moreover, actomyosin-mediated contraction was shown to regulate lung branching in chick embryos (<a href=\"#bib20\">Kim et al., 2013</a>). To study whether YAP controls cellular contractility and mechanical force production, we determined the expression of pMLC (phosphorylated myosin light chain) in control and <i>Yap</i> mutant lungs. pMLC is indicative of contractility mediated by actomyosin. We found that pMLC protein levels were significantly diminished in <i>Yap<sup>f/f</sup>; Shh<sup>Cre/+</sup></i> lungs (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>; <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This led to our speculation that cortical pMLC, which is associated with mechanical force production during morphogenesis is disrupted in the absence of <i>Yap</i>. To test this idea, we utilized whole-mount immunofluorescence and two-photon microscopy to visualize the distribution of cortical pMLC. In addition, we focused on control and <i>Yap<sup>f/f</sup>; Shh<sup>Cre/+</sup></i> lungs at 11.5 <i>dp</i>c when the branching defects were about to take place (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B,C</a>). This would allow us to identify the driving force of defective branching. In wild-type lungs, cortical pMLC was distributed in both epithelial and mesenchymal cells at 11.5 <i>dpc</i> (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D\u2013F</a>).

BCAM and S1PR2 activate RhoA, while NUAK2 inhibits MLCP (myosin light chain phosphatase) in a RhoA-independent manner.

Moreover, the Hippo pathway can regulate F-actin accumulation in Drosophila (<a href=\"#bib12\">Gaspar and Tapon, 2014</a>) and YAP regulates genes that control cell cycle progression, F-actin polymerization and actin cytoskeleton remodeling in the mammalian heart (<a href=\"#bib33\">Morikawa et al., 2015</a>). These genes were proposed to function in cell migration in the heart. By contrast, our work uncovers YAP targets that may regulate phosphorylation of myosin light chain and consequently mechanical force production in the lung. The actin cytoskeleton itself does not generate mechanical force. Mechanical force production is mediated by contraction of myosin in the actomyosin cytoskeleton, a network composed of myosin associated with F-actin bundles. Thus, our studies offer new insight into how YAP controls patterning of mammalian organs via cell number and mechanical force. It is unclear in which steps during lung branching these two cell properties are required and how they impact the morphogenetic movement. Nor is it clear what the functional consequence is when either cell number or mechanical force is disrupted. For instance, would a reduction in epithelial cell number lead to a smaller sized lung with grossly correct patterning? Answering these important questions would rely on additional genetic manipulations in mice. These studies will reveal the interplay between changes in cell number and acquisition of cellular properties, a long-standing question in tissue patterning."

This suggests that YAP is dynamically shuttling in and out of the nucleus along the entire lung epithelium. On the average, 30\u201350% proximal and 10\u201328% distal epithelial cells contain cytoplasmic YAP, which is presumed to be inactive. Lung branching takes place at specific locations in the lung (<a href=\"#bib30\">Metzger et al., 2008</a>). It is likely epithelial cells that undergo active branching need to maintain active YAP signaling. By contrast, epithelial cells not actively branching may have inactive YAP through YAP phosphorylation. We speculate that this could serve to facilitate directional epithelial movement and new bud formation. How nuclear YAP is activated and maintained in lung epithelial cells requires future investigations. Lung epithelial cells with scanty nuclear YAP usually stain positive for cytoplasmic YAP. If cytoplasmic YAP is inactive as postulated, we anticipate that deletion of YAP in these cells should not have significant functional consequences. Namely, deletion of cytoplasmic YAP by Cre is not expected to exert non-cell autonomous effects on neighboring cells that contain nuclear YAP. As an extension of these ideas, we propose that pMLC is only produced and/or maintained at active sites of branching. This would allow mechanical force production in a regional manner and induce corresponding morphological changes. Consistent with this idea, pMLC was shown to exhibit dynamical patterns in the epithelial membrane during branching morphogenesis (<a href=\"#bib43\">Schnatwinkel and Niswander, 2013</a>). In the absence of YAP, disruption of pMLC production leads to a failure of new bud formation. One possibility is that new bud formation requires increased mechanical tension at the apical surface for its expansion and protrusion to produce new buds, while less tension is present in the interbud region. Testing these models relies on refined genetic manipulation coupled with cellular manipulation, real-time imaging and theoretical modeling."

It is also possible that a fundamental difference in the mechanical properties of lung epithelial cells exists in different regions of the lung.

Importantly, if the lung phenotypes in <i>Yap</i> mutants can only be initiated at a specific location in the lung epithelium (such as the \u2018transition zone\u2019 connecting SOX2<sup>+</sup> and SOX9<sup>+</sup> populations), we do not anticipate lung cysts to form in <i>Yap<sup>f/f</sup>; Sox9<sup>Cre/+</sup></i> or <i>Yap<sup>f/f</sup>; spc<sup>Cre/+</sup></i> lungs since high levels of Cre activity are not present in the SOX2<sup>+</sup>YAP<sup>nuclear\u00a0</sup>transition zone in these mice.

The immunoprecipitates were washed sequentially with TSE I buffer (150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 0.1% SDS, 1.0% Triton X-100), TSE II buffer (500 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 0.1% SDS, 2 mM EDTA, 1.0% Triton X-100), buffer 3 (250 mM LiCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 1 mM EDTA, 1.0% NP-40, 1.0% Triton X-100) and TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 1 mM EDTA). Immunoprecipitates were eluted twice in 250 \u03bcl elution buffer (100 mM NaHCO<sub>2</sub>, 1.0% SDS) at room temperature for 15 min. Crosslinking was reversed by incubating samples at 65\u00b0C for 4 hr and the samples were then treated with proteinase K at 45\u00b0C for 1 hr. DNA was extracted using Qiagen PCR-purification Kits. Two biological replicates using YAP and IgG antibodies were obtained."

They show that nuclear (active) YAP is present in both proximal and distal compartments of the embryonic lung, and that targeted epithelial deletion of YAP early in lung development severely disrupts branching morphogenesis. Using mosaic epithelial deletion, they show that the cystic airway phenotype appears to be delimited to the regions where YAP was deleted, suggesting it acts locally to regulate branching. They then use RNA-Seq and ChIP-seq to identify differentially expressed genes and direct YAP target genes, respectively. Enrichment of cell cycle and cellular contractility genes prompted them to ask whether YAP controls cellular contractility, and they show that phospho-MLC is reduced in mutants. They then show a functional reduction in the speed of uninjured epithelial cell movement in mutant airways following neighbor ablation, consistent with a role for YAP in mechanical force production. Direct YAP target genes that activate RhoA, such as <i>Arhgef17</i>, are found to be reduced in mutants, supporting that YAP is upstream of mechanical force production."
