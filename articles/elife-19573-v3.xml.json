In <i>Arabidopsis</i>, the trait can be maternally regulated but the underlying mechanisms sustaining this regulation, its general occurrence and its biological significance among accessions are poorly understood. Upon seed imbibition, the endosperm is essential to repress the germination of dormant seeds. Investigation of genomic imprinting in the mature seed endosperm led us to identify a novel set of imprinted genes that are expressed upon seed imbibition. Remarkably, programs of imprinted gene expression are adapted according to the dormancy status of the seed. We provide direct evidence that imprinted genes play a role in regulating germination processes and that preferential maternal allelic expression can implement maternal inheritance of seed dormancy levels."

In <i>Arabidopsis</i>, the trait can be maternally regulated but the underlying mechanisms sustaining this regulation, its general occurrence and its biological significance among accessions are poorly understood. Upon seed imbibition, the endosperm is essential to repress the germination of dormant seeds. Investigation of genomic imprinting in the mature seed endosperm led us to identify a novel set of imprinted genes that are expressed upon seed imbibition. Remarkably, programs of imprinted gene expression are adapted according to the dormancy status of the seed. We provide direct evidence that imprinted genes play a role in regulating germination processes and that preferential maternal allelic expression can implement maternal inheritance of seed dormancy levels."

In angiosperms, seed development is initiated after a double-fertilization event, which produces the endosperm and the zygote. Arabidopsis mature seeds consist of a desiccated and highly resistant embryo surrounded by a single cell layer of endosperm and an external layer, the testa, consisting of dead integumentary maternal tissues. The endosperm nourishes the developing embryo as both tissues develop.\u00a0The endosperm is triploid, bearing two maternal genomes\u00a0and one paternal genome, whereas the zygote is diploid, bearing one maternal and one paternal genome."

Unsurprisingly, this process is tightly controlled (<a href=\"#bib34\">Nonogaki, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Yan et al., 2014</a>). Primary seed dormancy, hereafter referred to\u00a0as \u2018dormancy\u2019, is a property of freshly produced seeds whereby seed germination does not occur even under otherwise favorable germination conditions (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chahtane et al., 2016</a>). Dormancy is a vital trait that\u00a0prevents germination out of season while maintaining the embryo in a protected state within the dry seed. As they age, dry seeds lose dormancy, a process known\u00a0as dry after-ripening, i.e. they acquire the capacity to germinate under favorable germination conditions. The time\u00a0period of dry after-ripening required before the seed acquires the capacity to germinate can be used to define the dormancy levels stored in seeds (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chahtane et al., 2016</a>). Unsurprisingly, the trait of dormancy varies markedly among plant species, including among <i>Arabidopsis</i> accessions, with important consequences in plant ecology, phenology and agriculture (<a href=\"#bib4\">Baskin and Baskin, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Finch-Savage and Leubner-Metzger, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Schmuths et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Meng et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Springthorpe and Penfield, 2015</a>). Indeed, different <i>Arabidopsis</i> accessions produce seeds with low or high dormancy levels. Low dormancy accessions need\u00a0only a short dry after-ripening time to acquire the capacity to germinate upon imbibition, unlike highly dormant accessions."

Furthermore, removing the testa while leaving the endosperm layer surrounding the embryo does not trigger embryonic growth (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bethke et al., 2007</a>). A \u2018seed coat bedding assay\u2019, monitoring the growth of dissected embryos cultured on a layer of dissected endosperms with the testa still attached, showed that the endosperm of dormant seeds is able to block embryonic growth by continuously synthesizing and releasing ABA towards the embryo (<a href=\"#bib27\">Lee et al., 2010</a>). In fully after-ripened seeds, the endosperm ceases to release sufficient ABA upon imbibition, thus allowing germination to take place (<a href=\"#bib27\">Lee et al., 2010</a>)."

In <i>Arabidopsis</i>, genomic imprinting was found and studied in the endosperm during seed development (<a href=\"#bib15\">Gehring, 2013</a>). Given the endosperm\u2019s nourishing role, it is often regarded as a plant equivalent of the mammalian placenta. The kinship or \u2018parental conflict\u2019 theory is often proposed to account for the evolutionary origin of imprinting (<a href=\"#bib18\">Haig and Westoby, 1989</a>).

The occurrence and biological role of endospermic imprinting in <i>Arabidopsis</i> mature seeds has not been investigated previously. Given the central role played by the mature endosperm in preventing the germination of dormant seeds, we investigated whether genomic imprinting could be implicated in maternal inheritance of primary seed dormancy. Here, we provide direct evidence that the\u00a0maternal inheritance of seed dormancy\u00a0does indeed involve dormancy-specific genomic imprinting programs that\u00a0take place in the mature endosperm."

Maternal inheritance of dormancy levels could be due to several factors including: (1) a purely maternal effect whereby the Cvi maternal plant tissues impose higher dormancy to the seed progeny; (2) an endospermic gene-imprinting effect; (3) a gene expression dosage effect resulting from the endosperm\u2019s parental genome imbalance,\u00a0which favors the maternal genome (2 maternal vs. 1 paternal genome, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In the last case, duplication of maternal dormancy genes would impose a pattern in their expression more akin to the maternal genotype. These three possibilities are not mutually exclusive and could therefore all be valid."

These crosses produce hybrid C24xCvi<sup>tet</sup> and CvixC24<sup>tet</sup> F1 seeds containing a 2:2 Cvi to C24 genome ratio in endosperm cells (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

As expected, presence of the endosperm was required to repress seed germination (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>).

By contrast, full dissection of the endosperm, i.e. the isolation of the endosperm without the surrounding testa, is a challenging task because it requires peeling the testa, a delicate and lengthy procedure that more often than not wounds the endosperm. The testa originates from ovular integuments that undergo progressive degeneration and collapse during seed development. Electron microscopy studies reveal that the mature testa does not contain obvious traces of organelles, cytoplasm or nuclei (<a href=\"#bib48\">Yadav et al., 2014</a>). Accordingly, researchers assume that the testa is not a significant source of maternal RNA contamination and\u00a0thus\u00a0that the partially dissected endosperm can be used as a source of RNA for endosperm transcriptomic studies (<a href=\"#bib12\">Dekkers et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Lee and Lopez-Molina, 2013</a>)."

                                "text": "We sought to verify that the testa is not a significant source of maternal mRNA contamination. Using WT seed material, total RNA was isolated from 40 partially dissected endosperms, 40 testas and 40 fully dissected endosperms in two independent experiments. To ensure maximal RNA recovery, a nucleic acid carrier was used for final RNA precipitation (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>, Materials and methods). The concentration levels of RNA extracted from testas were below detection levels, unlike those from partially and fully dissected endosperm (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). 200 ng of RNA was used to construct partially and fully dissected endosperm cDNA libraries. Although testa RNA could not be detected in our RNA testa sample, we sought to construct testa cDNA libraries using avolume of RNA testa sample equal to that of the largest one used for the construction of the partially and fully dissected endosperm cDNA libraries (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>, Materials and methods). Unsurprisingly, the resulting testa libraries contained concentrations of cDNA that were smaller than 25 fold than those in\u00a0the partially and fully dissected endosperm (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). All cDNA libraries were subject to high-throughput sequencing and sequencing reads were mapped to the <i>Arabidopsis</i> genome. The total number of reads obtained with the testa sample was only about 1% of the read numbers obtained for the partially and fully dissected endosperm (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). By contrast, the read numbers of the partially and fully dissected endosperm samples were similar (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). We compared the gene expression profiles between partially and fully dissected endosperm samples. Only 14 genes among 33,557 annotated genes were differentially expressed between the partially and fully dissected endosperm samples (p &lt;\u00a00.05) (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1</a>)\u00a0(Material and methods). Among these 14 genes, seven are osmotic stress-induced genes whose expression was higher in the fully dissected endosperm relative to the partially dissected endosperm (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 2</a>) (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kilian et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Winter et al., 2007</a>). The differential expression of these genes could be due to the lengthy testa peeling procedure, prior to endosperm isolation, which likely deprives the endosperm tissue of moisture. Similarly, among the 14 genes, two genes (<i>AT4G35100</i> and <i>AT1G62510</i>) were reported to be downregulated in response to osmotic stress and had higher expression in the partially dissected endosperm relative to the fully dissected endosperm (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1</a>) (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kilian et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Winter et al., 2007</a>). Only <i>AT1G62510</i>, predicted to encode a seed-storage 2S albumin-like protein, had a substantial number of reads in the testa sample (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This gene is expressed during seed maturation, suggesting that a maternal contamination could also account for its higher expression in the partially dissected endosperm relative to that in the fully dissected endosperm (<a href=\"#bib46\">Winter et al., 2007</a>)."

Following a short after-ripening period that does not fully eliminate seed dormancy, endospermic decay of CRU proteins and germination took place upon imbibition, but both processes were delayed relative to fully after-ripened seeds (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

Besides its housekeeping function, there is increasing evidence that the purine degradation pathway participates in the plant\u2019s responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. In this context, Watanabe et al. showed that increased allantoin levels in response to drought stress protects the plant by enhancing ABA synthesis (<a href=\"#bib44\">Watanabe et al., 2014</a>). Indeed, Watanabe et al. showed that <i>aln</i> seedlings accumulate high ABA levels (<a href=\"#bib44\">Watanabe et al., 2014</a>).

For partially dissected endosperm and fully dissected endosperm samples, the cDNA libraries were prepared from 200 ng total RNA using a TruSeq mRNA Library Prep Kit (Illumina,\u00a0Switzerland). Although testa RNA could not be detected, we prepared the cDNA library with the same volumes of RNA testa as those used for the construction of the endosperm cDNA libraries. cDNA libraries were normalized and pooled then sequenced using HiSeq 2500 (Illumina) with single-end 100 bp reads. For sequencing testa cDNA, we used the same volume of cDNA as that used for sequencing endosperm cDNA. cDNA library preparation and sequencing, as well as read mapping and counting, were performed in the same manner for all seed materials (testa, partially and fully dissected endosperm).

The resulting numbers for each gene are provided in <a href=\"#SD6-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 6</a>. A list of potential maternally expressed genes (MEGs) and paternally expressed genes (PEGs) was established after applying the following criteria: (1) potential MEGs are those genes whose ratio of maternal allele to paternal allele read number is more than 0.8 in both ColxCvi and CvixCol endosperm F1 material; similarly potential PEGs are those whose ratio of paternal to maternal allele read number is more than 0.6; (2) potential MEGs or PEGs with read numbers lower than five were discarded; (3) the probabilities of deviation from expected ratio (maternal:paternal\u00a0=\u00a02:1) in a Fisher's two-tailed exact test were calculated and only potential MEGs or PEGs with a p\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.05 were retained."

For instance, in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, ABCG30 in non-dormant seeds seems mono-allelic and VIM5 in non-dormant seeds seems bi-allelic, unlike stated. This kind of inconsistency is also observed in several cases in <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>. f) The p-value used to call imprinted genes (0.05) is quite permissive, and likely led to inclusion of false positives. g) The RNA-seq results are not always consistent between reciprocal crosses. For example, CP1 has 5683 maternal vs. 17 paternal reads in Col x Cvi, but only 56 maternal vs. 10 paternal reads in Cvi x Col. h) Only MEGs specific for the dormant dataset were tested by Sanger sequencing."

Furthermore, we think it is important to verify parent-of-origin specific expression in mature endosperm using a reporter construct. Because creating a new reporter construct would take a long time, we suggest using the published FWA:GFP reporter."

It is possible that those genes are expressed because dormancy was broken rather than their expression being the cause for the break in dormancy. For instance, the authors propose that the differential expression of CP1, a MEG, may be involved in dormancy due to its potential role in protein storage decay. However, <i>cp1</i> mutant seeds do not seem to have different dormancy levels compared to WT. Therefore, while there may be a correlation between the expression of certain MEGs and dormancy levels, there is no evidence in this work for a functional link between the two."

So although the manuscript makes claims about a role of imprinting in dormancy control, these remain hypothetical in my view although it is an interesting possibility. There is therefore no clear relationship between the data gathered that shows that dormancy control is maternal (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>), and the action of any imprinted genes, and this creates a somewhat confusing narrative. Thus although it was shown that dormancy state affects imprinting, it is not clear that imprinting affects dormancy, and the author has not satisfactorily ruled out that the maternal tissues are affecting dormancy state in CVI x C24 or CVI x Col crosses, which they are well known to do (Debeaujon et al., 2001). In fact <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1a</a> could be removed from the paper without detracting from the study. Proving a role for imprinting in dormancy control could be achieved using kai2 mutants in crosses for instance, but would be a substantial amount of further work."

For instance, the authors propose that the differential expression of CP1, a MEG, may be involved in dormancy due to its potential role in protein storage decay.

Furthermore, cold, which increases dormancy in both ecotypes, diminishes expression in both cases. These observations suggested to us (our model) that the maternal allele regulates dormancy levels by imposing expression levels of dormancy genes that is characteristic of the maternal ecotype.

There is therefore no clear relationship between the data gathered that shows that dormancy control is maternal (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>), and the action of any imprinted genes, and this creates a somewhat confusing narrative. Thus although it was shown that dormancy state affects imprinting, it is not clear that imprinting affects dormancy, and the author has not satisfactorily ruled out that the maternal tissues are affecting dormancy state in CVI x C24 or CVI x Col crosses, which they are well known to do (Debeaujon et al., 2001). In fact <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1a</a> could be removed from the paper without detracting from the study.
