                    "text": "Ki-67 and RepoMan have key roles during mitotic exit. Previously, we showed that Ki-67 organizes the mitotic chromosome periphery and recruits protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) to chromatin at anaphase onset, in a similar manner as RepoMan (<a href=\"#bib2\">Booth et al., 2014</a>). Here we show how Ki-67 and RepoMan form mitotic exit phosphatases by recruiting PP1, how they distinguish between distinct PP1 isoforms and how the assembly of these two holoenzymes are dynamically regulated by Aurora B kinase during mitosis. Unexpectedly, our data also reveal that Ki-67 and RepoMan bind PP1 using an identical, yet novel mechanism, interacting with a PP1 pocket that is engaged only by these two PP1 regulators. These findings not only show how two distinct mitotic exit phosphatases are recruited to their substrates, but also provide immediate opportunities for the design of novel cancer therapeutics that selectively target the Ki-67:PP1 and RepoMan:PP1 holoenzymes."

Previously, we showed that Ki-67 organizes the mitotic chromosome periphery and recruits protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) to chromatin at anaphase onset, in a similar manner as RepoMan (<a href=\"#bib2\">Booth et al., 2014</a>). Here we show how Ki-67 and RepoMan form mitotic exit phosphatases by recruiting PP1, how they distinguish between distinct PP1 isoforms and how the assembly of these two holoenzymes are dynamically regulated by Aurora B kinase during mitosis. Unexpectedly, our data also reveal that Ki-67 and RepoMan bind PP1 using an identical, yet novel mechanism, interacting with a PP1 pocket that is engaged only by these two PP1 regulators. These findings not only show how two distinct mitotic exit phosphatases are recruited to their substrates, but also provide immediate opportunities for the design of novel cancer therapeutics that selectively target the Ki-67:PP1 and RepoMan:PP1 holoenzymes."

How these events are coordinated during mitotic exit is still an open question. The emerging picture is that exiting mitosis requires the specific engagement and activation of protein phosphatases, including ser/thr phosphatase protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) (<a href=\"#bib14\">Funabiki and Wynne, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Rosenberg et al., 2011</a>). While PP1 exhibits broad specificity, it acts in a highly specific manner by forming stable complexes, known as holoenzymes, with a host of regulatory proteins that direct PP1 activity towards specific substrates and localize PP1 to specific regions of the cell (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hendrickx et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Bollen et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Peti et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Peti and Page, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Choy et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">O'Connell et al., 2012</a>). A detailed understanding of how key PP1 regulators bind and direct PP1 activity during distinct stages of the cell cycle is still largely missing."

Recently, it was shown that one role of Ki-67 is to function as a \u2018DNA surfactant\u2019, preventing individual chromosomes from collapsing into a single chromatin mass upon nuclear envelope disassembly by binding directly to the surface of chromatin (<a href=\"#bib4\">Cuylen et al., 2016</a>). A second recently discovered function is that it binds and regulates the activity of PP1 during mitosis using the canonical PP1 RVxF small linear motif (SLiM) (<a href=\"#bib2\">Booth et al., 2014</a>). The only other protein that exhibits any sequence similarity with Ki-67 near its RVxF motif is RepoMan (recruits PP1\u03b3 onto mitotic chromatin at anaphase, also known as cell division cycle associated 2, CDCA2), a nuclear-specific protein that was discovered for its ability to specifically recruit PP1\u03b3 to chromosomes at anaphase onset and, like Ki-67, is upregulated in many cancers (<a href=\"#bib36\">Trinkle-Mulcahy et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Vagnarelli, 2014</a>). During mitotic exit, PP1, in particular PP1\u03b3 (PP1 isoforms include PP1\u03b1, PP1\u03b2, PP1\u03b3 and PP1\u03b32; \u2265 85% identity between isoforms), is essential for histone dephosphorylation, nuclear-envelope reassembly and chromatin remodeling (<a href=\"#bib30\">Qian et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Vagnarelli et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Wurzenberger et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Qian et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Vagnarelli et al., 2011</a>). These PP1\u03b3-specific processes are mediated largely by the Ki-67:PP1\u03b3 and RepoMan:PP1\u03b3 holoenzymes. Two key unresolved questions are how do these regulators assemble mitotic phosphatases and how are these interactions dynamically regulated in both space and time? Answers to these questions will provide novel opportunities for the development of\u00a0Ki-67:PP1 and RepoMan:PP1 specific therapeutics for cancer. In this report, we demonstrate how Ki-67 and RepoMan form mitotic exit phosphatases, how they distinguish between distinct PP1 isoforms and how the assembly of these two holoenzymes is dynamically regulated by Aurora B kinase during mitosis."

Because recent efforts to understand how PP1 activity is directed by its &gt;200 distinct regulators has revealed that residues outside the RVxF motif are also essential for PP1 holoenzyme formation and function (<a href=\"#bib26\">Peti et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">O'Connell et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Terrak et al., 2004</a>), we reasoned that this entire region was critical for PP1 binding. Using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), we showed that Ki-67<sub>496-536</sub> and RepoMan<sub>383-423</sub> bind PP1\u03b3<sub>7\u2013323</sub> with a 1:1 stoichiometry and with nearly equivalent affinities (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, left; <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>; K<sub>D</sub> = 193 \u00b1 16 nM and 133 \u00b1 5 nM; respectively; all ITC experiments are summarized in <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). We also showed that extending this domain does not enhance binding (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Finally, NMR spectroscopy experiments with RepoMan confirmed that all residues in this conserved region interact with PP1 (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplements 2</a>,<a href=\"#fig1s3\">3</a>). Together, these data suggest that Ki-67<sub>496-536</sub> and RepoMan<sub>383-423</sub> bind PP1 using identical mechanisms and that this conserved region, which extends beyond the RVxF SLiM, constitutes the full PP1 interaction domain."

To identify this mechanism, we determined the crystal structures of the Ki-67<sub>496-536</sub>:PP1\u03b3<sub>7\u2013308</sub> and RepoMan<sub>383-423</sub>:PP1\u03b3<sub>7\u2013308</sub> holoenzymes complexes to 2.0 \u00c5 and 1.3 \u00c5, respectively (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a>; <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>). As predicted by the ITC and NMR studies, Ki-67 and RepoMan bind PP1 using an identical mechanism. Namely, Ki-67 and RepoMan form a classical \u03b2-hairpin on the top of PP1 that extends from the PP1 RVxF binding pocket towards the PP1 N-terminus and then back again (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>; ~2600 \u00c5 of buried surface area). The structures also show that two established PP1-specific SLiMs\u2014the RVxF-SLiM (<a href=\"#bib9\">Egloff et al., 1997</a>), <sup>505</sup>RVSF<sup>508</sup><sub>Ki-67</sub>/<sup>392</sup>RVTF<sup>395</sup><sub>RM</sub> and the \u03a6\u03a6-SLiM (<a href=\"#bib24\">O'Connell et al., 2012</a>), <sup>515</sup>EL<sup>516</sup><sub>Ki-67</sub>/<sup>402</sup>EV<sup>403</sup><sub>RM</sub> \u2014bind directly to PP1 in the RVxF and \u03a6\u03a6 binding pockets (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). However, as predicted, the Ki-67/RepoMan residues C-terminal to these SLiMs (aa 517\u2013535/404\u2013422) also bind PP1 and do so in a manner never observed for any other PP1 regulator (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D,E</a>). Residues F517<sub>Ki-67</sub>/F404<sub>RM</sub> and P523<sub>Ki-67</sub>/A410<sub>RM</sub> are anchored to PP1\u03b3 via two hydrophobic pockets while multiple residues in Ki-67/RepoMan bind the side chains of R74<sub>PP1</sub>, Y78<sub>PP1</sub> and Q294<sub>PP1</sub> via polar and salt bridge interactions. This orders PP1\u03b3 L1 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>), a loop that is generally more dynamic in most free PP1 and PP1 holoenzyme structures as evidenced by its higher B-factors and less well-defined electron density. Although F517<sub>Ki-67</sub>/F404<sub>RM</sub> are the most buried residues in both complexes, mutating this residue to an alanine does not negatively affect RepoMan function (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>)."

Critically, a subsequent search of the UniProtK/Swiss-Prot database (<a href=\"#bib5\">de Castro et al., 2006</a>) using the most degenerate version of the KiR-SLiM identified only Ki-67 and RepoMan proteins. This demonstrates that, unexpectedly, only these two PP1 regulators likely use the KiR-SLiM interaction surface on PP1."

                                "text": "How PP1 regulators selectively recruit specific PP1 isoforms to distinct substrates remains an important, open question. PP1 has three isoforms\u2014\u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3\u2014that differ primarily in the last ~30 residues of their C-termini; because of this, it has been generally assumed that regulators that bind preferentially to one isoform interact directly with the C-terminus (<a href=\"#bib34\">Takagi et al., 2014</a>). In vivo, Ki-67 and RepoMan bind specifically to the \u03b2- and \u03b3-isoforms, but not the \u03b1-isoform, of PP1 (<a href=\"#bib2\">Booth et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Trinkle-Mulcahy et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Vagnarelli et al., 2011</a>). As PP1\u03b3 is recruited more efficiently than PP1\u03b2 (<a href=\"#bib2\">Booth et al., 2014</a>), we focused our study on the PP1\u03b1 and PP1\u03b3 isoforms. We confirmed this in vitro using ITC, which showed that the affinity of both Ki-67<sub>496-536</sub> and RepoMan<sub>383-423</sub> for PP1\u03b1<sub>7\u2013330</sub> is ~four\u2013six-fold weaker than for PP1\u03b3<sub>7\u2013323</sub> (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). To elucidate the molecular basis of isoform selectivity, we first tested the role of the PP1\u03b3 C-terminal residues. Deleting the last 15 residues of PP1\u03b3 had no impact on binding (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We then tested if RepoMan binds PP1\u03b1 differently by determining the structure of the RepoMan<sub>383-441</sub>:PP1\u03b1<sub>7\u2013300</sub> holoenzyme (2.6 \u00c5; <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>). The structures are identical (backbone RMSD = 0.22 \u00c5), demonstrating that the isoform selectivity is due to one or more of the six amino acid differences in the PP1 catalytic domain (residues 7\u2013300). Only two of these differing residues are located near the Ki-67/RepoMan:PP1 interface, Arg20/Gln20 (\u03b3/\u03b1) and Lys23/Arg23 (\u03b3/\u03b1; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). We generated variants of both isoforms in which one or both of these residues were mutated to that of the other (PP1\u03b3<sup>R20Q</sup>, PP1\u03b3<sup>R20Q/K23R</sup> and PP1\u03b1<sup>Q20R</sup>) and determined their affinities for Ki-67<sub>496-536</sub> and RepoMan<sub>383-423</sub> using ITC (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>; <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>; <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The change of only a single amino acid, R20/Q20, switches PP1\u03b3 into a \u2018PP1\u03b1\u2019-like isoform (PP1\u03b3<sup>R20Q</sup>; K<sub>D</sub> = 2239 \u00b1 124 nM; ten\u00a0fold weaker binding) and PP1\u03b1 into a \u2018PP1\u03b3\u2019-like isoform (PP1\u03b1<sub>Q20R</sub>; K<sub>D</sub> = 199 \u00b1 46 nM; similar binding to that of PP1\u03b3). Although R20 does not interact with Ki-67\u00a0or\u00a0RepoMan directly, it confers selectively through its interactions with PP1 which order the L1 loop. Namely, the\u00a0Arg20 sidechain forms a salt bridge with PP1 residue Glu77 and makes a planar stacking interaction (cation/\u03c0 interaction) with Phe81. Neither interaction is\u00a0possible with Q20, as the side chain is both uncharged and too short. Thus, only in PP1\u03b3 is this pocket ordered and readily available for binding, which allows for the isoform specific interaction of Ki-67\u00a0and\u00a0RepoMan."

Remarkably, the R20Q mutation abolishes PP1\u03b3 localization as effectively as mutating the canonical RVxF motif in RepoMan to RATA. Together, these data reveal that the isoform specificity of Ki-67 and RepoMan is not defined by residues in the PP1 C-terminus, but instead by a single residue in the PP1 catalytic domain, R20/Q20 (\u03b3/\u03b1). This is a fundamental result, as it demonstrates that regulator-specific isoform selectively is not only achieved through interactions with the C-terminus, but also through interactions with the structured catalytic domain."

This relocalization is dependent on its ability to bind effectively to Ki-67 and RepoMan (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) (<a href=\"#bib37\">Trinkle-Mulcahy et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Trinkle-Mulcahy et al., 2001</a>) and is regulated by phosphorylation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib39\">Vagnarelli et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Qian et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Vagnarelli et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Qian et al., 2015</a>). For example, RepoMan S400, T412 and T419 are phosphorylated by CDK1-cyclin B (<a href=\"#bib40\">Vagnarelli et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Qian et al., 2015</a>). Mutating these residues to phosphomimetics inhibits PP1\u03b3 binding, as evidenced by the inability of EGFP-RepoMan<sup>3D</sup> to pull-down PP1\u03b3 from non-synchronized HEK293T cells [see <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a> in <a href=\"#bib28\">Qian et al. (2015)</a>] and an inability of RFP-PP1\u03b3 to localize to the LacO locus when co-expressed with GFP:LacI-RepoMan<sup>3D</sup> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Notably, the identity of the kinase that phosphorylates the S507<sub>Ki-67</sub> and T394<sub>RM</sub> sites, both of which have been identified in proteomic screens (<a href=\"#bib7\">Dephoure et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Nousiainen et al., 2006</a>), has remained elusive. Because Aurora B kinase is redistributed from centromeres to the spindle midzone at anaphase onset and because the S507<sub>Ki-67</sub> and T394<sub>RM</sub> sequences match canonical Aurora B kinase phosphorylation motifs (<a href=\"#bib19\">Kettenbach et al., 2011</a>), we reasoned that these residues are phosphorylated by Aurora B kinase. Using in vitro phosphorylation assays coupled with NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry, we showed that both S507<sub>Ki-67</sub> and T394<sub>RM</sub> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) are phosphorylated directly by Aurora B kinase. Furthermore, mutating S507<sub>Ki-67</sub> and T394<sub>RM</sub> to a phosphorylation mimetic (Ki-67<sub>496-536</sub><sup>S507D</sup>/RepoMan<sub>348-450</sub><sup>T394D</sup>) profoundly weakens their interactions with PP1 (~25-30-fold reduction in affinity; <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Finally, the expression of GFP-LacI-RepoMan<sup>T394D</sup> results in a significant reduction of the recruitment of RFP-PP1\u03b3 to the LacO locus (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>), i.e., to a level that is nearly identical to that observed for GFP-LacI-RepoMan<sup>RATA</sup> and GFP-LacI-RepoMan<sup>3D</sup>. These data demonstrate that phosphorylation by Aurora B kinase in (pro)metaphase inhibits PP1\u03b3 binding to Ki-67 and RepoMan and, as a consequence, significantly contributes to prevent their premature recruitment to chromosomes."

These are key advances as, until this work, there was essentially no molecular data on mitotic phosphatase assembly and function. Our data now explains why the phosphorylation of RepoMan at three distinct sites (S400, S412 and S419) by Cdk1 inhibits PP1 binding (<a href=\"#bib28\">Qian et al., 2015</a>). Namely, it is similar to the mechanism by which Aurora B kinase inhibits Ki-67:PP1 and RepoMan:PP1 holoenzyme formation. All three residues, like the Aurora B targets S507<sub>Ki-67</sub> and T394<sub>RM</sub>, are part of the PP1 interaction motif and their phosphorylation blocks the interaction with PP1, which, in turn, prevents the premature targeting of PP1 to chromatin. This regulation of holoenzyme assembly is critical as the premature targeting of PP1 to chromosomes leads to an increase in chromosome misalignment and a weakened spindle assembly checkpoint (<a href=\"#bib28\">Qian et al., 2015</a>). In contrast, the expression of a PP1-binding mutant of RepoMan in HeLa cells results in extensive cell death, demonstrating the importance of the RepoMan-PP1 interaction for cell viability (<a href=\"#bib36\">Trinkle-Mulcahy et al., 2006</a>)."

That is, Ki-67 and RepoMan selectively assemble with PP1\u03b3 because the KiR-SLiM distinguishes between a single residue in PP1: Arg20<sub>PP1\u03b3</sub> and Gln20<sub>PP1\u03b1</sub>. Finally, since the KiR-SLiM is present in just two regulators, the newly discovered KiR-SLiM binding pocket defines a novel surface on PP1 that is targetable for the development of drugs that inhibit only 1% of the distinct PP1 holoenzymes in the cell (2 of ~200) (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hendrickx et al., 2009</a>). This is of profound interest because both Ki-67 and RepoMan are highly upregulated in multiple cancers (<a href=\"#bib8\">Dowsett et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Vagnarelli, 2014</a>). Targeting unique regulator binding pockets is a powerful approach as we recently discovered that the newly discovered LxVP SLiM substrate interaction surface is a well-known drug target site in the ser/thr phosphatase Calcineurin (<a href=\"#bib16\">Grigoriu et al., 2013</a>). Given the diversity of unique interactions that are now being revealed between PSPs and their plethora of regulators, it is now clear that these novel, unique protein:protein interaction sites, especially that defined by the KiR-SLiM, provide immediate opportunities for the design of novel, highly specific therapeutics."

A 10\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 pixel area contained within the chromosomes was used to measure the total intensity of the signal. Three different measurements per mitosis on different chromosomes and 3 different cytoplasmic areas were collected and averaged. An area of the same size outside the cells was used to identify the background signal in each image, and this value was subtracted from the measurement of the chromosome and cytoplasmic area. The GFP (or RFP for PP1\u03b3) intensity on the chromosomes was then normalized against the cytoplasmic intensity. For quantification of PP1-binding at the LacO locus, images of interphase transfected cells were acquired and the intensity of PP1 staining at the GFP spot was calculated relative to the average nuclear intensity. The 3-dimensional data sets obtained at the same exposure were projected as mean intensities. A 12 \u00d7 12 pixel area containing the GFP spot was used to measure the total intensity of the signal. An area of the same size was used to identify the background signal in each cell, and this value was subtracted from the measurement of the nuclear and spot area. The data were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test."

This new structure is very similar to that of the homologous RepoMan motif bound to PP1\u03b3, which would have been predicted based on the very strong similarity of the PP1-binding motifs of these proteins. In the rest of the manuscript the authors used the RepoMan:PP1 interaction as a proxy for the Ki-67:PP1 interaction, but without validating any of their conclusions on Ki-67 itself, which makes the link to the original <i>eLife</i> paper rather tenuous. The Ki-67 and RepoMan motif-PPI structures are quite interesting because the peptide forms a \u03b2-hairpin, with its N-terminal part being positioned on the usual RVXF binding site of PP1, but with its C-terminal part turning around 180 degrees, in contrast to other PP1 structures where the polypeptide chain continues more or less straight on the PP1 surface, often establishing a second main contact at the SILK binding site. However, whether Ki67 and RepoMan are the only ligands for this new binding site on PP1, as the authors claim, is not clear, as it may well be that motifs with divergent or even unrelated sequences bind at the same site. Regulation of RV(S/T)F sites by Aurora B kinase has already been established (most notably, for the N-terminal region of Knl1/CASC5), as has the control by Aurora B of RepoMan recruitment to chromatin. Moreover, no direct evidence of the functional importance of the reported RepoMan and Ki-67 interactions with PP1\u03b3 for progression through mitosis is provided, for instance as assessed by expressing appropriate mutants in knockdown cells. Taken together, the three editors who reviewed this paper are not convinced that these studies constitute a sufficiently substantial advance on Booth et al. to justify publication as a Research Advance in <i>eLife</i>."

The authors use crystallography, ITC and cell imaging to characterize these interactions. The two main findings are that: (i) RM and Ki-67 interact with PP1\u03b3 through a common structural mechanism involving an extended structure that includes the RVxF SLiM, the \u03a6\u03a6 SLiM and a novel motif they refer to as the KiR SLiM. (ii) The authors define a structural mechanism for the selectivity of RM and Ki-67 for the PP1gamma isoform relative to PP1\u03b1 as being due to Arg 20 in PP1\u03b3 compared to Gln20 in PP1\u03b1. By substituting Arg for Gln, the authors convert PP1\u03b1 to PP1\u03b3 -like and vice versa.

This demonstrates that protein-protein interaction pockets bind to specific sequence motifs and, in this way, achieve specificity. Thus, there is no reason not to expect the same strict sequence requirements will be required for binding the KiR-SLIM binding pocket on PP1. Indeed, this is the reason why numerous efforts are ongoing to target these sequences in the pharmaceutical industry (including Vertex Pharmaceuticals & Reflexion Pharmaceuticals) and academia."

This is important because it reveals a new mechanism by which the assembly of the Ki-67/RepoMan holoenzymes are regulated during the cell cycle. Namely, the phosphorylation of Ki-67 and RepoMan by Aurora B kinase explains why Ki-67 is maintained in a phosphorylated state in early mitosis and why the RepoMan:PP1 holoenzyme is largely excluded from chromatin prior to anaphase onset\u2013neither can bind and form stable holoenzymes with PP1. As noted by the reviewers, Aurora B augments this effect by phosphorylating a second site on RepoMan (Ser817; ~400 amino acids away from the RVxF 5 motif) to further prevent it from binding chromatin. Thus, our discovery that Aurora B phosphorylates a second site, the RVxF site, is not only novel, it also demonstrates that Aurora B phosphorylation of RepoMan results in two distinct mechanisms for reducing the premature targeting of PP1 to chromosomes prior to anaphase onset. Both of these are important and our results provide a new understanding of how these holoenzymes are regulated during the cell cycle."

This results in an adverse effect on cell viability, as almost no mitotic cells and very few interphase cells are detected expressing high levels of this mutant and a much larger level of cell death was observed (Trinkle-Mulcahy et al., 2006). Similarly, a study by one of the authors of this manuscript demonstrated that phosphorylation of RepoMan at three distinct sites (Ser400, Ser412 and Ser419) also inhibits PP1 binding (Qian et al., 2015)."

However, the formation of daughter nuclei are not notably affected. This mild phoenotype is consistent with that observed for cells in which Ki-67 is knocked-down completely.

As stated above, knock-down studies with RepoMan demonstrate that it is critical for viability. The importance of PP1 binding for this function of RepoMan was demonstrated by transfecting a PP1-deficient mutant (RAxA) which led to a large level of cell death. In contrast, 6 similar studies with a Ki-67 RAxA mutant resulted in mild phenotypes, similar to those observed from cells with Ki-67 knocked down. We have edited the text accordingly to more explicitly address these points."

Important \u2013 neither interaction is possible with the uncharged, shorter Gln20 residue in PP1\u03b1. Thus, Arg20 stabilizes the interaction between PP1 loop 1 (residues 19-26) and the remainder of the PP1 catalytic core. This is consistent with our previous data \u2013 in the multiple PP1\u03b1 structures we have determined to date (4XPN, 4MOV, 4MOY, 4MP0, 3V4Y, 3EGG, 3EGH, 3HVQ, 3E7A, 3E7B), the density for PP1\u03b1 loop 1 is generally the weakest in the entire structure (even in the 1.4 \u00c5 maps, 4MOV). In contrast, in PP1\u03b3 structures, the electron density of this loop is consistently better. This is also consistent with the B-factors of this loop: the average increase of the main chain B-factors for this loop (normalized against the average B-factor) are consistently higher for PP1\u03b1 than PP1\u03b3. Together, these data demonstrate that only in PP1\u03b3 is this defined pocket is readily available for binding, which, as a consequence, leads to the isoform specific interaction of RM and Ki-67 for PP1\u03b3."
