                    "text": "The nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway degrades mRNAs containing long 3'UTRs to perform dual roles in mRNA quality control and gene expression regulation. However, expansion of vertebrate 3'UTR functions has required a physical expansion of 3'UTR lengths, complicating the process of detecting nonsense mutations. We show that the polypyrimidine tract binding protein 1 (PTBP1) shields specific retroviral and cellular transcripts from NMD. When bound near a stop codon, PTBP1 blocks the NMD protein UPF1 from binding 3'UTRs. PTBP1 can thus mark specific stop codons as genuine, preserving both the ability of NMD to accurately detect aberrant mRNAs and the capacity of long 3'UTRs to regulate gene expression. Illustrating the wide scope of this mechanism, we use RNA-seq and transcriptome-wide analysis of PTBP1 binding sites to show that many human mRNAs are protected by PTBP1 and that PTBP1 enrichment near stop codons correlates with 3'UTR length and resistance to NMD."

However, expansion of vertebrate 3'UTR functions has required a physical expansion of 3'UTR lengths, complicating the process of detecting nonsense mutations. We show that the polypyrimidine tract binding protein 1 (PTBP1) shields specific retroviral and cellular transcripts from NMD. When bound near a stop codon, PTBP1 blocks the NMD protein UPF1 from binding 3'UTRs. PTBP1 can thus mark specific stop codons as genuine, preserving both the ability of NMD to accurately detect aberrant mRNAs and the capacity of long 3'UTRs to regulate gene expression. Illustrating the wide scope of this mechanism, we use RNA-seq and transcriptome-wide analysis of PTBP1 binding sites to show that many human mRNAs are protected by PTBP1 and that PTBP1 enrichment near stop codons correlates with 3'UTR length and resistance to NMD."

A key problem with this mechanism, however, is that long untranslated regions also serve important roles in the cell: for example, by determining where and when mRNA molecules are read to make protein. How then do mRNAs with long but important untranslated regions escape detection and degradation?"

This is particularly true in human cells, in which the average 3\u2019UTR length has evolved to exceed that necessary to induce NMD of reporter transcripts.

By affinity purifying endogenously assembled mRNPs containing the RSE, we identify the polypyrimidine tract binding protein 1 (PTBP1) as the key mediator of RSE function. We show that mutations preventing PTBP1 binding to the RSE abolish protection from NMD, while artificial recruitment of PTBP1 immediately downstream of an NMD-triggering TC recapitulates RSE activity. Together, our findings indicate that PTBP1 functions to exclude UPF1 from 3\u2019UTRs, disrupting its ability to accurately discriminate 3\u2019UTR length and induce decay. Furthermore, we performed RNA-seq analysis on human cells depleted of PTBP1 and UPF1 together and in isolation to identify endogenous transcripts with long 3\u2019UTRs protected from NMD by PTBP1. Transcriptome-wide analysis of PTBP1 interaction sites reveals preferential binding of PTBP1 near TCs, a binding pattern correlated with 3\u2019UTR length and resistance to NMD."

For these studies, we used tetracycline (tet)-regulated reporter mRNAs containing a \u03b2-globin mini-gene and the SMG5 3\u2019UTR (<a href=\"#bib79\">Singh et al., 2008</a>). The SMG5 3\u2019UTR triggers NMD as part of an extensive program of autoregulation by the NMD pathway, in a manner proposed to be due to its length (1342 nt; <a href=\"#bib32\">Huang et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Singh et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib93\">Yepiskoposyan et al., 2011</a>). We inserted the 400 nt RSE sequence or a control sequence of the same length (the antisense RSE sequence, AS-RSE) into the reporter mRNAs immediately downstream of the TC, mimicking the natural context of the RSE in the RSV RNA (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>). To assess the specific antagonistic activity of the RSE against NMD, constructs encoding reporter mRNAs were co-transfected with a vector constitutively expressing a control RNA into 293 Tet-off cells treated with control or anti-UPF1 siRNAs. The expression of the tet-regulated mRNAs was induced for 4\u2009hr before transcription was inhibited by addition of doxycycline, and mRNA decay was monitored at the indicated time points (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Transcripts containing only the SMG5 3\u2019UTR exhibited a half-life of ~120 min in cells treated with control siRNAs, in agreement with its previous characterization as an NMD substrate. Transcripts containing the RSE were substantially more stable (half-life ~400 min) than transcripts containing the AS-RSE sequence (&lt;120 min), confirming the protective activity of the RSE (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, upper panel). In contrast, in cells depleted of UPF1, all transcripts had half lives of greater than 240 min, indicating that the observed decay in siNT-treated cells was due to the activity of UPF1 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, lower panel)."

Together, our data suggest that the mechanisms governing RSE-mediated protection from NMD are conserved from birds to humans."

                                "text": "Among the putative RSE-binding proteins identified, we considered PTBP1 to be a promising putative anti-NMD factor for several reasons. In addition to its established role in alternative splicing, PTBP1 has been implicated as an RNA stability factor (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib73\">Romanelli et al., 2013</a>). Moreover, as expected for a protein responsible for protecting specific mRNAs, PTBP1 has been found to be preferentially associated with long 3\u2019UTRs (<a href=\"#bib22\">Gama-Carvalho et al., 2006</a>). Finally, a variety of techniques have been used to characterize the interaction specificity of PTBP1 and establish that the protein\u2019s four RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) each contribute to binding of degenerate pyrimidine-rich sequences. UV cross-linking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP) experiments indicate that PTBP1 binding is driven both by high-affinity heptameric or hexameric motifs and by local enrichment of pyrimidines (<a href=\"#bib92\">Xue et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib91\">2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Han et al., 2014</a>). Indicative of the potential for robust PTBP1 binding, examination of the RSE sequence revealed as many as eleven CU-rich clusters corresponding to putative PTBP1 binding sites spread throughout the 400 nt element. This includes three instances of CU-rich hexameric sequences identified as over-represented in PTB CLIP sequence tags, as well as five additional clusters containing heptamers enriched in CLIP tags (<a href=\"#bib92\">Xue et al., 2009</a>; see Materials and methods for sequences). Therefore, we predicted that multiple PTBP1 molecules might be recruited to RSE-containing mRNPs, forming an RNP refractory to UPF1 association."

First, we mutated all putative PTBP1 binding sites in the RSE by replacing a subset of U and C residues in CU-rich clusters with G and A residues, respectively (RSE-\u0394PTB; see Materials and methods for sequences). Next, we inserted six previously characterized PTBP1 binding sites into the RSE-\u0394PTB sequence at arbitrary positions (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>; <a href=\"#bib92\">Xue et al., 2009</a>), with ~60 nt between each site (RSE-\u0394PTB+6xPTBBS). The wild-type RSE and the RSE mutants were inserted into reporter mRNAs upstream of the artificial GAPDH-derived 3\u2019UTR, and the extent of PTBP1 association with the reporter transcripts was assayed by monitoring the co-purification of reporter mRNAs with immunopurified endogenous PTBP1. As shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3B and C</a>, PTBP1 association with the RSE-\u0394PTB-containing transcripts was significantly reduced compared to the wild-type RSE-containing transcripts. Reintroducing six PTBP1 binding sites into the RSE-\u0394PTB led to recovery of PTBP1 association to levels similar to those found in association with the wild-type RSE.\u00a0"

To test the possibility that PTBP1 binding causes exclusion of UPF1 from the mRNP, we assayed the co-purification of the same reporter mRNAs with immunopurified endogenous UPF1. Northern blots of co-purified mRNAs indicated transcripts containing the RSE-\u0394PTB sequence displayed substantially increased UPF1 association (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3B and C</a>). The inverse relationship between PTBP1 and UPF1 association is consistent with our hypothesis that PTBP1 prevents UPF1 from associating with the 3\u2019UTRs. Interestingly, although the level of UPF1 association on the transcripts containing RSE-\u0394PTB+6xPTBBS is significantly reduced compared to RSE-\u0394PTB, it was still higher than that of the wild-type RSE, indicating that the natural arrangement of the PTBP1 binding sites in the RSE may be optimal for antagonizing UPF1 binding.\u00a0As a control to ensure that the PTBP1-mediated inhibition of UPF1 binding was due to cellular interactions rather than a consequence of protein-RNA reassortment in extracts, we further tested the ability of stably expressed tandem protein A-tagged UPF1 to co-purify mRNAs expressed in distinct cells (<a href=\"#bib58\">Mili and Steitz, 2004</a>).\u00a0In these experiments, we observed co-purification of mRNAs when tagged UPF1 and mRNAs were expressed in the same cells, but none when reporter RNA-containing extracts from cells lacking tagged protein were mixed with extracts containing tagged UPF1 (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1D, Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1E)</a>."

In RNA decay assays, we found that addition of three PTBP1 binding sites significantly improved transcript stability, with the distributed binding sites having a marginally stronger effect (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Importantly, transcripts containing either arrangement of six PTBP1 binding sites were highly stabilized relative to control transcripts, demonstrating that PTBP1 binding is capable of recapitulating RSE function. Consistent with the position-dependence of the full-length RSE (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), mRNAs in which a cluster of six PTBP1 binding sites were introduced into the SMG5 3\u2019UTR 600 nt or 1200 nt downstream of the TC were highly unstable (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>)."

In biological replicates, mRNAs from 495 genes reproducibly decreased in abundance upon depletion of PTBP1, relative to their expression levels in cells treated with control siRNA (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>; see also <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 6\u2014source data 1</a>), consistent with previous reports implicating PTBP1 in the stabilization of diverse human mRNAs. To determine whether the down-regulated mRNAs were made susceptible to NMD in the absence of PTBP1, we examined the effects of co-depletion of UPF1 and PTBP1. Of the transcripts down-regulated upon PTBP1 knockdown, we designated mRNAs from 188 genes observed to reproducibly increase in siPTB/siUPF1 vs siPTB alone as 'rescued.' On average, concurrent knockdown of UPF1 and PTBP1 caused an increase in mRNA levels among PTBP1-dependent genes (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>), while the average accumulation of PTBP1-dependent mRNAs was not altered upon UPF1 depletion alone (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Among all of the PTBP1-dependent genes, the extent of mRNA rescue upon co-depletion correlated with the reduction upon PTBP1 knockdown (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,C</a>). Consistent with a role for PTBP1 binding near the stop codon, this correlation was dependent on the presence of putative high-affinity PTBP1 hexamer binding sites in the region downstream of the TC (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>)."

Specifically, transcripts containing PTBP1 hexamers within 50 nt of the TC were significantly less likely to be up-regulated upon UPF1 depletion than transcripts lacking putative binding sites in this interval, while transcripts with hexamers located 50\u2013100 from the TC showed no apparent protection from NMD (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>).

This activity is associated with a reduction in UPF1 binding to transcripts containing long 3\u2019UTRs, an early event in the process of NMD. In our model, the RSE and PTBP1 effectively mask the true length of the downstream 3\u2019UTR from UPF1, allowing the mRNA to elude surveillance. The ability of PTBP1 to antagonize UPF1 binding depends on its location on the mRNA; PTBP1 binding at the beginning of the 3\u2019UTR causes a loss of UPF1 binding, while relocation to distal sites reduces this function. This position-dependence has the advantage of allowing stabilization in response to translation termination at the proper stop codon while preserving the ability of NMD to detect premature TCs. In contrast, a position-insensitive mechanism would prevent NMD from accurately detecting de novo nonsense mutations, reducing the scope of quality control."

In many human cell types, including those used for this study, depletion of PTBP1 leads to induction of PTBP2, which compensates for a subset of PTBP1 functions. As it possesses highly similar biochemical activities, PTBP2 may also stabilize a subset of mRNAs usually protected by PTBP1, meaning that the population of mRNAs identified here as protected from NMD is likely to underestimate the role of PTB paralogs in NMD inhibition. In addition, we expect that marking genuine TCs with PTBP1 is just one strategy employed by long 3\u2019UTRs to evade NMD. Supporting the existence of diverse solutions to the problem, yeast Pub1p was found to stabilize certain NMD targets by means that remain undefined (<a href=\"#bib76\">Ruiz-Echevarria and Peltz, 2000</a>), and manipulation of 3\u2019UTR structure to bring the poly-A tail in spatial proximity to the TC has been shown to stabilize reporter mRNAs (<a href=\"#bib19\">Eberle et al., 2008</a>)."

PTBP1 contains four RRMs, each with affinity for CU-containing sequences (<a href=\"#bib65\">Oberstrass et al., 2005</a>). Of these, RRM3 and RRM4 are oriented back-to-back, resulting in RNA loops of 15 nt or more between sites of PTBP1 contact (<a href=\"#bib46\">Lamichhane et al., 2010</a>). These short-range looping events may also be accompanied by capture of distant CU-rich sequences by individual RRMs forming larger looped RNA structures (<a href=\"#bib16\">Clerte and Hall, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Kafasla et al., 2009</a>). It has been suggested that long-range interactions involving multiple PTBP1 molcules bound to a single RNA may be responsible for excluding binding of splicing factors, resulting in splicing repression (<a href=\"#bib15\">Chou et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Amir-Ahmady et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Cherny et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Lamichhane et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Sharma et al., 2011</a>). Alternatively, PTBP1 may interact with proteins such as MATRIN 3 to promote the assembly of higher-order repressive complexes (<a href=\"#bib38\">Joshi et al., 2011</a>). By direct analogy to its role in splicing, PTBP1 assembled on multiple TC-proximal CU-rich sequences could thus result in a zone of UPF1 exclusion, preventing the initial assembly of UPF1 into mRNPs (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). In addition to preventing initial UPF1 association with 3\u2019UTRs, PTBP1 could affect UPF1 already bound to an mRNA. In this scenario, PTBP1 may, as has been recently described for cytoplasmic poly-A binding protein, stimulate ATPase-dependent dissociation of UPF1 from the mRNP (<a href=\"#bib50\">Lee et al., 2015</a>)."

For stable expression of tagged UPF1, pBABE hygro (<a href=\"#bib61\">Morgenstern and Land, 1990</a>) was modified to contain tandem protein A domains and a TEV protease cleavage site between the <i>Nae</i>I and <i>Not</i>I sites, and full-length UPF1 coding sequences was inserted between the <i>Not</i>I and <i>Xho</i>I sites.

One way to strengthen the conclusions will be to insert PTBP1 binding sites downstream of nonsense codons in well characterized NMD reporters (e.g., \u03b2-globin or TCR-\u03b2), that are efficiently degraded by NMD or to tether PTBP1 downstream of a stop codon.</i> In the revised manuscript, we further bolster the evidence that PTBP1 is a potent inhibitor of NMD in two ways. First, we show that the RSE is able to abrogate NMD stimulated by the exon junction complex, using an established NMD reporter undergoing efficient decay due to a spliced intron downstream of the termination codon (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>; GAPDH-AdML reporter from Singh et al. 2008). We employed this reporter after initial attempts to incorporate PTBP1 binding sites downstream of the classic \u201c\u03b2-globin 39\u201d premature termination codon led to aberrant splicing. As both the \u03b2-globin 39 and GAPDH-AdML reporters undergo NMD stimulated by a single downstream intron, these reporters are functionally similar. Second, we demonstrate that PTBP1 recruited via the bacteriophage MS2 coat protein stabilizes NMD target mRNAs (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1C, D</a>). Further, it is important to note that we show that the RSE/PTBP1 can completely protect two well-studied, physiologically important NMD targets (SMG5 and the Rous sarcoma virus unspliced mRNAs) from decay."

The authors should perform control experiments to test the extent of such rearrangements in their assays.</i> To address the possibility that the observed ability of PTBP1 to inhibit UPF1 binding to mRNAs was due to RNA-protein interactions formed in cell extracts, we performed experiments in which extracts containing tagged UPF1 were mixed with extracts produced from cells expressing exogenous reporter mRNAs (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1D, E</a>). Whereas affinity purification of tagged UPF1 efficiently recovered co-expressed mRNAs, we observed no co-purification of UPF1 with mRNAs expressed in distinct cells. These data suggest that the interactions assayed by immunoprecipitation reflect genuine cellular interactions and are not the result of post-lysis re-assortment."

This approach resulted in quantification of relative recovery of RSE variant mRNAs relative to each other and to the unmodified GAPDH 3\u2019UTR indistinguishable from that observed in experiments using the shorter bGH-derived 3\u2019UTR. In addition, we have previously demonstrated that using the GFP-bGH mRNAs as recovery controls gives results that are highly consistent with the orthogonal approach of tagged mRNA affinity purification (see Hogg and Goff, 2010)."
