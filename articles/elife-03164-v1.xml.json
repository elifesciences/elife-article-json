                    "text": "Translation elongation factor eEF1A has a well-defined role in protein synthesis. In this study, we demonstrate a new role for eEF1A: it participates in the entire process of the heat shock response (HSR) in mammalian cells from transcription through translation. Upon stress, isoform 1 of eEF1A rapidly activates transcription of HSP70 by recruiting the master regulator HSF1 to its promoter. eEF1A1 then associates with elongating RNA polymerase II and the 3\u2032UTR of HSP70 mRNA, stabilizing it and facilitating its transport from the nucleus to active ribosomes. eEF1A1-depleted cells exhibit severely impaired HSR and compromised thermotolerance. In contrast, tissue-specific isoform 2 of eEF1A does not support HSR. By adjusting transcriptional yield to translational needs, eEF1A1 renders HSR rapid, robust, and highly selective; thus, representing an attractive therapeutic target for numerous conditions associated with disrupted protein homeostasis, ranging from neurodegeneration to cancer."

In this study, we demonstrate a new role for eEF1A: it participates in the entire process of the heat shock response (HSR) in mammalian cells from transcription through translation. Upon stress, isoform 1 of eEF1A rapidly activates transcription of HSP70 by recruiting the master regulator HSF1 to its promoter. eEF1A1 then associates with elongating RNA polymerase II and the 3\u2032UTR of HSP70 mRNA, stabilizing it and facilitating its transport from the nucleus to active ribosomes. eEF1A1-depleted cells exhibit severely impaired HSR and compromised thermotolerance. In contrast, tissue-specific isoform 2 of eEF1A does not support HSR. By adjusting transcriptional yield to translational needs, eEF1A1 renders HSR rapid, robust, and highly selective; thus, representing an attractive therapeutic target for numerous conditions associated with disrupted protein homeostasis, ranging from neurodegeneration to cancer."

For example, if there is a sudden increase in temperature\u2014which could damage proteins or other molecules\u2014most cells can respond with the \u2018heat shock response\u2019. In humans and other mammals, a single protein called heat shock factor 1 triggers the production of numerous heat shock proteins that protect the cell from the detrimental effects of high temperatures. Most heat shock proteins protect cells by binding to, and stabilizing, other molecules in the cell; this prevents these molecules from being damaged or from aggregating and allows them to continue to function as normal."

To make a protein, an enzyme called RNA polymerase transcribes DNA in the nucleus of the cell into a messenger RNA molecule that then exits the nucleus and binds to a ribosome. This molecular machine then translates the messenger RNA sequence into a protein by joining together individual building blocks called amino acids in the correct order. Like other elongation factors, eEF1A1 helps to select the amino acids that match the sequence of the messenger RNA template. However, it was unclear how eEF1A1 helped to protect cells during the heat shock response."

These cells had enough of this protein to support their growth and development under normal conditions, but not enough to help during the heat shock response. When these cells are subjected to a sudden increase in temperature, they fail to produce a sufficient amount of major heat shock proteins. Heat shock factor 1 is needed to transcribe the genes that encode these heat shock proteins, and Nudler et al. found that eEF1A1 must bind to heat shock factor 1 and then to a moving RNA polymerase for these genes to be transcribed efficiently. Moreover, the eEF1A1 protein was shown to bind to and stabilize the heat shock proteins' messenger RNAs, and aid their export from the nucleus and their binding to the ribosome."

In mammalian cells, HSR is regulated at the level of transcription by the heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) (<a href=\"#bib20\">Guertin and Lis, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Anckar and Sistonen, 2011</a>). In coordination with their augmented transcription, the stability, transport, and translation of HSP mRNAs (especially HSP70) are sharply increased during HSR, accounting for the robust production of HSPs (<a href=\"#bib46\">Theodorakis and Morimoto, 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Zhao et al., 2002</a>). HSP70 is the best-studied example, which is among the most inducible HSPs in terms of promptness and robustness of the response (<a href=\"#bib46\">Theodorakis and Morimoto, 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Lindquist and Craig, 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Cuesta et al., 2000</a>).

Therefore, a \u223c70% knockdown of eEF1A1 did not compromise cell viability under non-stress conditions and overall translation under control or mild-heat shock conditions (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). The levels of eEF1A1 and HSF1 (positive control), but not those of GAPDH, were greatly reduced after efficient transfection of human breast cancer cells (MDA-MB231), primary human fibroblasts (WI38), immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEFs), or mouse NSC34 motor spinal cord/neuroblastoma fusion cells, with specific and un-related sets of siRNAs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> [siRNA pair A], <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A</a> [siRNA pair B], <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3A,B</a> [siRNA C]). After heat shock, knock down of eEF1A1 (\u223c30% of control remaining) or HSF1, (&lt;25% of control remaining), markedly reduced the induction of HSP70 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3A,B</a>) and HSP27 (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure1\u2014figure supplement 3C</a>), and resulted in loss of thermo-tolerance (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). To rule out the possibility that the loss of induction of HSPs in eEF1A1-deficient cells was potentially due to overall compromised translation, de novo protein synthesis was analyzed in a pulse-chase experiment with [35S]-methionine. We observed a general decrease in protein synthesis after HS, but no significant difference between mock-transfected cells and cells depleted of either HSF1 or eEF1A1 (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Consistently, HSP70 and HSP27 mRNA levels were significantly decreased in eEF1A1-knocked down heat-shocked cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3D,E</a>). Impaired mRNA induction upon heat shock due to eEF1A1 deficiency was observed for several classes of HSP genes (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure1\u2014figure supplement 3F</a>). It is known that HSP70 mRNA induction occurs upon chemical inhibition of translation. To verify that the action of eEF1A1 is independent of its role in translation inhibition, we tested eEF1A1 knockdown conditions in combination with inhibitors of translation elongation. eEF1A1-depleted cells treated with the HSR-stimulating inhibitors of translation, cycloheximide (CHX) or doxycycline (DOX) failed to accumulate HSP70 mRNA (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3G</a>). In contrast, knocking down eEF1A2 isoform had no effect on HSP70 mRNA induction or protein amount (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4A,B</a>). These results demonstrate that isoform 1 of eEF1A specifically controls HSPs gene expression irrespective of its role in translation."

Moreover, eEF1A1 formed a ternary complex with HSF1 and DNA. Heat shock or arsenic treatments induce HSF1 DNA binding, as detected by EMSA. Under these conditions, anti-HSF1 and anti-eEF1A1, but not mouse IgG, super-shifted the HSF1\u2013DNA complex (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). We noted that the super-shifts with anti-eEF1A1 and anti-HSF2 antibodies were similar. Considering that HSF2 binds HSE only when forming a hetero-trimer with HSF1 (<a href=\"#bib37\">Ostling et al., 2007</a>), this observation indicates further that eEF1A1 associates directly with DNA-bound HSF1. Moreover, in vitro binding of recombinant eEF1A1 to a DNA fragment of HSP70 promoter suggests direct and specific, albeit a relatively weak, interaction of eEF1A1 to HSP70 promoter <b>(</b><a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). We further confirmed the presence of eEF1A1 at the HSP70 locus by ChIP-QPCR experiments with an eEF1A1-specific antibody (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Occupancy of HSP70 and HSP27 promoters by eEF1A1 was significantly higher (p &lt; 0.05) than at the GAPDH promoter. These results demonstrate that eEF1A1 binds specifically to promoters of at least two HSP genes before and after stress."

To gain further insight in the cellular localization of eEF1A1 regarding HSP70 mRNA, we used fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). We used the MEFs expressing eEF1A1 fused to Cherry and Flag (<a href=\"#fig1s5\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5A</a>), and we infected human diploid fibroblasts (TIGs) to also express recombinant eEF1A1 protein fused to Cherry and Flag (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). MEFs were subjected to different times of HS (from 0 to 60 min) before visualizing HSP70 mRNA. From 30 to 60 min of HS \u223c80% of the cells showed a strong nuclear FISH signal that accounted for active HSP70 transcription (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s5\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5B,C</a>). After 30 min of heat shock, we quantified the dots representing Cherry-eEF1A1 concentrated at several HSP70 TS (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Percentages of HSP70 TS with a positive signal for Cherry-eEF1A1 were quantified by airlocalize\u2122 software (<a href=\"#bib27\">Lionnet et al., 2011</a>). The percent of Cherry-eEF1A colocalizing with the HSP TS increased from 27% to \u221264% for 30 to 60 min (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Using probes for \u03b2-actin TS instead of those for HSP70 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>), we did not see any co-localization with eEF1A nuclear dots. The Cherry-eEF1A dots were not a result of bleed through of the FISH signal because when HSP70 FISH was performed in MEFs that do not express Cherry-eEF1A1, nuclear dots in the red channel were rarely apparent, and when FISH was not performed the Cherry-eEF1A1 dots remained evident (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>) The presence of eEF1A1 at HSP70 TS was further confirmed in a human fibroblast cell line (TIG) (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

We have found that although the expression of HSP70 during heat shock is synchronized, not all the cells respond with the same intensity at the same time. Indeed, induction of HSP70 transcription within the TSs of the same cell is stochastic (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s5\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5B,C</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

The software identifies clustered pixels above a user-determined threshold as transcription sites. Then, the software fits a two-dimensional Gaussian, which approximates a point spread function, to determine the spatial position and intensity of each transcription site, after subtracting a local estimate of the fluorescent background. After the center position of TS spots in each channel were identified in 3-dimensional space, colocalization events were assigned when the distances between the closest spot of different colors were within two pixels."

As you will see in the reviews below, both reviewers raised a number of substantive issues that we feel precludes publication of the current version of your manuscript. Revisions for <i>eLife</i> papers are intended to be performed within 2-3 months and we believe that the amount of experimentation required to fully address the reviewers' comment will take more than that amount of time.

They find that eEF1A acts at multiple steps in expression of heat shock proteins. First, they show that eEF1A binds to heat shock genes, such as HSP70, and helps recruit the heat shock transcription factor HSF1 to the promoter. They further show that eEF1A is associated with RNA POL II and the 3' UTR of HSP70 mRNA, stabilizing and facilitating it for nuclear transport and ultimately to active ribosomes."

These extraordinary claims, which in effect state that, \u201ceEF1A orchestrates the entire heat shock response\u201d, require extraordinary evidence.

I am concerned that other general mechanisms, which do not require a direct mechanistic role in each of these very specific steps, might account for the numerous effects seen. Could the depletion of such a super abundant protein (1-3% of total cytosolic proteins) lead to general pleiotropic effects that make general cellular mechanisms sluggish? eEF1A1 is also known to have chaperone function (see J. Biol. Chem. 2007, 282:4076), and its depletion might have a broad array of effects including those seen here. The previously documented role of eEF1A1 by this group as having a role in trimerization and activation of HSF1 could be consistent with such a chaperone role. These general concerns and the lack of a mapping of specific functions to distinct parts or mutations of the protein, lead me to the view that this grand view of eEF1A is too ambitious for a single paper and for the data in hand. This is already a bulky paper and it may be better suited being published as a couple of more focused papers in more specialized journals than <i>eLife</i>.

The current Impact Statement now is \u201ceEF1A1 orchestrates the process of heat shock response, from transcription activation of the HSP70 gene, to HSP70 mRNA stabilization, nuclear export, and translation\u201d. The word \u201centire\u201d is now deleted, which helps, but this is still an overstatement, especially considering the complexity of the heat shock response. First, the \u201cprocess of the heat shock response\u201d is too broad, as this study focuses on Hsp70. Second, the work \u201corchestrates\u201d gives eEF1A1 a status of a major regulator like HSF1. While the paper provides data supporting an eEF1A1 contribution to the Hsp70 heat shock response at multiple stages, this factor has not acquired the regulatory support of an Hsf1, which has been demonstrated to have more than 10 times larger effects than those reported here on transcription (and protein production) of major heat shock genes."

In this case, the values at the promoter after DRB-HS treatment are higher than those under non-HS conditions, indicating an accumulation of RNAPII at the HSP70 promoter.
