Cargo ubiquitylation favors their lysosomal targeting and can be regulated by external signals, but the mechanism is ill-defined. Here, we studied the post-endocytic trafficking of Jen1, a yeast monocarboxylate transporter, using microfluidics-assisted live-cell imaging. We show that the ubiquitin ligase Rsp5 and the glucose-regulated arrestin-related trafficking adaptors (ART) protein Rod1, involved in the glucose-induced internalization of Jen1, are also required for the post-endocytic sorting of Jen1 to the yeast lysosome. This new step takes place at the trans-Golgi network (TGN), where Rod1 localizes dynamically upon triggering endocytosis. Indeed, transporter trafficking to the TGN after internalization is required for their degradation. Glucose removal promotes Rod1 relocalization to the cytosol and Jen1 deubiquitylation, allowing transporter recycling when the signal is only transient. Therefore, nutrient availability regulates transporter fate through the localization of the ART/Rsp5 ubiquitylation complex at the TGN."

Cargo ubiquitylation favors their lysosomal targeting and can be regulated by external signals, but the mechanism is ill-defined. Here, we studied the post-endocytic trafficking of Jen1, a yeast monocarboxylate transporter, using microfluidics-assisted live-cell imaging. We show that the ubiquitin ligase Rsp5 and the glucose-regulated arrestin-related trafficking adaptors (ART) protein Rod1, involved in the glucose-induced internalization of Jen1, are also required for the post-endocytic sorting of Jen1 to the yeast lysosome. This new step takes place at the trans-Golgi network (TGN), where Rod1 localizes dynamically upon triggering endocytosis. Indeed, transporter trafficking to the TGN after internalization is required for their degradation. Glucose removal promotes Rod1 relocalization to the cytosol and Jen1 deubiquitylation, allowing transporter recycling when the signal is only transient. Therefore, nutrient availability regulates transporter fate through the localization of the ART/Rsp5 ubiquitylation complex at the TGN."

This means that the cells can no longer use lactate as a source of energy. However, it was not known where in the cell the Rod1 protein does this."

But unexpectedly, Rod1 is also found at a cellular structure called the trans-Golgi network, small membrane sacs that are typically responsible for packaging proteins so they can be transported to a new destination, in particular the plasma membrane. This suggests that Rod1 can also act at this location in the cell."

Endocytosis is a major component of this adaptation. The conjugation of ubiquitin to membrane proteins (\u2018cargoes\u2019) acts as a major determinant of their intracellular sorting in the endocytic pathway. Ubiquitin can notably act as a signal to promote cargo endocytosis from the plasma membrane (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib14\">Dupr\u00e9 et al., 2004</a>). This is particularly true in yeast, and studies have shown the critical involvement of Rsp5, a conserved ubiquitin ligase of the Nedd4 family, in cargo ubiquitylation at the plasma membrane upon triggering endocytosis (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib41\">MacGurn et al., 2012</a>)."

Indeed, the nutritional status of the medium, such as the absence/excess of a given substrate, regulates the dynamics of the cognate transporters at the plasma membrane through their regulated ubiquitylation and endocytosis. Recent work has notably contributed to our understanding of the mechanism responsible for the signal-induced ubiquitylation of transporters. Indeed, at the plasma membrane, the ubiquitin ligase Rsp5 ubiquitylates endocytic cargoes and is assisted in its function by adaptor proteins of the ART family (<span class=\"underline\">A</span>rrestin-<span class=\"underline\">R</span>elated <span class=\"underline\">T</span>rafficking adaptors), that confer to Rsp5 the ability to ubiquitylate numerous transporters in response to various external inputs (<a href=\"#bib40\">Lin et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Nikko et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Nikko and Pelham, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Hatakeyama et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">O'Donnell et al., 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib56\">2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Karachaliou et al., 2013</a>).

Interestingly, the human arrestin-related protein TXNIP was recently reported to regulate glucose influx in cells by promoting the endocytosis of the glucose transporter GLUT1 in an AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-dependent manner, illustrating the conservation of arrestin-related proteins function in endocytosis (<a href=\"#bib72\">Wu et al., 2013</a>)."

However, this is not a general rule, because affecting the ubiquitylation of the G-protein-coupled receptors \u03b22-AR and CXCR4 (<a href=\"#bib65\">Shenoy et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib42a\">Marchese and Benovic, 2001</a> #885), or the receptor tyrosine kinases EGFR and FGFR-1 (<a href=\"#bib29\">Huang et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Haugsten et al., 2008</a>) does not abrogate their internalization. Instead, cargo ubiquitylation becomes critical later in the endocytic pathway, to promote cargo sorting towards late endosomes and their subsequent degradation (see for instance <a href=\"#bib47\">Miranda et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Kabra et al., 2008</a>). At endosomes, ubiquitinated cargoes are captured and sorted by ESCRT proteins (Endosomal Sorting Complex Required For Transport) into the lumen of the endosome through a process known as multivesicular body (MVB) biogenesis (<a href=\"#bib41\">MacGurn et al., 2012</a>). Loss of cargo ubiquitylation reportedly leads to their recycling to the cell surface (<a href=\"#bib65\">Shenoy et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Huang et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Haugsten et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Eden et al., 2012</a>).

In turn, activated Rod1 promotes the glucose-induced ubiquitylation and degradation of Jen1, a monocarboxylate transporter. However, the place where Rod1 regulates endocytosis is unknown. Whereas ART proteins are considered to promote transporter internalization (<a href=\"#bib1\">Becuwe et al., 2012a</a>), there are conflicting reports regarding the step at which they control intracellular trafficking (<a href=\"#bib24\">Helliwell et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Soetens et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Merhi and Andr\u00e9, 2012</a>).

Furthermore, it was reported that akin to the situation in mammalian cells, the yeast iron transporter complex Fet3/Ftr1 is internalized independently of its ubiquitylation, although the latter is required for its vacuolar targeting. This suggests a control of transporter degradation through a post-endocytic ubiquitylation event, for which the molecular actors are not known (<a href=\"#bib70\">Strochlic et al., 2008</a>)."

For this purpose, we monitored transporter trafficking in wild type (WT) and <i>rod1</i>\u0394 cells using two different cargoes, namely the glycerol/proton symporter Stl1, and the monocarboxylate transporter Jen1. Stl1 is expressed when cells are grown in glycerol/lactate medium, and endocytosed in response to glucose (<a href=\"#bib17\">Ferreira et al., 2005</a>). The glucose-induced endocytosis and degradation of Stl1 required Rod1, establishing Stl1 as a new Rod1-regulated cargo (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>), in addition to the previously described hexose transporter Hxt6 (<a href=\"#bib52\">Nikko and Pelham, 2009</a>) and Jen1 (<a href=\"#bib2\">Becuwe et al., 2012b</a>). We then performed time-lapse microscopy using a microfluidics device to precisely monitor Stl1-GFP localization immediately after glucose addition in WT and <i>rod1</i>\u0394 cells. Both strains were co-injected into the microfluidics chamber and observed simultaneously. Their identification was made possible by a pre-staining of the <i>rod1\u0394</i> cells with the vital dye CMAC. Whereas Stl1-GFP was internalized within 5 min after glucose addition in WT cells, it remained stably associated to the plasma membrane in the <i>rod1\u0394</i> mutant and was not internalized even 30 min after glucose treatment (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>).

We observed that, in sharp contrast with the result obtained for Stl1 (see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>), glucose triggered the transient localization of Jen1 to cytoplasmic puncta (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). The appearance of these puncta was strongly affected by latrunculin A treatment, which disrupts the actin cytoskeleton and abolishes endocytosis, indicative of their endocytic origin (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). This showed that Jen1 was still internalized in the <i>rod1\u0394</i> mutant. To evaluate the contribution of Rod1 in Jen1 internalization, we then quantitatively compared Jen1 trafficking in both WT and <i>rod1\u0394</i> cells using microfluidics (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>, <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>). First, we observed that the appearance of Jen1-positive vesicles was delayed in the <i>rod1\u0394</i> mutant as compared to the wild type (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>). This clearly showed that in the absence of Rod1, Jen1 internalization still occurred but was less efficient, which was also supported by the persistence of a Jen1-GFP pool at the plasma membrane in the <i>rod1\u0394</i> strain. A second observation was that whereas Jen1-GFP was targeted into larger and brighter structures (likely to be late endosomes) at later time points in the WT, it did not reach this compartment in the <i>rod1\u0394</i> mutant (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>, <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>) but rather re-localized to the plasma membrane, as described previously (<a href=\"#bib2\">Becuwe et al., 2012b</a>) (see also <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a> and <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). Because <i>JEN1</i> expression is repressed by glucose (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bojunga and Entian, 1999</a>), this plasma membrane-localized pool did not originate from de novo Jen1 synthesis, but rather from the recycling of internalized Jen1 back to the cell surface.

Indeed, the remnant internalization of Jen1 observed in the <i>rod1\u0394</i> mutant still required its ubiquitylation, as demonstrated through the use of a non-ubiquitylatable Jen1 mutant in which all cytosolic lysine residues have been mutated into arginine residues (Jen1-KR-GFP, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). As expected, these mutations abolished Jen1 ubiquitylation in response to glucose (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), but this construct was still functional, as judged by its ability to transport selenite, that can be used as a readout for Jen1 activity (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) (<a href=\"#bib45\">McDermott et al., 2010</a>). The visualization of the subcellular localization of Jen1-KR-GFP showed that it was indeed targeted to the plasma membrane, although it displayed a small delay in secretion as observed by its transient accumulation at the ER (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). More importantly, the endocytosis of Jen1-KR-GFP in response to glucose was abolished (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Since Jen1 was partially endocytosed in the absence of Rod1 (see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D,F,G</a>), we conclude that Jen1 can be ubiquitylated at the plasma membrane independently of Rod1, at least when Rod1 is absent. Consequently, it is likely that there are additional ubiquitylation systems besides Rod1 at the plasma membrane, which can promote Jen1 internalization and that remain to be identified. Of note, Jen1 was still internalized in the multiple <i>9-arrestin</i> mutant (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>), which lacks Rod1 and eight other arrestin-related proteins (<a href=\"#bib52\">Nikko and Pelham, 2009</a>). Altogether, these results show that the function of Rod1 at the plasma membrane is either compensated or is redundant with other adaptors, but that this is not the case regarding its post-endocytic function in Jen1 trafficking."

We tested Jen1 co-localization with either the endosomal marker Vps17-mCh, a component of the recycling complex Retromer (<a href=\"#bib63\">Seaman, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Strochlic et al., 2008</a>) or the TGN marker Sec7-mCh, two proteins that did not co-localize with each other in wild-type cells as determined in a control experiment (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Early after glucose treatment, the Jen1-GFP puncta co-localized nearly exclusively with Vps17-mCh, but this was followed by a partial co-localization with Sec7-mCh (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,C</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>, <a href=\"#media6\">Video 6</a>), showing that Jen1-GFP associates with the TGN after internalization. Although Jen1-GFP and Sec7-mCh sometimes appeared to be in adjacent structures, rather than completely overlapping, this was likely an artifact due to the fast mobility of TGN structures in yeast (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kojima et al., 2012</a>), which led to a small shift between the image acquisition in each channel. Indeed, the simultaneous observation of Sec7-mCh and Jen1-GFP using a microscope equipped with two cameras showed a complete overlap of these signals (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). The same co-localization analysis was carried out in the <i>rod1\u0394</i> mutant, and revealed that Jen1-GFP followed essentially the same route as in WT cells, although Jen1-GFP displayed a prolonged co-localization with Sec7-mCh (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,C</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s4\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplements 4, 5</a>, <a href=\"#media7\">Video 7</a>). This was not due to an indirect effect of <i>ROD1</i> deletion on organelle identity, because Vps17 and Sec7 were still observed in distinct compartments in the <i>rod1\u0394</i> strain (<a href=\"#fig4s6\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 6</a>). Therefore, Jen1 not only traffics to the TGN after internalization before it reaches the vacuole in wild-type cells, but also transiently accumulates at this compartment in the absence of Rod1."

Crude extracts from lactate-grown WT (ySL1150), <i>vps52</i>\u0394 (ySL1369) and <i>ypt6</i>\u0394 (ySL1175) cells expressing Jen1-GFP were prepared at the indicated times before and after glucose addition, and were immunoblotted with anti-GFP antibodies to reveal the full-length Jen1-GFP and its degradation product (free GFP).

Lactate-grown WT cells (ySL1165) or <i>ypt6\u0394</i> cells (ySL1526) expressing Jen1-GFP and Sec7-mCh were injected in a microfluidics device and imaged before (Lactate) and 15 min after glucose addition. Co-localization between Jen1-GFP and Sec7-mCh is indicated with arrowheads.

We notably used a mutant <i>(vps52\u0394</i>) of the Golgi-localized VFT (Vps Fifty-Three)/GARP (Golgi-associated retrograde protein) complex, involved in the fusion of vesicles of endosomal origin with the TGN (<a href=\"#bib10\">Conibear and Stevens, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Siniossoglou et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Siniossoglou and Pelham, 2001</a>) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). In this strain, Jen1 was internalized but accumulated into cytoplasmic puncta and failed to reach the vacuole (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). Similar results were obtained in other mutants affected in retrograde trafficking, such as mutants for the yeast Rab6 homologue, <i>ypt6\u0394</i>, or for components of its GEF (guanine nucleotide exchange factor), <i>rgp1</i>\u0394 and <i>ric1\u0394</i> (<a href=\"#bib67\">Siniossoglou et al., 2000</a>) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). Moreover, Jen1 degradation was strongly affected in these retrograde mutants upon glucose treatment (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>). As expected, in the <i>ypt6</i>\u0394 mutant, Jen1 no longer co-localized with the TGN (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>). Therefore, these data reveal that endosome-to-TGN trafficking is critical for the vacuolar sorting of Jen1 after its internalization, suggesting that a step in the post-endocytic of Jen1 occurs at the TGN, prior to its delivery to the vacuole."

As shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H</a>, the absence of the Gga1/Gga2 proteins did not reduce Jen1 internalization, but partially impaired its vacuolar targeting, leading to Jen1 recycling at the plasma membrane. Of note, Jen1-GFP co-localized more strongly with the TGN marker, Sec7-mCh, after endocytosis in the <i>gga1\u0394 gga2\u0394</i> mutant than in WT cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H,I</a>), thus mimicking the defects observed in the <i>rod1\u0394</i> mutant (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,C</a>). Again, this was not due to a defect in organelle identity caused by the deletion of the <i>GGA1</i> and <i>GGA2</i> genes because Sec7 and Vps17 appeared in distinct compartments in this strain (<a href=\"#fig4s7\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 7</a>). These results showed that TGN-to-endosome sorting is also critical for the post-endocytic targeting of Jen1 to the vacuole. Of note, we also obtained evidence that another transporter, the dicarboxylic amino acid transporter Dip5, also transiently co-localizes with the TGN during its substrate-induced endocytosis (<a href=\"#fig4s8\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 8</a>), and that its vacuolar sorting also depends on the Gga1/Gga2 proteins (<a href=\"#fig4s9\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 9</a>). Therefore, the post-endocytic control of transporter fate at the TGN is not restricted to Jen1 but is likely to be a more general mechanism."

Since we identified an additional role for Rod1, which we previously showed to be critical for Jen1 ubiquitylation, in Jen1 sorting at the TGN, we hypothesized that transporter ubiquitylation may be remodeled between these two locations. This was further suggested by the observation that in retrograde mutants, in which Jen1 is internalized but not degraded, Jen1 ubiquitylation disappeared over time after glucose addition (see <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>). Indeed, in the <i>vps52\u0394</i> mutant, in which Jen1 departs from the plasma membrane in response to glucose but cannot reach the TGN, we observed a sharp decrease in Jen1 ubiquitylation after 20 min of glucose treatment (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>; see also <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>). Because Jen1 expression is repressed by glucose (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bojunga and Entian, 1999</a>), the progressive loss of Jen1 ubiquitylated species was likely due to a deubiquitylation event occurring during the progression of Jen1 from the plasma membrane to the TGN. We then performed the same experiment in a <i>vrp1</i>\u0394 (<i>end5\u0394</i>) mutant, in which endocytosis is blocked due to the deletion of the gene encoding the yeast WASP-interacting protein (WIP) homologue, verprolin (<a href=\"#bib49\">Munn et al., 1995</a>). In this mutant, however, Jen1 displayed a robust ubiquitylation pattern, indicating that the disappearance of Jen1 ubiquitylated species was not due to an intrinsic lability of ubiquitin-conjugated Jen1, and that this remodeling occurred post-internalization (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>)."

In further support of an ubiquitylation event occurring at the TGN, we also observed a glucose-induced recruitment of the ubiquitin ligase Rsp5 to this compartment in response to glucose (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Using three-color imaging, we also showed a co-localization of Rsp5 with Jen1 and Rod1 at the TGN (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D,E</a>). Altogether, these data strongly suggest that Jen1 is ubiquitylated at the plasma membrane and is deubiquitylated after its internalization, and lead us to propose that a second, glucose-regulated ubiquitylation step at the TGN involving Rsp5 and Rod1 may control Jen1 progression from the TGN to the vacuole."

                                "text": "The yeast TGN is a well-established compartment from which cargoes can recycle to the plasma membrane (<a href=\"#bib27\">Holthuis et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Conibear et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Hettema et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Reggiori et al., 2003</a>). We thus reasoned that a control of the post-endocytic sorting of transporters at the TGN might allow transporter recycling to the cell surface upon the sudden disappearance of the signal triggering endocytosis. To test this prediction, we treated lactate-grown cells expressing Jen1-GFP with a short pulse of glucose (10 min), which was sufficient to drive Jen1-GFP internalization, and then followed Jen1-GFP trafficking upon glucose removal. Using this protocol, Jen1 redistributed back to the plasma membrane within 20 min (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>), showing that Jen1 endocytosis was reversible upon glucose removal. This change in localization coincided with a loss of Jen1 ubiquitylation, suggesting that a continuous presence of glucose is required for the persistent ubiquitylation of Jen1 and its degradation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). The same experiment performed in the <i>vrp1\u0394</i> mutant, in which endocytosis is blocked, also led to a loss of Jen1 ubiquitylation, showing it is not due to Jen1 degradation but rather to a rapid deubiquitylation event following glucose removal, regardless of Jen1 localization (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Of note, Jen1 no longer recycled to the plasma membrane in the <i>vps52\u0394</i> strain in these conditions (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a> and <a href=\"#media8\">Video 8</a>), indicating that Jen1 recycling requires a functional endosome-to-TGN retrograde pathway. This also confirmed that the signal recovered at the plasma membrane upon glucose removal in WT cells (see <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>) did not originate from Jen1 neosynthesis. Therefore, a second, glucose-based sorting event occurs after internalization and takes place at the TGN. Accordingly, Jen1 recycling led to its polarized redistribution to the cell buds (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a> and <a href=\"#media8\">Video 8</a>), similarly to the exocytic SNARE Snc1 and the chitin synthase Chs3, which localize to the cell membrane in a polarized fashion after endocytosis and recycling through the TGN (<a href=\"#bib27\">Holthuis et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Lewis et al., 2000</a>). Interestingly, Jen1 recycling to the cell membrane upon glucose removal also correlated with the loss of Rod1 localization at the TGN (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). Rod1 localization was indeed extremely responsive to glucose treatments, and applying repeated glucose/lactate cycles revealed a robust sensor-like response of Rod1 regarding its localization (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a> and <a href=\"#media9\">Video 9</a>) and post-translational modifications (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E,F</a>). Therefore, Jen1 ubiquitylation and endocytosis can be re-evaluated at the TGN after internalization upon disappearance of the endocytic stimulus, and this correlates with a rapid glucose-induced remodeling of Rod1 post-translational modifications and its redistribution from the TGN to the cytosol."

We used a galactose-inducible Jen1-GFP construct, which allows Jen1-GFP targeting to the cell surface in galactose medium (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib57\">Paiva et al., 2009</a>), and followed the effect of glucose during Jen1-GFP targeting to the membrane (see <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>, top).

In agreement with this hypothesis, a non-ubiquitylatable Jen1-KR-GFP construct (see <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>) was targeted to the plasma membrane despite the presence of glucose (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>), showing that Jen1 ubiquitylation is critical for its rerouting from the secretory pathway to the vacuolar pathway.

In the present study, the use of microfluidics-assisted live cell imaging allowed us to follow, for the first time, the dynamics of cargo trafficking in response to variations in the presence of the endocytic stimulus, as well as the localization of the ART protein Rod1 in these conditions. This revealed a dual function of the ART protein Rod1 in the control of transporter endocytosis and degradation by glucose availability (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>, left and middle panel). First, Rod1 exerts a function at the plasma membrane, as it is essential for the endocytosis of the glycerol/proton symporter Stl1, and required for the efficient internalization of Jen1 upon glucose treatment (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Second, Rod1 also controls transporter sorting after endocytosis, a step which takes place at the trans-Golgi network (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>, middle panel). Indeed, Jen1 localizes to the TGN after endocytosis, and both (i) the endosome-to-Golgi retrograde pathway and (ii) the Gga1/2-dependent, Golgi-to-vacuole pathway are required for the vacuolar delivery of Jen1, indicating a critical role for the TGN in transporter degradation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Moreover, we showed that the endocytosis of the unrelated amino acid transporter, Dip5, in response to its substrate also involves a step at the TGN as well as the GGA proteins. These results shed a new light on previous studies showing the involvement of GGA proteins in the endocytic trafficking of Gap1, the general amino-acid permease (<a href=\"#bib62\">Scott et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Lauwers et al., 2009</a>), which could be explained by a similar control of Gap1 fate at the TGN. The yeast TGN therefore appears as a critical organelle for the post-endocytic sorting of transporters. This new level of regulation provides an opportunity to re-evaluate, after internalization, the commitment of transporters to the degradation pathway. Indeed, upon glucose removal, we show that internalized Jen1 recycles to the cell surface after it has reached the TGN (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>; <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>, right panel)."

Although Rod1 interacts with Rsp5 (<a href=\"#bib2\">Becuwe et al., 2012b</a>), it is inactive (phosphorylated) and cytosolic. Middle, In the presence of glucose, Rod1 is activated by a protein phosphatase 1 (PP1)-dependent dephosphorylation and its subsequent Rsp5-mediated ubiquitylation (<a href=\"#bib2\">Becuwe et al., 2012b</a>). Rod1 promotes transporter internalization at the plasma membrane (1), but also localizes to the TGN (2). There, Rod1 controls the fate of internalized transporters that have been retrograde-trafficked by a VFT- and Ypt6-dependent pathway, and also that of transporters coming from the secretory pathway. Transporter sorting from the TGN to the vacuole requires Rod1 and the clathrin adaptors Gga1 or Gga2 (GGAs). Right, Upon glucose removal, shortly after endocytosis is initiated, Rod1 is rephosphorylated (likely by the kinase Snf1) (<a href=\"#bib2\">Becuwe et al., 2012b</a>), leading to Rod1 dissociation from the TGN and Jen1 recycling to the cell membrane."

Here, we propose that external signals can remodel transporter ubiquitylation at the TGN through the regulation of ART proteins, and therefore control transporter targeting towards the recycling or degradation pathways. Indeed, Jen1 ubiquitylation is highly dynamic and can be re-evaluated after internalization. Through the use of trafficking mutants, we observed a progressive loss of Jen1 ubiquitylation between the plasma membrane and the TGN, even in the presence of glucose (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>) suggesting that Jen1 ubiquitylation status is reset between these compartments, likely through the action of deubiquitylating enzymes that are yet to be identified. This may set the stage for a second Jen1 ubiquitylation event at the TGN, that would allow cells to control transporter progression to the vacuole in a glucose- and Rod1-dependent manner (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>, right panel). This is further suggested by the fact that Jen recycling upon glucose removal coincides with the loss of its ubiquitylation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Therefore, the continuous presence of glucose is not only required to trigger Jen1 internalization, but also to maintain Jen1 in the endocytic pathway and prevent its recycling. Altogether, our data shed light on the integrated nature of the endocytic decision, and the multiple places where signaling can impact on transporter sorting through the ART/Rsp5 network."

However, in this specific case, the way by which agonist exposure is perceived and conveyed to edit the ubiquitin signal on the cargo is not fully understood. Here, we propose that a glucose-induced recruitment of the arrestin-related protein Rod1 to the TGN curtails Jen1 recycling and promotes its vacuolar sorting, leading to its degradation. This re-localization relies on rapid glucose-induced changes in Rod1 post-translational modifications through a mechanism that we previously established (<a href=\"#bib2\">Becuwe et al., 2012b</a>), and both are reversible upon glucose removal (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D\u2013F</a>). The latter situation coincides with a loss of Jen1 ubiquitylation and its recycling, which may be caused by its inability to be re-ubiquitylated at the TGN because Rod1 is no longer at this compartment. The mechanism of the dynamic recruitment of Rod1 to the TGN will need to be further explored. Rod1 is so far the only arrestin-related protein shown to display a signal-induced localization to the TGN, although other arrestin-related proteins also localize to internal compartments at steady-state, such as the TGN or endosomes, both in yeast (<a href=\"#bib40\">Lin et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">O'Donnell et al., 2010</a>) and mammalian cells (<a href=\"#bib71\">Vina-Vilaseca et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Han et al., 2013</a>). We also showed a dynamic recruitment of Rsp5 to the TGN in response to glucose, which is line with our model of a re-ubiquitylation of Jen1 at the TGN after endocytosis. The previously reported interaction between Rsp5 and Sec7 (<a href=\"#bib13\">Dehring et al., 2008</a>) may provide insights into the molecular basis of Rsp5 recruitment to this organelle."

This may be critical to prevent neosynthesized cargoes transiting in the secretory pathway from reaching the cell surface in conditions that induce endocytosis. Intriguingly, the ART-related proteins Bul1 and Bul2 were shown to control the sorting of neosynthesized Gap1 between the Golgi and the vacuole (<a href=\"#bib24\">Helliwell et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Soetens et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Risinger and Kaiser, 2008</a>), and then later found to be involved in Gap1 down-regulation, suggestive of a role at the plasma membrane (<a href=\"#bib59\">Risinger and Kaiser, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Merhi and Andr\u00e9, 2012</a>). In the light of our data, it appears likely that the Bul1/Bul2 proteins may in fact act at the TGN to control both of these sorting events. The study of the subcellular localization of the Bul1/Bul2 proteins may provide important information in this regard. Interestingly, recent studies in the evolutionary distant yeast <i>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</i> also point to a role of the arrestin-related protein Any1 (also named Arn1) in transporter trafficking at multiple places in the cell (<a href=\"#bib50\">Nakase et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Nakashima et al., 2014</a>).

They notably contribute to epithelial cell polarity (<a href=\"#bib19\">Golachowska et al., 2010</a>) and membrane remodeling in neurons (<a href=\"#bib61\">Schmidt and Haucke, 2007</a>) but the regulation of cargo recycling is poorly understood at the molecular level (<a href=\"#bib43\">Maxfield and McGraw, 2004</a>). So far, a role of the TGN in cargo recycling has been only marginally studied (<a href=\"#bib12\">Csaba et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Escola et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Cheng and Filardo, 2012</a>). The finding that Ypt32, a yeast TGN-localized Rab protein involved in recycling from the TGN to the cell surface, localizes to recycling endosomes in mammalian cells and affects transferrin receptor recycling (<a href=\"#bib31\">Kail et al., 2005</a>) suggests that recycling from endosomes and the TGN may be evolutionary related. Our work in yeast further indicates that this may be an ancestral mode of regulation, and provides insights into the molecular mechanism by which it is achieved. This study also illustrates an underappreciated role of the TGN in the integrated regulation of recycling and secretion that should be considered for future studies."

The authors conclude that in this mutant, Jen1 is deubiquitinated whereas in the <i>gga1,2</i> double mutant Jen1 is not deubiquitinated. However, there appears to be a slight de-ubiqutination in the <i>gga1,2</i> double mutant. Given the vast different levels of protein expression, and use of the highly non-linear HRP detection method for western blots; this needs to be reconfirmed. It is suggested that the authors dilute the double mutant samples such that the 4h lactate signal of the two strains are equal and then analyzed the ubiquitination level of Jen1."

Thus, we have constructed an in-frame fusion of Jen1 with a non-cleavable (G76V mutant) ubiquitin moiety, under the control of an inducible promoter, in order to have a constitutively ubiquitylated Jen1 construct to monitor whether TGN trafficking and Rod1 are now dispensable. This proved to be tricky because of the toxicity of Jen1- containing constructs in bacteria (yeast shuttle vectors containing WT Jen1 considerably slow down bacteria growth, and the Jen1 - KR presented in the manuscript had to be constructed in yeast because it cannot be amplified in bacteria). We obtained only a few clones that were not rearranged. However, upon their transformation into yeast, we could not detect the expression of the construct, although the sequence was correct. Therefore, and unfortunately, we could not answer this question by this mean in the time allotted."

This revealed that Jen1 indeed accumulates in an ubiquitylated state in this strain suggesting that retaining Jen1 at the TGN leads to its massive ubiquitylation. Furthermore, through the use of a new strain bearing a triple <i>gga1</i>\u0394<i>gga2</i>\u0394 <i>ypt6</i>\u0394 deletion, we also demonstrate that this increased ubiquitylation depends on endosome-to-TGN trafficking (new <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). This shows that Jen1 ubiquitylation occurs after retrograde trafficking and further supports our model that the TGN is a site of ubiquitylation."

Previous studies have described a LatA-insensitive movement with a velocity of about 100 nm/sec (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kojima et al, 2012</a>. BBA 2012). We hypothesized that the slight shift between Jen1 and Sec7 mentioned by the Reviewer was due to the time needed between the acquisitions in each channel (exposure/acquisition + changing channel). Therefore, we used a spinning-disc confocal microscope equipped with two cameras, one for each channel, allowing the simultaneous imaging of the green and red signals (Revolution xD TuCam system, Andor), coupled to the microfluidics setup. As shown in the new <a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>, the co- localization between Sec7 and Jen1 now appears very clearly, indicating that the slight shift is likely an artifact due to the fast mobility of TGN structures. This has been discussed in the manuscript, in the relevant section."

Unfortunately, the fast mobility of TGN structures in the cell, mentioned above, has precluded us from doing kymographs because we cannot follow with certainty a single TGN structure. In our study, we use endogenously tagged proteins, some of which have a low expression level and/or are tagged with mCherry, which is less photostable than GFP. To be able to image cells for 30 min without too much bleaching, we chose a temporal resolution of 1 image/30 sec, and looked only at one focal plane. In these conditions, TGN structures constantly go in or out of focus, or completely change of localization within the cell between each image, making it impossible to track individual events. This is why we chose an alternative approach, in which we instead studied and quantified populations of puncta for co- labeling with Vps17 or Sec7 and Jen1, and that we think better reflects the situation, although in a less graphic manner."
