Although considerable interest exists in CDK9 as a therapeutic target, little progress has been made due to lack of highly selective inhibitors. Here, we describe the development of i-CDK9 as such an inhibitor that potently suppresses CDK9 phosphorylation of substrates and causes genome-wide Pol II pausing. While most genes experience reduced expression, MYC and other primary response genes increase expression upon sustained i-CDK9 treatment. Essential for this increase, the bromodomain protein BRD4 captures P-TEFb from 7SK snRNP to deliver to target genes and also enhances CDK9's activity and resistance to inhibition. Because the i-CDK9-induced MYC expression and binding to P-TEFb compensate for P-TEFb's loss of activity, only simultaneously inhibiting CDK9 and MYC/BRD4 can efficiently induce growth arrest and apoptosis of cancer cells, suggesting the potential of a combinatorial treatment strategy."

Here, we describe the development of i-CDK9 as such an inhibitor that potently suppresses CDK9 phosphorylation of substrates and causes genome-wide Pol II pausing. While most genes experience reduced expression, MYC and other primary response genes increase expression upon sustained i-CDK9 treatment. Essential for this increase, the bromodomain protein BRD4 captures P-TEFb from 7SK snRNP to deliver to target genes and also enhances CDK9's activity and resistance to inhibition. Because the i-CDK9-induced MYC expression and binding to P-TEFb compensate for P-TEFb's loss of activity, only simultaneously inhibiting CDK9 and MYC/BRD4 can efficiently induce growth arrest and apoptosis of cancer cells, suggesting the potential of a combinatorial treatment strategy."

One gene that is frequently mutated in many cancers encodes a protein called MYC. The activity of this gene is normally tightly controlled, but the mutations found in human cancer cells mean that this gene is constantly switched on, and so too much MYC protein is produced."

P-TEFb works with an enzyme called RNA polymerase II to copy the instructions contained in protein-coding genes into long molecules called messenger RNAs. This process is called transcription and it involves a number of stages. P-TEFb is needed to start of one these stages, which is known as the \u2018elongation\u2019 step."

Most of the P-TEFb complexes in a cell are held in an inactive form, in which the activity of the CDK9 subunit is suppressed. If CDK9 is active when it should not be, certain proteins\u2014including the MYC protein\u2014can be produced in abnormally high amounts. This means that inhibiting CDK9 has been investigated as one way to reduce the production of the MYC protein. While some CDK9 inhibitors already exist, these compounds have the undesirable effect of also inhibiting other related enzymes and thus killing normal cells. Hence, new and more selective inhibitors of CDK9 are urgently needed."

The experiments show that i-CDK9 can potently inhibit CDK9 activity; and in human cells, very low levels of i-CDK9 prevented RNA polymerase II carrying out elongation for many genes. Unexpectedly, Lu, Xue et al. observed that more messenger RNA molecules that encode MYC were produced after cells were treated with low levels of i-CDK9. Further investigation revealed that this unexpected result occurred because the P-TEFb complexes were released from the inactive form and brought to the MYC gene by another protein called BRD4. This stimulated production of the MYC messenger RNAs. When P-TEFb was bound by BRD4, the CDK9 activity was also protected against inhibition by i-CDK9. Moreover, the reason that the MYC expression was induced by i-CDK9 is because the cells can compensate for the loss of CDK9 by using MYC to maintain the production of messenger RNAs of many key genes; these genes include the gene for MYC itself. These results suggest that CDK9 and MYC must be simultaneously inhibited in order to effectively treat cancers."

The control frequently occurs at the level of transcription, where RNA polymerase (Pol) II is employed to execute a series of interconnected stages that collectively constitute the transcription cycle. In the past, the early stages of this cycle involving the recruitment of Pol II to gene promoters and assembly of active pre-initiation complexes were considered the primary step where transcription is controlled (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kuras and Struhl, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Ptashne, 2005</a>). However, recent evidence indicates that the subsequent stages are also frequently targeted to regulate gene expression. For example, genome-wide analyses from <i>Drosophila</i> to mammals have shown that promoter-proximal pausing of Pol II is a prevalent feature of many genes and that the regulated release of Pol II is essential for synchrony and robustness of their induction (<a href=\"#bib21\">Guenther et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Muse et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Zeitlinger et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Levine, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Zhou et al., 2012</a>)."

Among these, the CTD Serine-2 phosphorylation, which is a hallmark of productive elongation and RNA processing, is catalyzed by the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb), which is composed of CDK9 and its cyclin partner T1 (CycT1) or the minor forms T2a and T2b. Additionally, P-TEFb also phosphorylates the SPT5 subunit of DSIF and the NelfE subunit of NELF, which antagonizes the inhibitory actions of these two negative elongation factors and promotes the release of paused Pol II and transition into productive elongation (<a href=\"#bib67\">Zhou et al., 2012</a>)."

The published data indicate that BRD4 and its recruitment of P-TEFb to the MYC promoter region play a particularly important role in MYC expression in human cancer cells. JQ1 and iBET-151 are shown to bind to the BRD4 bromodomains and displace the BRD4-P-TEFb complex from acetylated chromatin to inhibit MYC transcription, which in turn induces differentiation and growth arrest of cancer cells (e.g., acute myeloid leukemia, multiple myeloma, and Burkitt's lymphoma) that are addicted to MYC (<a href=\"#bib17\">Filippakopoulos and Knapp, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Shi and Vakoc, 2014</a>)."

In support of this idea, a recent study implicates CDK9 inhibition as an effective therapeutic strategy for MYC-overexpressing liver tumors (<a href=\"#bib25\">Huang et al., 2014</a>). Although small molecule pan CDK inhibitors (e.g., flavopiridol and SNS-032) with potent anti-CDK9 activities already exist and have been valuable tools for exploring the functions of P-TEFb (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chao et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Chen et al., 2009</a>), they display pleiotropic effects indicative of interference with other cellular enzymes/pathways (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bible et al., 2000</a>).

Although the vast majority of genes display a drastic i-CDK9-induced reduction in gene expression, a small group of genes show a surprising increase in expression after the drug treatment, and the proto-oncogene MYC and several other key PRGs are among them. In the current study, we explore the molecular mechanism as well as biological significance of i-CDK9-induced MYC expression. Our data reveal the essential dual roles played by BRD4 in MYC induction and indicate that the elevated expression in i-CDK9-treated cells is part of the cellular compensation for the loss of CDK9. Because of this compensatory mechanism, our data demonstrate that the simultaneous inhibition of both CDK9's catalytic activity and MYC's expression or function causes synergistic induction of growth arrest and apoptosis of cancer cells."

Inhibition of phosphorylation of both Pol II CTD and SPT5 is expected to block transcriptional elongation, which will effectively decrease the production of labile proteins from short-lived transcripts. Indeed, correlating with the decrease in cellular levels of pSer2 and pThr775, i-CDK9 markedly down-regulated the expression of the short-lived anti-apoptotic protein MCL-1 and at the same time induced proteolytic cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), which is considered a major hallmark of apoptosis and caspase activation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Collectively, these data demonstrate that i-CDK9 is a highly potent and selective inhibitor of CDK9 that is able to elicit cellular responses indicative of P-TEFb inhibition."

Notably, the extent of the initial decrease and then subsequent induction of MYC mRNA production varied among the cell lines. For example, after 2 hr of i-CDK9 (0.5 \u00b5M) treatment, the MYC mRNA levels in U87MG (<i>MYC</i> copy number [CN] = 2) and HeLa (CN = 4) cells showed only a slight decrease compared to the DMSO control, whereas they were significantly reduced in A375 (CN = 2), NCIH441 (CN = 8), and A2058 (CN = 4) cells. Furthermore, the prolonged treatment for 8\u201316 hr caused the MYC mRNA to reach levels much higher than those in the control cells in all cell lines except NCIH441 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Despite these variations, which could well be caused by differences in MYC mRNA stability in difference cell lines, it is clear that the induction of MYC expression in response to prolonged CDK9 inhibition by i-CDK9 is a general phenomenon likely caused by a common mechanism independent of the MYC amplification/expression levels. In contrast to MYC, another short-lived gene HEXIM1, which was previously shown to depend on active CDK9 for expression (<a href=\"#bib24\">He et al., 2006</a>), was continuously suppressed throughout the entire 16 hr of i-CDK9 treatment in all five cell lines (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

The released P-TEFb then joins the bromodomain protein BRD4 to form the BRD4-P-TEFb complex for activation of many PRGs (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib67\">Zhou et al., 2012</a>). To determine whether i-CDK9 could also induce the transfer of P-TEFb from 7SK snRNP to BRD4, we examined the interactions of immunoprecipitated Flag-tagged CDK9 (CDK9-F) with HEXIM1, a signature component of 7SK snRNP, and BRD4 by Western blotting (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>).

One possible explanation for these seemingly contradictory observations is the above demonstrations that the MYC induction was highly sensitive and occurred at a i-CDK9 concentration lower and time point earlier than those required to completely abolish the nuclear CDK9 kinase activity. In addition to this kinetic advantage displayed by the very sensitive MYC induction process, we also investigated whether the i-CDK9-induced BRD4-P-TEFb binding could also directly affect the kinase activity of CDK9."

For example, in the absence of BRD4, it took only 4.4 \u00b1 0.7 nM i-CDK9 to achieve 50% inhibition of CDK9 (i.e., IC<sub>50</sub> = 4.4 \u00b1 0.7 nM). However, the addition of WT BRD4 into the reaction protected CDK9 against i-CDK9 and increased IC<sub>50</sub> to 14.7 \u00b1 2.1 nM. BRD4\u2206PID, on the other hand, displayed a much weaker effect by changing the IC<sub>50</sub> value to 7.2 \u00b1 0.6 nM (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4J</a>). These data indicate that the i-CDK9-mediated MYC induction benefited not only from efficient release of P-TEFb from 7SK snRNP, but the drug-enhanced BRD4-P-TEFb interaction can also directly promote CDK9's kinase activity and resistance to inhibition, in addition to its recruitment of more P-TEFb to the MYC locus."

The first noticeable major change caused by i-CDK9 is the significant increase in BRD4's occupancy across the entire MYC locus (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>), which explains why the MYC induction was highly sensitive to the BRD4 inhibitor JQ1 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>) and shBRD4 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Correlating with this increase and consistent with the i-CDK9-induced BRD4-P-TEFb interaction, there was also significantly elevated CDK9 binding to the MYC locus (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>).

Although the underlying mechanism for this increase is unclear, it explains well the drug-promoted BRD4 binding to the MYC locus. Interestingly, even at early time points of i-CDK9 treatment (0, 1 and 2 hr) when MYC transcription was yet to be induced, the acetylation state of the MYC promoter was already different from that of the HEXIM1 promoter. As shown in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>, the levels of both Ac-H3 and Ac-H4 at the MYC promoter began to increase at this early stage, with the more robust increase observed for Ac-H4. In contrast, at the HEXIM1 promoter, i-CDK9 caused a drastic decrease in the Ac-H3 level but a small increase of Ac-H4. As for the BRD4 level, it displayed a marked decrease at the MYC promoter at 1 hr post i-CDK9 treatment, but began to rebound by 2 hr. At the HEXIM1 promoter, however, it showed a sustained reduction throughout the entire period (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). It is likely that these early differences at the chromatin level predispose a transiently repressed gene such as MYC and a permanently repressed one such as HEXIM1 to completely different expression states later on during the i-CDK9 treatment."

Given the above demonstrations that BRD4 and its interaction with P-TEFb played an essential role in i-CDK9-induced MYC expression, we next investigated whether other BRD4-dependent primary response (BDPR) genes such as those identified in bone marrow-derived macrophages (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>; [<a href=\"#bib22\">Hargreaves et al., 2009</a>]) might behave similarly as MYC in their response to i-CDK9.

In contrast, a significant increase in TR was found for most of the remaining (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a> upper panel) or 23 randomly selected genes (lower panel) in the ChIP-seq database. A close examination of the distribution patterns of Pol II on three well-studied PRGs, MYC, FOS, and JUNB, which happen to be highly important proto-oncogenes, reveals that i-CDK9 caused a significant and fairly uniform increase in Pol II occupancy across the entire length of these genes (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E\u2013G</a>). Notably, the distribution of Pol II on MYC as revealed by ChIP-seq is remarkably similar to that obtained by the classic ChIP-qPCR (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). These results are not only consistent with the induced expression of these genes by i-CDK9, but also explain why their TR values underwent little change in the process. Taken in aggregate, the data so far strongly support the notion that the induced transfer of P-TEFb from 7SK snRNP to BRD4 and the BRD4-mediated protection and enhancement of P-TEFb's activity and recruitment to chromatin templates are the primary driving force behind the induction of MYC and other BDPR genes by i-CDK9."

Given that MYC induction was triggered by inhibition of cellular CDK9 kinase, we hypothesized that MYC may normally facilitate CDK9's function and that the elevated MYC expression in i-CDK9-treated cells is therefore a cellular attempt to compensate for the loss of CDK9. To test this hypothesis, we first determined whether the shRNA-mediated MYC KD would affect the global pSer2 levels before and after the treatment with i-CDK9. Indeed, even though the KD was incomplete, it markedly reduced pSer2 levels in both untreated cells as well as in cells exposed to a range of i-CDK9 concentrations (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>), revealing a requirement of MYC for CDK9 to phosphorylate the Pol II CTD under both normal and inhibitory conditions."

To test this hypothesis, we first performed cell proliferation assays and used the isobologram method to determine whether the combined effects of i-CDK9 and JQ1 were additive, synergistic, or antagonistic (<a href=\"#bib58\">Tallarida, 2006</a>). Data matrices were generated by measuring anti-proliferative effects (IC<sub>50</sub>) of i-CDK9 and JQ1 as a single agent or in combination on both HeLa and H1792, a non-small cell lung cancer cell line with significant MYC amplification (CN = 8).

Because of this, manipulation of cell cycle progression by means of small molecule inhibitors has long been suggested as a therapeutic avenue to cure these diseases especially cancer. There are now more than 50 pharmacological CDK inhibitors that have been described (<a href=\"#bib31\">Knockaert et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Fisher, 2010</a>). Among these, flavopiridol has been promoted as a potent inhibitor of CDKs with a notable bias for CDK9 (<a href=\"#bib52\">Senderowicz and Sausville, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Chao and Price, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Blagosklonny, 2004</a>). Treatment with flavopiridol has been shown to block cell cycle progression, promote differentiation, and induce apoptosis in various types of cancerous cells (<a href=\"#bib52\">Senderowicz and Sausville, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Blagosklonny, 2004</a>). However, as indicated in the current study, flavopiridol displayed only 2.9 to 28.6-fold lower inhibitory activity toward other CDK-cyclin pairs compared to CDK9-CycT1 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). This relatively weak selectivity for CDK9, coupled with the demonstrations that flavopiridol also binds strongly to duplex DNA (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bible et al., 2000</a>) and many other non-CDK kinases (<a href=\"http://www.discoverx.com/ReferenceTreeImages/Flavopiridol.htm\">http://www.discoverx.com/ReferenceTreeImages/Flavopiridol.htm</a>), raise the possibility that some of the effects attributed to this compound may not be caused by the inhibition of CDK9. Because simultaneous inhibition of both CDK9 and cell cycle CDKs makes the data interpretation difficult and confusing, a highly selective CDK9 inhibitor that can specifically block the P-TEFb-dependent elongation phase of Pol II transcription is thus very desirable and urgently needed. In this regard, the current development and characterization of i-CDK9, which demonstrated far superior selectivity against CDK9 than did flavopiridol, is both timely and valuable for our efforts to further investigate CDK9 biology as well as the therapeutic potential of P-TEFb inhibition."

As for MYC, although several mechanisms have been indicated as responsible for its elevated expression, including gene amplification, chromosomal translocation, and alteration of protein stability (<a href=\"#bib42\">Meyer and Penn, 2008</a>), the BRD4-dependent mechanism identified here and used by cells to up-regulate MYC and other PRGs in response to CDK9 inhibition represents a previously uncharacterized alternative method that appears to be equally effective in promoting MYC expression."

This result is consistent with the observations reported recently by the Geyer laboratory, which employed both the synthetic CTD peptides as well as the full-length human CTD containing all 52 repeats in the kinase assays (<a href=\"#bib27\">Itzen et al., 2014</a>).

It is interesting to note that the HIV-1 Tat protein appears to possess a similar ability to activate CDK9 upon binding to the isolated, recombinant P-TEFb (<a href=\"#bib20\">Garber et al., 2000</a>). While Tat is known to bind mostly to the surface of CycT1 (<a href=\"#bib50\">Schulze-Gahmen et al., 2014</a>), the PID appears to contact both CycT1 and CDK9 (<a href=\"#bib61\">Yang et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Itzen et al., 2014</a>). Thus, Tat and BRD4 PID may not contact P-TEFb in exactly the same manner. Despite this possible difference, the fact that the PID exhibits a sequence motif composition that is similar to that of Tat, and moreover, the conserved Tat-like motifs are also required for P-TEFb activation (<a href=\"#bib27\">Itzen et al., 2014</a>), suggests that the interaction of P-TEFb with either Tat or BRD4 PID may induce a similar conformational change that is beneficial for CDK9's interaction with substrates."

Given the fact that P-TEFb is a general transcription factor (<a href=\"#bib67\">Zhou et al., 2012</a>) and that MYC is traditionally viewed as a sequence-specific transcription factor existing in a heterodimer with MAX (<a href=\"#bib1\">Amati et al., 1993</a>), how is the elevated MYC level and binding to P-TEFb able to sustain the expression of a vast array of cellular genes that are normally dependent on P-TEFb for proper transcription (the current study and <a href=\"#bib10\">Chao and Price, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Shim et al., 2002</a>)? The answer to this question has recently come from studies showing that MYC is a transcriptional factor much more promiscuous in terms of the number and types of its target genes than what is suggested by the simple distribution and abundance of the MYC cognate sequence called the E-box in the genome."

Consistent with the idea that sequence-specific DNA binding is largely dispensable for most of MYC's transactivation function, the Price laboratory reported that the positions occupied by the MYC-MAX dimer across the human genome correlate with the Pol II transcription machinery rather than E-box elements (<a href=\"#bib48\">Pufall and Kaplan, 2013</a>). Furthermore, a significant percentage of MYC-MAX is located slightly upstream of nearly all the promoter-proximally paused Pol II. These results, together with the previous demonstrations that MYC can recruit P-TEFb to its target genes to activate Pol II transcriptional elongation (<a href=\"#bib29\">Kanazawa et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Rahl et al., 2010</a>), implicate a critical role for this transcription factor in globally controlling the release of Pol II from pausing. This general but hitherto unknown function of MYC also explains well our present observations that blocking MYC's expression by shMYC or JQ1 or inhibiting the MYC-MAX function by 10,058-F4 further exacerbated the i-CDK9-induced global decrease in Pol II CTD phosphorylation on Ser2 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A\u2013C</a>)."

These observations suggest the existence of a complementary and compensatory relationship between P-TEFb and MYC, and that the two transcription factors are likely part of a redundant mechanism used by cells to ensure optimal expression of key jointly controlled genes. Consistent with this idea, we show in the present study that simultaneous inhibition of CDK9's kinase activity and MYC's expression or function synergistically induced growth arrest and apoptosis of cancer cells. The importance of this result lies in its implication for future clinical applications of i-CDK9 and JQ1 or other BET bromodomain inhibitors. Since small molecule inhibitors such as i-CDK9 and JQ1, no matter how selective they are, will inevitably produce off-target effects when used at high concentrations, the demonstration that they can produce dramatic anti-tumor effects when used together at levels much lower than either alone holds the great promise of minimizing these unwanted off-target effects in future therapy."

Briefly, each CDK\u2013cyclin pair was pre-incubated with i-CDK9 for 15 min, followed by addition of kinase substrates (ELK for CDK1 and CDK2, RB for CDK4, and CDK7tide for CDK7 and CDK9). The mixture was incubated at room temperature for additional 4\u20135 hr. The reaction was stopped and read on Envision (PerkinElmer, Inc). Selectivity against a large panel of over 400 kinases was evaluated using the KINOMEscan platform (DiscoveRx, CA) employing a proprietary active site-directed competition binding assay (<a href=\"#bib16\">Fabian et al., 2005</a>). The assay was conducted at two different concentrations of i-CDK9 (1 and 10 \u00b5M) by DiscoveRx."

Briefly, HeLa cells treated with DMSO or 0.3 \u03bcM i-CDK9 for 8 hr were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min. Cross-linking was quenched by the addition of glycine (0.125 M) for 5 min. Fixed cells were collected and resuspended in SDS lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mM EDTA, 50 mM Tris, pH 8.1). Chromatin DNA was fragmented with the Covaris-S2 sonicator (Covaris, Inc.) in 30 s on/30 s off cycles for a total processing time of 30 min. Sonicated lysates derived from 2 \u00d7 10<sup>6</sup> cells were incubated overnight with 3 \u03bcg the indicated antibodies per reaction and followed by an 1-hr incubation with Dynabeads Protein A (Life Technologies). Immunoprecipitated DNA was purified by PCR Purification Kit (QIAGEN) and analyzed by qPCR. The sequences of the PCR primers used for amplification of the various MYC regions are listed below:"

MACS also generated read pileups, which were used to compute the traveling ratio (<a href=\"#bib49\">Rahl et al., 2010</a>). Specifically, Ref-Seq isoforms were used to compute the average read counts in a \u221230 bp to +300 bp window relative to the transcript start site (TSS). These were divided by the average read counts (TU) in the remaining gene body (+300 bp to end, including introns). To simplify analysis for regions with very low or zero read coverage, a small constant (BC; calculated as [total read counts \u00d7 read lengths]/genome size) that represents the average coverage genome-wide was also added in the calculation. TR was thus computed as TR = (TSS + BC)/(TU + BC). Isoforms were excluded from this analysis if they were shorter than 650 bp or if the interval of 30 bp upstream to end of gene didn't overlap with any of the MACS peaks called for that sample. Gene-level TR was computed by averaging the TRs of all isoforms of that gene. Pol II coverage of selected genes was visualized using custom python scripts (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>) to plot normalized coverage over entire gene length plus a margin that equal to 7% of the gene length on either end.

The authors describe a selective inhibitor of CDK9, and the evidence for selectivity is excellent (of course, not perfect). While, as expected, CDK9 inhibition generally inhibits Pol II release from the pause, they show that MYC and some other genes behave in the opposite fashion. They convincingly show that CDK9 inhibition leads to release of CDK9 from the 7SK snRNA, increased association with BRD4 leading to enhanced CDK9 kinase activity and resistance to inhibition. In addition, they show that increased MYC expression compensates for reduced CDK9 function and that simultaneous inactivation of MYC and CDK9 synergistically induces growth arrest. Taken together, this paper describes a new and potentially therapeutically useful inhibitor of CDK9, as well as a novel mechanistic and biological connection between MYC and CDK9. The paper is very well written."

At the majority of genes, treatment of cells with this compound, i-CDK9, has the predicted effects on Pol II distribution-increased promoter-proximal pausing and decreased occupancy over gene bodies-and on steady-state transcript levels, which are decreased. At a subset of genes, however, CDK9 inhibition had little effect on pausing (measured as the \u201ctraveling ratio\u201d or TR), and caused expression levels to increase. Among the genes that responded paradoxically was MYC, a key growth-promoting transcription factor. After transient repression by i-CDK9, levels of MYC transcription recover and then surpass levels in DMSO-treated cells. The authors show that i-CDK9 treatment causes 1) release of CDK9 from inhibitory 7SK RNA/HEXIM1 complexes; 2) increased association with the stimulatory/targeting partner BRD4; 3) enhanced occupancy of Pol II, BRD4 and CDK9 at the MYC gene; and 4) increased phosphorylation at Ser2 of the Pol II CTD on MYC. Paradoxically, increased expression of MYC induced by i-CDK9 appears to depend on CDK9 activity."

The demonstration that MYC can evade repression by i-CDK9 is interesting, but not entirely novel; differential sensitivity of specific genes to inhibitors of \u201cgeneral\u201d transcriptional functions has many precedents. This is MYC, so the mechanism of this evasion will be of significant interest to a wide audience, but the results presented here do not provide that mechanistic understanding. Why certain subpopulations of the released CDK9 would be resistant to such a potent inhibitor, or why certain loci might have an advantage in recruiting transcription machinery, including CDK9, under those conditions, is left unexplained.

I think the authors make a tactical error by choosing to focus nearly exclusively on the late (8-hr) time point when MYC transcription is maximally induced. The real clues to how MYC is being \u201cre-activated\u201d might be found by asking why the initial repression seen at 2 hr does not persist (in comparison with genes that are durably repressed by i-CDK9). Are there differences in the occupancy of transcription machinery at those genes? In chromatin modification patterns? For example, increased histone acetylation on MYC at later time points is not surprising, because transcription is elevated (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>), but analyzing such marks at 2 hr might be more informative as to the mechanism of activation."

The authors' analysis of this phenomenon is more detailed than most, but does not illuminate the mechanism, i.e., how lowered CDK9 activity feeds back on CDK9-regulatory pathways. It also raises another question: for all the apparent superiority of i-CDK9 to older drugs (lower IC50, fewer and less sensitive secondary targets), most of the results presented here could have (or have) been obtained with flavopiridol at similar doses. This extends to effects seen at cellular (PARP cleavage), genomic (increased TR) and biochemical levels (decreased Ser2 and Spt5 phosphorylation)."

I do not expect the authors to respond to this paper, but they should acknowledge that it exists and could explain some of the effects of i-CDK9 on Ser2 phosphorylation. It is quite likely, in my opinion, that no single kinase is responsible for any specific phosphorylation on Pol II in human cells, so whenever one sees disappearance of pSer2 (e.g. at i-CDK9 doses &gt; 300 nM in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>), it is likely to signify inhibition of multiple kinases. The flip side is that effects seen at lower doses are potentially due to incomplete inhibition of the intended target. This rather than the modest effects of BRD4-binding on CDK9 activity-the \u223c2-fold stimulation of kinase (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4I</a>) and \u223c3-fold increase in IC50 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4J</a>)-is probably why MYC expression can be induced by i-CDK9 even though it depends on CDK9 activity. I also disagree with the assertion (in the first paragraph of the subsection headed \u201cBinding of BRD4 to P-TEFb increases CDK9\u2019s catalytic activity and resistance to inhibition\u201d) that MYC induction is happening \u201cbefore\u201d CDK9 inactivation, because it rests on a false assumption: that decay of phospho-Ser2 and -Spt5 signals provides an instantaneous measurement of kinase activity in vivo. That is certainly not the case; even if no other kinase can phosphorylate these sites, the loss of phosphates will depend on activity of the phosphatases that remove them. To clarify the situation, I would ask a simple question: can MYC expression induced by 100-500 nM i-CDK9 be shut off by subsequent addition of the same drug at a higher dose?"

BRD4, CDK9 and Pol II are all increased, as expected. Why does the increase in CDK9 appear proportionately greater than that of BRD4, however, if the latter is needed to recruit the former? The authors also make the point that the pSer2 distribution is shifted towards the 3' end relative to that of CDK9, but this is consistent with many published results. What looks more noteworthy is the apparent shift of pSer2 towards the 5' end in the i-CDK9-treated cells relative to the DMSO-treated ones. To be sure that this is real, they would need to plot the pSer2:total Pol II ratio (which they should do in any case)."

Flavopiridol is a significant inhibitor of Cdk12, and if i-Cdk9 also blocks Cdk12, it would change the conclusions of the paper, and certainly invalidate using Ser2 phosphorylation as a marker for Cdk9 because Cdk12 is critical for cancer cell survival, the 'anti-cancer' effects of flavopiridol, and possibly also i-Cdk9, could have more to do with inhibition of Cdk12 than Cdk9."

Phosphorylation of Pol II CTD on Ser2 was detected by Western blotting with the pSer2-specific antibody. Two different sources of materials were tested in separate experiments in order to ensure the consistency of the observations. First, Flag-tagged CDK12 (CDK12-F) and CDK9 (CDK9-F) affinity-purified from transfected HeLa cells were tested in kinase reactions shown in new <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>. While CTD phosphorylation by CDK9-F was efficiently inhibited by i-CDK9 with an estimated IC50 of 2 nM under the current experimental conditions, no obvious inhibition of CDK12-F was detected even at 80 nM of the drug. Next, the sensitivity of the two kinases to i-CDK9 was also compared in kinase reactions containing the baculovirus-produced recombinant CDK9-CycT1 and CDK12-CycK (SignalChem). As shown in new <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2013figure supplement 1</a>, while Ser2 phosphorylation by CDK9-CycT1 was mostly inhibited by 80 nM i-CDK9, CDK12-CycK was not significantly inhibited until 640-1,200 nM i-CDK9 was added into the reactions (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2013figure supplement 1</a>).

I do not expect the authors to respond to this paper, but they should acknowledge that it exists and could explain some of the effects of i-CDK9 on Ser2 phosphorylation. It is quite likely, in my opinion, that no single kinase is responsible for any specific phosphorylation on Pol II in human cells, so whenever one sees disappearance of pSer2 (e.g. at i-CDK9 doses &gt; 300 nM in</i> <a href=\"#fig1\"><i>Figure 1C</i></a><i>), it is likely to signify inhibition of multiple kinases.

Indeed, in our own hands, knockdown of both CDK9 and CycT1 (\u223c10% CDK9 and 50% CycT1 remained in KD cells) caused only a partial reduction of the global pSer2 level (<a href=\"#fig9\">Author response image 2</a> Panel A; \u223c30% remaining). However, when we looked at what was happening to the remaining CDK9 in the KD cells by measuring the signature 7SK snRNP component HEXIM1 and the signature Super Elongation Complex (SEC) components AFF4 and ELL2 that were associated with the immunoprecipitated CDK9 (<a href=\"#fig9\">Author response image 2</a> Panel B), we think we know the reason behind the partial pSer2 reduction. When the CDK9 signals were adjusted to a similar level (the CDK9 level in the KD cells was very low; and we had to use many times more the KD cells than the control in order to get a comparable CDK9 signal), it is obvious from the co-IP/Western analysis (Panel B) that there was a dramatic shift of P-TEFb from the 7SK snRNP to the SEC under the KD conditions. Since the vast majority of P-TEFb (up to 90% by some estimations) is normally sequestered in the 7SK snRNP, this shift basically has converted all the remaining P-TEFb into the active SEC complex. Thus, although the KD has significantly decreased the overall P-TEFb level in vivo, it failed to completely eliminate the active form of P-TEFb due to the drastic P-TEFb mobilization that was happening inside the cell, which allowed the detection of still a decent level of global pSer2 under these conditions."

The authors show that i-Cdk9 has fewer off-target effects than flavopiridol, but this paper ignores whether or not i-Cdk9 affects Cdk12 kinase activity. Flavopiridol is a significant inhibitor of Cdk12, and if i-Cdk9 also blocks Cdk12, it would change the conclusions of the paper, and certainly invalidate using Ser2 phosphorylation as a marker for Cdk9 because Cdk12 is critical for cancer cell survival, the 'anti-cancer' effects of flavopiridol, and possibly also i-Cdk9, could have more to do with inhibition of Cdk12 than Cdk9</i>."
