In this study, we show that the capsule of the synchronizable model bacterium <i>Caulobacter crescentus</i> is cell cycle regulated and we unearth a bacterial transglutaminase homolog, HvyA, as restriction factor that prevents capsulation in G1-phase cells. This capsule protects cells from infection by a generalized transducing <i>Caulobacter</i> phage (\u03c6Cr30), and the loss of HvyA confers insensitivity towards \u03c6Cr30. Control of capsulation during the cell cycle could serve as a simple means to prevent steric hindrance of flagellar motility or to ensure that phage-mediated genetic exchange happens before the onset of DNA replication. Moreover, the multi-layered regulatory circuitry directing HvyA expression to G1-phase is conserved during evolution, and HvyA orthologues from related <i>Sinorhizobia</i> can prevent capsulation in <i>Caulobacter</i>, indicating that alpha-proteobacteria have retained HvyA activity."

In this study, we show that the capsule of the synchronizable model bacterium <i>Caulobacter crescentus</i> is cell cycle regulated and we unearth a bacterial transglutaminase homolog, HvyA, as restriction factor that prevents capsulation in G1-phase cells. This capsule protects cells from infection by a generalized transducing <i>Caulobacter</i> phage (\u03c6Cr30), and the loss of HvyA confers insensitivity towards \u03c6Cr30. Control of capsulation during the cell cycle could serve as a simple means to prevent steric hindrance of flagellar motility or to ensure that phage-mediated genetic exchange happens before the onset of DNA replication. Moreover, the multi-layered regulatory circuitry directing HvyA expression to G1-phase is conserved during evolution, and HvyA orthologues from related <i>Sinorhizobia</i> can prevent capsulation in <i>Caulobacter</i>, indicating that alpha-proteobacteria have retained HvyA activity."

The underlying mechanisms include direct uptake of naked DNA (transformation) by bacterial cells as well as cell- or bacteriophage-based delivery systems (respectively conjugation and generalized transduction) (<a href=\"#bib77\">Wiedenbeck and Cohan, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Seitz and Blokesch, 2013</a>). Thus, uncovering mechanisms that curb genetic exchange could provide new entry points to help intervene with the spread of antibiotic resistances. While genetic exchange can be facilitated in response to changes in the number of cells in a population (quorum sensing) or other developmental states (<a href=\"#bib58\">Seitz and Blokesch, 2013</a>), an important but yet unresolved question is whether genetic exchange can also be regulated by systemic cues, such as those directing cell cycle progression. Recent cytological experiments provide evidence that components of the pneumococcal natural transformation (competence) machinery can be linked to cell division, at least spatially (<a href=\"#bib4\">Berg\u00e9 et al., 2013</a>), hinting that unknown mechanisms may indeed restrict genetic exchange in time or in space during the progression of the cell division cycle. A myriad of events are coordinated with progression through the eukaryotic cell cycle, but our understanding of such mechanisms and the factors that constrain them during the bacterial cell cycle are sparse."

As virulence regulators have recently been found to control bacterial cell cycle transcription (<a href=\"#bib25\">Fumeaux et al., 2014</a>), capsulation might also be regulated by the cell cycle. The synchronizable and capsulated alpha-proteobacterium <i>Caulobacter crescentus</i> (henceforth <i>Caulobacter</i>) is the pre-eminent model system for cell cycle studies (<a href=\"#bib55\">Ravenscroft et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Skerker and Laub, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Curtis and Brun, 2010</a>). It recently transpired that many of the emerging concepts of cell cycle control, and the underlying mechanisms such as those directing an asymmetric cell division (<a href=\"#bib30\">Hallez et al., 2004</a>), are also operational in other alpha-proteobacterial lineages (<a href=\"#bib36\">Kobayashi et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Brilli et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Ardissone and Viollier, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Pini et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Fumeaux et al., 2014</a>). In <i>Caulobacter</i> this asymmetric cell division yields a motile and piliated swarmer (SW) cell that is in a G1-arrested state and a sessile stalked (ST) cell that resides in S-phase (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). The cellular buoyancy of the latter is higher than the former, a feature that has been exploited for synchronization of <i>Caulobacter</i> populations (by density gradient centrifugation) (<a href=\"#bib23\">Ely, 1991</a>) for cell cycle studies. A vast number of transcripts are cell cycle-regulated in <i>Caulobacter</i> (<a href=\"#bib37\">Laub et al., 2000</a>) and in the alpha-proteobacterium <i>Sinorhizobium meliloti</i> (<a href=\"#bib18\">De Nisco et al., 2014</a>), a plant symbiont. Importantly, many transcripts of orthologous genes are cell cycle-regulated and this is in large part governed by the conserved and essential <span class=\"underline\">c</span>ell cycle <span class=\"underline\">tr</span>anscriptional regulator A (CtrA). CtrA activates transcription of many late S- and G1-phase genes that are repressed by the transcriptional regulators SciP or the MucR1/2 paralogs, respectively (<a href=\"#bib25\">Fumeaux et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Gora et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Tan et al., 2010</a>)<i>.</i> In addition to acting as a transcriptional activator, CtrA functions as a negative regulator of gene expression and DNA replication initiation by binding to the conserved 5\u2032-TTAA-(N)<sub>7</sub>-TTAA-3\u2032 motif (CtrA box) located in many <i>Caulobacter</i> and <i>Sinorhizobium</i> promoters (<a href=\"#bib37\">Laub et al., 2000</a>, <a href=\"#bib38\">2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Fumeaux et al., 2014</a>) and the <i>Caulobacter</i> origin of replication (<i>Cori</i>) (<a href=\"#bib51\">Quon et al., 1998</a>)."

Specifically, we recovered Tn insertions in genes predicted to encode a homolog of the putative N-acetyl-L-fucosamine transferase WbuB from <i>E. coli</i> that is involved in O-antigen (O26) synthesis (<a href=\"#bib20\">D'Souza et al., 2002</a>) (<i>CCNA_03998</i>), a polysaccharide polymerase (<i>CCNA_00470</i>) and a GDP-L-fucose synthase (<i>CCNA_00471</i>). The three genes are near other coding sequences for polysaccharides biosynthesis proteins, including two other putative glycosyltransferases (<i>CCNA_00466</i> and <i>CCNA_00469</i>), a Wzx-like polysaccharide flippase/translocase (<i>CCNA_00467</i>) and a sugar mutase homolog (<i>CCNA_00465</i>) (<a href=\"#bib42\">Marks et al., 2010</a>). Consistent with a previous genome-wide Tn analysis showing that these genes cannot be disrupted (<a href=\"#bib14\">Christen et al., 2011</a>), we were unable to engineer in-frame deletions in <i>CCNA_00466</i> or <i>CCNA_00467</i> in the absence of a complementing plasmid. As the entire 26-kb MGE is dispensable for viability, it appears that inactivation of either one of these four genes results in synthetic toxicity due to a polysaccharide intermediate or the sequestration of Und\u223cP that is also required for peptidoglycan synthesis (<a href=\"#bib79\">Yother, 2011</a>). To confirm that <i>CCNA_03998</i>, <i>CCNA_00470</i>, and <i>CCNA_00471</i> are indeed buoyancy determinants, we engineered in-frame deletions in <i>CCNA_03998</i> or <i>CCNA_00470</i> (<i>CCNA_00471</i> was not tested) in <i>WT</i> or \u0394<i>pleC</i> mutant cells and found the resulting single or double mutants to be \u2018heavy\u2019 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1C and 2A</a>, <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>)."

Indeed, all \u2018heavy\u2019 mutants exhibited a non-mucoid (\u2018rough\u2019) colony phenotype on PYE agar plates supplemented with 3% sucrose, while the <i>WT</i> or \u2018light\u2019 mutants (\u0394<i>pleC)</i> had a mucoid (\u2018smooth\u2019) colony appearance (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>, <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). In support of this result, we purified capsule from <i>WT Caulobacter</i>, \u0394<i>CCNA_00163</i> (\u2018heavy\u2019 and \u2018rough\u2019), \u0394<i>CCNA_00166</i> (\u0394<i>hvyA</i>, \u2018light\u2019 and \u2018smooth\u2019), and \u0394<i>hvyA</i> \u0394<i>CCNA_00163</i> (\u2018heavy\u2019 and \u2018rough\u2019, see below) cells. As the <i>Caulobacter</i> capsule is primarily composed of neutral monosaccharides including fucose, mannose, galactose, and glucose (<a href=\"#bib55\">Ravenscroft et al., 1991</a>), we used glycosyl compositional analysis as proxy to quantify capsular material from \u2018heavy\u2019 and \u2018light\u2019 strains (See \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). As shown in <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>, the expected sugars (determined as % of total carbohydrate weight in the preparations) were abundant in preparations from the <i>WT</i> and the \u2018light\u2019 mutant (\u0394<i>hvyA</i>, <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a><i>),</i> whereas those from the \u2018heavy\u2019 mutants (i.e. the \u0394<i>CCNA_00163</i> single mutant and the \u0394<i>hvyA</i> \u0394<i>CCNA_00163</i> double mutant) contained far less fucose, galactose, and mannose (up to 37-fold, 23-fold, and 5.5-fold reductions, respectively, in the \u0394<i>hvyA</i> \u0394<i>CCNA_00163</i> double mutant compared to the \u0394<i>hvyA</i> single mutant). We also observed a significant reduction in galacturonic acid in the preparations from the \u2018heavy\u2019 mutants vs <i>WT</i> or \u2018light\u2019 cells<i>,</i> raising the possibility that this saccharide is also a constituent of the NA1000 capsule (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>)."

By contrast division of <i>WT</i> yields one piliated, motile, and non-capsulated (\u2018heavy\u2019) G1-phase SW progeny and one capsulated (\u2018light\u2019) S-phase ST cell (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>)."

                                "text": "If PleC indeed restricts capsulation temporally, it might control expression of a negative regulator of capsulation. Interestingly, PleC is required for the accumulation of the transcript of <i>CCNA_00166</i> (referred to as <i>hvyA</i> due to its requirement to render cells \u2018heavy\u2019) (<a href=\"#bib13\">Chen et al., 2006</a>). The <i>hvyA</i> transcript peaks during the G1-phase and encodes a 272-residue protein (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>) harbouring a classical N-terminal Sec-dependent <span class=\"underline\">s</span>ignal <span class=\"underline\">s</span>equence (SS), but lacking discernible hydrophobic sequences or a lipidation signal for retention in the membrane, suggesting that it is periplasmic. The C-terminal part of HvyA features a BTLCP domain. This domain is thought to introduce intra- or inter-molecular crosslinks by transamidation, forming \u03b3-glutamyl-\u03b5-lysine isopeptide bonds between Gln and Lys residues, to hydrolyse amide bonds by the reverse protease reaction and/or to execute deamidation/esterification reactions of glutamine residues (<a href=\"#bib41\">Lorand and Graham, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Ginalski et al., 2004</a>). Cysteine proteases typically feature a Cys-His-Asp catalytic triad (C192, H226, and D241 for HvyA, based on sequence alignment, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) for the formation of a thioester bond intermediate by the reaction of the active site thiol (from the Cys) with Gln, followed by the transfer of the acyl group to an amine substrate (from the Lys) (<a href=\"#bib41\">Lorand and Graham, 2003</a>). As an in-frame deletion in <i>hvyA</i> (\u0394<i>hvyA</i>) phenocopied the buoyancy defect of \u0394<i>pleC</i> cells (yielding exclusively \u2018light\u2019 mucoid cells, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1b, 2a, 2b</a>), we conclude that HvyA is required for capsule-mediated buoyancy control in <i>Caulobacter</i>. While expression of <i>WT</i> HvyA from P<sub><i>van</i></sub> (pMT335-<i>hvyA</i>) reversed the buoyancy defect of \u0394<i>hvyA</i> and \u0394<i>pleC</i> cells, analogous plasmids encoding the predicted catalytic mutants (C192S/A, H226Q/A, or D241A) were unable to do so, although all the HvyA variants accumulated to comparable steady-state levels as the <i>WT</i> protein on immunoblots (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Thus expression of catalytically active HvyA is necessary and sufficient to mitigate the buoyancy defect of \u0394<i>pleC</i> cells. As a genetic selection for \u2018heavy\u2019 \u0394<i>hvyA</i>::Tn mutants was answered by Tn insertions in the same genes that render \u0394<i>pleC</i> cells \u2018heavy\u2019 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>), we reasoned that mutations in capsule synthesis and export genes are epistatic to both the \u0394<i>hvyA</i> and \u0394<i>pleC</i> mutations. To confirm this notion, we engineered \u0394<i>hvyA</i> \u0394<i>CCNA_00163,</i> \u0394<i>hvyA</i> \u0394<i>CCNA_00167,</i> and \u0394<i>hvyA</i> \u0394<i>CCNA_00470</i> double mutants as well as a \u0394<i>pleC</i> \u0394<i>hvyA</i> \u0394<i>CCNA_00167</i> triple mutant and found all resulting mutants to be \u2018heavy\u2019 and non-mucoid (\u2018rough\u2019) on PYE sucrose plates (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A, B</a> and <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary File 1</a>). Importantly, constitutive expression of HvyA (from a P<sub>van</sub>- or a P<sub>xyl</sub>-plasmid) in <i>WT</i>, \u0394<i>pleC,</i> or \u0394<i>hvyA</i> cells also renders cells \u2018heavy\u2019 and \u2018rough\u2019 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). On the basis of these findings we hypothesized that HvyA is a G1-specific negative regulator of capsulation whose expression is dependent on PleC (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>)."

                                "text": "As all previous efforts to visualize the capsule directly by light or electron microscopy had been unsuccessful (<a href=\"#bib55\">Ravenscroft et al., 1991</a>), we conducted negative stain fluorescence microscopy (FM) with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-coupled dextran to measure the zone of exclusion of FITC-dextran in capsulated (\u0394<i>hvyA</i>, \u2018light\u2019 mucoid) and non-capsulated (\u0394<i>CCNA_00163</i>, \u2018heavy\u2019 non-mucoid) cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>). Akin to the difference between capsulated and non-capsulated <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i> (<a href=\"#bib31\">Hathaway et al, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Schaffner et al, 2014</a>), the zone of exclusion of FITC-dextran was significantly smaller in the case of \u0394<i>CCNA_00163</i> compared to \u0394<i>hvyA</i> cells, although the actual size of the cells by differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy was comparable (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). The increase in the exclusion radius of the dextran polymer can be explained by the presence of a capsule on \u0394<i>hvyA</i> cells and by its absence from \u0394<i>CCNA_00163</i> cells. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) (<a href=\"#bib21\">Dufr\u00eane, 2014</a>) provided additional support for this interpretation. In these experiments, bacteria were immobilized on porous membranes, a method allowing AFM imaging of the bacteria in liquid medium. However, recording reliable images of live cells turned out to be very difficult for two reasons: (i) most cells were detached or pushed aside during scanning; (ii) strong interactions between the tip and the soft bacterial surface led to fuzzy images that were difficult to interpret. Therefore, cells were imaged after fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde, a protocol that is known to preserve cellular structures (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chao and Zhang, 2011</a>). <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013D</a> shows representative low-resolution deflection images of fixed cells from the \u0394<i>CCNA_00163</i> and \u0394<i>hvyA</i> strains (from two independent preparations for each). As opposed to \u0394<i>CCNA_00163</i> cells, which were readily imaged without apparent cell surface damage (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>), the surface morphology of \u0394<i>hvyA</i> cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>) was strongly altered by the scanning tip, and showed streaks in the scanning direction, reflecting strong interactions between the tip and the soft cell surface. Similar trends were observed when recording high-resolution images on top of individual cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E\u2013H</a>). While the surface of \u0394<i>CCNA_00163</i> cell was smooth (surface roughness on 0.06 \u00b5m<sup>2</sup> areas of \u223c0.9 nm) and featureless, \u0394<i>hvyA</i> cells were rougher (roughness of \u223c2.2 nm) and showed streaks in the scanning direction, suggesting that soft, loosely bound material was pushed away by the tip. In light of earlier AFM studies (<a href=\"#bib17\">Dague et al., 2008</a>), we note that such smooth and rough morphologies are consistent with the presence of crystalline-like arrays of proteins and of an amorphous layer of polysaccharides, respectively."

Using a <i>lacZ</i>-based promoter-probe reporter in which the <i>hvyA</i> promoter is transcriptionally fused to the <i>lacZ</i> gene (P<sub><i>hvyA</i></sub>-<i>lacZ</i>), we found that P<sub><i>hvyA</i></sub> is indeed positively dependent on PleC (41.1 \u00b1 6.0% of <i>WT</i> activity, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>).

Consistent with the fact that PleC and DivJ regulate CtrA\u223cP levels, our recent chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled to deep-sequencing (ChIP-Seq) analyses indicated that CtrA indeed binds the <i>hvyA</i> promoter (P<sub><i>hvyA</i></sub>) and that this binding is strongly diminished in \u0394<i>pleC</i> cells (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

By contrast, P<sub><i>hvyA</i></sub>-<i>lacZ</i> is strongly de-repressed (574 \u00b1 30% of <i>WT</i> activity, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>) in the absence of the paralogous repressors MucR1 and MucR2 (\u0394<i>mucR1/2)</i> that directly bind P<sub><i>hvyA</i></sub> (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>, <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) and that silence many promoters of G1-phase genes (i.e. those that are activated by CtrA\u223cP after compartmentalization (<a href=\"#bib25\">Fumeaux et al., 2014</a>)). Thus, CtrA\u223cP and MucR1/2 directly activate and repress P<sub><i>hvyA</i></sub>, respectively (see <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). Consistent with the latter, MucR1/2 also represses P<sub><i>hvyA</i></sub>-<i>lacZ</i> activity in \u0394<i>pleC</i> cells over-expressing <i>WT</i> or a phosphomimetic variant (D51E) of CtrA (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Thus, <i>hvyA</i> (and other genes whose transcripts peak in G1, such as <i>pilA</i> and <i>sciP</i>) is expressed from a promoter that is temporally confined during the cell cycle via activation and repression by PleC/CtrA\u223cP and MucR1/2, respectively."

This prediction was based on the strong de-repression of P<sub><i>hvyA</i></sub> in the absence of MucR1/2 observed above and our result that overexpression of HvyA renders <i>Caulobacter</i> cells \u2018heavy\u2019.

To this end, we exploited the HvyA overexpression phenotype to seek HvyA mutant derivatives with impaired function. Briefly, a plasmid (pUG52) expressing a HvyA-derivative with a C-terminal TAP (<span class=\"underline\">t</span>andem <span class=\"underline\">a</span>ffinity <span class=\"underline\">p</span>urification) tag (<a href=\"#bib49\">Puig and et al., 2001</a>) under the control of P<sub><i>van</i></sub> was subjected to random mutagenesis and subsequently introduced into the <i>WT</i> and the \u0394<i>hvyA</i> mutant strain. Whereas this plasmid normally renders cells \u2018heavy\u2019 (non-capsulated) due to overexpression of HvyA-TAP, serial enrichment of the mutant pool by density gradient centrifugation led to recovery of \u2018light\u2019 mutants (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Following immunoblotting of candidate strains for those still overexpressing HvyA-TAP (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>), we recovered a number of mutants with single amino acid substitutions within the BTLCP domain of HvyA. Among these variants we recovered mutants in or very close to the putative catalytic site (H226Y, D194G, L240R), as well as mutations in conserved (W178S), similar (R161P) or non-conserved (P263R) residues throughout the BTLCP domain (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). While the isolation of the mutations in the catalytic centre validated the forward genetic screen, upon re-testing the mutants three of them (R161P, D194G, and P263R) exhibited complete loss-of-function with respect to buoyancy but only partial loss-of-function with respect to \u03c6Cr30 sensitivity under conditions of maximal induction of the P<sub><i>van</i></sub> promoter on the plasmid. In fact, these mutants were able to support replication of \u03c6Cr30 (as shown by cells lysis in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>), indicating that they are indeed partially functional and that the \u03c6Cr30 spot assay is much more sensitive as readout, possibly because localized breaches in the capsule are sufficient to promote \u03c6Cr30 infection at a high multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.). By contrast, the other missense mutants from the screen (W178S, H226Y, and L240R) neither restored \u03c6Cr30-sensitivity nor buoyancy (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>). To confirm that mutations in the BTLCP do not affect sorting to the periplasm, we released periplasmic components by treating cells with EGTA (<span class=\"underline\">e</span>thylene-<span class=\"underline\">g</span>lycol-<span class=\"underline\">t</span>etraacetic <span class=\"underline\">a</span>cid), which is known to destabilize the outer membrane (<a href=\"#bib54\">Raetz et al., 2007</a>).

An inhibitor of encapsulation, HvyA ensures that G1 cells are capsule-less and that upon its elimination during the G1\u2192S transition encapsulation can commence. In light of this first demonstration of cell cycle-regulated capsulation and the importance of capsule in masking, preventing, or impeding immune responses in bacterial pathogens, our results raise the intriguing possibility of targeting specifically the G1-phase regulatory hierarchy to combat bacterial infections by crippling encapsulation mechanisms. This can be achieved either by inhibiting capsular functions such as export or biosynthesis or, alternatively, by potentiating or sustaining the action of capsule inhibitors, such as <i>Caulobacter</i> HvyA, throughout the cell cycle. Our genetic dissection of the regulatory complexity underlying HvyA synthesis, involving cell cycle-controlled transcription and translation, provides a possible entry point for achieving such dysregulation to prevent capsulation. Noteworthy are our results showing that the mechanisms directing <i>hvyA</i> transcription in G1-phase are also operational in other alpha-proteobacteria. Interference with HvyA proteolysis at the G1\u2192S transition presents another strategy to obtain capsule-less cells. However, possible strategies in doing so await the identification of the periplasmic protease responsible for the proteolytic degradation of HvyA."

As the G1-specific inhibition of capsulation by HvyA is released with the removal of HvyA during the G1\u2192S transition, the nascent S-phase cells are protected from infection by \u03c6Cr30. As \u03c6Cr30 is a generalized transducing bacteriophage, this temporal confinement of capsulation also has the consequence of limiting \u03c6Cr30-mediated horizontal exchange of genetic material to SW cells."

In <i>Caulobacter</i>, the HvyA coding sequence is embedded in the CPS export locus, but in other alpha-proteobacteria HvyA-like BTLCPs appear to be encoded in other genomic context(s), so they probably affect also phenotypes unrelated to surface polysaccharides, mucoidy, and/or buoyancy. However, BTLCPs are predicted to have signal sequences for export into the periplasm and are often encoded in the vicinity of trans-envelope transport systems or enzymes predicted to act in the periplasm, suggesting that they act on periplasmic or extra-cytoplasmic targets. Consistent with an enzymatic activity, mutations in predicted catalytic residues of HvyA abrogate function and we were able to demonstrate limited promiscuity among HvyA, NGR_c12490, and SMc00998 <i>in vivo</i>, at least under conditions of over-expression. Such protein crosstalk is not unexpected and has also been documented between non-cognate histidine kinases and response regulators for example. The crosstalk among the three transglutaminase/protease-like enzymes HvyA, NGR_c12490, and SMc00998 indicates similar targets in <i>Caulobacter</i> and <i>Sinorhizobia</i>. Unlike HvyA, NGR_c12490, and SMc00998, coding sequences are not embedded within genes encoding known surface polysaccharides export proteins. However, over-expression of HvyA did not alter the abundance or migration of the CPS export proteins CCNA_00162, CCNA_00163, CCNA_00164, CCNA_00167, and CCNA_00168 by SDS-PAGE immunoblotting, or the amount of assembled RsaA S-layer subunit (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), indicating that HvyA is not required to maintain the steady state levels of these proteins. The distant HvyA relative LapG from <i>Pseudomonas fluorescens</i> cleaves the cell surface adhesin LapA that is encoded nearby in <i>P. fluorescens,</i> but not found in <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Legionella pneumophila</i>, or <i>C. crescentus</i> genomes (<a href=\"#bib46\">Newell et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Navarro et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Newell et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Chatterjee et al., 2012</a>). While the target of the LapG ortholog from <i>L. pneumophila</i> is unknown, this enzyme can cleave <i>P. fluorescens</i> LapA <i>in vitro</i> (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chatterjee et al., 2012</a>). LapG is regulated at the level of activity by sequestration to the cytoplasmic membrane by the cyclic-di-GMP responsive trans-membrane receptor LapD (<a href=\"#bib45\">Navarro et al., 2011</a>). Moreover, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions not only promote outer membrane integrity, but also stimulate the cleavage of LapA by LapG in <i>P. fluorescens</i> (<a href=\"#bib7\">Boyd et al., 2012</a>). Residues predicted to bind Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions are conserved in HvyA, and our unbiased structure\u2013function analyses indeed unearthed mutations in conserved residues that are important for HvyA function. Thus, while control of HvyA activity by Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions could contribute to control of HvyA action on its proper targets within the envelope, the tight regulation of HvyA (and its orthologs) abundance during the alpha-proteobacterial cell cycle represents the major regulatory mechanism to constrain BTLCP activity temporally."

Specifically, the authors show that the expression of HvyA, a newly identified negative regulator of capsulation is both under tight transcriptional and translational cell cycle control to become cleared when the cells enter the S-phase, allowing the capsulation of a particular cell type. This ensures a cell-specific protection against phage infections and potentially other environmental insults. The regulatory mechanism has been genetically dissected and shown to involve known cell cycle regulators MucR1/2, SciP, CtrA and a still elusive factor X. This regulation or at least the MucR part may be conserved in other alphas. HvyA inhibits capsule formation, but its mode of action, which appears to be conserved in other alpha proteobacteria, remains unknown. Overall, the experiments are high quality and the conclusions are justified."
