The DMN consistently shows reduced activity during task performance compared to rest (<a href=\"#bib19\">Raichle and Snyder, 2007</a>) and often reduced activity for harder compared to easier task versions (<a href=\"#bib11\">Gilbert et al., 2012</a>). In contrast to this general pattern, increased activity has been reported in a cluster of mental states involving thinking about the self, one's own perspective, or the perspective of others (<a href=\"#bib6\">Buckner and Carroll, 2007</a>). Examples include recollecting previous experiences (<a href=\"#bib25\">Vincent et al., 2006</a>) or imagining future ones (<a href=\"#bib1\">Addis et al., 2007</a>), mind-wandering (<a href=\"#bib16\">Mason et al., 2007</a>), and theory of mind tasks (<a href=\"#bib28\">Young et al., 2010</a>). The DMN has thus been linked to a number of high-level cognitive processes, such as self-referential processing (<a href=\"#bib13\">Gusnard et al., 2001</a>) and imaginary scene construction (<a href=\"#bib14\">Hassabis and Maguire, 2007</a>)."

Using graph theoretical analytic approaches to resting-state fRMI data, Andrews-Hanna et al. identified a core sub-network comprising bilateral posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and anterior medial prefrontal cortex (AMPFC) a medial temporal lobe (MTL) sub-network made up of ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC), bilateral hippocampal formation (HF), parahippocampus (PHC), retrosplenial cortex (Rsp), and posterior inferior parietal lobule (pIPL) and a dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC) sub-network which includes the DMPFC, bilateral temporal parietal junction (TPJ), lateral temporal cortex (LTC), and the temporal Pole (TempP). Andrews-Hanna et al. argue for a degree of functional segregation between these sub-networks, with the MTL sub-network especially linked to construction of mental scenes based on memory, and the DMPFC network more involved in mentalising. These segregations, however, are likely to be relative, with many experiments, for example, linking all three DMN sub-networks to conscious recollection (<a href=\"#bib24\">Vilberg and Rugg, 2012</a>)."

Arguably, imagination, mind-wandering, and taking another's perspective have in common a substantial change from the current cognitive context. Similarly, conscious recollection is typically conceived as reactivation of a previously-experienced episode, with components linked into a complex surrounding, context. Substantial shifts of context may be common in everyday activity, for example, a shift from cooking dinner to giving directions to guests over the phone, but less common in the constrained setting of typical laboratory tasks. For example, in a recent review of neuroimaging studies of task switching (<a href=\"#bib15\">Kim et al., 2011</a>), tasks that they argue required a contextual switch involved either a change in simple attended features or binary categorization rules using a fixed, small set of possible stimuli. Irrespective of specific high-level processes involved, we reasoned that the DMN may be involved in any large switch of cognitive context\u2014an operation presumably calling for relaxation of many aspects of a current attentional focus, with concomitant activation of representations and processes relevant to the new context."

Univariate analysis of fMRI data was used to compare dissimilar-task-switch with no-switch trials through the standard general linear model (GLM) approach. A regressor was constructed for each switch type with events modelled from stimulus onset until response and convolved with the haemodynamic response function. The resulting beta values for each switch type were compared and thresholded at p &lt; 0.05, correcting for the false discovery rate. We identified widespread activation predominantly in regions of in the DMN (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), with peaks found in bilateral HF, PHC, Rsp, PCC, AMPFC, and left pIPL (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>).

The mean beta value was extracted from each ROI following each switch type. Planned, paired two-tailed t-tests revealed significant increase in activity during dissimilar-task-switch compared to no-switch in core (bilateral AMPFC, PCC) and MTL (Rsp, PHC) sub-networks, with a tendency to de-activation in the DMPFC sub-network (significant in right TPJ) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Again, no ROIs revealed a significant difference between the similar-task-switch trials and no-switch trials. Two-way repeated measures ANOVAs were performed separately for each sub-network, with factors of ROI (Core: 4, MTL: 9, DMPFC: 7) and switch type (no-switch, dissimilar-task-switch). Main effects of task-switching were found for the Core (<i>F</i><sub>(1,17)</sub> = 16.7, p = 0.001) and MTL (<i>F</i><sub>(1,17)</sub> = 6.1, p = 0.03) sub-networks, showing increased activity for dissimilar switches. In contrast, the DMPFC sub-network showed a marginally significant de-activation (<i>F</i><sub>(1,17)</sub> = 4.1, p = 0.06). Corresponding ANOVAs were performed to test for the difference between similar-task-switch and no-switch, but these revealed no main effect in any sub-network. To investigate differences at the sub-network level, beta values were averaged across the ROIs within each sub-network each of the three trial types, and a two-way repeated measures ANOVA (factors of sub-network and switch type) was performed on the mean beta values. This analysis revealed a main effect of sub-network (<i>F</i><sub>(2,34)</sub> = 18.9, p &lt; 0.001) and an interaction of switch type and sub-network (<i>F</i><sub>(4,68)</sub> = 17.8, p &lt; 0.001). These data therefore show a dissociation within the DMN: While the DMPFC sub-network displayed the characteristic pattern of reduced activity during executive control, switching between dissimilar tasks showed an opposite pattern of increased activity in Core and MTL sub-networks."

This produced a beta estimate for similar and dissimilar-task-pairs in each ROI, in each subject. Beta estimates were subsequently averaged across the component ROIs of each sub-network. <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a> shows the mean beta estimate for the similar and dissimilar task pairs in each subject for the Core, MTL, and DMPFC sub-networks.

Here, we argue that a simple variable may relate these complex processes\u2014the degree of change in cognitive context. To address this hypothesis we modified a typical task switching study to include both small shifts\u2014similar to those of many previous studies\u2014and much larger shifts. In contrast to the common idea of the DMN as a task-negative system, the activity of which progressively decreases with increasing task difficulty, our results show the opposite for a large change of cognitive context, in particular for Core and MTL sub-networks."

Our data suggest DMN activation only when the change is sufficiently large, perhaps analogous to many of the shifts taking place in everyday cognition. It is uncertain whether large and small shifts differ qualitatively or only quantitatively. In our task, for example, a shift between rules within the same category may have been executed without reference to the link between frame color and categorization rule; to perform such a switch, it was necessary only to see that frame color had changed and to retrieve the other rule relevant to the current set of stimuli. In contrast, a shift between categories likely required reference back to a broader set of task rules, including the remembered list of color\u2013rule combinations. More broadly, one possibility is that the DMN is involved in relaxing a current attentional focus, allowing new cognitive contents to arise. When cognitive operations are largely similar across successive trials, the DMN may be suppressed, but as increasingly more of the current focus must be dissolved, suppression may shift to activation."

The point is illustrated by a detailed consideration of the task-switching review by <a href=\"#bib15\">Kim et al. (2011)</a>, as described in the introduction. <a href=\"#bib15\">Kim et al. (2011)</a> identified three major types of task-switch found in the literature: perceptual switch, response switch, and contextual switch, the latter of which is the most comparable to the current work. Of the 20 tasks that they identified as involving a contextual switch, 17 used fixed small stimulus sets, with the switches (like our within-category switches) concerning just the relevant stimulus feature such as colour or shape. Two studies used a task that required participants to make one of two possible binary decisions on serially presented letter strings. The remaining task was essentially our semantic task, using text instead of images. Unlike these studies, we propose that it is our use of much more substantial switches, requiring larger revisions of cognitive context and operations, that leads to the novel finding of DMN activation."

A role in memory for individual events fits well with the proposal that the DMN binds together the components of a complex cognitive context. Beyond traditional studies of episodic and autobiographical memory, our results show the importance of DMN context processing in cognitive control. In contrast to the common finding of deactivation linked to executive control, our findings show increased activity when the change of context is sufficiently large. Establishing a new, complex context, we suggest, may be common to recollection of specific previous events and to major revisions of complex task rules."

The regions that demonstrate switch-related activity show relatively strong correspondence to the pattern of DMN fractionation presented by Andrews-Hanna et al.

Encoding analysis is likely more sensitive than univariate activity analysis, reflecting both overall activity within a broad region, and the exact pattern of activity within that region (<a href=\"#bib9\">Davis et al., 2014</a>).

In contrast, comparing dissimilar tasks involves a myriad of differences such as visual properties of the stimuli, cognitive domain (semantic knowledge, lexicon, visual discrimination) as well as task rule. Correspondingly, much stronger decoding is seen across the DMN between dissimilar tasks. This is unsurprising for a network of regions hypothesised to link components of a broad cognitive context."

It is unclear how such sustained activity relates to the switch-related activity we have shown here. On the one hand, it is plausible that, when a participant lies in a scanner at rest, there are periodic large shifts in the content of cognition, and in part, \u2018sustained\u2019 DMN activity may reflect averaging across shifts occurring at variable, unknown times. Indeed, traditional studies of resting state functional connectivity depend on temporal variation in network activity, as expected for a signal in part linked to transient cognitive events. That said, if a core aspect of DMN function is relaxing an attentional focus, sustained enhancement is plausible during a period of relatively unfocused cognitive activity."

In previous studies, apparently similar cases of task switching have been associated with widespread recruitment of a fronto-parietal, executive control network (<a href=\"#bib22\">Sohn et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Braver et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Monsell, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Yeung et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Kim et al., 2011</a>), and it is unclear why no similar activity was seen in our data. One contributing factor may be our explicit modelling of RT differences between conditions, convolving the canonical haemodynamic response with the duration of each trial from stimulus presentation until response. As this procedure is designed to correct for activation differences due simply to longer RT on switch trials, it may reduce or remove differences seen in studies that do not adopt such a correction. Our results also raise the possibility, however, that traditional task-switching results may not generalise to the more complex conditions of our experiment. Future work will be needed to resolve this discrepancy."

Our intention in this study was to introduce more substantial switches than previously used\u2014more in line with many switches in everyday cognition\u2014, and the Kim et al. review shows that we were largely successful in this. Of the 20 studies they review, 17 used fixed small stimulus sets, with the switches (like our within-category switches) concerning just the relevant stimulus feature such as colour or shape. Two studies used a task that required participants to make one of two possible binary decisions on serially presented letter strings. The remaining task was essentially our semantic task, using text instead of images. As we now discuss, we propose that it is our use of much more substantial switches, requiring larger revisions of cognitive context and operations, that leads to the novel finding of DMN activation. This conclusion is directly supported by our explicit comparison of smaller with larger switches."
