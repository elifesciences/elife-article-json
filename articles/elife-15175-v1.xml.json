Tumor-specific mutations were detectable in the cyst fluids of 19 of 23 (83%) borderline tumors, 10 of 13 (77%) type I cancers, and 18 of 18 (100%) type II cancers. In contrast, no mutations were found in the cyst fluids of 18 patients with benign tumors or non-neoplastic cysts. Though large, prospective studies are needed to demonstrate the safety and clinical utility of this approach, our results suggest that the genetic evaluation of cyst fluids might be able to inform the management of the large number of women with these lesions."

Tumor-specific mutations were detectable in the cyst fluids of 19 of 23 (83%) borderline tumors, 10 of 13 (77%) type I cancers, and 18 of 18 (100%) type II cancers. In contrast, no mutations were found in the cyst fluids of 18 patients with benign tumors or non-neoplastic cysts. Though large, prospective studies are needed to demonstrate the safety and clinical utility of this approach, our results suggest that the genetic evaluation of cyst fluids might be able to inform the management of the large number of women with these lesions."

Currently, there is no reliable way to determine whether an ovarian cyst is cancerous without performing surgery.

These cancers commonly present as an adnexal mass with cystic components, but are not associated with specific symptoms.

These cysts are frequently benign and found incidentally on routine imaging (<a href=\"#bib47\">Pavlik et al., 2013</a>). Though malignancy is an unusual cause of the cysts, 30% of the cysts exhibit radiographic features suspicious for malignancy, such as solid areas or mass (<a href=\"#bib47\">Pavlik et al., 2013</a>). In addition to the anxiety that such findings provoke, many women undergo unnecessary surgery for cysts that are not malignant and may not be responsible for the symptoms they have. For example, only 5% of 570 women in a large ovarian cancer screening randomized trial who underwent surgical evaluation actually had a malignancy (<a href=\"#bib8\">Buys et al., 2005</a>). Similarly in another study of symptomatic women, only 4% of 197 women who had concerning features on transvaginal ultrasound were ultimately diagnosed with ovarian cancer (<a href=\"#bib20\">Gilbert et al., 2012</a>). Compounding this issue is the fact that surgery for ovarian cysts requires general anesthesia and is associated with significant morbidity, causing complications in 15% of women (<a href=\"#bib9\">Buys et al., 2011</a>). These complications include damage to nerves and ureters, bleeding, infection, and perforation of adjacent viscera. Furthermore, the procedure often results in hormonal and fertility loss (in the case of bilateral oophorectomy) (<a href=\"#bib9\">Buys et al., 2011</a>). Even minimal procedures such as ovarian cystectomy can affect fertility in premenopausal women by decreasing follicular response and oocyte number (<a href=\"#bib37\">Loh et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Demirol et al., 2006</a>). If a preoperative test could help determine whether the cystic lesion was benign or malignant, unnecessary surgery and its associated complications could be avoided in many patients. This would be particularly helpful for women of reprodutive age who wish to preserve their fertility, as well as women whose medical comorbidities or functional status makes anesthesia and surgery hazardous."

A dualistic model has been proposed to classify these neoplasms (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kurman and Shih, 2010</a>). Type I tumors are composed of low-grade serous, low-grade endometrioid, clear cell, and mucinous carcinomas. They are generally indolent, frequently diagnosed at early stage (Stage I or II), and develop from well-established precursor lesions ('borderline' or 'atypical proliferative' tumors, as described below) (<a href=\"#bib33\">Kurman and Shih, 2011</a>). Type I cancers commonly exhibit mutations in <i>KRAS, BRAF, CTNNB1, PIK3CA, PTEN, ARID1A</i>, or <i>PPP2R1A</i> (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kurman and Shih, 2010</a>). In contrast, type II tumors are generally high-grade serous carcinomas. They are highly aggressive, most often diagnosed in late stage (Stage III or IV), and have suggested origins from the distal fallopian tube (<a href=\"#bib34\">Lee et al., 2007</a>). Type II cancers are the most clinically important group of ovarian cancers, comprising 75% of all ovarian carcinomas and responsible for 90% of ovarian cancer deaths (<a href=\"#bib33\">Kurman and Shih, 2011</a>). They almost always harbor <i>TP53</i> mutations (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network. 2011</a>). Also unlike type I cancers, which are relatively chemo-resistant and more often treated only with surgical excision, type II cancers respond to conventional chemotherapy, particularly after maximal debulking to reduce tumor burden (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bristow et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Schmeler et al., 2008</a>)."

Following surgery, the prognosis is excellent compared to ovarian cancers, with 10-year survival rates over 94% (<a href=\"#bib51\">Sherman et al., 2004</a>). A minor but significant portion of borderline tumors recur after surgery, however, and a subset of the recurrences are found to have advanced to type I cancers (<a href=\"#bib52\">Shih et al., 2011</a>). This progression is consistent with molecular findings: serous borderline tumors typically exhibit mutations in <i>BRAF</i> or <i>KRAS</i>, like their malignant counterparts (low-grade serous carcinoma) (<a href=\"#bib39\">Mayr et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Jones et al., 2012</a>).

The fluids have historically been studied by cytology to identify malignant cysts. Ovarian cysts share many features with these other types of cysts, in that they are common, often diagnosed incidentally, and are nearly always benign. However, aspiration of ovarian cyst fluid for cytology is not standard-of-care. From a historical perspective, the difference in diagnostic management partly lies in the fact that cytology has not proven to be very informative for ovarian cysts, particularly for distinguishing benign vs. borderline tumors (<a href=\"#bib40\">Moran et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Mart\u00ednez-Onsurbe et al., 2001</a>). There have also been concerns raised about the safety of ovarian cyst aspiration (see Discussion), and these concerns have not often been raised for other types of cysts."

Based on the emerging success of the molecular genetic evaluation of other types of cysts, we reasoned that a similar approach could be applied to ovarian cysts. Evaluation of DNA from cells and cell fragments shed into the cyst fluid would presumably allow the identification of tumor-specific mutations. Unlike other, conventional markers of neoplasia such as CA-125, cancer gene mutations are exquisitely specific indicators of a neoplastic lesion (<a href=\"#bib58\">Vogelstein et al., 2013</a>). Moreover, the type of mutation can in some cases indicate the type of neoplastic lesion present (<a href=\"#bib60\">Wu et al., 2011a</a>). Yamada et al. have demonstrated that mutations can be detected in the cystic fluid of ovarian tumors by querying exons 4 to 9 of <i>TP53</i>, achieving sensitivities of 12.5% and 10%, for borderline and malignant tumors, respectively (<a href=\"#bib62\">Yamada et al., 2013</a>). Recently developed, extremely sensitive methods for mutation detection, capable of identifying one mutant template allele among thousands of normal templates in a panel of genes, could potentially increase this sensitivity (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kinde et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Murtaza et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Newman et al., 2014</a>). In this study, we have applied one of these technologies to assess mutations in ovarian cyst fluids and to inform the development of tests that could eventually be applied to patients."

The amount of DNA shed from neoplastic cells was expected to be a minor fraction of the total DNA in the cyst fluid, with most DNA emanating from normal cells. We therefore used a sensitive detection method, called Safe-SeqS (Safe-Sequencing System), to identify mutations in cyst fluid samples (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kinde et al., 2011</a>). In brief, primers were designed to amplify 133 regions, covering 9054 distinct nucleotide positions within the 17 genes of interest (<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 3</a>). Three multiplex PCR reactions, each containing non-overlapping amplicons, were then performed on each sample. One primer in each pair included a unique identifier (UID) for each template molecule, thereby drastically minimizing the error rates associated with PCR and sequencing, as described previously (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kinde et al., 2011</a>). Under the conditions used in the current experiments, mutations present in &gt;0.1% of template molecules could generally be reliably determined (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kinde et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bettegowda et al., 2014</a>). We could not perform sequencing on five cysts (four non-neoplastic cysts and one cyst associated with a\u00a0borderline tumor) because there was insufficient DNA (&lt;3 ng recovered), and these were scored as uninterpretable. When this assay was applied to cyst fluid\u00a0samples\u00a0with sufficient DNA,\u00a0no mutations were identified in the 18 cysts obtained from patients with\u00a0simple cysts (n\u00a0=\u00a06) or benign tumors (n\u00a0=\u00a012) (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). This was in stark contrast to the fluids obtained from the 18 patients with type II cancers, all of which were found to contain a mutation (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Ten (77%) of the 13 cyst fluids from patients with type I cancers and 19 (83%) of the 23 cyst fluids from patients with borderline tumors contained at least one detectable mutation. When categorized by the need for surgery (i.e., presence of a borderline tumor or a type I or type II cancer), the sensitivity of this assay was 87% (47 of 54 cysts; 95% confidence interval of 75% to 95%) and its specificity was 100% (95% confidence interval of 74% to 100%; <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>)."

As expected, the mutant allele frequencies in the tumors were often, but not always, higher than in the cyst fluids (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>). As another positive control, we used an independent PCR and sequencing reaction to confirm each of the cyst fluid mutations listed in <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>. This validated not only the presence of a mutation, but also confirmed its fractional representation. The median relative difference between the fractions of mutant alleles in replicate experiments was 7.0% (IQR of 3.5% to 8.9%). Finally, four patients were found to have two independent mutations (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>). For example, the cyst fluid of patient OVCYST 081, who had a high-grade endometrioid carcinoma, harbored a missense mutation (R280K) in <i>TP53</i> plus an in-frame deletion of <i>PIK3R1</i> at codons 458 and 459. The <i>TP53</i> mutation was found in 3.0% of alleles while the <i>PIK3R1</i> mutation was found in 3.7% of the alleles analyzed. Similar mutant allele frequencies among completely different mutations in the cyst fluid of three other patients provided further indicators of reproducibility.

However screening is not recommended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force using current diagnostic approaches, which too frequently lead to \u201cimportant harms, including major surgical interventions in women who do not have cancer\u201d (<a href=\"#bib41\">Moyer and Force, 2012</a>). Our study was driven by the underlying principle that clonal\u00a0cancer driver\u00a0gene mutations are causative agents of neoplasia and absent in non-neoplastic conditions (<a href=\"#bib58\">Vogelstein et al., 2013</a>). We have demonstrated here that driver mutations in ovarian tumors are also present in their associated cyst fluids. Moreover, the mutant allele frequencies in the cyst fluids are relatively high (median 12.6%, IQR of 2.7% to 40.2%), facilitating their detection. There were no mutations detected in the cyst fluids that were not also present in the tumors, and vice versa. Also importantly, no mutation was identified in non-neoplastic cysts or\u00a0cysts associated with benign tumors. Overall, mutations were detected in a major fraction (87%) of cysts requiring surgery but not in any cyst that did not require surgery (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>)."

All of these seven cysts occurred in borderline tumors or type I cancers, while mutations were always (100%) detectable in type II cancers (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). There are two potential explanations for our failure to detect mutations in these seven\u00a0cysts. First, it is possible that the mutant DNA concentration in these cysts was below the level of technical sensitivity of our assay (~0.1% mutant allele fraction). We excluded this possibility by evaluating the tumors themselves: no mutations were detected in any of the tumors from these 7 patients. The second, and therefore more likely explanation, is that our panel of 133 amplicons, containing regions of 17 genes, was not adequate to capture the mutations that were present. Unlike type II cancers, which nearly always contain <i>TP53</i> mutations (94% of the type II cancers we studied, for example), the genomic landscapes of type I cancers and borderline tumors are more heterogeneous and not as well studied (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kurman and Shih, 2010</a>). Further genetic evaluation of these tumors should facilitate the incorporation of additional amplicons in the panel to reach higher sensitivities. Nevertheless, the 100% sensitivity for type II cancers in our study is highly encouraging, given that these cancers account for over 90% of ovarian cancer deaths."

Even so, the differences in genetic alterations among the various cyst types were striking (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>).

This concern is based on inconclusive evidence about the dangers of cyst rupture during surgery and is, at best, controversial. A study of 235 patients who had pre-operative ovarian cyst aspirates reported no recurrence in all 7 malignant cases with a mean follow-up of two years (<a href=\"#bib42\">Mulvany, 1996</a>). Furthermore, a meta-analysis found no difference in progression-free survival for 2382 early-stage ovarian cancer patients who had experienced intraoperative cyst rupture vs. no rupture (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kim et al., 2013</a>). We acknowledge that, under current recommendations, a surgical spill could upstage a localized tumor (i.e. stage 1A to IC) and subject the patient to chemotherapy with its associated morbidity. However, the idea that malignant cysts might shed cancer cells if needle-punctured seems incongruent with the widespread practice of laparoscopic removal of ovarian cysts (<a href=\"#bib24\">Hilger et al., 2006</a>). Laparoscopic removal of a cyst carries a significant risk of cyst rupture, conceivably higher than when a tiny needle is inserted under ultrasound-guidance (<a href=\"#bib22\">Havrilesky et al., 2003</a>). Finally, malignant pancreatic cysts might be viewed to be as dangerous as malignant ovarian cysts (<a href=\"#bib25\">Howlader et al., 2014</a>), yet the standard-of-care for pancreatic cysts involves repeated sampling of cyst fluid through endoscopic ultrasound over many years (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chang et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Eloubeidi et al., 2003</a>). Though pancreatic cysts and ovarian cysts lie in different anatomical compartments, it is encouraging that aspiration of pancreatic cysts is not associated with an increased risk of disease recurrence or mortality in patients with pancreatic cancer (<a href=\"#bib5\">Beane et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Ngamruengphong et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Kudo et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Ngamruengphong et al., 2015</a>). Recent advancements in methods of plugging biopsy tracts to prevent tumor cell dissemination, as well as the increased use of intraperitoneal chemotherapy, further lessen the concern of tumor cell dissemination following ovarian cyst aspiration (<a href=\"#bib1\">Armstrong et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Tran et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Tsang et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Tewari et al., 2015</a>). On the basis of these observations and recent developments, we believe that ultrasound-guided aspiration of ovarian cyst fluids would likely be a safe and well-tolerated procedure."

In addition to the psychological impact a potential diagnosis of cancer has on patients, surgery for benign lesions entails considerable cost and morbidity. With the ever increasing sensitivity and use of imaging modalities, the number of patients with incidentally found ovarian cysts is expected to rise. This urgently calls for a diagnostic method that reliably differentiates between the harmless cysts that can be managed expectantly and malignant cysts that require surgical resection. OVA-1 is the only FDA-cleared test to date that aims to distinguish benign versus malignant adenxal mass. It measures levels of five serum markers (CA-125, \u03b2-2 microglobulin, apolipoprotein A1, Prealbumin, and transferrin) and is used to stratify patients who should consult a gynecologic oncologist rather than a general gynecologist for surgery. However the test has a specificity of 43% for ovarian cancer, which is even lower than that of CA-125 alone (<a href=\"#bib57\">Ueland et al., 2011</a>). While the test might encourage patients with suspected ovarian cancer to seek specialized care, it would not decrease the number of unnecessary surgeries for women with benign adnexal masses."

Such distinction is often difficult based on symptoms and conventional diagnostic criteria. For example, in a large study of 48,053 asymptomatic postmenopausal women who underwent ultrasound examination by skilled sonographers, 8 (17%) of the 47 ovarian cancers that were identified occurred in women with persistently <i>normal</i> sonographic findings (<a href=\"#bib50\">Sharma et al., 2012</a>). All eight cases were type II cancers, highlighting the potential utility of an additional assay to detect this highly lethal and aggressive type of ovarian cancer. On the other hand, of the 4367 women with <i>abnormal</i> sonographic findings, less than 1% of cases proved to have malignancy upon surgery. Furthermore, of the 32 women with borderline or Type I cancers diagnosed, 22 (69%) had a serum CA-125 level within the clinically accepted normal range (\u226435 units/mL). In our study, 18 of 18 (100%) type II cancers were detectable by virtue of the mutations found in cyst fluid DNA while none of the 18 benign or non-neoplastic cyst fluid contained such mutations. It is also important to note that the readout of our assay is quantitative and not dependent on the skill level of the reader (in contrast to sonography). Finally, the procedure can be performed minimally invasively in an outpatient setting. The goal of our test is not to replace clinical, radiologic, or sonographic evaluation but to augment them with molecular genetic markers."

One can easily imagine how such additional information could be used to inform clinical practice in conjunction with current diagnostic approaches. For example, if a cyst contained low amounts of DNA, no detectable mutations, and if the patient had low CA-125 levels, our data suggest that it is very unlikely to be a borderline tumor or malignant lesion. Either no surgery, or laparoscopic rather than open surgery, could be recommended for that patient, even if there were some solid component upon imaging. The option to avoid surgery would be particularly valuable for pre-menopausal women who generally have a low risk of ovarian cancer and might wish to preserve their fertility, as well as patients who are poor surgical candidates. However, our assay in its current format cannot completely rule out malignancy because a fraction of early-stage cancer patients did not have detectable mutations in their cysts. Therefore, patients whose clinical and functional status allows them to undergo surgery and anesthesia might still choose to have\u00a0a surgical procedure. On the other hand, a minimally invasive test that provides additional, orthogonal information to patients and surgeons could inform their decision about the advisability of surgery."

Radical, rather than conservative, surgery might be appropriate due to the high likelihood of an aggressive type II cancer. In contrast, if a <i>BRAF</i> mutation is identified, the lesion is presumably a borderline or low-grade tumor; thus conservative rather than radical surgery might be sufficient. Furthermore, given that certain types of ovarian cancers (type II) tend to respond well to chemotherapy while others (type I) are relatively chemo-resistant, knowing the type of cancer present prior to surgery based on the mutation profile could help guide decisions regarding the use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Validation of the current data in a large, prospective trial will be required before the approach can be seriously considered for clinical implementation in a non-research setting."

Primer sequences are listed in <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 3</a>. These primers were used to amplify DNA in 25\u00a0\u03bcL reactions as previously described except that 15 cycles were used for the inial amplification (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kinde et al., 2011</a>). For each sample, three multiplex reactions, each containing non-overlapping amplicons, were performed. Reactions were purified with AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, PA, USA) and eluted in 100\u2009\u03bcL of Buffer EB (Qiagen). A fraction (0.25\u2009\u03bcL) of purified PCR products were then amplified in a second round of PCR, as described (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kinde et al., 2011</a>). The PCR products were purified with AMPure and sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq instrument."

                                "text": "To better distinguish genuine mutations in the samples from artifactual variants arising from sequencing and sample preparation steps, we used Safe-SeqS, an error-reduction technology for detection of low frequency mutations as described (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kinde et al., 2011</a>). High quality sequence reads were selected based on quality scores, which were generated by the sequencing instrument to indicate the probability a base was called in error. The minimum quality score requirements were 15 (base call accuracy of 97%) and 20 (base call accuracy of 99%) for each of the fourteen UID bases and mutant base(s), respectively. The template-specific portion of the reads was matched to reference sequences using custom scripts written in SQL and C#. Reads from a common template molecule were then grouped based on the unique identifier sequences (UIDs) that were incorporated as molecular barcodes. Artifactual mutations introduced during the sample preparation or sequencing steps were reduced by requiring a mutation to be present in &gt;90% of reads in each UID family (i.e., to be scored as a 'supermutant'). Only mutations with mutant allele frequency (MAF) above 0.1%, the limit of sensitivity of the assay performed, were considered as positive. Silent or intronic mutations (other than those in the canonical splice sites) were not considered to be mutations because their significance is unknown. In addition, DNA from the peripheral blood lymphocytes of healthy individuals was used as a control to identify potential false positive mutations (see main text). Only supermutants in samples with frequencies far exceeding their frequencies in control DNA samples (i.e., &gt;\u00a0mean + 5 standard deviations) were scored as positive. The original sequencing data on all mutations listed in <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2</a> were manually reviewed to confirm that the mutations were correctly called by the Illumina software. Moreover, each of these mutations was validated by an independent PCR and sequencing reaction."

The authors argue for the safety of US guided needle aspiration of ovarian cysts. While the points are reasonable, the author does not address the problem of upstaging a localized ovarian cancer. While recurrence rates may be the same, a stage IA tumor would not require adjuvant chemotherapy while a IC1 (surgical spill which would include a needle aspiration) would require chemotherapy associated with significant morbidity, impacts on fertility, while not necessarily changing survival or recurrence rate. This point needs to be included in the discussion as a limitation."

Patients with clearly benign tumors can be excluded- simple appearing cysts on US with normal CA-125. How many patients then are left to whom the pre-op diagnosis is unknown based on abnormal US findings and some elevation in CA-125? I can understand the utility as a confirmatory test for a benign lesion in a patient who by all other parameters appears benign based on the high specificity to rule out malignancy with genomic analysis, but the clinical role here as a screening test really should be flushed out further."

However, the understanding of when and how this technique could be utilized should be clarified as the current argument is too limited. The authors argue for the safety of US guided needle aspiration of ovarian cysts. While the points are reasonable, the author does not address the problem of upstaging a localized ovarian cancer. While recurrence rates may be the same, a stage IA tumor would not require adjuvant chemotherapy while a IC1 (surgical spill which would include a needle aspiration) would require chemotherapy associated with significant morbidity, impacts on fertility, while not necessarily changing survival or recurrence rate. This point needs to be included in the discussion as a limitation.</i>"

We also realize that there is some skepticism towards the diagnostic utility and safety of ovarian cyst aspiration in the gynecological community. However we are not the first to encounter such skepticism when presenting a novel diagnostic approach. When colonoscopy was first introduced by Drs. William Wolff and Hiromi Shinya in 1969, it was perceived as both \u201cunnecessary and unduly dangerous\u201d (Wolff W. Am J Gastroenterol. 1989 Sep;84(9):1017-25). This skepticism only began to fade when it was demonstrated that the colonoscope could reveal changes not disclosed by conventional methods at the time. Over the next few decades, and only after many subsequent studies, was the scope\u2019s safety and clinical efficacy demonstrated. Analogously, we have introduced a sort of \u201cmolecular scope\u201d for cystic lesions of the ovary that can reveal information unobtainable by conventional methods. As with all such proof-of-principle studies, its clinical safety and efficacy need to be validated in a larger prospective trial. Nevertheless, our data suggest that this new approach, in conjunction with current diagnostic methods, has the potential to improve the management of the vast number of women with ovarian cysts."

The less radical surgery would have a variety of beneficial effects, including maintenance of fertility if desired. On the other hand, we also acknowledge that, under current recommendations, a surgical spill could upstage a localized tumor (i.e. stage 1A to IC) and subject the patient to chemotherapy with its associated morbidity."

For example, all advanced stage tumors can be excluded as they are clearly malignant by pre-op evaluation. Patients with clearly benign tumors can be excluded- simple appearing cysts on US with normal CA-125. How many patients then are left to whom the pre-op diagnosis is unknown based on abnormal US findings and some elevation in CA-125? I can understand the utility as a confirmatory test for a benign lesion in a patient who by all other parameters appears benign based on the high specificity to rule out malignancy with genomic analysis, but the clinical role here as a screening test really should be flushed out further.</i>"

We agree with the reviewer that those with advanced stage tumors would not benefit from this sort of analysis. However, the diagnosis of earlier stage neoplasms is considerably more difficult.
