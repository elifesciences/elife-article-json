How the BCR becomes signaling-competent upon antigen binding is still a matter of controversy. Using a high-resolution proximity ligation assay (PLA) to monitor the conformation of the BCR and its interactions with co-receptors at a 10\u201320 nm resolution, we provide direct evidence for the opening of BCR dimers during B cell activation. We also show that upon binding Syk opens the receptor by an inside-out signaling mechanism that amplifies BCR signaling. Furthermore, we found that on resting B cells, the coreceptor CD19 is in close proximity with the IgD-BCR and on activated B cells with the IgM-BCR, indicating nanoscale reorganization of receptor clusters during B cell activation."

How the BCR becomes signaling-competent upon antigen binding is still a matter of controversy. Using a high-resolution proximity ligation assay (PLA) to monitor the conformation of the BCR and its interactions with co-receptors at a 10\u201320 nm resolution, we provide direct evidence for the opening of BCR dimers during B cell activation. We also show that upon binding Syk opens the receptor by an inside-out signaling mechanism that amplifies BCR signaling. Furthermore, we found that on resting B cells, the coreceptor CD19 is in close proximity with the IgD-BCR and on activated B cells with the IgM-BCR, indicating nanoscale reorganization of receptor clusters during B cell activation."

In its monomeric form, the BCR is a 1:1 complex between the membrane-bound immunoglobulin (mIg) molecule and the Ig\u03b1/Ig\u03b2-heterodimer (<a href=\"#bib36\">Schamel and Reth, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Tolar et al., 2005</a>). The cytoplasmic tails of both Ig\u03b1 and Ig\u03b2 carry an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM), the tyrosines of which are phosphorylated by Src family protein tyrosine kinases such as Lyn and the spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) (<a href=\"#bib37\">Schmitz et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Pao et al., 1998</a>). However, the two kinases interact with the BCR in different ways. In contrast to Lyn, which predominantly phosphorylates only the first ITAM tyrosine, Syk phosphorylates both tyrosines and subsequently binds the double-phosphorylated ITAM (ppITAM) via its tandem SH2 domains (<a href=\"#bib11\">Futterer et al., 1998</a>). The binding of Syk to a ppITAM sequence results in the rapid phosphorylation of ITAM tyrosines of neighboring receptors. The resulting increased Syk recruitment generates a positive feedback that amplifies signal transduction from the BCR (<a href=\"#bib32\">Rolli et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Mukherjee et al., 2013</a>)."

How the ITAM sequence is shielded from the action of this kinase in resting B cells is not known but may involve cytoskeletal elements. Indeed, B cells can be activated not only by exposure to antigen but also to the F-actin inhibitor Latrunculin A (Lat-A), suggesting that the actin cytoskeleton protects the resting BCR (<a href=\"#bib46\">Treanor et al., 2010</a>). The cytoskeleton is also limiting the free diffusion of receptors (<a href=\"#bib20\">Kusumi et al., 2005</a>). In line with this, B cell activation is accompanied by cytoskeleton remodeling and increased BCR mobility. Furthermore, it has been shown that BCR mobility is reduced in membrane areas enriched in ezrin-radixin-moesin (ERM) proteins (<a href=\"#bib13\">Harwood and Batista, 2011</a>). However, and complicating matters further, the cytoskeleton not only plays an inhibitory, but also an activating role during B cell activation, as it is required for microcluster formation and receptor internalization (<a href=\"#bib4\">Brown and Song, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Cheng et al., 2001</a>)."

These two receptors have distinct signaling functions and diffusion behaviors on the B cell surface but the molecular basis for these differences is poorly understood (<a href=\"#bib17\">Kim and Reth, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Treanor et al., 2010</a>). The cross-linking model (CLM) assumes that most of the 100,000 BCR complexes on the surface of a B cell are monomeric and that cross-linking of two BCR monomers by a polyvalent antigen initiates the signaling process (<a href=\"#bib25\">Metzger, 1992</a>). Similarly, the conformation-induced oligomerization model (CIOM) proposes that antigen binding induces a conformational change of the monomeric BCR, resulting in the dimerization of the membrane proximal CH domain of the BCR followed by receptor signaling (<a href=\"#bib42\">Tolar and Pierce, 2010</a>). However, recent studies show that antigen receptors on resting T and B cells are not uniformly distributed but are rather organized in nanoclusters inside protein islands (<a href=\"#bib22\">Lillemeier et al., 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib21\">2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Mattila et al., 2013</a>). In earlier biochemical studies employing the blue-native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (BN-PAGE) technique, we provided the first evidence for the oligomeric organization of the BCR (<a href=\"#bib36\">Schamel and Reth, 2000</a>). Furthermore, with a quantitative bifluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay, we found that the resting BCR forms stable dimers on the cell surface while a BCR mutant that cannot form dimers is hyperactive and cannot be stably expressed on the B cell surface (<a href=\"#bib51\">Yang and Reth, 2010b</a>). We thus have proposed the dissociation-activation model (DAM) whereby BCR activation is initiated by the dissociation of signaling-inert BCR oligomers (<a href=\"#bib50\">Yang and Reth, 2010a</a>). We here explore the nanoscale organization of the BCR at a 10\u201320 nm resolution with a modified version of PLA. With this technique, we have found direct evidence for the opening of BCR dimers during B cell activation and show that the kinase Syk plays an essential role in this process."

To analyze the BCR conformation in the nanoscale range, we employ different versions of the PLA method using DNA-oligo-coupled antibodies, a rolling circle amplification and detection by fluorescence-coupled oligonucleotides (<a href=\"#bib40\">Soderberg et al., 2008</a>). The classical PLA method (2-PLA) involves secondary antibodies and detects the proximity of two molecules in the 10\u201380 nm range. By coupling the DNA oligos directly to primary antibodies (1-PLA), or to Fab fragments (Fab-PLA), we narrowed the detection range of this assay down to 10\u201340 nm and 10\u201320 nm, respectively (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A\u2013C</a>). We then used these three PLA assays, and a monoclonal antibody directed against the constant part of IgM, to analyze the BCR organization on resting or activated TKO-MD B cells stimulated for 5 min with antigen (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D\u2013F</a>). TKO-MD is a pro-B cell line derived from RAG, Lambda5, SLP-65 triple-deficient mouse bone marrow which is transfected to express an IgM- and IgD-BCR specific for the hapten 4-hydroxy-5-iodo-3-nitrophenyl acetyl (NIP) (<a href=\"#bib24\">Meixlsperger et al., 2007</a>). As indicated by the numbers of fluorescent dots, the 2-PLA and 1-PLA are more sensitive than the Fab-PLA, a phenomenon that is explained by the avidity associated with divalent antibody binding. However, only the Fab-PLA showed a clear difference in the relative IgM:IgM conformation or distance between resting and activated B cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). Importantly, we are using non-permeabilized, fixed B cells in these assays. This allows us to analyze the organization of molecules specifically on the cell surface without detecting intracellular complexes of these molecules."

PLA is a sampling method that, by measuring a few interactions per cell, allows conclusions to be drawn about the behavior of a larger pool of molecules. If we increase the Fab concentration, we can measure many more IgM:IgM interactions on resting but not on activated B cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H,I</a>). However, at these concentrations, the signals (red blobs) are often overlapping, making it more difficult to quantify. We therefore use a concentration of the oligo-labeled Fab fragment that detects 5\u201310 interactions on each cell and collect data from hundreds of B cells in each experiment.

To provide further proof that the Fab-PLA method is able to distinguish oligomeric from monomeric IgM, we studied different forms of soluble IgM bound to NIP-coupled latex beads (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). For this we purified monomeric and pentameric IgM from the supernatant of the anti-NIP specific hybridoma cell line B1-8 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). NIP-coupled latex beads were exposed to low amounts of either monomeric or pentameric IgM and equal IgM loading was determined by FACScan using anti-\u00b5 fluorescent antibodies (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, lower left panel). The beads were then subjected to Fab-PLA and 1-PLA. The FACScan analysis of these beads shows that Fab-PLA detects the pentameric IgM but not the loosely spaced monomeric IgM whereas 1-PLA detects both forms of IgM equally well (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, compare upper and lower panels). This result clearly shows that the Fab-PLA specifically detects oligomeric forms of IgM be it the soluble IgM pentamer or the oligomeric IgM-BCR on the B cell surface. In a recent structural study of pentameric IgM, it was shown that the constant domains of IgM are no further apart from each other than 5\u20136 nm (<a href=\"#bib6\">Czajkowsky and Shao, 2009</a>), a distance that can be easily bridged by the anti-IgM Fabs used for the Fab-PLA method."

In contrast to the H:L, the IgM:IgM and IgD:IgD (see below) Fab-PLA signal is consistently lost in activated B cells suggesting that the later assays detect dynamics states of a protein complex and we think that this is the oligomer to monomer transition of the BCR. In case of the IgD-BCR, we found direct evidence for this notion, because the IgD:IgD Fab-PLA detects the wild-type receptor but barely detects a mutant IgD-BCR that is defective in oligomer formation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>).

These treatments also result in strong ITAM phosphorylation. We thus wondered whether the detected BCR opening is associated with the Syk/ITAM signal amplification process we have described previously (<a href=\"#bib32\">Rolli et al., 2002</a>) and that was recently confirmed by another study (<a href=\"#bib26\">Mukherjee et al., 2013</a>). To test this, we pretreated splenic B cells with the Src-family kinase inhibitor PP2, or the Syk inhibitor R406, prior to their activation with Lat-A (<a href=\"#bib3\">Braselmann et al., 2006</a>). While the PP2-treatment only delays the opening of the IgM-BCR oligomer, this process no longer occurs in the presence of the Syk inhibitor R406 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>). The dependence on Syk activity was also found for B cells stimulated with the antigen NIP-BSA (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). To exclude that the block in BCR opening by PP2 or R406 is not due to off-target effects of these inhibitors, we analyzed the BCR conformation in Lyn- or Syk-deficient splenic B cells before and after their activation with Lat-A (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). The IgM:IgM Fab-PLA results of these genetically altered B cells were similar to those previously observed using kinase inhibitors and suggests that Syk not only signals downstream but also alters the BCR conformation via an inside-out signaling process."

Accordingly, it may be that Syk binding to the phosphorylated ITAM tyrosines induces receptor opening. We therefore used Ig\u03b1:Syk Fab-PLA to analyze whether or not the kinase inhibitors PP2 and R406 influence the binding of Syk to the BCR in Lat-A-stimulated B cells. For this study, the B cells were fixed and permeabilized to allow probing of the inner surface of the plasma membrane. This analysis shows that the BCR/Syk interaction is induced within 1 min of Lat-A treatment (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D,E</a>). This interaction is delayed by PP2 whereas the Syk inhibitor R406 completely blocks the recruitment of Syk to the BCR. The inside-out signaling function of Syk is thus likely to be mediated not only by its kinase activity, but also by the binding of Syk to the ITAM sequences of the BCR. To again exclude off-target effects of inhibitors, we studied the ITAM/Syk association also in Lyn- and Syk-deficient splenic B cells before or after their activation with Lat-A (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>). Note that the ITAM/Syk interaction is delayed but not prevented in Lyn-deficient B cells, whereas the Ig\u03b1:Syk Fab-PLA in Syk-deficient B cells gave no signal due to the absence of Syk."

If this were true, one would predict that under conditions of Syk inhibition, B cells would require more antigen for the opening of the many IgM-BCR oligomer complexes on their cell surface. To test for this, we exposed TKO-M cells for different times to the Syk inhibitor R406 (5 \u03bcM) and then stimulated these B cells for 5 min with increasing doses of antigen (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>). Note that in the cytosol there exists an equilibrium between a closed autoinhibited and an open active form of Syk. As the inhibitor is interacting only with the latter form, it takes some time for the majority of Syk molecules in the cell to be blocked by the inhibitor. Syk-sufficient cells require 10 ng/ml of antigen to lose the IgM:IgM Fab-PLA signal whereas B cell exposed for 60 min to the Syk inhibitor lose the IgM:IgM Fab-PLA signal only at 10\u201350 times higher (250\u2013500 ng/ml) antigen doses. This titration experiment supports the notion that the Syk/BCR inside-out signaling increases the sensitivity of B cells to low doses of antigen. B cell activation may thus involve two distinct phases (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5H</a>). First an outside-in signal where limited amounts of antigens open a few BCR dimers, allowing them to form active BCR/Syk seed complexes that then diffuse in the membrane and phosphorylate neighboring BCR oligomers. This process then results in more Syk recruitment, BCR opening and the amplification of the BCR signal via an inside-out signaling mechanism."

On IgM-BCR-expressing S2 cells, we detect receptor dimers by IgM:IgM Fab-PLA (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>). The IgM:IgM Fab-PLA signal is drastically reduced on S2 cells co-expressing the IgM-BCR together with a GFP-Syk fusion protein (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, second panel and <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>, second bar). The opening of the BCR by Syk could be either due to the phosphorylation of the ITAM tyrosines or to the binding of the tandem SH2 domains to the ppITAM sequences. To distinguish between these possibilities, we separated the enzymatic and binding domain of Syk from each other. For this, we expressed in S2 cells the chimeric Syk protein nLyn-Syk-KD consisting of the N-terminal myristoylation anchor of Lyn and the isolated Syk kinase domain either alone or in combination with a GFP-(SH2)2 construct containing the tandem SH2 domains of Syk. S2 cells expressing the IgM-BCR only together with nLyn-Syk-KD show tyrosine phosphorylation of Ig\u03b1 (data not shown) but no loss of the IgM:IgM Fab-PLA signal (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, third panel and <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>, third bar). However, the oligomeric IgM-BCR opened when we co-expressed nLyn-Syk-KD together with either the GFP-(SH2)2 or the kinase negative GFP-Syk-K<sup>-</sup> constructs that alone did not alter the IgM-BCR conformation (compare relevant panels and bars in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>). Together these data indicate that it is not the phosphorylation of the ITAM tyrosines but rather the binding of the Syk to the receptor that results in the opening of BCR oligomers (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>)."

CD19-deficient B cells have a compromised immune response to antigen and are defective in BCR microcluster formation (<a href=\"#bib31\">Rickert et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Depoil et al., 2008</a>). We therefore studied the IgM:CD19 and IgD:CD19 organization on resting and activated TKO-MD B cells by Fab-PLA (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,B</a>). This analysis shows that CD19 is only found in close association with the activated but not with the resting IgM-BCR (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). Interestingly, in this assay, the results for the IgD-BCR were opposite to those observed for IgM. CD19 is found together with the resting IgD-BCR and dissociates from this receptor upon BCR activation (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). The quantification of these data shows, for the first time, that the CD19:BCR interaction is Ig class specific and remodeled upon B cell activation (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,B</a>, right panel). Compared to CD19, less is known about the function of CD20 on the B cell surface but this molecule plays an important role as the target of the therapeutic antibody rituximab (<a href=\"#bib19\">Korhonen and Moilanen, 2010</a>).

TKO-M and TKO-D cells that only express one class of BCR behave similarly to the TKO-MD cells (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Resting TKO-D cells display a close proximity between the IgD-BCR and the CD19/CD20 module but lose this interaction upon BCR stimulation, while the IgM-BCR gains contact to the CD19/CD20 module only upon B cell activation. These results suggest that on resting B cells, the CD19/CD20 module resides in a membrane compartment that is also targeted by the IgD-BCR but that is not dependent on IgD expression. To learn more about the lipid composition of this compartment, we labeled the cholera toxin B-subunit (CTB) with one of the PLA oligos. CTB binds with high affinity to GM1 gangliosides, glycolipids that are highly expressed in lipid ordered domains (<a href=\"#bib16\">Kenworthy et al., 2000</a>). The IgD:CTB and IgM:CTB PLA showed that on resting B cells, GM1 gangliosides are found in close proximity to the IgD-BCR, whereas the IgM-BCR gains access to large amounts of these lipids only upon B cell activation (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7H,G</a>). The GPI-linked protein CD52 (<a href=\"#bib47\">Treumann et al., 1995</a>) showed a distribution by Fab-PLA similar to that seen for the GM1 gangliosides (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Together, these studies suggest that the IgM-BCR and the IgD-BCR are localized on the B cell surface in different membrane areas that are reorganized upon B cell activation."

Our analysis suggest that antigen-dependent B cell activation is accompanied by a transition from a tightly packed BCR oligomer to a more loosely spaced BCR-antigen or BCR-Syk clusters that can no longer be detected by Fab-PLA (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1J</a>, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5H</a>). Our findings support the DAM hypothesis (<a href=\"#bib50\">Yang and Reth, 2010a</a>, <a href=\"#bib51\">2010b</a>), and in addition show for the first time that the kinase Syk is necessary and sufficient for the opening of the oligomeric BCR. Importantly, all these observations could only be made with Fab-PLA but not with 1-PLA or the classical 2-PLA techniques, indicating that these receptor reorganization processes occur at 10\u201320 nm distances. The reason why only Fab-PLA can reliably monitor the alterations of the BCR conformation may be related to the structure of this receptor. Like an antibody, the BCR contains flexible Fab arms and it maybe the extension of these arms that moves the BCR monomers apart from each other so that Fab-PLA can no longer detect their proximity (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1J</a>). Another important advantage of Fab-PLA is that it does not require the overexpression of wild type or altered (tagged) proteins in cell lines but allows studying the nanoscale organization of unchanged proteins on primary cells. The Fab-PLA is a surprisingly robust technique that detects the same BCR alterations in B cell lines or normal B cells of either mouse or human origin, using three different stimulation protocols and different sets of Fab fragments (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>)."

These studies have suggested that receptor aggregation rather than dissociation is the earliest event in B cell activation. However, due to the diffraction barrier of visible light of 250 nm (<a href=\"#bib14\">Huang et al., 2010</a>), these live cell imaging studies could never directly monitor the conformation and nanoscale organization of the BCR on resting or activated B cells. In contrast to the expectations, several studies have now shown that antigen receptors on resting lymphocytes are not uniformly distributed monomers but rather pre-organized in nanoclusters or protein islands. The existence of these structures was first indicated by electron microscopy studies (<a href=\"#bib49\">Wilson et al., 2000</a>) and recently confirmed by photo-activated localization microscopy (PALM) (<a href=\"#bib22\">Lillemeier et al., 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib21\">2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Sherman et al., 2011</a>) and direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM) (<a href=\"#bib23\">Mattila et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Owen et al., 2013</a>). In contrast to the BCR which is predominantly oligomeric, the T cell antigen receptor (TCR) seems to exist in an equilibrium between monomeric and oligomeric forms (<a href=\"#bib53\">Schamel et al., 2005</a>). This may be the reason why TCR nanoclusters are more variable in size than the BCR nanoclusters (<a href=\"#bib21\">Lillemeier et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Sherman et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Mattila et al., 2013</a>). However, common to the two cell types is the finding that upon activation the nanoclusters can form microclusters or cap structures (<a href=\"#bib21\">Lillemeier et al., 2010</a>). Receptor dissociation and aggregation are thus not mutually exclusive events but rather processes that occur at different size levels and time points during B cell activation. Nanoclusters containing opened BCR presumably aggregate to form the microclusters previously detected by live cell imaging studies of activated lymphocytes."

Indeed, CD19-deficient mice are defective in B cell development and function (<a href=\"#bib31\">Rickert et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Sato et al., 1997</a>). It has been shown that CD19 and IgM co-cap on activated B cells (<a href=\"#bib29\">Pesando et al., 1989</a>) and it thus was no surprise to find the two receptors in close proximity to each other on these cells. Remarkably, however, we found that on resting B cells, CD19 and CD20 are in close proximity to the IgD-BCR but not the IgM-BCR. The resting IgD-BCR seems to be also associated with lipid ordered domains, as indicated by the proximity of this receptor to GM1 gangliosides and the GPI-linked protein CD52. The co-localization of the IgM-BCR with CD19 and lipid ordered domains is a hallmark of B cell activation but this is apparently not the case for the IgD-BCR on resting B lymphocytes. Thus, the IgD-BCR protein islands are likely to contain inhibitory factors which prevent signaling and we are currently searching for such molecules by Fab-PLA. These studies may help to elucidate the still enigmatic function of IgD on the B cell surface (<a href=\"#bib12\">Geisberger et al., 2006</a>)."

This discovery was only possible because Fab-PLA allows us, for the first time, to specifically monitor the oligomeric organization of the IgM molecule either in solution (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>) or on the B cell surface. Our results indicate that Syk opens the BCR by an inside-out-signaling mechanism and makes B cells highly sensitive to antigen engagement by a feed-forward amplification process. An inside-out-signaling mechanism has previously been found to play a role in the activation of CD28 by the TCR (<a href=\"#bib33\">Sanchez-Lockhart et al., 2011</a>) and the regulation of integrin receptors such as LFA-1 (<a href=\"#bib48\">Wang, 2012</a>). In the latter case it is the binding of talin to the cytosolic tail of the \u03b2-chain that displaces the \u03b1-tail from its complex with the \u03b2-tail, thus moving the two tails apart. This intracellular movement is translated into an extracellular conformational change that opens the integrin for ligand binding. Similarly, the binding of Syk to the phosphorylated ITAM sequences may distort the Ig\u03b1/Ig\u03b2 tails in such a way that it destabilizes the BCR oligomer, thus resulting in BCR opening and activation. In line with this scenario, we found that a mutation of the disulfide bridge between Ig\u03b1 and Ig\u03b2, in combination with a transmembrane mutation of mIgD, prevents the formation of the IgD-BCR oligomer (<a href=\"#bib51\">Yang and Reth, 2010b</a>)."

With the inside-out Syk/BCR signaling process described here only a few antigen/BCR/Syk complexes can activate all antigen receptors on the B cell surface, thus leading to signal amplification and full B cell activation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5H</a>). This mechanism may allow B cells to become active even under limited antigen conditions. Our findings on the BCR/Syk signal amplification could be important for a better understanding of several human diseases. Recent data show that BCR components are frequently mutated in human leukemia (<a href=\"#bib7\">Davis et al., 2010</a>) and that an autonomously signaling BCR can act as a tumor promoter for B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (<a href=\"#bib9\">Duhren-von Minden et al., 2012</a>). Clearly, it is important to learn more about the nanoscale BCR organization and its regulation in different disease settings."

In particular, there are concerns about the interpretation of the PLA data and how well the PLA analysis measures distance between the two BCR subunits, and whether your results mean that the BCR dimers actually dissociate or rather reorient and/or undergo a conformational rearrangement.

Clearly, they need to demonstrate that the PLA assays are indeed sensitive to the distances they theorize, for example, by creating artificial surfaces displaying BCRs at these various distances or making artificial (covalent) dimers. In this regard, do the authors know the stoichiometry of binding of the PLAs to the cells? Does the \u03bc-specific mAb bind to both IgH chains in the BCR? If so does this contribute to signal?"

The use of an independent approach to validate the PLA results and determine whether true dissociation actually occurs could strengthen the conclusions. Ideally, the authors should back-up their PLA data with data generated by a completely different technique, such as EM or native gels. If results could be obtained using another method in a reasonable time frame, then these should be added. In addition, the use of BiFC to show that the Syk inhibitor also blocks the \u201copening\u201d of the oligomer measured by this technique would be reassuring. In summary, unless they can provide incontrovertible evidence that dissociation occurs, the word dissociation should be replaced with \u201copening\u201d or an equivalent term."

This points more to an opening of the receptor dimer, as the domains are now less 40 nm apart, rather than a complete dissociation. How would the authors interpret a conformational change rather than dissociation in terms of the mechanism of BCR activation?"

Clearly, they need to demonstrate that the PLA assays are indeed sensitive to the distances they theorize, for example, by creating artificial surfaces displaying BCRs at these various distances or making artificial (covalent) dimers. In this regard, do the authors know the stoichiometry of binding of the PLAs to the cells? Does the \u03bc-specific mAb bind to both IgH chains in the BCR? If so does this contribute to signal?</i>"

It turns out that for PLA we have to place such molecules on a surface in a way that we cannot properly control their proximity. It is thus very difficult to create a uniform surface with defined epitope spacing. However, by thinking about this we came up with an even better solution for this problem; instead of testing artificial surfaces or dimers we studied a natural molecule existing as either monomer or oligomer namely soluble IgM. We thus purified monomeric and pentameric IgM and bound limiting amounts of them to hapten-coupled latex beads. After controlling equal loading of the beads we conducted Fab-PLA and 1-PLA with the monomeric or pentameric IgM containing beads. The results were clear-cut. Our Fab-PLA method could only detect the pentameric but not the monomeric IgM, whereas 1-PLA detected both IgM forms equally well (see new <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). This is a direct proof that only Fab-PLA but no other method is specifically detecting the oligomeric BCR organization. In the first version of our manuscript we came to the same conclusion by studying a wild type or a double mutant IgD-BCR unable to form oligomers (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). We thus think that Fab-PLA is the method of choice to monitor nanoscale alterations in receptor organisation. Although, we do not know whether the used \u03bc-specific mAb has two or (more likely) only one epitope per monomeric IgM this is not relevant for our method as we now have shown that Fab-PLA does not detect isolated IgM monomers unless they are spaced in close proximity to each other."

Ideally, the authors should back-up their PLA data with data generated by a completely different technique, such as EM or native gels. If results could be obtained using another method in a reasonable time frame, then these should be added. In addition, the use of BiFC to show that the Syk inhibitor also blocks the \u201copening\u201d of the oligomer measured by this technique would be reassuring.

Unfortunately, this is not possible. Once the fluorophore has formed the two halves of GFP are linked to each other and cannot be dissociated in living cells (Hu et al. 2002).

It is only the combination between the membrane-bound kinase domain and the GFP-(SH2)2 construct that results in BCR opening, showing that it is the binding of Syk and not the phosphorylation that initiates the opening process. This notion is also supported by our older data showing that the inhibition of the kinase activity of Syk prevents not only receptor opening but also the binding of Syk to the BCR (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D and 5E</a>).
