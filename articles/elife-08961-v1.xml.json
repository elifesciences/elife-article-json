Site-specific proteolysis and crosslinking were used to probe the architecture of oligomers formed by the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Hsp70, BiP. These were found to consist of adjacent protomers engaging the interdomain linker of one molecule in the substrate binding site of another, attenuating the chaperone function of oligomeric BiP. Native gel electrophoresis revealed a rapidly-modulated reciprocal relationship between the burden of unfolded proteins and BiP oligomers and slower equilibration between oligomers and inactive, covalently-modified BiP. Lumenal ER calcium depletion caused rapid oligomerization of mammalian BiP and a coincidental diminution in substrate binding, pointing to the relative inertness of the oligomers. Thus, equilibration between inactive oligomers and active monomeric BiP is poised to buffer fluctuations in ER unfolded protein load on a rapid timescale attainable neither by inter-conversion of active and covalently-modified BiP nor by the conventional unfolded protein response."

Site-specific proteolysis and crosslinking were used to probe the architecture of oligomers formed by the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Hsp70, BiP. These were found to consist of adjacent protomers engaging the interdomain linker of one molecule in the substrate binding site of another, attenuating the chaperone function of oligomeric BiP. Native gel electrophoresis revealed a rapidly-modulated reciprocal relationship between the burden of unfolded proteins and BiP oligomers and slower equilibration between oligomers and inactive, covalently-modified BiP. Lumenal ER calcium depletion caused rapid oligomerization of mammalian BiP and a coincidental diminution in substrate binding, pointing to the relative inertness of the oligomers. Thus, equilibration between inactive oligomers and active monomeric BiP is poised to buffer fluctuations in ER unfolded protein load on a rapid timescale attainable neither by inter-conversion of active and covalently-modified BiP nor by the conventional unfolded protein response."

Whilst the interrelation of ADP ribosylation and AMPylation remain to be worked out, covalently modified BiP is understood to represent an inactive buffer that can be drawn upon in time of need, by removal of the modifications, thereby increasing the capacity of the ER to cope with enhanced unfolded protein burden whilst minimizing the cost of over-chaperoning.

(<i>ii</i>) Exposure to SubA by release of the linker from the SBD of adjacent protomers in the oligomer. In the absence of ATP the oligomers are very stable with a low off rate (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>). Thus the addition of SubA to the ATP-depleted sample leads to rapid cleavage of any wildtype BiP monomers (and of the exposed protomer C from oligomers, see cartoon in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>) with the persistence of a fraction of SubA resistant oligomeric BiP, which equilibrates very slowly with cleavage susceptible monomers. In case of the wildtype BiP, effect <i>ii</i> was seen to dominate, but in BiP<sup>V461F</sup> (that is unable to engage the linker in its SBD), effect <i>i</i> dominates (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Of note, the divergent consequences of ATP addition to the two SubA cleavage reactions presented in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, argues against an important role for nucleotide in SubA action."

Afterwards, samples were taken and proteins in the remaining reaction mixtures were denatured with 6 M guanidine hydrochloride (GuHCl) and bound to nickel-affinity beads (Ni-NTA agarose) in presence of 2 mM \u03b2-mecaptoethanol and 15 mM imidazole. The beads were washed with 4 M GuHCl in HKM buffer and the retained N-terminal BiP fragments were eluted with SDS sample buffer containing 250 mM imidazole. As controls wt BiP, digested with the linker-specific protease SubA, and undigested BiP<sup>lidless</sup> were affinity purified in parallel. The samples taken before affinity purification (Input) and the eluted polypeptides (Pulldown) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining. Full-length proteins (FL) and their proteolytic fragments (1\u20136) that resulted from digestion with Proteinase K are indicated. Note the similar migration of cleavage fragment 2 and BiP<sup>lidless</sup>, which lacks part of the C-terminal lid structure. In addition, the nucleotide binding domain (NBD) and the substrate binding domain (SBD), generated by digestion of wildtype BiP with SubA, migrate very similar to fragments 3 and 4, respectively. Also note that fragment 2 (which reports on the ATP-induced compact conformation of the protein) as well as fragments 1 and 3 represent N-terminal cleavage products, since they were efficiently retained on nickel-beads under denaturing conditions. This further implies that fragment 2 results from cleavage of BiP within the C-terminal lid of the open SBD, which is exposed in the ATP-bound conformation (<a href=\"#bib31\">Kityk et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Qi et al., 2013</a>)."

Such limited proteolysis of wildtype BiP generated a protected fragment corresponding in mass to the compact NBD (\u223c44 kDa) as well as an N-terminal 60 kDa fragment that accumulated only in presence of ATP (species 2 in <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) and thus likely reflects protection of the linker due to its engagement in interdomain contacts.

The resistance of oligomers formed by the BiP<sup>T37G</sup> and BiP<sup>G226D</sup> mutants to dissociation by ATP, correlated with protection of the interdomain linker from cleavage by SubA (full-length BiP in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>), consistent with <i>trans</i>-engagement of their interdomain linker as a substrate by their uncoupled SBD. Together, these observations separate the allosteric effects of the ADDA mutation from its effects on oligomerization and support that defective oligomerization of BiP<sup>ADDA</sup> is imposed in <i>cis</i>, by altered composition of the mutant interdomain linker. The defect of BiP<sup>ADDA</sup> in the formation of discrete oligomers, though conspicuous, is incomplete. Impaired linker binding likely favors lower affinity interactions that involve other elements of BiP and may partially dissociate during separation by native gel electrophoresis (or SEC).

Its aberrantly fast mobility likely reflects a compact conformation of the dimer. The novel modified BiP binding partner-dependent species stood out against the background of UV-dependent changes in the mobility the FLAG-tagged BiP observed in absence of a pBpa-decorated partner; crosslinks to nucleotide likely contribute to altered mobility of UV-irradiated FLAG-tagged BiP during SDS-PAGE. By contrast, incorporation of pBpa at residues distant from the interdomain linker (R510 and T518) gave rise to a much weaker crosslink signal (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>, lanes 12 and 14 and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>).

The BiP:amylase complex that was diminished by calcium depletion in vivo was also sensitive to ATP in vitro (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11D</a>, lane 4), confirming that it represented engagement of a conventional client by BiP. These findings confirmed that ER lumenal calcium depletion, induced by a physiological ligand that promotes BiP oligomerization, also disfavored interaction of endogenous BiP with an endogenous client.

This process, revealed by monitoring the accessibility of BiP's interdomain linker to a sequence-specific protease, SubA, and by site-specific crosslinking, is conspicuous in preparations of pure proteins in vitro, and in living cells. BiP oligomerization is rapidly tuned to the physiological state of the cell, and given that oligomerization inactivates participating BiP protomers, the oligomeric form is a relatively inactive storage form of the chaperone that is accessible on a short time scale. Our findings are consistent with a model whereby competition between oligomerization and substrate binding buffers the ER against rapid fluctuations in unfolded protein load in both directions."

A crystal form of bacterial DnaK with cross-protomer binding of the interdomain linker in the SBD shows the engagement of two highly conserved aliphatic side chains of the linker in hydrophobic sites of the SBD (<a href=\"#bib12\">Chang et al., 2008</a>). Given the role of these very same side chains in allosteric coupling between the NBD and SBD, this mode of BiP oligomerization results in removal of the BiP protomers involved from the pool of active chaperones. The proposed architecture of the oligomers (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>) fits well with our finding of a single peptide binding site available in BiP oligomers formed in vitro, regardless of their size (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>).

In the absence of ATP, oligomers appear to be remarkably stable with a dissociation K<sub>1/2max</sub> in the lower micromolar range. In vivo, oligomer assembly and disassembly is likely to be influenced by co-chaperones of the DnaJ family that enhance ATP hydrolysis to promote the high affinity state and exchange factors, such as GRP170 and SIL1, that convert BiP to the low affinity state by exchanging ADP for ATP. These co-factors are likely to have an important role in the kinetics of the inter-conversion of BiP monomers to oligomers and in the competing processes of substrate binding and release. Nonetheless, the high concentration of BiP in the ER (&gt;200 \u00b5M, [<a href=\"#bib22\">Ghaemmaghami et al., 2003</a>]) and the inherent affinity of BiP protomers for one another, are consistent with a model whereby oligomerization and substrate binding compete with each other on a level playing field."

To explicitly cope with this methodological limitation, we have confined the analysis to the early stages of the perturbations that increase the unfolded protein load in the ER and employed manipulations, such as reduction of disulfide bonds by DTT, that are effective even in the absence of ongoing protein synthesis. Our observations paint a coherent picture whereby enhanced production of unfolded proteins rapidly draws on the pool of inactive, oligomeric BiP to service its growing clientele. Reports of enhanced presence of oligomers in longer-term stressed cells may have reflected the partitioning of excess chaperone produced during the activated UPR (or its cytoplasmic counterpart, the heat shock response) but made redundant following resolution of the insult (<a href=\"#bib19\">Freiden et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Thompson et al., 2012</a>). Furthermore, activation of parallel chaperones, such as the oxidative stress induced Hsp33 of bacteria, may account for regulated redundancy of the Hsp70/DnaK system, favoring oligomerization through linker engagement in the course of certain stress responses (<a href=\"#bib65\">Winter and Jakob, 2004</a>)."

Together, our observations suggest a hierarchical post-translational mechanism for maintaining balance between chaperones and their clients in the highly dynamic ER (<a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12</a>). The first line of buffering consists of oligomer formation, as the balance between chaperones and clients tips in favor of the former, and oligomer dissolution, as the balance tips the other way. Conversion of BiP to the modified, inactive form proceeds on a longer time scale. Its precise relationship to oligomerization is unclear, as both the unemployed monomer and inactive oligomer, could, in theory, serve as substrates for the modification(s). Either way it seems likely that the physiological impact of both oligomerization and modification is to enable the cell to avoid the cost of over-chaperoning (<a href=\"#bib16\">Dorner et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Feder et al., 1992</a>) without having to degrade surplus BiP as stress is resolved and to provide cells with an inactive reserve of BiP to draw upon as stress mounts, without resorting to activation of the translational and transcriptional arms of the UPR."

But oligomerization can serve as an intrinsic mechanism to inactivate excess Hsp70 in other compartments of the eukaryotic cell and indeed across phyla. In that sense oligomerization would appear to be a common primitive strand of the post-translational UPR, recruiting and inactivating Hsp70 chaperones according to need. This simple, mass action-based mechanism for regulating Hsp70 function may exist alongside other mechanisms, such as oxidation-induced domain unfolding, which may promote alternative modes of oligomerization (<a href=\"#bib66\">Winter et al., 2005</a>). Such alternative modes may account for the heterogeneity of DnaK oligomers observed by single particle electron microscopy (<a href=\"#bib61\">Thompson et al., 2012</a>)."

This apparent paradox needs to be considered in the context of observations that BiP oligomerization upon calcium depletion also correlates with less substrate binding (a feature first noted many years ago [<a href=\"#bib59\">Suzuki et al., 1991</a>] and confirmed here) and with the observation that calcium depletion-mediated oligomerization slowly draws on the modified, inactive pool of BiP. From BiP's perspective, oligomerization appears to be the primary event triggered by ER calcium efflux. This depletes the pool of active chaperones and disrupts, by mass action, chaperone-client interactions, releasing clients that would otherwise have remained bound to BiP. The ensuing, slower loss of the modified form of BiP is consistent with equilibrium between the modified form and the monomer and its latency is consistent with the need for enzymes to remove the modifications."

                        "text": "We do not understand how calcium depletion shifts the equilibrium in favor of the oligomer. In vitro, there is no measureable effect of calcium on BiP oligomerization, in either the ATP state or ADP state or in the presence of the J-factor ERdj3 or the exchange factor GRP170 (not shown), yet in vivo, ER calcium depletion promotes such oligomerization. This discrepancy could be resolved by an ER-localized J-factor whose affinity for BiP as a substrate is increased selectively as (Ca<sup>+2</sup>)<sub>ER</sub> declines. Given that the affinity of Hsp70 proteins for their substrates is governed by J-protein driven non-equilibrium mechanisms (<a href=\"#bib15\">De Los Rios and Barducci, 2014</a>), such a scenario could account for BiP favoring itself as a client (oligomerizing) over other clients, as (Ca<sup>+2</sup>)<sub>ER</sub> declines. Regardless of mechanism, one consequence of (Ca<sup>+2</sup>)<sub>ER</sub> depletion-mediated BiP oligomerization would be to also shift the equilibrium between unfolded proteins and active chaperones in favor of the former. Furthermore, given the 1:1 stoichiometry of the repressive complex formed between BiP and the lumenal, stress-sensing domains of the UPR transducers PERK and IRE1 (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bertolotti et al., 2000</a>), it seems likely that the monomer serves as a UPR repressor. Thus, (Ca<sup>+2</sup>)<sub>ER</sub> depletion-mediated oligomerization of BiP stands to contribute to UPR activation by increasing the burden of free unfolded proteins and by lowering the availability of monomeric BiP to repress the stress transducers."

                        "text": "Calcium depletion-mediated oligomerization of BiP is observed in physiological circumstances, as a consequence of engagement of cell surface receptors by activating ligands that couple to store release channels. We do not know if oligomerization of BiP and its downstream consequences are a feature that promotes fitness (i.e. a feature that has been positively selected during eukaryote evolution) or simply a reflection of limitations in the functionality of an organelle that experiences fluctuations in the concentration of calcium, imposed by other exigencies, such as the benefits of signaling in the cytosol by the released calcium. However, it is tempting to speculate that the transient excursions of UPR signaling imposed by BiP oligomerization may have some benefit. In secretory cells, such a scheme would couple signals that promote granule secretion to transient translational repression (attendant upon PERK activation [<a href=\"#bib24\">Harding et al., 1999</a>]). This may have short-term benefits in terms of diverting resources away from translation to the bio-energetically costly process of secretion. Transient activation of UPR transducers also results in elaboration of downstream effectors. These transcription factors, XBP1, ATF6 and ATF4, adapt cells to their secretory mission by promoting the latent process of ER biogenesis (<a href=\"#bib58\">Sriburi et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Lee et al., 2005</a>), and by expanding the capacity to translate mRNAs (<a href=\"#bib25\">Harding et al., 2003</a>). It is thus tempting to speculate that calcium depletion-mediated BiP oligomerization contributes to transient activation of the UPR observed in secretory cells responding to secretagogues (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kubisch and Logsdon, 2007</a>) and thereby promotes long-term coupling of the capacity to produce and process precursors of secretory proteins to the short-term demand for the secreted end product."

Using bacterial protease SubA, specific for the interdomain linker, the authors explore the role of this domain in oligomerization of Bip. Adding SubA to CHOK1 lysates in the presence of ATP increased its susceptibility to interdomain cleavage and depolymerization. Gel exclusion chromatography using purified WT Bip and mutants of SBD and linker domains further established the role for the substrate binding domain (SBD) and interdomain in oligomerization. This confirmed previous observations on ATP mediated Bip depolymerization and suggest a role for the interdomain in this process. The authors then go on to other experiments to analyze the arrangement of protomers in the Bip oligomer. Through analysis of combinations of SBD mutant (V461F), interdomain mutant (ADDA) and double mutant (ADDA-V461F) either purified or transfected into cells followed by gel filtration and native gel electrophoresis. The authors suggest <i>trans</i>-protomer engagement of the interdomain with the SBD as the mechanism of Bip oligomerization in vitro and in vivo that is independent of the helical lid. Induction of protein misfolding by most methods (dithiothreitol (DTT), cycloheximide (CHX), activation of Fv2E-PERK, tunicamycin {trade mark, serif} etc) induced depolymerization of Bip possibly to make it available to bind to unfolded proteins. However, it was observed that ER calcium depletion promoted appearance of oligomers by promoting dissociation from its substrates but the cellular function/significance for this shift in equilibrium is unknown."

Given the limitations and costs of transcriptional systems like the UPR to maintain homeostasis, a new focus has been placed on identification of more rapid post-translational adaptations that likely exist to adapt to changes in the ER protein load. This manuscript by Preissler et al. furthers our understanding of post-translational adaptation to changes in ER homoestasis and focuses on the molecular basis of oligomerization of the molecular chaperone BiP. Several prior studies have identified the propensity of Hsp70 s to oligomerize, however this study is one of the few to focus on a molecular basis for oligomerization. The manuscript convincingly presents data supporting a mechanism for <i>trans-</i>engagement of BiP protomers to facilitate oligomerization.

The authors carry out a large number of clever experiments to test this model, and all the data they present are consistent with the proposed mode of interaction. The case is therefore persuasive. The other work presented in this paper probes the impact of the folding state of the ER and the calcium content on oligomerization, and all of this work is well-conceived and implemented. The expertise of the senior authors is clearly manifest in the way the experiments are designed and interpreted.

This is a weakness of this otherwise top-notch paper: And it would seem the authors are equipped to address this question by cross-linking and mass spectrometry experiments. Another improvement of the paper that seems quite do-able is more direct characterization of the state of oligomerization (dimer, trimer, etc).

The authors now include several experiments that aim to decouple the impact of allosteric mutations from linker disruption.

We recognize the validity of this criticism, as it is known that the interdomain linker is required for Hsp70 chaperones to assume the domain-coupled configuration. New <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> and its accompanying two supplements confirm that BiPADDA is locked in an uncoupled configuration, as expected. However, other mutations that favor the uncoupled configuration (BiPT37 G and BiPG226D) exhibit enhanced oligomerization, as suggested by our model, whereas BiPADDA exhibits impaired oligomerization. These observations uncouple the allosteric effect of the BiPADDA mutation from its effect on oligomerization."

Furthermore, subtilisin and the related chymotrypsin class of proteases are not known to bind nucleotides or to be influenced by their presence. Thus, whilst it is formally possible that nucleotide concentrations affect some aspect of SubA activity, we interpret the observations presented in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, whereby ATP depletion promotes BiP<sup>V461F</sup> digestion whilst attenuating the digestion of BiP<sup>WT</sup>, to argue that the effects of nucleotide are, at the very least substrate-specific and more in keeping with action on the substrate than on the protease."

We humor ourselves with the idea that it could, for example, be promoted by a yet-to-be discovered ER-localized J-factor whose affinity for BiP as a substrate is increased selectively as [Ca<sup>+2</sup>]<sub>ER</sub> declines. Given that the affinity of Hsp70 proteins for their substrates is governed by J-protein driven non-equilibrium mechanisms (<a href=\"#bib15\">De Los Rios and Barducci, 2014</a>), such a scenario could account for BiP favoring itself as a client (oligomerizing) over other clients, as [Ca<sup>+2</sup>]<sub>ER</sub> declines. For now, however, we must set aside these pleasing and plausible (to us) speculations and accept that this is an unresolved mystery. In this study [Ca<sup>+2</sup>]<sub>ER</sub> depletion-mediated BiP oligomerisation is exploited merely to examine the consequences of in vivo modulation of the oligomeric status of BiP.

This idea is consistent with early observations made by the Klausner lab (and reproduced here, <a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11</a>) in which ER calcium depletion promoted dissociation of complexes between BiP and a sentinel client (an unassembled subunit of the T-cell receptor, in that case, <a href=\"#bib59\">Suzuki et al., 1991</a>).

In the absence of ATP the oligomers are very stable with a low off rate. Thus the addition of SubA to the ATP<sup>minus</sup> sample leads to rapid cleavage of BiP monomers (and of the exposed protomer C from the oligomer, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>) with the persistence of a fraction of SubA resistant oligomeric BiP, which equilibrates very slowly with monomers."

MALS validates the mass of complex I as that of a BiP monomer, complex II a dimer and complex III a trimer and confirm that these are distinct oligomeric species, as opposed to alternative conformations of a distinct species. As the quantization of BiP into discrete species follows a similar hierarchy on size exclusion chromatography and on native gels, we believe the insight afforded by MALS on the identity of the former is also informative in regards to the latter."

The conclusion that the ADDA mutation exerts its effects on oligomerization because it has low affinity for BiP\u2019s peptide binding site is further supported by a new experiment (suggested by a reviewer) comparing the ability of an established BiP binding peptide [HTFPAVL], the wildtype interdomain linker [DTGDLVLLD] and the ADDA mutant derivative [DTGDADDAD] to compete for BiP oligomerization in vitro.
