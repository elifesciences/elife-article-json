To test whether exosomal RNAs also contribute to changes in gene expression in recipient cells, and whether mutant <i>KRAS</i> might regulate the composition of secreted miRNAs, we compared small RNAs of cells and matched exosomes from isogenic CRC cell lines differing only in <i>KRAS</i> status. We show that exosomal profiles are distinct from cellular profiles, and mutant exosomes cluster separately from wild type <i>KRAS</i> exosomes. <i>miR-10b</i> was selectively increased in wild type exosomes while <i>miR-100</i> was increased in mutant exosomes. Neutral sphingomyelinase inhibition caused accumulation of <i>miR-100</i> only in mutant cells, suggesting <i>KRAS</i>-dependent miRNA export. In Transwell co-culture experiments, mutant donor cells conferred <i>miR-100</i>-mediated target repression in wild type recipient cells. These findings suggest extracellular miRNAs can function in target cells and uncover a potential new mode of action for mutant <i>KRAS</i> in CRC."
