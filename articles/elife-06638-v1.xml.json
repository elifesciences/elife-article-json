Colonization and infection depend on specific molecular interactions at the host-microbe interface that involve microbial surface proteins, or adhesins. To date, adhesins are only known to bind to host receptors non-covalently. Here we show that the streptococcal surface protein SfbI mediates covalent interaction with the host protein fibrinogen using an unusual internal thioester bond as a \u2018chemical harpoon\u2019. This cross-linking reaction allows bacterial attachment to fibrin and SfbI binding to human cells in a model of inflammation. Thioester-containing domains are unexpectedly prevalent in Gram-positive bacteria, including many clinically relevant pathogens. Our findings support bacterial-encoded covalent binding as a new molecular principle in host-microbe interactions. This represents an as yet unexploited target to treat bacterial infection and may also offer novel opportunities for engineering beneficial interactions."

Colonization and infection depend on specific molecular interactions at the host-microbe interface that involve microbial surface proteins, or adhesins. To date, adhesins are only known to bind to host receptors non-covalently. Here we show that the streptococcal surface protein SfbI mediates covalent interaction with the host protein fibrinogen using an unusual internal thioester bond as a \u2018chemical harpoon\u2019. This cross-linking reaction allows bacterial attachment to fibrin and SfbI binding to human cells in a model of inflammation. Thioester-containing domains are unexpectedly prevalent in Gram-positive bacteria, including many clinically relevant pathogens. Our findings support bacterial-encoded covalent binding as a new molecular principle in host-microbe interactions. This represents an as yet unexploited target to treat bacterial infection and may also offer novel opportunities for engineering beneficial interactions."

Further experiments revealed that SfbI strongly binds to human cells grown in the lab under conditions that mimic tissue inflammation. Finally, Walden, Edwards et al. made a mutant version of SfbI that did not contain a thioester, and found that it could not interact with fibrinogen nor bind to human cells."

Through specific interactions, these proteins can define host and tissue tropism, providing niche environments and a competitive advantage in the search for nutrients. Bacterial adhesins bind either directly to integral host cell surface components, such as integrins or carbohydrates, or they interact with components of the extracellular matrix resulting in indirect binding to receptors on the host cell surface (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kline et al., 2009</a>). Such molecular interactions that define the host-microbe interface are generally non-covalent in nature and frequently involve extensive intermolecular interfaces and multivalent binding. The surprising discovery of internal thioester bonds in the pilus tip adhesin Cpa from the Gram-positive human pathogen <i>Streptococcus pyogenes</i> raised the possibility of pathogen-encoded covalent adhesion (<a href=\"#bib41\">Pointon et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Linke-Winnebeck et al., 2014</a>). Internal thioester bonds are formed between the side chains of Cys and Gln residues, most likely self-generated by a favorable environment during protein folding. Internal thioesters have previously only been observed in mammalian complement proteins C3 and C4 (<a href=\"#bib29\">Law and Dodds, 1997</a>) and related proteins (<a href=\"#bib12\">Dodds and Law, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Lin et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Cherry and Silverman, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Wong and Dessen, 2014</a>). Complement thioester proteins are large, multi-domain constructs that upon proteolytic activation undergo a conformational change that exposes the reactive thioester (<a href=\"#bib20\">Janssen et al., 2006</a>). This is thought to react with nucleophiles on the surface of pathogens, thus mediating irreversible host-encoded covalent tagging of the pathogens for elimination by the host immune system. However, to the best of our knowledge, definitive evidence that internal thioesters in complement proteins deliver an intermolecular bond with a pathogen target is lacking, and it is not clear if target binding is specific or non-specific. Cpa and complement proteins share no identifiable sequence or structural relationship and therefore appear to be evolutionarily distinct. The thioester domains of Cpa are found in a much less complex structural context and do not require proteolytic activation. The only similarity to complement appears to be that the same strategy, a \u2018chemical harpoon\u2019, has evolved independently in bacteria and complement-related proteins for the purpose of irreversible binding."

Unlike intramolecular isopeptide or ester bonds, the role of thioesters does not appear to be protein stabilization (<a href=\"#bib53\">Walden et al., 2014</a>). Instead, by analogy to complement, thioesters presented on bacterial surfaces may react with nucleophilic groups on host tissue targets, thus establishing pathogen-encoded covalent adhesion. Indeed, binding of <i>S. pyogenes</i> to mammalian cells in vitro is severely impaired when an engineered Cpa variant lacking the thioester is expressed (<a href=\"#bib41\">Pointon et al., 2010</a>). While this does not confirm covalent attachment, it supports a role for the reactive bond in bacterial adhesion. Interestingly, a recent study showed covalent bond formation between a Cpa thioester domain and the small molecule nucleophile spermidine, confirming the accessibility and reactivity of the thioester (<a href=\"#bib32\">Linke-Winnebeck et al., 2014</a>). However, the molecular mechanisms of targeting and covalent binding to a relevant host receptor have yet to be discovered."

This suggests that thioester domains may target distinct receptors and have a widespread but currently unappreciated role in mediating pathogen adhesion to hosts. Further, we present the identification of host fibrinogen as a covalently bound target of the streptococcal surface protein SfbI. In a thioester-dependent mechanism, SfbI reacts with one specific lysine residue in fibrinogen, forming a very stable intermolecular amide bond. Using a combination of computational, biochemical, structural and cell-based assays we reveal a novel mechanism for host adhesion mediated by a pathogen-encoded covalent interaction."

Putative TEDs appear in a variety of domain architectures (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>), but are almost always located at the N-termini of proteins containing secretion signals and C-terminal LPXTG cell wall-anchoring motifs (<a href=\"#bib45\">Schneewind and Missiakas, 2014</a>). Most TED-containing proteins are also predicted to contain intramolecular isopeptide and/or ester domains, usually present in tandem repeat arrays. Like isopeptide domains (sIPDs) in pilus assemblies (<a href=\"#bib22\">Kang et al., 2007</a>), these repeats probably act as \u2018stalks\u2019 presenting the TED away from the bacterial surface. We refer to these as TIE (thioester, isopeptide, ester domain) proteins. Other domains commonly associated with putative TEDs are fibronectin-binding repeats and proline-rich regions."

Secondary structure predictions suggest conservation of TED topology, with a central helical region comprising three core helices lying between predicted \u03b2-sheet regions. Sequence similarities are mainly limited to three short regions (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). The only fully conserved residues, the thioester-forming Cys and Gln, are found in a [YFL]C\u03a6\u03b6 motif (where \u03a6 is any hydrophobic and \u03b6 any hydrophilic residue) and a weak \u03a6Q\u03b6\u03a6\u03a6 motif, respectively. Both motifs are consistently predicted to reside in a \u03b2-sheet secondary structure context. A TQxx\u03a6W\u03a6x\u03b6 \u03b1-helical motif, where x is any residue (previously TQxA(I/V)W [<a href=\"#bib32\">Linke-Winnebeck et al., 2014</a>]) is conserved in the central region of most, though not all putative TEDs. Mutagenesis of a Cpa-TED demonstrated that neither the Gln nor Trp of this motif is essential for thioester formation (<a href=\"#bib32\">Linke-Winnebeck et al., 2014</a>), a notion supported by lack of full conservation of any TQxx\u03a6W\u03a6x\u03b6 motif residue (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

Seven TEDs were produced as Cys to Ala variants, targeting the Cys of the [YFL]C\u03a6\u03b6 motif. For each of these variants, the experimentally determined molecular masses conformed to predicted values (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>), confirming that the \u221217 Da differences observed for the native proteins are attributable to internal thioesters. For class-II TEDs (BaTIE, SaTIE and CdTEP) the presence of internal thioesters and the identities of the thioester-forming Gln were established by tryptic-digest LC-MS/MS of the proteins after reacting the thioester bond with the small nucleophile methylamine (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). This analysis lends confidence to our definition of domain boundaries of class-II TEDs, which often lack an obvious \u03a6Q\u03b6\u03a6\u03a6 motif to define the thioester-forming Gln from sequence alone (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

Despite pairwise sequence identities as low as 12% (<a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>), implying no difference from chance, the overall structures of all TEDs solved to date are remarkably similar (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). The three native TED structures determined here show continuous electron density between the Cys and Gln side chains predicted to form the thioesters (SfbI-A40-TED: Cys109-Gln261, PnTIE-TED: Cys94-Gln247, CpTIE-TED: Cys138-Gln267, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Consistent with previous data (<a href=\"#bib41\">Pointon et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Linke-Winnebeck et al., 2014</a>), the thioesters are largely buried at the interface between \u03b1-helical and \u03b2-barrel subdomains. The thioester Cys backbone carbonyl and amide groups form hydrogen bonds to the Gln, and in some cases Trp, side chains of the TQxx\u03a6W\u03a6x\u03b6 motif of the central helix, but from the structures no obvious role of this motif for thioester bond formation is apparent. One notable difference between the TED structures is the position of the loop between the first two strands of the \u03b2-barrel, which lies adjacent to the thioester and results in very different protein surfaces around this region (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,C</a>). Given the proximity to the thioester, we suggest that this loop may be involved in interactions that define thioester target specificity, although this has yet to be tested. Furthermore, the \u03b1-helical subdomain shows a larger degree of structural variation than the \u03b2-barrel subdomain. The structure of CpTIE-TED:Cys138Ala is essentially identical to the native protein (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B,C</a>), confirming that internal thioesters are not structural determinants (<a href=\"#bib53\">Walden et al., 2014</a>)."

Of our panel of twelve TED proteins, the streptococcal protein SfbI is the most thoroughly characterized. SfbI mediates internalization of bacteria by host cells through binding to the extracellular protein fibronectin (<a href=\"#bib47\">Schwarz-Linek et al., 2006</a>). The N-terminal domain of SfbI (revealed here to be a TED) is not strictly required for this process, but defines the uptake mechanism and is a determinant of intracellular bacterial survival (<a href=\"#bib44\">Rohde et al., 2011</a>). It has also been reported to interact with fibrinogen (<a href=\"#bib23\">Katerov et al., 1998</a>). We investigated if this interaction involves thioester-dependent covalent bond formation by mixing purified TEDs with fibrinogen and analyzing the resulting samples by SDS-PAGE. For all three SfbI-TED variants (SfbI-A40-TED, SfbI-A346-TED, SfbI-A20-TED), and FbaB-TED, a new band is present at a molecular mass consistent with an adduct of each TED with one fibrinogen subunit (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Interestingly, a group of protein bands corresponding to the heterogeneous fibrinogen A\u03b1 chain (<a href=\"#bib36\">Mosesson et al., 1972</a>) show depletion in the adduct samples, which is clearest for SfbI-A20-TED with the conditions used here. This suggested that SfbI-TED and FbaB-TED were covalently binding to the A\u03b1 chain of fibrinogen. When fibrinogen is incubated with the Cys/Ala variants of the SfbI-TEDs and FbaB-TED, no adduct bands are observed (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>), suggesting their formation critically depends on the thioesters. Other TEDs did not form a fibrinogen adduct under the conditions of the assay, indicating this activity is not a generic, non-specific property of TEDs."

Peptides from the fibrinogen \u03b3 (but not the B\u03b2) chain were observed at comparably low scores. This can be explained by the presence of a fibrinogen \u03b3 dimer, commonly observed in fibrinogen samples, which has a mass similar to the TED-A\u03b1 cross-linked protein (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

TEDs were immobilized using isopeptide domain (IPD) complementation; a strategy that allowed us to use a toolbox approach for many constructs that were used in both pull-down and cell binding (described below) experiments. IPD complementation relies on the spontaneous amide bond formation between a truncated, or split, IPD of the streptococcal FbaB protein that lacks the C-terminal \u03b2-strand (sIPD), and a peptide representing this missing strand (<a href=\"#bib57\">Zakeri et al., 2012</a>). The peptide, named here isopep-tag (iPT) is used as an expression tag fused as bait to the C-termini of TEDs (TED-iPT) while the sIPD is immobilized on sepharose beads (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). The advantage of this covalent pull-down strategy is the ability to greatly reduce the amount of non-specific binding. Each of the SfbI-TEDs pulled down fibrinogen from this complex biologically relevant sample by forming an adduct with fibrinogen A\u03b1, although to differing degrees (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>; <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). For FbaB-TED, little fibrinogen was detectable and the protein appeared to bind non-covalently to albumin. All TED Cys/Ala variants failed to pull down fibrinogen from plasma. There is no evidence for covalent binding of TEDs to any other protein in plasma pull-downs. Gel bands present in samples eluted from the beads were analyzed by MS and contained sequences matching fibrinogen, or the TED-sIPD pull-down constructs. For FbaB, the albumin band contained no TED peptides."

We do not see evidence for such higher-order complexes in SDS-PAGE gels. Further, if only one TED can covalently bind to fibrinogen, but through different Lys residues, this would result in a mixed population of cross-linked species with the same molecular mass, but different acetylation and tryptic digest patterns.

It is however also produced by extrahepatic epithelial cells, and is present in the extracellular matrix (<a href=\"#bib39\">Pereira et al., 2002</a>), the provisional matrix in wound healing (<a href=\"#bib8\">Clark et al., 1982</a>) and in inflamed tissues (<a href=\"#bib30\">Lawrence and Simpson-Haidaris, 2004</a>). Fibrinogen expression is upregulated during inflammatory acute phase response in hepatocytes, but also in epithelial cells by the synergistic action of corticosteroids and interleukin-6 (<a href=\"#bib49\">Snyers et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Haidaris, 1997</a>). This inflammatory response can be induced in cell culture by incubation with dexamethasone and interleukin-6. Under these conditions human A549 lung epithelial cells express and secrete fibrinogen, which remains associated with cell surfaces (<a href=\"#bib16\">Guadiz et al., 1997</a>). We investigated if SfbI-TEDs interact with such induced A549 cells. SfbI-TED binding to unfixed, viable, adherent cells was visualized by conjugating TED-iPT constructs via IPD complementation to GFP fused to sIPD (<a href=\"#bib57\">Zakeri et al., 2012</a>) (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). SfbI-A40-TED bound to A549 cells only after they had been pre-incubated with dexamethasone and interleukin-6 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). SfbI-A40-TED:Cys109Ala binding to A549 cells was not detectable with or without induction. To obtain direct evidence for fibrinogen binding, Western blot analyses of cell homogenates using an anti-fibrinogen \u03b1 antibody were performed. These confirmed upregulation of fibrinogen expression following exposure of cells to dexamethasone/interleukin-6, in agreement with published data (<a href=\"#bib49\">Snyers et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Haidaris, 1997</a>). Critically, in homogenates from induced cells incubated with SfbI-A40-TED, a second band is detected of a molecular mass consistent with an SfbI-A40-TED:fibrinogen A\u03b1 adduct (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). The lack of this band in homogenates from induced cells incubated with SfbI-A40-TED:Cys109Ala confirms formation of this adduct is dependent on the thioester. These data show that SfbI-A40-TED adherence to A549 cells under conditions mimicking inflammation depends on thioester-mediated covalent binding to cell surface-associated fibrinogen."

Two well-studied examples for bacterial fibrinogen-binding proteins involved in invasive infections are clumping factor A of <i>S. aureus</i> (<a href=\"#bib15\">Ganesh et al., 2008</a>) and the M1 protein of <i>S. pyogenes</i> (<a href=\"#bib34\">Macheboeuf et al., 2011</a>). In this study we have not investigated the role of SfbI binding to fibrinogen during bacterial infection. However, <i>S. pyogenes</i> is known to target epithelial and endothelial cells for adhesion and invasion, and to cause invasive infections involving dissemination in the blood stream. Therefore our experiments using fibrin and epithelial cells represent meaningful biological models to probe the role of thioester-dependent covalent interaction in infections. Perhaps most significantly our data suggest that fibrinogen may have an unappreciated role as a host cell-surface associated adhesion target for bacteria. Potentially SfbI through its fibrinogen-binding activity may confer a tropism for inflamed tissue or the provisional matrix of healing wounds."

Our results show that a wide and diverse range of Gram-positive bacteria have evolved a mechanism for covalent bond formation with specific host factors via a pathogen-encoded reactive internal thioester. Thioester proteins could form a continuous covalent bridge between the bacterial cell envelope and host adhesion targets. This would provide rapid, mechanically very strong attachment that may be particularly advantageous under conditions of shear stress. Lack of similarity in the amino acid sequences of TEDs, together with the observation that only a small subset of those tested here bind fibrinogen, suggests there are undiscovered targets of these proteins. Thioester-dependent covalent adhesion may be a common molecular mechanism in host-microbe interactions, playing a key role in host colonization by both commensal and pathogenic Gram-positive bacteria. As such, TEDs are potentially attractive targets for the design of small molecules to inhibit infection, but they also present an opportunity to engineer beneficial interactions. TEDs hold promise as reactive protein fusion tags for use in tissue engineering, diagnostics or as tools for cell and molecular biology. While we think it is likely that many thioester-containing bacterial proteins will play a role in host-microbe interactions, it is also possible that they function in other processes such as bacteria\u2013bacteria interactions and biofilm formation."

They experimentally confirmed the internal thioester bond in 12 TEDs recombinantly produced in bacteria. They also determined the crystal structures of three TEDs (Sfbl-A40-TED, CpTIE-TED and PnTIE-TED), which are highly similar to the previously determined Cpa-TED2 structure despite the overall limited sequence similarity. This substantiates the definition of the large TED family. The second part of the story shows that SfbI-TEDs and FbaB-TED both from <i>S. pyogenes</i> can crosslink with host fibrinogen both in vitro and in the plasma, which is dependent upon the critical glutamine in the TEDs. Mass spec analyses show that Lysine-100 in fibrinogen A\u03b1 subunit reacts with the Cys-Gln thioester and forms an isopeptide bond with the glutamine side chain. Engineered <i>L. lactis</i> expressing SfbI-TED exhibit intimate adherence to fibrin and this requires the thioester Cys that activates the glutamine for being attacked by the lysine in fibrinogen. Lastly, the authors show a thioester-dependent binding of SfbI-TED to human A549 lung epithelial cells, which occurs when the cells have been stimulated with dexamethasone and IL-6 to mimic the inflammation."

The second part is significant; it is the first time to demonstrate that the thioester domain can form a covalent link with the host and to identify fibrinogen could be a host target of the TED. The only previously-known example of such a mechanism is in the human complement system. The current story represents a beautiful example of convergent evolution in which the same weapon has arisen in both bacterial pathogens and their animal hosts. Overall, the study is well designed and the data are convincing and of highly quality. The insights provided shall be interesting and significant to the field of bacteria-host interaction, and also of high value to understanding clinically important Gram-positive pathogens such as <i>S. pyogenes</i> and <i>Staphylococcus aureus.</i>"

In particular, the reviewers wonder if the authors have evidence that fibrinogen is the only protein in the extracellular and plasma membrane fractions that can be covalently pulled-down by SfbI-TEDs or FbaB-TED. As for the site specificity, the current mass spec data are not sufficient to demonstrate that Lysine-100 is a specific targeting site. Have the authors made further efforts to investigate the site specificity? In fact, if only Lysine-100, among numerous lysines in fibrinogen, can react with SfbI-TEDs or FbaB-TED, it will add significantly to the confidence that fibrinogen is a specific host target of the TEDs."

Does the stimulation increase the expression and secretion of fibrinogen or provide a more favorable chemical environment for isopeptide bond formation between fibrinogen and the TED?
