Here we establish the adult germline of <i>C. elegans</i> as model for facultative stem cell quiescence. We find that mitotically dividing germ cells-including germline stem cells-become quiescent in the absence of food. This quiescence is characterized by a slowing of S phase, a block to M-phase entry, and the ability to re-enter M phase rapidly in response to re-feeding. Further, we demonstrate that cell-cycle quiescence alters the genetic requirements for stem cell maintenance: The signaling pathway required for stem cell maintenance under fed conditions-GLP-1/Notch signaling-becomes dispensable under conditions of quiescence.    Thus, cell-cycle quiescence can itself maintain stem cells, independent of the signaling pathway otherwise essential for such maintenance."
