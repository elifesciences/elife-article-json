However, the window of responsiveness to Hippo signaling, the exact timing of lineage commitment and the overall relationship between cell commitment and global gene expression changes are still unclear. Single-cell RNA sequencing during lineage segregation revealed that the TE transcriptional profile stabilizes earlier than the ICM and prior to blastocyst formation. Using quantitative Cdx2-eGFP expression as a readout of Hippo signaling activity, we assessed the experimental potential of individual blastomeres based on their level of Cdx2-eGFP expression and correlated potential with gene expression dynamics. We find that TE specification and commitment coincide and occur at the time of transcriptional stabilization, whereas ICM cells still retain the ability to regenerate TE up to the early blastocyst stage. Plasticity of both lineages is coincident with their window of sensitivity to Hippo signaling."

However, the window of responsiveness to Hippo signaling, the exact timing of lineage commitment and the overall relationship between cell commitment and global gene expression changes are still unclear. Single-cell RNA sequencing during lineage segregation revealed that the TE transcriptional profile stabilizes earlier than the ICM and prior to blastocyst formation. Using quantitative Cdx2-eGFP expression as a readout of Hippo signaling activity, we assessed the experimental potential of individual blastomeres based on their level of Cdx2-eGFP expression and correlated potential with gene expression dynamics. We find that TE specification and commitment coincide and occur at the time of transcriptional stabilization, whereas ICM cells still retain the ability to regenerate TE up to the early blastocyst stage. Plasticity of both lineages is coincident with their window of sensitivity to Hippo signaling."

First, an egg is released from the ovary and travels along a tube called the oviduct, where sperm from a male may fertilize it. If the egg is fertilized, the newly formed embryo moves into the womb, where it will then implant into the walls. In mice, it takes around four days for the embryo to implant and during this time, the cells in the embryo divide several times and start to specialize to form distinct cell types called lineages."

The TE is an extraembryonic tissue, giving rise to the trophoblast lineages of the placenta. The ICM will form two additional lineages before implantation - the pluripotent epiblast (EPI), giving rise to all germ layers of the embryo, and the primitive endoderm (PE), largely forming the endoderm layers of the yolk sacs (<a href=\"#bib8\">Cockburn and Rossant, 2010</a>). At the blastocyst stage, the TE forms a monolayer tight junction-coupled epithelium enclosing the blastocoelic cavity, at one end of which lies the ICM. Inside and outside cell populations first form following the 8 to 16 cell divisions (<a href=\"#bib1\">Anani et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Dietrich and Hiiragi, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Watanabe et al., 2014</a>). During the 16 cell stage and during the 16 to 32 cell divisions, division-independent and dependent cell internalization leads to dynamic morphological rearrangements (<a href=\"#bib1\">Anani et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Ma\u00eetre et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Morris et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Samarage et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Watanabe et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Yamanaka et al., 2010</a>). From the 32 cell stage onwards, apart from the relatively rare event of division-independent cell internalization, inside and outside positioning is generally a good indicator of ICM and TE lineage fates, respectively (<a href=\"#bib30\">McDole et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">McDole and Zheng, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Pedersen et al., 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Watanabe et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Toyooka et al., 2016</a>)."

Inside cells are apolar, while outside cells can either be apolar or polar. Interestingly, outside apolar cells were identified as the cells that internalize during the 16 cell stage in a division-independent manner (<a href=\"#bib1\">Anani et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Ma\u00eetre et al., 2016</a>). Although there is some evidence that individual blastomeres show variation in gene expression and epigenetic marks prior to the 8 cell stage, and that these differences may bias their future fate (<a href=\"#bib2\">Biase et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Burton et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Goolam et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Plachta et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Torres-Padilla et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">White et al., 2016</a>), it is also clear that polarity differences are key to final assignment of cell fate. Polarity differences result in differential activation of the Hippo signaling pathway: active Hippo signaling in apolar cells sequesters the transcriptional co-activator Yap into the cytoplasm, while inactive Hippo in polar cells allows nuclear accumulation of Yap, and its interaction with the transcription factor Tead4 (<a href=\"#bib19\">Hirate et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Nishioka et al., 2009</a>). Nuclear Yap/Tead4 complexes are required for TE formation and are upstream regulators of Cdx2, a key TE-specific transcription factor (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kaneko and DePamphilis, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Nishioka et al., 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib36\">2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Rayon et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Yagi et al., 2007</a>). Activation of Cdx2 expression in TE progenitors leads to downregulation of the pluripotent factors, Oct4 and Nanog (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chen et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Niwa et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Strumpf et al., 2005</a>), while in ICM progenitors Hippo signaling leads to upregulation of Sox2, a co-factor with Oct4 in pluripotency (<a href=\"#bib61\">Wicklow et al., 2014</a>). Thus differential Hippo activity is a key driver of ICM-TE lineage segregation. However, the exact time when differential Hippo signaling is instructive to establish cell fate is not known."

                        "text": "Moreover, the timing of cell fate commitment to ICM or TE is also not fully understood. A number of early studies attempted to define this timing by isolating inside and outside cells at different stages of development and then assessing cell potential in chimeras or re-aggregated embryos. However, these experiments yielded conflicting results. For example, inner cells were reported to have lost TE-forming potential by the 32 cell stage (<a href=\"#bib55\">Tarkowski et al., 2010</a>), the early-mid blastocyst (~64 cell) stage (<a href=\"#bib17\">Handyside, 1978</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Rossant and Lis, 1979</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Stephenson et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Suwi\u0144ska et al., 2008</a>) or the late blastocyst stage (<a href=\"#bib14\">Grabarek et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Hogan and Tilly, 1978</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Spindle, 1978</a>). Outside cells were found to retain some plasticity up to the 32 cell stage (<a href=\"#bib48\">Rossant and Vijh, 1980</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Tarkowski et al., 2010</a>) but lost ICM potential when cavitation occurred during 32 cell stage (<a href=\"#bib53\">Suwi\u0144ska et al., 2008</a>). Using inside/outside position during cleavage as a marker for ICM and TE progenitors cannot be entirely accurate, given the dynamic rearrangements that take place, and so caution is needed in interpreting the conclusions of most of these experiments. This has led to considerable discrepancy between studies regarding the timing of restriction of developmental potential of the ICM."

As outlined (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), we harvested embryos at different stages from Cdx2-eGFP x CAG-DsRed (<a href=\"#bib58\">Vintersten et al., 2004</a>) crosses, dissociated them to single cells and measured Cdx2-eGFP in individual cells. These individual donor cells were then aggregated to a wild-type host morula and resulting chimeras were cultured to embryonic day 4.5 (E4.5). Chimeras were immunostained for DsRed to visualise the progeny of the aggregated single donor cell and for ICM (Klf4) and TE (Cdx2) lineage markers (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Donor cells isolated from 8 cell embryos did not express Cdx2-eGFP and contributed to ICM, TE or both lineages in chimeras (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Some donor cells from early 16 cell embryos started to express Cdx2-eGFP, and a small, yet significant bias was detected of Cdx2-eGFP high cells contributing to the TE and Cdx2-eGFP low cells contributing to ICM. This bias progressively increased with the developmental stage of the donor cell. We also noted that the ability of a single cell to give rise to both lineages sharply decreased at the 16 to 32 cell transition. Interestingly, Cdx2-eGFP low cells from the early 32 cell stage exclusively contributed to the ICM, while it took until the late-32 cell stage for Cdx2-eGFP high cells give rise to solely TE, thus revealing a different time\u00a0line of fate restriction of Cdx2-eGFP low and high cells."

At each developmental stage examined, the appropriate number of Cdx2-eGFP low or Cdx2-eGFP high cells, or a random mixture of cells was re-aggregated in groups. Such re-constructed embryos were cultured to E4.5 and analyzed for ICM (Sox2 and Gata4) and TE (Cdx2) lineage markers. We found that embryos reconstructed solely from cells with low or high Cdx2-eGFP levels isolated from late 16 cell embryos readily formed both ICM and TE lineages by E4.5 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>; <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Similarly all embryos made from Cdx2-eGFP low and most embryos from Cdx2-eGFP high early 32 cell stages still recapitulated both ICM and TE lineages (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>; <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), although we observed a non-significant decrease in the number of ICM cells formed in embryos from Cdx2-eGFP high cells compared to embryos made from Cdx2-eGFP low or random cells (Mann-Whitney test, <i>p</i>-value=ns). Embryos made from late 32 Cdx2-eGFP low cells still mostly reconstituted both ICM and TE lineages, while Cdx2-eGFP high cells by this stage completely lost their ability to form ICM and only produced Cdx2 positive TE (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>; <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). It was only by the 64 cell stage that the majority of Cdx2-eGFP low cells lost their ability to make TE (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>; <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Out of eight embryos made from Cdx2-eGFP low cells, only three showed re-expression of Cdx2 in a few cells (4, 6 and 3 cells per embryo), two without cavitating and one with a tiny cavity. A fourth embryo developed a small cavity but without any re-expression of Cdx2. All other embryos (n\u00a0=\u00a04/8) remained as tightly packed clusters without Cdx2 re-expression or cavitation."

Transgenic embryos were generated with a doxycycline (Dox)-inducible dominant-negative Lats2 (DN Lats2) tagged with mCherry (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>) and induced at different stages for 24 hr. Following treatment, embryos expressing high levels of mCherry were analyzed for ICM (Sox2 and Sox17) and TE (Cdx2) lineage markers (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D and E</a>). Our approach to generate transgenic embryos typically resulted in mosaic integration of inducible DN Lats2-mCherry, which allowed us to analyze both transgenic (mCherry positive) and non-transgenic (mCherry negative) ICM cells within the same embryo. Up to the early 32 cell stage, DN Lats2 expression in inner cells could induce fate change as indicated by gain of Cdx2 and loss of ICM markers in most mCherry positive inner cells. At the late 32 cell stage we observed some mCherry positive inner cells (14%) co-expressing Cdx2 and ICM markers, while majority (80%) of cells still fully converted to expressing only Cdx2. When DN Lats2 was induced at the 64 cell stage, however, most inner cells maintained ICM marker expression and did not re-express Cdx2. Only 1% of mCherry positive inner cells switched to expressing only Cdx2 and 4% expressed markers of both lineages. All inner cells in embryos induced at\u00a0&gt;64 cell stage showed commitment to ICM. Additionally, we noted that expression of only mCherry (without DN Lats2) did not influence cell fate at any stage (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

We show a gradual separation of ICM and TE lineages starting at the 16 cell stage, where the first transcriptional changes to distinguish cell populations are the activation of TE-specific genes, including <i>Cdx2. Cdx2</i> is the only known downstream target of nuclear Yap/Tead4 in the embryo (<a href=\"#bib46\">Rayon et al., 2014</a>). We now present evidence that a number of the additionally identified early TE genes, such as <i>Krt8</i>, <i>Krt18</i>, <i>Dab2</i> and <i>Lrp2</i> are likely targets of nuclear Yap/Tead4 as well. Whether these transcriptional differences at the 16 cell stage relate to earlier heterogeneities among blastomeres, as reported by other groups (<a href=\"#bib2\">Biase et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Burton et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Goolam et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Plachta et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Torres-Padilla et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">White et al., 2016</a>), is not clear, although we did not observe correlated differential expression of genes previously suggested to be involved in generating such heterogeneities (e.g. <i>Carm1</i>, <i>Prdm14</i> or <i>Sox21</i>) (<a href=\"#bib5\">Burton et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Goolam et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Torres-Padilla et al., 2007</a>). While we detected the initiation of lineage segregation in some cells at the 16 cell stage, others were still in a state of co-expression. The division to the early 32 cell stage marked a drastic transcriptional change, resolving the co-expressing state into ICM or TE profiles. Interestingly, we found that as the TE profile appeared, it also stabilized. On the other hand, the emerging ICM profile underwent considerable maturation until the 64 cell stage, at which point segregation into EPI and PE lineages is initiated (<a href=\"#bib16\">Guo et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Kurimoto et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Ohnishi et al., 2014</a>); and in this study [<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>])."

We experimentally tested the potential of single cells to contribute to developing lineages of the early embryo using a morula aggregation assay and found that cell behaviors observed in this test reflected the progress of lineage separation apparent from transcriptional profiling. We suggest that in this assay, a single cell finds itself in a competitive host environment and thus can act according to its intrinsic lineage identity: a specified TE progenitor will remain on the outside and contribute to the TE, while a specified ICM progenitor will move in and contribute to the ICM. Live imaging of chimera formation further supported such dynamic behaviors of ICM and TE progenitor cells. Thus we propose that despite the experimental manipulations involved, the morula aggregation assay reports cell fate specification. In contrast, when an entire embryo is reconstructed from only ICM or only TE progenitor cells, competition with the host cells is removed and some cells are inevitably forced inside and others outside. As such, this assay reveals the full potential of cells to change fate when forced into different positions. In this assay, ICM cells showed an extended period of lineage plasticity when compared with the results of the morula aggregation assay. We further showed that loss of responsiveness towards Hippo signaling manipulation coincided with the timing of fate restriction in ICM and TE progenitors, as read out by the reconstruction assay. Thus in the intact embryo and even in the morula aggregation assay, transcriptional profiles predict TE and ICM fates, while in the reconstruction assay and the Hippo manipulation experiments, the full potential of cells to respond to positional changes and associated signaling environments is revealed."

On the other hand, ICM progenitors showed fate restriction earlier in the morula aggregation test (by the early 32 cell stage) than they did in the embryo reconstruction and Hippo-inactivation assays (by the 64 cell stage), revealing a time window between lineage specification and commitment. Correspondingly, gene expression dynamics in the ICM lineage also reflected this prolonged maturation."

During the 16 to 32 cell divisions a number of outside cells are internalized as a result of the cleavage plane orientation (<a href=\"#bib33\">Morris et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Yamanaka et al., 2010</a>). However, a recent study revealed that daughter cells pushed inwards during mitosis often sort back to the surface (<a href=\"#bib59\">Watanabe et al., 2014</a>). We propose that the timely commitment of majority of TE cells that we observe between the late 16 and early 32 cell stages may be the driving force of this sorting process, allowing generation of a differentiated polarized epithelial layer that would stabilize the inside compartment. Cell divisions do not cause spatial perturbation in the ICM, thus functional commitment to this lineage may not be needed at this stage. Instead, we find that the ICM loses the ability to become TE when the first heterogeneities in gene expression demarcating the start of the second lineage segregation arise. This is in line with an earlier study, which showed that outer cells of isolated ICMs of early blastocysts mostly formed trophoblast outgrowths, while isolated ICMs from later stage blastocysts mostly formed PE-like outgrowths (<a href=\"#bib34\">Nichols and Gardner, 1984</a>). We suggest a possible functional relationship between loss of ICM plasticity and initiation of EPI and PE differentiation programs, which requires further investigation. In conclusion, we propose that asynchronous lineage commitment may be a mechanism contributing to the regulative nature of the preimplantation embryo, ensuring that the correct number of cells is allocated to inside and outside compartments."

Briefly, gene-variability statistic was calculated that adjusted for the mean-variance relationship present in single-cell RNA-sequencing data. This was done by assuming that the expression distribution of a gene follow a negative binomial for which the variance depends on the mean, v = m\u00a0+\u00a0m<sup>2</sup>/r, where r is the overdispersion, implying that cv<sup>2</sup> = v/m<sup>2</sup>\u00a0=\u00a01/m\u00a0+\u00a01/r. To estimate the technical variability we fitted such a model to our ERCC spike-in read counts and a gene-variability statistic was then obtained by adjusting for the technical variability present when conditioning on the mean expression level (<a href=\"#bib3\">Brennecke et al., 2013</a>). To determine the number of variable genes used, we tested 100, 250, 500 and 1000 of the most variable genes, and visually assessed clusters obtained using principal component analysis (PCA). Similar profiles were obtained regardless of input. Temporal separation of cells was obtained by applying dimensionality reduction technique, PCA. Similar profiles were obtained using t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding (t-SNE), another dimensional reduction algorithm (data not shown) (<a href=\"#bib18\">Hinton and van der Maaten, 2008</a>)."

Principal components of interest were identified by both observing a separation of developmental time and Cdx2-eGFP profile of the cells. Single-cell differential expression analysis (SCDE) (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kharchenko et al., 2014</a>) was then performed between the \u2018ICM\u2019 (corresponding to the low Cdx2-eGFP group) and \u2018TE\u2019 (corresponding to the high Cdx2-eGFP) of the early 32 cells to determine lineage signatures for the ICM and TE. The top 50 genes obtained for both the ICM and TE were then used as input to determine the segregation of cells at the late and early\u00a016 cell stage, by using Spearman\u2019s rank correlations. Following lineage classification, SCDE was then performed for all groups (developmental stage and lineage (ICM, TE and \u2018co-expressed\u2019)) for each time point. The SCDE algorithm requires non-normalized integer values, as such, the raw read counts were provided as input. Genes with zero reads across the samples being compared were discarded. Two-sided <i>p</i>-values were calculated from the Benjamini-Hochberg multiple testing corrected Z-score (cZ) using the normal distribution as null hypothesis, and a significance level of 0.05 was used to deem genes as significantly differentially expressed."

Randomization was achieved by pooling all staged embryos in one experiment, with the exception of RNA\u00a0sequencing experiments. For RNA\u00a0sequencing experiments embryo information was preserved, however no embryo batch effect was noted when single cell expression profiles were analyzed. The investigator was not blinded to group allocation during experiments and outcome assessment, with the exception of RNA\u00a0sequencing experiments. Cdx2-eGFP measurements of single cells and RNA\u00a0sequencing of the same cells were performed by different investigators and outcomes were thus blindly determined."

The performed experiments are of high quality and the results produced are novel and very important to the field. The provided comprehensive single-cell global transcriptional dataset, which covers the entire lineage segregation period with high temporal resolution, is a valuable resource. The importance of the paper resides not only in revealing the changes in global gene expression profiles during segregation of the cell fates, but also in experimentally linking these to the broader concepts of developmental biology, cell fate specification and commitment, and responsiveness to Hippo signaling, a key cell fate control signal. Although there has been a lot of work over the years to address these questions, this manuscript is the first to combine so many approaches to generate confirmatory data. The previous literature has generally been well incorporated and on the whole suitably attributed. Performing these assays in parallel resolved inconsistencies found in previously published literature. In conclusion, this is an excellent paper providing valuable information to the field. There is a request for inclusion of some additional experiments the reviewers would like to see addressed."

Generation of inducible DN Lats2 transgenic embryos required the simultaneous integration of two PiggyBAC constructs. This proved to be an inefficient approach when we generated transgenic embryos by microinjecting the pronucleus of zygotes \u2013 hence the limited number of embryos analyzed previously. We now discovered that generating transgenic embryos by microinjecting into the cytoplasm at the 2-cell stage was markedly more efficient, allowing us to increase numbers of transgenic embryos."
