One of these parts \u2013 called the G\u03b2\u03b3 subunit \u2013 can directly bind to, and open, a protein called a GIRK channel that is found in the cell\u2019s membrane.

The flow of potassium into the heart muscle cells then helps to slow the heart rate.Heart cells produce two subtypes of GIRK channels, called GIRK4 and GIRK1/4.

When there are more sodium ions in the cell, the G\u03b2\u03b3 subunits bind more strongly to the GIRK4 channel; this means that the channel is more sensitive to the nerve impulses from the brain. In a related study, Wang et al. \u2013 who include all of the same researchers \u2013 also discovered that sodium ions affect GIRK2 channels from neurons in a similar way. By contrast, Touhara et al. found that the GIRK1/4 channel is unaffected by the sodium level inside the cell and is instead always sensitive to stimulation by nerve impulses that signal being at rest."

Specifically, when the body is at rest, parasympathetic neurons convey signals from the central nervous system to cardiac pacemaker cells <i>via</i> cholinergic neurotransmission, activating the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor 2 (M2R). Activated M2Rs release inhibitory G protein alpha subunits and G\u03b2\u03b3. G\u03b2\u03b3 is a hetero-dimeric protein composed of tightly bound beta and gamma subunits. This free G\u03b2\u03b3, along with its lipid anchor, diffuses on the intracellular membrane surface and binds directly to GIRK to activate it (<a href=\"#bib16\">Logothetis et al., 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Whorton and MacKinnon, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Sakmann et al., 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Kurachi et al., 1986</a>).

However, it is still unclear what influence this defective Na<sup>+</sup> binding site has on the function of GIRK1/4 hetero-tetramers. Cellular electrophysiological experiments have not clarified this issue because it is difficult to control the concentration of GIRK ligands inside cells and it is also not possible to express GIRK1/4 hetero-tetramers without co-expression of GIRK4 homo-tetramers. To overcome these difficulties we have purified human GIRK1/4 hetero-tetramers and GIRK4 homo-tetramers and studied their ligand regulation by Na<sup>+</sup> and G\u03b2\u03b3 in the planar lipid bilayer system."

To remove both homo-tetramers two different tags, a deca-histidine tag and a 1D4 peptide tag, were fused to the GIRK1 and GIRK4 subunits, respectively. Two sequential affinity chromatography steps isolated only GIRK1/4 hetero-tetramer channels containing both tags (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Equal bands in all lanes of an SDS-PAGE gel, corresponding to different elution fractions from a gel-filtration column, suggested that the predominant channel species purified contained two GIRK1 and two GIRK4 subunits (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). This suggestion is based on the different elution times of homo-tetramer GIRK1 and GIRK4 subunits (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>).

In this method, bilayer membranes containing specific mole fractions of Ni-NTA-lipids were formed. GIRK channel proteoliposomes, which also contained the same mole fraction of Ni-NTA-lipids as the bilayer membrane, were then fused to the membrane. C8-PIP<sub>2</sub> and 2 \u00b5M soluble G\u03b2\u03b3 (sG\u03b2\u03b3-His<sub>10</sub>), which contained a deca-histidine-tag instead of its physiological lipid anchor, were applied to the intracellular side of the membrane. At 2 \u00b5M concentration sG\u03b2\u03b3-His<sub>10</sub> does not activate GIRK channels directly from solution, however, it saturates (i.e. occupies nearly 100% of) all available Ni-NTA-lipids in the membrane (<a href=\"#bib23\">Wang et al., 2016</a>). These membrane-bound sG\u03b2\u03b3-His<sub>10</sub> molecules are able to activate GIRK channels, which are present in the membrane at a much lower density than Ni-NTA-lipid molecules (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). This method permits the study of GIRK channel activation as a function of the membrane sG\u03b2\u03b3-His<sub>10</sub> density (G\u03b2\u03b3\u00a0concentration), which is controlled through the predetermined mole fraction of Ni-NTA-lipid molecules in the membrane (<a href=\"#bib23\">Wang et al., 2016</a>). In subsequent graphs, G\u03b2\u03b3\u00a0concentration is quantified as Ni-NTA-lipid mole fraction, but for accounting purposes the stoichiometry of sG\u03b2\u03b3-His<sub>10</sub> to Ni-NTA-lipid is 1:3 (i.e. a single sG\u03b2\u03b3-His<sub>10</sub> molecule binds to 3 Ni-NTA-lipid molecules), meaning the actual sG\u03b2\u03b3-His<sub>10</sub> density on the membrane is one third the density of Ni-NTA-lipid (<a href=\"#bib23\">Wang et al., 2016</a>). In order to compare currents from different membranes that generally contain different numbers of GIRK channels, at the end of each experiment proteolipsomes containing lipid-anchored G\u03b2\u03b3 were fused to the membrane to maximally activate the GIRK channels in the membrane (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Current activated at a specific G\u03b2\u03b3\u00a0concentration (determined by the density of Ni-NTA-lipids) is referred to as normalized current."

GIRK4 current increases as a sigmoid-shaped function, and Na<sup>+</sup> concentration has a prominent effect on G\u03b2\u03b3\u00a0activation. Specifically, Na<sup>+</sup> increases GIRK4 current at all G\u03b2\u03b3 concentrations, but notably, the increase is relatively largest at low G\u03b2\u03b3\u00a0concentrations where, for example, at 0.001 Ni-NTA mole fraction 32\u2009mM Na<sup>+</sup> increases normalized current almost 20-fold, from 0.018 to 0.34. These data suggest that GIRK4 is similar to the neuronal GIRK channel, GIRK2, in its response to G\u03b2\u03b3 and Na<sup>+</sup> (<a href=\"#bib23\">Wang et al., 2016</a>). We therefore applied the same equilibrium gating model used to analyze GIRK2 (<a href=\"#bib23\">Wang et al., 2016</a>). The model has 25 states of ligand occupancy, corresponding to 0 to 4 of each ligand, G\u03b2\u03b3 and Na<sup>+</sup>, as illustrated (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Parameters in the model include an equilibrium dissociation constant <i>K<sub>db</sub></i> and cooperativity factor <i>b</i> for G\u03b2\u03b3 binding, an equilibrium dissociation constant <i>K<sub>dn</sub></i> for Na<sup>+</sup> binding (the cooperativity factor for Na<sup>+</sup> binding is 1), a factor <i>\u03b7</i>\u00a0for the effect that G\u03b2\u03b3 and Na<sup>+</sup> have on each other\u2019s affinity, and a term <i>\u03b8</i> relating conductivity to ligand occupancy (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). The model adequately represents the data with values for the parameters given (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). The errors on values for equilibrium dissociation constants and cooperativity factors are larger than those determined for GIRK2 (<a href=\"#bib23\">Wang et al., 2016</a>) because the data set on GIRK4 is smaller. However, the overall conclusion is that GIRK4 is very similar to GIRK2. Through model analysis the data support three conclusions: that 4 G\u03b2\u03b3 molecules are required to open the channel (the model yields higher residuals with less than 4), that G\u03b2\u03b3 binds cooperatively to GIRK4,\u00a0and that Na<sup>+</sup> exerts its major effect by increasing the G\u03b2\u03b3 affinity for the channel."

At all Na<sup>+</sup> concentrations \u2013 even in the absence of Na<sup>+</sup> \u2013 the response of the GIRK1/4 channel to G\u03b2\u03b3 is similar to the GIRK4 channel at higher Na<sup>+</sup> concentrations. Thus, the GIRK1/4 hetero-tetramer channel, compared to the GIRK4 homo-tetramer channel, behaves to a first approximation as if it remains permanently stuck in a Na<sup>+</sup>-activated state. That this influence of the GIRK1 subunit is related to its Na<sup>+</sup> binding site is supported by the mutation N217D, which converts the GIRK1 Na<sup>+</sup> binding locus to be more like that of GIRK4 by restoring its Na<sup>+</sup> sensitivity to the hetero-tetramer (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>) (<a href=\"#bib9\">Ho and Murrell-Lagnado, 1999</a>). To test the idea that Asn217 in GIRK1 mimics a Na<sup>+</sup>-bound Asp we fit the GIRK1/4 data to the same model used for the GIRK4 channel, but imposed the condition that two of the four sites are \u201cpermanently occupied\u201d by Na<sup>+</sup>, with the underlying idea that the two permanently occupied sites represent the GIRK1 subunits. This condition means GIRK1/4 is described by 15 states of ligand occupancy corresponding to 0 to 4 G\u03b2\u03b3 and 0 to 2 Na<sup>+</sup>. The model encodes this by collapsing the 0, 1 and 2 Na<sup>+</sup>-occupied states of the GIRK4 model into a single state with affinity of G\u03b2\u03b3 equal to <i>K<sub>db</sub></i>\ufeff<i>\u03b7</i><sup>2</sup> (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). This model describes the data for the GIRK1/4 channel accurately with numerical values for <i>K<sub>db</sub>, K<sub>dn</sub>, b</i> and <i>\u03b7</i> that are indistinguishable from those for the GIRK4 model (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Thus, the properties of the GIRK1/4 channel are consistent quantitatively with the GIRK1 subunits functioning as if they are GIRK4 subunits with Na<sup>+</sup> ions permanently bound to them."

Homo-tetramers of GIRK4 and hetero-tetramers of GIRK1 and GIRK4, GIRK1/4, form functional K<sup>+</sup> channels, while homo-tetramers of GIRK1 do not (<a href=\"#bib12\">Krapavinsky et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Hedin et al., 1996</a>). It is unclear to what extent GIRK4 homo-tetramers versus GIRK1/4 hetero-tetramers dominate in cardiac cells. It is also unclear to what extent the functional properties of these channels differ because it has not been possible to study GIRK1/4 channels in isolation, the reason being heterologous expression of both subunits naturally gives rise to a mixed population of homo- and hetero-tetramers. To overcome this problem we overexpressed and purified GIRK1/4 hetero-tetramers using sequential affinity columns and also expressed and purified GIRK4 homo-tetramers for comparative analysis. The composition of GIRK1/4 hetero-tetramers is reported to consist mainly of two GIRK1 and two GIRK4 subunits (<a href=\"#bib20\">Silverman et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Corey et al., 1998</a>). In this study purified GIRK1/4 hetero-tetramers are also most likely composed of two GIRK1 subunits and two GIRK4 subunits, as estimated from SDS-PAGE of fractions from a gel filtration column (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>).

It had been shown that the GIRK1 subunit has a defective Na<sup>+</sup> site (<a href=\"#bib9\">Ho and Murrell-Lagnado, 1999</a>), but the present study establishes the following new conclusions. First, that Na<sup>+</sup> binding to the GIRK4 subunit increases affinity for G\u03b2\u03b3 This effect is encoded in the model by the G\u03b2\u03b3-Na<sup>+</sup> cross interaction term\u00a0<i>\u03b7</i>. Second, the GIRK1 subunit behaves similarly to the GIRK4 subunit with Na<sup>+</sup> permanently bound. Thus, while the GIRK1 subunit is unable to bind Na<sup>+</sup>, it causes the channel to have high affinity for G\u03b2\u03b3 even in the absence of Na<sup>+</sup>. This effect is encoded in the model by enforcing permanent Na<sup>+</sup> occupancy on the GIRK1 subunits. Taken together, these properties account for the functional differences we observe between GIRK4 and GIRK1/4 channels. GIRK4 channels are less sensitive to G protein stimulation at low Na<sup>+</sup> concentrations (G\u03b2\u03b3 binds with lower affinity) and more sensitive at high Na<sup>+</sup> concentrations (G\u03b2\u03b3 binds with higher affinity). GIRK1/4 channels on the other hand are very sensitive to G\u03b2\u03b3 stimulation at both low and high Na<sup>+</sup> concentrations (G\u03b2\u03b3 binds with high affinity independent of Na<sup>+</sup> concentration)."

We can only speculate as to why two kinds of GIRK channels exist, ones whose G protein sensitivity is regulated by intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> (i.e. homo-tetramer GIRK4 or GIRK2 channels) and ones whose G protein sensitivity is not much regulated by Na<sup>+</sup> but is always near maximum (i.e. hetero-tetramer GIRK1/4 channels). In neurons, intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> concentration increases during excitation because Na<sup>+</sup> enters the cell through Na<sup>+</sup> channels during action potentials and through glutamate receptor ion channels in response to excitatory neurotransmitters (<a href=\"#bib14\">Lasser-Ross and Ross, 1992</a>). GIRK2 channels silence neurons in response to inhibitory neurotransmitters, which act through inhibitory GPCRs. The GIRK2 regulation by Na<sup>+</sup> provides a way to modulate the inhibitory response according to the activity level. Such modulation would seem beneficial to a neuron that exhibits a wide range of electrical activity from near silent to high frequency spiking. Cardiac cells on the other hand appear to exhibit less activity-dependent variation in levels of intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> (<a href=\"#bib7\">Harrison et al., 1992</a>). Thus, it seems reasonable that GIRK1/4 channels do not exhibit high Na<sup>+</sup> sensitivity, but instead exhibit a permanent state of cholinergic responsiveness (<a href=\"#bib10\">Ito et al., 1994</a>)."

For the Na<sup>+</sup> and G\u03b2\u03b3 titration experiments, 0\u20130.015 (mole fraction) of DGS-NTA was added to a lipid solution in decane composed of 1:1\u00a0(wt:wt) of DOPE and POPC, and the lipid mixture was painted over a transparency film.

Their combination into tetramers is not random \u2013 a long term question in the field is the different regulatory or functional consequences of heteromerization. Touhara et al. show that intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> regulates homotetrameric GIRK4 channels sensitivity to G\u03b2\u03b3. In contrast, GIRK1 lacks an optimal Na binding site and GIRK1/4 channel G\u03b2\u03b3 sensitivity is near its maximum. In other words, GIRK1 subunits may be evolved to reduce Na sensitivity in some tissues, such as heart (GIRK1 + GIRK4), while Na sensitive subunits (GIRK4 homomers) are adapted to regulate neuronal firing as sodium accumulates during bursts of action potentials. The authors take an innovative and solid approach to answering this question and do so beautifully in a reconstituted system where stoichiometry and composition of subunits can be controlled. They do this through use of distinct tags for GIRK1 and GIRK4 subunits that enable their purification, and then controlling the G\u03b2\u03b3 incorporation into the membrane by tagging G\u03b2\u03b3 with His<sub>10</sub> and Ni-NTA tagged lipids. This enables them to quantify the relation between NTA mole fraction of membrane bound G\u03b2\u03b3 and GIRK4 vs GIRK1/4 current. They then summarize this in a multi- state model that incorporates G\u03b2\u03b3 and Na. The main finding is that Na binding to the GIRK4 subunit increases the affinity for G\u03b2\u03b3, while G\u03b2\u03b3 does not require Na binding for its high affinity for G\u03b2\u03b3. The data are outstanding and the interpretation convincing. This manuscript harvests the gold mined in its methodological partner-paper that sets the stage for a quantitative understanding of G\u03b2\u03b3-activated, Na<sup>+</sup>-modulated GRIK channel behavior, by systematically varying G\u03b2\u03b3 'concentration' (i.e., membrane surface density). The manuscript is thorough, in not only purifying and quantifying reconstituted GIRK heterotets, or in comparing G\u03b2\u03b3 activation of GRK4 homotetramers with GRK1/GRIK4 channels and the striking difference of Na<sup>+</sup> modulation accomplishments that in themselves would be an exciting breakthrough, but in also linking this new information to GIRK behavior in cardiac and neuronal contexts."

It may not be the case when comparing across cell types with different expression of ion channels and transporters. Consider the cardiac SA node: It is not at all obvious that cytoplasmic Na will accumulate with increased frequency in S/A node cells. The upstroke is made by Ca influx, and Na influx is occurring primarily during the diastolic period through CNG channels (probably). Thus, it is more likely that cytoplasmic Na will decrease with increase of frequency, given this situation, thereby creating a very different regulatory situation than in neurons using Nav channels to make APs. Admittedly, this conclusion may be altered if Na/Ca exchangers generate the majority of Na influx in SA node cells, but most recent work does not support this possibility. We believe that these considerations can be used by the authors to improve the clarity and future relevance of their discussion."
