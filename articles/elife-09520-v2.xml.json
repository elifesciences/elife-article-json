In the last phases of malaria elimination, as universal interventions reap diminishing marginal returns, national resources must become increasingly devoted to identifying where residual transmission is occurring. The needs for accurate measures of progress and practical advice about how to allocate scarce resources require new analytical methods to quantify fine-grained heterogeneity in malaria risk. Using routine national surveillance data from Swaziland (a sub-Saharan country on the verge of elimination), we estimated individual reproductive numbers. Fine-grained maps of reproductive numbers and local malaria importation rates were combined to show \u2018malariogenic potential\u2019, a first for malaria elimination. As countries approach elimination, these individual-based measures of transmission risk provide meaningful metrics for planning programmatic responses and prioritizing areas where interventions will contribute most to malaria elimination."

In the last phases of malaria elimination, as universal interventions reap diminishing marginal returns, national resources must become increasingly devoted to identifying where residual transmission is occurring. The needs for accurate measures of progress and practical advice about how to allocate scarce resources require new analytical methods to quantify fine-grained heterogeneity in malaria risk. Using routine national surveillance data from Swaziland (a sub-Saharan country on the verge of elimination), we estimated individual reproductive numbers. Fine-grained maps of reproductive numbers and local malaria importation rates were combined to show \u2018malariogenic potential\u2019, a first for malaria elimination. As countries approach elimination, these individual-based measures of transmission risk provide meaningful metrics for planning programmatic responses and prioritizing areas where interventions will contribute most to malaria elimination."

The ensuing Global Malaria Eradication Campaign (GMEP, 1955\u20131969), directed by the World Health Organization, contributed to a massive, permanent contraction in the geographic range of malaria (<a href=\"#bib16\">Gramiccia et al., 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Smith, 2013</a>), and it led to development of concepts and methods for eliminating malaria that remain useful today. A key insight was the need to use different metrics, suited to natural constraints and programmatic needs, to mark progression from endemic malaria to elimination (<a href=\"#bib19\">Hay et al., 2008</a>). Malaria eradication is once again recognized as a global priority, and as of 2011, 36 of 99 malaria endemic countries had plans to eliminate malaria (<a href=\"#bib13\">Cotter, 2011</a>)."

Given that GMEP was predicated on the idea of universal insecticide spraying throughout at-risk areas, these notions were used primarily to evaluate the vigilance required to prevent reestablishment of transmission post-elimination rather than to make decisions about intervention selection or targeting (<a href=\"#bib35\">World Health Organization, 2012</a>). They thus require updating in light of the different assumptions of the present campaigns. Malaria importation rates for African malaria elimination countries are much higher than those for countries that eliminated malaria in past decades due to high mobility and\u00a0highly endemic neighbors (<a href=\"#bib31\">Tatem, 2010</a>), and receptivity may be greater. Countries have multiple tools at their disposal but must determine how to deploy them optimally to achieve and sustain elimination given constrained resources. These challenges are now being faced by Swaziland, a sub-Saharan country that has made substantial progress towards eliminating malaria. Success would make it the first mainland sub-Saharan country to eliminate malaria, and so the lessons from its national experience will be relevant for the rest of the continent."

Successful elimination of malaria during the GMEP similarly demonstrated that, in resource-constrained environments, a shift is required away from a focus on universal coverage for endemic malaria towards heightened surveillance, case investigation, identification of areas where transmission risk remains high (i.e., residual transmission foci), and highly targeted interventions (<a href=\"#bib23\">Moonen, 2010</a>).

At a national level, the decreasing ratio of local to imported malaria cases since 2010 is suggestive of an reproductive number under control, <i>R<sub>c</sub></i>, much less than 1 on average, which would mean that elimination of endemic transmission may have already been achieved or is imminent (<a href=\"#bib8\">Churcher et al., 2014</a>)."

Ideally, programs would focus attention on places and at times where and when the risk of malaria transmission is highest. Programs might direct aggressive interventions, such as focal mass drug administration, towards residual endemic foci where transmission would persist even in the absence of importation, but might opt for less aggressive maintenance of reduced risk in places where transmission is driven only by continual replenishment from imported infections. Determining whether locally acquired malaria infections are the result of endemic transmission or result from transmission chains stemming from importation requires analyzing transmission at an individual level. National risk maps have been developed based on the household locations of local malaria cases (<a href=\"#bib12\">Cohen, 2013</a>) but these maps do not describe how much transmission is likely occurring, only whether or not there is risk of any local infections in a given location as narrowly defined by the location of infected individuals.

Areas outside the major cities\u2014specifically those in the east and north of Swaziland\u2014appear to have a higher ratio of local to imported cases, suggesting that though on average each malaria case generates less than one other case (i.e. <i>R<sub>c</sub></i> &lt; 1), there are some focal areas where endemic transmission may continue to smolder. Measuring progress and achieving elimination requires properly characterizing and quantifying heterogeneity in this residual transmission. Here, to address these needs, we have defined <i>vulnerability, receptivity</i>, and <i>malariogenic potential</i> in quantitative terms based on a continuous point-process and developed fine-grained maps."

Methods for doing so are largely based on case investigations, but such methods could be validated and augmented with genetic and computational methods for linking cases. Understanding which cases are linked to other cases is also important because it allows direct measurement of <i>R<sub>C</sub></i>, an important measure of the need for additional intervention. We developed computational methods for assessing malaria transmission (see Methods) that quantifies the most likely \u201cparent\u201d of each local case. We do not distinguish between potential parents in terms of their status as \u201cimported\u201d or \u201clocal\u201d. In this, we are estimating causal links that can be counted in space-time to get measurements of receptivity. Further, these links build transmission chains that can be used to gain a deeper understanding of the spatial variation in <i>R<sub>c</sub></i>. This approach uses an understanding of malaria transmission dynamics to redefine \u201cproximity\u201d of two malaria cases as a generalized probabilistic measure based on distance and time separating two cases to evaluate potential causality. Malaria transmission directly links two individuals through two bites from the same mosquito. The time elapsed between detection of two linked cases will be bound by the serial interval (<a href=\"#bib14\">Fine, 2003</a>) (i.e., the length of a complete malaria transmission cycle), mosquito mortality, and the timing of case detection relative to infection. These aspects of malaria ecology provide probabilistic bookends to temporal proximity, as even with detection (and assuming all detected cases are treated promptly), cases are ever more unlikely to be linked as the chance of a mosquito living long enough to link them diminishes. In space, the simple but common Gaussian diffusion-based approximation of movement approximates the combined spread of mosquitoes and humans, and is governed by a single constant. Given the use of continuous distribution functions, the algorithm was forced to always find a link even if it was inconceivable. As such, we incorporated a minimum threshold that dichotomized links into \u201cplausible\u201d (with a level of plausibility) and \u201cimplausible.\u201d"

By combining \u201cmost likely\u201d links, we arrived at a single weighted network that represents the consensus linkages (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). As was suspected by visual inspection of the spatial distribution of the data, most of the imported cases within the major cities of Swaziland did not appear to be responsible for ongoing transmission. However, both imported and locally transmitted cases in the north and east did, infrequently, initiate extended transmission chains.

The resulting map of <i>R<sub>c\u00a0</sub></i>illustrates the estimated heterogeneous distribution of current malaria receptivity within Swaziland. To the west, <i>R<sub>c\u00a0</sub></i>is close to 0. Within Mbabane and Manzini, <i>R<sub>c\u00a0</sub></i>is estimated at 0.08 and 0.12 respectively. Conversely, in the northeast near the Mozambican border, <i>R<sub>c</sub></i> estimates increase up to 1.70. As suspected, while endemic transmission does not appear to occur within the urban centers of Swaziland, it does not yet appear eliminated from the entirety of the country. The smoothed <i>R<sub>c\u00a0</sub></i>map was found to be statistically significantly different from a flat map (p-value &lt;2e-16) but it remained unclear the statistical significance of each pixel. Further analysis is required to assess the robustness of isolated locations where <i>R<sub>c</sub></i> appears elevated. This will be an important step to appropriately interpret these maps for the purpose of resource allocation given constraints on the number of individual locations that can be visited."

As Swaziland successfully extirpates these final foci of endemic transmission, local transmission in the country will increasingly arise only around imported malaria cases. The total number of locally acquired malaria cases in Swaziland is the product of importation (vulnerability) and onward transmission (receptivity), with the ongoing operational challenge of maintaining gains greatest in regions with both higher receptivity (i.e. <i>R<sub>C</sub></i>) and higher vulnerability (i.e., the number of malaria infections imported each year that could seed new transmission): the product of these quantities has been defined as the \u2018malariogenic potential\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib25\">Pampana, 1969</a>).

In this analysis, missed cases could matter if they biased the estimates of <i>R<sub>c</sub></i>, depending on whether locally transmitted or imported cases were more likely to be missed. If a case that is missed results in local transmission and if those future cases are captured by surveillance, those future cases may appear to have no plausible cause. The identification of such \u201corphan\u201d cases can help indicate places where Swaziland must work to implement or strengthen active infection detection. Within this analysis, due to the inclusion of temporal uncertainty to account for potential differences between detection times and time of onset, rare links can be formed between a case and a second case where the second case was picked up at the same time or even later. These rare links would only form if no other case that occurred earlier were close in space-time as judged by the spatio-temporal kernels. In these circumstances, due to the flexibility of the spatio-temporal kernel, a pair of cases could be identified as being the most likely parent of each other.

In the end phases of elimination, population-level measures become inefficient and inadequate, so as countries approach the goal of eliminating malaria, individual-based estimates of transmission must identify putative foci where transmission remains high and where resources should be targeted (<a href=\"#bib19\">Hay et al., 2008</a>). Case counts alone do not necessarily convey information about transmission, since many of those cases may have been acquired far from where they were detected. Aggregate ratios of local to imported cases in time (or in space) alone, while more representative of overall progress, could obscure localized transmission if, for example, most cases failed to transmit but some pockets of transmission remained. This analysis, which identifies places and times where cases are most likely to be transmitted, confirms that there has been dramatic progress towards elimination overall, but it also identified substantial heterogeneity in progress within Swaziland."

Combining assessments of receptivity with assessments of vulnerability provide actionable intelligence to support malaria programs in designing targeted intervention strategies in the most relevant places; for example, the NMCP may consider targeting travelers with prophylaxis in places with high vulnerability, while focal mass drug administration or other aggressive measures might be most appropriate in places with evidence of endemic transmission and low vulnerability. Our approach provides spatiotemporally relevant and resolved metrics of transmission that can be used to identify future cases as either critical or relatively unimportant for overall elimination efforts. Further, and perhaps most important, our approach can be used to stratify future control responses by differentiating between locations where elimination would be a consequence of merely decreasing effective importation versus where elimination of endemic transmission is needed through reduction in local receptivity. Predictions generated by our approach will also be useful as a baseline for in-development genetic testing and molecular typing models (<a href=\"#bib17\">Greenhouse and Smith, 2015</a>), and will remain pertinent as a proxy for such methods in places where resources are limited to enable universal parasite typing. These methods can help Swaziland reassess its needs and remain malaria-free as surrounding countries control transmission and make further progress. Through regional elimination, economic growth, and efficient use of existing resources, malaria elimination can perhaps become as stable in Swaziland as it has been elsewhere (<a href=\"#bib29\">Smith, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Chiyaka et al., 2013</a>)."

Infected individuals reporting no travel, whether abroad or within Swaziland were categorized as locally acquired cases.

The particular parameters chosen (and their particular coefficients) are only a step of our algorithm, which would be rerun at any time-point in the future given new data and which would likely result in a different \u201cbest\u201d model linking spatial covariates to the output of the first part of our algorithm."
