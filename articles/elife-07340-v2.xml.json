Yet, virtually no work has considered how such parental effects might change the adaptive value of behavioural traits expressed by offspring upon reaching adulthood. To address this problem, we combined experiments on burying beetles (<i>Nicrophorus vespilloides</i>) with theoretical modelling and focussed on one adult behavioural trait in particular: the supply of parental care. We manipulated the early-life environment and measured the fitness payoffs associated with the supply of parental care when larvae reached maturity. We found that (1) adults that received low levels of care as larvae were less successful at raising larger broods and suffered greater mortality as a result: they were low-quality parents. Furthermore, (2) high-quality males that raised offspring with low-quality females subsequently suffered greater mortality than brothers of equivalent quality, which reared larvae with higher quality females. Our analyses identify three general ways in which parental effects can change the adaptive value of an adult behavioural trait: by influencing the associated fitness benefits and costs; by consequently changing the evolutionary outcome of social interactions; and by modifying the evolutionarily stable expression of behavioural traits that are themselves parental effects."

Yet, virtually no work has considered how such parental effects might change the adaptive value of behavioural traits expressed by offspring upon reaching adulthood. To address this problem, we combined experiments on burying beetles (<i>Nicrophorus vespilloides</i>) with theoretical modelling and focussed on one adult behavioural trait in particular: the supply of parental care. We manipulated the early-life environment and measured the fitness payoffs associated with the supply of parental care when larvae reached maturity. We found that (1) adults that received low levels of care as larvae were less successful at raising larger broods and suffered greater mortality as a result: they were low-quality parents. Furthermore, (2) high-quality males that raised offspring with low-quality females subsequently suffered greater mortality than brothers of equivalent quality, which reared larvae with higher quality females. Our analyses identify three general ways in which parental effects can change the adaptive value of an adult behavioural trait: by influencing the associated fitness benefits and costs; by consequently changing the evolutionary outcome of social interactions; and by modifying the evolutionarily stable expression of behavioural traits that are themselves parental effects."

They do this by providing food in the form of a small dead animal, such as a mouse, from which they diligently remove any fur or feathers, and by defending both the food and the larvae from rivals. These actions reduce the fitness of the parents, which can be estimated by measuring by how long they survive after caring for their brood. They also increase the health of the larvae, as measured by how large the larvae are when they move away from the carcass to pupate."

It is well-appreciated that parental effects can persist beyond the juvenile stage, profoundly influencing the offspring's subsequent adult phenotype, including key fitness-related traits such as lifespan (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bateson et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Nussey et al., 2007</a>) and fecundity (<a href=\"#bib55\">Wilkin and Sheldon, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Emlen et al., 2012</a>).

We address this problem by focusing specifically on how conditions in early-life influence the fitness costs and benefits associated with the supply of parental care in adult life, using a combination of experiments and new theory.

If the fitness of both social partners is enhanced by the interaction then the outcome is cooperative, but if one party gains fitness at the other's expense then it is selfishly exploiting its social partner. For biparental care, cooperation and selfish exploitation are each possible elements of parents working together to raise young. A cooperative element is possible when the two parents have an equal genetic stake in their shared young and so derive equal fitness benefits from the supply of care. But, a selfish exploitative element is also possible due to conflict between the parents over how to divide the fitness costs associated with the supply of care (<a href=\"#bib1\">Arnqvist and Rowe, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Houston et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Lessells, 2006</a>). Selection favours parents that force their partner to sustain a greater fitness cost which, in accordance with the definition of sexual conflict (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kokko and Jennions, 2014</a>), means that the parent bearing the increased cost of care is selfishly exploited by its partner."

Theoretical analyses suggest that offspring that develop in a well-resourced environment may mature into high-quality parents. In this context, the term \u2018high-quality\u2019 is precisely defined: for the same provision of care, a \u2018high-quality\u2019 parent sustains a lower fitness cost than a \u2018low-quality\u2019 parent (<a href=\"#bib31\">Lessells and McNamara, 2012</a>).

Thus, early-life conditions potentially change the costs and benefits of parental care in adulthood, which in turn influence the early-life conditions experienced by the next generation.

It exhibits unusually elaborate biparental care, though one parent (of either sex) can raise offspring singlehandedly (e.g., <a href=\"#bib52\">Ward et al., 2009</a>). A major advantage of using the burying beetle is that we can measure correlates of fitness that are associated with receiving and supplying parental care. Indeed, our study differs from most previous empirical work on parental care by measuring fitness, rather than by quantifying behaviour itself. The rationale underpinning our experimental approach is this: behavioural traits associated with care cannot straightforwardly be mapped onto fitness (<a href=\"#bib43\">Sheldon, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Harrison et al., 2009</a>)\u2014yet, measures of fitness are key to understanding evolution of parental care (<a href=\"#bib43\">Sheldon, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Harrison et al., 2009</a>). By measuring changes in fitness associated with the supply and receipt of parental care, rather than quantifying behavioural traits, we can therefore more easily use our experiments to draw evolutionary conclusions."

Parents also defend the offspring and carcass from potential rivals (<a href=\"#bib42\">Scott, 1998</a>). Roughly, 5 days after hatching, larvae disperse from the carcass to pupate in the soil. At this point, or in the days beforehand, parents fly off in search of fresh carrion.

We quantified the fitness benefits of care by measuring larval mass at dispersal because this is strongly correlated with survival (e.g., <a href=\"#bib17\">Eggert et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Lock et al., 2004</a>). We used lifespan to measure the fitness costs associated with parental care, because several aspects of the burying beetle's reproductive biology mean that a longer lifespan contributes directly to greater fecundity in each sex and is therefore a good proxy for fitness. For example, in nature, <i>N. vespilloides</i> is an opportunistic breeder because it is reliant on locating small carrion to produce offspring (<a href=\"#bib41\">Schwarz and M\u00fcller, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Scott, 1998</a>). The longer it lives, the more likely it is to find this key resource. Males that are unsuccessful at locating carrion may attempt to attract females for mating by secreting pheromones (<a href=\"#bib15\">Eggert and M\u00fcller, 1989a</a>, <a href=\"#bib16\">1989b</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Eggert, 1992</a>). Females can store sperm from these matings for use in future reproduction (<a href=\"#bib35\">M\u00fcller and Eggert, 1989</a>) and males commonly gain paternity without attending the carcass upon which larvae are raised (<a href=\"#bib34\">M\u00fcller et al., 2007</a>). Therefore, the longer a male lives, the more likely he is to be successful in acquiring matings and increasing his reproductive success. In our previous laboratory experiments, we have shown that a longer lifespan enhances lifetime reproductive success in both sexes by affording a greater number of opportunities for reproduction (<a href=\"#bib52\">Ward et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Cotter et al., 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib11\">2011</a>).

By this point, egg laying and carcass preparation were complete, but the larvae had yet to hatch (in our colony, this starts 71.28 hr \u00b1 1.47 SE after pair formation; <i>n</i> = 47 pairs checked every ca. five hours 55\u201396 hr after pairing). We then randomly assigned each brood to one of two maternal care treatments: either widowed females were removed from their breeding box around hatching (roughly 71 hr after pairing) or removal occurred 24 hr after hatching (roughly 95 hr after pairing). In previous work, we found that larvae that receive maternal care for the first 24 hr after hatching have a similar mass and subsequent lifespan as larvae that receive full-time care by both parents (<a href=\"#bib7\">Boncoraglio and Kilner, 2012</a>). Carcass mass did not differ between care duration treatments (<i>F</i><sub>1, 58</sub> = 0.02, p = 0.960). In both treatments, we counted the number of dispersing larvae in each family, and weighed the brood at this point, before transferring larvae to new boxes for pupation and eclosion. This protocol was repeated over four weekly batches. Consistent with previous studies (<a href=\"#bib17\">Eggert et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Boncoraglio and Kilner, 2012</a>), the duration of maternal care positively affected final brood mass and size as well as individual offspring mass, both as a larva (calculated as average body mass at dispersal: total brood mass divided by number of dispersing larvae) and as an adult (pronotum width; for each measure of body size, one-way ANOVA (Analysis of Variance), p &lt; 0.045, <i>n</i> = 59 broods). Nevertheless, the range in body size we generated experimentally did not differ significantly from the range in size in field-caught beetles (see <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

At hatching, we moved the experimental individuals and their carcass to a new breeding box. Hatchlings and unhatched eggs remained in the box and were fostered out to other experimental subjects for post-hatching care. Foster larvae were drawn at random from individuals breeding in the same batch and were formed into broods of either 5 larvae or 20 larvae. These brood sizes were chosen because they were representative of the range in brood size we had recorded in our colony in previous generations. In this generation of our stock population, for example, brood size at dispersal in stock broods ranged from 3 to 24. Within each brood size treatment, foster broods did not differ in mass at hatching (always p &gt; 0.605). At dispersal, we measured total brood size and mass in each brood. At this point, adults were collected and housed alone under standard conditions until their time of death, and their lifespan was recorded. Overall, our experiment used 160 experimental individuals (i.e., 20 individuals per maternal care duration treatment per brood size treatment; 80 in total per sex) drawn from 40 different families. Carcass mass at breeding did not differ among the four treatments (one-way ANOVA, always p &gt; 0.240, <i>n</i> = 160 breeding bouts).

Adult beetles alternate their time between searching for suitable corpses, waiting at corpses for a mate to arrive, and breeding. When a searching individual locates an unoccupied corpse, or one that is occupied only by an opposite-sex adult, it remains there to breed. Corpses that are occupied by a same-sex competitor are avoided. This means that the first female and the first male to encounter a corpse form a monogamous breeding pair. They care jointly for their offspring, and once their brood reaches maturity, the pair separates and each beetle resumes its search for corpses. Although breeding is continuous in our model, we do not specify how much time beetles spend engaged in each activity. Rather, we model trade-offs between care provision, fecundity, and mortality that do not depend explicitly on time."

The reproductive value of good parents was nonetheless always higher, in contrast to the predictions of a previous model (<a href=\"#bib31\">Lessells and McNamara, 2012</a>). Poor quality individuals invested relatively less in care when partnered with good than with poor partners (i.e., <i>c</i><sub><i>PG</i></sub> &lt; <i>c</i><sub><i>PP</i></sub>) and good quality individuals compensated for their partner's inferior efforts by increasing their own care (<i>c</i><sub><i>GP</i></sub> &gt; <i>c</i><sub><i>GG</i></sub>). Interestingly, this was true both with and without sexual conflict (note that it is possible to remove conflict while retaining individual variation in parental quality, see <a href=\"#app1\">Appendix 1</a>). A reduction of care by individuals when paired with a high-quality partner consequently does not provide evidence for sexual conflict per se. However, when coparents are unrelated (as in the experiments and in the model with sexual conflict), a reduction in care by one individual will reduce the fitness of its partner and can consequently be considered exploitative."

Furthermore, it is well-understood that parents can change their offspring's fitness simply by influencing their offspring's size (e.g., <a href=\"#bib47\">Steiger, 2013</a>). The work we present here provides further evidence in support of each of these well-established research findings. The novel contribution of our study is to identify three different ways in which parental effects can change the adaptive value of the offspring's behaviour in later life: by influencing the associated fitness benefits and costs, by changing the evolutionary outcome of social interactions, and by modifying the evolutionarily stable expression of behavioural traits that are themselves parental effects."

Just as predicted by theory (<a href=\"#bib31\">Lessells and McNamara, 2012</a>), we found that the costs of care were divided most unevenly between the sexes when the difference within the pair in parental quality was at its greatest (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). High-quality males had lower residual fitness after raising offspring with low-quality females than their brothers did after raising young with high-quality female partners, losing up to 8 days from their lifespan. Under these conditions, and according to the fitness-based definition of selfish exploitation we are using here (see \u2018Introduction\u2019), males were exploited by their lower quality partners. Based on previous behavioural observations of biparental care in <i>N. vespilloides</i>, the most likely explanation is that males with low-quality partners put more effort into parental duties to compensate for the shortcomings of their mate and paid a higher fitness cost accordingly (<a href=\"#bib51\">Walling et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Ward et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Cotter et al., 2010</a>). How these differences in lifespan translate into reproductive success in nature is unknown, but since males might mate with multiple females in 8 days (<a href=\"#bib14\">Eggert, 1992</a>), the effects are unlikely to be trival."

Although lower quality females paid a higher cost for raising offspring as single mothers (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>), all females paid a similar cost under biparental care, irrespective of their quality (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). We suggest two explanations for these findings. One possibility is that they result from slight methodological differences between our first and second experiments. In the first experiment, we created standard broods of 5 and 20 larvae for our experimental subjects to raise, whereas in the second experiment, parents raised a brood size of their choosing. The former approach may have been more effective at exposing costs of care than the latter (see <a href=\"#bib29\">Lessells, 1991</a>). An alternative possibility is that the results reveal strategic differences in the rules for raising offspring that depend on whether females raise offspring alone or with a partner. Perhaps when raising offspring with a partner, the female's contributions to care are calibrated more in relation to the costs associated with care, than in relation to the benefits gained. Conversely, when rearing young alone, maternal investment is perhaps determined more by the benefits to be gained rather than the costs that are borne. Which of these explanations better accounts for the results remains to be determined with further experiments."

First, how likely is it that this social cost will ever show itself in nature, in any species that exhibits biparental care? Many species with biparental care also exhibit assortative pairing (e.g., <a href=\"#bib25\">Jiang et al., 2013</a>), and this will prevent the sort of mismatches in quality that we generated experimentally, and hence reduce the potential for exploitation of higher quality parents through sexual conflict. Our experimental results thus suggest a novel function of assortative pairing: to minimize differences in partner quality, and so reduce the social cost imposed by sexual conflict that we have uncovered here."

It might be argued that assortative pairing could instead arise as a by-product of fights for carcass ownership, because there can be intense competition within each sex over a carcass, which the largest individuals usually win (e.g., <a href=\"#bib21\">Hopwood et al., 2013</a>). The dominant individuals of each sex then pair up and prepare the carcass together. However, it is unclear how frequently carcass ownership is contested in natural populations. In nature, adult burying beetles fly to locate carrion, which is a key resource for reproduction (<a href=\"#bib42\">Scott, 1998</a>), often covering long distances in their search (<a href=\"#bib2\">Attisano and Kilner, 2015</a>). Therefore, individuals are distributed patchily and at relatively low densities, according to the distribution of carrion. A field study in which carrion was put out for burying beetles found that ownership of the carcass was contested within both sexes in 22 out of 42 breeding events (<a href=\"#bib34\">M\u00fcller et al., 2007</a>). Whether the dominant pair were closely matched in body size, and more closely matched than pairs at uncontested carcasses, is not known. One interpretation of these different strands of evidence is that assortative pairing by quality is unlikely at least half of the time in <i>N. vespilloides</i>, and on these occasions therefore, high-quality burying beetles parents are vulnerable to exploitation by inferior quality partners. However, it is hard to draw strong inferences from the field study because it probably increased the size of the local burying beetle population by drawing individuals in to carcasses presented at a relatively high density, and so might have changed the extent of competition for a carcass."

Previous theoretical work has focused on contemporary negotiations between partners to deduce the best strategy of care and has rather neglected transgenerational costs of the sort we have identified here. Therefore to address this question, we needed to develop new theory. Our theoretical work showed that the threat of exploitation during biparental care in the next generation changes current interactions between parents and their young. It limits the potential benefits associated with the provision of care and so reduces the evolutionarily stable level of care currently supplied to offspring (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). Thus, our model identifies a third way in which parental effects can influence the adaptive value of behavioural traits. It shows that when behavioural traits are themselves parental effects, and can change the adaptive value of a behavioural trait in the next generation, then evolutionarily stable levels of behaviour in the current generation will change accordingly as well."

Although our model assumes random mating with respect to parental quality, we expect that our results would remain qualitatively unchanged under assortative mating. Assortative mating would increase the benefits of investing in good quality parents-to-be, because good parents would on average find better partners. We would consequently expect the average level of care provided to be higher when there is assortative mating, rather than random mating, and to increase more steeply with the strength of parental effects. Nonetheless, even when mating is highly assortative, there is still sexual conflict over the level of care provided by each parent, and this should reduce the total care provided."

We have shown here that parental effects not only influence the inheritance of a behavioural trait (because well-cared for larvae mature into high-quality parents) but also alter the fitness associated with performing that behaviour\u2014and in three contrasting, yet interconnected ways. Thus, our experiments show how parental effects can potentially provide a mechanism for the rapid evolution of new adaptive social behaviour in the face of environmental change (see also <a href=\"#bib3\">Badyaev and Uller, 2009</a>). Whether parental effects similarly change the fitness costs and benefits associated with other social behaviours that might also function as parental effects, such as cooperative breeding, an individual's position in a social network, or even interspecific mutualisms, remains an exciting challenge for future work."

Mutants invade in genetically uniform groups, with mutant offspring returning to their parent group, and we measure the fitness of a mutant group by its growth rate when it is small relative to the population of typical individuals. While biologically somewhat artificial, this scenario removes sexual conflict entirely while retaining all other features of the original model (note in particular that the mutants within a group can differ in parental quality despite being genetically identical, as they may have experienced different early-life conditions; but differences in behaviour based on phenotype are now more analogous to arms and legs of a single individual human acting differently to aid in the joint task of efficient locomotion, than to a conflict scenario where one part tries to make the other do more work)."

However, by increasing the number of carcasses, the cited study actually causes an effective decrease in density of beetles. Because carcasses are likely less abundant than in this study, most carcasses are likely to be contested under natural conditions. Thus, the authors may be overestimating the likelihood of uncontested carcasses and the coincident possibility of exploitation by low quality individuals."
