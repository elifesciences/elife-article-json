When it comes to host\u2013plant specialization, insects are among the most versatile evolutionary innovators, able to disarm multiple chemical plant defenses. Sequestration is a widespread strategy to detoxify noxious metabolites, frequently for the insect\u2019s own benefit against predation. In this study, we describe the broad-spectrum ATP-binding cassette transporter <i>Cp</i>MRP of the poplar leaf beetle, <i>Chrysomela populi</i> as the first candidate involved in the sequestration of phytochemicals in insects. <i>Cp</i>MRP acts in the defensive glands of the larvae as a pacemaker for the irreversible shuttling of pre-selected metabolites from the hemolymph into defensive secretions. Silencing <i>Cp</i>MRP in vivo creates a defenseless phenotype, indicating its role in the secretion process is crucial. In the defensive glands of related leaf beetle species, we identified sequences similar to <i>Cp</i>MRP and assume therefore that exocrine gland-based defensive strategies, evolved by these insects to repel their enemies, rely on ABC transporters as a key element."

Plants have evolved defensive strategies such as the ability to produce noxious chemicals that deter insects, while many insects have evolved the means to thwart this defense and even turn it to their own advantage. The larvae of the poplar leaf beetle, <i>Chrysomela populi,</i> sequester toxic plant compounds in specialized glands on their backs and use these compounds to defend themselves against predators. The glands are lined with chemically inert chitin, the substance that makes up the insect exoskeleton, and the deterrent chemicals are released whenever the insect is threatened."

This transport protein belongs to a family of membrane proteins called ABC transporters, which help to shuttle substances out of cells or into cell organelles using energy produced by the hydrolysis of ATP molecules. The gene for this transporter is expressed in the glands of the leaf beetles at levels 7,000 times higher than elsewhere in the larvae."

Similar genes are found in other species of leaf beetle, suggesting that this type of transporter has been retained throughout evolution. Moreover, the transporter is not specific to a particular plant toxin; this enables leaf beetles to eat many different types of plants and boosts their chances of survival should a previous food source disappear."

To impede herbivory, plants have developed several morphological and biochemical traits; one of those is based on toxic secondary metabolite production. Insects, in turn, have evolved ingenious detoxification strategies, including the process of sequestration, to overcome the chemical plant defenses (<a href=\"#bib48\">Sorensen and Dearing, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Li et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Opitz and Muller, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Boeckler et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Winde and Wittstock, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Dobler et al., 2012</a>). These counter-mechanisms thereby affect the ecology and evolution of plants (<a href=\"#bib13\">Ehrlich and Raven, 1964</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Agrawal et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Hare, 2012</a>). The phenomenon of sequestration involves the uptake, transfer, and concentration of occasionally modified phytochemicals into the hemolymph, cuticle, specialized tissues or glands. Numerous species from almost all insect orders have evolved the ability to sequester chemicals (<a href=\"#bib12\">Duffey, 1980</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Nishida, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Opitz and Muller, 2009</a>). Frequently the sequestered toxins are used by insects for their own defense, as is the case in leaf beetles (Chrysomelidae) (<a href=\"#bib31\">Meinwald et al., 1977</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Pasteels et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Gillespie et al., 2003</a>). Up to now, the most comprehensive knowledge of sequestration processes has been obtained from juveniles of the leaf beetles belonging to the taxon Chrysomelina (<a href=\"#bib47\">Soetens et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Termonia et al., 2001</a>). The chemical defenses of these larvae are made up of compounds that are either sequestered from their host plants or synthesized de novo. Regardless of their origin, these compounds are transferred into nine pairs of specialized exocrine glands that are found on the back of the larvae (<a href=\"#bib18\">Hinton, 1951</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Pasteels and Rowell-Rahier, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Pasteels, 1993</a>). According to morphological studies, each defensive gland is composed of a number of enlarged secretory cells, which are in turn connected to a chitin-coated reservoir. The secretory cells are always accompanied by two canal cells that form a cuticular canal, which connects the secretory cell with the reservoir (<a href=\"#bib35\">Noirot and Quennedy, 1974</a>). When disturbed, the juvenile beetles evert their glandular reservoirs and present droplets of secretions."

Thus, the glands also secrete enzymes for the final metabolic conversion of precursors into defensive compounds in the reservoir. The ability to sequester plant glucosides is considered an energy-saving, monotypic adaptation within Chrysomelina (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), given the phylogenetic evidence that this process evolved from an ancestral autogenous biosynthesis of deterrent monoterpenes (iridoids) (<a href=\"#bib49\">Termonia et al., 2001</a>)."

In the reservoir of their defensive glands, the salicin is then metabolized into the volatile deterrent salicylaldehyde (<a href=\"#bib32\">Michalski et al., 2008</a>). Additionally, in <i>Chrysomela lapponica</i> several glucosidically bound alcohols are simultaneously imported, resulting in a diversity of compounds, especially of esters, in the exudate of the larvae (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hilker and Schulz, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Schulz et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Kirsch et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Tolzin-Banasch et al., 2011</a>). Physiological studies on de novo iridoid-producing, salicin sequestering, and ester-producing larvae using thioglucosides have indicated a complex influx\u2013efflux transport network that guides the plant-derived glucosides through the insect body (<a href=\"#bib10\">Discher et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Kuhn et al., 2004</a>). Presumed intestinal carriers in the gut epithelial cells allow a broad spectrum of secondary metabolites to enter the hemolymph, a process that is accompanied by a similar non-selective excretion via the Malpighian tubules. Furthermore, thioglucosides are being selectively accumulated, up to 500-fold, into the reservoir from a hemolymph pool, suggesting an active transport system is at work (<a href=\"#bib14\">Feld et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Kuhn et al., 2004</a>). By employing the obligate salicin sequestering species <i>C. populi</i>, we focus on deciphering the transport processes involved in the sequestration of glucosides in the defensive glands of chrysomelid larvae."

The predicted protein of <i>Cp</i>MRP from <i>C. populi</i> possesses the typical structural elements of ABC transporters (<a href=\"#bib53\">Zolnerciks et al., 2011</a>); these consist of four domains: two TMDs (transmembrane domains), harboring six proposed transmembrane spans and two NBDs (nucleotide-binding domains), containing Walker A and B boxes (sequences GPVGAGKS and VYLMD, respectively), separated by an ABC signature motif (sequence LSGGQRARINLARAI). Additionally, we conducted a 3D structure modeling of <i>Cp</i>MRP (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>) to support the conclusions of the sequence alignment and to illustrate the localization of characteristic sequence motifs.

Its intracellular presence in vesicular and reticular structures (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3Bc</a>) was corroborated by its co-localization with Bodipy-stained intracellular membranes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,D</a>).

By comparing developmental traits among <i>C. populi</i> larvae after injecting <i>cpmrp</i>-dsRNA or <i>gfp</i>-dsRNA as a control, we found that silencing <i>cpmrp</i> had no influence on larval growth (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). However, about 10 days post-injection, the <i>cpmrp</i> knockdown larvae completely lost their ability to respond to stimulation with droplets of defensive secretion (<a href=\"#fig2 fig4\">Figures 4B and 2B</a>). The secretions began to diminish at day 8. On the basis of transcript abundance, <i>cpmrp</i> mRNA was reduced to a basal level of 15\u201320% within 2\u20133 days and persisted until the larvae pupated (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a> summarizes the immunohistochemical analysis of <i>Cp</i>MRP expression in the secretory cells. At day 3 post-injection, both the <i>cpmrp</i> knocked-down and control secretory cells displayed a similar pattern of <i>Cp</i>MRP distribution (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4Da,b</a>). At later time points, however, the <i>Cp</i>MRP expression in the RNAi group was strongly reduced in comparison to the <i>gfp</i> control (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4Dc\u2014f</a>), which is in agreement with Western blot analysis (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). <i>Cp</i>MRP decayed exponentially to a relatively low basal level with a half-life of about 1 day, suggesting a degradation of <i>Cp</i>MRP that is linearly proportional to its concentration (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). This proportionality has already been reported in human hepatocytes (<a href=\"#bib41\">Pereg et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Popov et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Nakagawa et al., 2011</a>). Compared to a half-life of 5 days for the ABC transporters MDR1 and MDR2 reported in hepatocytes (<a href=\"#bib25\">Kipp and Arias, 2002</a>), the rate of <i>Cp</i>MRP turnover seems relatively high. Qualitative microscopic observations showed that secretory cells tended to increase the size of storage compartments, presumably vacuoles, of the <i>Cp</i>MRP knockdown larvae."

The apical part facing the lumen of the gland is a brush border membrane where storage vesicles are secreted via exocytosis (<a href=\"#bib35\">Noirot and Quennedy, 1974</a>). It is invaginated and forms an extracellular room that is connected to the reservoir by the canal. The well-known structure of exocrine glands gives hints at exocytic processes on the basis of a microvilli membrane. That <i>Cp</i>MRP is present in the microvilli membrane (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3Bc</a>), indicates that this is where the exocytosis of <i>Cp</i>MRP-containing storage vesicles takes place. After excreting the glucoside, <i>Cp</i>MRP is most likely recycled to recover the protein in the dense packaging zone of storage vesicles/vacuoles."

Our results demonstrate that <i>cpmrp-</i>silenced larvae are defenseless because they lack defensive secretions. Functionally, <i>Cp</i>MRP is a transporter for plant derived glucoside precursors present in storage compartments as well as in the microvilli membrane of the secretory cell. Therefore, our results have led us to propose a functional model of sequestration based on <i>Cp</i>MRP as the key element (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). The identification of transporter sequences highly similar to <i>Cp</i>MRP in the larval glands of other Chrysomelina species (<i>P. cochleariae</i> and <i>C. lapponica</i>) strongly implies that broad-spectrum ABC transporters involved in the sequestration of plant-derived metabolites are commonly present in the defense mechanism among Chrysomelina."

                        "text": "These results, together with our published data, lead us to conclude that the sequestration of plant glucosides in Chrysomelina larvae is the result of the presence of several barriers with various degrees of selectivity: (1) those controlling the non-selective uptake of plant-derived glucosides from the gut lumen into the hemolymph and their excretion by the Malpighian tubules (together these barriers are relevant for nutrition), (2) those controlling the selective transfer from the hemolymph into the secretory cells and (3) those controlling the secretion into the reservoir where the broad-spectrum ABC transporter acts as a pacemaker. This functional arrangement of a non-selective and a selective transporter in the defensive system seems to be common to many different leaf beetles (<a href=\"#bib10\">Discher et al., 2009</a>). This peculiar import system also facilitates the occasional host plant shifts of leaf beetles caused by parasite pressure (<a href=\"#bib1\">Agosta et al., 2010</a>). After the shift to a new host plant only the selective transport element needs to adjust to the new metabolites; all other transport elements may remain unchanged due to their broad substrate tolerance. This assumption is supported by the observation of <i>Cp</i>MRP homologs in different leaf beetles and beyond (<a href=\"#bib51\">Tribolium Genome Sequencing Consortium, 2008</a>); however, none of them has been functionally characterized or localized as yet. The identification of <i>Cp</i>MRP as a non-selective pacemaker involved in the sequestration of plant-derived glucosides highlights how insects counter plant chemical defenses to evolve new functions for the plant-derived toxins as allomones."

At defined time points, the incubation medium was removed and analyzed either by HPLC-MS or UV detection at 268 nm to quantify the substrate efflux from the oocytes into the incubation medium. The calculation of the kinetic parameters was performed with GraphPad Prism (version 5.04, Graphpad Software. San Diego, CA) using the built-in enzyme kinetics module.

You demonstrate the key importance of this intracellular carrier for the defense mechanism of the beetle larvae by well-controlled RNAi experiments.

Based on the uniform morphology of insect epidermal glands only, we would speculate the presence of <i>cpmrp</i> homologs in class 3 gland cells of insects (e.g., dermal glands of <i>Tenebrio molitor</i>, sternal glands of <i>Periplaneta americana</i>, pheromone gland of <i>Harpobittacus australis (</i>Noirot and Quennedy, 1974)). This need to be further investigated. In our manuscript we therefore focused on the discussion of the proposed sequestration model including <i>Cp</i>MRP homologs of other leaf beetles (<i>C. lapponica and P. cochleariae</i>) and their general relevance in exocrine glands of Chrysomelina species."
