In this study we provide novel insights into the mechanistic relationships between genetic variation, DNA methylation and transcriptome sequencing data in three different cell-types of the GenCord human population cohort. We find that the association between DNA methylation and gene expression variation among individuals are likely due to different mechanisms from those establishing methylation-expression patterns during differentiation. Furthermore, cell-type differential DNA methylation may delineate a platform in which local inter-individual changes may respond to or act in gene regulation. We show that unlike genetic regulatory variation, DNA methylation alone does not significantly drive allele specific expression. Finally, inferred mechanistic relationships using genetic variation as well as correlations with TF abundance reveal both a passive and active role of DNA methylation to regulatory interactions influencing gene expression."

In this study we provide novel insights into the mechanistic relationships between genetic variation, DNA methylation and transcriptome sequencing data in three different cell-types of the GenCord human population cohort. We find that the association between DNA methylation and gene expression variation among individuals are likely due to different mechanisms from those establishing methylation-expression patterns during differentiation. Furthermore, cell-type differential DNA methylation may delineate a platform in which local inter-individual changes may respond to or act in gene regulation. We show that unlike genetic regulatory variation, DNA methylation alone does not significantly drive allele specific expression. Finally, inferred mechanistic relationships using genetic variation as well as correlations with TF abundance reveal both a passive and active role of DNA methylation to regulatory interactions influencing gene expression."

Moreover, the same gene can also be expressed in different ways in different cells within an individual. A third level of variation is supplied by epigenetic markers: these are molecules that bind to the DNA at specific points and can have profound effects on the expression of nearby genes. One such epigenetic marker is the addition of a methyl group to a cytosine base, a process that is known as DNA methylation."

In mammals, most CpG sites have methyl groups attached, although regions with a lot of CpG sites (called CpG islands) are mostly unmethylated. Initial studies suggested that methylation prevented particular genes from being expressed, but more recent work has indicated that methylation can be associated with both reduced and increased expression of genes. Moreover, it is not clear if this association is active (i.e., changes in methylation drive changes in gene expression) or passive (DNA methylation is the result of gene regulation)."

They also find that the association between DNA methylation and gene expression can be either active or passive, and can depend on the context in which they occur in our genome. Finally, where the two copies or alleles of a gene are not equally expressed in a given cell, the difference in expression is primarily regulated by DNA sequence variation, with DNA methylation having little or no role on its own. Equally complex interactions and effects are expected in further studies of genetic and epigenetic variation."

DNA methylation in vertebrates occurs most commonly in cytosines that are adjacent to guanines (CpG sites). Mammalian DNA methylation levels are generally high, although CpG rich regions, called CpG islands (CGI), appear mostly unmethylated (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bird, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Weber et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Lister et al., 2009</a>). The mechanisms of de novo methylation and maintenance of methylation patterns are well known (<a href=\"#bib49\">Shoemaker et al., 2011</a>), and alterations of these can cause severe diseases (<a href=\"#bib43\">Robertson, 2005</a>). Even though it was originally reported to be involved in gene silencing (<a href=\"#bib21\">Holliday and Pugh, 1975</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Riggs, 1975</a>), more recent studies have found that DNA methylation can also be positively correlated to gene transcription when found in gene bodies (<a href=\"#bib19\">Hellman and Chess, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Lister et al., 2009</a>). Additionally, its participation in gene expression is proving to be highly variable, ranging from marking alternative intra-genic promoters (<a href=\"#bib34\">Maunakea et al., 2010</a>), to being affected by transcription factors (TFs) at enhancers (<a href=\"#bib50\">Stadler et al., 2011</a>) or it-self affecting the binding of TFs such as MYC (<a href=\"#bib39\">Prendergast and Ziff, 1991</a>). Hence, whether DNA methylation is a consequence of gene regulation, or whether it controls gene expression changes\u2014that is, whether it plays a passive or an active role in gene regulation\u2014still remains a topic of debate (<a href=\"#bib47\">Schubeler, 2012</a>)."

Furthermore, studies looking at natural DNA methylation variation in human populations have shown that genetic variation influences DNA methylation levels in different cell-types (<a href=\"#bib15\">Gibbs et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Zhang et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bell et al., 2011</a>), but the mechanisms by which this occurs are far from clear. In these and other studies (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kulis et al., 2012</a>), the association between DNA methylation and gene expression in a population context, where the same gene and same methylation site can be compared across multiple individuals, has been reported to be both positive and negative. Overall, the nature of the relationships among genetic variants, DNA methylation and gene expression are still unclear despite some initial efforts (<a href=\"#bib54\">van Eijk et al., 2012</a>)."

By assaying in a high resolution and genome wide level these three layers of information in three different cell-types originating from the same set of individuals, we are able to study the role of DNA methylation variation in different dimensions. Our results reveal a picture where DNA methylation variable sites are mechanistically associated to gene expression in complex and context dependent ways that can be of passive or active nature. We further highlight some of the mechanisms by which passive DNA methylation may occur and how this role can interplay with genetic variation."

We observe the same pattern in our study looking at the promoter regions of all genes of each individual separately and for each cell-type (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The across individual methylation-gene expression associations (eQTMs) however appear to be either positive or negative, even for DNA methylation sites in promoter regions. Hence, we hypothesized that methylation sites in promoter regions from positive (pos) and negative (neg) eQTMs contribute differently (positively and negatively, respectively) to gene expression levels across genes. Contrary to our hypothesis, we find that methylation sites correlate negatively with gene expression across genes independently of whether they correlate positively or negatively with gene expression across individuals (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>; Spearman correlation coefficient, <i>rho</i> = \u22120.11, p=1.1 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22124</sup>, and <i>rho</i> = \u22120.10, p=1.7 \u00d7 10<sup>\u221213</sup>, respectively; see also <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). The strength of these negative correlations, despite involving a subset of genes, is comparable to the one found at a genome-wide level, correlating all expressed genes with their promoter DNA methylation status per individual (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). These results suggest that the mechanisms and processes underlying inter-individual DNA methylation variation associated to gene expression are at least partly independent of the mechanisms involved in the establishment of the repressive mark of promoter DNA methylation across genes during development and differentiation."

Hence, we asked whether differentially methylated sites across the three cell-types are more likely to be functionally relevant when variable within a population, hence more often associated to gene expression (eQTMs) or genetic variation (mQTLs) than non-differentiated sites across cell-types. We measured the level of differentiation for each site by calculating its median methylation level in each cell-type and then calculating the coefficient of variation between those three medians, which is a measure of variability that controls for the mean level of methylation (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>). We find that as differentiation per methylation site increases, a higher proportion of eQTMs and mQTLs are observed (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). This is statistically supported by the fact that the tissue differentiation level of methylation sites involved in eQTMs and mQTLs is significantly higher than for non-eQTM and non-mQTL sites, respectively (all p values&lt;2.2 \u00d7 10<sup>\u221216</sup>, Wilcoxon test, <a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3B,C</a>). These results show that the same methylation sites marking or contributing to tissue differentiation are participating in inter-individual variability that is highly determined by genetic variation and associated to gene expression. This could indicate that the establishment of differentially methylated regions during development could be delineating a backbone where local inter-individual changes may occur."

We find a significant increased presence of negative compared to positive eQTMs in CTCF binding sites, enhancers and promoters, with this increase being higher in non-CpG island (CGI) promoters compared to CGI promoters (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Interestingly, we discover a significant depletion of mQTLs in CGI promoters, and a significant enrichment of mQTLs in non-CGI promoters (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). This shows that methylation sites in non-CGI promoters are under a stronger genetic control than at CGI promoters, where methylation is in general robustly maintained at low levels. Nevertheless, genetic variation in CpG islands commonly affects gene expression, since we find that eQTLs are significantly enriched at these genomic regions (all p values&lt;0.03). Overall, these results suggest that the role of DNA methylation can be highly dependent on the genomic and functional context."

In order to test whether ASE is caused by genetic variation or differential DNA methylation, we compared the magnitude of allelic imbalance in eQTL genes between individuals who are heterozygous for the eQTL and their respective homozygotes. Similar to other studies (<a href=\"#bib11\">Dimas et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Pickrell et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Montgomery et al., 2010</a>), at a genome-wide level a significantly greater allelic imbalance is associated with heterozygote eQTLs in all three cell-types (p values&lt;3.0 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22128</sup>, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). In order to test whether ASE is driven by haplotype differences in DNA methylation alone, potentially represented by semimethylated sites (partially methylated, \u03b2-value &gt;0.3 and &lt;0.7), we analyzed the genes having eQTM methylation sites that are not associated with SNPs (filtered out SNP-methylation correlations with nominal p&lt;0.01). A comparison of allelic imbalance between individuals with semimethylated eQTMs, and homomethylated (i.e., fully methylated, \u03b2-value &gt; 0.7, or unmethylated, \u03b2-value &lt; 0.3) eQTMs, revealed no significant differences (p values&gt;0.42, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Additionally, ASE driven by heterozygote eQTLs is significantly higher than that of semimethylated eQTMs (p values&lt;7.5 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22123</sup>, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Furthermore, as a positive control, we observe that allelic imbalance in imprinted genes, known to be driven by allelic DNA methylation, is significantly higher than in homomethylated eQTMs (p values&lt;9.7 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22124</sup>, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Thus, while ASE is shown to be significantly driven by genetic variation (or by DNA methylation in imprinted genes), we find no evidence in our data of methylation alone contributing to ASE. This argues that DNA methylation is rarely allele-specific in the absence of DNA sequence variation effects, and while we cannot exclude other possible epigenetic sources of ASE, the results suggest that the widespread ASE across the genome may be primarily driven by common and rare genetic regulatory variants."

We selected for each exon all eQTLs with p&lt;1 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22124</sup> that fell in independent recombination intervals and all eQTMs with p&lt;0.001. To avoid artificial inflation of significant interactions, we filtered out any exon-SNP-meth triplets where the SNP and methylation site correlated with p&lt;0.05. To avoid spurious interactions caused by outliers, we further filtered out cases where there were less than four individuals homozygous for the minor allele of a SNP. Finally, to further account for remaining correlation between the SNP and the methylation we permuted the expression values 1000 times to infer the 95% confidence intervals and assess the significance of the enrichment of low p values. Synergistic interactions are enriched in LCLs and T-cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>) with \u03c0<sub>1</sub> being 4.3% and 9.3% (all p&lt;0.001), which reflects the percent of estimated true positives from the p value distributions (<a href=\"#bib51\">Storey and Tibshirani, 2003</a>).

We used Bayesian Network (BN) construction and relative likelihood (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019) to test which of the three possible causative models depicted in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a> and described below is the most likely given the data for each set of variables. Under the \u2018INDEP\u2019 (independent) model, a SNP affects independently gene expression and DNA methylation (passive role of methylation). Under the \u2018SME\u2019 (SNP-methylation-expression) model, the SNP affects methylation, which then affects gene expression (active role). The \u2018SEM\u2019 (SNP-expression-methylation) model requires that a SNP affects gene expression, and expression then affects methylation (passive role). We tested the relative likelihood of these models choosing a non-biased approach where at least two of the three pairwise correlations between genetic variation, gene expression and DNA methylation are significant, yielding 831\u20132928 SNP-methyl-exon triplets tested per cell-type. All three models occur, depending on cell-type and sign of correlation between DNA methylation and gene expression (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). The INDEP model, that reflects a passive role for DNA methylation, is the most likely model in fibroblasts and LCLs. However, in T-cells the SME model, where methylation takes an active causative role, is the major contributor. Note that in the SEM model, where methylation is passive being influenced by gene expression levels, a higher likelihood of pos-eQTMs is found compared to the SME model. Overall, these results suggest that DNA methylation can be both active, by being a likely cause of gene expression variation levels, or passive, by being a consequence or an independent mark of gene expression levels."

From the total number of tests, 61%, 36% and 27% were called as high confidence (HC) in fibroblasts, LCLs and T-cells, respectively (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a>). The relative frequencies of these HC calls look similar to the general relative likelihood space of the models (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). As an example of a HC INDEP model, we identified in fibroblasts a case occurring at the promoter of gene <i>DPYSL4</i> and involving a methylation site associated to age and age rate in blood samples (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hannum et al., 2013</a>). In this example, SNP rs12772795 affects independently the DNA methylation status of site cg05652533 and the expression level of gene <i>DPYSL4</i>, possibly via an effect on the binding of CTCF nearby (given binding peak reported), which is a factor known to alter DNA methylation levels locally (<a href=\"#bib50\">Stadler et al., 2011</a>). As an example of an SME model, we have identified in T-cells SNP rs1362125 that could be affecting the binding of SP1 (overlapping peak reported), which is a factor shown to confer methylation protection (<a href=\"#bib8\">Boumber et al., 2008</a>). This could then alter the methylation state of site cg24703717 (78bp away) that falls in a YY1 binding peak, a factor whose binding is known to be sensitive to DNA methylation levels (<a href=\"#bib25\">Kim et al., 2003</a>). Hence methylation could actively alter binding of YY1, negatively affecting the expression of the gene <i>HLA-F</i>. Finally, we would like to highlight in LCLs an SEM scenario in which SNP rs3733346, located in a DNAse hypersensitive site, affects the expression of gene <i>DGKQ</i>, whose transcriptional activity could then be influencing positively DNA methylation levels of site cg00846425 located in its gene body, as has been suggested to be a possible phenomenon for gene body DNA methylation (<a href=\"#bib16\">Hahn et al., 2011</a>)."

It has been shown in mice (<a href=\"#bib50\">Stadler et al., 2011</a>) that TFs can influence DNA methylation levels near their binding sites (TFBSs). In addition, by correlating expression levels of TFs with DNA methylation at their TFBSs in different cell-types, this pattern has also been observed for some TFs in human tissues (<a href=\"#bib53\">Thurman et al., 2012</a>). In order to test whether human inter-individual differences of TF expression levels would affect DNA methylation that is itself associated to gene expression we used the ENCODE dataset of TFBSs based on ChIP-seq assays for 111 TFs (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bernstein et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Gerstein et al., 2012</a>), and correlated their expression levels with eQTM methylation levels found at their reported binding sites. We found a strong enrichment of significant TF-methylation associations, with \u03c0<sub>1</sub> being 18%, 9% and 25%, in fibroblasts, LCL, and T-cells, respectively (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). At 10% FDR, we find significant associations for 27, 47 and 99 different TFs in fibroblasts, LCL and T-cells, respectively. A strong enrichment of significant associations can also be appreciated for each TF individually as depicted in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>. We further tested whether genetic variants that could potentially alter TF binding would interact with TF abundance on their effect on DNA methylation levels (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). Despite the limited number of cases that could be tested (N = 114), we find an enrichment of low p values for such interactions, with \u03c0<sub>1</sub> estimated at 15% of true positives, and the top interaction involving the TF c-Jun in T-cells (p=1 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22124</sup>, <a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). These results suggest that TF levels could be influencing DNA methylation and gene expression levels simultaneously. It is possible that in some cases this could occur via the interaction with DNA sequence variation. This could illustrate a realistic model for passive but at the same time correlated levels of DNA methylation with gene expression."

DNA methylation levels can depend on TF binding (<a href=\"#bib50\">Stadler et al., 2011</a>). TF binding levels in turn can be determined by both inter-individual differences of TF abundance and genetic variants at their binding sites. This picture shows how DNA methylation can be linked to genetic variation, and can participate in gene regulation in a passive manner. This scenario is quite different from the often-assumed simple model of genetic variation affecting the epigenome, which in turn affects the transcriptome, and furthermore these relationships can be of different nature depending on tissue and genomic region. This is likely to be true for other epigenetic mechanisms as well, and properly characterizing these relationships will enhance our understanding of genome function and complex disease."

RNA samples were quantified with NanoDrop (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) and Qubit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and analyzed with a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). Samples were prepared for sequencing with the Illumina mRNA-seq and TruSeq sample preparation kits (Illumina, San Diego, CA) as indicated by manufacturer\u2019s instructions. In these library preparation procedures, poly-A RNA is selected using poly-T oligo-attached magnetic beads; then the RNA is cleaved, converted to first strand cDNA and after RNA digestion and second DNA strand synthesis, the fragments are end repaired and ligated to the adapters containing specific primer indexes. The cDNA libraries are then PCR amplified. Libraries were sequenced in either sets of 6 samples per lane in the Genome Analyzer II machine or 12 samples per lane in the HiSeq2000 machine, randomly pooling in the same lane samples from different cell-types and individuals. Afterwards, the 49-bp sequenced paired-end reads were mapped to the reference genome (<a href=\"#bib27\">Lander et al., 2001</a>) GRCh37 with BWA v0.5.9 (<a href=\"#bib28\">Li and Durbin, 2009</a>). Using SAMtools (<a href=\"#bib30\">Li et al., 2009</a>), we kept reads mapping uniquely to the genome, with MAPQ \u2265 10 and properly paired. In order to quantify exons in a non-redundant way, we created a set of merged exons from the GENCODE v10 annotation (<a href=\"#bib18\">Harrow et al., 2006</a>). In more detail, we took all protein coding and lincRNA transcripts and merged any overlapping exons into new exon units. We then counted the number of reads mapping to each exon unit (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Technical outliers having less than 5M exonic reads or extremely low insert size mode were removed from the study. In order to keep only the set of exons that we considered expressed in each cell-type, we filtered out exons that had no reads mapped in 10% or more of the samples per cell-type. This yielded sets of 70,800\u201376,870 exons belonging to 12,265\u201312,863 expressed genes depending on the cell-type and analysis. Afterwards, we normalized the raw exon counts by scaling all libraries to 10 million reads, based on the total number of exonic reads per sample. In order to remove technical variance from our samples, we tested the effect of many different covariates on our scaled exon counts in each cell-type by linear regression. We decided to correct for mean GC content per library, run date, primer index and insert size mode, using a random effects model (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Thus, our final exon expression levels are the residuals after correcting for those covariates plus the corrected mean (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>)."

The starting quantity of DNA was 1000 ng and after BC we normalized all our samples to have a final concentration of 40 ng/\u03bcl or the closest possible amount. BC-DNA was then processed through the 450K Illumina Infinium HD Methylation Assay (Illumina, San Diego, CA) according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. In brief, this is an assay that involves whole genome amplification, specific hybridization capture, and allele-specific single-base primer extension. Samples from the three cell-types were processed in a randomized manner. The controls available in the methylation assay for verifying the efficiency of our bisulfite conversion indicated that none of our samples had bad efficiency of bisulfite conversion. We removed three technical outliers that didn\u2019t cluster well with any cell-type in a principal component analysis. From the 482,421 CpG sites assayed, we filtered out probes with 1000 genomes SNPs or indels at European minor allele frequency &gt;5% and then any other probes that had any of the final set of SNPs used in our study. This yielded a total of 416,118 CpG sites to work with. We quantile normalized the data in the following way. The Illumina 450k array is composed of two probe types. Probe type 1 reads the methylated signal and unmethylated signal in the same channel (red or green) and probe type 2 reads the methylated signal in the green channel and the unmethylated signal in the red channel. The distribution of \u03b2-values before any normalization is quite different for each probe type, thus the two probe types were normalized separately. For probe type 1, the intensity for the methylated and unmethylated signals were quantile normalized across individuals for each color channel separately. As the density of signal intensities showed that there was a color bias (at least for the unmethylated probe), the color channels were quantile normalized within individuals for the methylated signal and unmethylated signal separately. For probe type 2, the methylated signals and unmethylated signals were quantile normalized across individual. As for this probe the methylated signal is always in green and the unmethylated signal is always in red. The color bias needs to be corrected before computing \u03b2-values. In order to correct the color bias, the methylated (unmethylated) signal probe type 2 normalized across individuals is quantile normalized with the methylated (unmethylated) signal of probe type 1 that was previously quantile normalized across individuals and within for color correction. In a final step, the \u03b2-values of the two probe types were quantile normalized together leading to the final \u03b2-values (<a href=\"#fig1s5\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplements 5\u20137</a>). The \u03b2-value is defined as the proportion of fluorescent signal from the methylated allele over the total fluorescent signal (methylated and unmethylated alleles); this represents the percentage of methylation per site (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bibikova et al., 2006</a>)."

The direction of the edges between two nodes can be interpreted as a causal relationship. BN have been used before to infer causality in genetic problems (<a href=\"#bib45\">Schadt et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Zhu et al., 2008</a>). Likelihood methods are commonly used to estimate the most likely network\u2014that is, the set of causal relationships among the different variables that better agrees with the data."

BN satisfy the local Markov property\u2014that is, each variable is conditionally independent of its non-descendants given its parent variables. The Markov property defines the decomposition of the joint probability density of the network into a set of local distributions. Thanks to the Markov property it is easy to calculate the likelihood of a given BN. Since different networks have different complexities, it is common to use a score that takes into account the network complexity instead of the raw likelihood to compare the networks. We used the R package bnlearn (<a href=\"#bib48\">Scutari, 2010</a>) to calculate the maximum likelihood of the networks and the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) score. AIC = 2k \u2212 2ln(L), where k is the number of parameters and L is the maximum likelihood. To calculate how much better one network is compared to another, we used the relative likelihood of one network with respect to the other. If we have two networks, N1 and N2, with fixed parameters and AIC(N1) \u2264 AIC(N2), then the relative likelihood of N2 with respect to N1 is defined as: exp((AIC(N1)\u2212AIC(N2))/2). The networks we have compared (mentioned in main text) have five parameters each."

In the second dataset, for each exon we selected its best eQTL and its best eQTM; not requiring significance for the mQTL (n = 287, 1316 and 871 in F, L, T), which would enrich for the SEM model since the mQTL is the most distant association.

The CIT makes SME and SEM calls if either has a p&lt;0.05, makes no call if p&lt;0.05 for both models (highly infrequent) and makes a call for the INDEP if neither SME or SEM has a significant p-value. We have decided to call a high confidence set of SME and SEM models when they are called as such by both the BN and the CIT methods. Since the INDEP calls in the CIT do not require significance, we called a high confidence INDEP if 1) it is called INDEP by both methods, and 2) its BN relative likelihood (RL) to the second best model is equal or higher to the median RL of the SME and SEM high confidence calls to their second best prediction."

The authors draw the conclusion that eQTMs are mostly independent of the mechanism involved in the repressive effect of DNA methylation on expression across genes. This is a strong conclusion, but is currently poorly supported. Specifically, the eQTMs were partitioned into only two bins (positive and negative effect). It might be, however, that most of the pos- and neg-eQTM effects are insignificant (around 0) and therefore some important inter-relations are masked within a sea of noise. Instead, the same plots should be regenerated for eQTMs split into a larger number of bins (e.g., 5 bins: very-neg, neg, no-sign, pos, very-pos-eQTMs), to show whether the negative correlation holds in all of these 5 bins, and more generally is not an artifact of the binning."

To control for this possibility the authors should use a 'normalized differentiation in methylation' (i.e., use the residuals of differentiation per methylation after removing the effect of the methylation average), and then use these normalized (residual) values to repeat the same test relating (residual) differentiation with mQTLs and eQTMs."

In addition, there is no evaluation of the significance of the resulting predicted models (which then precludes the authors \u2013 and future readers \u2013 from following up on individual findings). To correct for such potential artifacts, we suggest applying a direct evaluation of the distribution of relative likelihood for each pair of models based on data reshuffling (permutation test). Based on such tests, it is possible to (A) get a threshold for each of the likelihood comparisons using a common <i>P</i>-value threshold. This would allow comparing results from different cell types and models using a common systematic threshold; and (B) discriminate significant vs. non-significant relative likelihood scores. Once this is done the authors should report how many of the results are significant and what the statistics are when using significant predictions only, and, finally, they should highlight specific examples, which would enhance the paper's impact and biological relevance."

It might be, however, that most of the pos- and neg-eQTM effects are insignificant (around 0) and therefore some important inter-relations are masked within a sea of noise. Instead, the same plots should be regenerated for eQTMs split into a larger number of bins (e.g., 5 bins: very-neg, neg, no-sign, pos, very-pos-eQTMs), to show whether the negative correlation holds in all of these 5 bins, and more generally is not an artifact of the binning</i>."

As a consequence, the strength of the correlations of eQTMs as measured by the Spearman correlation coefficient are far from zero (see histograms below: <a href=\"#fig5\">Author response image 1</a>), the minimum of the absolute value being 0.368, 0.308, and 0.407 in fibroblasts, LCLs, and T-cells, respectively.

The minimum of the absolute effect size is 3.16 and 7 in fibroblasts and T-cells, and LCLs have only 6 eQTMs with effect size below 1.
