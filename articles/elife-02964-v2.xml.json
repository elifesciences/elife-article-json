In this study, we find that <i>Spiroplasma</i> proliferation specifically depletes host hemolymph diacylglyceride, the major lipid class transported by the lipoprotein, Lpp. RNAi-mediated knockdown of Lpp expression, which reduces the amount of circulating lipids, inhibits <i>Spiroplasma</i> proliferation demonstrating that bacterial proliferation requires hemolymph-lipids. Altogether, our study shows that an insect endosymbiont acquires specific lipidic metabolites from the transport lipoproteins in the hemolymph of its host. In addition, we show that the proliferation of this endosymbiont is limited by the availability of hemolymph lipids. This feature could limit endosymbiont over-proliferation under conditions of host nutrient limitation as lipid availability is strongly influenced by the nutritional state."

In this study, we find that <i>Spiroplasma</i> proliferation specifically depletes host hemolymph diacylglyceride, the major lipid class transported by the lipoprotein, Lpp. RNAi-mediated knockdown of Lpp expression, which reduces the amount of circulating lipids, inhibits <i>Spiroplasma</i> proliferation demonstrating that bacterial proliferation requires hemolymph-lipids. Altogether, our study shows that an insect endosymbiont acquires specific lipidic metabolites from the transport lipoproteins in the hemolymph of its host. In addition, we show that the proliferation of this endosymbiont is limited by the availability of hemolymph lipids. This feature could limit endosymbiont over-proliferation under conditions of host nutrient limitation as lipid availability is strongly influenced by the nutritional state."

Often the two partners involved in these interactions will depend on each other to thrive: microbes support important host functions and in return the host provides a safe place to live and a continuous supply of food. Many microbes that are intimately associated with animals have lost the ability to gain nutrients from sources other than their host and are unable to survive on their own. However, in many cases, the source and the type of nutrients provided to the microbes are unknown."

Herren et al. speculate that this mechanism reduces the fitness cost of harboring the microbes and prevents the damaging consequence of an uncontrolled proliferation of the microbes. Moreover, <i>Spiroplasma's</i> preference for lipids may explain why it helps to protect flies against parasitic infection, as many parasites also rely on lipids for their growth. Herren et al. suggest this strategy could also be used in other animal\u2013microbe associations."

Two of the most prevalent and well-characterized facultative insect endosymbionts are <i>Wolbachia</i> and <i>Spiroplasma</i>, which are estimated to infect \u223c40% and 5\u201310% of all insects species, respectively (<a href=\"#bib28\">Hackett and Clark, 1979</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Duron et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Hilgenboecker et al., 2008</a>).

However, the direct study of the metabolism of endosymbiotic bacteria is challenging, due to the high level of integration and interdependence between endosymbionts and their hosts.

Experimental studies are generally in line with this prediction, for example <i>Wolbachia</i> and <i>Spiroplasma</i> have relatively minor effects on host fitness (<a href=\"#bib46\">Martins et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Unckless and Jaenike, 2012</a>), however, fitness costs usually become apparent as hosts age (<a href=\"#bib16\">Ebbert, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Min and Benzer, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Fry et al., 2004</a>). For endosymbionts that colonize the germline from the adult soma, it has been demonstrated that endosymbiont titers are positively correlated with transmission fidelity (<a href=\"#bib15\">Dyer et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Unckless et al., 2009</a>). In general, endosymbiont titers (and hence proliferation rates) will therefore be determined by a compromise between the need to minimize host fitness costs and maximize transmission fidelity (<a href=\"#bib40\">Jaenike, 2009</a>). Since host fitness costs are most likely minimized by the limiting excessive endosymbiont proliferation, the factors that limit endosymbiont proliferation are of central importance for the biology of endosymbionts; however, few mechanisms that are capable of limiting endosymbiont proliferation have been identified (<a href=\"#bib43\">Login et al., 2011</a>). The proliferation of bacteria is often controlled by host immune systems; however, it is notable certain endosymbionts, including <i>Spiroplasma</i>, are not susceptible to host immune responses (<a href=\"#bib32\">Herren and Lemaitre, 2011</a>) suggesting that other factors are likely to be of importance for limiting their proliferation."

When maintained on a rich <i>Drosophila</i> diet, flies-harboring <i>Spiroplasma</i> have a significantly shortened life span compared to flies that do not harbor <i>Spiroplasma</i> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), which is in agreement with a previous study on <i>Drosophila willistoni</i> and WSRO <i>Spiroplasma</i> (<a href=\"#bib16\">Ebbert, 1991</a>). Notably, the presence of <i>Spiroplasma</i> did not significantly affect the death rate until flies were about 21\u201325 days old but flies began to exhibit signs of <i>Spiroplasma</i>-induced pathology between 14 and 21 days, as demonstrated by decreased performance in climbing assays (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Prior to death, aged <i>Spiroplasma</i>-harboring flies exhibit an apparent lack of coordination and tremors. The increase in <i>Spiroplasma</i>-induced lethality and pathology in old flies correlates with the increase of <i>Spiroplasma</i> titers, observed by qPCR of whole flies (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>) and fluorescence microscopy of hemolymph (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Consistent with previous studies on other <i>Drosophila-</i>endosymbiotic <i>Spiroplasma</i> strains (<a href=\"#bib2\">Anbutsu and Fukatsu, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Haselkorn et al., 2013</a>), we noticed that <i>Spiroplasma</i> titers reached a plateau in old flies (age &gt;28 days) suggesting that a factor might limit <i>Spiroplasma</i> proliferation at this stage. In light of the finding that <i>Spiroplama</i> reduces fly life span and the apparent trade-off between life span and reproductive output in <i>Drosophila</i> (<a href=\"#bib55\">Partridge et al., 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Sgr\u00f2 and Partridge, 1999</a>), we also compared the rate of egg production between <i>Spiroplasma</i>-infected and uninfected females. There was a twofold increase in the number of eggs laid by <i>Spiroplasma</i>-infected virgin flies compared to <i>Spiroplasma</i>-uninfected virgin flies over 14 days (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). The number of eggs laid by <i>Spiroplasma</i>-infected mated flies over a 14-day period was similar to <i>Spiroplasma</i>-uninfected mated flies, however, <i>Spiroplasma</i>-infected mated flies laid an increased number of eggs in the first 2 days post-eclosion (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). These results indicate that the presence of <i>Spiroplasma</i> stimulates egg production in virgin flies and also in mated flies over the first 2 days post eclosion, while causing a minor decline in egg production of mated flies at later time points. Collectively, these experiments demonstrate that (i) <i>Spiroplasma</i> has a low impact on the general fitness of its host, negatively affecting survival and egg laying only in old flies and (ii) that this decrease in host fitness correlates with higher <i>Spiroplasma</i> titers."

To test this hypothesis, we maintained adult flies on a nutrient poor diet. Under these nutrient-limiting conditions, <i>Drosophila</i> survival is significantly compromised, however it is important to note that this diet still contains sufficient nutritional content to support an entire <i>Drosophila</i> life-cycle (<a href=\"#bib68\">Vijendravarma et al., 2012</a>). It is also worth mentioning that we only examined the effects of nutrient deprivation in adult flies and that for all the experiments conducted <i>Drosophila</i> larvae were raised under normal conditions. Surprisingly, <i>Spiroplasma</i>-infected and uninfected virgin flies had a similar life span (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) and produced similar numbers of eggs under nutrient-limiting conditions (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). For mated flies under nutrient limitation, harboring <i>Spiroplasma</i> resulted in a minor reduction in survival relative to flies that did not harbor <i>Spiroplasma</i> (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). <i>Spiroplasma</i>-infected mated flies produced more eggs than <i>Spiroplasma</i>-uninfected mated flies under nutrient-limiting conditions (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). These findings suggest that, in contrast to our initial hypothesis, harboring <i>Spiroplasma</i> has a rather limited fitness cost under nutrient-limiting conditions. Importantly, we observed that <i>Spiroplasma</i> proliferation in whole flies (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>) and hemolymph (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) was also significantly inhibited when flies are maintained on a nutrient poor diet. Thus, the inhibition of <i>Spiroplasma</i> proliferation in flies that are maintained under nutrient-limiting conditions could explain why <i>Spiroplasma</i> has limited fitness costs under these conditions. For consistency, and to facilitate the maintenance of flies under identical conditions, subsequent experiments were carried out on virgin females (unless otherwise specified)."

To identify these factors, we examined the effect that maintaining uninfected flies for 12 days on a nutrient poor diet had on the concentration of metabolites in the hemolymph (where <i>Spiroplasma</i> reside). We found that raising flies on a nutrient poor diet resulted in significantly lower concentrations of protein, sterol and diacylglyceride (DAG, the main transport lipid in <i>Drosophila</i>) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013C</a>), while levels of glucose and trehalose were not changed significantly (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>) and L-amino acids increased (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Thus, nutrient limitation led to a specific decline in hemolymphatic protein and lipid concentrations. We then complemented the nutrient poor diet with either inactivated yeast (rich in protein and lipids) or sucrose, we found that only inactivated yeast extract was able to recover the <i>Spiroplasma</i> proliferation rates observed on rich media (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). This indicates that <i>Spiroplasma</i> proliferation is not only affected by the caloric content of the food but by the composition of the diet. Taken together, these results lend support to the hypothesis that <i>Spiroplasma</i> proliferation is heavily dependent on hemolymph metabolite composition and that certain metabolites (e.g., lipids and protein) could play a more important role than others (e.g., sugars)."

                                "text": "To gain a better insight into the relationship between <i>Spiroplasma</i> and host physiology, we monitored the effects of harboring <i>Spiroplasma</i> on the concentration of metabolites in the hemolymph of flies raised on a rich diet. We observed that the concentration of measured sugars was not changed and that the L-amino acid concentration was even increased in the presence of <i>Spiroplasma</i> (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013C</a>). We also found that the hemolymph of flies-harboring <i>Spiroplasma</i> had an increased concentration of proteins and sterol (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D,E</a>). However, after centrifugation to remove bacterial cells, the protein and sterol concentration was no longer significantly different between <i>Spiroplasma</i>-infected and <i>Spiroplasma</i>-uninfected hemolymph samples. This suggests that <i>Spiroplasma</i> cells contain a substantial amount of proteins and sterol, but that the presence of this endosymbiont does not deplete either of these factors in the hemolymph. Notably, we observed that <i>Spiroplasma</i>-infected flies experienced a significant drop in the concentration of DAG within the hemolymph (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>). Importantly, this difference is not caused by the previously noted differences in the rate of egg production between <i>Spiroplasma</i>-infected and <i>Spiroplasma</i>-uninfected virgin flies, as a decrease in DAG was also observed in mated flies (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), where <i>Spiroplasma</i> did not affect the number of eggs laid over 14 days (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). We also observed that there was a more marked decline in DAG levels in 28-day-old <i>Spiroplasma</i>-infected relative to uninfected flies (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), where <i>Spiroplasma</i> titers have nearly reached their maximum levels (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>) and egg production declines (<a href=\"#bib11\">David et al., 1975</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Partridge et al., 1987</a>). We then investigated the impact of <i>Spiroplasma</i> on metabolite storage in the fat body by quantifying the amount of triacylglyceride (TAG, the main storage lipid in <i>Drosophila</i>) and glycogen (the main storage carbohydrate in <i>Drosophila</i>). Quantifications of whole female flies (reflecting mainly insect fat body energy storage but also the energy contents of the ovaries) showed a decrease in the amount of TAG in <i>Spiroplasma</i>-infected flies compared to <i>Spiroplasma</i>-uninfected flies (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>), while the amount of glycogen was not affected by the presence of <i>Spiroplasma</i> (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Consistent with the decrease in TAG reserves, 12-day-old <i>Spiroplasma</i>-infected flies succumb more rapidly to acute starvation, in which flies are only given a source of water but no source of nutrition (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5H</a>). Since TAG stored in the fat body largely derived from hemolymph DAG (<a href=\"#bib6\">Canavoso et al., 2001</a>), the decrease of TAG is likely to be the outcome of the depletion of hemolymphatic DAG by <i>Spiroplasma</i>. Thus, our analyses show that the proliferation of <i>Spiroplasma</i> in flies is associated with a specific depletion of hemolymph DAG as well as a decrease in the amount of fat body lipid storage. These findings, together with the observation that DAG is depleted under nutrient deprivation, suggest that DAG availability limits <i>Spiroplasma</i> proliferation."

                                "text": "Since the hemolymph derived from <i>Spiroplasma-</i>infected flies contained <i>Spiroplasma</i> and had reduced DAG, it is likely that <i>Spiroplasma</i> is not directly incorporating DAG into their membrane but rather metabolize DAG into another compound. The main classes of lipids that are present in <i>Spiroplasma</i> are phosphatidylglycerols, sterols, sphingolipids, and cardiolipins (<a href=\"#bib20\">Freeman et al., 1976</a>). Cardiolipins are a class of lipids found exclusively in eubacteria and in the mitochondria of eukaryotic cells (<a href=\"#bib30\">Hawthorne and Ansell, 1982</a>). In contrast to other major lipidic components of <i>Spiroplasma</i> membranes, cardiolipins are not present at detectable levels in the <i>Drosophila</i> hemolymph (<a href=\"#bib7\">Carvalho et al., 2012</a>). Cardiolipins are comprised of four acyl chains, two phosphate groups and three glycerols, and therefore are made up of similar components to DAGs, which consist of two acyl chains and a glycerol. Analysis of the <i>Spiroplasma</i> genome reveals that <i>Spiroplasma</i> is nearly devoid of lipid metabolic capacities but possess genes involved in the synthesis of cardiolipin from the precursor DAG through a pathway involving DAG-3-phosphate and cytidine diphosphate-DAG (unpublished data). To investigate the production of cardiolipin by <i>Spiroplasma</i>, we conducted a MALDI time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-Tof-MS) analysis of lipid species in fly hemolymph and found that there were only peaks at <i>m/z</i> values that correspond to cardiolipin in the hemolymph of flies-harboring <i>Spiroplasma</i> (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). A major ion at <i>m/z</i> 1425.05 was isolated and fragmented, which confirmed the presence of cardiolipin and revealed that the cardiolipins were comprised of C16:0 and C18:1 acyl chains (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). In addition, we used liquid chromatography\u2013tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to quantify the effect of <i>Spiroplasma</i> infection on the concentration of individual DAG species in <i>Drosophila</i> hemolymph. We observed that overall DAG concentration declined by 16.3%, however certain DAG species (e.g., C32:1 and C34:1 DAG) declined to a much greater extent (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). It is notable that DAG species that decline to the greatest extent in the presence of <i>Spiroplasma</i> are those likely to contain (based on <i>Drosophila</i> fatty acid composition) one saturated (e.g., C14:0 or C16:0) and one mono-unsaturated (e.g., C16:1 or C18:1) medium-length acyl chain (<a href=\"#bib62\">Shen et al., 2010</a>). The observation that <i>Spiroplasma</i>-generated cardiolipin contains the same configuration of one saturated and one mono-unsaturated medium-length acyl chain (predominately C16:0, C18:1) indicates that <i>Spiroplasma</i> most likely produce cardiolipin using fly hemolymph DAG. The transformation of DAG into cardiolipin offers an explanation for the observed decrease in hemolymph DAG levels in the presence of <i>Spiroplasma</i>."

Lpp is produced in the fat body but travels to the gut where it gets loaded with lipids prior to trafficking throughout the body (<a href=\"#bib54\">Palm et al., 2012</a>). Lpp is the main hemolymph lipid carrier, since more than 95% of the hemolymph lipids in <i>Drosophila</i> co-fractionate with Lpp (<a href=\"#bib54\">Palm et al., 2012</a>)."

This has the consequence of decreasing the observed levels of stored lipids. To rule out the possibility that <i>Spiroplasma</i> induces the mobilization of lipid stores, which could also decrease TAG levels, we quantified the effect of <i>Spiroplasma</i> on TAG levels in <i>AKHR</i> and <i>Bmm</i> double mutant flies. Adipokinetic hormone receptor (AKHR) and the Brummer lipase (Bmm) are components of two independent pathways that mobilize lipids from <i>Drosophila</i> fat bodies. Signaling through AKHR initiates mobilization of stored lipid in the insect fat body (<a href=\"#bib23\">G\u00e4de and Auerswald, 2003</a>), and Bmm is a TAG lipase involved in mobilization of stored lipid (<a href=\"#bib26\">Gr\u00f6nke et al., 2005</a>). <i>AKHR</i><sup><i>1</i></sup><i>;bmm</i><sup><i>1</i></sup> double mutant flies exhibit an \u2018obese\u2019 phenotype because the fat bodies of these flies store lipids but are not subsequently able to mobilize or release lipids (<a href=\"#bib27\">Gr\u00f6nke et al., 2007</a>).

While we cannot rule out other, as of yet uncharacterized, lipid mobilization pathways that could theoretically be activated by <i>Spiroplasma</i>, these results are still a strong indication that <i>Spiroplasma</i> lipid acquisition most likely occurs in the hemolymph before the point of lipid entry into the fat body stores."

These findings lead us to hypothesize that the proliferation of <i>Spiroplasma</i> could be constrained by the availability of lipids in the hemolymph, which is known to be heavily dependent on the insect nutritional status (<a href=\"#bib6\">Canavoso et al., 2001</a>). To further investigate the lipid-centric metabolic interplay between <i>Spiroplasma</i> and <i>Drosophila,</i> we monitored <i>Spiroplasma</i> proliferation in flies with a reduced capacity for inter-organ lipid transport and hence decreased hemolymph lipid concentrations. A recent study has shown that RNAi-mediated knockdown of <i>Lpp</i> in the fat body resulted in a decrease in circulating lipoprotein particles and a blockage of lipid export from the gut of <i>Drosophila</i> larvae (<a href=\"#bib54\">Palm et al., 2012</a>). Based on these findings, we used a similar RNAi strategy to knockdown <i>Lpp</i> in the fat body of adult flies. In this experiment, we specifically expressed <i>Lpp-RNAi</i> in the fat bodies of adult flies using a flippase-mediated activation strategy (<a href=\"#bib45\">Marois and Eaton, 2007</a>). We established that RNAi-mediated knockdown of <i>Lpp</i> does not significantly decrease the overall levels of protein in the adult hemolymph (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) but does decrease adult hemolymph-lipids, as shown by quantification of hemolymph DAG and sterol (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A,B</a>). We then investigated the effect of this lipid reduction on the <i>Drosophila\u2013Spiroplasma</i> interaction. We found that under conditions of <i>Lpp</i> knockdown, <i>Spiroplasma</i> proliferation was severely inhibited resulting in lower <i>Spiroplasma</i> titers in flies after 14, 21, and 28 days of aging (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>). To rule out any possibility that the genetic background of <i>Lpp-RNAi</i> flies was causing the observed decrease in <i>Spiroplasma</i> titers, we quantified <i>Spiroplasma</i> titers in the absence of activation of <i>Lpp-RNAi</i> by heat-shock and found no significant difference between flies containing the <i>Lpp-RNAi</i> construct and those that did not (<a href=\"#fig8s2\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). In addition, we used an independent <i>Lpp-RNAi</i> construct with another fat body specific driver and activation strategy to confirm that the decrease in <i>Spiroplasma</i> titers was specifically caused by RNAi-mediated <i>Lpp</i> knockdown (<a href=\"#fig8s2\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). It is noteworthy that <i>Spiroplasmas</i> are not known to have the capacity to utilize proteins as nutrient sources (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chang and Chen, 1983</a>), supporting the claim that lipids carried by Lpp (and not the Lpp protein itself) are the factors required for the proliferation of <i>Spiroplasma</i>. Another striking effect of the RNAi-mediated knockdown of <i>Lpp</i> was strongly diminished <i>Spiroplasma</i>-induced old age mortality (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a>)."

If the proliferation rate of <i>Spiroplasma</i> were to be determined by metabolites that do not decline under nutrient-limiting conditions, for example sugars and L-amino acids, then <i>Spiroplasma</i> proliferation would not be limited under host nutritional deprivation.

For example, we might expect a striking decrease in reproductive output or survival, which was not observed for <i>Spiroplasma</i>-infected flies maintained on a nutrient poor diet. We only observed that mated flies-harboring <i>Spiroplasma</i> had increased mortality after about 7 days under nutrient-limiting conditions, and this is not likely to have a major impact on host fitness since increased mortality occurred after the production of eggs had stopped."

We observed that <i>Spiroplasma</i> specifically depleted host DAG species that contained one saturated and one mono-unsaturated acyl chain, which was also the most abundant acyl chain configuration in <i>Spiroplasma</i>-produced cardiolipin (which contained C16:0 and C18:1 acyl chains). The basis of this acyl chain specificity is not known, but it could be linked to biophysical properties of cardiolipins in the highly curved <i>Spiroplasma</i> membrane. The utilization of DAG as a precursor for cardiolipin synthesis is supported by the annotation of the <i>Spiroplasma</i> genome (unpublished data), which enabled the identification of a biosynthetic pathway similar to that described in <i>Mycoplasma synoviae</i> and <i>Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae</i> for the synthesis of cardiolipin from acylglycerols through DAG-3-phosphate and cytidine diphosphate-DAG (<a href=\"#bib4\">Arraes et al., 2007</a>). A number of studies have demonstrated links between cardiolipin and cell death (<a href=\"#bib24\">Gonzalvez and Gottlieb, 2007</a>), which raise the possibility that cardiolipin produced by <i>Spiroplasma</i> could be involved in its pathological effects in old flies."

Amongst bacteria, this requirement for sterol is unique to mollicutes (<a href=\"#bib9\">Dahl, 1993</a>). Since insects are auxotrophic for sterols (<a href=\"#bib6\">Canavoso et al., 2001</a>), their concentrations are determined by dietary uptake. Although it is therefore possible that the sterol availability could play a key role in coordinating <i>Spiroplasma</i> proliferation with host nutritional state, we were unable to recover normal <i>Spiroplasma</i> proliferation rates when flies were maintained on nutrient poor media complemented with sterol (unpublished data). This finding suggests that, while sterol might be important for <i>Spiroplasma</i> proliferation, it is not sufficient to induce proliferation under conditions of nutrient limitation."

This mechanism could be important for the controlling proliferation of diverse extracellular endosymbionts. Different mechanisms are likely to be involved in intracellular endosymbiont control. For example, proliferation and localization of the obligate <i>Sitophilus</i> primary endosymbiont (SPE) is controlled by the expression of a specific antimicrobial peptide from its host, <i>Sitophilus</i> weevils (<a href=\"#bib43\">Login et al., 2011</a>).

Many of these pathogens are free-living and are likely to have retained well-developed metabolic capacities (including the capacity to synthesize lipids).

RNAi-mediated knockdown of <i>Lpp</i> was achieved using a pFRiPE-mediated inducible RNAi element (<a href=\"#bib45\">Marois and Eaton, 2007</a>), placed in the presence of a heat-shock inducible flippase and an <i>Adh-GAL-4</i> driver that is mostly active in the fat body. The strategy and stocks used are analogous to a previously published study, except that we induced RNAi in adults, as opposed to larvae (<a href=\"#bib54\">Palm et al., 2012</a>). We induced the flippase by heat-shock (1.5 hr at 37\u00b0C in a water bath) in 4- to 5-day-old adult flies. This results in the excision of an upstream spacer region and activation of the UAS-<i>Lpp-RNAi</i> construct driven by <i>Adh-GAL-4</i> and the silencing of <i>Lpp</i> in the fat body, specifically at the adult stage. An additional strategy used to knockdown the expression of <i>Lpp</i> involved the <i>C564-GAL-4</i> driver (also mostly active in the fat body) in conjunction with <i>tubulin-gal80ts,</i> a temperature-sensitive repressor of <i>GAL-4</i> expression, which blocks GAL-4 expression at 18\u00b0C but not 29\u00b0C (<a href=\"#bib47\">McGuire et al., 2003</a>). Flies that contained both the <i>C564-GAL-4, tubulin-gal80ts,</i> and UAS-<i>Lpp-RNAi(46)</i> elements were maintained at 18\u00b0C and then shifted to 29\u00b0C as adults to induce UAS-<i>Lpp-RNAi(46)</i> and knockdown <i>Lpp</i> expression<i>.</i> The UAS-<i>Lpp-RNAi(46)</i> stock is TRiP #HM05157 originating from the transgenic RNAi project at the Harvard Medical School. Since <i>Spiroplasma MSRO</i> is vertically transmitted and kills male embryos, <i>Spiroplasma</i>-infected stocks were generated in several steps: (1) Crossing an infected <i>OR</i><sup><i>R</i></sup> female with males carrying appropriate balancer chromosomes (2) Crossing the balanced female progeny with males of the genotype of interest (either <i>w;AKHR;Bmm</i>, <i>w,HS-FLP;adh-GAL-4/bcg</i> or <i>Dipt-GFP,C564-GAL-4;tub-GAL80ts</i>) (3) Several back-crosses were then carried out, resulting in a homozygous <i>Spiroplasma</i>-infected female with the appropriate genotype. These stocks were then maintained by crossing females with non-infected males of the same genotype. <i>Spiroplasma</i>-infected females carrying a <i>GAL-4</i> construct were then crossed with males carrying <i>UAS-RNAi</i> constructs or controls (<i>w</i> background). All flies were maintained at 25\u00b0C unless otherwise specified. The density of animals per vial was equilibrated between <i>Spiroplasma</i>-infected and <i>Spiroplasma</i>-uninfected stocks for development under similar levels of larval competition. Unless otherwise specified, all flies used were females and virgins. For survival experiments, counts were made every 24 hr and flies were transferred to new tubes every 3\u20134 days (2 days for mated flies). Climbing assays were carried out as described (<a href=\"#bib5\">Barone and Bohmann, 2013</a>). Acute starvation assays have been described previously (<a href=\"#bib27\">Gr\u00f6nke et al., 2007</a>). To quantify the number of eggs laid, flies were collected immediately post-eclosion and maintained in individual <i>Drosophila</i> vials that each contained five flies. Eggs were counted every 48 hr over a 14-day period, and the number of eggs laid per 48 hr per fly was calculated (correcting for any fly mortality). For experiments that required mated flies, males (three for every five females) were placed in the <i>Drosophila</i> vials and then removed after 7 days, males that died prior to this were replaced."

If symbionts become ever denser until the fly dies at an old age, it's hard to argue that titer is adaptively regulated to optimize a tradeoff between host fitness and symbiont transmission (as hypothesized). It would appear instead that they start at a low titer and are expanding as the fly ages but never reaching their \u201climit\u201d imposed by the DAG levels. Or maybe the point is that such a limit is only imposed on poor diets. On these, it does appear that the titers level off.

If there are not enough lipids around to sustain oogenesis, will the parasite titer remain low so as to benefit should conditions ultimately improve?

We also found very low levels of DAG in these older flies (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2013figure supplement 1</a>) and therefore our data is consistent with a DAG mediated limitation of <i>Spiroplasma</i> proliferation in old flies. As such, we have identified a second condition where reduced <i>Spiroplasma</i> proliferation coincides with reduced hemolymph DAG. We note that this late reduction of <i>Spiroplasma</i> proliferation does not appear to be a very effective control strategy, since there is high mortality of flies over this period. The MSRO strain of <i>Spiroplasma</i> used in this study achieves titers higher than most all other <i>Drosophila</i> endosymbiotic <i>Spiroplasmas</i> (<a href=\"#bib29\">Haselkorn et. al., 2013</a>) and therefore we suggest that old age regulation might be \u201ctoo little too late\u201d in this case, but could play a more important role for some other <i>Spiroplasma</i> strains.

For the 35 day timepoint, we did however specifically separate flies that appeared to be very close to dying and those that were in an apparently much more healthy state and there was no significant difference between the two (data not shown)."

If there are not enough lipids around to sustain oogenesis, will the parasite titer remain low so as to benefit should conditions ultimately improve? Clearly, it would be essential to monitor egg production as well as parasite transmission under these nutrient-poor conditions (which might be actually too harsh given the premature death of flies; flies given only a sucrose diet live much longer), and not just parasite titer and host longevity. Of note, even virgin females do lay eggs after a few days. These represent also a loss of lipids.

We note that these effects on egg production are probably not underlying many of the principal effects of <i>Spiroplasma</i> infection characterized in this paper. Notably mated flies (<i>Spiroplasma</i>-infected and uninfected) produced equivalent numbers of eggs over 2 weeks and yet we still observe a decrease in lifespan and hemolymph DAG in these flies in the presence of <i>Spiroplasma</i> (as was previously shown with virgin flies). The experiments on egg production also support our original conclusions (based on survivals) that <i>Spiroplasma</i> has rather minor detrimental effects (and indeed under some conditions possibly positive effects) on host fitness. Endosymbiont titers have been linked to transmission efficiency, and therefore (as suggested by the reviewer) one could speculate that the decrease in <i>Spiroplasma</i> titers under nutrient deprivation could have effects on <i>Spiroplasma</i> transmission. While interesting, investigating this under our experimental conditions was not feasible because so few eggs were laid per fly under conditions of nutrient deprivation. It is also notable that in mated flies, where more eggs were laid under nutrient poor conditions, the production of eggs stopped after 4-6 days and the decline in <i>Spiroplasma</i> titers under nutrient deprivation are only observed after 8 days. If transmission were to decline after 8 days on nutrient poor media, then the early increase in egg production induced by <i>Spiroplasma</i> under these conditions would make evolutionary sense. We also quantified <i>Spiroplasma</i> titers in virgins and mated flies after 14 days on rich media and found no significant difference (unpublished data). This would suggest that Spiroplasma titers are not directly linked to the rate of egg production (since virgins lay many fewer eggs that mated flies)."
