Recent studies report that mice lacking glucagon receptor (<i>Gcgr<sup>-/-</sup></i>) do not develop diabetes following streptozotocin (STZ)-mediated ablation of insulin-producing \u03b2-cells. Here, we show that diabetes prevention in STZ-treated <i>Gcgr<sup>-/-</sup></i> animals requires remnant insulin action originating from spared residual \u03b2-cells: these mice indeed became hyperglycemic after insulin receptor blockade. Accordingly, <i>Gcgr<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice developed hyperglycemia after induction of a more complete, diphtheria toxin (DT)-induced \u03b2-cell loss, a situation of near-absolute insulin deficiency similar to type 1 diabetes. In addition, glucagon deficiency did not impair the natural capacity of ncy did not impair the natural capacity \u03b1-cells to reprogram into insulin production after extreme \u03b2-cell loss. \u03b1-to-\u03b2-cell conversion was improved in <i>Gcgr<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice as a consequence of \u03b1-cell hyperplasia. Collectively, these results indicate that glucagon antagonism could i) be a useful adjuvant therapy in diabetes only when residual insulin action persists, and ii) help devising future \u03b2-cell regeneration therapies relying upon \u03b1-cell reprogramming."
