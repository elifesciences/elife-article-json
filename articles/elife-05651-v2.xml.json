They adjust emitted sound intensity, auditory sensitivity and click rate to target range, and terminate prey pursuits with high-repetition-rate, low-intensity buzzes. However, their narrow acoustic field of view (FOV) is considered stable throughout target approach, which could facilitate prey escape at close-range. Here, we show that, like some bats, harbour porpoises can broaden their biosonar beam during the terminal phase of attack but, unlike bats, maintain the ability to change beamwidth within this phase. Based on video, MRI, and acoustic-tag recordings, we propose this flexibility is modulated by the melon and implemented to accommodate dynamic spatial relationships with prey and acoustic complexity of surroundings. Despite independent evolution and different means of sound generation and transmission, whales and bats adaptively change their FOV, suggesting that beamwidth flexibility has been an important driver in the evolution of echolocation for prey tracking."

They adjust emitted sound intensity, auditory sensitivity and click rate to target range, and terminate prey pursuits with high-repetition-rate, low-intensity buzzes. However, their narrow acoustic field of view (FOV) is considered stable throughout target approach, which could facilitate prey escape at close-range. Here, we show that, like some bats, harbour porpoises can broaden their biosonar beam during the terminal phase of attack but, unlike bats, maintain the ability to change beamwidth within this phase. Based on video, MRI, and acoustic-tag recordings, we propose this flexibility is modulated by the melon and implemented to accommodate dynamic spatial relationships with prey and acoustic complexity of surroundings. Despite independent evolution and different means of sound generation and transmission, whales and bats adaptively change their FOV, suggesting that beamwidth flexibility has been an important driver in the evolution of echolocation for prey tracking."

Bats hunt in the dark with little light to allow them to see the insects they chase. Porpoises hunt in murky water where different ocean environments can quickly obscure fish from view. So, both bats and porpoises evolved to emit a beam of sound and then track their prey based on the echoes of that sound bouncing off the prey and other objects. This process is called echolocation."

The sound is transmitted through a fatty structure on the front of their head known as the melon, which gives these animals their characteristic round-headed look, before being transmitted into the sea. Porpoises would also likely benefit from widening their echolocation beam as they approach prey, but it was not clear if and how they could do this."

This revealed that in the last stage of their approach, the porpoises could triple the area their sound beam covered, giving them a \u2018wide angle view\u2019 as they closed in. This widening of the sound beam occurred during a very rapid series of echolocation signals called a buzz, which porpoises and bats perform at the end of a pursuit. Unlike bats, porpoises are able to continue to change the width of their sound beam throughout the buzz."

However, only toothed whales (henceforth \u2018whales\u2019) and laryngeally echolocating bats (henceforth \u2018bats\u2019) use echolocation to detect, locate, and track prey. In these groups, echolocation signals are primarily ultrasonic (&gt;20 kHz) and are among the most intense biological sounds in water and in air (<a href=\"#bib36\">Madsen and Surlykke, 2013</a>). These characteristics mean that in uncluttered spaces these predators can detect small prey many body-lengths ahead of them. Key to increasing the effective sensory range of biosonar is a directional sound beam (i.e., a narrow volume of forwardly ensonified space), which increases intensity along the acoustic axis and reduces ensonification of objects off-axis. It has recently been proposed that the advantages of a narrow sonar beam while in search of prey may have been the primary driver for the evolution of high frequency sonar signals in both whales and bats (<a href=\"#bib30\">Koblitz et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Jakobsen et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Madsen and Surlykke, 2013</a>)."

Both groups terminate prey pursuits with a low intensity, high repetition rate sequence of echolocation signals called a buzz (see ref. [<a href=\"#bib36\">Madsen and Surlykke, 2013</a>] for review). Signal production rates characteristic of buzzes have likely evolved in these echolocators to facilitate close range prey tracking. However, for a given sonar beam, effective beam diameter will decrease as the distance between predator and prey diminishes. Thus, while a directional sound beam enables longer detection range by restricting the acoustic field of view (FOV), it may be disadvantageous to the echolocator at short ranges, as moving prey may easily vanish at the periphery of the FOV. Directionality increases with aperture size (e.g., a bat's gape) and signal frequency (<a href=\"#bib10\">Au, 1993</a>) and both factors appear to be exploited by some bats to modify their beam (<a href=\"#bib48\">Surlykke et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Jakobsen and Surlykke, 2010</a>)."

Instead, whales have evolved specialized sound-producing structures, the phonic lips, located high in the blowhole (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). An echolocation click is generated by pneumatic actuation of the phonic lips as pressurized air is forced past them (<a href=\"#bib12\">Cranford et al., 1996</a>). The resulting sound pulse propagates into the fatty melon and is transmitted into the water as a directional beam (<a href=\"#bib3\">Au et al., 1986</a>).

Data from the two porpoises, Freja and Eigil, recorded during buzzes show that they could up to triple the width of their sonar beam as they approached prey (median difference of 7.85\u00b0 for four trials: from a mean of 12.9\u00b0 (6.6\u00b0\u201330.5\u00b0, with the large beamwidths produced at short target ranges, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>) during regular clicking (ICI &gt;13 ms; [<a href=\"#bib51\">Wisniewska et al., 2012</a>]) to 19.3\u00b0 (10.2\u00b0\u201328.9\u00b0) during buzzes (ICI \u226413 ms; [<a href=\"#bib51\">Wisniewska et al., 2012</a>]), <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>).

Only trials in which the porpoise swam directly toward the target (within \u00b115\u00b0 vertically and horizontally from the array's center) and repeatedly scanned its beam over the center hydrophone were analyzed. This resulted in 11 trials for the long-range- and 4 trials for the short-range array configuration. For each recorded click, the energy levels received at the hydrophones were fitted to the beam pattern of a circular piston (<a href=\"#bib4\">Au et al., 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">M\u00f8hl et al., 2003</a>). Only beamwidth estimates based on fits with R<sup>2</sup> &gt; 0.8 (see <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) were considered in the analysis, rendering a total of 34 and 458 clicks for the long-range- and short-range array, respectively. The results of this experiment show that the porpoise could almost double its beamwidth in degrees when switching to a buzz (ICI \u226413 ms; [<a href=\"#bib51\">Wisniewska et al., 2012</a>]) at short target ranges (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). That is, from a mean half-power beamwidth (i.e., the off-axis angle at which the sound energy has decreased by 3 dB relative to the on-axis energy) of 9.1\u00b0 (6.7\u201312.3) to a maximum of 15.1\u00b0 (mean = 11.0, min = 8.2). In this way the animal increased the ensonified area ahead of it by up to three times (200%) in the terminal buzz phase of its approach to a target, as indicated by the ratio of the area measured at a given target range to the area predicted for that range based on the median \u22123 dB beam angle calculated for long ranges (i.e., predicted area had the porpoise not switched to \u2018wide-angle view\u2019, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). A significant inverse relationship between the beamwidth of the clicks and distance they were emitted from the target was found for data sets from each experiment (Experiment 1: <i>F</i> = 56.9, <i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.44, p &lt; 0.001; Experiment 2: <i>F</i> = 23.6, <i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.05, p &lt; 0.001). Data from experiment two were also analyzed using ANOVA (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). The three clusters (sorted using beamwidth values) differed significantly with respect to distance to target (F = 5.21, p &lt; 0.006). Specifically, clicks in the group with the greatest beamwidths were emitted significantly closer to the target than clicks in the group with the narrowest beamwidths (Tukey-Karmer HSD, p &lt; 0.01)."

The scanning images reveal nasal structures that include a complex, richly innervated (<a href=\"#bib21\">Huggenberger et al., 2009</a>) network of facial muscles (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). These muscles are homologous to the muscles dedicated to facial expressions in primates, and should enable fast and subtle changes in the shape of nasal components and their associated air sacs (<a href=\"#bib21\">Huggenberger et al., 2009</a>)."

At its broadest, the beamwidth ranged from 15\u00b0 in experiment two to more than 30\u00b0 in experiment one. A number of factors may have contributed to this variability including: (i) differences in effective angular resolution (EAR) between the eight-hydrophone linear array and the 48-hydrophone star-shaped array, (ii) differences in the animals' behaviour when approaching a slowly sinking fish vs a stationary aluminum sphere, and, finally, (iii) potentially higher clutter originating from the large array behind the target and motivating the porpoise to use a narrower beam. Porpoises can adjust their buzz clicking rate to prey range differently when following a fish in open water than when tracking one in the cluttered and more restricted space close to the sea floor (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). The porpoise behaviour and experimental context seem the most likely explanation for the observed differences between the two experiments."

This control is achieved independently of spectral adjustments (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), probably by changing the conformation of the melon (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>; [<a href=\"#bib21\">Huggenberger et al., 2009</a>]), the position of the phonic lips (<a href=\"#bib13\">Cranford et al., 2014</a>) and the size and shape of the associated air sacs (<a href=\"#bib1\">Aroyan et al., 1992</a>). Due to its heterogeneous structure (<a href=\"#bib43\">Norris and Harvey, 1974</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Varanasi et al., 1975</a>), the melon has long been considered an acoustic impedance matcher that minimizes the reflections and energy loss at the tissue\u2013water interface (<a href=\"#bib43\">Norris and Harvey, 1974</a>) and that provides directionality in the emitted click (<a href=\"#bib6\">Au et al., 1999</a>, <a href=\"#bib7\">2006</a>). Porpoises have a complex facial musculature (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>) with nervous innervation with 4.5 times more neurons than human facial muscles (<a href=\"#bib22\">Jacobs and Jensen, 1964</a>), leading to the recent proposition that muscle induced deformations of the nasal soft structures such as the melon may provide means to change the FOV (<a href=\"#bib21\">Huggenberger et al., 2009</a>). Our acoustic measurements and observations support that hypothesis by demonstrating that the melon and accessory structures apparently operate as the functional equivalent of an adjustable collimating lens of a flashlight. In other words, the porpoise's beam can be dynamically changed from spotlight to floodlight (and everything in between) to best suit the circumstances, offering unprecedented flexibility in control of the FOV in an echolocating animal that is unmatched in visual mammals (<a href=\"#bib33\">Land and Nilsson, 2012</a>)."

Thus in bats, changes in FOV, emission rate, and signal frequency content during the buzz appear to be tightly interconnected (<a href=\"#bib45\">Ratcliffe et al., 2013</a>). Our results show that in whales these parameters are independently controlled (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Having a FOV that can be modulated independently of signal emission rate or frequency content (the latter often being dependent on the amplitude of the signal [<a href=\"#bib5\">Au et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Finneran et al., 2014</a>]) may be essential for managing flow of sensory information and optimizing long duration close-range prey tracking in acoustic scenes of varying complexity (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). The broad beam is advantageous to the porpoises at close range where it would reduce the likelihood of prey escaping perpendicularly to the approaching porpoise by vanishing from its acoustic FOV."

This suggests that beam plasticity has been a key driver in the evolution of echolocation, beyond simple orientation, for improved foraging success. Our results from these small toothed whales suggest that the demands of tracking moving prey over variable distances in complex acoustic environments have favored the evolution of a more sophisticated adjustment mechanism, in which pulse rate and beamwidth can be controlled independently. Compared to bats, the greater dynamic beam plasticity we have observed here likely reflects different sensory and ecological constraints. We propose that dynamic control of acoustic FOV in whales is a mechanism for the inclusion and exclusion of potential sensory information that allows these predators to quickly and repeatedly adjust to changes in habitat and prey trajectories."

We localized the animal at the time of each emission using hydrophone arrival-time differences (<a href=\"#bib37\">Madsen and Wahlberg, 2007</a>). Porpoise positions were then verified with the synchronized videos. For each click, the time of maximum sound pressure on each hydrophone was identified, and the energy density of the signal was measured using a window of 30 \u00b5s before and 90 \u00b5s after the peak of the signal envelope. Such a window corresponds to the duration of a typical porpoise signal. Assuming spherical spreading, the apparent source level (ASL) (<a href=\"#bib37\">Madsen and Wahlberg, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Finneran et al., 2014</a>) was calculated from the recorded level (computed as energy flux density in a fixed window [peak-30 \u00b5s\u2014peak +90 \u00b5s]) and the range. For a click to be included in the analysis its ratio of signal energy to the immediately preceding noise energy had to exceed 6 dB on all channels, and the maximum ASL should not have occurred on one of the outermost hydrophones. Radiation plots were created by plotting the ASLs against their respective angles relative to the estimated on-axis direction. First, the peak amplitude and angle were adjusted by interpolating between the peak ASL and the ASLs from the two neighbouring hydrophones using Lagrange interpolation (<a href=\"#bib39\">Menne and Hackbarth, 1986</a>). All off-axis levels were then plotted as a function of the off-axis angle. The resulting transmission beam pattern was interpolated to a grid of 0.1\u00b0.

All subsequent sound analyses were performed using Matlab. Clicks from the study animal were identified in the DTAG-3 acoustic recordings using a supervised click detector. Spectral cues were used to eliminate occasional misdetections of echoes or signals from other porpoises in the neighbouring pen. Echograms were formed from the sounds recorded with the DTAG-3. Only trials with clear echoes from the target and the array were submitted to further analysis. Clicks from 13\u201321 key hydrophones of the large- and small star-shaped array were extracted using a supervised click detector with the synchronized timing of the clicks recorded on the animal as an input. Clicks from all the verified channels were then combined into a single template and used for automatic click detection on the remaining channels. For each click, we identified a subset of channels with peak received levels exceeding the rms noise level of the channel by at least 14 dB. We calculated click energy in a fixed window (peak-30 \u00b5s\u2014peak +90 \u00b5s) on each of the selected channels, fitted a surface to the values using the Matlab \u2018gridfit\u2019 function with grid spacing of 0.5 cm and determined the location of the beam axis as the peak of the fitted surface (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, upper panels). We ran a series of computer simulations of our methods applied to virtual sources of known piston sizes to evaluate the influence of (i) an animal's bearing in azimuth and elevation and (ii) beam axis displacement relative to the centre of the array on the beamwidth measurement error. Based on the results of these simulations, we restricted our analysis to only include clicks emitted when the porpoise was swimming directly toward the target (within \u00b115\u00b0 vertically and horizontally from the array's centre) and with beam axis within (i) \u00b112 cm from the array centre for the large array, (ii) \u00b18 cm for clicks recorded with the small array and produced up to 1 s before the start of buzz, and (iii) \u00b16 cm for clicks made 1 s before buzz and onwards until the end of the target approach. The estimated error was thereby limited to \u2264\u00b10.5\u00b0."

(2010)</a> to fit the energy levels received at the hydrophones to the beam pattern of a circular piston that fulfilled the following criteria: (i) it was at the same range to the array as the porpoise emitting the click, (ii) it was centered on the estimated beam axis and (iii) it transmitted the click recorded on the hydrophone closest to that axis. Given that the orientation of the porpoise relative to the array was constantly changing as the animal was approaching the target (<a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>), the beam pattern was assumed to be rotationally symmetrical around the acoustic axis. Furthermore, this assumption allowed us to utilize information from all hydrophones fulfilling the signal-to-noise ratio criterion to find the best fitting aperture. We carried out a Monte Carlo simulation using theoretical piston transducers with diameters of 1/3 to 3 times 8.3 cm (i.e., the best fitting vertical equivalent aperture in [<a href=\"#bib30\">Koblitz et al., 2012</a>]) in 0.1 cm increments, and the circular piston model of <a href=\"#bib4\">Au et al. (1987)</a>. The diameter of the piston that matched the data best was found by means of a non-linear least-squares method (see <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Only fits with R<sup>2</sup> &gt; 0.8 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>) were kept for final analysis, from which the \u22123 dB beamwidth and the equivalent piston radius were extracted."

This unique setting approximates what this shallow-water predator might encounter in its natural surroundings. The tags recorded the whale's echolocation clicks as well as echoes from the fish and other objects and surfaces in the whale's surroundings (e.g., water surface and sea floor). The recorded sounds were used to form stack plots, or echograms, of sound envelopes synchronized to the outgoing click as in echosounder images (<a href=\"#bib26\">Johnson et al., 2004</a>). These allowed us to follow movements of the echolocator and its prey in the environment (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). The time delay between the echolocation click and the echo, multiplied by one-half of the sound speed (1500 m/s was assumed) gives the distance to the target. Delays to the surface and bottom echoes approximate the animal's depth and altitude above the sea floor, respectively. Time delays between different echo groups represent their relative proximity."

In addition, you state \u201cthat harbor porpoises broaden their biosonar beam by &gt;50% in the terminal phase\u201d, but that is not a fair summary of the results, showing very little broadening on average. You should say \u201charbor porpoises can broaden their\u2026\u201d, to report the results objectively."

The most important result described in the Abstract is that \u201cporpoises broaden their sonar beam by &gt;50%\u201d while the results of experiment 2 state: \u201cthe porpoise could almost double its beamwidth at short target ranges (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>) from a median half-power beamwidth of 9\u00b0 (6.6-11.8) to a maximum of 15\u00b0 (median = 10.8, min = 7.4).\u201d So, is the difference 50%, as the Abstract says, or 200% as the Results say? I assume that this does not refer to experiment 1, as the authors state \u201cthe relatively large hydrophone spacing in this experiment\u2026 prevented us from drawing strong conclusions about the exact extent of beam widening.\u201d The comparison in the Results of experiment 2 is inexplicably between a median and a maximum. If you compare the two median values, 9\u00b0 (6.6-11.8) to 10.8\u00b0 (7.4-15), I am not at all convinced that there even is a significant difference. If the paper wants to reach conclusions about changes in beamwidth with distance to target or stages of capture, then it needs a valid statistical comparison of the two distributions. Since the goal is to test whether the porpoise changes FOV adaptively during prey interception, then I think the test should be organized using each approach as the basic unit of analysis. <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a> merges data from different approaches, and even totally different receiver set-ups. The actual analysis of adaptive changing of FOV during interception should only test for changes in FOV within each approach. The prediction should be that beamwidth expands as porpoise closes on prey."

While it shows two examples relating ICI, bandwidth, and center frequency in the context of time from start of buzz, this figure does not actually show a clear analysis that beamwidth is independent of frequency. This requires a statistical test of this point, perhaps against a physical model of how beamwidth would change with fc for a simple static transducer. A plot of beamwidth against fc would also help."

What most animals can do is to move the FOV around by either moving the eyes or the head to effectively increase the search volume, but toothed whales can do that too by moving their head around.

We have data currently in press in Journal of Experimental Biology (Jensen et al.) using a transducer mimicking porpoise clicks and beam patterns and recorded with a linear array showing that with a similar array geometry and an angular resolution of 6\u00b0 it is possible to achieve beam measurements with sub-degree precision, so using an interpolation step of 0.1\u00b0 on the data of this manuscript does not seem that unrealistic."

Our intention was therefore to use this figure to demonstrate that when buzzing in a natural context porpoises can move through acoustic scenes of different complexities. While echograms have been published for beaked whales chasing prey, no such literature currently exists for harbour porpoises."
