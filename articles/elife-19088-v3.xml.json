The approach relies on an improved technique for nonsense suppression with in vitro misacylated orthogonal tRNA. The data show that Cy-ncAAs (based on Cy3 and Cy5) are tolerated by the eukaryotic ribosome in cell-free and whole-cell environments and can be incorporated into soluble and membrane proteins. In the context of the <i>Xenopus laevis</i> oocyte expression system, this technique yields ion channels with encoded Cy-ncAAs that are trafficked to the plasma membrane where they display robust function and distinct fluorescent signals as detected by TIRF microscopy. This is the first demonstration of an encoded cyanine dye as a ncAA in a eukaryotic expression system and opens the door for the analysis of proteins with single-molecule resolution in a cellular environment."

The approach relies on an improved technique for nonsense suppression with in vitro misacylated orthogonal tRNA. The data show that Cy-ncAAs (based on Cy3 and Cy5) are tolerated by the eukaryotic ribosome in cell-free and whole-cell environments and can be incorporated into soluble and membrane proteins. In the context of the <i>Xenopus laevis</i> oocyte expression system, this technique yields ion channels with encoded Cy-ncAAs that are trafficked to the plasma membrane where they display robust function and distinct fluorescent signals as detected by TIRF microscopy. This is the first demonstration of an encoded cyanine dye as a ncAA in a eukaryotic expression system and opens the door for the analysis of proteins with single-molecule resolution in a cellular environment."

A common strategy to incorporate fluorophores into target proteins is the fusion to fluorescent proteins, such as GFP or one of its spectral variants (<a href=\"#bib32\">Miranda et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Zachariassen et al., 2016</a>). This approach has the built-in convenience of encoding but their positioning within the target protein can be limited by their large size, which may impact protein function or trafficking. Alternatively, post-translational chemical labeling with compact fluorescent dyes through reactive side-chains (Cys, Lys) or with bio-orthogonal labeling allows for the use of more diverse fluorophores and experimental applications (<a href=\"#bib31\">Mannuzzu et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Cha and Bezanilla, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Priest et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Debets et al., 2013</a>). Nonetheless, Cys- or Lys-labeling in live cells is limited to extracellular residues and often results in a substantial background signal due to native reactive residues of the cell. This shortcoming is further limiting when labelling side-chains in eukaryotic membrane proteins which can have many \u2018background\u2019 cysteine residues, that when mutated can lower expression profiles or have functional consequences. Bio-orthogonal labeling is advantageous in this respect (i.e. reduced off-target labeling, increased specificity) but requires that the residues or regions for modification are chemically accessible. Fluorescent non-canonical amino acids (ncAA) present a solution to these drawbacks as they are relatively small, and theoretically, can be encoded at any site within the protein in cellular and cell-free environments (<a href=\"#bib53\">Turcatti et al., 1996</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib10\">Cohen et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Zhang et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Summerer et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Wang et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Kajihara et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Pantoja et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Kalstrup and Blunck, 2013</a>). However, of the available encodable fluorophores, most are excited by near UV light, a spectroscopic property that leads to competing cellular fluorescence, and have limited, if any, utility for single-molecule studies e.g. they have very short fluorescence lifetimes."

However, a structure represents a snapshot of a single conformation, yet proteins constantly cycle though various states, all of which have the potential to be functionally significant. Therefore, although high-resolution protein structures are becoming more commonplace, assigning functional correlates remains a significant challenge. This is true especially for eukaryotic membrane proteins, many of which cannot be easily produced in biochemical scales and for which expression in a live cell is a prerequisite, e.g. as is the case for many voltage-gated plasma-membrane channels. Thus, there is a growing general need for improved encoded fluorescent reporters, ideally those that are well suited to single-molecule studies and are applicable to eukaryotic expression systems."

We first report a synthetic approach for the production of orthogonal misacylated tRNAs that carry a Cy-ncAA. The tolerance of the eukaryotic ribosome for these fluorophores is demonstrated in a eukaryotic cell-free protein expression system with a novel luciferase rescue assay. We then show in Xenopus oocytes that these Cy-dye-based optical probes (Cy3, Cy5 and the self-healing Cy3 variant LD550) can be incorporated into membrane proteins (providing two examples: a chloride ion channel and a voltage-gated sodium channel auxiliary subunit). These proteins were properly folded, functional and trafficked to the plasma membrane, albeit in reduced levels compared to wild-type channels. TIRF microscopy was then used to obtain single-molecule images from cells expressing membrane proteins containing Cy3 and Cy5, further confirming that the encoding is successful."

Briefly, a free primary amine containing amino acid, such as para-amino-L-phenylalanine (AF), is chemically conjugated to the dinucleotide phospho-desoxy-cytosine phospho-adenosine (short pCA) and subsequently reacted with a commercially available Cy dye succinimide ester under acidic conditions to ensure selective labeling of the para-amino group (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>; <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplements 1</a>\u2013<a href=\"#fig1s4\">4</a>).

Surprisingly, the standard ligation conditions (37\u00b0C, 40 min) used for nonsense suppression by our lab and others (<a href=\"#bib36\">Pantoja et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Pless et al., 2013</a>, <a href=\"#bib39\">2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Nowak et al., 1998</a>) resulted in relatively poor tRNA acylation yields with Cy-ncAAs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). We reasoned that this low ligation efficiency could, in part, be due to hydrolysis of the Cy-ncAA from the tRNA occurring during the enzymatic ligation reaction at 37\u00b0C; hydrolysis is a highly temperature sensitive process (<a href=\"#bib49\">Stepanov and Nyborg, 2002</a>). This possibility was tested by performing the misacylation reaction at a lower temperature (4\u00b0C). The incubation time was increased (to 2, 5 or 11 hr) to overcome the reduced enzymatic activity of the RNA ligase induced by the lower temperature. This approach identified conditions at 4\u00b0C for 2 hr with higher ligation efficiencies: 68\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010.2% for Cy3-ncAA and 79\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.5% for Cy5-ncAA (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). The results for ligations at 4\u00b0C, 5 hr were not significantly different from samples obtained after 2 hr (Cy3: p=0.76; Cy5: p=0.08) and the acylation efficiency decreased significantly after an incubation time of 11 hr. Consequently, for the following experiments, all tRNA acylation reactions were done at 4\u00b0C for 2 hr. These acylation yields were also confirmed by HPLC where Cy3 and Cy5 ligation reactions were similar and displayed high (&gt;80%) acylated yields (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). However, the HPLC purified tRNA fraction diminished the yield, roughly 10% of the starting material, resulting in amounts that were insufficient for proper experimental validation. Hence, non-HPLC purified aminoacylated tRNA were employed for all subsequent non-sense suppression experiments."

An amber (TAG) version of the high-activity NanoLuc, a small luciferase subunit from the deep-sea shrimp <i>Oplophorus gracilirostris</i> (<a href=\"#bib18\">Hall et al., 2012</a>), was generated by inserting the amber stop codon TAG between Gyl159 and Val160 and named NanoLuc Amber. A pyrrolysine tRNA from <i>Methanosarcina mazei</i> (PylT) was chosen for nonsense suppression given that it has been shown to be orthogonal in eukaryotic cells (<a href=\"#bib18\">Hall et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Mukai et al., 2008</a>); however, to our knowledge, this is the first use in a cell-free protein synthesis system in an in vitro misacylated form. Applying the optimized tRNA ligation conditions, PylT was employed to encode Cy3-AF or Cy5-AF or the natural amino acid Phe within NanoLuc Amber. Rescue of the NanoLuc Amber full length protein via TAG suppression was quantified in a luminescence assay (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Eukaryotic protein synthesis reactions supplemented with NanoLuc Amber cRNA in the presence of PylT lacking an appended amino acid (no AA) produced no measurable bioluminescence above the background signal (p&gt;0.1), consistent with a truncated, nonfunctional NanoLuc Amber protein, and demonstrates orthogonality of the Pyl tRNA (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). In contrast, supplementing the in vitro translation reactions with NanoLuc Amber cRNA and PylT carrying Phe or Cy3-AF resulted in NanoLuc Amber rescue as shown by bioluminescence (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Here, Cy3 incorporation resulted in 56% of the expression of Phe suppression (826\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0126 AU versus 466\u00a0\u00b1\u00a085 AU for Phe and Cy3, respectively). Notably, in the cell-free production, NanoLuc amber rescue was poor for Phe and Cy3, which had yields roughly 7000 and 13,000-fold, respectively, lower than wild-type NanoLuc (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). These data indicate that large fluorescent amino acids based on Cy-dyes can be encoded by the eukaryotic translation machinery through nonsense suppression."

                        "text": "We next tested the possibility that Cy-ncAAs could be encoded in the cellular environment of the Xenopus oocyte expression system given its ease for translation of cRNA transcripts and nonsense suppression with in vitro misacylated tRNA in combination with electrophysiological and single-molecule examination (<a href=\"#bib26\">Leisle et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Dougherty and Van Arnam, 2014</a>). The tRNA variant most often used for amber codon suppression in oocytes is THG73 (<i>Tetrahymena thermophila</i> G73) (<a href=\"#bib45\">Saks et al., 1996</a>). The chloride channel ClC-0 was chosen as a representative membrane protein as previous experiments on ClC-0 have shown that the gating glutamate (E166), a transmembrane residue in the ion permeation pathway, is widely tolerant to natural amino acid substitutions, including large-volume side chains like Phenylalanine, while showing robust expression of chloride conducting ion channels (<a href=\"#bib58\">Zhang et al., 2009</a>). Available crystal structures of gating glutamate mutants of EcClC (a prokaryotic CLC homologue) suggest that substitutions at this position cause the side chain to orient towards the extracellular space with access to aqueous solution, resulting in an open pore phenotype (<a href=\"#bib14\">Dutzler et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Lobet and Dutzler, 2006</a>). This position also turned out to be amenable to nonsense codon suppression as suggested by rescued channel function of ClC-0 E166<i>TAG</i> by Phe-tRNA (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013C</a>). To test that the rescued currents were mediated by ClC-0, chloride was substituted by iodide, which has been shown to inhibit ClC-0 currents (<a href=\"#bib44\">Pusch et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Ludewig et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Zifarelli and Pusch, 2007</a>), resulting in a strong reduction of the measured current amplitudes (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Phenylalanine was used as a positive control for nonsense suppression of ClC-0 E166<i>TAG</i> because Phe is a close mimic of the core structure of the Cy-ncAA. However, we also note that under our current experimental conditions, the wild-type glutamate amino acid was not successfully coupled to pCA, barring its use for nonsense suppression. The \u2018read-through\u2019 at the introduced TAG codon in position 166, a spurious process in genetic code expansion techniques, was minimal at 24 hr post-injection in the presence of a nonacylated (no AA) tRNA (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013C</a>). However, these bleed-through currents generally increase with time, in a site and channel specific manner, and this was also the case with E166TAG ClC-0 expression past 24 hr. Further, max. 7.5 ng of ClC-0 E166<i>TAG</i> cRNA was used per oocyte as higher cRNA amounts led to spurious but increased read-through expression. Consistent with results obtained in cell-free protein synthesis, Cy3 and Cy5-ncAAs could be encoded at E166<i>TAG</i>, resulting in functional channels with robust expression levels, constitutively open gating and chloride selectivity, similar in each parameter to Phe incorporation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013C</a>). To further test the ncAA size limits of the eukaryotic ribosome, a \u2018self-healing\u2019 Cy3 variant LD550 (<a href=\"#bib60\">Zheng et al., 2014</a>) was encoded at the E166 position in ClC-0. The macroscopic currents elicited by the fluorophore-incorporated ClC-0 channels were all well above the background currents (Cy3: 8.6-fold; Cy5: 5.8-fold; LD550: 4.8-fold; p&lt;0.001 for all <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>), thus demonstrating significant suppression efficiencies of the encoded Cy-ncAA-tRNA. The importance of optimizing the tRNA ligation reaction is highlighted when comparing the expression of channels rescued by tRNA produced at 37\u00b0C versus 4\u00b0C where the former condition yields less efficient channel rescue levels (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Further, the amount of tRNA used was also optimized for suppression at ClC-0 E166<i>TAG</i> (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Of note, due to the central location of the E166 encoding site within the ClC-0 reading frame, truncated protein transcripts that lack an encoded Cy-ncAA would be non-functional and biologically inert. Thus, the whole-cell ionic currents are produced by a substantial population (~750,000 channels per \u00b5A [<a href=\"#bib29\">Ludewig et al., 1996</a>]) of functionally expressed, full-length chloride channels at the plasma membrane that contain the encoded Cy-ncAA."

The sodium ion selective pore forming \u03b1-subunit displays modulated expression and gating by the single pass transmembrane \u03b2 subunit (<a href=\"#bib35\">O'Malley and Isom, 2015</a>).

                        "text": "To confirm plasma membrane expression of ClC-0 channels containing encoded Cy-ncAAs, oocytes were examined using a single fluorescent molecule TIRF microscope. Under TIRF illumination multiple fluorescent spots could be detected in the region of the oocyte plasma membrane in contact with the coverslip glass (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Oocytes were coinjected with ClC-0 E166<i>TAG</i> cRNA + Cy3-AF-tRNA + Cy5-AF-tRNA or for the mock condition with ClC-0 wild-type cRNA + Cy3-AF-tRNA + Cy5-AF-tRNA to estimate non-specific background fluorescence. The analysis yielded three significant observations that demonstrate the functional encoding of the Cy-ncAAs into ClC-0. First, overall Cy3 and Cy5 spot densities were higher for the encoded (Cy-ncAA-tRNA plus ClC-0 E166<i>TAG</i> cRNA) versus \u2018mock\u2019 conditions (Cy-ncAA-tRNA plus ClC-0 wild-type cRNA; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A and B</a>). Specifically, the number density for the encoded Cy3 was 0.14\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02 spots per \u00b5m<sup>2</sup>\u00a0and 0.08\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01 for the encoded Cy5, while in mock 0.03\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01 spots per \u00b5m<sup>2</sup> were detected for Cy3 (p=0.001) and 0.02\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01 for Cy5 (p=0.004; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). The fluorescent spots observed in the mock condition may be ascribed to non-encoded Cy-ncAA-tRNA or hydrolyzed Cy-ncAA that may have escaped the cytosol during peeling the vitelline membrane (a prerequisite to TIRF imaging) or that are trapped within the small cytosolic volume of the oocyte microvilli (<a href=\"#bib48\">Sonnleitner et al., 2002</a>). The likelihood that those spots contain CyX-ncAAs encoded within the truncation codons of endogenous plasma membrane proteins that use TAG as a native stop codon is very low because their expression level well below of an overexpressed protein. Further, analysis of EST databases for <i>Xenopus laevis</i> oocytes stage V and VI shows that the list of possible candidates is limited (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). However, most importantly, read-through of a stop codon of an endogenous protein would likely lead to translation of the 3\u2019 UTR and ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bengtson and Joazeiro, 2010</a>). The second observation supporting specific encoding of CyX-ncAAs into ClC-0 is the significant colocalization between Cy3 and Cy5 fluorescent spots in oocytes co-injected with Cy3, Cy5 and ClC-0 E166<i>TAG</i> cRNA. Of all imaged spots, 14\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.2% of those with Cy5 fluorescence co-localized with Cy3 spots in the encoded reaction, compared to only 3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.0% for randomly co-localized Cy3/Cy5 spots, an outcome similar to mock conditions with 3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.8% (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A and C</a>). Thus, in dual Cy3- and Cy5-ncAA encoding conditions, multiple fluorophores appear within single spots suggesting either the encoding of Cy3- and Cy5-ncAA in single or multiple ClC-0 dimers within a distinct fluorescent spot. Lastly, a photo-bleaching analysis of fluorescent spots in encoded and mock condition was performed (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Multiple examples of step-wise bleaching events of the encoded condition are presented in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A and B</a>. The data reveal that while the mock bleaching profile was strongly dominated by single step events, the encoded reaction showed a clear shift towards multiple steps (2+), as shown as absolute values in a histogram (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>) and in relative values (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Further, under encoding conditions some spots showed upwards of 4- and 5-step bleaching events, an observation that was unmatched in the mock condition. Thus, the photo-bleaching data further demonstrate encoding of the Cy-ncAA, likely within single and multiple ClC-0 dimers, in a manner that is consistent with expression beyond the single-molecule level or clustering of rescued full-length channels. Indeed, clustering of ClC-0 wild-type channel has been observed previously in excised patch experiments (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bauer et al., 1991</a>)."

First, the basis for the observation of spots that bleach with\u00a0&gt;2 steps merits further investigation. This could arise, as noted, from over-expression of ClC-0 in the membrane, a possibility that could be tested by titrating down to single-molecule levels by reducing the amount of tRNA injected or reducing expression time. Another possibility is that there are truly higher-order assemblies of ClC-0 in the membrane, as has been observed before and described as clustering (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bauer et al., 1991</a>). In this case, ClC-0 may not be a good system for studying stoichiometry. However, ClC-0 was chosen as a model membrane protein with proven expression in the oocyte, with the added benefit that its permeation pathway has been well studied with the identification of residues such as E166 that are known to be tolerant of a variety of side-chains. A second issue is that the labeling yield is too low to allow for reliable stoichiometry analysis. The data from HPLC analysis of the tRNA suggest that this decrease in fluorescence yield occurs after injection into the oocyte, but it could be occurring after the dye is in the extracellular oxygen rich environment of the solution or during preparation for imaging. During incorporation, the Cy-ncAA may be exposed to reductive conditions in the cell that lead to formation of dark state adducts (<a href=\"#bib12\">Dempsey et al., 2009</a>). Furthermore, imaging was performed in the absence of typical oxygen scavenger systems, as this has been shown to lead to improved photo-bleaching traces (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chadda et al., 2016</a>) but could reduce the overall fluorescent yield. In this regard, future encoding experiments performed in the presence of oxygen quenchers or more stable fluorophores (<a href=\"#bib60\">Zheng et al., 2014</a>) may be required for specific applications of the approach. Overall, in its current iteration, the method will require more development in order to be useful for stoichiometry measurements of protein complexes mainly because of uncertainty in labelling efficiency. None the less, once these issues have been overcome, the use of such probes will be a significant advance for stoichiometry studies over current approaches that rely of chemical labeling of proteins with Cy-dyes or encoded probes, such as GFP."

Yet, due to low degree of colocalization this may be impractical depending on the target protein. The method could also be applied to extract time-regimen information from single-molecule experiments. In fact, estimating lateral diffusion in cellular plasma membrane by single molecule tracking necessitates sparse labelling. In the past, these studies have led to discovery of dynamic nano lipid-raft formation (<a href=\"#bib52\">Suzuki et al., 2012</a>) or elucidation of organization of focal adhesions (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kusumi et al., 2014</a>). It is also useful for other single-molecule studies such as ligand binding (e.g. kinetics of toxin binding, or other high-affinity ligands) or a single-molecule version of voltage fluorometry. Thus, while additional effort is needed to maximize the experimental possibilities for encoding Cy-ncAA, there are a number of applications at this stage. Further, we anticipate that ultimately it will be applicable to mammalian cell lines once approaches for tRNA delivery have been established."

However, the eventual goal of encoding Cy-ncAA is for single-molecule studies, thus, decreased yield is not necessarily a barrier to the application of this approach. In the case of ClC-0, for example, the injection of 100-fold less of the wild-type cRNA was needed to match the lower current amplitudes observed in the \u2018rescued\u2019 ClC-0 channels (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). There are multiple factors that impact the overall efficiency of suppression. For one, competition between the supplied suppressor tRNA with the endogenous translation terminator, release factor 1 (RF-1), for TAG codons. Second, the intrinsic suppression competency of in vitro transcribed and folded tRNA compared to that of native tRNA is not known. Consequently, the in vitro synthesized, orthogonal tRNA might display a lower translation efficiency compared to native tRNAs. Third, amino acid hydrolysis from the tRNA is pH and temperature dependent and might occur during incubation of the injected cells prior to forming a complex with the endogenous elongation factors (<a href=\"#bib37\">Peacock et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Stepanov and Nyborg, 2002</a>)."

The observation that Cy-ncAAs can be encoded into a nascent transcript by the eukaryotic ribosome reveals that the ribosome is surprisingly plastic, and thus opens the door to study proteins by single-molecule approaches in cellular environments. The current fluorescent yields make studies such as ligand binding, or voltage-dependent fluorescence experiments possible.

A modified (G73) version of <i>Tetrahymena thermophila</i> tRNA, THG73 was employed for nonsense suppression in <i>Xenopus leavis</i> oocytes. To yield a full-length (acylated) tRNA, first a construct lacking the last two nucleotides was transcribed in vitro using CellScript T7-Scribe Standard RNA IVT Kit (CELLSCRIPT,\u00a0Madison,\u00a0WI). The DNA templates (coding for the tRNA preceded by a T7 promoter) were ordered as PAGE-purified primers from Integrated DNA Technologies\u00a0(Coralville,\u00a0IA).

For the TIRF microscopy experiments, oocytes were pre-incubated in hypertonic OR-2 and subsequently recovered in isotonic OR-2 before injection (details see <i>Sample preparation</i> in <i>Single-molecule imaging via Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy</i>). Here, the following amounts were injected: for the encoded reaction, 7.5 ng of ClC-0 E166<i>TAG</i> cRNA with 190\u2013250 ng of nonacylated or misacylated tRNA (Cy3- or Cy5-ncAA misacylated tRNAs in a 1:1 ratio); for the mock control, 0.5 ng ClC-0 mRNA with 190\u2013250 ng of misacylated tRNA. Protein expression was confirmed prior to single-molecule imaging via TEVC. Wildtype cRNAs were injected in 10-fold reduced amounts to yield comparable current amplitudes. The total injection volume was kept constant at 50 nl for all conditions."

As the evanescent wave decays exponentially, it is effective only in the 100\u2013250 nm range enabling the selective visualization of the plasma-membrane and cell cortex, thus minimizing the background fluorescence from the cytosol. To expose the oocyte plasma membrane, the\u00a0~1 \u00b5m thick vitelline membrane (<a href=\"#bib48\">Sonnleitner et al., 2002</a>) was removed mechanically with forceps under a dissecting microscope after incubating the oocytes in hypertonic OR-2 solution (in mM: 82.5 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 HEPES pH 7.5) for max. 5 min (osmolarity of the hypertonic solution was adjusted with sucrose to 500 mOsm/l). Incubation in hypertonic ringer helps to separate the vitelline membrane from the plasma membrane as the oocytes shrink in size. In order to minimize complicating effects of micro-ruptures of the plasma-membrane (not visible under the dissecting microscope) which may result in the leakage of fluorophores from the cytosol, two additional preparatory steps were performed. First, before injection of the oocytes the connections between the vitelline membrane and the plasma-membrane were weakened by incubation in hypertonic OR-2 for max. 5 min (as inspired by [<a href=\"#bib9\">Choe and Sackin, 1997</a>]). Subsequent recovery in isotonic OR-2 was allowed before injection. Second, after peeling the vitelline membrane on the day of imaging, the oocytes were transferred from the hypertonic solution into the slightly hypertonic OR-2 with 250 mOsm/l and incubated on an orbital shaker at\u00a0~30 rpm for at least 20 min. The oocytes were incubated singly in separate wells of a non-treated 6-well plate (with 4 ml solution per well). Only the oocytes that did not burst or loose their shape during that procedure were subjected to single-molecule imaging. They were washed twice in 250 mOsm/l OR-2 and transferred onto a treated glass coverslip (oriented with the animal pole towards the glass) where they were incubated for\u00a0~15 min prior to imaging to maximize their adherence."

The emitted fluorescence was collected using a broad-band mirror and focused onto an iXon3 888 EM/CCD camera (Andor Inc.,\u00a0South Windsor, CT). The illuminated area on the coverslip was\u00a0~2500 \u00b5m (<a href=\"#bib57\">Zachariassen et al., 2016</a>). A region of the oocyte was selected to focus the sample and then adjust the TIRF angle. Then images for analysis were collected on adjacent fields which were unexposed to laser illumination. The images were acquired in a sequential manner. First, oocytes were excited with 637 nm laser (OBIS; Coherent Inc., Santa Clara, CA) and emitted light was collected using a notched Cy5 emission filter (ZET635nf; Chroma, Bellows Falls, VT). After all the Cy5 spots were photobleached excitation was switched to 532 nm (Sapphire; Coherent Inc., Santa Clara, CA) to excite and photobleach Cy3 spots. Cy3 emission was collected using a bandpass filter (ET585/40m; Chroma, Bellows Falls, VT). Image sequences were acquired at\u00a0~1 frame per second with EM gain set to 300, and laser intensity at 1.2 mW for Cy3 and 250 \u00b5W for Cy5 line to obtain long photo-bleaching traces while maintaining good signal to noise ratios. We consistenly observed higher background in encoded-Cy5 images possibly related to greater penetration depth of evanescent field at longer wavelengths."

Integrated fluorescence intensity from the AOIs was plotted as a function of time for each AOI allowing for analysis of step-like photo-bleaching behavior (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>).

Each of the ESTs were then queried against <i>Xenopus laevis</i>\u2019s Unigene database that contains 31306 sequence clusters (Build #94) (<a href=\"#bib42\">Pontius et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Boguski and Schuler, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Schuler, 1997</a>). We identified 1305 unique mRNA sequences that were expressed in stage V/VI <i>X. laevis</i> oocytes. The open reading frame (ORF) was identified and transcribed from these mRNA sequences and the protein sequence was used to predict the number of transmembrane (TM) helices using TMHMM 2.0 (<a href=\"#bib23\">Krogh et al., 2001</a>). TMHMM algorithm is currently the best performing algorithm and it correctly predicts 97\u201398% of the transmembrane helices. We would like to point out that that our goal was not to correctly predict transmembrane helices but to classify the protein as soluble or membrane proteins. We classified all proteins with more than one predicted transmembrane segment as a membrane protein. With this method we found 43 membrane proteins whose mRNA sequence showed a TAG stop codon. We call attention to the possibility that of 18 protein sequences with a single predicted transmembrane helix, the N-terminally situated TM segment could be a signal peptide that may or may not get cleaved post-translationally. Hence, our bioinformatics analysis might overestimate the number of membrane proteins expressed in <i>Xenopus laevis</i> oocytes by a small amount."

We have now amended the manuscript to make it clear how this method is currently useful. First, the incorporation of a bright, organic dye into the protein backbone in live cells provides a new strategy for in vivo fluorescent labeling. While we observe that the fluorescent yield decreases after introduction into oocytes, optimization of this approach with oxygen scavenger systems or photostable dyes will likely address this issue in the next generation of experiments. Still, at this time, the incorporation of a cyanine dye into membrane proteins in cells even at low levels, introduces new opportunities for single-molecule studies. This includes measurements of binding equilibrium of fluorescently labeled ligands/toxins/proteins using co-localization microscopy, low background single-molecule voltage clamp fluorometry of ion channels, and, once established in other cell expression systems, can provide an ideal method for obtaining long-lived diffusional tracking of membrane proteins within membranes. While the fluorescent yield needs to be increased to make this method useful for subunit counting and single-molecule FRET, the data we present here demonstrates that it is possible to incorporate large cyanine dyes into proteins via the ribosome and thus reports a significant advance in site-specific fluorescent labeling of proteins in living cells."

Thus, the increased size of the Cy-ncAA does not impact function (at this site) but appears to lower the expression. The inefficient nature of nonsense suppression is relevant to the application of the technique and is now discussed in the context of in vitro and oocyte expression systems. In particular, in the in vitro protein reaction, rescue of the NanoLuc Amber nonsense codon appears to be very low in comparison to WT expression, ~7,000-fold for Phe and ~13,000-fold for Cy3, respectively (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). In the case of the oocyte expression system, new data is provided on the rescue versus WT expression of ClC-0 indicating that suppressed channels are roughly 100-fold lower in their expression (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). We therefore highlight in the manuscript the remarkable result that these dyes can be encoded in the eukaryotic ribosome, and make clear that their application is intended for single-molecule studies, thus only requiring very small amounts of encoded protein. We hope that this discussion of suppression efficiency helps to clarify the utility of the approach. Its use for macroscopic FRET, for instance, would be challenging in its current iteration. Further, we discuss how encoding rates may influence the overall expression of a protein harboring the Cy-ncAA and how the determination of the fluorescent fraction of encoded dyes remains an important challenge prior to their systematic use to study distances by single molecule FRET or protein complex stoichiometry."

In the original manuscript, rescue of GFP152<i>TAG</i> was investigated by confocal imaging of single beads. We have since begun to more systematically quantify the in vitro rescue of GFP152<i>TAG</i> by bulk fluorometry bead imaging. The data here indicate that rescue is low and not statistically significant above background. Thus, the individual confocal images of GFP on single beads is not representative of the bulk population, which we believe, is a more accurate representation of the overall rescue. The in vitro system remains valid however, as we have further confirmed the encoding of Cy3-ncAA within the NanoLuc-Amber construct using pyrrolysine tRNA. This data also indicates that the rescue of NanoLuc-Amber is well below WT NanoLuc expression, see above. This may suggest that the in vitro system is less efficient compared to the oocyte but this possibility, as well as the general optimization of in vitro encoding conditions will require additional investigation. The main thrust of the manuscript remains the demonstration the encoding of the Cy dyes in membrane proteins in live cells. Therefore, the changes above in regards to cell free protein synthesis do not alter the overall conclusions of the study, but further highlight the need to optimize this method when working with new protein systems, something that is expected whenever working with a new technique."

Clustering has been reported previously for expressed ClC-0 in the oocyte (Bauer et al., 1991). Both of these conditions precludes the direct examination of ClC-0 channel stoichiometry, although the former could be titrated down to achieve single-molecule expression. In either case, the appearance of higher order bleaching step events has not been seen in control conditions and, hence, provides some of the strongest evidence for encoding of the Cy-ncAA in the ClC-0 channel.

Although, as stated above, the larger Cy dyes do appear to be reaching the size limit for encoding abilities but this possibility merits a more deliberate structure-encoding investigation. However, the goal of this project at the outset was not to achieve macroscopic FRET but to encode a non-canonical fluorophore with proven utility for single-molecule studies. The Cy-ncAA introduced here meets this criterion. In the context of single molecules, the reduced expression level is not necessarily a shortcoming. And while it is clear that, for the ClC-0 example, the channels show a 100\u2019s-fold decrease in expression levels, this is still millions of channels in the oocyte, thus likely to be enough to yield meaningful single-molecule signals, either in situ in the oocyte plasma membrane or after purification. Further, our group has recently published a complementary method using known endoplasmic retention signals and split intein sequences to enable the suppression of multiple stop sites within a protein complex or reading frame (Lueck et al., 2016). Lastly, the pyrrolysine tRNA used in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a> has been shown previously to be amenable to anticodon mutagenesis to allow for the specific encoding at dedicated stop sites i.e. TAG versus TGA (Ambrogelly et al., 2007). Thus, while some key steps are in place for the eventual application of single-molecule FRET, as is the case with any new approach, protein specific technical issues will no doubt need to be overcome."

Here, the data show that after synthesis and coupling to tRNA, the Cy-ncAA remain fluorescent and the apparent loss of fluorescence occurs within the oocyte and during downstream encoding events. Future experiments with oxygen scavengers and more stable dyes will help in this regard. Nonetheless, the interpretation of the data, which is now more clearly emphasized in the resubmitted manuscript, is that it overwhelmingly supports the notion that the dyes can be encoded in a eukaryotic ribosome. This single observation alone is significant. Thus, of all the potential problems that one may have anticipated for encoding a large dye for single-molecule imaging, the ribosome is surprisingly tolerant.

In reference to the specific questions on predicted outcomes of colocalization and bleaching steps, these issues are associated with the use of ClC-0 and are therefore likely to be further complicated by the channel clustering (mentioned above). However, the abundance of single bleaching steps for Cy3 is unlikely due to the possibility that ClC-0 is not properly assembled into dimers given that the encoding site, E166, is not near the protein interface of the dimer, and substitutions at this position in homologue proteins crystalized as dimers (Dutzler et al., 2003; Lobet &amp; Dutzler, 2006).

Second, the in vitro transcribed and folded tRNA is not modified while native tRNAs are and it is not known whether modifications might still occur in the cell after injection into oocytes. Further, a proportion of the synthetized tRNA molecules might not be properly folded. Consequently, the in vitro synthesized, orthogonal tRNA might display a lower translation efficiency compared to native tRNAs. Third, amino acid hydrolysis from the tRNA is pH and temperature dependent and might occur during incubation of the translation reactions in cell-free or in oocytes prior to forming a complex with the endogenous elongation factors (Peacock et al., 2014). However, the latter is not supported by the fact that membrane protein expression generally improves over the course of days."

However, once injected into the oocyte we cannot rule out that hydrolysis of the amino acid from the tRNA in some form is not a factor in the subsequent expression profiles of various channel proteins and specific sites. This is not unique to the Cy-ncAA described here and given the wide-spread success of nonsense suppression generally in the oocyte this appears to be unlikely. For instance, the expression of rescued proteins will increase over the course of 24-48 hours after the injection of target cRNA and acylated tRNA. This suggests that the tRNA are present in the acylated form over this period. It is possible that the injected tRNA subsequently forms a stable complex with an endogenous elongation factors, which are abundant in eukaryotes, a possibility that would significantly reduce in-cell hydrolysis (Peacock et al., 2014)."

The specific incorporation of Phe, Cy3- and Cy5-ncAA produced between about 6-11 times larger currents at +80 mV than the read-through control.

Therefore, we compared oocytes simply injected with water, non-acylated tRNA + ClC-0 E166<i>TAG</i> cRNA or Phe-tRNA + ClC-0 E166<i>TAG</i> cRNA and examined the subsequent reversal potential and current amplitude. Moreover, we perfused these oocytes with iodide, a ClC-0 blocker (Pusch et al., 1995; Ludewig et al., 1997; Zifarelli &amp; Pusch, 2007) to provide evidence that the measured currents are carried by ClC-0 channels.

However, this gets back to the reasoning for using ClC-0 and the E166 site. For instance, extensive previous mutagenesis indicates that E166 shows broad tolerance for many types of side-chains. Thus, the bulky cyanine dyes are unlikely to be in the middle of the open pore. This possibility is further supported by available crystal structures of the open pore mutants of CLC proteins that have been resolved (Dutzler et al., 2003; Lobet & Dutzler, 2006), suggesting that substitutions at this position cause the side chains to orient towards the extracellular space. We now discuss this information in the text."
