While a broad T cell repertoire requires diverse positively selecting self-peptides, how a single positively selecting ligand influences naive T cell precursor frequency remains undefined. We generated a transgenic mouse expressing a naturally occurring self-peptide, gp250, that positively selects an MCC-specific TCR, AND, as the only MHC class II I-E<sup>k</sup> ligand to study the MCC highly organized immunodominance hierarchy. The single gp250/I-E<sup>k</sup> ligand greatly enhanced MCC-tetramer<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, and skewed MCC-tetramer<sup>+</sup> population toward V11\u03b1<sup>+</sup>V\u03b23<sup>+</sup>, a major TCR pair in MCC-specific immunodominance. The gp250-selected V11\u03b1<sup>+</sup>V\u03b23<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells had a significantly increased frequency of conserved MCC-preferred CDR3 features.

This fundamental feature of T cell responses is known as immunodominance (<a href=\"#bib50\">Sercarz et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Chen et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Yewdell and Del Val, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Yewdell, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Sant et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Weaver and Sant, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Jenkins and Moon, 2012</a>). Most of the effort in immunodominance studies has focused on the antigen presentation and processing pathways (<a href=\"#bib10\">Deng et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">van Ham et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Nanda and Sant, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Chen et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Crowe et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Chen and McCluskey, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Lazarski et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Yewdell, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Weaver and Sant, 2009</a>). Yet immunodominance is also defined by the frequencies of naive T cells specific for individual antigens (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kotturi et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Jenkins and Moon, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Kwok et al., 2012</a>). Given that thymic positive selection serves as a major developmental process to generate mature T cell repertoires (<a href=\"#bib24\">Jameson et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Morris and Allen, 2012</a>), one may reason positive selection would play a role in determining naive T cell precursor frequency to dictate immunodominance. However, this possibility has been difficult to address directly, due to several technological issues. First, the frequency of T cells specific for individual peptide\u2013MHC ligands is at most about 20\u2013100 cells per million naive T cells (<a href=\"#bib25\">Jenkins and Moon, 2012</a>), making it difficult to identify such an infrequent population. Second, to directly test the potential role of positive selection in immunodominance requires the knowledge of what T cell population specific for a defined antigen a positively selecting ligand is capable of selecting. Therefore, the low frequency of naive T cell precursor and the ignorance of essential information have limited the examination of the roles of positive selecting ligands in dictating naive T cell precursor frequency and immunodominance."

Only one single dominant epitope emerges from the immunization of H\u22122<sup>k</sup> mice with the whole protein of moth cytochrome <i>c</i> (MCC) or closely related pigeon cytochrome <i>c</i> (PCC) (<a href=\"#bib19\">Hedrick et al., 1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Winoto et al., 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Hedrick et al., 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">McHeyzer-Williams and Davis, 1995</a>). Also, the MCC- or PCC-stimulated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell response shows highly organized immunodominance hierarches. The MCC- or PCC-specific responses are highly dominated by V\u03b111<sup>+</sup> TCR, and exhibit several conserved CDR3 features (<a href=\"#bib56\">Winoto et al., 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Hedrick et al., 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">McHeyzer-Williams and Davis, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">McHeyzer-Williams et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Mikszta et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Newell et al., 2011</a>). During MCC-specific responses, the V\u03b111<sup>+</sup>V\u03b23<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are the most dominant responders, while V\u03b111<sup>+</sup> TCRs pairing with V\u03b26<sup>+</sup>, V\u03b28<sup>+</sup>, or V\u03b214<sup>+</sup> are the subdominant responders (<a href=\"#bib40\">Miyazaki et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Malherbe et al., 2004</a>). Based on the structural data, certain positions at CDR3\u03b1 and CDR3\u03b2 regions, where TCR make contact with MCC peptide, present highly conserved amino acid usages (<a href=\"#bib38\">McHeyzer-Williams et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Newell et al., 2011</a>). These features constitute the strength of utilizing cytochrome <i>c</i> as a model antigen to study CD4<sup>+</sup> immunodominance. Moreover, the MCC/I-E<sup>k</sup> tetramers have been shown to be able to detect most primary MCC-specific T cells (<a href=\"#bib48\">Savage et al., 1999</a>). Importantly, our laboratory had previously identified a naturally occurring positively selecting self-peptide, termed gp250, for its ability to positively select the MCC-specific TCR: AND (<a href=\"#bib35\">Lo et al., 2009</a>). In this study, we have generated a transgenic mouse line, the gp250 single chain (SC) mouse, in which the gp250/I-E<sup>k</sup> was the only MHC class II ligand presented. Combining MCC tetramer analysis and our gp250 SC mice permitted us to elucidate the relationship between positively selecting ligands and antigen specificities of post-selection CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell repertoires."

To examine gp250\u2019s effect on the post-selection MCC-specific T cell repertoire, we constructed a transgenic mouse line using the MHC class II promoter in which all of the MHC class II molecules contained the gp250 self-peptide via a covalent linkage of the peptide to the MHC class II \u03b2 chain. We obtained one B6 founder in which the gp250 covalently linked I-E<sup>k</sup> \u03b2 chain had successfully integrated and was expressed.

While T cell populations specific for other foreign antigens very likely became smaller, T cells specific for MCC increased in percentage, or at least stayed comparable to T cells selected by diverse self-peptide repertoire in terms of the absolute number. Indeed, the MCC tetramer<sup>+</sup> population was uniquely expanded in the gp250-selected CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell repertoire, as the frequency of the hemoglobin antigen (Hb) tetramer-bound CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell population was equivalent, if not slightly decreased (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,D</a>). To show that the increased MCC tetramer<sup>+</sup> population was the product of gp250-mediated positive selection not due to the lack of negative selection, we generated radiation bone marrow chimeras (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E,F</a>). We used B6.K hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) to reconstitute lethally irradiated gp250 SC mice (B6.K &gt; gp250 SC). The B6.K HSC-reconstituted B6.K bone marrow chimeras served as the controls (B6.K &gt; B6.K). After a 12-week reconstitution, the frequency of MCC tetramer<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells was 1.5% in B6.K HSC-reconstituted gp250 SC mice (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E,F</a>). Compared with the frequency of MCC tetramer<sup>+</sup> population in B6.K HSC-reconstituted B6.K mice, which was about 0.18%, gp250-mediated positive selection enriched MCC tetramer<sup>+</sup> cells more than eightfold (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E,F</a>). The B6.K HSC-reconstituted gp250 chimeras suggested the augmented MCC tetramer<sup>+</sup> population in gp250 SC mice was not due to the lack of negative selection. Taken together, our data showed that gp250-mediated positive selection enriched for MCC-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells."

We hypothesized that recognition of a positively selecting ligand may influence a specific antigen response through optimizing the selection of dominant TCRs. We therefore included the TCR V\u03b111 staining in MCC-tetramer experiments to examine the V\u03b111<sup>+</sup> TCR expression in gp250-selected MCC-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>). In B6.K CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, the MCC tetramer<sup>+</sup> populations that used V\u03b111<sup>\u2212</sup> vs V\u03b111<sup>+</sup> were about equal, whereas in gp250 SC mice, the vast majority of MCC tetramer<sup>+</sup> population expressed V\u03b111<sup>+</sup> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>).

On day 7 post immunization, about 50% of MCC-reactive T cells were V\u03b111<sup>+</sup>V\u03b23<sup>+</sup>, and V\u03b111<sup>+</sup>V\u03b26<sup>+</sup>, V\u03b111<sup>+</sup>V\u03b28<sup>+</sup>, V\u03b111<sup>+</sup>V\u03b214<sup>+</sup> constituted the remaining 50% MCC-reactive T cells. Observing gp250-mediated selection promoted the MCC-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells toward the usage of V\u03b111<sup>+</sup>, we next examined the selection of MCC-preferred dominant and subdominant TCR pairs in gp250 SC mice (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). The V\u03b111<sup>+</sup>-expressing CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells significantly increased in the thymus and periphery in gp250 SC mice (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>), suggesting gp250/I-E<sup>k</sup> actively skewed the post-selection TCR usages to influence antigen specificities. While examining the TCR V\u03b2 expression among gp250-selected V\u03b111<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, MCC-preferred dominant pair V\u03b111<sup>+</sup>V\u03b23<sup>+</sup> increased about 1.4-fold in thymic CD4SP and at least twofold in periphery (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C\u2013E</a>). Certain subdominant MCC-preferred TCRs also increased (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C\u2013E</a>). Interestingly, for some V\u03b2s, found commonly to pair with V\u03b111 in normal mice (such as V\u03b22 and V\u03b24), the frequencies were unchanged (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). This observation argued that gp250 specifically promoted the selection of MCC-specific TCR usages, and was not merely functioning as a good selecting ligand for all V\u03b111<sup>+</sup>. The increased frequency of V\u03b111<sup>+</sup>V\u03b23<sup>+</sup> did not result from the absence of negative selection in gp250 SC mice (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>). While reconstituted lethally irradiated gp250 SC mice with B6.K HSC cells, the negative selection in gp250 SC mice was restored due to the presence of B6.K HSC-derived antigen presenting cells in the thymus. After a 12-week reconstitution, V\u03b111<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> peripheral T cells in B6.K &gt; gp250 SC bone marrow chimeras were about 2.5-fold larger than the size in B6.K &gt; B6.K chimeras (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>). The V\u03b111<sup>+</sup>V\u03b23<sup>+</sup> population increased to approximately threefold in B6.K &gt; gp250 SC chimeras, compared with the population in B6.K &gt; B6.K chimera mice as well (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>).

We obtained about 2900 unique CDR3\u03b1 and 1500 CDR3\u03b2 sequences in gp250-selected V\u03b111<sup>+</sup>V\u03b23<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>).

In B6.K mice, about 20% of V\u03b111<sup>+</sup>V\u03b23<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells expressed serine at CDR3 \u03b191, whereas in gp250 SC mice, the frequency was increased 1.5-fold to become about 30% (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>). We observed a similar 1.5-fold increase of serine at \u03b191 in single cell repertoire analysis compared to the published data (<a href=\"#bib38\">McHeyzer-Williams et al., 1999</a>) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>).

The significantly increased usages of CDR3 \u03b191S and \u03b297N in gp250-selected V\u03b111<sup>+</sup>V\u03b23<sup>+</sup> T cells may also help explain the augmented MCC-tetramer bound population in gp250 SC mice."

The first finding from late 90\u2032 revealed that one positively selecting self-peptide was capable of selecting many different TCRs (<a href=\"#bib22\">Ignatowicz et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Ignatowicz et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Liu et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Huseby et al., 2005</a>). A few years later, Barton and Rudensky proposed that even though one self-peptide may select many TCRs, a diverse low abundant self-peptide repertoire is required to generate a full TCR repertoire (<a href=\"#bib1\">Barton and Rudensky, 1999</a>). Subsequently, with the publication of a series of single chain mice, the model was further refined because even though the TCR repertoire selected by one single ligand was not reduced significantly enough to allow an visualization of a repertoire \u2018hole\u2019, the postselection T cells in each single chain mouse showed different degrees of self-peptide reactivity in mixed lymphocyte culture (<a href=\"#bib2\">Barton et al., 2002</a>). These studies showed that a diverse collection of positively selecting self-peptides were necessary to generate a full T cell repertoire (<a href=\"#bib1\">Barton and Rudensky, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Barton et al., 2002</a>). This present study involving the gp250 self-peptide showed increased frequency of V\u03b111<sup>+</sup>V\u03b23<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells with MCC-preferred CDR3 features in gp250 SC mice. The V\u03b111<sup>+</sup>V\u03b23<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells with specific CDR3 features were the dominant responders to promote MCC primary and memory responses. Therefore, gp250\u2019s selecting capability provided a possible explanation to elucidate V\u03b111<sup>+</sup> TCR-driven MCC immunodominance: a positively selecting self-peptide may favor the selection of TCR pairs and CDR3 features that were specific for MCC responses."

In this study, we reported that CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells specific for a defined antigen are positively selected by a common self-peptide. The self-peptide gp250 positively selected AND TCR, supporting our previous in vitro study (<a href=\"#bib34\">Lo and Allen, 2013</a>), and also selected many other TCRs that have been reported as good MCC responders (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hedrick et al., 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">McHeyzer-Williams et al., 1999</a>). Our data reveal for the first time that positive selection may influence the TCR V(D)J preference and specific CDR3 junction sequences, and thus shape T cell response to a specific antigen. Our studies therefore offer direct evidence and a new perspective on how to generate a post-selection CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell repertoire with desired antigen specificities, through engineering the positively selecting self-peptide."

In the bulk population TCR repertoire analysis, the CDR3\u03b1 was found for the well-characterized AND, 5c.c7 and 226 TCRs and also for the majority of published MCC-preferred clones. These findings suggested that one selecting ligand can select as many CDR3s with conserved features for specific antigen recognition as a full self-peptide repertoire could select. Previously, the Davis laboratory and we have shown in vitro that the self-peptide for AND and 5c.c7 TCRs were mutually exclusive with each other (<a href=\"#bib11\">Ebert et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Lo and Allen, 2013</a>). The basis for why 5c.c7 was selected in vivo but not in vitro by gp250 probably reflects the relative inefficiency of the in vitro positively selecting assays. Our data suggest these strong MCC-reactive TCR clones may share a common positively selecting ligand, and support our hypothesis that positive selection may be the foundation of T cell immunodominance."

This observation makes sense when one considers that the number of selecting self-peptides presented in cortical thymic epithelial cells is smaller than the size of mature CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell repertoire (<a href=\"#bib34\">Lo and Allen, 2013</a>). Therefore, one positively selecting self-peptide has to select a large number of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell with diverse, unrelated antigen specificities, to be able to generate a full CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell repertoire. The thymic development of regulatory T cells is also dependent upon self-peptides, and requires the strong interaction with these self-peptide MHC ligands (<a href=\"#bib16\">Gottschalk et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Ohkura and Sakaguchi, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Corse et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Ohkura et al., 2013</a>). However, our preliminary analysis of CD25 expression of CD4SP in the gp250 SC mice did not reveal any significant differences from B6.K mice. The comparable regulatory T cell frequencies in gp250 SC mice and B6.K mice suggested that merely altering the self-peptide diversity was not sufficient to manipulate the affinity threshold for regulatory T cell selection. The finding was perhaps not surprising, given the potential TCR diversity through CDR3 recombination mechanism is nearly infinite, and both the TCR and the self-peptide determine the strength of interaction."

How could a peptide influence the selection of many different V\u03b1 chains, with a range of CDR3\u03b1 sequences? The general binding mode of TCR to pMHC has the CDR1 and CDR2 contacting the MHC, and the CDR3 contacting the peptide. One explanation comes from the crystal structure of the 226 TCR bound to MCC/I-E<sup>k28</sup>. The side chain of the Arg29 residue of the V\u03b111 CDR1 makes a hydrogen bond with the backbone carbonyl oxygen of the P3 residue (<a href=\"#bib44\">Newell et al., 2011</a>). Thus gp250 could position the P3 carbonyl oxygen ideally to form this hydrogen bond, and thus favoring V\u03b111 TCRs. Further structural studies will be needed to reveal the molecular basis of how a single peptide can select defined TCRs."

This is a valuable piece of basic research and contributes new quantitative data to our understanding of what positive selection of the repertoire actually means. They have chosen a good model system to use in this study as a lot is known about the molecular specificity of CD4 T cell recognition of moth/pigeon cytochrome c peptides bound to I-E<sup>k</sup>. This allows them to see subtle but significant increases in the frequency of certain contact amino acid residues (\u03b191S and \u03b297N) in the na\u00efve repertoire when only gp250/I-E<sup>k</sup> self-ligand is the selecting element. Their chimera experiments show that these observations are not due to negative selection. This work we think adds significantly to the literature and should be published."

Intriguingly, previous in vitro experiments from Mark Davis' lab showed that the major self-peptide (GP peptide) selecting that particular moth cytochrome c-specific TCR is different from the one used for the AND TCR. Thus, one would suspect that the repertoire changes seen with gp250 might not include those seen with the GP peptide and vice versa. While doing the complete crisscross set of experiments with a GP-peptide, antigen transgenic would be the ideal science to test this hypothesis, we think that would require several more years of research and would be asking far too much to be done for any journal. Instead, the authors try to argue that the TCR CDR3\u03b1 signature sequence for 5c.c7 (as well as that for the 226 T cell) was not found in their single cell TCR V\u03b111 sampling and thus was not enriched by gp250/I-E<sup>k</sup> mono-selection. However, they only sequence a total of 38 V\u03b111 clones, among which they found only 2 had the AND CDR3\u03b1 sequence. This is not a large enough sample size to reach a significant conclusion. We therefore think they should repeat this CDR3\u03b1 single cell sequencing experiment to increase their sample size to a number from which they can show statistical significance for the enrichment of AND CDR3\u03b1 and still no detectable 5c.c7 and 226 CDR3\u03b1 sequences."

The following sentence including, \u201cimprint the post-selection T cells toward the recognition of a specific antigen...\u201d We don't think that is what the authors intend. Our interpretation of the data is that positive selection can influence the TCR V(D)J preference and specific junctional sequence usage in the T cell response to a specific antigen. Positive selection can imprint preferential VDJ sequences on an antigen response. It doesn't imprint the post-selection T cells toward the recognition of a specific antigen-that issue is not addressed in this study. We recommend a close examination of the Discussion."

The reviewers raised an excellent point that we probably simply missed the 5c.c7, given the limited size of our single cell repertoire database. We were very intrigued by the question that whether or not gp250 can select 5c.c7 TCR, and believed the manuscript would be strengthened by having a definitive answer. We therefore collaborated with Dr. Chyi Hsieh to perform bulk population repertoire analysis of CDR3\u03b1 sequences. We sorted V\u03b111<sup>+</sup>V\u03b23<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from gp250 SC mice or B6.K mice, generated V\u03b111<sup>+</sup> TCR library, and sequenced using Illumina MiSeq technology at the Washington University Genome Sequencing Center. In gp250-selected CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, we identified about 2900 unique CDR3\u03b1 sequences, and we did find 5c.c7 TCR as well as AND (<a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>). More importantly, now with such a large dataset of CDR3\u03b1 sequences, we were able to re-examine the MCC-preferred CDR3\u03b1 features in gp250 SC and B6.K mice. Consistent with the previous observation, gp250-mediated positive selection enriched the usage of serine at CDR3 \u03b191 residue. In B6.K mice, about 20% of V\u03b111<sup>+</sup>V\u03b23<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells expressed serine at CDR3 \u03b191, whereas in gp250 SC mice, we observed about 1.5 fold increase (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). With these thousands of sequences, we believe our conclusion on the gp250-enriched MCC-preferred CDR3 features were further strengthened. We included the new data in the newly revised <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a> and <a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>. We also revised the Results and Discussion accordingly."

In previous work, Barton and Rudensky compared the OVA or HEL specific responses of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells selected by four different single peptide ligands, and found no difference among the T cell proliferation against OVA or HEL in these four mice. While conducting mixed lymphocyte culture with wild type antigen presenting cells, they found T cells from these four single peptide mice exhibited different degrees of proliferation against self-peptides. They concluded each single positively selecting ligand was capable of selecting CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells specific for the antigens they tested, but each postselection population was unique in terms of self-reactivity. In gp250 SC mice with the well-established MCC-specific T cell features, we argued one positively selecting self-peptide enhanced the selection of certain TCRs with conserved CDR3 features to dominate in a given antigen response (such as gp250 favors the selection of MCC-specific T cells).
