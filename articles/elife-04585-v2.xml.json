We examine the possibility that functional connectivity also reflects short-term changes in synaptic efficacy. We demonstrate that paired transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) near ventral premotor cortex (PMv) and primary motor cortex (M1) with a short 8-ms inter-pulse interval evoking synchronous pre- and post-synaptic activity and which strengthens interregional connectivity between the two areas in a pattern consistent with Hebbian plasticity, leads to increased functional connectivity between PMv and M1 as measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Moreover, we show that strengthening connectivity between these nodes has effects on a wider network of areas, such as decreasing coupling in a parallel motor programming stream. A control experiment revealed that identical TMS pulses at identical frequencies caused no change in fMRI-measured functional connectivity when the inter-pulse-interval was too long for Hebbian-like plasticity."

We examine the possibility that functional connectivity also reflects short-term changes in synaptic efficacy. We demonstrate that paired transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) near ventral premotor cortex (PMv) and primary motor cortex (M1) with a short 8-ms inter-pulse interval evoking synchronous pre- and post-synaptic activity and which strengthens interregional connectivity between the two areas in a pattern consistent with Hebbian plasticity, leads to increased functional connectivity between PMv and M1 as measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Moreover, we show that strengthening connectivity between these nodes has effects on a wider network of areas, such as decreasing coupling in a parallel motor programming stream. A control experiment revealed that identical TMS pulses at identical frequencies caused no change in fMRI-measured functional connectivity when the inter-pulse-interval was too long for Hebbian-like plasticity."

Statistical dependencies between remote cortical regions exist both in the absence of external stimuli or task demands (i.e., during the resting state) and during execution of a task (<a href=\"#bib33\">Hampson et al., 2002</a>).

To this aim, we modulated synaptic efficacy in a specific corticocortical pathway using repetitive paired pulses of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) with a brief inter-pulse interval (IPI; 8 ms) that evoked synchronous pre- and post-synaptic activity and monitored whether those changes were reflected in altered functional connectivity (Experiment 1) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Several TMS protocols have been shown to induce changes in excitability in primary motor cortex (M1) using repetitive stimulation of M1 itself (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chen et al., 1997</a>) or stimulation of premotor regions projecting to M1 (<a href=\"#bib50\">Munchau et al., 2002</a>). These changes are often thought to reflect frequency-dependent potentiation of synaptic transmission. Furthermore, it has been shown that repetitive paired stimulation of an input into M1\u2014such as the median nerve\u2014and then of M1 itself can change M1 cortico-spinal excitability (<a href=\"#bib69\">Stefan et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Wolters et al., 2003</a>). These paired associative stimulation (PAS) protocols are based upon Hebbian principles of synaptic plasticity and appear to modify connectivity in a controlled manner. Investigations that applied paired-pulse TMS over interconnected sites\u2014for example, homotopical M1 sites (<a href=\"#bib61\">Rizzo et al., 2009</a>), M1 and the supplementary motor area (SMA) (<a href=\"#bib1\">Arai et al., 2011</a>), and M1 and posterior parietal cortex (<a href=\"#bib40\">Koch et al., 2013</a>)\u2014demonstrated altered motor cortical excitability. Notably, the current protocol of repetitive paired-pulse TMS has been shown to induce a causal and directional change of influence of the first brain region (ventral premotor cortex: PMv) over the anatomically connected second region (M1) (<a href=\"#bib8\">Buch et al., 2011</a>). This is important since it is such pathway-specific changes that occur in animal models of synaptic plasticity (<a href=\"#bib45\">Markram et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Jackson et al., 2006</a>) and these are argued to underlie the self-organization proposed to occur in mono-synaptically connected networks in response to regularly occurring input (<a href=\"#bib70\">Sussillo and Abbott, 2009</a>)."

This means that although paired stimulation of PMv and M1 leads to strengthening of the excitatory connections between PMv and M1, such strengthening can lead to both enhanced facilitatory and enhanced inhibitory influences of PMv on M1. Enhanced facilitatory influences are more apparent when subjects are subsequently tested while performing a simple reaching and grasping task, and enhanced inhibitory influences are more apparent when subjects are subsequently tested while at rest (<a href=\"#bib8\">Buch et al., 2011</a>).

This enhancement of contralateral PMd is accompanied by preserved performance in a stimulus-response matching task. Similarly, <a href=\"#bib34\">Hartwigsen et al.

This study suggests a rapid redistribution of functional weights in order to compensate for interference. Moreover, it has been shown that the interruption of specific pathways has effects far beyond the regions that are directly connected by the pathway (<a href=\"#bib55\">O'Reilly et al., 2013</a>).

We decided on a 500 ms IPI for the control condition following the exclusion of several other alternative IPIs; we decided against reversing the order of conditioning and test stimulus because we have demonstrated in a previous study that this stimulation order leads to long-term depression-like effects (as assessed by examining the impact of further PMv TMS pulses on M1 (<a href=\"#bib8\">Buch et al., 2011</a>); against stimulating both areas at the same time because I-wave interactions may occur at such IPIs (<a href=\"#bib60\">Prabhu et al., 2009</a>); against any time interval below 50 ms because there is evidence of plasticity induction at such intervals within the motor system of freely behaving monkeys (<a href=\"#bib35\">Jackson et al., 2006</a>). Moreover, we noted that long-interval intracortical inhibition (LICI) within M1 has been demonstrated with TMS using IPIs of up to 200 ms (<a href=\"#bib75\">Valls-Sol\u00e9 et al., 1992</a>). Admittedly, other intervals in the hundred milliseconds range might equally have been chosen. Targeting the same cortical areas controlled for the impact of stimulation on brain activity in each component node that the pathway interconnects; if changes in connectivity are simply attributable to stimulation of each area, rather than increased pathway efficacy, then changes in functional connectivity ought to be comparable in Experiment 1 and 2.

Mean Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) coordinates of regions of interest (ROIs) are displayed in <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>. We used a partial correlation analysis approach; for example, when examining pairwise PMv-AIP coupling, we did so after partialling out effects in all other nodes in the circuits: M1, PMd, pSPL, and V3A. Functional coupling measured during grasping task performance confirmed that PMv-M1 coupling was increased following repeated stimulation of those areas (PMv-M1: t(13) = -3.72, p = 0.003). At rest, repeated paired TMS led to increased dorsolateral circuit coupling (AIP-PMv: t(14) = -2.50, p = 0.025; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>), but decreased dorsomedial circuit coupling (PMd-pSPL: t(14) = 2.22, p = 0.04; PMd\u2013M1: t(14) = 2.84, p = 0.013; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). In other words, functional connectivity increased in the extended sensorimotor circuit that includes both PMv and M1 as nodes. At the same time, connectivity decreased in one of the other major sensorimotor circuits that influences M1. Finally, functional connectivity involving area V3A, a relatively early visual area that links to both the dorsomedial and dorsolateral circuits, did not change following repeated paired TMS applied to the PMv-M1 pathway (V3A-AIP: t(14) = 0.51, p = 0.618; V3A-pSPL: t(14) = 1.45, p = 0.170)."

The ROI mask for M1 was based upon the meta-analysis of functional brain imaging data of motor control (<a href=\"#bib49\">Mayka et al., 2006</a>). The PMv ROI location was then identified by finding the region in which BOLD activity was significantly correlated with activity in M1 at the group level, both during rest and during the grasping task. The peak resulting MNI coordinate [\u221258 4 30] was located in what is defined as PMv by <a href=\"#bib49\">Mayka et al. (2006)</a> which had a centre-of-mass at [\u221252 4 24]; more specifically, it lies in the 6v/F5c subdivision of PMv identified by <a href=\"#bib52\">Neubert et al. (2014)</a>. The ROI masks for AIP, PMd, pSPL, and V3A were the same size, but were centred on the group peak activation average coordinates of an fMRI study that employed a similar visually guided grasping task and the same apparatus (<a href=\"#bib31\">Grol et al., 2007</a>).

In Experiment 2, we therefore applied identical numbers of pulses at identical frequencies over the identical brain regions, but we did so at 500 ms IPI. This interval is many times longer than the longest one at which PMv-M1 interactions have been observed (<a href=\"#bib12\">Davare et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Neubert et al., 2010</a>). While such a protocol ought to induce similar changes in each stimulated region, it should not result in their co-activation or in STDP. Using a higher-level analysis (mixed-model ANOVA) with between-subjects factor \u2018PROTOCOL\u2019, we directly contrasted the effects from Experiment 1 and Experiment 2 for each of the analyses conducted. We present the results in <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a> and will go through the findings in the following order: (1) functional connectivity analysis between PMv-M1; (2) PPI analysis between PMv-M1; (3) partial correlation analysis between pairwise network nodes; (4) multiple regression PPI analysis between pairwise network nodes; and (5) dual-regression analysis."

We measured the size of MEPs evoked by TMS of M1 alone and evoked by M1 TMS applied 8 ms after a PMv pulse. Such PMv TMS pulses are known to either augment or diminish the size of the MEP induced by M1 TMS depending on whether or not subjects are making grasping movements or are at rest, respectively (<a href=\"#bib12\">Davare et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Buch et al., 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib8\">2011</a>). To quantify the influence of PMv over M1, we compared the MEPs induced by M1 stimulation alone with MEPs induced by M1 stimulation that was preceded by PMv-stimulation. A TMS-based index of effective connectivity between PMv and M1 was calculated as the ratio of the difference in MEP amplitudes evoked by paired-pulse TMS and single-pulse TMS divided by single-pulse-evoked MEP amplitudes. The PMv-M1 TMS ratio is positive when PMv TMS augments the size of M1 TMS-induced MEPs, but negative when PMv TMS diminishes M1 TMS MEP size. Moreover, the ratio was measured both while subjects were at rest and during the reaching task. In this way, the influence of PMv over M1 could be quantified for both cognitive states, and the direction (facilitatory or inhibitory) and magnitude of effective connectivity could then be compared to functional connectivity as measured with fMRI in Experiment 1."

By means of two correlation analyses and two PPI analyses on fMRI data acquired during the performance of a grasping task, we confirmed our a priori hypothesis that augmented pathway efficacy is mirrored in increases in inter-regional functional connectivity. We specifically show that the activity in PMv was more tightly related to activity in M1 following intervention (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>) and that the influence of PMv on M1 (or the responsiveness of M1 to input from PMv) was increased in response to short-term pathway manipulation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>).

Such an explanation, however, is unlikely to be correct. First, there is no empirical reason to think that TMS stimulation of any one area at a frequency of 0.1 Hz would lead to a protracted change in that area's activity which is detectable by fMRI many minutes later. Moreover, Experiment 2 employed a control procedure, a repeated paired-pulse TMS protocol which precludes the temporal contiguity required for pathway plasticity induction by using a longer IPI (500 ms vs 8 ms in Experiment 1) even though it involved stimulation of the same areas at the same frequency and intensity. Functional connectivity between PMv and M1 was not altered in response to the control procedure in Experiment 2 suggesting that the influence of PMv on M1 in Experiment 1 was indeed attributable to short-term changes in synaptic efficacy."

In addition, we showed that positive functional connectivity between two areas may reflect either facilitatory or inhibitory effective connectivity. Such changes in functional connectivity are not only interesting in their own right but also because different patterns of premotor\u2013M1 interaction are seen in patients who do and who do not recover motor skills after stroke (<a href=\"#bib25\">Gerloff et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Lotze et al., 2006</a>).

This setup constrained rotation movements in the plane between the button box and the target objects. The head was supported with foam wedges. The participants had received extensive training in the reaching-and-grasping task at least one day prior to the first MRI acquisition outside the MRI scanner. The target object, which consisted of a large red cube and a small green cube (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, inset), was held in place through an arc-shaped device positioned over each participant's hips. Participants had been instructed to grasp one of the two cubes, to slide it out of its supporting rail on a rectangular box, and to return it into the same supporting rail. On a given trial, either the large red or the small green cube was to be grasped. A red or green light-emitting diode (LED) in the middle of the rectangular box instructed the participant which cube to grasp. MRI-compatible switches on the device recorded the time at which the object was removed from the supporting rail and the time at which the object was returned into the supporting rail. Control of LEDs and recording of movement-related responses was performed with a computer running Presentation 15.0 (Neurobehavioral Systems, San Francisco, CA). TMS was applied outside the MRI scanner room. Participants walked to the MRI scanner and scanning commenced within 3 to 4 min. Note, previous neurophysiological experiments (<a href=\"#bib8\">Buch et al., 2011</a>) suggest plasticity induction should last at least 1 hr with this protocol and that there were no differences in efficacy immediately after intervention in comparison to +30 min or +60 min post-intervention."

We employed SBCA to assess if paTMS-based modulation of the PMv-M1 pathway dynamically altered the functional interactions of either of these two nodes with each other and/or with other nodes within the reaching and grasping network. We assessed the functional connectivity of a 6 mm diameter seed mask in left PMv with the whole brain (target mask) before and immediately after paTMS and contrasted PMv-M1 connectivity at baseline vs connectivity during post-TMS (for details about statistical analyses see below). The analyses of resting state and grasping task fMRI data were conducted independently.

We used the baseline fMRI data sets of all 23 participants who participated in this study and obtained group-averaged ICA-network maps. For seven participants who contributed to both experimental conditions, only one baseline data set was randomly selected to generate the \u2018group-averaged baseline\u2019 network masks; specifically, 12 \u2018baseline\u2019 data sets were drawn from Experiment 1 and 11 \u2018baseline\u2019 data sets were drawn from Experiment 2. By identifying ICA components based on data from both experiments, we avoided biasing our analysis as a result of any possible differences in the two groups of subjects. At the second stage, two regressions are carried out in which the ICA-derived components are regressed back against the BOLD time series from the baseline and post-plasticity induction periods in the two experiments (8 ms IPI and 500 ms IPI): firstly, to identify subject-specific temporal dynamics for each group-averaged ICA spatial component via a linear model fit (spatial regression) and, secondly, to compute subject-specific associated spatial maps, by using the generated time series as a regressor against the associated fMRI data (temporal regression). At the final stage, the resulting individual spatial component maps are collected across subjects into single 4D files (1 per original ICA network map, with the fourth dimension being subject to identification). The resulting maps\u2014baseline and post-TMS\u2014with one for each of the two experimental conditions, that is, Experiment 1 and Experiment 2\u2014were then tested for voxel-wise statistical significance against the ICA maps generated from all 23 participants (\u2018group-averaged baseline\u2019 fMRI data sets) using nonparametric permutation testing (5000 permutations) (<a href=\"#bib54\">Nichols and Holmes, 2002</a>) and cluster-based thresholding and normalisation of the design matrix columns to unit standard deviation. Voxel-wise testing excluded the cerebellum. The only difference in how resting-state fMRI and grasping task fMRI were treated lay in the dimensionality estimation of ICA. The number of components was estimated automatically for both resting-state fMRI and task-positive fMRI using the Laplace approximation to the Bayesian evidence for a probabilistic principal component model (<a href=\"#bib4\">Beckmann and Smith, 2005</a>), which resulted in 22 and 15 independent components for resting-state and task-positive fMRI, respectively."

(<a href=\"#bib3\">Baumer et al., 2009</a>, Clin Neurophysiol) did indeed show different patterns of connectivity between PMv and M1 in response to varying conditioning stimulus intensities and an inhibitory effect of PMv on M1 was demonstrated for a PMv conditioning pulse with an intensity of 110% of resting motor threshold at rest (see also: <a href=\"#bib8\">Buch et al., 2011</a>, J Neurosci). Importantly, we also chose a PMv conditioning pulse of 110% RMT and we concur with Baumer and colleagues in finding that it predominantly causes inhibition of M1-induced MEPs at rest. However, just like the reviewer, we agree that influences other than inhibitory ones are likely to be at play. In line with the reviewer\u2019s suspicion we have reported that facilitation of MEPs during the grasping task is also seen (<a href=\"#bib8\">Buch et al., 2011</a>, J Neurosci). In line with the editorial guidance we received we have noted this fact at the beginning of the Results section where we have cited the work of Baumer and colleagues. We have written the following:"

In the present paragraph the reviewer almost appears to argue that we should expect that different connections are stimulated when subjects are at rest or in a task state, but as we have already explained in the previous paragraph we know that there is only one main type of connection between premotor cortex and M1, a glutamatergic one that synapses on both pyramidal neurons and inhibitory interneurons. This means that there is no \u201c'at rest' sub-circuit\u201d within PMv and M1 or no \u201csubtypes of connection\u201d from PMv to M1; there rather are excitatory connections between PMv and M1 that have a variety of targets within M1. Strengthening this single type of connection while subjects are at rest is already known to lead to subsequent increments in facilitatory influences of PMv over M1 when subjects are subsequently engaged in a task and to subsequent increments in inhibitory influences of PMv over M1 when subjects are subsequently at rest (<a href=\"#bib8\">Buch et al., 2011</a>, J Neurosci). Again, the reviewer was surely correct in their previous paragraph when they suggested that it is just that different effects of stimulation are more visible or detectable, using the very indirect indices of neural activity furnished by fMRI and TMS, depending on subjects\u2019 cognitive state. Our present fMRI results can be interpreted from the same perspective; some changes in connectivity are simply more visible when subjects are at rest."

Moreover, excitation of a smaller volume of neural tissue by means of paired microwire stimulation (PMv-M1) in macaques has also been shown to exert both facilitatory and inhibitory effects on corticospinal outputs that change in weight with different cognitive states, anaesthetised and behaving (<a href=\"#bib60\">Prabhu, 2009</a>, J Physiol). Our previous studies and other studies investigating PMv-M1 connectivity have shown that a change in behavioural context is sufficient to cause a complete reversal of the influence exerted by PMv over M1 (<a href=\"#bib7\">Buch et al., 2010</a>, J Neurosci; <a href=\"#bib8\">Buch et al., 2011</a>, J Neurosci; <a href=\"#bib13\">Davare et al., 2009</a>, J Physiol), even in the absence of a change in stimulation parameters. The change from facilitation to inhibition is driven by a shift in subpopulation weights and unlikely to be driven by independent PMv-M1 circuits.

Unfortunately, this means we have to disregard temporal information as a factor of interest in the fMRI analysis. It is unlikely that the temporal resolution of fMRI, particularly in the block-based design we used, would enable determination of whether or not coupling between brain areas is occurring exactly instantaneously or is occurring with an 8 ms lag. Instead such questions of directional influences of one brain area over another are perhaps best determined by probing connectivity with a very high temporal resolution technique such as further pulses of TMS (<a href=\"#bib8\">Buch et al., 2011</a>, J Neurosci).

It is possible that these accessory decreases in distant connections fulfil similar \u201ccompensatory\u201d roles. Inhibitory plasticity might accompany excitatory plasticity in order to stabilise neural networks involved in learning (Vogels et al., Science, 2011). Vogels et al offer a solution to the question of how the careful balance of excitatory and inhibitory inputs into a cortical neuron could self-organize within the activity dynamics of neuronal networks. They suggest that inhibitory spike timing-dependent plasticity could balance excitatory inputs. Learning or the formation of associative excitatory-excitatory connections in such networks would require the co-adaptation of excitatory and inhibitory synapses. Although Vogels\u2019 and colleagues\u2019 ideas largely make predictions about structural and functional properties of local neural circuits, the results of this experiment could be taken to suggest that similar principles apply to the network and systems level."

It remains to be determined how exactly movement selection is biased towards dorsolateral or dorsomedial streams and whether this is a categorical or a gradient process. The study of multi-sensory integration has generated some theoretical constructs for how integration of information from two different streams might be achieved (Ernst and Banks, Nature, 2002). In this framework different inputs are combined according to maximum likelihood estimation. Hence a channel providing more reliable information for example because of higher signal-to-noise ratio might then be guiding movement selection more strongly with the weights being inversely proportional to the variance of the signal from the respective channels. If the dorsomedial and dorsolateral visuomotor pathways compete for guiding motor control then enhancement of information processing in one of the pathways might suppress the other stream."

Nevertheless collecting the data required the rapidly successive use of several pieces of equipment and procedures including electromyography, neuronavigation, transcranial magnetic stimulation, use of bespoke grasping apparatus in the magnetic resonance imaging environment, and functional magnetic resonance imaging. All of this was extremely challenging in a busy research hospital environment. We would, however, like to draw attention to the results published as Buch, Johnen et al. (2011) where we demonstrated prolonged changes in synaptic efficacy for more than one hour. The measurements of synaptic efficacy in that study were, however, obtained in a very different way. Instead of measuring whole brain activity coupling with fMRI we recorded the impact of the plasticity induction protocol on subsequent PMv TMS pulses on M1. We showed that their effect was enhanced for more than one hour after plasticity induction. We have noted this in the revised manuscript (see below). For the rest, we agree that it would have been very interesting to track the effects over multiple post-fMRI sessions. For the current study, we focussed our design and analysis on the first time points following intervention to maximise power for the pre-post analysis. We are planning to address the point of longevity of changes in functional connectivity in future studies."
