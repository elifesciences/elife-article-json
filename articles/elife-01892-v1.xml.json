Dengue and other flaviviruses commandeer the host cell\u2019s RNA degradation machinery to generate the small flaviviral RNA (sfRNA), a noncoding RNA that induces cytopathicity and pathogenesis. Host cell exonuclease Xrn1 likely loads on the 5\u2032 end of viral genomic RNA and degrades processively through \u223c10 kB of RNA, halting near the 3\u2032 end of the viral RNA. The surviving RNA is the sfRNA. We interrogated the architecture of the complete Dengue 2 sfRNA, identifying five independently-folded RNA structures, two of which quantitatively confer Xrn1 resistance. We developed an assay for real-time monitoring of Xrn1 resistance that we used with mutagenesis and RNA folding experiments to show that Xrn1-resistant RNAs adopt a specific fold organized around a three-way junction.

In particular, a junction formed by three RNA helixes is critical for stopping the enzyme in its tracks, leaving the disease-associated sfRNA behind. A single mutation in the Dengue RNA disrupts the structure of the three-helix junction and allows the enzyme to completely destroy the RNA. A similar mutation was also made in the West Nile virus RNA and when human cells were infected with the mutated West Nile virus, the short sfRNAs were not produced. Treatments or vaccines targeting this structure may therefore help reduce illness associated with Dengue and related viruses."

The capped but non-polyadenylated viral genomic RNA (gRNA) encodes a single open reading frame (ORF), flanked by structured 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 untranslated regions (UTRs). Translation of the FV ORF produces a single polypeptide that is processed by both viral and cellular proteases to yield ten viral proteins (<a href=\"#bib12\">Fields et al., 2013</a>).

These subgenomic flaviviral RNAs (sfRNAs) contain most of the 3\u2032UTR of the FV gRNA and play an important role in regulating the switch between translation and replication of the viral genome (<a href=\"#bib29\">Lin et al., 2004</a>). Production of sfRNAs is an evolutionarily-conserved trait in arthropod-borne FV\u2019s and its accumulation is directly linked to human disease (<a href=\"#bib41\">Pijlman et al., 2008</a>). Importantly, through still poorly-understood mechanisms, sfRNA controls WNV\u2019s ability to evoke cytopathicity in mammalian cell culture and the onset of pathogenesis in fetal mice (<a href=\"#bib41\">Pijlman et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Liu et al., 2014</a>). Virological studies of sfRNAs from WNV, DENV (<a href=\"#bib31\">Liu et al., 2010</a>) and other flaviviruses showed that they disrupt aspects of the immune response, affecting RNAi mechanisms (<a href=\"#bib45\">Schnettler et al., 2012</a>), mRNA turnover pathways (<a href=\"#bib36\">Moon et al., 2012</a>), and the type-I interferon response (<a href=\"#bib46\">Schuessler et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Chang et al., 2013</a>). The importance of sfRNAs in FV-induced disease raised questions about the mechanism by which these RNAs are produced and maintained at levels approaching or exceeding those of viral gRNA (<a href=\"#bib11\">Fan et al., 2011</a>). Several studies showed that sfRNAs form by viral manipulation of the host cell\u2019s RNA turnover machinery. Specifically, sfRNAs form as the result of incomplete degradation of viral gRNA by the cytoplasmic exoribonuclease Xrn1 (<a href=\"#bib15\">Funk et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Silva et al., 2010</a>). Xrn1 is a processive, 5\u2032\u21923\u2032 exonuclease responsible for degradation of roughly 30\u201340% of mRNA in actively dividing cells (<a href=\"#bib24\">Jones et al., 2012</a>). sfRNA production occurs when viral gRNA is loaded into Xrn1 for decay. Xrn1 degrades through nearly the entire viral gRNA before stalling near the beginning of the 3\u2032UTR; what remains is an sfRNA (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>)."

Progression of Xrn1 along an RNA being degraded is hypothesized to be powered by a combination of electrostatic interactions specific for 5\u2032-monophosphorylated RNAs and by repetitious \u03c0-stacking of RNA nucleobases with aromatic residues in the enzyme\u2032s active site (<a href=\"#bib23\">Jinek et al., 2011</a>). These features enable Xrn1 to degrade through complex RNA structures, including decapped mRNAs and ribosomal RNA (rRNA).

Current evidence suggests that specific RNA sequences and structures located in the 3\u2032UTR of different FVs are the signals that cause Xrn1 to stall. Presumably, these RNAs have unique features that make them impervious to Xrn1. It has been proposed that both stem-loop (SL) and dumbbell (DB) type structures found in the FVs 3\u2032UTRs can halt Xrn1 progression (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Pijlman et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Funk et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Silva et al., 2010</a>). Of these putatively resistant structures, the SL elements from WNV (<a href=\"#bib15\">Funk et al., 2010</a>) and YFV (<a href=\"#bib48\">Silva et al., 2010</a>) have been explored. Phylogenetic studies identified \u223c19 conserved nucleotides within a secondary structure predicted to include a three-helix junction, a downstream hairpin, and an RNA pseudoknot (PK) (<a href=\"#bib41\">Pijlman et al., 2008</a>). The presence of the PK is supported by virological studies (<a href=\"#bib48\">Silva et al., 2010</a>), and this led to the proposal that these are \u2018rigid\u2019 structures. However, our current understanding of these RNA structures does not explain their ability to halt Xrn1 and in the case of DENV, the relationship of the structure of the 3\u2032UTR to its Xrn1-resistant properties is unexplored."

Chemical probing of the global structure of the 3\u2032UTR revealed five independently-folded RNA structures within the longer RNA. We recapitulated Xrn1 resistance in vitro and developed a new fluorescence-based assay capable of quantitative, real-time monitoring of RNA degradation by Xrn1 and resistance to the enzyme. We used this assay to explore the Xrn1-resistant behavior of RNA structures throughout the DENV2 3\u2032UTR, identifying two Xrn1-resistant RNA structures that confer quantitative protection to downstream segments of RNA. Using one of these structures we developed a series of mutants and precisely mapped where Xrn1 halts, revealing that a specifically-structured three-way junction is a functionally critical element of Xrn1 resistance. Similar mutations within the Xrn1-resistant structures of another FV (the Kunjin strain of WNV), also impair the formation of sfRNAs in vitro and in infected human cells. Cumulatively, these results set the stage for detailed mechanistic and structural studies of these unique, disease-related viral RNAs."

We refer to them as \u2018Xrn1-resistant RNAs\u2019 (xrRNAs), and we modify this term by including the name of the virus in which the xrRNA is found. When more than one xrRNA is present in a viral RNA, we propose numbering them sequentially. Thus, the 5\u2032 most discrete Xrn1-resistant structure in the Dengue virus genome is named \u2018DENV2xrRNA1.\u2019 This nomenclature builds on and is consistent with existing nomenclature and has several advantages: Distinguishes between the discrete RNA structures that resist Xrn1 (xrRNAs) and the larger product of resistance that includes additional sequences of diverse function (sfRNAs). Provides a consistent convention across viral species and independent of idiosyncratic naming of putative secondary structure elements. Is consistent with the accepted practice of classifying and naming RNAs based on function. For example, IRES RNAs are often part of a larger 5\u2032 UTR and may comprise a collection of secondary structural elements, but they are named as discrete functional entities within the 5\u2032 UTR and are identified by their source (e.g., \u2018HCV IRES RNA\u2019). The term \u2018xrRNA\u2019, modified by source, follows this convention. Allows matching of the name of the xrRNA to the sfRNA it produces. For example, during Kunjin virus infection 4 putative sfRNAs are made (sfRNA1, sfRNA2, etc). With our proposed nomenclature, the name of the xrRNA structure logically corresponds to the product it makes (i.e., sfRNA1 is made by xRNA1, sfRNA2 by xrRNA2 etc). Because this naming convention is based on function and position, this nomenclature is readily extended to xrRNAs that could someday be found in contexts other than flaviviruses. <b>Outline of the naming strategy we propose for Xrn1-Resistant RNAs and application to test RNAs in this study.</b> (<b>A</b>) As shown, we propose a naming strategy that includes designations for an Xrn1-resistant RNA\u2019s function, viral origin, position within in a FV 3\u2032UTR and the presence upstream and downstream RNA sequences.

Addition of BdRppH and KlXrn1 to a reaction containing this test RNA as well as a synthetically generated 5\u2032-monophosphorylated 24 nucleotide-long internal control RNA (24-mer) resulted in complete degradation of the control RNA and truncation of the test RNA to a discrete product, indicative of Xrn1 resistance (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Because the enzymes used in this experiment were pure (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), this experiment establishes that Xrn1 resistance is conferred entirely by the SL II test RNA (no auxiliary proteins are needed). We therefore conclude that RNA elements from within the DENV 3\u2032UTR as short as \u223c60 nucleotides can resist Xrn1 and that these RNAs operate effectively outside the context of the viral 3\u2032UTR. Interestingly, we observed no enzymatic resistance using other commercially available exonucleases (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), suggesting this RNA is specifically resistant to Xrn1. For clarity, here we refer to this (and other) discrete RNAs using the functionally-descriptive name of \u2018Xrn1-resistant RNAs\u2019 (xrRNAs) in order to distinguish them from the longer sfRNAs. To facilitate discussion of xrRNAs in this and future work we propose a simple naming scheme for xrRNAs that is outlined in the (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Using this nomenclature, we here refer to the first Xrn1-resistant structure in the DENV 3\u2032 UTR as \u2018DVxrRNA1\u2019."

                                "text": "To augment the aforementioned assay and enable monitoring of Xrn1 resistance in a quantitative and time-resolved manner, we engineered a fluorescence-based assay based on the malachite green (MG) aptamer (<a href=\"#bib17\">Grate and Wilson, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Baugh et al., 2000</a>). The fluorescence of the triphenylmethylene MG dye is quenched when free in solution but dramatically increases when bound to the aptamer. This feature provides a fluorescent readout of the MG aptamer\u2019s integrity (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Babendure et al., 2003</a>). We designed RNA substrates with the 40 nt-long MG aptamer placed downstream of each RNA structure to be tested for Xrn1 resistance (following a 4 nucleotide-long poly(U) linker) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). In solution with MG, these RNAs produce an \u223c2300-fold increase in MG fluorescence over free dye (<a href=\"#bib3\">Babendure et al., 2003</a>). If addition of RppH and Xrn1 results in degradation of the aptamer-tagged RNA (no Xrn1 resistance), fluorescence disappears over time (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>, bottom). If the RNA being tested provides Xrn1 resistance, the MG aptamer remains intact and fluorescence persists (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>, top). A fuller description of the development and testing of this technique will be reported elsewhere (Chapman et al., in preparation). We used this fluorescence assay to test the Xrn1 resistance properties of the five discrete structures located within the DENV2 3\u2032UTR (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). The 5\u2032 leader of each RNA consisted of nucleotides 10,273\u201310,304 of the DENV 3\u2032UTR, which is degraded when present before DVxrRNA1 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>) and each had the MG aptamer downstream. For DVxrRNA1, the test RNA was thus named (+31)-DVxrRNA1-MG and other input RNAs were named following the same convention (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). As expected, upon the addition of both enzymes (+31)-DVxrRNA1-MG maintains high fluorescence throughout the course of the experiment, consistent with Xrn1 resistance (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). Likewise, SL IV demonstrated resistance to Xrn1-mediated decay (DVxrRNA2). In contrast, reactions with the DB2 and the 3\u2032 terminal stem loop [test RNAs: (+31)-DVDB2-MG and (+31)-DV3SL-MG] show a decrease in fluorescence that is consistent with no Xrn1 resistance. The construct encoding DB1 [(+31)-DB1-MG] shows more intermediate behavior."

In the case of the DB1-containing test RNA, the full-length RNA is partially depleted however there is no truncated product as would be expected if the DB1 sequence itself were Xrn1-resistant. The persistence of full-length RNA in this reaction suggests that Xrn1 may not be able to efficiently load onto this RNA and the lower intensity of the band suggests that when Xrn1 does load it degrades the RNA entirely. As &gt;3 nucleotides of single-stranded RNA are required for Xrn1 to efficiently load on an RNA substrate (<a href=\"#bib23\">Jinek et al., 2011</a>), the behavior of the DB1-containing RNA may indicate an alternate secondary structure that precludes the 5\u2032 end of this RNA from being recognized by Xrn1. Cumulatively, our fluorescence and gel-based assays confirm two xrRNA structures in the DENV2 3\u2032UTR that offer nearly quantitative protection to downstream RNA, of these we chose DVxrRNA1 as an archetype for deeper analyses."

Substrate recognition by Xrn1 requires a 5\u2032 monophosphate at the end of an RNA and each catalytic cycle regenerates this chemical species. Could Xrn1 resistance be based in part upon malfunction of this process? If so, the products formed by xrRNAs might not bear a 5\u2032 monophosphate and would be precluded from further degradation. We determined the phosphorylation state of the 5\u2032 end of Xrn1-resistant products formed by DVxrRNA1 using the procedure outlined in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a> and described in the Supplementary Description of \u2018Materials and methods\u2019. Briefly, after \u2018product\u2019 and \u2018control\u2019 RNAs were isolated, half of each sample was dephosphoylated using calf intestinal alkaline phosphotase (\u2018CIP\u2019ed\u2019). We then compared the ability of T4 polynucleotide kinase (PNK) to ligate a radioactive phosphate to the CIP\u2019ed vs un-CIP\u2019ed RNAs, expecting that the presence of a 5\u2032-monophosphate would interfere with effective phosphorylation. In these experiments we included both a synthetically 5\u2032 monophosphorylated 24-mer RNA and a 5\u2032 hydroxylated 40-mer DNA as controls. As predicted, the dephosphorylated products of the DVxrRNA1 \u2018control\u2019 RNA are better substrates for phosphorylation than their un-CIP\u2019ed counterparts (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>, lanes A and B). Control reactions involving the synthetic 5\u2032-monophosphorylated 24-mer produce similar results (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>, lanes E and F). Similarly, the CIP\u2019ed Xrn1-resistant product RNAs are better substrates for phosphorylation than their un-CIP\u2019ed counterparts. These results indicate that the RNA product of Xrn1 resistance are 5\u2032-monophosphorylated and are still viable substrates for Xrn1 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>, lanes C and D). Xrn1 resistance is thus not the result of chemical \u2018mis-step\u2019 of the exonuclease."

Mutant 3, in which the potential for a PK is restored, has an activity at 90% of WT.

In mutant 7, mutation of the natural G-C rich stem of P1 into a series of five A-U base pairs abrogates Xrn1 resistance, consistent with the need for a P1 helix of defined sequence. In contrast Xrn1 resistance is maintained in mutant 8, in which the C-G base at the base of P2 is exchanged for a U-A base pair.

To test this, we subjected the mutants described above to non-denaturing (native) gel electrophoresis, which is sensitive to changes in the global structure of a folded RNA (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Woodson and Koculi, 2009</a>). In gels containing 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, mutants of DVxrRNA1 display a spectrum of electrophoretic behaviors, indicating a variety of effects on RNA structure. One mutant that stood out was the non-Xrn1-resistant mutant 6 (C10320\u2192G) (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>). In EDTA-containing gels this mutant migrated at the same rate as WT DVxrRNA1, however in gels containing MgCl<sub>2</sub> mutant 6 demonstrates significantly retarded mobility, indicative of altered folding of the RNA. This suggests that a single point mutation made in the DVxrRNA1 three-helix junction is capable of disrupting a Mg<sup>2+</sup>-dependent tertiary fold that is linked to Xrn1 resistance. To further examine this behavior we used chemical probing experiments to assess the structure of the mutant 6 RNA. The normalized NMIA and DMS reactivity profiles of the WT and mutant 6 MG aptamer-tagged RNAs are similar but with several marked differences (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A,D</a>). These data reveal that the WT and mutant 6 RNA have similar secondary structures (consistent with the EDTA-containing native gels, <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C</a>) but indicate that the C10320\u2192G mutation affects several structural elements and changes the global fold of the RNA (consistent with the MgCl<sub>2</sub>-containing native gel <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C</a>). These findings support the conclusion that the DVxrRNA1 three-helix junction organizes a specific structure that is essential for Xrn1 resistance."

Because sfRNA formation is readily explored in the context of the Kunjin strain of WNV (WNV<sub>KUN</sub>), we used this virus system to assess the generality and relevance. We first tested two proposed xrRNA structures located within in the WNV<sub>KUN</sub> 3\u2032UTR (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10A</a>) for Xrn1 resistance, again using a 31 nucleotide-long leader. Both of these RNAs, WNV<sub>KUN</sub>xrRNA1 (nucleotides 10,499\u201310,574) and WNV<sub>KUN</sub>xrRNA2 (nucleotides 10,659\u201310,728), demonstrate resistance to Xrn1 in vitro (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10B</a>). We also tested versions of these RNAs containing C\u2192G point mutations made in positions analogous to the mutation (mutant 6) that abolishes Xrn1 resistance in DVxrRNA1 (C10519\u2192G in WNV<sub>KUN</sub>xrRNA1 and C10680\u2192G in WNV<sub>KUN</sub>xrRNA2) (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10B,C</a>). We observe that the C\u2192G point mutation in WNV<sub>KUN</sub>xrRNA1 partially compromises Xrn1 resistance, while the same point mutation made in WNV<sub>KUN</sub>xrRNA2 abolishes resistance.

We infected human 293T cells with both wild-type and mutant WNV<sub>KUN</sub> and assessed sfRNA accumulation at 48 hours post infection (h.p.i.). Northern blots of total RNA isolates show that infection by wild-type WNV produces three prominent sfRNA species (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11</a>). Based on their size, the largest of these RNAs, sfRNA1 and sfRNA2, are the result of Xrn1 pausing at WNV<sub>KUN</sub>xrRNA1 and WNV<sub>KUN</sub>xrRNA2, respectively. The third species, sfRNA3 corresponds with previous observations of Xrn1 stopping prior to DB1 of WNV<sub>KUN</sub>. Infections using a WNV<sub>KUN</sub> harboring a C10519\u2192G point mutation in WNV<sub>KUN</sub>xrRNA1 results in a significant and reproducible decrease in sfRNA1 formation, corresponding with the incomplete loss of Xrn1 resistance we observe in vitro. Likewise, infection with WNV<sub>KUN</sub> containing a C10680\u2192G point mutation in WNV<sub>KUN</sub>xrRNA2 results in the disappearance of sfRNA2, and again mirrors our findings in vitro. Finally, infection by a WNV<sub>KUN</sub> containing both C10519\u2192G and C10680\u2192G point mutations produces low levels of sfRNA1 and essentially no sfRNA2. The more substantial decrease in sfRNA1 formation in the double mutant as opposed to the C10519\u2192G single mutant may suggest a degree of cooperation between the two xrRNA structures although establishing such an interaction will require additional experimentation. Cumulatively our results show that the structural and functional features we observe have applicability across xrRNAs from diverse FV\u2019s and that the structural characteristics that confer Xrn1 resistance in vitro corresponds directly to the accumulation of disease-causing sfRNAs during viral infection."

These elements contain previously-proposed secondary structure stem-loop elements SL II and SL IV. We did not observe resistance from the DB elements in vitro; if they confer Xrn1 resistance during infection this may require interaction with a protein factor. The position of the two confirmed xrRNAs is consistent with a role in protecting downstream sequences and structures, including the DBs and 3\u2032SL from degradation. Many other FV\u2032s also contain two neighboring xrRNA structures at the 5\u2032 end of their 3\u2032UTR\u2032s (a notable exception is YF, which only contains one) (<a href=\"#bib41\">Pijlman et al., 2008</a>). The evolutionary conservation of this pattern suggests that downstream RNA elements are critical for sfRNA function and viral success; however, the nearly quantitative resistance to Xrn1 demonstrated by these structures begs the question: why there are two xrRNAs in series when seemingly one should suffice? Perhaps two xrRNAs provide redundancy to ensure production of the sfRNA or perhaps each xrRNA is tuned to operate most efficiently under different intracellular conditions encountered during the infection cycle (<a href=\"#bib56\">Villordo and Gamarnik, 2013</a>). Our data suggest that the PK interaction is stable in only one of the two xrRNAs in DENV2, hinting that subtle functional differences may exist between the two structures. Furthermore, our data from cells infected with mutant Kunjin Virus hint at cooperation or coupling between these elements."

The presence of multiple conserved bases within the three-way junction, including several unpaired nucleotides, suggests that this core organizes the tertiary fold of the RNA. This idea is supported by that fact that this fold can be disrupted by a point mutation made in one of the unpaired nucleotides within the junction. The fold this junction organizes is important for Xrn1 resistance, and while it may be further stabilized by a PK, this tertiary interaction does not appear to be necessary for Xrn1 resistance in vitro (at least in the context of DVxrRNA1)."

                        "text": "Full understanding of the basis of Xrn1 resistance will require a high-resolution structure of an xrRNA, but our results allow some predictions. First, examination of the three-way junction features and comparisons with other RNA junctions suggest that it forms a \u2018type-C\u2019 three-helix junction in which P1 and P2 coaxially stack and P3 assumes an acute angle relative to P1 (<a href=\"#bib28\">Lescoute and Westhof, 2006</a>). Based on this, we predict that folding of the junction (in the absence of any tertiary interactions) would bring L3 close to the base of P1. Formation of the PK would further stabilize this helical arrangement. How does this conformation result in Xrn1 resistance? We speculate that as the 5\u2032 end of the RNA is drawn into the active site, the enzyme encounters a structure formed by the spatially adjacent P1 and P3 helices that prevents the helicase activity of the enzyme from unwinding the RNA. <a href=\"#bib23\">Jinek et al. (2011)</a> have proposed that RNA entering the active site of Xrn1 is unwound when pulled through a narrow channel formed by the \u03b11 helix and an adjacent loop. The xrRNA may have evolved an unusual and specific structure that prevents these features of the enzyme from effectively interacting with and unwinding the RNA. Such a structure need not be rigid or even exceptionally thermodynamically stable, but must be arranged in such a way that the enzyme cannot process it."

One interesting idea is that sfRNA production causes dysregulation of Xrn1-dependent mRNA turnover in the infected cell. Indeed, studies of Dengue and Kunjin virus infections showed that sfRNA production stabilizes mRNAs by inhibiting Xrn1 (<a href=\"#bib36\">Moon et al., 2012</a>). One possible explanation of this effect could be that Xrn1 remains bound to xrRNAs, perhaps locking the enzyme in an inactive conformation or sequestering it from other substrates. There is evidence that an RNase L-inhibiting RNA of poliovirus operates as a competitive inhibitor through this type of mechanism (<a href=\"#bib25\">Keel et al., 2012</a>). However, in several of our experiments Xrn1 processes over 150 copies of the xrRNA substrate and over 300 copies of the 24-mer control RNA, indicating multiple turnover by the enzyme. Nonetheless, we did find conditions under which afforded some protection to an Xrn1 substrates <i>in trans</i> (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), but we have been unable to obtain evidence of formation of a stable complex between a resistant RNA and Xrn1 in a purified system (data not shown). Overall, these observations argue against a simple binding model for sfRNA-induced changes in mRNA turnover and suggest that sfRNA may act as a reversible inhibitor of Xrn1, perhaps changing the kinetics of the enzyme in infected cells."

The observation that mutation of a single conserved nucleotide in the three-way junction completely abrogates Xrn1 resistance and sfRNA formation in human cells suggests that only a few key intermolecular interactions need to be altered to prevent xrRNA folding and function. Perhaps mutations or deletions in individual xrRNA elements present in other FV genomes could be become part of a general route toward the development of attenuated vaccines."

To determine the phosphorylation state of Xrn1-resistant RNA products and accompanying controls, fractions of these samples were with first treated with calf-intestinal alkaline phosphotase (CIP) (line iii, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). CIP reactions were carried out using \u223c5 \u03bcg of each RNA in a reaction performed as prescribed by the manufacturer of the enzyme (NEB). CIP\u2019ed RNAs were purified by phenol chloroform extraction, washed once with 24:1 chloroform to isoamyl alcohol and then ethanol precipitated (70% ice cold EtOH, 300 mM NaOAC pH 5.2, \u221220\u00b0C, 2 hr). CIP\u2019ed RNAs were then resuspended and quantified. All RNAs: CIP\u2019ed and un-CIP\u2019ed, \u2018product\u2019, \u2018control\u2019 and \u201924-mer\u2019 were then entered into phosphorylation reactions containing 50 pmol \u03b3-<sup>32</sup>P-ATP and 8 pmol of each RNA (line iv, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>).1 pmol of an synthetic, 5\u2032-hydroxylated 40mer DNA was included to serve as a internal control for PNK activity. RNAs were then phosphorylated using T4 PNK (NEB) in the buffer supplied by the manufacturer for 1.5 hr at 37\u00b0C. Individual samples were diluted and then passed over homemade G-25 Sephadex columns to remove unincorporated \u03b3-<sup>32</sup>P-ATP. An equal volume of each reaction was the subjected to 15% dPAGE. The resulting gels were analyzed by phosphorimaging as described above."

It was agreed that the manuscript would be significantly elevated if it were shown that the three-helix junction structure was important for viral replication of sfRNA levels in a cell-based assay. Alternatively, if a second Xrn1 resistant structure from a different virus was analyzed perhaps in a bit less detail, it would establish the generality or not of the observations you have made. A revised paper must address either of these points."

First, we interrogated the Xrn1-resistant properties of two putative Xrn1-resistant RNA structures (xrRNAs) present in the 3\u2019UTR of a flavivirus related to Dengue: the Kunjin strain of West Nile Virus (WNV<sub>KUN</sub>). We found that these RNA structures also resist Xrn1 in vitro and their function demonstrates similar sensitivity to mutations made in conserved sequence elements. These data are contained in <a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>. Second, because WNV<sub>KUN</sub> is a convenient strain for cell-based assays, we used it to correlate the observations we made regarding Xrn1 resistance in vitro with the formation of sfRNAs during infection. Specifically, we introduced mutations in the virus that match those we studied in vitro (in the three-way junction), and observed that these decrease sfRNA formation in infected cells. These data are contained in <a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11</a>. As a result of including these experiments, we added two authors, who have read and fully agree with the manuscript. We believe these experiments establish the generality of our observations and the direct link between the presence of Xrn1-resistant RNA structures and the production of sfRNAs in human cell lines and thus fulfill the requirements for resubmission of our manuscript."
