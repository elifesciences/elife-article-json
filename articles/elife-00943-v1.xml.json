In addition to transporting vesicular cargos, dynein helps to organize MTs within MT networks such as mitotic spindles. How dynein performs such non-canonical functions is unknown. Here we demonstrate that dynein crosslinks and slides anti-parallel MTs in vitro. Surprisingly, a minimal dimeric motor lacking a tail domain and associated subunits can cause MT sliding. Single molecule imaging reveals that motors pause and frequently reverse direction when encountering an anti-parallel MT overlap, suggesting that the two motor domains can bind both MTs simultaneously. In the mitotic spindle, inward microtubule sliding by dynein counteracts outward sliding generated by kinesin-5, and we show that a tailless, dimeric motor is sufficient to drive this activity in mammalian cells. Our results identify an unexpected mechanism for dynein-driven microtubule sliding, which differs from filament sliding mechanisms described for other motor proteins."

In particular, both \u2018mother\u2019 and \u2018daughter\u2019 cells require full sets of chromosomes, which must first be duplicated, and then evenly distributed between the cells. Protein filaments called microtubules form a network that helps to accurately segregate the chromosomes. Microtubules emanate from structures at each end of the dividing cell known as spindle poles; after the chromosomes have duplicated, the microtubules latch onto them and align the pairs in the middle of the cell. As the two cells separate, microtubules at opposite spindle poles reel in one chromosome from each pair."

When mammalian cells enter mitosis, dynein is needed to remodel the prophase MT network (<a href=\"#bib53\">Rusan et al., 2002</a>), and at later stages dynein assists in organizing MTs to form focused spindle poles (<a href=\"#bib22\">Heald et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Merdes et al., 1996</a>). Dynein also generates an inward force within the spindle that counteracts an outward force generated by kinesin-5 and kinesin-12 motors (<a href=\"#bib38\">Mitchison et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Tanenbaum et al., 2008</a>, <a href=\"#bib61\">2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Ferenz et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Vanneste et al., 2009</a>). The balance of these forces is important for normal spindle assembly (<a href=\"#bib63\">Tanenbaum and Medema, 2010</a>). In cell extracts, dynein also has been shown to organize MTs into aster-like structures (<a href=\"#bib69\">Verde et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Gaglio et al., 1996</a>), drive the fusion of two closely positioned spindles into a single bipolar spindle (<a href=\"#bib17\">Gatlin et al., 2009</a>), and transport stabilized MT seeds to the spindle pole (<a href=\"#bib22\">Heald et al., 1996</a>).

One possibility is that dynein is anchored at fixed subcellular sites through its tail domain and moves processively along MTs through the cytoplasm. However, since the \u2018cargo\u2019 is sufficiently large in this instance, the MT themselves would move, rather than the cargo (<a href=\"#bib72\">W\u00fchr et al., 2009</a>). Such a mechanism may also function during spindle positioning, where cortically-anchored dynein pulls on spindle MTs (<a href=\"#bib16\">Galli and van den Heuvel, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Kiyomitsu and Cheeseman, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Kotak et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Laan et al., 2012</a>), as well as during centrosome separation, where dynein is anchored to the nuclear envelope (<a href=\"#bib56\">Splinter et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Bolhy et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Raaijmakers et al., 2012</a>)."

To generate sliding between two MTs, an individual dynein motor, a dimer of two heavy chains, could use its two motor domains to walk along one MT and employ a second MT binding domain to transport a \u2018cargo MT\u2019. Axonemal dyneins function in this manner to produce MT sliding in cilia and flagella. Several classes of kinesin utilize a similar mechanism for crosslinking and sliding MTs (<a href=\"#bib57\">Straube et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Braun et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Fink et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Seeger and Rice, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Su et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Weaver et al., 2011</a>). However, there is currently no evidence suggesting that cytoplasmic dynein contains a secondary MT binding site outside of the motor domain. A second model is that dynein could crossbridge and slide MTs by forming small oligomers or co-complexes with other proteins. Kinesin-5, which forms a bipolar tetramer of motor domains, crossbridges and slides MTs by such a mechanism (<a href=\"#bib29\">Kashina et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Kapitein et al., 2005</a>).

Single molecule data of dynein in a MT overlap zone is most consistent with a model in which the two dynein motor domains walk along different MTs to generate sliding. We also show in vivo that a minimal dynein dimer, lacking expected cargo binding interactions, can substitute for native dynein in generating an inward force within the spindle that antagonizes outward MT sliding forces generated by kinesin-5 and kinesin-12. Together, these results show that dynein can slide and organize MTs, using a sliding mechanism that differs from that described for other motor proteins."

After addition of ATP, GST-Dyn1<sub>331kDa</sub> drove robust sliding of transport MTs along the immobilized track MTs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>). The transport MTs frequently moved until they reached the end of the track MT, where they swiveled around an end point on the track MT (asterisk <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). The speed of MT-MT sliding (53 \u00b1 24 nm/s; mean \u00b1 SD; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) was similar to the velocity observed in MT gliding assays (47 \u00b1 11 nm/s; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) with this dynein construct. We found that purified rat brain dynein also produced MT-MT sliding using this same assay, although the movement was slower than surface gliding (10 \u00b1 5 nm/s vs 615 \u00b1 200 nm/s) and characterized by more frequent pausing than MT gliding by surface-bound brain dynein (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, <a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a>). The slower motility may be a result of the much weaker processivity and directionality observed for individual mammalian dyneins in vitro compared to yeast dynein (<a href=\"#bib52\">Ross et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Cho et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Miura et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Ori-McKenney et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Trokter et al., 2012</a>).

Nonetheless, the finding that rat dynein alone is capable of crosslinking and sliding MTs in our assays, shows that this type of motility is an intrinsic ability of the motor."

These experiments revealed that the large majority of MT sliding events involved MTs in an anti-parallel configuration (18 of 21 events, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). To confirm this, we also analyzed MT polarity using the direction of movement of single GFP-tagged dynein motors on the track and transport MT, in cases where the transport MT moved past the end of the track MT. In 21 of 22 cases, the transport and track MTs were anti-parallel to one another. This result is consistent with a model in which dynein binds to an anti-parallel MT overlap with one motor domain on each MT in the overlap. In this configuration, both motor domains walk towards the minus-end of their respective MT, thereby driving sliding of the crosslinked pair of MTs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>)."

                                "text": "The above results demonstrate that GST-dimerized yeast dynein, and the native rat dynein complex, both can crosslink and slide MTs. However, in the case of the minimal, GST-dimerized dynein (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cho and Vale, 2012</a>), it is possible that the artificial, anti-parallel dimerization may allow the two motor domains to crosslink MTs in a manner that would not occur in native dynein dimer. Additionally, the native dynein dimer may utilize a different mechanism, in which it crossbridges MTs through an additional MT binding site, either in the tail of the heavy chain or in one of the dynein accessory subunits. To rigorously examine these possibilities, we tested a truncated dynein molecule that includes its native dimerization domain, but lacks any of its associated subunits. GST-Dyn1<sub>331kDa</sub>, is monomeric in the absence of GST (<a href=\"#bib49\">Reck-Peterson et al., 2006</a>), so we reasoned that a larger portion of the tail domain was necessary for dynein heavy chain dimerization. Prior unpublished observations from our lab indicated that a dynein with a slightly longer N-terminus (Dyn1<sub>387kD</sub>, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>) was processive when fused to GFP (S Reck-Peterson and A Carter, unpublished observations), and processivity is an attribute of a dynein dimer (<a href=\"#bib49\">Reck-Peterson et al., 2006</a>). We overexpressed Dyn1<sub>387kD</sub> from a Gal promoter, and the purified protein revealed no co-purifying accessory subunits by silver staining after SDS-PAGE (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). In sucrose gradients, purified Dyn1<sub>387kD</sub> sedimented at approximately 19S (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>), which is similar in size to the full dynein complex (<a href=\"#bib44\">Paschal et al., 1987</a>), as well as a truncated dimeric dynein (<a href=\"#bib65\">Trokter et al., 2012</a>). Consistent with it being a dimer, single molecule assays revealed robust processive motion of Dyn1<sub>387kD</sub> along microtubules with an average speed of 75 \u00b1 40 nm/s (n = 95) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). Analysis of moving Dyn1<sub>387kD</sub> molecules revealed a very similar single molecule intensity distribution to the entire Dyn1<sub>387kD</sub> population (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>), indicating that the moving particles were not a minor subset of aggregated or oligomerized molecules. Further excluding the presence of multimers, the fluorescence intensities of single gel-filtered Dyn1<sub>387kD</sub> molecules were comparable or even lower in brightness to GST-Dyn1<sub>331kD</sub> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>). The reason for the lower brightness of GFP in Dyn1<sub>387kD</sub> is not clear, although it might be due to fluorescence quenching of nearby fluorphores. Regardless, this result argues that the molecules are not aggregated, and movement is due to dimers and not higher order molecular entities."

To test this possibility, we deleted the canonical MTBD and expressed the protein (Dyn1<sub>387kD \u0394MTBD</sub>). Dyn1<sub>387kD \u0394MTBD</sub> showed no specific association with MTs in a cosedimentation assay (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C,D</a>) and was unable to crosslink MTs (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). Thus, Dyn1<sub>387kD \u0394MTBD</sub> does not possess a MT binding region outside of the motor domain. Together, these results show that a natively dimerized dynein can crosslink and slide MTs in vitro, and that associated chains or an additional MT binding site is not required for this activity. These results strongly support a model in which dynein slides MTs in vitro using only its two motor domains (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>)."

This model would predict that individual dimeric dynein motors would be approximately stationary in a MT overlap zone, as each motor domain generates opposing pulling forces on the two MTs. To test this model, we imaged individual, fluorescently-labeled dynein molecules within an anti-parallel MT overlap. To generate stable anti-parallel overlaps, we crosslinked MTs with GFP-Ase1 (<a href=\"#bib24\">Janson et al., 2007</a>), a protein that crosslinks MTs into anti-parallel bundles with an inter-MT spacing of around 15\u201340 nm (<a href=\"#bib15\">Gaillard et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Roque et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Subramanian et al., 2010</a>).

In the first assay, we evaluated dynein\u2019s ability to drive monopolar spindle formation when kinesin-5 is inhibited before the onset of mitosis. Kinesin-5 inhibition results in the formation of monopolar spindles (<a href=\"#bib3\">Blangy et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Mayer et al., 1999</a>), but this effect is prevented and bipolar spindle formation is restored when dynein is depleted by RNAi (<a href=\"#bib60\">Tanenbaum et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Ferenz et al., 2009</a>). This result has been interpreted as kinesin-5 and dynein producing counteracting sliding forces during spindle formation; when kinesin-5 is inhibited, dynein-induced sliding forces produce an unbalanced inward force that results in the formation of monopolar spindes. We tested whether GST-hDyn could produce this inward sliding force when expressed in cells depleted of dynein heavy chain by RNAi. We monitored dynein RNAi by blotting for the intermediate chain (IC), which is co-depleted with the heavy chain upon knockdown and found that dynein was robustly depleted from cells upon RNAi (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Strikingly, GST-hDyn expression substantially increased the number of monopolar spindles in dynein-depleted, kinesin-5 inhibited cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). These results reveal that GST-hDyn can recapitulate the inward force, normally produced by the endogenous dynein, providing further support that the motor domains alone are sufficient for this function."

During metaphase, two kinesins (kinesin-5 and kinesin-12) provide an outward force on the spindle, which is counterbalanced by an inward force produced by dynein (<a href=\"#bib61\">Tanenbaum et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Vanneste et al., 2009</a>). Thus, unlike in early stages of mitosis, when a kinesin-5 inhibitor is applied at metaphase, it only results in a collapse of the spindle to a monopolar structure in a low percentage of the cells (38 \u00b1 5%) since kinesin-12 can still effectively oppose dynein (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,D</a>). However, in metaphase-arrested cells expressing GST-hDyn, kinesin-5 inhibition resulted in a much greater percentage (88 \u00b1 2%) of cells with monopolar spindles (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,D</a>). While treatment of cells with MG132 might alter the abundance of other MT binding proteins as well in this assay (<a href=\"#bib55\">Song and Rape, 2010</a>), this result suggests that the expression of GST-hDyn increased the total inward force, tipping the balance of forces and resulting in spindle collapse.

To determine if dimerization of the motor domains is required for the inward force generation by dynein in vivo, we fused dynein to FKBP (FKBP-hDyn), which homodimerizes upon addition of the small molecule dimerizer AP20187 (inducing processivity of yeast dynein [<a href=\"#bib49\">Reck-Peterson et al., 2006</a>]), and then performed RNAi rescue experiments. Control cells treated with STLC to inhibit kinesin-5 mostly formed monopolar spindles (87.7 \u00b1 4.5%). As described earlier, depletion of endogenous dynein by RNAi in the presence of STLC decreased the number of monopolar spindles to 46.5 \u00b1 1.5%, consistent with a role for dynein in antagonizing kinesin-5 in bipolar spindle assembly (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). As a control, the dimerizer AP20187 did not significantly affect spindle bipolarity (50.7 \u00b1 1.8% monopolar spindles, p=0.16) in STLC-treated, dynein-depleted cells in the absence of FKBP-hDyn (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). Next, cells expressing FKBP-hDyn were depleted of endogenous dynein by RNAi and treated with STLC. Expression of FKBP-hDyn in the absence of AP20187 did not alter the fraction of monopolar spindles (47.8 \u00b1 2.7%; mean \u00b1 SD), indicating that the monomeric version of dynein was unable to reconstitute the function of native dynein. However, addition of AP20187 to cells expressing FKBP-hDyn substantially increased in the fraction of cells with monopolar spindles (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>, 75.5 \u00b1 2.5%). This result demonstrates that dimerization of two dynein motor domains robustly activates the ability of dynein to generate an inward force in the spindle. Together, our results suggest that a minimal, dimeric motor can slide anti-parallel MTs to generate an inward force during spindle assembly."

In contrast, our results show that MT crosslinking and sliding by dynein dimers does not require its tail domain, accessory subunits, regulatory proteins, or further oligomerization. Rather, our results indicate that the two motor domains of a dynein dimer can bind to separate MTs and each motor domain can walk independently on the MT to which it is bound. To accomplish this, the two motor domains likely splay apart, allowing the dimer to bind to the two MTs simultaneously (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>)."

This behavior was observed for both GST-dimerized dynein, as well as two natively dimerized dyneins (Dyn1 and Dyn1<sub>387kD</sub>), indicating that it was not an effect of artificial dimerization.

In addition, a large body of evidence suggests that dynein controls MT organization during mitosis by sliding MTs within the spindle (<a href=\"#bib69\">Verde et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Rusan et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Tanenbaum et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Ferenz et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Gatlin et al., 2009</a>). In these earlier studies, this MT sliding in vivo was speculated to occur between anti-parallel MTs, generating an inward force that opposes the outward forces of kinesin-5 and kinesin-12 acting upon these overlapping MTs. This model agrees well with our in vitro data showing that dynein virtually always slides MTs in an anti-parallel configuration. Our in vivo experiments also demonstrate that a minimal dimer is able to generate an inward force in the spindle that can reconstitute the function of the endogenous motor. This activity was observed using two different dimerization methods, indicating that the MT-MT sliding ability is independent of the method of dimerization. As we cannot directly observe MT-MT sliding in the spindle, we cannot exclude that the minimal dynein collapses the spindle through an alternative mechanism, for example through interaction with additional proteins. However, our in vivo analysis is consistent with the notion that dynein slides MTs in the spindle using only its motor domains, which is further supported by the in vitro experiments. These results suggest that sliding of MTs in the spindle reflects an inherent activity of the dynein motor domains alone, consistent with a model in which the two motor domains of dynein walk on two distinct MTs in the spindle, driving their relative movement. However, the situation with native dynein may be more complicated, since other dynein subunits, as well as additional dynein-associated proteins, such as Lis1 and Nde1 contribute to inward force generation in vivo (<a href=\"#bib60\">Tanenbaum et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Raaijmakers et al., 2013</a>). These factors could change the fundamental sliding mechanism of native dynein in vivo, so that the two motor domains do not crossbridge two overlapping microtubules, as described in our model. However, we feel that this is unlikely and rather these factors preserve the fundamental mechanism described (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>), but may be necessary for promoting dynein stability, efficient targeting to the spindle, and/or modify dynein\u2019s force production (<a href=\"#bib35\">McKenney et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Trokter et al., 2012</a>)."

For example, W\u00fchr and Mitchison (<a href=\"#bib73\">W\u00fchr et al., 2010</a>) provide evidence that dynein anchored at cytoplasmic sites may also contribute to MT sliding in the spindle in large embryonic cells. Additionally, we show that spindle pole focusing cannot be restored by expression of the minimal dynein dimer. While generation of an inward force likely involves sliding of anti-parallel MTs in the middle of the spindle, pole focusing occurs in a region where most microtubules are expected to have a parallel orientation, perhaps explaining why the minimal dynein is unable to support pole-focusing activity. It is currently unclear how dynein controls pole focusing; however interactions of dynein with NuMA may be important for this activity (<a href=\"#bib37\">Merdes et al., 1996</a>, <a href=\"#bib36\">2000</a>), Kinesin-14 motors play an important role in pole focusing through MT crossbridging and MT sliding as well (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>) (<a href=\"#bib40\">Mountain et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Braun et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Fink et al., 2009</a>)."

Anterograde transport of MTs was observed in nerve axons and shown to be dependent upon dynein activity (<a href=\"#bib21\">He et al., 2005</a>), although the mechanism by which dynein moved MTs in the axon was unclear. Similarly, loss of dynein in <i>Drosophila</i> neurons results in a loss of uniform MT polarity within axons, suggesting that dynein actively sorts MTs based on their polarity (<a href=\"#bib75\">Zheng et al., 2008</a>). The mechanism of MT-MT sliding described here provides a model for how dynein may achieve such MT sorting in neuronal cells. Thus, dynein driven MT-MT sliding could be a more generally used mechanism to organize and sort MTs in the cell."

Biotinylated track MTs were bound to the surface and the chamber was washed extensively to remove unbound MTs. Dynein was then introduced and allowed to bind to the track MTs for 5 min at room temperature. Rat brain dynein at \u223c100 nM or GST-Dyn1<sub>331kDaa</sub> at \u223c200 nM was used. Unbound dynein was removed by washing with BC buffer, followed by introduction of transport MTs diluted in BC buffer. After a 10 min incubation, unbound track MTs were washed out with BC buffer and the chamber was equilibrated in assay buffer containing 2 mM ATP and an oxygen scavenger system. Sliding was imaged in TIRF mode. Data was acquired and subsequently analyzed by making kymographs of the sliding events using \u00b5Manager. Polarity-marked MTs were made essentially as described previously (<a href=\"#bib20\">Goodwin and Vale, 2010</a>), but the GMP-CPP seeds were first capped at their minus ends by incubation with 0.3 \u00b5M NEM-treated tubulin. Sliding between MTs was observed in the same buffer with a final concentration of 100 mM K-acetate. At 200 mM K-acetate, no annealing between transport and track MTs was observed."

The C-terminal \u223c380 kDa motor domain of human dynein (nucleotides 3850-13,938 of clone KIAA1997) was then inserted downstream of either the GST or the FKBP. This boundary was chosen to be similar to the previously published motor domain constructs of rat (<a href=\"#bib23\">H\u00f6\u00f6k et al., 2005</a>), Dictyostelium, and yeast dyneins (<a href=\"#bib49\">Reck-Peterson et al., 2006</a>). HEK293 cells were transfected with either GST-hDyn or FKBP-hDyn and cells were analyzed \u223c24 hr after transfection. Expression of FKBP-hDyn at very high expression levels disrupted chromosome alignment and resulted in defects in spindle morphology, independently of AP20187 addition. Very high expressing cells also had an increased tendency to form monopolar spindles. Therefore, for all experiments we focused our analysis on the \u223c70% of cells within the population with low to moderate expression levels of FKBP-hDyn."

As suggested by the reviewers, we expressed and purified a natively dimerized recombinant minimal dynein (Dyn<sub>387kD</sub>). We show that Dyn<sub>387kD</sub> sediments at \u223c19S on a sucrose gradient, similar to other dimeric dyneins, and does not contain additional subunits. By deleting its canonical MT binding domain, we also find no evidence for a second \u201ccryptic\u201d MT binding site that might crosslink microtubules. Functionally, single Dyn<sub>387kD</sub> molecules move processively along MTs. Next, we show that Dyn<sub>387kD</sub> can bundle MTs, slide MTs within the bundles, and slide MTs within single MT-MT overlaps, very similar to GST-Dyn<sub>331kD</sub>. While Dyn<sub>387kD</sub> walks processively and unidirectionally on single MTs, it frequent pauses and reverses direction in anti-parallel MT overlaps. Taken together, these results show that a minimal, natively dimerized motor can slide MTs using only its two motor domains. We should also note that transition from unidirectional motion along a single microtubule, to pauses and bidirectional runs within an overlap is most likely a single molecule signature of the two motors domains binding to two different microtubules in an overlap region. This behavior is noted for native yeast dynein, again underscoring that this behavior is not an artifact of truncating the heavy chain."

We never meant to imply that a minimal dynein dimer can fully compensate for all dynein functions in spindle assembly. Our results show that GST-dynein (or chemically dimerized FKBP-FRB-dynein) can counteract the outward microtubule sliding forces generated by kinesin-5 and kinesin-12, which strongly suggests that this construct produces anti-parallel microtubule sliding in vivo. However, we agree that other dynein functions in mitosis are unlikely to be replicated by this minimal dynein dimer, including pole focusing which occurs mainly between parallel microtubules. We have now tested this directly and show that GST-dynein does not rescue spindle pole focusing after dynein heavy chain RNAi. The spindle pole focusing mechanism likely involves the dynein tail domain, as well as associated molecules such as NuMa. We have clarified these points in the Discussion. We also have expanded the Discussion with recent data showing that the inward sliding forces produced by native dynein in the spindle require associated chains. While we feel that native dynein and the minimal GST-dynein slide anti-parallel MTs by the same mechanism, these results illustrate that native dynein has additional requirements for in vivo function, which may include stability of the entire heavy chain by associated proteins, as well as regulation of its force-generating activities. Thus, between our new in vivo data and new Discussion section, we feel that we have better represented the broader activities of dynein in the spindle. We experimented with a schematic but felt that it did not enhance the paper. We have added a schematic of our model for dynein-driven sliding and how it differs from mechanisms proposed for other motor proteins."

We currently do not fully understand why rat brain dynein slides MTs faster in surface gliding experiments than in MT-MT sliding. One possible explanation is that mammalian dyneins have a low MT affinity, much lower processivity, and show birectional movements in vitro (Trokter et al., 2012; Ori-McKenney et al. 2010, and our own unpublished results), while yeast dynein is more processive and unidirectional.

Collectively, these two methods reveal predominant anti-parallel MT sliding with an occasional MT sliding event."

Nonetheless, we have changed the text to specify that our results are the first fully reconstituted in vitro demonstration of dynein-dependent sliding and have added a reference to the study that shows transport of stabilized seeds to the spindle pole by dynein (Heald et al., 1996)."

It is possible that this is due to an additional MT-binding site somewhere in the complex (which may be regulated in vivo), but it is also possible that this is due to the short dwell time and low processivity of mammalian dynein in vitro (Trokter et al., 2012 PNAS, Miura et al. 2010 FEBS Letters, our unpublished results) and we have added these possible reasons to the Results section."

The GST-GFP-hDyn construct is based on previously published boundaries for the minimal motor domains in yeast, <i>Dictyostelium</i>, and rat (<a href=\"#bib49\">Reck-Peterson et al. 2006</a>, Koonce and Samso, 1996, and <a href=\"#bib23\">Hook et al. 2005</a>). The human and yeast constructs used in this study are truncated at similar points relative to the motor domain (human residue number 1284 and yeast residue number 1219) and fused to GST. This truncation lies 189 and 145 residues N-terminal to the beginning of linker subdomain 1 in human and yeast respectively. This construct lacks the tail domain of dynein, and thus is not expected to associate with any other dynein subunits. To demonstrate this, we have now included a pull-down experiment demonstrating that the GST-GFP-hDyn construct indeed does not associate with other dynein subunits (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). In other ongoing work in our lab, we have expressed a similar human GST-dynein construct using the baculovirus system and show by hydrodynamic studies (sucrose gradient/gel filtration) and negative stain EM that it is indeed a dimer, as expected based upon its fusion to a GST dimer. We believe the other suggestions, while interesting, are beyond of the scope of our study. Also, the truncated GST-dynein dimer will not have the associated subunits needed to rescue dynein function in spindle positioning in yeast (Markus et al. 2009)."
