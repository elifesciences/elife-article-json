Structural analyses revealed that the \u03b2-hairpin of 40S protein Rps5/uS7 protrudes into the 40S mRNA exit-channel, contacting the eIF2\u2219GTP\u2219Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub> ternary complex (TC) and mRNA context nucleotides; but its importance in AUG selection was unknown. We identified substitutions in \u03b2-strand-1 and C-terminal residues of yeast Rps5 that reduced bulk initiation, conferred 'leaky-scanning' of AUGs; and lowered initiation fidelity by exacerbating the effect of poor context of the eIF1 AUG codon to reduce eIF1 abundance. Consistently, the \u03b2-strand-1 substitution greatly destabilized the 'P<sub>IN</sub>' conformation of TC binding to reconstituted 43S\u00b7mRNA complexes in vitro. Other substitutions in \u03b2-hairpin loop residues increased initiation fidelity and destabilized P<sub>IN</sub> at UUG, but not AUG start codons. We conclude that the Rps5 \u03b2-hairpin is as crucial as soluble initiation factors for efficient and accurate start codon recognition."
