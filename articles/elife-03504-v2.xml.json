Here we identify an asymmetry in pH between mother and daughter cells that underlies aging and rejuvenation. Cytosolic pH increases in aging mother cells, but is more acidic in daughter cells. This is due to the asymmetric distribution of the major regulator of cytosolic pH, the plasma membrane proton ATPase (Pma1). Pma1 accumulates in aging mother cells, but is largely absent from nascent daughter cells. We previously found that acidity of the vacuole declines in aging mother cells and limits lifespan, but that daughter cell vacuoles re-acidify. We find that Pma1 activity antagonizes mother cell vacuole acidity by reducing cytosolic protons. However, the inherent asymmetry of Pma1 increases cytosolic proton availability in daughter cells and facilitates vacuole re-acidification and rejuvenation."

Here we identify an asymmetry in pH between mother and daughter cells that underlies aging and rejuvenation. Cytosolic pH increases in aging mother cells, but is more acidic in daughter cells. This is due to the asymmetric distribution of the major regulator of cytosolic pH, the plasma membrane proton ATPase (Pma1). Pma1 accumulates in aging mother cells, but is largely absent from nascent daughter cells. We previously found that acidity of the vacuole declines in aging mother cells and limits lifespan, but that daughter cell vacuoles re-acidify. We find that Pma1 activity antagonizes mother cell vacuole acidity by reducing cytosolic protons. However, the inherent asymmetry of Pma1 increases cytosolic proton availability in daughter cells and facilitates vacuole re-acidification and rejuvenation."

Furthermore, the Pma1 protein also accumulates as mother cells age. By pumping protons out of the cell, Pma1 effectively reduces the number of protons available to acidify the vacuole in the mother cell. However, because at first the daughter does not have Pma1, there are still plenty of protons inside the cell to acidify the vacuole."

Thus Henderson et al. have identified one of the earliest events in the cellular aging process in budding yeast.

Because replicative aging is asymmetric, the process of aging occurs in mother cells but is absent in daughter cells (<a href=\"#bib10\">Egilmez and Jazwinski, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Kennedy et al., 1994</a>). Several asymmetric phenotypes have been identified and proposed to contribute to mother cell decline (<a href=\"#bib45\">Sinclair and Guarente, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Lai et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Aguilaniu et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Erjavec et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Eldakak et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">McFaline-Figueroa et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Nystrom and Liu, 2014</a>). We recently found that the acidity of the yeast lysosome-like vacuole is asymmetric between mother and daughter cells. Vacuole acidity declines in mother cells in early age and limits lifespan, but daughter cells have acidic vacuoles (<a href=\"#bib19\">Hughes and Gottschling, 2012</a>). To identify what reduces vacuole acidity and how vacuole acidity is regenerated in daughter cells, we further characterized vacuole pH asymmetry. Cells were aged using a genetic system (<a href=\"#bib25\">Lindstrom and Gottschling, 2009</a>) and vacuole acidity was monitored by staining cells with quinacrine, a fluorescent dye that accumulates in the acidic vacuole (<a href=\"#bib50\">Weisman et al., 1987</a>). We observed bright vacuolar quinacrine staining indicative of acidic pH in a high percentage of buds (nascent daughter cells) regardless of mother cell age, whereas staining was diminished or undetectable in mother cell vacuoles (<a href=\"#bib19\">Hughes and Gottschling, 2012</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Thus, throughout their lifespan mother cells produce daughter cells capable of regenerating vacuole acidity."

Vacuole acidity was asymmetric in cells treated with nocodazole (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), suggesting that the bud vacuole re-acidifies prior to cytokinesis. We confirmed that re-acidification occurred before cytokinesis by examining cells containing the septin marker Cdc10-mCherry (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). A single septin ring at the bud neck transitions to two rings during cytokinesis (<a href=\"#bib26\">Lippincott et al., 2001</a>). We observed high vacuole acidity in buds when there was a single septin ring, further supporting that vacuole acidity regenerates prior to cytokinesis. Thus, throughout their lifespan, mother cells produce daughter cells that regenerate vacuole acidity prior to cytokinesis, when mother and daughter cells share a common cytosol. Thus, whatever causes the asymmetry of vacuole pH must also be asymmetric between mother and daughter cells prior to cytokinesis."

Given the evidence presented above that Pma1 levels antagonize vacuolar acidity, we asked whether reduced Pma1 activity also affected lifespan. Indeed, the <i>pma1-105</i> allele increased median replicative lifespan by \u223c30% (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>), comparable to well-characterized lifespan-extending mutations (<a href=\"#bib9\">Delaney et al., 2011</a>). The slope of the <i>pma1-105</i> lifespan curve is similar to the slope of the wild-type curve. This suggests that instead of influencing the rate of aging throughout lifespan, the <i>pma1-105</i> allele delays the onset of the normal aging process. To ascertain whether lifespan extension by the <i>pma1-105</i> allele occurred entirely via increased vacuolar acidity, we examined the lifespan of <i>pma1-105</i> cells that lacked V-ATPase function. Cells lacking the V-ATPase subunit Vma2 had a short median lifespan of 2 divisions, as previously reported (<a href=\"#bib19\">Hughes and Gottschling, 2012</a>). The lifespan of cells that had reduced Pma1 activity and that were devoid of V-ATPase function (<i>vma2</i>\u0394, <i>pma1-105</i>) was much shorter than wild-type lifespan (median 7 divisions), and more similar to cells lacking V-ATPase function. This suggests that most of the lifespan extension imparted by the <i>pma1-105</i> allele requires V-ATPase function, but that the mechanism of lifespan extension is not limited to increased vacuolar acidification. Taken together these results support the idea that high Pma1 levels on mother cells impair vacuole acidification and limit lifespan."

To test this idea, we asked whether expressing Pma1 in buds reduced vacuole acidity. We induced overexpression of <i>PMA1-mCherry</i> in cells arrested prior to cytokinesis with nocodazole and in untreated cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). In untreated cells, overexpression increased mother cell Pma1 levels but maintained mother-bud asymmetry. However, in nocodazole-arrested cells, <i>PMA1-mCherry</i> became equivalently high in mother cells and buds. At least 80% of buds had acidic vacuoles without <i>PMA1</i> induction or when <i>PMA1</i> was induced in the absence of nocodazole (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). In contrast, only 13% of buds had acidic vacuoles when Pma1 levels were high in buds. Because increased Pma1 levels in buds impaired re-acidification of the vacuole, we conclude that the inherent asymmetry of Pma1 is required for regeneration of vacuole acidity prior to cytokinesis. We speculate that regeneration of vacuole acidity is required for daughter cell rejuvenation and that if high levels of Pma1 were induced in the buds of aging mother cells, daughter cells would not rejuvenate."

Given that Pma1 pumps protons out of the cell, we hypothesized that increased Pma1 activity antagonizes vacuole acidity by reducing cytosolic protons available to the V-ATPase. A prediction of this hypothesis is that cytosolic pH may become more basic with age, and may differ between mother and daughter cells. To test this hypothesis, we examined cytosolic pH with ratiometric pHluorin (a pH-sensitive GFP) (<a href=\"#bib31\">Miesenbock et al., 1998</a>) fused to a plasma membrane targeting sequence (residues 1\u201328 of the Psr1 protein) (<a href=\"#bib46\">Siniossoglou et al., 2000</a>). With this reagent, cytosolic pH at the cell cortex was visualized (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>) and quantified in mother cells of varying ages and in their buds. Newborn daughter cells or mother cells that had undergone 1 or 2 divisions had a mean cytosolic pH of \u223c7.1, similar to previous measurements of bulk log phase cultures (<a href=\"#bib36\">Orij et al., 2009</a>) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). However, as mother cells aged, cortical cytosolic pH increased as much as \u223c0.5 pH units (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Moreover, when we examined mother cells (on average 3 or 18 divisions old) and their attached buds, cortical pH was \u223c0.2 or \u223c0.1 pH units lower in buds than mother cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). All together, these results indicate that cortical cytosolic pH increases during replicative aging and is asymmetric between mother and daughter cells. Mother-daughter asymmetry of cytosolic pH might be surprising given the rapid diffusion of protons (<a href=\"#bib52\">Wraight, 2006</a>). However, local cytosolic pH differences have been observed in tumor cell invadopodia (<a href=\"#bib27\">Magalhaes et al., 2011</a>) and cytosolic pH gradients can form during polarized growth (<a href=\"#bib13\">Feijo et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Gibbon and Kropf, 1994</a>)."

They show that Pma1 plays a role in establishing the asymmetry in vacuolar pH between yeast mother and daughter cells that was previously identified by the authors. They demonstrate that Pma1 is enriched at the plasma membrane of mother cells and absent from buds. This correlates with an increase in the cortical pH in the mother cell compared to the daughter, and a less acidic vacuole in the mother than in the bud. Upon over-expression of Pma1 in cells arrested in mitosis, the asymmetry of Pma1 localization is lost, and the pH asymmetry between mother and bud are reduced or lost both at the cortex and in the vacuole. Likewise, reducing the activity of Pma1 restores the lower pH in the vacuole of mother cells and extends their lifespan. Thus, the authors conclude that asymmetric distribution of Pma1 contributes to the ageing of mother cells and the formation of young daughter cells."

Does the higher pH of the mother cell's vacuole contribute directly to ageing, or does it simply create a burden to the cell that impacts longevity? By definition ageing causes mortality (frequency of death at a certain time point) to increase with age. Thus, when the log of mortality is plotted as a function of age, the curve should have a positive linear slope. Furthermore, a process contributing to ageing should increase the slope of the curve. A rapid evaluation of the curves presented in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> suggests that in the pma1 mutant the curve is only shifted relative to the wild type and that the slope is not affected. Thus, it appears as if the pH of the vacuole modulates the time at which ageing \u201cstarts\u201d without affecting that process itself. Furthermore, if low pH resets age in the bud, mutants with high Pma1 activity in the bud should show a shorter lifespan that decreases proportionally to the age of their mothers at the time of cytokinesis (i.e. they inherit age and cannot reset it). Alternatively, the cells might not show any difference to their mothers (everybody restarts with the same slight deficit due to the fact that ageing starts earlier for all). While the reviewers agreed that experiments addressing some of these points are laborious (but doable) these issues need to be at least discussed. Furthermore, an increase in the number of cells evaluated (see point 1) will help to get a better picture of how mortality changes with age."

These findings suggest that reduced vacuole acidity contributes to aging throughout lifespan, and that increasing vacuole acidity does not simply delay the onset of the normal events of aging. The work we present here suggests that Pma1 activity influences lifespan by antagonizing vacuole acidity during aging. We therefore suspect that the <i>pma1-105</i> allele simply delays the division at which vacuole acidity is reduced and that once vacuole acidity is reduced, the normal events of aging that follow occur at the normal rate. The shape of the <i>pma1-105</i> lifespan curve is thus consistent with our conclusion that Pma1 activity initiates aging by reducing vacuole acidity and we have added a discussion of this idea."
