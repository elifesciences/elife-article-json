We developed computational and experimental approaches to quantify, with both sub-cellular and multi-cellular resolution, the dynamics of force transmission in cell clusters. Applying this technology to spontaneously-forming adherent epithelial cell clusters, we found that basal force fluctuations were coupled to E-cadherin localization at the level of individual cell-cell junctions. At the multi-cellular scale, cell-cell force exchange depended on the cell position within a cluster, and was adaptive to reconfigurations due to cell divisions or positional rearrangements. Importantly, force transmission through a cell required coordinated modulation of cell-matrix adhesion and actomyosin contractility in the cell and its neighbors. These data provide insights into mechanisms that could control mechanical stress homeostasis in dynamic epithelial tissues, and highlight our methods as a resource for the study of mechanotransduction in cell-cell adhesions."

We developed computational and experimental approaches to quantify, with both sub-cellular and multi-cellular resolution, the dynamics of force transmission in cell clusters. Applying this technology to spontaneously-forming adherent epithelial cell clusters, we found that basal force fluctuations were coupled to E-cadherin localization at the level of individual cell-cell junctions. At the multi-cellular scale, cell-cell force exchange depended on the cell position within a cluster, and was adaptive to reconfigurations due to cell divisions or positional rearrangements. Importantly, force transmission through a cell required coordinated modulation of cell-matrix adhesion and actomyosin contractility in the cell and its neighbors. These data provide insights into mechanisms that could control mechanical stress homeostasis in dynamic epithelial tissues, and highlight our methods as a resource for the study of mechanotransduction in cell-cell adhesions."

In all these processes, the spatiotemporal regulation of mechanical forces is essential for the maintenance of tissue integrity as well as for communication and coordination between cells. Nevertheless, it is yet unclear how the magnitude and length scale of cell\u2013cell force transmission are modulated dynamically as a function of cell position and topological changes within a cellular ensemble. Moreover, as recent studies have begun to characterize the molecular basis of the mechano-responsiveness of the cadherin\u2013catenin complex (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gomez et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Leckband et al., 2011</a>), it is important to understand how the recruitment and regulation of cadherin molecules at the adherens junctions are coupled to cell\u2013cell force transmission."

We developed a method that utilizes high-resolution traction force microscopy (TFM) and time-lapse live cell microscopy to quantify cell\u2013cell mechanical interactions in dynamic multi-cellular clusters, while maintaining the sub-cellular resolution needed to measure force exchange at the level of individual junctions. Our method expanded upon several pioneering studies, which inferred cell\u2013cell force transmission from the regional imbalance of traction forces in cell pairs and three-cell clusters in linear configurations (<a href=\"#bib32\">Liu et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Maruthamuthu et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">McCain et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Tseng et al., 2012</a>), by now providing the time and sub-cellular resolution needed to derive the spatiotemporal coordination of force exchanges in larger cell groups as well as the coupling of force and protein dynamics at individual adherens junctions.

Our results revealed that the spatial distributions and dynamics of basal cell\u2013cell force transmission correlated with morphogenetic events such as cell divisions. Along the cell junction, we showed with sub-interface resolution that the local mechanical stresses also correlated with localization of E-cadherin molecules. Expanding our approach to temporal force fluctuation analysis at the length scale of a cell, we found that force propagation through cells can be intercepted by cell anchorage to the extracellular matrix and by actomyosin contraction. Together these results provide a first glimpse of the dynamics of sub-cellular force exchanges that yield stress homeostasis in quiescent and proliferating tissues."

The principle states that traction forces exerted by a single cell, or by a cluster of cells, are in mechanical equilibrium with the extracellular substrate. Hence, the traction forces integrated over the footprint of a single cell or a cell cluster must be equal to zero (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>; see \u2018The force-balancing principle and its application to larger cell clusters\u2019 in \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 section). Following from this, if the integrated traction force over the footprint of an individual cell within a cell cluster is non-zero, other cells in the cluster must balance it by force transmission through cell\u2013cell adhesions. Thus, the residual traction force for a particular cell within a cluster determines the vectorial sum of external forces this cell experiences through cell\u2013cell adhesions (<a href=\"#equ1\">Equation 1</a> in \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). In the case of a cell pair, each cell has one interface. Therefore, the residual forces associated with each of the two cells are\u2014within the noise limits of traction force reconstruction\u2014of equal magnitudes but opposite directions and indicate the force exchanged through that interface."

Integration of traction forces over the footprint (color-shaded boundaries) of a single cell (column 1) or an entire cell cluster (columns 2\u20134) yields a balanced net force of 0. In cell pairs and clusters with a \u2018tree-like\u2019 topology (columns 2 and 3), forces exchanged at each cell\u2013cell junction can be determined by partitioning the cluster into two sub-networks and calculating the residual force required to balance the traction forces integrated over the footprint of each sub-network.

In cell clusters with a \u2018loop\u2019 topology (column 4), individual cell\u2013cell junctions do not fully partition the cluster into disjoint sub-networks.

To resolve the relative contributions of redundant junctions to the force balance in cell clusters with a \u2018loop\u2019 topology, we modeled the cell cluster as a thin-plate in mechanical equilibrium with the substrate. Following the work by Fredberg and colleagues, we performed these calculations under the assumption that the plate is homogeneously elastic (for details, see \u2018Assumptions for the thin-plate FEM approach\u2019 in \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 section) (<a href=\"#bib50\">Tambe et al., 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib51\">2013</a>). Using the finite element method (FEM), we then determined the thin-plate internal stresses that are required to balance the traction stresses in the substrate. Once the thin-plate internal stresses are known, the local force exchange through any curvilinear section inside the plate can be calculated by multiplication of the stress tensor at a particular location on the section with the normal vector to the section line (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). In our experiments, the curvilinear sections were defined by the fluorescence signals of GFP fused to E-cadherin, the molecular backbone of adherens junctions in epithelial tissues (<a href=\"#bib19\">Halbleib and Nelson, 2006</a>). Thus we could calculate force exchange profiles along cell\u2013cell interfaces (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>) at any time point of a time-lapse video (<a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>)."

Our analyses indicated that both approaches yielded consistent results; the error for interface force calculations by the FEM approach is comparable to the error we found for force calculations by the force balancing principle alone (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). This implies that the inaccuracy in FEM-predicted forces arises from the same sources of error as the inaccuracy in force balance-predicted forces, which are uncertainties in the traction force reconstruction. Thus, neither the simplifying approximation of the cell cluster by a homogeneous thin-plate nor the numerical solution of the model introduced substantial error when predicting cell\u2013cell forces in \u2018tree-like\u2019 topologies. Although both the force-balancing-principle approach and the FEM approach appeared to have similar accuracy in determining cell\u2013cell forces, application of the thin-plate model permits the analysis of force exchange in clusters that change between a \u2018tree-like\u2019 and a \u2018loop\u2019 topology (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a> vs <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>; <a href=\"#media2 media3\">Videos 2 and 3</a>) and is thus a more generalized approach to quantify cell\u2013cell force transmission."

Cell proliferation is an important factor in regulating the tensional homeostasis of tissues (<a href=\"#bib14\">Farhadifar et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Ranft et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Eisenhoffer et al., 2012</a>), and the process itself is finely coordinated by intracellular and extracellular forces (<a href=\"#bib54\">Th\u00e9ry et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Woolner and Papalopulu, 2012</a>). We found that, as a cell in a cluster entered mitosis, the overall mechanical energy deposited into the substrate by either the entire cluster or the dividing cell transiently decreased (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D\u2013E</a>). The overall mechanical energy generated by a cluster or individual cells therein was calculated as the strain energy, that is, the product of traction force and substrate deformation, integrated over the footprint of a cluster or a cell. The drop in strain energy during mitosis reflected the detachment of the dividing cell from the cell\u2013matrix as it became rounded (<a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a>), consistent with previous assertions (<a href=\"#bib53\">Terasima and Tolmach, 1963</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Burton and Taylor, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Tanimoto and Sano, 2012</a>). After mitosis, the strain energy was restored and, in this example, increased beyond pre-mitotic levels (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>), possibly reflecting the additional contractility that the new cell contributed to the cluster."

Interestingly, during mitotic events, the sum of cell\u2013cell force magnitudes over all junctions in the cell cluster remained constant before increasing to a higher plateau value (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4I</a>). This suggested that the loss of cell\u2013cell forces at the junctions of the dividing cell was balanced at other junctions in the cluster (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). For example, during division of cell 1 in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013B</a>, the two connecting graphical edges, edges 1 and 2, exhibited decreases in cell\u2013cell forces (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>). In contrast, edge 5, which was not directly connected to cell 1, experienced an increase in force transmission (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>; <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Similarly, during the division of cell 3 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B\u2013C</a>), there was an increase in cell\u2013cell force at edge 6 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>; <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), which was not connected to the dividing cell.

We thus investigated whether and how basal force variations were coupled to the localization and recruitment of the molecular components of cell\u2013cell junctions. We focused first on E-cadherin, the backbone of adherens junctions for epithelial cells. We correlated the E-cadherin-GFP intensities integrated along each cell\u2013cell junction with the force measured for each junction and observed a positive and statistically significant correlation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). The positive correlation also persisted on a stiffer matrix (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>), indicating that the overall relation between force exchange and E-cadherin recruitment is robust and independent of substrate compliance. We further validated the central role of cadherin proteins in mediating cell\u2013cell force transmission by using function-blocking antibodies targeting E-cadherin directly (<a href=\"#bib42\">Petrova et al., 2012</a>) or by knock-down of alpha-catenin, an essential adaptor protein of cadherin-mediated adhesions (<a href=\"#bib64\">Yonemura et al., 2010</a>). Both perturbations resulted in a significant reduction in cell\u2013cell force measurements (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B\u2013C</a>). These results support the model that the junctional recruitment of E-cadherin is coupled to the cell\u2013cell adhesion forces (<a href=\"#bib32\">Liu et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Borghi et al., 2012</a>)."

As the segment length increased, the randomization abrogated the positive correlation between cell\u2013cell stress distribution and local E-cadherin-GFP intensities, as indicated by the decreasing ratio between correlation coefficients with and without randomization (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>, red curve). We defined the segment length at which the ratio between correlation coefficients with and without randomization fell below 0.5 as the length scale over which force exchange between cells and E-cadherin recruitment are coupled. We found this length to be 9.6 \u00b5m (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>) or 12.8 \u00b5m (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>) depending on whether the cells were cultured on soft (8 kPa) or stiff (35 kPa) substrates. This length scale is consistent with the length scale over which E-cadherin-GFP proteins are modulated along cell\u2013cell junctions in our system, which we measured to be 13 \u00b5m based on autocorrelation of E-cadherin-GFP intensities along the cell junctions (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>; <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Similar values of cadherin intensity fluctuations along cell junctions have previously been reported for mature cell\u2013cell adhesions (<a href=\"#bib26\">Lambert et al., 2007</a>). Thus, our results suggest that the measured length scale of force\u2013E-cadherin coupling is likely related to the spatial organization of E-cadherin along the cell\u2013cell junctions and not a resolution limit of the FEM analysis. Importantly, the value \u223c10 \u03bcm is significantly less than the length of the majority of the cell\u2013cell junctions in the MCF10A clusters (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>; <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Even for junctions less than or equal to 10 \u00b5m, we were able to detect cell\u2013cell stresses. In fact, the distribution of cell\u2013cell stress magnitudes for these short junctions is similar to that for junctions of all lengths, indicating that our analysis of cell\u2013cell stress is not limited by cell junction lengths (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Together, these analyses demonstrate that the FEM approach is able to extract significant sub-junctional variations in cell\u2013cell adhesion forces."

Since segments of this length could only be defined in extended, more mature cell\u2013cell junctions (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>), we suspected that this trend could reflect a particular property of this more stable population of cell interfaces within the clusters. We therefore repeated the correlation analysis for bins containing junctions of increasing length. Indeed, we found that the median as well as the entire distribution of correlations between local cell\u2013cell stress magnitudes and E-cadherin-GFP intensities increased with junction length (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>; <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). Importantly, although the number of junctions per bin decreased with length, the correlation increase is not related to weaker statistical power because randomization abrogated the trend (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G</a>; <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>).

When junctions were re-established after mitosis, those embedded in the cell cluster had lower force transmission compared to junctions at the cluster periphery (network in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>; <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). To further examine the spatial distribution of cell\u2013cell forces, we categorized each cell in a cell cluster by the number of its neighbors or its degree of connectivity (k) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). With increasing k, the sum of cell\u2013cell forces increased (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>), which indicates that the cumulative force a cell experiences through its cell\u2013cell adhesions increases with the number of connected neighbors. Strikingly, the increase in cumulative cell\u2013cell forces for higher k-values was not paralleled by stronger cell\u2013matrix traction forces (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). Thus, contrary to the conclusions drawn from examining cell doublets (<a href=\"#bib35\">Maruthamuthu et al., 2011</a>), the generation and exchange of forces at cell\u2013cell junctions can be decoupled from cell\u2013matrix traction force generation, especially in larger cell clusters where cells have higher k values. This result is further supported by the observation that focal adhesions and traction forces are primarily localized at the periphery of cell clusters (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>), consistent with a previous report (<a href=\"#bib38\">Mertz et al., 2013</a>)."

We examined the forces transmitted through individual cell\u2013cell junctions by assigning each junction, or graphical edge, the two k values of the two cells it connected. The cell\u2013cell junctions were then grouped according to the lesser of the two k values (minimal k). Junctions with smaller minimal k values were closer to the cluster periphery, whereas those with higher minimal k were embedded in the cluster. In general, cells on stiffer (35 kPa) substrates exerted higher traction forces compared to cells on softer (8 kPa) substrates (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). Interestingly, the dependence of traction force on matrix compliance was reflected in different trends of force transmission vs minimal k. On 8 kPa substrates, cell\u2013cell forces at individual junctions were independent of the minimal k values (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>), whereas the cell\u2013cell stresses, calculated by normalizing cell\u2013cell force to junction length, increased for junctions with higher minimal k values (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). This is consistent with a previous analysis of cellular stresses in epithelial sheets, in which the stresses exerted between cells were proposed to be higher towards the center of the sheet (<a href=\"#bib57\">Trepat et al., 2009</a>). In contrast, on 35 kPa substrates, the forces as well as stresses exerted on individual cell\u2013cell junctions decreased with increasing minimal k of the junction (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C\u2013D</a>). Hence, for cell clusters on the stiffer substrate, the cell\u2013cell forces were transmitted predominantly between cluster-peripheral cells and not across the cluster center. Thus, the spatial pattern of cell\u2013cell force transmission is modulated by the mechanical microenvironment."

This analysis is based on the following expectations of cell mechanics: if forces are transmitted across a cell without coupling to cell\u2013matrix adhesions, the forces at the two considered junctions should fluctuate with similar magnitudes and opposite directions (correlation close to \u22121), whereas the fluctuations of cell\u2013cell and cell\u2013matrix forces should not be correlated (correlation close to 0). The opposite is true if forces exerted at one cell\u2013cell junction are not transmitted across a cell but instead are transmitted to the cell substrate."

At first, this result seemed to contradict findings that, in processes such as collective migration, mechanical interactions are long-ranged relative to the dimension of a single cell (<a href=\"#bib57\">Trepat et al., 2009</a>). However, our data could be reconciled with this observation if long-range force transmission is an active process: forces exerted on a cell activate signaling pathways and contractile machineries that are responsible for transducing force to neighboring cells. In this model, each individual cell in a cell cluster, though linked with one another, functions independently with the ability to promote or attenuate force transduction."

Both paxillin and talin-1 are proteins involved in the assembly and maturation of integrin adhesions and the generation of traction forces (<a href=\"#bib65\">Zaidel-Bar et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Zhang et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Iwanicki et al., 2011</a>). Therefore, we expected cells with downregulated paxillin or talin-1 to be mechanically isolated from the substrate. Indeed, the traction forces exerted by cells with reduced paxillin or talin-1 were significantly lower than the traction forces of control cells (<a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1D,H</a>). In cell pairs in which both cells had paxillin downregulated, forces at the cell\u2013cell junction were unchanged compared to control cell pairs, indicating that paxillin knock-down did not affect cell\u2013cell force transmission (<a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). In talin-1-downregulated cell pairs, although cell\u2013cell forces were lower than those of control cell pairs, cell\u2013cell junction morphology was unaffected, and cell\u2013cell force transmission was restored almost to control levels when the talin-1 downregulated cells were embedded in larger clusters (<a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1F,G,M</a>). Importantly, the correlation between the fluctuations of cell\u2013cell forces in opposing junctions of a paxillin or talin-1 downregulated cell was higher than that between the cell\u2013cell force fluctuations in opposing junctions of control cells (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>). For talin-1 downregulated cells, which exert very low traction forces (<a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1H</a>), the correlation between the fluctuations of cell\u2013cell forces in opposing junctions was in addition higher than that between the cell\u2013cell force and traction force fluctuations (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B,D\u2013E</a>; <a href=\"#media5\">Video 5</a>). These data showed that the decoupling from the matrix of a cell within a cluster promotes the transmission of forces across the cell, from one cell\u2013cell junction to the next, in support of the force anchoring mechanism as one way a cell may attenuate long-range force transmission."

In cell pairs in which both cells had downregulated myosin-IIA, the traction forces exerted by the cells, as well as the forces exerted through the cell\u2013cell junctions, were significantly decreased (<a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1K\u2013L</a>). Although myosin-IIA downregulation affected cell\u2013cell and cell\u2013matrix mechanotransduction, cell\u2013cell junctions were still able to form in cell clusters, as the cell\u2013cell junction morphology of myosin-IIA downregulated cells remained similar to control cells and cells with downregulated myosin-IIA exerted forces at their cell\u2013cell junctions close to control levels when embedded in larger clusters (<a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1J,N</a>). As with talin-1 downregulated cells, cells with myosin-IIA knock-down showed a significant increase in the correlation of force fluctuations at opposing junctions compared to control cells (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>). This shows that cells with reduced actomyosin contractility act as passive force transducers between other contractile cells in a cluster, consistent with the force scrambling mechanism."

Combined with image analyses of cell\u2013cell junction configurations and rearrangements in the living cell clusters, our data provided unprecedented statistical power and time resolution to address questions regarding force distributions and fluctuations within cell clusters, as well as their coupling to the recruitment of molecular components of adherens junctions (<a href=\"#bib35\">Maruthamuthu et al., 2011</a>)."

                        "text": "To our knowledge, the proposed method is the first to resolve cell\u2013cell force transmission dynamically with sub-cellular resolution. Yet, there are limitations that need to be considered with re-implementations of the approach: first, our method relies on a simple thin-plate model of the cell cluster that assumes homogeneity in material property within the cluster. In reality, the mechanical properties of the cell cluster may not be linear and isotropic elastic, as there may be spatial heterogeneity arising from differences in sub-cellular structures and cellular contractility. The assumption of mechanical homogeneity has been made also in stress distribution analyses on an entire cell monolayer (<a href=\"#bib51\">Tambe et al., 2013</a>). In that case, the low spatial resolution tends to average inhomogeneity. The higher the resolution in imaging and the finer the spatial scale of the FEM analysis, the less likely is the cell cluster well represented by a thin-plate. How severe the resulting prediction error is depends on the cluster configuration and the noise level in the traction forces. In the present study, we validated the resolution of the inferred cell\u2013cell forces by cross-correlation analysis of the spatial force fluctuations with E-cadherin density fluctuations along the junctions. These tests confirmed that despite the simple thin-plate model, cell\u2013cell forces are resolved at the length scale E-cadherin-GFP intensities that fluctuate along the cell junction (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). We therefore conclude that the model simplifications are in this case not severe enough to obscure spatial relationships between force and underlying molecular processes in cell junctions. Second, our method relies on E-cadherin-GFP signals for determining the location of cell\u2013cell junctions. Imaging resolutions (lateral and axial) as well as diffuse signals in dynamic junctions may affect the precision of determining the cell\u2013cell boundary locations and therefore the accuracy of cell\u2013cell force calculations. Third, the method relies on enclosure of the entire cluster in the field of view. Without tiling the image acquisition, the cluster size is therefore limited to a maximum of 8\u201310 cells. It is important to note that increasing cluster size would also increase the error of force measurement, as the error of traction force microscopy sums up during the calculation of cell\u2013cell forces. Thus for detailed analyses of small relative force variations in space and time, it is advised to restrict the cluster size. We have quantified cell\u2013cell force dynamics in naturally forming clusters of up to nine MCF10A cells. Lastly, because the method derives cell\u2013cell forces indirectly through measurement of cell\u2013matrix traction forces, a fundamental assumption is that the measured traction forces fully capture all forces produced by the cells. Thus, the method implicitly neglects the dissipation of forces inside cells, which\u2014in principle\u2014may affect cell\u2013cell junctional forces. However, experiments that attempted to determine the magnitude of dissipative forces suggest that these contributions may be small compared to the elastic forces analyzed by the present approach (<a href=\"#bib25\">Keren et al., 2009</a>)."

Although tissue reorganization has long been known as mechanically regulated, our method provides now the capability to monitor the dynamics of cell\u2013cell junctional force exchanges during various morphogenetic events and thus the ability to correlate the induction and outcome of processes such as cell polarization (<a href=\"#bib3\">Blankenship et al., 2006</a>), mitotic spindle orientation (<a href=\"#bib15\">Fink et al., 2011</a>), cell migration (<a href=\"#bib56\">Toyama et al., 2008</a>), and cell sorting (<a href=\"#bib28\">Landsberg et al., 2009</a>), not only with putative surrogates of force generation (e.g., myosin-II localization) but also with actual force values. We show that mechanical forces may be balanced during major topology-changing events such as cell division by dynamic redistribution of cell\u2013cell junctional forces within small cell clusters (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). The result suggests that force fluctuations at individual cell\u2013cell junctions can be dynamically compensated by forces at other cell junctions. We speculate that this type of mechanical compensation occurs during cell division\u2014and apoptosis\u2014within larger tissues as well and may be the basis of tissue stress homeostasis to maintain mechanical integrity in a proliferating and deforming epithelium."

The longer-range force transmission previously observed and required for tissue morphogenesis processes, such as collective cell migration (<a href=\"#bib50\">Tambe et al., 2011</a>), is possible by the active regulation of force propagation. This can be accomplished by spatially coordinating the activation of actomyosin contractility above basal force levels, which yields a significant force exchange between neighboring cells, or by spatially coordinating the de-activation of actomyosin contractility and/or cell\u2013matrix adhesion, which may increase the transduction range of basal force levels beyond one cell diameter. The notion of active propagation of mechanical forces across tissues via spatial gradients in myosin-II activation is supported by studies of epithelial sheet migration (<a href=\"#bib39\">Ng et al., 2012</a>) and collective invasion of cancer cell clusters (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hidalgo-Carcedo et al., 2011</a>), in which an asymmetric distribution of actomyosin contractility promote cell cohesion."

We speculate that this may also be a result of the active interplay between cell\u2013cell adhesions, cell\u2013matrix adhesions, and basal actomyosin contractility to transmit, anchor, and scramble forces. As previously reported by the Dufresne group (<a href=\"#bib37\">Mertz et al., 2012</a>, <a href=\"#bib38\">2013</a>) and shown here in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a> and <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>, focal adhesion numbers and traction force magnitudes are higher along the outer periphery of the cluster, suggesting that cell\u2013cell forces are derived from cell\u2013matrix forces that occur mainly at the cluster periphery. On stiffer substrates, where actomyosin contractility and traction force exertion are known to be high (<a href=\"#bib12\">Discher et al., 2005</a>), the force anchoring and scrambling mechanisms are likely more active, preventing force transmission to the center of the cluster, whereas on softer substrates such mechanisms are less active, allowing force propagation through the cluster center. Although it is yet unclear how substrate stiffness precisely regulates cell\u2013matrix adhesions, the cytoskeletal network, and traction force exertion in cell clusters, it has been shown that the differences induced by substrate stiffness can extend multiple cell layers into a cell sheet (<a href=\"#bib39\">Ng et al., 2012</a>). Understanding how microenvironmental mechanical properties influence force transduction in epithelial cell groups may have implications not only for developmental processes but also for pathologies such as cancer where matrix stiffness is often altered (<a href=\"#bib40\">Paszek et al., 2005</a>)."

This allows a closed-form formulation of the relationship between traction forces and substrate deformation using the Boussinesq Green function (<a href=\"#bib27\">Landau and Lifshitz, 1970</a>). In order to solve the ill-posed inversion problem, we applied zero-order Tikhonov regularization (<a href=\"#bib46\">Schwarz et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Sabass et al., 2008</a>).

Extending this argument beyond single cells, a cell cluster and its substrate must also be in mechanical equilibrium. The integration of the traction force (and also torque) over the footprint \u03a9<sub>c</sub> of the cell cluster thus has to equal zero (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>; <a href=\"#equ1\">Equation 1</a>). The net traction force over the whole-cell cluster must also equal the sum of the traction forces integrated over the footprint of each individual cell. For example, in the case of a two-cell cluster with cells <i>i</i> and <i>j</i>, the net traction force of the cell pair, which should be zero, will equal the sum of traction forces integrated over the footprints of each of the two cells (\u03a9<sub>i</sub> and \u03a9<sub>j</sub>)."

The cell cluster boundary was segmented automatically by first smoothing the E-cadherin-GFP fluorescence intensity image with a Gaussian filter with a standard deviation of 5 pixels. The filtered image was then thresholded according to a \u2018first minimum after first maximum algorithm\u2019: the threshold value was selected by first finding the lowest intensity maximum in the image histogram, which largely corresponds to background pixels. The first minimum in the histogram after this maximum was selected as the threshold. The largest connected component of the binary image was identified as the cell cluster. To smoothen the cluster boundary and to fill small holes, we applied a closing operation using a disk with closure radius of 3 pixels as structuring element. Larger holes in the cluster that might arise during cell divisions or when cells join the cluster were not closed and were appropriately treated as cluster external space. The obtained <i>tight cluster mask</i> was then dilated by 15 to 45 pixels using a disk as structuring element, yielding the <i>dilated cluster mask</i>. The dilation was performed to ensure that all significant traction forces are included in the cell\u2013cell force calculations. There are several reasons why significant traction forces may fall outside the segmented cluster region. First and foremost, the traction force reconstruction is limited by the spatial resolution of the bead tracking (\u223c2.5\u20135 \u00b5m, dependent on the signal-to-noise ratio of the bead images and the substrate stiffness, with higher resolution for stiffer substrates). Second, cells at the cluster periphery often show finger-like and force-generating protrusions that are not detected by automatic cluster segmentation as they have a low E-cadherin-GFP concentration. Similarly, dividing cells exhibit retraction fibers that are barely detectable in the E-cadherin-GFP channel but seem to exert forces distant to the main cell body. The presence of these traction force vectors outside the cell footprint presents a dilemma: one would ideally want to cut off the thin-plate model at the tight cluster footprint, but then one would lose these \u2018external\u2019 forces when setting up the force balance for the cluster. We thus have taken an approach where we include these forces by extending the tight cluster mask but penalize forces with increasing distance to the detected cluster edge."

The hand drawing was guided by the E-cadherin-GFP intensity maximum along the interface curves. In regions with broader intensity curves, we additionally used the traction force maps to optimize the interface locations by avoiding traction force vectors pointing towards the interface. This criterion was deduced from the commonly accepted notion that cells do not push but only pull on the substrate. The interface drawings were also performed by three different people to avoid personal biases. The obtained cell footprints and boundaries were stored as pixelated information. The cell position was defined as the center of mass of the cell footprint. The interface length was defined as the cumulative length of line segments that connect every tenth pixel of the interface curve. If the interface curve crossed a segmentation hole in the cluster, the pixels in the holes were not counted to avoid an overestimation of the interface length."

The latter relation depends on the material properties of the cell cluster cortex, which are largely unknown. However, we found that the plate-internal stress field is practically invariant to the choice of the Young's modulus, consistent with previous studies (<a href=\"#bib50\">Tambe et al., 2011</a>). The reason for this is primarily that the solution of <a href=\"#equ8 equ9 equ10 equ11\">Equations 8\u201311</a> depends on the same material model to convert traction forces into plate deformation as is used to invert plate deformation back into plate-internal stress. Therefore in a first approximation, the terms describing the material properties are canceled out by the conversion of cluster-external tractions into cluster-internal stress. To test the validity of this approach, we compared the cell\u2013cell junctional stresses derived from the PDE solution (see below) to the junctional forces calculated by the force-balancing principle in tree-like structures where the latter approach has a well-defined solution. Using a thin-plate model with a spatially homogeneous Young's modulus within the cluster, we obtained junctional stresses with a relative error that was comparable to the one of the force-balancing solution (the relative errors are 14% for both methods, see <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). This result demonstrates that the error of both methods mainly originates from the uncertainty of the traction force measurement and that the FEM solution of the thin-plate model did not introduce additional numerical errors (e.g., due to numerical stress integration along discretized interfaces). For tree-like clusters, the two methods are thus interchangeable. This validity check on tree-like cluster, however, cannot be directly generalized to looped configurations. To this end, an alternative, yet missing, experimental method would be needed for cross-validating the thin-plate model. A more detailed cell model could yield a different stress distribution along the interfaces that may improve the correlation of cell\u2013cell stresses with E-cadherin-GFP intensity as well as the prediction of cell\u2013cell forces in looped configurations. We maintain that the material model assumptions are cell-type specific as epithelial cells, especially on softer substrates, tend to have relatively homogeneous cortical structures with few pronounced stress fibers. Moreover, the invariance of the PDE solution to the material properties may also be abolished under perturbation of certain pathways."

To test this assertion and to determine the length scale over which force and E-cadherin recruitment are coupled, we calculated correlation coefficients for every interface in each frame individually, either with correct or randomized stress\u2013intensity pairs. For randomization, the interface was subdivided into sub-junctional segments of length <b>\u0394</b>l. If a cell\u2013cell junction was shorter than <b>\u0394</b>l, it was not considered in the analysis. If the interface was longer but not in multiples of <b>\u0394</b>l, the remaining fragment was complemented with neighboring data points to precisely match <b>\u0394</b>l. Randomization was then performed within each segment and one \u2018randomized\u2019 correlation coefficient was calculated for the entire interface. The correlation coefficients obtained from individual interfaces were then grouped together in a histogram (see <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>). For uncorrelated data, one expects a median correlation of 0. Furthermore, the longer the segment length the more will the coefficient distribution tighten up with a peak at zero correlation. The length scale of cadherin-stress coupling was defined as the value of <b>\u0394</b>l for which the median correlation coefficient of the randomized pairs falls below 50% of the correct pairing (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>); this is to say that for shorter segment lengths, the randomized and correct pairings exhibit similar correlations. We cannot identify whether the abrogation of distinct correlation coefficients is related to the absence of finer force and cadherin co-variations or because FEM cannot resolve finer stress variations. Thus, this limit also may define an upper bound for the resolution of sub-junctional forces."

Each calculation step is not particularly demanding with respect to computational hardware. For instance, no large memory is required and the entire analysis can thus be performed on normal computers. With respect to computation time, the most demanding step by far is the detection of bead displacements that are the input for the traction force calculations. It is an established method based on correlative template matching and takes on the order of several hours per video. In contrast, solving the thin-plate model is much faster and takes only several minutes. We note however that the actual computation time will be highly dependent on the individual hardware specifications and software implementation."

The method uses the principle of force balance to estimate cell-cell forces from cell-matrix forces and combines it with a thin plate modeling approach to extract a spatially resolved map of cell-cell forces in epithelial monolayers. This allows 1) sub cellular measurements at a higher resolution than could previously be achieved, and 2) spatially-resolved dynamic measurements for small clusters of any topology. The method is first validated for \u201ctree-like\u201d clusters, in which case it can be compared to the already established force imbalance method. The method is then applied to the generic case of \u201cloop\u201d clusters, in which case this is the only method that up to now can give results. An interesting variant of this experiment is the use of \u201cmosaic clusters\u201d, where a molecular player of monolayer mechanics is depleted in a subset of cells within the cluster."

In classical monolayer stress microscopy, this might be a better assumption because in this case large sheets of cells are observed without cellular resolution. Here however, the authors focus on small clusters of cells where cell contractility, stiffness, ECM adhesion, etc., vary from cell to cell, as it is also evident from the supplementary movies. In the Materials and Methods section, the authors suggest that this assumption might not be as severe as one might think; eventually the method reconstructs (cell-cell) forces from (cell-matrix) forces, thus the details of the material model might somehow drop out because they are used twice, once in the forward and once in the backward direction. However, this is a rather vague argument, could it be backed up by more explicit theoretical considerations?"

The method provides a relatively rough estimate of the force (14% precision as documented by the authors in a four-cell case, but probably less in larger clusters) whereas the correlation between force and E-cadherin concentration is a highly debated issue that requires exact force measurement. To be fully convincing, the positive correlation between force and E-cadherin and the increased correlation in growing and shrinking junctions, should be confirmed in cell doublets or linear triplets with exact intercellular force measurements. The time correlations displayed in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a> are particularly inconclusive.

In order to demonstrate the way the method works, it seems more helpful to proceed to <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> and to place <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> later or in the supplement. The quantities analyzed in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> are not defined well and it is not clear how the numbers for N and n correspond to each other. In <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> it should be explained why the sign inverted traction forces are shown. I also note that the network representation is rather dense and maybe even redundant, because the connectivity information on the edges can also be read off from the nodes (I understand that this information is used later to analyze force distribution and I do not mind leaving it in if the authors find this essential, but it shows again that the presentation is very crowded). What seems to be missing from this representation, though, seems to be information if a given node has resulted from a cell division. In <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, the authors use a very special definition of strain energy (using only the displacement resulting from a single cell) without discussing alternatives or limitations. Regarding the length scale analysed in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>, I wonder if the authors effectively extract the persistence length of the cell-cell contour; the explanations of the meaning of these length scales are rather hard to follow. In general, the authors should rethink how to make the presentation of their results more accessible to the general reader. I also note that Title and Abstract might be further sharpened.

In classical monolayer stress microscopy, this might be a better assumption because in this case large sheets of cells are observed without cellular resolution. Here however, the authors focus on small clusters of cells where cell contractility, stiffness, ECM adhesion, etc., vary from cell to cell, as it is also evident from the supplementary movies. In the Materials and methods section, the authors suggest that this assumption might not be as severe as one might think; eventually the method reconstructs (cell-cell) forces from (cell-matrix) forces, thus the details of the material model might somehow drop out because they are used twice, once in the forward and once in the backward direction. However, this is a rather vague argument, could it be backed up by more explicit theoretical considerations</i>?"

We note that, as the reviewers pointed out, the assumption of the cell cluster as a thin elastic sheet is an approach used in monolayer stress microscopy by Fredberg and colleagues, who have explicitly described how the material model of the thin plate representing the cell sheet is in fact irrelevant for reconstructing cell-cell stress distribution in the cell sheet (Tambe et al., Nature Materials, 2011). We agree with the reviewers that it will be interesting to test how a material model that does not assume homogeneity in elastic moduli within the cell cluster would alter the cell-cell force measurements; however, at this point, i.e. in the absence of independent measurements of the distribution of the visco-elastic tensor, it is rather unclear how to go about formulating such a refined model. At best, we could visualize cytoskeletal and focal adhesion proteins in the dynamic cell clusters. But it is still an enormous leap to define how the distribution of these proteins correlates with inhomogeneity in material property in a cell cluster. The critical point of this study is that we can show that despite the simplicity of the thin plate model, it is still possible to resolve cell-cell forces at a resolution that is biologically relevant, i.e. at the length scale of E-cadherin self-correlation at cell-cell junctions (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). This suggests that the inhomogeneity in the material properties, even for the analysis of subcellular force distributions, plays only a secondary role."

If there are gaps between the membranes, the algorithm will present the gaps as \u201choles\u201d in the cell cluster, and segments of \u201ccell junctions\u201d within the \u201choles\u201d are treated the very same way as junctions that are outside the tight cluster mask (see supplement for definition). Usually the gaps are so small, that they are still part of the dilated cluster mask, and are thus included in the cell plate model, albeit with a modulus that decays exponentially with Euclidian distance to the tight cluster mask. The algorithm may thus associate cell-cell stress with junction segments within such gaps. Note that for calculating junction lengths, these segments are not taken into account, which is again consistent with the treatment of other junction segments that are part of the dilated (but not of the tight) cluster mask. As these small gaps between the membranes are usually transient and the connection between cells maintained, it is reasonable not to fully neglect these regions during force calculations. We would like to note that, in the example shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> and <a href=\"#media4\">Movie 4</a>, although there was temporarily a gap at junction 7 after the division of cell 1 into cells 1 and 5, our method correctly indicate that the force transmission at junction 7 is extremely low."

From this, it would follow that in a cell model with a finer granularity in junction organization, the method potentially could extract shorter scale force fluctuations. We note that, of course, this argument does not directly address the reviewer\u2019s question. His/her question is one regarding the prediction of detectability (i.e. how short can a junction be to have a detectable cell-cell force) from the resolution. Usually, the detectability is significantly higher than the resolution (a principle used in optics to implement \u2018super-resolution\u2019 approaches like STORM or PALM). In our manuscript, we have measured cell-cell forces in many junctions shorter than 10 um (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2013figure supplement 1C</a>). To examine the cell-cell stress we were able to measure from these short junctions, we plotted below cell-cell stress magnitudes as a function of cell junction lengths for junctions with a minimal degree of 1 (such as cell pairs or linear clusters). Only junctions with a minimal degree of 1 were used to avoid potential false attribution of cell-cell stress from adjoining junctions. We noted that the distribution of cell-cell stress magnitudes for these junctions shorter or equal to 10\u00b5m is similar to that for junctions of all lengths, indicating that the analysis of cell-cell stress is independent of junction lengths."

To summarize: as previously reported by the Dufresne group and as we also showed in our manuscript, traction forces are higher along the outer periphery of the cluster, suggesting cell-cell forces derived from cell-matrix forces mainly at the cluster periphery. At the same time, as we reported in our manuscript, force transmission across a cell cluster is short-ranged due to the force scrambling and force anchoring mechanisms. On stiffer substrates, such mechanisms are more active, preventing force transmission to the center of the cluster, whereas on softer substrates, such mechanisms are less active, allowing force propagation through the cluster center. It is unclear why such mechanisms would be more active on stiffer compared to softer substrates, nevertheless, it has been shown by many reports that focal adhesions are larger (force anchoring mechanism) and actomyosin contractility is higher (force scrambling mechanism) in cells on stiffer substrates, and our laboratories have also shown that these differences extend multiple cell layers into a cell sheet (Ng et al., Journal of Cell Biology, 2012)."

We like the reviewer\u2019s suggestion of including information as to whether a node has resulted from a cell division; however, after much consideration we decided not to specifically highlight cells that result from cell divisions during a movie. One reason is that any two cells in a cluster may have originated from a cell division before the start of imaging.

For a cell cluster this means that forces from one cell will cause substrate deformations outside of its own footprint, for instance underneath the footprint of a neighboring cell.

A careful inspection of provided figures will show traction force vectors outside the footprint of the cells. There are several reasons for such traction forces outside the cluster footprint: the most important one is the limited spatial resolution of the traction force measurement. The presence of these traction force vectors outside the cell footprint presents a dilemma: One would ideally want to cut off the thin plate model at the tight cluster footprint, but then one would lose these \u201cexternal\u201d forces when setting up the force balance for the cluster. Our position on this dilemma is to include these forces by extending the tight cluster mask but on the other hand to give the mechanics \u201cat least\u201d a penalty with the distance to the detected cluster edge. Also note that the detection of the tight cluster mask is done automatically by image processing. This detection is associated with an uncertainty which for itself requires a certain lateral tolerance to make sure that significant traction forces are not excluded in the analysis."

If the findings on 35 kPa were due to a systematic error, one would expect to find the same pattern on 8kPa substrates. Furthermore, the reviewer should note that the interfaces of cells at the cluster boundary are usually fairly perpendicular to the cluster boundary.
