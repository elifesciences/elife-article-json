Despite these barriers, transcription through chromatin in vivo is highly efficient, suggesting the existence of factors that overcome this obstacle. To increase the resolution obtained by standard chromatin immunoprecipitation, we developed a novel strategy using micrococcal nuclease digestion of cross-linked chromatin. We find that the chromatin remodeler Chd1 is recruited to promoter proximal nucleosomes of genes undergoing active transcription, where Chd1 is responsible for the vast majority of PolII-directed nucleosome turnover. The expression of a dominant negative form of Chd1 results in increased stalling of PolII past the entry site of the promoter proximal nucleosomes. We find that Chd1 evicts nucleosomes downstream of the promoter in order to overcome the nucleosomal barrier and enable PolII promoter escape, thus providing mechanistic insight into the role of Chd1 in transcription and pluripotency."

Despite these barriers, transcription through chromatin in vivo is highly efficient, suggesting the existence of factors that overcome this obstacle. To increase the resolution obtained by standard chromatin immunoprecipitation, we developed a novel strategy using micrococcal nuclease digestion of cross-linked chromatin. We find that the chromatin remodeler Chd1 is recruited to promoter proximal nucleosomes of genes undergoing active transcription, where Chd1 is responsible for the vast majority of PolII-directed nucleosome turnover. The expression of a dominant negative form of Chd1 results in increased stalling of PolII past the entry site of the promoter proximal nucleosomes. We find that Chd1 evicts nucleosomes downstream of the promoter in order to overcome the nucleosomal barrier and enable PolII promoter escape, thus providing mechanistic insight into the role of Chd1 in transcription and pluripotency."

Chromatin limits the accessibility of DNA-binding factors to the underlying DNA sequence and presents a strong physical barrier that must be overcome by RNA polymerase II (PolII) during transcription. In vitro experiments have shown that transcription initiation is the most affected and that elongation is also highly inefficient unless nucleosomes are destabilized (<a href=\"#bib33\">Lorch et al., 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Hodges et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Jin et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Bintu et al., 2012</a>).

Chromatin remodelers use the energy from ATP hydrolysis to evict, assemble, and slide nucleosomes in order to guide the proper nucleosome positioning at key sites, such as eukaryotic promoters, where they maintain the nucleosome-depleted region (NDR) and phased flanking nucleosomes (<a href=\"#bib15\">Hartley and Madhani, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Gkikopoulos et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Tolkunov et al., 2011</a>).

Furthermore, they can be separated into two groups based upon their requirement for extra-nucleosomal DNA. First, ISWI, INO80/SWR1 and CHD require extra-nucleosomal DNA to remodel nucleosomes, whereby they are primarily involved in nucleosome assembly and generating equally spaced arrays by binding to stretches of exposed DNA and shifting nucleosomes into the gap (<a href=\"#bib66\">Whitehouse et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">McKnight et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Udugama et al., 2011</a>). Second, SWI/SNF and RSC remodelers slide or evict nucleosomes irrespective of extra-nucleosomal DNA (<a href=\"#bib65\">Whitehouse et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Lorch et al., 2011</a>).The potential role of remodelers in overcoming the nucleosomal barrier has not been fully investigated."

However, the promoter chromatin architecture is different in metazoans, with the TSS embedded in the nucleosome-depleted region, raising the possibility that this differing chromatin landscape contributes to metazoan PolII accumulating to high levels ahead of the first nucleosome (<a href=\"#bib35\">Mavrich et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Schones et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Rahl et al., 2010</a>). Here, we show that mammalian Chd1 controls nucleosome dynamics at actively transcribed genes. We find that Chd1 is responsible for the vast majority of PolII-directed nucleosome turnover at the promoter and is required to allow efficient PolII promoter escape, with PolII becoming stalled in the absence of Chd1 activity. Stalling with the loss of Chd1 activity implies that Chd1 is required to overcome the nucleosomal barrier to allow transcription within a chromatin context<i>.</i> In contrast, in the gene body, Chd1 reassembles nucleosomes and suppresses histone turnover. Interestingly, mammalian Chd1 is required for pluripotency of embryonic stem (ES) cells by maintaining euchromatin and is also required for efficient reprogramming, suggesting that Chd1 plays a key role in mammalian cellular identity (<a href=\"#bib12\">Gaspar-Maia et al., 2009</a>). Through both positively and negatively impacting histone dynamics, Chd1 plays roles in transcription and in regulating pluripotency and reprogramming."

The K510R Chd1 mutation eliminates the catalytic activity without disrupting its ability to interact with other proteins, thereby generating a dominant negative (<a href=\"#bib6\">Corona et al., 2004</a>). Mutation of this conserved lysine residue has been used to functionally investigate various chromatin remodelers including Brahma and ISWI in <i>Drosophila</i> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Elfring et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Deuring et al., 2000</a>). In comparison to knocking down Chd1 expression, a dominant negative approach is less likely to enable redundant mechanisms to mask protein functions. Western analysis indicated that the FLAG-tagged proteins migrated at the expected size and were only moderately over-expressed relative to endogenous Chd1 in the MEFs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>)."

                                "text": "First, we determined the genomic localization of Chd1 using chromatin immunoprecipitation in combination with high throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq). We found that under native conditions only 14% of Chd1 could be extracted (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). This led us to pursue a formaldehyde cross-linked ChIP strategy, which allows for harsher extraction conditions. Sonication is often used in ChIP to fragment the formaldehyde-cross-linked chromatin. This, however, only provides low resolution, as the fragment size is typically 100\u2013300 bp in comparison to the footprint of either PolII or Chd1, which is 35 bp and 20\u201345 bp respectively (<a href=\"#bib48\">Samkurashvili and Luse, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Ryan et al., 2011</a>). We therefore used <i>Micrococcal</i> nuclease (MNase) digestion of cross-linked chromatin to increase the resolution of ChIP-seq. MNase digests unprotected DNA, leaving DNA fragments corresponding to mono-nucleosomes and sub-nucleosomal fragments, presumably protected by proteins cross-linked to the extra-nucleosomal DNA (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). By using a modified Solexa library preparation protocol in combination with paired-end sequencing, we were able to map DNA fragments as small as \u223c35 bp (<a href=\"#bib16\">Henikoff et al., 2011</a>). By using MNase to fragment the chromatin and minimal sonication we were able to achieve essentially complete extraction of chromatin and associated proteins, thereby overcoming a significant limitation of native ChIP (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). This technique is highly transferable, as it requires no special tool development and uses current sequencing technology."

As expected, wild-type Chd1 was recruited to the 5\u2032 end of genes, similar to what has been shown for endogenous Chd1 in mouse ES cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Gaspar-Maia et al., 2009</a>). Furthermore, the dominant negative K510R-Chd1 showed a broadly similar chromatin recruitment pattern, consistent with the mutation not affecting interactions with recruiting factors. In addition, we found that the enrichment of Chd1 was primarily just downstream of the TSS, with recruitment correlating with PolII occupancy of the promoter, as measured in the MEFs expressing wild-type Chd1 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). PolII has previously been shown to crosslink to nucleosomes (<a href=\"#bib26\">Koerber et al., 2009</a>). Therefore, mapping the DNA recovered by immunoprecipitation of these cross-linked PolII:nucleosome complexes will not identify the exact binding site of PolII on DNA. To precisely map the position of PolII and Chd1, we mapped 35\u201375 bp fragments, which more closely corresponds to the footprint of PolII and Chd1 (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). For PolII, there was a shift of the maximal occupancy towards the TSS, from +150 bp for all fragment sizes to a peak centered over the TSS, likely indicating that the larger fragments correspond to PolII crosslinked to the +1 nucleosome. Similarly, for both wild-type and K510R Chd1, larger size classes indicated Chd1 crosslinked to the well-positioned +1 nucleosome. Analysis of short fragments, however, indicated wild-type Chd1 was enriched over the beginning of the gene body with a steady decline from +500 bp. However, in the absence of ATPase activity, K510R-Chd1 density peaked downstream of the TSS at +60 bp, where it accumulated to higher levels than wild-type Chd1 and was depleted in the gene body (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). To confirm that mapping of short fragments was similar to that of all fragments, genes were ranked by PolII promoter occupancy as determined from all fragment lengths and separated into quintiles (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>). We find a correlation between Chd1 recruitment and PolII occupancy, as seen for all fragment lengths. Overall, this novel ChIP-seq strategy based on the MNase digestion of cross-linked chromatin and the mapping of short fragments allows precise mapping of the footprint of PolII and Chd1. We find that Chd1 binds just downstream of the TSS, correlates with PolII occupancy at the promoter and requires ATPase activity for the binding to extend into the gene body."

Therefore we determined the nucleosome profile in cells expressing either wild-type or K510R Chd1 by mapping mono-nucleosome-sized fragments recovered from the sequencing of MNase digested, cross-linked chromatin. Cells expressing wild-type Chd1 display the classical metazoan nucleosome organization pattern, with a pronounced nucleosome depleted region (NDR) containing the TSS, flanked by well positioned nucleosomes, with the +1 nucleosome entry site \u223c50 bp downstream of the TSS (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Mavrich et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Schones et al., 2008</a>). In addition, the position of the +1 nucleosome corresponded to the level of PolII promoter occupancy, with the 5\u2032 edge progressively moving towards the TSS, to approximately +15 bp for genes with the lowest PolII occupancy, as previously indicated by ranking human nucleosome positions by steady-state RNA levels (<a href=\"#bib50\">Schones et al., 2008</a>). The positioning of the nucleosomes was not affected by the loss of Chd1 activity, but the nucleosome occupancy was reduced both upstream and downstream of the TSS. In contrast to <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, where deletion of Chd1 had no effect on the +1 nucleosome occupancy but only the surrounding nucleosomes, blocking Chd1 activity in MEFs affected promoter proximal nucleosomes including the +1 nucleosome (<a href=\"#bib13\">Gkikopoulos et al., 2011</a>). In <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, the TSS is found just within the +1 nucleosome, thereby suggesting that pre-initiation complex formation requires loss of the +1 nucleosome (<a href=\"#bib44\">Rhee and Pugh, 2012</a>). However, metazoans have a different promoter nuclear architecture with the TSS embedded in the nucleosome depleted region and the +1 nucleosome entry site \u223c50 bp downstream (<a href=\"#bib35\">Mavrich et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Schones et al., 2008</a>). Therefore, loss of the mammalian +1 nucleosome occupancy observed here likely reflects a unique role of mammalian Chd1 because of differences to <i>S. cerevisiae</i> in promoter architecture and perhaps the mechanism of transcription through the promoter proximal chromatin. Decreased nucleosome occupancy was also apparent throughout the gene body including upstream of the transcriptional end site (TES)."

Despite this relatively flat profile at the TSS being insensitive to the expression of K510R-Chd1, it suggests that the \u2018open\u2019 and \u2018closed\u2019 promoter architecture, as defined by the existence of an NDR at the TSS, can be categorized based on recruitment of remodelers such as Chd1 (<a href=\"#bib4\">Cairns, 2009</a>). The loss of nucleosome occupancy within the last 1 kb of the gene body was independent of the level of Chd1 recruitment to the promoter (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). In contrast, the loss of nucleosome occupancy in the gene body correlated with level of Chd1 binding in the gene body (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). This indicates that Chd1 action within the distal part of the gene body is independent of its recruitment to the promoter."

Nucleosome occupancy was reduced at both the promoter and the gene body upon knockdown of Chd1, as seen with the expression of K510R-Chd1 (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). To determine the concordance between knockdown and expression of the dominant negative, genes were ranked by transgenic wild-type Chd1 occupancy. Genes with the highest Chd1 occupancy were most affected by knockdown, suggesting that knockdown of Chd1 phenocopied the expression of the dominant negative. Overall, loss of Chd1 activity resulted in reduced nucleosome occupancy at both the promoter and the gene body confirming that Chd1 is involved in defining the chromatin landscape."

We used CATCH-IT (covalent attachment of tags to capture histones and identify turnover) to measure nucleosome turnover (<a href=\"#bib7\">Deal et al., 2010</a>). CATCH-IT involves the pulse labeling of newly synthesized proteins and the subsequent purification of newly assembled nucleosomes. Our results showed that histone turnover was most rapid at the nucleosomes flanking either side of the promoter and progressively decreased towards the gene body (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). We observed marked changes in nucleosome turnover upon the expression of K510R-Chd1. First, nucleosome turnover was significantly reduced on either side of the TSS (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Second, nucleosome turnover was significantly increased within the gene body, evident from \u223c500 bp downstream of the TSS and also in the gene body upstream of the TES (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). These results suggest opposing roles for Chd1 in regulating nucleosome turnover at the promoter and the gene body. We found that the role of Chd1 in regulating nucleosome turnover at the promoter and the gene body is independent of gene length (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). This is in contrast to yeast, where a previous study indicated Chd1 protects long genes from nucleosome replacement in the gene body (<a href=\"#bib42\">Radman-Livaja et al., 2012</a>). In yeast, the magnitude of the effect on nucleosome turnover was approximately equivalent at the promoter and the gene body (<a href=\"#bib42\">Radman-Livaja et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Smolle et al., 2012</a>). However, we find that the primary action of mammalian Chd1 on driving nucleosome turnover is at the promoter, which might suggest a different function of Chd1 in mammals."

This is consistent with several studies suggesting that there is lower retention of the complete octamer at high transcriptional rates than at lower ones (<a href=\"#bib25\">Kireeva et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Thiriet and Hayes, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bintu et al., 2011</a>). Nevertheless, nucleosome turnover was highly variable at low levels of elongating PolII density, indicating that there is significant gene-to-gene variation in the mechanism of PolII transit through nucleosomes at low rates of transcription. Nucleosome turnover in the gene body was increased in cells expressing K510R-Chd1, with the increase approximately constant at all densities of elongating PolII, suggesting an equivalent contribution by Chd1 in the suppression of nucleosome turnover irrespective of transcription rate (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>; lower panel). We sought to further understand the nature of Chd1 action in the gene body by studying potential recruitment mechanisms. As previously discussed, the loss of nucleosome occupancy within the distal regions of the gene body did not scale with Chd1 recruitment to the promoter. This suggests separable Chd1 recruitment to the promoter and the gene body. We found that the level of both wildtype and K510R-Chd1 recruitment to the gene body positively correlated with elongating PolII density within the gene body (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). Taken together, these observations suggest that occupancy of Chd1 at the promoter and the gene body correlates with the amount of PolII in the respective genomic compartments. The surprising lack of correlation between Chd1 occupancy and suppression of nucleosome turnover in the mutant suggests that Chd1 is not absolutely required for turnover at high transcription rates. Overall, these results suggest that Chd1 is recruited to actively transcribing chromatin where it is involved in the suppression of nucleosome turnover within the gene body."

We sought to determine if this reduction correlated with PolII promoter density given that both Chd1 occupancy and loss in nucleosome occupancy was most pronounced at genes with high PolII promoter density. Genes with higher levels of PolII displayed increased nucleosome turnover surrounding the TSS (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), as might have been expected from the positive correlation between steady-state RNA levels and nucleosome turnover (<a href=\"#bib7\">Deal et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Yang et al., 2013</a>). Turnover outside of the promoter region remained high in the absence of Chd1 activity, but was markedly reduced within the promoter proximal region (\u2212350 to +350 bp) encompassing the \u22121 nucleosome, the TSS and the +1 and +2 nucleosomes (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>). We determined the average CATCH-IT signal within the promoter proximal region as a function of PolII occupancy (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). At low to intermediate PolII densities, we found that cells expressing wildtype-Chd1 displayed a positive correlation between PolII density and nucleosome turnover, with turnover reaching a ceiling value at high levels of PolII. In contrast, expression of the dominant negative Chd1 resulted in the near-complete abrogation of turnover to basal levels for all levels of PolII occupancy. Knockdown of endogenous Chd1 resulted in a partial reduction in nucleosome turnover at the promoter (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), consistent with either incomplete knockdown or redundant factors. The striking loss of nucleosome turnover in the K510R-Chd1 mutant suggests that Chd1 is responsible for the vast majority of PolII-directed nucleosome turnover within the promoter proximal region. In summary, by analyzing nucleosome dynamics in combination with steady-state nucleosome occupancy, our results suggest that Chd1 is responsible for PolII-directed nucleosome turnover at promoters but suppresses nucleosome turnover within gene bodies. Despite these opposite actions of Chd1 in nucleosome turnover kinetics, we find that Chd1 is required to maintain net nucleosome occupancy both around the promoter and within the gene body."

In fission yeast, approximately half of Chd1 ortholog bound promoters showed a change in nucleosomal occupancy, with the vast majority increasing histone H3 density upon loss of Chd1 and no significant change in gene expression (<a href=\"#bib64\">Walfridsson et al., 2007</a>). In vitro analysis of the <i>S. cerevisiae PHO5</i> gene promoter indicated that Chd1 was required to remove the +1 nucleosome, which occludes the TSS, but no robust change in gene expression was observed in vivo without the synergistic loss of the chromatin remodeler ISWI (<a href=\"#bib9\">Ehrensberger and Kornberg, 2011</a>). To better interpret the transcriptional consequences of the alterations in mammalian chromatin architecture at the promoter, we established the changes in PolII distribution upon K510R-Chd1 expression by performing ChIP-seq with an antibody against the N-terminus of the largest subunit of PolII, which recognizes total PolII independent of phosphorylation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). The majority of PolII was bound to the promoter region, as expected given the prevalence of promoter proximal pausing in metazoans and consistent with the idea that promoter escape is a major barrier to productive elongation (<a href=\"#bib27\">Krumm et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Rahl et al., 2010</a>). This is in contrast to <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, where the majority of transcriptional control is at the level of PolII recruitment to the promoter, with a relatively even distribution of PolII across the gene (<a href=\"#bib58\">Stargell and Struhl, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Robert et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Rhee and Pugh, 2012</a>). Unexpectedly, the expression of K510R-Chd1 resulted in increased PolII occupancy within the promoter region and was most apparent at genes with the highest PolII occupancy, suggesting a role for Chd1 in the distribution of PolII."

To distinguish these alternatives, we established the distribution of actively elongating PolII using an antibody that recognizes the serine-2-phosphorylated elongating form (PolII Ser2phos) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). The signal for PolII Ser2phos increased after the promoter region and continued into the gene body, as expected for elongating PolII. In cells expressing K510R-Chd1, the level of PolII Ser2phos was reduced throughout the gene body, with the effect most pronounced at the genes with highest level of PolII occupancy at the promoter, indicating a role of Chd1 in enabling promoter escape. Alternatively, Chd1 might be affecting the elongation rate within the gene body. To test this possibility, the distribution of PolII Ser2phos was normalized to the average density across the first 5 kb of the gene body (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). We found no significant change in the distribution of elongating PolII, suggesting that Chd1 does not affect elongation rate in the gene body.

This raised the possibility that the promoter proximal nucleosomes at processive genes are acting as dynamic barriers to transcription. We therefore sought to understand how PolII transits through the promoter proximal nucleosomes in the absence of functioning Chd1. The total PolII ChIP-seq profile was plotted over the promoter region of these highly processive genes, which become stalled following the expression of K510R-Chd1. In contrast to the relatively even profile for PolII in the cells expressing wildtype-Chd1, the absence of Chd1 activity resulted in clear peaks in the PolII distribution (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>). These peaks precede each of the promoter proximal nucleosomes and are shifted upstream relative to the sites of action of Chd1 at the nucleosomes, with PolII accumulating \u223c20 bp inside the entry site of the +1 nucleosome. This suggests that Chd1 functions at processive genes to remove the nucleosomal barrier ahead of PolII and in its absence PolII stalls in front of the now static promoter proximal nucleosomes leading to a reduced efficiency of promoter escape."

Through the expression of a dominant negative form of the chromatin remodeler Chd1, we have shown that Chd1 is responsible for the vast majority of nucleosome turnover at the promoter and is required for PolII promoter escape. Our analysis identifies promoter proximal nucleosomes as a barrier to PolII promoter escape and suggests how Chd1 overcomes this barrier.

                        "text": "The role for Chd1 in gene bodies is consistent with in vitro studies indicating that Chd1 actively assembles chromatin and slides nucleosomes into ordered arrays (<a href=\"#bib34\">Lusser et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Torigoe et al., 2013</a>). In vivo, Chd1 is likely to function in reassembly of nucleosomes displaced during elongation. In the absence of Chd1 activity, reassembly is compromised, leading to the deposition of de novo synthesized nucleosomes, consistent with observations in yeast (<a href=\"#bib13\">Gkikopoulos et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Hennig et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Radman-Livaja et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Smolle et al., 2012</a>). The close correlation between Chd1 occupancy and elongating PolII density indicates a possible mechanism for the recruitment of Chd1, consistent with studies indicating that Chd1 associates with elongation factors including polymerase-associated factor (PAF1), DSIF and FACT (<a href=\"#bib52\">Simic et al., 2003</a>). In vitro remodeling by Chd1 is dependent upon its C-terminal DNA binding domain interacting with extranucleosomal DNA and may also be required for efficient Chd1 recruitment (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kagalwala et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Stockdale et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">McKnight et al., 2011</a>). More specifically, the DNA immediately upstream of the nucleosome has been shown to be important for the initial stage of nucleosome movement in ISWI-type remodelers (<a href=\"#bib69\">Zofall et al., 2004</a>). Single-molecule optical trap experiments suggest that PolII transcribes through a nucleosome by the <i>in cis</i> transfer of histones, particularly the H3:H4 tetramer, to DNA upstream of PolII via the formation of a transient DNA loop (<a href=\"#bib18\">Hodges et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Kulaeva et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bintu et al., 2011</a>). This might suggest that Chd1 is recruited to the gene body via the elongation complex and is then targeted to the nucleosome substrate via binding to the exposed DNA loop immediately adjacent to the histone octamer to facilitate the <i>in cis</i> transfer of histone octamers."

                        "text": "Chd1 is primarily found at the 5\u2032 end of PolII bound genes and is particularly enriched at genes undergoing processive transcription. By increasing the resolution of standard cross-linked ChIP-seq, we find that Chd1 binds within the leading edge of promoter proximal nucleosomes, where it is required for virtually all of PolII-directed nucleosome turnover at the promoter. Expression of K510R-Chd1 results in reduced steady-state nucleosome occupancy. Despite this, PolII was observed to accumulate just within the entry site of promoter proximal nucleosomes and a concomitant increase in the stalling index, indicative of an increase in the barrier to PolII promoter escape. This increased PolII stalling is consistent with the reduced nucleosome turnover at the promoter, indicating a more static chromatin structure forming a barrier to promoter escape. The increase in stalling occurs despite a decrease in steady-state nucleosome occupancy, highlighting the importance of kinetic measurements for chromatin structure. The apparent discrepancy of an increase in the barrier to PolII accompanying a decrease in steady-state nucleosomal occupancy can be most easily reconciled if Chd1 acts to evict the nucleosomes ahead of PolII transit and then reassemble nucleosomes in the wake of PolII. In the absence of Chd1, nucleosome eviction is likely to still occur as a result of transcription albeit at a lower rate, and the CATCH-IT analysis suggests de novo nucleosome deposition is greatly reduced, overall leading to the reduced steady-state nucleosome occupancy."

                        "text": "These opposing activities at the gene body and the promoter may perhaps be explained through differing mechanisms by which Chd1 engages with the nucleosomal substrate after the point of recruitment. As discussed, the assembly activity in the gene body is likely to be directed via the non-specific DNA binding domain interacting with extra-nucleosomal DNA. A recent in vitro study directly tethered yeast Chd1 to the nucleosomal substrate independent of the DNA binding domain and observed nucleosome sliding and eviction more typical of SWI/SNF-type remodelers (<a href=\"#bib37\">Patel et al., 2013</a>). This suggests that the observed nucleosome eviction by Chd1 at the promoter is likely to reflect activity independent of the DNA binding domain, raising the question of how Chd1 engages with the nucleosomal substrate. The tandem chromodomains in human Chd1 have been shown to specifically interact with H3K4me3, whereas in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, the chromodomains lack key tryptophan residues required for H3K4me3 binding (<a href=\"#bib11\">Flanagan et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Sims et al., 2005</a>). Therefore activity dependent on the chromodomains provides a tantalizing explanation for the role of mammalian Chd1 in nucleosome eviction at the promoter in contrast to yeast Chd1, where Chd1 does not affect occupancy of the +1 nucleosome (<a href=\"#bib13\">Gkikopoulos et al., 2011</a>). This unique requirement for mammalian Chd1 to overcome the nucleosomal barrier to PolII at the promoter may reflect differences from yeast in both chromatin architecture and transcriptional regulation, with yeast having the TSS buried within the +1 nucleosome and primarily regulating transcription through recruitment (<a href=\"#bib45\">Robert et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Rhee and Pugh, 2012</a>)."

                        "text": "These functions of mammalian Chd1 in defining nucleosome dynamics during transcription may explain phenomena associated with its loss. Given that the majority of post-translational modifications (PTMs) are found on either H3 or H4, the retention of the H3:H4 tetramer during transcription has been proposed to have a role in the maintenance of chromatin states throughout the genome (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kulaeva et al., 2009</a>). This suggests that the increased histone turnover observed in the gene body in the absence of Chd1 activity could compromise epigenetic regulation, and might explain the observation that Chd1 is required for maintaining euchromatin in ES cells by preventing heterochromatin formation (<a href=\"#bib12\">Gaspar-Maia et al., 2009</a>). In contrast, the Chd1 dependent turnover observed at the promoter would have the effect of removing histone \u2018memory\u2019 and might explain the requirement for Chd1 in reprogramming through the deposition of de novo histones at the promoter to allow the reactivation of pluripotency genes (<a href=\"#bib12\">Gaspar-Maia et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Jullien et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Skene and Henikoff, 2012</a>). Given that doxorubicin, a commonly used anti-cancer drug, enhances nucleosome turnover, the identification of Chd1 in directing nucleosome turnover provides a mechanistic basis for its tumor suppressor role and may indicate the molecular basis for carcinogenesis in the absence of Chd1 (<a href=\"#bib20\">Huang et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Liu et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Yang et al., 2013</a>). Overall, these observations point to a key role for Chd1 in regulating the mammalian transcriptional landscape."

Here, they claim a loss in nucleosome occupancy without a change in positioning. I find the effect very small overall, even when PolII levels are considered, but much more clear in the case where the highest quintile of Chd1 occupancy is examined. The authors note a difference in impact here in MEFs on the +1 nuc, vs in budding yeast where no change is observed following Chd1 loss, which I found interesting. I also found the correlation of Chd1 with 'open' promoters interesting. The authors then apply an alternative shRNA approach to knock down Chd1, and observe similar (and even somewhat stronger) results."

However, this is really confined to the nucleosome directly on, or adjacent to, the TSS; here it is clear and interesting, however, regarding the gene body, I found the difference with the dominant negative apparent, but the scale/magnitude quite small."

I found the data showing the peak of dominant negative Chd1 occupancy 50 bp inside the nucleosome very interesting, and consistent with current models of DNA translocation. Likewise, the peaks of PolII preceding nucleosomes in the early gene body supports the authors interesting claim of utilizing Chd1 activity to help facilitate PolII passage and reassembly behind the polymerase."

In particular, the data is reminiscent of Radman-Livaja et al. (PLOS Genetics 2012), where it is shown in yeast that loss of Chd1 activity leads to slower turnover of nucleosomes over the promoter and faster turnover in gene bodies and near 3' ends."

In fact that paper showed lower nucleosome occupancy near promoters in remodeling deficient cells, in total agreement with the current manuscript. Furthermore, the Kornberg lab (Ehrensberger, PNAS 2011) has done nice work in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> showing that Chd1 is a promoter-specific chromatin remodeler, and work in <i>S. pombe</i> (Walfridsson et al, EMBO 2007) showed that Chd1 localized particularly to promoter regions where it helped remove nucleosomes near the transcription start site to enable transcription. Thus, I don't see significant novelty in the majority of conclusions presented and don't find compelling the suggested connection between Chd1 activity at promoters and the metazoan-specific phenomenon of promoter stalling of RNAP. On this point, the hypothesis that PolII is being blocked in Chd1 mutant cells by nucleosomes despite the overall occupancy of the +1 nucleosome being lower is not clear to me. I can see how PolII could be blocked by an increase in nucleosome occupancy or by more static nucleosomes, but i.e. not what is indicated by this data. What the authors show is reduced +1 occupancy and reduced +1 turnover, which is most simply explained by nucleosomes being removed and not efficiently replaced. There is no clear data that sheds light on how this lower occupancy or failure to re-assemble nucleosomes might inhibit PolII."

Typically our lab has favored native ChIP conditions. However, in mammalian cells we found that under native ChIP conditions only 14% of Chd1; 10% of PolII and \u223c25% of histone H3 could be extracted, raising concerns that perhaps native ChIP would only investigate a specific genomic compartment of Chd1 binding. In comparison, sonication is typically used to both fragment chromatin and solubilize proteins in crosslinking ChIP, which results in low resolution and variable recovery. Here, we present the novel combination of formaldehyde crosslinking, MNase digestion to yield protected fragments and limited sonication to solubilize near 100% of Chd1 and chromatin. Through this technique we are able to generate high resolution data of Chd1 and PolII distributions. This was vital to observe the site of action of Chd1 on nucleosomes, as had been previously indicated in vitro (PMID: 16086025 and 16518397) and the stalled PolII in front of nucleosomes upon loss of Chd1 activity. This highly transferable technique has broad appeal to the scientific community, as it requires no special tool generation and uses current sequencing technology.

There are, however, fundamental differences in both transcription and chromatin context at the promoter between mammals and yeast. First, in yeast the transcription start site is embedded within the +1 nucleosome (PMID: 22258509), implying that the +1 nucleosome must be mobilized prior to pre-initiation complex formation. In contrast, in mammals the TSS is embedded within the nucleosome depleted region and the +1 nucleosome entry site found on average \u223c50 bp downstream. Second, in mammals the vast majority of genes display PolII accumulation at the promoter region (91% of genes have a traveling ratio &gt;2; PMID: 20434984), whereas in yeast the PolII density is more evenly distributed along the length of the gene (PMID: 21248844; 22258509). This suggests a fundamental difference in the mechanism of PolII transit through the promoter proximal nucleosomes, which is supported by the identification of specific role of mammalian Chd1 at the promoter in driving turnover. In contrast to yeast where the magnitude of change in turnover at the promoter is approximately the same as in the gene body (PMID: 22807688; 22922743), the absence of mammalian Chd1 activity leads to a much greater reduction in promoter histone turnover. We present the novel finding that mammalian Chd1 is responsible for almost all PolII dependent turnover at the promoter and loss of this activity results in further accumulation of PolII at the promoter, a metazoan specific phenomenon. The previous yeast studies have not identified a consequence for transcription upon the loss of turnover at the promoter in the absence of Chd1. As such, our study identifies novel roles of Chd1 in terms of transcription related chromatin changes and places Chd1 as vital in the manipulation of metazoan specific chromatin structure."

We find that a unique role of mammalian Chd1 is to drive PolII-dependent nucleosome turnover at the promoter, indicating the presence of more static nucleosomes at the promoter region in the absence of Chd1 activity. In the absence of Chd1 activity, we find that the barrier to PolII promoter escape is increased consistent with a more static chromatin barrier. The text has been altered to clarify this point (third paragraph of the Discussion)."

Therefore analyzing events that occur at the level of PolII are more relevant to the Chd1-related processes that we are studying here rather than analyzing the RNA produced downstream, especially as Chd1 has been proposed to interact with splicing factors (PMID: 18042460). In any case there is a close association between GRO-seq and PolII-Ser2-phos ChIP (PMID: 23062713), so nascent chain analysis is unlikely to provide any further insight. Therefore we favor our approach to measure ongoing transcription by genome-wide mapping of elongating PolII. Moreover we show that this reduction in elongating PolII density is more pronounced at genes with higher levels of Chd1 occupancy and is concomitant with an accumulation of PolII at the promoter, likely indicating a direct effect."

Genes with the most paused PolII lack a significant +1 nucleosome signal and are paused by separate factors (GAGA and NELF) whereas less stably paused, more processive genes have a strong +1 nucleosome signal that causes more transient pausing.

We have also analyzed the data and find a similar situation in mammals, with processive genes having higher promoter proximal nucleosome occupancy and further show that the +1 nucleosome is more dynamic at processive genes (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>).
