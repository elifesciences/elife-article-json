The inevitable tradeoff of this plasticity is spontaneous receptor activation and spurious signaling. We show that a ligand-mediated switch in EGFR trafficking enables suppression of spontaneous activation while maintaining EGFR\u2019s capacity to transduce extracellular signals. Autocatalytic phosphorylation of tyrosine 845 on unliganded EGFR monomers is suppressed by vesicular recycling through perinuclear areas with high PTP1B activity. Ligand-binding results in phosphorylation of the c-Cbl docking tyrosine and ubiquitination of the receptor. This secondary signal relies on EGF-induced EGFR self-association and switches suppressive recycling to directional trafficking. The re-routing regulates EGFR signaling response by the transit-time to late endosomes where it is switched-off by high PTP1B activity. This ubiquitin-mediated switch in EGFR trafficking is a uniquely suited solution to suppress spontaneous activation while maintaining responsiveness to EGF."

The inevitable tradeoff of this plasticity is spontaneous receptor activation and spurious signaling. We show that a ligand-mediated switch in EGFR trafficking enables suppression of spontaneous activation while maintaining EGFR\u2019s capacity to transduce extracellular signals. Autocatalytic phosphorylation of tyrosine 845 on unliganded EGFR monomers is suppressed by vesicular recycling through perinuclear areas with high PTP1B activity. Ligand-binding results in phosphorylation of the c-Cbl docking tyrosine and ubiquitination of the receptor. This secondary signal relies on EGF-induced EGFR self-association and switches suppressive recycling to directional trafficking. The re-routing regulates EGFR signaling response by the transit-time to late endosomes where it is switched-off by high PTP1B activity. This ubiquitin-mediated switch in EGFR trafficking is a uniquely suited solution to suppress spontaneous activation while maintaining responsiveness to EGF."

This system acts to suppress the spontaneous activation of EGFRs, whilst maintaining the ability of the cell to respond to epidermal growth factor.

EGFR signaling is implicated in embryonic development, tissue homeostasis and wound healing (<a href=\"#bib64\">Yu et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Sibilia et al., 2007</a>), while EGFR overexpression and hyper-activation through genetic alterations have been linked to malignant transformation (<a href=\"#bib42\">Rowinsky, 2004</a>). Mutation-induced loss of autoinhibitory interactions or enhanced receptor expression levels, frequently elevate the basal phosphorylation and activation status of EGFR (<a href=\"#bib2\">Arteaga and Engelman, 2014</a>). The autoinhibitory interactions include the tethered conformation of the extracellular domain (<a href=\"#bib13\">Ferguson et al., 2003</a>) as well as receptor-membrane interactions and the local intrinsic disorder of the \u03b1C helix in the N-lobe of the kinase domain (<a href=\"#bib1\">Arkhipov et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Endres et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Shan et al., 2012</a>).

Ligand\u00a0binding leads to receptor dimerization (<a href=\"#bib63\">Yarden and Schlessinger, 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Cochet et al., 1988</a>) and the formation of an asymmetric dimer of the intracellular kinase domains (<a href=\"#bib66\">Zhang et al., 2006</a>). This triggers phosphorylation <i>in trans</i> of regulatory and signaling tyrosine residues in the intracellular part of the receptor, and a subsequent recruitment of adaptor proteins that contain Src homology 2 domains (SH2) or phosphotyrosine-binding domains (PTB) such as c-Cbl (Y1045) or Grb2 (Y1068 and Y1086) (<a href=\"#bib56\">Ushiro and Cohen, 1980</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Moran et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Levkowitz et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Waterman et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Lemmon and Schlessinger, 2010</a>)."

However, phosphorylation of the conserved regulatory tyrosine Y845 in the activation loop of the EGFR kinase domain leads to an acceleration of its phosphorylation, potentiating EGFR kinase activity in an autocatalytic fashion (<a href=\"#bib45\">Shan et al., 2012</a>). Such an autocatalytic activation system that is coupled to PTP activity, by for example a double negative feedback, offers robustness against biological noise and conveys external stimuli into threshold-activated responses (<a href=\"#bib18\">Grecco et al., 2011</a>). Autocatalysis can lead to amplified self-activation of the receptor in the absence of a cognate ligand (<a href=\"#bib59\">Verveer, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Endres et al., 2013</a>), requiring high PTP activity at the plasma membrane (PM) to suppress. Such PTPs that act on EGFR with high catalytic efficiency (~2 orders of magnitude higher than EGFR) are PTP1B and TCPTP (<a href=\"#bib67\">Zhang et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Romsicki et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Fan et al., 2004</a>).

Although EGFR vesicular trafficking was extensively studied after ligand stimulation, little is known about the role of vesicular trafficking in suppressing spontaneous EGFR activation as well as regulating its signaling response. To assess how vesicular membrane dynamics modulates spontaneous and ligand-induced phosphorylation of EGFR, we studied three phosphorylation sites on EGFR with distinct functionality: 1) Y845\u2014a regulatory autocatalytic tyrosine whose phosphorylation increases EGFR activity (<a href=\"#bib45\">Shan et al., 2012</a>), 2) Y1045\u2014a site that upon phosphorylation affects vesicular trafficking of EGFR by binding the E3 ligase c-Cbl that ubiquitinates the receptor (<a href=\"#bib28\">Levkowitz et al., 1998</a>), and 3) Y1068\u2014a site that upon phosphorylation binds the adapter Grb2 via its SH2 domain to propagate signals in the cell (<a href=\"#bib34\">Okutani et al., 1994</a>)."

While unliganded monomeric receptors continuously recycle to the PM to suppress autocatalytic activation, ligand-bound dimeric receptors are ubiquitinated by the E3-ligase c-Cbl that commits them to unidirectional vesicular trafficking toward lysosomes. This route through perinuclear endosomes enables their efficient dephosphorylation by high local PTP activity to produce a finite signaling response to growth factors. We demonstrate by a compartmental model that ligand-responsive EGFR signaling can only occur in conjunction with suppression of spontaneous autocatalytic EGFR activation if a ligand-induced switch in EGFR trafficking changes its cyclic interaction with spatially partitioned PTPs to a sustained one."

The variance in ectopic expression of EGFR-mCitrine was thereby exploited to sample a broad range of receptor expression levels. The EGFR-mCitrine expression level in single cells was determined relative to endogenous EGFR by an independent immunofluorescence experiment where the level of endogenously expressed EGFR was quantified from the abscissa-intercept of a linear fit to an EGFR-mCitrine intensity versus anti-EGFR antibody intensity plot (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). This analysis showed that most COS-7 cells expressed EGFR-mCitrine at similar level as endogenous EGFR, whereas the expression varied by a factor 6 (from ~0.5\u20133) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>,\u00a0X-axis). The phosphorylation level of the autocatalytic Y845 site as well as the Cbl (Y1045) and Grb2 (Y1068) docking sites was determined for single cells as well as for cell populations by quantifying immunofluorescence staining (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>) and Western blots (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C\u2013E</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s3\">3</a>), respectively. To determine the levels of spontaneous EGFR phosphorylation by Western blot analysis, its expression was controlled by the amount of transfected EGFR-mCitrine encoding cDNA and quantified by the EGFR-mCitrine band intensity relative to the band of the maximally applied cDNA amount (3 \u03bcg) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C\u2013E</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s3\">3</a>). Single-cell immunofluorescence analyses showed that a wide range of auto-phosphorylation levels occur for similar EGFR expression in individual cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Despite this cell-to-cell variance in response, clear trends in the average phosphorylation of the individual sites as function of EGFR-mCitrine expression were observed. The average amount of spontaneously phosphorylated Y845 on EGFR increased ~ sixfold with the density of EGFR in cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, left panel). Upon EGF-stimulation, the relative phosphorylation of Y845 increased, exhibiting a clear dependency on the EGFR expression levels as well (elevated by ~ threefold for a ~ sixfold increase in EGFR), corroborating the autocatalytic function of Y845 (<a href=\"#bib45\">Shan et al., 2012</a>). The c-Cbl docking site Y1045 exhibited a very different response profile: spontaneous phosphorylation was weakly increased with EGFR expression (~ twofold increase), whereas EGF stimulation clearly resulted in phosphorylation levels that were independent of EGFR expression (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, middle panel). On the other hand, the average amount of spontaneously phosphorylated Y1068 strongly increased (by ~ eightfold) with the EGFR density in cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, right panel). However, in contrast to Y845, EGF stimulation increased its average phosphorylation independent of EGFR expression (<a href=\"#bib11\">Endres et al., 2013</a>)."

The background-corrected ratio of intensities (lower image) clearly shows areas of mismatch, where antibody staining failed to reach all available EGFR-mCitrine (red-yellow-white, ratio &gt; 2). We therefore quantified the average anti-EGFR fluorescence intensity in the image masked with the thresholded ratio-image (0.15 &lt; ratio mCitrine / anti-EGFR &lt; 1.5). This average anti-EGFR fluorescence intensity is plotted against the average whole-cell EGFR-mCitrine intensity (right panel, upper graph) for transfection with 0.5 \u00b5g (red) and 3 \u00b5g (green) cDNA. To be able to relate mCitrine fluorescence intensity with endogenous EGFR expression levels, this data was fitted with a linear model (straight lines with dashed lines for 95% confidence intervals), yielding a slope of m=1.15 \u00b1 0.13 and an abscissa intercept of b=190 \u00b1 25 (all data). This intercept corresponds to the anti-EGFR fluorescence without ectopic EGFR-mCitrine expression and m/b is the factor that translates mCitrine intensity to n-fold ectopic expression over endogenous levels. This quantification is almost irrespective of the amount of cDNA used for EGFR-mCitrine transfection. Compared to transfection with 0.5 \u00b5g cDNA (red), the frequency of a higher average EGFR-mCitrine intensity occurring (right panel, lower graphs) clearly increases when 3 \u00b5g (green) of cDNA were used, however, not by a factor of 6 that could be expected. For one, a larger amount of cDNA not only increases the amount of cDNA per cell, but also the number of transfected cells (transfection efficiency). Secondly, selection of cells under the microscope suffers from a bias toward transfected cells. However, we used all cells in a field of view to also incorporate weakly expressing cells in our results.

Thereby, the median values of the mCitrine intensity distributions (blue vertical lines) coincide (lowest plot) and the n-fold ectopic EGFR expression over mean endogenous level can be calculated for each series of experiments.

This 'ratio of fractions' (pre/EGF) gives a comparative measure of the auto-phosphorylation level of tyrosine residues as determined by immunofluorescence and Western blots. This analysis revealed that the extent of phosphorylation differed for the individual tyrosine residues, with a high correspondence between Western blot and immunofluorescence analysis (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a>). In both experiments, the c-Cbl docking Y1045 site was significantly less phosphorylated as compared to the autocatalytic (Y845) and the signaling site (Y1068). In order to disentangle the contributions of EGFR kinase from PTP activity in generating this spontaneous phosphorylation profile, phosphorylation of EGFR was induced by pervanadate (PV)-mediated inhibition of PTPs (<a href=\"#bib21\">Huyer et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Haj, 2002</a>). In this way, the phosphorylation profile reflects the catalytic efficiency of EGFR kinase for the three tyrosine residues. The autocatalytic Y845 site was approximately 2.5 times more phosphorylated at 5\u2019 PV stimulation as compared to 5\u2019 EGF stimulation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). This rapid phosphorylation is consistent with a self-amplifying, autocatalytic phosphorylation. Both the Grb2 (Y1068) and c-Cbl (Y1045) docking sites were phosphorylated to a ~2.5 times lower level than Y845 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). The ratio of PV-induced over the spontaneous phosphorylation profiles (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>) allowed an estimation of the relative contribution of PTP activity in suppressing phosphorylation of the three tyrosines (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). This analysis shows that the autocatalytic Y845 site requires higher PTP activity to be maintained in check as compared to the other two tyrosines. Moreover, the similar PTP activity that acts on Y1045 and Y1068 shows that the lower phosphorylation of Y1045 as compared to Y1068 is mostly due to differences in the catalytic efficiency of the EGFR kinase for these sites."

The phosphorylation of Y1045 was the least responsive to EGFR expression, which is consistent with a low catalytic efficiency of EGFR kinase for this site in the absence of ligand. Spontaneously phosphorylated EGFR largely remained at the PM (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>), which could result from the lack of c-Cbl binding to this inefficiently phosphorylated site. This steady state distribution is distinct from the EGF-induced internalized EGFR, which manifests in down-stream signaling where an increase in spontaneously phosphorylated EGFR clearly activates Akt but not Erk (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G,H</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>).

To this end, fluorescence anisotropy microscopy was used to detect self-association of EGFR by homo-FRET (<a href=\"#bib52\">Squire et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Varma and Mayor, 1998</a>). For this purpose, an EGFR construct where mCitrine is inserted via a linker between amino acids Q958 and G959 (EGFR-QG-mCitrine) was generated that displayed a similar phosphorylation response to EGF as C-terminally tagged EGFR (EGFR-mCitrine) in COS-7 cells (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). EGFR-QG-mCitrine exhibited homo-FRET upon dimerization as apparent from the EGF-induced decrease in anisotropy for all EGFR expression levels (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). In order to assess EGFR phosphorylation in the same experiment, mCherry tagged PTB (PTB-mCherry) (<a href=\"#bib4\">Batzer et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Offterdinger et al., 2004</a>) that targets the phosphorylated signaling tyrosines 1148/1086 was co-expressed and its co-localization with EGFR-QG-mCitrine was determined at the cell periphery. At high EGFR-QG-mCitrine expression levels, co-localization with PTB-mCherry could not be enhanced by EGF stimulation, demonstrating the auto-phosphorylation of EGFR in the absence of ligand (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). This spontaneously phosphorylated receptor remained mostly monomeric as shown by its high anisotropy (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), even after PV-treatment that fully phosphorylates the receptor (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>,<a href=\"#fig1\">1D</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). However, spontaneously activated EGFR at high expression levels still dimerizes upon ligand binding as apparent from the drop in anisotropy upon addition of EGF. These data are therefore consistent with mostly monomeric, spontaneously activated EGFR that is distinct from ligand-activated, self-associated EGFR."

Due to the shift in EGFR steady state distribution by ectopic Rab11a-BFP expression, most of the photo-activated or \u2013bleached EGFR resided on the RE. The fluorescence loss after photoactivation of EGFR fused to photoactivatable GFP (EGFR-paGFP) (<a href=\"#bib35\">Patterson, 2002</a>) on the RE (\u03c4= 273 \u00b1 15\u2009s), and the concomitant gain at the PM (\u03c4= 167 \u00b1 33\u2009s) shows that EGFR is recycled from the RE to the PM (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). The difference in \u03c4 stems from the difference in surface area of the RE in relation to the PM, which determines the rate of RE-dissociation and PM-association. The residence time of EGFR at the RE was estimated to be ~7.6min (k<sub>off</sub> = 2.22 10<sup>\u20133</sup>\u2009s-<sup>\u22121</sup>) based on fitting the FLAP data to a two-compartment model (see 'Materials and methods'). From the fluorescence recovery after photobleaching EGFR-mCitrine on the RE (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>, \u03c4= 540 \u00b1 47\u2009s), it was apparent that EGFR also enters the RE. The FLAP and FRAP data thus show that there is constitutive vesicular trafficking of EGFR to and from the RE. To ascertain that EGFR-mCitrine on the RE originates from the PM, a pulse/chase experiment was performed by conjugating tetrazine-TAMRA in a fast bioorthogonal chemical reaction to EGFR-GFP that contained a trans-cyclo-octene derivative of lysine (TCOK) (<a href=\"#bib23\">Lang et al., 2012</a>). This unnatural amino acid was site-specifically and co-translationally incorporated by genetic code expansion in HEK293 cells into the extracellular part of EGFR at position 128 (<a href=\"#bib23\">Lang et al., 2012</a>). TAMRA fluorescence of EGFR-(128TCOK)-GFP that was pulse labeled at the PM (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, t=0\u2009min) appeared 20\u2009min later in Rab11a positive perinuclear endosomes, but not in LAMP1-BFP marked lysosomes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). EGF stimulation, however, redirected a fraction of TAMRA-labeled EGFR-(128TCOK)-GFP to lysosomes (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). This indicates that vesicular recycling between the PM and the RE maintains a steady state with the majority of EGFR at the PM, whereas EGF stimulation redirects self-associated EGFR towards lysosomes thereby depleting it from the PM."

Co-localization of EGFR-mCitrine with Rab5-mCherry in quiescent cells showed that unliganded EGFR is localized in EEs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D,E</a>, 0\u00a0min). Upon stimulation with EGF, the co-localized Rab5-mCherry and EGFR-mCitrine signals increased, confirming that liganded receptors transit via EEs to LE/Lysosomes and further increase the size and number of Rab5-mCherry-positive EEs (<a href=\"#bib3\">Barbieri, 2000</a>) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D,F</a>). However, 15\u2019 PV-mediated PTP inhibition only marginally affected the detectable amount and size of Rab5-mCherry positive EEs with phosphorylated EGFR (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E,F</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). Photoactivation of EGFR-paGFP at the basal PM by TIRF microscopy, and the concurrent appearance of its fluorescence in Rab5-mCherry fluorescent vesicles confirmed that PM-residing EGFR recycles by transit through EEs (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). These experiments show that recycling of monomeric EGFR via the EE compartment maintains its high steady-state distribution at the PM irrespective of phosphorylation state, whereas the different vesicular trafficking fates of unliganded versus liganded EGFR are decided at the level of the EE."

The lowered phosphorylation of the three tyrosine sites upon ectopic expression of BFP-PTP1B showed that spontaneously phosphorylated EGFR is also dephosphorylated by PTP1B (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). To determine where this dephosphorylation occurs, we examined the interaction between EGFR-mCitrine and an mCherry-tagged substrate-trapping mutant of PTP1B (mCherry-PTP1B-D181A) by FLIM-FRET (<a href=\"#bib20\">Haj, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Sabet et al., 2015</a>). The spatially resolved fraction (\u03b1) of EGFR-mCitrine interacting with mCherry-PTP1B-D181A was computed using global analysis of FLIM data (<a href=\"#bib59\">Verveer, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Grecco et al., 2009</a>). An interacting fraction of EGFR-mCitrine and mCherry-PTP1B-D181A was only observed in the perinuclear region (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). The mean spatial coincidence between this EGFR-mCitrine and mCherry-PTP1B-D181A interaction and BFP-Rab11a (63 \u00b1 29% ; n= 20 cells; see 'Materials and methods') is consistent with EGFR being dephosphorylated by PTP1B on perinuclear membranes in the vicinity of the RE. BFP-Rab11a expression led to an elevated interacting fraction (\u03b1) at the RE due to the enhanced partitioning of EGFR in this compartment (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). This shows that the steady state distribution of EGFR as determined by the anterograde and retrograde rates of recycling dictates the effectiveness of spontaneous phosphorylation suppression."

In contrast, EGF stimulation leads to concomitant receptor depletion from the PM and its vesicular trafficking towards perinuclear endosomes (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). At early times after stimulation, a transient translocation of EGFR-mCitrine to the PM and a parallel loss at the RE can be observed (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B\u2013D</a>). This transient shift in the steady-state distribution of EGFR likely occurs because recycling from the RE to the PM continues after EGF stimulation, whereas endocytosis of ligand-bound receptors at the PM is delayed."

                                "text": "We investigated the cause of this ligand-induced switch in receptor trafficking and how this affects its phosphorylation response. EGF stimulation induces EGFR ubiquitination by the E3-ligase c-Cbl (<a href=\"#bib28\">Levkowitz et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Waterman et al., 2002</a>) and we therefore asked whether c-Cbl-mediated ubiquitination is the key signal to differentiate trafficking of autonomously from ligand-activated EGFR. Ectopically expressed c-Cbl-mCherry was rapidly recruited to the EGF/EGFR complexes at the PM and subsequently observed on internalized EGFR-positive endosomes (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). This ectopic expression strongly enhanced the rate of internalization after EGF stimulus (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>), which was concurrent with a diminished fraction of recycling EGF-EGFR (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). EGF-stimulation led to ubiquitination and degradation of liganded receptors (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), whereas PV-mediated spontaneously activated EGFR exhibited much lower ubiquitination, was not degraded and did not alter its cyclic trafficking (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E,F</a>). This shows that c-Cbl-mediated ubiquitination of EGFR causes a switch from recycling to unidirectional receptor trafficking toward the perinuclear cytoplasm. An EGFR mutant that is impaired in direct c-Cbl binding (EGFR-Y1045F-mCitrine) (<a href=\"#bib19\">Gr\u00f8vdal et al., 2004</a>) further corroborated this conclusion by continuing to recycle via the RE after ligand stimulation, thereby preventing its degradation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G,H</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3A\u2013C</a>). This constitutive recycling also resulted in an equally sustained phosphorylation in response to EGF, as compared to the adaptive phosphorylation response of wild type EGFR (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5I</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>). The same stabilizing features were additionally observed for an EGFR mutant (EGFR-Y1045F/Y1068F/Y1086F-mCitrine) that is impaired in both direct and indirect c-Cbl binding via Grb2 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5H,I</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3A\u2013C</a>). This shows that the EGF-mediated ubiquitin-switch in vesicular traffic that imposes a finite EGFR signal duration is mediated by c-Cbl binding to phosphorylated Y1045. However, PV-mediated spontaneous EGFR activation caused a similar or higher phosphorylation of Y1045 without c-Cbl recruitment (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), leading to inefficient receptor ubiquitination (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). This indicates that phosphorylation of Y1045 alone is not sufficient for EGFR ubiquitination by c-Cbl and that EGF-induced receptor association is an essential requirement. EGF-induced ubiquitination thus is a secondary signal that redirects EGFR toward perinuclear areas with high PTP1B activity to inactivate signaling of the liganded receptor (<a href=\"#fig5s4\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 4</a>) and further commit it for lysosomal degradation to avoid reactivation at the PM."

EGFR fluctuates between an inactive and an active conformation \u2013 denoted by star (1). The active conformation phosphorylates EGFR with the rate constant k<sub>autonom</sub> that encompasses the fraction of active conformation (2). Here, only phosphorylation of an autocatalytic tyrosine is considered. Phosphorylated EGFR is dephosphorylated (k<sub>PTP</sub>; 3) and can <i>auto</i>catalytically phosphorylate EGFR (k<sub>autocat</sub>; 4) similar to (2).

Dashed line in (<b>C</b>) is in the absence of phosphatase activity (phospho-EGFR rapidly approaches 100%). (<b>E-\u2013G</b>) Steady state phosphorylation of EGFR at the PM for the situations displayed in (<b>B<b>\u2013</b>D</b>) upon varying the total amount of EGFR per cell (expression level). Colors (green, red, black) correspond to the parameters in (<b>B\u2013D</b>). (<b>H</b>) 2D plots of EGFR phosphorylation (color code displayed on top) analogous to the last line plot in (<b>E</b>) for different expression levels of EGFR (x-axis) versus increasing phosphatase activity acting on the internal EGFR fraction (y-axis). Each image corresponds to a different steady state partitioning of EGFR towards the PM (10:1, 5:1, 3:1, 2:1, 1:1); lines in each image mark 50% EGFR phosphorylation (red color) for the corresponding steady state EGFR partitioning. (<b>I</b>) Simulation of EGF-induced activation of EGFR. In the absence of recycling (upper time traces), zeroth order phosphorylation rate of liganded EGFR locked in the active conformation results in a stable phosphorylation of all EGFR for low PTP activity (red curve) or an extremely rapid dephosphorylation for high PTP activity (black curve). Recycling in the presence of partitioned PTP activity (as in (<b>D</b>), k<sub>PTP</sub>=15 at the PM and k<sub>PTP</sub>=200 on endomembranes) results in 100% phosphorylation at the PM and low phosphorylation of EGFR on endomembranes. The total phosphorylation of EGFR in the cell (abscissa) is then determined by steady state EGFR partitioning (~50% for equipartitioning, red curve). Only degradation of the internal fraction with ongoing endocytosis allows finite signaling whose duration is determined by the kinetics of endocytosis (black curve). (<b>J</b>) Schematic of switch in EGFR vesicular traffic. Vesicular recycling (thick blue arrows) of EGFR monomers from the PM through the pericentriolar RE within areas of high PTP activity and back continuously suppresses autonomous receptor phosphorylation. Horizontal black arrows: Chemical conversions, vertical red arrows: Causalities (left). Following EGF-binding to the receptor, fully active and phosphorylated dimers share the same entry into early endosomes as the monomer. However, ligand-induced ubiquitination of EGFR clusters mediates a switch in the endocytic trafficking from continuous recycling to unidirectional trafficking. By depleting the pool of monomeric EGFR at the RE, this results in a transient translocation of the receptors to the PM reinforcing activation, and a subsequent depletion from the PM by delayed endocytosis. During endosomal transit from the PM to LEs, receptors signal in the cytoplasm until their dephosphorylation in perinuclear areas with high PTP activity (right) and subsequent degradation in lysosomes."

Since autocatalytic activity is a non-linear process that is strongly dependent on the density of EGFR at the PM, we also compared the phosphorylation of EGFR as a function of EGFR expression level in the three cases described above: no autocatalysis, no recycling, recycling, and partitioning of phosphatase activity (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E\u2013G</a>). Without autocatalytic phosphorylation, the second-order rate of autonomous phosphorylation causes a square-root dependence of phosphorylation on EGFR expression. For the moderate phosphatase activity of 15 that suppresses autonomous phosphorylation, this dependence is stretched out and it appears almost linear (black curve in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). However, this amount of phosphatase activity combined with autocatalytic phosphorylation gives rise to a low threshold (&lt; 0.1) in EGFR expression, beyond which phosphorylation increases sharply as a function of EGFR levels. This threshold increases with phosphatase activity (expression level of 2 for a phosphatase activity of 200, compare <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>). In the case of partitioned phosphatase activity, the dependence of EGFR phosphorylation on expression is similar to the scenario without recycling (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G</a>). This shows that the system of partitioning phosphatase activity and EGFR trafficking poses a valid alternative to a purely PM-based solution of keeping autocatalytic phosphorylation in check. The essential difference is that a partitioned phosphatase activity achieves this while maintaining a low phosphatase activity at the PM, where ligand-mediated activation of EGFR occurs."

We find that the autocatalytic threshold (black and white lines in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6H</a>) depends on this phosphatase partitioning, as well as on the EGFR distribution. Even if there is 10 times more EGFR on the PM, strongly asymmetric phosphatase partitioning hardly shifts the threshold. However, for more equal distributions of EGFR (&gt;2:1), a concurrent asymmetric phosphatase partitioning provides a large shift in the threshold. This corresponds to a safeguard against autocatalytic phosphorylation even at high EGFR expression. A low phosphatase activity at the PM suffices in combination with the suppressive recycling to maintain the level of EGFR phosphorylation below the autocatalytic threshold. For liganded EGFR, vesicular recycling leads to efficient dephosphorylation on perinuclear membranes with their high local phosphatase activity. However, the stabilization of the active EGFR conformation by the ligand causes its kinase activity to surpass suppression by low local phosphatase activity once liganded EGFR recycles to the PM (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6I</a>, lower graph, red curve). This is in stark contrast to unliganded dephosphorylated EGFR returning from the perinuclear area that requires slow autonomous phosphorylation as the trigger to return to the active state. The slow rate of recycling thus proves ineffective to maintain ligand-activated EGFR in a dephosphorylated state, while it can suppress autonomous phosphorylation (compare <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a> with <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6I</a>, lower graph). The system is therefore left with one way to shut down signaling after ligand stimulation: reducing the amount of EGF-EGFR complexes in the whole cell by lysosomal degradation to reset the kinase-phosphatase balance to a level below the autocatalytic threshold. The scheme in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6J</a> summarizes this switch from continuous suppressive EGFR recycling to directional trafficking leading to finite signaling"

It remains unclear how spontaneous auto-activation of EGFR is suppressed, while still maintaining responsiveness to physiological stimuli. Here, we show that a switch from cyclic to unidirectional vesicular traffic of EGFR enables its interaction with spatially organized PTPs to suppress spontaneous auto-activation while allowing for ligand-induced signal propagation. Otherwise, suppression of spontaneous autocatalytic activation at the PM would be incompatible with ligand-induced signaling of EGFR. Partitioning high PTP activity away from the PM allows these opposing requirements, because of two modes of spontaneous EGFR phosphorylation: 1) slow autonomous phosphorylation originating from a low fraction of EGFR that is in the active conformation due to thermal fluctuations; and 2) rapid autocatalytic phosphorylation due to phosphorylation of the autocatalytic site Y845. Low PTP activity at the PM is sufficient to suppress autonomous EGFR phosphorylation and can be overcome by ligand-activated EGFR. In contrast, the extremely fast kinetics of autocatalytic phosphorylation can only be suppressed by PTPs with high catalytic efficiency. This would hinder EGF-induced phosphorylation of EGFR at the PM and thereby prevent its signaling. This is the reason why shutdown of EGFR signaling occurs after its internalization by vesicular trafficking to the perinuclear area, where high PTP activity dephosphorylates the liganded receptor without interfering with EGF-responsiveness at the PM. This feature of the perinuclear area is also capitalized by monomeric, spontaneously phosphorylated EGFR through continuous vesicular trafficking into the same spatial location. The two different 'species' of phosphorylated EGFR \u2013 \u2014spontaneously and ligand-activated \u2013 \u2014are distinguished by their ubiquitination that depends on phosphorylation of tyrosine 1045 and self-association of EGFR. EGF-EGFR complexes travel in a unidirectional way to this perinuclear area due to their ubiquitination and will not leave it again, whereas spontaneously phosphorylated EGFR will recycle to the PM after dephosphorylation at the RE. Slow spontaneous autonomous receptor phosphorylation will then start again at the PM. However, before the threshold is reached, where rapid autocatalysis would accelerate phosphorylation of Y845, trafficking to the RE restarts the suppressive cycle. The primary function of EGFR recycling is therefore to suppress spontaneous phosphorylation of Y845 that leads to autocatalysis. This notion is consistent with our finding that \u2013 \u2014out of the three investigated tyrosines \u2013 \u2014phosphorylation of the autocatalytic Y845 site was the most efficiently suppressed by vesicular recycling of EGFR (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). This has implications for spontaneously versus EGF-activated EGFR- signaling. Since auto-activated EGFR is maintained at the PM, it can activate Akt via PIP3 production by PI3K at the PM (<a href=\"#bib6\">Cantley, 2002</a>), resulting in survival signaling. In contrast, we observed unresponsiveness of Erk to spontaneous auto-activation of EGFR. Possible reasons for this could be that negative feedback in the Erk circuitry (<a href=\"#bib14\">Fritsche-Guenther et al., 2011</a>) results in an adaptive response to sustained EGFR activity at the PM or that efficient activation of Erk only occurs upon endocytosis of the receptor. In general, our data show that interference with vesicular trafficking by knock down of Rab proteins can have substantial pleiotropic effects on growth factor receptor signaling activity."

                        "text": "We have shown here that the ER-associated PTP1B efficiently dephosphorylates the autocatalytic Y845. The highest intrinsic activity of PTP1B has been demonstrated to be on perinuclear membranes (<a href=\"#bib65\">Yudushkin et al., 2007</a>), whereas only a small fraction of its activity can reach the PM at points of cell\u2013cell contacts (<a href=\"#bib20\">Haj, 2002</a>). In addition to PTP1B, TCPTP is also spatially segregated from PM-localized EGFR by its association with the ER and has been shown to dephosphorylate Y845 (<a href=\"#bib30\">Mattila et al., 2005</a>). Thus, the localization of these ER-anchored PTPs with a high catalytic efficiency toward phosphorylated Y845 in the perinuclear area is compatible with the presented model of maintaining unliganded EGFR phosphorylation at the PM below the autocatalytic threshold. In this way, even a marginal PTP activity at the PM suffices to silence the signaling tyrosines. In this regard, several RPTPs (i.e. RPTPJ, G, A) that dephosphorylate EGFR at the PM (<a href=\"#bib41\">Rotin et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Tarcic et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Leung Cheung et al., 2015</a>) exhibit a high preference for the signaling tyrosines Y1068 and Y1086 (<a href=\"#bib26\">Leung Cheung et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Tarcic et al., 2009</a>). In addition, the catalytic efficiency of RPTPA for phosphorylated peptide substrates is three orders of magnitude lower than that of PTP1B or TC-PTP (<a href=\"#bib44\">Selner et al., 2014</a>). This agrees with our model where low PTP activity at the PM can only suppress slow autonomous phosphorylation in case that high perinuclear PTP activity suppresses autocatalytic activation. This is substantiated by the fact that inhibiting internalization of EGFR results in its prolonged activity at the PM (<a href=\"#bib32\">Offterdinger and Bastiaens, 2008</a>), whereas inhibition of EGFR kinase activity with an ATP-binding site competitor results in rapid dephosphorylation of signaling tyrosines (<a href=\"#bib33\">Offterdinger et al., 2004</a>). In the latter case, there is no autocatalytic maintenance of the kinase activity and the PM-resident PTP activity suffices to dephosphorylate EGFR on signaling tyrosines."

During vesicular transit of EGF-EGFR complexes to perinuclear areas with the highest PTP1B activity (<a href=\"#bib65\">Yudushkin et al., 2007</a>), growth factor signals are propagated in the cytoplasm (<a href=\"#bib22\">Lai, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Di Guglielmo et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Wouters and Bastiaens, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Sorkina et al., 1999</a>), indicating a link between vesicular trafficking and duration of EGFR signaling response. Such a response typically occurs on the tens-of-minutes time-scale, corresponding to characteristic vesicular trafficking rates. This time-scale of EGFR response cannot be achieved by cytosolic, regulated PTPs (i.e. SHP1/2) that couple to EGFR phosphorylation in a negative feedback manner (<a href=\"#bib18\">Grecco et al., 2011</a>). The recruitment of these diffusible PTPs to the receptor on the time scale of seconds would dephosphorylate EGFR too rapidly to signal on a time scale of minutes. By the same argument, suppression of spontaneous autocatalytic activation at the PM by regulated PTPs is incompatible with prolonged EGFR signaling."

This suggests that sorting of monomeric EGFR to the RE and self-associated, ubiquitinated EGFR to the LE happens at the early endosomal compartment. Why is it necessary to re-route ligand-activated receptors by endosomal sorting away from the unliganded EGFR that keeps recycling? The answer to this question lies in the stability of the ligand-receptor complexes. Liganded EGFR maintains an active conformation even after dephosphorylation in the perinuclear area, and therefore will be rapidly re-phosphorylated in the environment of low PTP activity at the PM. This would sustain signaling as it has been observed for the c-Cbl-binding-impaired mutants, which continued recycling upon EGF stimulation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B\u2013D</a>). Importantly, this reactivation does not occur for spontaneously activated EGFR because dephosphorylation of Y845 inactivates the conformation that results in rapid autocatalytic phosphorylation. The protective recycling can be exploited by oncogenic versions of EGFR (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chung et al., 2009</a>) that show impaired c-Cbl association (<a href=\"#bib46\">Shtiegman et al., 2007</a>), or c-Cbl mutations that abolish interaction with EGFR, or within cells with altered c-Cbl activity, all leading to insufficient EGFR ubiquitination, subsequent recycling and sustained downstream signaling (<a href=\"#bib54\">Thien and Langdon, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Peschard and Park, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Ravid et al., 2004</a>). Recycling also occurs at low doses of EGF stimulation (<a href=\"#bib49\">Sigismund et al., 2005</a>), where some receptors might autocatalytically activate but fail to be ubiquitinated due to lack of stable EGF-induced self-association. However, as shown in this study, c-Cbl is a limiting factor in rerouting EGF-EGFR complexes to lysosomes under saturating doses of EGF. Therefore, the level of c-Cbl expression in different cells might dictate the fraction of EGF-EGFR complexes that keep recycling."

At the end of the experiment an image of BFP-Rab11a was acquired with 5% 405-laser power. Following background correction, fluorescence loss after photoactivation at the RE was quantified as the ratio of local EGFR-paGFP to EGFR-mCherry fluorescence, to account for changes in the structure and intensity in the ROI. Fluorescence gain on the PM was quantified as the ratio of local (cell periphery) EGFR-paGFP to EGFR-mCherry fluorescence. Analogously to the FRAP experiment, exponential decay at the RE and increase at the PM were fitted to a mono-exponential function (<a href=\"#equ2\">Equation 2</a>).

The CellR software supplied by the microscope manufacturer (Olympus, Hamburg, Germany) controlled data acquisition. Computed anisotropy images were displayed with false color-coding using ImageJ. For analysing the co-localization between EGFR-QG-mCitrine and PTB-mCherry the acquired fluorescence images were background subtracted and masks for individual cells were generated using ImageJ. PTB-mCherry fluorescence intensity was saturated in the nucleus and therefore excluded from the masks of individual cells. The extent of PTB recruitment (R) to EGFR was calculated by the following equation:"

Autophosphorylation of EGFR favors Y845 rather than Y1045 and Y1068 docking sites; autophosphorylated EGFR appears to be monomeric by anisotropy; non-liganded EGFR cycles via Rab11 endosomes unless it engages Cbl and then is sent to lysosomes due to ubiquitylation; perinuclear protein tyrosine phosphatase dephosphorylated recycling endosome-localized EGFR. Expression of BFP-Rab11A may have decreased phospho-EGFR levels but it is not clear how significant these data are (is the difference driven by outliers?). To this non-EGFR expert, the data don't seem to bring forth a totally novel story except perhaps the different status of auto- and ligand-activated EGFRs. Without live cell microscopy, the authors can't make any conclusions about one EGFR class going directly to REs versus sorting in a common EE to ship cbl-engaged EGFRs to late endosomes and non-cbl engaged EGFRs to REs. The authors really need to highlight what is absolutely new in their analysis \u2013 the methods employed are sophisticated and provide interesting substance \u2013 even if they may not be totally ground breaking and may simply confirm previous conclusions obtained with less precise methods."

Ligand-free phosphorylated EGFR is targeted to perinuclear recycling endosomes RE where high concentration of ER-bound phosphatase PTP1B ensures inactivation of the autonomously phosphorylated EGFR (spontaneous EGFR signalling). In contrast, the ligand-receptor complexes are targeted to degradation. It was previously demonstrated that targeting to degradation is triggered by ubiquitination of EGFR by c-Cbl. The authors demonstrate that c-Cbl is not recruited on activated Y1045 monomeric EGFR and, as such, activation on Y1045 is not sufficient to reroute EGFR to degradation. The spatial (non-homogeneous) distribution of PTP1B provides the explanation for the necessity of trafficking as a means to regulated EGFR phosphorylation. The study is very interesting. It shows that EGFR and ligand-occupied EGFR have very different trafficking fates, thus providing new insight into the regulation of EGFR trafficking in the cell that combines high sensitivity with robustness against \"spurious\" signaling."

This shift in the steady-state distribution of EGFR occurs because recycling from the RE to the PM continues after EGF stimulation whereas vesicular trafficking to the RE is shut down.\" The authors imply that EGF stimulation transiently suppresses the \"basal uptake\" of EGFR. What is the evidence for this? The rerouting of this fraction of EGFR to degradation should lead to depletion of EGFR from RE, but I do not see how it should lead to a significant redistribution of EGFR toward the PM. Figure 4C, F provide quantitative evidence for depletion of EGFR from RE. However, the redistribution to PM is supported by one low-resolution image (see Figure 4A, 1 min vs. 0 min) of one cell without quantifications. The authors need to provide proper quantifications and statistics."

This is opposite to what is claimed here. The authors should clarify or amend this statement. See comment above."

This suggests that autonomously activated EGFR directly traffics in clathrin coated vesicles from the PM to the RE (Vieira, Lamaze, and Schmid 1996).\" This is an interesting and strong statement that needs to be well supported. I cannot judge the level of colocalization of EGFR to Rab5 from the images of Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1. The authors state that there is no colocalization of EGFR to Rab5 in the absence of EGF stimulation. However from Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1 one cannot draw this conclusion simply by qualitative observations. The magnification is too low, split colors presented as negatives, etc. The statement that internalized unoccupied EGFR is directly targeted to RE and bypass Rab5-positive EE has to be much better supported. I did not find the statement on direct traffic of clathrin coated vesicles to perinuclear RE in the referenced paper of Vieira, Lamaze, and Schmid 1996. Do the authors really mean that PM-derived vesicles (clathrin-dependent or clathrin-independent?) fuse directly with RE? This is not an established mechanism and the authors need to provide more convincing evidence or drop this statement."

The model proposed by the authors is in agreement with the current model of EGFR endocytic trafficking whereby in the absence of the ligand EGFR is constitutively internalized and recycled, whereas ligand activation of the receptor leads to ubiquitination and increased targeting of EGFR to the lysosomal degradation pathway. The authors further advance this model by proposing that constitutive endocytosis of ligand-free EGFR to Rab11 recycling compartment serves to counteract to the autocatalytic phosphorylation of EGFR in order to maintain low levels of the receptor activity. In essence, it is suggested that the tyrosine kinase of free, monomeric EGFR can be autonomously activated leading to receptor phosphorylation; however, endocytosis delivers free EGFR to the perinuclear area of the cell where an ER-associated phosphotyrosine phosphatase PTB-1B dephosphorylates the receptor prior to its recycling back to the cell surface. This new aspect of the EGFR endocytosis system is interesting but the supporting evidence is not sufficiently convincing."

Ligand-free phosphorylated EGFR is targeted to perinuclear recycling endosomes RE where high concentration of ER-bound phosphatase PTP1B ensures inactivation of the autonomously phosphorylated EGFR (spontaneous EGFR signalling). In contrast, the ligand-receptor complexes are targeted to degradation. It was previously demonstrated that targeting to degradation is triggered by ubiquitination of EGFR by c-Cbl. The authors demonstrate that c-Cbl is not recruited on activated Y1045 monomeric EGFR and, as such, activation on Y1045 is not sufficient to reroute EGFR to degradation. The spatial (non-homogeneous) distribution of PTP1B provides the explanation for the necessity of trafficking as a means to regulated EGFR phosphorylation. The study is very interesting. It shows that EGFR and ligand-occupied EGFR have very different trafficking fates, thus providing new insight into the regulation of EGFR trafficking in the cell that combines high sensitivity with robustness against \"spurious\" signaling. As the manuscript is written, it gives the impression of a clear cut distribution of phosphatases between the plasma membrane and RE.

We have now incorporated our experimental findings into a mathematical model (Figure 6) that clearly defines the role of partitioning PTP activities in regulating EGFR autocatalytic phosphorylation. In short, low RPTP activity at the PM suffices to suppress autonomous phosphorylation of signaling tyrosines only because high PTP1B activity in the perinuclear area counters spontaneous autocatalysis by dephosphorylating tyrosine 845. We have now added a part in the Discussion to describe the different roles of plasma membrane localized RPTPs versus ER-associated PTPs that is fully consistent with our findings.

The model proposed by the authors is in agreement with the current model of EGFR endocytic trafficking whereby in the absence of the ligand EGFR is constitutively internalized and recycled, whereas ligand activation of the receptor leads to ubiquitination and increased targeting of EGFR to the lysosomal degradation pathway. The authors further advance this model by proposing that constitutive endocytosis of ligand-free EGFR to Rab11 recycling compartment serves to counteract to the autocatalytic phosphorylation of EGFR in order to maintain low levels of the receptor activity. In essence, it is suggested that the tyrosine kinase of free, monomeric EGFR can be autonomously activated leading to receptor phosphorylation; however, endocytosis delivers free EGFR to the perinuclear area of the cell where an ER-associated phosphotyrosine phosphatase PTB-1B dephosphorylates the receptor prior to its recycling back to the cell surface. This new aspect of the EGFR endocytosis system is interesting but the supporting evidence is not sufficiently convincing.</i> "

Another non-intuitive aspect is that the spontaneous phosphorylation is a two-step process with slow kinetics determined by the thermal fluctuations in kinase conformation (\u201cleaky kinase\u201d) and rapid self-amplifying phosphorylation. If the amount of autonomously phosphorylated EGFR is high enough, autocatalytic phosphorylation takes over and greatly enhances phosphorylation kinetics. While the leaky kinase activity can be suppressed by PM-localized low PTP activity, the high PTP activity required to shut-down autocatalytic phosphorylation would also suppresses phosphorylation of EGF-stimulated EGFR at the PM. The solution of the system is to recycle EGFR to the perinuclear region with high PTP activity that also causes signal shut-down of internalized EGF-EGFR complexes. We now better describe that once the autocatalytic tyrosine is dephosphorylated, only slow kinase activity will rephosphorylate the receptor, which can be countered by low local RPTP activity. When the threshold for autocatalytic activation is passed, the system will rapidly phosphorylate and needs to be reset by dephosphorylation of Y845 by the high activity of perinuclear PTP1B."

This was substantiated here by showing that the interaction of EGFR with the trapping variant PTP1B-D181A mostly occurs in the perinuclear area within which the RE is contained (new Figure 5E). An important point is that EGFR on its way to the RE is exposed to the dephosphorylating PTP activity: only few of the PTP1B molecules happen to be in close proximity to the PM as compared to the bulk of PTP1B distributed over the ER.

There is still a debate in the literature about the existence of less stable unoccupied EGFR dimers. The FRET based assay used in the present study may not be sufficiently sensitive to formally disprove the existence of these dimers. In fact, the strong dependence of the receptor phosphorylation on its expression levels (Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1) suggests that it this autonomous phosphorylation correlates with the increased probability of monomer-monomer interaction.</i> "

This means that the fraction of interacting EGFR is very low at steady state. We are certain that our homo-FRET assay is sufficiently sensitive, because we measure a distinct drop in anisotropy upon EGF-stimulation (Figure 2A), in contrast to PV- mediated, autocatalytically fully phosphorylated EGFR (Figure 2C). This clearly shows that the autocatalytically phosphorylated EGFR is mostly monomeric."
