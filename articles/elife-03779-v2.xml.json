In yeast, signaling mediated by TOR Complex 2 (TORC2)-dependent protein kinase Ypk1 controls lipid abundance and distribution in response to membrane stress. Ypk1, among other actions, alleviates negative regulation of L-serine:palmitoyl-CoA acyltransferase, upregulating production of long-chain base precursors to sphingolipids. To explore other roles for TORC2-Ypk1 signaling in membrane homeostasis, we devised a three-tiered genome-wide screen to identify additional Ypk1 substrates, which pinpointed both catalytic subunits of the ceramide synthase complex. Ypk1-dependent phosphorylation of both proteins increased upon either sphingolipid depletion or heat shock and was important for cell survival. Sphingolipidomics, other biochemical measurements and genetic analysis demonstrated that these modifications of ceramide synthase increased its specific activity and stimulated channeling of long-chain base precursors into sphingolipid end-products. Control at this branch point also prevents accumulation of intermediates that could compromise cell growth by stimulating autophagy."

In yeast, signaling mediated by TOR Complex 2 (TORC2)-dependent protein kinase Ypk1 controls lipid abundance and distribution in response to membrane stress. Ypk1, among other actions, alleviates negative regulation of L-serine:palmitoyl-CoA acyltransferase, upregulating production of long-chain base precursors to sphingolipids. To explore other roles for TORC2-Ypk1 signaling in membrane homeostasis, we devised a three-tiered genome-wide screen to identify additional Ypk1 substrates, which pinpointed both catalytic subunits of the ceramide synthase complex. Ypk1-dependent phosphorylation of both proteins increased upon either sphingolipid depletion or heat shock and was important for cell survival. Sphingolipidomics, other biochemical measurements and genetic analysis demonstrated that these modifications of ceramide synthase increased its specific activity and stimulated channeling of long-chain base precursors into sphingolipid end-products. Control at this branch point also prevents accumulation of intermediates that could compromise cell growth by stimulating autophagy."

Ypk1 (and Ypk2) are two members of the AGC kinase family (<a href=\"#bib78\">Pearce et al., 2010</a>) and orthologs of mammalian SGK1 (<a href=\"#bib18\">Casamayor et al., 1999</a>). In <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, Ypk1 (and Ypk2) are activated at a basal level by phosphorylation of a Thr in the activation loop by the eisosome-associated protein kinase Pkh1 (and its paralog Pkh2) (<a href=\"#bib18\">Casamayor et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Roelants et al., 2002</a>). The ortholog responsible for this reaction in mammalian cells is PDK1 (<a href=\"#bib68\">Mora et al., 2004</a>).

Under such conditions of membrane stress, TORC2 stimulates Ypk1 and Ypk2 function by phosphorylating at least two C-terminal sites (<a href=\"#bib42\">Kamada et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Roelants et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Niles et al., 2012</a>).

It has been reported that membrane stress caused by inhibition of sphingolipid synthesis or membrane stretch (induced by hypotonic shock) causes two PH domain-containing proteins (Slm1 and Slm2) to relocalize from eisosomes to a separate PM region that contains TORC2 and leads to increased TORC2 activation of Ypk1 and Ypk2 (<a href=\"#bib10\">Berchtold et al., 2012</a>), purportedly because Slm1 and Slm2 recruit Ypk1 and Ypk2 to TORC2 (<a href=\"#bib73\">Niles et al., 2012</a>). However, other evidence indicates that Avo1 (ortholog in other organisms is Sin1) is the subunit of the TORC2 complex primarily responsible for substrate recognition of Ypk1 and its orthologs, including association of <i>S. cerevisiae</i> Ypk2 with Avo1 (<a href=\"#bib53\">Liao and Chen, 2012</a>), Gad8 with Sin1 in fission yeast (<a href=\"#bib37\">Ikeda et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Kataoka et al., 2014</a>), and SGK1 with mSin1 in mammalian cells (<a href=\"#bib38\">Jacinto et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib106\">Yang et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Lu et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Liu et al., 2013</a>).

Ypk1 phosphorylates and negatively regulates Fpk1, a protein kinase responsible for activation of PM-localized aminophospholipid flippases (<a href=\"#bib81\">Roelants et al., 2010</a>), thereby fine-tuning the phosphatidylethanolamine content of the inner leaflet of the PM bilayer. Ypk1 also phosphorylates and alleviates the inhibitory function of two endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-localized proteins (Orm1 and Orm2) that impede the function of the first enzyme unique to sphingolipid biosynthesis, L-serine:palmitoyl-CoA acyltransferase (SPT) (<a href=\"#bib82\">Roelants et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Berchtold et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib99\">Sun et al., 2012</a>), thereby increasing the rate of formation of the long-chain base precursor (phytosphingosine) to yeast sphingolipids. Ypk1 also phosphorylates and inhibits one of the two isoforms (Gpd1) of glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, a primary source of glycerol-3P for production of glycerophospholipids (<a href=\"#bib52\">Lee et al., 2012b</a>). In response to hyperosmotic shock, and in contrast to other PM stressors, TORC2 activity is markedly decreased, preventing Ypk1-mediated inhibition of Gpd1 [which also gets upregulated transcriptionally (<a href=\"#bib3\">Ansell et al., 1997</a>)], thereby greatly increasing synthesis of glycerol-3P, which is dephosphorylated to produce glycerol, an innocuous osmolyte that yeast cells accumulate as a means to counteract the increase in external osmotic pressure (<a href=\"#bib52\">Lee et al., 2012b</a>). Control of all these reactions already made it clear that TORC2-Ypk1 signaling is a central regulator of PM lipid homeostasis."

Although we report here the general outcomes of this screen, we focus mainly on our discovery and demonstration that both of the catalytic subunits of the ER-localized ceramide synthase complex (<a href=\"#bib89\">Schorling et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib103\">Vall\u00e9e and Riezman, 2005</a>) are <i>bona fide</i> targets of Ypk1. These findings provide new insight into how TORC2-initiated signaling regulates flux through the sphingolipid pathway and how this specific control mechanism is important for survival when sphingolipid synthesis is compromised.

Numbers indicate the number of hits/considered genes at each step in the screen. (<b>B</b>) The bioinformatic approach towards identifying Ypk1 substrates is schematized as a flowchart with each filter as a box. Genes were first filtered by MOTIPS on the basis of having likely phosphorylatable Ypk1 motifs. Subsequently, substrates were filtered by having many Ypk1 motifs or having a Ypk1 site known to be phosphorylated in published data sets. Lastly, genes were filtered by requiring the gene to have a published chemical sensitivity like Ypk1 does, or a published interaction with Ypk1, Ypk1 regulators (TORC2 or PP2A) or sphingolipid biosynthetic machinery. (<b>C</b>) A possible explanation for Ypk1 synthetic dosage lethality interactions is shown. Normally, the cell has enough kinase activity to buffer overexpression of a substrate (Substrate 2), so that essential substrates are regulated and normal growth is unperturbed. However, concurrent decrease in kinase activity coupled with substrate overexpression causes loss of regulation of essential substrate(s) (Substrate 1) leading to observable growth defects.

All demonstrated substrates either in vivo or in vitro contain Arg at positions \u22125 and \u22123 with respect to the phosphorylated Ser (or Thr); thus, these positions were invariant in the search motif. Given that nearly all the verified sites within known in vivo targets possess a hydrophobic residue (V, I, F) at position +1, the search motif gave preference to sites with a hydrophobic residue at the +1 position. We then took advantage of the existing MOTIPS motif analysis package (<a href=\"#bib49\">Lam et al., 2010</a>) to identify those <i>S. cerevisiae</i> gene products that contain occurrences of the search logo. Several authentic Ypk1 substrates (<i>e.g.,</i> Fpk1, Orm1, and Orm2) contain multiple Ypk1 phosphorylation sites. Thus, we filtered our search further by prioritizing candidates containing multiple matches to the search logo, as predicted by MOTIPS. However, to avoid disregarding potential Ypk1 substrates with a single predicted match to the sequence logo, we also considered MOTIPS hits wherein there was existing evidence in the PhosphoGRID database (<a href=\"#bib88\">Sadowski et al., 2013</a>) indicating that a predicted site is phosphorylated in vivo. To narrow down the list of potential substrates further, we chose to pursue those gene products containing matches to the sequence logo for which there was existing information in the literature suggesting a phenotypic relationship to known Ypk1-dependent processes: (a) a loss-of-function mutation in the candidate gene exhibits elevated sensitivity to agents (aureobasidin A, caspofungin, and/or myriocin) toward which a <i>ypk1\u0394</i> mutant is also sensitive (<a href=\"#bib33\">Hillenmeyer et al., 2008</a>); (b) the candidate gene product is reported to be involved in a genetic or biochemical interaction with Ypk1, as curated in YeastMine (<a href=\"#bib5\">Balakrishnan et al., 2012</a>); (c) the candidate gene product is connected in some way to known Ypk1 regulators (<i>e.g.</i>, TORC2, PP2A); and/or, (d) the candidate gene product is involved in a known Ypk1-regulated process (<i>e.g.</i>, sphingolipid metabolism) (for further details, see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). Reassuringly, our approach identified three known Ypk1 substrates (Fpk1, Orm1 and Orm2); absence of Fpk2 and Gpd1 from the list generated solely by the MOTIPS search criteria arose from the fact that these substrates contain only a single predicted site that is not presently recorded in PhosphoGRID. For this reason, we also restored for consideration additional gene products that contain a single match to the consensus sequence logo that YeastMine indicated are involved in processes in which Ypk1 is implicated. The resulting candidates, grouped via cellular process on the basis of current GO Slim terminology (<a href=\"http://www.geneontology.org/GO.slims.shtml\">http://www.geneontology.org/GO.slims.shtml</a>), are cataloged in <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>, and represent fewer than 100 gene products out of the approximately 6000 protein-coding genes in the yeast genome (<a href=\"#bib55\">Lin et al., 2013</a>) [although the number of authentic open-reading-frames undergoes constant revision (<a href=\"http://www.yeastgenome.org/cache/genomeSnapshot.html\">http://www.yeastgenome.org/cache/genomeSnapshot.html</a>)]."

These toxic genes were then tested for Ypk1 dosage rescue (for details, see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019); here, (+) indicates that Ypk1 overexpression could at least partially rescue the overexpression toxicity of the indicated gene and (\u2212) indicates that Ypk1 overexpression could not rescue the overexpression toxicity. Lastly, the results of testing the indicated purified predicted Ypk1 target as a substrtate in the in vitro protein kinase assay with purified Ypk1-as; here, (+) indicates that Ypk1-as- dependent (3-MB-PP1 inhibitable) incorporation was detectable for the substrate at a level comparable to incorporation into the positive control [the known Ypk1 substrate, GST-Orm1(1\u201385)]; (+/\u2212) indicates that readily detectable Ypk1-as-dependent incorporation was found, but at a level lower than that seen for an equivalent amount of GST-Orm1(1\u201385) protein.

We reasoned that under conditions where the level of activity of an essential kinase, like Ypk1, is near-limiting for normal growth, high-level over-expression of an authentic substrate might tie up the available pool of active enzyme and prevent efficient phosphorylation of other cellular substrates necessary for growth and/or viability (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). This scheme is a novel variation on a genetic approach referred to as synthetic dosage lethality (SDL) (<a href=\"#bib96\">Sopko et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib90\">Sharifpoor et al., 2012</a>). To limit Ypk1 activity, we used <i>ypk1-as ypk2\u0394</i> cells, which express from the <i>YPK1</i> locus an analog-sensitive allele, Ypk1(L424A) (<a href=\"#bib82\">Roelants et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Niles et al., 2012</a>), and titrated down its activity by addition of a low concentration of an efficacious inhibitor,1-(<i>tert</i>-butyl)-3-(3-methylbenzyl)-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidin-4-amine (3-MB-PP1) (<a href=\"#bib15\">Burkard et al., 2007</a>) that has no effect on wild-type cells (see <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). To achieve high-level over-expression, each bioinformatic hit was expressed from the galactose-inducible <i>GAL1</i> promoter on a <i>CEN</i> plasmid. As proof of concept, we used two known Ypk1 substrates, Orm1 and Orm2, as positive controls and GFP, which is not a Ypk1 substrate (data not shown), as a negative control. In the absence of limiting the activity of Ypk1(L424A) with inhibitor, overexpression of neither Orm proteins nor GFP was deleterious to cell growth (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, <i>left panels, compare lower to upper</i>). However, in the presence of a low dose of 3-MB-PP1, overexpression of Orm1 and Orm2 on galactose medium prevented cell growth, whereas overexpression of GFP did not (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, <i>middle and right panels, compare lower to upper</i>). We were able to test the majority of the candidates (90/96) that arose in the bioinformatic search in this same fashion [however, 10/90 caused toxicity upon over-expression even in wild-type cells and, hence, could not be scored]."

Moreover, use of a series of 3-MB-PP1 concentrations allowed for quantification of the strength of the SDL effect (from + to ++++). In one case (Fps1), a marked SDL effect was observed upon overexpression in the <i>ypk1-as ypk2\u0394</i> cells in the absence of chemical inhibition; we considered this a valid SDL hit because <i>GAL</i> promoter-driven over-expression of Fps1 was not growth inhibitory in wild-type (<i>YPK1</i><sup><i>+</i></sup> <i>YPK2</i><sup><i>+</i></sup>) cells. Thus, as summarized in <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a> (<i>column 4</i>), a significant fraction (20/90) of the candidates identified bioinformatically that were tested in this fashion, but far from all, displayed an SDL phenotype. In this regard, it is important to note that all known Ypk1 substrates tested (Gpd1, Fpk1, Orm1 and Orm2) displayed an SDL phenotype, whereas nearly 80% of the bioinformatic hits, like GFP, did not. Consistent with the view that the SDL phenotype could arise from the over-expressed target serving as a decoy substrate that titers a limited pool of active Ypk1 away from acting on its essential substrates, we observed that over-expressed catalytically-inactive Fpk1 caused an SDL phenotype equivalent to or stronger than wild-type Fpk1 (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). If such SDL phenotypes reflect occlusion of a limited pool of enzyme by over-expressed substrate, then, conversely, co-overexpression of Ypk1 or even of a kinase-dead allele Ypk1(K376A) (driven from the <i>MET25</i> promoter) might rescue the toxicity. Indeed, the deleterious effect of Smp1 over-expression was rescued by co-overexpression of either Ypk1 or Ypk1(K376A) (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>), suggesting that the SDL phenotype of over-expressed Smp1 also arises from titration of a limited amount of Ypk1 away from essential substrates."

We chose to use the analog-sensitive allele, even though it is only about 50% as active as wild-type Ypk1 (<a href=\"#bib82\">Roelants et al., 2011</a>), because ablation of activity in the presence of 3-MB-PP1 allowed us to confirm that any <sup>32</sup>P incorporation into substrate observed was due to phosphorylation by Ypk1(L424A) itself (and not due to some other protein kinase that might be present in the preparation). All known in vivo substrates of Ypk1 (Fpk1, Fpk2, Gpd1, Orm1 and Orm2) display robust incorporation (as judged by autoradiography) in this in vitro assay (<a href=\"#bib81\">Roelants et al., 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib82\">2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Lee et al., 2012b</a>). Therefore, in testing each candidate, an appropriate positive control, Orm1(1\u201385) was included (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>), which also allowed comparison between independent assays. Gratifyingly, 12/17 (70%) of the SDL hits tested in this manner displayed readily detectable and Ypk1-specific phosphorylation (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>, <i>right column</i>). Moreover, the results of such assays clearly demonstrated that Ypk1 is not a \u2018promiscuous\u2019 enzyme.

Genetically, Lac1 and Lag1 appear to play overlapping functional roles; <i>lac1\u0394</i> or <i>lag1\u0394</i> single mutants are viable, whereas a <i>lac1\u0394 lag1\u0394</i> double mutant is reportedly either inviable (<a href=\"#bib40\">Jiang et al., 1998</a>) or extremely slow growing (<a href=\"#bib7\">Barz and Walter, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib89\">Schorling et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib103\">Vall\u00e9e and Riezman, 2005</a>). The ceramide synthase reaction lies at an important branch point in the sphingolipid metabolic network (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>) because de novo synthesis of ceramides both consumes LCBs and prevents conversion of LCBs to their 1-phosphorylated derivatives (LCBPs). Thus, the rate of ceramide synthesis is tightly coupled to the levels of both LCBs and LCBPs (<a href=\"#bib48\">Kobayashi and Nagiec, 2003</a>); and, moreover, the balance between ceramides and total LCBs and LCBPs affects growth rate in both fungi (<a href=\"#bib48\">Kobayashi and Nagiec, 2003</a>) and mammalian cells (<a href=\"#bib97\">Spiegel and Milstien, 2003</a>).

Cultures of the resulting cells were grown in the absence or presence of a sub-lethal dose of myriocin, a condition which several previous studies have shown activates TORC2- and Ypk1-mediated signaling (<a href=\"#bib82\">Roelants et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Berchtold et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib99\">Sun et al., 2012</a>), and the resulting extracts were analyzed on Phos-tag gels. As observed previously for two other <i>bona fide</i> substrates, Orm1 and Orm2 (<a href=\"#bib82\">Roelants et al., 2011</a>), absence of Ypk1 totally abrogated the appearance of phosphorylated Lac1 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>) and phosphorylated Lag1 (data not shown), whereas elimination of Ypk2 had no effect. Thus, Ypk1 is the paralog solely responsible for the observed in vivo phosphorylation of Lac1 and Lag1 at Ser23 and Ser24. Furthermore, under conditions that stimulate TORC2 activity, nearly all of the Lac1 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>) and much more of the Lag1 (data not shown) were converted to the phosphorylated isoform indicating that TORC2 activation is relayed to ceramide synthase via Ypk1. To further confirm that TORC2 function is essential for Ypk1-mediated phosphorylation of ceramide synthase, Lac1 phosphorylation was monitored in <i>TOR2</i> cells and in a <i>tor2-as</i> mutant after addition of a specific <i>tor2-as</i> inhibitor, BEZ-235 (<a href=\"#bib47\">Kliegman et al., 2013</a>). TORC2 inhibition markedly reduced Lac1 phosphorylation within 20 min in <i>tor2-as</i> cells, but not in the otherwise isogenic control cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>), confirming that TORC2 activity is necessary for Ypk1-mediated ceramide synthase phosphorylation. Thus, our screening approach was successful in revealing two, previously uncharacterized, cellular targets of the TORC2-Ypk1 signaling axis."

To test this prediction, we integrated as the sole source of ceramide synthase, mutant versions of Lac1 and Lag1 in which Ser23 and Ser24 were mutated to Ala and, hence, cannot be phosphorylated under any circumstances. As a control, we also generated integrated versions of Lac1 and Lag1 in which Ser23 and Ser24 were mutated to Glu, to mimic conversion of the entire population to the phosphorylated state, a response that we showed can be achieved for the wild-type protein (see, for example, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Indeed, we found that the cells co-expressing Lac1(S23A S24A) and Lag1(23A S24A) grew detectably less well when challenged with either myriocin or aureobasidin A than either otherwise isogenic wild-type cells or cells co-expressing Lac1(S23E S24E) and Lag1(S23E S24E) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). These growth differences could not be attributed to differences in the level of expression of these proteins, as immunoblot analysis demonstrated the wild-type and mutant ceramide synthase subunits were present in equivalent amounts under the conditions tested (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Thus, Ypk1-dependent phosphorylation of these sites in Lac1 and Lag1 is functionally important for cell survival in response to the stress of limiting sphingolipid biosynthesis.

To rule out the former possibility, we examined Lac1 and Lag1 phosphorylation in cells expressing constitutively-active Ypk1(D242A), which we have demonstrated bypasses the need for its TORC2-dependent activation (<a href=\"#bib82\">Roelants et al., 2011</a>). We found that Ca<sup>2+</sup> addition still led to nearly complete Lac1 and Lag1 dephosphorylation in these cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Furthermore, as judged by immunoblotting with a phospho-site specific antibody, Pkh1- and Pkh2-dependent phosphorylation of the activation loop in Ypk1 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>) was not diminished in cells stimulated with Ca<sup>2+</sup>, confirming that there was no calcineurin-mediated decrease in the amount of active Ypk1 present.

Immunoblotting of exponentially-growing cultures expressing the 3xHA-tagged versions of wild-type Lac1 and Lag1 and the Lac1(S23A S24A) Lag1(S23A S24A) and Lac1(S23E S24E) Lag1(S23E S24E) indicated no discernible difference in their steady-state level (see <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Likewise, in cells co-expressing the same proteins and FLAG-tagged Lip1 (gift of Howard Riezman, Univ. of Geneva), we observed no difference in the efficiency of Lip1 co-immunoprecipitation between wild-type Lac1 and Lag1 and either the Lac1(S23A S24A) Lag1(S23A S24A) or Lac1(S23E S24E) Lag1(S23E S24E) mutants (data not shown). These results suggested that Ypk1-mediated phosphorylation may directly enhance the catalytic efficiency of Lac1 and Lag1. To test this possibility directly, 3xFLAG-tagged versions of Lac1 and Lag1 were immunopurified from detergent-solubilized microsomes isolated from exponentially-growing cells and equivalent amounts of the resulting protein assayed in vitro, monitoring the formation of ceramide from PHS and steroyl-CoA by LC-MS. No product was observed in the absence of added steroyl-CoA (data not shown), and product formation was reduced by 85% in the presence of PHS and steroyl-CoA if 1 \u03bcM australifungin, a demonstrated and specific ceramide synthase inhibitor (<a href=\"#bib63a\">Mandala and Harris, 2000</a>), was added (data not shown), confirming that the reaction measured was catalyzed by ceramide synthase. We found that the specific activity of the Lac1(S23E S24E) Lag1(S23E S24E) complex was reproducibly \u223c2 higher than either the Lac1(S23A S24A) Lag1(S23A S24A) mutant or the wild-type complex (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>, <i>upper panel</i>), similar to the degree of difference in sphingolipid metabolites between these same strains that we measured by other means (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>). In two independent trials (each performed in triplicate), the identical trend was found when microsomes from these same cells were assayed directly (i.e. without detergent solubilization and enzyme enrichment by immunoprecipitation [data not shown]). Additionally, we found that immunopurified ceramide synthase from wild-type cultures treated with myriocin had higher activity than ceramide synthase prepared from untreated cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>, <i>lower panel</i>). Furthermore, this increase in ceramide synthase activity in response to myriocin treatment was not observed in Lac1(S23A S24A) Lag1(S23A S24A) cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>, <i>lower panel</i>), consistent with TORC2-Ypk1 signaling increasing ceramide synthase activity by phosphorylation at these residues. These findings are also in agreement with a reported \u223ctwo-fold decrease in the rate of ceramide production by ceramide synthase complex isolated from TORC2-deficient yeast (<a href=\"#bib4\">Aronova et al., 2008</a>). Hence, we conclude that Ypk1 phosphorylation directly increases the catalytic activity of ceramide synthase."

Indeed, compared to the empty vector control, expression of Ypk1* was well tolerated by cells containing wild-type Lac1 and Lag1, but deleterious to the growth of the Lac1(S23A S24A) Lag1(S23A S24A) mutant cells, whether measured on agar plates (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>, <i>top</i>) or in liquid culture (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>, <i>bottom</i>)."

Consistent with this conclusion, we found a reproducible and statistically significant increase in the LCBP level in Lac1(S23A S24A) Lag1(S23A S24A) cells, compared to <i>LAC1</i><sup><i>+</i></sup> <i>LAG1</i><sup><i>+</i></sup> controls, and a further increase in Lac1(S23A S24A) Lag1(S23A S24A) cells expressing Ypk1* (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). If accumulation of LCBPs in Lac1(S23A S24A) Lag1(S23A S24A) co-expressing Ypk1* is indeed responsible for the poor growth, then reduction in LCBP synthesis by elimination of the gene <i>LCB4</i>, which encodes the major LCB kinase (<a href=\"#bib71\">Nagiec et al., 1998</a>), should alleviate the growth inhibition. As expected, introduction of an <i>lcb4\u0394</i> null mutation into the Lac1(S23A S24A) Lag1(S23A S24A) mutant suppressed the growth inhibitory effect of Ypk1* (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). Conversely, and consistent with toxicity arising from accumulation of LCBPs when Lac1 and Lag1 cannot be stimulated by Ypk1, we found that the poor growth phenotype of cells lacking the gene (<i>LCB3</i>) encoding the major LCBP phosphatase (<a href=\"#bib64\">Mandala et al., 1998</a>), was markedly exacerbated by introduction of the Lac1(S23A S24A) Lag1(S23A S24A) alleles, but not by introduction of the Lac1(S23E S24E) Lag1(S23E S24E) alleles (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>).

Consistent with the toxicity of LCBPs when LCB utilization by ceramide synthase is inefficient, an <i>elo3</i> mutation, which prevents efficient formation of C<sub>26</sub>-CoA (an acyl chain found in yeast ceramides), was synthetically lethal with <i>lcb3\u0394</i> (<a href=\"#bib48\">Kobayashi and Nagiec, 2003</a>)."

In agreement with the poor growth arising from LCBP-evoked induction of autophagy, we found, first, that Lac1(S23A S24A) Lag1(S23A S24A) cells expressing Ypk1* exhibited a readily detectable increase in basal GFP-Atg8 processing, comparable to that in <i>lcb3\u0394</i> cells (but, of course, much less than that occurring when cells were treated with the starvation mimetic rapamycin) (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>). Second, we found that preventing autophagy by ablating the gene <i>ATG1</i>, which encodes a protein kinase necessary for induction of autophagophore formation and its elongation (<a href=\"#bib76\">Papinski and Kraft, 2014</a>), provided substantial rescue of the growth debilitating effect of Ypk1* expression in Lac1(S23A S24A) Lag1(S23A S24A) cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>, compare to <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). This rescue was not due to an indirect effect of the absence of Atg1 on LCBP level because introduction of the <i>atg1\u0394</i> mutation did not prevent the observed hyper-accumulation of LCBP in Lac1(S23A S24A) Lag1(S23A S24A) cells expressing Ypk1* (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7G</a>). Collectively, these results indicate that, aside from stimulating ceramide synthesis per se, another physiologically important role of Ypk1-dependent ceramide synthase activation is, at least in part, to prevent hyper-accumulation of LCBPs and thereby avoid inadvertent induction of autophagy under nutrient-sufficient conditions (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>)."

A genuine Ypk1 substrate should, when highly over-expressed, sequester a large fraction of the available pool of active kinase, and thus impede its actions on its essential cellular targets. In the absence of Ypk2, over-expression of an authentic Ypk1 substrate should therefore be deleterious for growth when the activity of an analog-sensitive Ypk1 allele is reduced with a selective inhibitor. The fact that 70% of the SDL hits were indeed substrates for Ypk1-mediated phosphorylation in vitro verified that our use of this genetic method as a secondary filter to pick out true substrates from the list of bioinformatically identified candidates was well justified. In this regard, overexpression of Fpk1(KD), a catalytically-inactive non-essential Ypk1 substrate, yielded a readily detectable SDL phenotype. Thus, using the protocol we devised, SDL may be a generally useful way to identify substrates and perhaps other binding partners of protein kinases, not just those directly connected to any output phenotype being measured."

This tool was combined with a coilection of deletion mutants to identify what processes, when eliminated, are especially deleterious to cell growth and survival when TORC2 action (and presumably Ypk1 activity) is limiting.

Muk1 is also intriguing for another potential reason. In <i>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</i>, a Rab 5-like GTPase (Ryh1) and its Muk1-like GEF were identified in a screen for TORC2 activators (<a href=\"#bib102\">Tatebe et al., 2010</a>). Thus, if Ypk1-mediated phosphorylation inhibits Muk1 function, it could represent a negative feedback mechanism exerted on TORC2; conversely, if Ypk1-mediated phosphorylation stimulates Muk1 function, it could represent a mechanism for self-reinforcing maintenance of TORC2 activity and, thus, a high level of activated Ypk1. Clearly, by further investigating the physiological relevance of these and other remaining candidates much new biology may be learned. Indeed, several gene products of totally unknown function, such as Yhr097c and Ynr014w, as well as gene products (e.g., Atg21 and Pex31) not previous linked to either TORC2 or Ypk1, if validated, may provide new mechanistic insight into additional cellular processes regulated by TORC2-Ypk1 signaling."

Consistent with our findings, a previous study found a consistent decrease in ceramide synthase activity in microsomal fractions isolated from cells in which TORC2 had been inactivated (and thus Ypk1 activity was presumably reduced) (<a href=\"#bib4\">Aronova et al., 2008</a>), although indirect effects of the loss of TORC2 function on ceramide synthase activity could not be ruled out. Our findings make it clear that the role of TORC2 is to promote the Ypk1-dependent phosphorylation of Lac1 and Lag1 subunits of this enzyme. However, the precise molecular mechanism by which this post-translational modification stimulates this enzyme is still not completely clear. In this regard, it has been shown that mammalian ceramide synthase activity increases upon heterodimerization of different catalytic subunit isoforms (<a href=\"#bib50\">Laviad et al., 2012</a>). However, as judged by co-immunoprecipitation, we found no difference in the state of Lac1-Lag1 association between the wild-type proteins and either our Lac1(S23A S24A) Lag1(S23A S24A) or Lac1(S23E S24E) Lag1(S23E S24E) mutants (data not shown).

                                "text": "Although the enzymic steps that carry out sphingolipid biosynthesis have been largely elucidated, much less was known, until recently, about regulation of these enzymes (<a href=\"#bib13\">Breslow and Weissman, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Breslow, 2013</a>). The first insight came when it was demonstrated (<a href=\"#bib82\">Roelants et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Berchtold et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib99\">Sun et al., 2012</a>) that, in response to PM stresses, including treatment with myriocin and aureobasidin A, TORC2-Ypk1 signaling is activated and alleviates inhibition of the SPT complex by phosphorylating the negative regulatory proteins Orm1 and Orm2 (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). As a direct consequence, the rate of de novo production of the LCB precursor to sphingolipids is increased. Although TORC2 signaling had been implicated in promoting synthesis of ceramide, the product of LCB N-acylation (<a href=\"#bib4\">Aronova et al., 2008</a>), it was unknown whether that role was simply the result of TORC2-Ypk1-dependent stimulation of SPT function and the resulting increase in LCB supply. As we demonstrated here, Ypk1-mediated phosphorylation of Lac1 and Lag1 also increases in response to both myriocin and aureobasidin A, suggesting that ceramide synthesis per se, and not simply general elevation of LCB levels, is important for allowing the cells to cope with the effects of these antibiotics. Indeed, collectively, the findings we describe here demonstrate unequivocally that, in addition to up-regulation of SPT, TORC2-Ypk1 exerts direct control on the ceramide synthase step of the sphingolipid biosynthetic pathway by phosphorylating and stimulating the function of the Lac1 and Lag1 subunits of the ceramide synthase complex. Moreover, as we also demonstrated, the ceramide synthase reaction represents an important branch point in sphingolipid biosynthesis (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2B and 8</a>). LCBs produced by the SPT reaction can either be converted to ceramides or become phosphorylated by LCB kinase Lcb4 (and its paralog Lcb5) to form LCBPs (<a href=\"#bib71\">Nagiec et al., 1998</a>). Accumulation of LCBPs has been shown to be toxic to yeast cell growth (<a href=\"#bib45\">Kim et al., 2000</a>), as we have also confirmed here, at least in large part because, as is now known, these metabolites trigger inappropriate induction of autophagy (<a href=\"#bib108\">Zimmermann et al., 2013</a>). Thus, the rate of ceramide production must be properly adjusted to maintain the pool of LCBs and derived LCBPs at a non-deleterious level, in agreement with evidence in yeast and other organisms that ceramides and LCBPs generally play antagonist roles and must be maintained in the proper dynamic balance (<a href=\"#bib48\">Kobayashi and Nagiec, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib97\">Spiegel and Milstien, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Kihara et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Dickson, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Breslow and Weissman, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Bikman and Summers, 2011</a>). Hence, the function we have discovered and described here for TORC2-Ypk1 in stimulating ceramide synthase promotes utilization of the increased LCB generated upon TORC2-Ypk1-mediated up-regulation of SPT. This metabolic control has multiple clear-cut physiological benefits to the cell: (a) directing flow in the sphingolipid pathway toward complex sphingolipids to populate the PM barrier; (b) reduction of the level of potentially toxic LCBPs; and, (c) avoidance of inappropriate induction of autophagy under nutrient-sufficient conditions (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). Indeed, our results indicate that a significant role for the coordination exerted by TORC2-Ypk1 between the level of SPT activity and the level of ceramide synthase activity is to prevent metabolic \u2018cross-talk\u2019 to the autophagy pathway."

Consistent with this suggestion, a genetic interaction between a Ypk1 homolog (YpkA) and a Lac1/Lag1-like ceramide synthase component (BarA1) has been reported in <i>Aspergillus nidulans</i> (<a href=\"#bib20\">Colabardini et al., 2013</a>)."

In contrast to Ypk1, which is activated by TORC2, Npr1 is inhibited by TORC1 (<a href=\"#bib62\">MacGurn et al., 2011</a>). Thus, this control mechanism will only be exerted under conditions that inactivate TORC1, such as amino acid starvation (<a href=\"#bib59\">Loewith and Hall, 2011</a>), a condition that presumably requires adjustment of both PM lipid and protein composition to maximize the cell's ability to scavenge and assimilate nutrients. Under the same condition, autophagy is induced because, like Npr1, TORC1 also negatively regulates the autophagy-inducing protein kinase Atg1-Atg13 complex (<a href=\"#bib1\">Alers et al., 2014</a>). Conversely, under nutrient sufficient conditions, TORC1 is active, and phosphorylates and stimulates protein kinase Sch9. Interestingly, Sch9 action should act in concert with TORC2-Ypk1 signaling to help keep the levels of LCBs and LCBPs low and ceramides high. This is likely because Sch9 promotes transcriptional repression of genes (<i>YDC1</i> and <i>YPC1</i>) that encode ceramidases and inhibits a phosphosphingolipid phospholipase C (Isc1) that hydrolyzes complex sphingolipids (<a href=\"#bib100\">Swinnen et al., 2014</a>). Such complex multi-component controls may be a general feature of signaling modalities that interface with biosynthetic pathways that have intermediates, like LCBPs, that are not inocuous, but are themselves bioactive metabolites."

Subsequently, it was observed that, in cells lacking the regulatory subunit (Cnb1), there was an increase in C<sub>26</sub>-containing ceramides, suggesting that calcineurin somehow antagonizes TORC2-dependent signaling (<a href=\"#bib4\">Aronova et al., 2008</a>). We found that calcineurin negatively regulates ceramide synthesis by directing the dephosphorylation of Lac1 and Lag1. This Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated calcineurin-dependent dephosphorylation occurred even in cells expressing a TORC2-independent constitutively-active Ypk1 allele. Moreover, we showed here that calcineurin does not affect Pkh1- (and Pkh2-) mediated phosphorylation of the activation loop of Ypk1, and we demonstrated previously that presence or absence of calcineurin does not alter TORC2-mediated phosphorylation of Ypk1 or cause any substantial change in Ypk1 specific activity (<a href=\"#bib82\">Roelants et al., 2011</a>). Thus, direct down-modulation of either TORC2 or Ypk1 by calcineurin cannot account for the negative regulation it exerts on sphingolipid biosynthesis. What our findings now make clear is that calcineurin negatively regulates the sphingolipid pathway at the level of ceramide synthesis, at least in large part, by direct dephosphorylation of the stimulatory phosphorylations in the ceramide synthase subunits Lac1 and Lag1 that are installed by TORC2-Ypk1 signaling. Calcineurin recognizes substrates via a docking motif (PxIxIT or variants thereof), typically also accompanied quite a distance upstream by a secondary docking site (LxVP) (<a href=\"#bib85\">Roy and Cyert, 2009</a>). However, these sites can be quite degenerate; for example, the more hydrophobic variant PVIVIT is much more potent in recruiting calcineurin when it is used to replace the native \u2018PxIxIT\u2019 sequences in either the transcription factor Crz1 (PIISIQ) (<a href=\"#bib86\">Roy et al., 2007</a>) or the endocytic adaptor Aly1 (PILKIN) (<a href=\"#bib75\">O'Donnell et al., 2013</a>). In both Lac1 and Lag1, there is a similar hydrophobic sequence located at the identical position in both proteins (<sup>355</sup>PIVFVL<sup>360</sup>). Whether this or any other degenerate match represents a calcineurin-binding site remains to be determined."

This position weight matrix was then used with MOTIPS (<a href=\"#bib49\">Lam et al., 2010</a>) to identify proteins with likely phosphorylated occurrences of this motif. Yeastmine (<a href=\"#bib5\">Balakrishnan et al., 2012</a>) was used to identify all <i>S. cerevisiae</i> genes that showed genetic interactions with Ypk1, Ypk2, any component of the sphingolipid biosynthetic pathway or any component of known Ypk1 regulators (TORC2 and PP2A). Genes that showed significant growth phenotypes on myriocin, aureobasidin A and caspifungin (all compounds that cause severe growth phenotypes in <i>ypk1\u0394</i> strains) were identified from the literature (<a href=\"#bib33\">Hillenmeyer et al., 2008</a>). Lastly, MOTIPS predicted Ypk1 phosphorylation sites were compared to Phosphogrid (<a href=\"#bib88\">Sadowski et al., 2013</a>) to identify those sites known to be phosphorylated in vivo. To be considered a potential Ypk1 substrate in this study, a protein had to have a myriocin, aureobasidin or caspofungin phenotype or a Yeastmine identified genetic interaction and: (a) 4 or more MOTIPS predicted sites, (b) 3 sites with at least one above a MOTIPS likelihood score of 0.7 or a Phosphogrid identified site or (c) 1\u20132 sites with a MOTIPS likelihood score of 0.7 and a Phosphogrid identified site. We also considered for further analysis a limited number of proteins that did not meet these criteria, but which still contained Ypk1 motifs. These are indicated in <a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>."

(2013) that we cited in the original manuscript, in which it is rather convincingly shown that accumulation of LCB-Ps is a condition that stimulates autophagy, I also think it is fair to state here that the genetic evidence we provided for this conclusion in our case was already quite strong because not only did loss of Lcb3 (phosphatase) make the growth of Lac1(S23A S24A) Lag1(S23A S24A) cells decidedly worse (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>), but conversely loss of Lcb4 (kinase) distinctly ameliorated the growth of Lac1(S23A S24A) Lag1(S23A S24A) cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>), in addition to the detectable growth rescue conferred by loss of the essential autophagy inducer, Atg1."

Among the hits, the authors demonstrate that Ypk1 directly phosphorylates and activates the ceramide synthases Lag1 and Lac1. This finding answers the long-standing question of how the TORC2-Ypk signaling pathway controls ceramide synthesis, which was previously shown by the Ted Powers group (Aronova et al., 2008). Experiments are properly controlled, the manuscript is well written, and the finding significantly advances our understanding of TORC2-Ypk signaling in sphingolipid metabolism.
