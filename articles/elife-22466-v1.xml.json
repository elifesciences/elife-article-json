However, it is still largely unknown how oxytocin exactly regulates neuronal function. We show that early, transient oxytocin exposure <i>in vitro</i> inhibits the development of hippocampal glutamatergic neurons, leading to reduced dendrite complexity, synapse density, and excitatory transmission, while sparing GABAergic neurons. Conversely, genetic elimination of oxytocin receptors increases the expression of protein components of excitatory synapses and excitatory synaptic transmission <i>in vitro</i>. <i>In vivo</i>, oxytocin-receptor-deficient hippocampal pyramidal neurons develop more complex dendrites, which leads to increased spine number and reduced \u03b3-oscillations. These results indicate that oxytocin controls the development of hippocampal excitatory neurons and contributes to the maintenance of a physiological excitation/inhibition balance, whose disruption can cause neurobehavioral disturbances."

However, it is still largely unknown how oxytocin exactly regulates neuronal function. We show that early, transient oxytocin exposure <i>in vitro</i> inhibits the development of hippocampal glutamatergic neurons, leading to reduced dendrite complexity, synapse density, and excitatory transmission, while sparing GABAergic neurons. Conversely, genetic elimination of oxytocin receptors increases the expression of protein components of excitatory synapses and excitatory synaptic transmission <i>in vitro</i>. <i>In vivo</i>, oxytocin-receptor-deficient hippocampal pyramidal neurons develop more complex dendrites, which leads to increased spine number and reduced \u03b3-oscillations. These results indicate that oxytocin controls the development of hippocampal excitatory neurons and contributes to the maintenance of a physiological excitation/inhibition balance, whose disruption can cause neurobehavioral disturbances."

By activating G protein-coupled Oxt receptors (Oxtr) in peripheral target tissues, Oxt exerts multiple effects, most prominently uterine contraction during parturition and milk ejection after delivery. In addition, Oxt is released in the brain by synaptic release from projections of parvocellular PVN neurons and by hormone-like release from the somata and dendrites of magnocellular neurons (<a href=\"#bib44\">Ludwig and Leng, 2006</a>). Based on these processes and its long half-life, Oxt can act in diverse Oxtr-expressing brain areas even when direct innervation by Oxt-containing fibers is absent (<a href=\"#bib72\">Stoop, 2012</a>)."

These functions are corroborated by studies on mice lacking Oxt or Oxtrs (<a href=\"#bib53\">Nishimori et al., 1996</a>). Notably, the behavioral phenotype of <i>Oxtr</i> knock-out (<i>Oxtr<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup></i>) mice recapitulates several symptoms of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) (<a href=\"#bib40\">Lee et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Sala et al., 2011</a>). Conversely, behavioral changes in mouse ASD models that are not based on direct perturbations of Oxt signaling, such as \u03bc\u00a0opiod receptor (<i>Opmr1</i>) (<a href=\"#bib24\">Gigliucci et al., 2014</a>) or contactin associated protein-like 2 (<i>Cntnap2</i>) knock-outs (<a href=\"#bib55\">Pe\u00f1agarikano et al., 2015</a>), are rescued upon Oxt administration, and even human ASD patients improve with Oxt treatment (<a href=\"#bib1\">Andari et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Hollander et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Striepens et al., 2011</a>). Moreover, <i>Oxtr</i> polymorphisms (<a href=\"#bib43\">LoParo and Waldman, 2015</a>) and abnormal methylation of the <i>Oxtr</i> promoter (<a href=\"#bib18\">Elagoz Yuksel et al., 2016</a>) have been linked with ASDs, supporting the notion that altered Oxt signaling can contribute to ASDs."

The circulating Oxt reaches the fetal brain, where it regulates the developmental switch of GABAergic signaling from excitation to inhibition (<a href=\"#bib76\">Tyzio et al., 2006</a>). This switch appears to be impaired in the valproate-intoxication and fragile-X-syndrome mouse models of ASDs, and to be restored by Oxt treatment. Moreover, administration of an Oxtr antagonist to na\u00efve pregnant mice one day before delivery leads to ASD-like features in the offspring (<a href=\"#bib77\">Tyzio et al., 2014</a>). These findings indicate that an early blockade of Oxt signaling affects the development of synaptic wiring in the brain and leads to lifelong consequences, including neuropsychiatric diseases. This notion is supported by the observations that <i>Oxtr<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup></i> mice show an increased seizure propensity and that the relative contribution of GABAergic synapses is reduced in cultured hippocampal <i>Oxtr<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup></i> neurons (<a href=\"#bib66\">Sala et al., 2011</a>). However, the hypothesis that early, transient Oxt signaling shapes or 'primes' neuronal morphology and function in the brain remains to be tested."

We demonstrate that Oxt exerts an early and cell-type specific 'priming' effect on developing excitatory neurons to regulate dendrite branching and synapse development, synaptic transmission, and the synchronicity of neuronal networks. These findings are likely of key relevance for the molecular pathology of brain diseases that involve altered Oxt signaling."

To assess the effects of transient exposure of hippocampal neurons to Oxt, we reenacted <i>in vitro</i> the <i>in vivo</i> Oxt maternal surge by treating autaptic cultures (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bekkers and Stevens, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Burgalossi et al., 2012</a>) with 100 nM Oxt for 1\u20133 days <i>in vitro</i> (DIV), starting on the first day after seeding. Oxt exposure did not affect neuronal survival (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1a,b</a>) but reduced the dendritic arborization of neurons at 14 DIV, as assessed by Sholl analysis (<a href=\"#bib69\">Sholl, 1953</a>) of cells stained with an antibody to the dendrite marker Map2 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1a\u2013c</a>). The altered dendrite branching was found only in wild-type (WT) glutamatergic neurons, but not in WT hippocampal inhibitory neurons identified by VGAT staining (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2a,b</a>) or in <i>Oxtr</i>-deficient neurons (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3a\u2013c</a>). To test whether the altered morphology affects synaptogenesis, we quantified the number of excitatory synapses of hippocampal autaptic neurons. Using antibodies to VGLUT1 and PSD95 to label glutamatergic pre- and post-synaptic compartments, respectively (<a href=\"#bib50\">Nair et al., 2013</a>), we determined the number of immunoreactive puncta in each Map2-labeled neuron (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1d</a>). Oxt exposure reduced the number of juxtaposed glutamatergic pre- and post-synaptic sites, but no changes were detected in the spatial coincidence of pre- and postsynaptic labeling (Mander's overlapping coefficient) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1e\u2013g</a>), indicating that the integrity of the remaining glutamatergic synapses is maintained."

To test if Oxtrs mediate the Oxt effects seen in our system, we exposed autaptic cultures to Oxt for 1 or 3 DIV in the presence of the Oxtr antagonist Atosiban (ATO). Morphological analyses at 14 DIV showed that ATO treatment abolished the Oxt-induced effects on dendrite arborization, whereas ATO alone was ineffective (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1h\u2013j</a>), indicating that the Oxt effects on dendrites and synapses of hippocampal neurons are mediated by Oxtrs."

The amplitudes of evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) were decreased in Oxt-treated glutamatergic neurons (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a,c</a>). The same was true for the size of the apparent readily releasable pool (RRP) of glutamatergic synaptic vesicles (SVs), as assessed by the EPSC induced by the application of a hypertonic sucrose solution (<a href=\"#bib50\">Nair et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Rosenmund and Stevens, 1996</a>) (Figure a,d). In contrast, neither evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) amplitudes nor the RRP of GABAergic neurons, which represent a minor cell fraction in hippocampal autaptic cultures, were affected by Oxt, indicating that Oxt exclusively acts on excitatory hippocampal neurons in culture (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2b\u2013d</a>). The vesicular release probability (P<sub>vr</sub>) of glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons, calculated by dividing the postsynaptic charge transfer elicited by an action potential (AP) by the postsynaptic charge transfer in response to RRP release, was not changed by Oxt exposure (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2e</a>), indicating that the fusion-probability of primed SVs is not altered by Oxt. We next studied synaptic short-term plasticity (STP) by measuring synaptic responses during 10 Hz stimulus trains, and found that EPSC and IPSC amplitudes depressed similarly and irrespective of Oxt-treatment (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2l,m</a>). These findings indicate that Oxt specifically causes strong reductions of EPSCs but does not affect the fundamental characteristics of the presynaptic transmitter release machinery."

This indicates that the number of surface glutamate receptors in glutamatergic neurons, but not of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors in GABAergic cells, is decreased by early Oxt exposure, supporting the notion that Oxt specifically affects excitatory neurons. To exert these actions, Oxt requires the Oxtr, since the addition of ATO suppressed the reduction of EPSCs induced by Oxt (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1a\u2013k</a>) and Oxtr-deficient neurons did not show any changes in their electrophysiological characteristics upon Oxt treatment (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3d\u2013j</a>). Surprisingly, Oxt effects were restricted to the early phase of synaptic development, as Oxt-application to neurons from DIV 7 onwards, that\u00a0is, at a time when synaptogenesis is ongoing, did not cause any changes in the morphology and function of glutamatergic neurons (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2a\u2013k</a>)."

We first assessed synaptic dysfunctions in mass cultures of hippocampal neurons obtained at embryonic day 18 (E18). Initially, 14 DIV <i>Oxtr<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup></i> and <i>Oxtr<sup>+/+</sup></i> neurons were stained using antibodies against VGAT or VGLUT1 and Map2 to label presynapses and dendrites, respectively (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5a</a>). Quantitative analyses of VGAT- or VGLUT1-positive fluorescent puncta juxtaposed to Map2-positive dendrites showed that the density of VGAT-positive puncta was reduced and the density of VGLUT1-positive puncta was increased in <i>Oxtr<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup></i> cultures as compared to <i>Oxtr<sup>+/+</sup></i> cultures (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5a,c</a>). These data complement our finding that the development and synaptogenesis of glutamatergic neurons is perturbed upon exposure to Oxt, and indicate an enhanced excitation/inhibition ratio. This imbalance appears to be caused by altered synapse numbers rather than a change in the ratio between excitatory and inhibitory neurons, because the number of GAD65/67-positive GABAergic neurons was similar in <i>Oxtr<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup></i> and <i>Oxtr<sup>+/+</sup></i> cultures (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1a,b</a>). Likewise, the number of parvalbumin-positive cells, a sub-population of inhibitory interneurons, was similar in hippocampal cultures (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1c,d</a>) and brain slices (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1e,f</a>) of <i>Oxtr<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup></i> vs. <i>Oxtr<sup>+/+</sup></i> mice.

Further, changes in synchronous network activity, e.g. in \u03b3-oscillations, have been described in ASD patients (<a href=\"#bib63\">Rojas and Wilson, 2014</a>), and in mouse models carrying mutations that cause heritable ASD in humans (<a href=\"#bib31\">Hammer et al., 2015</a>).

In contrast, previously reported effects of Oxt on neuronal morphology mostly concerned autocrine Oxt signaling, which can have different effects depending on the context. For instance, Oxt released from the somato-dendritic compartments of magnocellular neurons in the SON is thought to stimulate dendrite development in an autocrine fashion (<a href=\"#bib12\">Chevaleyre et al., 2001</a>) likely in synergy with afferent glutamate release (<a href=\"#bib13\">Chevaleyre et al., 2002</a>), whereas during lactation, when Oxt levels are high, dendrite branching decreases in magnocellular SON neurons (<a href=\"#bib71\">Stern and Armstrong, 1998</a>)."

In neuroblastoma and glioblastoma cells, for instance, Oxtr agonists differentially regulate the genes encoding Nestin and Map2 (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bakos et al., 2013</a>). In addition, activation of the PLC\u03b2 pathway, which mediates the effects of Otx on dendrite development in hippocampal neurons (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), affects dendrite morphology. For example, tonic activation of \u03b1<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic receptors activates the PLC\u03b2 pathway to cause dendrite retraction and reduced spine density in pyramidal neurons (<a href=\"#bib15\">Cook and Wellman, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Radley et al., 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib58\">2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Wellman, 2001</a>), and sustained PKC activation downstream of PLC\u03b2 signalling modulates spine density in hippocampal neurons by perturbing actin cytoskeleton cross-linking (<a href=\"#bib11\">Calabrese and Halpain, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Hains et al., 2009</a>). Further, PKC activity is known to affect dendrite development in several other neuronal cell types. For instance, PKC activators cause a strong reduction of the dendrite complexity in Purkinje cells, while PKC inhibition leads to increased dendrite size (<a href=\"#bib46\">Metzger and Kapfhammer, 2000</a>). Hence, it is likely that the concerted action of such pathways downstream of Oxtr activation ultimately converge to control neuron growth and synaptogenesis as described here."

                                "text": "A striking and unexpected finding of our study is that the morphoregulatory effects of Oxt appear to specifically target glutamatergic but not GABAergic neurons. Our analysis shows that this specificity is caused by the fact that GABAergic neurons express very low Oxtr levels or none at all (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig2\">2</a> and <a href=\"#fig4\">4</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Immunohistochemical mapping of Oxtr-expressing neurons in brain sections of <i>Oxtr<sup>Vn/+</sup></i> mice showed that Oxtrs are widely expressed throughout the entire hippocampus and that all hippocampal subregions contain Oxtr expressing cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This is in contrast to a previous report indicating that the Oxtr is mainly expressed in the CA3 subregion (<a href=\"#bib32\">Hammock and Levitt, 2013</a>) but nicely matches recent observations obtained using a novel specific antibody to the mouse Oxtr (<a href=\"#bib47\">Mitre et al., 2016</a>), showing Oxtr expression in the pyramidal cell layer in all hippocampal subfields. More importantly, the majority of Oxtr-expressing neurons are GAD-67-negative (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Further, Oxtr expression is undetectable in the striatum, which is mostly composed of GABAergic neurons, and Oxtr expression in cultured striatal neurons rendered these cells sensitive to the morphoregulatory effects of Oxt (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). In essence, these findings show that GABAergic neurons contain the intracellular signaling pathways that mediate the Oxt effects on neuronal morphology but are intrinsically insensitive to Oxt due to the lack of Oxtrs."

                                "text": "Our finding that Oxt exerts its morphoregulatory effects selectively on excitatory neurons is unexpected in the light of several publications reporting that, in rat, Oxt acutely activates interneurons located in the stratum pyramidale and modulates fast-spiking interneurons, thus enhancing inhibitory synaptic transmission in the hippocampus (<a href=\"#bib48\">M\u00fchlethaler et al., 1984</a>, <a href=\"#bib49\">1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Owen et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib87\">Zaninetti and Raggenbass, 2000</a>). One explanation for these discrepancies could be a species difference between mouse and rat as regards Oxt sensitivity of inhibitory neurons. Indeed, species-specific effects of Oxt in rat and guinea pig hippocampal neurons were described previously (<a href=\"#bib59\">Raggenbass et al., 1989</a>). A second explanation concerns the respective experimental design. We aimed at analyzing the effects of an extended but transient Oxt exposure of isolated neurons to mimic the diffusive action of Oxt in the fetal brain prior to and during parturition, while previous studies mainly addressed acute effects of Oxt in hippocampal slices. Such acute effects may even include alterations of inwardly rectifying K<sup>+</sup> channel conductance (<a href=\"#bib28\">Gravati et al., 2010</a>). In an acute Oxt treatment scenario in slices, indirect circuit effects of Oxt signaling cannot be excluded, and priming effects of Oxt signaling and their long-term consequences for neuronal morphology and function cannot be detected. A third explanation relates to Oxtr and Avpr pharmacology. Most previous studies employed concentrations of Oxtr ligands that are likely to also activate Avprs, so that Oxtr independent effects cannot be excluded. In contrast, the Oxt, Oxtr agonist, and Oxtr antagonist concentrations used in the present study were chosen based on the relative Oxt affinities of mouse Oxtrs and Avprs in order to ensure selective targeting of Oxtrs (<a href=\"#bib9\">Busnelli et al., 2013</a>)."

Because the neurons were cultured from embryos after hysterectomy at gestation day 18 and because the culture medium used in our experiments most likely does not contain Oxt, phenotypic changes seen in cultured <i>Oxtr<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup></i> neurons likely arise from a lack of Oxtr signaling late in gestation, when Oxt levels are already increased (<a href=\"#bib56\">Pfaff et al., 2002</a>).

This parallels the changes in hippocampi of <i>Oxtr<sup>Vn/Vn</sup></i> mice, in which glutamatergic neurons showed more complex dendrites (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>), and the increased excitatory neurotransmission and spine number in acute hippocampal slices (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>).

It is possible that this discrepancy is due to homeostatic mechanisms that control the interplay between excitation and inhibition in mass cultures but are irrelevant in single-neuron autaptic cultures. Apart from this, it is possible that the absolute number of inhibitory synapses in mass culture is not changed but that synapses are simply 'diluted' over the larger dendrites of glutamatergic <i>Oxtr<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup></i> neurons, which represent about 80% of the cells in the culture. This could be the cause of the small reduction in the density of inhibitory synapses as detected by NL2 and Gephyrin labeling, which might escape detection by GABA<sub>A</sub>\u03b32 labeling. This notion is supported by the fact that sIPSC frequency is unchanged in mass-cultured <i>Oxtr<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup></i> neurons (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5l</a>)."

Indeed, most genes known to be involved in the genetic etiology of ASDs encode proteins that directly or indirectly determine synapse density or function and hence excitation/inhibition balance (<a href=\"#bib37\">Kleijer et al., 2014</a>), and, correspondingly, excitation/inhibition imbalances are a key feature of numerous genetic mouse models of ASD (<a href=\"#bib27\">Gogolla et al., 2009</a>).

These oscillations are thought to play a key role in cognitive functions mediated by the hippocampus, such as memory coding, memory retrieval, and working memory (<a href=\"#bib14\">Colgin and Moser, 2010</a>), and their perturbation has been linked to multiple brain disease states. Similar alterations in CA3 \u03b3-oscillations, although likely caused by a different cellular mechanism, were observed in other genetic mouse models of ASD (<a href=\"#bib31\">Hammer et al., 2015</a>), and perturbed \u03b3-oscillatory activity can be detected in ASD patients (<a href=\"#bib63\">Rojas and Wilson, 2014</a>) and other neuropsychiatric disorders (<a href=\"#bib45\">Maxwell et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib84\">Woo et al., 2010</a>). These findings led to the idea that perturbations of \u03b3-oscillations might serve as a 'biomarker' for the corresponding disorders, which is supported by the present data on <i>Oxtr</i>-deficient mice. Interestingly, the specific activation of GABAergic cells during acute application of the Oxtr agonist TGOT in rat hippocampal slices increases the population spike during kainate-induced \u03b3-oscillations, without inducing any changes in oscillation power (<a href=\"#bib54\">Owen et al., 2013</a>). While it is not clear whether these effects are due to a specific role of Oxt-signaling in the rat, which is not relevant in the mouse, the corresponding data show that short-term action of Oxt is not sufficient to induce changes in neuronal network function although excitation/inhibition balance is changed transiently. In general terms, the perturbation of \u03b3-oscillations in <i>Oxtr<sup>Vn/Vn</sup></i> mice may be a consequence of the altered excitation/inhibition balance during the early stages of neuronal network formation. In all current models of \u03b3-oscillatory activity, inhibitory interneurons, such as basket cells targeting the somata of principal cells, play a key role (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bartos et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Buzs\u00e1ki and Wang, 2012</a>). It is possible that more complex dendrites of CA3 principal cells in <i>Oxtr<sup>Vn/Vn</sup></i> mice receive more excitatory inputs as shown by the increased number of spines observed in CA3 pyramidal neurons, causing an increased excitatory drive onto these cells that partly overrides the inhibitory inputs. An alternative scenario would be that the increase in dendrite complexity of CA3 neurons leads to a reduced input resistance of these cells, a consequent reduction in their activity, and a reduction in \u03b3-oscillations."

After washing, the dissociated neurons were seeded onto the microisland plates in pre-warmed Neurobasal medium (Gibco) supplemented with B27 (Gibco), Glutamax (Gibco) and penicillin (100 U/ml)/streptomycin (100 \u03bcg/ml) at a density of\u00a0~4000 cell/well. Autaptic cultures were exposed to Oxt (100 nM; Bachem), atosiban (100 nM; Sigma-Aldrich), or both during the first 3 DIV by adding fresh drug solution every 24 hr.

Electrophysiological recordings were performed between 9 and 14 DIV, whereas immunofluorescence analyses were carried out at 14 DIV.

Due to the aberrant maternal behaviour and the defective lactation of <i>Oxtr<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup></i> dams, which results in the premature death of offspring (<a href=\"#bib74\">Takayanagi et al., 2005</a>), <i>Oxtr<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup></i>\u00a0hippocampal neurons were routinely prepared from embryos at E18. Briefly, hippocampi of E18 mouse embryos were isolated and dissociated by treatment with 2.5 g/L trypsin for 15 min at 37\u00b0C and repeated pipetting through a fire-polished Pasteur pipette. The cells were then plated onto 24 mm poly-L-lysine (Sigma-Aldrich) coated glass coverslips at a density of\u00a0~160,000 cells/well. For each preparation, two pregnant mice of each genotype type carrying 6\u20138 embryos each were used. Neurons were grown in B27-supplemented (Invitrogen-Gibco) Neurobasal medium, and maintained at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for up to 14 DIV. Primary hippocampal mass cultures from C57BL/6J mouse hippocampi (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) were exposed to the selective Oxtr agonist Thr4-Gly7-Oxytocin (TGOT, 10 nM; Bachem) during the first 3 DIV after plating by adding fresh solution every 24 hr."

The brains were then isolated and post-fixed for 16 hr at 4\u00b0C with 4% paraformaldehyde. After extensive washes with PBS, the brains were passed through a sucrose gradient. The brains were then snap frozen in a \u221245\u00b0C isopentane bath, and coronal cryosections of 50 \u03bcm thickness were collected on Superfrost Plus slides, and air dried for 1 hr. After washing with PBS, brain sections were incubated with gentle agitation using blocking solution (10% goat serum, 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS) and subsequently incubated at 4\u00b0C overnight with primary antibodies and DAPI diluted in blocking buffer, followed by incubation with the corresponding secondary antibodies conjugated with appropriate fluorophores for 4 hr at RT. Subsequently, the sections were washed three times with PBS and mounted on slides using Immu-Mount (Thermo Scientific) mounting medium. Fluorescence images were acquired using a Leica SP2 confocal microscope using a 10x objective and a 40x objective for higher magnification. For quantitative analyses of the number of Oxtr-Venus neurons co-localizing with GAD67 or GABA (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>), the number of Oxtr Venus-positive neurons was estimated on thresholded, binarized images using the Analyze Particle tool in ImageJ, while the number of colocalizing cells was counted manually with the help of the Cell Counter plugin in ImageJ. Imaging of WT and <i>Oxtr<sup>Vn/Vn</sup></i> hippocampal neurons expressing tdTomato in coronal sections was performed with a Leica SP5 confocal microscope by acquisition of tdTomato fluorescence in z-stack serial scans at 0.1 \u03bcm steps. The morphological analyses (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>) were performed manually on z-stack maximum projections. CA1 hippocampal pyramidal neurons, whose polarized structure was maintained in coronal sections, were analyzed by discriminating between the basal neurites (this terminology includes both dendrites and the axonal projection) and the apical dendrites of electroporated cells. On the contrary, since the entire polarized structure of CA3 neurons is not preserved/included upon coronal cryo-sectioning, the whole complexity of primary neurites was analyzed. Twenty micrometer <i>Oxtr<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup></i> and <i>Oxtr<sup>+/+</sup></i> brain sections (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) from 3-months-old animals were imaged using a Zeiss LSM 710 laser scanning confocal microscope. PV-positive cells were counted separately for the two hemispheres and normalized for a defined area. Analysis was performed using the ImageJ software. For spine and morphological analysis of <i>Oxtr<sup>Vn/Vn</sup></i> and <i>Oxtr<sup>+/+</sup></i> hippocampal slices (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>), CA1 and CA3 biocytin-filled pyramidal neurons were used. Cells were voltage clamped at \u221270 mV for 20 min in order to allow the diffusion of the pipette solution containing biocytin to the dendtritic compartment. After carefully removing the patch pipette at the end of the recording, hippocampal slices were first fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and then incubated at room temperature for 4 hr with Alexa-555-labeled streptavidin (Molecular Probes) and DAPI, diluted in PBS containing 10% goat serum and 0.3% Triton X-100. After repetitive washing with PBS, slices were mounted on slides in polyethylene glycol mounting media (Aqua Poly Mount 18606; Polysciences). For dendrite analysis, images were taken using a Leica SP5 confocal microscope (Leica) with a 40x oil objective. Using the NeuronStudio software (NIC, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY, USA; RRID:<a href=\"https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_013798\">SCR_013798</a>) (<a href=\"#bib61\">Rodriguez et al., 2008</a>, <a href=\"#bib62\">2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Wearne et al., 2005</a>), we first performed a semi-automatic tracing of the entire dendritic tree and then used the NeuronStudio segmentation data (<a href=\"#bib80\">Wearne et al., 2005</a>) to count the cumulative branching points. For spine analysis fluorescent neurons were imaged using a Leica SP5 microscope with a 8 kHz resonant scanner, a 100 x/1.44 NA oil objective (Leica HCX PL APO CS; Leica), and a white light laser light source (SuperK EXTREME EXW-12, NKT Photonics A/S). Fluorescence signals were excited at 555 nm, and emission was acquired between 565 nm and 650 nm. Single CA3 pyramidal neurons were imaged entirely in a single stack of images (step size 0.13 \u03bcm) with the stitching extension provided by the Leica software (Leica APS-AF). Following acquisition, all images were filtered using the 3D Gaussian filter in Image J (\u03c3x,y 0.7, \u03c3z 1.0) with the help of a custom-written macro to process the large data set. Dendritic spines were counted and classified into stubby, thin, and mushroom-type using the NeuronStudio segmentation algorithm by keeping the suggested parameters (<a href=\"#bib61\">Rodriguez et al., 2008</a>), except for the 'threshold correction', which we set to 20%, and the head diameter of mushroom spines, which we set to 0.3 \u00b5m."

Subsequently, cells were incubated for 20 min with gentle agitation in blocking solution containing 0.3% (v/v) Triton, 10% (v/v) normal goat serum (GIBCO), and 0.1% (w/v) fish skin gelatin (Sigma) in PBS. The same solution was used for diluting primary and secondary antibodies. Neurons were incubated with primary antibodies for 2 hr at room temperature or overnight at 4\u00b0C, followed by incubation with the corresponding secondary antibodies conjugated with appropriate fluorophores for 2 hr at RT. After repetitive washes with PBS, coverslips were mounted using the Vectashield medium with DAPI (Vector Laboratories). The same protocol was followed for all immunolabeling, with the exception of the staining for PSD95, for which cells were fixed in absolute methanol for 7 min at \u221220\u00b0C. Immunofluorescence staining of hippocampal mass cultures (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplements 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s2\">2</a>) was carried out as described previously (<a href=\"#bib41\">Lentini et al., 2008</a>). Briefly, following fixation, neurons were incubated for 20 min in gelatin dilution buffer [GDB, 0.02 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.45 M NaCl, 0.2% (w/v) gelatin] containing 0.3% (v/v) Triton X-100, and incubated with primary antibody in GDB for 2 hr at RT. After washing with PBS, coverslips were incubated for 1 hr at RT with secondary antibodies. Nuclei were stained following an incubation for 5 min with 1 \u03bcM DAPI in PBS. For the analysis of inhibitory and excitatory synapses in autaptic cultured neurons, triple stainings for Gephyrin, VGAT, and Map2, or for PSD95, VGLUT1, and Map2, were performed. Image acquisition was performed using a Leica SP2 confocal microscope at high magnification (40x objective, numerical aperture 1.0; resolution 1024 \u00d7 1024 pixels), and image analysis was carried out using the ImageJ software (NIH). Synapse number was assessed as previously reported (<a href=\"#bib78\">Varoqueaux et al., 2002</a>). Briefly, the fluorescent signals of pre- and post-synaptic markers were first thresholded, and then the number of puncta in each cell was measured after the application of a separation filter capable of distinguishing larger puncta. In colocalization experiments assessing immunostained pre- and post-synaptic proteins, the background signal was substracted using the Subtract Background Plugin, and the Intensity Correlation Analysis plugin was used to calculate the Manders' overlap coefficient. Single cell dendrite complexity was evaluated using the advanced Sholl analysis plugin of ImageJ, in which concentric circles are drawn at 5 \u03bcm intervals around a common center in the cell body, and the numbers of crossing dendrites are counted at each circle (<a href=\"#bib69\">Sholl, 1953</a>). From the Sholl analysis data, we then calculated the number of intersecting dendrites in the interval, expressed as distance from the cell body, showing the largest number of intersections (\u226425% below the maximum number of intersections). This interval was 25\u201380 \u03bcm in hippocampal neurons and 15\u201360 \u03bcm in striatal cultures. The images used for the Sholl analysis were acquired using an upright epifluorescence microscope (Zeiss Axio Imager Z1) with a 25x objective lens. For the analysis of pre- and post-synaptic proteins in hippocampal mass cultures (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), stained neurons were subjected to imaging analysis using a Zeiss LSM 710 laser scanning confocal microscope with a 63x objective. For each coverslip (two for each experimental condition) from 3\u20134 independent cell preparations, eight random fields were captured and analyzed. For VGAT and VGLUT1 experiments, z-stack serial scans at 1 \u03bcm steps were taken and the puncta juxtaposed to Map2-positive processes with different lengths were counted and normalized to 10 \u03bcm dendrite length. The quantitative analysis of post-synaptic markers (NL1, NL2, PSD95, Gephyrin, GluA1, GluN1, and GABA\u03b32) was performed by calculating three distinct parameters, i.e. the total number of merged fluorescent clusters, and the intensities and areas of fluorescence in dendrites with different lengths. Only the fluorescent cluster density is shown here for reasons of brevity because the other two parameters gave identical results. The data were then normalized to 10 \u03bcm dendritic length. In each field, 7\u20138 dendritic tracts with different lengths were analyzed up to a total of 105/120 dendrites for each of the three preparations using the NIH ImageJ software."

For morphological analyses, littermates from <i>Oxtr<sup>Vn/+</sup></i> interbreedings were used. <i>In utero</i> electroporation to the ammonic neuroepithelium resulted in the specific and sparse targeting of neuronal progenitors of pyramidal neurons which allowed the reconstruction and subsequent morphological analysis of isolated nerve cells. Pregnant females were deeply anesthetized and kept on a warming pad (31\u201332\u00b0C) during the entire surgical procedure. The anesthesia was maintained by a steady supply of isoflurane (DeltaSelect) and oxygen (1 L/min). The uterus with the embryos was exposed through a\u00a0~2 cm midline incision in the ventral abdomen peritoneum and moistened with warmed PBS containing antibiotics (1000 U/ml penicillin/streptomycin; Invitrogen). The plasmid [at a concentration of 1.25 \u03bcg/\u03bcl, prepared using an EndoFree plasmid purification kit (Quiagen) and dissolved in TE (TrisHCl pH 8.0) buffer with 0.05% Fast Green dye (Sigma)] was injected using a glass capillary into the lateral ventricles of embryos. Electric square pulses (38 V, 50 mA, 50 ms duration, 950 ms intervals, six pulses per embryo) were applied to each embryo with an ECM830 electroporator (BTX Harvard Apparatus). Subsequently, the uterus was placed back into the abdominal cavity, and the body wall was sutured. P7 animals were used for neuronal morphology reconstruction. After intracardiac perfusion with saline followed by 4% PFA, brains were isolated from skulls and post-fixed for 16 hr in 4% PFA in phosphate buffer (PB; pH 7.4), followed by extensive washing with PBS. After passing through a 10\u201330% sucrose gradient, 100 \u03bcm-thick coronal cryosections were collected on Superfrost Pluss glass slides (Thermo Scientific), mounted, and signals of tdTomato fluorescence were acquired with a Leica SP5 confocal microscope using a 40x objective."

                                "text": "For electrophysiology, autaptic cultured neurons (9\u201314 DIV) were whole-cell voltage-clamped at \u221270 mV with an EPSC10 amplifier (HEKA) under the control of the Patchmaster two program (HEKA). All traces were analyzed using AxoGraph X (AxoGraph Scientific). The experiments were performed using a patch-pipette solution containing (in mM) 136 KCl, 17.8 Hepes, 1 EGTA, 0.6 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 4 NaATP, 0.3 mM Na<sub>2</sub>GTP, 15 creatine phosphate, and 5 U/mL phosphocreatine kinase (315\u2013320 mOsmol/L, pH 7.4). The extracellular solution used for all recordings contained (in mM) 140 NaCl, 2.4 KCl, 10 Hepes, 10 glucose, 4 CaCl<sub>2</sub> and 4 MgCl<sub>2</sub> (320\u00a0mOsml/liter), pH, 7.3. Evoked EPSCs and IPSCs were induced by depolarizing the cell from \u221270 to 0 mV at a frequency of 0.2 Hz. The size of the ready releasable pool (RRP) was measured upon 6 s application of 0.5 M hypertonic sucrose solution. The vesicular release probability (P<sub>vr</sub>) was calculated by dividing the charge transfer during an action potential induced PSC by the charge transfer during the sucrose response. Short-term plasticity was evaluated by recording PSCs during 10 Hz stimulation trains. Miniature EPS (mEPSC) and IPS (mIPSC) currents were recorded in the presence of 300 nM tetrodotoxin (TTX, Tocris Bioscience). The cell surface expression of GABA and glutamate receptor was assessed by focal application of 100 \u03bcM glutamic acid (Sigma) or 3 \u03bcM GABA (Sigma), respectively. Spontaneous postsynaptic currents (sPSCs; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) were recorded in a whole-cell configuration using an internal solution containing (in mM) 135 CsCl, 3 NaCl, 10 EGTA, 0.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 4 ATP, 0.3 GTP, and 10 Hepes, pH 7.4, with CsOH, and a bath solution containing (in mM) 140 NaCl, 3 KCl, 10 glucose, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub> and 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 Hepes, pH 7.4, with NaOH. During sPSC recordings, the internal solution was supplemented with 5 mM N-ethyllidocaine (QX-314) in order to block action potentials in the patch-clamped neuron. Moreover, during the recording of glutamatergic PSCs (sEPSC) 10 \u03bcM bicuculline was added to block GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, whereas during GABAergic PSC (sIPSC) recording 10 \u03bcM 2,3-dihydroxy-6-nitro7-sulfamoyl-benzo[f]quinoxaline-2,3-dione (NBQX) and 30 \u03bcM 4- (3phosphonopropyl)piperazine-2-carboxylic acid (CPP) were added to block AMPA and NMDA receptors, respectively. Spontaneous synaptic events were detected using NeuroMatic, a collection of Igor Pro (WaveMetrics Inc.) functions (<a href=\"http://www.neuromatic.thinkrandom.com/\">http://www.neuromatic.thinkrandom.com/</a>) upon setting at 10 pA as detection threshold. The amplitude averages and standard deviations were calculated using the lognormal function of the Origin 7.5 software (OriginLab Corp), due to lognormal distribution of the amplitudes of spontaneous synaptic events. Inter-event intervals for spontaneous synaptic events were distributed exponentially and mean intervals were obtained from the best mono-exponential fit of the inter-event interval distributions. Gamma oscillations were recorded in juvenile <i>Oxtr<sup>+/+</sup></i> and <i>Oxtr<sup>Vn/Vn</sup></i> mice (P15\u201326). Transverse hippocampal slices (300 \u00b5m thickness) were prepared as described previously (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bischofberger et al., 2006</a>) using a vibratome (Leica VT1200S) from age-matched littermates anesthetized with isoflurane (DeltaSelect). Brain isolation and slice preparation were performed on ice in a sucrose-based slicing solution (230 mM sucrose, 26 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 2 mM KCl, 1 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM D-glucose, 0.5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>) under oxygenation with carbogen gas (95% O<sub>2</sub>, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>). After sectioning, slices were placed in a holding chamber containing ACSF (120 mM NaCl, 26 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 2 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM D-glucose, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>) and allowed to recover for 10\u201315 min before recording. Hippocampal \u03b3-oscillations were recorded in the CA3 region, where the peak power of kainate-induced \u03b3-oscillations is reported to be the highest (<a href=\"#bib17\">Craig and McBain, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Hammer et al., 2015</a>). All recordings were performed using an interface recording chamber (BSCBU Base Unit with the BSC-HT Haas Top, Harvard Apparatus). Slices were constantly perfused with ACSF and the temperature was maintained at 33\u00b0C. Extracellular recording electrodes filled with ACSF were placed in the pyramidal cell layer of CA3 and extracellular field potentials were recorded for\u00a0\u226520 min before the addition of 100 nM kainate. Baseline (\u226520 min) and oscillatory (30 min) activities were acquired using a 700B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Molecular Devices), low pass Bessel filtered at 3 KHz, and digitized by the Digidata 1440A data acquisition system (Axon Instruments, Molecular Devices). All electrophysiological traces were analyzed using Axograph X software (AxoGraph Scientific). Power spectra were calculated upon Fourier transforms of 10 min epochs (last 10 min of each recording) of recorded field activity. The baseline power spectrum was subtracted from the power spectrum obtained during kainate application. The dominant frequency within 25\u201345 Hz was used to quantify the peak frequency. The power was calculated as the area under the respective peak in the power spectrum. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were performed in <i>Oxtr<sup>+/+</sup></i> and <i>Oxtr<sup>Vn/Vn</sup></i> hippocampal slices at room temperature (22\u00b0C). Slices were prepared and maintained in ACSF under oxygenation with carbogen gas (95% O<sub>2</sub>, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>), as described in the previous paragraph. The holding potential was set at \u221270 mV using an EPSC10 amplifier (HEKA) under the control of the Patchmaster software (HEKA). Miniature post-synaptic currents (mPSCs) were recorded in the presence of 1 \u00b5M TTX from CA1 and CA3 neurons showing the typical morphological properties of pyramidal cells. In addition to TTX, miniature IPSCs (mIPSCs) were recorded in the presence of 10 \u00b5M 6-cyano-7- nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX), and 20 \u00b5M D-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (D-AP5) to block excitatory postsynaptic currents. Miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs) were recorded in the presence of 10 \u00b5M bicuculline methiodide to block inhibitory postsynaptic currents. Two different intracellular solutions were used during mIPSCs and mEPSCs acquisitions. The pipette solution for recording mIPSCs contained 0.4% biocytine, 120 mM potassium gluconate, 20 mM KCl, 10 mM EGTA, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM Na<sub>2</sub>ATP, and 10 HEPES, pH adjusted to 7.28 with KOH, osmolarity adjusted to 315 mOsm/L with sucrose. The pipette solution for recording mEPSCs contained contained 0.4% biocytine, 140 mM KCl, 10 mM EGTA, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM Na<sub>2</sub>ATP, and 10 HEPES, pH adjusted to 7.2 with KOH, osmolarity adjusted to 315 mOsm/L with sucrose. All electrophysiological traces were analyzed using Axograph X software (AxoGraph Scientific) and miniature events were captured using the template matching algorithm provided by the software."

In support of this conclusion, the authors demonstrate that oxytocin treatment of hippocampal autaptic culture during DIV1-3 induces at a later stage (DIV14) decreases in the dendritic complexity and excitatory synaptic transmission in glutamatergic neurons but no changes in inhibitory synaptic transmission in GABAergic neurons. This difference appears to be attributable to low levels of oxytocin receptors in GABAergic neurons as supported by the result that exogenous expression of oxytocin receptors in striatal GABAergic neurons renders oxytocin sensitivity and related changes in synapses/transmission in these neurons. Conversely, in oxytocin receptor-lacking neurons from two different mouse lines, there are increases in dendritic complexity, E-I synapse ratio, and excitatory synaptic transmission."

Reported concentrations of Oxt in extracellular compartments in the brain, CSF, or plasma vary substantially depending on the study at hand. However, it is likely that resting physiological concentrations of Oxt are below 100 nM. In normal, non-pregnant mice and rats, Oxt levels in microdialysates (30 min dialysis at 0.33 microliter/min) from amygdala and hippocampus are in the range of 50-100 pM. However, these values are likely substantially lower than the actual extracellular Oxt concentration. During pregnancy, corresponding Oxt levels in plasma (and hence in the embryos) can increase manifold. As explained in our paper, we chose an Oxt concentration that is actually substantially lower than the concentrations used in other very prominently published papers on Oxt effect on neurons \u2013 100 nM. This concentration was chosen based on the criteria of (i) maximal effect on Oxt receptors (Kd of about 1 nM for Oxt) and (ii) minimal cross-reactivity with V1a receptors (Kd about 20-30 nM for Oxt) (Busnelli et al., 2013, J Pharmacol Exp Ther 346, 318-327). Experts in the specificity titration of Oxt concentrations use the same concentrations for the treatment of hippocampal neurons as we do (Leonzino et al., 2016, Cell Rep 15, 96-103).

However, due to the fact that PI stained not only the nuclei but also the cell bodies, we determined that the PI had leaked outside the nucleus, most likely due to the fixation method employed (see <a href=\"#fig9\">Author response image 1A and 1B</a>). Therefore, we performed a new set of experiments where neurons were incubated with Hoechst 33342 (1 \u03bcg/ml) and propidium iodide (5 \u03bcM) in culture medium for 30 min, directly mounted on glass slides, and imaged for image analysis. Even though in E18 Oxt treated cultures the percentage of PI-positive cells appeared to be slightly reduced as compared to the control group (<a href=\"#fig9\">Author response image 1C</a>), we abstained from following this up further due to the time limitation for resubmission (currently, the data represent two independent cultures prepared from E18 embryos and only one P0 neuronal preparation).
