Only two enzymes - the acyl-protein thioesterases APT1 and APT2 \u2013 are known to catalyze palmitate removal from cytosolic cysteine residues. It is unclear if these enzymes act constitutively on all palmitoylated proteins, or if additional depalmitoylases exist. Using a dual pulse-chase strategy comparing palmitate and protein half-lives, we found knockdown or inhibition of APT1 and APT2 blocked depalmitoylation of Huntingtin, but did not affect palmitate turnover on postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95) or N-Ras. We used activity profiling to identify novel serine hydrolase targets of the APT1/2 inhibitor Palmostatin B, and discovered that a family of uncharacterized ABHD17 proteins can accelerate palmitate turnover on PSD95 and N-Ras. ABHD17 catalytic activity is required for N-Ras depalmitoylation and re-localization to internal cellular membranes. Our findings indicate that the family of depalmitoylation enzymes may be substantially broader than previously believed."

Only two enzymes - the acyl-protein thioesterases APT1 and APT2 \u2013 are known to catalyze palmitate removal from cytosolic cysteine residues. It is unclear if these enzymes act constitutively on all palmitoylated proteins, or if additional depalmitoylases exist. Using a dual pulse-chase strategy comparing palmitate and protein half-lives, we found knockdown or inhibition of APT1 and APT2 blocked depalmitoylation of Huntingtin, but did not affect palmitate turnover on postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95) or N-Ras. We used activity profiling to identify novel serine hydrolase targets of the APT1/2 inhibitor Palmostatin B, and discovered that a family of uncharacterized ABHD17 proteins can accelerate palmitate turnover on PSD95 and N-Ras. ABHD17 catalytic activity is required for N-Ras depalmitoylation and re-localization to internal cellular membranes. Our findings indicate that the family of depalmitoylation enzymes may be substantially broader than previously believed."

A longer-term challenge will be to develop specific chemicals that inhibit ABHD17 activity and test if they are able to reduce the growth of cancer cells."

Reported rates of palmitate turnover on different substrates vary dramatically (<a href=\"#bib28\">Qanbar and Bouvier, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Martin et al., 2011</a>). We used a dual-click chemistry pulse-chase scheme to simultaneously measure palmitate and protein turnover of proteins expressed in COS-7 cells and labeled with the palmitate analogue 17-octadecynoic acid (17-ODYA) and the methionine surrogate L-azidohomoalanine (L-AHA) (<a href=\"#bib25\">Martin and Cravatt, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Zhang et al., 2010</a>). N-Ras had a rapid palmitate turnover as previously reported (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Magee et al., 1987</a>). SNAP25 turned over slowly, whereas the glutamate decarboxylase subunit GAD65 and PSD95 had intermediate rates of depalmitoylation, demonstrating that\u00a0these neuronal proteins undergo palmitate turnover at comparable rates in COS-7 cells or neuronal lines (<a href=\"#bib15\">Greaves and Chamberlain, 2011b</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">El-Husseini et al., 2002</a>). A palmitoylated N-terminal fragment of Huntingtin (N-HTT) implicated in the pathogenesis of Huntington\u2019s disease (<a href=\"#bib41\">Yanai et al., 2006</a>) also showed an intermediate palmitate turnover (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Treatment with the APT1/2 inhibitor PalmB inhibited the depalmitoylation of these substrates without affecting protein turnover (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>). In contrast, we found three proteins identified in a global palmitoyl-proteomics analysis (SPRED2, GOLIM4, and ITM2B) (<a href=\"#bib26\">Martin et al., 2011</a>) did not undergo significant palmitate turnover, suggesting the apparent PalmB-resistant decline in palmitate labeling was due to protein instability (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). These results confirm that proteins have inherently distinct rates of depalmitoylation, potentially reflecting differential recognition by APTs (<a href=\"#bib22\">Lin and Conibear, 2015</a>). In all cases examined, PalmB inhibited the palmitate turnover of dynamically palmitoylated proteins."

In pulse-chase experiments, we found HDFP robustly inhibited the depalmitoylation of N-Ras, PSD95, and N-HTT (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A-C</a>). Because palmitate removal from N-Ras and PSD95 does not require APT1 or APT2, their depalmitoylation may be mediated by a distinct mSH that is a common target of both PalmB and HDFP. To identify overlapping targets, we defined a set of 19 candidate mSHs that showed &gt;25% inhibition by HDFP (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Martin et al., 2011</a>) but excluded known proteases and mSHs with established luminal activity. We added to this list APT1L, which was previously implicated in BK channel depalmitoylation (<a href=\"#bib37\">Tian et al., 2012</a>) but whose HDFP sensitivity was unknown. The PalmB sensitivity of each enzyme was evaluated by a competitive activity-based protein profiling (cABPP) assay, in which binding of an inhibitor occludes the enzyme active site and prevents labeling with the activity probe fluorophosphonate-rhodamine (FP-rho) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Kidd et al., 2001</a>). As expected, PalmB significantly reduced FP-rho labeling of both APT1 and APT2 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E,H</a>). In contrast, it had little effect on the labeling of seven candidates (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F,H</a>), highlighting the distinct substrate specificities of PalmB and HDFP. Four mSHs did not label with FP-Rho due to low activity or expression and could not be assessed (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). Notably, PalmB potently inhibited seven candidates: FASN, PNPLA6, ABHD6, ABHD16A, and ABHD17A/B/C (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G,H</a>). Thus, PalmB has additional serine hydrolase targets beyond APT1 and APT2 that may function as protein depalmitoylases."

ABHD17A knockdown had a slight effect on N-Ras depalmitoylation (p=0.084).

Knockdown was less effective than PalmB treatment, which could be due to activity of the residual ABHD17 enzymes.

Whereas APT1 and APT2 were proposed to act ubiquitously (<a href=\"#bib29\">Rocks et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Vartak et al., 2014</a>), ABHD17-mediated depalmitoylation of N-Ras at the plasma membrane may specifically attenuate oncogenic signaling pathways (<a href=\"#bib36\">Song et al., 2013</a>). ABHD17 proteins are also active in the brain (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bachovchin et al., 2010</a>), where palmitoylated PSD95 regulates AMPA\u00a0(\u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid) receptor nanodomain assemblies linked to synaptic plasticity (<a href=\"#bib12\">Fukata et al., 2013</a>). miRNA-138 targets APT1 to alter dendritic spine size (<a href=\"#bib34\">Siegel et al., 2009</a>), whereas the <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> ABHD17 homologue AHO-3 regulates starvation-induced thermotactic plasticity (<a href=\"#bib27\">Nishio et al., 2012</a>).

As the mSH superfamily consists of &gt;110 members, only half of which are functionally annotated (<a href=\"#bib35\">Simon and Cravatt, 2010</a>), a comprehensively survey the mSH proteome may uncover yet more depalmitoylases.

Using a combination of tagging reagents for palmitoylation (17-ODYA) and protein levels (L-AHA) in pulse chase experiments, the authors investigate various inhibitors of known cytosolic depalmitoylases. They find somewhat surprisingly that Ras, previously believed to be depalmitoylated by APT1 and APT2, is not actually affected by these enzymes. This was shown using both knockdown of these enzymes by RNAi (with nice positive controls) as well as more selective inhibitors of these enzymes than the previously reported PalmB. The evidence directly challenges the prior conclusions that APT1 is the target of palmostatin B mediated inhibition of H/Nras depalmitoylation (Dekker, et al. Nat Chem Biol. 2010 Jun;6(<a href=\"#bib6\">6</a>):449-56), which relied on less robust strategies of acyl-biotin exchange chemistry and indirect surrogates of palmitoylation using fluorescence protein subcellular localization. The authors then search for the real Ras depalmitoylase, using chemoproteomic and overexpression strategies and make a reasonably strong case that ABHD17A is a Ras (and PSD95) depalmitoylase. This is demonstrated by overexpression of wt but not Ser mutant or N-terminal deletion mutant (which mislocalizes) ABHD17A. Overexpression of ABHD17A, ABHD17B, ABHD17C and ABHD6 suggested the first 3 serine hydrolyses could decrease palmitoylation levels of PSD-95. Additional site-directed mutagenesis studies demonstrated that the catalytic residue and plasma membrane localization of ABHD17A was required for depalmitoylation of PSD-95-GFP and EGFP-N-Ras in COS-7 cells. ABHD17A localization and active-site mutation also affected the cellular distribution of EGFP-N-Ras in COS-7 cells. This is interesting work with important implications for the palmitoylation field. The clarity this new evidence provides is essential to guide efforts that will define and potentially interrupt the contribution of protein palmitoylation to Nras driven malignancies including melanoma and leukemias. It is by and large technically strong and innovative, nicely taking advantage of a series of elegant chemical tools most of which were previously reported by Martin and Cravatt. The manuscript in a general sense seems appropriate for <i>eLife</i>, as a short paper, however I do have several concerns that should be considered."

Many prior studies used Palmostatin B as an indirect means to examine APT1 activity on H- and N-Ras in cultured cells, and based on our results, it is likely many effects attributed to APT1 were due to ABHD17. Only a few studies have directly measured Ras palmitoylation after APT1 knockdown or overexpression. Dekker et al. (Nat. Chem. Biol., 2010) reported APT1 knockdown increased steady state palmitoylation of N-Ras by acyl biotin exchange assay (p=0.15), whereas Agudo-Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez et al. (Mol. Cell Biol., 2015) showed overexpression of APT1 significantly reduced steady state [3H]-palmitate labeling of H-Ras (p&lt;0.005). In contrast, we specifically measured depalmitoylation rates using a pulse-chase protocol that detects rapid palmitate turnover. Our results demonstrate that ABHD17 isoforms play a more important role than APT1/2 in regulating dynamic palmitate cycling on specific substrates including N-Ras, but do not preclude a function for APT1/2 in regulating steady-state palmitoylation of H-Ras."
