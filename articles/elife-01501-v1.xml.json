Certain serine codons, the four TCN codons, in the gene for the biofilm repressor SinR caused a lowering of SinR levels under biofilm-inducing conditions. Synonymous substitutions of these TCN codons with AGC or AGT impaired biofilm formation and gene expression. Conversely, switching AGC or AGT to TCN codons upregulated biofilm formation. Genome-wide ribosome profiling showed that ribosome density was higher at UCN codons than at AGC or AGU during biofilm formation. Serine starvation recapitulated the effect of biofilm-inducing conditions on ribosome occupancy and SinR production. As serine is one of the first amino acids to be exhausted at the end of exponential phase growth, reduced translation speed at serine codons may be exploited by other microbes in adapting to stationary phase."

Certain serine codons, the four TCN codons, in the gene for the biofilm repressor SinR caused a lowering of SinR levels under biofilm-inducing conditions. Synonymous substitutions of these TCN codons with AGC or AGT impaired biofilm formation and gene expression. Conversely, switching AGC or AGT to TCN codons upregulated biofilm formation. Genome-wide ribosome profiling showed that ribosome density was higher at UCN codons than at AGC or AGU during biofilm formation. Serine starvation recapitulated the effect of biofilm-inducing conditions on ribosome occupancy and SinR production. As serine is one of the first amino acids to be exhausted at the end of exponential phase growth, reduced translation speed at serine codons may be exploited by other microbes in adapting to stationary phase."

This mechanism relies on codons, the elements within genes that correspond to specific amino acids. Six different codons correspond to the amino acid serine, and the gene for the SinR protein contains above average numbers of four of them. These four codons are highly sensitive to serine levels, and they decrease the levels of the SinR protein when there is less serine in the environment, as happens to be the case in biofilms. And since SinR prevents the production of the carbohydrates and proteins that make up the biofilms, a decrease in the levels of SinR leads to an increase in the production of biofilms."

A wide variety of sensing mechanisms are deployed for this purpose, including dedicated protein sensors, such as histidine kinases, which mediate changes in gene expression by controlling the phosphorylation of cognate response regulators in response to environmental cues (<a href=\"#bib49\">West and Stock, 2001</a>). Bacteria also sense changes in their environment and physiology by means of dedicated RNAs, such as the highly structured, leader RNA for the tryptophan operon, which controls the transcription of downstream genes in the operon by a mechanism involving ribosome stalling at tryptophan codons (<a href=\"#bib18\">Henkin and Yanofsky, 2002</a>). Here we report the discovery of an unusually simple mechanism of environmental sensing involved in the process of biofilm formation by the bacterium <i>B. subtilis</i> that does not require a dedicated RNA or protein."

                        "text": "Biofilm formation involves a switch from planktonic growth as individual cells to the formation of complex, multicellular communities in response to environmental cues (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kolter and Greenberg, 2006</a>). In <i>B. subtilis</i>, these communities are embedded in a self-produced matrix consisting of polysaccharide and an amyloid-like protein, which are specified by the <i>epsA-O</i> and the <i>tapA-sipW-tasA</i> operons, respectively (<a href=\"#bib4\">Branda et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Kearns et al., 2005</a>). The transition to multicellularity is governed in part by four histidine kinases (KinA, KinB, KinC and KinD) that control the phosphorylation of the response regulator, Spo0A, a master regulator of post-exponential phase gene expression (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib22\">Jiang et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Vlamakis et al., 2013</a>). Recent studies suggest that KinA and KinB respond to impaired respiration (<a href=\"#bib25\">Kolodkin-Gal et al., 2013</a>), whereas KinC responds to membrane perturbations and KinD to unknown chemical signals (<a href=\"#bib31\">L\u00f3pez et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Shemesh et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Chen et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Beauregard et al., 2013</a>). Once phosphorylated, Spo0A turns on <i>sinI</i>, a gene encoding a small protein antagonist of the biofilm-specific regulatory protein SinR (<a href=\"#bib34\">Molle et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Kearns et al., 2005</a>). SinR, which is produced constitutively, is a repressor of the matrix operons, <i>epsA-O</i> and the <i>tapA-sipW-tasA</i>, as well as other biofilm-related genes (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kearns et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Chu et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Chai et al., 2009</a>). SinR is also a repressor of the gene for SlrR (<a href=\"#bib12\">Chu et al., 2008</a>), which together with SinR sets up a self-reinforcing, double-negative feedback loop for matrix gene expression (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chai et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Norman et al., 2013</a>). A special feature of SinR of relevance to this investigation is that the expression of matrix genes is hypersensitive to small perturbations in the level of the protein (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chai et al., 2011</a>). This hypersensitivity is attributed to molecular titration of SinR by SinI and cooperativity among SinR molecules bound to tandem target sequences at regulatory sites for the matrix operons (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chai et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Chai et al., 2008</a>)."

This observation prompted us to ask whether switching other serine codons might also influence biofilm formation. Serine is specified by six codons: AGC, AGT, TCA, TCC, TCG and TCT (where T is U in the mRNA). We noticed that the <i>sinR</i> coding sequence has a slightly higher frequency of the four TCN serine codons as compared to the average frequency of TCN codons in the <i>B. subtilis</i> genome (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, p=0.22, N = 12). To test whether this bias towards TCN codons has an effect on biofilm formation, we systematically replaced the three TCA codons in <i>sinR</i> (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) with each of the other five serine codons. Replacing the TCA codons with AGT or AGC resulted in flat, featureless colonies on solid biofilm-inducing medium, indicating severely impaired biofilm formation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). In contrast, replacing the TCA codons with either TCC or TCT had little or no effect on colony morphology whereas switching to TCG increased the wrinkled appearance of the colonies (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>), which is indicative of robust biofilm formation."

Because SlrR cross reacts with the anti-SinR antibodies, we were also able to detect SlrR in our immunoblot analysis. Strikingly, the levels of SlrR were almost perfectly anti-correlated with those of SinR, with the differences in the SlrR protein levels among the <i>sinR</i> synonymous variants being much higher than the corresponding differences in SinR protein levels (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). Because repression by SinR is ultrasensitive to SinR levels (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chai et al., 2011</a>), small differences in SinR protein levels among <i>sinR</i> synonymous variants might be sufficient to cause large differences in the levels of expression of SinR-repressed genes such as <i>slrR</i>. Consistent with this idea, an <i>eps-lacZ</i> transcriptional fusion reporter for the SinR-repressed <i>epsA-O</i> matrix operon showed that the four TCN <i>sinR</i> variants had 3- to 19-fold higher <i>\u03b2</i>-galactosidase activity than the AGT and AGC variants (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>)."

Eight of these variants conformed to the hierarchy described above, namely, the four TCN variants behaved oppositely to the two AGC/AGT variants in colony morphology and in <i>eps-lacZ</i> reporter expression (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). The three variants that did not conform to the hierarchy could potentially reflect alterations to the mRNA sequence context near the mutation rather than the effect of a synonymous substitution per se. Taken together, the above results suggest that serine synonymous codons in the <i>sinR</i> coding sequence have a stereotypical effect on biofilm formation that is primarily determined by the differential usage of the four TCN and the two AGC/AGT codons."

We grew <i>B. subtilis</i> in liquid biofilm-inducing medium, harvested cells either during exponential phase growth (OD<sub>600</sub> = 0<i>.</i>6) or during stationary phase when biofilm formation is induced (OD<sub>600</sub> = 1<i>.</i>4), and performed deep-sequencing of ribosome protected mRNA fragments and size-matched total mRNA fragments. Ribosome profiling yielded 3.75 and 2.55 million sequencing reads aligning to annotated protein-coding sequences for the exponential phase sample and the biofilm entry sample, respectively. The number of reads aligning to a single codon on individual mRNAs was too low for accurate quantification of ribosome density, and was not sufficient to directly detect increased ribosome density on the <i>sinR</i> transcript. However, we reasoned that the global pattern of ribosome density at codons across all mRNAs should reflect the ribosome density on individual transcripts such as <i>sinR</i>. Therefore, we calculated the median ribosome density at each of the 61 sense codons across the 1556 protein-coding sequences in the exponential phase sample and the 1148 sequences in the biofilm entry sample that had an average coverage greater than one sequencing read per codon (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, \u2018Materials and methods\u2019).

By contrast, during biofilm entry, median ribosome density was significantly higher at serine and cysteine codons as compared to the remaining codons (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), suggesting that the translation speed of ribosomes is selectively reduced at these codons during biofilm entry. Notably, the ribosome density at serine codons was not uniform: the four UCN codons had 1.9 to 2.1-fold higher ribosome density whereas the AGC and AGU codons had only 1.1 and 1.3-fold higher ribosome density respectively, relative to the median value across 61 sense codons. Further, this difference in ribosome density between UCN codons and the AGC/AGU codons was essentially identical when computed separately for codons located in the first half or in the second half of each gene (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), a finding that underscores the statistical robustness and the context independence of the observed difference."

Our hypothesis is also supported by the previous observation that synonymous codon usage can have a starvation-specific effect on protein levels (<a href=\"#bib44\">Subramaniam et al., 2013</a>). Further, serine is a precursor metabolite for the biosynthesis of cysteine (<a href=\"#bib16\">Gagnon et al., 1994</a>); hence cysteine depletion was likely the result of a decrease in intracellular serine concentration. Consistent with this hypothesis, we also observed an increase in ribosome density at both serine and cysteine codons during serine starvation of a <i>B. subtilis</i> serine-auxotrophic mutant (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Importantly, serine starvation resulted in an increase in ribosome density at only the four UCN serine codons but not at the AGC and AGU codons, matching the hierarchy seen during biofilm entry (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Serine starvation also resulted in differential levels of production of SinR-YFP protein fusions bearing different synonymous serine codons, whereas serine-rich growth resulted in identical levels of fusion protein production from these variants (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>). Finally, the addition of excess serine or cysteine (but not any of the other 18 amino acids) blocked biofilm formation in wild type cells as judged after 48 hr of growth in biofilm-inducing medium (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, and data not shown)."

Our efforts to measure intracellular serine levels directly during growth in minimal, biofilm-inducing medium (MSgg) have been unsuccessful. Hence, we cannot rule out the less likely possibilities that biofilm entry causes serine and cysteine to be sequestered away from protein synthesis or that aminoacylation rate of the corresponding tRNAs decreases without changes in the intracellular serine and cysteine pools."

Based on our genome-wide measurements of ribosome density, we expect that the translation speed of ribosomes should decrease during biofilm entry not only on the <i>sinR</i> mRNA, but also on other mRNAs that are enriched for any of the four UCN codons. For example, we found that the four TCN codons are over-represented in two nucleotide biosynthesis genes, <i>pyrAA</i> and <i>purB</i> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). These two genes are also transcriptionally down regulated during biofilm entry (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). A high frequency of TCN codons in these genes might serve to reinforce their transcriptional down regulation by reducing translation speed. Conversely, TCN codons are under-represented in the genes encoding lactate dehydrogenase, <i>ldh</i> (<a href=\"#bib39\">Cruz Ramos et al., 2000</a>) and a master regulator of post-exponential phase gene expression, <i>spo0A</i> (<a href=\"#bib34\">Molle et al., 2003</a>) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). The two genes are transcriptionally up regulated upon biofilm entry (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). The low frequency of TCN codons in these genes might represent a mechanism for optimizing the production of their protein products by minimizing the slowing down of translation during biofilm entry. Consistent with this idea, replacement of AGC/AGT codons by TCN codons in <i>spo0A</i>, whose protein product positively regulates biofilm entry (by turning on the synthesis of the SinR antagonist SinI), resulted in defective biofilm formation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>) in contrast to the stimulatory effect of replacing AGC/AGT codons with TCN codons in <i>sinR</i> (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

Serine depletion is sensed through a remarkably simple mechanism based on reduced translation speed at UCN serine codons in the mRNA for a regulatory protein, SinR, whose repressive effects are highly sensitive to small changes in the level of the protein. We presume that UCN codons lower SinR levels simply by slowing the rate of ribosome movement along the mRNA (elongation). However, it is possible that the reduced translation speed at UCN codons during biofilm entry could be followed by downstream events such as ribosome rescue (<a href=\"#bib24\">Keiler et al., 1996</a>) or mRNA decay (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hayes and Sauer, 2003</a>) that might also contribute to lowering the levels of the SinR protein."

The difference in translation speed between the four UCN codons and the two AGC/AGU codons under biofilm-inducing conditions is likely mediated by differences in concentration of the corresponding aminoacylated tRNAs (<a href=\"#bib15\">Elf et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Dittmar et al., 2005</a>), as was recently observed in serine-starved <i>E. coli</i> (<a href=\"#bib44\">Subramaniam et al., 2013</a>). Interestingly, the hierarchy between UCN codons and AGC/AGU codons in <i>B. subtilis</i> during serine starvation is similar to the one in <i>E. coli</i> even though copy numbers of the corresponding tRNA genes have diverged significantly between these two organisms (<a href=\"#bib32\">Lowe and Eddy, 1997</a>). Despite different tRNA gene copy numbers, it is possible that the relative abundances of the serine tRNA isoacceptors are similar between the two organisms or that their relative abundances might be regulated in the same manner in response to nutrient deprivation (<a href=\"#bib14\">Doi et al., 1966</a>)."

Indeed, increased ribosome density has been observed at serine codons during growth of <i>E. coli</i> in Luria-Bertani broth (<a href=\"#bib29\">Li et al., 2012</a>). Thus the role of synonymous serine codons as starvation sensors discovered here in the specific context of biofilm formation might be a general regulatory strategy in microbes for adapting to nutrient depletion at the end of exponential phase growth. It is noteworthy that depletion of specific amino acids affects developmental transitions in several eukaryotic cells (<a href=\"#bib33\">Marin, 1976</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Sundrud et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Wang et al., 2009</a>). It will be interesting to test whether a codon-based sensing mechanism, similar to the one found here in bacterial biofilm development, also plays a role in eukaryotic cells during amino acid depletion."

The defective biofilm phenotype of the <i>\u0394slrR</i> mutant is manifested as an inability to form robust floating pellicles (<a href=\"#bib12\">Chu et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Chai et al., 2010</a>). Briefly, the <i>\u0394slrR</i> strain was inoculated into liquid MSgg medium in 6-well plates and incubated at 30\u00b0C. After 48 hr, pellicle formation was examined visually. In some wells, robust pellicles appeared possibly due to a second, suppressor mutation elsewhere in the genome. Cells from those wells were picked and streaked out on fresh LB agar plates to isolate single colonies. Cells from the single colonies were then tested for altered colony morphology on solid MSgg medium to confirm the suppressor phenotype. Similar genetic screens in previous studies (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kearns et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Chai et al., 2010</a>) had established that mutations in the <i>sinR</i> gene could suppress the defective biofilm phenotype of the <i>\u0394slrR</i> mutant.

For this calculation, 68 genes that had an annotation as \u2018ribosomal\u2019 were used as the reference set of highly expressed genes. The annotations file used for this analysis was downloaded from NCBI (NC_000964.ptt). The p value for the higher frequency of TCN codons in <i>sinR</i> was calculated by assuming a binomial distribution of TCN and AGC/AGT codons. The p value represents the binomial probability that there are 10 or more TCN codons in the <i>sinR</i> gene (12 serine codons total) given the genome-wide frequency of serine codons (0.66 for TCN codons and 0.34 for AGC/AGT codons)."

In this mechanism, the cells sense the decrease in serine and cysteine abundance through changes in the speed of translation of genes that contain certain serine codons. It is noteworthy that these codons are not correlated with the usual codon usage, indicating a possible change in the tRNA levels or in the abundance of codons using them. The manuscript raises intriguing questions about the use of similar mechanisms by other organisms for developmental transitions or when cells are confronted with reductions in the availability of specific amino acids. However, the study would be strengthened if the authors addressed the following comments:"

To avoid misinterpretation by the reader, we now clearly state this limitation in our revised text. Our ribosome profiling measurement did not allow us to robustly infer ribosome pausing at UCN codons on any individual transcript. At best, the selective ribosome pausing at UCN codons was evident only after calculating the median over the 10 transcripts with the highest ribosome density, while the median over the 3 transcripts with the highest ribosome density was significantly affected by noise (see Author response image 1 below). In our ribosome profiling measurement, averaging over the top 10 transcripts resulted in an average read density of \u223c1500 reads per codon. By comparison, the average read density for the <i>sinR</i> transcript was \u223c3 reads per codon. Therefore, we estimate that a \u223c500X higher coverage (implying \u223c2 billion total sequencing reads) is required to robustly detect ribosome pausing on the <i>sinR</i> transcript, which will be a prohibitively expensive experiment. Nevertheless, we are not aware of any experimental evidence or plausible mechanism by which the ribosome pausing at UCN codons that is inferred from a genome-wide median, is likely to be invalid at the level of individual mRNAs such as the <i>sinR</i> transcript. The magnitude of the specific ribosome pauses identified in Ref. 26 relative to the serine-starvation induced pauses observed here is uncertain, making a direct quantitative comparison difficult."

Further, this change was not specific to the four serine-sensitive TCN codons. More generally, protein expression level does not correlate with codon usage even under nutrient-rich conditions. We expect that protein expression during amino acid limitation is determined by the aminoacylated fraction of tRNA isoacceptors cognate to the limiting amino acid. It is worth noting that the aminoacylated fraction of tRNA isoacceptors during amino acid limitation might even be inversely correlated with codon usage. The exact value of this aminoacylated fraction has been hypothesized to depend on the balance between supply and demand for aminoacylated tRNA isoacceptors during protein synthesis."

Specifically, we did not observe decreased transcription of serine biosynthesis genes. Serine also serves as a substrate for a wide range of cellular processes such as for purine biosynthesis, biosynthesis of several amino acids and phospholipid biosynthesis. However, none of these processes were transcriptionally up-regulated upon biofilm entry. In addition, conversion of serine to pyruvate is known to be catalyzed by the SdaA/B enzymes in <i>E. coli</i> upon oxygen limitation. Nevertheless, the homologous <i>B. subtilis</i> enzymes SdaAA/AB were not transcriptionally induced upon biofilm entry. Serine levels are likely regulated by an unidentified metabolic switch that accompanies biofilm entry. Future studies using metabolic labeling with stable isotope tracers could potentially shed light on this metabolic switch. For the sake of clarity, we have added a sentence to our main text that our inability to directly measure intracellular serine levels prevents us from ruling out unlikely possibilities, such as serine sequestration or changes in serine tRNA aminoacylation, which could theoretically occur in the absence of serine starvation."
