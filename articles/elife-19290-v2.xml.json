Using 3D timelapse imaging and computational methods we analyzed the planar cell divisions in ascidian early embryos and found that spindles in every cell tend to align at metaphase in the long length of the apical surface except in cells undergoing unequal cleavage. Furthermore, the invariant and conserved cleavage pattern of ascidian embryos was found to consist in alternate planar cell divisions between ectoderm and endomesoderm. In order to test the importance of alternate cell divisions we manipulated zygotic transcription induced by \u03b2-catenin or downregulated wee1 activity, both of which abolish this cell cycle asynchrony. Crucially, abolishing cell cycle asynchrony consistently disrupted the spindle orienting mechanism underpinning the invariant cleavage pattern. Our results demonstrate how an evolutionary conserved cell cycle asynchrony maintains the invariant cleavage pattern driving morphogenesis of the ascidian blastula."

Using 3D timelapse imaging and computational methods we analyzed the planar cell divisions in ascidian early embryos and found that spindles in every cell tend to align at metaphase in the long length of the apical surface except in cells undergoing unequal cleavage. Furthermore, the invariant and conserved cleavage pattern of ascidian embryos was found to consist in alternate planar cell divisions between ectoderm and endomesoderm. In order to test the importance of alternate cell divisions we manipulated zygotic transcription induced by \u03b2-catenin or downregulated wee1 activity, both of which abolish this cell cycle asynchrony. Crucially, abolishing cell cycle asynchrony consistently disrupted the spindle orienting mechanism underpinning the invariant cleavage pattern. Our results demonstrate how an evolutionary conserved cell cycle asynchrony maintains the invariant cleavage pattern driving morphogenesis of the ascidian blastula."

These embryos consist of a small number of cells that divide according to an \u201cinvariant cleavage pattern\u201d, which means that the positioning and timing of the cell divisions is identical between different individuals of the same species. The pattern of cell division is also largely the same across different ascidian species, which raises questions about how it is controlled."

Invertebrate chordate embryos of the ascidian display a similar fate map to other chordates even though their blastulae are composed of only 64 cells rather than several thousand cells typical of other chordates (<a href=\"#bib12\">Kourakis and Smith, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Lemaire et al., 2008</a>). Due to its conserved fate map yet small cell number, the ascidian embryo is an ideal system to elucidate mechanisms underpinning cell positioning during morphogenesis of a chordate blastula. Because ascidian embryos display an invariant cleavage pattern with no cell migration or cell death up to the time of gastrulation, cell division plane orientation is important for pattern formation (<a href=\"#bib19\">McDougall et al., 2015</a>). In addition, although the invariant-cleavage pattern displayed by asicidian embryos is specific to ascidians, the lophotrochozoa also display stereotyped spiral cleavage patterns that may employ similar rules as the ones we address here in the ascidian (<a href=\"#bib35\">Rabinowitz and Lambert, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Brun-Usan et al., 2017</a>). All blastomeres are fate restricted in the 64 cell ascidian blastula and most cell divisions at the 32 cell stage are fate segregating asymmetric divisions (<a href=\"#bib16\">Lemaire et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Lemaire, 2009</a>). Such fate-segregating asymmetric cell divisions rely on precisely regulated cell divisions partitioning maternal determinants (muscle lineage) or allowing local cell-cell contacts for polarised inductive cell fate specification e.g. neural lineage induction (<a href=\"#bib13\">Kumano and Nishida, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Lemaire, 2009</a>)."

The overall invariant temporal and spatial pattern of cell divisions in ascidians is even conserved between distantly-related species. Ascidians are split into three orders that diverged more than 350 millions years ago (aplousobranch, phlebobranch and stolidobranch), and it has been estimated that non-coding DNA sequences from two distinct ascidian species can be as different from each other as fish are from mammals (<a href=\"#bib43\">Stolfi et al., 2014</a>). Distantly-related species of ascidian also show the same relative cell cycle asynchrony since the 24 cell stage embryo is common to both phlebobranch (<i>Ciona/Phallusia</i>) and stolidobranch (<i>Halocynthia/Styela</i>) ascidians. In <i>Phallusia</i> this cell cycle asynchrony is induced by a GRN dependent upon nuclear accumulation of \u03b2-catenin in six vegetal cells of the 16 cell stage embryo (<a href=\"#bib6\">Dumollard et al., 2013</a>). How such stereotyped cell cycle asynchrony has been conserved in distantly-related ascidians is presently unknown, but it is interesting to note that \u03b2-catenin becomes nuclear in vegetal blastomeres in both <i>Ciona</i> and <i>Halocynthia</i> embryos at the 16 cell stage (<a href=\"#bib11\">Kawai et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Hudson et al., 2013</a>)."

                        "text": "Mitotic spindles align relative to a number of cues that display a competitive hierarchal relationship with one another. For example, an underlying mechanism known as the long-axis rule based upon microtubule behavior and motors (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib22\">Minc and Piel, 2012</a>) causes animal cell to divide orthogonal to their long axis as was noted more than a century ago by Hertwig (<a href=\"#bib8\">Hertwig, 1893</a>). This geometric long-axis rule can be altered by cortical polarity cues such as lateral junctions (<a href=\"#bib25\">Nakajima et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Ragkousi and Gibson, 2014</a>) or the apical cortex in asymmetrically dividing <i>Drosophila</i> neuroblasts (<a href=\"#bib42\">Siller and Doe, 2009</a>). During planar cell divisions in epithelia and endothelia, a lateral belt of LGN/NuMA coupled with the exclusion of LGN/NuMA from the apical cortex causes planar spindle orientation (<a href=\"#bib51\">Zheng et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Morin and Bella\u00efche, 2011</a>). After acquiring a planar orientation the spindle rotates in the apical plane to find its final position at metaphase. Spindle orientation in the apical plane will set cell position in the epithelium and is regulated by apical cell shape (<a href=\"#bib36\">Ragkousi and Gibson, 2014</a>). Because of mitotic cell rounding in cultured cells and some epithelia, apical cell shape at metaphase may become completely round (<a href=\"#bib15\">Lancaster and Baum, 2014</a>). In these cells, the spindle aligns with the long axis of the cell during interphase which is memorized during mitotic cell rounding via retraction fibers in cultured cells (<a href=\"#bib47\">Th\u00e9ry and Bornens, 2008</a>) or LGN/NuMA-rich tricellular junctions in <i>Drosophila</i> epithelia (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bosveld et al., 2016</a>). Alternatively, mitotic cell rounding is less pronounced in the squamous epithelia such as the enveloping cell layer (EVL) of Zebrafish gastrulae which maintain a long axis at metaphase to orient the mitotic spindle (<a href=\"#bib3\">Campinho et al., 2013</a>). Mitotic cell rounding does not seem to occur in the <i>Xenopus</i> blastula (<a href=\"#bib44\">Strauss et al., 2006</a>) and remains poorly documented in blastulae of other species (<a href=\"#bib50\">Xiong et al., 2014</a>). A computational approach revealed very recently that the first 4 cell divisions in ascidian embryos may follow a geometric rule in a similar manner to early <i>Xenopus</i>, Zebrafish or sea urchin embryos (<a href=\"#bib32\">Pierre et al., 2016</a>). Major cell shape changes have been noted during the 32\u201344 cell stage in ascidian (<i>Ciona</i>) embryos (<a href=\"#bib46\">Tassy et al., 2006</a>) suggesting that mitotic cell rounding may occur in cells of the ascidian blastula. However, the impact of cell cycle asynchrony or mitotic cell rounding on mitotic spindle orientation in cells of the ascidian blastula have not been studied so far."

In order to determine if mitotic spindles aligned with the cells longest length in the apical plane we extracted the apical plane of every blastomere and assessed with a 2D computational model whether geometry of the apical surface can regulate spindle orientation in the apical plane to set cell positioning. Finally, since both phlebobranch and stolidobranch ascidians display a 24 cell stage indicating that cell cycle asynchrony begins at the 16 cell stage, we assessed what impact reducing this cell cycle asynchrony has on spindle orientation and the invariant cleavage pattern. We perturbed the GRN driving this cell cycle asynchrony to create quasi-synchronous cell cycles and determined the impact on spindle orientation in the apical plane. In this study we provide evidence that spindles align parallel to the apical surface and along the longest length of the apical surface of the blastomeres. We also show that the invariant cleavage pattern is disrupted when the asynchronous cell cycles are made more synchronous."

At the 64 cell stage all cells of the ascidian blastula face the outside of the embryo (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) suggesting that all cell divisions are parallel to the apical surface and that embryonic cleavage proceeds through planar cell divisions to generate the ascidian blastula. In unstretched epithelia (and in early embryos) daughter cells divide orthogonally to the mitotic orientation of their mother cell reflected in one cell generating a square of 4 cells upon two planar cell divisions (<a href=\"#bib49\">Wyatt et al., 2015</a>). Cell division is said to be oriented (called oriented cell division: OCD) when daughter cells divide in the same orientation as their mother (Strome, 1993; <a href=\"#bib45\">Wyatt et al., 2015</a>). By analysing the pattern of 4 grand-daughter cells generated by two successive cell divisions from the 16 cell stage in <i>Phallusia embryos</i> (see <a href=\"#bib19\">McDougall et al., 2015</a>for details) we found that some blastomeres do not divide orthogonally to their mother. <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> shows a virtual <i>Phallusia mammillata</i> embryo (<a href=\"#bib46\">Tassy et al., 2006</a>) with color-coded lineages. When following two successive cell divisions from the 16 cell stage it can be observed at the 64 cell stage that some groups of 4 grand-daughters form a square pattern (lineages b5.3, b5.4 and A5.2 shown in blue and pink, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) suggesting that two cell divisions orthogonal to each other occurred. In contrast, the grand-daughters of B5.1, B5.2 and a5.3 (brown) form a T pattern suggesting that the spindle of one of the two daughter cells is in the same orientation as the spindle of its mother (indicating OCD in this cell). Finally the grand-daughters of A5.1 and a5.4 (orange) form a line indicating that two OCDs occurred in these lineages (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A and B</a>, see also <a href=\"#bib19\">McDougall et al., 2015</a>). Using this strategy we could identify three cells undergoing OCD (asterisks in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) at the 16\u201324 cell stage (a5.3; a5.4; B5.2) and seven cells at the 32\u201344 cell stage (A6.1; A6.2; a6.6; a6.7; a6.8; B6.2 and B6.3). Strikingly the square, T and linear patterns observed at the 64 cell stage are perfectly conserved in <i>Styela partita</i> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>) and <i>Ciona intestinalis</i> (<a href=\"#bib19\">McDougall et al., 2015</a>), showing that the pattern of planar cell divisions in early ascidian embryos may be perfectly conserved."

Using the outline of cells (in red), the computational model outputs a predicted spindle position and orientation (blue circles joined by a green line) which do not change between prophase and anaphase (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). By comparing the angle between the observed and predicted spindle orientations (orienting deviation) it can be observed that at prophase/prometaphase (i.e., before spindle rotation), apical cell geometry poorly predicts spindle orientation in a6.6 and a6.8 (orienting deviation: 61.0\u00b0 in a6.6 and 47.0\u00b0 in a6.8) whereas apical cell geometry predicts reliably spindle position in b6.8 (orienting deviation: 14.7\u00b0). In contrast, at metaphase, all observed spindles show an orienting deviation of less than 20\u00b0 indicating that apical cell shape predicts reliably spindle orientation in the apical plane (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). These observations suggest that mitotic spindles in a6.6 and a6.8 are not aligned with the long length of the cell in the apical plane at prophase and they rotate during mitosis to align with the long length of the cell\u2019s apical surface at metaphase.

Both treatments reduced drastically cell adhesion from the 2 cell stage resulting in rounder blastomeres. Spindle orientation did not seem affected during the mitosis from 2 to 4 cell stage (data not shown) and 4 cell stage embryos with reduced cell adhesion show no blastomere positional changes as they are still made by a single layer of 4 cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B and C</a>). However, the invariant cleavage pattern is affected in these embryos during the 4 to 8 cell mitosis which normally creates 2 layers of 4 animal and four vegetal (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B and C</a>). For example, downregulating cell adhesion causes embryonic morphologies at the 8 cell stage ranging from wild type patterns (2 layers of 4 cells) to one layer of 8 cells with all intermediate patterns (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B and C</a>). Computational analysis of the cell divisions occurring in the plane of imaging revealed a good prediction of spindle positioning by the computational mode (orienting deviation: 9,64\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.16\u00b0 in DA-aPKC expressing embryos, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>) suggesting that cell shape still regulates spindle orientation in these cells.

Defining the apical plane of an irregular polyhedral shape created by living cells is challenging since 2D imaging provides inherently false information as mitotic spindles in three dimensional embryos rarely align within the imaging plane. We therefore performed confocal 3D + time lapse imaging of living ascidian embryos stained with Cell Mask Orange (Invitrogen) to monitor cell membranes and spindle poles at metaphase in all blastomeres (see <a href=\"#bib19\">McDougall et al., 2015</a> for a detailed protocol). The apical plane of each blastomere (defined as the 2D plane containing the poles of the mitotic spindle which can separate most of the apical surface from the basolateral surface) was systematically extracted from 3D-rendered blastomeres using Imaris software following a specific protocol (see Materials and methods and <a href=\"#bib19\">McDougall et al., 2015</a>) for detailed protocols) and the position of the mitotic spindle in the extracted 2D plane was compared with the position of a mitotic spindle predicted by the computational model (<a href=\"#bib21\">Minc et al., 2011</a>)."

Sphericity of each blastomere was determined using Imaris statistics (see Materials and methods) to estimate the complexity of polyhedral shape of in silico isolated blastomeres. Sphericity of blastomeres at metaphase was found to be significantly different from a round standard from the 4 cell stage and was particularly pronounced at the 16\u201324 and 32\u201344 cell stages during which spindle rotations occur (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). At the 32 cell stage, in silico isolated blastomeres were found to be columnar during interphase and to flatten along the apical direction at metaphase (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>) without significantly changing cell volume (data not shown). This was reflected in an increase in the average sphericity of blastomeres at metaphase indicating that, at this stage, blastomeres partially round up at mitosis (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). We then segmented manually apical (red) from basolateral (green) membranes on each 3D-rendered blastomere and calculated the apical surface ratio (apical surface divided by total surface) and found that a large increase in apical surface area accompanies mitotic cell rounding (from 0,15\u20130,23 at interphase to 0,42\u20130,56 at metaphase, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>) similarly to what is observed in differentiated epithelia (<a href=\"#bib36\">Ragkousi and Gibson, 2014</a>). These observations document partial mitotic cell rounding at the sixth cell cycle which results in blastomeres increasing their apical surface by apical expansion at prophase and metaphase. Therefore the apical surface ratio is a better quantitative measure of cell shape changes than sphericity as some cell shape changes observed from a columnar cell (with a small apical surface) to a \u2018brick\u2019 shaped cell (with a larger apical surface) are not associated with changes in sphericity."

The cell outline drawn from the 2D extracted apical plane of each blastomere was then computed to predict spindle orientation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a> shows the observed and predicted spindle positions in the extracted apical plane of each blastomere from the fourth mitosis (8\u201316 cell) to the sixth mitosis (32-44-64 cell) and reveals a good prediction of spindle orientation by apical cell shape in almost all blastomeres. Quantification of the deviation between the predicted center of spindles and the observed center of spindles (centering deviation) from the 2 cell stage to the 44 cell stage confirms that all spindles are centered within 20% except for the B4.1 and B6.3 blastomeres of the germ cell lineage which undergo CAB-dependant unequal cleavages (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Strikingly we found that orienting deviation is under 30\u00b0 in all cells except in B5.2/B6.3 and A6.3 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). By comparing the orienting deviation observed in 149 cell divisions (excluding the germ cell precursors that divide unequally) to randomly generated angles between 0 and 90\u00b0 we found that the distribution of observed orienting deviations is non uniform and significantly different from a random distribution (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). In our data set, 88% of cells show an orienting deviation of 30\u00b0 or less, 78% of cells have an orienting deviation under 20\u00b0 and 52% of cells show an orienting deviation of less than 10\u00b0 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Therefore our model robustly predicts that spindle aligns with the long length of the apical surface in most cells with a precision of 30\u00b0 and 20\u00b0. In contrast spindle orientation could not be predicted reliably in B5.2, B6.3 and A6.3 blastomeres (i. e. orienting deviation is above 30\u00b0) suggesting that in these three blastomeres apical cell shape does not regulate spindle positioning in the apical plane. This was expected in B5.2 and B6.3 which display spindle rotation during unequal cleavage (<a href=\"#bib33\">Prodon et al., 2010</a>), but not in A6.3 which do not show spindle rotation nor unequal cleavage. However A6.3 cells undergo an asymmetric division segregating endoderm and mesoderm fates driven by asymmetric Ephrin and MAPK signalling (<a href=\"#bib40\">Shi and Levine, 2008</a>) suggesting that, like in the germ lineage, cues other than apical cell shape might regulate spindle orientation in A6.3 blastomeres."

(2013)</a> for details on the effects of PEM1 ectopic expression) or by blocking \u03b2-catenin transactivation using DN-Tcf (which does not affect non transcriptional functions of \u03b2-catenin, see <a href=\"#bib6\">Dumollard et al., 2013</a> for details). Embryo morphology at 16 cell stage and CAB-dependant unequal cleavages are maintained in embryos expressing Pem1 ectopically as shown previously (<a href=\"#bib26\">Negishi et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Kumano et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Dumollard et al., 2013</a>). However, all mitotic spindle rotations previously observed at the 16 and 32 cell stages are strongly impaired in Pem1 and DN-Tcf expressing embryos resulting in cell divisions with different orientation from the invariant cleavage pattern (termed \u2018misoriented cell divisions\u2019) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). Most strikingly linear and T patterns of two sister cell spindles at the 32-44-64-cell mitosis were often replaced by two parallel spindles (giving rise to square pattern of cells) in these embryos (outlined in red in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Counting the occurrence of misoriented cell divisions in embryos expressing Pem1 or DN-Tcf (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>) shows that the blastomeres undergoing spindle rotation displayed more occurrence of misoriented cell divisions (a5.3, b5.3, A6.1, A6.2, a6.6, a6.7, a6.8 marked with an asterisk in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). b6.5 and b6.6 blastomeres also showed a strong incidence of misoriented cell divisions but as a consequence of their mother (b5.3) being misoriented. The shape of the apical surface appears altered both in Pem1 and DN-Tcf expressing embryos and computational analysis of cell divisions in a6.8 (normally displaying spindle rotation) shows that misoriented cell divisions are still predicted reliably by apical cell shape (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Therefore the processes supporting spindle orientation in the long length of the cell in the apical plane are maintained in these embryos and misoriented cell divisions are probably due to altered cell shape in manipulated embryos."

Wee1 maternal RNAs are present in the unfertilized oocyte in Phallusia mammillata (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>, see also RNA-seq data in Aniseed database: <a href=\"http://www.aniseed.cnrs.fr/\">http://www.aniseed.cnrs.fr/</a> with Gene Id: phmamm.CG.MTP2014.S423.g08568) where it is enriched in the vegetal cortex. Then maternal Wee1 transcripts can be observed in the CAB similarly to PEM-type genes (<a href=\"#bib34\">Prodon et al., 2007</a>). Zygotic Wee1 transcripts first appear at late 32 cell stage in the endoderm lineage (64\u201376-stage) just before these cells invaginate. After the onset of gastrulation (112 cell stage) Wee1 transcripts are expressed in mesodermal cells just before they invaginate (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). We modified Wee1 activity in the whole embryo (see Materials and methods, <a href=\"#bib24\">Murakami et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Farrell and O'Farrell, 2014</a>) and found, as anticipated, that Wee1 inhibition speeded up the slow cell cycle in the ectoderm at the 16 cell stage without affecting the cell cycle duration of the vegetal endomesoderm thereby eliminating the transient 24 cell stage (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). At the 32 cell stage, cell cycle asynchrony between ectoderm (animal) and endomesoderm (vegetal) was 6\u20138 min in Wee1-manipulated embryos compared to 15 min in control embryos (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). Analysis of cell division orientation at the 16\u201324 and 32\u201344 cell stages in Wee1-manipulated embryos revealed deviations from the invariant cleavage pattern as well as variability between individuals (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A and B</a>). In synchronized embryos, misoriented cell divisions are particularly obvious at the 32\u201364 cell stage where the linear arrangements of A6.1/A6.2 and a6.8/a6.7 daughter cells observed in control embryos were changed to square arrangements of cells (circled in red in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). Counting the occurrence of misoriented cell divisions revealed that the blastomeres b5.3, A6.1, A6.2, a6.7 and a6.8 were the most affected (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>). The orientation of cell division in b6.5 and b6.6 was also affected (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>). Therefore the blastomeres most affected by synchronization were the ones displaying oriented cell division (b5.3, A6.1, A6.2, a6.7 and a6.8) or daughters of cells displaying OCD (ie b6.5, b6.6). Apical surface area at metaphase was altered in Wee1-manipulated embryos and misoriented cell divisions in a6.8 blastomeres still aligned with the long length of the apical surface (orienting deviation: 10.17 \u00b1 4.15\u00b0, <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>). Therefore, inhibition of cell cycle asynchrony did not seem to disrupt the mechanisms supporting spindle orientation in the apical plane and misoriented cell divisions may rather be due to altered apical surface area."

In the absence of either cell migration or death, cell division orientation thus defines the precise topographical positioning of all cells in the whole blastula-stage embryo. Moreover, these precise cell positions are invariant between distantly-related species of ascidian. We find here that a small number of maternal factors and gene-regulatory networks (GRN) influence the final position of cells in early ascidian embryos. One maternal mechanism is provided by the CAB which influences the shape of all cells in the embryo indirectly since its ablation causes embryos to become radialized (hence affecting the shape of all cells in the embryo). One zygotic GRN that influences cell position is controlled by \u03b2-catenin which induces cell cycle asynchrony from the 16 cell stage to fine-tune cell position at the 24-32-44 cell stages. Finally, one additional maternal cue is provided by the polarisation of the cells which occurs during cleavage divisions and causes mitotic spindles to align parrallel to the apical cell surface. All of these cues/inputs are likely propagated between the cells of the embryo through cell adhesion and the resulting adhesive forces balanced with physical forces such as surface tension giving rise to the particular cell shapes observed. In particular, we report here that it is the long axis of the cell in the apical plane that is important for creating the invariant cleavage pattern."

We demonstrate here for the first time that a partial mitotic cell rounding accompanies cell division in the ascidian blastula whereas it was not observed in Xenopus (<a href=\"#bib44\">Strauss et al., 2006</a>) and is still not clearly documented in Zebrafish (<a href=\"#bib50\">Xiong et al., 2014</a>). Interestingly, in these two species, cell deformations have been observed at MBT but only in isolated blastomeres (called \u2018cell motility\u2019 in <a href=\"#bib28\">Newport and Kirschner, 1982</a> and <a href=\"#bib10\">Kane and Kimmel, 1993</a>). However, even though the isolated blastomeres with the longest cell cycle showed more pronounced cell deformations, cell cycle dependence of such cell deformations remains unclear. Mirror-like cell shape changes in 32\u201344 cell stage ascidian embryos were noted previously (<a href=\"#bib46\">Tassy et al., 2006</a>), prompting us to test the idea that cell cycle asynchrony may be involved in the mirror-like cell shape regulation. We demonstrate here that these cell shape changes consist in cell rounding and apical expansion during mitosis and they correspond to the mitotic cell rounding observed in epithelial cells (<a href=\"#bib36\">Ragkousi and Gibson, 2014</a>). In contrast to cells in differentiated Drosophila epithelia which completely round up at mitosis (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bosveld et al., 2016</a>) but similarly to the epibolizing enveloping cell layer (EVL) of Zebrafish embryos (<a href=\"#bib3\">Campinho et al., 2013</a>), mitotic cell rounding in the ascidian blastula is incomplete. In consequence, blastomeres at the 16\u201324 and 32\u201344 cell stage do not become completely round and the shape of the apical surface remains anisotropic during metaphase."

These observations strongly indicate that mitotic spindles align with the long axis of the cell in the apical plane to implement the invariant cleavage pattern of planar cell division thus creating the distinctive topographical organization of cells in the ascidian blastula. In the ascidian blastula such a general geometric rule is overridden only in the germ lineage where a maternally derived cortical polarity complex (the CAB) attracts one spindle pole duing unequal cell division (<a href=\"#bib33\">Prodon et al., 2010</a>). It would be interesting to extend this mathematical analysis to other developmental stages and to distantly-related ascidian species, since we may have unveiled a conserved apical cell shape dependent mechanism underpining the invariant cleavage pattern displayed by all ascidians."

By imaging spindles during mitosis in these cells we discovered that they all perform OCD through spindle rotation rather than migration/rotation of the nucleo-centrosomal complex. A6.1 is the only exception to this observation where it is the nucleo-centrosomal complex rather than the spindle that rotates, but OCD in this lineage still depends on apical cell shape (see <a href=\"#bib27\">Negishi and Yasuo, 2015</a> for details). Thus we argue that, together with apico-basal polarity which likely enforces the planar orientation of cell division, apical cell shape is a major driver of cell positioning in the ascidian blastula. This hypothesis implies that apical cell shape at metaphase must be very stereotyped and conserved in ascidian early embryos. Although perhaps surprising, this finding should be considered with the fact that cell position in ascidian embryos at the 64 cell stage is crucial since it is at this time that the fate map is established (<a href=\"#bib17\">Lemaire, 2009</a>). More specifically, precise cell position in the anterior part of the embryo determines the number of animal marginal cells (a6.5, b6.5) that will receive a local cell induction from contacting vegetal cells to create a neural ectoderm of 6 cells at the 64 cell stage (<a href=\"#bib17\">Lemaire, 2009</a>). Mesodermal cells of the vegetal hemisphere located in the marginal region segregate, during mitosis 32\u201344 cell, neural and notochord fates in the anterior part of the embryo (A6.1, A6.2) and muscle and mesenchyme (B6.2) fates in the posterior part of the embryo (<a href=\"#bib13\">Kumano and Nishida, 2007</a>). Therefore, the invariant cleavage pattern and oriented cell divisions might be part of the mechanism enforcing fate segregation in the ascidian blastula."

We suggest that cell cycle asynchrony impacts the spatial pattern of planar cell divisions by regulating the shape of the cell\u2019s apical surface at metaphase. First, we found that every mitotic spindle tends to align with the long length of the cell\u2019s apical plane at metaphase. Second, abolishing the asynchrony that causes the appearance of the 24 cell stage altered the invariant cleavage pattern. Third, misoriented cell divisions in synchronized embryos are still reliably predicted by apical cell shape."

We conclude that overall cell cycle duration is not important, and rather it is the asynchrony between the animal and vegetal halves of the embryo that is crucial. Since ascidian embryos live in a marine environment that does not have a constant temperature, absolute cell cycle duration is likely less important than the cell cycle asynchrony which is maintained over a range of tempartures in different species of ascidian. Therefore the zygotic GRN driven by nuclear \u03b2-catenin that patterns germ layers is also responsible for causing cell cycle asynchrony, which in turn enforces the invariant cleavage pattern through cell shape dependent mitotic spindle orientation in the apical plane at the 16-32-44-cell stages."

It was found in Ciona embryos that \u2018between the early 32-cell stage and the mid 44-cell stage, the elongation factors of opposing animal and vegetal cells change in precisely opposite manner with time\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib46\">Tassy et al., 2006</a>). We hypothesize that such mirror behaviors between animal and vegetal blastomeres is brought about by asynchronous mitotic cell rounding between animal and vegetal blastomeres. Precise shape of the apical surface during mitosis may be a function of not only adhesion with neighbouring cells but also of the remaining adhesion between interphasic and mitotic cells in opposite hemispheres since during cell division in ascidians the adhesion between blastomeres remains. We found that apical cell shape was altered in animal cells when we slowed down the cell cycle of vegetal cells with DN-TCF or PEM1 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). Likewise, we report that apical cell shape was altered in vegetal blastomeres when we speeded up the cell cycle of animal cells by inhibiting Wee1 (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). We therefore conclude that the shape of the apical surface of animal cells is affected by the cell cycle state of the vegetal cells, and likewise that the shape of the apical surface of vegetal cells is affected by the cell cycle state of the animal cells. It is interesting to note that the overall cell cycle asynchrony between the animal and vegetal cells is about 15 min. which is about the duration of M phase. We wonder whether this may be one of the selective pressures leading to the retention of the cell cycle asynchrony between distantly-related ascidians. Indeed, both phlebobranchs and stolidobranchs ascidians display nuclear \u03b2-catenin in vegetal cells at the 16 cell stage (Ciona: <a href=\"#bib9\">Hudson et al. (2013)</a>, Halocynthia: <a href=\"#bib11\">Kawai et al., 2007</a>), and it is a GRN controlled by \u03b2-catenin that causes cell cycle asynchrony starting at the 16 cell stage (<a href=\"#bib6\">Dumollard et al., 2013</a>). It will therefore be interesting to elucidate the entire GRN that controls cell cycle duration in the ascidian at the 16\u201324 cell stage, and to determine how conserved that GRN is between distantly-related ascidian species."

Unequal cleavage of the two vegetal posterior blastomeres at the 16 cell stage thus affects the shape of every cell in the early embryo. Such effect of unequal cleavage on cell division of distant cells is supported by cell adhesion-dependant mechanical coupling between blastomeres which was found to be necessary to maintain the invariant cleavage pattern. It is noteworthy that regulated apicobasal polarity is crucial to maintain cell adhesion in the ascidian embryo to propagate individual cell deformations to the rest of the embryo and implement the invariant cleavage pattern."

Further studies will be required to understand how the apical surface of every blastomere is interdependent on neighboring cells due to packing constraints. Such interdependence between cell division plane orientation and apical cell shape is involved in a number of morphological processes. In vertebrate embryos oriented tissue strain generated by the gastrulating mesoderm determines the global axis of planar polarity in the Xenopus ectoderm (<a href=\"#bib4\">Chien et al., 2015</a>), while cell division is oriented by tissue tension in the Zebrafish ectoderm to improve epithelial spreading over the yolk layer during epiboly (<a href=\"#bib3\">Campinho et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Xiong et al., 2014</a>). In ascidian blastulae, we hypothesize that the shape of cells in mitosis is a function of the tension generated between the dividing cells and their neighboring interphasic cells coupled with the tension between the cells that are dividing. This may exert stereotyped deformations of adhering mitotic cells to generate the invariant cleavage pattern. However, further studies are needed to assess whether global tissue tension deforms blastomeres of the ascidian embryo or whether, on the contrary, autonomous cell cycle-driven cell shape changes are transmitted in the embryo via cell adhesion."

The model assays all possible orientations in the 2D shape and computes the evolution of the torque with spindle orientation, which informs on the mechanical equilibrium corresponding to stable spindle orientation. To implement the model with the current study, the outline of the cells and the experimental positions of the spindle poles were drawn manually as inputs. The script returned the difference between the centers of observed and predicted spindles (computed as a \u2018centering deviation\u2019 in %) and the difference in angle orientation between predicted and observed spindles (computed as an \u2018orienting deviation\u2019 in degrees (\u00b0)).

The authors show that cleavage asynchrony is important for the shape of the embryo. They show this affects the shape of individual blastomeres. They contend that the orientation of cell division is controlled by cell shape, and show that when disrupted the development of the embryo (and hence setting up fated cell territories) goes awry."

While data from cultured cells etc show this is a reasonable assumption, the data presented here only show a correlation between cell shape and spindle orientation. It is equally possible that both are determined by some other parameter (e.g. something similar happens in the ascidian germ line lineage where the CAB directs the division axis, as the authors consider and discuss)."

I could not find clear statement about this point in the text. In the same section, the authors mentioned that the blastomeres exhibited misoriented cleavages. How are the cell division misoriented? I think the description here is somewhat vague and clearer explanation may be necessary. In addition, if the effect is particularly seen in cells that display spindle rotation in normal embryos (as stated in paragraph four of that section), there might be a mechanism other than Hertwig's rule to determine the orientation of spindle in these cells."

What are the effect of the treatment on mitosis?

As both proteins are also involved in cellular functions other than controlling gene expression, this is not necessarily the case. Ideally, inhibition of zygotic transcription with pharmaceutical drugs, Actinomycin D or \u03b1-amanitin would be recommended. For example, in subsection \u201cMaternal and zygotic contributions to the stereotyped pattern of cell divisions.\u201d, fourth paragraph: the use of Pem1 for disrupting transcription of proteins may be problematic in this experiment, because Pem1 is a regulator of spindle position in Ciona (Negishi et al., 2007)."

It is more likely that cell division orientation is under a dual control: 1) apico-basal polarity specifies the orientation of the plane of division; 2) 2D cell geometry within this plane then constrains the orientation of cell division. This model departs from Hertwig's rule and appears quite different from the authors' proposal. Thus, the authors should remove the rigid statements that the ascidian's cleavage obeys the Hertwig's rule. The manuscript should be rewritten to indicate that cleavage orientation is determined by the shape (the longest axis) of the blastomeres along the observed plane."

This rule is respected when embryo morphology is altered by compression or ablation of a structure previously shown to orient divisions, the Contraction Pole. 2) The asynchrony of animal vs vegetal cell divisions is crucial for the precise oriented cell divisions, as observed by preventing the asynchrony through \u03b2-catenin or wee1 loss of function. In these experiments radical changes in both cell shape and planar division orientation are observed."

The study identifies and quantifies interesting phenomena (some of which have previously been qualitatively described, e.g. cell rounding at mitosis, Tassy et al., 2006, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), but does not provide deep mechanistic insights. Authors present potentially interesting quantitative analyses of the evolution of mean cell shape during ascidians development, of spindle rotation at a specific stage, of mitotic cell rounding and apical expansion at metaphase in WT and perturbed embryos. The causal links between these different parameters are, however, not always clear and robust and the message thus lacks impact and depth. The two main messages, respect of Hertwig's rule and direct causal relationship between cell cycle timing, cell shape and orientation of cell divisions are insufficiently supported."

This \"long axis rule\" is thus applicable to the 3D geometry of cells. Minc and colleagues (Cell, 2011) could use a 2D model of the process in Urchin eggs, because the height of the microfabricated wells used to constrain egg shape was smaller than the diameter of the egg, thereby making sure that the long axis of the cell was included in the analyzed plane. In the current study, the authors focus on planes perpendicular to the apico-basal axis of the cells, although the long axis of the cell may not be included in these planes. <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> illustrates indeed that the long axis of most cells at metaphase is unlikely to lie in the plane of division (e.g. <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a> A6.3, a6.6). The author's conclusion that cell division orientation follows the \"long axis\" rule thus appears to be an oversimplification. It is more likely that cell division orientation is under a dual control: 1) apico-basal polarity specifies the orientation of the plane of division; 2) 2D cell geometry within this plane then constrains the orientation of cell division. This model departs from Hertwig's rule and appears quite different from the authors' proposal. <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a> may be consistent with the notion that when apico-basal polarity is affected, spindle orientation deviates from the expected plane (though the choice to perform the 2D analysis on the specific plane extracted in red appears quite arbitrary)."

In <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a> control 8-cell, the extracted plane does not seem to follow the manual extraction rules presented in McDougall et al. (Methods Cell Biol 2015) as the apico-basal axis is included in \u2013 or close to \u2013 the selected plane. It is not clear how robust, reproducible and rigorous this manual method is. To avoid arbitrary choices, an automated method would be preferable. An analysis of the robustness of the model to changes in the definition of the plane would also help. It should also be said that the choice of the plane is not solely determined by the geometry of cell shape: the apico-basal position of the spindle is also taken into account."

The demonstration that affecting wee1 activity causes a speeding up of animal cell divisions and leads to changes in the orientation of cell divisions is interesting, but the analysis of these experiments remains too superficial. A likely explanation of the phenotype is that a change in the timing of cell divisions affects the shape of both animal and vegetal cells at metaphase and that this causes changes in their division orientation. The authors do not, however, analyze the shape of cells at metaphase following these perturbations, nor do they run their model to predict the new division axis."

Minc and colleagues (Cell, 2011) could use a 2D model of the process in Urchin eggs, because the height of the microfabricated wells used to constrain egg shape was smaller than the diameter of the egg, thereby making sure that the long axis of the cell was included in the analyzed plane.

Here in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a> 149 cell divisions from the 2 to the 44-cell stage are represented (not including the unequal cell divisions in B4.1/B5.2/B6.3). This graph shows that 88% of analysed cell divisions are accurately predicted to be regulated by cell shape with a threshold of 30\u00b0. If setting a threshold of 20\u00b0, 78% of equal cell divisions are predicted to be regulated by cell shape. Even with a 10\u00b0 threshold for than 50% of all equal cell divisions were accurately predicted by our model. We also performed a Kolgomorov-Smirnov test to show that the distribution of orienting deviations found in these 149 equal cell divisions are significantly different from a random distribution of angles."

In our data set, 88% of cells show an orienting deviation of 30\u00b0 or less, 78% of cells have an orienting deviation under 20\u00b0 and 52% of cells show an orienting deviation of less than 10\u00b0 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Therefore our model robustly predicts that spindle aligns with the long length of the apical surface in most cells with a precision of 30\u00b0 and 20\u00b0. In contrast spindle orientation could not be predicted reliably in B5.2, B6.3 and A6.3 blastomeres (i. e. orienting deviation is above 30\u00b0) suggesting that in these three blastomeres apical cell shape does not regulate spindle positioning in the apical plane.\u201d"
