                    "text": "The 26S proteasome is responsible for the selective, ATP-dependent degradation of polyubiquitinated cellular proteins. Removal of ubiquitin chains from targeted substrates at the proteasome is a prerequisite for substrate processing and is accomplished by Rpn11, a deubiquitinase within the \u2018lid\u2019 sub-complex. Prior to the lid\u2019s incorporation into the proteasome, Rpn11 deubiquitinase activity is inhibited to prevent unwarranted deubiquitination of polyubiquitinated proteins. Here we present the atomic model of the isolated lid sub-complex, as determined by cryo-electron microscopy at 3.5 \u00c5 resolution, revealing how Rpn11 is inhibited through its interaction with a neighboring lid subunit, Rpn5. Through mutagenesis of specific residues, we describe the network of interactions that are required to stabilize this inhibited state. These results provide significant insight into the intricate mechanisms of proteasome assembly, outlining the substantial conformational rearrangements that occur during incorporation of the lid into the 26S holoenzyme, which ultimately activates the deubiquitinase for substrate degradation."

Removal of ubiquitin chains from targeted substrates at the proteasome is a prerequisite for substrate processing and is accomplished by Rpn11, a deubiquitinase within the \u2018lid\u2019 sub-complex. Prior to the lid\u2019s incorporation into the proteasome, Rpn11 deubiquitinase activity is inhibited to prevent unwarranted deubiquitination of polyubiquitinated proteins. Here we present the atomic model of the isolated lid sub-complex, as determined by cryo-electron microscopy at 3.5 \u00c5 resolution, revealing how Rpn11 is inhibited through its interaction with a neighboring lid subunit, Rpn5. Through mutagenesis of specific residues, we describe the network of interactions that are required to stabilize this inhibited state. These results provide significant insight into the intricate mechanisms of proteasome assembly, outlining the substantial conformational rearrangements that occur during incorporation of the lid into the 26S holoenzyme, which ultimately activates the deubiquitinase for substrate degradation."

Proteins targeted for degradation are covalently labeled with polyubiquitin chains, which are recognized and removed by the proteasome (<a href=\"#bib12\">Finley, 2009</a>). The barrel-shaped core peptidase complex of the proteasome, which sequesters the proteolytic active sites in an internal chamber (<a href=\"#bib16\">Groll et al., 1997</a>), is capped on one or both ends by a regulatory particle that acts as a discriminating gateway for targeted protein substrates (<a href=\"#bib30\">Saeki and Tanaka, 2012</a>). The regulatory particle consists of two sub-complexes, known as the \u2018base\u2019 and the \u2018lid\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib14\">Glickman et al., 1998</a>). The base sub-complex contains the AAA+ ATPases Rpt1-Rpt6, which form a heterohexameric ring that drives the mechanical substrate unfolding and translocation of the unstructured polypeptides into the degradation chamber of the core peptidase. Docked on one side of the base is the lid subcomplex, which contains the deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) Rpn11 that cleaves polyubiquitin chains from targeted substrates as an essential step in proteasomal substrate processing (<a href=\"#bib4\">Boehringer et al., 2012</a>)."

At the center of the lid, six <b>P</b>roteasome-<b>C</b>SN-e<b>I</b>F3 (PCI)-domain containing subunits (Rpn3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 12) interact via their winged-helix motifs to form a horseshoe-shaped scaffold. The amino-terminal domains of these 6 subunits extend radially like fingers from the central PCI horseshoe. The essential deubiquitinase Rpn11 is positioned in the \u2018palm\u2019 of the hand-shaped lid. Rpn11 is an <b>M</b>pr1-<b>P</b>ad1\u00a0<b>N</b>-terminal (MPN)-domain containing metalloprotease of the <b>JA</b>B1/<b>M</b>PN/<b>M</b>OV34 (JAMM) family and forms a heterodimer with an enzymatically inactive MPN-subunit, Rpn8.

The Rpn11/Rpn8 heterodimer is active in isolation\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib40\">Worden et al., 2014</a>), but is significantly inhibited in the context of the lid sub-complex and regains robust DUB activity in the assembled 26S proteasome\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib38\">Verma et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Yao and Cohen, 2002</a>). The isolated Rpn11/Rpn8 heterodimer is not present at considerable levels in the cell, whereas the presence of the lid and its assembly intermediates containing Rpn11/Rpn8 have been previously observed and characterized (<a href=\"#bib35\">Tomko and Hochstrasser, 2011</a>). The inhibition of Rpn11 activity in the isolated lid and its assembly intermediates might therefore be important to prevent spurious deubiquitination of proteins in the cell, given the high promiscuity of this DUB. It has been suggested that interactions with Rpn5 are possibly involved in Rpn11 inhibition in the isolated lid (<a href=\"#bib21\">Lander et al., 2012</a>), but the specifics of this regulation and the mechanism by which Rpn11 is activated upon incorporation into the holoenzyme remain elusive (<a href=\"#bib38\">Verma et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Lander et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Yao and Cohen, 2002</a>)."

The N-terminal portions of the PCI-domain containing subunits progressively decrease in resolution as they extend toward the periphery of the complex, likely due to intrinsic flexibility (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplements 3C</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s5\">5</a>). The 3D reconstructions of the fully assembled lid and the lid lacking Rpn12 (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>, top row, third reconstruction) show that the N-terminal portions of Rpn6 and Rpn5 are fully extended, and the MPN heterodimer and helical bundle adopt identical orientations in both structures. These findings contradict a recent crosslinking study (<a href=\"#bib36\">Tomko et al., 2015</a>) suggesting that incorporation of Rpn12 during lid assembly induces a large-scale rearrangement of the MPN dimer and the transition of the N-terminal portion of Rpn6 from an inward-folded state to an extended conformation that allows binding to the base. Further structural studies will therefore be required to better understand how Rpn12 incorporation affects lid binding to the base and core subcomplexes."

This organization was also observed in the crystal structure of CSN, although the PCI horseshoe assembly of the isolated lid has a wider and steeper spiral (<a href=\"#fig1s6\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 6</a>). Recently, a similar succession of \u03b2-strands was shown for the PCI domains in eIF3 (<a href=\"#bib7\">des Georges et al., 2015</a>), but its domain organization is significantly more open and deviates from the spiral configuration observed in the proteasome lid and CSN (<a href=\"#fig1s6\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 6</a>). The significant conformational differences between the horseshoes of the lid, CSN, and eIF3 indicate that the PCI-domain assembly allows for substantial flexibility, while simultaneously serving as an organizational scaffold at the center of the complex."

Our cryoEM reconstruction contains sufficient structural detail to generate a complete atomic model of this helical bundle, providing an accurate depiction of the extensive inter-helical interactions. Furthermore, we were able to precisely assign the register of several helices that could not be unambiguously positioned in earlier lower-resolution models of this bundle (<a href=\"#bib2\">Beck et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Unverdorben et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Estrin et al., 2013</a>). Our structure shows that Rpn8 and Rpn11 are the only subunits that contribute multiple helices to the bundle and together contact all other subunits within the helical assembly. Notably, Rpn8 is the largest contributor to the bundle, which is consistent with previous biochemical work showing that the Rpn8 C-terminal helices are more critical for lid assembly than those of other subunits (<a href=\"#bib10\">Estrin et al., 2013</a>). The PCI horseshoe and MPN heterodimer are individually tethered to the bundle via short loops, but make only few direct surface contacts with the bundle. The cryoEM map also shows that the bundle\u2019s position in the isolated lid is likely stabilized by interactions between \u03b1-helix 5 (residues 186\u2013215) of Rpn8 and the PCI domain of Rpn9 at one end of the bundle, and between the C-terminus of Rpn6 and the N-terminus of Rpn3 at the opposite end (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s7\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 7</a>)."

The 2D and 3D analyses of the wild type particles show that the MPN heterodimer is closely associated with the Rpn5 and Rpn9 subunits (top row). The mutants, however, show that the while overall organization of the PCI-containing subunits are preserved, the MPN dimer is released from its position in the palm of the lid sub-complex. In the 2D class averages, the detached MPN dimer can be identified as an additional density that is not observed in the WT class average (indicated by a yellow arrow). In the 3D reconstructions, the WT structure shows the MPN dimer (green and red) are connected to Rpn5 (blue) and Rpn9 (purple). The density corresponding to the dimer in all the mutants is clearly detached from Rpn5 and Rpn9. The MPN dimer within the Rpn5\u00a0(Y273A) (bottom row) had such an increased level of flexibility, that the dimer itself is poorly resolved."

Importantly, the N-terminal region of \u03b1-helix 13 in Rpn5 (residues 275\u2013285) is nestled against the end of Rpn11\u2019s catalytic groove, with several residues from Rpn5 directly contacting loops that surround Rpn11\u2019s catalytic Zn<sup>2+</sup> ion (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). To test the functional importance of these contacts, we generated Rpn5-mutated lid variants and compared their ubiquitin-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (Ub-AMC) cleavage rate with that of wild-type lid and the isolated Rpn11/Rpn8 dimer. Under our assay conditions, Rpn11 activity within the isolated lid is 5-fold lower compared to the free Rpn11/Rpn8 dimer. In the loop preceding \u03b1-helix 13 of Rpn5, Tyr273 is in an orientation that enables hydrophobic interactions with Rpn11 Phe114, located in a loop near the active site (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Mutation of this Rpn5 residue (Y273A) increased Rpn11 activity to 61% of the isolated Rpn11/Rpn8 dimer (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D\u2013E</a>), suggesting that Tyr273 aids in stabilizing Rpn11 in its inhibited conformation."

Structural analysis of the lid containing the Rpn5\u00a0(Y273A) or the Rpn5\u00a0(H282A,K283A) double-mutant by negative-stain EM shows that the Rpn11/Rpn8 heterodimer is released from its inhibitory conformation, while the overall organization of the PCI-containing subunits is identical to that of the isolated wild-type lid complex (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

In Rpn11, Ins-1 is required for catalysis and has been proposed to play a structural role in DUB activity by engaging and positioning the C-terminus of the ubiquitin substrate for hydrolysis (<a href=\"#bib40\">Worden et al., 2014</a>). Flexibility of this loop suggests that it may regulate access to the DUB active site by switching between different conformational states. Upon ubiquitin binding to Rpn11, the Ins-1 loop may first open up to allow the ubiquitin C-terminus to enter the catalytic groove and then switch to a conformation that stabilizes the isopeptide bond for hydrolysis. Structures of the isolated Rpn11/Rpn8 dimer show the Ins-1 loop in a \u2018closed\u2019 conformation (<a href=\"#bib40\">Worden et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Pathare et al., 2014</a>), which is also observed in EM reconstructions of proteasomes that are actively processing a protein substrate (<a href=\"#bib37\">Unverdorben et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Matyskiela et al., 2013</a>). Interestingly, in the context of the isolated lid, the Ins-1 loop appears to be locked in this closed state through interactions with the neighboring Rpn5 subunit (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2B</a>, <a href=\"#fig3\">3B</a>). In particular, the amino group of Rpn5 Lys283 interacts with the Ser74 carbonyl of Ins-1 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>), and introducing the Rpn5 K283A mutation in the isolated lid results in a significant increase in Rpn11 DUB activity, as indicated above."

These data suggest that the Ins-1 loop is locked in a closed conformation through contact with neighboring residues and is unable to switch to the \u2018open\u2019 state required for substrate access to the active site.

To visualize these rearrangements, we compared the atomic coordinates of the isolated lid sub-complex to the previously determined pseudo-atomic model of the lid in the context of the assembled proteasome (PDB ID: 4CR2)\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib37\">Unverdorben et al., 2014</a>) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> and <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). Lid binding to the base and core sub-complexes causes the PCI horseshoe to constrict, decreasing in radius by ~3\u2009\u00c5, and adopt a more planar conformation that closely resembles the reported architecture of the CSN (<a href=\"#bib24\">Lingaraju et al., 2014</a>) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s6\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 6</a>). As a result, Rpn3, Rpn7 and Rpn12, comprising one half of the PCI horseshoe, undergo considerable rotation toward the center of the regulatory particle, where Rpn3 and Rpn12 bind the scaffolding subunit Rpn2, while Rpn7 contacts the AAA+ ATPase subunits Rpt3 and Rpt6. By comparison, the other half of the PCI horseshoe, consisting of Rpn9, Rpn5 and Rpn6, goes through a much less pronounced conformational change. The N-terminal \u03b1-solenoid domain of Rpn9 extends toward the N-terminal coiled coil of Rpt4 and Rpt5, generating the binding site for the ubiquitin receptor Rpn10, and the highly flexible TPR segment of Rpn5 becomes stabilized through contact with the ATPase ring and the core peptidase. The N-terminal \u03b1-solenoid domain of Rpn6 also accommodates interactions with the ATPase ring and core peptidase by rotating ~34\u00ba\u00b0 around its long axis (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

That the association between these two components is maintained during lid incorporation suggests that movement of the Rpn3/7/12 unit influences the positioning of the bundle (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> and <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). The final orientation of the helical bundle within the regulatory particle is likely also dictated by an extensive interaction between \u03b1-helix 6 of Rpn11 (residues 263\u2013272) and the N-terminal domain ring of the ATPase subunits in the base (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

                                "text": "The most pronounced conformational rearrangement of the lid involves the Rpn11/Rpn8 MPN-domain heterodimer. Upon lid incorporation, the Rpn11/Rpn8 dimer undergoes a dramatic 90\u00ba\u00b0 rotation, moving from its inhibited state in the palm of the isolated lid to a highly extended conformation over the central substrate-translocation channel in the 26S holoenzyme (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). The inhibited conformation of the Rpn11/Rpn8 heterodimer in the isolated lid appears to be metastable, as mutations in either the Rpn5 or Rpn9 contact surfaces lead to release of the dimer. In fact, the extended conformation of the Rpn11/Rpn8 dimer in the proteasome is similar to its conformation in our DUB-activating lid mutants (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). During lid incorporation, it is likely that the conformational changes occurring in the PCI subunits upon their interactions with the core and base distort the Rpn11-Rpn5 and Rpn8-Rpn9 contact sites and release the Rpn11/Rpn8 dimer from its inhibited state. To assess the extent of Rpn11 activation upon lid incorporation, we compared Ub-AMC hydrolysis activity for Rpn11 in the isolated lid versus the assembled 26S proteasome. Incorporation of wild-type lid stimulated Rpn11 DUB activity to 150% of the isolated Rpn11/Rpn8 dimer levels. This hyperstimulation of Rpn11 in the proteasome may originate from an alternative Ins-1 loop conformation that is stabilized by the neighboring Rpt4/Rpt5 coiled coil. Rpn11 activity in lid sub-complexes that contain Rpn5 (Y273A), Rpn5 (N275A), or Rpn8 (K86A,K88A) mutations was also stimulated upon proteasome incorporation, although to a lower level than with the wild-type lid (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). None of the mutations are involved in interfaces between subunits in the proteasome holoenzyme, and we speculate that the slightly lower DUB activity of the reconstituted mutant proteasomes originates from an interference with normal lid incorporation due to a prematurely released MPN dimer. Interestingly, lid sub-complexes where Rpn11 lacked Ins-2 were completely deficient in Rpn11 stimulation upon incorporation into holoenzyme (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3C</a>), even though Rpn11 activity was unaffected by Ins-2 deletion in the isolated lid (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). The Ins-2 region of Rpn11 is known to interact with the scaffolding subunit Rpn2 of the base and likely stabilizes the Rpn11/Rpn8 dimer in the extended conformation."

This extended conformation enables the Rpn11 Ins-2 loop to interact with Rpn2, which likely aids in positioning the DUB active site above the entrance to the AAA+ ATPase ring for highly regulated deubiquitination of protein substrates during translocation."

While earlier structural and biochemical work described the role of the lid scaffold in positioning Rpn11 and facilitating its activity in the context of the assembled proteasome holoenzyme, we illustrate here how interactions of the Rpn11/Rpn8 dimer with other lid subunits block premature DUB activity in the unincorporated lid assembly. Our atomic model of the isolated lid subcomplex showcases the dramatic conformational gymnastics undergone by this important component of the proteasome during incorporation into the regulatory particle and, while the molecular communication involved in promoting this massive reorganization is still an active area of structural and biochemical research, our work here has resolved an important mystery surrounding DUB inhibition and activation during proteasome assembly."

Individual particle motion trajectories were estimated using a running average window of 7 frames and particle translations were limited using a prior with a standard deviation of 1. Particle movements were fit to a linear trajectory using a running average window of 7 frames, with an inter-particle distance contribution value set to 300 pixels. Per-frame B-factors and intercepts were estimated by comparing the reconstructed half-maps from individual frames to the full-frame half maps, and the spatial frequency contribution from each frame weighted according (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D, E</a>). A new stack of particles was generated from the translationally aligned particles extracted from the weighted frames, which provided a reconstruction at 4.1\u2009\u00c5 resolution."

This 3D classification was performed using the alignments from the 3D refinement, without further alignment of particles. One of the 3D classes resulting from this analysis clearly exhibited higher resolution details than the other two, and the 109,396 particles contained in this class were further refined (in the absence of a mask) to achieve a 3.6\u2009\u00c5 structure. The same soft-edged 3D mask that was used for the previous 3D classification was then used for continued 3D refinement, which improved the structural details of the region contained within this mask, and increased the resolution to 3.5\u2009\u00c5 resolution."

The 26 S proteasome mediates the ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis of many regulatory and unfolded proteins. It plays essential roles in virtually all biological processes. Thus structural and mechanistic studies of this large and highly complex macromolecular assembly are extremely important. The main interest of the free lid sub-complex is to see how it compares to the structure of the lid in the context of the mature 26S proteasome, which is known from previous near-atomic resolution cryo-EM structures. Most significantly, the structure helps to rationalize why the Rpn11 ubiquitin isopeptidase is nearly inactive in the free lid as a result of conformational and steric obstruction of the Rpn11 active site, especially by the N-terminal domain of Rpn5. This is supported by mutational and enzymatic activity analyses."
