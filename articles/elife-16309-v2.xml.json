Mammalian TRIM5\u03b1 proteins are restriction factors and receptors that target the capsid cores of retroviruses and activate ubiquitin-dependent antiviral responses upon capsid recognition. Here, we report crystallographic and functional studies of the TRIM5\u03b1 B-box 2 domain, which mediates higher-order assembly of TRIM5 proteins. The B-box can form both dimers and trimers, and the trimers can link multiple TRIM5\u03b1 proteins into a hexagonal net that matches the lattice arrangement of capsid subunits and enables avid capsid binding. Two modes of conformational flexibility allow TRIM5\u03b1 to accommodate the variable curvature of retroviral capsids. B-box mediated interactions also modulate TRIM5\u03b1\u2019s E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, by stereochemically restricting how the N-terminal RING domain can dimerize. Overall, these studies define important molecular details of cellular recognition of retroviruses, and how recognition links to downstream processes to disable the virus."

Mammalian TRIM5\u03b1 proteins are restriction factors and receptors that target the capsid cores of retroviruses and activate ubiquitin-dependent antiviral responses upon capsid recognition. Here, we report crystallographic and functional studies of the TRIM5\u03b1 B-box 2 domain, which mediates higher-order assembly of TRIM5 proteins. The B-box can form both dimers and trimers, and the trimers can link multiple TRIM5\u03b1 proteins into a hexagonal net that matches the lattice arrangement of capsid subunits and enables avid capsid binding. Two modes of conformational flexibility allow TRIM5\u03b1 to accommodate the variable curvature of retroviral capsids. B-box mediated interactions also modulate TRIM5\u03b1\u2019s E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, by stereochemically restricting how the N-terminal RING domain can dimerize. Overall, these studies define important molecular details of cellular recognition of retroviruses, and how recognition links to downstream processes to disable the virus."

The mechanism of restriction is not yet fully understood, but is primarily associated with premature termination of reverse transcription and accelerated dissociation of the viral core (<a href=\"#bib41\">Sayah et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Stremlau et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">2006</a>). TRIM5\u03b1 is also proposed to be a pattern recognition receptor for retroviral capsids, in that it initiates a signaling cascade to induce type I interferon upon capsid binding (<a href=\"#bib33\">Pertel et al., 2011</a>). Ubiquitin (Ub) is implicated in both the antiviral (restriction) and signaling activities of TRIM5\u03b1. In particular, TRIM5\u03b1\u2019s E3 ligase activity creates K63-linked polyUb chains. Although the functional target or targets of ubiquitination have not been established definitively, TRIM5\u03b1 self-ligation correlates with the block in reverse transcription (<a href=\"#bib7\">Campbell et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Fletcher et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Roa et al., 2012</a>), whereas unanchored chains have been proposed to mediate interferon signaling (<a href=\"#bib33\">Pertel et al., 2011</a>)."

The B-box 2 and coiled-coil domains make an integrated antiparallel dimer fold (<a href=\"#bib18\">Goldstone et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Sanchez et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Weinert et al., 2015</a>), which acts as a scaffold that organizes the upstream and downstream domains (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). In TRIM5\u03b1, the C-terminal domain is a \u03b2-sandwich fold called SPRY (or PRYSPRY/B30.2), which mediates direct binding to retroviral capsids (<a href=\"#bib5\">Biris et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Diaz-Griffero et al., 2006b</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Kovalskyy and Ivanov, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Sawyer et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Sayah et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Sebastian and Luban, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Stremlau et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Yang et al., 2012</a>). The L2 linker that connects the SPRY domain to the coiled-coil packs against the coiled-coil scaffold, and so in the TRIM5\u03b1 dimer, two SPRY domains are oriented to bind the capsid simultaneously (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib18\">Goldstone et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Li et al., 2014</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib39\">Sanchez et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Weinert et al., 2015</a>). Capsid recognition by TRIM5\u03b1 is an avidity-driven interaction; that is, productive binding only occurs in context of assembled capsid and assembled TRIM5\u03b1 (<a href=\"#bib43\">Sebastian and Luban, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Stremlau et al., 2006</a>). Higher-order assembly of TRIM5\u03b1 requires the B-box 2 domain, which is thought to mediate three-fold symmetric interactions that connect coiled-coil mediated TRIM5\u03b1 dimers into a hexagonal net (<a href=\"#bib11\">Diaz-Griffero et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Ganser-Pornillos et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Javanbakht et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Li and Sodroski, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Li et al., 2016</a>). This hexagonal scaffold is proposed to position the SPRY domains to match the orientations \u2013 both translational and rotational \u2013 of their corresponding binding epitopes on retroviral capsids, and thereby generate powerful avidity effects that amplify very weak (millimolar level (<a href=\"#bib4\">Biris et al., 2013</a>)) intrinsic affinities between the SPRY and capsid subunits."

A segment of the L1 linker forms a 4-helix bundle that mediates dimerization of the RING domain, which is required for productive interactions with Ub-conjugated E2 enzymes and formation of the catalytically active Ub ligation complex (<a href=\"#bib50\">Yudina et al., 2015</a>). Although the B-box 2 domain does not appear to have a direct role in catalysis, B-box/B-box interactions are expected to cluster their associated RING domains and promote RING dimerization. In context of the TRIM hexagonal lattice, the apparent juxtaposition of three-way head-to-head interactions between the B-boxes and two-way interactions between the catalytic RING domains is suggested to facilitate TRIM5\u03b1 self-ubiquitination (<a href=\"#bib50\">Yudina et al., 2015</a>)."

Analysis of the isolated B-box 2 domain has been likewise problematic, because separating the B-box from the coiled-coil exposes a 'backside' hydrophobic surface that makes it prone to aggregation. We therefore engineered artificial constructs \u2013 which we call miniTRIMs \u2013 that retain the integrated B-box/coiled-coil fold of the full-length dimer but are more amenable to biochemical and structural analyses. These novel reagents allowed us to define the molecular details of how the B-box 2 domain facilitates higher-order assembly of TRIM5\u03b1, and how pattern recognition of retroviral capsids is coupled to ubiquitin-dependent downstream processes."

A P2<sub>1</sub>2<sub>1</sub>2<sub>1</sub> crystal contained two trimers in the asymmetric unit (3.26\u2009\u00c5 resolution, <i>R/R</i><sub>free</sub> = 0.26/0.30), a C2 form contained one dimer (2.1\u2009\u00c5, <i>R/R</i><sub>free</sub> = 0.18/0.22), and a P1 form contained two dimers (2.3\u2009\u00c5, <i>R/R</i><sub>free</sub> = 0.22/0.26) (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a> and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1A</a>). Altogether, these yielded 12 crystallographically independent views of Bcc miniTRIM. All 12 structures were very similar to each other (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), and a complete structure is shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>. In general, electron densities for the B-box 2 domains and proximal regions of the coiled-coil domains were well defined (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), whereas densities for the hairpin linker were of poorer quality or, in some cases, missing (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). (Densities in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B\u00a0and\u00a0C</a>\u00a0are illustrated with a trimer subunit.) Thus, our structures are of high quality at the functionally relevant regions, even though the artificial linker displayed significant disorder in some cases and may not be optimally designed. Our 12 Bcc miniTRIM structures superimpose very well with the crystal structure of the TRIM5\u03b1 B-box 2/coiled-coil dimer (PDB 4TN3) (<a href=\"#bib18\">Goldstone et al., 2014</a>) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D\u2013F</a> and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1B</a>). This indicates that our miniTRIM constructs are excellent structural surrogates for the B-box/coiled-coil core of the full RBCC motif."

As expected, the trimerization interactions are principally mediated by the B-box domain, burying 578 \u00c5<sup>2</sup> of the available surface area from each subunit. This result indicates that the three-fold vertexes of the TRIM5\u03b1 hexagonal lattice are made by B-box trimers. The B-box packs against the N-terminal end of the coiled-coil helix through a hydrophobic interface (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, asterisks), suggesting that trimer formation requires the presence of the coiled-coil. This observation is consistent with the idea that higher-order assembly into a hexagonal lattice is a function of the integrated tripartite motif of TRIM5\u03b1, and does not simply arise from combining otherwise independent self-association motifs."

In both oligomers, these indole sidechains make a hydrophobic core surrounded by a collar of close packed leucine sidechains (Leu105, Leu106, Leu118, and Leu132). The third, bottom layers also consist of a ring of salt bridges, this time with Glu120 and Arg121 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F,L</a>). At the periphery of this layer, the sidechain hydroxyl of Thr30 donates a hydrogen bond to Glu120. Interactions between the layers consist of a hydrogen bond between Glu102 (top) and the indole amide of Trp117 (middle), and close packing between the Trp117 sidechain (middle) and the Arg121 sidechain guanidinium group (bottom) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,I</a>).

Another distinction is that the first two turns of the coiled-coil helix are overwound and bent in the dimer form (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), which might indicate some structural communication between the interacting B-boxes and the coiled-coil domain."

In order to avoid possible contributions from proximity-induced RING/RING interactions, we focused on the Bcc miniTRIM construct. We first analyzed Bcc miniTRIM by using sedimentation equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) at three different loading concentrations and three rotor speeds, and the combined data set was fit globally. In control experiments, both the W117E and R121E Bcc miniTRIM mutants were monomeric, in agreement with the structures (not shown), whereas the wildtype (WT) Bcc distributions indicated self-association (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Global fitting of the WT equilibrium distributions to a monomer-dimer-trimer model only returned stable values for the monomer-dimer dissociation constant (1\u2009\u03bcM). Indeed, the AUC data gave a satisfactory fit to a monomer-dimer equilibrium model, indicating that trimers (or higher-order oligomers than dimers) were disfavored in solution. To determine whether higher-order oligomers would form at higher protein concentrations, we also analyzed the Bcc miniTRIM at 0.9\u2009mM by using analytical size exclusion chromatography with multi-angle light scattering (SEC-MALS). The mass trace (blue curve in <a href=\"#fig3s4\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 4</a>) had a sharp peak at the leading edge of the protein absorbance peak (black curve), a curved plateau in the central region above the expected mass for a dimer, and tapered towards the expected monomer mass at the tail. This again indicated dynamic equilibrium between monomer and dimer states, and that higher-order species were also present in the main peak, but at a much smaller fraction than dimers. Thus, the Bcc miniTRIM was predominantly dimeric in solution."

Published AUC analysis of freshly purified full-length TRIM5 did not show evidence of B-box mediated self-association, even at a loading concentration that is six-fold higher than our measured miniTRIM dimerization affinity (<a href=\"#bib25\">Langelier et al., 2008</a>). Uncoupling of the B-box from the full coiled-coil and RING domains therefore appears to have amplified its propensity for oligomerization. Another difference is that, upon incubation, full-length TRIM5\u03b1 has a clear propensity to assemble into hexagonal arrays \u2013 and by inference, three-way B-box/B-box interactions \u2013 even at low \u03bcM concentrations (<a href=\"#bib17\">Ganser-Pornillos et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Li et al., 2016</a>; and this study). Since the miniTRIMs lack an intact coiled-coil, extended incubation did not result in lattice formation but only produced higher molecular weight aggregates (not shown). Our interpretation of all of these observations is that artificial uncoupling of the B-box 2 domain from the full coiled-coil and RING domains has stabilized the B-box dimer form. In context of the full-length protein, assembly cooperativity drives the B-box into the trimer form, and so the B-box dimer might represent an intermediate state that can incorporate an additional B-box domain to form the trimer. Consistent with this interpretation, our structures indicate that the Bcc miniTRIM dimers can open slightly like a clam shell, which we imagine can lead to a wider opening and provide access to a third subunit (<a href=\"#fig3s5\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). We note that this interpretation does not preclude a functional role for a B-box dimer. For example, it is possible that B-box dimerization might be a mechanism to promote RING dimerization and E3 ligase activation. Nevertheless, it seems clear that the B-box trimer is what facilitates hexagonal lattice assembly, at least in vitro."

Charge reversal mutations in the top layer of interactions (E102K, K103E, E102K/K103E) diminished restriction activity (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), confirming that this ring of salt bridges has an appreciable contribution to higher-order TRIM5\u03b1 assembly.

Interestingly, however, the W117A mutant still harbored some restriction activity, most likely because the hydrophobic layer remains stabilized by an outer ring of leucines. As with Trp117, alanine substitution mutants for Leu118 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>) and Leu132 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>) had measurable restriction activity, whereas aspartate substitutions were more significantly disruptive. Of the remaining two leucines, L105A had full activity and L106A did not restrict HIV-1 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>). These results are again consistent with the structures since Leu105 is only partially buried, whereas Leu106 is completely buried within both the dimer and trimer interfaces. Interestingly, we found that steady state expression levels of the TRIM5\u03b1 B-box 2 domain mutants varied considerably, as noted previously (<a href=\"#bib9\">Diaz-Griffero et al., 2007</a>), and that furthermore there was an inverse correlation between the steady state expression levels of the mutant proteins and restriction activity (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>). The best expressing mutants (e.g., W117E and R121E) did not restrict HIV, whereas the lowest expressing mutant (L105A) had WT-like restriction activity. The expression levels also inversely correlated with in vitro assembly efficiency \u2013 W117E and R121E did not assemble, whereas L105A assembled efficiently (<a href=\"#bib17\">Ganser-Pornillos et al., 2011</a>; also see below). We therefore speculate that the ability to assemble reduces steady state protein levels because TRIM5\u03b1 proteins that assemble are turned over more rapidly in cells. An extension of this argument is that the ability of TRIM5\u03b1 to assemble correlates with its ability to restrict HIV-1."

For these experiments, we used TRIM5-21R, a chimeric construct described in previous studies as a functional and structural surrogate for TRIM5\u03b1 due to its more favorable biochemical properties (<a href=\"#bib10\">Diaz-Griffero et al., 2006a</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Ganser-Pornillos et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Kar et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Langelier et al., 2008</a>). We incubated crosslinked HIV-1 CA tubes (biochemical surrogates for the HIV-1 capsid) with WT and mutant TRIM5-21R proteins, and then measured binding in a co-pelleting assay (<a href=\"#bib15\">Fribourgh et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Ganser-Pornillos et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Stremlau et al., 2006</a>). In control experiments, about 50% of WT TRIM5-21R was consistently found in the pellet (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Mutants were analyzed in parallel with a WT control, and results in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a> are representative of mutant binding efficiencies relative to WT from at least two experiments with independent protein preparations. Essentially all of the B-box mutants tested had detectable capsid binding activity, which was expected because all of these constructs contained an intact SPRY domain and because the R121E mutation that abolished restriction still supported capsid binding in a similar assay (<a href=\"#bib17\">Ganser-Pornillos et al., 2011</a>). Nevertheless, our results showed that weaker or no capsid binding correlated with weaker or no restriction activity (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>), confirming that B-box 2 domain mediated interactions promote efficient capsid recognition."

For this analysis, we focused on the hydrophobic (layer 2) mutations. Previously, purified TRIM5-21R was shown to assemble spontaneously into hexagonal arrays when incubated in low salt buffer at about 1 mg/mL (<a href=\"#bib17\">Ganser-Pornillos et al., 2011</a>). These micron-sized arrays can be readily visualized by negative stain electron microscopy (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). In contrast, the R121E mutant did not assemble spontaneously even at concentrations up to 30 mg/mL (<a href=\"#bib17\">Ganser-Pornillos et al., 2011</a>). We therefore tested our TRIM5-21R mutants for spontaneous assembly at both low (1 mg/mL) and high (&gt;5 mg/mL) protein concentrations. We found that mutations that gave the most significant reductions in restriction activity (L106A, W117E, L118D, and L132D) also prevented assembly at all protein concentrations tested (up to 18 mg/mL) (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a> and data not shown). Two of the mutations that supported intermediate restriction activity (L118A and L132A) also supported hexagonal lattice assembly, but only at high protein concentrations and to a more limited extent compared to WT (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B,C</a>). A third intermediate mutation, W117A, altered the assembly phenotype of TRIM5-21R. This mutant failed to assemble in standard low salt buffer at both 1 and 5 mg/mL, but at high protein concentrations and higher salt (&gt;250\u2009mM NaCl), it assembled into striated arrays (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). Interestingly, the L105A mutation (full restriction activity) also altered the spontaneous assembly behavior of TRIM5-21R. Under the same conditions as WT (low salt buffer and 1 mg/mL protein), L105A formed macram\u00e9-like networks that appeared distinct from either the hexagonal or striated arrays (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>)."

We therefore tested whether the CA-NC arrays can 'rescue' the altered spontaneous assembly phenotype of L105A and W117A. However, results were inconclusive; although the TRIM proteins appeared to associate with the CA-NC arrays, diffraction patterns that would indicate overlaying lattices were not observed (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a> and data not shown). We therefore used an alternative assay wherein soluble TRIM5\u03b1 and HIV-1 CA are mixed and incubated under basic conditions and moderate salt concentrations, which results in formation of CA tubes that are almost uniformly decorated with TRIM (<a href=\"#bib29\">Li et al., 2016</a>). The overlaying TRIM lattice on these tubes is related to the flat hexagonal arrays, except that it now follows the basal curvature of the CA tubes. Both WT TRIM5-21R (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>) and the L105A mutant (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>) showed similar behavior in this assay; that is, virtually all the tubes were uniformly decorated, and the decorations looked similar to each other and to those made by WT TRIM5\u03b1 (<a href=\"#bib29\">Li et al., 2016</a>). In contrast to the flat arrays, hexagon shapes were more difficult to discern in projection images of the curved arrays, and so we also analyzed negatively stained samples by electron tomography. As observed with vitrified samples (<a href=\"#bib29\">Li et al., 2016</a>), densities surrounding the CA tubes were readily discernible in the tomograms of our negatively-stained samples (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). As expected, the peripheral TRIM5\u03b1 layers exhibited a high degree of disorder, but for both WT (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>) and L105A (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>), we could clearly observe regions of local order with hexagonal rings having the expected dimensions for a TRIM hexamer. Interestingly, a proportion of the L105A decorations appeared more ladder-like (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>), but again the distances between the repeating units were similar to the TRIM hexagon dimensions. We therefore conclude that, although there is no clear structural explanation for the spontaneous assembly behavior of the L105A mutant, it can nevertheless form hexagonal arrays when it binds CA tubes in vitro. The inability of this mutant to form flat lattices (the endpoints of both the spontaneous assembly and template driven methods) suggests that B-box/B-box interactions might have some link to lattice curvature."

The thin linkers are made by the antiparallel coiled-coil dimer scaffold and the two-fold lobes are made by the SPRY domain (<a href=\"#bib17\">Ganser-Pornillos et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Goldstone et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Li et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Sanchez et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Weinert et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Li et al., 2016</a>).

By combining our miniTRIM trimer crystal structure with that of the B-box/coiled-coil dimer (PDB 4TN3) (<a href=\"#bib18\">Goldstone et al., 2014</a>), we built a molecular model of a flat TRIM5\u03b1 hexagonal lattice (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>). The unit cell spacing of this model is 338.5\u2009\u00c5, which is an almost exact match to the observed value for rhesus TRIM5\u03b1 (340\u2009\u00c5) (<a href=\"#bib29\">Li et al., 2016</a>). All of the SPRY domains are located on one side of the lattice plane (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>, blue spheres), where they could bind the capsid simultaneously. At the three-fold vertexes, the N-terminal ends of the B-boxes point toward the other side of the lattice plane. This suggests that the RING domains are oriented away from the capsid (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>, red spheres). This molecular architecture indicates that the higher-order TRIM scaffold also compartmentalizes the biochemical activities of the RING and SPRY domains."

Capsid lattice curvature is generated by rigid body hinge motions between subunits, and we have previously identified such hinges by comparing crystallographically independent structures of the hexameric and pentameric capsid building blocks (<a href=\"#bib36\">Pornillos et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">2011</a>). The availability of 12 independent miniTRIM structures allowed us to perform a similar analysis here. As illustrated in <a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10A</a>, superposition of the miniTRIM structures revealed that the coiled-coil can swing relative to the B-box 2 domain. Flexion occurs about the B-box/coiled-coil interface, which is lined almost exclusively by aliphatic sidechains (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10B</a>). Note that in context of full-length TRIM5, this 'greasy' interface is a quaternary contact between the subunits of the native dimer. Bending of the first two turns of the coiled-coil helix in the dimer subunits produced the greatest change in orientation of the B-box relative to the coiled-coil, but the rigid body motions were also evident in comparing dimer subunits or trimer subunits alone (not shown). In context of the trimer, the three coiled-coils do not contact each other and can therefore move independently (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10C,D</a>). We conclude that TRIM5\u03b1 uses the same general mechanism as retroviral capsids \u2013 flexion across quaternary interfaces and local conformational variations \u2013 to generate variable lattice curvature."

Indeed, TRIM5\u03b1 assembly on retroviral capsids is reported to enhance E3 ligase activity (<a href=\"#bib33\">Pertel et al., 2011</a>). The RING domain dimerizes to bind E2-Ub conjugates and catalyze Ub transfer (<a href=\"#bib50\">Yudina et al., 2015</a>). So far, we have been unable to solve a crystal structure of the RBcc miniTRIM, but structures of monomeric (inactive) and dimeric (active) forms of the TRIM5\u03b1 RING domain are both known (<a href=\"#bib30\">Lienlaf et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Yudina et al., 2015</a>), and so we used molecular modeling to determine possible configurations of the RINGs relative to the B-box trimer. An important consideration here is the structure of the L1 linker that connects the RING and B-box domains, which we define as the 23 amino acids (residues 72\u201394) that link the globular zinc-coordinating folds. Residues 72\u201382 are disordered in the monomeric RING structure, but are folded into a 4-helix bundle in the dimeric RING (<a href=\"#bib30\">Lienlaf et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Yudina et al., 2015</a>).

Linker residues were modeled as impenetrable spheres, and the entire linker was assumed to be an 'intrinsically disordered' segment ('native' setting in RANCH). This treatment seemed appropriate since the linker adopts alternative secondary structures (<a href=\"#bib30\">Lienlaf et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Yudina et al., 2015</a>). In the resulting ensemble, the vast majority of the RING domains are located above the plane of the trimer (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11A</a>, right). Thus, even flexibly tethered monomeric RINGs are predominantly located on one side of the lattice and away from the capsid. In a subset of our models, the RING/B-box linker folds down, in a configuration that brings the RING domain against the trimer vertex (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11A</a>, left). In principle, close packing of the RING domain and/or the RING/B-box linker against the trimer interface might explain the observation that the RING domain contributes to the efficiency of TRIM5\u03b1 higher-order assembly (<a href=\"#bib27\">Li et al., 2011</a>)."

A RING dimer subunit is therefore separated from its B-box by a shorter linker of 12 residues (<sub>83</sub>EVKLSPEEGQKV<sub>94</sub>). Analysis of this sequence using the PEP-FOLD server (<a href=\"#bib44\">Shen et al., 2014</a>) predicts that residues 87\u201394 have some propensity to fold into a short helix, and we therefore speculate that the dimeric RING/B-box linker might actually be a hinge rather than a flexible tether. Since E2-Ub binding imposes additional spatial constraints, stereochemical clashes can only be avoided if the RING dimer is positioned above the B-box trimer (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11B</a>). We therefore conclude that in context of the TRIM hexagonal lattice, the B-box trimer spatially restricts the RING domain, such that an active E3 ligase can only form on the side of the lattice that faces the cytoplasm. We also performed the same analysis on the B-box dimer; as expected, it also restricted RING positions, but to a lesser extent than the trimer (not shown)."

The principal Ub attachment sites are in the RING domain (Lys45 and Lys51) (<a href=\"#bib14\">Fletcher et al., 2015</a>). Although a B-box dimer is more naturally compatible with a RING dimer, a B-box trimer suggests an intuitively appealing mechanism for self-ubiquitination because it clusters three RING domains. In this model, two of the RING domains would dimerize and orient an E2-conjugated Ub for nucleophilic attack by the third RING (<a href=\"#bib50\">Yudina et al., 2015</a>). To determine if such a mechanism of self-ubiquitination is stereochemically plausible, we constructed a model for a ubiquitination complex on a TRIM5\u03b1 trimer vertex, by adding a third RING and an E2-Ub conjugate to one of our RING dimer/B-box trimer models. The two RING subunits that form the dimer were connected to their corresponding B-boxes by 12-residue linkers, whereas the third RING was connected by a longer and more flexible 23-residue linker. As illustrated in <a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11C</a>, we were able to identify stereochemically acceptable conformations that simultaneously allow trimerization of the B-box, dimerization of two RINGs, binding of the RING dimer to a Ub-conjugated E2, and positioning of the appropriate lysine in the third RING for nucleophilic attack of the E2-Ub thioester bond. Thus, although our modeling approach is somewhat crude, the results indicate that B-box trimerization is compatible with RING activation and TRIM5\u03b1 self-ubiquitination."

Our studies are consistent with this model, and further indicate that three-fold symmetric interactions at the vertexes of the hexagonal net are directly mediated by the B-box 2 domain. Indeed, our analysis suggests a 'rank order' of avidity promoting interactions, beginning with the 'minimal' coiled-coil dimer unit that positions (or clusters) two SPRY domains to bind the capsid simultaneously (<a href=\"#bib18\">Goldstone et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Javanbakht et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Yap et al., 2007</a>). In principle, higher-order assembly of any geometry can amplify the recognition and restriction activities of the minimal dimer unit, but complete avidity and full restriction seem to occur when the TRIM5 dimers are arranged to match the lattice symmetry of the capsid. This principle appears exemplified by the L105A and W117A B-box mutants (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). Like WT, the L105A mutant was fully restriction competent, bound to CA tubes efficiently in vitro, and formed observable hexagonal decorations on the tubes. In contrast, the W117A mutant was impaired in all three activities, even though it can clearly assemble spontaneously into higher-order but non-hexagonal arrays in vitro."

This is reasonable because facets of the capsid surface are approximately flat, and because flat TRIM5\u03b1 lattices assemble on two-dimensional crystals of the HIV-1 capsid protein. However, retroviral capsids present highly curved surfaces for TRIM5 binding, and the TRIM lattice must accommodate this curvature. Our structures demonstrate that the B-box/coiled-coil interface acts as a ball-and-socket joint, which imparts considerable flexibility in the way the coiled-coil arms emanate from the three-fold symmetric vertexes. Interestingly, our models define two major trajectories along which the coiled-coil can swing relative to the trimer plane (approximately parallel and approximately perpendicular). Motions parallel to the trimer plane change the angle between adjacent coiled-coils emanating from a vertex. This is consistent with the observation by <a href=\"#bib29\">Li et al. (2016)</a> that the vertex angles in TRIM hexagonal lattices can deviate significantly from the ideal value of 120\u00b0, even in flat lattices. In our models, the coiled-coil can make an arc of about 12\u00b0 along this trajectory. Angles between coiled-coil arms would therefore range from 120\u00b0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a024\u00b0, which accounts for the full range of observed values (100\u2013144\u00b0) (<a href=\"#bib29\">Li et al., 2016</a>). Perpendicular motions, on the other hand, modulate the concavity of the triskelion and can generate lattice curvature. <a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10E\u00a0and\u00a0F</a>\u00a0illustrate how the structural flexibility described above can allow the assembling TRIM lattice to scan for the most favorable SPRY domain positions and optimize local binding interactions, while simultaneously following the curvature of the bound capsid."

B-box dimers are clearly disfavored under our 'ideal' in vitro conditions wherein full-length TRIM5\u03b1 assembles into hexagonal arrays. In principle, however, B-box dimers provide a means for extending the TRIM array in regions where the local assembly environment disfavors trimers. Indeed, apparent dimer linkages can be occasionally discerned in TRIM-coated capsids\u00a0in vitro\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib29\">Li et al., 2016</a>). Interestingly, B-box dimerization is associated with local bending of the first two turns of the coiled-coil helix, as well as altered packing of the B-box against the coiled-coil domain. This suggests a potential mechanism of allosteric communication that can link B-box oligomerization and coiled-coil dynamics. Indeed, our observation that the L105A mutant could not assemble into flat arrays while remaining competent in forming curved arrays is another indication of a structural and functional link between B-box/B-box interactions, the coiled-coil dimer scaffold, and lattice curvature."

In principle, it is possible for a RING-containing subunit to act\u00a0simultaneously as ligase and ubiquitination substrate within the same E2-Ub/E3 complex, as biochemically demonstrated for the RING domain of RNF4 (<a href=\"#bib34\">Plechanovov\u00e1 et al., 2011</a>). Nevertheless, our modeling studies also support a mechanism by which the B-box trimer could contribute to TRIM5\u03b1 self-ubiquitination. Specifically, a B-box trimer could bring together three RINGs, with the first two acting as the E3 ligase and the third acting as the substrate. More important, our analysis further suggests that folding of the RING/B-box linker into a 4-helix bundle restricts the RING dimer to the outer surface of the TRIM hexagonal lattice, i.e., on the opposite side of the capsid binding surface. We suggest that this spatial compartmentalization facilitates formation of exposed polyubiquitin chains that can recruit downstream cytosolic factors to promote restriction and/or interferon signaling."

Additional input files for the RING monomer and dimer ensembles, respectively, were the NMR structure of the RING monomer (PDB 2ECV) (<a href=\"#bib30\">Lienlaf et al., 2011</a>) and the crystal structure of the RING dimer subunit (PDB 4TKP) (<a href=\"#bib50\">Yudina et al., 2015</a>). Residues linking the RING and B-box domains were modeled as impenetrable spheres, with a C\u03b1 angle distribution consistent with disordered proteins (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bernad\u00f3 et al., 2007</a>). Thus, possible interactions with the linker were disregarded. Since RANCH cannot model symmetry mismatched PDB files, the RING dimer orientations were modeled in the following manner. An ensemble of 30,000 models was calculated in the same manner as the RING monomer. The models were then computationally filtered to identify ones that contained a pair of RING domains wherein the distance of separation between two of the zinc lobes and their corresponding C-termini were consistent with the crystal structure of the RING dimer (<a href=\"#bib50\">Yudina et al., 2015</a>). The RING dimer structure was then re-aligned manually, and then rotated to avoid steric clashes. We found that the RING 4-helix bundle was an important restraint that led to identification of only a handful of plausible RING dimer/B-box trimer configurations. The model for the self-ubiquitination complex was created by superimposing one of the RING dimer/miniTRIM trimer models, the crystal structure of the TRIM5\u03b1 RING dimer in complex with Ubc13 (<a href=\"#bib50\">Yudina et al., 2015</a>), and the structure of the RNF4 RING dimer in complex with ubiquitin-conjugated Ubc5a (<a href=\"#bib35\">Plechanovov\u00e1 et al., 2012</a>). To model the third, substrate RING, the ensemble of 10,000 RING monomer/miniTRIM trimer models was then screened computationally to identify an orientation that placed the appropriate RING lysine (Lys45 or Lys51) within 8\u2009\u00c5 of the E2-ubiquitin thioester bond without steric clashes between any of the structural elements."

Some success has been had with subdomains, but understanding how the domains fit together has been elusive. To address the core TRIM5 assembly, the authors generated B-box domain constructs (RBcc miniTRIM and Bcc miniTRIM) with a truncated coiled-coil domain and hairpin linker that behaved well in solution. R121E mutants disrupted the ability of the miniTRIMs to oligomerize, as shown by size exclusion chromatography. Crystals were obtained with Bcc miniTRIM and multiple structures were solved that overlapped with a previous structure of the B-box 2/coiled-coil dimer. The miniTRIM formed dimers and trimers, the latter with 3 B-box 2 domains at the vertex and a contribution from the N-terminus of the coiled-coil helix. Most were dimers in solution, though the trimer form better matched the hexamer models observed with full-length protein. Mutations that disrupted critical interactions (E102K, K103E, E102K/K103E, E120R, and R121E) were generated in the context of full-length protein and shown to disrupt restriction activity in tissue culture. Expression levels correlated inversely with the ability to assemble and to restrict. All TRIM5 mutants were able to pellet with CA assemblies albeit with reduced efficiency. Mutations that reduced restriction activity (L106A, W117E, L118D, and L132D) prevented or decreased spontaneous assembly of TRIM5-21R into a hexameric lattice, or assembly with CA. The authors then generated models to explain how TRIM5 forms a lattice that accommodates binding to the variable curvature of the retroviral CA lattice, formation of B-box trimers, RING dimers bound to Ub-E2s, as well as proximity of a RING domain K51 to the thioester of Ub-E2. The creative approaches here have paid off. They are beautifully executed and greatly advance our understanding of the structure/function of TRIM5. The manuscript is well written, clear."

TRIM5\u03b1 is a cytoplasmic restriction factor that recognizes the mature capsid core after viral entry and prevents completion of the first half of the viral replication cycle. TRIM5\u03b1 contains an N-terminal RING domain, a B-box domain, a coiled coil and a C-terminal PRYSPRY domain. The protein dimerizes via the coiled-coil domain forming an extended linear structure, with the two PRYSPRY (recognition) domains coming together at the center of the dimer. Recent published work has shown that recombinant TRIM proteins representing TRIM5\u03b1 appear to assemble as a hexameric lattice on the surface of the viral capsid lattice, and that each side of a TRIM hexamer is composed of a dimer. The current paper focuses on understanding multimeric interactions between B-box domains, and suggests that these trimerize to form the three-fold vertices of the TRIM5 lattice. The results also suggest that the TRIM5\u03b1 lattice has flexibility at the vertices allowing concavity necessary to coat a curved surface (such as the icosahedral capsid shell) as well as flexibility in the angle between the TRIM5\u03b1 \"arms\" extending from the B-boxes."
