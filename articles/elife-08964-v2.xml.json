In some cases, these neurites interact with those of neighboring neurons, a phenomenon called self/non-self discrimination. The functional roles of these processes remain unknown. In this study, we used retinal starburst amacrine cells (SACs), critical components of a direction-selective circuit, to address this issue. In SACs, both processes are mediated by the gamma-protocadherins (Pcdhgs), a family of 22 recognition molecules. We manipulated Pcdhg expression in SACs and recorded from them and their targets, direction-selective ganglion cells (DSGCs). SACs form autapses when self-avoidance is disrupted and fail to form connections with other SACs when self/non-self discrimination is perturbed. Pcdhgs are also required to prune connections between closely spaced SACs. These alterations degrade the direction selectivity of DSGCs. Thus, self-avoidance, self/non-self discrimination, and synapse elimination are essential for proper function of a circuit that computes directional motion."

Thus, self-avoidance, self/non-self discrimination, and synapse elimination are essential for proper function of a circuit that computes directional motion."

The dendrites of starburst amacrine cells generate signals when objects move across the animal's field of vision. These dendrites then signal to other starburst amacrine cells and to so-called \u2018direction-selective ganglion cells\u2019, which in turn send this information to the brain for further processing. The experiments revealed that these disruptions affected the connections between the dendrites. Starburst amacrine cells that lacked self-avoidance mistakenly formed connections with themselves\u2014as if they mistook their own dendrites for those of other starburst cells. In contrast, neurons that lacked self/non-self discrimination made the opposite mistake, and rarely formed connections with each other\u2014as if they mistook the dendrites of other starbursts for their own. Disruptions to either phenomenon interfered with the activity of the direction-selective ganglion cells."

Dendrites of olfactory projection neurons and axons of mushroom body neurons also exhibit self-avoidance in <i>Drosophila</i> (<a href=\"#bib77\">Wang et al., 2002a</a>; <a href=\"#bib88\">Zhan et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Hattori et al., 2007</a>). In mammals, self-avoidance has been documented in cerebellar Purkinje cells and some types of retinal horizontal, bipolar, amacrine, and ganglion cells (<a href=\"#bib50\">Montague and Friedlander, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Wassle et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Lefebvre et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Matsuoka et al., 2012</a>).

                        "text": "In some instances, processes of neurons that exhibit self-avoidance do not avoid other neurons of the same type; rather, they overlap extensively with and sometimes even form synapses on each other. Thus, these neurons appear to discriminate between their own processes, which they repel, and those of their neighbors, with which they interact (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). This puzzling observation suggests that processes of nominally identical neurons are immune to the repellent forces that act within each other's arbors, a phenomenon that has been called S/NSD (<a href=\"#bib90\">Zipursky and Grueber, 2013</a>). Of the molecules that mediate self-avoidance, two have also been shown to mediate S/NSD: fly Dscam1 and mouse Pcdhgs (<a href=\"#bib28\">Hattori et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Hughes et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Matthews et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Soba et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Lefebvre et al., 2012</a>). While Dscam1 and Pcdhg proteins are not structurally related, they have three properties that allow them to mediate both self-avoidance and S/NSD. First, both are transmembrane recognition molecules with remarkable extracellular diversity. Alternative splicing of the Dscam1 transcripts and alternative promoter choice (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>) plus isoform multimerization of Pcdhgs lead to &gt;10,000 recognition units (<a href=\"#bib64\">Schmucker et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Tasic et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Murata et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Schreiner and Weiner, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Thu et al., 2014</a>). Second, each Dscam1 and Pcdhg isoform binds homophilically, but does not bind appreciably to other, closely related isoforms (<a href=\"#bib82\">Wojtowicz et al., 2004</a>, <a href=\"#bib83\">2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Schreiner and Weiner, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Thu et al., 2014</a>). Finally, in those cases where tests have been made, each neuron in a population expresses a small randomly selected subset of isoforms (<a href=\"#bib53\">Neves et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib88\">Zhan et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Kaneko et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Miura et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Toyoda et al., 2014</a>), leading to molecular diversification that, in the case of <i>Drosophila</i> Dscam1, has been demonstrated to be important for proper patterning of neural circuits (<a href=\"#bib27\">Hattori et al., 2009</a>). Together, these observations have led to a model for self-avoidance and S/NSD in which Dscam1- and Pcdhg-mediated homophilic interactions generate signals leading to repulsion. Because all dendrites (or axons) of a single neuron display the same set of Dscam1 or Pcdhg isoforms, they exhibit self-avoidance. On the other hand, any individual neuron is unlikely to encounter a neighbor that displays the same combination of isoforms, so the neurons do not repel each other and thus display S/NSD."

To our knowledge, however, none of these hypotheses has been tested experimentally. Here, we report such tests, focusing on retinal starburst amacrine cells (SACs; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). These neurons have planar, radially symmetric dendritic arbors that exhibit striking self-avoidance (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>), but they fasciculate and form synapses with neighboring SACs (<a href=\"#bib40\">Lee and Zhou, 2006</a>), and thus exhibit S/NSD. SACs also provide the principal inhibitory input to ON and ON-OFF direction-selective retinal ganglion cells (DSGCs) and are essential for their direction selectivity (<a href=\"#bib87\">Yoshida et al., 2001</a>). Elegant structural and functional studies have revealed the principal elements of the underlying mechanism: individual SAC dendrites are inhibitory direction-selective subunits that wire asymmetrically to DSGCs and inhibit these ganglion cells when visual motion is presented along their proximo\u2013distal axis (<a href=\"#bib15\">Euler et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Fried et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Briggman et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Vaney et al., 2012</a>). Thus, the preferred direction of motion for the DSGC is opposite, the preferred direction of motion for the SAC dendrites that innervate it (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). In addition, SACs form inhibitory synapses onto each other, and it has been suggested that these connections sharpen the directional preference of SAC dendrites and thus the directional preference of the DSGCs that they innervate (<a href=\"#bib40\">Lee and Zhou, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Enciso et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Taylor and Smith, 2012</a>)."

Pcdhg-deficient SACs exhibit a dramatic loss of self-avoidance but maintain overlap with neighboring SACs, as if they mistake their own dendrites for those of their neighbors and fail to repel them. In contrast, forcing all SACs to express the same single Pcdhg isoform restores self-avoidance to individual cells but decreases the overlap between neighboring cells, as if they mistake dendrites of these neighbors for their own and repel them (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F\u2013H</a>). These results lead to three specific hypotheses about circuit function: (1) in the absence of self-avoidance, SACs will form synapses with themselves (autapses), (2) when S/NSD fails, SACs will form few synapses with each other, and (3) loss of self-avoidance or S/NSD will degrade the direction selectivity of DSGCs. Here, we present evidence in support of these hypotheses, thereby providing insights into the functional roles of self-avoidance and S/NSD. We also demonstrate an unexpected role of Pcdhgs in control of synapse elimination."

To begin this study, we confirmed that similar connections occur in young mice and asked whether they persist in adults. In addition to releasing GABA, SACs also release acetylcholine, the only retinal neuron to do so (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hayden et al., 1980</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Famiglietti, 1983</a>), so we used a line that expresses Cre recombinase from the choline acetyltransferase locus to mark and manipulate them selectively (Chat<sup>cre</sup>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Rossi et al., 2011</a>). We mated Chat<sup>cre</sup> mice to lines that express Cre-dependent fluorescent reporters (<a href=\"#bib7\">Buffelli et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Madisen et al., 2010</a>), identified SACs in explants, and recorded from pairs of ON SACs shortly after eye opening (postnatal day [P] 15\u201324; eye opening occurs at P14) and in young adults (P40-100) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). We refer to wild-type SACs as Pcdhg<sup>22</sup> SACs, since they have their full complement of Pcdhgs. In each case, we tested pairs separated by distances varying from 35 to 175 \u00b5m; the dendritic radius of SACs in living tissue is \u223c100 \u00b5m and varies little between P15 and P100 (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). For each pair, we stepped presynaptic SACs from a holding potential (V<sub>h</sub>) of \u221270 mV to +20 mV while holding postsynaptic SACs at +30 mV to record inhibitory currents.

For this purpose, we inactivated all 22 Pcdhgs in SACs using a conditional Pcdhg allele (Pcdhg<sup>flox</sup>) (<a href=\"#bib43\">Lefebvre et al., 2008</a>) and the Chat<sup>cre</sup> line. We refer to Pcdhg<sup>flox/flox</sup>; Chat<sup>cre</sup> mice as Pcdhg<sup>0</sup> and controls (Pcdhg<sup>flox/+</sup> or Pcdhg<sup>+/+</sup>; Chat<sup>cre</sup>) as Pcdhg<sup>22</sup>. Restricting mutation to SACs allowed us to analyze roles of Pcdhgs in SACs without the complication of directly affecting other synaptic partners. Moreover, deletion of Pcdhgs leads to excessive cell death in many retinal neuronal populations, but not in SACs (<a href=\"#bib43\">Lefebvre et al., 2008</a>, <a href=\"#bib41\">2012</a>). As expected, we observed no alterations in the density of SACs or of other retinal cells in Pcdhg<sup>0</sup> retinas. We further verified that the laminar position and mosaic spacing of SACs, as well as overall retinal structure, did not differ detectably between Pcdhg<sup>22</sup> and Pcdhg<sup>0</sup> retinas (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplements 3, 4</a>)."

Thus, Pcdhgs are dispensable for formation of SAC\u2013SAC synapses. In adults, in contrast, the pattern of SAC\u2013SAC connectivity differed between Pcdhg<sup>22</sup> and Pcdhg<sup>0</sup> mice. Synapses between closely spaced SACs were retained in mutants during the period that they were lost from controls (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E,G,I,K</a>). This loss of proximal connections was selective in that the frequency and size of connections between SACs separated by &gt;100 \u00b5m did not differ significantly between Pcdhg<sup>22</sup> and Pcdhg<sup>0</sup> mice (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2J,K</a>).

To test this hypothesis, we adapted a protocol that had been used to elicit autaptic currents in cultured neurons and cortical slices (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bekkers and Stevens, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Bacci et al., 2003</a>). We stimulated SACs with brief voltage steps to very positive potentials (V = +60 mV, 2\u20134 ms), then returned to more negative potentials (V = \u221220 mV) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). We confirmed that this stimulation was able to elicit synaptic release in paired recordings (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). These stimuli elicited autaptic currents in \u223c75% of Pcdhg<sup>0</sup> SACs at P21-24, but in no Pcdhg<sup>22</sup> SACs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,C</a>). Autaptic currents resembled SAC\u2013SAC connections in their latencies and rise times, were blockable by application of 50 \u00b5M picrotoxin, and averaged \u223c20 pA in size (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F,G</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B,C</a>). We also asked whether autapses are present in adult Pcdhg<sup>0</sup> SACs or whether, like synapses between closely spaced SACs in wild-type retina (see previous section), they are progressively eliminated. Autapses persisted into adulthood in Pcdhg<sup>0</sup> SACs with sizes and frequency similar to those observed at P21-24 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D\u2013G</a>).

We hypothesized that if all SACs expressed the same Pcdhg isoform, they would treat dendrites of other SACs as if they were other dendrites of the same SAC, and form few SAC\u2013SAC synapses. To test this idea, we used a mouse line in which a single Pcdhg isoform (PcdhgC3) can be expressed in any cell type in a Cre-dependent manner (<a href=\"#bib41\">Lefebvre et al., 2012</a>).

We wondered whether this improvement of direction selectivity with age was related to the loss of proximal SAC\u2013SAC connections. To assess this possibility, we recorded from direction-selective responses from vDSGCs at P15-24 in Pcdhg<sup>0</sup> mice, which do not go through a developmental change in SAC\u2013SAC connectivity. We confirmed the improved age-dependent directional tuning of DSGCs in control retinas. In contrast, direction selectivity of vDSGCs did not improve in Pcdhg<sup>0</sup> retinas (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

First, inhibitory input to DSGCs is greater for movement in the null direction (dorsal for vDSGCs) than for movement in the preferred direction (ventral for vDSGCs), whereas excitatory input is similar for movement in both directions (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,J,K</a>). Second, excitatory and inhibitory currents recorded from DSGCs arise at the same time when motion is in the null direction, whereas inhibitory currents lag with respect to excitatory currents when motion is in the preferred direction (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B,L,M</a>).

In this study, we used SACs to assess the functional consequences of perturbing these processes. SACs were uniquely suited for this study for several reasons. First, they exhibit robust self-avoidance and S/NSD. Second, Pcdhgs are necessary for both processes, providing a means to manipulate them. Moreover, our genetic methods allowed us to manipulate Pcdhgs selectively in SACs, without directly affecting other neuronal types to which they connect. Third, removal or replacement of Pcdhgs in SACs allowed us to perturb self-avoidance and S/NSD independently. Finally, the role of SACs in retinal circuit function is remarkably well understood. By exploiting these features, we elucidated roles of self-avoidance and S/NSD in SAC connectivity, discovered a previously undescribed phase of synapse elimination between SACs, and showed that alterations in these processes decrease the ability of the retina to compute direction of motion."

Any of these phenotypes would complicate our attempt to assess roles of self-avoidance and S/NSD in SAC and circuit function. We therefore manipulated Pcdhg expression selectively in SACs and performed a variety of control experiments to assess whether our manipulations affected other aspects of retinal development or function.

Second, we confirmed (<a href=\"#bib41\">Lefebvre et al., 2012</a>) that alteration of Pcdhg expression in SACs had no effect on their dendritic length or mosaic spacing. Third, basic electrical properties (resting membrane potential and input resistance) of SACs were preserved in Pcdhg<sup>0</sup> and Pcdhg<sup>1</sup> retinas (data not shown). Fourth, manipulation of Pcdhgs in SACs had no detectable effect on the strength of the inputs they receive from bipolar cells or deliver to DSGCs. Fifth, removing or replacing Pcdhgs in SACs had no detectable effect on cell number or general organization of the retina. Finally, we detected no alteration in the number, spacing, dendritic arbors, molecular markers or electrical properties of ventrally-preferring DSGCs. Thus, although we cannot completely exclude the possibility that Pcdhg manipulation had additional effects, we favor the explanation that alterations in SAC connectivity and circuit function documented here result from perturbation of Pcdhg-dependent self-avoidance, S/NSD, and synapse elimination."

Our physiological studies revealed an additional role of self-avoidance in SACs: it prevents formation of autapses (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). In many neuronal types, autapses cannot form because pre- and postsynaptic machinery are confined to axons and dendrites, respectively, which are physically segregated. SACs, in contrast, form dendro-dendritic synapses, and therefore have pre- and postsynaptic specializations intermingled. This situation is not uncommon in the retina and elsewhere in the central nervous system, such as the olfactory bulb (<a href=\"#bib52\">Murthy, 2011</a>). We suggest that self-avoidance may play similar roles in other such cells."

Several types of neurons have been shown to form homotypic connections in cortex and cerebellum (<a href=\"#bib57\">Pfeffer et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Rieubland et al., 2014</a>). Since most molecules described to date that mediate self-avoidance are ill-suited to mediate S/NSD, additional mechanisms likely remain to be discovered. In addition, some cell types that connect homotypically may lack robust mechanisms for self-avoidance. Indeed, cortical fast-spiking interneurons, which form homotypic connections, also form autapses (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bacci et al., 2003</a>). It is unclear whether these autapses are beneficial to the circuit or whether they are an acceptable cost of homotypic connectivity."

We also discovered two additional features of these connections. First, in mature retina (&gt;P40), SACs separated by less than 100 \u00b5m seldom formed synapses with each other, whereas SACs separated by &gt; 100 \u00b5m were connected frequently. Since dendritic overlap is inversely proportional to the distance between SACs, this distance-dependence is not a passive consequence of proximity but instead implies spatial selectivity to SAC\u2013SAC connections. Second, we found that this distance-dependence was absent in immature retinas (P15-24; eye opening occurs at P14). Thus, connections between closely spaced SACs are selectively lost as the retina matures."

In most cases, synapse elimination was first described physiologically (<a href=\"#bib60\">Redfern, 1970</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Crepel et al., 1976</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Purves and Lichtman, 1980</a>) as we have done here. For these cases, morphological confirmation was obtained many years later. We expect this will be the case for SACs as well. Such demonstration will be difficult, however, because SAC dendrites are so thin and densely packed that it is infeasible to map synapses on them by light microscopic methods. Ultrastructural studies using genetic tags or extensive reconstruction at several developmental time points will therefore be needed to decide this issue."

Inhibitory connections between nearby SACs would frequently be made between dendrites with similar directional preferences. The ability of a SAC dendrite to respond to centrifugal motion along its dendrite would thereby decrease, because this motion would lead to inhibition of the dendrite by other SACs. This, in turn, would degrade the direction selectivity of DSGCs (<a href=\"#bib70\">Taylor and Smith, 2012</a>). In contrast, connections of distant SACs will most frequently be made between dendrites with opposite directional preference; as discussed in the next section, this enhances directional computation."

In fact, strong SAC\u2013SAC connectivity is critical for the developing visual system, because it underlies propagation of the retinal waves that pattern the segregation of binocular input in retinorecipient areas such as the superior colliculus and lateral geniculate nucleus (<a href=\"#bib17\">Ford et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Ackman and Crair, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Burbridge et al., 2014</a>). Because waves occur before eye-opening, directional selectivity is unimportant. Thus, we suggest that postponing distance-dependent elimination of SAC\u2013SAC connections until after eye-opening allows both the dense connectivity needed for wave propagation and the selective anti-parallel connectivity needed for direction selectivity. Consistent with this view, the direction selectivity of DSGCs increases during the period in which connections between closely spaced SACs are being eliminated."

First, inhibitory currents are larger during null motion than preferred motion. The difference in inhibitory currents arises in large part from the geometric arrangement of SAC\u2013DSGC connections: vDGSCs, for example, receive most SAC input from dendrites that respond preferentially to dorsal (null) motion (<a href=\"#bib6\">Briggman et al., 2011</a>). In addition, anti-parallel inhibitory connections between SACs decrease the currents that these dendrites would otherwise provide during preferred motion (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). Together, these processes result in greater net depolarization and therefore spiking for preferred motion than null motion. The number of SAC\u2013SAC connections is markedly decreased in Pcdhg<sup>1</sup> retinas (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7I</a>). These connections persist in Pcdhg<sup>0</sup> retinas, but their efficacy is decreased because parallel SAC dendrites remain connected and inhibit each other, resulting in decreased inhibitory input from SACs to DSCGs for null motion and decreased antiparallel SAC\u2013SAC inhibition (and thus increased SAC\u2013DSCG inhibition) for preferred motion (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>). The autapses in Pcdhg<sup>0</sup> retina would act similarly to synapses between parallel dendrites, since autapsing dendrites are likely to point in similar directions (see Pcdhg<sup>0</sup> SAC image in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>)."

A recent computational model argues that the delayed inhibition for preferred motion arises in part because anti-parallel SAC\u2013SAC connections transiently suppress transmitter release from SACs to DSGCs (<a href=\"#bib70\">Taylor and Smith, 2012</a>). Decreased inhibition, from loss of SAC\u2013SAC connections in Pcdhg<sup>1</sup> retinas and decreased efficacy of SAC\u2013SAC synapses Pcdhg<sup>0</sup> retinas, would thus be expected to decrease the delay, thereby blunting the response to preferred motion."

Monochrome light was used (wavelength peak = 405 nm) at a background intensity 5 \u00d7 10<sup>2</sup> R<sup>*</sup>/rod/s set using neutral density filters. Visual stimuli were presented at 100:1 positive contrast and patterns generated using Psychophysics Toolbox in MATLAB and are available as <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Source code 1</a>. All stimuli were centered on the cell body of recorded neurons. Spot flash stimuli were 300 \u03bcm-diameter circles. Moving bars were 1000\u20131500 \u03bcm long and 300 \u03bcm wide, traveled at 1000 \u03bcm/s, presented moving along their long axis in 8 directions, and rotated by 135\u00b0 with each presentation. At the speeds we used for our visual stimuli, nonlinear dendritic processes contributing to directional tuning are not observed in HB9-GFP vDSGCs (<a href=\"#bib75\">Trenholm et al., 2011</a>). A minimum of 4 repetitions were presented for each stimulus."

                    "text": "The idea of sparse, stochastic expression of Pcdhgs is based on convincing data of Yagi et al. from Purkinje cells. We agree that it remains unproven for SACs, but that is not for lack of effort. First, as part of his work on the preceding paper (<a href=\"#bib41\">Lefebvre et al., 2012</a>), Dimitar applied to SACs the \u201csplit single cell RT-PCR\u201d protocols that Yagi and colleagues had devised to analyze Pcdhg expression in Purkinje cells (Esumi, Nature Genetics, 2005; Kaneko et al., JBC, 2006). He detected Pcdhg expression in groups of \u223c10 cells but was unable to obtain consistent results from single cells. Although we cannot rule out ineptitude as a factor, we believe a major problem is that the volume of SAC is \u223c3% that of Purkinje cells, so copy number is correspondingly decreased. Second, in experiments done for another purpose, we recently profiled 96 isolated SACs using a MALBAC protocol (Chapman, PLoS One, 2015). We detected 18 of the 22 Pcdhgs. Each was expressed by a subset of the 96 cells, ranging from 3 to 26 with an average of around 15. This is consistent with the combinatorial expression that Yagi showed in Purkinje cells and that we propose for SACs. At face value, we could conclude that around 3 isoforms were expressed per cell (15x22/96). However, we do not feel comfortable reporting these data in a formal way because we have no way of knowing whether apparently negative cells represent true negatives or insufficient capture efficiency or sequencing depth. The beauty of Yagi's method is that the \u201csplit cell\u201d strategy provided assurance on this point \u2013 but as I already said, we were unable to get this method to work on SACs. Finally, as the reviewer points out, we recently used Drop-Seq to obtain transcriptomic data from around 33,000 unsorted retinal cells, of which 289 were identifiable as SACs (Macosko, Cell, 2015). Here Pcdhg detection was hampered by the low sequence depth and the fact that reads were heavily biased to the 3' end, which is shared by all of the Pcdhgs. (That is, only reads from the 5' half of the transcript are diagnostic.) In fact, we detected almost no Pcdhgs in SACs. Pcdhbs (which have unique 3\u2019 ends) were detected, consistent with the 3\u2019 bias. In short, we have worked hard to test the idea of sparse, combinatorial expression of Pcdhgs in SACs and although the data we have obtained are consistent with this model, we are unable to make any definitive statement at this time."
