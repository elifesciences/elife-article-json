However, the number of published models, and the lack of standardization, make the comparison of ion channel models with one another and with experimental data difficult. Here, we present a framework for the automated large-scale classification of ion channel models. Using annotated metadata and responses to a set of voltage-clamp protocols, we assigned 2378 models of voltage- and calcium-gated ion channels coded in <i>NEURON</i> to 211 clusters. The <i>IonChannelGenealogy</i> (ICGenealogy) web interface provides an interactive resource for the categorization of new and existing models and experimental recordings. It enables quantitative comparisons of simulated and/or measured ion channel kinetics, and facilitates field-wide standardization of experimentally-constrained modeling."

However, the number of published models, and the lack of standardization, make the comparison of ion channel models with one another and with experimental data difficult. Here, we present a framework for the automated large-scale classification of ion channel models. Using annotated metadata and responses to a set of voltage-clamp protocols, we assigned 2378 models of voltage- and calcium-gated ion channels coded in <i>NEURON</i> to 211 clusters. The <i>IonChannelGenealogy</i> (ICGenealogy) web interface provides an interactive resource for the categorization of new and existing models and experimental recordings. It enables quantitative comparisons of simulated and/or measured ion channel kinetics, and facilitates field-wide standardization of experimentally-constrained modeling."

The protocols were designed to probe the gating characteristics of ion channels, that\u00a0is, activation, deactivation and inactivation, as well as temporal dynamics during voltage ramping and repeated action potentials. Protocol parameters were adjusted for each of the five ion classes separately. Current responses were normalized to remove the dependence on the maximum conductance, and subsampled at particular regions of interest (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, dashed areas) to obtain a trace of characteristic data points for each protocol (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1F</a>). Using principal component analysis (PCA) across all traces of a particular ion channel type, we obtained a final <math id=\"inf11\"><mi>D</mi></math>-dimensional score for each ion channel model, accounting for at least 99% of the variance across all channel models in each class. The dimensionality <math id=\"inf12\"><mi>D</mi></math> varied between 16 and 29 dimensions for the five classes (Kv: 16, Nav: 21, Cav: 29, KCa: 16, Ih: 16). The Euclidean distance between any two given model scores was termed their \u2018similarity\u2019 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, top). Finally, we used Ward\u2019s clustering method (<a href=\"#bib72\">Ward, 1963</a>) on the model scores to establish an agglomerative hierarchy of ion channel model clusters (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, bottom)."

However, a common subtype label did not guarantee a common cluster identity (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplements 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s2\">2C,H</a>). Many models with the same subtype fell into different clusters. For example, the ~250 A-type-labeled Kv ion channel models fell into 14 clusters (although only five clusters comprised over 90% of them, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). These clusters contained few other subtype labels, suggesting that <i>A-type</i> is generally a consistent label for at least five similar, yet distinct kinetic behaviors. Moreover, the similarity between these clusters was generally high (and thus they were plotted within the same vicinity on the wheel of the \u2018Circos\u2019 plot, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>; see also Materials and methods). Other subtype labels across all ion channel types showed similar results (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplements 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s2\">2C,H</a>). Interestingly, for four of the five ion type classes (KCa being the exception), most isolated single-model clusters corresponded to genealogical singletons, supporting the idea that these ion channel models are indeed unique, and do not appear isolated simply due to missing ancestor-descendant links. However, this was not true for all genealogical singletons, many of which were kinetically aligned to larger families and consequently fell into the same clusters. In conclusion, clustering allowed us to identify 211 distinct groups of ion channel models that share similar behavior, regardless of publication context or subtype labeling."

Voltage-gated cationic currents across the membranes of these neurons are thought to be dominated by A-type K+ channels, in particular Shal/Kv4\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib24\">Gasque et al., 2005</a>). This renders Kenyon cells a suitable neuronal cell type to test the biological relevance of our voltage-clamp protocols in an in vivo setting. Current responses were recorded in targeted whole-cell patch clamp experiments in vivo (see Materials and methods). The recordings were performed using our five standardized voltage-clamp protocols, allowing us to transform and compare the experiments directly to ion channel models in the same \u2019score\u2019 space (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). The comparison revealed a close match to an existing model from our resource, and thus characterizes the behavior of the ion channel as similar to a mammalian Kv4 ion channel (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Fineberg et al.

Importantly, the need for assessment and aggregation of published knowledge extends beyond experimental data, and has recently started encompassing computational models of neural function (<a href=\"#bib34\">Hines et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Gleeson et al., 2013</a>). Here, we have performed a meta-analysis of voltage- and calcium-dependent ion channel models coded in the <i>NEURON</i> programming language available in the database <i>ModelDB</i> (<a href=\"#bib34\">Hines et al., 2004</a>). Our approach of combining metadata extracted from publications with a kinetics-based analysis allowed us to provide detailed information regarding the identity of each ion channel model in the resource, filling in missing or ambiguous data, and validating the functional properties of channel models against their sometimes ambiguous nomenclature. Furthermore, we provide a framework for the large-scale comparison of models, both with each other and with experiments using the same standardized protocols, thus paving the way towards a unified characterization of ion channel function."

Measuring the kinetic responses of each channel model allowed us to compare models regardless of their specific implementation. Notably, our method is amenable to the addition of other protocols that may be better suited to separate certain models. However, there is evidence that simple step and ramp current pulses are sufficient to probe the underlying kinetics of neurons (<a href=\"#bib18\">Druckmann et al., 2011</a>), similar to the voltage-clamp protocols that we use here.

Of the 2378 models in our resource, we could identify 1132 models as unique, and further reduced this to 211 groups with substantially different kinetics. However, this does not eliminate the task of finding the most appropriate ion channel model current, and we stress that the partition of channel models into clusters of similar response properties does not imply that models in the same cluster are necessarily redundant. Clustering is not trivial, and while we have used several measures to determine an appropriate partition of models, we cannot escape a certain level of ambiguity. Intra-cluster differences may still be important depending on the particular simulation at hand. Since the responses of different channels vary slowly and continuously rather than in discrete steps along the dimensions of the manifold of scores (see e.g. <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), the data may also be amenable to more sophisticated clustering and machine-learning approaches. To this end, the raw response data and scores have been made publicly available (<a href=\"#bib38\">ICGenealogy, 2016</a>)."

Customizable ion channel models are coded in <i>NEURON</i> in so-called .<i>mod</i> files (with suffix \u2018.mod\u2019) (<a href=\"#bib32\">Hines and Carnevale, 2000</a>). Mod files for all <i>NEURON</i> entries were downloaded from the <i>ModelDB</i> website. Each mod file was renamed by adding the <i>ModelDB</i> ID as a prefix to the file, in the following way: <i>ID_name</i>.<i>mod</i>, where <i>ID</i> is the <i>ModelDB</i> ID, and <i>name</i> is the original name of the .<i>mod</i> file. 46 .<i>mod</i> files contained more than one current of the same ion type, and were separated into distinct files for each one. The suffix \u2018icgXY\u2019 was appended to the name, where X was the ion type, and Y was the number of the current, beginning with 1 (e.g., 1234_kv_icgK2.mod for the second Kv current in file 1234_kv.mod). Furthermore, some ModelDB entries contained more than one file with the same name. These files were added separately and given unique names by appending a version number to the name \u2013 e.g. \u2018_v2\u2019 for the second file. The total number of files collected from the database was 3495."

Based on the desired effect of each protocol, only particular sections of the protocols were used in comparing the kinetics (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, dashed lines; also noted in <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). The activation protocol featured a single voltage step level, meant to capture the activation kinetics of the model. The inactivation protocol featured a varying voltage step for a long duration, followed by a second fixed voltage step, measuring the inactivation due to the first step. The deactivation protocol featured a single voltage step at a high voltage, followed by a second voltage step of varying amplitude, meant to measure the deactivation kinetics that occur as the voltage is changed from one level to the other. The ramp protocol featured a series of four up and down ramping voltages, at different slopes. Finally, the action potential protocol features voltage deflections as recorded from the soma of a neuron exhibiting a regular spiking pattern. This was recorded from a L2/3 pyramidal neuron of P14 rat somatosensory cortex (R Ranjan, unpublished). Each of the five ion type groups featured different voltage values and durations based on differences in time constants, reversal potentials, and voltage ranges at which each ion channel class is known to be active \u2013 no quantitative comparisons were made between classes.

This matrix was then dimensionality reduced by PCA across the <math id=\"inf102\"><mi>L</mi></math> temporal entries, where we chose the reduced dimensionality to capture 99% of the variability. To normalize the range of scores across conditions while keeping the covariance structure, we divided the score vector of each protocol by the standard deviation of all score entries of this protocol. These normalized scores (denoted by <i>condition scores</i>) were then combined into a final score vector. Further correlations across protocols were removed by again dimensionality-reducing by PCA (99% variance criterion) to yield a final score vector for each model. Since response traces were relatively noise-free, a high PCA dimensionality can be chosen to capture current response dimensions that are rare across the population of models. The precise value of the variance criterion in both PCA steps, although slightly changing the resulting scores, did not affect the clustering results reported above. The\u00a0similarity between two channel models was then defined as the Euclidean distance of their dimensionality reduced scores."

This method can be used to produce a division of the set of all channel models into an arbitrary number of \u2018similar\u2019 clusters, the number of which has to be constrained by internal criteria (we assumed no a-priori existence of classes in this dataset) (<a href=\"#bib30\">Halkidi et al., 2001</a>). To this end we employed a range of internal clustering evaluation measures, which indicate the emergence of an appropriate number of clusters. Although the evaluation of these measures requires some heuristics, they have been well established and can guide the decision as to which number of clusters to choose. Concretely, these are: the Silhouette criterion (<a href=\"#bib61\">Rousseeuw, 1987</a>), the Dunn index (<a href=\"#bib20\">Dunn, 1973</a>), the Davies-Bouldin index (<a href=\"#bib14\">Davies and Bouldin, 1979</a>), and the Calinski-Harabasz measure (<a href=\"#bib7\">Calinski and Harabasz, 1974</a>), also implemented in the MATLAB Statistics Toolbox (R2015A, The MathWorks Inc., Natick, MA).

It facilitates the viewing of model channel development metadata as well as allows standardized comparisons of ion channel models.
