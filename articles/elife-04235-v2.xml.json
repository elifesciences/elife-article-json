                    "text": "The bivalent hypothesis posits that genes encoding developmental regulators required for early lineage decisions are poised in stem/progenitor cells by the balance between a repressor histone modification (H3K27me3), mediated by the Polycomb Repressor Complex 2 (PRC2), and an activator modification (H3K4me3). In this study, we test whether this mechanism applies equally to genes that are not required until terminal differentiation. We focus on the RE1 Silencing Transcription Factor (REST) because it is expressed highly in stem cells and is an established global repressor of terminal neuronal genes. Elucidation of the REST complex, and comparison of chromatin marks and gene expression levels in control and REST-deficient stem cells, shows that REST target genes are poised by a mechanism independent of Polycomb, even at promoters which bear the H3K27me3 mark. Specifically, genes under REST control are actively repressed in stem cells by a balance of the H3K4me3 mark and a repressor complex that relies on histone deacetylase activity. Thus, chromatin distinctions between pro-neural and terminal neuronal genes are established at the embryonic stem cell stage by two parallel, but distinct, repressor pathways."

In this study, we test whether this mechanism applies equally to genes that are not required until terminal differentiation. We focus on the RE1 Silencing Transcription Factor (REST) because it is expressed highly in stem cells and is an established global repressor of terminal neuronal genes. Elucidation of the REST complex, and comparison of chromatin marks and gene expression levels in control and REST-deficient stem cells, shows that REST target genes are poised by a mechanism independent of Polycomb, even at promoters which bear the H3K27me3 mark. Specifically, genes under REST control are actively repressed in stem cells by a balance of the H3K4me3 mark and a repressor complex that relies on histone deacetylase activity. Thus, chromatin distinctions between pro-neural and terminal neuronal genes are established at the embryonic stem cell stage by two parallel, but distinct, repressor pathways."

Many of these genes are switched off, or repressed, by making the DNA inaccessible to the various proteins and molecules that control gene activity.

A host of proteins modify the structure of chromatin: it can be made more tightly packaged, which keeps genes switched off; or it can be made more loosely packaged, which allows the genes within to be accessed and switched on."

The repressed status, often referred to as poised, is conferred by epigenetic modifications established at loci encoding developmental regulators. Specifically, global histone modification patterns in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) have revealed the coexistence of trimethylation of histone H3 at lysines 4 and 27 (H3K4me3 and H3K27me3) at promoters of genes encoding key lineage-determining factors (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bernstein et al., 2006</a>). This dual chromatin status has been termed bivalence to reflect the juxtaposition of modifications typically associated with functionally active and transcriptionally repressed promoters, respectively. The H3K27me3 mark is established by the methyltransferase EZH2 within the Polycomb Repressor Complex 2 (PRC2) (<a href=\"#bib45\">Pengelly et al., 2013</a>), which effectively provides a counterbalance to factors that promote H3K4me3 and active expression (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bernstein et al., 2006</a>). This PRC2-dependent state has been proposed as a universal mechanism to confer pluripotency by controlling all developmental lineages, but its application to the neuronal lineage has not been tested rigorously. This is of interest because for most lineages the key developmental regulators are activators, while in the neuronal lineage a key regulator is the transcriptional repressor REST (NRSF)."

Further, REST is expressed at very high levels in embryonic stem cells, contrary to other developmental regulators. A global REST knockout results in embryonic lethality, pointing to an essential function for REST in general embryonic development following the ESC stage (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chong et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Schoenherr and Anderson, 1995</a>). In neural progenitors, REST levels decrease until it completely leaves the chromatin at terminal differentiation of most neurons. Preventing its dismissal from chromatin delays greatly neuronal maturation in vivo (<a href=\"#bib35\">Mandel et al., 2011</a>) and alters neural progenitor pool identities in vitro (<a href=\"#bib10\">Covey et al., 2012</a>). In stem/progenitor cells, developmental genes required for neuronal lineage decisions are repressed, including pro-neural and REST-regulated genes (<a href=\"#bib2\">Buckley et al., 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib5a\">Ballas et al., 2005</a>), but whether the mechanisms that regulate these classes of genes are the same or different remains an open question."

On the one hand, although the terminal neuronal genes regulated by REST are poised in stem cells, REST is itself a repressor and may not require the additional repression mechanism of Polycomb. On the other hand, the non-coding RNA (ncRNA) HOTAIR has been shown to act as an adapter between the core PRC2 component EZH2 and the REST co-factor Kdm1a (<a href=\"#bib53\">Tsai et al., 2010</a>), suggesting a connection between PRC2 and REST in ESCs. In addition, other groups have observed biochemical interaction between REST and PRC2 members (<a href=\"#bib11\">Dietrich et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Mozzetta et al., 2014</a>) and recruitment of H2K27me3 to RE1 sites (<a href=\"#bib3a\">Arnold et al., 2013</a>). Therefore, we performed three studies to test directly for the existence of a functional relationship between PRC2 and REST in ESCs. First, we performed a mass spectrometric analysis of REST complexes to identify ESC-specific co-factors in an unbiased manner. Second, we asked whether REST-occupied neuronal genes were marked by H3K27me3, and furthermore, whether PRC2 activity was compromised in <i>Rest</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> ESCs. Finally, exploiting a <i>Rest</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> ESC line, we examined the consequences of the loss of REST on chromatin marks and gene expression."

                                "text": "Previous studies of REST-interacting proteins in ESCs used a candidate approach and focused on co-factors characterized in differentiated cells (<a href=\"#bib5a\">Ballas et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Yu et al., 2011</a>). In the current study, we considered the possibility that ESC-specific co-factors might be involved in regulatory mechanisms of REST that were unique to pluripotent cells. To test this idea we performed a mass spectrometric analysis of REST complexes using a mouse ESC line that stably expressed both the biotin conjugating enzyme, BirA (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kim et al., 2009</a>), and REST tagged with a biotin acceptor sequence. The stable line expressed approximately five-fold higher levels of REST than normal ESCs with no differences in pluripotency markers compared to WT cells (not shown). Multidimensional Protein Identification Technology (MudPIT) analysis was performed on three independent streptavidin purifications. Proteins that were co-purified with REST in at least two of three pull-downs and were weakly represented, if at all, in the BirA control pull-downs are shown in <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>. None of the known epigenetic regulators identified as co-factors by mass spectrometry were specific to ESCs. However, we did identify almost all known REST co-factors including CoREST1 and Sin3a as well as the chromatin modifying enzymes, HDAC1 and 2, Kdm1a and G9a/Glp, and the G9a-associated adaptors CDYL and WIZ1, all of which have been shown biochemically to be present within REST complexes in terminally differentiated cell types (<a href=\"#bib2a\">Andres et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Grimes et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Hakimi et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Roopra et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Mulligan et al., 2008</a>), thus validating our approach. We noted that an additional CoREST family member, CoREST2, was also present in the pull-downs. We confirmed the presence of CoREST2, as well as a subset of other co-factors, at RE1 sites in ESCs by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We also identified several new factors, some with known functions (Smarca5, Mdc1) and some with no known function (D1Pas1, <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). In contrast to these factors, components of the Polycomb repressor complexes were not identified according to our criteria. It was possible that the specific conditions used to generate the whole-cell extracts used in the MudPIT analysis precluded identification of Polycomb proteins. Therefore, we repeated mass spectrometry analysis on streptavidin pull-downs from nuclear extracts (<a href=\"#bib1a\">Abmayr et al., 2006</a>). Under these conditions, we did identify the PRC2 complex members Suz12 (3 and 4 peptides in BioT REST pull-down replicates, 0 and 0 peptides in Control) and Ezh2 (3 and 5 peptides in BioT REST, 0 and 0 peptides in Control). Co-immunoprecipitation analysis using nuclear extract confirmed only the Suz12 interaction, as well as the interactions with known REST co-repressors (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). Importantly, however, the members of the PRC2 complex required for the methyltransferase activity, Ezh2, and for complex formation, Eed (<a href=\"#bib38\">Montgomery et al., 2005</a>), were both absent from the co-immunoprecipitation (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). These results indicate that REST protein does not interact with an enzymatically active PRC2 complex in ESCs. To supplement this proteomic approach, and as an independent test for the role of PRC2 members in REST regulation, we used a genome-wide ChIP-seq approach."

                                "text": "A Polycomb complex was not represented in our analysis of REST complexes, but it was possible that the streptavidin pull-downs might not co-purify ncRNA-mediated associations. Therefore, we compared the genomic distributions of REST and H3K27me3 enrichment to determine whether PRC2 is recruited to REST-bound sites in ESCs. 2136 genomic regions targeted by REST were identified by our ChIP-seq in mouse ESCs, which is comparable to prior REST ChIP-seq studies in human T cells (<a href=\"#bib21\">Johnson et al., 2007</a>) and a different mouse ESC line (<a href=\"#bib22\">Johnson et al., 2008</a>). The DNA sequence of REST-bound regions was analyzed and 96.6% (2064 REST-bound sites) contained either the complete or partial consensus RE1 sequence motif (<a href=\"#bib43\">Otto et al., 2007</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>). This sequence analysis also showed that the RE1 sequence is the central determinant for REST recruitment because regions with the highest enrichment contained multiple repeats of complete RE1 sites aligned with the same strand orientation (<a href=\"#bib66\">Zhang et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Jothi et al., 2008</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>). Conversely, regions that contained a single right half of the RE1 motif were associated with low levels of enrichment (<a href=\"#bib43\">Otto et al., 2007</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>). REST-binding and relative enrichment indicated by ChIP-seq were confirmed by ChIP-quantitative PCR analysis for a subset of loci (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3C</a>). Although ncRNA-mediated interactions linking REST to PRC2-bound chromatin have been proposed (<a href=\"#bib53\">Tsai et al., 2010</a>), the strong correlation between REST-binding and RE1 DNA sequences suggests that any alternative mechanisms of stable recruitment to chromatin were not prevalent in ESCs. This did not preclude, however, the inverse possibility that REST could recruit PRC2 to chromatin adjacent to RE1 sites. However, assessment of H3K27me3 domains showed that only a small minority (\u223c3%) of REST-bound sites were associated with significant enrichment of H3K27me3 relative to input, and only 0.5% of H3K27me3-enriched domains were associated with REST binding (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Even if the effective footprint of REST sites was extended 1 kb in both directions, the proportion overlapping with H3K27me3 peaks was only 12.6% of REST peaks and 2.3% of H3K27me3 peaks. Furthermore, our own analysis of ChIP-seq results published previously show that the PRC2 factors Suz12 and Ezh2 bind at extremely low levels, if at all, at REST sites relative to sites of H3K27me3 enrichment (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). None of these data sets supports a strong functional connection between these distinct complexes, or between RE1 sites and PRC2, in ESCs."

In the small number of instances where H3K27me3 levels did change, some genes lost H3K27me3 in <i>Rest</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> ESCs, including Scn8a, Galnt9, and Vgf (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a> and <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>), while other genes, including Dner, Otop3, and Cacng2, gained H3K27me3 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a> and <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). The losses and gains were validated by quantitative ChIP-PCR (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). The HoxA11 and Oct4 genes, which are not bound by REST in ESCs, represent positive and negative controls for the H3K27me3 mark, respectively. The occupancy of EZH2 at these same regions was altered similar to H3K27me3 (<a href=\"#fig1s5\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). These results taken together indicated that REST was not required for establishment or maintenance of H3K27me3, throughout the genome generally or at loci targeted by REST specifically. However, in a very limited number of cases, H3K27me3 was lost in <i>Rest</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> ESCs, reflecting either direct or indirect influence of REST on PRC2-binding. The increase in H3K27me3 at select sites may reflect block of PRC2 binding by REST due to close proximity of their binding sites. Why certain dually occupied genes lost or gained H3K27me3 in response to loss of REST was not obvious based on the function of the encoded proteins, but could be related to the timing of expression in vivo."

Having shown that the REST and Polycomb pathways were largely independent, we asked which REST-dependent chromatin marks at the ESC stage might influence transcript levels of these targets. To this end, we performed a multiple regression analysis to determine which chromatin changes due to the loss of REST at the ESC stage were most likely associated with the observed expression changes. From this analysis, only the chromatin mark H3K4me3 correlated significantly with the expression changes observed in <i>Rest</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> ESCs (p &lt;0 0.02, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). Further support for the importance of the H3K4me3 mark at REST targets is provided by the absolute levels of expression of REST target genes when categorized as above. Specifically, genes occupied by REST, marked either by just H3K4me3 or by H3K4me3 together with H3K27me3, show significantly lower expression levels than non-REST target genes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>, p &lt; 0.001 and p &lt; 0.05, respectively). When REST is deleted from ESCs, the expression levels of these H3K4me3-marked REST target genes are increased and approaches that of non-target H3K4me3-marked genes. This REST-dependent repression of H3K4me3-enriched promoters suggests that one of the primary functions of REST in ESCs is to counter RNA Pol II recruitment and maintenance of this activating mark."

To identify the mechanism for the increases in H3K4me3 after the loss of the REST complex, we monitored H3K4me3 levels at REST sites in ESCs that were mutant for the co-repressors G9a, Kdm1a, or HDACs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). We used the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin-A (TSA) as a proxy for HDAC loss, due to the redundancy of HDAC family members (<a href=\"#bib39\">Montgomery et al., 2007</a>). Only TSA treatment correlated significantly with increased H3K4me3 (p &lt; 0.01, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), consistent with previous studies that have indicated a negative interaction between de-acetylation at lysine 9 by HDAC activity and trimethylation at lysine 4 (<a href=\"#bib4\">Lee at al., 2006b</a>). As expected, we also observed elevated acetylated H3K9 levels at RE1 sites after TSA treatment (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Additionally, we utilized gene expression data sets published previously to analyze the transcriptional consequences of co-repressor removal. This analysis revealed that REST targets are de-repressed only in the absence of HDAC activity, but not when G9a and Kdm1a are mutated (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). By focusing on those genes for which we observed H3K4me3 effects, we also found a significant correlation between the magnitude of the change in RNA levels when REST is deleted and that when histone deacetylase activity is strongly inhibited by TSA (p &lt; 0.005, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). These results suggest that REST repression in ESCs is mediated primarily by recruited HDACs that serve as a counterbalance to H3K4me3 levels and basal RNA polymerase II activity, although the nature of the cross-talk between HDACs and H3K4 trimethylation in this context awaits future investigation."

However, a study on early zebra fish embryos showed that only 36% of inactive gene promoters were associated with a bivalent histone modification pattern, while 28% exhibited enrichment of H3K4me3 alone, yet remained inactive (<a href=\"#bib55\">Vastenhouw et al., 2010</a>). This suggests that in addition to PRC2, alternative repressor mechanisms exist for recruiting chromatin modifiers to poised genes, although such proteins have not been identified. We propose that the REST/HDAC repressor mechanism represents one such alternative mechanism for genes in the neuronal lineage. By extension, our results indicate that both neuronal cell fate determining genes and neuronal genes expressed later in the differentiation program are poised in ESCs, albeit by different mechanisms."

The first class, lacking trimethylation, was preferentially located distal to promoter regions. Preliminary studies on these distal sites show that some overlap with the enhancer mark H3K4me1 and/or H3K27ac (data not shown), potentially indicating a role for REST-directed repression at specified distal enhancer regions, an intriguing hypothesis that awaits future analysis. However, because it is currently unclear which promoters/genes these distal sites regulate, we focused on the other two subclasses, which were located within 20 kb of annotated TSSs. The majority of these REST-associated regions were enriched for H3K4me3, consistent with our idea that the balance of REST-recruited HDACs and H3K4me3 was sufficient to poise neuronal genes independent of Polycomb."

Additionally, a previous report that the ncRNA HOTAIR can link REST and PRC2 suggested that ncRNA-mediated interactions in ESCs could result in PRC2 recruitment to REST-bound RE1 sites, and conversely, that REST complexes could be recruited to PRC2 bound regions independent from recognition of the RE1 motif (<a href=\"#bib53\">Tsai et al., 2010</a>). Our results are not consistent with either of these scenarios. First, REST-binding sites within the ESC genome appeared to be dependent exclusively on the underlying DNA sequence, because REST binding was correlated strictly with the presence of RE1 motifs. Second, the Polycomb complex member Eed, which is required for H3K27me3 deposition (<a href=\"#bib38\">Montgomery et al., 2005</a>), was absent from the REST complexes characterized by mass spectrometry and co-immunoprecipitation, undermining the likelihood of either repressive complex directly targeting the other. Third, only a minority of REST-bound sites was associated with H3K27me3 enrichment and PRC2 localization (\u223c3%). Moreover, H3K27me3 was not preferentially enriched at regions with multiple RE1 sites and thus did not show strong association with REST. Finally, more than 97% of the RE1 sites associated with PRC2 in wild-type cells also showed H3K27me3 enrichment in <i>Rest</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> ESCs, including at gene promoters, indicating that REST was not required for PRC2 recruitment at these regions. Taken together, we conclude that REST and PRC2 act largely independently, even at shared target genes, in ESCs."

Therefore, we considered the possibility that the small subclass of REST/PRC2 targets might represent a specialized set of genes for promoting neural development. Gene ontology analysis, however, revealed no apparent distinction between biological functions in this subclass and the biological functions associated with the REST pattern alone. Both subclasses contained genes known to influence neurodevelopment, many of which persist in the adult nervous system, as well as other categories considered to be late neuronal genes involved in mature neuronal function, such as synaptic components and voltage-gated channels. Thus, PRC2 does not specifically target regulators of neurodevelopment within the REST-regulated network of genes."

A critical distinction is that our analysis defined H3K27me3-enriched regions before comparing the computed H3K27me3 signals between WT and <i>Rest</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> ESCs. By applying this initial binary condition, our analysis avoids the contribution of fluctuations in background signal. We argue that comparing the computed H3K27me3 ChIP-seq signals at all REST sites without considering initial H3K27me3 background signal would always find some level of relationship between REST and PRC2 and therefore eliminate the null hypothesis a priori. Therefore, we limited our comparisons of H3K27me3 domains to regions that also showed the clear presence of PRC2 activity in WT ESCs. Additionally, the loss of REST may generate small but reproducible effects in measured histone modifications due to local changes in nucleosome density, rather than actual changes in a specific modification (<a href=\"#bib68\">Zheng et al., 2009</a>). Similar to a recent study that showed the presence of REST evicts nucleosomes at RE1 DNA sequence motifs (<a href=\"#bib54\">Valouev et al., 2011</a>), we evaluated in vivo nucleosome positioning in ESCs and found that phasing of nucleosomes centered at RE1 motifs was displaced in <i>Rest</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> cells (data not shown). Therefore, although it can appear that PRC2 activity is increased specifically at RE1 sites by the loss of REST (<a href=\"#bib11\">Dietrich et al., 2012</a>); this likely reflects a secondary consequence of the gain of a nucleosome at the RE1 site, due to the loss of the REST protein and subsequent fill-in of its footprint by a single histone octamer. How REST-associated nucleosome positioning generally affects gene expression is not yet known, but there are well-documented examples in lower eukaryotes of dynamic nucleosome positioning as a mechanism of gene regulation (<a href=\"#bib4a\">Bai and Morozov, 2010</a>)."

Acetylated histone tails have been shown to interact with bromodomains of transcription factors, such as Brd4, which promotes recruitment of Mediator complexes or positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) and release of paused RNA Pol II (<a href=\"#bib20\">Jang et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Yang et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Wu and Chiang, 2007</a>).

However, changes in the H3K4me3 mark (and histone acetylation) due to the loss of REST were significantly correlated with changes in gene expression, while the other histone modifications we analyzed were not. This suggests that REST-directed repression of H3K4 methyltransferases or activation of H3K4me3 demethylases is important to restrict the amount of expression from these genes. A potential candidate demethylase is SMCX (Jarid1C), which binds REST in HeLa cells and can regulate promoter H3K4me3 levels (<a href=\"#bib52\">Tahiliani et al., 2007</a>), although we found no evidence of SMCX binding in our mass spectrometry results. In addition, there is evidence that H3K4me3 \u2018primes\u2019 non-expressed genes for acetylation and increased gene expression after histone deacetylase loss (<a href=\"#bib58\">Wang et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Lopez-Atalaya et al., 2013</a>). Thus, as neuronal differentiation proceeds and REST/HDAC levels on target chromatin decrease dramatically, those genes previously marked with H3K4me3 increase this mark simultaneously with H3K9 acetylation in a rapid feed-forward mechanism."

A recent study has suggested that structural genes encoding mature cardiac cell functions are regulated primarily by transcriptional activators rather than by H3K27me3 (<a href=\"#bib44\">Paige et al., 2012</a>). An alternative possibility, based on our study, is that these temporally delayed cardiac genes are repressed by factors, still to be identified, which recruit chromatin modifiers other than Ezh2 in order to balance the activation mark in stem cells. In neurons, direct reprogramming can occur by introducing pro-neural (Ascl1) along with terminal genes (e.g. Myt1l) into somatic cells (<a href=\"#bib56\">Vierbuchen et al., 2010</a>) perhaps because they represent distinct regulatory pathways. Better knowledge of the factors regulating terminally differentiated gene chromatin could provide insight into the mechanisms underlying direct reprogramming of fibroblasts into different types of cells (<a href=\"#bib42\">Nam et al., 2013</a>)."

Peptides from each pull-down sample were pressure-loaded onto a 250 \u00b5m i.d. fused silica capillary column packed with a 3 cm, 5 \u00b5m Partisphere strong cation exchanger (SCX, Whatman, Clifton, NJ) and a 3 cm, 10 \u00b5m Aqua reversed-phase C18 material (Phenomenex, Ventura, CA), with the SCX end fritted with immobilized Kasil 1624 (PQ Corperation, Valley forge, PA). After desalting, a 100 \u00b5m i.d. capillary with a 5 \u00b5m pulled tip packed with a 10 cm, 54 \u00b5m Aqua C18 material was attached to a ZDV union, and the entire split-column was placed inline with an Agilent 1100 quaternary HPLC (Agilent, Palo Alto, CA) and analyzed using a modified, six-step multi-dimensional protein identification technology (MudPIT) described previously (<a href=\"#bib59\">Washburn et al., 2001</a>). As the peptides were eluted from the microcapillary column, they were electrosprayed directly into an LTQ linear ion trap mass spectrometer (ThermoFinnigan, San Jose, CA) with the application of a distal 2.5 kV spray voltage. A cycle of one full-scan mass spectrum (400\u20131400 m/z) followed by 5 data dependent MS/MS scan at a 35% normalized collision energy was repeated continuously throughout each step of the multidimensional separation. The resulting MS/MS spectra were searched with the SEQUEST algorithm (<a href=\"#bib15\">Griffin et al., 1995</a>) against a mouse IPI database (version 3.30, released at 28 June 2007) that was concatenated to a decoy database in which the sequence for each entry in the original database was reversed. The search parameters include a static cysteine modification of 57 amu and no trypsin specificity. The database search results were assembled and filtered using the DTASelect program (<a href=\"#bib51\">Tabb et al., 2002</a>) requiring a protein level false discovery rate less than 1%, all peptides identified are required to be tryptic, and at least two peptides are required for a protein to be identified. Under such filtering conditions, no peptide hit from the reverse database was found."

Briefly, cells were treated with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at RT to form protein\u2013DNA crosslinks. Crosslinking reaction was quenched by addition of glycine to a final concentration of 0.125 M and incubating for 5 min at RT, followed by two washes with PBS. Harvested cells were resuspended in nuclei isolation buffer (5 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, 85 mM KCl, and 0.5% Triton X-100) and incubated for 10 min on ice. Pelleted nuclei were resuspended in nuclei lysis buffer (50 mM Tris\u2013HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mM EDTA, and 1% SDS) at an approximate concentration of 10<sup>7</sup> cells per ml prior to shearing chromatin by sonication to a final size range of \u223c100\u2013750 bp. Chromatin lysate was diluted 1:10 with ChIP dilution buffer and specific antibodies were added for overnight incubation at 4\u00b0C. The following antibodies were used for immunoprecipitations: anti-H3K4me3 (07-473; Millipore), anti-Ac-H3K9 (H9286; Sigma), anti-2Me-H3K9 (ab1220; Abcam), anti-H3K27me3 (9733; Cell Signaling), anti-H3 (2650; Cell Signaling), anti-REST-C (<a href=\"#bib5a\">Ballas et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Otto et al., 2007</a>), anti-Ezh2 (5246; Cell Signaling), LSD1 (Kdm1a) antibody from Yang Shi (Harvard Medical School). Protein A conjugated magnetic beads that had been blocked with BSA were used to purify immunocomplexed chromatin fragments by incubating with sample lysates for 3 hr at 4\u00b0C. Beads were sequentially resuspended in low salt, high salt, and LiCl wash buffers followed by two final washes in TE buffer.

PCR amplification was run for 12\u201314 cycles with primers complementary to adapter sequence to amplify the pool of ChIP DNA with addition of the adapter sequence. PCR products in the range of 200\u2013300 bp were isolated by agarose gel electrophoresis followed by gel extraction. 5 ng of sheared DNA purified from chromatin samples without immunoprecipitation was also processed in this manner as an input control. DNA fragments were sequenced using the Illumina Genome Analyzer II platform. The number of unique reads aligned to the mm9 assembly for each ChIP-Seq was: REST (WT ESC) 11,954,736, H3K27me3 (WT ESC) 17,893,323, H3K27me3 (<i>Rest</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> ESC) 14,102,052, and Input (WT ESC) 12,092,824. Raw reads were aligned with Bowtie and only uniquely mapped reads were kept. After alignment, PeakRanger (<a href=\"#bib12\">Feng et al., 2011</a>) and MACS (<a href=\"#bib67\">Zhang et al., 2008</a>) were used to call peaks and the overlap peak set was retained. Overlapped regions may have different boundaries. To identify H3K27me3 peaks conserved between cell lines and called by independent means, we used only those MACS-called peaks that overlapped between our H3K27me3 peak set and those identified by the Encode project (<a href=\"#bib14\">Grant et al., 2011</a>). To find the genomic regions with increased levels of H3K27me3 after REST knock out, the H3K27me3 ChIP in REST knock-out is used as the \u2018treatment\u2019 and H3K27me3 ChIP in wild-type as the \u2018control\u2019 for both of the two software programs and the same significance threshold was set for both. The data sets were then swapped and analyzed for regions with decreased levels of H3K27me3. To get the reads for histograms shown in <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>, the \u2018wig\u2019 module of PeakRanger parsed all aligned reads and counted reads within the specified regions. To find the REST-binding motif (RE1), REST peak coordinates were used as input for FIMO (<a href=\"#bib14\">Grant et al., 2011</a>). Previously published ChIP-seq data sets used in the analysis of H3K27me3 were GSE51006 (<a href=\"#bib13\">Ferrari et al., 2014</a>), GSE48172 (<a href=\"#bib19\">Hu et al., 2013</a>), GSE27341 (<a href=\"#bib3a\">Arnold et al., 2013</a>), and GSE49431 (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kaneko et al., 2013</a>).

In this manuscript the authors describe their attempt to see if there is a link between PRC2 and REST and test the idea of whether these two repressive complexes are working synergistically or in tandem to maintain a more ES cell-like fate and prevent the expression of neuronal genes. The authors used a variety of approaches to identify ESC-specific factors associated with REST, the relationship between H3K27me3 and REST occupancy at target genes and the biological relevance of the loss of REST during differentiation."

More rigorous biochemical purification would benefit the authors in their search for the missing deacetylase, therefore either increasing the number of ESC plates used in the purification should improve the identification of novel factors or the authors should try a different tandem affinity purification strategy to improve the identification of interacting proteins."

Silencing of lineage specific genes in ESCs is often performed by the Polycomb group of proteins. Yet the promoters of those genes are frequently decorated with Polycomb-specific marks (H3K27me3) as well as with active marks (H3K4me3) and are referred to as \u201cbivalent promoters\u201d. Previous works have highlighted the synergistic actions of Polycomb and REST in different cellular model systems (including ESCs; see Science 329, 689, 2010; MCB 31, 2100, 2011; PLOS Gen 8, e1002494, 2011). Oyer and collaborators now report here that the vast majority of REST target genes are not decorated with H3K27me3, and that MS analyses have suggested that Polycomb proteins and REST are not part of the same complex, thus challenging the notion that Polycomb and REST act together in the regulation of neuronal specific genes. They favor a model in which REST acts in combination with HDAC, G9A and KDM1a. Although this topic is of great interest, I find that many of the authors' conclusions are not well supported by the experimental data presented. More stringent and appropriate controls, and more experimental settings, may help to solidify their conclusions."

This is an important question because Polycomb has been reported as a general modulator of lineage control in pluripotent cells. As such, many studies focus just on this complex to understand how genes are globally repressed in pluripotency. We provided evidence indicating that the repressor REST is equally efficacious in this role and likely works independently and in parallel for genes expressed in the neuronal lineage. Two of the reviewers indicated that more work was required to substantiate our conclusions, and the editors requested submission of a new manuscript addressing these concerns. We took time to repeat a mass spectrometry study under different conditions, performed new RNA-seq analysis, re-did some of the bioinformatics, and added other new experiments as well. Consequently, this is a much more in-depth and solidified study than the original work and still contains, we feel, the novelty component expected for <i>eLife</i>."

Unfortunately, in two biological replicates of the nuclear extract mass spec analysis, we identified primarily nucleolar proteins and no peptides of known REST cofactors, including Rcor1, LSD1/Kdm1a, or G9a, which have been published by several labs as an integral part of a bona fide REST complex and which we identified readily with our previous method. Indeed, to our knowledge no one has identified REST interactors with a REST pull-down using the Dignam method. Therefore, to further test our negative result from the MudPiT analysis we performed a candidate co-immunoprecipitation analysis using nuclear extracts that was not included in the previous submission to confirm these potential interactions. The co-immunoprecipitation analysis confirmed binding of the known interactors of REST but it also identified members of the PRC2 complex Suz12 and Jarid2. However, neither Eed nor Ezh2 were present in the REST pull-downs with this method (new <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2013figure supplement 2A</a>). The lack of Eed and Ezh2 is entirely consistent with the lack of REST binding sites marked with H3K27me3, as they are both required for deposition of the H3K27me3 mark. We have included the new results and a discussion of the findings. Finally, we are not sure which deacetylase the reviewer refers to as missing? Perhaps he meant the H3K4me3 demethylase? If the latter, it did not turn up in either of our mass spec analysis methods, indicating that this may be an indirect effect of REST-directed HDAC activity."

We preferred this over the HDAC1/2 knock down experiment because knock down of HDACs is likely to be partial, and we are not sure how we would interpret a negative result. In addition, HDAC1/2 double knockout ESCs shows a profound loss of cell viability (Dovey et al, 2014, PNAS). However, after deletion, these cells show increases in H3K9 acetylation that are similar to those observed in our TSA treated cells. In addition, this report also shows de-repression of several canonical REST targets including neuronal \u03b2 tubulin, synapsin, and VGF, consistent with our results.

We believe that there is substantial novelty in this work from the point of view of testing the idea, firm in the literature, that Polycomb bivalency is a good proxy for identifying poised genes in all lineages in pluripotent embryonic stem cells, and that PRC2 is required for poising of neuronal genes regulated by REST. In addition, many studies would suggest that simply the presence of polycomb proteins on a site infers repression, and for that reason other repressor mechanisms have been ignored. There are not many repressors that could provide good tests of the bivalent model because the complete set of targets have not been identified, and so it is not easy to discriminate functional significance of the binding. REST is unique: it binds to a unique sequence that allows identity of the binding sites both bioinformatically and by ChIP; the gene targets represent a large set of proteins that are essential for terminal neuronal differentiation, a specific transition during differentiation; and REST is present in ESCs, where these targets are repressed, and minimally expressed at terminal differentiation. Our study shows that Polycomb bivalency is not a general mechanism for poising genes: rather, poising may simply be an active repression mechanism conducted by any repressor (exemplified in this study by REST) balancing RNA Pol II activity, indicated by the H3K4me3 mark. Further, in the neuronal lineage, PRC2 represses proneural genes (<a href=\"#bib37\">Mohn et al, 2008</a>, Mol. Cell, and Burgold et al, 2008, PLoS One), which are not REST targets as identified in our REST ChIP-seq analysis, while REST mediates repression of the later caste of genes required for terminal differentiation, which is a quite considerable number. Our study also demonstrates that in ESCs, the presence of the H3K27me3 mark does not necessarily equate with PRC2-based repression, as we find de-repression after loss of REST even at REST targets that also contain the H3K27me3 mark (e.g. of Calb1 and Glra1 genes). This is an important point and may explain the lack of de-repression observed at some H3K27me3-marked genes in PRC2 mutant cells (Shen et al, 2008, Mol. Cell). We hope the reviewer is more convinced of the novelty component in the new submission."

First, we now show a strong correlation between the changes in H3K4me3 due to loss of REST and those due to TSA addition at the specific promoters we have analyzed (new <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). This correlation suggests that TSA treatment is affecting H3K4me3 levels similarly to loss of REST. Second, we found that a microarray published previously treating ESCs with TSA shows de-repression specifically at REST target genes (new <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>), albeit at lower levels than from loss of REST. Finally, we show that for the genes we analyzed, the change in expression due to TSA treatment was highly correlated with the change in expression due to loss of REST (new <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). While none of these data prove a direct link between REST, histone deacetylases, H3K4me3, and expression, they all strongly support the model whereby the REST/HDAC complex antagonizes the H3K4me3 mark and subsequent transcription. We have rewritten the Results and Discussion to reflect this idea."
