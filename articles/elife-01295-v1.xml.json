                    "text": "In fibroblasts, large Ca transients activate massive endocytosis (MEND) that involves membrane protein palmitoylation subsequent to mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP) openings. Here, we characterize this pathway in cardiac muscle. Myocytes with increased expression of the acyl transferase, DHHC5, have decreased Na/K pump activity. In DHHC5-deficient myocytes, Na/K pump activity and surface area/volume ratios are increased, the palmitoylated regulatory protein, phospholemman (PLM), and the cardiac Na/Ca exchanger (NCX1) show greater surface membrane localization, and MEND is inhibited in four protocols. Both electrical and optical methods demonstrate that PTP-dependent MEND occurs during reoxygenation of anoxic hearts. Post-anoxia MEND is ablated in DHHC5-deficient hearts, inhibited by cyclosporine A (CsA) and adenosine, promoted by staurosporine (STS), reduced in hearts lacking PLM, and correlates with impaired post-anoxia contractile function. Thus, the MEND pathway appears to be deleterious in severe oxidative stress but may constitutively contribute to cardiac sarcolemma turnover in dependence on metabolic stress."

Here, we characterize this pathway in cardiac muscle. Myocytes with increased expression of the acyl transferase, DHHC5, have decreased Na/K pump activity. In DHHC5-deficient myocytes, Na/K pump activity and surface area/volume ratios are increased, the palmitoylated regulatory protein, phospholemman (PLM), and the cardiac Na/Ca exchanger (NCX1) show greater surface membrane localization, and MEND is inhibited in four protocols. Both electrical and optical methods demonstrate that PTP-dependent MEND occurs during reoxygenation of anoxic hearts. Post-anoxia MEND is ablated in DHHC5-deficient hearts, inhibited by cyclosporine A (CsA) and adenosine, promoted by staurosporine (STS), reduced in hearts lacking PLM, and correlates with impaired post-anoxia contractile function. Thus, the MEND pathway appears to be deleterious in severe oxidative stress but may constitutively contribute to cardiac sarcolemma turnover in dependence on metabolic stress."

Most forms of endocytosis involve a much smaller fraction of the cell membrane and employ a set of well-known endocytic proteins that are not involved in massive endocytosis.

Lin et al. also find that an enzyme called DHHC5 must be present to allow endocytosis to take place during reoxygenation. DHHC5 is an enzyme that catalyzes a process called acylation \u2013 the transfer of acyl groups to proteins at the cell surface. Moreover, the deletion of DHHC5 has a beneficial impact on the performance of cardiac muscle after oxygen deprivation, which implies that molecules that inhibit protein acylation might protect the heart from damage during reoxygenation. Together, these results establish new pathological and physiological roles for the acylation, which is one of the most common biochemical modifications made to membrane proteins after they are synthesized."

Ironically, much of the damage from ischemic events can occur during reoxygenation of tissue when mitochondria begin to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) at increased rates (<a href=\"#bib28\">Jennings, 2013</a>). One of the hallmarks of reperfusion injury is a pronounced swelling of mitochondria, and the extensive opening of mitochondrial permeability transition pores (PTPs) that underlies this swelling (<a href=\"#bib23\">Haworth and Hunter, 1979</a>) is a nearly decisive step on the path to cell demise (<a href=\"#bib22\">Halestrap et al., 2004</a>).

Therefore, the question arises whether, besides cytochrome c, other molecules released from mitochondria might serve signaling functions. Our analysis of Ca-activated endocytosis in BHK fibroblasts (<a href=\"#bib24\">Hilgemann et al., 2013</a>) suggests that mitochondrial release of coenzyme A (CoA) may be important. This hypothesis arises from two facts. First, mitochondria accumulate CoA to high concentrations with respect to the cytoplasm (<a href=\"#bib32\">Leonardi et al., 2005</a>). Second, many key cytoplasmic enzymes are modulated by binding long-chain acyl CoA (<a href=\"#bib13\">Faergeman and Knudsen, 1997</a>), a CoA metabolite that will be generated immediately if CoA is released (<a href=\"#bib27\">Idell-Wenger et al., 1978</a>). These include glycogen synthase (<a href=\"#bib49\">Wititsuwannakul and Kim, 1977</a>), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (<a href=\"#bib29\">Kawaguchi and Bloch, 1974</a>), and perhaps AMP kinase (<a href=\"#bib13\">Faergeman and Knudsen, 1997</a>), as well as KATP potassium channels (<a href=\"#bib45\">Shumilina et al., 2006</a>). Our study in BHK cells (<a href=\"#bib24\">Hilgemann et al., 2013</a>) suggests that release of CoA from mitochondria may promote the palmitoylation of surface membrane proteins, subsequent to generation of acyl CoA. Further, our study suggests that extensive palmitoylation promotes internalization of membrane as a form of \u2018lipid raft\u2019-dependent endocytosis (<a href=\"#bib12\">Doherty and McMahon, 2009</a>)."

In this light, a possibility emerges that cytoplasmic free CoA could physiologically play important second messenger functions in dependence on its release from mitochondria. On the one hand, mitochondrial depolarization will favor reverse CoA transport to the cytoplasm (<a href=\"#bib46\">Tahiliani, 1991</a>), and on the other hand transient PTP openings may allow enough CoA to escape from the matrix space, down its more than 50-to-1 gradient, to significantly increase the low micromolar concentration of free cytoplasmic CoA (<a href=\"#bib27\">Idell-Wenger et al., 1978</a>)."

First, Na/K pumps are high density transmembrane protein complexes in the cardiac sarcolemma whose activity strongly modulates cardiac function (<a href=\"#bib25\">Hilgemann, 2004</a>). As such, Na/K pumps likely represent a large fraction of membrane particles that have been visualized in freeze fracture studies and that cluster and decrease in number during anoxia/reoxygenation episodes (<a href=\"#bib17\">Frank et al., 1980</a>). Second, it was described almost 40 years ago that the number of Na/K pumps, quantified as ouabain binding sites, decreases markedly during ischemia/reperfusion events (<a href=\"#bib4\">Beller et al., 1976</a>). Recently, it has been shown that Na/K pumps are indeed internalized via endocytosis in a cardiac myocyte culture during \u2018simulated\u2019 ischemia/reperfusion (<a href=\"#bib5\">Belliard et al., 2012</a>), and internalization still occurs during metabolic stress when a di-leucine motif of Na/K pump alpha subunits has been mutated to prevent pump involvement in conventional, clathrin-dependent trafficking (<a href=\"#bib39\">Pierre et al., 2010</a>). Third, extensive internalization of Na/K pumps also occurs in response to metabolic stress in several other cell types (<a href=\"#bib35\">Mandel et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bortner et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Brown et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Mann et al., 2001</a>). In alveolar epithelia the reversible internalization of Na/K pumps in hypoxia is initiated by ROS generation and the activation of protein kinase Cs (PKCs) (<a href=\"#bib11\">Dada et al., 2003</a>), details that are reminiscent of our findings that PKCs and ROS promote MEND in BHK cells (<a href=\"#bib24\">Hilgemann et al., 2013</a>). Fourth, the FXYD subunits of Na/K pumps can be dually palmitoylated and depalmitoylated at the surface membrane, and we have shown that overexpression of the major FXYD protein of cardiac muscle, phospholemman (PLM), promotes the occurrence of MEND in a PKC-dependent fashion in a TReX-293 cell line (<a href=\"#bib24\">Hilgemann et al., 2013</a>)."

In results presented, we employ this non-invasive C<sub>m</sub> (NIC) recording technique with superfused right ventricular strips (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). Briefly, NIC recording exploits the fact that myocyte sarcolemma constitutes the great majority of cellular surface membrane in the heart (<a href=\"#bib2\">Banerjee et al., 2007</a>). Although non-myocytes can be as numerous as myocytes, all non-myocytes are much smaller than myocytes. Similar to skeletal muscle, therefore (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cole, 1976</a>), rapid extracellular voltage oscillations (15 kHz/1 mV) can be used to monitor the composite sarcolemmal C<sub>m</sub>. The use of this <i>on-line</i> method allowed us to rapidly test for the occurrence of MEND in intact cardiac tissue. As described subsequently, we have verified all findings from NIC recording with independent methods, specifically via an optical method in intact hearts to follow fluid phase uptake of fluorescent probes and via patch clamp of isolated myocytes. Additional results that validate NIC recording are provided in \u2018Material and methods\u2019."

Subsequently, epicardial myocytes were imaged several cell layers below the outer cardiac surface; the outer most myocytes were excluded because they are atypical, being enriched in cardiac stem cells (<a href=\"#bib42\">Schlueter and Brand, 2012</a>). Hearts perfused with FA\u2014free albumin reveal diffuse staining of a limited fraction of myocytes. This reflects nonspecific dextran uptake as a result of reperfusion stress. Hearts perfused with FA reveal, in addition to diffuse staining of a fraction of myocytes, bright punctate staining that is indicative of dextran uptake into large endosomes and vacuoles. Punctate staining becomes very profuse in hearts perfused with STS (0.1 \u03bcM) and is absent when CsA (3 \u03bcM) is perfused with albumin and FA. Statistical analysis, performed as described in Methods, is provided in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>, together with the additional result that dextran uptake was negligible in the same protocol in ventricles from DHHC5-GT mice."

In this light, Na/K pump activity changes caused by modifying DHHC5 and DHHC2 expression (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1 and 2</a>) appear relevant to the physiological, long-term control of basal cardiac contractility. It is certain that palmitoylation of the regulatory pump subunit, PLM, can cause pump inhibition (<a href=\"#bib47\">Tulloch et al., 2011</a>). We have shown here, however, that the surface membrane fraction of PLM is increased by approximately the same extent as Na/K pump activity (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>) in DHHC5-deficient myocytes. Furthermore, myocyte surface area/volume ratios are significantly increased. Analysis of ion channel and excitation-contraction coupling function are now required to define more clearly the roles of DHHC5 and DHHC2 in myocytes. However, the present results strongly suggest that DHHC5 activity modulates Na/K pump densities in cardiac myocytes by modifying pump internalization rates. In this connection, the fate of membrane internalized by DHHC5-dependent endocytosis remains to be determined. One possibility is that the pathway delivers surface membrane to autophagosomes (<a href=\"#bib37\">Moreau and Rubinsztein, 2012</a>). That MEND responses are reduced in PLM-deficient cardiac tissue (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>) correlates well with the fact that MEND is enhanced when PLM is overexpressed in a model cell (<a href=\"#bib24\">Hilgemann et al., 2013</a>). Therewith, a significant mechanistic involvement of Na/K pumps in the progression of MEND has been established. Clearly, proteomic analyses of palmitoylation by mass spectroscopy will be essential to evaluate the overall cellular scope of the MEND response."

                                "text": "It is certain that mechanisms besides palmitoylation are sufficient to cause MEND in BHK cells. For example, extracellular lysolipids and sphingomyelinase C activities can cause MEND responses that are equivalent in magnitude to Ca-activated MEND (<a href=\"#bib31\">Lariccia et al., 2011</a>). In our experience, these different mechanisms act synergistically, and the generation of submicoscopic membrane phase transitions appears to be the convergent effect that precedes endocytosis (<a href=\"#bib26\">Hilgemann and Fine, 2011</a>). In the present study as well, it is likely that some MEND responses reflect synergistic effects of multiple mechanisms. As shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3 and 4</a>, the occurrence of MEND in four different protocols is strongly inhibited in DHHC5-deficient myoctytes and therefore depends on palmitoylation. MEND occurs over one to several minutes in response to PTP-promoting metabolites, over several minutes in response to transient H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced oxidative stress, over 30 min in response to a GPCR agonist, phenylephrine, which activates GPCRs and subsequently PKCs, and over a few seconds when Ca transients are activated. In contrast to the delayed MEND responses that occur in BHK cells (<a href=\"#bib24\">Hilgemann et al., 2013</a>), Ca transients cause immediate MEND responses in myocytes. These responses, which may represent myocyte wounding responses, are blunted in DHHC5-deficient myocytes when they are activated by moderate Ca transients. However, the explosive responses that occur when Ca transients are large (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>) are unaffected by acute inhibition of DHHC5 activity. Thus, the palmitoylation state of myocytes promotes Ca-activated MEND, but Ca can cause MEND by a mechanism unrelated to DHHC activity. In contrast, myocyte MEND responses to transient oxidative stress and to phenylephrine require an immediate presence of cytoplasmic acyl Co A and therefore are likely to involve palmitoylation as they develop. In the case of MEND induced by KSP solution, we cannot discount at this time that mitochondrial Ca release is playing some role."

It is prevented by agents that precondition hearts against reoxygenation damage, namely adenosine and CsA, and it is promoted by low concentrations of staurosporine that promote reoxygenation damage (<a href=\"#bib43\">Schneider, 2005</a>). The results together suggest that MEND responses occurring during reoxygenation may be relevant to human ischemia/reperfusion events."

This degree of functional preservation is as good as standard \u2018preconditioning\u2019 protocols (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cave et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Schneider et al., 2001</a>). Whether the occurrence of MEND is in fact detrimental to functional recovery is uncertain. Loss of substantial amounts of sarcolemma may certainly impact cardiac excitation-contraction coupling. From a different perspective, MEND itself may not be the culprit. MEND appears to rely on the development of submicroscopic membrane phase transitions. Independent of endocytosis, therefore, the occurrence of membrane phase transitions may promote membrane defects and membrane shedding that mediates release of cytoplasmic enzymes and metabolites to the extracellular space. The important conclusion for reperfusion injury is that effective inhibition of palmitoylation may significantly inhibit this part of reperfusion damage, and these same considerations apply to the function of vascular cells and fibroblasts during reperfusion."

Multiple lines of evidence support that idea that endocytosis during reoxygentation requires increased membrane protein palmitoylation, and inhibition of the pathway appears to protect muscle from reoxygenation injury. The phenotypes of myocytes that are deficient in DHHC5 acyl activity suggest that the pathway contributes significantly to constitutive sarcolemma turnover and will mediate enhanced sarcolemma turnover in response to transient metabolic stress."

Right ventricular strips were dissected at 10\u00b0C in a relaxing solution that contained 20 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> to prevent electrical activity and contraction. Muscles were mounted horizontally in a chamber maintained at 37\u00b0C and superfused with physiological salt solution, described below, at a velocity of 1\u20132 cm/s. The capacitive component of NIC signals increased with increasing oscillation frequency up to a maximum at \u223c23 kHz. The optimal frequency for recording was therefore about 15 kHz. The phase angle was adjusted by up to 2\u00b0 to insure that the capacitive signal was zero upon touching the probe to a soft rubber septum in the recording chamber. As described in <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>, capacitive signals in NIC recording can be strongly decreased by extracting lipids from right ventricular strips and are very insensitive to sarcolemmal conductance changes of very large magnitudes. One major experimental requirement for reliable NIC recording is that the probe remains mechanically stable with respect to the tissue and that conductance of the tissue (i.e., of the extracellular space) does not change. Conductance signal changes were negligible during NIC recordings presented in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>."

However, methyl-\u03b2-cylodextrin (BMCD) causes large decreases of C<sub>m</sub> that presumably reflect extraction of both phospholipids and cholesterol. Similarly, NIC signals from right ventricular strips are unaffected by application of HPCD (8 mM) but are strongly decreased by application of BMCD (8 mM). (<b>B</b>) Muscle incubated with ATP and 0 Ca with 1 mM EGTA to avoid contraction when the sarcolemma develops ruptures. A rather high concentration of sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS, 2.5 mM) does not significantly decrease NIC signals. Although this concentration of SDS generates sarcolemmal leaks with great certainty, it does not effectively extract the sarcolemma from the intact muscle preparation. By contrast, Triton X100 at 3% very effectively decreases NIC signals from the same muscle, as expected for an effective membrane extraction. These results verify that NIC signals are not affected by increases of sarcolemmal conductance until cellular conductance becomes significant with respect to that of the extracellular space."

As noted already, I have taken your recommendation to get off the Na/K horse seriously and I launch the paper straight from the perspective of \u2018reperfusion injury.\u2019 I also try to guide the discussion along this line, which likely will attract the most readers. As for Na/K pumps, I do keep the perspective in foreground that this transporter is a key regulator of cardiac contractility and therefore that it deserves general attention. That\u2019s a fact."
