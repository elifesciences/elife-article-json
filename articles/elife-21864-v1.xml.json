Some of the mutations that cause cancer are inherited, but most are the results of mistakes made when DNA is copied during cell division. By the time a person reaches adulthood, their DNA will have been copied about 30 trillion times, and each of these events could result in a cancer-causing mutation (<a href=\"#bib4\">Frank, 2010</a>). Human cells also continue to replicate their DNA and divide throughout adult life: this is particularly true in the gut, lungs, skin and bone marrow, and again each cell division comes with the risk of cancer."

Indeed, models suggest that if elephants and whales had the same risk of cancer per cell division as humans they could not exist (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Instead, they would all die of cancer at a young age (<a href=\"#bib3\">Caulin and\u00a0Maley, 2011</a>). Clearly elephants and whales do exist, and neither of them have unusually high rates of cancer. This puzzle is referred to as Peto\u2019s Paradox (<a href=\"#bib7\">Peto et al., 1975</a>), and it hints that large-bodied animals must have mechanisms to compensate for experiencing so many cell divisions. Recently, two groups of researchers set out to discover how elephants evolved to prevent or suppress cancer, and both arrived at a single gene \u2013 <i>TP53</i>."

However,\u00a0although\u00a0the model estimates much higher probabilities for large-bodied animals such African elephants and blue whales, cancer risk is actually much lower in elephants than in humans.

First they confirmed that an elephant\u2019s cancer\u00a0risk is about 2\u20135\u00a0times lower than a human\u2019s; they then went on to show that elephants actually have 20 copies of <i>TP53</i>. Abegglen et al. also noted that while one of the elephant\u2019s <i>TP53</i> genes was comparable to those in other mammals, the other 19 were slightly different. Most genes contain a mix of protein coding sections (which are called exons) and non-coding sections (called introns). Typically, introns are removed after a gene has\u00a0been transcribed into messenger RNA but before it is translated into a protein. However, all but one of the <i>TP53</i> genes in elephants lacked true introns. This indicates that the 19 extra <i>TP53</i> genes likely originated when an edited RNA molecule, which had had its introns removed, was converted back to DNA. Genes with this kind of history are known as \u201cretrogenes\u201d. Still, Abegglen et al. did not establish when these extra copies of <i>TP53</i> first evolved."

Abegglen et al. exposed elephant cells to ionizing radiation (which causes DNA damage) and found that they were twice as likely to undergo apoptosis as cells from healthy humans. However, based on this pair-wise comparison, it was not clear whether the elephant cells are more prone to apoptosis, or if human cells are relatively insensitive to DNA damage. Abegglen et al. also did not establish how and to what extent the <i>TP53</i> retrogenes were transcribed in elephant cells."

First, Sulak et al. searched 61 genomes of animals ranging from aardvarks to whales for <i>TP53</i> genes and retrogenes. Some of these animals \u2013 such as manatees and the rock hyrax \u2013 had only a few <i>TP53</i> retrogenes, whereas others had multiple copies of <i>TP53</i> retrogenes. By mapping the data onto a phylogenetic tree, Sulak et al. showed that the number of <i>TP53</i> genes had increased as body size increased in the lineage that led to elephants."

They confirmed that some of the <i>TP53</i> retrogenes are transcribed and translated in elephant tissue, and that these transcripts give rise to multiple forms of the proteins. Also, elephant cells up-regulated <i>TP53</i> signaling and induced apoptosis in response to lower levels of DNA damage (from drugs and radiation) than cells from other mammals. This indicates that elephant cells are especially sensitive to DNA damage and more prone to apoptosis. Next, Sulak et al. showed that elephant cells need the retrogenes for their enhanced apoptosis response. Finally, adding the same retrogenes to mouse cells made these cells more sensitive to DNA damage too. Cell division despite DNA damage is a hallmark of cancer, and so Sulak et al. concluded that elephants had likely solved Peto\u2019s Paradox (at least in part) by enhancing <i>TP53</i> signaling, a feat that they achieved by duplicating the <i>TP53</i> gene."

However, they also leave several issues unresolved. First, it is not clear if the retrogenes themselves lead to the increased apoptosis response, or whether other actors are in play. Second, does having multiple copies of <i>TP53</i> impose costs and, if so, to what extent can elephants avoid them? Moreover, Sulak et al. did not find multiple copies of <i>TP53</i> in whales; what other mechanisms suppress or prevent cancer in these creatures?
