However, it is not known whether the basic building blocks of the human neocortex, the pyramidal neurons, possess unique biophysical properties that might impact on cortical computations. Here we show that layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons from human temporal cortex (HL2/3 PCs) have a specific membrane capacitance (<i>C<sub>m</sub></i>) of ~0.5 \u00b5F/cm<sup>2</sup>, half of the commonly accepted 'universal' value (~1 \u00b5F/cm<sup>2</sup>) for biological membranes. This finding was predicted by fitting in vitro voltage transients to theoretical transients then validated by direct measurement of <i>C<sub>m</sub></i> in nucleated patch experiments. Models of 3D reconstructed HL2/3 PCs demonstrated that such low <i>C<sub>m</sub></i> value significantly enhances both synaptic charge-transfer from dendrites to soma and spike propagation along the axon. This is the first demonstration that human cortical neurons have distinctive membrane properties, suggesting important implications for signal processing in human neocortex."

However, it is not known whether the basic building blocks of the human neocortex, the pyramidal neurons, possess unique biophysical properties that might impact on cortical computations. Here we show that layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons from human temporal cortex (HL2/3 PCs) have a specific membrane capacitance (<i>C<sub>m</sub></i>) of ~0.5 \u00b5F/cm<sup>2</sup>, half of the commonly accepted 'universal' value (~1 \u00b5F/cm<sup>2</sup>) for biological membranes. This finding was predicted by fitting in vitro voltage transients to theoretical transients then validated by direct measurement of <i>C<sub>m</sub></i> in nucleated patch experiments. Models of 3D reconstructed HL2/3 PCs demonstrated that such low <i>C<sub>m</sub></i> value significantly enhances both synaptic charge-transfer from dendrites to soma and spike propagation along the axon. This is the first demonstration that human cortical neurons have distinctive membrane properties, suggesting important implications for signal processing in human neocortex."

Starting with the seminal work of Santiago Ram\u00f3n y Cajal (<a href=\"#bib5\">Cajal, 1995</a>) and Camilo Golgi (<a href=\"#bib18\">Golgi, 1906</a>), and continuing with modern anatomical studies (<a href=\"#bib24\">Jacobs et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Watson et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">DeFelipe, 2011</a>), anatomists have been fascinated by its cellular structure. Comparison of human and rodents cortices shows that the human cortex is thicker (in particular layer 2/3 [<a href=\"#bib11\">DeFelipe et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Elston et al., 2001</a>]), contains more white matter (<a href=\"#bib21\">Herculano-Houzel et al., 2010</a>), its neurons are larger (<a href=\"#bib38\">Mohan et al., 2015</a>), and its cortical pyramidal cells have more synaptic connections per cell (15,000\u201330,000 for layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons [<a href=\"#bib12\">DeFelipe, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">DeFelipe et al., 2002</a>]). It seems that the human neocortex, and especially its neurons, is anatomically unique. But what about the biophysical properties, e.g. the specific membrane capacitance of human cortical neurons and their cable characteristics? These have been shown to be key in determining information processing in neurons and in the networks they form (<a href=\"#bib52\">Segev and Rall, 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Major et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Stuart and Spruston, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Magee, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Segev and London, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Poirazi and Mel, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">London and H\u00e4usser, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Hay et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Eyal\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Markram et al., 2015</a>)."

The models were based on in vitro intracellular physiological and anatomical data from these same cells. To collect this data, fresh cortical tissue was obtained from brain operations at the neurosurgical department in Amsterdam. Details can be found in our previous works (<a href=\"#bib57\">Testa-Silva et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Verhoog et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Testa-Silva et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Mohan et al., 2015</a>), as well as in the work of other groups (<a href=\"#bib50\">Schwartzkroin and Prince, 1978</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Szabadics et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">K\u00f6hling and Avoli, 2006</a>).

That same cell was then reconstructed in 3D and the dendritic spines were added globally as in <a href=\"#bib44\">Rapp et al. (1992)</a>, see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods. The shape, size, membrane area, and distribution of dendritic spines in the HL2/3 model were based on high-resolution 3D confocal images of several stretches of HL2/3 PCs dendrites (See Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods, Figure 4 and more details in <a href=\"#bib2\">Benavides-Piccione et al., 2013</a>). The 3D anatomy plus physiology were combined for reconstructing a detailed model for that cell. Attempts to fit the experimental transient via the model are depicted by the various colored theoretical transients (see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods), each with its corresponding values for axial resistivity, <i>R<sub>a</sub></i>, specific membrane resistivity, <i>R<sub>m</sub></i>, and capacitance, <i>C<sub>m</sub></i>. The green transient (with <i>R<sub>a</sub></i>\u00a0=\u00a0203 \u03a9cm, <i>R<sub>m</sub></i>\u00a0=\u00a038,907 \u03a9cm<sup>2</sup> and <i>C<sub>m</sub></i>\u00a0=\u00a00.45 \u03bcF/cm<sup>2</sup>) best fitted the experimental transient. Attempts to fit the transient with larger values of <i>C<sub>m</sub> </i>failed (red and magenta traces). A close fit between model and experimental transients, with identical cable parameters as the best model in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1a</a>, was obtained for a range of (depolarizing and hyperpolarizing) voltage transients recorded experimentally from that same cell (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b</a>). A similar range of cable parameters was also found for five additional modeled and experimentally characterized HL2/3 pyramidal cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1c1\u2013c5</a>). Furthermore, the low value for <i>C<sub>m</sub></i>, around 0.5 \u03bcF/cm<sup>2</sup>, was found in all these five additional modeled cells (<i>C<sub>m</sub></i>= 0.47 \u00b1 0.03 \u03bcF/cm<sup>2</sup>, mean \u00b1 S.D, n\u00a0=\u00a06).

In all cases, the RMSD obtained with <i>C<sub>m</sub></i>\u00a0=\u00a00.5 \u00b5F/cm<sup>2</sup> is much smaller than the one obtained with the\u00a0larger <i>C<sub>m</sub></i> value (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1b</a>). <i>R<sub>m</sub></i> values are cell-specific (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1c</a>), whereas the value of <i>R<sub>a\u00a0</sub></i>has a negligible impact on the RMSD (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1d</a>). As in (<a href=\"#bib35\">Major et al., 1994</a>) we found that large <i>R<sub>a</sub></i> value improves the fit over the first two milliseconds of the transient (not shown). Indeed, the best way to directly measure <i>R<sub>a</sub></i> is to use two (somatic and dendritic) electrodes, but this was beyond the scope of the present study. The values in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> for <i>R<sub>a</sub>\u00a0</i>(268.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a030.0 \u2126cm, n\u00a0=\u00a06) should therefore be viewed with some caution. However, we would like to re-emphasize that our prediction of low <i>C<sub>m</sub></i> value in human L2/3 pyramidal neurons holds independently of the <i>R<sub>a</sub></i> value chosen (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1b</a>). We further examined whether possible statistical and systematic errors in the data might effect our estimates of <i>C<sub>m</sub></i>, <i>R<sub>m</sub></i> and <i>R<sub>a</sub></i> by performing error analysis as in <a href=\"#bib46\">Roth and H\u00e4usser (2001)</a>. We found that even with large systematic errors in morphological parameters, the best fit still yields low <i>C<sub>m</sub></i> value in human L2/3 pyramidal neurons (see <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>)."

It is important to note that a few studies have demonstrated that <i>C<sub>m</sub> </i>in rodent\u2019s pyramidal neurons may range between 0.7\u20132 \u00b5F/cm<sup>2</sup> (<a href=\"#bib35\">Major et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Thurbon et al., 1998</a>), but direct measurements using nucleated patches found a much narrower range, 0.8\u20131.1 \u00b5F/cm<sup>2</sup>, in cortical pyramidal neurons (<a href=\"#bib16\">Gentet et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Szoboszlay et al., 2016</a>), as well as in cerebellar Golgi cells (<a href=\"#bib56\">Szoboszlay et al., 2016</a>). This narrow range of values also agrees with the modeling prediction of (<a href=\"#bib40\">N\u00f6renberg et al., 2010</a>) for GABAergic hippocampal interneurons, where a correction for the spines area is not required. In the present work, we used both a modeling approach, as well as nucleated patch experiments, to demonstrate that <i>C<sub>m</sub></i> in human L2/3 pyramidal neurons is significantly lower than in rodents. We next demonstrated that such low <i>C<sub>m</sub> </i>value has important functional implications for signal processing in dendrites and axons."

The specific capacitance is determined by the dielectric constant of the material composing the membrane and by the membrane thickness. We measured the membrane thickness in a few samples from human and mouse L2/3 pyramidal cells, both from the temporal cortex; both showed similar thickness of 5.1\u20135.8 nm (not shown). Another possibility that might explain differences in <i>C<sub>m</sub></i> is the compositions of neuronal membranes. <a href=\"#bib16\">Gentet et al. (2000)</a> demonstrated that transmembrane proteins have small effect on <i>C<sub>m</sub></i>. However, a recent study showed that <i>C<sub>m</sub></i> of condensed phosphatidylcholine-based monolayers is sensitive to their lipid composition and molecular arrangement (<a href=\"#bib29\">Lecompte et al., 2015</a>). Furthermore, <a href=\"#bib56\">Szoboszlay et al. (2016)</a>, using nucleated patch experiments on mouse cerebellar neurons, showed that <i>C<sub>m</sub></i> increases significantly (from 1 \u00b5F/cm<sup>2</sup> to more than 2 \u00b5F/cm<sup>2</sup>) after adding Mefloquine to the bath; Mefloquine is known to bind to the membrane phospholipids (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chevli and Fitch, 1982</a>). Interestingly, (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bozek et al., 2015</a>) showed a\u00a0significant difference in the lipidome of human, chimpanzee, macaque, and mouse. More specifically, <a href=\"#bib39\">Moschetta et al. (2005)</a> and <a href=\"#bib7\">Chan et al. (2012)</a> showed differences in the ratio between phospholipids, cholesterol, and sphingomyelin in human vs. rodents. In view of the above studies, we suggest that the lipid composition of HL2/3 membrane explains their low <i>C<sub>m</sub></i>. This assertion requires direct examination of the human membranes at the molecular level, which is beyond the scope of the present study."

Following the intracellular injection of pyramidal neurons, sections were processed with a rabbit antibody against LY produced at the Cajal Institute (1:400,000 in stock solution containing 2% BSA (A3425, Sigma), 1% Triton X-100 (30632, BDH Chemicals), 5% sucrose in PB).

However, many times it was necessary to use several surfaces of different intensity thresholds to capture the complete morphology of a dendritic spine. In these cases, Imaris did not give a proper estimation of the spine area. Thus, spine 3D reconstructions had to be further processed in order to accurately calculate the surface area of the spines. We developed a new method for preprocessing the resulting meshes in order to join all the pieces into one solid mesh per spine. For each spine we made the following steps: (i) rasterize the meshes into a high-resolution 3D-mask; (ii) dilate and erode the foreground just the minimum amount of voxels V needed to join all the connected components into only one; (iii) reconstruct a mesh from the foreground using Marching Cubes (<a href=\"#bib31\">Lorensen and Cline, 1987</a>) after applying a Gaussian Filter of V voxels. The resulting mesh is an accurate reconstruction of the spine from which the volume and the area can be accurately calculated because each spine represents a 3D-model with no visible differences from the originals. Thus, we concluded that the post-processed meshes are as accurate as the pre-processed ones. The implementation used in this dataset is based on VTK library (<a href=\"http://www.vtk.org/\">http://www.vtk.org/</a>). A total of 7917 and 8345 spine membrane areas from the cingulate and temporal cortex, respectively, were included in this study."

Brief current pulses were used in order to minimize the activation of voltage-dependent mechanisms. Each stimulus was repeated 50 times and the voltage response was averaged (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, black traces and <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). These experimental voltage transients were used as a target for fitting theoretical transients generated by a model of that same 3D reconstructed cell (color traces in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1a,d</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2b</a>). Optimization of cable parameters (specific membrane resistivity, <i>R<sub>m</sub></i>, and capacitance, <i>C<sub>m</sub></i>, and specific cytoplasm resistivity, <i>R<sub>a</sub></i>) was first performed by fitting model transients to the experimental voltage transient for 200 pA depolarization. The resultant models (fitted for only one transient) were than validated on different (depolarizing and hyperpolarizing) stimuli (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b</a>). In one mouse neuron (left cell in <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2a1</a>), we obtained transient response to only 100 pA hyperpolarization; the respective model was thus fitted this experimental transient. Throughout, recorded membrane potential was corrected for a calculated liquid junction potential of 16 mV."

The intracellular recording solutions (in mM) for nucleated patch recordings consisted of: 70 Cs-Gluconate, 70 CsCl, 10 HEPES, 0.5 NaGTP, 5 Mg2-ATP, 10 EGTA, 10 K-Phosphocreatine (pH 7.3, 290 mOsm). Recording pipettes were made of borosilicate glass and were coated with Sylgard. After fire-polishing the tips, pipette resistance was 2.5\u20134 M\u03a9. Series resistance was not compensated. Pipette capacitance was fully compensated while in the cell-attached configuration. Pyramidal neurons were targeted for recording with infrared differential interference contrast (IR-DIC) microscopy (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). After establishing whole-cell configuration, a nucleated patch was pulled from the cell body and lifted above the slice close to the surface of the bath to reduce pipette capacitance. Currents were recorded using a Multiclamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices, CA). Data was recorded at 250 kHz and low-pass-filtered offline at 50 kHz. A \u22125 mV pulse was applied from a membrane potential of \u221260 mV and 400\u2013800 capacitive transients were recorded and averaged for analysis. At the end of the recording, the patch was ruptured and the open tip of the pipette was pressed against a small sylgard ball, resulting in a G\u03a9 seal and a \u22125 mV pulse was applied (<a href=\"#bib16\">Gentet et al., 2000</a>). Care was taken that the immersion depth of the pipette was maintained constant. To calculate the specific membrane capacitance of the nucleated patch, the procedures and formulas described in (<a href=\"#bib16\">Gentet et al., 2000</a>) were used. The surface area for both human and mice nucleated patches was estimated using <a href=\"#equ10\">Equation (1)</a>."

To achieve that we used Hodgkin-Huxley formalism (<a href=\"#bib33\">Mainen and Sejnowski, 1996</a>) with maximal Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> conductances at the soma of 8000 pS/\u00b5m<sup>2</sup> and 3200 pS/\u00b5m<sup>2</sup>, respectively. The V1/2 for the sodium activation curve was shifted by \u22128 mV so that the modeled cell generated a spike at ~\u00a0\u221265 mV, as in the experiments. A long, unmyelinated axon, (see above) was coupled to the soma, consisting of maximal Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> conductances of 200 pS/\u00b5m<sup>2</sup> and 100 pS/\u00b5m<sup>2</sup>, respectively."

To address this question, the authors use electrophysiological recording, cable modelling, and simulations. The main finding is that the specific capacitance in human cells is lower than previously reported in rodents, as convergently shown by two different approaches (cable modeling and nucleated patch recording). Furthermore, they show that a low Cm is advantageous for both efficacy and speed of signal propagation in pyramidal cells. If the difference in Cm is indeed true, this would clearly be an important and interesting finding that surely deserves publication in <i>eLife</i>. However, several issues need to be addressed before the conclusions can be considered secure. Most importantly, alternative interpretations of the data are not carefully considered. Furthermore, the case for a difference in Cm rests on only four recordings from mouse neurons."

The decay of voltage transients in response to current injection is a highly indirect measure of Cm. Thus, it would be valuable to identify the fundamental difference in the voltage responses observed in human and mouse neurons, thus providing a direct indication of the feature of the data that is indicative of a different Cm. If the authors have short current pulse data from mouse neurons, they should therefore provide it, particularly since this would offer two parallel lines of evidence that illustrates the difference between human and mouse neurons, which would be more convincing than just the result from nucleated patches."

Clearly, the best way to address this discrepancy would be to use the two-electrode approach for human neurons. If this is not possible, the limitations of the present study should be clearly stated. Additionally, the value of Ra will depend on the intracellular solution. However, the composition of the internal solution for the whole-cell recordings is not even mentioned in the paper (it is most likely different from the Cs+ solution used for nucleated patch recording)."

The decay of voltage transients in response to current injection is a highly indirect measure of Cm. Thus, it would be valuable to identify the fundamental difference in the voltage responses observed in human and mouse neurons, thus providing a direct indication of the feature of the data that is indicative of a different Cm. If the authors have short current pulse data from mouse neurons, they should therefore provide it, particularly since this would offer two parallel lines of evidence that illustrates the difference between human and mouse neurons, which would be more convincing than just the result from nucleated patches.</i>"

The recordings from the mouse nucleated patches confirmed well-established existing data and values reported in the literature for mouse neurons (Gentet et al., 2000; Szoboszlay et al., Neuron, 2016) n=4 may not be a high number, but a same number of nucleated patches was also used in other studies for similar type of experiments, Szoboszlay et al., (Neuron 2016), in which nucleated patch measurements on mouse cerebellar neurons resulted in a value of 1 \u00b5F/cm<sup>2</sup>based on n=4 recordings. Nevertheless, we added three new recordings on mouse nucleated patches to the revised manuscript (now n=7, see revised <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). Furthermore, to ensure that the specific membrane capacitance estimates based on the nucleated patch were robust, we derived time constants from single exponential fits of the traces recorded from the nucleated patches, as well as the traces from which the residual capacitive transient was subtracted from the capacitive transient recorded from the nucleated patch. Both analyses resulted in quantitatively similar estimates of the specific membrane capacitance (human 0.47 \u00b1 0.15 and 0.51 \u00b1 0.11, mouse 1.03 \u00b1 0.27 and 0.83 \u00b1 0.34) and the between species comparisons were significantly different in both analyses."

Consequently, in order to match the \u201ctail\u201d of the theoretical transient (that is governed by the effective time constant) to the experimental tail, a larger modeled <i>C<sub>m</sub></i> is required. However, at short times, the voltage transient is dominated by the capacitive current (and not by the ionic currents, e.g., Ih); at these short times, a good match between model and experiments could be only obtained with <i>C<sub>m</sub></i> ~ 0.5 (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3D1</a>). But now the theoretical and experimental transients diverge significantly at later times; for Ih density of 0.2 mS/cm<sup>2</sup> the theoretical curve (unlike the experimental curve) even exhibits an undershoot (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3D1</a>). We conclude that in order to explain the experimental transients in human L2/3 neurons <i>C<sub>m</sub></i> should be ~ 0.5 otherwise we cannot explain the first few milliseconds of the experimental transients, even with active currents (Ih) presence in the model. Furthermore, if Ih is indeed expressed in human L2/3 neurons, then it is slow compared with that in rat L5 pyramidal cells (Kole et al. 2006). This is because, as shown in <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), if fast Ih is expressed in human L2/3 neurons it was not possible to find a satisfactory match between the theoretical and experimental transients. <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a> was added to the paper."
