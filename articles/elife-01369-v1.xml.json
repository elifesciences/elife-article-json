A surprising paradox emerging from recent studies is that ubiquitin ligases (E3s) and deubiquitinases (DUBs), enzymes with opposing activities, can both promote ERAD. Here we demonstrate that the ERAD E3 gp78 can ubiquitinate not only ERAD substrates, but also the machinery protein Ubl4A, a key component of the Bag6 chaperone complex. Remarkably, instead of targeting Ubl4A for degradation, polyubiquitination is associated with irreversible proteolytic processing and inactivation of Bag6. Importantly, we identify USP13 as a gp78-associated DUB that eliminates ubiquitin conjugates from Ubl4A to maintain the functionality of Bag6. Our study reveals an unexpected paradigm in which a DUB prevents undesired ubiquitination to sharpen substrate specificity for an associated ubiquitin ligase partner and to promote ER quality control."

A surprising paradox emerging from recent studies is that ubiquitin ligases (E3s) and deubiquitinases (DUBs), enzymes with opposing activities, can both promote ERAD. Here we demonstrate that the ERAD E3 gp78 can ubiquitinate not only ERAD substrates, but also the machinery protein Ubl4A, a key component of the Bag6 chaperone complex. Remarkably, instead of targeting Ubl4A for degradation, polyubiquitination is associated with irreversible proteolytic processing and inactivation of Bag6. Importantly, we identify USP13 as a gp78-associated DUB that eliminates ubiquitin conjugates from Ubl4A to maintain the functionality of Bag6. Our study reveals an unexpected paradigm in which a DUB prevents undesired ubiquitination to sharpen substrate specificity for an associated ubiquitin ligase partner and to promote ER quality control."

Ubiquitin ligases are a key component of the cellular ubiquitination machinery that acts at the final step of ubiquitin transfer to ensure only certain substrates are selectively ubiquitinated in both temporally and spatially regulated manners (<a href=\"#bib12\">Deshaies and Joazeiro, 2009</a>). Substrate specificities of E3s are thought to be an intrinsic property of these enzymes, but whether it can be modulated by additional factors is an open question. In ERAD, substrate ubiquitination occurs on the cytosolic side of the ER membranes, immediately after substrates have emerged from the ER lumen. This modification serves as a signal to recruit the p97/VCP ATPase, leading to the extraction of substrates from the ER membrane (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bays et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Ye et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Jarosch et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Flierman et al., 2003</a>).

On the luminal side, ER chaperones and lectins recognize and deliver misfolded proteins to a gp78-containing complex for retrotranslocation. In the cytosol, gp78 uses a VIM (VCP-interacting motif) segment to bind p97/VCP (<a href=\"#bib3\">Ballar et al., 2006</a>).

However, only USP13, but not USP5 has been implicated in ERAD. To understand how these homologous enzymes can have distinct functions, we first purified recombinant USP13 and USP5 from both mammalian cells and <i>Escherichia coli</i>. We tested their ability to bind free ubiquitin and to cleave ubiquitin-AFC (Ub-AFC) in vitro. Interestingly, USP5 readily bound to free ubiquitin and cleaved Ub-AFC with high efficiency, whereas USP13 was almost completely inactive (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B,C</a>). USP13 could not efficiently cleave K48- or K63-linked di-ubiquitin either (data not shown). We next generated and purified USP13 mutants in each of which a fragment in USP13 was replaced by a corresponding segment in USP5 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Ub-AFC assay showed that the chimera (USP13/5-4) in which the first 722 amino acids of USP13 were replaced with a corresponding segment in USP5 still had no deubiquitinating activity. However, further incorporation of a USP5 segment encompassing the second ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain (amino acids 717\u2013781) to USP13 (USP13/5-5) led to an activity similar to that of USP5 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a>). These data suggest that USP13 and USP5 are distinct deubiquitinases and the second UBA domain accounts for the differential activities of these enzymes."

To understand the role of USP13 in ERAD, we characterized its interaction with p97 using an in vitro binding assay. We immobilized purified GST-USP13 or GST-USP5 on glutathione beads and incubated the beads with recombinant p97. As a positive control, we used GST-VIMP, a known p97 interactor (<a href=\"#bib51\">Ye et al., 2004</a>). As expected, the glutathione beads containing GST-VIMP pulled down p97 efficiently. By contrast, neither GST-USP13 nor GST-USP5 bound p97 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). However, when glutathione beads containing the same set of proteins were incubated with whole cell extracts, both VIMP and USP13 co-precipitated with endogenous p97, but USP5 still failed to bind p97 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). These results indicate that USP13, but not USP5, interacts with p97 through an adaptor(s) in cells, which explains why USP13, but not USP5 can function in ERAD."

We expressed these proteins in cells individually and examined the binding of endogenous p97 to GST-USP13. Compared to the control (cells transfected with an empty vector), expression of several UBX domain-containing p97 cofactors including ASPL, SAK1, and UbxD1 reduced the p97-USP13 interaction (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>, lanes 3, 5, 7 vs lane 1), suggesting that these factors may compete with USP13 for p97 binding. By contrast, several other factors enhanced the p97-USP13 interaction.

Firstly, GST-USP13 co-precipitated with both endogenous and overexpressed gp78 in addition to p97 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, lanes 4, 7). By contrast, USP5 did not bind endogenous gp78, and only a negligible amount of overexpressed gp78 could be pulled down by GST-USP5 (lanes 5, 8). Secondly, depletion of gp78 by shRNA-mediated gene knockdown or gene deletion reduced the USP13-p97 interaction by threefold to fourfold (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). An endogenous interaction between USP13 and gp78 was also detected (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Moreover, GST-tagged gp78 cytosolic domain (gp78c) could bind recombinant USP13 in vitro (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). These results demonstrated a specific and direct interaction between USP13 and gp78 that facilitates USP13-p97 association. The data also suggest that the interaction of USP13 with p97 is mediated by several cellular factors with gp78 being a major one."

Co-immunoprecipitation showed that the chimeras defective in cleaving Ub-AFC also behaved similarly to USP13 in binding gp78 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>, lanes 3\u20137). By contrast, USP13/5-5 had similar DUB activity as USP5, and both the proteins only co-precipitated with marginal amount of gp78 (lanes 2, 8). It appears that the second UBA domain is crucial for USP13 to bind gp78. To further test this idea, we created an additional construct (USP13/5-6) that had the amino acid sequence downstream of the first UBA domain of USP13 replaced with the corresponding segment from USP5 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Co-immunoprecipitation showed that like USP5, this mutant also bound gp78 with significantly reduced affinity when compared to USP13 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>). Collectively, these results suggest that the second UBA in USP13 inhibits its DUB activity, but at the same time allows it to gain interaction with gp78."

Because this phenotype was similarly observed in cells expressing the catalytically inactive USP13 mutant (USP13 C345S) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>), as well as in USP13 knockdown cells (see below, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>), we concluded that overexpressed USP13 had a dominant negative effect on ERAD. This was not entirely surprising as several reports had shown similar dominant negative activities with overexpression of other wild-type ERAD factors, presumably because the overexpressed proteins disrupt the normal stoichiometry of endogenous complexes. Consistent with this interpretation, we found that the ERAD inhibitory activity of USP13 was strongly dependent on gp78 binding because USP13/5-4, a chimera bound gp78 similarly to wild-type USP13, inhibited TCR\u03b1 degradation (t<sub>1/2</sub> = 3.6 hr), whereas the chimera (USP13/5-5) that had reduced affinity to gp78 only slightly increased the half-life of TCR\u03b1 (t<sub>1/2</sub> = 2.3 hr). The requirement of gp78 interaction for ERAD inhibition by ectopic USP13 indicates that the interaction of USP13 with gp78 is functionally relevant to ERAD."

First, we used two USP13 specific shRNAs to knock down USP13 in a cell line stably expressing TCR\u03b1-YFP. USP13 depletion significantly increased the levels of TCR\u03b1-YFP, as revealed by both immunoblotting and flow cytometry analyses (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>). This phenotype could be attributed to increased TCR\u03b1 stability as demonstrated by cycloheximide (CHX) chase experiments (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, lanes 5\u20138 vs lanes 1\u20134). Because depletion of DUBs may cause ubiquitin deficiency that can indirectly inhibit proteasomal degradation (<a href=\"#bib33\">Reyes-Turcu et al., 2009</a>), we generated a cell line expressing a TCR\u03b1 variant lacking the signal peptide (\u0394sTCR\u03b1-YFP). This TCR\u03b1 mutant is not targeted to the ER. Consequently, it is degraded by an ERAD-independent mechanism (<a href=\"#bib17\">Fiebiger et al., 2004</a>). Notably, USP13 knockdown had no effect on the steady state level of \u0394sTCR\u03b1-YFP (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). We conclude that USP13 is specifically required for efficient turnover of ERAD substrates."

To this end, we analyzed the glycosylation status of TCR\u03b1 in USP13-depleted cells that had been exposed to a proteasome inhibitor. TCR\u03b1 is a glycosylated type I membrane ERAD substrate that undergoes deglycosylation upon retrotranslocation (<a href=\"#bib52\">Yu et al., 1997</a>). Accordingly, in cells treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132, TCR\u03b1 is accumulated in two forms, an ER-localized, glycosylated precursor and a deglycosylated intermediate that has emerged into the cytosol. The level of deglycosylated TCR\u03b1 therefore can be used to gauge the retrotranslocation activity. As anticipated, knockdown of p97, the retrotranslocation-driving ATPase, reduced deglycosylated TCR\u03b1 in MG132-treated cells due to inhibition of retrotranslocation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>, lane 3 vs 1). By contrast, USP13 depletion did not affect deglycosylation of TCR\u03b1 (lane 2 vs 1), suggesting that USP13 promotes ERAD downstream of p97."

As demonstrated previously (<a href=\"#bib43\">Wang et al., 2011</a>), depletion of Bag6 caused accumulation of TCR\u03b1-YFP in aggregates in a fraction of cells (\u223c30%) due to lack of chaperoning during the proteasome targeting steps. TCR\u03b1 in these cells was resistant to extraction by the non-ionic detergent NP40 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F,G</a>). Intriguingly, we observed accumulation of TCR\u03b1 in aggresome-like punctae in similar number of the TCR\u03b1-YFP-expressing cells under USP13 knockdown conditions (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>), whereas in control cells, TCR\u03b1-containing aggregates was detected only in \u223c8% of the cells. Immunoblotting confirmed that USP13 depletion caused more TCR\u03b1 to partition into the NP40-insoluble fractions (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>) compared to control cells. For comparison, knockdown of p97 resulted in greater levels of TCR\u03b1 stabilization, but only a small fraction of TCR\u03b1 was present in the NP40-insoluble fraction (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>, lane 8 vs 4). Because p97 depletion caused TCR\u03b1 to accumulate primarily inside the ER, our data suggest that TCR\u03b1 forms aggregates in USP13-depleted cells most likely after it has entered the cytosol."

Cells expressing these ERAD substrates together with USP13 shRNA were subjected to extraction using the NP40 lysis buffer followed by the Laemmli buffer. Immunoblotting showed that USP13 depletion caused accumulation of these substrates in cells. Importantly, in both cases, more substrates were detected in the NP40-insoluble fractions in USP13 knockdown cells than in control cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H,I</a>). Moreover, consistent with the model that USP13 acts together with Bag6 at a post-dislocation step, a significant fraction of TCR\u03b1-\u0394TMD accumulated in USP13- and Bag6-knockdown cells in a deglycosylated form (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>).

Immunoprecipitation of USP13 from a whole cell extract resulted in co-precipitation of a fraction of Bag6 and its cofactor Ubl4A in addition to gp78 and p97. By contrast, the cytosolic chaperone Hsp90 was not co-precipitated (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), demonstrating a specific interaction between USP13 and the Bag6 complex. The interaction of USP13 with the Bag6 complex and gp78 did not require its deubiquitinating activity (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). This interaction could be further demonstrated by pull-down experiments using GST-tagged USP13 and whole cell extracts (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Notably, USP13 not only bound Bag6, but also interacted with MMS1 and \u03b16, subunits of the proteasome (lane 5), further implicating USP13 in delivery pathways that targets substrates to the proteasome. Because depletion of gp78 did not affect the interaction of USP13 with Bag6 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, lane 7 vs 5), USP13 might bind Bag6 directly. Indeed, GST pull-down experiments using purified proteins showed that GST-USP13 bound Bag6, and the N-terminal ubiquitin-like (UBL) domain in Bag6 was both necessary and sufficient for interaction with USP13 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D,E</a>).

To this end, we screened several pH conditions in order to find a way to activate USP13 because previous studies showed that increased pH can facilitate deprotonation of the catalytic cysteine in some USP DUBs to promote their activities (<a href=\"#bib25\">Lee et al., 2013</a>). Indeed, at pH 8.0, the activity of USP13 was significantly elevated compared to pH 7.4 (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). We then treated endogenous ubiquitinated Ubl4A purified from USP13-depleted cells with recombinant USP13 under this condition. This treatment did significantly reduce ubiquitinated Ubl4A, as demonstrated by immunoblotting (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>, lane 4 vs 1, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>), which was blocked by the specific DUB inhibitor ubiquitin aldehyde (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>, lanes 5\u20138 vs 1\u20134). As a control, we treated purified ERAD substrate TCR\u03b1 under the same condition, but no obvious deubiquitination was observed (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5H</a>). Together, these results suggest that USP13 preferentially removes ubiquitin conjugates from Ubl4A, probably because it forms a specific interaction with the Bag6 complex via the Bag6 UBL domain (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Although our results have not ruled out the possibility that USP13 may contribute to deubiquitination of TCR\u03b1 with the assistance of a substrate recruiting adaptor in cells, the inability to deubiquitinate TCR\u03b1 by purified USP13 suggests that the accumulation of ubiquitinated TCR\u03b1 in USP13 knockdown cells is probably due to ERAD inhibition at a step downstream of ubiquitination, as shown in Bag6-depleted cells (<a href=\"#bib43\">Wang et al., 2011</a>)."

Incubating purified Ubl4A, E1, Ube2g2, ubiquitin with wild-type gp78c, but not a catalytically inactive gp78c mutant resulted in accumulation of high molecular weight products corresponding to ubiquitinated Ubl4A (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, lane 2 vs 3). Likewise, overexpression of wild-type gp78, but not the catalytically inactive RING mutant (gp78 Rm) in cells significantly increased ubiquitination of endogenous Ubl4A (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). These data suggest that gp78 can ubiquitinate Ubl4A directly in vitro and in vivo. Surprisingly, knockdown of gp78 did not significantly reduce ubiquitinated Ubl4A (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). One possible way to explain these seemingly contradictory results is that Ubl4A might be ubiquitinated by several Bag6-associated ligases, but only those conjugates assembled by gp78 were preferentially removed by USP13. If this was correct, ubiquitinated Ubl4A accumulated upon USP13 depletion should be reduced when gp78 was depleted together with USP13, which was indeed observed in USP13 knockdown (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>, lane 9 vs 8) or deficient cells expressing gp78 specific shRNA (data not shown). These data suggest that USP13 and gp78 play antagonizing roles in regulation of Ubl4A ubiquitination: While gp78 assembles ubiquitin chains on Ubl4A, USP13 antagonizes this activity to limit Ubl4A ubiquitination."

Intriguingly, we observed that a fraction of Bag6 (designated as Bag6*) had increased mobility on SDS-PAGE gel (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>, lane 5). This fast migrating Bag6 species was probably caused by proteolytic processing of Bag6 that removed a small C-terminal segment because Bag6* could not be detected by an antibody against the C-terminus of Bag6 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>). Bag6* was primarily detected in NP40-insoluble fractions (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>, lane 5 vs 1), and its generation appears to be associated with hyper-ubiquitination of Ubl4A because co-depletion of gp78 together with USP13 reduced ubiquitinated Ubl4A and also abolished Bag6* accumulation (Lane 6 vs 5). Moreover, Bag6* was preferentially detected in the membrane bound pool of Bag6 in USP13-depleted cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). Coincidentally, membrane-associated Ubl4A was more prone to ubiquitination (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Furthermore, overexpression of gp78, a condition that significantly increased ubiquitinated Ubl4A, also induced Bag6 cleavage (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B,C</a>). Expression of a ubiquitin-Ubl4A fusion protein (Ub-Ubl4A) but not wild-type Ubl4A also caused accumulation of Bag6* in cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). Importantly, even though overexpression of gp78 was previously shown to promote turnover of an ERAD substrate (CD3\u03b4) (<a href=\"#bib16\">Fang et al., 2001</a>) whose degradation is independent of Bag6 (data not shown), the degradation of the Bag6 substrate TCR\u03b1 was significantly inhibited in cells expressing gp78 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>). Moreover, expression of Ub-Ubl4A also significantly reduced the rate of TCR\u03b1 degradation (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>). Together, these results suggest that hyper-ubiquitination of Ubl4A can cause ERAD inhibition in a dominant negative manner, probably because it is associated with the cleavage and subsequent inactivation of a fraction of membrane bound Bag6."

The result identified Lys48 in Ubl4A as the major ubiquitination site (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). To confirm that this Lys residue was ubiquitinated in cells, we initially attempted to overexpress a Ubl4A mutant bearing the Lys48 to Arg substitution. However, we found that most transiently expressed Ubl4A was not incorporated into the endogenous Bag6 complex because the complex had a slow turnover rate. As a result, overexpressed Ubl4A was not regulated by the same manner as endogenous Ubl4A. To overcome this problem, we established stable cell lines expressing either FLAG-tagged wild-type Ubl4A or Ubl4A K48R mutant under an inducible promoter. A careful titration experiment showed that when cells were grown in the presence of a low concentration of the inducer tetracycline (\u2018Materials and method\u2019), Ubl4A and Ubl4A K48R could be expressed at a level comparable to that of endogenous Ubl4A, and a significant fraction of ectopic Ubl4A interacted with Bag6. Under this condition, ubiquitination still preferentially occurred on endogenous Ubl4A (data not shown). However, significant amount of ubiquitinated Ubl4A-FLAG could be detected when gp78 was expressed (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>, lane 7). By contrast, overexpression of gp78 did not lead to ubiquitination of the Ubl4A K48R mutant (lane 8), suggesting that gp78-mediated ubiquitination primarily occurs at Lys48 in Ubl4A in cells. Moreover, when HA-tagged ubiquitin was expressed in these cells, gp78-independent basal ubiquitination of Ubl4A could be detected on wild-type Ubl4A, but not on the Ubl4A K48R mutant (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>, lane 3 vs 4).

                                "text": "To follow the transient interaction between SGTA and the Bag6 complex, we employed a crosslinking approach. We treated HEK293 cells with a cysteine reactive crosslinker to stabilize protein\u2013protein interactions. Cell extracts were subject to immunoprecipitation under denaturing conditions with SGTA antibody. Immunoblotting with SGTA antibodies detected a major crosslinking product whose molecular weight was consistent with a SGTA dimer. In addition, several SGTA-containing crosslinking products were detected only in anti-SGTA precipitated samples, but not in control samples (IgG pulldown). Among them, a crosslinking product of 250 kD was detected by both anti-SGTA and anti-Bag6 blotting (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a>). Two pieces of evidence further suggested that this 250 kD crosslinking product was a crosslinked complex containing both SGTA and Bag6. First, in vitro crosslinking using purified SGTA and the Bag6 complex generated a similar 250 kD complex (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1B,C</a>). This complex was not detected when the Bag6 complex or SGTA was omitted from the reaction. Second, knockdown of either Bag6 or SGTA by shRNA significantly reduced this crosslinking product (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E</a>, lanes 2, 4 vs 6). Consistent with the notion that Ubl4A facilitates the association of SGTA with Bag6, knockdown of Ubl4A also decreased this crosslinking product (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). Importantly, USP13 knockdown specifically reduced the 250 kD Bag6-SGTA crosslinking product without affecting either the SGTA dimer or other SGTA-containing crosslinking products (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8F</a>). Collectively, these results indicate that USP13 facilitates the association between SGTA and Bag6."

                        "text": "We report a novel functional link between the deubiquitinase USP13 and gp78, an ER-associated E3 postulated to be part of a \u2018retrotranslocon\u2019 for some misfolded proteins (<a href=\"#bib16\">Fang et al., 2001</a>). Despite having opposing activities, these enzymes interact with each other to form a complex that coordinately promotes ERAD. We identify the Bag6 cofactor Ubl4A as a shared substrate of gp78 and USP13. USP13 depletion is associated with hyper-ubiquitination of Ubl4A and altered interaction between the Bag6 complex and its co-chaperone SGTA. SGTA is an ortholog of Sgt2p, a chaperone implicated in biogenesis of tail-anchored ER proteins in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> (<a href=\"#bib41\">Wang et al., 2010</a>). Like Bag6, SGTA also contains a chaperone-like activity that preferentially binds hydrophobic segments. We recently demonstrated that this activity facilitates substrate binding by Bag6 in ERAD (<a href=\"#bib46\">Xu et al., 2012</a>). We also showed that the interaction of Bag6 with SGTA is facilitated by Ubl4A as the latter binds directly to SGTA in a highly dynamic manner (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chartron et al., 2012</a>). Because the interaction of Ubl4A with SGTA is mediated by positively-charged residues in Ubl4A including Lys48 (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chartron et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Xu et al., 2012</a>), which happens to be the major ubiquitination site, the simplest model to explain reduced Bag6-SGTA interaction in USP13 knockdown cells is that ubiquitin conjugates on Ubl4A sterically hinder SGTA binding. However, given that USP13 can also interact physically with Bag6, it is also possible that USP13 may serve an adaptor function to promote Bag6\u2013SGTA interaction."

                        "text": "Hyper-ubiquitination of Ubl4A in USP13-depleted cells is also associated with increased proteolysis of Bag6, resulting in a truncated variant (Bag6*). Based on the molecular weight, the cleavage seems to occur within or near the C-terminal BAG domain. It has been shown that the Bag6 co-factor Ubl4A binds to a site near the BAG domain (<a href=\"#bib47\">Xu et al., 2013</a>). Thus, it is possible that Ubl4A normally covers a protease site in Bag6 either by itself or by recruiting a Bag6 cofactor. Hyper-ubiquitination of Ubl4A in USP13 knockdown cells may alter its function, leading to increased cleavage of Bag6. In support of this idea, Bag6* also accumulates in cells depleted of Ubl4A (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>) or cells expressing the Ub-Ubl4A fusion protein (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). Our results suggest that depletion of USP13 can impair Bag6 function via at least two ways. One is to cause its cleavage and the other is to inhibit its interaction with SGTA (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1F</a>). The two events may be linked as increased cleavage of Bag6 may also contribute to reduced interaction with SGTA. Although hyper-ubiquitination of Ubl4A is clearly detrimental to ERAD, it is noteworthy that our results do not exclude the possibility that transient ubiquitination of Ubl4A by gp78 at the site of retrotranslocation may also serve a positive role in ERAD."

In this model, a DUB can cooperate with an E3 ligase to enhance its substrate specificity. The specificity of a ubiquitination reaction has generally been thought to be controlled at the E3 ligase level. In proteasomal degradation pathways, many E3s appear to directly recognize substrates bearing degradation signals, leading to their ubiquitination. However, in the complex cellular environment, ubiquitin ligases often function in large protein complexes, meaning that in addition to substrates, many cellular proteins containing ubiquitin acceptor lysine residues are also in proximity to these enzymes. How these E3 cofactors evade ubiquitination is completely unknown. Our study suggests that cooperation between an E3 ligase and an associated DUB may provide a simple solution that sharpens substrate specificity for the ligase. It is conceivable that while acting on substrates, E3 ligases may also ubiquitinate other factors that function in proximity. Such undesired ubiquitination, even occurring at a low frequency, could cause significant damage overtime, particularly if it leads to irreversible inactivation of the modified proteins. Removal of these unwanted ubiquitination products by DUBs ensures that only desired ubiquitination signals are maintained in cells. This concept is in line with a recent study, showing that even non-specific DUB activities can amplify the specificity of a quality control E3, allowing discrimination between two misfolded substrates bearing subtle structural differences (<a href=\"#bib53\">Zhang et al., 2013</a>)."

By contrast, the regulation of Bag6 by the gp78-USP13-mediated ubiquitination cycle seems to represent another paradigm; Ubiquitination inhibits the recruitment of a co-factor.

Our data suggest that sequence variations in a UBA domain allow USP13 to acquire new interactors, which may activate it at the ER membrane. Since purified gp78 is insufficient to activate USP13 (Liu, Y unpublished results), further experiments using gp78-containing retrotranslocation complexes reconstituted in proteoliposome are required to elucidate how USP13 is regulated in the context of retrotranslocation."

Briefly, E1 (60 nM), Ube2g2 (200 nM), gp78c (400 nM), and ubiquitin (10 \u00b5M) were incubated with the substrate Ubl4A at 37\u00b0C for 1 hr in a buffer containing 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mM magnesium/ATP, and 0.1 mM DTT. The DUB activities were measured by detecting the increase in fluorescence upon cleavage of Ubiquitin-AFC (Boston Biochem, MA). Purified DUBs (\u223c50 nM) were added individually to 200 \u03bcl deubiquitinating assay buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 20 mM potassium chloride, 5 mM magnesium chloride, 1 mM DTT, including 0.5 \u03bcM Ub-AFC), and incubated at 37\u00b0C. The fluorescence intensity was measured using an Aminco Bowman Luminescence spectrometer with excitation and emission wavelengths set at 400 and 505 nm, respectively. In vitro deubiquitination of Ubl4A was performed as follows. USP13-depleted cells were transfected with HA-Ub and TCR\u03b1-YFP and lysed in the NP40 lysis buffer. The whole cell extract was incubated with protein A beads pre-bound with GFP or Ubl4A antibodies to purify TCR\u03b1 and endogenous Ubl4A, respectively. After immunoprecipitation, the beads were washed twice with the NP40 washing buffer and once with 2\u00d7 deubiquitination buffer. The beads were then divided into equal portions, each containing 20 \u00b5l 2\u00d7 DUB buffer (100 mM Tris pH 8.0, 40 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM DTT). The reactions were started by adding recombinant FLAG-USP13 (purified from mammalian cells) or GST-USP13 (purified from <i>E. coli</i>) as indicated in the figure legends. The samples were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 2 hr with shaking and then stopped by addition of 40 \u00b5l Laemmli buffer.

P97 also interacts with a series of different deubiquitinases (DUBs), including Usp13. Because ubiquitylation is required for proteasomal targeting, it is was a surprising finding that either loss of ubiquitin ligases (i.e., leading to decreased ubiquitylation) or loss of DUBs (i.e., leading to increased ubiquitylation) interfered with efficient ERAD.

Indeed, they provide very nice and convincing evidence that Usp13 acts in the same complex as Bag6. Next, they searched for substrates of Usp13 and identified a component of the Bag6-complex, Ubl4A, as a candidate. They suggest that Usp13 protects Ubl4A from spurious gp78-dependent ubiquitylation, thereby ensuring the Ubl4A can bind to downstream partners, such as SGTA. This part of the story, i.e., whether deubiquitylation of a fraction of Ubl4A-molecules in cells is required for the function of the Bag6-complex in vivo and whether this reaction is the key function of Usp13, is less well developed. Overall, especially the experiments in the first part of the paper are very well performed and interpreted; moreover, addressing the paradox of a dual requirement for DUBs and ubiquitin ligases is very important for the field.

Moreover, the effect of gp78-depletion on the Usp13/p97 interaction is very weak and only one shRNA against gp78 is shown; this experiment needs to be repeated with multiple shRNAs (or better, rescue constructs), allowing the researchers to obtain a potential correlation between strength of knockdown and phenotype."

The characterization of this cleaved product is an ongoing project that we initially wished to develop into an independent story. In light of the reviewers\u2019 suggestions, we decide to include some results we obtained while characterizing this Bag6 cleavage product (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>).

This results in the accumulation of a truncated Bag6 variant lacking the essential BAG domain at the C-terminus. We believe that these results provide strong evidence to support our conclusion that the function of Bag6 is impaired when Ubl4A accumulates in ubiquitinated form. Importantly, when gp78 is co-depleted with USP13, it rescues Bag6 cleavage caused by USP13 depletion (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>, lane 6 vs 5), strongly indicating that the two enzymes are functionally antagonizing each other to regulate Bag6. We initially wished to publish these results after we identify the cellular enzyme(s) responsible for this proteolysis reaction and map the cleavage site. Since the reviewers question how ubiquitination of Ubl4A can lead to inactivation of Bag6 without involving proteasome dependent turnover of the Bag6 complex, we hope that the inclusion of these results will to some extent alleviate this concern.

Although the correlations between these molecular events do not necessarily prove any causal relationships among them, our results suggest that hyper-ubiquitination of Ubl4A and cleavage of Bag6 are tightly coupled because expression of Ub-Ubl4A also induces Bag6 cleavage. Collectively, we think that our new data suggest two possible mechanisms by which depletion of USP13 can interfere with Bag6 function. One is to increase cleavage of Bag6 and the other is to cause reduced interaction with SGTA. Whether these two events are mechanistically linked awaits further study, but the results clearly demonstrate that USP13 participates in ERAD by an indirect mechanism that maintains the functionality of Bag6."

On the other hand, the binding of USP13 with the UBL domain of Bag6 can be demonstrated using pulldown experiments (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). These experiments suggest that the interaction of USP13 with the substrate (the Bag6 complex) is distinct from the canonical DUB-substrate interactions, which are largely mediated by the ubiquitin conjugates on substrates. This provides a plausible explanation as to why USP13 won\u2019t just act on any ubiquitinated proteins. We agree with the reviewers that rescuing the ERAD phenotype with a Ubl4AK48R mutant will provide valuable information on whether ubiquitination of Ubl4A on Lys48 is the only USP13 depletion-associated deficiency that causes ERAD defects. In the Ubl4A K48R cell line, depletion of USP13 still causes accumulation of ERAD substrate TCR\u03b1 (data not shown). However, as we mentioned in our original manuscript, this cell line still contains endogenous Ubl4A, which is preferentially ubiquitinated when USP13 is depleted. To obtain a clean result, we need to knock down endogenous Ubl4A while maintaining the expression of ectopically expressed Ubl4A at a level comparable to that of the endogenous protein. This is technically challenging and will take a long time to complete (although we have started to play around with the CRISPR technology, we have not been able to establish a procedure to knock in a mutant gene). Additionally, it is also worth noting that although we describe ubiquitination of Ubl4A as a spurious event that damages the Bag6 function, we haven\u2019t formally ruled out the possibility that transient ubiquitination of Ubl4A by gp78 may also contribute a positive function to ERAD, a possibility now mentioned in the Discussion. If this is true, one would not expect to rescue the ERAD defect in USP13 knockdown cells with the Ubl4A K48R mutant. Answers to these questions are important, but we feel that resolving these issues by new experiments will take an unreasonable amount of time and the required additional experiments are beyond the scope of the current study. We hope that the reviewers will agree with us on this issue."

In this respect, the statement that the second UBA-domain accounts for the differential activity between Usp5 and Usp13 is not really supported by evidence (this would need a more specific swap of UBA-domains, rather than large protein segments). Adding these data would clearly strengthen the link between gp78 and Usp13. Moreover, the effect of gp78-depletion on the Usp13/p97 interaction is very weak and only one shRNA against gp78 is shown; this experiment needs to be repeated with multiple shRNAs (or better, rescue constructs), allowing the researchers to obtain a potential correlation between strength of knockdown and phenotype</i>."
