However, little is known about how the cell wall is regulated in stress. We found that CwlM, a protein homologous to peptidoglycan amidases, coordinates peptidoglycan synthesis with nutrient availability. Surprisingly, CwlM is sequestered from peptidoglycan (PG) by localization in the cytoplasm, and its enzymatic function is not essential. Rather, CwlM is phosphorylated and associates with MurA, the first enzyme in PG precursor synthesis. Phosphorylated CwlM activates MurA ~30 fold. CwlM is dephosphorylated in starvation, resulting in lower MurA activity, decreased cell wall metabolism, and increased tolerance to multiple antibiotics. A phylogenetic analysis of <i>cwlM</i> implies that localization in the cytoplasm drove the evolution of this factor. We describe a system that controls cell wall metabolism in response to starvation, and show that this regulation contributes to antibiotic tolerance."

However, little is known about how the cell wall is regulated in stress. We found that CwlM, a protein homologous to peptidoglycan amidases, coordinates peptidoglycan synthesis with nutrient availability. Surprisingly, CwlM is sequestered from peptidoglycan (PG) by localization in the cytoplasm, and its enzymatic function is not essential. Rather, CwlM is phosphorylated and associates with MurA, the first enzyme in PG precursor synthesis. Phosphorylated CwlM activates MurA ~30 fold. CwlM is dephosphorylated in starvation, resulting in lower MurA activity, decreased cell wall metabolism, and increased tolerance to multiple antibiotics. A phylogenetic analysis of <i>cwlM</i> implies that localization in the cytoplasm drove the evolution of this factor. We describe a system that controls cell wall metabolism in response to starvation, and show that this regulation contributes to antibiotic tolerance."

Such an enzyme would allow the peptidoglycan to expand and remodel. However, Boutte et al. found that CwlM does not act as an enzyme. Instead, it regulates an enzyme called MurA, which is present inside bacteria and helps to make the peptidoglycan network. Thus, CwIM actually helps to determine how much peptidoglycan a cell produces."

This quickly shuts down the production of peptidoglycan and makes starved cells tolerant to antibiotics. Notably, increasing peptidoglycan production in starved cells, by enhancing the activity of the MurA enzyme, makes the cells more vulnerable to several antibiotics."

The importance of this structure is evident from the fact that at least a quarter of the genes in the <i>Mtb</i> genome are involved in its construction and regulation (<a href=\"#bib19\">Doerks et al., 2012</a>). The mycobacterial cell wall consists of peptidoglycan (PG) covalently bound to a layer of arabinogalactan sugars, which is in turn covalently bound to a layer of mycolic acid lipids that make up an outer membrane (<a href=\"#bib1\">Alderwick et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Cambier et al., 2014</a>)."

TB therapy requires 6\u201312 months of drug treatment. This is likely due, in part, to drug tolerance like that observed in stressed, non-growing Mtb cultures (<a href=\"#bib68\">Wallis et al., 1999</a>). Because stressed Mtb also exhibits cell wall changes such as thickening, differential staining and chemical alterations (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bhamidi et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Cunningham and Spreadbury, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Seiler et al., 2003</a>), it seems probable that the cell wall changes contribute to antibiotic tolerance. Importantly, starved, antibiotic tolerant Mtb cells have been shown to be less permeable to antibiotics (<a href=\"#bib57\">Sarathy et al., 2013</a>). However, the regulatory mechanisms that induce cell wall changes in response to stress and contribute to impermeability and tolerance have not been described."

PG enzymes must be tightly regulated to promote cell growth and septation without compromising the wall integrity, and to restructure the cell wall to withstand stresses (<a href=\"#bib37\">Kieser and Rubin, 2014</a>). Accordingly, a large number of regulators in the cytoplasm, inner membrane and periplasm coordinate and control the activities of the PG enzymes, either directly or indirectly (<a href=\"#bib37\">Kieser and Rubin, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Typas et al., 2011</a>)."

In nutrient-replete conditions CwlM is phosphorylated. Using <i>in vitro</i> biochemistry we show that phosphorylated CwlM (CwlM~P) increases the rate of MurA catalysis by ~30 fold. In starvation, CwlM is dephosphorylated and in this state does not activate MurA, which has very low activity alone (<a href=\"#bib72\">Xu et al., 2014</a>). Importantly, we find that over-activation of MurA in the transition to starvation causes increased sensitivity to multiple classes of antibiotics. Finally, a phylogenetic analysis implies that CwlM protein evolution was driven by localization to the cytoplasm."

This is supported by our observation that overexpression of CwlM did not affect cell viability (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>): overexpression of highly active PG hydrolases usually results in cell lysis (<a href=\"#bib64\">Uehara and Bernhardt, 2011</a>).

To determine whether the <i>Msmeg</i> CwlM is also phosphorylated, we constructed a strain with an epitope-tagged allele (<i>cwlM</i>::FLAG), immunoprecipitated the protein from <i>Msmeg</i> lysate and separated it with 2D gel electrophoresis. We found several CwlM species with different isoelectric points, a hallmark of phosphorylation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Mass spectrometry of the gel spots identified phosphorylation at T35 and T374 (equivalent to T43 and T382 in the <i>Mtb</i> protein), as well as T376 and T378, and acetylation at K362 and K369. Most of the modifications are found at the C-terminal tail of the protein, which is highly conserved across actinomycetes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), despite being outside of a conserved domain. To assess whether phosphorylation is important for function, we replaced WT <i>cwlM</i> at the L5 site with mutants in which phosphorylated threonine residues were replaced by alanines. Most mutants grew normally but the L5::<i>cwlM</i> T374A strain grew slowly (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>; <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), despite containing normal amounts of CwlM protein (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). The L5::<i>cwlM</i> T374A cells were short (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>) and defective for polar elongation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>). Because the phenotypes of the L5::<i>cwlM</i> T374A strain are similar to the CwlM depletion (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>), it seems likely that absence of phosphorylation on T374 inhibits the essential function of CwlM, though the T374A mutation could interrupt CwlM function in another way."

In the transformations described in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, resulting in strains CB779, 782 and 785, there was no <i>tetR</i> on either of the L5 vectors; thus, the swap was not forced, and at least half of the colonies from any transformation had both the original L5 vector with WT <i>cwlM</i> and the newly-transformed vector."

To test this, we expressed and purified his-MurA<sub>MS</sub> WT and S368P and measured their activity alone and with his-CwlM<sub>TB</sub> and his-CwlM<sub>TB</sub>~P. We found that his-MurA<sub>MS</sub>S368P is more active than the WT protein in all conditions by about 2-fold (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). This suggests that the mutant enzyme should produce more PG precursors than the WT strain, even in starvation. We assessed PG activity using a fluorescently labeled D-alanine analogue TAMRA-D-alanine (TADA), which is thought to be incorporated primarily into metabolically active PG (<a href=\"#bib40\">Kuru et al., 2012</a>). We observed increased fluorescence in the strain carrying <i>murA</i> S368P as compared to the WT allele during the first 12\u2009hr of PBS starvation, but, by 24\u2009hr, the staining was equivalent between the strains (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Controls show that TADA staining is specific to the cell wall (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1C,D</a>). We interpret this to mean that post-translational regulation of MurA is important to control PG metabolism in logarithmic phase growth and during the transition to starvation, but that after prolonged starvation other regulatory mechanisms predominate to control PG metabolism. The abrupt cessation of growth (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>) and decreased CwlM phosphorylation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>) imply that incorporation of new PG decreases upon starvation in the WT strain; however, TADA staining remains constant (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). This suggests that TADA staining in these conditions may be due more to exchange of D-alanine in the periplasm by Ldts (<a href=\"#bib12\">Cava et al., 2011</a>) than to incorporation of new, labeled PG transported from the cytoplasm. Regardless, the over-activation of MurA clearly alters PG metabolism during the transition to starvation."

Many models suggest that decreased metabolism contributes to Mtb\u2019s antibiotic tolerance during treatment.

We hypothesized that continued synthesis of PG during the transition to starvation could reduce antibiotic tolerance. To test this, we subjected cells to PBS starvation and measured antibiotic sensitivity in strains with <i>murA</i> WT and S368P alleles. We found a 3\u2013100 fold increase in killing of the strain carrying the <i>murA</i> S368P allele when the strains were treated with isoniazid, meropenem or rifampin at the initiation of starvation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). The mutant also had a significant antibiotic tolerance defect in nutrient rich media, but not when the antibiotics were added late in starvation (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1F,G</a>), after the period in which post-translational regulation of MurA affects PG metabolism (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>).

To address this, we searched for <i>cwlM</i> homologues that retained both PG binding domains and the PG amidase domain in the same arrangement as is seen in the mycobacterial proteins (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>), and found that almost all such\u00a0homologues were found in members of the phylum Actinobacteria. We chose representatives from each family and searched for the presence of a secretion signal, the conservation of the four Zn<sup>2+</sup>-coordinating residues, and the presence of a PTG or TGT phosphorylation motif in the C-terminal tail. We constructed a phylogenetic tree based on 16S rRNA sequence of the species that have <i>cwlM</i> homologues and some representative species from families that do not, and mapped onto it the conservation of the three <i>cwlM</i> features (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). We found that all actinobacterial <i>cwlM</i> homologues lack secretion signals. Potential phosphorylation motifs are conserved in most clades, irrespective of whether or not they conserve the canonical Zn<sup>2</sup>+-coordinating residues. These data imply that both CwlM cytoplasmic localization and, possibly, regulation by phosphorylation were present in an ancestor of the Actinobacteria."

This differs from wild-type regulation during starvation, when PG regulation is likely accompanied by regulation of other cell wall layers. In fact, PknB, the kinase likely responsible for physiologic CwlM phosphorylation, has been implicated in the regulation of many cell wall processes (<a href=\"#bib35\">Khan et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Molle et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Parikh et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Vilch\u00e8ze et al., 2014</a>), and probably helps to coordinate regulation of the various cell wall layers.

Instead, we measured the peak area of a range of UDP-GlcNac concentrations, and found that a peak area of 11.73 in the A<sub>254</sub> curve was consistently equivalent to 1 uM of UDP-GlcNac. Because UDP-GlcNac and EP-UDP-GlcNac differ only in one enol-pyruvyl group, we reasoned that the relationship between A<sub>254</sub> peak area and concentration should be comparable between these two molecules. We therefore divided the values for peak area for each EP-UDP-GlcNac peak by 11.73 to calculate the approximate \u00b5M concentration of EP-UDP-GlcNac. These values were plotted vs. time for each substrate concentration and the rate of product produced vs. time was calculated based on the linear portions of the curves.

All but 3 of these were in the Actinobacteria, the remaining 3 are in the Firmicutes. The ~700 CDART hits were separated by family, and a phylogenetic tree was made of each family. Between 3 and 16 homologues, representing the breadth of the phylogenetic distribution, were chosen from each family, leaving 97 homologues. The secretion signal identification programs Phobius (<a href=\"#bib31\">Kall et al., 2007</a>) and PRED-TAT (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bagos et al., 2010</a>) were used to assess the N-terminus of each homologue for the presence of a Sec or Tat secretion signal. The COBALT tool on NCBI was used to align the amidase domain of each homologue to active amidase domains of the same family; the conservation of the four Zn<sup>+2</sup>-coordinating residues was assessed for each. Each homologue was then searched for the presence of either PTG or TGT motifs in the C-terminal region after the amidase domain. 16S rRNA sequences were collected from the species with the 97 CwlM homologues, and from representative species from across the clade of Actinobacteria (<a href=\"#bib42\">Lang et al., 2013</a>) that do not have CwlM homologues. The 16S sequences were aligned with Clustal Omega and a distance-matrix tree was constructed and visualized in ITOL (<a href=\"#bib43\">Letunic and Bork, 2011</a>)."

In addition, the mutagenesis is based on the analysis of a truncated <i>B. subtilis</i> protein and the paper cited describes numerous mutations not in the catalytic residues that also inactivated the protein. So, the linkage between specific mutations and lack of catalysis is tenuous. Additionally, according to Deng et al. it does have activity \u2013 do you not agree and if so, why?"

The determination of compartmental localization using the MTSEA/MTSET is also confusing and should be clarified. The authors state in the legend to <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> that \"scores &gt;1 are periplasmic, &lt;1 are cytoplasmic\", so why does mRFP, unambiguously a cytoplasmic protein, have a value of.84 \u00b1. 40. In addition to a better explanation of the MTSEA/MTSET approach, the authors should consider a more traditional approach, such as fractionation, unless it is experimentally too demanding. And, perhaps more importantly, is it possible that some CwlM is present in each compartment? Unless this can be categorically ruled out, the authors should adjust their language about the cellular location of CwlM throughout the paper, including in the title."

The authors state that they think the result might be that some activation still occurs, but this shouldn't preclude doing and reporting the experiment. In fact, if it turns out that CwlM(T347A) can still activate MurA, the authors will need to significantly revise their model and, consequently, other parts of the paper. For instance, they write when discussing the phenotypes of various mutants that \"\u2026it seems likely that absence of phosphorylation on T374 inhibits the essential function of CwlM\". And one section states: \"We hypothesized that CwlM~P activates MurA and that MurA is less active when CwlM is less phosphorylated, resulting in the inhibition of cell growth seen in the <i>cwlM</i> T374A mutant.\" If the biochemistry indicates that CwlM(T374A) can still activate MurA, such statements and hypotheses would be inaccurate.

On a related point, in subsection \u201cCwlM~P stimulates the enzymatic activity of MurA\u201d and Figure S5: To establish the MurA/CwlM~P ratio, you need to know the CwlM~P/CwlM ratio first."

The only published method of determining compartmental location of mycobacterial proteins is PhoA fusions (Lim et al., 1995). Unfortunately, every fusion protein we made to CwlM, including NT, CT and internal fusions of PhoA or fluorescent proteins, were cleaved by the abundant mycobacterial proteases. Thus, we had to develop a new method to determine compartmental localization. We adapted the substituted cysteine accessibility method for this purpose. The cytoplasmic control that we had shown in the original manuscript, mRFP, was partially cleaved, so there were faint extra bands on the gel that confused the result. We have used a new cytoplasmic control, phosphoglycerate mutase (Pgm), which gives us a cleaner result.

Overexpressing pknB in starvation may not give the desired result because, in addition to being transcriptionally regulated, pknB is also post-translationally regulated (Baer et al., 2014), so the overexpressed pknB would likely not be active."
