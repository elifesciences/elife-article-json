In the periphery, a transmission bottleneck constrains performance; thus efficient coding implies that natural signal components with a predictably wider range should be compressed. In a different regime\u2014when sampling limitations constrain performance\u2014efficient coding implies that <i>more</i> resources should be allocated to informative features that are more variable. We propose that this regime is relevant for sensory cortex when it extracts complex features from limited numbers of sensory samples. To test this prediction, we use central visual processing as a model: we show that visual sensitivity for local multi-point spatial correlations, described by dozens of independently-measured parameters, can be quantitatively predicted from the structure of natural images. This suggests that efficient coding applies centrally, where it extends to higher-order sensory features and operates in a regime in which sensitivity increases with feature variability."

In the periphery, a transmission bottleneck constrains performance; thus efficient coding implies that natural signal components with a predictably wider range should be compressed. In a different regime\u2014when sampling limitations constrain performance\u2014efficient coding implies that <i>more</i> resources should be allocated to informative features that are more variable. We propose that this regime is relevant for sensory cortex when it extracts complex features from limited numbers of sensory samples. To test this prediction, we use central visual processing as a model: we show that visual sensitivity for local multi-point spatial correlations, described by dozens of independently-measured parameters, can be quantitatively predicted from the structure of natural images. This suggests that efficient coding applies centrally, where it extends to higher-order sensory features and operates in a regime in which sensitivity increases with feature variability."

A normative understanding of these computations begins in the periphery, where the efficient coding principle\u2014the notion that a sensory system is tuned to the statistics of its natural inputs\u2014has been shown to be a powerful organizing framework (<a href=\"#bib7\">Barlow, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Simoncelli, 2002</a>). Perhaps the best-known example is that of redundancy removal via predictive coding and spatiotemporal decorrelation.

Here, early visual cortex (V1 and V2) is charged with extracting edges, shapes, and other complex correlations of light between multiple points in space (<a href=\"#bib33\">Morrone and Burr, 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Oppenheim and Lim, 1981</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">von der Heydt et al., 1984</a>). We compare the spatial variation of local patterns of light across natural images with human sensitivity to manipulations of the same patterns in synthetic images. This allows us to determine how sensitivity is distributed across many different features, rather than simply determining the most salient ones. (We will say that a feature is more <i>salient</i> if it is more easily discriminated from white noise.) To this end, we parametrize the space of local multi-point correlations in images in terms of a complete set of coordinates, and we measure the probability distribution of coordinate values sampled over a large ensemble of natural scenes. We then use a psychophysical discrimination task to measure human sensitivity to the same correlations in synthetic images, where the correlations can be isolated and manipulated in a mathematically rigorous fashion by varying the corresponding coordinates (<a href=\"#bib15\">Chubb et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Victor et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Victor and Conte, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Victor et al., 2013</a>). Comparing the measurements, we show that human sensitivity to these multi-point elements of visual form is tuned to their variation in the natural world. Our result supports a broad hypothesis: cortex invests preferentially in mechanisms that encode unpredictable sensory features that are more variable, and thus more informative about the world. Namely, <i>variance is salience</i>."

We collect an ensemble of image patches from the calibrated Penn natural image database (PIDB) (<a href=\"#bib49\">Tka\u010dik et al., 2011</a>). We preprocess the image patches as shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>. This involves first averaging pixel luminances over a square region of <i>N \u00d7 N</i> pixels, which converts an image of size <i>L</i><sub><i>1</i></sub> <i>\u00d7 L</i><sub><i>2</i></sub> pixels into an image of reduced size <i>L</i><sub><i>1</i></sub><i>/N \u00d7 L</i><sub><i>2</i></sub><i>/N</i> pixels.

Since the preprocessing depends on a choice of two parameters, the block-average factor <i>N</i> and patch size <i>R</i>, we report results for multiple image analyses performed using the identical preprocessing pipeline but for various choices of <i>N</i> and <i>R</i>. After preprocessing, we binarize each patch to have equal numbers of black and white pixels (black = \u22121, white = +1).

Each stimulus was presented for 120ms and was followed by a noise mask. Subjects were then asked to identify the spatial location (top, bottom, left, or right) of the target. Experiments were carried out for synthetic stimuli in which the target or background was defined by first varying image statistic coordinates independently (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a> shows examples of gamuts from which stimuli are built).

We argued that, when performance requires inferences limited by sampling of the statistics of input features, resources should be devoted in proportion to feature variability. A basic idea here is that features that take a wider range of possible values are less predictable, and will better distinguish between contexts in the face of input noise. We used this hypothesis to successfully predict human sensitivity to elements of visual form arising from spatial multi-point correlations in images. This result is notable for several reasons. First, we successfully predicted dozens of independent parameters that describe human perceptual sensitivity. The only free parameter was a scale that converted between perceptual sensitivities and natural image statistics. Moreover, predictions about the rank ordering of sensitivities (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>) and the shape and orientation of isodiscrimination contours (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>) do not even require a scale factor. Second, the theoretical predictions and their psychophysical test were derived from two very different sources. Psychophysical stimuli consisted of mathematically-defined synthetic binary textures with precisely-controlled correlational structure that is unlikely to occur outside of the laboratory. In contrast, the efficient coding predictions were derived from calibrated photographs of natural scenes in which many types of correlations are simultaneously present. Third, predictions refer to multi-point (and not just pairwise) correlations, which are critical for defining local features such as lines and edges (<a href=\"#bib37\">Oppenheim and Lim, 1981</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Morrone and Burr, 1988</a>). In contrast, previous normative theories have have mainly focused on explaining the linear receptive fields of neurons in primary visual (<a href=\"#bib35\">Olshausen and Field, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Bell and Sejnowski, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">van Hateren and Ruderman, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">van Hateren and van der Schaaf, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Hyvarinen and Hoyer, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Vinje and Gallant, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Karklin and Lewicki, 2009</a>) and auditory cortex (<a href=\"#bib13\">Carlson and DeWeese, 2002</a>, <a href=\"#bib14\">2012</a>), or on deriving symmetry- and coverage-based mesoscopic models of cortical map formation in V1 (<a href=\"#bib63\">Wolf and Geisel, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Swindale et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Kaschube et al., 2011</a>). Finally, the efficient coding prediction of greater sensitivity to more variable multipoint correlations is closely tied to the statistical structure of natural visual images. Specifically, this regime applies to highly variable multipoint correlations that cannot be predicted from simpler ones. Some other multipoint correlations (defined on configurations other than a 2 \u00d7 2 glider) are also highly variable, but they are predictable from simpler correlations. For these multipoint correlations, visual sensitivity is very low (<a href=\"#bib48\">Tka\u010dik et al., 2010</a>), and efficient coding is not applicable in the form proposed here."

First, the stimuli had high contrast (100%) and consisted of pixels that were readily visible (14 arcmin), so retinal limitations of contrast sensitivity and resolution were eliminated. Second, the task requires pooling of information over wide areas (100\u2013200 pixels, that is, a region whose diameter is 10\u201315 times the width of an image element; see Figure 7 in <a href=\"#bib56\">Victor and Conte, 2005</a>). Retinal receptive fields are unlikely to do this, as the ratio of their spatial extent (surround size) to their resolution (center size) is typically no more than 4:1 (<a href=\"#bib16\">Croner and Kaplan, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Kremers et al., 1995</a>). Third, to account for the specificity of sensitivity to three- and four-point correlations, a cascade of two linear-nonlinear stages is required (<a href=\"#bib55\">Victor and Conte, 1991</a>); retinal responses are quite well-captured by a single nonlinear stage (<a href=\"#bib34\">Nirenberg and Pandarinath, 2012</a>), and cat retinal populations show no sensitivity to the four-point correlations studied used here (<a href=\"#bib60\">Victor, 1986</a>) while simultaneous cortical field potentials do.

Here, to enable analytical calculations, we used linear filters of variable gain and subject to Gaussian noise to model a population of neural channels encoding different features. The optimal allocation of resources to maximize information transmitted by the population depends on the amount of input noise, the amount of output noise, the input signal variability, and the total resources available to the system, here quantified as a constraint on the total output power (i.e., sum of response variances) in the neural population. The constrained output power and the output noise together determine the \u2018bandwidth\u2019 of the system\u2014that is, the expressive capacity of its outputs. Consider a neural population with input noise, output noise, and a fixed amount of output power. We find that when input signal variability is sufficiently large compared to the input noise, the gain of neurons should <i>decrease</i> with the variance of the input (regions to the right of the peaks in the right-hand panel of <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). This is a regime where the output bandwidth is low compared to the input range, and efficient coding predicts that signals should be \u2018whitened\u2019 by equalizing the variance in different channels. Conversely, consider input signals with a smaller range, which are thus more disrupted by input noise. In this case, the gain of neurons should <i>increase</i> with the variance of the input (regions to the left of the peaks in the right-hand panel of <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). This is a regime where the input noise dominates, and efficient coding predicts that the system should invest more resources in more variable, and hence more easily detectable, input signals. The relative sizes of input and output noise (controlled by <math id=\"inf30\"><mtext>\u039b</mtext></math> in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>) determines the input ranges over which the two qualitatively different regimes of efficient coding apply."

The result is passed through a linear filter with gain <math id=\"inf33\"><mrow><mo>|</mo><msub><mi>L</mi><mi>k</mi></msub><mo>|</mo></mrow></math>, and then Gaussian noise is added to the filter output. We impose a constraint on the total power output of all channels, that is, a constraint on its total resources. With these assumptions, the set of gains that maximizes the transmitted information can be determined (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019<i>, Two regimes of efficient coding</i>, and (<a href=\"#bib53\">van Hateren, 1992a</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Doi and Lewicki, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Doi and Lewicki, 2014</a>)). This set of gains depends on the relative strengths of input and output noise and on the severity of the power constraint, quantified here by the dimensionless parameter <math id=\"inf34\"><mtext>\u039b</mtext></math> (right-hand panel). As <math id=\"inf35\"><mtext>\u039b</mtext></math> decreases from 1 to 0, the system moves from a regime in which output noise is limiting to one in which input noise is limiting. (<b>B</b>) The efficient coding model applied to the sensory periphery. Raw luminances from natural images are corrupted with noise (e.g. shot noise resulting from photon incidence) and passed through a linear filter. The resulting signal is carried by the optic nerve, which imposes a strong constraint on output capacity. In the bandwidth limited case where output noise dominates over input noise (e.g., under high light conditions when photon noise is not limiting), the optimal gain decreases as signal variability increases. Since channel input and channel gain vary reciprocally, channel outputs are approximately equalized, resulting in a \u2018whitening\u2019, or decorrelation. (<b>C</b>) The efficient coding model applied to cortical processing. Informative image features resulting from early cortical processing, caricatured by our preprocessing pipeline as applied to the retinal output, are sampled from a spatial region of the image. This sampling acts as a kind of input noise, because it only provides limited count-based estimates for the true statistical properties of the image source. When this input noise is limiting, the optimal gain <i>increases</i> as signal variability increases. Rather than whiten, the output signals preserve the correlational structure of the input. Note that in both regimes (<b>B</b>) and (<b>C</b>), there is a range of signals that are not encoded at all. These are the signals that are not sufficiently informative to warrant an allocation of resources."

A common strategy employed in the periphery is \u2018whitening\u2019, where relatively fewer resources are devoted (yielding lower gain) to features with more variation (<a href=\"#bib35\">Olshausen and Field, 1996</a>). As an example, within the spatial frequency range that the retina captures well, sensitivity is greater for high spatial frequencies than for low ones, that is, sensitivity is inversely related to the degree of variation in natural scenes (the well-known <math id=\"inf36\"><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>/</mo><msup><mi>f</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow></math> power spectrum [<a href=\"#bib35\">Olshausen and Field, 1996</a>]). <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a> illustrates how this strategy can emerge from the simple efficient coding scheme discussed above as applied to peripheral sensory processing. Spatiotemporal correlations of light undergo filtering before passing through the optic nerve bottleneck (a constraint on bandwidth). Such a constraint on bandwidth is equivalently understood as a regime where output noise is relatively large compared to input noise. In this limit, where output noise dominates over input noise, the optimal strategy is whitening (See <a href=\"#bib45\">Srinivasan et al., 1982</a> and <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Of course, real neural systems contend with both input and output noise; indeed recent work has shown that simply whitening to deal with output noise underestimates the optimal performance that the sensory periphery can achieve (<a href=\"#bib18\">Doi and Lewicki, 2014</a>)."

Our results suggest that this is the regime is relevant to cortex, where it predicts the relative allocation of resources to higher-order image statistics. <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a> illustrates the simple efficient coding scheme in this context. We use our image preprocessing pipeline to mimic early visual processing, and we consider the downstream coding of higher-order image features. Because these features must be sampled from a finite patch of an image, they are subject to <i>input</i> noise arising from fluctuations in statistical estimation. When such input noise is limiting, the ability to detect a signal from noise increases with the variability of that signal. In this limit, efficient coding predicts that resources should be allocated in proportion to feature variability (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). This captures the intuition that when signal reliability is in question, more reliable signals warrant more resources. Furthermore, if two or more channels have covarying signals, resources should be devoted in relation to the direction and degree of maximum covariance (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019<i>, Two regimes of efficient coding</i>, <a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>, and <a href=\"#fig4s4\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 4</a>)."

Our finding that cortex operates in a different regime than the well-known peripheral whitening reflects the fact that different stages and kinds of processing can face different constraints. While information transmission by the visual periphery is limited by a bottleneck in the optic nerve, cortex faces no such transmission constraint. Furthermore, while faithful encoding may be an immediate goal of early visual processing, cortical circuits have to interpret image features from a complex and crowded visual scene and perform statistical inference. For example, to discriminate between various textures, the cortex cannot perform pixel-by-pixel comparisons, but must rely on the estimation of local correlations (image statistics) instead. Because these correlations must be sampled from a finite patch of the visual scene, any estimate will be limited by sampling fluctuations."

For natural images, this gives rise to a tradeoff: small regions lead to large fluctuations in the estimated statistics, while large regions blur over local details. This blurring may obscure the boundaries between objects with different surface properties. While the brain must implement such sampling, the size, scale, and potentially dynamic nature of the sampling region is not known. Interestingly, our predictions of human sensitivities do not change substantially over a wide range of spatial scales and image patch sizes, perhaps reflecting a scaling property of natural images (<a href=\"#bib46\">Stephens et al., 2013</a>). An avenue for future research is to determine whether there is an optimal region size, and if so, whether it could be estimated from images themselves."

Were sampling limitations the only consideration, perceptual sensitivity would be the same along each coordinate axis, and perceptual isodiscrimination contours would be circular in each coordinate plane. This follows from an ideal observer calculation (See Appendix B of <a href=\"#bib57\">Victor and Conte, 2012</a>). In contrast, we find that human observers have a severalfold variability in sensitivity along different coordinate axes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>) and have isodiscrimination contours that are elongated in oblique directions (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). The efficient coding principle can account for these findings by taking into consideration the fact that a real observer has finite processing resources. In this context (finite resources <i>and</i> substantial input noise), the efficient coding principle predicts that resources are invested in relation to the range of signal values that are typically present (<a href=\"#bib53\">van Hateren, 1992a</a>), as we find. Interestingly, resource limitations seem to play an important role in the cortex despite the vast expansion in the number of neurons compared to the optic nerve. Presumably, this reflects the large number of complex features that could be computed and the corresponding need for a large overrepresentation of the stimulus space (<a href=\"#bib36\">Olshausen and Field, 1997</a>)."

For example, the distribution of <i>\u03b1</i>-coordinate values has a longer tail in the positive vs negative direction (see <a href=\"#fig3s9\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 9</a> and (<a href=\"#bib48\">Tka\u010dik et al., 2010</a>)).

This suggests that limitations imposed by \u2018neural hardware\u2019 force the system to use heuristics instead of matching the natural image distribution exactly. For example, an opponent mechanism responsible for detecting variations along, example, the <i>\u03b1</i> coordinate, might be a useful and easy (although imperfect) way to process the asymmetric distribution of four-point correlations found in natural scenes. Such a mechanism could be matched to the variance of the natural image distribution along the <i>\u03b1</i> coordinate, but not to its skew or other odd moments. An opponent mechanism would necessarily give rise to equal sensitivities to positive vs negative values of <i>\u03b1</i>, as observed in psychophysical results. Further study of deviations from a perfect match to the distribution of natural image statistics might provide additional insight into these or other possible neural mechanisms, and into the goals of the computations. Independently, our results also raise an interesting theoretical question about the optimal representation of non-gaussian, multidimensional signals under resource-limited conditions."

Similarly, images in which a large percentage of patches were assigned to the \u2018blurry\u2019 component contained large regions that were blurred due to motion or camera focus artifacts (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). Furthermore, the spatial boundary between blurred and in-focus regions in the original image matched the boundary between patches assigned to the \u2018blurry\u2019 vs \u2018in-focus\u2019 component."

With a sufficiently strong blurring transformation, all of the patches within a sharp image changed assignment from the \u2018in-focus\u2019 to the \u2018blurry\u2019 component. Successive block averaging removes the effects of small blur, such that a larger blurring transformation is required to change the assignment of patches from the \u2018in-focus\u2019 to the \u2018blurred\u2019 component. Furthermore, the application of motion and blur filters altered the spatial distribution of natural image statistics in a manner consistent with the statistics observed in image patches assigned to the \u2018blurry\u2019 component via the MOC method (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). Both types of blurring increased the values of second- and fourth-order statistics, but they did so in different manners. Camera motion strongly increased both the fourth-order statistic and the second-order statistic aligned parallel to the direction of motion. In comparison, camera focus artifacts (arising, e.g., from variations in field of depth) more uniformly increased all second- and fourth-order statistics."

For each coordinate, we randomly shuffle image patch labels. This shuffling creates a new set of null patches whose second-, third-, and fourth-order coordinate values are randomly drawn from a subset of the original image patches (e.g. a given null patch can be described by a <math id=\"inf172\"><mrow><msub><mi>\u03b2</mi><mo>/</mo></msub></mrow></math>-value measured from patch <i>m</i> but an <i>\u03b1</i> value measured from patch <i>n</i>). This shuffling destroys correlations between coordinate values measured within individual patches. Note that this shuffling does not alter the range of variation measured along single coordinate axes and will therefore not alter the values of precision matrix ellipses measured along coordinate axes. As a result, this test is not applicable to <math id=\"inf173\"><mrow><mover accent=\"true\"><mi>\u03c3</mi><mo>\u2192</mo></mover></mrow></math>, which measures natural image variation and human sensitivities along individual coordinate axes. However, shuffling will destroy correlations along oblique directions in coordinate planes, thereby aligning each ellipse along a single coordinate axis.

All distributions are shifted toward positive coordinate values, and there is larger variation in positive vs negative coordinate values. We assess this asymmetry in natural image analyses by computing the ratio of the standard deviations measured along positive vs negative coordinate axes. We similarly assess asymmetry in psychophysical analyses by computing the ratio of human sensitivities to positive vs negative deviations of coordinate values.

These questions are specified in detail in the reviews below. The consensus that emerged from the consultation session is that clarification and rewriting will be needed to ensure that the contribution of this work can be understood. Ordinarily <i>eLife</i> does not provide the full reviews, but in this case we believe it is important that you see the concerns of the reviewers as you prepare your revision."

Both follow a characteristic pattern in which cardinal, then oblique features are the most variable over images (and the most detectable), followed by fourth order statistics, followed by third order (L shapes in a 4-pixel glider). The correspondence between lines of isosensitivity and the precision matrix for pairwise comparisons in 10 dimensions are very striking. The authors interpret their findings as showing that efficient coding - heightened sensitivity to the most informative features of the world - occurs not only at a sensory level but at a central decision level."

It is known that we are most sensitive to cardinal orientations, and the neural underpinnings of this effect (in visual cortex) have been much discussed. The work of Simoncelli and colleagues (cited appropriately here) has been key in pointing out that sensitivity to cardinal directions matches the prevalence of cardinal information in the world. I think the work here extends that finding by demonstrating a particularly good correspondence between the spatial correlations in image statistics and this sensitivity over a number of basic features."

In fact, none of their discussion nor references to the earlier van Hateren papers that the authors invoke as a framework for interpreting their findings involves behavior. I suggest to simply drop that part of their claim and the suggestion that their principle might account for central processing and describe it as a principle governing early sensory processing where different constraints apply than in the sensory periphery.

First, stimuli are all high contrast (100%) and of a readily visible size (14 arcmin), so retinal limitations of contrast sensitivity and resolution are eliminated. Second, the task requires pooling of information over wide areas. Third, extracting three- and four-point correlations requires a kind of nonlinear processing (two stages of nonlinearity) that is not generally considered to be present in the retina; physiologic recordings show that neural responses to these correlations are not present in the thalamus, but are present in visual cortex, and much more so in V2 than in V1. We acknowledge that these lines are indirect; we do not directly record cortical activity, and we now state this explicitly in the manuscript (see response to comments raised by Reviewer 3).

The periphery is typically considered to be characterized by the first regime, at least when it comes to thinking about receptive field properties, and we hypothesize that central processing is characterized by the second. The new Figure illustrates the qualitative difference between these regimes: when output noise is limiting, efficient coding predicts a whitening (reduced sensitivity for more variable input components); when input noise is limiting, efficient coding predicts the opposite (increased sensitivity for more variable input components)."

In contrast, the input signals for central coding are nonlinear functions of the original image (image statistic coordinates); this means that efficient coding regime is derived from the covariance structure of image statistics. Since the formal inputs to the encoders are very different (light or contrast in the periphery, image statistic estimates centrally), a different regime of efficient coding emerges."

So, even though there is input noise at the level of the visual input, its severe output restriction (the transmission bottleneck) means that peripheral processing may be operating in a regime dominated by output noise. For cortex, which does not have the same output bottleneck, the same amount of input noise can dominate. The second consideration is the following. As we and others suggest, we view the \u201cjob\u201d of early cortical processing as making inferences about surfaces and materials from visual texture (an idea that we formalize by measuring sensitivity to local image statistics). Given this goal, the fact that cortex only has access to a limited sample of a texture (i.e., the sample presented by a particular object) is also a form of input noise."

Neurons in the periphery efficiently code the dots, making use of decorrelation. Centrally, however, the object of interest is the correlation structure of moving dots in small image patches, to extract the local coherent motion component. For this task, central processes must compare counts of how many dots move in each direction; at low density of dots, these estimates will be subject to large sampling errors due to random arrival and departure of dots from the region that is being sampled. Importantly, no matter what the SNR of the input is (even in 100% contrast vision where each dot is perfectly resolved), the local coherence estimates will be noisy due to the fact that local dot detections come as rare (and random) events; and the efficient central processing will thus be subject to large input noise. In our case, the local image statistics play the role of local dot counts, but the basic idea, that sampling is a form of noise, is identical. In both cases, because the signals relevant to periphery and cortex are different, one can end up in a different efficient coding regime at each stage of visual processing."

The best known example is perhaps that of night vision, when photon shot noise is no longer negligible and qualitatively reshapes peripheral information processing.

Moreover, since feature extraction is thought to be one of the main tasks of central vision, the sampling noise constraint is likely to represent a general aspect of cortical processing, rather than a special case as for night vision in the periphery.

Here, we build on this, and examine allocation of resources within this identified set of informative images. The previous work made no attempt to predict this allocation, and the current work is not applicable to image statistics that are uninformative (the distinction made in the previous work)."

Indeed, the visual system would be wasteful if it were to invest in mechanisms to encode uninformative statistics, and evidence from Tka\u010dik et al. (2010) suggests that this does not happen. This advance was crucial; as one looks at high-order statistics, there is an exponential explosion of correlations that we (or the brain) could compute. Tka\u010dik et al.

Thus, even in sensory periphery, there might exist special regimes when the signal is input-noise dominated. The best known example is perhaps that of night vision, when photon shot noise is no longer negligible and qualitatively reshapes peripheral information processing. Instead of decorrelation by center-surround receptive fields, receptive fields averaging the signal, i.e., they apply gain that enhances the correlations already present in the input in order to fight the detrimental effects of input noise. These special considerations, which are relevant for night vision, do not apply generally to the extensively-studied area of daylight vision."
