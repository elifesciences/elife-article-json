To understand how temporal input information is encoded and decoded by the NF-\u03baB system, we studied transcription factor dynamics and gene regulation under dose- and duration-modulated inflammatory inputs. Mathematical modeling predicted and microfluidic single-cell experiments confirmed that integral of the stimulus (or area, concentration \u00d7 duration) controls the fraction of cells that activate NF-\u03baB in the population. However, stimulus temporal profile determined NF-\u03baB dynamics, cell-to-cell variability, and gene expression phenotype. A sustained, weak stimulation lead to heterogeneous activation and delayed timing that is transmitted to gene expression. In contrast, a transient, strong stimulus with the same area caused rapid and uniform dynamics. These results show that digital NF-\u03baB signaling enables multidimensional control of cellular phenotype via input profile, allowing parallel and independent control of single-cell activation probability and population heterogeneity."

To understand how temporal input information is encoded and decoded by the NF-\u03baB system, we studied transcription factor dynamics and gene regulation under dose- and duration-modulated inflammatory inputs. Mathematical modeling predicted and microfluidic single-cell experiments confirmed that integral of the stimulus (or area, concentration \u00d7 duration) controls the fraction of cells that activate NF-\u03baB in the population. However, stimulus temporal profile determined NF-\u03baB dynamics, cell-to-cell variability, and gene expression phenotype. A sustained, weak stimulation lead to heterogeneous activation and delayed timing that is transmitted to gene expression. In contrast, a transient, strong stimulus with the same area caused rapid and uniform dynamics. These results show that digital NF-\u03baB signaling enables multidimensional control of cellular phenotype via input profile, allowing parallel and independent control of single-cell activation probability and population heterogeneity."

For example, in humans and other animals, a signaling pathway called NF-\u03baB signaling is part of the immune system and regulates the inflammation that is caused by damage to cells, or by an invading microbe. Several signal molecules, including a protein called TNF\u2014which is released by cells during an immune response\u2014activate NF-\u03baB signaling. However, the levels of TNF in the environment around a cell may fluctuate randomly even when there is no immune response.

One way cells can reduce sensitivity to noise is through digital or switch-like activation, such that only sufficiently strong signal exceeds an internal threshold and initiates a response. Switch-like activation occurs through diverse mechanisms (<a href=\"#bib47\">Shah and Sarkar, 2011</a>). For example, observations in <i>Xenopus</i> oocytes showed that the MAPK pathway converted graded progesterone input to digital output in p42 MAPK that determined oocyte maturation (<a href=\"#bib42\">Petty et al., 1998</a>). Subsequently, similar observations were seen for the JNK pathway (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bagowski and Ferrell, 2001</a>). The scaffolding protein Spe5 was found to mediate digital MAPK activation of mating in yeast (<a href=\"#bib31\">Malleshaiah et al., 2010</a>). More recently, it was found that inflammasome signaling leads to all-or-none caspase1 activation that mediates apoptosis (<a href=\"#bib29\">Liu et al., 2013</a>). Both amplitude (dose) and duration of input signals provide information that regulates cellular decisions. The duration of Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) stimulation modulates ERK dynamics and controls differentiation (<a href=\"#bib51\">Santos et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">von Kriegsheim et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Ahmed et al., 2014</a>). Glucose sensing in plants showed that cells have gene regulatory network mechanisms to allow similar responses to a short, intense or sustained, moderate stimulus (<a href=\"#bib10\">Fu et al., 2014</a>). Lymphocytes must precisely measure both antigen affinity and frequency to decide differentiation and proliferation (<a href=\"#bib17\">Iezzi et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Gottschalk et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Miskov-Zivanov et al., 2013</a>). Although digital pathway activation allows robust cellular decision across a wide range of systems, it is not clear how digital signaling impacts processing of dose and duration information."

NF-\u03baB activation occurs for a multitude of cell stress and inflammatory signals that converge on the IKK (I\u03baB Kinase) signaling hub, which induces degradation of the cytoplasmic inhibitor I\u03baB and liberates NF-\u03baB to enter the nucleus and regulate gene expression (<a href=\"#bib14\">Hayden and Ghosh, 2008</a>).

We found that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induces NF-\u03baB activation in a digital way where cells respond in an all-or-none fashion, but in a distinct manner from TNF, with greater ultrasensitivity and pronounced input-dependent activation delay. Computational modeling predicted and experiments confirmed that LPS integral over the stimulus or \u2018area\u2019 (concentration \u00d7 duration) controls the percentage of cells that activate in the population. Importantly, dynamics of NF-\u03baB activation depend on input temporal profile, so that a long duration, low-dose (LL) signal induces delayed, heterogeneous activation timing in the population while a short duration, strong amplitude (SS) signal with the same area causes rapid activation without cell-to-cell timing variability (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). These results reveal a function for digital signaling beyond simple noise filtering: digital activation controls fate along a two dimensional space by allowing an input signal to independently control the population response (percentage of responding cells) and single-cell response (transcription factor dynamics and gene expression phenotype) though modulation of signal area and shape."

Each experimental condition is measured in duplicate chambers on the chip. We found that LPS-exposed cells activated NF-\u03baB in an ultrasensitive, digital fashion. The population consisted of cells either responding or ignoring the LPS input, with the percentage of responding cells in the population scaling with LPS concentration, from 5% at 0.25 ng/ml to 100% at 500 ng/ml (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,D</a>). Amplitude is highly variable across doses. Median amplitude increases gradually with dose though this change is statistically less significant than change in response time (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). NF-\u03baB dynamics in activating cells showed small oscillations beyond the first peak. When ligand is flowed continuously through the chamber to replace ligand loss due to cellular internalization, oscillations sustain for the duration of the stimulus (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Under low intensity LPS stimulation, most cells did not respond (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,D</a>). This was a similar effect as previously observed under TNF (<a href=\"#bib49\">Tay et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Turner et al., 2010</a>). While both LPS and TNF are digital in preserving first peak area, the TNF-induced NF-\u03baB initial peak becomes flatter and wider with increasing response time but unchanging onset time for decreasing input dose, while LPS experiences greater dose-dependent onset delay and timing variability and maintains a consistent peak shape (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). The dose-response curve for LPS was steeper than that for TNF (fitted to Hill dynamics reveals Hill coefficients of 2.3 and 1.5, respectively) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). These results indicate that the LPS pathway activates in a switch-like manner, with increasing fraction of cells in the population responding as dose is increased, but with distinct activation dynamics compared to TNF input."

We explored how the increase in delay for 500 ng/ml LPS versus 50 ng/ml LPS impacted gene regulation. Notably, gene expression of early and intermediate genes exhibited a dose-dependent delay (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). The extent and magnitude of the dose-dependent delay and heterogeneity differs from TNF stimulation of the same cell type (<a href=\"#bib49\">Tay et al., 2010</a>). While decreasing TNF dose altered the response slope, LPS response maintained a stereotypical peak shape that shifts later in time with lower dose (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). Delayed gene expression observed under LPS stimulation contrasts with TNF-\u03b1 input that does not induce delayed induction of these genes (<a href=\"#bib49\">Tay et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">P\u0119kalski et al., 2013</a>). For early genes I\u03baB\u03b1 and A20, gene expression peak is shifted from 30 min to 1 hr after stimulation. I\u03baB\u03f5 expression shifts from maximum expression at 1 hr\u20132 hr and from 30 min to 2 hr for TNF mRNA under LPS input. Intermediate genes <i>Ccl2</i> and <i>Icam</i> shift expression peaks from 1 hr to 2 hr and from 1 hr to 3 hr (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>), respectively. Late genes <i>Ccl5</i> and <i>Casp4</i> do not reflect the delayed NF-\u03baB activation due to slower induction kinetics. Both NF-\u03baB dynamics in microfluidics and mRNA responses in tissue culture may be affected by autocrine signaling loops (<a href=\"#bib44\">P\u0119kalski et al., 2013</a>). Overall, these results indicate that LPS induces digital NF-\u03baB activation with an input dose-dependent delay that carries through to gene expression dynamics."

LPS activates NF-\u03baB by TLR4 engagement via CD14, leading to TLR4 dimerization. TLR4 dimers recruit MyD88, IRAK2/4, and other adaptor proteins leading to clustering and higher order assembly of Myddosome and TRAF6 lattice structures, which cooperatively activates IKK (<a href=\"#bib53\">Yin et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Lin et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Zanoni et al., 2011</a>). Following IKK activation, nuclear NF-\u03baB induces expression of I\u03baB\u03b1, which negatively regulates NF-\u03baB and IKK, respectively (<a href=\"#bib14\">Hayden and Ghosh, 2008</a>). Experimental I\u03baB\u03b1 expression kinetics were similar for LPS and TNF, despite induction delay under LPS (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>).

To introduce variability in the model, we allowed fluctuation in the number of TLR4 receptor molecules between cells. TLR4 is expressed at relatively low level compared to CD14 and furthermore varies significantly between cells in the population (<a href=\"#bib54\">Zanoni et al., 2011</a>). To account for cooperative activation due to Myddosome assembly and TRAF6 lattice formation, we model IKK phosphorylation by TRAF6 using Hill kinetics.

The distinct feature of the proposed LPS model is the Myddosome formation leading to cooperative activation of IKK (coopertivity coefficient = 4, note this value is distinct from the slope of the active cell fraction response curve), which simultaneously assures delay in activation observed experimentally for low doses, and steeper response curve than in the case of TNF stimulation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

In agreement with simulation predictions, we found that precisely controlled stimulus duration regulated the activation of cells in the population in a strongly all-or-none manner, with 1- to 40-s duration LPS exposure (500 ng/ml) activating \u223c3\u201388% of the population (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a> and Supplementary <a href=\"#media1 media2\">Videos 1, 2</a>). Short duration (i.e., 1 s) stimulation, mimicking very brief exposure to bacteria, activated a small percentage of cells in the population. Moreover, under short duration, strong amplitude (SS) input, responses were fast and uniform (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>, top row) in contrast to low, long (LL) stimulation that led to delayed, variable responses (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). For example, 3\u20135% activation occurred for both a 1-s short pulse at 500 ng/ml LPS (SS signal) and a 0.25 ng/ml constant input signal (LL signal) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). However, modulating duration of the SS signal from 1 s to 40 s (activating 3.3% and 87.5% the population, respectively) changes median response timing by less than 2 min (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,C</a>). Statistical analysis indicates no significant difference in response time under varied pulse durations (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). In contrast, modulating concentration of the LL signal from 0.25 to 500 ng/ml (activating 4.9% and 98% of the population, respectively) changes the response time more than 35 min (reduced from 80 to 43 min). Moreover, while the variability in the response time scales with dose under LL stimulation, timing variability remains low under duration-modulated SS stimulation (<a href=\"#fig4 fig5\">Figures 4D, 5C</a>). From an immunological perspective, this experiment indicates that brief but high pathogen load leads to uniform and strong NF-\u03baB response in the population, while chronic low-grade pathogen exposure leads to population variability and delay."

Together, these results indicated that SS input achieves control over the fraction of cells activating without affecting the dynamics in the response. Therefore, duration sensing allows control of percentage of cells that produce a response without affecting response timing or heterogeneity. This contrasts to amplitude (concentration) sensing, where response dynamics in activating cells differs for high versus low amplitude. Since NF-\u03baB dynamics influence gene expression, duration modulation to control percent population activation is therefore a strategy to achieve more homogeneous gene expression and phenotype outcomes between cells."

Duration sensing allows for controlling only the population response while not affecting the single-cell response, so that it is possible to achieve homogeneous dynamics and uniform phenotype in a desired proportion of cells. In contrast, it may be useful to transmit information that can instruct different dynamics and phenotype, which is achieved by modulating dose. While dose information is transmitted through the NF-\u03baB digital response, duration information is lost at the single-cell level."

In physiological settings, it may be desirable to transmit information without affecting population response, that is, for a signal to affect response dynamics in activating cells without impacting the proportion that activate. To achieve this requires modulating both dose and duration to maintain input area, leading to a shift in input temporal profile from a SS to a LL signal. Cells distinguish an SS versus LL signal profile based on NF-\u03baB and gene expression dynamics. We show that an intense, brief (SS) signal induces distinct dynamics than a weak, sustained (LL) signal, but the percentage of cells responding is the same in both cases (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Response timing and intensity are dynamic features that provide information for discriminating input temporal profile. Indeed, plotting response delay as a function of stimulus area shows that SS and LL signals can be distinguished on the basis of response delay (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). Cells can discern the category of the signal (whether SS or LL) for a given input area based on whether the response time falls above or below a separation line (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). Modulating input amplitude associated with higher timing variability than input duration modulation for controlling the fraction of active cells (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Because response amplitude exhibits high variability between cells, amplitude alone does not provide sufficient information to discriminate an SS versus LL signal (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Physiological cues are in fact commonly transmitted by changing from an SS to an LL input profile (<a href=\"#bib17\">Iezzi et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Fu et al., 2014</a>). Biological systems therefore appear to take advantage of the unique ability of digital signaling to separate control of population and single-cell dynamics, by modulating input area to determine the proportion of cells that activate in the population and input shape to instruct to determine phenotype outcomes in the activating subset of cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>)."

However, switch dynamics and gene expression phenotype varied depending on the input dose (single-cell response), with rapid homogeneous responses at high dose and delayed heterogeneous responses at low dose. Dynamics of transcription factor activation determine the timing and specificity of gene expression and phenotype responses (<a href=\"#bib52\">Werner et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Kobayashi et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Purvis et al., 2012</a>). Therefore, intercellular signaling systems may achieve distinct phenotype outcomes by controlling the input shape or temporal profile (whether SS or LL), while input area determines percentage of cells that respond (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). Greater heterogeneity with decreasing dose and decreased heterogeneity under short duration input is measured by coefficient of variation (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

A reciprocal relationship is observed between antigen quality and quantity in lymphocyte activation: Higher antigen affinity requires lower dose of antigen to trigger T-cell proliferation, and inversely, lower affinity requires higher dose (<a href=\"#bib13\">Gottschalk et al., 2012</a>). Moreover, an intense, transient compared to a weak, sustained signal induces positive versus negative selection of naive thymic T cells (<a href=\"#bib17\">Iezzi et al., 1998</a>) and T helper cell differentiation into alternatively CD4 or CD8 status (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adachi and Iwata, 2002</a>). Therefore, analogous to our findings, while a combination of antigen dose and contact duration determines the probability of activation, input profile determined by relationship between antigen quality and quantity decides the phenotypic outcome of lymphocyte activation."

Dose and duration sensing may be beneficial in different contexts. Dose information is encoded in the delay timing and heterogeneity of NF-\u03baB response. On the other hand, modulating duration on the sub-minute timescale does not regulate response dynamics. Indeed, achieving control of percentage active in a population without introducing heterogeneity requires modulating duration of a high-dose input (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). It was shown that signaling dynamics mediates transfer of input dose information (<a href=\"#bib45\">Selimkhanov et al., 2014</a>). We find that while dose information is transmitted through dynamics of NF-\u03baB activation, on short (minute) time scales duration, information is lost in the single-cell response but retained in the population response (fraction of activated cells)."

Distinct higher order adapter protein architectures may activate IKK with different effective coopertivities (<a href=\"#bib20\">Kazmierczak and Lipniacki, 2010</a>).

Heterogeneity in switching threshold between cells may arise from cell-to-cell expression differences in signalosome components such as RIP1/3, MyD88, IRAK2/4, and TRAF6, leading to altered kinetics of signalosome assembly and IKK activation. Because the IKK hub mediates NF-\u03baB responses for a multitude of input types and coordinates cross-talk with other signaling pathways, understanding how different signalosome architectures induce specific responses paves the way to interventions directed at switch-like signaling to modulate population and individual cell dynamics towards therapeutic outcomes (<a href=\"#bib33\">Negro et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Behar et al., 2013</a>). In this study, we have shown that the switch-like character of NF-\u03baB activation enables orthogonal control over two critical aspects of the response\u2014probability of activation (fraction of active cells) and the heterogeneity of response\u2014through the integral and temporal profile of the input. Secretion of signaling molecules often occurs in discrete or quantized way in the form of secretory bursts, and particularly in the case of short range paracrine signaling, cells may produce brief but intense secretion to achieve, for example, low probability but high predictability responses (non-heterogeneous dynamics). Overall, these results expand the repertoire of functions for digital signaling beyond increasing robustness to also facilitate multidimensional phenotype control based on temporal information in input signals."

Receptor level variation is a major source of heterogeneity between cells, though we acknowledge that other sources of heterogeneity could contribute (subsection \u201cCooperative IKK activation underlies dose-dependent response delay\u201d). The nonlinearity results from clustering and oligomerization of receptors and adapter proteins including MyD88 and TRAF6. Multiple studies support that clustering mediates digital activation in NF-\u03baB signaling (discussed in the aforementioned subsection) though we discuss other cases where additional factors may contribute (Introduction, first paragraph). We have updated the supplemental mathematical materials for clarity and with additional details of the methodology and justification in building the model."

We observed 500ng/ml LPS pulsed for 10 s activated approximately half the population (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Therefore we tested two additional input profiles having the same area (5000 ngml<sup>-1</sup>/s): 50ng/ml for 100s and 100ng/ml for 50s. In agreement with model prediction, each of these conditions also activates a similar fraction of the population (51% and 54%, respectively).
