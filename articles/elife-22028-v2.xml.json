These may restrict <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> (Mtb) growth, or progress to central necrosis and cavitation, facilitating pathogen growth. To determine factors leading to Mtb proliferation and host cell death, we used live cell imaging to track Mtb infection outcomes in individual primary human macrophages. Internalization of Mtb aggregates caused macrophage death, and phagocytosis of large aggregates was more cytotoxic than multiple small aggregates containing similar numbers of bacilli. Macrophage death did not result in clearance of Mtb. Rather, it led to accelerated intracellular Mtb growth regardless of prior activation or macrophage type. In contrast, bacillary replication was controlled in live phagocytes. Mtb grew as a clump in dead cells, and macrophages which internalized dead infected cells were very likely to die themselves, leading to a cell death cascade. This demonstrates how pathogen virulence can be achieved through numbers and aggregation states."

These may restrict <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> (Mtb) growth, or progress to central necrosis and cavitation, facilitating pathogen growth. To determine factors leading to Mtb proliferation and host cell death, we used live cell imaging to track Mtb infection outcomes in individual primary human macrophages. Internalization of Mtb aggregates caused macrophage death, and phagocytosis of large aggregates was more cytotoxic than multiple small aggregates containing similar numbers of bacilli. Macrophage death did not result in clearance of Mtb. Rather, it led to accelerated intracellular Mtb growth regardless of prior activation or macrophage type. In contrast, bacillary replication was controlled in live phagocytes. Mtb grew as a clump in dead cells, and macrophages which internalized dead infected cells were very likely to die themselves, leading to a cell death cascade. This demonstrates how pathogen virulence can be achieved through numbers and aggregation states."

Granulomas, which have a defined anatomical structure as well as segregated expression of immune system related proteins within the structure (<a href=\"#bib41\">Marakalala et al., 2016</a>), differentiate and mature independent of each other in infected tissues, most often the lung. The process of pulmonary granuloma formation is driven by macrophage phagocytosis of inhaled, viable Mtb, followed by extravasation of monocytes and T cells from the circulation and their accumulation at the site of infection (<a href=\"#bib55\">Ramakrishnan, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Russell, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Russell et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Barry et al., 2009</a>). However, granulomas do not always succeed in containing Mtb infection, and different granulomas in the same lung can control the infection or support the growth of the bacilli (<a href=\"#bib3\">Barry et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Lenaerts et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Lin et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Kaplan et al., 2003</a>). In the latter case, central necrosis within the granuloma, cavity formation, and breach into the airways, results in release of Mtb into the environment and transmission of the infection to another human host (<a href=\"#bib55\">Ramakrishnan, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Russell, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Russell et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Barry et al., 2009</a>). Thus, while Mtb is considered an intracellular pathogen infecting live cells, its proliferation during active pulmonary tuberculosis occurs in an environment containing many dead cells and cell remnants (<a href=\"#bib35\">Kaplan et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Hunter, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Hunter et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Welsh et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Irwin et al., 2015</a>)."

                        "text": "Part of the host response to Mtb infection is the\u00a0death of the infected phagocyte. Mtb-induced macrophage death has been observed to occur by apoptotic and non-apoptotic mechanisms. Apoptosis was reported to be protective against Mtb (<a href=\"#bib26\">Fratazzi et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Gan et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Keane et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Molloy et al., 1994</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib51\">Oddo et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Behar et al., 2010</a>). Evidence from mouse macrophages shows that protection is mediated through efferocytosis, the internalization of apoptotic cell fragments by macrophages, leading to the elimination of the Mtb inside the cellular fragments (<a href=\"#bib42\">Martin et al., 2012</a>). Mtb was also observed to induce non-apoptotic cell death, differentiated from apoptosis by the lack of caspase activation (<a href=\"#bib38\">Lee et al., 2006</a>), lack of DNA fragmentation (<a href=\"#bib37\">Keane et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Park et al., 2006</a>), and loss of membrane integrity (<a href=\"#bib54\">Park et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Dobos et al., 2000</a>). Mtb was not killed when necrotic cell death was induced by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (<a href=\"#bib46\">Molloy et al., 1994</a>). Mtb is reported to initiate non-apoptotic cell death by the breakdown of mitochondrial membrane integrity (<a href=\"#bib15\">Duan et al., 2002</a>), interference with host plasma membrane repair through inhibition of prostaglandin E2 (<a href=\"#bib12\">Divangahi et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Divangahi et al., 2010</a>), and secretion of a necrosis inducing toxin which kills macrophages by hydrolyzing NAD (<a href=\"#bib69\">Sun\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2015</a>). The inflammatory effect of non-apoptotic cell death resulting from the immediate loss of membrane integrity upon death (<a href=\"#bib21\">Fink and Cookson, 2005</a>) may allow for the recruitment of additional host phagocytes to the site of infection which may lead to infection spread (<a href=\"#bib8\">Clay et al., 2007</a>). In contrast, control of Mtb through apoptosis and autophagy (<a href=\"#bib6\">Castillo et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Gutierrez et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Watson et al., 2012</a>) may dampen the inflammatory response."

The adaptive immune response controls Mtb by activating macrophages with factors such as interferon gamma (IFN\u03b3) to kill or control the growth of the bacilli, and by targeting infected macrophages with cytotoxic lymphocytes (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cooper and Flynn, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Flynn et al., 1995</a>, <a href=\"#bib25\">1992</a>). However, given that different infection outcomes can coexist in the same lung, the source for variability (<a href=\"#bib61\">Russell et al., 2009</a>) in infection outcomes at different foci is not well understood. Substantial variability in other biological systems results from positive feedback (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kaern et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Sigal et al., 2006</a>). Positive feedback involves a cascade of events such that once an event occurs, the probability that it will occur again is increased. To understand how an environment conducive to bacterial growth and host cell death is sustained, we investigated virulent Mtb infection dynamics in primary human macrophages in vitro using time-lapse microscopy over approximately 80 hr at 10 min resolution."

Uptake of single large aggregates showed a higher frequency of cell death relative to the uptake of a similar number of bacteria as multiple small aggregates, and the time to death was inversely correlated to aggregate size. Once the host cell was killed, Mtb was able to rapidly grow inside the dead infected macrophage regardless of whether the cells were monocyte derived macrophages (MDM) or alveolar macrophages, or whether the cells were exposed to IFN\u03b3 prior to infection. Growth inside dead cells was significantly faster than in the extracellular environment. Once host cell death occurred, other macrophages internalized the dead infected cells, and this rapidly led to their own death, forming a cell death cascade. These observations of a cycle of host cell death followed by bacterial replication could drive Mtb infection dynamics of necrosis and bacterial proliferation in lung granulomas of patients with active tuberculosis disease."

MDM cell borders were determined by custom written image analysis software (<a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>, Materials and methods, <a href=\"#SD6-data\">Source code 1</a>). Time of cell death was determined to be the time point at which movement of internal cellular structures ceased or the cell detached (Materials and methods). This method of death determination was validated in macrophages with the DNA intercalating dye DRAQ7, which only enters the cell when membrane integrity has been compromised due to cell death (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). To examine whether Mtb fluorescence is a valid measure of Mtb number, we tracked the increase in Mtb by fluorescence versus colony forming units (CFU) over 3 days of growth. We found a tight correspondence between the two measures (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), with an incremental increase in fluorescence translating to an incremental increase in the number of bacilli as measured by CFU.

The aggregation state of Mtb has been hypothesized to impact host-pathogen interactions (<a href=\"#bib52\">Orme, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Sani et al., 2010</a>). Mtb naturally aggregate, unless cultured with a nonionic detergent such as Tween 80 (<a href=\"#bib16\">Dubos and Middlebrook, 1948</a>). To minimize modification of the outer surface of Mtb and its aggregation state (<a href=\"#bib64\">Sani et al., 2010</a>), we grew Mtb without detergent for several replication cycles and gently broke up aggregates resulting from such growth into a heterogeneous population of bacterial aggregation states. Hence, MDM in a single experiment were infected by individual bacteria or multibacterial clumps of various sizes (<a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). This enabled us to compare the consequences of MDM phagocytosis of different Mtb numbers and aggregation states in the same experiment. We converted Mtb fluorescent signal inside MDM to bacterial numbers by dividing the signal by the mean fluorescence of a single bacterium, with single Mtb obtained by filtering. We then ranked MDM from lowest to highest by the sum of Mtb internalized. This ranking gave the best separation in the frequency of cell death between the top 50% and bottom 50% of ranks (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). The raw data describing the outcome of the macrophage-Mtb interactions is presented in <a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>. The full dataset contains the dynamics of macrophage Mtb internalization and fate of 759 MDM, with 720 infected cells and 39 uninfected bystander cells. (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4B</a>). To compare the death frequencies between cells internalizing different numbers of Mtb over the course of the imaging, we divided the dataset into ten groups of infected cells, where cells internalizing a similar number of Mtb were grouped together and where each group constituted 10% of the total number of infected cells. We also compared death frequency to a group of bystander cells which did not phagocytose any Mtb. We then determined the frequency of cell death in each group, and as well as the mean number of Mtb in the group. Macrophage fate was found to depend on the number of Mtb internalized. As the number of bacteria internalized increased, there was more cell death and it occurred sooner (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Phagocytosis of small numbers of Mtb, less than approximately 10 bacilli, did not induce significantly more macrophage death than observed in uninfected bystander cells (<a href=\"#fig1s5\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). Above 10 Mtb internalized but below approximately 30, there was a trend toward increased macrophage death relative to bystander cells, but the differences in frequencies were not significant (see <a href=\"#fig1s5\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5B</a> for p-values and significance thresholds). The probability of death increased significantly relative to bystanders and cells with less than 10 Mtb when more than 30 Mtb were internalized per cell over the course of the movie, and a threshold for Mtb to induce death was clearly visible in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> at about 50 Mtb internalized, with differences relative to bystander and lightly infected cells becoming highly significant (<a href=\"#fig1s5\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5B</a>)."

This infection level was chosen so as to increase sensitivity by excluding very highly infected cells, which died with a high frequency, as well as lightly infected cells, which did not die at an appreciably higher frequency relative to bystanders. We obtained a lower frequency of cell death when infection occurred by multiple smaller pickups compared to single large pickups (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). While 47% of the\u00a0cells died when they accumulated Mtb in three or more internalizations, 71% of the\u00a0cells died when they internalized a similar mean number of Mtb as one pickup. The difference was significant (p=5\u00d710<sup>\u22124</sup> by bootstrap).

We represent each cell as a line, with pickup events (denoted as circles or stars, where are circles are internalizations of cell-free Mtb, and stars are internalizations of dead infected cells, both color coded according to the number of Mtb internalized) at a location on the line corresponding to the time of pickup.

To examine the mode of Mtb aggregate-induced cell death, we compared Mtb-induced cell death to that triggered by cisplatin, a chemotherapeutic agent that induces macrophage apoptosis by DNA damage (<a href=\"#bib77\">von Knethen et al., 1998</a>), and the toxin nigericin, reported to induce macrophage cell death by pyroptosis following LPS priming (<a href=\"#bib79\">Warny and Kelly, 1999</a>). In apoptosis, loss of membrane integrity is delayed to provide an opportunity for the removal of the dead cell (<a href=\"#bib19\">Fadok et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Vermes et al., 1995</a>). In pyroptosis, necrosis and other inflammatory cell death types, cell death involves the immediate loss of membrane integrity and spillage of cell contents (<a href=\"#bib21\">Fink and Cookson, 2005</a>). We used DRAQ7 to track loss of membrane integrity, and cessation of internal movement to define the point of cell death (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013B</a>, Materials and methods). Mtb typically induced phagocyte cell death with immediate loss of membrane integrity (<a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>), similar to nigericin induced cell death (<a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>), and consistent with a previous study using A549 epithelial cells (<a href=\"#bib14\">Dobos et al., 2000</a>). In contrast, cisplatin induced cell death was apparent significantly before incorporation of DRAQ7 (<a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a>, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>)."

Mtb-induced macrophage death did not lead to the\u00a0killing of the bacilli, and Mtb fluorescence levels increased in the dead cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, <a href=\"#media5\">Video 5</a>). While RFP or mCherry fluorescence possibly persists after Mtb death, the increase in fluorescent signal is a clear indication of Mtb replication (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a> is typical of the type of bacterial growth we observed: Mtb did not burst out of the cell to spread into the neighboring medium. Instead, the bacilli remained tightly associated with the dead host cell as a growing clump. Out of the 92 dead infected cells we evaluated, 90 showed positive growth rates while two had declining Mtb numbers (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Intracellular Mtb had a median doubling time, excluding the two negative values, of 24.7 hr (interquartile range 19 to 34 hr, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a> inset). The extracellular growth rate of Mtb in the same experiments had a median doubling time of 36.1 hr (interquartile range 31 to 44 hr, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a> inset), significantly slower than in dead cells (p=7\u00d710<sup>\u22128</sup>, Wilcoxon rank sum test). We confirmed these results by CFU, quantifying the number of Mtb after three days of growth in dead MDM versus extracellular growth in MDM medium. We initiated growth with the same concentrated Mtb culture, which killed approximately 99% of the MDMs after one day, thus allowing Mtb to replicate in the dead macrophages for at least two days (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). We recovered approximately an order of magnitude more Mtb by CFU after growth in dead cells versus after growth in the MDM extracellular medium (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>)."

Live macrophages internalized Mtb throughout the imaging period, and hence an increase in Mtb fluorescence could be the result of either new Mtb internalized, or existing Mtb growing in the live cell. Therefore, we marked the time each macrophage internalized Mtb, and used a 10 hr tracking window which could be fitted between internalization events for many of the cells. We calculated the median fold change in Mtb in this interval (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). For comparison, we used an interval of the same length in cells after death (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). In order to investigate the source of variability and the statistical significance of the data, we fitted the temporal dynamics of Mtb fluorescence of each individual infected MDM with an exponential curve. Variability in Mtb growth was evident in individual slopes in live macrophages, with Mtb growing in some cells and decreasing in others (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a> inset). Mtb growth in dead cells was less variable (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a> inset)."

                                "text": "We next examined host cell death and Mtb dynamics in several physiological contexts. The immune response to infection activates macrophages to mediate Mtb control (<a href=\"#bib60\">Russell et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Means et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Mosser, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Nau et al., 2002</a>). A key macrophage activator is IFN\u03b3, secreted by several immune cell types (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chackerian et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Flesch and Kaufmann, 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Cooper et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Flynn et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Fenton et al., 1997</a>). We therefore exposed MDM to IFN\u03b3 prior to infection and examined their response to internalized aggregates of Mtb. Infection with aggregates led to cell death which, similarly to untreated MDM, resulted in Mtb growth inside the dead infected cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). The median growth constant in dead MDM treated before death with IFN\u03b3 was 0.027 hour<sup>\u22121</sup> (interquartile range 0.0076 to 0.046), corresponding to a doubling time of 25.8 hr. Alveolar macrophages are responsible for the initial macrophage contact with the pathogen in the lung (<a href=\"#bib37\">Keane et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Fenton et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Nicholson et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Hirsch et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Keane et al., 1997</a>). Similarly to MDM, infection of these cells with aggregates led to cell death followed by Mtb intracellular growth (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). The median growth constant in dead alveolar macrophages was 0.028 hour<sup>\u22121</sup> (interquartile range 0.0014 to 0.055), corresponding to a doubling time of 24.6 hr. We have also quantified the extracellular Mtb growth rate during a ten-hour window (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). Here, the median growth constant was 0.018 hour<sup>\u22121</sup> (interquartile range 0.0015 to 0.034), corresponding to a 39.1 hr doubling time."

We selected from our dataset all live macrophages, which internalized dead infected macrophages before 90% of the video recording elapsed, to avoid cells where we could not capture the death event because it was too close to the end of the movie. While cell-free pickups of Mtb also occurred in some of these cells, internalization of a dead infected cell was the terminal internalization event in all but two of the observed cells. Frequency of cell death was 89% (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). There was a strong correlation between the time of internalization and death of the internalizing cell (R<sup>2</sup>\u00a0=\u00a00.93, p=8\u00d710<sup>\u221223</sup>, <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), with a median time to death of 3.2 hr (interquartile range of 1.5 to 6.0 hr). Chains of macrophage internalizations of dead infected cells, followed by cell death of the internalizing macrophage and uptake by the next cell, were also seen (<a href=\"#media7\">Video 7</a>). We compared the frequency of death from dead cell pickups to the frequency of death in cells internalizing large cell-free aggregates (81\u2013300 bacilli), which had a similar median number of bacteria (dead infected cells contained a median of 114 Mtb, versus 125 Mtb for cell-free aggregates). Death frequency was 81% for cells that internalized cell-free aggregates, and the difference between death frequencies was not significant (p=0.16). This indicated that the highly cytotoxic effect of dead infected cell internalization can be mostly explained by the high number of Mtb they contain."

                                "text": "If Mtb aggregates kill the phagocyte, remain associated with it, and grow in the dead cell, each new macrophage joining the infection chain should be faced with a greater or equal probability of cell death due to increasing Mtb numbers (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>, <a href=\"#media7\">Video 7</a>). To model the consequences of host cell death associated with bacterial growth, we performed numerical simulations to determine the number of dead host cells through time. Here, we do not claim to capture the exact dynamics of what occurs in vivo in the diseased lung, but rather illustrate the trend (see Materials and methods for simulation details). We compared the number of dead host cells when the Mtb doubling time in dead cells was one day, versus when it was two days (where two days is within the range of the doubling times observed for extracellular Mtb, which was 22\u201375 hr for the data presented in the inset of <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). As in the experimental results, host cell death was dependent on the bacterial number internalized, and host cells were restrictive of intracellular bacterial growth when alive and permissive when dead. A one day doubling time yielded substantially higher numbers of dead cells in many of the simulations (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>, left panels). Strikingly, only the one day doubling time in dead cells resulted in high Mtb growth over the simulation period of 60 days (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>, right panels). High Mtb growth was very sensitive to the doubling time (<a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), and this could not be explained by the differences in doubling time if growth was cell-free (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>, white lines in right panels), as both growth rates were rapid for the timescale of the simulations. Rather, this simplified simulation shows the presence of positive feedback in the host cell-Mtb interactions: faster Mtb growth in the dead cell leads to larger intracellular clumps upon phagocytosis by another cell, and hence to a higher probability of death of the phagocytosing cell, leading to Mtb growth in the new dead cell and a higher probability to kill the next phagocyte in the infection chain."

While in general Mtb bacilli are hard to find in intact closed granulomas (<a href=\"#bib40\">Lin et al., 2014</a>), high Mtb concentrations have been reported in vivo upon examination of the cavity surface in human tuberculous granulomas (<a href=\"#bib32\">Hunter, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Hunter et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Welsh et al., 2011</a>) as well as cavity containing granulomas in rabbits infected with experimental pulmonary TB (<a href=\"#bib35\">Kaplan et al., 2003</a>), and the cavity surface of granulomas with a necrotic core in the granuloma-forming Kramnik mouse model (<a href=\"#bib33\">Irwin et al., 2015</a>). Histologic examination has shown clumped bacteria as well as highly infected macrophages at the luminal surface of cavities in areas with extensive cellular necrosis (<a href=\"#bib35\">Kaplan et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Hunter, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Irwin et al., 2015</a>). While it can be inferred that high bacillary loads cause host cell death, this view is incomplete, as it lacks insight into the dynamic interactions between host cells and bacilli which cause the buildup of bacterial numbers and host necrosis at a particular site. Furthermore, since Mtb clumps are present in vivo, it is necessary to consider the effect of clumps on the dynamics of the host-pathogen interaction (<a href=\"#bib52\">Orme, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Sani et al., 2010</a>). This entails using non-detergent treated Mtb capable of aggregate formation. Here we used time-lapse microscopy of detergent untreated Mtb infection of primary human macrophages to map out the interactions between Mtb and the host macrophages. We quantified host cell-Mtb dynamics over 80 hr of growth at a 10 min resolution between time-lapse frames, necessary to capture several replication cycles of this slow growing pathogen. To our knowledge, this study is the first to use long duration time-lapse microscopy combined with automated image analysis to decipher Mtb infection dynamics of primary human macrophages."

However, in addition to the\u00a0multiplicity of infection, host cells were found to be sensitive to the aggregation state of the bacilli: pickup of a single large aggregate was more cytotoxic than pickup of several smaller aggregates with a similar total number of Mtb (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). After internalization of large clumps, macrophage death was rapid (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, <a href=\"#media1\">Videos 1</a>, <a href=\"#media5\">5</a> and <a href=\"#media7\">7</a>). The observed rapid breakdown of host cell membranes with Mtb induced cell death (<a href=\"#media2\">Videos 2</a> and <a href=\"#media5\">5</a>, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>) is consistent with reports of Mtb being present in the cytoplasm, as opposed to the phagosome (<a href=\"#bib62\">Russell, 2001</a>), of non-apoptotic cells (<a href=\"#bib73\">van der Wel et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">McDonough et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Simeone et al., 2012</a>).

These observations differ from results showing that efferocytosis leads to the elimination of Mtb (<a href=\"#bib42\">Martin et al., 2012</a>). However, the protective effect of efferocytosis may occur when cells die by apoptosis and the number of bacilli inside the dead cell is small while the number of uninfected macrophages is large, enabling the surrounding macrophages to divide up the bacillary load of a single dead infected cell.

Our results indicating acidification of Mtb (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C\u2013D</a>) are consistent with the presence of antimicrobial effector mechanisms that reduce Mtb growth in Mtb compartmentalized to the phagosome. Mtb can inhibit phagosome-lysosome fusion and complete phagosome acidification (<a href=\"#bib74\">Vergne et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Rohde et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Via et al., 1997</a>). However, acidification may occur when macrophages are activated with cytokines such GM-CSF (<a href=\"#bib11\">Denis and Ghadirian, 1990</a>), as are the MDMs used for this study. In this case, Mtb growth may be impaired or arrested in acidified vacuoles (<a href=\"#bib28\">Gomes et al., 1999</a>). Acidification was lost immediately upon cell death (<a href=\"#media6\">Video 6</a>, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C\u2013D</a>). However, loss of antimicrobial effector mechanisms may not be the only factor responsible for robust growth in dead cells, as growth is faster than in the extracellular medium, indicating that Mtb may have access to cytosolic nutrient sources, which promote growth in other intracellular pathogens (<a href=\"#bib2\">Appelberg, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Ray et al., 2009</a>). If Mtb growth in the dead cells was solely dependent of leakage of nutrients from the extracellular environment, the intracellular bacilli would not be expected to replicate any faster than extracellular Mtb.

Upon death, Mtb rapidly grows in the dead cell, with a doubling time faster than either in the extracellular environment or in live cells (where growth is minimal). The next macrophage to internalize the Mtb, this time encased in a dead cell, faces a larger Mtb clump and also dies.

Mtb were maintained in Difco Middlebrook 7H9 medium enriched with oleic acid-albumin-dextrose catalase supplement (BD, Sparks, MD). Three days before macrophage infection, Mtb were switched to grow in Tween 80-free media. On the day of infection, exponentially growing bacterial culture was pelleted at 2000\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0g for 10 min, washed twice with 10 ml PBS, and large aggregates broken up by shaking with sterilized 2\u20134 mm glass beads for 30 s. 10 ml of PBS was added and large clumps were further excluded by allowing them to settle for 5 min. An inoculum of 1 ml was taken from the center of the suspension for macrophage infections."

We converted Mtb fluorescent signal inside cells to bacterial numbers by dividing the signal by mean single Mtb fluorescence at the acquisition settings used for each experiment.

A doubling time of one day was what was experimentally measured in dead cells. To compare to a slower doubling time, for simplicity we used a value of two days, which was within the physiological range of Mtb growth (for example, the doubling time range for extracellular Mtb is 22\u201375 hr for the data shown in the inset of <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Each run was initiated with the internalization of 1 Mtb. Two approximations were made based on our experimental results: (1) No Mtb growth occurred inside live cells. (2) Probability of death after internalization of a dead infected cell depended only on the number of Mtb internalized. The probability of cell death <i>P<sub>D</sub>(m)</i> per day after Mtb internalization was determined experimentally from the time-lapse data and binned for simplicity for Mtb numbers <i>m\u00a0\u2264\u00a010</i>, <i>10\u00a0&lt; m \u2264 100</i>, and <i>m\u00a0&gt;\u00a0100</i>. Death probabilities were determined from the data to be <i>P<sub>D</sub>(m\u00a0\u2264\u00a010)=0.06</i>, <i>P<sub>D</sub>(10\u00a0&lt; m \u2264 100)=0.50</i>, and <i>P<sub>D</sub>(m\u00a0&gt;\u00a0100)=0.93</i>. To implement the cell death decision, a random number from a uniform distribution was drawn at each time increment. If the random number was less than or equal to <i>P<sub>D</sub>(m)</i>, then <i>N<sub>D</sub>(t\u00a0+\u00a01)=N<sub>D</sub>(t)+1</i>, else <i>N<sub>D</sub>(t\u00a0+\u00a01)=N<sub>D</sub>(t)</i>. After cell death at time <i>t</i>, there was a one day delay before the next pickup, and <i>m(t\u00a0+\u00a01)= m(t)e<sup>r</sup></i>, where <i>r = ln2/t<sub>d</sub></i>. Simulation script (Matlab) is attached as supplementary material. To examine the sensitivity of the number of Mtb after 60 days to doubling time, we ranged <i>t<sub>d</sub></i> from 1 to 3 days, and calculated the fraction of the simulations in which the number of Mtb expanded by more than three orders of magnitude (from 1 to\u00a0&gt;1000 bacilli)."
