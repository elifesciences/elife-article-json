Since this process is carried out inside her reproductive tract, the female can influence the outcome, and the males can too, via chemicals released in their ejaculates.

Furthermore, this worm's genetics have been well studied. Now, in <i>eLife</i>, Jody Hansen, Daniela Chavez and Gillian Stanfield\u2014who are all at the University of Utah\u2014have used the power of nematode genetics to transform our understanding of sperm competition (<a href=\"#bib3\">Hansen et al., 2015</a>)."

A series of beautiful studies showed that the competitive advantage of male sperm can be explained, in part, because they are larger than hermaphrodite sperm (<a href=\"#bib8\">LaMunyon and Ward, 1995</a>, <a href=\"#bib5\">1998</a>). Furthermore, comparisons between related species supported the idea that competition favored larger sperm in nematodes, and this model was confirmed by laboratory experiments (<a href=\"#bib6\">LaMunyon and Ward, 1999</a>, <a href=\"#bib7\">2002</a>)."

Inside a hermaphrodite, sperm are stored in the two structures called spermathecae and fight for positions near the maturing oocytes, where they will have the best chance of fertilization. Since each newly fertilized oocyte passes through the spermatheca, it dislodges many of the sperm, setting up a new round of competition to move into a good spot. Larger sperm appear to handle this intense competition better."

And, the sperm from <i>comp-1</i> mutant males also lose to sperm from normal males following a double mating (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Nevertheless, <i>comp-1</i> mutant hermaphrodites can still self-fertilize, and <i>comp-1</i> mutant males can fertilize \u2018true females\u2019 (hermaphrodites that are unable to make their own sperm). This indicates that the mutant sperm work fine in the absence of competition. Thus, <i>comp-1</i> controls an aspect of sperm competition that is independent of size. This idea is supported by the fact that larger <i>comp-1</i> mutant sperm (produced by <i>comp-1</i> males) are still favored over smaller <i>comp-1</i> mutant sperm (produced by <i>comp-1</i> hermaphrodites) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>)."

Since nematode sperm must crawl quickly towards the oocytes to compete, these defects suggest that the protein encoded by the <i>comp-1</i> gene is involved in sperm movement or guidance."

Indeed, nematode oocytes attract sperm by releasing a mixture of different hormone-like chemicals called \u2018prostaglandins\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib4\">Hoang et al., 2013</a>). Thus, the COMP-1 protein might control the ability of sperm to sense compounds like these, or to respond to and move towards them. If so, studying COMP-1 should dramatically deepen our understanding of how the control of sperm movement influences sperm competition (<a href=\"#bib10\">Pizzari and Parker, 2009</a>)."

Moreover, further genetic screens might identify additional players that control sperm competition."
