However, the signaling mechanisms that directly regulate this process are poorly understood. Here we show that the mammalian Rho GEF homolog, ECT-2, functions through the conserved RAS/ERK MAP kinase signaling pathway in the <i>C. elegans</i> germline to regulate the disassembly of SC proteins. We find that SYP-2, a SC central region component, is a potential target for MPK-1-mediated phosphorylation and that constitutively phosphorylated SYP-2 impairs the disassembly of SC proteins from chromosomal domains referred to as the long arms of the bivalents. Inactivation of MAP kinase at late pachytene is critical for timely disassembly of the SC proteins from the long arms, and is dependent on the crossover (CO) promoting factors ZHP-3/RNF212/Zip3 and COSA-1/CNTD1. We propose that the conserved MAP kinase pathway coordinates CO designation with the disassembly of SC proteins to ensure accurate chromosome segregation."

However, the signaling mechanisms that directly regulate this process are poorly understood. Here we show that the mammalian Rho GEF homolog, ECT-2, functions through the conserved RAS/ERK MAP kinase signaling pathway in the <i>C. elegans</i> germline to regulate the disassembly of SC proteins. We find that SYP-2, a SC central region component, is a potential target for MPK-1-mediated phosphorylation and that constitutively phosphorylated SYP-2 impairs the disassembly of SC proteins from chromosomal domains referred to as the long arms of the bivalents. Inactivation of MAP kinase at late pachytene is critical for timely disassembly of the SC proteins from the long arms, and is dependent on the crossover (CO) promoting factors ZHP-3/RNF212/Zip3 and COSA-1/CNTD1. We propose that the conserved MAP kinase pathway coordinates CO designation with the disassembly of SC proteins to ensure accurate chromosome segregation."

During meiosis, pairs of chromosomes are held together by a zipper-like structure called the synaptonemal complex. While held together like this, each chromosome in the pair exchanges DNA with the other by forming junctions called crossovers. Once DNA exchange is completed, the synaptonemal complex disappears from certain regions of the chromosome."

This revealed that a signaling pathway called the MAP kinase pathway regulates the removal of synaptonemal complex proteins from particular sites between the paired chromosomes. Turning off this pathway\u2019s activity is required for the timely disassembly of this complex, and depends on proteins that are involved in crossover formation."

This is accomplished by following a single round of DNA replication with two consecutive rounds of cell division (meiosis I and II) in which, first pairs of homologous chromosomes (bivalents), and then sister chromatids, separate away from each other. At center stage during prophase I of meiosis from yeast to humans is a tripartite proteinaceous structure known as the synaptonemal complex (SC) (<a href=\"#bib14\">Colai\u00e1covo, 2006</a>). The SC is a ladder-like structure comprised of lateral element proteins running along the axes of the homologs and central region proteins connecting these axes (<a href=\"#bib14\">Colai\u00e1covo, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Page and Hawley, 2003</a>). The SC is required to stabilize the interactions between pairs of homologous chromosomes and for interhomolog crossover (CO) formation in budding yeast, worms, flies, and mice (<a href=\"#bib47\">Nag et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Storlazzi et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Page and Hawley, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">MacQueen et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Colai\u00e1covo et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">de Vries et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Smolikov et al., 2007a</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">2007b</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">2009</a>), all of which are prerequisite steps for achieving accurate chromosome segregation at meiosis I. Importantly, the SC must be disassembled prior to the end of prophase I to ensure timely and proper chromosome segregation (<a href=\"#bib67\">Sourirajan and Lichten, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Jordan et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Dix et al., 1997</a>). Several proteins have been recently implicated in regulating the disassembly of SC proteins, including polo-like kinase in mammals and budding yeast, Ipl1/Aurora B kinase in budding yeast, the condensin complex component dcap-g in flies and both AKIR-1 (a member of the akirin protein family) and ZHP-3 (ortholog of budding yeast Zip3) in worms (<a href=\"#bib67\">Sourirajan and Lichten, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Jordan et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Resnick et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Jordan et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Clemons et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bhalla et al., 2008</a>). However, whether these factors directly regulate the SC in vivo and the mechanisms by which they promote the disassembly of SC proteins are not fully understood."

Importantly, factors required for CO formation are necessary for the asymmetric disassembly of the SC and localized retention of SC central region proteins. Since in <i>C. elegans,</i> a single CO occurs at the terminal third of every pair of homologous chromosomes, we proposed that chromosomes remodel around the single off-centered CO event at the pachytene-diplotene transition. This results in bivalents with a cruciform configuration comprised of two perpendicular chromosomal axes (namely the long and short arm domains) intersecting at the chiasma, where the long arms face the poles and the short arms occupy an equatorial position on the metaphase plate (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib46\">Nabeshima et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Riddle et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Maddox et al., 2004</a>). This remodeling includes changes in chromosome compaction as well as changes in both the localization and the types of proteins associated with the long and short arm domains (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib46\">Nabeshima et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Chan et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">de Carvalho et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Martinez-Perez and Villeneuve, 2005</a>).

A single pair of homologous chromosomes (bivalent) is shown for simplicity. Upon entrance into pachytene, the SC is present along the full length of the pairs of homologous chromosomes. CO formation is completed within the context of fully synapsed chromosomes, and in worms, a single CO is formed per homolog pair usually at an off-centered position. Chromosome remodeling has been proposed to take place around the off-centered CO (or CO precursor) resulting in a cruciform configuration comprised of two intersecting perpendicular chromosomal axes of different lengths (long and short arms of the bivalent, corresponding to the longest and shortest distances from the off-centered CO/CO precursor site to opposite ends of the chromosomes). This remodeling involves disassembly of central region components of the SC (SYP-1/2/3/4) along the long arms of the bivalents starting during late pachytene and diplotene resulting in the restricted localization of these proteins to the short arms. During diplotene and diakinesis, chromosomes undergo condensation as evidenced by a coiling of the arms and increased bivalent compaction. In late diakinesis, the SC proteins located on the short arms are replaced by AIR-2, which promotes the separation of the homologs at the end of meiosis I.

This consists of CO licensing during mid-pachytene followed by CO designation at or just prior to the mid-to-late pachytene transition in a manner dependent of the pro-CO factor COSA-1/CNTD1. Since DSBs outnumber COs in most species (<a href=\"#bib40\">Martinez-Perez and Colai\u00e1covo, 2009</a>) this has been proposed as a strategy to pare down the number of early recombination sites that will become CO sites thus both ensuring and limiting the number of COs. These and other features of meiosis in <i>C. elegans</i>, including the existence of various markers that distinguish the short and long arm subdomains and the CO precursor sites, therefore provide an ideal scenario to understand the regulation of the disassembly of the SC proteins from distinct chromosome subdomains and late prophase I chromosome remodeling."

We show that ECT-2 functions through the conserved MAP kinase pathway to regulate the asymmetric disassembly of SC proteins during prophase I of meiosis. We show that MPK-1 potentially directly phosphorylates SYP-2, a central region component of the SC, and that constitutively phosphorylated SYP-2 impairs the disassembly of SC proteins from the long arms. Moreover, inactivation of MPK-1 takes place in late pachytene in a manner dependent on pro-CO factors ZHP-3/RNF212/Zip3 and COSA-1/CNTD1 and concomitant with the initiation of SC disassembly. Therefore, we propose a model in which MPK-1 is inactivated in response to CO designation resulting in either de novo loading of unphosphorylated SYP-2 or dephosphorylation of chromatin-associated SYP-2, which triggers disassembly of SC proteins from along the long arms. Thus, coordination between CO designation and the disassembly of SC proteins executed via a conserved MAP kinase pathway is critical for ensuring accurate chromosome segregation during meiosis."

ECT-2 (Epithelial Cell Transforming sequence 2) is a highly conserved protein, initially identified as a proto-oncogene in cell culture (<a href=\"#bib43\">Miki et al., 1993</a>). It encodes a Guanine nucleotide Exchange Factor (GEF) that belongs to the Dbl family and functions as a key activator of Rho GTPase mediated signaling with roles during cytokinesis, DNA damage-induced cell death, cell polarity establishment during embryogenesis, vulval development, and epidermal P cell migration (<a href=\"#bib52\">Prokopenko et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Saito et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Morita et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Srougi and Burridge, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Canevascini et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Motegi and Sugimoto, 2006</a>). Although ECT2 is expressed in testis and ovaries in humans (<a href=\"#bib28\">Hirata et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Fields and Justilien, 2010</a>), understanding its role during mammalian meiosis is challenging due to its earlier roles in development. The availability of conditional mutants, such as temperature-sensitive mutants in <i>C. elegans,</i> therefore provided a unique opportunity to discover a novel role for ECT-2 in meiosis."

Importantly, we shifted <i>ect-2(ax751rf)</i> worms to the non-permissive temperature at the L4 larval stage to bypass the requirements for ECT-2 during somatic development and germ cell mitotic proliferation such as seen in <i>ect-2(e1778)</i> null mutants, which are sterile and exhibit fewer germ cells with abnormal nuclei (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). <i>ect-2(ax751rf)</i> mutants also exhibited a reduced brood size, increased embryonic lethality and a High Incidence of Males (Him) at the non-permissive temperature, all phenotypes indicative of increased meiotic chromosome nondisjunction (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>)."

In <i>ect-2(ax751rf)</i> mutants, SC formation is indistinguishable from wild type in most of the meiotic nuclei except for a few pachytene nuclei (11.1%, n=120/1080 pachytene nuclei) which display reduced SC assembly (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1C and D</a>). SC disassembly occurred as in wild type, initiating in late pachytene and resulting in the restricted localization of the central region proteins of the SC, as exemplified by SYP-1, to the short arm of the bivalents (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In contrast, <i>ect-2(zh8gf)</i> gain-of-function mutants, in which a mutation in an auto-inhibitory BRCT domain retains ECT-2 in its constitutively active configuration (<a href=\"#bib6\">Canevascini et al., 2005</a>), exhibited defects in both SC assembly and disassembly at the non-permissive temperature. Specifically, the SC failed to assemble on the chromosomes and instead SYP-1 formed aggregates referred to as polycomplexes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Those nuclei that had already gone through the leptotene/zygotene stage before the temperature shift showed normal synapsis during early and mid pachytene stages, but the central region components of the SC remained localized along the long arms of the bivalents and failed to become restricted to the short arms during late prophase (a defect herein referred to as impaired disassembly of the SC proteins) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). Importantly, the HORMA domain containing lateral element protein HTP-3, exhibits a wild type pattern of localization in <i>ect-2</i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1C,D</a> and <a href=\"#fig2\">2</a>). This suggests that ECT-2 acts in a specific manner to regulate SC dynamics, which involves regulating central region components of the SC."

The RAS/ERK (Extracellular signal-regulated kinase) MAP Kinase signaling regulates various aspects of the cell cycle and components of the signaling cascade are highly conserved between <i>C. elegans</i> and mammals (<a href=\"#bib70\">Sundaram, 2013</a>). In <i>C. elegans</i>, the ERK MAP kinase, MPK-1, is expressed in both somatic tissues as well as in the germline where it controls several aspects of germ line development including pachytene progression and germ cell survival (<a href=\"#bib10\">Church et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Kritikou et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Lee et al., 2007</a>). However, the role of MPK-1 in SC dynamics has never been explored. We therefore tested whether the ERK MAP kinase pathway regulates SC dynamics in the germline. Analysis of <i>mpk-1(ga117)</i> null, <i>mpk-1(ga111lf)</i> and <i>mpk-1(ku1lf)</i> temperature-sensitive loss-of-function mutants revealed defects in SC assembly as indicated by the formation of polycomplexes, similar to <i>ect-2(zh8gf)</i> mutants at the non-permissive temperature (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). However, germline nuclei that had already passed through the leptotene/zygotene stage before the temperature shift exhibited normal SC tracts along chromosomes at the pachytene stage (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Since nuclei fail to progress from early/mid-pachytene to late-pachytene in <i>mpk-1(ga117)</i> null mutants (<a href=\"#bib37\">Lee et al., 2007</a>), we analyzed the disassembly of SC proteins in <i>mpk-1(ga111lf)</i> mutants. The <i>mpk-1(ga111)</i> temperature sensitive loss-of-function mutant has been shown to still have a low level of dpMPK-1 activity and an incompletely penetrant pachytene arrest phenotype (<a href=\"#bib37\">Lee et al., 2007</a>). Nuclei that were able to progress from pachytene to diplotene exhibited normal SC disassembly similar to the <i>ect-2(ax751rf)</i> mutant (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>)."

A <i>let-60(ga89gf)</i> temperature-sensitive gain-of-function mutant leads to constitutive activation of MAP kinase both in somatic tissues and the germline (<a href=\"#bib37\">Lee et al., 2007</a>). Similar to the <i>ect-2(zh8gf)</i> mutant, <i>let-60(ga89gf)</i> mutants exhibit defects in both SC assembly, as evidenced by the presence of polycomplexes, and the disassembly of the SC proteins from the long arms of the bivalents, where they persisted at the non-permissive temperature (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Similar defects in the disassembly of SC proteins are also observed in the <i>lip-1(zh15rf)</i> reduction-of-function mutant (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>), where the LIP-1 phosphatase fails to inactivate, MPK-1 in late pachytene, which therefore persists throughout pachytene, diplotene and diakinesis (<a href=\"#bib27\">Hajnal and Berset, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Rutkowski et al., 2011</a>), suggesting that the constitutive presence of active MPK-1 impairs the disassembly of SC proteins from the long arms of the bivalents. In contrast, we did not observe any defects in SC assembly in <i>lip-1(zh15rf)</i> (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Further, we found that LAB-1 localization was not altered in either <i>let-60(ga89gf)</i> or <i>lip-1(zh15rf)</i> mutants suggesting that MAP kinase specifically regulates the disassembly of SC proteins from the long arms of the bivalents and not other aspects of late prophase chromosome remodeling (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). Altogether these data suggest that the MAP kinase pathway plays an essential role in regulating the disassembly of SC proteins whereas the defects we see in SC assembly might be a secondary consequence of the role of MAP kinase in mitosis or due to several other germline functions of MPK-1."

We next tested whether the Rho GTPase, RHO-1, activates ERK MAP kinase signaling in the germline, similar to its role in the regulation of vulval development (<a href=\"#bib6\">Canevascini et al., 2005</a>). Given the highly abnormal gonads observed following strong loss of <i>rho-1</i> function, partial RNAi knockdown of <i>rho-1</i> was performed to obtain germlines with essentially wildtype morphology/organization (see Materials and Methods). Similarly to the <i>ect-2(ax751rf)</i> mutant, partial depletion of <i>rho-1</i> also results in reduced dpMPK-1 signal in the mid-late pachytene region (<a href=\"#fig2s6\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 6</a>). In addition, the expression pattern of RHO-1 is similar to that observed for ECT-2 in the germline (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). In contrast to <i>ect-2(ax751rf)</i> mutants and to <i>rho-1</i> partial knock down, dpMPK-1 expression is not turned off at late pachytene and during diplotene in the <i>ect-2(zh8gf)</i> mutant.

First we examined the central region components of the SC, SYP-1, SYP-2, SYP-3 and SYP-4, for the presence of potential MAP kinase phosphorylation sites using the phosphorylation site predictor programs GPS 2.1 and KinasePhos 2.0 (<a href=\"#bib76\">Wong et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Xue et al., 2008</a>). This identified potential MAP kinase phosphorylation sites on SYP-1, SYP-2, SYP-4 and none on SYP-3 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Next, to verify the predicted MAP kinase phosphorylation sites in the SYP proteins, we immunoprecipitated the SYP-1/2/3 proteins from lysates of adult worms expressing either SYP-2::GFP or SYP-3::GFP and performed extensive mass spectrometry analysis to look for post-translational modifications (a similar analysis was not possible for SYP-4 given that neither functional antibodies or tagged transgenic lines are currently available). In addition, a phospho-proteomics approach was applied to wild type lysates to further confirm the MAP kinase phosphorylation sites in the SYP proteins (see Materials and methods). These combined approaches confirmed that SYP-2 is phosphorylated at S25, a potential MAP kinase phosphorylation site (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A and B</a>)."

CIP treatment results in phosphate removal and a faster running band for SYP-2, whereas when CIP activity is inhibited using EDTA two bands are detected corresponding to the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms of SYP-2 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). This shows that SYP-2 is phosphorylated in vivo and that SYP-2 exists in both phosphorylated as well as unphosphorylated forms. Further, in <i>mpk-1(ga117)</i> null mutants, the upper band corresponding to phosphorylated SYP-2 is not present, suggesting that phosphorylation of SYP-2 is dependent on MAP kinase. In <i>let-60(ga89gf)/RAS</i> gain-of-function mutants, we detect two bands corresponding to the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated SYP-2 protein, instead of only the phosphorylated band. This could be due to only a subset of the SYP-2 protein being phosphorylated by MPK-1. This is consistent with the expression pattern of MPK-1 in the germline where the active form of dpMPK-1 is expressed only from mid to late pachytene. Meanwhile, SYP-2 is expressed from the leptotene/zygotene stage to late diakinesis. Therefore, SYP-2 could be phosphorylated by dpMPK-1 at the mid to late-pachytene region thereby regulating the localization of SYP-2 in a spatio-temporal manner. Further, we found that the SYP-2 (S25A) phosphodead mutant protein runs at the same size of the unphosphorylated SYP-2 band, suggesting that there are no additional phosphorylation sites in the SYP-2 protein (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). We used SYP-3 as a negative control, since our analyses indicate it lacks phosphorylation sites, and we did not detect any shift in band size (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). While this suggests that there may only be an unphosphorylated form of SYP-3, we cannot rule out the possibility that either a small fraction of SYP-3 in the extract tested is phosphorylated or that phosphorylation may not lead to a mobility shift under the conditions utilized in this analysis. We used MPK-1 as a positive control, where the band corresponding to dpMPK-1 (phosphorylated form of MPK-1) is not present after CIP treatment whereas it is present when CIP activity is inhibited (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>).

We generated lines where the S25 residue was mutated to either an alanine to generate a phosphodead mutant or to aspartic acid to generate a phosphomimetic mutant. We did not observe defects in either SC assembly or disassembly in the <i>syp-2</i> phosphodead mutant (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This result was not surprising since the <i>mpk-1(ga111lf)</i> mutant did not show any defects in the disassembly of SC proteins at the non-permissive temperature and we already hypothesized that the SC assembly defects we see in both <i>mpk-1</i> loss- and gain-of-function mutants could be due to other roles played by MPK-1 in germline development or through its effects on different target proteins. However, in the <i>syp-2</i> phosphomimetic mutant, while SC assembly was normal, the disassembly of SC proteins was impaired as exemplified by SYP-1, SYP-2, SYP-3 and SYP-4 persisting on the long arms and failing to become restricted to the short arms of the bivalents (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3</a>).

However, we see a reduction in brood size (109 \u00b1 32), accompanied by 14.3% embryonic lethality and 2.1% males, in <i>syp-2</i> phosphomimetic mutants indicating that impaired disassembly of the SC proteins results in defects in chromosome segregation.

                                "text": "Disassembly of SC proteins is impaired and the SYP proteins fail to be properly restricted to a chromosome subdomain during late prophase in crossover-defective mutants such as <i>spo-11, msh-5, msh-4, zhp-3</i> and <i>cosa-1</i>, which instead often continue to retain the SYP proteins along the full lengths of the chromosome axes (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bhalla et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Nabeshima et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Yokoo et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Martinez-Perez et al., 2008</a>). Our study of HIM-18/Slx4, which is involved in the resolution of Holliday junction intermediates into COs, indicated that the symmetry-breaking event detected at late pachytene is likely a CO precursor and not a completed CO event (<a href=\"#bib59\">Saito et al., 2009</a>). Specifically, analysis of <i>him-18</i> null mutants showed six ZHP-3 foci per oocyte marking the six CO precursor sites also observed in wild type during late pachytene, and the establishment of long and short arm domains as indicated by LAB-1, SYP-1 and AIR-2 localization. Since our current study indicates that the MPK-1 pathway regulates the disassembly of SC proteins we tested the hypothesis that MPK-1 coordinates recognition of a CO precursor/intermediate with disassembly of SC proteins from the long arms of the bivalents. First, active dpMPK-1 and foci for the pro-CO factor COSA-1 are both observed at the same time in pachytene stage nuclei suggesting a correlation between CO precursors and active MPK-1 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Second, we observed a significant persistence of dpMPK-1 signal in <i>zhp-3</i> and <i>cosa-1</i> mutants compared to wild type suggesting that inactivation of MPK-1 is linked to formation of a CO precursor (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B and C</a>). Third, the defect in disassembly of SC proteins observed in <i>cosa-1</i> mutants is fully rescued in a <i>cosa-1 mpk-1(lf)</i> double mutant and partly rescued in <i>ect-2(rf);cosa-1</i> and <i>cosa-1;syp-2(S25A)</i> double mutants (11.5% and 40.9% suppression of the <i>cosa-1</i> disassembly defect phenotype, respectively) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). The partial suppression observed in <i>ect-2(rf);cosa-1</i> mutants can be ascribed to the fact that <i>ect-2(rf)</i> is a reduction-of-function mutant and still has dpMPK-1 activity as indicated in <a href=\"#fig2s5\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 5</a> as well as by the presence of phoshorylated SYP-2 detected on Westerns (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). The <i>cosa-1; syp-2(S25A)</i> partial rescue leads us to hypothesize that there may be additional kinases regulating the other SYP proteins in an MPK-1-dependent manner. Indeed, while we did not find evidence for additional MPK-1 phosphorylation sites on SYP-2, there are additional phosphorylation sites for other kinases, such as the polo-like kinase, on SYP-1 and SYP-4, verified by mass spectrometry (Nadarajan and Colaiacovo, unpublished and PHOSIDA (<a href=\"http://www.phosida.com\">http://www.phosida.com</a>) and Polo-like kinase itself was identified as a target of MPK-1 in <i>C. elegans</i> (<a href=\"#bib2\">Arur et al., 2009</a>). While the roles exerted by these additional kinases on the SC remain to be investigated, our observations support a role for MPK-1 in coordinating recognition of a CO precursor with asymmetric disassembly of SC proteins."

Here we provide novel insight into the regulation of the disassembly of SC proteins from along the long arms of the bivalents in response to progression through the CO specification pathway via regulation of phosphorylation of a central region component of the SC. First, we discovered a novel role for ECT-2 in the regulation of SC dynamics during prophase I of meiosis. Second, we showed that ECT-2 functions through the conserved MAP kinase pathway to regulate the disassembly of SC proteins. Third, we showed that SYP-2 is a potential direct target of phosphorylation by the MAP kinase pathway both in vivo and in vitro, and that constitutively phosphorylated SYP-2 impairs the disassembly of SC proteins from the long arms of the bivalents. Fourth, we showed that pro-crossover factor COSA-1 and dpMPK-1 are expressed at the same time in the pachytene region, and that inactivation of dpMPK-1 at the late pachytene and diplotene regions requires the pro-crossover activities of ZHP-3 and COSA-1. Taken together, these data identify the MAP kinase-dependent phosphorylation of SYP-2 as part of a mechanism set in place to trigger the disassembly of SC proteins once CO designation occurs."

Similarly, the <i>C. elegans</i> SC has been proposed to be a dynamic structure that can disassemble and reassemble locally in response to exogenous DNA damage induced by irradiation (<a href=\"#bib15\">Couteau and Zetka, 2011</a>). Here, we identify a regulatory mechanism underlying the important step of disassembly of the SC proteins from the long arms of the bivalents. Our studies have revealed the existence of both a phosphorylated and an unphosphorylated pool of SYP-2 protein. We propose that SYP-2 is phosphorylated by MPK-1 at the S25 site and that this must take place during the mid to late pachytene stage when activated MPK-1 is expressed. Our studies revealed that a constitutively phosphorylated SYP-2 resulted in an inability to remove the SYP proteins from the long arms of the bivalents in a timely manner. However, an inability to phosphorylate SYP-2 at S25 does not affect either SC assembly or disassembly, and we did not detect residual or novel phosphorylation in <i>syp-2(S25A)</i> mutants in our CIP assays. These observations lead us to suggest that phosphorylation of SYP-2 at S25 may 'prime' this protein for subsequent dephosphorylation once crossover designation is detected. This would ensure that homologous interactions are not prematurely dissolved until CO specification takes place, thus guaranteeing that homologs are locked and ensuring subsequent accurate chromosome segregation. The CO precursor markers and dpMPK-1 are expressed during the same time in the germline (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>), suggesting that the timing when CO designation is completed coincides with when dpMPK-1 is turned off (germ cells progress from pachytene to diplotene). Our model is that MPK-1 functions as part of a surveillance mechanism in the pachytene region that recognizes the CO precursor and triggers the disassembly of SC proteins from along the long arms of the bivalents upon CO designation (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). Our model is further supported by the impaired disassembly of SC proteins detected in the absence of CO designation in <i>zhp-3</i> and <i>cosa-1</i> mutants (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bhalla et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Yokoo et al., 2012</a>) and our observation that dpMPK-1 persists into late pachytene and diplotene in <i>zhp-3</i> and <i>cosa-1</i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B and C</a>)."

                                "text": "The SYP proteins are removed from the chromosomes in two steps, first SYPs are lost from the long arms of the bivalents in the late pachytene to early diplotene stage nuclei, but are selectively maintained on the short arms of the bivalents until late diakinesis (-3 oocyte; <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). In the second step, the SYP proteins are lost from the short arms of the bivalents. This second round of removal might be regulated in a manner independent of the MAP kinase pathway. This is supported by our observation that the SYP proteins are able to disassemble from the short arms of the bivalents in <i>fog-2(oz40)</i> female animals where MPK-1 is not active in the proximal oocytes, in a manner indistinguishable from wild type (Nadarajan and Colaiacovo, unpublished results). How then are the SYP proteins selectively lost from the long arms but not from the short arms of the bivalents during the diplotene stage? There are several possible ways this could be carried out: 1) There could be proteins localizing to the short arms of the bivalents in late pachytene to prevent loss of the SYP proteins specifically from the short arms; 2) a phosphatase could specifically localize to the long arms of the bivalents and dephosphorylate the SYP-2 protein located only on that chromosome subdomain thereby leading to loss of SYP proteins from the long arms while localization of this phosphatase to the short arms of the bivalents could be blocked by other proteins; and 3) there might be factors preventing the addition of unphosphorylated SYP-2 protein on the short arms of the bivalents. In fact, there are precedents for such modes of regulation acting on the short/long arms of the bivalents, as exemplified by LAB-1, the ortholog of Shughoshin in <i>C. elegans</i>, and the HORMA domain containing proteins HTP-1/HTP-2. LAB-1 localizes exclusively to the long arm of the bivalents in late prophase where it prevents Aurora B Kinase, AIR-2, from loading on the long arm of the bivalents and restricts its localization to the short arm by recruiting the PP1/Glc7 phosphatases GSP-1 and GSP-2, thereby ensuring homologous chromosome segregation during meiosis I and sister chromosome segregation during meiosis II (<a href=\"#bib16\">de Carvalho et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Tzur et al., 2012</a>). Similar to LAB-1, the HORMA domain containing HTP-1/2 proteins relocalize from being associated along the full length of the chromosomes to being exclusively localized to the long arm of the bivalents during chromosome remodeling in late prophase I (<a href=\"#bib41\">Martinez-Perez et al., 2008</a>). It has been suggested that differentially regulated pools of HTP-1/2 near the chromosome axes and/or post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation within the closure motifs of HTP-3, which remains associated with both long and short arms and with whom HTP-1/2 interact, could contribute to their distinct localization (<a href=\"#bib35\">Kim et al., 2014</a>)."

                                "text": "How conserved is the asymmetric disassembly of SC proteins? This process occurs not only in <i>C. elegans,</i> but also in budding yeast, flies and mice. In both yeast and flies, the SC disassembles asymmetrically and persists associated with the centromere until late prophase (<a href=\"#bib48\">Newnham et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Takeo et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Gladstone et al., 2009</a>). Similarly in mouse spermatocytes, the SC is lost along the length of the chromosome but is retained at paired centromeres (<a href=\"#bib53\">Qiao et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Bisig et al., 2012</a>). Studies in yeast show that the SC that persists at centromeres, after the SC disassembles throughout other regions of the chromosomes, promotes centromere bi-orientation thereby ensuring homologous chromosome segregation at meiosis I (<a href=\"#bib24\">Gladstone et al., 2009</a>). In mouse spermatocytes, the SC that persists between the chiasmata, after SC disassembly in the pachytene region, is proposed to regulate local remodeling of homologous chromosome axes thereby promoting centromere and chiasmata functions, which are to ensure proper homolog segregation at meiosis I (<a href=\"#bib53\">Qiao et al., 2012</a>). While chromosomes in <i>C. elegans</i> are holocentric, and therefore lack a localized centromere, we propose that the CO designation-triggered asymmetric disassembly of SC proteins, and concomitant chromosome remodeling, are set in place to ensure that the short arm of the bivalents can function in a manner orthologous to centromeres to promote bi-orientation of the homologs thereby ensuring accurate segregation of homologous chromosomes during meiosis I suggesting the existence of a conserved regulatory mechanism. Further support for this stems from the demonstration that chromosome segregation at meiosis I in <i>C. elegans</i> occurs by outward pushing forces from microtubules assembling at the interface between the short arms of the separating homologs (<a href=\"#bib19\">Dumont et al., 2012</a>). Lastly, both mammalian ECT2 and the ERK/MAP kinase are expressed in testis and ovaries (<a href=\"#bib28\">Hirata et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Fields and Justilien, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Inselman and Handel, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Nissan et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Uhl\u00e9n et al., 2015</a>). We have found that some of the central region components of the mammalian SC, namely SYCE1, SYCE2 and TEX12, contain putative MAP kinase phosphorylation sites predicted by GSP 2.0 ([<a href=\"#bib76\">Wong et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Xue et al., 2008</a>]; <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Moreover, the predicted ERK/MPK kinase phosphorylation sites in SYCE1 (S308) and TEX12 (S27) are conserved between mice and humans, and the S308 site in SYCE1 has been confirmed by mass spectrometry analysis as being phosphorylated in vivo in mice (<a href=\"#bib30\">Huttlin et al., 2010</a>), raising the interesting possibility that we uncovered a conserved mode of regulation for asymmetric disassembly of SC proteins shared between worms and mammals."

Otherwise the site of modification was deemed to be ambiguous and phosphopeptides are reported as the start-end residues within the protein sequence."

We understand the reviewer\u2019s point that since the SC is built to hold homologs together, then normal disassembly equates to the physical separation of homolog arms. However, the term SC disassembly has been widely utilized to refer to the physical separation of homolog arms and the loss of the SC proteins from specific chromosome subdomains. The latter, however, is not occurring normally when there is constitutive phosphorylation of SYP-2. To clarify this terminology, we now explain it the first time that we describe the defect in our manuscript: \u201cThose nuclei that had already gone through the leptotene/zygotene stage before the temperature shift showed normal synapsis during early and mid pachytene stages, but the central region components of the SC remained localized along the long arms of the bivalents and failed to become restricted to the short arms of the bivalents during late prophase (a defect herein referred to as impaired SC disassembly) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>)\u201d.) We also replaced the term \u201cabrogates\u201d with \u201cimpairs\u201d in the two locations in the text where that term was utilized. It is also important to note that in <i>C. elegans</i> the central region of the SC is comprised of four SYP proteins (SYP-1/2/3/4). These four SYP proteins have been shown before to be interdependent for their localization (Colaiacovo et al., 2003; Smolikov et al., 2007 and Smolikov et al., 2009). Therefore, the localization of SYP-1 reflects the localization pattern of all the SYPs and previous publications from many labs, including ours, have used SYP-1 as a readout to study the SC assembly and disassembly process (Nabeshima et al., 2005; Bhalla et al., 2008; Martinez-perez et al., 2008; Clemon et al., 2013). However, to further clarify this we now also include analysis of SYP-2, SYP-3 and SYP-4 (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) and show that all four SYP proteins fail to be lost from along the long arms. This further indicates that the presence of SYP-1 on the long arm at a stage when it should have normally been lost from this chromosome subdomain is not due to any altered properties of SYP-1 and instead indicates that there is a defect in disassembling all SC central region components from along the long arms of the bivalents."

Thus, if (hypothetically) SYP-2 is only capable of being phosphorylated during late pachytene, an absence of SYP-2 phosphorylation in mpk-1 null mutants could be a consequence of a progression defect, and not because SYP-2 is normally a direct target of MAP kinase activity in vivo.</i>"

Consistent with our conclusion that MAP kinase coordinates crossing over designation with SC disassembly, we found that the SC is able to disassemble in these double mutants, but with different penetrance levels. Specifically, <i>mpk-1(ga111)</i> is able to completely suppress the SC disassembly defect observed in a <i>cosa-1(me13)</i> mutant, whereas <i>ect-2(ax751)</i> and <i>syp-2(S25A)</i> show a 11.5% and 40.9% suppression of the <i>cosa-1(me13)</i> SC disassembly defects, respectively.

We hypothesize that the reason we see a complete suppression in <i>cosa-1(me13) mpk-1(ga111),</i> but a partial suppression in <i>cosa-1(me13);syp-2(S24A)</i> double mutants, is that another SYP protein could be a substrate of MPK-1. However, we did not find any additional MAP Kinase phosphorylation sites in any of the SYP proteins, other than the S25 site in SYP-2. Interestingly though, there are phosphorylation sites for polo-like kinase on SYP-1 and SYP-4, which were verified by mass spectrometry. Polo-like kinase itself has been identified as a target of MPK-1 in <i>C. elegans</i> (Arur et al., 2009). It is possible that MAP kinase prevents the SC from disassembling prematurely through direct phosphorylation of SYP-2 and phosphorylation of SYP-1 and SYP-4 by polo-like kinase. The analysis of all the requested double mutants and interpretation of the observed outcomes have been included in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a> and in the main text (Results section, last paragraph)."

However, in the <i>syp-2</i> phosphomimetic mutant, where we see an SC disassembly defect only in 54% of the animals (as shown in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>), we see a milder reduction in brood size (109 \u00b1 32), accompanied by 14.3% embryonic lethality and 2.1% males, indicating that impaired SC disassembly is resulting in a defect in accurate chromosome segregation. We now include this information in the subsection \u201cPhosphorylation of SYP-2 at S25 prevents SC disassembly\u201d. We also suggest that SC disassembly from the short arm could be regulated either by different kinases or by a different mechanism (as described above in response to point #5 and in the manuscript).
