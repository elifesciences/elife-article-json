In both vertebrates and invertebrates, intrinsic determinants are thought to act in neural progenitors to specify their identity and the identity of their neuronal progeny. However, the extent to which individual factors can contribute to this is poorly understood. We investigate the role of <i>orthodenticle</i> in the specification of an identified neuroblast (neuronal progenitor) lineage in the <i>Drosophila</i> brain. Loss of <i>orthodenticle</i> from this neuroblast affects molecular properties, neuroanatomical features, and functional inputs of progeny neurons, such that an entire central complex lineage transforms into a functional olfactory projection neuron lineage. This ability to change functional macrocircuitry of the brain through changes in gene expression in a single neuroblast reveals a surprising capacity for novel circuit formation in the brain and provides a paradigm for large-scale evolutionary modification of circuitry."

In both vertebrates and invertebrates, intrinsic determinants are thought to act in neural progenitors to specify their identity and the identity of their neuronal progeny. However, the extent to which individual factors can contribute to this is poorly understood. We investigate the role of <i>orthodenticle</i> in the specification of an identified neuroblast (neuronal progenitor) lineage in the <i>Drosophila</i> brain. Loss of <i>orthodenticle</i> from this neuroblast affects molecular properties, neuroanatomical features, and functional inputs of progeny neurons, such that an entire central complex lineage transforms into a functional olfactory projection neuron lineage. This ability to change functional macrocircuitry of the brain through changes in gene expression in a single neuroblast reveals a surprising capacity for novel circuit formation in the brain and provides a paradigm for large-scale evolutionary modification of circuitry."

Studies on the molecular genetics of brain development indicate that neural progenitors emerge from the embryonic neuroectoderm where unique spatial information represented by unique combinations of gene expression specifies unique identities to the progenitors. For example, in <i>Drosophila</i>, the embryonic neuroectoderm becomes spatially regionalized due to the action of embryonic patterning genes, which define the anterior-posterior and dorsal-ventral body axes. Their combined expression creates a Cartesian coordinate-like gene expression system in the neuroectoderm, resulting in unique domains of expression of developmental control genes along the neuroectoderm (<a href=\"#bib37\">Skeath and Thor, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Urbach and Technau, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Technau et al., 2006</a>). Changes in the combinatorial expression pattern of these genes in specific domains can lead to changes in the identities of the neuroblasts that delaminate from the neuroectoderm during embryogenesis (e.g., <a href=\"#bib8\">Deshpande et al., 2001</a>). The process of spatial regionalization of the embryonic neuroectoderm is very similar in vertebrates. Homologous embryonic patterning genes result in unique domains of combinatorial gene expression along the vertebrate neuroectoderm (<a href=\"#bib33\">Reichert and Simeone, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Lichtneckert and Reichert, 2005</a>, <a href=\"#bib21\">2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Reichert, 2009</a>). Thus, in both vertebrates and invertebrates, the cells of the neuroectoderm acquire unique spatial information in the form of a combinatorial code of gene expression, which is conferred by embryonic patterning genes. It is noteworthy that neural progenitors also use temporal information (typically a series of sequentially expressed transcription factors) to generate neuronal diversity within lineages (<a href=\"#bib26\">Pearson and Doe, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Lin and Lee, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Kohwi and Doe, 2013</a>). While spatial cues convert a homogenous pool of progenitors into heterogeneous populations, temporal cues result in the ordered production of different neural subtypes from each progenitor."

This implies that spatially encoded intrinsic factors determine the identity of the progenitor and, as a consequence, the unique circuit features of its neural lineage. According to this, removal or addition of one or more of these genes could lead to a change in neuroblast identity resulting in transformation of the neuronal lineage and the lineal circuitry that derives from it. However, the extent to which individual transcription factors can contribute to this specification of neuroblast identity is not well understood."

The complexity of the vertebrate brain makes it difficult to conduct such an analysis at the resolution of single progenitors and single lineages.

While the ALad1 neuroblast generates olfactory projection interneurons that innervate the antennal lobe, the LALv1 neuroblast generates wide-field interneurons that innervate the central complex. We show that <i>orthodenticle</i> (<i>otd</i>), an embryonic patterning gene involved in specifying the anterior-most regions of the neuroectoderm and embryonic brain (<a href=\"#bib21\">Lichtneckert and Reichert, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Reichert and Bello, 2010</a>), is expressed during development in the LALv1 neuroblast lineage but not in the ALad1 neuroblast lineage. Remarkably, loss of <i>otd</i> from the LALv1 neuroblast results in a complete transformation in the identity of the neurons that derive from this lineage. The <i>otd</i> null LALv1 neurons transform into antennal lobe projection interneurons similar to the ALad1 lineage, and this transformation includes a complete change in the neuroanatomy of the neurons, a change in their molecular properties as well as in their functional connectivity. This remarkably complete respecification of a neuroblast lineage upon the mutation of a single gene in the brain demonstrates that intrinsic determinants acting in the neuroblast during development specify the identity of its neural progeny and the macrocircuitry that these progeny establish. This large-scale modification of functional circuits in the brain by a single transcription factor in a single stem cell is unprecedented and reveals a surprising capacity for novel neural circuit formation in the developing brain, which may provide a paradigm for large-scale evolutionary modification of brain connectivity."

In these experiments, in which we used the <i>OK371-Gal4</i> and <i>Per-Gal4</i> driver lines to label the MARCM clones, we obtained a total of seven wild-type single cell clones and 11 <i>otd</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> single cell clones. Although we have not dated the birth of these clones precisely (matched the time of clone generation), the wild-type single cell clones that we obtained in our experiments were very similar to those described previously (<a href=\"#bib50\">Yu et al., 2009a</a>). Six of these single cell wild-type clones consisted of neurons that innervated both the lateral accessory lobe as well as one of the noduli of the central complex (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>) and one clone only innervated the lateral accessory lobe (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). All of the 11 <i>otd</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> single cell clones we recovered also displayed a similar neuroanatomy. Their cell bodies were located ventral to the antennal lobe, their axons coursed through the loVM and LEp tracts and they all innervated the lateral accessory lobe and one of the noduli of the central complex (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G,H</a>). Thus, loss of <i>otd</i> function from the postmitotic neurons did not result in any gross defects in the neuroanatomy of these neurons. It is however possible, that there are fine-scale changes in the arborisation of these neurons within the lateral accessory lobe and the central complex that we were unable to identify. It is also possible that <i>otd</i> function is required in the GMC for the targeting of the postmitotic neurons (see schematic in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). However, in our experiments, we never obtained two cell GMC clones in order to be able to address this possibility."

If the transformed identity of the <i>otd</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> LALv1 lineage does indeed correspond to that of an antennal lobe lineage, it should also express the antennal lobe specific enhancer Gal4 driver line, <i>GH146.</i> To investigate this, we generated wild-type and <i>otd</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> MARCM clones in the LALv1 lineage and used the <i>GH146-Gal4</i> enhancer line to label the recovered clones.

To investigate this, we first characterized the axon tract of the wild-type LALv1 lineage, which is readily identifiable in the adult brain based on Neuroglian immunolabelling patterns (<a href=\"#bib28\">Pereanu et al., 2010</a>). In wild-type brains, Neuroglian immunolabelling shows the loVM tract (cyan arrow, left hemisphere in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C,D</a>) and the characteristic LEp tract of the LALv1 lineage, which projects around the antennal lobes and towards the central complex (cyan arrowhead, left hemisphere in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C,D</a>). In brains in which one LALv1 neuroblast clone is mutant, the brain hemisphere that contains the <i>otd</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> LALv1 neuroblast clone (identified by the loss of Otd immunolabelling; yellow dotted lines in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B\u2032</a>), still shows the loVM tract (cyan arrow, right hemisphere in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C,D</a>), which is shared by other lineages. However, the LALv1-specific LEp tract, which projects towards the central complex is entirely missing (cyan arrowhead, right hemisphere in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C,D</a>). This shows that loss of <i>otd</i> from the LALv1 neuroblast corresponds to the loss of the LEp tract of the wild-type LALv1 lineage, providing support that loss of <i>otd</i> from the LALv1 neuroblast transforms it into a lineage of different identity."

Acj6 is a POU transcription factor that is known to be expressed in the ALad1 lineage and in a subset of the ALl1-derived projection interneurons of the wild-type brain (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). In addition to these two cell clusters, we observed a third Acj6 positive cell cluster ventral to the antennal lobe of the wild-type brain (cyan arrowhead in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). MARCM clonal labelling using the <i>Per-Gal4</i> enhancer line together with anti-Acj6 and anti-Otd antibodies unambiguously identified this cluster as the LALv1 lineage (cyan arrowhead in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A\u2013D</a>). Importantly, this cell cluster continues to express Acj6 immunoreactivity following mutational inactivation of <i>otd</i> in the LALv1 lineage (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F,G</a>). Thus, Acj6 provides a molecular marker for the identification of the LALv1 lineage independent of Otd expression in wild-type and mutant clones. The analysis of <i>otd</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup> LALv1 MARCM clones identified by Acj6 immunolabelling and co-labelled by <i>GH146-Gal4</i> shows that the fourth <i>GH146-</i>positive neuroblast clone described above does indeed correspond to the mutant LALv1 lineage (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E,H</a>).

We reasoned that if the transformed neurons did made functional connections within the antennal lobe they would be postsynaptic to the olfactory sensory neurons and would be activated upon the activation of the antennal nerve. We therefore electrically stimulated the antennal nerve while simultaneously monitoring calcium activity from the transformed neurons.

Do developing circuits acquire a propensity for exuberant connectivities, or do they try and maintain a homeostasis in their connections and therefore make compensatory changes in the number of synapses with their normal partners? It has been shown in some cases that neuronal activity can mediate such \u2018soft\u2019 properties of synaptic connections (<a href=\"#bib41\">Tripodi et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Singh et al., 2010</a>). It will be interesting to test if this is also the case for the transformed neurons and the olfactory circuit. Finally, do all parts of the brain display such striking developmental plasticity such that they can be remodelled to this extent and incorporate extraneous neurons into existing circuitry?"

The <i>otd</i><sup><i>\u2212/\u2212</i></sup>transformed LALv1 lineage functionally integrates into the antennal lobe circuitry and participates in olfactory information processing. This suggests that a functional rewiring of the olfactory circuitry can occur due to the addition of an entire neuroblast lineage to the normal olfactory circuit. In more general terms, this type of lineage-specific rewiring might fuel the evolutionary modification of neural circuitry in the brain. It provides an elegant and simple solution to the evolution of complex circuitry in that a \u2018microevolutionary\u2019 molecular change (changing the expression of one gene in one cell) can have \u2018macroevolutionary\u2019 consequences on the brain's circuitry (changing an entire macrocircuit or an information processing module). This simple strategy suggests that large-scale changes in the brain's wiring do not need to come about through many minor, sequentially accumulating changes at the cellular level. Instead, large-scale wiring changes can occur in response to remarkably simple changes in gene expression in single cells. In this context, our data may have provided evidence for the mechanistic ease with which circuitry in the brain can evolve."

The authors show convincingly that manipulating otd at the stage of the stem cell (neuroblast) determines the fate of the lineage; loss of otd in a lineage that normally innervates the central complex (LALv1) results in the transformation of its neurons into a lineage that normally develops at a close by position, associated with the antennal lobe). The data are clearly presented and documented. The findings are of great significance for the field. They underline the early global function of transcription factors in fate specification. They also shed light on the interplay between intrinsic (\u201chard wired\u201d) factors and plasticity; for example, otd-mutant axons adopting the antennal projection fate are able to branch and properly innervate the antennal lobe, even though they start out at a different location (the location of the LALv1 lineage)."

These neurons are indeed antennal lobe projection interneurons, however, their neuroanatomy is very different from the <i>otd</i><sup><i>-/-</i></sup> LALv1 lineage. The entry point of the axons of these two lineages into the antennal lobe is diametrically opposite to each other; while the <i>otd</i><sup><i>-/-</i></sup> LALv1 lineage enters the lobe medially, ALv1 (as well as the <i>otd</i><sup><i>-/-</i></sup> ALv1) enters it laterally (see asterisks in <a href=\"#fig13\">Author response image 1A,B</a>). Most strikingly, their axons exit the lobe towards the protocerebrum using different tracts; while the <i>otd</i><sup><i>-/-</i></sup> LALv1 lineage uses the medial antennal lobe tract, the ALv1 (as well as the <i>otd</i><sup><i>-/-</i></sup> ALv1) use the mediolateral antennal lobe tract (see arrow in Author response 1A,B). Both these tracts are visible in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5 A-C</a>.

This is because in the larval brain, the cell bodies of LALv1 and ALad1 lie closely apposed to each other and when the LALv1 lineage is transformed, they also share similar trajectories. However, in a rare clone, the <i>otd</i><sup><i>-/-</i></sup> LALv1 lineage retained a few projections into the loVM tract, allowing us to unambiguously identify it as the LALv1 lineage. In this brain preparation we observed that the <i>otd</i><sup><i>-/-</i></sup> LALv1 lineage sent a majority of its projections via the medial antennal lobe tract (see <a href=\"#fig14\">Author response image 2</a>), confirming that the <i>otd</i><sup><i>-/-</i></sup> LALv1 lineage indeed transforms to an ALad1 neuroblast lineage like fate."
