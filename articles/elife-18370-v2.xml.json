Here we investigate the Notch transcriptional response in germline stem cells using single-molecule fluorescence <i>in situ</i> hybridization coupled with automated, high-throughput quantitation. This approach allows us to distinguish Notch-dependent nascent transcripts in the nucleus from mature mRNAs in the cytoplasm. We find that Notch-dependent active transcription sites occur in a probabilistic fashion and, unexpectedly, do so in a steep gradient across the stem cell pool. Yet these graded nuclear sites create a nearly uniform field of mRNAs that extends beyond the region of transcriptional activation. Therefore, active transcription sites provide a precise view of where the Notch-dependent transcriptional complex is productively engaged. Our findings offer a new window into the Notch transcriptional response and demonstrate the importance of assaying nascent transcripts at active transcription sites as a readout for canonical signaling."

Here we investigate the Notch transcriptional response in germline stem cells using single-molecule fluorescence <i>in situ</i> hybridization coupled with automated, high-throughput quantitation. This approach allows us to distinguish Notch-dependent nascent transcripts in the nucleus from mature mRNAs in the cytoplasm. We find that Notch-dependent active transcription sites occur in a probabilistic fashion and, unexpectedly, do so in a steep gradient across the stem cell pool. Yet these graded nuclear sites create a nearly uniform field of mRNAs that extends beyond the region of transcriptional activation. Therefore, active transcription sites provide a precise view of where the Notch-dependent transcriptional complex is productively engaged. Our findings offer a new window into the Notch transcriptional response and demonstrate the importance of assaying nascent transcripts at active transcription sites as a readout for canonical signaling."

Most canonical cell signaling pathways (e.g. Notch, Wnt, Hedgehog, TGF-\u03b2) regulate transcription and major advances have been made unraveling their molecular mechanisms. Yet virtually no studies of any canonical signaling pathway have tackled the question of how they modulate nuclear transcription (i.e. generation of nascent transcripts at active transcription sites) during animal development. Does signaling orchestrate a synchronous nuclear response? Or does it tune the probability of transcriptional firing and number of nascent transcripts produced? Answers to these questions are fundamental to our molecular understanding of intercellular signaling."

The Notch pathway is strongly conserved across animal phylogeny (e.g. <a href=\"#bib23\">Gazave et al. 2009</a>). Moreover, like other canonical signaling pathways, Notch is central to development and homeostasis, with dysfunction or misregulation causing disease (e.g. cancer, stroke) (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bray, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Roy et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Kopan and Ilagan, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Tien et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">de la Pompa and Epstein, 2012</a>). The molecular mechanism of Notch signaling is essentially the same across metazoans, including nematodes, flies and vertebrates. Briefly, Notch ligands trigger cleavage of the Notch receptor to release its intracellular domain (NICD), which assembles into a nuclear complex to activate transcription (<a href=\"#bib38\">Kopan and Ilagan, 2009</a>). The transcriptional response to Notch signaling has been analyzed in diverse systems (e.g. <a href=\"#bib59\">Shimojo et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Ilagan et al. 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Hoyle and Ish-Horowicz, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Imayoshi et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Kershner et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Jenkins et al., 2015</a>), but no analyses have been done at the resolution of nascent transcripts at active transcription sites in the nucleus. Transcriptional reporters are a common readout of the Notch transcriptional response (<a href=\"#bib25\">Hansson et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Imayoshi et al., 2013</a>), but they are both artificial and indirect. Conventional RNA <i>in situ</i> hybridization to endogenous Notch targets has also been used as a readout of Notch signaling, for example during segmentation of the zebrafish embryo (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hoyle and Ish-Horowicz, 2013</a>), but this method cannot resolve individual chromosomal loci and typically cannot resolve individual cells."

It had been known for some time that Notch, known as GLP-1/Notch in this system, is crucial for the\u00a0regulation of the germline stem cell pool and establishing polarity in the germline (<a href=\"#bib2\">Austin and Kimble, 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Kimble and Crittenden, 2007</a>). The single-celled mesenchymal niche, called the distal tip cell (DTC), uses Notch signaling to maintain a pool of germline stem cells (GSCs) at the distal end of the \u2018progenitor zone\u2019 in the distal gonad (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib36\">Kimble and White 1981</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Crittenden et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Cinquin et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Byrd et al., 2014</a>). Previous studies suggested that Notch signaling might function throughout the GSC pool or even beyond. Transcripts from key Notch target genes are expressed in the distal gonad (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kershner et al., 2014</a>), but this previous study did not define expression at the level of single cells, much less at single chromosomal loci. The site of Notch signaling is ambiguous, because of the elaborate architecture of the signaling cell \u2014 the DTC cell body caps the distal gonad and extends ultra-thin processes intercalating throughout the GSC pool as well as long external processes along the entire progenitor zone and sometimes beyond (<a href=\"#bib20\">Fitzgerald and Greenwald, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Hall et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Crittenden et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Byrd et al., 2014</a>). Which parts of the DTC are actually signaling and how sustained is the transcriptional response once the receptor is cleaved? Answers to these questions are critical to understanding how GLP-1/Notch regulates this stem cell pool and will be of heuristic value for other systems."

Visualization of nascent transcripts has been technically possible for some time, due to the advent of single-molecule fluorescence <i>in situ</i> hybridization (smFISH) (<a href=\"#bib54\">Raj et al., 2008</a>), but the\u00a0application of this method to intercellular signaling has faced numerous challenges. Signaling and receiving cells within an intact organism are often poorly defined; signaling is often transient or subject to changing regulatory circuitry; and signaling in tissue culture cells typically relies on overexpressed components and reporter readouts, either of which has potential to alter or mask the response. Several features of Notch signaling in the <i>C. elegans</i> gonad circumvent these issues. Not only is the signaling cell defined, but signaling is continuous rather than transient. Thus, the DTC expresses DSL ligands in both larvae and adults (<a href=\"#bib26\">Henderson et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Nadarajan et al., 2009</a>); mitotically dividing germ cells express the GLP-1/Notch receptor at all stages (<a href=\"#bib15\">Crittenden et al., 1994</a>), and GLP-1/Notch signaling controls GSC maintenance throughout life of the animal (<a href=\"#bib2\">Austin and Kimble, 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Morgan et al., 2010</a>). In addition, two direct Notch target genes are available for assays: <i>sygl-1</i> (<i><span class=\"underline\">sy</span>nthetic <span class=\"underline\">Gl</span>p</i>) and <i>lst-1\u00a0</i>(<i><span class=\"underline\">l</span>ateral <span class=\"underline\">s</span>ignaling <span class=\"underline\">t</span>arget)</i> encode key stem cell regulators, whose removal mimics the loss of Notch signaling (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kershner et al., 2014</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Finally, GLP-1/Notch appears to regulate a pool of cells, enabling quantitation of many receiving cells at one time. This feature would be particularly useful if Notch affects probability of transcriptional firing, as might be expected. Together, these features circumvent common challenges and establish the <i>C. elegans</i> gonad as a superb model for visualizing Notch-dependent transcriptional activation in the nucleus."

Therefore, this study reveals the response to Notch signaling in its natural context \u2013 no reporters and no manipulated signaling components. We find that Notch regulates both the probability of transcriptional firing at individual chromosomal loci and the number of nascent transcripts produced at active transcription sites. Surprisingly, we discover a gradient in the probability of generating a Notch-regulated ATS across the GSC pool. Yet the steeply graded ATS create a more uniform field of mRNAs that extends beyond the gradient. Therefore, nuclear ATS provide a direct measure for effective engagement of the Notch-dependent transcription complex at its target genes. Finally, we analyze the transcriptional response to two well-characterized Notch mutants. A weaker than wild-type NICD lowers the extent of the Notch-dependent transcriptional response, including the\u00a0magnitude of transcription probability, number of transcripts generated per active transcription site and range of the spatial gradient, a finding with implications for both patterning and disease. By contrast, an unregulated Notch receptor drives an ectopic transcriptional response at an essentially wild-type level of intensity."

Finally, we confirmed Notch dependence: <i>sygl-1</i> smFISH signals were not found in <i>glp-1</i> null mutants (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A,B</a>) whereas transcription from a non-target gene, <i>let-858,</i> was unaffected (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2C,D</a>); moreover, <i>sygl-1</i> smFISH signals expanded in a <i>glp-1</i> gain-of-function mutant (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2E,F</a>). We conclude that <i>sygl-1</i> smFISH provides a high-resolution view of Notch-activated nascent transcripts in the nucleus and Notch-dependent mature mRNAs in the cytoplasm."

                                "text": "We developed a custom MATLAB code (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Source code 1</a>) to score the presence, intensity and spatial distribution of smFISH signals in confocal images of adult gonads (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Briefly, the code uses DIC to define the tissue edge and DAPI to generate a 3-D reconstruction of nuclei (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Positions were recorded in 3-D, but are reported here as sites along the gonadal distal-proximal axis in microns (\u00b5m) from the distal end; microns were then translated into the more conventional metric of 'germ cell diameters (gcd)' from the distal end (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). The code excludes the DTC nucleus (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) and includes all germ cell nuclei within the field of view, corresponding to roughly 60 \u00b5m or 13 gcd from the distal end (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). This field of view includes all <i>sygl-1</i> ATS and mRNAs in the distal gonad. Following tissue and nuclear reconstruction, we used the code to quantify smFISH signals as a function of both subcellular location (cytoplasm versus nucleus) and position in the gonad (\u00b5m/gcd from distal end). As expected, spots seen with the exon probe fell into two groups: one with bright spots co-localizing with both DAPI and the intron-probe-detected ATS, and the other with dimmer spots found outside DAPI and failing to co-localize with intron-probe-detected ATS. Signal intensities of individual spots were normalized to background in each gonad, and then pooled from 78 gonads after normalization between gonads (see Materials and methods). The\u00a0intensities of the <i>sygl-1</i> cytoplasmic mRNAs clustered tightly (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>), a nearly uniform signal that likely corresponds to a single mRNA (<a href=\"#bib54\">Raj et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Raj and Tyagi, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Lee et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Lee et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Padovan-Merhar et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Lee et al., 2016</a>). By contrast, <i>sygl-1</i> ATS intensities spanned a broad range using either the exon (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>) or intron (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>) probe. Comparison of nuclear and cytoplasmic signal intensities, obtained with the same probe set (exon), revealed a mean ATS intensity roughly 17-fold greater on average than the mean single mRNA intensity (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,C</a>). This 17-fold value suggests that roughly 17 nascent transcripts are generated at individual <i>sygl-1</i> ATS, on average. This estimate is rough because ATS intensities combine signals from short beginning transcripts and longer elongating transcripts. The progenitor zone includes\u00a0~4% germ cells in G1,\u00a0~71% in S-phase,\u00a0~22% in G2 and\u00a0~3% in M-phase (<a href=\"#bib57\">Seidel and Kimble, 2015</a>). Indeed, the maximum number of ATS per nucleus was four (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>), as expected for the maximum number of <i>sygl-1</i> chromosomal loci in this population of actively dividing cells."

We also compared ATS intensities within single nuclei in all pairwise combinations, relying on those nuclei with two or more ATS.

As described above, ATS signal intensity provides a measure of the number of nascent transcripts, but only an estimate. Although ATS signal intensities varied considerably (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>), their mean was relatively constant across the distal third of the progenitor zone (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>, blue line). Therefore, unlike the steep gradient in probability of <i>sygl-1</i> transcriptional activation, the mean number of transcripts per ATS was not graded. To gauge the full <i>sygl-1</i> output per nucleus, we summed ATS signal intensities in each nucleus and plotted those sums as a function of position (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>). The mean of these summed intensities was graded (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>, blue line), consistent with the gradient in the\u00a0number of <i>sygl-1</i> ATS per nucleus (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Therefore, number of nascent transcripts made in response to GLP-1/Notch signaling is graded at a cellular level, but that gradient is based on the graded firing probability at individual loci. We conclude that GLP-1/Notch signaling activates transcription in a graded fashion in the distal <i>C. elegans</i> gonad, and that this gradient reflects the probability of transcriptional activation, both in single cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>) and individual chromosomal loci (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B\u2013D</a>)."

Our primary question was whether <i>sygl-1</i> cytoplasmic mRNAs were distributed in the same pattern as <i>sygl-1</i> ATS. To assess the number of <i>sygl-1</i> cytoplasmic mRNAs on a per cell basis, we estimated cell boundaries computationally in 3 dimensions (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>) and recorded mRNAs within those boundaries.

One straightforward explanation, consistent with transcriptional pulses (e.g. <a href=\"#bib41\">Larson et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Raj and van Oudenaarden, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Chubb and Liverpool, 2010</a>), is that dynamic <i>sygl-1</i> ATS produce <i>sygl-1</i> mRNAs that persist in the cytoplasm. Alternatively, mRNAs might move between germ cells given their interconnections via a cytoplasmic core or \u2018rachis\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib27\">Hirsh et al., 1976</a>). We were not able to assay the movement of individual mRNAs, because live imaging of RNAs has not yet been achieved in this system. Instead, we asked if neighboring cells had similar mRNA densities and found cells with many <i>sygl-1</i> mRNAs residing immediately adjacent to a neighbor with few or no <i>sygl-1</i> mRNAs (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). We also assessed mRNA densities in ATS-positive cells, ATS-negative cells and the rachis. The <i>sygl-1</i> mRNAs in the rachis are evidence for movement from cells to rachis (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>). However, ATS-positive cells had more <i>sygl-1</i> mRNAs than did ATS-negative cells, and both had more than the rachis in the distal-most gonad (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2D</a>). This analysis does not exclude a role for mRNA movement, but suggests that free diffusion of mRNAs between cells through the rachis is unlikely. We favor instead the idea that <i>sygl-1</i> transcriptional pulses are of shorter duration than mRNA half-life and that this \u2018bursty\u2019 transcriptional activation generates a nearly uniform field of mRNAs (see Discussion)."

DTC-germ cell contacts occurred in a gradient that extended far beyond the region with <i>sygl-1</i> ATS (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3J,L</a>). Virtually all germ cells were in DTC contact at the distal end,\u00a0~60% of germ cells remained in contact at 7 gcd from the distal end, and\u00a0~40% were still in contact more proximally at 13 gcd from the distal end (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). Yet, as in wild-type animals lacking GFP, <i>sygl-1</i> ATS were restricted to a region of 1\u201330 \u00b5m (~1\u20137 gcd) from the distal end and the percentage of cells with <i>sygl-1</i> ATS was graded (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3K</a>). Therefore, DTC contacts were much more extensive than the Notch-dependent ATS. Most importantly, the DTC was in contact with nearly all ATS-positive cells as well as with many ATS-negative cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3L</a>).

The NICD is a key component of the Notch-dependent transcription complex (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Here we focus on a temperature-sensitive Notch receptor mutant, <i>glp-1(q224)</i>, that behaves like a null at the\u00a0restrictive temperature (25\u00b0C) but is at least partially functional at the\u00a0permissive temperature (15\u00b0C) (<a href=\"#bib2\">Austin and Kimble, 1987</a>). Molecularly, GLP-1(q224) harbors a missense mutation that renders its NICD temperature sensitive for assembly into the Notch-dependent transcription complex (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib37\">Kodoyianni et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Petcherski and Kimble, 2000</a>). The wild-type <i>sygl-1</i> transcriptional response was indistinguishable in animals raised at 15, 20 and 25\u00b0C (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). By contrast, <i>glp-1(q224)</i> mutants raised at 15\u00b0C and shifted to 25\u00b0C as adults lost most <i>sygl-1</i> ATS within 15 min after the shift (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,C</a>); <i>sygl-1</i> mRNAs were lost more slowly but most were gone within three hours (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,D</a>). From this data, we estimate the half-life of GLP-1(q224)-dependent ATS to be\u00a0&lt;15 min and <i>sygl-1</i> mRNAs to be\u00a0~1 hr. We conclude that GLP-1(q224) is incapable of activating transcription in nematode germ cells at the\u00a0restrictive temperature."

We considered two explanations of that graded pattern. One idea was that Notch activity might be graded (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>, left). For example, the abundance or activity of Notch ligand might be graded with most in the DTC cell body and less in DTC processes, but we emphasize that activity of any pathway component might serve the same end. A second idea is that signaling is localized to the distal-most end but that the stability of the Notch transcription complex decays as germ cells move proximally within the niche (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>, right). One way to distinguish between these two models is to measure abundance, half-life and activity of each pathway component according to position. However, this approach is challenging, in part because many Notch ligands exist in this system and in part because activity assays are not available for most of the components. Instead, we tested predictions of the two models, which are vastly different (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). The first model predicts establishment of the graded pattern at the rate of ATS generation, and the second predicts its establishment at the rate of germ cell movement within the niche. What are those rates? Neither is known with any precision, but rough estimates can be made. In diverse eukaryotic cells, transcriptional elongation occurs at a rate of roughly 1\u20135 kb/min (e.g. <a href=\"#bib3\">Ben-Ari et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Danko et al., 2013</a>). If the <i>sygl-1</i> elongation rate falls in a similar range, <i>sygl-1</i> ATS should be generated relatively quickly, certainly within an hour. By contrast, germ cell movement along the distal-proximal axis is relatively slow, on the order of one cell diameter per hour (<a href=\"#bib14\">Crittenden et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Cinquin et al., 2015</a>) or several hours to traverse the region with graded <i>sygl-1</i> ATS."

We find that Notch does not orchestrate a synchronous nuclear response but instead tunes the probability of transcriptional firing and number of nascent transcripts produced. Consistent with that conclusion, Notch activates transcription independently at individual chromosomal loci. We also overturn expectations that the pattern of nuclear active transcription sites (ATS) is essentially the same as the pattern of cytoplasmic mRNAs. ATS are generated in a steep probability gradient across the stem cell pool, but mRNAs are more uniform in the same region and extend beyond it. We also find that NICD strength determines both probability of transcriptional firing and number of nascent transcripts per ATS, providing a new metric for Notch strength.

For both genes, Notch activates transcription most commonly at only one chromosomal locus, though in some nuclei, both loci are activated and in others, three or even all four loci can fire in this proliferating population. When both <i>sygl-1</i> and <i>lst-1</i> are assayed in the same cells, these genes too are activated independently: some nuclei activate only <i>sygl-1</i>, others activate only <i>lst-1</i>, and some activate both or neither. The possession of any one Notch-activated ATS marks that cell as having received the Notch signal, while absence of other Notch-activated ATS in the same cell confirms the probabilistic nature of firing. Importantly, the existence of ATS-negative nuclei is unlikely a problem with detection, because cytoplasmic mRNAs, which are significantly dimmer than ATS, are seen in the same cells."

Thus, cAMP modulates transcriptional burst frequency in <i>Dictyostelium</i> (<a href=\"#bib13\">Corrigan and Chubb, 2014</a>), and MAPK modulates transcriptional burst frequency in tissue culture cells (<a href=\"#bib58\">Senecal et al., 2014</a>). We suggest that the sporadic appearance of Notch-responsive ATS is best explained by transcriptional \u2018bursts\u2019 or \u2018pulses\u2019 separated by periods of quiescence (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). We do not yet know if Notch regulates frequency or duration of these pulses, or if timing of Notch-dependent transcriptional activation follows a set rhythm once initiated. Answers to these questions must await live imaging of nascent RNAs. Regardless, our results show that Notch regulates the probability of transcription firing at endogenous genes in a wild-type intact tissue, which provides a critical foundation for future investigations with live imaging, which is expected to have lower resolution and typically relies on manipulated reporters."

The receptors tested differ at a single amino acid in the GLP-1/Notch intracellular domain (NICD), which is integral to the Notch transcription complex (<a href=\"#bib39\">Kovall and Hendrickson, 2004</a>). In yeast and in vitro, the mutant NICD is incapable of assembly into the Notch transcription complex at a higher temperature and less capable of assembly than the wild-type NICD at a lower temperature (<a href=\"#bib51\">Petcherski and Kimble, 2000</a>). Here we show in nematode germ cells that this same mutant NICD is incapable of Notch-activated transcription at the\u00a0restrictive temperature and weaker than the wild-type NICD at the\u00a0permissive temperature. The wild-type and mutant NICDs each had a characteristic probability of transcriptional firing and produced a characteristic number of nascent transcripts, with the mutant at the\u00a0permissive temperature being about two-fold less effective than wild-type. The simplest interpretation is that the mutant NICD is less capable than wild-type of forming or maintaining the Notch transcription complex in germ cells. The molecular consequence of the mutant\u2019s two-fold lower transcriptional response is the\u00a0generation of a shorter than normal ATS gradient (this work), and its biological consequence is a reduced progenitor zone (<a href=\"#bib12\">Cinquin et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Fox and Schedl, 2015</a>). The discovery that NICD strength modulates both probability and intensity of the Notch transcriptional response underscores the importance of the NICD for fine-tuning the Notch response, with implications for pattern formation and disease. This finding also highlights the power of a high-resolution ATS assay for assessing molecular consequences of any condition (e.g. defects in any component in the pathway as well as physiological or environmental factors) that affect Notch transcriptional activation."

Yet the spatial extent of GLP-1/Notch influence was poorly understood prior to this work. We now learn that GLP-1/Notch activates transcription over a defined region (7 germ cell diameters from the distal end) and that its nuclear response is steeply graded over that region. Importantly, GLP-1/Notch forms a gradient of ATS probability rather than ATS size, and to our knowledge, no gradient of this type has been seen before. We imagine that Notch generates this ATS probability gradient by tuning either the frequency or duration of transcriptional pulses (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>), possibilities that can be distinguished once live imaging of nascent transcripts has been established."

However, after abolishing the Notch nuclear response, recovery of the gradient was too fast to support such a mechanism (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). We favor instead a mechanism that establishes the graded activity of the Notch transcription complex. Possibilities include graded changes in ligand abundance or activity, graded changes in NICD abundance or activity or graded changes in chromatin modifications, any of which could play a role in forming the ATS probability gradient. Regardless, we suggest that graded loss of active transcription sites at loci encoding key stem cell regulators is likely the molecular basis of the long sought 'initial trigger' for stem cells to begin their transition towards a differentiated state and, as such, this gradient is likely to be critical for establishing size of the stem cell pool."

Yet the distributions of Notch-dependent ATS and mRNAs are not the same. At any given position, more germ cells had <i>sygl-1</i> and <i>lst-1</i> mRNAs than had <i>sygl-1</i> and <i>lst-1</i> ATS, and mRNAs extended more proximally than ATS (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>).

We do not know yet whether Notch-dependent ATS are more accurate than presence of nuclear NICD, another marker of active Notch signaling (<a href=\"#bib18\">Del Monte et al., 2007</a>).

We suspect that all canonical signaling pathways will follow guidelines similar to those found here for Notch. Key questions for the future include how individual components of canonical signaling pathways affect the probability and intensity of active transcription sites, and ultimately how environment, pathogenesis and aging impact their control.

The images acquired in this study were packaged in LIF format and were read in MATLAB with their metadata (<i>e.g.</i>pixel size, z-step size and total number of z slices). The X, Y and Z coordinates and signal intensity of gonadal boundaries, nuclei, mRNAs, and ATS (nuclear spots) were recorded as shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>.

The gonad boundary was detected using DIC from the central 8 Z-planes. The MATLAB code reoriented the gonads with DTC to the left for further analyses. The gonads were reconstructed in MATLAB as rounded and often not straight cylinders with radii changing along the distal-proximal axis. The gonadal boundaries were used for removing non-specific fluorescent signal located outside the gonad. Next, the nuclei were detected using DAPI signal. In each Z-plane, the function \u2018imfindcircles\u2019 was used to draw concentric nuclear circles to define the nuclear boundary and the threshold for DAPI signal (background level) was determined by 150% of output values of the function \u2018greythresh\u2019 in MATLAB. DAPI signal in each Z-plane was normalized to the mean background intensity within that Z-plane, in a location without nuclei.

However, the claim of a novel linkage between cell signaling and stochastic transcription was felt not to be fully justified. The crux of your argument was interpreted as: 1) Not all cells are in the same state with respect to transcription, and therefore this means there is a stochastic process at work 2) Because there is nevertheless a clear impact of Notch-GLP-1 signaling on the distribution of transcription, \"modulated stochasticity\" is a key mechanism of signal transduction. However, mere non-homogeneity of transcription cannot on its own prove that stochastic forces are at work. When nascent transcripts are short-lived, and produced sparsely and asynchronously, many cells will lack them, yet the underlying process could actually be highly regular. In addition, there is now considerable existing evidence for the generality of stochasticity so that it is not clear that your findings represent an entirely novel insight."

Lee et al. find that in a number of cells, within in the 1-5 cell diameters that shows evidence of GLP-1/Notch dependence, lack nascent intron containing <i>sygl-1</i>, which is interpreted as stochastic transcription. Nascent intron containing RNA from the <i>let-858</i> gene, which is not known to be spatially regulated, showed distal-to-proximal spatially unrestricted expression, which also can be interpreted as stochastic, as a number of nuclei lacked signal. The presence or absence of nascent <i>sygl-1</i> RNA was found to be independent of cell cycle stage. The spatial distribution of nascent and cytoplasmic <i>sygl-1</i> RNA is concordant but reduced in cell diameters, when analysis was performed in a mutant <i>glp-1</i> background that has partially reduced activity. Finally, using a temperature shift regimen, Lee et al. showed that the abundance of nascent and cytoplasmic <i>sygl-1</i> smFISH foci was a function of GLP-1/Notch activity, implying that as germ cells move farther away from the distal end, the GLP-1/Notch transcriptional output decreases."

A gene that shows specific regulation of stochastic expression would be found off the diagonal of the plot of log of variance of gene expression versus log mean of gene expression; <i>sygl-1</i> should show such an off-diagonal location based on the assertion of the authors. This reviewer appreciates that while an analysis to generate a plot of log variance of gene expression versus log mean gene expression is straightforward with genome wide approaches like RNA-seq, it would be very labor intensive to do the analysis cytologically, one gene at a time, as would be necessary for the system under study. Nevertheless, the information present in this manuscript is not sufficient to demonstrate that regulation of GLP-1/Notch targets is specifically through modulation of stochasticity."

Another simple explanation (and not mutually exclusive with the authors') might be that DSL ligand proteins are also spatially graded along the processes of the DTC.

Further, in eukaryotic cells a simple Poisson model (in which stochasticity is characterized by a constant probability of transcription over time) often fails to capture the dynamics of new transcription. Instead, a model of quiescence alternating with bursts of relatively frequent transcriptional initiation fits the data much better. Nevertheless, in a population of cells (or as a single cell is followed longitudinally over long periods of time) more predictable, uniform behaviors emerge.

One could even imagine a stripe of coordinated ATS-bearing cells N nuclei from the DTC, at least if the tissue were fixed at just the right time. After hundreds of such fixations we never see anything remotely like that. So, we can safely conclude that transcription of target gene copies is not coordinated in time. But, as I noted before, lack of coordination doesn't necessarily equate with randomness. It could be that each allele of a target gene in a field of cells experiencing the same level of Notch signal is following the exact same timetable for transcription, but because they are not coordinated to start with, heterogeneity is maintained. The simplest alternative is that the timetable itself is variable from allele to allele, but within some range given the amount of signaling. That is, there is a distribution of transcription cycle durations for any given level of Notch signaling. It's important to note that these alternatives exist even with a constant level of Notch signal. Were Notch signal strength to be increased, then in the first scenario the length of a uniform timetable is shortened, while in the latter there is a leftward shift in the distribution of timetable lengths, either of which would give predictably higher transcription population-wide."

However, the claim of a novel linkage between cell signaling and stochastic transcription was felt not to be fully justified. The crux of your argument was interpreted as: 1) Not all cells are in the same state with respect to transcription, and therefore this means there is a stochastic process at work 2) Because there is nevertheless a clear impact of Notch-GLP-1 signaling on the distribution of transcription, \"modulated stochasticity\" is a key mechanism of signal transduction. However, mere non-homogeneity of transcription cannot on its own prove that stochastic forces are at work. When nascent transcripts are short-lived, and produced sparsely and asynchronously, many cells will lack them, yet the underlying process could actually be highly regular. In addition, there is now considerable existing evidence for the generality of stochasticity so that it is not clear that your findings represent an entirely novel insight.</i> "

The presence or absence of nascent sygl-1 RNA was found to be independent of cell cycle stage. The spatial distribution of nascent and cytoplasmic sygl-1 RNA is concordant but reduced in cell diameters, when analysis was performed in a mutant glp-1 background that has partially reduced activity.

Another simple explanation (and not mutually exclusive with the authors') might be that DSL ligand proteins are also spatially graded along the processes of the DTC.

The revised manuscript now includes the lengths of the various cell cycle phases to address this misconception. As for the DAPI signal variability, the difference between low and high DAPI intensity value is ~2.6-fold after we remove outliers (data points more than 1.5 interquartile range); this number is closer to what one might expect. Possible sources of error that might generate outliers include variation in DAPI staining from gonad to gonad and capture of nuclear images every 0.3 \u00b5m on the z-axis. Moreover, we used nuclear size as another metric to support the DAPI measurement. All in all, our data strongly support our conclusion that activation of <i>sygl-1</i> ATS does not correlate with any phase of the cell cycle.

After hundreds of such fixations we never see anything remotely like that. So, we can safely conclude that transcription of target gene copies is not coordinated in time. But, as I noted before, lack of coordination doesn't necessarily equate with randomness. It could be that each allele of a target gene in a field of cells experiencing the same level of Notch signal is following the exact same timetable for transcription, but because they are not coordinated to start with, heterogeneity is maintained. The simplest alternative is that the timetable itself is variable from allele to allele, but within some range given the amount of signaling. That is, there is a distribution of transcription cycle durations for any given level of Notch signaling. It's important to note that these alternatives exist even with a constant level of Notch signal. Were Notch signal strength to be increased, then in the first scenario the length of a uniform timetable is shortened, while in the latter there is a leftward shift in the distribution of timetable lengths, either of which would give predictably higher transcription population-wide.</i> "
