Progress in understanding K<sub>Na</sub> channels has been hampered by the absence of specific tools and methods for rigorous K<sub>Na</sub> identification in native cells. Here, we report the genetic disruption of both <i>Kcnt1</i> and <i>Kcnt2</i>, confirm the loss of Slo2.2 and Slo2.1 protein, respectively, in KO animals, and define tissues enriched in Slo2 expression. Noting the prevalence of Slo2.2 in dorsal root ganglion, we find that KO of Slo2.2, but not Slo2.1, results in enhanced itch and pain responses. In dissociated small diameter DRG neurons, KO of Slo2.2, but not Slo2.1, abolishes K<sub>Na</sub> current. Utilizing isolectin B4+ neurons, the absence of K<sub>Na</sub> current results in an increase in action potential (AP) firing and a decrease in AP threshold. Activation of K<sub>Na</sub> acts as a brake to initiation of the first depolarization-elicited AP with no discernible effect on afterhyperpolarizations."

Progress in understanding K<sub>Na</sub> channels has been hampered by the absence of specific tools and methods for rigorous K<sub>Na</sub> identification in native cells. Here, we report the genetic disruption of both <i>Kcnt1</i> and <i>Kcnt2</i>, confirm the loss of Slo2.2 and Slo2.1 protein, respectively, in KO animals, and define tissues enriched in Slo2 expression. Noting the prevalence of Slo2.2 in dorsal root ganglion, we find that KO of Slo2.2, but not Slo2.1, results in enhanced itch and pain responses. In dissociated small diameter DRG neurons, KO of Slo2.2, but not Slo2.1, abolishes K<sub>Na</sub> current. Utilizing isolectin B4+ neurons, the absence of K<sub>Na</sub> current results in an increase in action potential (AP) firing and a decrease in AP threshold. Activation of K<sub>Na</sub> acts as a brake to initiation of the first depolarization-elicited AP with no discernible effect on afterhyperpolarizations."

The availability of these mice that lack Slo2 subunits provides an important new tool for evaluating the role of sodium-activated channels in other neuronal systems."

                        "text": "Potassium channels regulated by cytosolic Na<sup>+</sup> (K<sub>Na</sub>) are encoded by two homologous mammalian genes, <i>Kcnt1</i> (encoding the Slo2.2 or Slack channel) (<a href=\"#bib60\">Yuan et al., 2003</a>) and <i>Kcnt2</i> (encoding the Slo2.1 or Slick channel) (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bhattacharjee et al., 2003</a>). Recent work has revealed a critical role of K<sub>Na</sub> channels in neuronal function, through demonstration that several mutations in <i>Kcnt1</i> are associated with intellectual disability and childhood epilepsy (<a href=\"#bib2\">Barcia et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Heron et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Martin et al., 2014</a>). Yet, despite apparently wide-spread expression both in neurons (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bhattacharjee et al., 2002</a>, <a href=\"#bib7\">2005</a>) and other cells (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kameyama et al., 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Niu and Meech, 2000</a>), the physiological roles of K<sub>Na</sub> currents during normal patterns of neuronal activity remain poorly understood in part because of the absence of suitably selective pharmacological tools and also the complexities than can arise from manipulations of Na<sup>+</sup>. Because of potential coupling of K<sub>Na</sub> activation to Na<sup>+</sup> influx through voltage-dependent Na<sup>+</sup> (Nav) channels, K<sub>Na</sub> currents have been proposed to influence repetitive firing (<a href=\"#bib57\">Yang et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Gribkoff and Kaczmarek, 2009</a>) and postexcitatory afterhyperpolarizations (<a href=\"#bib19\">Franceschetti et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Gao et al., 2008</a>). Recently, it has been suggested that K<sub>Na</sub> currents may be selectively activated by Na<sup>+</sup> influx through Nav channel openings that persist at steady state following inactivation (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hage and Salkoff, 2012</a>). To further probe the role of K<sub>Na</sub> currents, we have genetically disrupted <i>Kcnt1</i> and <i>Kcnt2</i> genes to generate mouse strains in which Slo2.1, Slo2.2, or both subunits together (Slo2 dKO) have been deleted. Because previous work has suggested an important role of Slo2 channels in sensory neurons (<a href=\"#bib20\">Gao et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Nuwer et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Biton et al., 2012</a>), we examined the consequences of K<sub>Na</sub> KO on sensory function and dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neuron excitability. The results reveal a role of Slo2.2 channels in acute itch sensation. Pruritic stimuli trigger an immediate increase in itch response in Slo2.2 KO mice, with later time points indistinguishable from WT animals. Furthermore, KO of Slo2.2, but not Slo2.1, removes a K<sub>Na</sub> current from all small-diameter DRG neurons examined. To examine effects of Slo2 KO on DRG excitability, we focused on small diameter neurons, immunoreactive for isolectin \u03924 (IB4+), which are known to be enriched in neurons responsive to itch and pain stimuli (<a href=\"#bib31\">Lallemend and Ernfors, 2012</a>). Slo2 KO increases firing frequency at any level of current injection, while decreasing both rheobase and action potential (AP) threshold. Contrary to the view that K<sub>Na</sub> current functions primarily during AP repolarization and afterhyperpolarization (<a href=\"#bib47\">Schwindt et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Franceschetti et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Wallen et al., 2007</a>), we propose that in DRG neurons activation of K<sub>Na</sub> current precedes AP initiation thereby acting as a brake to AP firing. During completion of this work, another paper describing a Slo2.2 KO mouse (<a href=\"#bib34\">Lu et al., 2015</a>) importantly identified a potential role of Slo2.2 in DRG in a neuropathic pain model. Here we reveal a role of Slo2.2 in acute sensory responses and provide a new explanation for how cell firing is altered by Slo2.2 channels."

Successful incorporation of the mutant allele into mice was confirmed by PCR genotyping of genomic DNA extracted from mouse tails (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,F</a>). The absence of specific native Slo2 protein was confirmed by western blots of total brain membrane proteins (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>; See \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 for discussion of Slo2 epitopes identified by antibodies). Enrichment of brain Slo2 protein via sequential co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) and western blot further validated the successful KO of Slo2 proteins and also established that Slo2.1 and Slo2.2 coassemble in WT brain (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B\u2013E</a>), as indicated in earlier work (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chen et al., 2009</a>). As a guide to tissues of interest for future study, quantitative RT-PCR was employed on various tissues to define the relative abundance of message for <i>Kcnt1</i> and <i>Kcnt2</i> message (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>). mRNAs encoding either Slo2.1 and Slo2.2 are broadly present in the central nervous system, with message for Slo2.1 notably more abundant in heart and aorta and message for Slo2.2 relatively enriched in other tissues including DRG and cerebellum. The selective expression of transcript for Slo2.1 in rat heart has been previously reported (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bhattacharjee et al., 2003</a>). Based on the RT-PCR results, we examined DRG, spinal cord, cortex, cerebellum and heart for the presence of Slo2.1 and Slo2.2 subunits using sequential IP and western blot (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G\u2013J</a>). Slo2.1 protein was detected in DRG, spinal cord, cortex and heart, but only a very weak band was seen from cerebellum (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>). Slo2.2 was observed in DRG, spinal cord, cortex, and cerebellum, but not detectable in heart (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2J</a>). Co-IP between Slo2.1 and Slo2.2 was observed in those tissues for which both subunits were detectable: DRG, spinal cord, and cortex (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H,I</a>). Because K<sub>Na</sub> currents have been described in sensory neurons (<a href=\"#bib20\">Gao et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Tamsett et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Nuwer et al., 2010</a>), we chose DRG as a convenient system for investigation of potential physiological roles."

A cheek injection assay has been proposed to distinguish itch from pain (<a href=\"#bib48\">Shimada and LaMotte, 2008</a>). In the cheek, injection of HA elicits hindlimb scratching, while capsaicin injection elicits forepaw wiping (<a href=\"#bib48\">Shimada and LaMotte, 2008</a>), suggesting that they are being perceived differently. We wondered whether a pruritic stimulus injected into the cheek of a Slo2 dKO mouse might elicit a capsaicin-like forepaw wiping response. In our hands, cheek injection of CQ in WT animals was associated with two types of behaviors, hindlimb scratching of the injected site, but also some forepaw wiping presumably reflecting grooming (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). In the dKO animals, forepaw wiping was no different than in WT (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>), but the hindlimb scratching was markedly increased only during the first 5 min (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Whatever the basis of the enhanced response to cheek injection of CQ in Slo2 dKO mice, the response is characteristic of pruritic stimuli and not of capsaicin."

We have not had reliable success with subtractive methods involving Na<sup>+</sup> current inhibition or Na<sup>+</sup> replacement. To test for the presence of K<sub>Na</sub> current in small diameter DRG neurons, we used a method previously applied to rat DRG neurons (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bischoff et al., 1998</a>): a K<sup>+</sup> background current arising from defined pipette Na<sup>+</sup> is measured using hyperpolarizing voltage-steps during the first 5 min following formation of the whole-cell recording configuration. With 0 mM pipette Na<sup>+</sup>, little background current is observed with voltage-steps from \u221280 to \u2212120 mV (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,C</a>). With 70 mM pipette Na<sup>+</sup>, net current elicited by the same voltage-step gradually increases over 3 min reaching a plateau near 1 nA (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,C</a>). At longer times following whole-cell access, current activated by 70 mM pipette Na<sup>+</sup> gradually diminishes (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) despite no change in voltage-dependent Na<sup>+</sup> current. As in rat DRG neurons (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bischoff et al., 1998</a>), the K<sub>Na</sub> current is blocked by extracellular 20 mM Cs<sup>+</sup>, with stronger inhibition at \u2212120 mV than \u221280 mV reflecting the voltage-dependence of Cs<sup>+</sup> inhibition (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). The average amplitude of K<sub>Na</sub> current was similar for WT and Slo2.1 KO DRG neurons (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B,C</a>), while there was no K<sub>Na</sub> current in Slo2.2 KO or Slo2 dKO neurons (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B,C</a>). Despite considerable variability in total K<sub>Na</sub> current among neurons from either WT or Slo2.1 KO animals (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>), the total current always exceeds that observed in WT cells with 0 Na<sup>+</sup>, or in Slo2 dKO or Slo2.2 KO cells with 70 mM Na<sup>+</sup> (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). Excised inside-out patches confirmed that Slo2 dKO removed a Na\u2013dependent K<sup>+</sup> channel (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>) which exhibited little voltage-dependence over the range of \u221280 through \u221220 mV (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>) with a single channel conductance of about 127 pS (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>). Finally, we compared the whole-cell steady-state current\u2013voltage (I\u2013V) relationship between WT and Slo2 dKO cells over the range of \u2212125 to \u221225 mV, with 70 mM pipette Na<sup>+</sup> along with the steady-state IV relationship persisting in WT cells after 30 min with 70 mM pipette Na<sup>+</sup> (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>). This shows the relatively voltage-independent nature of the background K<sub>Na</sub> conductance (reversal at E<sub>K</sub>) when the cytosolic Na<sup>+</sup> concentration is constant."

Our results suggest that essentially all dissociated small diameter DRG neurons express K<sub>Na</sub> current which can be attributed exclusively to Slo2.2 subunits. The magnitude of the K<sub>Na</sub> current decreased with time in culture, being \u223c1013 \u00b1 95 pA (n = 44 cells) after 2\u201310 hr of culture, but only 277 \u00b1 70 pA (n = 9 cells) after 2\u20133 days in culture (<a href=\"#fig6s4\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 4B</a>). Measurement of K<sub>Na</sub> current in a set of small diameter neurons in DRG slices yielded similar results (<a href=\"#fig6s5\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). However, one difference was that, although Slo2.2 accounted for most of the K<sub>Na</sub> current in DRG neurons in slices, after 2\u20133 min of dialysis of the pipette solution into the Slo2.2 KO neurons, some residual Na<sup>+</sup>-dependent current was observed. Although neurons in slices may be uniquely affected by dialysis of 70 mM cytosolic Na<sup>+</sup>, this observation raises the possibility that channels containing Slo2.1 subunits may be present at more peripheral locations in the DRG neurons, perhaps consistent with the presence of message encoding Slo2.1 and some Slo2.1 protein in DRG samples, as described above."

AP waveforms were then transformed into phase plots (dV/dt vs V) for each cell (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E</a>). Since peak dV/dt can vary substantially among cells, we have defined the threshold in a given cell as the V<sub>m</sub> value at which dV/dt reaches 10% of its peak value (dotted lines on <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E,F</a>). This comparison shows that APs are initiated from a more negative V<sub>m</sub> in dKO cells than in WT cells (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8G</a>). In contrast to the effects of Slo2 dKO on AP initiation, a number of other properties of single APs, including peak AP amplitude, AP half-width, and AP after-hyperpolarization, showed no obvious differences (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). However, with both 10 and 0 mM pipette Na<sup>+</sup>, dKO cells exhibited a somewhat more depolarized V<sub>m</sub>, although no obvious difference in input resistance (R<sub>in</sub>) measured from a 10 mV step from \u221260 to \u221270 mV was noted. Potential reasons for the apparent discrepancy between V<sub>m</sub> and R<sub>in</sub> will be considered below."

From a holding potential of \u221260 mV, cells were therefore stimulated with a 40 ms voltage-ramp up to \u221220 mV (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8H</a>).

For example, a shift in Nav channel activation to more negative potentials in dKO neurons might produce qualitatively similar effects. We therefore tested several inhibitors and activators of K<sub>Na</sub> current as tools to examine the properties of ramp-activated current in WT cells, but slow onset of action and non-specific effects on other ion channels precluded their use. As an alternative, having shown that extracellular Cs<sup>+</sup> inhibits K<sub>Na</sub> current, we examined the ability of 20 mM Cs<sup>+</sup> to influence excitability and ramp-activated currents in both WT and dKO DRG neurons with 0 mM pipette Na<sup>+</sup> (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>). As shown above, the voltage-ramp activated a much more pronounced low-voltage outward current in WT cells than in dKO cells, with a marked shift in the 0 current potential (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>). Application of 20 mM extracellular Cs<sup>+</sup> to WT neurons also resulted in a reduction in ramp-activated outward current and a shift in the 0 current voltage (p = 0.000; <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>), quite comparable to the current observed in the dKO neurons (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C</a>). In contrast, application of 20 mM Cs<sup>+</sup> to the dKO cells produced only small shifts in the 0 current voltage (p = 0.675; <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9D</a>). Overall, 20 mM Cs<sup>+</sup> mimicked the effect of Slo2 dKO on the 0 current voltage (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9E</a>), while also producing essentially identical effects on measurement of rheobase in the same set of neurons (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9F</a>). That an apparent shift in the voltages over which the surge of inward current is observed can occur from K<sup>+</sup> channel inhibition is also highlighted in comparisons of the normalized ramp activated currents (<a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), which clearly shows the ability of Cs<sup>+</sup> to produce a shift in apparent inward current activation in WT cells which is much more reduced in the dKO cells. Inhibition by Cs<sup>+</sup> is likely to differ from Slo2 dKO in two primary ways: first, K<sub>Na</sub> will not be inhibited completely by Cs<sup>+</sup> at these voltages and second, Cs<sup>+</sup> is likely to inhibit other K<sup>+</sup> currents in addition to K<sub>Na</sub>. However, the results clearly support the view that an apparent shift in inward current activation occurs with inhibition of subthreshold K<sup>+</sup> currents, likely to include K<sub>Na</sub>."

Trains of 5 or 10 APs applied at 7 Hz were unable to elicit any slow AHP in IB4+ small diameter neurons different from that elicited by a single AP (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>). This further suggests that K<sub>Na</sub> current in DRG neurons, at least with physiological ionic solutions, contributes negligibly to membrane potential regulation following APs."

Yet, even with identification of the two mammalian Slo2 genes that encode K<sub>Na</sub> channels of the type observed in the early studies (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bhattacharjee et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Yuan et al., 2003</a>), full definition of functional properties and physiological roles of K<sub>Na</sub> currents have proven somewhat elusive, despite the apparently widespread distribution of Slo2 subunits in excitable tissue (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bhattacharjee et al., 2002</a>, <a href=\"#bib7\">2005</a>). Recent demonstration of neurological disorders linked to Slo2.2 (<a href=\"#bib2\">Barcia et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Martin et al., 2014</a>) further highlights the potential importance of such channels. The availability of Slo2.1 and Slo2.2 KO mice will now provide an additional tool to probe the roles of K<sub>Na</sub> currents. The present results demonstrating the loci of expression of message for Slo2.1 and Slo2.2 subunits, the presence of Slo2.1 and Slo2.2 protein in various tissues, and the natural occurrence of Slo2.1/Slo2.2 heteromultimers confirms and extends earlier work regarding the loci of expression of Slo2 subunits (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bhattacharjee et al., 2002</a>, <a href=\"#bib6\">2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Chen et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Tamsett et al., 2009</a>), while also providing KO controls confirming the utility of antibodies in western blots. Here, focusing on the role of Slo2.2 in sensory function, we observed that Slo2.2, but not Slo2.1, KO results in enhanced itch and, to a lesser extent, pain responses. Furthermore, KO of Slo2.2, but not Slo2.1, results in complete absence of the DRG K<sub>Na</sub> current. This loss of Slo2 current results in increased excitability in response to depolarizing stimuli, likely accounting for the observed phenotypes."

The effect on AP threshold was revealed in multiple kinds of tests, a decrease in rheobase, a negative shift in AP threshold determined from the rate of AP rise (dV/dt), and also from a similar negative shift in the voltage at which current becomes net inward during a ramp protocol. Similar changes in AP threshold were observed with both 0 and 10 mM pipette Na<sup>+</sup>, excluding a key role for differences in pipette Na<sup>+</sup> as a determinant of basal K<sub>Na</sub> activation. Overall, the results require that K<sub>Na</sub> acts as a mild brake to the onset of AP initiation. Furthermore, we observed no difference in AHP amplitude measured following single APs between WT and KO cells, either with 0 or 10 mM pipette Na<sup>+</sup>. Trains of APs also did not evoke the development of slower AHPs."

In different cases, a primary role for K<sub>Na</sub> current has been proposed either in fast (<a href=\"#bib24\">Hess et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Yang et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Gribkoff and Kaczmarek, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Markham et al., 2013</a>) or slower afterhyperpolarizations that may require trains of several APs to develop (<a href=\"#bib47\">Schwindt et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Kim and McCormick, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Franceschetti et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Wallen et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Zhang et al., 2010a</a>). In the case of rapid coupling of K<sub>Na</sub> activation to single APs, this potentially provides a mechanism to facilitate high frequency firing (<a href=\"#bib57\">Yang et al., 2007</a>), while slow AHP development serves to support AP accommodation and termination of burst activity. The present results do not preclude such roles for K<sub>Na</sub> either in rapid repolarization or slow AHPs in other cells. However, the specific role of K<sub>Na</sub> channels in any cell would depend intimately on the balance of other repolarizing conductances, along with magnitude, spatial, and temporal properties of any cytosolic [Na<sup>+</sup>] elevation. In this regards, it is worth mentioning that some of the best support for the presence of K<sub>Na</sub> currents in cortical neurons has required conditions under which Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent outward currents are inhibited (<a href=\"#bib47\">Schwindt et al., 1989</a>). Given the abundance of other repolarizing conductances in DRG neurons, it is perhaps not unexpected that modest K<sub>Na</sub> activation during AP repolarization in DRG neurons may have negligible effects on V<sub>m</sub>. Our observations are, in fact, consistent with earlier results in rat DRG neurons, in which both AP duration and AHPs were unchanged when extracellular Na<sup>+</sup> was replaced by Li<sup>+</sup> (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bischoff et al., 1998</a>), despite the fact that Li<sup>+</sup> does not substitute for Na<sup>+</sup> in K<sub>Na</sub> activation (<a href=\"#bib46\">Safronov and Vogel, 1996</a>)."

                        "text": "If K<sub>Na</sub> activity acts as a brake to AP initiation, how is K<sub>Na</sub> activation elicited? Despite the well-established existence of K<sub>Na</sub> channels, the circumstances under which cytosolic Na<sup>+</sup> elevation arising from physiological stimuli is sufficient to produce K<sub>Na</sub> activation remain unclear. In fact, consideration of basic properties of Na<sup>+</sup> diffusion and the expected Na<sup>+</sup> flux through single channels have raised some doubt whether average [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> can ever be sufficient to activate K<sub>Na</sub> (<a href=\"#bib16\">Dryer, 1991</a>). Some aspects of our data partially address these issues, but there are complexities in our observations that are not readily explained. The differences in firing properties of WT and dKO cells, both with 0 and 10 mM pipette Na<sup>+</sup>, suggest that K<sub>Na</sub> activation is unaffected over the range of 0\u201310 mM pipette Na<sup>+</sup>. This is not surprising given that the threshold for K<sub>Na</sub> activation may be higher than 10 mM (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bischoff et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Tamsett et al., 2009</a>). Furthermore, when R<sub>in</sub> was measured with a step from \u221260 to \u221270 mV, no difference between WT and dKO neurons was observed either with 0 and 10 mM pipette Na<sup>+</sup>. Similarly, with R<sub>in</sub> measured by a fit to the I\u2013V relationship over voltages from \u2212120 to \u221260 mV with 0 Na<sup>+</sup> pipette solution, no Cs<sup>+</sup> dependent inhibition of conductance was observed in either WT or dKO neurons. Although it has been suggested that some Slo2.2 channel activation may occur in 0 Na<sup>+</sup> (<a href=\"#bib26\">Huang et al., 2013</a>), the present results suggest that in DRG neurons basal K<sub>Na</sub> activity at potentials negative to \u221260 mV does not occur. However, both with 0 and 10 mM pipette Na<sup>+</sup>, WT cells exhibited a slightly more negative V<sub>m</sub> than dKO cells. If pipette Na<sup>+</sup> itself does not influence the differences in WT cells from dKO cells, how might these differences arise? The largely linear behavior of both the WT and dKO neuron steady-state I\u2013V relationship from \u2212120 mV to \u221260 mV begins to exhibit distinct upward curvature in the range of \u221260 to \u221250 mV, bracketing the range of measured membrane potentials. This would suggest that conductances are active at rest that are apparently not active negative to \u221260 mV. Based on the differences in WT and dKO resting potentials, K<sub>Na</sub> current is clearly a candidate for one of these conductances. In addition, that V<sub>m</sub> is close to \u221250 mV with E<sub>K</sub> \u223c \u221280 mV suggests that there may be appreciable inward Na current at potentials above \u221260 mV. Future work will be required to assess the identity of any components of Na<sup>+</sup> current active at such potentials. Voltage-step protocols used here from a holding potential of \u221270 mV reveal little obvious inward current until at least \u221230 mV. Both Nav1.8 and Nav1.9 channels are known to be expressed in some small diameter IB4+ neurons (<a href=\"#bib18\">Fang et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Strickland et al., 2008</a>) and Nav1.9, in particular, may begin to activate at potentials close to resting potentials we have observed (<a href=\"#bib44\">Rugiero et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Coste et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Zhao et al., 2011b</a>). Another possibility reflects the proposal that K<sub>Na</sub> currents in some neurons may be selectively activated by persistent TTX-sensitive Na<sup>+</sup> currents (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hage and Salkoff, 2012</a>). TTX-sensitive Nav1.7 channels can be found in small diameter DRG neurons (<a href=\"#bib40\">Nassar et al., 2004</a>) and, although such channels are largely inactivated near DRG resting potentials (<a href=\"#bib54\">Vijayaragavan et al., 2001</a>), it is possible that even under steady-state inactivated conditions some persistent openings occur. Perhaps as Slo1 Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent K<sup>+</sup> channels are coupled to specific Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (<a href=\"#bib4\">Berkefeld et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Berkefeld and Fakler, 2008</a>), molecular coupling of K<sub>Na</sub> channels to specific sources of Na<sup>+</sup> influx may occur."

This issue might be of particular concern in regards to DRG neurons, since it is well-known that a variety of manipulations can readily induce changes in various DRG current properties, including Nav channels, resulting in altered excitability (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chahine and O'Leary, 2014</a>). Furthermore, in the particular case of Slo2.2, it has been proposed that severe human pathologies associated with Slo2.2 mutation arise from extensive alterations in gene and protein expression throughout the nervous system (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kaczmarek, 2013</a>). In the present case, two possible alternative mechanisms by which rheobase, AP threshold, and excitability might be altered as observed in the Slo2 dKO neurons would be, first, a shift in Nav current activation to more negative potentials and, second, a loss of some other K<sup>+</sup> current active in the subthreshold range of voltages. Although we cannot fully exclude that there have been no changes other than loss of K<sub>Na</sub> current in the Slo2 dKO DRG neurons, the demonstration that inhibition of subthreshold K<sup>+</sup> current by Cs<sup>+</sup> mimicked the behavior of the dKO neurons strongly argues that a change in Nav channel expression does not underlie the observed phenotypes and, furthermore, that removal of a sub-threshold K<sup>+</sup> conductance can produce the particular constellation of changes we have observed. Finally, we did not observe any indication of a loss in a near threshold K<sup>+</sup> conductance other than K<sub>Na</sub>, although any such change might be difficult to resolve."

From <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>, we observed an average K<sub>Na</sub> conductance of 69 nS activated by 70 mM pipette Na<sup>+</sup> around \u221250 mV. Although 70 mM Na<sup>+</sup> produces a less than maximal activation, if one assumes a maximal conductance of 69 nS, the fractional activation of K<sub>Na</sub> required to produce a 3\u20134 mV hyperpolarization corresponds to a Po of about 0.002, which corresponds to 8 pA at \u221250 mV.

Any such deficits, if they exist, apparently spare the basic ability of the dKO animals to eat, mate, and function in a generally normal way. Perhaps relevant to the possibility that Slo2.2 KO may have apparently benign functional consequences, one set of the human Slo2.2 mutations corresponds to gain-of-function changes (<a href=\"#bib2\">Barcia et al., 2012</a>), resulting in larger K<sub>Na</sub> currents.

The <i>Kcnt1</i> floxed mice and <i>Kcnt2</i> floxed mice are available at The Jackson Laboratory as Stock No. 028418 and Stock No. 028419, respectively. Slo2.1 KO and Slo2.2 KO strains of mice have been maintained in a C57BL/6 background out to N = 12. Additional details of the generation of Slo2.1 and Slo2.2 KO mice are provided in the legend to <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>.

Slo2.1 KO predicts a residual protein Slo2.1(1\u2013828) with a predicted MW of 91 kDa, which should be recognized by the NeuroMab antibody, but is not observed in the Slo2.1 KO brain (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). This indicates that, following deletion of exon 22, no residual Slo2.1 protein remains in the knockout mouse, probably due to the instability of the truncated mRNA or protein. In the case of Slo2.2 KO, deletion of exon 11 (encoding amino acids 285\u2013354 of Slo2.2) causes a frame-shift such that the predicted residual Slo2.2(1\u2013252) protein does not contain the sequence recognized by the NeuroMab anti-Slo2.2 antibody. Therefore, no residual Slo2.2 protein was detected in Slo2.2 KO membrane samples. Since the residual Slo2.2(1\u2013252) is terminated in the middle of the S6 segment of the inner helix, it seems unlikely that any residual Slo2.2 protein fragments in the knockout mouse would assemble into functional channels. From <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B,D</a>, it is clear that knocking out the gene for Slo2.1 has no obvious effect on the presence of Slo2.2 protein, and vice versa."

Ganglia were washed three times in HBSS, replaced with 1.5 mg/ml collagenase (Sigma\u2013Aldrich) in HBSS and incubated for 20 min at 37\u00b0C. After washing three times with Neurobasal-A medium supplemented with 10% FBS, B27 supplement, 100 U/ml penicillin/streptomycin, and Glutmax (2 mM L-alanyl-L-glutamine) (all from Life Technologies), ganglia were gently triturated with a flame-polished Pasteur pipette until the solution turned cloudy. The dispersed cells were diluted with growth medium containing supplemented Neurobasal medium. The cells were plated at a density of \u223c2000 cells per well on 12 mm glass coverslips coated with Matrigel (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, United States), and maintained at 37\u00b0C in humidified air with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 1 hr before onset of recording. Most experiments were done within 8 hr after dissociation and changes of the culture medium were not necessary. For 2\u20133 days in culture, half the medium was replaced with fresh growth medium on the second day."

In brief, mice were killed by CO<sub>2</sub> inhalation, rapidly decapitated, and six ganglia from lower thoracic and lumber regions were carefully removed in ice-cold Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS, Invitrogen; Carlsbad, CA, United States). Ganglia were desheathed using fine forceps, placed in the center of a 35 mm petri dish, then filled with with 40\u00b0C 4% low melting agar (wt/vol in HBSS). The dish was then immediately submerged in ice-cold artificial CSF cutting solution, which contained the following (in mM): 125 NaCl, 3.5 KCl, 0.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 3.5 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 26 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, and 10 D-glucose. The solution was bubbled with 95%O<sub>2</sub>/5%CO<sub>2</sub> to maintain pH at \u223c7.4. After solidification of the agar, small blocks containing ganglia were cut out and glued onto the cutting platform of a vibratome (VT100, Leica, Buffalo Grove, IL, United States) for cutting. Slices were stored for 45 min at 35\u00b0C and kept at room temperature until recording. The oxygenated storage solution contained the following (in mM): 125 NaCl, 3.5 KCl, 26 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 10 D-glucose, 2.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 1.3 MgCl<sub>2</sub>. Individual slices were subsequently transferred to a recording chamber continuously perfused (3 ml/min) with oxygenated saline at room temperature.

Patch-clamp pipettes typically were of 1.5\u20132.5 M\u03a9. Following whole-cell access, cells were used if the series resistance (Rs) was less than 10 G\u03a9. Rs was compensated 85%. For excised patch experiments, pipettes of similar size were used to form G\u03a9 seals on dissociated DRG neurons before excision.

The authors find that knockout of <i>slo2.2</i> channels but not <i>slo2.1</i> channels results in somewhat enhanced rapid pain and itch responses, most notably in the scratching induced by chloroquine or histamine injection in the first 5 minutes after injection, when wild-type animals have only small responses. In terms of electrophysiology, the authors do two sets of experiments. In one, they identify a sodium-activated conductance that is induced by dialyzing cells with 70 mM Na and show that this is gone in <i>slo2.2</i> KO animals. In the second, they study firing properties of the neurons with either physiological (10 mM) or 0 mM internal sodium. Surprisingly, they find that the <i>slo2.2</i>-KO animals have enhanced firing frequencies in either condition, accompanied by a reduction in spike threshold."

Another recent paper (<a href=\"#bib34\">Lu et al., 2015</a>, duly cited) also examined <i>slo2.2</i> KO mice for both electrophysiology of DRG neurons and for behavioral pain responses (but not itch). Unlike the present manuscript, Lu et al. reported no changes in acute pain responses but only in models of neuropathic pain. There is no real experimental conflict, because in the present manuscript the effects on acute pain were actually quite subtle, and were most clearly illustrated by a change in the dose-response curve for capsaicin injections. In the present manuscript the most dramatic effect in the knockout was a large increase in scratching in the first 5 minutes after injection of chloroquine and histamine, and itching was not tested by Lu et al. Therefore the behavioral effects in this manuscript are novel and interesting."

Although we would still suggest that, given that we demonstrate that K<sub>Na</sub> is absent in the KO cells, the absence of K<sub>Na</sub> current is the simplest potential explanation for such a difference, we have now spent more time, both in new experiments and in discussion, addressing other possibilities, including possible compensatory changes in other currents."

The crux of this issue concerns both when K<sub>Na</sub> current is active and how any activation is controlled by Na<sup>+</sup>. Although we agree that a full answer to these questions is critical, it is beyond the scope of this paper and actually represent questions that have been posed and left unanswered for well over 20 years now. However, we have brought some new data to bear on this topic. We have included new results that more strongly argue that there is no basal activation of K<sub>Na</sub> in WT neurons with 0 mM pipette Na<sup>+</sup> (<a href=\"#fig9s2\">Figure 9\u2013figure supplement 2E-F</a>). Furthermore, over the voltage range of -120 to -60 mV, there is no clear difference in input resistance between WT and dKO cells and, importantly, Cs<sup>+</sup> does not reduce the resting conductance, negative to -60 mV. But we do consistently observe a difference in resting potential between WT and dKO neurons, which requires some difference in conductance in voltage range between -60 and -45 mV. Although our results do not allow definitive identification of currents active in this range, two factors lead to the hypothesis that a small amount of K<sub>Na</sub> is active near resting potentials: first, that we know that K<sub>Na</sub> is absent in the KO and, second, the resting potential of the DRG neurons is fairly positive. Since neither 0 nor 10 mM Na is thought to be sufficient to produce such activation, part of this hypothesis requires that there be some basal Na flux that produces a local [Na] sufficient to produce the very low Po K<sub>Na</sub> activity required to produce the modest hyperpolarization in WT cells. We also include some simple calculations regarding how much K<sub>Na</sub> activation would actually be required at rest. Although such considerations are admittedly rather speculative, they do highlight how very small conductances can play very important roles near resting potentials."

In our new data (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a> and supplements), two observations support the view that changes in Nav gating range are not the explanation for the greater excitability of dKO neurons: first, simple inhibition of the ramp-activated outward current in WT cells by the concentration of Cs found to largely block K<sub>Na</sub> current produces a shift in the 0 current membrane potential very similar to that observed in dKO neurons. In contrast, Cs produces a minor shift in the dKO neurons. Thus, simple alteration of K<sup>+</sup> conductance preceding the surge of inward current can shift the apparent (but not real) range of Nav activation. Furthermore, in <a href=\"#fig9s2\">Figure 9\u2013figure supplement 2</a> we show that there is difference in the range of activation of Nav current between WT and dKO cells that would account for the observed shifts in 0 current potential and rheobase. Similarly, there are no changes in the major voltage-dependent K<sup>+</sup> current that might account for the excitability changes. Given the heterogeneity of current phenotypes in DRG cells, we think additional work with fully isolated currents will be appropriate, but for this set of cells which reveals the same properties of ramp-activated outward current differences between WT and KO cells as described in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>, we can recapitulate essentially the main features of dKO by simple inhibition of outward current preceding the AP."

However, it may be wondered why we choose Cs<sup>+</sup> for these experiments. We do, in fact, have a set of experiments with various compounds thought to act on SLO2 channels, both activators and inhibitors, with which we hoped that we might obtain within cell comparisons that would either further support or contradict the comparisons between KO and WT cells. Unfortunately, we obtained very unsatisfying results with loxapine, bithionol, and bepridil, all three of which produce inhibition of Nav current at concentrations comparable to those affecting K<sub>Na</sub> channels. The slow onset of action of such compounds was also problematic.

                    "text": "This was largely addressed above, but is repeated here. Our results lead us to suggest that slack channels are open at rest, at very low open probability, but that slack activation also increases during the rise to threshold. As discussed more thoroughly above, we have more explicitly addressed this issue both with new experiments and in the Discussion. However, this is not an easy question to definitely answer, and the identity and magnitude of the full set of conductances active at rest (and subthreshold) are not readily identified. As noted above, the discrepancy our results raise is that, although no differences in input resistance (measured negative to -60 mV) are noted between WT and dKO cells, we have consistently observed resting potential differences that do not seem readily explained solely on the basis the unfortunate heterogeneity of DRG neurons. Given that the relatively linear IV from -60 to -120 mV begins to markedly deviate above -60 mV, SLO2 channels are certainly candidates for a conductance that might contribute in this window. However, as we discuss, such a conductance would be very small at rest and activation at rest, but not negative to -60 mV would seem likely to require coupling to a source of Na influx in this window. Unfortunately, that remains a topic about which we know essentially nothing, so although the results suggest particular explanations, they remain decidedly speculative. Although it is to be expected that there is a Na flux in the -60 mV to -50 mV window that contributes to the relatively positive resting potentials, whether the coupling could be strong enough to produce even small K<sub>Na</sub> activation is unknown. These complicated questions are not easy to tease apart, given the small size of the conductances/currents and woefully nonspecific pharmacological agents. We think the present work points to some approaches that might be taken to address this more definitely in the future work. It was not the purpose of this manuscript to explain fully the role of K<sub>Na</sub> current during DRG electrical activity although that would have been nice. However, the effects on rheobase strongly focused our attention on processes that precede the upswing of the AP. For now, we feel the approaches we have taken are important in establishing a new way that Slack current can influence excitability and point to important new questions."

However, the Lu paper does not undertake an examination of the basis for any firing differences in their KO animals, the size of neurons from which they record was not reported, and we simply felt there was no need to point out things that might be lacking in the other paper. The key point is that both papers note that excitability in response to constant current injection is increased. We feel that this is consistent with the idea that acute effects on sensory stimuli would likely be observed, even in the absence of neuropathic pain protocols."
