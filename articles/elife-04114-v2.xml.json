They occur in ill-defined reverse-transcription- and pre-integration-complexes (RTC, PIC) with various host and viral proteins implicated. In this study, we report quantitative detection of functional RTC/PIC by labeling nascent DNA combined with detection of viral integrase. We show that the viral CA (capsid) protein remains associated with cytoplasmic RTC/PIC but is lost on nuclear PIC in a HeLa-derived cell line. In contrast, nuclear PIC were almost always CA-positive in primary human macrophages, indicating nuclear import of capsids or capsid-like structures. We further show that the CA-targeted inhibitor PF74 exhibits a bimodal mechanism, blocking RTC/PIC association with the host factor CPSF6 and nuclear entry at low, and abrogating reverse transcription at high concentrations. The newly developed system is ideally suited for studying retroviral post-entry events and the roles of host factors including DNA sensors and signaling molecules."

They occur in ill-defined reverse-transcription- and pre-integration-complexes (RTC, PIC) with various host and viral proteins implicated. In this study, we report quantitative detection of functional RTC/PIC by labeling nascent DNA combined with detection of viral integrase. We show that the viral CA (capsid) protein remains associated with cytoplasmic RTC/PIC but is lost on nuclear PIC in a HeLa-derived cell line. In contrast, nuclear PIC were almost always CA-positive in primary human macrophages, indicating nuclear import of capsids or capsid-like structures. We further show that the CA-targeted inhibitor PF74 exhibits a bimodal mechanism, blocking RTC/PIC association with the host factor CPSF6 and nuclear entry at low, and abrogating reverse transcription at high concentrations. The newly developed system is ideally suited for studying retroviral post-entry events and the roles of host factors including DNA sensors and signaling molecules."

The virus consists of two strands of RNA\u2014representing the genetic information of the virus\u2014contained in a protein coat called capsid. Scientists have learned that the virus' RNA is used to create viral DNA in the cytoplasm of an infected cell, in a process called reverse transcription. This viral DNA then enters the cell's nucleus and becomes incorporated into the cell's DNA, and the cell unwittingly begins to help the virus reproduce."

                        "text": "The early phase of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) replication involves reverse transcription of the viral RNA genome in the cytoplasm followed by nuclear entry of the linear double-stranded viral cDNA and integration into a host cell chromosome. Virus entry by membrane fusion releases the viral capsid containing genomic RNA and viral structural and replication proteins into the cytoplasm. While much is known about the biochemistry and inhibition of reverse transcription (<a href=\"#bib27\">Hu and Hughes, 2012</a>), the processes of uncoating, genome replication, and nuclear trafficking are currently not well understood in infected cells. Several viral and host factors have been implicated in these steps, but their precise contributions are largely unknown. Different models have been proposed for genome uncoating, which is defined as the loss of the viral capsid structure that consists of homomultimers of CA (capsid) proteins: (i) immediate dissociation after fusion followed by reverse transcription within the remaining nucleoprotein complex; (ii) gradual dissociation during reverse transcription regulated by sequential contact with host factors; (iii) reverse transcription in an intact or largely intact capsid structure that only dissociates at the nuclear pore complex (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib5\">Arhel (2010)</a>). Several recent studies indicated that mutations in CA as well as small molecule compounds targeting CA can affect reverse transcription and nuclear import (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib35\">Matreyek and Engelman (2013)</a>), disfavoring the model of immediate capsid dissociation. Furthermore, various host factors interacting with CA have been implicated in the early phase of HIV-1 replication, again arguing for a functional contribution of CA at this stage (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib35\">Matreyek and Engelman (2013)</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Ambrose and Aiken (2014)</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Hilditch and Towers (2014)</a>). Reverse transcription in the shielded capsid environment could prevent HIV-1 from recognition by cytoplasmic DNA sensors with subsequent capsid uncoating at the nuclear pore considered to be required for nuclear entry (<a href=\"#bib35\">Matreyek and Engelman, 2013</a>). Productive retroviral reverse transcription complexes (RTC) and pre-integration (PIC) complexes have been defined biochemically as high molecular weight complexes that after isolation from cells support endogenous reverse transcription (<a href=\"#bib18\">Fassati and Goff, 1999</a>) and integrate viral cDNA into heterologous target DNA (<a href=\"#bib9\">Brown et al., 1987</a>), respectively. However, the lack of methods for robust and reliable detection so far prevented direct determination of the association of functional RTC/PIC with specific viral or cellular proteins at different post-entry stages."

Accordingly, detection of viral constituents alone does not allow identifying functional structures over the large background of non-functional complexes. Furthermore, HIV-1 replication complexes are inherently transient and unstable complicating biochemical analysis, and different constituents were reported in different biochemical studies (<a href=\"#bib17\">Farnet and Haseltine, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Bukrinsky et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Miller et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Fassati and Goff, 2001</a>). Identifying functional HIV-1 RTC/PIC by imaging techniques would allow in situ investigation but requires the detection of nascent HIV-1 cDNA in association with viral constituents. A pioneering study applied microinjection of fluorescent nucleotides and subsequent HIV-1 infection, detecting microtubule association of a replication complex by correlative light and negative stain electron microscopy (<a href=\"#bib37\">McDonald et al., 2002</a>). However, no further information on the RTC could be derived in this study, and the method did not permit reliable identification of larger numbers of RTC/PIC. Accordingly, no follow-up studies applying this technique have been published."

Processing steps during FISH interfere with immunostaining (<a href=\"#bib48\">Solovei and Cremer, 2010</a>), however, making detection of productive HIV-1 RTC/PIC difficult. Alternatively, viral cDNA may be detected by non-specific labeling. Classically, DNA synthesis has been visualized by bromo-deoxyuridine incorporation (<a href=\"#bib22\">Gratzner et al., 1975</a>), which again requires denaturation. More recently, labeling nascent DNA with a nucleoside analogue carrying an alkyne group for bio-orthogonal \u2018click-labeling\u2019 with a fluorophore carrying an azide group has been introduced (<a href=\"#bib42\">Salic and Mitchison, 2008</a>). Click-labeling can be directly performed without denaturation or other processing steps. This novel approach has recently been used successfully for the investigation of SV40 disassembly using pre-labeled particles (<a href=\"#bib30\">Kuksin and Norkin, 2012</a>) and for the detection of replication factories of several DNA viruses (<a href=\"#bib49\">Strang et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Wang et al., 2013</a>). Many viral genomes are rapidly produced in a confined space in these cases, however. In contrast, HIV-1 reverse transcription produces only a single cDNA copy from the \u223c10 kb RNA genome, thus requiring a high sensitivity of detection."

Co-localization of a cytoplasmic EdU signal with GFP-tagged HIV-1 integrase (IN) could be used to reliably detect HIV-1 RTC/PIC in a reporter cell line and primary human macrophages. Specific immunostaining revealed the presence of the HIV-1 CA and NC (nucleocapsid) proteins on almost all cytoplasmic RTC/PIC, while CA was absent from nuclear PIC in a HeLa-derived reporter cell line. In contrast, almost all nuclear PIC were positive for CA in primary human macrophages, while CA detection on cytoplasmic RTC/PIC was more variable in this case. EdU labeling further allowed determination of a dual mode of action for the recently described HIV-1 inhibitor PF-3450074 (PF74; [<a href=\"#bib46\">Shi et al., 2011</a>]) targeting the CPSF6 binding interface of CA. The new method for identification of functional retroviral replication complexes will be widely applicable for studying the RTC/PIC pathway and the roles of host factors, DNA sensors and signaling molecules, as well as association with the nuclear import machinery."

When restricting analysis to extranuclear regions, HIV-1 reverse transcription thus only needs to be distinguished from mitochondrial DNA synthesis. Accordingly, fluorescent labeling of the nascent HIV-1 cDNA using EdU incorporation and click-labeling should allow unequivocal detection of individual productive RTC/PIC when combined with labeling for a component of the viral replication machinery and a mitochondrial marker. To label HIV-1 specific complexes, we made use of a previously described IN.eGFP fusion protein that remains associated with incoming subviral particles throughout early replication and nuclear import (<a href=\"#bib2\">Albanese et al., 2008</a>)."

IN.eGFP was incorporated in similar amounts as virus-encoded IN (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), and incorporation of IN.eGFP reduced infectivity only weakly (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>). Detection of (potentially weak) cytoplasmic DNA signals may be obscured by very strong labeling of replicating nuclear DNA. Indeed, initial EdU labeling experiments revealed bright nuclear fluorescence that prevented analysis of fluorescent signals in the extranuclear region of the same and neighboring cells (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). This problem was overcome by infecting cells in the presence of the DNA polymerase \u03b1/\u03b4 inhibitor aphidicolin (APC). Cell cycle arrest by APC is compatible with HIV-1 replication, and APC caused only a modest reduction of infectivity (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>) since HIV-1 does not require nuclear envelope breakdown for genome integration (<a href=\"#bib50\">Suzuki and Craigie, 2007</a>). Infecting cells at APC concentrations that did not exhibit toxic effects during the incubation period led to a strong reduction of the nuclear EdU signal, now allowing detection of cytoplasmic EdU signals (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>).

Our analysis revealed IN/EdU-positive objects in the cell periphery and deeper in the cytoplasm (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>). To determine whether RTC/PIC in the cell periphery and in the perinuclear region exhibit differences in CA association, we performed SDCM using an antibody against nucleoporins to mark the nuclear envelope. RTC/PICs in the periphery (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,i</a>), close to the nucleus (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,ii</a>) or co-localizing with nuclear pore staining (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,iii</a>) all contained CA. Nuclear HIV-1 specific EdU-positive particles (corresponding to PIC) could not be unambiguously identified in most cells, since EdU signals from residual chromosomal DNA replication prevented their detection, even under APC treatment (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). Occasional cells did not show EdU labeling of chromosomal DNA, however (presumably due to the absence of cellular DNA synthesis during the incubation period). IN.eGFP/EdU-positive nuclear PIC could be detected in these cells, and the nuclear PIC exhibited no detectable CA staining in almost all (23/24) cases (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Thus, cytoplasmic RTC/PIC are clearly associated with CA independent of their subcellular localization, while nuclear PIC have lost most or all of their CA content, at least in this HeLa-derived cell line."

No significant difference was observed for late reverse transcription products when cells were infected with HIV-1 in the presence or absence of 2.7 \u00b5M PF74, while these products were lost upon infection in the presence of EFV or at a higher PF74 concentration, respectively (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). A different result was observed when HIV-1 specific 2-LTR circles, indicative of nuclear import of viral DNA, were quantified. Infection in the presence of 2.7 \u00b5M PF74 almost completely abolished the formation of 2-LTR circles despite normal synthesis of late reverse transcription products, indicating a specific defect in nuclear import of viral cDNA. As expected, EFV or 8.1 \u00b5M PF74 abolished 2-LTR circles as well, while incubation in the presence of the IN inhibitor elvitegravir (EVG), which blocks chromosomal integration of the HIV-1 cDNA without affecting reverse transcription or nuclear import (<a href=\"#bib47\">Shimura et al., 2008</a>), yielded a strong increase of 2-LTR circles (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Taken together these results indicate a dose-dependent bimodal effect of PF74 on early HIV-1 infection, targeting reverse transcription and PIC nuclear import, respectively."

                                "text": "The nuclear import defect at low concentrations of PF74 may be caused by binding of this compound to a reactive groove on the viral capsid, leading to competitive inhibition of capsid interaction with the host proteins Nup153 and CPSF6 (<a href=\"#bib36\">Matreyek et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Price et al., 2014</a>). Both of these proteins have been implicated in HIV-1 PIC nuclear import (<a href=\"#bib35\">Matreyek and Engelman, 2013</a>). We therefore investigated the association of RTC/PIC with CPSF6 in the presence and absence of PF74. Immunostaining of CPSF6 revealed an almost exclusively nuclear localization of this protein with very weak cytoplasmic staining in TZM-bl cells (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), consistent with previously published reports (<a href=\"#bib13\">De Iaco et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Fricke et al., 2013</a>). Nevertheless, a clear CPSF6 signal co-localizing with the RTC/PIC was detected in 22% of all cases in TZM-bl cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>; 92 RTC/PIC analyzed). Given the very weak cytoplasmic CPSF6 signal, we considered the possibility that this relatively low number of co-localizing structures may be due to insufficient sensitivity of our detection system. To overcome this obstacle, we made use of a HeLa-derived cell line with a stable knock-down of transportin-3 (TNPO3) (<a href=\"#bib54\">Thys et al., 2011</a>). This protein functions as a nuclear import factor for CPSF6, andTNPO3 knock-down has been shown to lead to cytoplasmic accumulation of CPSF6 (<a href=\"#bib13\">De Iaco et al., 2013</a>). Accordingly, an increased cytoplasmic CPSF6 signal was detected in the TNPO3 knock-down cell line but not in a control cell line expressing a scrambled shRNA (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B,C</a>). Consistent with our hypothesis, we observed that 87% of all RTC/PIC were positive for CPSF6 upon infection of the TNPO3 knock-down cell line (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>; 87 RTC/PIC analyzed). Treatment of TNPO3 knock-down cells with 2 \u00b5M PF74 during infection strongly reduced the level of CPSF6 association with RTC/PIC to 18% (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>; 74 RTC/PIC analyzed). These results provide direct evidence for the association of cytoplasmic CPSF6 with the incoming viral capsid and for competitive inhibition of this interaction by the small molecule inhibitor PF74."

These cells do not represent natural target cells of HIV-1, however. We therefore extended our analysis to primary human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM). MDM were chosen because they are natural targets of HIV-1 infection with a morphology well suited for microscopy, and they are post-mitotic cells lacking nuclear DNA synthesis. The experiments with MDM were performed using HIV-1 carrying Env proteins with a tropism for the CCR5 co-receptor. IN.eGFP/EdU-positive RTC/PIC could be detected in HIV-1 infected MDM (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>), albeit at a much lower frequency compared to TZM-bl cells. HIV-1 uptake into macrophages is more specific, but much less efficient than in HeLa-derived cells. Furthermore, the cellular restriction factor SAMHD1 inhibits HIV-1 replication in primary macrophages at the stage of reverse transcription (<a href=\"#bib26\">Hrecka et al., 2011</a>). Accordingly, the average number of RTC/PIC detected in macrophages observed at 24 hr or 48 hr after infection was 10- to 50-fold lower compared to HeLa-derived cells infected for 4 hr and showed significant donor dependent variation (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 7\u2014source data 1</a>). Analyzing a total of 567 MDM from eight different donors in five independent experiments, we observed a total of 135 RTC/PIC in the cytoplasm of these cells. HIV-1 CA was found to be associated with only 44% of these RTC/PIC (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>), while &gt;97% of cytoplasmic RTC/PIC were CA-positive in the case of TZM-bl cells. The proportion of CA-positive RTC/PIC in MDM decreased over time with \u223c50% CA-positive at 24 hr and \u223c30% CA-positive at 48 hr (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>), indicating time-dependent loss of CA from cytoplasmic RTC/PIC."

EdU click-labeling has no specificity for viral DNA, but the observation of IN.eGFP/EdU-positive objects in the extranuclear region, not overlapping with mitochondria and almost completely blocked by EFV, clearly identified functional HIV-1 RTC/PIC in proliferating reporter cells. Nuclear PIC were only detectable in cells that had not undergone DNA synthesis during the labeling period in several HeLa-derived cell lines, while lack of cellular DNA synthesis in post-mitotic macrophages allowed easier detection of nuclear PIC in this case. EdU-positive HIV-1 complexes mainly accumulated between 2 hr and 4 hr after infection of HeLa-derived cells, consistent with detection of reverse transcription products by quantitative PCR in this cell type at early time points (<a href=\"#bib53\">Thomas et al., 2011</a>). RTC/PIC were detected much later upon infection of primary MDM and accumulated over time; this slower formation is again consistent with previous PCR results (<a href=\"#bib4\">Ambrose et al., 2012</a>). Furthermore, nuclear PIC mainly accumulated between 24 hr and 48 hr in MDM, indicating the time frame of nuclear import in this cell type. In contrast to PCR-based detection of RT products or nuclear 2-LTR circles, which has to be performed on bulk extracts, the imaging method established here allows identification of individual RTC/PIC in the physiological environment of the infected cell."

Our experimental system operates at almost single molecule sensitivity (detection limit 1\u20132 dye molecules per confocal volume; <a href=\"#fig1s6\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 6A</a>), but RTC/PIC detection also depends on relative EdU incorporation and click-labeling efficiency.

Clearly, lack of MA detection by immunofluorescence does not rule out the presence of some MA molecules on RTC/PIC, but the bulk of MA appears to be lost. NC is a nucleic-acid binding protein that coats the viral RNA genome, and NC mutations have been shown to affect HIV-1 integration (<a href=\"#bib12\">Cimarelli et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Thomas et al., 2011</a>).

CA association of cytoplasmic RTC/PIC was independent of subcellular localization, arguing against a gradual loss of CA during trafficking to the nuclear pore. Consistent with this hypothesis, we observed a similar or slightly higher CA labeling intensity on RTC/PIC compared with EdU-negative intracellular HIV-1 particles. Several previous studies reported a time-dependent loss of CA signals on cytoplasmic structures positive for the HIV-1 accessory protein Vpr in HeLa- or HOS-derived cell lines infected with VSV-G pseudotyped VLPs (<a href=\"#bib37\">McDonald et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Hulme et al., 2011</a>), suggesting gradual capsid uncoating during reverse transcription. Alternatively, the reported loss of CA signal may have been due to the inaccessibility of the reactive epitope due to conformational changes and/or host protein binding after cytoplasmic entry, especially since monoclonal antibodies were used in these studies. An influence of the entry pathway may also be considered as these prior studies used VSV-G pseudotyped particles entering via the endosomal route. RTC/PIC co-localizing with nuclear pore proteins in TZM-bl cells also exhibited a strong CA signal, while CA was absent from all but one nuclear PIC indicating that CA is lost at the nuclear pore or shortly after nuclear entry in this cell type. This hypothesis is consistent with the described interaction of CA with nucleoporins 153 and 358 (<a href=\"#bib43\">Schaller et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Matreyek et al., 2013</a>) and suggests that cDNA within the intact viral capsid or a capsid-derived structure docks to the nuclear pore complex followed by dissociation of CA and nuclear import."

Less than half of the RTC/PIC showed a detectable CA signal in this case, while &gt;97% of all RTC/PIC were CA-positive in HeLa-derived cells. This difference is unlikely to be caused by earlier CA uncoating of productive RTC/PIC in MDM, since almost all nuclear PIC (97%) were CA-positive in this cell type. We even observed a CA-positive nuclear PIC and a CA-negative cytoplasmic RTC/PIC in the same cell (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). These observations suggest that the intact or remodeled viral capsid is imported through the intact nuclear pore in post-mitotic MDM following complete or partial reverse transcription. This is completely different from the results observed in HeLa-derived cells and is not predicted by any of the current models for early HIV-1 replication. The fact that nuclear PIC in MDM were clearly CA-positive, while the majority of cytoplasmic RTC/PIC were CA-negative in the same cells, and CA appeared to be lost over time suggests that many of the cytoplasmic RTC/PIC detected in MDM were not predecessors of nuclear PIC but may rather represent dead-end products. These (at least partially) uncoated cytoplasmic structures contain incomplete or complete HIV-1 cDNA, which can be exposed to cytoplasmic DNA sensors. They may thus contribute to the strong innate immune response in MDM (<a href=\"#bib31\">Lahaye et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Rasaiyaah et al., 2013</a>). It is difficult to envision, however, how the CA-negative cytoplasmic RTC/PIC could give rise to nuclear PIC, since almost all nuclear PIC were strongly CA-positive. Our results therefore suggest that the capsid or a capsid-derived structure remains intact not only during reverse transcription but also during nuclear import, at least in MDM. Lack of a CA signal on nuclear PIC in the proliferating HeLa-derived reporter cell line may indicate the loss of the capsid at the nuclear pore, but prior to nuclear import, or may be due to more rapid removal of CA after nuclear import in these cells compared to MDM. It appears likely that the capsid has to be removed before proviral integration in all productively infected cells, and the two CA-negative nuclear PIC in MDM in the present study may thus reflect a later stage after nuclear entry. Accordingly, CA-negative nuclear PIC were only detected 48 hr after infection, while all nuclear PIC were CA-positive at 24 hr after infection. Detailed investigation of the time course of events will require detection of RTC/PIC in living cells, however, which is not possible with the current experimental system."

Consistent with previous reports (<a href=\"#bib46\">Shi et al., 2011</a>), we observed loss of reverse transcription products and of RTC/PIC when infecting cells in the presence of 10 \u00b5M PF74. This concentration is much higher than the IC<sub>90</sub> of PF74, however, and inhibition at lower concentrations, while still blocking HIV-1 infection, did not affect RTC/PIC formation or CA association, but rather blocked nuclear import. PF74 binds the same pocket in the N-terminal domain of CA as the cellular proteins CPSF6 and Nup153, both of which have been implicated in nuclear import of the PIC (<a href=\"#bib36\">Matreyek et al., 2013</a>). Recently, Price et al. revealed that the CA hexamer of the mature lattice (and not monomeric CA) constitutes the optimal interface for Nup153 and CPSF6, which have overlapping binding sites on the capsid that are lost upon disassembly (<a href=\"#bib40\">Price et al., 2014</a>). It appears likely, therefore, that PF74 acts as a competitive inhibitor of host factor binding on the intact (or semi-intact) capsid structure at limiting drug concentrations, thereby blocking CPSF6 association and nuclear import. Accordingly, we observed a strong reduction of CPSF6 association with RTC/PIC in the presence of 2 \u00b5M PF74 when cytoplasmic CPSF6 concentration was increased by knock-down of its nuclear import factor TNPO3. Saturating concentrations of PF74 may lead to dissociation of the entire capsid structure with consequent loss of reverse transcription, but this does not appear to be the primary mode of action of this antiviral."

Direct identification of individual productive HIV-1 RTC/PIC by microscopy will be ideally suited to determine the role of these factors in HIV-1 post-entry stages in various host cells including MDM. The association of nuclear PIC with CA in primary human MDM challenges the current hypothesis concerning early HIV-1 replication and shows the power of this direct imaging-based approach. Detection of productive RTC/PIC and their association with viral and host factors can thus be expected to find wide applications in the future and will contribute to unraveling the current mysteries of HIV-1 post-entry events."

Briefly, the cells were imaged in oxygen-depleted hydrocarbonate buffer (pH 8) supplemented with 50 mM mercaptoethylamine (MEA). First, Alexa Fluor 647 was reversibly photoswitched by irradiation with 488 nm (photoactivation) and 647 nm (read-out). For each channel, 8000 images were recorded with an integration time of 50 ms. Then mEos3.2 was photoactivated by irradiation with 405 nm and imaged using an excitation wavelength of 568 nm. Alexa Fluor 532 was photoactivated by irradiation with 514 nm. Single-molecule localization and image reconstruction was performed using the rapidSTORM software (<a href=\"#bib57\">Wolter et al., 2011</a>). The localization accuracy of single-molecule super-resolution microscopy was evaluated experimentally as described earlier using a custom written software (coordinate based localization precision estimator, provided as supplement to <a href=\"#bib16\">Endesfelder et al. (2014)</a>). For each localized fluorophore, the distance to its nearest neighbor fluorophore in an adjacent frame was calculated. As the majority of fluorophores are detected in multiple adjacent frames, the maximum of the nearest neighbor distance distribution represents the error of localization. A pre-requisite for using this approach is a statistically significant number of events (n \u223c 4000). Images were recorded by adding multi-spectral beads (Life Technologies) to the sample and post-aligning the individual images (<a href=\"#bib34\">Malkusch et al., 2012</a>)."

The approach employs a clever use of nucleotide/click chemistry to distinguish cores that are actively reverse transcribing their genomes from the bulk of cores that are inactive and/or have been taken up by endocytosis. As the authors point out, there is currently a great need for experimental approaches for characterizing the early post-entry stages of HIV replication, and this study is important in that regard. In addition, the work is well presented and the characterization of the methodology is generally thorough and convincing, giving confidence that authentic HIV cores really are being visualized. These are all significant strengths. We are concerned, however, that the current study does not yet go far enough in applying the methodology to discover new biology, that the experiments performed in macrophages are not yet conclusive, and that the imaging data need to be more quantitative and the (lack of) effects of APC treatment need to be documented more thoroughly."

The first question is a very important one mechanistically, and the authors do a nice job of demonstrating that in HeLa cells, the bulk of the CA subunits remain associated until the RTC/PIC complex approaches or engages the nuclear pore. The data are the most definitive yet in support of the increasingly attractive idea that reverse transcription and cytoplasmic transport occur within an intact (or nearly intact) capsid. A shortcoming, however, is that the authors perform analogous studies in macrophages (which is to their credit), but then fail to draw any definitive conclusions in this relevant cell type, instead arguing that \u201cthe number of detectable objects was relatively low in most cases, however, and quantitative analysis of a larger number of RTC/PIC in MDM from various donors will be required to determine whether CA is lost more easily from RTC/PIC in these cells.\u201d The authors deserve credit for not overinterpreting limited data, but need to perform sufficient numbers of MDM experiments to allow definitive conclusions to be drawn."

The data are strong as far as they go, but the inhibition of host factor interactions and the putative block to nuclear import is really inferred by process of elimination (i.e., reverse transcribing, intact capsids are observed normal levels in the presence of 2 microM PF74, as assayed in imaging and qPCR experiments, yet 2-LTR circle formation is inhibited, as assayed by qPCR, so the authors conclude that there must be a block to nuclear import). In addition, the capsid uncoating assay wasn't really required to conclude that RT is normal but 2-LTR circle formation is blocked (though, of course, it was useful to see that the capsids remained intact under these conditions). Moreover, one could argue that defining the mechanism of PF74 action isn't really a cutting edge problem, particularly given a recent series of nice papers from the Engelman, James and other labs that strongly imply that PF74 binding must inhibit interactions with host factors like CPSF6 and nucleoporins."

In the revised version, we show data for a total of 135 cytoplasmic RTC/PIC and 70 nuclear PIC from a total of five independent MDM preparations from eight different donors (567 MDM imaged in total). We decided not to use SAMHD1 depletion or other tricks to enhance infection, because this may actually affect RTC/PIC composition and should thus become the topic of future functional studies. We made use of a second macrophage-tropic envelope in these studies, which was directly derived from the cerebrospinal fluid of an HIV-infected person (Env-4059). The results were identical for both macrophage-tropic Env proteins, and were thus combined in the current manuscript."

Only 44% of cytoplasmic RTC/PIC contained detectable CA in MDM (compared to &gt;97% in HeLa-based reporter cells), and those cytoplasmic RTC/PIC in macrophages that did contain CA appeared to be more variable in the intensity of CA staining. Unexpectedly, however, we found that almost all nuclear PIC (68 of 70) contained strong CA staining, even in cells where we could detect cytoplasmic RTC/PIC lacking CA. This is a completely novel and unexpected result that suggests that intact capsids or capsid-like structures enter the nucleus in MDM, while most or all of CA appears to be dissociated from nuclear PICs in the reporter cells. The lower percentage of CA-positive structures in the cytoplasm of MDM may indicate that the CA-negative RTC/PIC could be dead-end structures that lose their capsid shell prior to being able to enter the nucleus. These results are now shown in the new <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a> (which contains some of the data from the previous MDM analysis), and quantitation is reported in the new <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a> and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 7\u2013source data 1</a>.

When performing immunostaining against CPSF6, we noticed that the large majority of CPSF6 is nuclear with only a very weak cytoplasmic CPSF6 signal; this had also been reported by others. Approximately 22% of cytoplasmic RTC/PIC were associated with detectable amounts of CPSF6 in our experiments for wild-type infection in the absence of PF74, and this is shown in the new <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>. Association of CPSF6 with RTC/PIC below the level of sensitivity cannot be ruled out for the CPSF6-negative cytoplasmic RTC/PIC in this experimental system, however. We therefore performed additional experiments in a cell line with a constitutive knock-down of TNPO3, which serves as nuclear import factor for CPSF6. In this cell line, there is significantly more cytoplasmic CPSF6 as shown in the new <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2013figure supplement 1</a>. Infecting the TNPO3 knock-down cell line with HIV-1 in the absence of PF74 revealed association of CPSF6 with cytoplasmic RTC/PIC in 87% of all cases, and the presence of 2 \u00b5M PF74 during infection reduced this number to 18%. Thus, our additional results directly prove the association of CPSF6 with cytoplasmic RTC/PIC and the inhibition of this association by 2 \u00b5M PF74. Accordingly, these additional results clearly demonstrate that the new method can be used to examine RTC/PIC interaction with host factors in a meaningful way as requested by the reviewers."
