Theta-gamma cross-frequency coupling (CFC) predicted successful memory formation, with the involvement of gamma oscillations suggesting memory-relevant local processing in the ATN. The importance of the theta frequency range in memory processing is well-established, and phase alignment of oscillations is considered to be necessary for synaptic plasticity. We hypothesized that theta phase alignment in the ATN would be necessary for memory encoding. Further analysis of the electrophysiological data reveal that phase alignment in the theta rhythm was greater during successful compared with unsuccessful encoding, and that this alignment was correlated with the CFC. These findings support an active processing role for the ATN during memory formation."

Theta-gamma cross-frequency coupling (CFC) predicted successful memory formation, with the involvement of gamma oscillations suggesting memory-relevant local processing in the ATN. The importance of the theta frequency range in memory processing is well-established, and phase alignment of oscillations is considered to be necessary for synaptic plasticity. We hypothesized that theta phase alignment in the ATN would be necessary for memory encoding. Further analysis of the electrophysiological data reveal that phase alignment in the theta rhythm was greater during successful compared with unsuccessful encoding, and that this alignment was correlated with the CFC. These findings support an active processing role for the ATN during memory formation."

Animal and human lesion studies suggest that the anterior thalamic nucleus (ATN) may also be involved as a part of an extended hippocampal-cortical encoding system (<a href=\"#bib13\">Harding et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Vertes et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">van der Werf et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Aggleton et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Aggleton, 2012</a>). However, the deep location and small size of the ATN has limited direct electrophysiological recording of the ATN during human memory formation (encoding). We had the rare opportunity of recording intracranial electroencephalographic (iEEG) data during memory encoding from human volunteers with intrathalamic electrodes implanted to treat pharmaco-resistant epilepsy (<a href=\"#bib29\">Sweeney-Reed et al., 2014</a>). Enhanced frontal cortex-right ATN (RATN) theta phase synchrony and theta-gamma cross-frequency coupling (CFC) in the RATN predicted successful memory encoding. Since the initial work, we have performed additional analyses to delineate the mechanism by which the RATN facilitates memory formation."

We hypothesized that an active role could involve learning-related processes within the RATN, reflected by RATN synaptic modification, and sought an electrophysiological marker of this process. Synaptic modification only occurs when pre- and post-synaptic action potentials occur within a narrow time window (<a href=\"#bib24\">Paulsen and Sejnowski, 2000</a>). Phase alignment indicates an orderly temporal relationship between a stimulus and neural activity across successive stimulus epochs. It has been suggested that oscillatory phase alignment\u2014a re-setting of the phase in a particular frequency range within the neuronal population at the recording site with each new stimulus\u2014is required for activity to fit within the narrow temporal window necessary for synaptic plasticity (<a href=\"#bib24\">Paulsen and Sejnowski, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Rizzuto et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Buzs\u00e1ki and Draguhn, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">D\u00fczel et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Fell and Axmacher, 2011</a>). More specifically, the long-term potentiation associated with long-term memory encoding has been shown in animal studies to occur only during a particular phase of the theta oscillation (<a href=\"#bib9\">Fell and Axmacher, 2011</a>). To address this issue we investigated whether theta phase alignment occurred in the RATN during successful memory formation."

We focused on within-RATN theta-gamma coupling, which differed significantly between successful and unsuccessful encoding (<a href=\"#bib29\">Sweeney-Reed et al., 2014</a>). Because we previously identified a theta/alpha (7\u201312 Hz) phase synchrony difference between successful and unsuccessful encoding early in the post-stimulus period, we also calculated the correlation between phase alignment of these oscillations and subsequent CFC. The CFC frequency ranges (means over 7\u20138 Hz and 40\u201350 Hz) were selected a priori in light of our previous results (<a href=\"#bib29\">Sweeney-Reed et al., 2014</a>). During successful encoding, the correlation between early frontal theta/alpha phase alignment and CFC was significant (r = 0.84, p = 0.019; false discovery rate (FDR) corrected p-value = 0.02 with a maximum FDR level of q = 0.05, to account for the calculation of multiple correlations). No significant correlation was observed during unsuccessful encoding, nor was there a correlation with early RATN or late frontal theta phase alignment during either successful or unsuccessful encoding (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B\u2013F</a>). The correlation was significant, however, between late RATN theta phase alignment and CFC applying the same frequency cut-offs (r = 0.78, p = 0.039). With a maximum FDR level of q = 0.1, the FDR-adjusted p-value was 0.04. These correlations were then directly compared between successful and unsuccessful encoding by calculating a z-score using the Fisher z-transform for each correlation coefficient and comparing the difference, corrected for sample size, to the unit normal distribution; correlation was significantly greater during successful encoding (criterion p &lt; 0.05). Finally, we identified a broadband (4\u201320 Hz) early poststimulus RATN phase alignment, but unlike later RATN theta phase alignment, neither it nor the event-related potentials (ERPs) differed significantly between successful and unsuccessful encoding (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

Here we explore the mechanism by which the RATN modulates memory formation. Theta phase alignment is likely to promote memory-related synaptic plasticity for two reasons. Firstly, phase alignment is deemed a pre-requisite for the synaptic plasticity underlying memory encoding, and secondly, the theta rhythm dominates in the hippocampus, a key structure involved in memory (<a href=\"#bib5\">Buzs\u00e1ki, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Fell et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Lega et al., 2012</a>), with animal studies indicating that hippocampal theta phase influences encoding success (<a href=\"#bib14\">Hasselmo, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Siegle and Wilson, 2014</a>). We interpret our findings of greater RATN theta phase alignment during successful than unsuccessful memory formation, and its correlation with CFC during successful encoding, as compatible with the suggestion that memory-related changes occur within the RATN itself. The phase alignment in the theta rhythm provides the timing necessary for local synaptic modification and is further reflected in gamma oscillations, thought to reflect local information processing (<a href=\"#bib15\">Jensen et al., 2007</a>)."

Indeed the early RATN phase alignment likely reflects the N1 component of the visual evoked response, which is related to memory performance (<a href=\"#bib17\">Klimesch et al., 2004</a>). The similarity between the phase alignment identified here in the RATN and that detected in the rhinal cortex and hippocampus suggests the early phase alignment observed here was also a memory-task-related phenomenon, which is plausible given that a preceding practice session meant our task involved intentional encoding (<a href=\"#bib29\">Sweeney-Reed et al., 2014</a>).

We postulate that RATN theta oscillations are involved in two separate processes: modulation of frontal-RATN theta oscillations through long-range synchrony and modulation of RATN gamma oscillations through CFC. This suggests an integrative role for the RATN, in accord with the diverse inputs received by this nucleus. Granger causality calculation was consistent with frontal activity driving the theta phase synchrony with RATN activity (<a href=\"#bib29\">Sweeney-Reed et al., 2014</a>). We postulate that the correlation between frontal theta phase alignment, which was independent of encoding success, and frontal-RATN theta phase synchrony occurred because frontal theta phase alignment facilitates the phase synchrony. The narrow time window indicated by early frontal theta phase alignment is consistent with an early, rapid perceptual response, and the correlation with the phase synchrony suggests both measures reflect the same process. The correlation between early frontal theta phase alignment and later intra-RATN CFC is consistent with the requirement of early stimulus processing for successful later memory formation processes. We interpret the frontal and RATN phase alignments, which were not correlated with each other, as reflecting different contributions to memory formation. This interpretation is further supported by the finding that frontal phase alignment was correlated with phase synchrony, whereas the RATN phase alignment was correlated with CFC."

The reported data were taken from the most frontal available electrode from each participant as previously reported (<a href=\"#bib29\">Sweeney-Reed et al., 2014</a>). The electrophysiological data were recorded during presentation of a series of photographic scenes, which were judged as indoors or outdoors. Each scene was labeled as successfully or unsuccessfully encoded on the basis of a subsequent recognition test, in which the scenes were presented again, mixed with new scenes, and judged as \u2018old\u2019 or \u2018new\u2019. The thalamic data were re-referenced offline by subtracting the deeper neighbor rendering a bipolar reference.

For each time-frequency point, alignment of phase to stimulus onset was calculated across epochs for each participant. The phase alignment index (0 = no phase alignment; 1 = complete phase alignment), was obtained by dividing the length of the unit phase vector across epochs for each participant by the number of epochs (<a href=\"#bib8\">D\u00fczel et al., 2005</a>).

Due to high dependency between adjacent time-frequency points in the phase alignment analysis, a Bonferroni correction was deemed overly conservative. We therefore examined significance using a cluster-size permutation test, whereby the cluster-sizes of adjacent time-frequency points significant on T-tests were compared with a distribution of cluster-sizes arising by chance (<a href=\"#bib20\">Maris and Oostenveld, 2007</a>), analogously to the synchrony analyses (<a href=\"#bib29\">Sweeney-Reed et al., 2014</a>). Phase alignment values across successful and unsuccessful encoding were pooled and assigned to two artificial conditions 1000 times, and T-tests were applied each time comparing the two scrambled conditions. Adjacent time-frequency points where p &lt; 0.05 were summed providing a value for the largest cluster in each iteration, yielding a two-sided distribution, against which to compare the cluster-size of significant p-values comparing successful with unsuccessful encoding."

Because coupling between theta and gamma oscillations differed according to encoding success, we hypothesized that phase alignment, which accompanies synaptic modification, would be correlated with this coupling. Although we could have justified theory-based focus on phase alignment in the theta frequency range, we included frequencies ranging from theta to gamma, performing the cluster-size permutation test described above. We carried out FDR correction to account for the calculation of multiple correlations (<a href=\"#bib4\">Benjamini and Hochberg, 2009</a>)."

Here, increased memory-related inter-trial theta phase alignment of frontal and anterior thalamic activity is demonstrated. Furthermore, positive interindividual correlations between early frontal phase alignment, as well as late anterior thalamic phase-alignment with anterior thalamic theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling are reported. This article is based on a precious data set, i.e. intracranial thalamic recordings in epilepsy patients performing a subsequent memory paradigm. The analysis techniques are timely and the reported results are important and represent a significant advance and supplement to the previous paper."
