Accurate quantitative definition of their intrinsic DNA binding preferences is critical to understanding their biological function. High-throughput in vitro technology has recently been used to deeply probe the DNA binding specificity of hundreds of eukaryotic transcription factors, yet algorithms for analyzing such data have not yet fully matured. Here, we present a general framework (FeatureREDUCE) for building sequence-to-affinity models based on a biophysically interpretable and extensible model of protein-DNA interaction that can account for dependencies between nucleotides within the binding interface or multiple modes of binding. When training on protein binding microarray (PBM) data, we use robust regression and modeling of technology-specific biases to infer specificity models of unprecedented accuracy and precision. We provide quantitative validation of our results by comparing to gold-standard data when available."

Accurate quantitative definition of their intrinsic DNA binding preferences is critical to understanding their biological function. High-throughput in vitro technology has recently been used to deeply probe the DNA binding specificity of hundreds of eukaryotic transcription factors, yet algorithms for analyzing such data have not yet fully matured. Here, we present a general framework (FeatureREDUCE) for building sequence-to-affinity models based on a biophysically interpretable and extensible model of protein-DNA interaction that can account for dependencies between nucleotides within the binding interface or multiple modes of binding. When training on protein binding microarray (PBM) data, we use robust regression and modeling of technology-specific biases to infer specificity models of unprecedented accuracy and precision. We provide quantitative validation of our results by comparing to gold-standard data when available."

In theory, as long as thermodynamic equilibrium can be assumed, sequence specificity is completely defined by a table containing the (relative) affinity with which the DBD binds to each possible oligonucleotide within the footprint. This tabular approach has been widely used to analyze Protein Binding Microarray (PBM) data (<a href=\"#bib9\">Berger and Bulyk, 2009</a>). It comes with significant challenges, however. First, the size of the oligomer table grows exponentially with footprint size, which in practice limits it to eight base pairs, shorter than the footprint of most TFs. Even for octamer tables, the number of affinity parameters to be estimated is on the same order as the number of PBM data points. This limits precision and necessitates the use of non-parametric methods (as opposed to parameterized biophysical methods), resulting in an associated loss of quantitative information."

The most commonly used representation of sequence specificity that makes this independence assumption is the position weight matrix (PWM) (<a href=\"#bib6\">Berg and von Hippel, 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Stormo and Fields, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Stormo, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Djordjevic et al., 2003</a>), which defines position-specific base frequencies. Algorithms for inferring the PWM coefficients traditionally aim to maximize its information content relative to a random background model (<a href=\"#bib22\">Lawrence et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Frech et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Bailey, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Roth et al., 1998</a>). In an alternative approach, sequence specificity is represented in terms of the relative affinity (or, equivalently, the difference, \u25b3\u25b3<i>G</i>, in binding free energy) associated with each possible point mutation of the optimal sequence (<a href=\"#bib34\">Stormo and Yoshioka, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Stormo et al., 1993</a>), and summarized in the form of a position-specific affinity matrix (PSAM) (<a href=\"#bib13\">Foat et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Bussemaker et al., 2007</a>). The difference in philosophy between the PWM and PSAM representations also leads to a different approach to estimating their coefficients. It is no longer the information content (i.e. the height of the letters in the standard sequence logo) that is being optimized, but rather the ability of the PSAM to quantitatively explain the variation in a measurable quantity in terms of variation in the nucleotide sequence associated with each quantity (for instance, the expression level of a gene in terms of its upstream promoter sequence). In the case of PBM data, the PSAM parameters are inferred by performing a nonlinear fit of a sequence-based model that predicts the signal intensity for each probe. The first implementations of this idea were the <i>MatrixREDUCE</i> (<a href=\"#bib13\">Foat et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Foat et al., 2005</a>) and <i>PREGO</i> (<a href=\"#bib38\">Tanay, 2006</a>) algorithms; a more recent extension is <i>BEEML-PBM</i> (<a href=\"#bib45\">Zhao and Stormo, 2011</a>)."

This may preclude accurate model estimation unless it is dealt with explicitly. Moreover, whenever the TF binds near the free end of a probe, loss of contacts with the DNA backbone can reduce binding affinity. <i>FeatureREDUCE</i> captures such spatial bias by introducing an independent multiplicative correction factor for the ratio [TF]/K<sub>d</sub> at each offset within the probe (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a</a>). These coefficients are estimated from the PBM intensities in parallel with the \u25b3\u25b3<i>G</i> parameters (see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods). The positional bias profile inferred by <i>FeatureREDUCE</i> for the homo-dimer Cbf1p is shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2b</a>. It indicates that the magnitude of the contribution of an individual binding site to the PBM intensity can vary by an order of magnitude depending on its offset within the probe, and that there is preference for Cbf1p binding away from the substrate. For Pho4p, binding near the free end of the probe shows an opposite trend (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The fraction of the variance (R<sup>2</sup>) in PBM intensity explained by a 10-bp independent-nucleotide model increases dramatically, from 48% to 71%, after accounting for the positional bias. <i>FeatureREDUCE</i> can also detect any preference for monomeric TFs to bind in one of the two possible orientations on the dsDNA probes. For example, Zif268 exhibits a strong bias for binding to the negative strand over the positive strand (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2c</a>). Indeed, it is known that Zif268 requires non-specific contacts with the DNA backbone on the 5'-end of the motif (<a href=\"#bib7\">Berger et al., 2006</a>). <i>BEEML-PBM</i> (<a href=\"#bib45\">Zhao and Stormo, 2011</a>) also models positional biases along the probes, but it does not account for orientation preference, or for overhang binding at the free end of the probe."

To demonstrate this, we compared our results to measurements of binding affinity for Cbf1p obtained using the orginal version of the MITOMI technology (<a href=\"#bib25\">Maerkl and Quake, 2007</a>), which are in excellent (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.95) agreement with similar measurements obtained using surface plasmon resonance (<a href=\"#bib7\">Berger et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Teh et al., 2007</a>). We used these 'gold-standard' binding affinity measurements to assess the quality of the sequence-to-affinity models inferred from PBM data by <i>FeatureREDUCE</i>. When we fit a position-specific affinity matrix (PSAM) based model that ignores dependencies between nucleotides, the root-mean-square error (RMSE) between <i>FeatureREDUCE</i> model predictions and gold-standard MITOMI 1.0 measurements improved from 0.071 to 0.035 when standard least-squares fitting was replaced by robust iteratively re-weighted least-squares (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, left panels). When positional dependencies were added to the model (feature-specific affinity model; FSAM), it actually performed worse than the model assuming independence between nucleotides (position-specific affinity matrix; PSAM) when we used <i>standard</i> least-squares fitting, indicative of over-fitting to noise in the training data. When we used <i>robust</i> regression, however, the RMSE for the FSAM-based model was significantly better than for the PSAM-based model (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, right panels). These results indicate that dependencies within the binding interface indeed exist, and that they can be modeled incorrectly when non-robust regression techniques are used."

Oligomeric TF complexes can often bind DNA using different relative orientations of and/or spacing between their subunits (<a href=\"#bib16\">Gord\u00e2n et al., 2011</a>). The modeling framework employed by <i>FeatureREDUCE</i> provides a natural opportunity to perform forward selection of multiple binding modes, represented by distinct PSAMs, which can subsequently be combined into a single predictive model and refined in an iterative manner (see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods). We applied this procedure for the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) proteins Yap1p and Gcn4p. <i>FeatureREDUCE</i> accurately captures the known intrinsic differences in half-site preference of Yap1p (which prefers TTAC, typical for the C/EBP subfamily (<a href=\"#bib42\">Warren et al., 2012</a>); <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5a</a>) and Gcn4p (which prefers TGAC, typical for the CREB subfamily; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5b</a>). It is well known that each protein, when binding DNA as a homo-dimer, can do so with or without a 1-bp overlap between the half-sites. What is unique about our approach is that the multi-PSAM model captures fold-differences in thermodynamic stability between the binding modes by estimating an overall relative affinity coefficient for the secondary PSAM. For instance, the binding affinity of Gcn4p for TGACGTCA is predicted to be 24% of that of TGASTCA (cf. <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5b</a>). This is in good agreement with recent high-throughput measurements of Gcn4 binding constants for all 12-mers using HiTS-FLIP (<a href=\"#bib27\">Nutiu et al., 2011</a>), specifically, <i>K</i><sub>d</sub> = 65 <i>nM</i> and 15 <i>nM</i> for the respective sequences. In addition, while the accuracy of the dominant TGASTCA motif essentially does not change, the accuracy of the weaker TGACGTCA motif increases significantly when using our multi-PSAM model compared to the single-fit model (R<sup>2</sup> improved from 69% to 80% for sites with relative affinity &gt; 0.1). We note that the results of our analysis can be used in a straightforward manner to predict which binding mode is dominant for a particular DNA sequence."

At a given position, exactly one of a set of 4 single-nucleotide features (A, C, G, or T) will be present in any particular sequence. We refer to such a set of mutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive features as a 'block'. Each sequence has exactly one feature from each block. A binding window of length <i>L</i> contains <i>L</i> mononucleotide blocks. There is a one-to-one correspondence between the (exponentiated)\u00a0\u2206\u2206<i>G<sub>\u03c6</sub>/RT</i> values in a mononucleotide block and a column in a position-specific affinity matrix (PSAM). Together, the dinucleotide features constitute\u00a0<i>L\u00a0</i>\u2212\u00a01 dinucleotide blocks, each consisting of 16 features. Within each block, the 4 or 16\u00a0\u2206\u2206<i>G<sub>\u03c6</sub></i> values are only defined up to a common additive constant. The convention we use for mononucleotide blocks is that\u00a0\u2206\u2206<i>G<sub>\u03c6</sub>\u00a0=\u00a00</i> for the feature that occurs in the reference sequence. For dinucleotide blocks, however, we use a different convention intended to minimize the number of\u00a0\u2206\u2206<i>G<sub>\u03c6</sub></i> values that are significantly different from zero (see below for details)."

This procedure down-weights data points that have high residuals compared to the fitted model. However, the weights depend on the residuals and the residuals depend on the weights. This dependency is broken by first choosing uniform initial weights, then iteratively refitting the model and re-calculating new residuals and weights, until convergence. IRLS prevents over-fitting and thereby allows for improved parameter estimation. FeatureREDUCE uses the 'rlm' function in the MASS package for R to perform the robust regression. We set the trimmed probes hyperparameter to 20%, as we previously found this value to be optimal during cross-validation on the DREAM5 dataset (<a href=\"#bib43\">Weirauch, 2013</a>). Repeated rounds of parameter re-estimation that cycle over feature 'blocks' are performed until convergence, first for mononucleotide blocks (resulting in a converged PSAM), and subsequently for dinucleotide blocks.

Similarly, the differences in RMSE in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> are not convincing me that the model is substantially different or better. First of all, ChIP signal (enrichment over background) is often not a reliable quantitative signal. Second, it is unclear how differences in low affinity sequences change actual predictions made with these models. I would expect an evaluation to provide the reader with a sense as to when the precise details do matter.

The GO analysis admittedly is indirect, but it is an attempt to use the affinity model to predict target genes solely from promoter sequence. This analysis was inspired by a similar one performed by Maerkl &amp; Quake (2007) to validate their MITOMI 1.0 assay. Our affinity model is used to predict the affinity landscape across the entire upstream promoter region of each gene, integrating high and low affinity sites. As such, it puts strong demands on the affinity model. Nevertheless, not only do we find that genes in GO categories consistent with the known function of the TF tend to be associated with higher promoter affinities (and thus presumably more responsive to changes in the activity of the TF), but also that the trends regarding the benefits of robust regression and dinucleotides are in the same direction as when we validate more directly against in vitroMITOMI 1.0 data for the same TF (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

For single-nucleotide features we use a standard normalization where ddG=0 for features in the optimal reference sequence. However, as we explain in detail in the revised Methods section, the normalization we use for dinucleotide features is quite different, hence the confusion on the part of the reviewer. We have also updated <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a> to make everything completely consistent with expectation: a newly added non-zero ddG value associated with the PSAM in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a> now makes the sum over all features associated with the reference sequence equal to zero as expected. We are grateful to the reviewer for insisting on this point."
