This reduces the efficacy of control strategies, but focusing control strategies on clusters or \u2018hotspots\u2019 of transmission may be highly effective. Among 1500 homesteads in coastal Kenya we calculated (a) the fraction of febrile children with positive malaria smears per homestead, and (b) the mean age of children with malaria per homestead. These two measures were inversely correlated, indicating that children in homesteads at higher transmission acquire immunity more rapidly. This inverse correlation increased gradually with increasing spatial scale of analysis, and hotspots of febrile malaria were identified at every scale. We found hotspots within hotspots, down to the level of an individual homestead. Febrile malaria hotspots were temporally unstable, but 4 km radius hotspots could be targeted for 1 month following 1 month periods of surveillance."

This reduces the efficacy of control strategies, but focusing control strategies on clusters or \u2018hotspots\u2019 of transmission may be highly effective. Among 1500 homesteads in coastal Kenya we calculated (a) the fraction of febrile children with positive malaria smears per homestead, and (b) the mean age of children with malaria per homestead. These two measures were inversely correlated, indicating that children in homesteads at higher transmission acquire immunity more rapidly. This inverse correlation increased gradually with increasing spatial scale of analysis, and hotspots of febrile malaria were identified at every scale. We found hotspots within hotspots, down to the level of an individual homestead. Febrile malaria hotspots were temporally unstable, but 4 km radius hotspots could be targeted for 1 month following 1 month periods of surveillance."

The parasite that causes the disease is transmitted to humans by bites from infected mosquitoes, and the complicated lifecycle of the parasite makes developing vaccines difficult. However, preventive strategies are effective at reducing the spread of malaria. The two most widely used and effective strategies are the use of pesticide-treated bed nets to create a barrier between sleeping families and biting mosquitoes, and indoor residual spraying to reduce the numbers of mosquitoes biting sleeping families in homesteads. Other potential preventive strategies include killing mosquito larvae in breeding sites and mass anti-malarial drug treatment for infected humans."

Over this period, 54% of children who went to health clinics with a fever tested positive for the parasite that causes malaria. Infected children from areas with the highest rate of malaria infection were, on average, younger than those from less infected regions. This makes sense as in highly affected areas children have a greater chance of encountering the parasite at an early age. They are therefore more likely to get malaria when younger and, as exposure to the parasite can provide some immunity to a child, they are also less likely to get infected again when older."

Bejon et al. could see hotspots within hotspots, and in some cases could go as far as identifying the individual homesteads most at risk of malaria. Public health workers could potentially use these analyses to identify areas that are likely to be hotspots and then target preventive measures there for the next month. However, the constantly changing locations of the hotspots means workers would have to reanalyse the data and retarget their interventions at the end of each month."

Malaria transmission is determined by mosquito ecology and behavior, which is in turn determined by rainfall, hydrology, soils, human behavior and population distributions, and a range of other social, biotic and abiotic factors. Heterogeneity of malaria transmission is apparent at global scale (<a href=\"#bib13\">Gething et al., 2011</a>), regional scale (<a href=\"#bib17\">Kleinschmidt et al., 2001a</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Noor et al., 2009</a>), and at fine scale in, for instance, Mali (<a href=\"#bib11\">Gaudart et al., 2006</a>), Ghana (<a href=\"#bib19\">Kreuels et al., 2008</a>), Ethiopia (<a href=\"#bib42\">Yeshiwondim et al., 2009</a>) Kenya (<a href=\"#bib4\">Brooker et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Ernst et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Bejon et al., 2010</a>), and Tanzania (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bousema et al., 2010</a>). This spatial heterogeneity makes transmission relatively resilient to indiscriminate control efforts, but also provides an opportunity to engage in targeted malaria control on clusters of transmission (or \u2018hotspots\u2019), a strategy that is predicted to be highly effective (<a href=\"#bib8\">Dye and Hasibeder 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Woolhouse et al., 1997</a>)."

Passive surveillance is more readily scaled up, but may be biased by variations in access to health care facilities and socially-determined health-seeking behavior (<a href=\"#bib40\">Sumba et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Franckel and Lalou 2009</a>). The incidence of febrile malaria presenting to health care is thus biased by access to care. This bias may be countered by using the malaria positive fraction (MPF) among children with fever (also termed \u2018slide positivity rate\u2019 in some publications [<a href=\"#bib16\">Jensen et al., 2009</a>]). The MPF includes all febrile children presenting to the dispensary as the denominator, hence controlling for access to health care, in contrast to incidence for which all children in the community are included in the denominator. The MPF is less likely to show systematic spatial bias with distance from the health facility since parental accounts of illness have not been found to discriminate malaria from non-malarial fever (<a href=\"#bib24\">Luxemburger et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Mwangi et al., 2005</a>), and diagnostic testing is not available outside the dispensary."

This suggests that greater exposure to malaria (i.e., high MPF) leads to more rapid acquisition of immunity as children grow up, hence predominantly younger children visiting the dispensary with febrile malaria. There was no evidence that this relationship was confounded by spatial clustering of age: the average age of children with non-malarial fever did not show spatial clustering (Moran's I = 0.01, p=0.5 within 1 km and Moran's I = 0.02, p=0.5 within 5 km) and was not associated with MPF (r<sub>s</sub> = \u22120.02, p=0.4). We examined the effect of spatial scale at which this correlation occurred by imposing grids of increasing cell size on the study area, calculating r<sub>s</sub> within each cell of the grid, and then estimating the mean r<sub>s</sub> at each scale of grid (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, blue lines). The mean r<sub>s</sub> trended gradually away from 0 as the grid divisions became larger in scale. This pattern suggests gradual differentiation in transmission characteristics as the distance between homesteads included within a cell of the grid increases. We then examined the patterns seen on applying this analysis to simulated data. In order to exclude that this trend was a result of cells at fine-scale containing fewer homesteads, we ran permutations of the data using after randomly re-assigning spatial coordinates to the homesteads. These permutations show that a consistent correlation at r<sub>s</sub> = \u22120.16 throughout the range of grid sizes, albeit with greater uncertainty with smaller cell size (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, red lines). Hence, the trend of a gradually increasing inverse correlation as the grid size increases does not appear to be explained simply by having fewer homesteads in each cell at fine scale. In order to determine the pattern that might be seen with specific spatial scales of clustering, we conducted further simulations by imposed patterns with specific scales on the spatial coordinates of the homesteads, in varying proportions with random noise using a gamma distribution. These simulations show that a specific scale of clustering produces \u2018spikes\u2019 in r<sub>s</sub> as the cell size varies, with the position of the spike coinciding with scale of the clustering (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Reducing the Signal:Noise ratio eventually obscured the \u2018spikes\u2019 due to a characteristic pattern, but only at the point where the overall correlation was no longer discernible (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Adding a gradient to the simulated characteristic scale attenuated but did not obscure the \u2018spikes\u2019 (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>)."

Infant parasite rates have been proposed as a measure of transmission intensity that minimizes the offsetting of acquired immunity in macro-epidemiological studies (<a href=\"#bib38\">Snow et al., 1996</a>). We therefore hypothesized that the malaria positive fractions in children &lt;1 year of age (hereafter \u2018MPF<sub>&lt;1yr</sub>\u2019) would measure transmission intensity without the offsetting of acquired immunity, and that unstable transmission would result in higher risk of malaria in older children.

The regression coefficient was \u223c0.4 for 1\u20132 year olds, meaning that each unit increase in MPF<sub>&lt;1yr</sub> is associated with a 0.4 increase in the MPF for 1- to 2-year-old children.

We found that children using ITNs had a reduced risk of malaria by logistic regression (i.e., OR = 0.69, 95%CI 0.67 to 0.8, p&lt;0.001), in keeping with previous literature on the personal protection provided by ITN use (<a href=\"#bib21\">Lim et al., 2011</a>). On the other hand, we did not identify significant evidence that ITN use was clustered spatially (Moran's I = 0.02, p=0.5). Furthermore, adding ITN use as a covariate in SaTScan analysis to locate hotspots had little effect on results; the addition of ITN use as a covariate changed the location of the hotspot by 120 m, and changed the predicted radius of the hotspot from 5.4 km to 5.2 km. On re-analysis of the homesteads within the 5.4 km hotspot, a further 0.87 km hotspot was identified the position and radius of which were not altered by the inclusion of ITN use as a covariate. Finally, within this 0.87 km hotspot the same 7 homesteads were identified as a hotspot irrespective of the inclusion of ITN use as a covariate. We did not identify significant evidence that ITN use correlated mean MPF<sub>&lt;1yr</sub> (r<sub>s</sub> = \u22120.04, p=0.04) or with the variance in MPF<sub>&lt;1yr</sub> (r<sub>s</sub> = \u22120.01, p=0.7). Hence, ITNs provided personal protection from malaria, but we were unable to show that they explained the spatial micro-epidemiological patterns."

The strongly significant inverse correlation between the malaria positive fraction (MPF) and average age of children presenting with malaria suggests variable acquisition of immunity between homesteads. Homesteads at high transmission intensity have a high MPF and a young average age of malaria (with older children becoming immune and therefore not presenting to the dispensary) whereas homesteads at low transmission intensity have a low MPF but an older average age of malaria since older children are not becoming immune as rapidly. In theory, this inverse correlation might have arisen because of heterogeneity at various spatial scales. For instance, there might have been a block of homesteads all at high transmission in one half of the study area (thus with high MPF and low average age) and a second block of homesteads at low transmission in the other half (with low MPF and high average age). On the other hand, the inverse correlation might have arisen because of a random distribution of \u2018high\u2019 and \u2018low\u2019 transmission intensity homesteads throughout the study area."

This analysis was done to identify the most influential geographical scale at which the inverse correlation was observed. In simulated data, we noted \u2018spikes\u2019 where the inverse correlation was abruptly lost when the size of cells in the grid coincides with the size of the geographical \u2018blocks\u2019 of homesteads that drove the inverse correlation, as seen in <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>. Similar spikes were seen after adding simulated noise and gradients in space over which the correlation varied (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplements 1, 2 and 3</a>). Real-world data would contain more complex sources of variation than we have simulated, and hence may not produce distinct spikes. Nevertheless, the analysis of these simulations suggests that discontinuities in the correlation between MPF and average age of malaria over cell size might be expected when clustering is at a specific spatial scale. In fact there was no such discontinuity in the function shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, indicating that the inverse correlation was present at every geographical scale examined within our study. It is likely that this pattern would extend at greater geographical scales, since a similar inverse correlation between the age distributions of malaria cases and transmission intensity can be seen on comparing countries and regions (<a href=\"#bib31\">Okiro et al., 2009</a>)."

Our data showing clustering at varying spatial scales suggest that malaria control programs can expect to identify hotspots at many different geographical scales. We demonstrate that hotspots occur within hotspots, down to the level of a single homestead, and also that hotspots can be identified on \u2018zooming in\u2019 on random areas outside the main hotspot (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). These hotspots were based on analysis of a large dataset with adequate power, and were strongly significant based on the multiple permutations run in SaTScan, suggesting that type I statistical error is an unlikely explanation for our findings. The complexity of presenting \u2018hotspots within hotspots\u2019 to a malaria control programme is further compounded by the temporal instability of the spatial pattern (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>)."

We found that using data aggregated over 1 month of surveillance to define 4 to 8 km diameter hotspots would provide greatest accuracy, but this information is only relevant for 1 month before temporal instability necessitates further surveillance. One might therefore consider a continuous programme of parallel surveillance and targeting, where the surveillance data are examined at the end of each month to determine the location to be targeted for the following month. Continuous surveillance would allow adaptive targeting of hotspots for the following month. Such a strategy might be employed all year round, or for a limited period of the year depending on local seasonality. (<a href=\"#bib5\">Cairns et al., 2012</a>) Targeting at this spatial scale has the added practical advantage that it could be done with village-level location data and would not require fine-scale geo-positional data."

We have previously demonstrated that spatial heterogeneity is more temporally stable when analysed for asymptomatic parasitaemia rather than febrile malaria (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bejon et al., 2010</a>).

Our data suggests that the environmental factors determining malaria transmission operate at a range of spatial scales. We might speculate that mosquito breeding site density could be equally influenced by proximity to a large geographical feature such as a river, or to a micro-geographical feature such as a cow hoof-print (<a href=\"#bib35\">Sattler et al., 2005</a>). Hence ecological models of malaria transmission will need to include data at a range of spatial scales in order to accurately predict malaria risk."

The software is freely available and can be downloaded from <a href=\"http://www.satscan.org/\">www.satscan.org</a>. The version used in this analysis was downloaded in November 2012, as v9.1 for a 64-bit system. The spatial scan statistic uses a scanning window that moves across space. The scanning windows are circles centred on each homestead, with a radius varied from inclusion of only the single homestead it is centred on through to 30% of the population size. When using the Bernoulli model, the software calculates the fraction of cases/controls inside vs outside the each possible scanning window, and selects the window giving the highest probability of a case within the scanning window compared with the probability of a case outside the window. In our application of the Bernoulli model, cases were febrile children with parasitaemia and controls were febrile children without parasitaemia. The test of significance needs to take into account the whole process of selecting the optimal window rather than simply the comparison of inside vs outside the optimal window. This is achieved by running random permutations of the case/control data over the spatial co-ordinates of homesteads and determining the log-likelihood statistic for the model fit by the optimal window for each random permutation. The log-likelihood statistic for the real data is then compared with the statistics on the random permutations to derive a p value. We used 9999 replications in our study. The maximum hotspot size was set at 30% of the population, and the inference level for significance was set at 0.05. The main analysis was done without adjustment for covariates, and a secondary analysis was conducted for the 2009/2010 data with and without ITN use as a covariate.

We normalized age of febrile malaria for age of children with non-malarial fever by calculating the absolute difference between the two and found that there was still a negative correlation with MPF (r<sub>s</sub>=-0.08, p=0.011). However, the correlation is not as strong as that seen without normalization (r<sub>s</sub>) =-0.16, p&lt;0.0001), partly because the normalization requires data in each homestead to calculate average age for children with and without malaria and therefore observations are dropped (i.e. \u223c1,200 of \u223c1,500 homesteads), and partly because normalizing according to the average age of non-malarial fever likely adds noise to the statistic. We therefore include the former results in the manuscript as reassurance that the studied relationship between MPF and average age of febrile malaria is unlikely to be confounded by spatial variation in average age of children in the community, but prefer to retain the use of average age of febrile malaria as our metric for the more detailed analysis according to spatial scale presented in the main body of the paper.

Nevertheless, regarding the general point raised there is a previous literature that we now reference. Malaria transmission has been shown to vary by geographical features such as altitude (Reyburn et al), cultivation practices (Lindsay et al), streams and dams (Ghebreyesus et al). Ecological models have been developed using frequentist techniques (Omumbo et al), Bayesian approaches (Craig et al) and fuzzy logic (Snow et al). However, the same ecological factor may act inconsistently in different geographical areas (Gemperli et al, Noor et al, Kleinschmidt et al). Hence although there is obvious scope for analysis of our data in relation to geographical features, we believe this would be an appropriate topic for a further publication rather than an additional analysis to include here. On the other hand, there are some general points that we add to the discussion in response."

It therefore follows that in order to develop a model based on geographical features one would either need to identify a key feature that can be mapped on multiple geographical scales, or a combination of geographical features that can exist across multiple scales. For instance, we note a river in the Eastern part of the study area running North to South, and the main hotspot is associated with this river (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a</a>). However, the hotspot is associated with the Southern part but not the Northern part of the river, for reasons that are unclear to us. Furthermore, within the main hotspot there is further variation in risk (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2b</a>) that does not appear to depend on distance from the river, but is located at a particular location along the river, with lower risk at other points along the river. Hence we reason that it is unlikely that any single geographical feature predicts a substantial portion of the variation in malaria risk, and any attempt to develop a geographical model needs to take into account the fractal pattern of spatial clustering. We summarize these considerations in a revised version of our final paragraph in the Discussion."

We have shown in previous analysis of parasite densities from children presenting to the dispensary compared with parasite densities from cross-sectional surveys in the community that the malaria attributable fractions are substantial even among children without measured fever attending the dispensary (i.e. 40% (95%CI 39-41%), compared with 75% (95%CI 74-76%) Olotu et al 2011, \u201cDefining Clinical Malaria: The Specificity and Incidence of Endpoints from Active and Passive Surveillance of Children in Rural Kenya\u201d)."
