We investigated the role of visual (V1), posterior parietal (PPC), and frontal motor (fMC) cortices for sensorimotor mapping in mice during performance of a memory-guided visual discrimination task. Large-scale calcium imaging revealed that V1, PPC, and fMC neurons exhibited heterogeneous responses spanning all task epochs (stimulus, delay, response). Population analyses demonstrated unique encoding of stimulus identity and behavioral choice information across regions, with V1 encoding stimulus, fMC encoding choice even early in the trial, and PPC multiplexing the two variables. Optogenetic inhibition during behavior revealed that all regions were necessary during the stimulus epoch, but only fMC was required during the delay and response epochs. Stimulus identity can thus be rapidly transformed into behavioral choice, requiring V1, PPC, and fMC during the transformation period, but only fMC for maintaining the choice in memory prior to execution."

We investigated the role of visual (V1), posterior parietal (PPC), and frontal motor (fMC) cortices for sensorimotor mapping in mice during performance of a memory-guided visual discrimination task. Large-scale calcium imaging revealed that V1, PPC, and fMC neurons exhibited heterogeneous responses spanning all task epochs (stimulus, delay, response). Population analyses demonstrated unique encoding of stimulus identity and behavioral choice information across regions, with V1 encoding stimulus, fMC encoding choice even early in the trial, and PPC multiplexing the two variables. Optogenetic inhibition during behavior revealed that all regions were necessary during the stimulus epoch, but only fMC was required during the delay and response epochs. Stimulus identity can thus be rapidly transformed into behavioral choice, requiring V1, PPC, and fMC during the transformation period, but only fMC for maintaining the choice in memory prior to execution."

Simple sensorimotor transformations, such as the patellar reflex, can be mediated by simple neural circuits within the peripheral nervous system. However, more sophisticated sensorimotor decisions, like using a traffic signal to guide future driving maneuvers, often requires mapping specific sensory features to motor actions at a later time, and are thought to require more complex neural circuits extending into the cerebral cortex (<a href=\"#bib33\">Gold and Shadlen, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Andersen and Cui, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Romo and de Lafuente, 2013</a>)."

However, despite the wealth of research in this area, there are a number of unresolved questions. First, it is unclear which regions are responsible for sensorimotor transformation. For example, single-unit electrophysiological recordings (<a href=\"#bib71\">Shadlen and Newsome, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Freedman and Assad, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Gold and Shadlen, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Andersen and Cui, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Bennur and Gold, 2011</a>) and pharmacological inactivation (<a href=\"#bib47\">Li et al., 1999</a>; but see <a href=\"#bib15\">Chafee and Goldman-Rakic, 2000</a>) studies in non-human primates have implicated posterior parietal cortex (PPC) in the\u00a0mapping sensory input to appropriate motor responses. However, recent rat auditory (<a href=\"#bib23\">Erlich et al., 2015</a>) and mouse whisker (<a href=\"#bib35\">Guo et al., 2013</a>) studies have challenged this view, finding no role for PPC in memory-guided sensorimotor decisions. Rather, a number of studies suggest that cortical (<a href=\"#bib35\">Guo et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Murakami et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Zagha et al., 2015</a>) and subcortical (<a href=\"#bib81\">Znamenskiy and Zador, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Kopec et al., 2015</a>) motor regions might be the key site for sensorimotor transformation. In contrast, PPC does appear to be necessary for visual sensorimotor decision tasks in mice (<a href=\"#bib38\">Harvey et al., 2012</a>) and rats (<a href=\"#bib65\">Raposo et al., 2014</a>); though the proximity of PPC to secondary visual regions makes it difficult to clearly isolate the effect of PPC inactivation (see discussion in <a href=\"#bib23\">Erlich et al., 2015</a>). There are several possibilities for the discrepancies seen in the previous studies, including differences in species, sensory modality, and behavioral task. In order to further investigate the locus of sensorimotor transformation, we hoped in this study to take a more comprehensive approach toward measuring and perturbing activity across sensory, parietal association, and motor cortical regions during a delayed-response task."

For decades, researchers have used delayed-response tasks to study the maintenance of information (short-term memory), and have observed the presence of sustained neural activity in distributed cortical and subcortical structures; including the\u00a0prefrontal cortex (<a href=\"#bib28\">Fuster and Alexander, 1971</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Kojima and Goldman-Rakic, 1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Funahashi et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Miller et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Romo et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Sreenivasan et al., 2014</a>), parietal cortex (<a href=\"#bib18\">Constantinidis and Steinmetz, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Snyder et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Chafee and Goldman-Rakic, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Shadlen and Newsome, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Harvey et al., 2012</a>), sensory (<a href=\"#bib56\">Nakamura and Colby, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Super et al., 2001</a>) and motor cortices (<a href=\"#bib20\">di Pellegrino and Wise, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">de Lafuente and Romo, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Hernandez et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Guo et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Erlich et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Li et al., 2015</a>), as well as several subcortical regions (<a href=\"#bib29\">Fuster and Alexander, 1973</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Kawagoe et al., 1998</a>). Building on this work, theoretical studies have yielded biologically-plausible models describing how the\u00a0sustained neural activity can be generated and maintained to support short-term memory (<a href=\"#bib17\">Compte et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Goldman et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Wang, 2008</a>). However, recent studies in rodents have indicated that some of the regions traditionally thought to be crucial for short-term memory maintenance, such as parietal and prefrontal cortices, appear not to play a major role in some tasks (<a href=\"#bib35\">Guo et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Liu et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Erlich et al., 2015</a>), though other studies have found an important role for sustained activity in motor regions consistent with theoretical models (<a href=\"#bib46\">Kopec et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Li et al., 2016</a>). Is the sustained activity observed in parietal and prefrontal cortex epiphenomenal? Or might the difference stem from another aspect of the task (e.g., modality)? We reasoned that we could help resolve this issue by measuring and perturbing activity in distributed cortical regions during a visual delayed-response task."

For example, it is possible that sustained activity seen in one region reflects sustained activity in a connected region without playing a direct role in the maintenance of mnemonic information. Microstimulation studies have revealed that activation of neurons in certain regions is sufficient to influence task performance (<a href=\"#bib9\">Bisley et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Hanks et al., 2006</a>), but does not directly address whether the region is necessary. Other studies have used surgical lesions, pharmacological inactivation or tissue cooling to reveal the cortical regions necessary for performance of short-term memory maintenance in rodents and non-human primates (<a href=\"#bib29\">Fuster and Alexander, 1973</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Bauer and Fuster, 1976</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Sakurai and Sugimoto, 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Li et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Chafee and Goldman-Rakic, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Gisquet-Verrier and Delatour, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Harvey et al., 2012</a>). However, while these studies have been important for establishing the anatomical framework of memory maintenance, these manipulations have limited spatial and temporal resolution. In particular, activity could not be silenced rapidly enough to test specific epochs of the task (e.g., delay period), and it is thus unclear whether a given manipulation affects stimulus perception, memory maintenance, or motor output. Recent optical inactivation approaches have revealed that the effect of cortical inactivation on behavior is crucially dependent on timing (<a href=\"#bib68\">Sachidhanandam et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Kopec et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Li et al., 2016</a>) and whether inactivation is unilateral or bilateral (<a href=\"#bib49\">Li et al., 2016</a>). To continue this approach, we used an optogenetic approach for reversibly silencing activity bilaterally in defined cortical regions with precise temporal control (<a href=\"#bib80\">Zhao et al., 2011</a>). Using inactivation of bilateral cortical regions exhibiting task-related responses, we were able to determine the necessity of sensory, association, and frontal motor cortical regions during each epoch (stimulus, delay, response) of a memory-guided task."

In this task, water-restricted mice were presented a 2\u2009s drifting grating stimulus at one of two orientations (0\u00b0, 90\u00b0 from vertical), followed by a variable delay period (0-, 3-, or 6-s), at which point a lick spout was moved rapidly into reach with a linear actuator for 1.5\u2009s (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, bottom). Licking on \u2018go\u2019 trials (horizontal grating drifting toward 0\u00b0 from vertical) was rewarded with 5\u20138\u2009\u03bcl water (hit), while licking on \u2018no-go\u2019 trials (vertical grating drifting toward 90\u00b0 from vertical) was punished with 2\u2009\u03bcl water containing 5\u00a0mM quinine hydrochloride (false alarm; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, top; <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). This structure allowed the separation of each trial into \u2018stimulus\u2019, \u201cdelay\u201d, and \u2018response\u2019 epochs. Notice that the stimulus-choice association is fixed, so correct performance does not require memory of the stimulus during the delay period (memory of the planned response is sufficient). After extensive training (117 \u00b1 11 behavioral sessions, 299 \u00b1 25 trials per session; mean \u00b1 s.e.m.), mice reliably exhibited strong differences in licking between go and no-go trials (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, top) for all delay period durations. We applied an <i>a priori</i> exclusion criteria that any mice licking continuously throughout the delay period on target trials would be excluded from the study, since this strategy would possibly obviate the short-term memory component of the task. Video analysis showed that mice did not exhibit postural changes or increased movement during the delay period (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>; see <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a> for representative mouse performance). Mice did exhibit a bias toward licking (as observed previously with go/no-go tasks; <a href=\"#bib58\">O'Connor et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Huber et al., 2012</a>), so we quantified their performance using d-prime rather than percent correct to account for motivation and criterion (<a href=\"#bib13\">Carandini and Churchland, 2013</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, bottom). Performance decreased slightly with longer delays, but was well above chance for all delay durations (0\u2009s Delay,\u00a0p&lt;10<sup>\u22129</sup>; 3\u2009s Delay,\u00a0p&lt;10<sup>\u22129</sup>; 6\u2009s Delay,\u00a0p&lt;10<sup>\u22129</sup>; <i>t</i>-test, <i>n</i> = 8 mice across 80 sessions)."

The majority (63%, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, see below for description of classification procedure) of V1 neurons with increased task-evoked activity exhibited robust and reliable responses during the stimulus epoch but not during other epochs of the task, with similar responses across 0, 3, and 6\u2009s delays (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>). However, there was also a sizable fraction (37%) of neurons that exhibited activity during the other task epochs, particularly during the response epoch (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Interestingly, there was an additional fraction (53% of responsive neurons) of neurons that were suppressed throughout the stimulus and delay periods in a delay duration-dependent fashion (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). To our knowledge, neurons exhibiting delay-dependent suppression have not been previously described in V1 despite their prevalence in our sample. To ensure that the suppressed activity pattern was not an artifact of the calcium imaging technique, we carried out single-unit electrophysiological recordings in two mice using silicon probes in V1 during behavior and found a sizable fraction of neurons with suppressed responses during behavior (10/21 single units; see <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

We pooled the significant responses (enhanced and suppressed) from all three areas, and then used PCA-based de-noising and hierarchical clustering to delineate distinct response types (see Materials and methods). Hierarchical clustering revealed six distinct response types, four of them exhibiting enhanced activity and two exhibiting suppressed activity (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). To reveal the archetypical response of each group, we averaged the normalized responses of all neurons within each cluster, revealing four enhanced response classes: stimulus-driven (<i>Stim only</i>), response-driven (<i>Resp only</i>), stimulus- and response-driven (<i>Stim+Resp</i>), and delay-driven (<i>Delay</i>), as well as two suppressed response classes: delay-sensitive stimulus-driven (<i>Supp. Delay early</i>) and delay-sensitive response-driven (<i>Supp. Delay late</i>; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). These clusters have strong face validity, as the average responses (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>) are qualitatively similar to observed single-neuron responses (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>; <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>\u2013<a href=\"#fig3s3\">3</a>). Although neurons that were active during the response epoch were predominantly selective for \u2018go\u2019 trials, there were response-driven neurons that were selective for \u2018no-go\u2019 trials as well (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>\u2013<a href=\"#fig3s3\">3</a>, plots with preferred responses to non-target, \u2018N\u2019, stimulus), suggesting that the response-driven activity is not entirely related to motor activity. There were clear differences in both enhanced and suppressed response types between regions, such as V1 containing a large number of \u2018<i>Stim only</i>\u2019 and \u2018Supp. <i>Delay early</i>\u2019 neurons, while fMC had greater numbers of \u2018<i>Delay</i>\u2019, \u2018<i>Resp only</i>\u2019, and \u2018<i>Supp. Delay late</i>\u2019 neurons (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>).

If this were the case, we would expect that the time course of the suppressed responses would closely follow that of the enhanced responses. We estimated the response latency of the suppressed neurons, and found that the latencies were slow (&gt;400 ms) and uncorrelated to the enhanced population latency in the cortical region (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). We also found that suppressed neurons exhibited a\u00a0suppression throughout the delay period (in a duration-dependent manner; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D,H,L</a>), even when this pattern was not present in the enhanced neurons of the same region (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>).

While V1 neurons preferred go and no-go trials in roughly equal numbers, we found that PPC and fMC neurons were highly biased toward the go trials (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Since the target and non-target stimuli have similar visual saliency, this suggests that these regions may encode task-related variables other than stimulus identity. Indeed, although the responses within regions were heterogeneous (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>), there were clear differences in the average responses between regions (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Specifically, V1 neurons were predominantly active during the stimulus epoch, while PPC and fMC exhibited more heterogeneous responses spanning stimulus, delay, and response epochs. Although sustained delay-period activity could be observed across all cortical regions, it was most prevalent in fMC, both in single-unit (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>) and population (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>) activity.

Indeed, V1 neurons exhibit similar responses to correct and error trials with the same stimulus, while neurons in PPC and fMC show very different responses on the two trial types (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, left and middle panels corresponding to miss vs. hit trials; Pearson correlation between miss and hit trials, V1: 0.47 \u00b1 0.03, PPC: 0.05 \u00b1 0.01, fMC: 0.06 \u00b1 0.02).

In V1, stimulus identity could be decoded with perfect accuracy given a sufficient number of neurons (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>, left), while behavioral choice was only weakly encoded (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>, left). The stimulus identity encoding peaked during the visual stimulus and then gradually declined throughout the trial (statistically significant from baseline from 0.2\u20139.2\u2009s, mean value greater than 95% CI of shuffled permutations for consecutive time points, see Materials and methods), likely due to the slow decay of the GCaMP6s indicator, while the behavioral choice encoding gradually increased, peaking during the response period (statistically significant from 4.8 to 6.8\u2009s and from\u00a08.4\u00a0to\u00a010.0\u2009s; <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>, left). Note that in all three regions, the increase in stimulus identity encoding during the response epoch is likely the byproduct of reward or punishment (which is directly associated with the stimulus identity) influencing motor activity. In PPC, both stimulus identity and behavioral choice could be decoded with moderate success (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B,C</a>, middle), although the dynamics were noticeably different. Specifically, while the stimulus identity was predominantly encoded early in the trial (statistically significant from 0.6\u20133.4\u2009s and 7.2\u201310.0\u2009s), the behavioral choice encoding slightly lagged the stimulus identity encoding, and remained high throughout the trial, peaking during the early part of the licking response (statistically significant from 1.4\u201310.0\u2009s; <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>, middle). Note that the stimulus encoding is much weaker in PPC than in V1, likely due to the large number of neurons that jointly-encode stimulus and choice information (<a href=\"#bib61\">Park et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Raposo et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Pho et al., 2015</a>). Finally, in fMC the stimulus identity could not be decoded above chance for the majority of the trial (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>, right), while the behavioral choice could be decoded with greater accuracy in fMC than in other regions (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>, right). Thus, while stimulus identity decoding was only above chance during the response epoch (statistically significant from 8.8\u20139.4\u2009s, see caveat on stimulus identity encoding during response epoch above), the behavioral choice could be decoded throughout the delay and response epochs (statistically significant from 3.0\u201310.0\u2009s; <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>, right)."

As a second approach to investigating the encoding dynamics of neural populations in different regions, we used targeted dimensionality reduction to re-map the high dimensional neural space into a lower dimensional subspace in which the axes correspond to task-relevant variables (<a href=\"#bib51\">Mante et al., 2013</a>). This was accomplished by first using principal component analysis to reduce the high-dimensional neural space in each region to a lower-dimensional \u2018de-noised\u2019 subspace, then using linear regression to define orthogonal axes for \u2018stimulus\u2019 and \u2018choice\u2019 from the principal components (see Materials and methods). By measuring the difference in \u2018hit\u2019 and \u2018correct reject\u2019 trajectories along the \u2018stimulus\u2019 and \u2018choice\u2019 axes, we found once again that V1 principally encodes the stimulus identity (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,D</a>), PPC encodes a mixture of stimulus identity and behavioral choice (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B,E</a>), and fMC predominantly encodes the behavioral choice throughout the stimulus, delay, and response epochs (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C,F</a>). Although there are slight differences between the results of the ideal observer and targeted dimensional reduction approaches, they reveal similar overall encoding dynamics in each region. Carrying out the same analysis with the populations of suppressed neurons in each region (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) revealed that there was little coding of task-relevant variables, with the exception of a small amount of behavioral choice encoding in fMC (data not shown)."

This implies that stimulus identity is rapidly transformed into a behavioral choice within the stimulus epoch (possibly within PPC), and then the behavioral choice is maintained in higher regions (potentially in both PPC and fMC) until the relevant motor action is performed (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

To directly test the plausibility of our working hypothesis (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), we next used an optogenetic inactivation approach to directly test the necessity of spatially defined cortical regions during specific epochs of the task. To inactivate the cortical regions of interest, we utilized the VGAT-ChR2-EYFP transgenic mouse line (<a href=\"#bib80\">Zhao et al., 2011</a>) to rapidly and reversibly inhibit neural activity. The VGAT-ChR2-EYFP mice express the light-sensitive cation channel channelrhodopsin (ChR2) in all cortical inhibitory neuron subtypes, and thus stimulation of cortex with 473\u00a0nm light effectively silences the activity of nearby pyramidal cells (<a href=\"#bib80\">Zhao et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Guo et al., 2013</a>). To characterize the efficacy of optogenetic inhibition, we performed cell-attached recordings from regular-spiking neurons in L2/3 and L5 of region V1 (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). We found that laser stimulation (2\u2009s continuous pulses, 6.5\u00a0mW mm<sup>\u22122</sup>) potently inhibited the activity of regular spiking neurons (see example L5 neuron, <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>), completely eliminating spikes during the laser stimulation period in all recorded neurons, even during presentation of a drifting grating stimulus of the preferred orientation (grating presented from 1\u2009s before laser stimulation to 1\u2009s after laser stimulation; <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>, inset, <i>n</i> = 2 mice). To characterize the spatial extent of photoinhibition, we performed immunohistochemistry using c-Fos as a marker of neural activity (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>). Na\u00efve VGAT-ChR2-EYFP and control mice were implanted with windows and periodically illuminated with 2\u00a0s continuous pulses of 473\u00a0nm light (6.5\u00a0mW mm<sup>\u22122</sup>).

In particular, while V1 exhibited a moderate bias toward Hit trials (65.3% target-preferring), PPC and fMC exhibited much stronger biases toward Hit trials (95.5% and 97.2% target-selective, respectively), although there was a small fraction of neurons that showed robust responses selective for CR trials (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplements 1</a>\u2013<a href=\"#fig3s3\">3</a>). Given that the false alarm rate exceeded the miss rate at all delays, it is surprising that there is not more activity reflecting the suppression of licking on non-target trials. In future studies, it would be interesting to probe other regions involved in motor and cognitive control, such as striatum and prefrontal cortex, to see if there are signals corresponding to the suppression of licking during correct reject trials."

It has been unclear whether the different modes of neural activity (steady-state vs. sequential) observed during short-term memory depend on the behavioral task, or whether the sequential activity had simply been obscured by lower-throughput methods of collecting and analyzing the data. Using volumetric calcium imaging to sample large populations of neurons, we found evidence in our task for steady-state representation of motor choice, with the vast majority of delay-sensitive neurons becoming active early in the trial and exhibiting persistent or ramping activity throughout the delay period (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G,J,K</a>; <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplements 1</a>\u2013<a href=\"#fig3s3\">3</a>). We suspect that the nature of the mnemonic information in the behavioral task has a strong bearing on the mode of activity observed. In tasks where neurons exhibit steady-state activity, such as our study and others (<a href=\"#bib28\">Fuster and Alexander, 1971</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Kojima and Goldman-Rakic, 1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Funahashi et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Shadlen and Newsome, 2001</a>), the encoded motor plan is held constant throughout the delay period (e.g., lick when the spout comes forward; make a saccade to a fixed location). In contrast, in tasks where neurons exhibit sequential activity (<a href=\"#bib5\">Baeg et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Fujisawa et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Harvey et al., 2012</a>) the encoded motor plan may vary as a function of the trial as the animal navigates through real or virtual space. Both types of memory are important for understanding complex behavior, and warrant further study of the underlying neural architecture."

However, these neurons were generally much less selective than enhanced neurons (particularly in V1 and PPC), and as a result appear to play little role in encoding task-relevant variables (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Without a method for specifically manipulating the activity of the suppressed neurons, it is difficult to unambiguously discern what role they may play in task performance. One possibility is that suppression of spontaneously active neurons may reduce any ongoing task-irrelevant activity, and thereby improve the readout of task-relevant population activity by higher-order neurons."

Specifically, the V1 population predominantly encodes the stimulus identity, particularly early in the trial. Similar to previous research in non-human primates (<a href=\"#bib61\">Park et al., 2014</a>) and rodents (<a href=\"#bib65\">Raposo et al., 2014</a>), we find multiplexed encoding of stimulus identity and behavioral choice in PPC. However, we find that the dynamics of the stimulus identity and behavioral choice encoding in PPC are distinct, with choice encoding lagging slightly, and lasting throughout the delay period. The fMC predominantly encodes behavioral choice, beginning early in the trial and lasting throughout the delay period until after the motor response is made, in accord with choice-related activity observed in premotor regions in earlier rodent (<a href=\"#bib22\">Erlich et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Guo et al., 2013</a>, <a href=\"#bib48\">Li et al., 2015</a>) and non-human primate studies (<a href=\"#bib39\">Hernandez et al., 2010</a>)."

Why does PPC appear to play a critical role in some tasks but not in others? One possibility is that PPC plays a greater role for some sensory modalities than others during sensorimotor decision tasks, perhaps due to differences in anatomy (e.g., S1 directly projects to motor regions while V1 input reaches motor cortex only indirectly, with PPC as the principal cortical intermediary; <a href=\"#bib75\">Wang et al., 2012</a>). Indeed, a recent study found that pharmacological inhibition of PPC somewhat impaired performance of a rate discrimination task for visual stimuli, but did not affect performance when auditory stimuli were used (<a href=\"#bib65\">Raposo et al., 2014</a>). Another intriguing possibility is that PPC plays a greater role for sensorimotor tasks in which higher-level features (e.g., orientation) must be mapped to motor actions; in contrast to tasks involving detection of simple stimuli, which may be mediated by subcortical or direct sensory cortex to motor cortex projections. This could be tested directly by investigating the necessity of PPC in tasks that differ in the complexity of the discriminated feature while the rest of the task structure is kept constant."

Indeed, while photoinhibition of fMC during the delay period results in complete disruption of behavioral performance, photoinhibition of PPC during the delay period has no significant effect (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>). This suggests that, at least in motor planning tasks, PPC is likely more important for mapping stimulus identity to behavioral choice than for maintaining the choice in short-term memory stores. A separate study from our lab using a zero-delay version of the task revealed a large number of spatially-intermixed neurons in PPC (but not V1) encode the response choice in addition to the stimulus, and will actually switch selectivity if the target and non-target stimuli are switched (<a href=\"#bib63\">Pho et al., 2015</a>). However, additional research will be necessary to determine if the PPC is indeed the locus for stimulus-response mapping in these tasks. Another intriguing finding is that the dependency on fMC arises quite early in the task (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>), within hundreds of milliseconds from stimulus onset (<a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This result appears to conflict with earlier findings using unilateral inactivation of motor cortex (<a href=\"#bib35\">Guo et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Hanks et al., 2015</a>), but is consistent with a recent study finding that delay-period motor cortical activity can be recovered if the contralateral hemisphere is spared (<a href=\"#bib49\">Li et al., 2016</a>). The early dependency on fMC activity suggests a very rapid conversion of stimulus information into a motor plan."

It should be noted that if optogenetic or pharmacological inhibition in a given area impairs performance, it does not prove that local processing in the inactivated region is playing a crucial role. Instead, it could be that the impairment is mediated by feedback projections from the inhibited region to other parts of the cortex or subcortical structures. For example, the behavior deficit seen during stimulus epoch photoinhibition of PPC or fMC could be due to a lack feedback from fMC to visual, parietal, or other (sub)cortical regions, perhaps disrupting network homeostasis (<a href=\"#bib60\">Otchy et al., 2015</a>). This is particularly a worry when trying to assess the independent role of highly interconnected and/or adjacent cortical regions (e.g., visual and parietal cortices). In future studies, simultaneous imaging and inactivation will help ensure that optical perturbations are restricted to the desired region."

This in turn may preclude the necessity for actively maintaining a motor plan throughout the delay period. This problem has been recognized for some time (<a href=\"#bib44\">Kojima and Goldman-Rakic, 1982</a>), but it remains challenging to control for the wide range of potential covert movements.

For fluorescence excitation, we used a Ti-Sapphire laser (Mai-Tai eHP, Newport) with dispersion compensation (Deep See, Newport) tuned to <i>\u03bb</i> = 910 nm. For collection, we used GaAsP photomultiplier tubes (Hamamatsu). To achieve a wide field of view, we used a 16x/0.8 NA microscope objective (Nikon), which was mounted on a Z-piezo (Bruker) for volume scanning. Resonant scanning was synchronized to z-piezo steps in the acquisition software for volume scanning. For volume scanning, four 441 \u00d7 512 pixel imaging planes separated by 20 or 25\u2009\u03bcm were imaged sequentially at a stack rate of 5\u2009Hz for 10\u2009min imaging sessions. Occasionally, very bright neurons were visible across multiple planes. To exclude redundant sampling of the same neuron, the Pearson correlation coefficients of the fluorescence traces of all pairs of neurons within a recording were calculated. Neuron pairs with a correlation coefficient &gt; 0.5, and an inter-ROI distance &lt;12.5\u2009\u03bcm in the XY plane were considered to be redundant and the ROI with the lower average fluorescence signal (more likely out of plane) was removed. Even with virus titer dilution, a small number of nucleus-filled neurons were observed in most experiments (<a href=\"#bib16\">Chen et al., 2013</a>), but they comprised a small percentage of neurons and generally did not exhibit significant task-driven responses (<a href=\"#bib38\">Harvey et al., 2012</a>). Laser power ranged from 40\u201375 mW at the sample depending on GCaMP6s expression levels. Photobleaching was minimal (&lt;1% min<sup>\u22121</sup>) for all laser powers used. A custom stainless steel plate (<a href=\"http://emachineshop.com/.com\">eMachineShop.com</a>) attached to a black curtain was mounted to the head plate before imaging to prevent light from the visual stimulus monitor from reaching the PMTs.

Testing neurons for significant responses was complicated by the large number of neurons (&gt;9000) and the number of samples per trial. Using a traditional threshold approach (with responses considered significant if they pass a threshold of multiple SDs from baseline) would yield either an unreasonable number of false positives (if a low threshold was used) or an unreasonable number of false rejections (if a high threshold was used). The GCaMP6s indicator has a long decay time constant (\u03c4<sub>1/2</sub> &gt; 1\u2009s), with fluorescence transients staying above baseline for &gt;3\u2009s for even a single action potential (<a href=\"#bib16\">Chen et al., 2013</a>). Thus, to capture weak but reliable trial-locked activity while excluding artifacts, we used a low significance threshold (sample different from baseline at p&lt;0.05, Wilcoxon signed-rank test) but required at least 10 samples to be significant in the same direction for at least 2 (of 3) delays for either hit or CR trials to be considered statistically significant (probability of significant response for any one neuron purely by chance &lt;10<sup>\u20139</sup>). Since reliable GCaMP6s signals will exhibit slow decay over 10 or more samples, this approach will allow genuine calcium signals to emerge as significant, while chance fluctuations in fluorescence and short-duration movement artifacts (such as during licking) will not pass the significance threshold. All neurons that were significantly different from baseline according to these criteria in either the positive (enhanced activity) or negative (suppressed activity) were included in further analysis. To ensure the neuropil correction procedure did not create artificial responses, we required that both uncorrected <i>\u0394F/F</i> and corrected <i>\u0394F/F</i> exhibit significant changes for neurons to be included. Once neurons were determined to have significant responses, the corrected <i>\u0394F/F</i> was used for all further analyses. For some analyses, the <i>\u0394F/F</i> responses were normalized by subtracting the baseline response (1\u2009s before stimulus onset) and dividing by the maximum (for enhanced neurons) or minimum (for suppressed neurons) trial-averaged <i>\u0394F/F</i> for the neuron."

The dendrogram revealed distinct groups with high inter-cluster distance (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Averaging the responses of neurons within these clusters yielded distinct response types that corresponded well to the range of observed responses (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). To determine the number of clusters (<i>K</i> = 6), we iteratively increased the number of clusters until the average traces began showing highly overlapping responses (at <i>K</i> &gt; 6).

To improve categorization (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>), we computed the Pearson correlation coefficient between the response of each neuron and the mean of each of the six response types.

We then determined the point at which the mean <i>\u0394F/F</i> signal for each neuron went above or below baseline in a sustained manner (&gt;1\u03c3 from mean baseline <i>\u0394F/F</i> for 1000 consecutive samples, or 1\u2009s in trial time) and used the first sample as the estimated latency for that neuron. Since the latency distribution of the population was highly skewed in higher regions, we used the first mode of the latency density distribution to describe the onset of population activity (full latency distributions for 6\u2009s delay trials shown in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). Note that these latencies are computed on upsampled data based on a linear interpolation, so the values should be considered approximate.

We then generated a receiver operating characteristic curve from the distances to determine the discriminability of the miss from CR responses. By taking the area under the receiver operating characteristic (auROC; <a href=\"#bib12\">Britten et al., 1992</a>) for each time point, we could quantify the performance of an ideal observer in discriminating stimulus identity based purely on the population responses as a function of time during the trial.

To reduce noise from experiments with very few error trials, only experiments that had at least three error trials of each type (miss, false alarm) were included in the analysis.

Laser intensity was modulated with a variable neutral density filter (Thorlabs) to match the intensity used during behavioral experiments (6.5 mW mm<sup>\u22122</sup>). Full-field drifting grating stimuli were presented for 4 s, with each presentation preceded by a 6 s \u2018off\u2019 period with gray screen. Optogenetic stimulation occurred on every other stimulus presentation during the middle 2 s of the \u2018on\u2019 period. Data was analyzed using Matlab, with spikes detected using a manually-defined thresholds."

The laser was passed through a 50/50 splitter (CM1-BS013, Thorlabs), with each output passed through an adjustable neutral density filter (Thorlabs) into a fiber launch (PAF-X-11-PC-A, Thorlabs). Fibers terminated in ceramic ferrules that were precisely positioned above the cranial window with optical hardware. A light shield (<a href=\"http://emachineshop.com/\">eMachineShop.com</a>) was attached to the head plate to prevent reflected laser light from reaching the retina and influencing behavior. Laser power was controlled by analog inputs sent from the behavior computer. Continuous light pulses (2.2\u2009s, 6.5 mW mm<sup>-2</sup>) were used to suppress activity in a sustained manner at low laser power (<a href=\"#bib80\">Zhao et al., 2011</a>). We measured the spread of inhibition using immunohistological labeling of activity-driven protein expression (see Histology section). For photoinhibition experiments, laser stimulation was given on 50% of trials with 4\u2009s delay (25% of all trials; no photoinhibition on 0\u2009s or 2\u2009s delay trials) in a randomly inter leaved manner. Laser stimulation was applied throughout the duration of visual stimulus presentation (stimulus epoch), in the middle 2\u2009s of delay (delay epoch), or during the spout extension (response epoch)."

After recovery and habituation, mice were head-fixed and stimulated with 2\u2009s light pulses (6.5 mW mm<sup>-2</sup>) every 10\u2009s. Drifting grating stimuli were played during the light pulses to drive neural activity. After 1.5\u2009hr of light stimulation, mice were removed from the rig and perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde. The brain was removed and placed in 4% PFA for 24\u2009h, followed by 24\u2009hr in PBS. 50\u2009\u03bcm sagittal slices were cut and placed in PBST (0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS) with 5% normal goat serum for 1\u2009hr. They were then incubated with primary antibody at 4\u00b0C for 24\u2009hr (rabbit Anti-c-Fos 1:200, SC-52, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.; rabbit Anti-Arc 1:200, ab118929, Abcam). After washing in PBST, slices were incubated 1\u2009hr with secondary antibody (1:200 AlexFlour555 anti-rabbit, Invitrogen). Slices were washed again in PBST, mounted and coverslipped. Slices were imaged on a laser scanning confocal microscope (Zeiss). Repeating this procedure with Arc as an activity marker (1:500 anti-Arc, Abcam) yielded qualitatively similar results as c-Fos (data not shown)."

Bonferroni correction was used for multiple comparisons. Bootstrap estimates of s.e.m. were calculated as the standard deviation of values evaluated in 1,000 bootstrap iterations, obtained by randomly re-sampling with replacement from the original values. Due to very large sample sizes, very small p-values (&lt;10<sup>\u22129</sup>) were approximated as p&lt;10<sup>\u22129</sup>as a lower bound on reasonable probabilities. Sample sizes were not explicitly estimated, as even a single session generally had sufficient samples for the statistical tests used. However, to ensure that results were replicable between sessions and mice, we included 4\u20136 mice for each region in both imaging and inactivation experiments."

It took us a long time, because we had difficulties in figuring out what to do, and we needed to recruit a fourth reviewer. We hope you will understand why when you read the reviews below. There is one reviewer who is strongly on your side, and who defended the manuscript vigorously during the first round of discussions, but the two other reviewers thought that the task design made the data interpretation difficult and therefore thought that the neurobiological conclusions that could be drawn were of interest, but should be published in a more specialised journal. When we asked a fourth reviewer, they agreed with the two more negative reviewers. The major criticism, which was the focus of most of the extensive discussion between reviewers, is perhaps most eloquently explained in the comments of reviewer 4."

This was distinct from the ramps/persistent activity observed in the PPC of primate memory-guided tasks, suggesting a potentially important species difference in working memory mechanisms.

There are important differences between their memory-guided task, which is a go/no-go 2-stimulus task, and some those used historically. For example, in our study of auditory memory-guided orienting we used multiple stimuli to measure a psychometric curve (Erlich et al., 2011). In many classic monkey studies animals has to remember one of 8 locations. The lack of psychometrics in this study makes it harder to interpret the effects of inactivation, but I generally support the position that this is something they should address in their discussion, rather than be a cause for rejection."

In this case, there is no reason the mice cannot make a premotor adjustment (e.g., positioning their tongue on the left or right side of their mouth), and yet again the authors found that distinct populations of neurons are active during the premotor and motor periods of the task, and that both sets of neurons play distinct roles in task performance, consistent with a necessary role for motor planning prior to execution."
