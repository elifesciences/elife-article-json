Here we report the results of those experiments. We found that treatment of human multiple myeloma (MM) cells with the small-molecular inhibitor of BET bromodomains, (+)-JQ1, selectively downregulated <i>MYC</i> transcription, which is similar to what was reported in the original study (Figure 3B; Delmore et al., 2011). Efficacy of (+)-JQ1 was evaluated in an orthotopically xenografted model of MM. Overall survival was increased in (+)-JQ1 treated mice compared to vehicle control, similar to the original study (Figure 7E; Delmore et al., 2011). Tumor burden, as determined by bioluminescence, was decreased in (+)-JQ1 treated mice compared to vehicle control; however, while the effect was in the same direction as the original study (Figure 7C-D; Delmore et al., 2011), it was not statistically significant. The opportunity to detect a statistically significant difference was limited though, due to the higher rate of early death in the control group, and increased overall survival in (+)-JQ1 treated mice before the pre-specified tumor burden analysis endpoint. Additionally, we evaluated the (\u2212)-JQ1 enantiomer that is structurally incapable of inhibiting BET bromodomains, which resulted in a minimal impact on <i>MYC</i> transcription, but did not result in a statistically significant difference in tumor burden or survival distributions compared to treatment with (+)-JQ1. Finally, we report meta-analyses for each result."

Here we report the results of those experiments. We found that treatment of human multiple myeloma (MM) cells with the small-molecular inhibitor of BET bromodomains, (+)-JQ1, selectively downregulated <i>MYC</i> transcription, which is similar to what was reported in the original study (Figure 3B; Delmore et al., 2011). Efficacy of (+)-JQ1 was evaluated in an orthotopically xenografted model of MM. Overall survival was increased in (+)-JQ1 treated mice compared to vehicle control, similar to the original study (Figure 7E; Delmore et al., 2011). Tumor burden, as determined by bioluminescence, was decreased in (+)-JQ1 treated mice compared to vehicle control; however, while the effect was in the same direction as the original study (Figure 7C-D; Delmore et al., 2011), it was not statistically significant. The opportunity to detect a statistically significant difference was limited though, due to the higher rate of early death in the control group, and increased overall survival in (+)-JQ1 treated mice before the pre-specified tumor burden analysis endpoint. Additionally, we evaluated the (\u2212)-JQ1 enantiomer that is structurally incapable of inhibiting BET bromodomains, which resulted in a minimal impact on <i>MYC</i> transcription, but did not result in a statistically significant difference in tumor burden or survival distributions compared to treatment with (+)-JQ1. Finally, we report meta-analyses for each result."

Time-dependent downregulation of <i>MYC</i> was observed in a human MM cell line (MM.1S) treated with (+)-JQ1, in agreement with other examined MM cell lines (<a href=\"#bib13\">Delmore et al., 2011</a>).

Since that publication there have been additional studies examining the therapeutic strategy of targeting BET bromodomains in other types of cancer. This includes reports of antitumor effects using BET bromodomain inhibitors in MM(<a href=\"#bib8\">Chaidos et al., 2014</a>\u00a0,\u00a0<a href=\"#bib40\">Siu et al., 2016</a>),\u00a0ovarian cancer (<a href=\"#bib48\">Zhang et al., 2016</a>), gastric cancer (<a href=\"#bib34\">Montenegro et al., 2014</a>), childhood sarcoma (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bid et al., 2016</a>), and triple negative breast cancer (<a href=\"#bib12\">da Motta et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Shu et al., 2016</a>). Acquired resistance to BET inhibitors have also been reported (<a href=\"#bib16\">Fong et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Kumar et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Rathert et al., 2015</a>), with recent studies suggesting combinatorial drug treatment to overcome resistance mechanisms (<a href=\"#bib4\">Asangani et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Kurimchak et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Yao et al., 2015</a>). In addition to efficacy, the nonclinical safety of BET inhibition has also been examined. In mesenchymal stem cells, (+)-JQ1 was reported to induce cell cycle arrest and downregulation of genes involved in self-renewal, mitosis, and DNA replication (<a href=\"#bib2\">Alghamdi et al., 2016</a>), while mice treated with (+)-JQ1 at an efficacious dose resulted in lymphoid and hematopoietic toxicity (<a href=\"#bib31\">Lee et al., 2016</a>). Currently, several BET bromodomain inhibitors, with slight variation in mechanism, are in clinical trials for patients with various hematologic and solid malignancies (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chaidos et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">French, 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Wadhwa and Nicolaides, 2016</a>). Early results from a phase one study to establish the recommended dose of the OTX015/MK-8628 BET inhibitor in hematologic malignancies reported the drug was tolerated; however, thrombocytopenia was a common toxic effect observed (<a href=\"#bib3\">Amorim et al., 2016</a>). In four patients with advanced stage NUT midline carcinoma, with confirmed BRD4-NUT fusions, early clinical benefit was reported for two, with a third achieving disease stabilization after treatment with OTX015/MK-8628 (<a href=\"#bib41\">Stathis et al., 2016</a>)."

This experiment is similar to what was reported in Figure 3B (<a href=\"#bib13\">Delmore et al., 2011</a>) and assesses the levels of <i>MYC</i> by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) in a human MM cell line stabling expressing luciferase (MM.1S-luc) (<a href=\"#bib33\">Mitsiades et al., 2004</a>). While the original study included a time course treatment with assessments at 0 hr, 0.5 hr, 1 hr, 4 hr, and 8 hr, the replication was restricted to the early- (0 hr and 1 hr) and late-treatment (8 hr) time points. Additionally, the replication experiment was extended to include additional control conditions to monitor <i>MYC</i> expression with the inactive (\u2212)-JQ1 enantiomer (<a href=\"#bib15\">Filippakopoulos et al., 2010</a>) and vehicle control at the same time points. We found that during the time course of cells treated with (+)-JQ1, <i>MYC</i> expression was inhibited by 0.146 times [n\u00a0=\u00a05, <i>SD</i>\u00a0=\u00a00.031] at 1 hr and 0.126 times [n\u00a0=\u00a05, <i>SD</i>\u00a0=\u00a00.036] at 8 hr following treatment compared to the amount of <i>MYC</i> expressed in cells at 0 hr [n\u00a0=\u00a05, M\u00a0=\u00a01.00, <i>SD</i>\u00a0=\u00a00.070] (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>).

In MM.1S-luc cells treated with (\u2212)-JQ1 or vehicle, the average relative <i>MYC</i> expression remained visually largely unchanged following treatment, indicating selectivity of <i>MYC</i> down-regulation through inhibition of BET bromodomains."

The mixed-design analysis of variance (ANOVA) result was statistically significant for all effects.

This included evaluation of tumor burden in mice orthotopically xenografted, as well as analysis of the overall rate of survival. Similar to the <i>in vitro</i> experiment, the inactive (\u2212)-JQ1 enantiomer, which was not included in the original study, was added as an additional control to evaluate the specificity of the approach. Female SCID-beige mice were inoculated intravenously with a previously characterized bioluminescent MM model (MM.1S-luc) that recapitulates the clinical disease and allows for <i>in vivo</i> monitoring of tumor burden (<a href=\"#bib33\">Mitsiades et al., 2004</a>). A pilot study was conducted to determine the appropriate timescale of tumor progression during this replication attempt after an initial attempt to engraft mice resulted in a longer delay from inoculation to detection than expected and reported in the original study. During the pilot study, mice were inoculated and monitored for tumor burden 8 days and 13 days after inoculation as described in the Registered Report (<a href=\"#bib21\">Kandela et al., 2015</a>). The mice continued to be monitored three times a week until 57 days after inoculation when disease symptoms (e.g. significant weight loss and hind limb paralysis) associated with this xenograft model were detected in multiple mice. The baseline that was observed in the original study eight days after inoculation (~2\u00d710<sup>6</sup> bioluminescence) was not observed until day 27 post-inoculation in the pilot study. Interestingly, other studies that utilized almost the same model (strain, sex, and age of mice as well as mode of injection) have also reported variable times to detectable engraftment. Tai and colleagues did not report baseline signals until two weeks after inoculation, granted 5\u00d710<sup>6</sup> cells were injected opposed to\u00a0the 2\u00d710<sup>6</sup> cells injected in the original study and this replication attempt (<a href=\"#bib42\">Tai et al., 2014</a>). Similarly, Zhang and colleagues did not observe this level of baseline bioluminescence until 2\u20133 weeks when injecting 3\u00d710<sup>6</sup> cells (<a href=\"#bib47\">Zhang et al., 2014</a>). Additionally, two other studies reported variable times to detectable engraftment, however these studies utilized different mouse strains and sex. When male SCID/NOD mice were injected with 5\u00d710<sup>6</sup> cells, a baseline signal was not reported until two weeks after inoculation (<a href=\"#bib33\">Mitsiades et al., 2004</a>), while Azab and colleagues, which inoculated 2\u00d710<sup>6</sup> MM.1S-luc cells, reported that it took 3\u20134 weeks for sufficient tumor progression to occur and be detected (<a href=\"#bib5\">Azab et al., 2009</a>)."

After a further measurement five days later, all mice with established disease, defined as lesions diffusely engrafted in the skeleton with an increase in bioluminescence between days 30 and 35, were randomized into three cohorts. Following daily intraperitoneal injection of vehicle control, 50 mg/kg (+)-JQ1, or 50 mg/kg (\u2212)-JQ1 for 36 days we assessed the overall survival rate of the animals (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). Mice treated with vehicle control achieved a median survival of 24.5 days during the treatment period [n\u00a0=\u00a012], which was lengthened during (+)-JQ1 treatment. The median survival of the (+)-JQ1 treated group could not be determined since more than half of the animals survived to the pre-specified study endpoint of 36 days. The median survival of mice treated with (\u2212)-JQ1 [n\u00a0=\u00a012] was 29 days. This compares to the original study which achieved a median survival of 22 days with vehicle control [n\u00a0=\u00a010] that was prolonged to 35 days with (+)-JQ1 treatment [n\u00a0=\u00a09]. Furthermore, the median survival rates for vehicle treated mice are in agreement with control conditions in other studies reporting survival during treatment with this xenograft model (<a href=\"#bib33\">Mitsiades et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Tai et al., 2014</a>). To compare the survival distributions a log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test was performed. As outlined in the Registered Report (<a href=\"#bib21\">Kandela et al., 2015</a>), we planned to conduct two comparisons using the Bonferroni correction to adjust for multiple comparisons making the significance threshold 0.025.

Interestingly, this result suggests the (\u2212)-JQ1 enantiomer might possess pharmacological activity even though relative <i>MYC</i> expression remained largely unchanged following treatment <i>in vitro</i> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). This could be due to how (\u2212)-JQ1 interacts with and is metabolized with other molecules <i>in vivo</i> compared to (+)-JQ1, thus leading to unexpected effects (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chhabra et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Nguyen et al., 2006</a>)."

To test if (+)-JQ1 treatment decreased the burden of disease, we performed a one-way ANOVA on the day 22 bioluminescence signal (natural log-transformed), which was not statistically significant, <i>F</i>(2,24)\u00a0=\u00a01.126, <i>p</i>=0.341.

These results should take into consideration that some mice were euthanized due to disease progression before the prespecified tumor burden analysis endpoint of 22 days (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), which did not occur in the original study. This led to a sample size imbalance due to the preferential death of mice in the vehicle\u00a0control group (5 of 12) and (-)-JQ1 group (3 of 12) compared to the (+)-JQ1 group (1 of 12). The higher rate of early death in the vehicle control and (-)-JQ1 groups is reflective of the increased overall survival observed in (+)-JQ1 treated mice (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>).\u00a0Besides leading to information loss, if the mice that were euthanized ended up having high tumor burdens, then the group averages reported in this replication attempt would be distorted, limiting the opportunity to detect a statistically significant difference (<a href=\"#bib30\">Laajala et al., 2012</a>). This could be due to\u00a0biological variability of the kinetics of engraftment and growth of systemically injected tumor cells, as well as differences in the details between the original experimental design and this replication attempt that were not known or accounted for."

The depth and location of the tumor as well as the thickness or color of the animal\u2019s skin can alter the bioluminescent signal (<a href=\"#bib6\">Baba et al., 2007</a>), as well as the choice of anesthesia used (<a href=\"#bib23\">Keyaerts et al., 2012</a>). The route of administration and the timing of imaging after D-luciferin injections can also impact the signal. While this study injected D-luciferin by intraperitoneal injection, same as the original study, this route of injection can lead to variations in the signal due to variations in the rate of absorption across the peritoneum to reach the luciferase expressing cells (<a href=\"#bib11\">Close et al., 2011</a>). This makes intravenous (<a href=\"#bib24\">Keyaerts et al., 2008</a>) or subcutaneous (<a href=\"#bib25\">Khalil et al., 2013</a>) administration of D-luciferin attractive alternatives. Further, the signal, and thus the\u00a0perception of tumor burden, can also vary during longitudinal monitoring since the time course of the bioluminescence signal after D-luciferin injection changes with days after the luciferase expressing cells were inoculation (<a href=\"#bib20\">Inoue et al., 2010</a>)."

All data, csv files, and analysis scripts are available on the OSF (<a href=\"https://osf.io/7zqxp/\">https://osf.io/7zqxp/</a>). Confirmatory statistical analysis was pre-registered (<a href=\"https://osf.io/ng3st/\">https://osf.io/ng3st/</a>) before the experimental work began as outlined in the Registered Report (<a href=\"#bib21\">Kandela et al., 2015</a>). Data were checked to ensure assumptions of statistical tests were met. When described in the results, the Bonferroni correction, to account for multiple testings, was applied to the alpha error or the <i>p</i>-value. The Bonferroni corrected value was determined by dividing the uncorrected value by the number of tests performed. For the alpha error this resulted in an <i>a priori</i> significance threshold of 0.025 (0.05/2). Although the Bonferroni method is conservative, it was accounted for in the power calculations to ensure sample size was sufficient. In cases where the number of groups were three and the sample sizes were evenly distributed among the groups, Fisher's LSD test was performed resulting in an <i>a priori</i> significance threshold of 0.05. For the qRT-PCR data analysis, we performed a mixed-design analysis of variance (ANOVA) on normalized <i>MYC</i> expression with time (0 hr, 1 hr, and 8 hr) as the within-subjects factor and treatment ((+)-JQ1, (\u2212)-JQ1, or vehicle) as the between-subjects factor with an <i>a priori</i> significance threshold of 0.05. A meta-analysis of a common original and replication effect size was performed with a random effects model and the <i>metafor</i> R package (<a href=\"#bib44\">Viechtbauer, 2010</a>) (available at <a href=\"https://osf.io/9snja/\">https://osf.io/9snja/</a>).
