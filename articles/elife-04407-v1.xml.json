In both vertebrates and invertebrates, intrinsic determinants are thought to act in neural progenitors to specify their identity and the identity of their neuronal progeny. However, the extent to which individual factors can contribute to this is poorly understood. We investigate the role of <i>orthodenticle</i> in the specification of an identified neuroblast (neuronal progenitor) lineage in the <i>Drosophila</i> brain. Loss of <i>orthodenticle</i> from this neuroblast affects molecular properties, neuroanatomical features and functional inputs of progeny neurons, such that an entire central complex lineage transforms into a functional olfactory projection neuron lineage. This ability to change functional macrocircuitry of the brain through changes in gene expression in a single neuroblast reveals a surprising capacity for novel circuit formation in the brain and provides a paradigm for large-scale evolutionary modification of circuitry."
