Among the best described sub-population of cancer cells generated by non-genetic mechanisms are cells characterized by a CD44+/CD24\u2212 cell surface marker profile. Here, we report that human CD44+/CD24\u2212 cancer cells are genetically highly unstable because of intrinsic defects in their DNA-repair capabilities. In fact, in CD44+/CD24\u2212 cells, constitutive activation of the TGF-beta axis was both necessary and sufficient to reduce the expression of genes that are crucial in coordinating DNA damage repair mechanisms. Consequently, we observed that cancer cells that reside in a CD44+/CD24\u2212 state are characterized by increased accumulation of DNA copy number alterations, greater genetic diversity and improved adaptability to drug treatment. Together, these data suggest that the transition into a CD44+/CD24\u2212 cell state can promote intra-tumor genetic heterogeneity, spur tumor evolution and increase tumor fitness."

Among the best described sub-population of cancer cells generated by non-genetic mechanisms are cells characterized by a CD44+/CD24\u2212 cell surface marker profile. Here, we report that human CD44+/CD24\u2212 cancer cells are genetically highly unstable because of intrinsic defects in their DNA-repair capabilities. In fact, in CD44+/CD24\u2212 cells, constitutive activation of the TGF-beta axis was both necessary and sufficient to reduce the expression of genes that are crucial in coordinating DNA damage repair mechanisms. Consequently, we observed that cancer cells that reside in a CD44+/CD24\u2212 state are characterized by increased accumulation of DNA copy number alterations, greater genetic diversity and improved adaptability to drug treatment. Together, these data suggest that the transition into a CD44+/CD24\u2212 cell state can promote intra-tumor genetic heterogeneity, spur tumor evolution and increase tumor fitness."

Since then, the TGF-beta\u03b2 signaling pathway has been the focus of a multitude of studies. Upon activation, TGF-beta\u03b2 can bind to the TGF-\u03b2 receptor II (T\u03b2RII), which in turn phosphorylates the TGF-\u03b2 receptor I (T\u03b2RI) (<a href=\"#bib38\">Massagu\u00e9 et al., 2005</a>). From here, the activated T\u03b2RI can trigger a signaling cascade that propagates and amplifies the signal through the phosphorylation of intracellular downstream effectors such as SMAD2 and SMAD3, AKT\u00a0and MAPK (<a href=\"#bib38\">Massagu\u00e9 et al., 2005</a>).

In fact, because of the decrease in the efficiency of HDR, a switch to other break-repair mechanisms, including non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and microhomology-mediated break-induced replication (MMBIR) (<a href=\"#bib25\">Hastings et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Fitzgerald et al., 2017</a>), could give\u00a0rise to an increase in the accumulation of chromosomal translocation and CNAs in CD44+/CD24\u2212 cancer cells and cells exposed to TGF-\u03b2.

As an initial paradigm to study CD44+/CD24\u2212 vulnerabilities, we used H1650 and H1650-M3 cells. The latter are derived from H1650 cells and harbor both phenotypic characteristics\u00a0(i.e., epithelial to mesenchymal transition, increased metastatic capacity, motility, invasion and resistance to drug treatment) and molecular characteristics (i.e., increased surface expression of CD44 and decreased expression of CD24, constitutive activation of the TGF-\u03b2 axis, and\u00a0autocrine secretion of IL-6) of CD44+/CD24\u2212 cells (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib68\">Yao et al., 2010</a>). H1650 and H1650-M3 cells were infected with a retroviral shRNA library that was previously constructed in the pSM1 vector (<a href=\"#bib48\">Paddison et al., 2004</a>). This library consists of 28,000 sequence-verified shRNAs designed to target approximately 9,000 genes that have been implicated in tumorigenesis. Each shRNA is linked to a unique 60-nucleotide sequence (its DNA \u2018barcode\u2019) that can be used to monitor relative frequencies of individual shRNAs in complex populations over time. Infected cells were grown, after which the representation of individual shRNAs was determined using barcode microarray analysis. DNA was extracted, amplified and hybridized on custom-made microarrays. In the context of our drop-out screen, the decreased abundance of a particular shRNA in the pool indicates that\u00a0that shRNA is targeting a gene that is essential for proliferation and/or survival. An outline of the experiment is shown in <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>. We found that 135 shRNAs reached a p-value of less than 0.5 and had reduced representations of more than 1-fold in H1650-M3 cells compared with H1650 cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Among the top shRNAs selectively depleted in the CD44+/CD24\u2212 H1650-M3 cells, we identified shRNAs targeting IL-6 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). This finding is consistent with previous reports (both from our group and others) indicating that the IL-6 axis is required for the survival of cells in a CD44+/CD24\u2212 state (<a href=\"#bib68\">Yao et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Marotta et al., 2011</a>).

                                "text": "More specifically, BRCA1 is part of a multi-protein complex that repairs DNA when both strands are broken. Mutations in\u00a0or downregulation of the expression of this gene is associated with predisposition to cancers (<a href=\"#bib15\">Ford et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Miki et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Thompson et al., 1995</a>). <i>ORC5L</i> encodes one of the six subunits that form the origin recognition complex (ORC) that is essential for the initiation of DNA replication in eukaryotic cells. In addition, ORC5L has been shown to be involved in other processes such as transcriptional gene silencing and sister chromatid cohesion in <i>Saccharomyces\u00a0cerevisiae</i> (<a href=\"#bib61\">Suter et al., 2004</a>). ERCC8 is part of the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway, a complex system that eliminates a broad spectrum of structural DNA lesions, including ultraviolet-induced pyrimidine dimers, chemical adducts and DNA cross-links (<a href=\"#bib56\">Reardon and Sancar, 2005</a>). RPA2 is one of the three components of a protein complex involved in DNA replication, DNA repair and recombination. Interestingly, RPA2 phosphorylation is observed after the\u00a0exposure of cells to ionizing radiation (IR) and other DNA-damaging agents, which suggests\u00a0that the modified RPA2 protein participates\u00a0in\u00a0the regulation of DNA repair and/or DNA replication after DNA damage (<a href=\"#bib70\">Zou et al., 2006</a>). When DNA replicative polymerases stall at sites of DNA lesion, translesion synthesis (TLS) polymerases such\u00a0as POLS are recruited. POLS is also reported to be involved in cohesion at the replication fork in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> (<a href=\"#bib64\">Wang et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Wang and Christman, 2001</a>). Replication factor C3 (RFC3) has been shown to be part of multiple protein complexes that\u00a0have\u00a0distinct functions. In conjunction with RFC1, RFC2, RFC4, and RFC5, it forms a heteropentameric protein complex\u00a0that\u00a0is required for the\u00a0loading of PCNA onto DNA at template-primer junctions and for\u00a0the\u00a0polymerase switch between DNA pol\u03b1 and DNA pol\u03b4. As part of a complex that contains the RAD17 subunit, it regulates DNA damage checkpoints; in a complex with the CTF18 subunit, it is necessary for sister chromatid cohesion;\u00a0whereas in a complex with ATAD5, it aids fork stalling recovery and DNA DSB repair (<a href=\"#bib40\">Mayer et al., 2001</a>)."

This system is based on a non-crossover gene-conversion mechanism of two mutated GFP genes: (i) the SceGFP that is disrupted by an 18 bp recognition site for the I-SceI endonuclease and (ii) the iGFP that is truncated at the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends. Upon transfection with pCBASce-I (expressing I-SceI), the SceGFP is cleaved and, because of an HDR event, a functional GFP gene (detectable by flow cytometry) is generated through gene conversion with iGFP. By using this assay, upon transfection with pCBASce-I, we observed a significant reduction in GFP-positive cells among U2OS cells as well as among H1650 cells treated with TGF-\u03b2 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4I</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

Our results demonstrate, for the first time, that the oscillation between different cell states is not \u2018genetically\u2019 neutral. Instead, much like stress-induced mutagenesis, the oscillation between cell states can both promote the acquisition of new mutations and increase the total phenotypic and genomic diversity of a cancer population (<a href=\"#bib41\">Meng et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Ponder et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Chan et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Shee et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Gutierrez et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Fitzgerald et al., 2017</a>).

Consequently, the tumor cells contributing to recurrence must have regenerative potential and behave like cancer stem cells. In light of these considerations, the fact that CD44+/CD24\u2212 cells have self-renewal capabilities and have been referred to as \u2018cancer stem cells\u2019 is particularly captivating (<a href=\"#bib1\">Al-Hajj et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Mani et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Korkaya et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Brooks et al., 2015</a>). Another interesting feature of CD44+/CD24\u2212 cells is their general sturdiness and ability to survive exposure to lethal stimuli when\u00a0compared to cells in other cell states (<a href=\"#bib68\">Yao et al., 2010</a>). As noted above, CD44+/CD24\u2212 cells express higher levels of genes that\u00a0are\u00a0known to protect cells from pro-apoptotic stimuli, including <i>BCL-2</i>, <i>BCL-XL</i> and <i>MCL-1</i> (<a href=\"#bib28\">Keitel et al., 2014</a>). It is, therefore, tempting to propose that the transition of cancer cells into a CD44+/CD24\u2212 state could provide not only a small sub-population of tumor cells that\u00a0can withstand and survive an initial destructive drug attack, but also the means to accumulate new genetic mutations that will further increase their fitness,\u00a0ultimately allowing their growth and expansion even in the presence of a drug."

TGF-\u03b2 is not only produced by CD44+/CD24\u2212 cells but it is among the many factors that mediate the communication between the cancer cells and their surrounding stroma (<a href=\"#bib39\">Massagu\u00e9, 2008</a>). Hence, our findings are particularly exciting because,\u00a0in principle,\u00a0they could provide additional support for the role of the tumor microenvironment in shaping tumor fitness. This could be especially relevant in the case of chronic inflammatory conditions and current cancer treatments, as both have been shown to increase TGF-\u03b2 levels in tissues. Consequently, we can view chemotherapy regimens as double-edged swords. While they can kill cancer cells by inducing inflammation and TGF-\u03b2, they can also spur cancer cell evolution and paradoxically contribute to drug resistance. In other words, as noted by Dr Huang in one of his current review articles, our observations may echo Nietzsche\u2019s classic statement: \u2018What does not kill me, makes me stronger\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib52\">Pisco and Huang, 2015</a>).

The possibility that TGF-\u03b2 could impair DNA-damage responses not only in the context of cancer cells but also in normal somatic cells is intriguing. This, in fact, could provide a means to activate a\u00a0tumor suppressor network that\u00a0is\u00a0based on DNA-damage responses. Consequently, TGF-\u03b2=mediated impaired HDR could be part of an intrinsic cell mechanism\u00a0that\u00a0balances cell proliferation in tissues. On the other hand, it could also be possible that when DNA-damage-repair mechanisms are dimmed, the\u00a0genetic diversity of cells in tissues\u00a0is\u00a0increased. Herein, inhibition of HDR by TGF-\u03b2 could provide a means to increase the heterogeneity of cells within tissues during development.

As a possible explanation for the differences observed across the studies mentioned here, we noted that those indicating that TGF-\u03b2 promotes DNA-damage-repair responses were conducted under stress conditions (i.e., PALA treatment, irradiation\u00a0or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment) and in response to reactive oxygen species (ROS) and did not distinguish between the effect of TGF-\u03b2 on these experimental conditions (i.e., on\u00a0ROS scavengers) and a direct effect on DNA repair.
