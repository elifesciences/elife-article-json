Considering the small number of adult-born neurons generated at any given time, it is surprising that this sparse population of cells can substantially influence behavior. Recent studies have demonstrated that heightened excitability and plasticity may be critical for the contribution of young adult-born cells for certain tasks. What is not well understood is how these unique biophysical and synaptic properties may translate to networks that support behavioral function. Here we employed a location discrimination task in mice while using optogenetics to transiently silence adult-born neurons at different ages. We discovered that adult-born neurons promote location discrimination during early stages of development but only if they undergo maturation during task acquisition. Silencing of young adult-born neurons also produced changes extending to the contralateral hippocampus, detectable by both electrophysiology and fMRI measurements, suggesting young neurons may modulate location discrimination through influences on bilateral hippocampal networks."

Considering the small number of adult-born neurons generated at any given time, it is surprising that this sparse population of cells can substantially influence behavior. Recent studies have demonstrated that heightened excitability and plasticity may be critical for the contribution of young adult-born cells for certain tasks. What is not well understood is how these unique biophysical and synaptic properties may translate to networks that support behavioral function. Here we employed a location discrimination task in mice while using optogenetics to transiently silence adult-born neurons at different ages. We discovered that adult-born neurons promote location discrimination during early stages of development but only if they undergo maturation during task acquisition. Silencing of young adult-born neurons also produced changes extending to the contralateral hippocampus, detectable by both electrophysiology and fMRI measurements, suggesting young neurons may modulate location discrimination through influences on bilateral hippocampal networks."

Neurons generated in the dentate gyrus (DG) area of the hippocampus during adulthood mature into dentate granule cells (DGCs), which can integrate into existing hippocampal neural circuits (<a href=\"#bib68\">Toni et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Gu et al., 2012</a>) and influence affective states or cognitive processes (<a href=\"#bib60\">Santarelli et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Snyder et al., 2011</a>). In particular, recent studies applying pharmacogenetic and optogenetic tools to inhibit adult neurogenesis have demonstrated how this population of new cells can profoundly influence performance in certain hippocampal dependent tasks, such as those that assess spatial pattern separation and cognitive flexibility (<a href=\"#bib14\">Clelland et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Gu et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Swan et al., 2014</a>)."

The biophysical properties of young abDGCs, during their highly excitable critical developmental window may be uniquely suited to facilitate the computational aspects that underlie pattern separation by influencing larger networks (<a href=\"#bib58\">Sahay et al., 2011a</a>, <a href=\"#bib59\">2011b</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Yassa and Stark, 2011</a>). It is plausible, for example, that young abDGCs may be easily excited by entorhinal inputs that recruit distinct neuronal ensembles, and thus constitute a unique pattern of activity required for pattern separation (<a href=\"#bib24\">Ge et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Sahay et al., 2011b</a>). Alternatively, abDGCs with presumed higher baseline firing rates may contribute to pattern separation by non-selectively driving global feedback inhibition via hilar interneurons, thereby creating a sparse firing state within the DG, in which only the strongest or most highly trained inputs can overcome local inhibition (<a href=\"#bib31\">Jung and McNaughton, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Alme et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Neunuebel and Knierim, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Ikrar et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Piatti et al., 2013</a>)."

In order to better understand how these cells integrate into behavioral networks and influence hippocampal function, we performed a series of experiments using a location discrimination (LD) task designed to test spatial pattern separation, an\u00a0ability shown to be critically dependent on hippocampal neurogenesis. Pattern separation refers to a computational process of forming distinct representations of similar inputs via unique ensembles of neurons, which could facilitate memory encoding by minimizing interference (<a href=\"#bib59\">Sahay et al., 2011b</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Yassa and Stark, 2011</a>). It has been hypothesized that the DG can perform this function as a consequence of the sparse firing properties of its cells and the large number of dentate cells compared to both its upstream and downstream regions (<a href=\"#bib69\">Treves and Rolls, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Leutgeb et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Yassa and Stark, 2011</a>). While pattern separation could facilitate the ability to distinguish between experiences that are similar, it has been difficult to test how the adult-born DGCs may contribute to this ability. A few behavioral studies have provided evidence that the DG, and the existence of abDGCs in particular, are relevant for discriminating between similar experiences or spatial locations (<a href=\"#bib14\">Clelland et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Yassa and Stark, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">D\u00e9ry et al., 2013</a>). For example, selective lesions of the DG but not CA1 or CA3 impaired rats\u2019 ability to discriminate between locations in spatial discrimination tasks (<a href=\"#bib69\">Treves and Rolls, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Leutgeb et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Yassa and Stark, 2011</a>). Studies in humans have also shown that increases in blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) signal in the DG is highly correlated with the pattern separation process (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bakker et al., 2008</a>). Interestingly, even though the impact of adult neurogenesis on other hippocampal-dependent behaviors remains controversial (<a href=\"#bib14\">Clelland et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Deng et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Sahay et al., 2011a</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Kesner, 2013</a>), chronic increases or decreases of adult neurogenesis have provided consistent results in behavioral tasks designed to test abilities that are thought to depend on pattern separation (<a href=\"#bib14\">Clelland et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Sahay et al., 2011a</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Kesner et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Rangel et al., 2014</a>)."

In the central nervous system, the vast majority of newly divided cells in the subgranular zone will go on to become granule cells (<a href=\"#bib38\">Kuhn et al., 1996</a>). Therefore, we designed a Murine Stem Cell Virus (MSCV) retrovirus (<a href=\"#bib28\">Hawley et al., 1994</a>) with a <i>synapsin</i> promoter (SYN1) to drive the selective expression of the optogenetic silencer ArchT (<a href=\"#bib26\">Han et al., 2011</a>) only in newborn cells that will take on a neuronal fate (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1a</a>). However, to verify and quantify the time course and specificity of MSCV targeting, we also characterized the co-localization of ArchT-GFP or GFP reporter labeling with the non-specific dividing cell marker EdU injected at 0, 3 and 6 days after retrovirus injection. EdU was delivered systemically, resulting in the labeling of all newly dividing cells in both hemispheres across the dorsal-ventral axis of the hippocampus. Although, MSCV was delivered intracranially in one injection per hemisphere, we found that a single injection preferentially labeled cells that would begin differentiating into abDGC over the first few days following virus injection. We found that 2.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.5% of all EDU-labeled cells co-localized with the GFP transgene delivered via MSCV in animals given EdU injections three days post-viral injection. This number fell to 0.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3% of all EdU-labeled cells for animals given EdU injections on day seven post-virus (n\u00a0=\u00a03 mice for each group). This finding also validates that our MSCV retrovirus construct drove expression of ArchT-GFP uniquely in cells that were undergoing division during the short period following viral delivery, consistent with other retroviral studies (<a href=\"#bib22\">Faulkner et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Toni et al., 2008</a>). Among GFP-expressing cells examined two weeks after viral injections, almost all exhibited clear neuronal morphology, consistent with the preferred neuronal targeting properties of the <i>synapsin</i> promoter (<a href=\"#bib51\">Nathanson et al., 2009</a>). Labeled abDGCs imaged 30\u201360 days post injection showed typical dentate cell morphology (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,\u00a0C</a>)\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib71\">Zhao et al., 2006</a>), and ArchT-GFP expression was well targeted to the plasma membrane and remained strong in animals tested as far out as eight months post-viral injection (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>)."

This task was designed to quantitatively measure the animal\u2019s ability to discriminate between two objects separated spatially from one another across various distances (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), and has been shown to be sensitive to hippocampal lesions (<a href=\"#bib46\">McTighe et al., 2009</a>) or chronic ablation of adult neurogenesis using x-ray irradiation (<a href=\"#bib14\">Clelland et al., 2009</a>). Specifically, we trained mice to separate two illuminated windows from one another in order to receive a water reward. The\u00a0reward was obtained by returning to the same illuminated window on a given set of trials, defined as a block. Within a daily behavioral session, the same two windows remained illuminated but the rewarded window switched once an animal performed seven out of eight consecutive trials correctly. The following trial constituted the first trial of the subsequent block. Animals would continue for a total of 60 trials with the rewarded window alternating between the two illuminated ports as each block was successfully completed. Task difficulty was manipulated by varying the spatial distance parametrically between the two illuminated windows, separated by either one dark window (the difficult separation condition), three dark windows in between the illuminated windows (the medium separation condition), or five dark windows in between the illuminated windows (the easy separation condition). Further, the medium separation condition was only used for task training, and silencing sessions were only conducted in the difficult and easy separation condition to reduce the total number of silencing sessions animals were exposed to across days. Each day, mice were trained or tested using only one separation condition. Trials were separated by a 10 s inter-trial interval (ITI). This task was used because it is well suited to studying pattern separation in tethered animals and has been extensively validated in x-ray irradiated animals previously (<a href=\"#bib14\">Clelland et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Creer et al., 2010</a>)."

This finding is consistent with the observation that although a significant number of abDGCs degenerate within the first couple weeks of birth, little degeneration occurs beyond 4 weeks of age (<a href=\"#bib17\">Dayer et al., 2003</a>). Although unlikely, we cannot rule out the possibility that a small and histologically undetectable fraction of ArchT-GFP labelled neurons may degenerate given the variability among mice, which may be critical in influencing an individual animal\u2019s behavior. Whether the observed loss of behavioral impact during retest could be due to a slight reduction in cell number, or changes in the intrinsic excitability or synaptic targeting properties of the same number of cells; our results provide direct longitudinal evidence that a set of age-defined abDGCs that are highly effective in modulating LD performance when young, have comparatively weaker effects on performance at later developmental stages. This is consistent with the general observation that abDGCs exhibit differing levels of influence on behavior across maturation (<a href=\"#bib25\">Gu et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Nakashiba et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Swan et al., 2014</a>)."

As silencing in POMC-Arch mice represents complete inhibition of all DGCs simultaneously (including both young and mature neurons), our findings suggest that the DG has a critical and ongoing role in spatial discrimination during both the initial test and retest, and suggest that new young cells continue to support performance throughout the animal\u2019s lifetime.

The time-course extracted from significantly changed voxels revealed a decrease in BOLD signals in bilateral hippocampal regions (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4Fi, ii</a>). When the same mice were retested at 16 weeks, optogenetic silencing failed to produce any detectable BOLD signal changes (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>) (<a href=\"#bib3\">Alme et al., 2010</a>). The same opto-fMRI testing in the POMC-Arch transgenic mice showed much stronger reduction in BOLD signals in the local ipsilateral hippocampus compared to that observed upon optogenetic silencing of only young abDGCs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E, 4Fiii</a>), consistent with the theory that a greater number of DG granule cells were silenced in these transgenic mice. Interestingly and surprisingly, we did not observe any BOLD signals in the contralateral hippocampus in the POMC-Arch mice. It is possible; however, that a large recruitment of the DG ipsilaterally overwhelms, and potentially masks, the contrast signal present in the contralateral hemisphere arising from a relatively sparse population of bilaterally influencing young granule cells. Together, these results suggest that abDGCs can engage the\u00a0bilateral hippocampus during early development. While fMRI cannot directly measure the neural circuits recruited by young abDGCs, anatomical evidence supports the idea that abDGCs may function through the contralaterally projecting hippocampal neurons that are downstream of the optogenetically silenced abDGCs, such as the hilar mossy cells, CA3 pyramidal cells, or CA1 pyramidal cells (<a href=\"#bib4\">Amaral et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Toni et al., 2008</a>)."

Further analysis of the time window revealed that the increase in strength was significantly higher during the last 2.5 s of silencing relative to the baseline for all frequencies ranges analyzed. This was followed by a rapid and reversible return to baseline in the 2.5 s period following laser offset, where oscillation power was not different from the baseline period. This gradual increase in power was broadly represented across multiple frequency bands and is suggestive of an increase in generalized excitability possibly via reduced inhibition. In support of this theory, Lacefield et al. also reported that a broad overall increase in gamma power (25\u201380 Hz) in the hippocampus in urethane anesthetized mice that had been x-ray irradiated 6\u201310 weeks earlier. Further, they determined this increase was dependent on perforant pathway inputs (2012). Our findings with optogenetic silencing are also consistent with other studies of chronic ablation of adult neurogenesis in that newborn cell silencing altered hippocampal oscillatory patterns (<a href=\"#bib39\">Lacefield et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Rangel et al., 2013</a>).

Although previous behavioral studies have reported age-dependent influences of abDGCs (<a href=\"#bib25\">Gu et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Nakashiba et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Swan et al., 2014</a>), our findings add to this discussion by demonstrating that task acquisition coincident with development and maturation is an important contributor in determining if abDGCs will influence spatial location performance. It has been well demonstrated that experience shapes survival, maturation and synapse formation during abDGCs development (<a href=\"#bib66\">Tashiro et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Rangel et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bergami et al., 2015</a>). Our study suggests that these considerations also can be applied to neurons recruited into task-relevant networks. The learning dependent behavioral impact further supports the rational that abDGCs have dynamical connectivity and their integration within hippocampal networks is highly plastic, and subject to modulation through interactions with the environment. It is reasonable to conclude that within the observed developmental window, abDGCs biophysical properties ultimately determine their neural network impact through strategic and learning dependent placement of synaptic connections, beyond nonspecific modulation of local networks (e.g., through regulating overall levels of feedback inhibition [<a href=\"#bib4\">Amaral et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Myers and Scharfman, 2009</a>])."

Our behavioral data also support this hypothesis, and provided the basis for exploring how these cells might contribute to network dynamics throughout the maturation process. Toward this endeavor, we employed fMRI and electrophysiology techniques to measure network influences across the maturation windows explored in our behavioral studies. It was only when we silenced young abDGCs during the 6\u20138 week window, but not later on, did we see significant changes in the contralateral hippocampal regions. Electrophysiological analysis of the contralateral hippocampus also revealed broad changes in the power across a number of frequency bands during optogenetic silencing of young abDGCs. Although we saw a general rise in power in CA3, the LFP effects reached significance in CA1, presumably because of the expansive level of divergence from CA3 to CA1. CA3 pyramidal cells make 13 k\u201328\u00a0k synaptic connections with CA1 pyramidal cells, and each CA3 cell contacts between 4\u20138% of all CA1 pyramidal cells (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bezaire and Soltesz, 2013</a>).

The processes by which these cells demonstrate this time-limited influence is unknown, but likely involve a combination of factors that coincide with maturation, including altered connectivity and decreased excitability. For example, young abDGCs are easier to stimulate in slice electrophysiology studies (<a href=\"#bib24\">Ge et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Dieni et al., 2013</a>) and are believed to exhibit higher firing rates (<a href=\"#bib45\">McHugh et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Deng et al., 2010</a>), whereas the majority of the DG granule cells, the developmentally-born ones, exhibit low baseline firing rates of under 0.5 Hz (<a href=\"#bib31\">Jung and McNaughton, 1993</a>). Therefore, silencing the highly active young abDGCs could produce a significant downstream network effect that is not present when silencing low firing older granule cells. Another possibility is that young abDGCs may exhibit unique connectivity patterns, such as preferential connections to interneuron populations. Dentate GCs send the largest number of their inputs to hilar inhibitory neurons (<a href=\"#bib1\">Acs\u00e1dy et al., 1998</a>) therefore it is plausible that silencing young active cells could lead to widespread disinhibition of the hippocampus. This interpretation is supported by a follow up study where <a href=\"#bib29\">Ikrar et al. (2013)</a> found that enhancing neurogenesis lead to an increase in synaptic connections of newborn neurons specifically onto hilar interneurons. Interestingly, ablation of adult neurogenesis also leads to enhanced feedforward excitation to CA3 from existing mature GCs."

Lacefield et al. proposed two possible explanations for the paradoxical finding of how the\u00a0elimination of young, excitable, newborn cells may lead to enhanced spontaneous activity (2012): First, that the loss of young cells that preferentially target hilar interneurons or more effectively drive them are important for suppressing DG network activity more broadly. Secondly, that an ongoing competition exists for perforant path inputs amongst competing granule cells and that young cells effectively out compete older cells for input. However, in the absence of young cells, mature GCs can be more effectively driven by perforant path inputs and that this would develop over time as a compensatory effect. Our findings add insight into these competing hypotheses in that the increases in hippocampal network activity following x-ray irradiation is not likely due to plasticity changes associated with the loss of these neurons. Rather, it is an immediate effect of disinhibition of the hippocampal network. We found that optogenetic silencing produced changes in the LFP power that ramped as silencing persisted with the end of the silencing window showing enhanced excitability when compared to the early window. If mechanisms related to synaptogenesis were solely responsible for these changes, it is unlikely that an optogenetic effect would produce a direct change in excitability over such a short timescale. In support of this argument, <a href=\"#bib61\">Singer et al. (2011)</a> described that ablation of neurogenesis also leads to a reduction in inhibitory input into existing granule cells of the DG."

The released inhibition leads to a state where unregulated perforant path input promotes an increase in excitability that is conveyed throughout the hippocampal network. Importantly, this result also adds insight into the role that young cells play in inhibiting the hippocampus during periods of pattern separation. During such performance, recruitment of abDGCs would lead to a sparse firing condition within the DG, in which only the most highly trained inputs overcome inhibition prioritizing input specificity in the face of similar competing inputs.

As pattern separation, in part, is thought to involve the ability to discriminate highly similar inputs into separate and non-overlapping representations (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kheirbek et al., 2012</a>), the loss of global inhibition associated with reduced activity of young GCs could contribute to a decline in input specificity necessary for pattern separation (<a href=\"#bib58\">Sahay et al., 2011a</a>)."

We found that these neurons are recruited into task-relevant networks in an experience-dependent manner, which highlights a role for the importance of ongoing neurogenesis in adulthood. We also found that this cell population specifically, had the ability to recruit and influence large neural networks including the bilateral hippocampus. This provides in part, a mechanistic explanation for how such a small number of cells can so broadly impact behavior performance and offers insight into how the influence of young abDGCs is well suited for mediating cognitive flexibility in the DG circuits (<a href=\"#bib9\">Burghardt et al., 2012</a>). These findings may lead to novel perspectives on how adult neurogenesis modulates hippocampal functions and how a reduction in neurogenesis associated with aging or neurological disease can be related to discontinuities in hippocampal networks more broadly."

The four optical fibers converged onto a single ferrule with an inner diameter of 610 \u00b5m. A customized plastic cone was used to package and shield the final assembled fiber array. To facilitate stereotaxic implantation, a fiber targeting Bregma was included to guide the implantation depth, but not to deliver light. To prevent light leakage, black dye was added into dental cement when securing the implant during surgery."

In the LD condition, two windows were illuminated but only one of the two illuminated windows was the corrected choice, reinforced with water reward. Touching an incorrect window, illuminated or dark, would result white LED timeout light during the ITI. Mice were first trained to perform the LD test on the medium separation condition, defined as being capable of completing at least two blocks per day in two out of three consecutive days.

For LD test with optogenetic testing, mice group x illumination was examined using repeated two-way ANOVA, followed with Bonferroni post hoc t-test to examine the difference in trials to criterion, success rate and the reaction time. For electrophysiology data, two tailed paired t-tests were used. For histology data, unpaired t-tests and one way ANOVA were used. Data met the assumptions of all statistic tests and F-test has been performed to confirm the equality of variance between the groups that were statistically compared. All statistical analyses for behavior, fMRI, and histology were performed with Prism 6. Electrophysiology data was analyzed in SPSS version 20.0)."

The authors expressed Archaerhodopin (ArchT) in adult-born GCs in wild type mice as well as in adult-born and mature GCs in POMC animals to investigate their relative contributions in spatial pattern separation tasks. The authors argue that silencing of adult-born GCs up to an age of 7 weeks after viral injection results in a failure of performing difficult pattern-discrimination tasks but not at an age &gt;12 weeks and draw the conclusion that adult-born GCs are important for spatial pattern discrimination. Moreover, the authors show that adult-born GCs modulate neural activity in the contralateral hippocampus during a specific developmental time window. The authors find that the effects on the activity of the contralateral hippocampus and the time-dependent nature of the behavioral effect are specific to the manipulation of adult-born GCs."

One of the reviewers suggested to apply the eight-arm radial arm maze (different separation distance between arms) as additional behavioral test for pattern separation to strengthen/test their main conclusion."

The authors find evidence that adult-born GC's influence spatial discrimination performance and modulate neural activity in the contralateral hippocampus during a specific time window.

The authors cite Clelland et al. (2009) when referring to their task, but Clelland used an 8-arm radial maze task. The task more closely resembles the task described in Creer et al. (2010). I'm concerned that if it were 7 windows in a row as is depicted by <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, the mice could be using an edge strategy in the easy condition. It would be much more informative to see if there is also a difference in the middle condition, but I'm concerned that they may use an edge/not edge strategy in that condition as well since 2 out of 3 possible configurations include an edge window. It's not quite clear that the differences in behavioral performance between the easy and hard conditions is really the result of the different spatial separations between the conditions, or if it is the result of a difference in the distribution of edge vs. non-edge trials in the conditions. The case for pattern separation could be made much more strongly if the analysis could compare two non-edge conditions at different separations as is the case with the radial arm task from Clelland 2009."

We initially expected to see large signals across both hemispheres in the POMC mice as the reviewer noted. However, it is important to highlight that fMRI is a contrast measure; the figure shows that activity in the ipsilateral hemisphere is substantially stronger than any influences that are occurring in the contralateral hemisphere. It is possible that the ipsilateral effect overwhelms the downstream contrast signal arising in the contralateral hemisphere from DG silencing. As a result, the signal seen in the MSCV mice where only a relatively sparse population of 5-8 week old cells is silenced could be more effective in demonstrating their unique influences on the contralateral hemisphere as shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>.

The released inhibition leads to a state where perforant path input drives hippocampal excitability unchecked as described in the Discussion, fourth paragraph. This is outlined in detail in the response to criticism 3 below but this new analysis and discussion provides a direct mechanistic explanation for the behavioral results as requested by the reviewer. As a final point, because of size and methodology constraints, neither the fMRI or electrophysiology experiments could have been done in performing animals. However, the results from those studies alone reveal an important, previously unpublished, and unique association for newborn cells having bilateral regulatory control of the hippocampus using two independent network measure methodologies. These results are important because it speaks directly to how a small population of neurons can have a profound influence on networks that support the behavioral results and we have emphasized this more directly in the revised manuscript."

This point is explored in the revised manuscript, but briefly, our results suggest that silencing does not lead to an increase in excitability that manifests as enhanced synchrony at any particular frequency band in contralateral CA3. It is important to note that increased LFP synchrony in CA1 fields at gamma frequencies can occur without concurrent CA3 synchrony at gamma frequencies (Middleton and McHugh, 2016)."

In a follow up study, Ikrar et al. (2013) demonstrated that enhancing neurogenesis lead to an increase in synaptic connections of newborn neurons onto hilar interneurons and confirmed that ablation of adult neurogenesis leads to enhanced feedforward excitation to CA3 from existing mature GCs as discussed in the Discussion, fourth paragraph. Our findings are consistent with the interpretation that young adult born cells regulate hippocampal networks by gating excitation through regulation of hilar interneurons. Our findings now connect much of this literature by adding data that reflects a transient and reversible irradiation like lesion that contrasts all these aforementioned studies that have only looked at network effects several weeks after chemical or x-ray ablation. This full discussion is now represented in the fourth, fifth and sixth paragraphs of the revised Discussion. The expanded Discussion now strongly connects disinhibition as a prominent mechanism to the experimental results as requested by the reviewer. Briefly, as pattern separation, in part, is thought to involve the ability to discriminate highly similar inputs into separate and non-overlapping representations (Kheirbek et al., 2012), we believe that the loss of global inhibition associated with reduced activity of young GCs could contribute to the loss of input specificity necessary for pattern separation (Sahay et al., 2011)."

The authors cite Clelland et al. (2009) when referring to their task, but Clelland used an 8-arm radial maze task. The task more closely resembles the task described in Creer et al. (2010). I'm concerned that if it were 7 windows in a row as is depicted by <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>, the mice could be using an edge strategy in the easy condition. It would be much more informative to see if there is also a difference in the middle condition, but I'm concerned that they may use an edge/not edge strategy in that condition as well since 2 out of 3 possible configurations include an edge window. It's not quite clear that the differences in behavioral performance between the easy and hard conditions is really the result of the different spatial separations between the conditions, or if it is the result of a difference in the distribution of edge vs. non-edge trials in the conditions. The case for pattern separation could be made much more strongly if the analysis could compare two non-edge conditions at different separations as is the case with the radial arm task from Clelland 2009.</i> "

In their experiment, they report that on both task variants, DG silencing resulted in profound deficits in task equivalent ways. Near-arm and near-window locations showed profound deficits where far-arm and far-box locations showed negligible impairment in DG irradiated animals. They concluded that both tasks are valid measures of spatial pattern separation and that dentate GCs contribute preferentially to performance in the difficult condition. Thus we feel the point of validation has largely been addressed by the original publication. Also note that the window results of the Clelland study were replicated in our study (similarity of <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E-F</a> (Clelland, 2009) to the results in 2Ci and 2Cii of the submitted manuscript)."

We chose the window based discrimination task because it had been published and validated as a spatial pattern separation task and it was conducive for use in a tethered animal where an animal must be attached to an overhead optical fiber. A large apparatus like the radial arm maze would require a motorized shuttle system that tracked animal movement and would allow the animal to travel over large distances unencumbered by attachment to a laser diode. This was not a practical option for these experiments and these points are now noted in the subsection \u201cAdult neurogenesis contributes to location discrimination (LD) performance\u201d, second paragraph."

The argument of whether edge locations make the easy condition different is a valid one. It is plausible that pattern separation is more integral to task performance during the intermediate and difficult discrimination conditions as neither have edges adjacent to the illuminated windows. Our experiment adopted the use of internal controls (i.e., trials run in the same animals with and without silencing, silencing sessions in the same animals at 8 and 16 weeks) and yielded only differences in performance for the difficult condition at 8 weeks. If we assume the difficult condition requires spatial pattern separation as previously published, the contributions of edges in simplifying the easy condition is not material to the paper\u2019s main results. In hindsight, the inclusion of an additional window (one to either side of the simple configuration) that would always be blacked out would have been more elegant design and avoided the potential of the easy configuration being different in nature."
