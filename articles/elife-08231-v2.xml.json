Their maturation requires the cytosolic Fe-S protein assembly (CIA) machinery. To identify new CIA proteins we employed systematic protein interaction approaches and discovered the essential proteins Yae1 and Lto1 as binding partners of the CIA targeting complex. Depletion of Yae1 or Lto1 results in defective Fe-S maturation of the ribosome-associated ABC protein Rli1, but surprisingly no other tested targets. Yae1 and Lto1 facilitate Fe-S cluster assembly on Rli1 in a chain of binding events. Lto1 uses its conserved C-terminal tryptophan for binding the CIA targeting complex, the deca-GX<sub>3</sub> motifs in both Yae1 and Lto1 facilitate their complex formation, and Yae1 recruits Rli1. Human YAE1D1 and the cancer-related ORAOV1 can replace their yeast counterparts demonstrating evolutionary conservation. Collectively, the Yae1-Lto1 complex functions as a target-specific adaptor that recruits apo-Rli1 to the generic CIA machinery."

Their maturation requires the cytosolic Fe-S protein assembly (CIA) machinery. To identify new CIA proteins we employed systematic protein interaction approaches and discovered the essential proteins Yae1 and Lto1 as binding partners of the CIA targeting complex. Depletion of Yae1 or Lto1 results in defective Fe-S maturation of the ribosome-associated ABC protein Rli1, but surprisingly no other tested targets. Yae1 and Lto1 facilitate Fe-S cluster assembly on Rli1 in a chain of binding events. Lto1 uses its conserved C-terminal tryptophan for binding the CIA targeting complex, the deca-GX<sub>3</sub> motifs in both Yae1 and Lto1 facilitate their complex formation, and Yae1 recruits Rli1. Human YAE1D1 and the cancer-related ORAOV1 can replace their yeast counterparts demonstrating evolutionary conservation. Collectively, the Yae1-Lto1 complex functions as a target-specific adaptor that recruits apo-Rli1 to the generic CIA machinery."

Unlike other CIA proteins, Yae1 and Lto1 are only required for the assembly of just one particular iron-sulfur protein called Rli1, which is essential for the production of proteins. Most newly made iron-sulfur proteins can bind directly to a group of CIA proteins called the CIA targeting complex, but Rli1 cannot. The experiments show that Lto1 binds to both the CIA targeting complex and to Yae1, which in turn recruits the Rli1 to the CIA complex."

Inserting the human counterparts of Yae1 and Lto1 into yeast lacking these proteins could fully restore the assembly of iron-sulfur clusters into Rli1. This suggests that Yae1 and Lto1 proteins evolved in the common ancestors of fungi and humans and have changed little since. Taken together, Paul et al.'s findings reveal that Yae1 and Lto1 act as adaptors that link the rest of the CIA machinery to their specific target protein Rli1 in yeast and humans. A future challenge is to find out the three-dimensional structures of Yae1 and Lto1 to better understand how these proteins work and interact."

The first known step of this biosynthetic process involves the de novo assembly of a [4Fe-4S] cluster on the scaffold protein complex consisting of the two related P-loop NTPases Cfd1 and Nbp35 (<a href=\"#bib55\">Roy et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Hausmann et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Netz et al., 2007</a>, <a href=\"#bib42\">2012a</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Basu et al., 2014</a>). Cluster assembly additionally depends on the electron transfer chain composed of NADPH, the diflavin reductase Tah18 and the Fe-S protein Dre2 (<a href=\"#bib77\">Zhang et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Netz et al., 2010</a>). The second step includes the release of the [4Fe-4S] cluster from the scaffold complex, cluster transfer and subsequent insertion into apoproteins. These reactions are assisted by the iron-only hydrogenase-like protein Nar1 (human IOP1) which fulfils an intermediary, so far not well-defined function, by binding to both Nbp35 and the CIA targeting complex (<a href=\"#bib5\">Balk et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Song and Lee, 2008</a>). The latter is composed of the WD40-repeat protein Cia1, the DUF59 domain protein Cia2 and the HEAT-repeat protein Mms19. All three proteins are conserved from yeast to man, and physically associate with multiple Fe-S target proteins suggesting a direct function in cluster transfer and/or insertion (<a href=\"#bib4\">Balk et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Weerapana et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Gari et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Stehling et al., 2012</a>, <a href=\"#bib64\">2013</a>)."

In turn, ISC or CIA depletion causes severe defects in DNA metabolism including DNA synthesis and repair, chromosome segregation and telomere length regulation (<a href=\"#bib72\">Veatch et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Thierbach et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Gari et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Stehling et al., 2012</a>). As a result, the DNA damage response pathway is activated. Another interesting target of the CIA machinery is the essential ABC protein Rli1 (RNase L inhibitor; human ABCE1). It belongs to the most conserved proteins in Eukarya and Archaea (<a href=\"#bib8\">Barthelme et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Becker et al., 2012</a>), and harbors an N-terminal ferredoxin-like domain with eight conserved cysteine residues that coordinate two [4Fe-4S] clusters (<a href=\"#bib29\">Karcher et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Kispal et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Barthelme et al., 2007</a>). Depletion of Rli1 or disruption of Fe-S cofactor binding leads to nuclear export defects of both ribosomal subunits and consequently to translational arrest (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kispal et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Yarunin et al., 2005</a>). Moreover, Rli1 directly influences protein synthesis via different roles in translation initiation (<a href=\"#bib16\">Dong et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Chen et al., 2006</a>), termination (<a href=\"#bib30\">Khoshnevis et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Shoemaker and Green, 2011</a>), and splitting of ribosomal subunits (<a href=\"#bib7\">Barthelme et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Shoemaker and Green, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Becker et al., 2012</a>). Maintenance of Rli1 function was recently suggested to be the \u2018Achilles' heel\u2019 of aerobic organisms, because Fe-S cofactor supply to Rli1 is sensitive to diverse pro-oxidants (<a href=\"#bib1\">Alhebshi et al., 2012</a>)."

These may include target-specific biogenesis factors that, similar to the mitochondrial ISC proteins Ind1, Nfu1, and BOLA3 (<a href=\"#bib63\">Stehling and Lill, 2013</a>), assist the maturation of selected apoproteins. Such dedicated CIA proteins are expected to bind to both the late-acting CIA components and specific target Fe-S proteins. Here, we performed systematic protein interaction screens in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> to identify new CIA interaction partners. We describe the essential proteins Yae1 and Lto1 as binding partners of the CIA targeting complex. Previously, both proteins were shown to be associated with each other and to interact with the ribosome-associated Fe-S protein Rli1 (<a href=\"#bib33\">Krogan et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Zhai et al., 2014</a>).

In this work, we functionally characterized the yeast and human Yae1-Lto1 complexes as novel target-specific CIA maturation factors for Fe-S cluster assembly on Rli1. Newly developed biochemical approaches and mutagenesis of important structural domains of these proteins elucidated a unique molecular mechanism of how these CIA proteins assist the Fe-S maturation process."

Co-purified proteins were analyzed by mass spectrometry (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). The procedure yielded numerous interactions between the various CIA components (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B,C</a>). For instance, complex formation between Tah18 and Dre2 as well as between Cfd1 and Nbp35 were detected. Moreover, tight interactions were observed within the CIA targeting complex (Cia1-Cia2-Mms19). In keeping with functional observations (<a href=\"#bib4\">Balk et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Hausmann et al., 2005</a>), Nar1 was found to undergo interactions with both the early- and late-acting CIA components. Overall, this interaction pattern fully confirms previous findings on the CIA interactome, thus verifying our experimental strategy (<a href=\"#bib41\">Netz et al., 2014</a>). Three additional protein interactions caught our attention. First, all three components of the CIA targeting complex showed an interaction with the Fe-S protein Rli1, a known target of the CIA machinery (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B,C</a>) (<a href=\"#bib4\">Balk et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Gari et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Stehling et al., 2012</a>). Second, by using several interaction analysis criteria these CIA factors were also found to associate with the essential proteins Yae1 and Lto1. Previous work had provided evidence that Yae1 and Lto1 interact with each other and form a complex with the essential ribosome-associated Fe-S protein Rli1 (<a href=\"#bib33\">Krogan et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Zhai et al., 2014</a>)."

In addition to the tight interaction between Yae1 and Lto1 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, lanes 1 and 2), complex formation of these two proteins with any of the CIA targeting complex partners was observed when Lto1 and Yae1 were co-expressed. Affinity purification of the Yae1-Lto1 complex with the late-acting CIA proteins was significantly enhanced, when the analysis was performed in cells depleted of the early-acting CIA factor Nbp35 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, lanes 6\u20139). This indicated that the interactions of Yae1-Lto1 with CIA components are strengthened, when cytosolic Fe-S protein maturation is impaired. Nevertheless, the efficiency of Yae1-Lto1-Rli1 complex formation (<a href=\"#bib76\">Zhai et al., 2014</a>) was not enhanced by Nbp35 depletion (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), demonstrating that inactivation of the CIA activity affects the association of Yae1-Lto1 with the CIA targeting complex more efficiently than with Rli1. These findings verify our systematic interaction analyses and raise the question whether Yae1 and Lto1 are Fe-S protein targets or perform a function in cytosolic-nuclear Fe-S protein biogenesis."

To study the potential role of Yae1 and Lto1 in the maturation of cytosolic and nuclear Fe-S proteins, we employed an established in vivo <sup>55</sup>Fe radiolabeling assay (<a href=\"#bib31\">Kispal et al., 1999</a>). To this end, we constructed regulatable <i>GALL</i>-promoter-containing yeast strains (Gal-YAE1, Gal-LTO1) which allowed expression of the proteins by cell growth in the presence of galactose and their depletion by growth in the presence of glucose (<a href=\"#bib26\">Janke et al., 2004</a>). In this context, we noted that the start codon of the <i>LTO1</i> gene was erroneously annotated (for further details of this aspect see <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplements 2, 3</a>, and \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). After <sup>55</sup>Fe radiolabeling of WT, Gal-YAE1, Gal-LTO1 and control Gal-NBP35 cells, selected cytosolic and nuclear Fe-S proteins were immunoprecipitated. The protein-associated radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting as a measure of Fe-S cluster assembly. Depletion of Yae1 and Lto1 led to a strong diminution of <sup>55</sup>Fe association with Rli1, and this decrease was comparable to that observed upon depletion of Nbp35 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Despite structural similarities between Yae1 and Lto1, these proteins could not mutually replace each other in Rli1 maturation, even after overexpression (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Surprisingly, no significant decline in <sup>55</sup>Fe-S cluster formation was detectable for three canonical nuclear Fe-S target proteins (Rad3, Ntg2, and Pol3) upon Yae1 or Lto1 depletion (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C\u2013E</a>). As expected, these proteins were not assembled with a <sup>55</sup>Fe-S cluster in cells depleted for the CIA component Nbp35. Immunostaining showed that the levels of Rli1 and the other Fe-S proteins remained unchanged upon depletion of Yae1, Lto1 and Nbp35, with the notable exception of Pol3 in Nbp35-depleted cells due to the known instability of its apoform (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>) (<a href=\"#bib44\">Netz et al., 2012b</a>).

While depletion of Nbp35 strongly diminished the Leu1 activity, depletion of Yae1 or Lto1 had hardly any effect (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Likewise, Yae1 and Lto1 were not required for sulfite reductase activity as estimated by an in vivo color assay (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Further, we analyzed Fe-S cluster assembly on the early-acting CIA proteins Nbp35 and Nar1 in order to explore whether Yae1 or Lto1 deficiency affects the function of the CIA system (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C\u2013E</a>). As estimated by <sup>55</sup>Fe radiolabeling, neither Yae1 nor Lto1 were involved in the maturation of these two Fe-S cluster-containing CIA components. In contrast, depletion of the mitochondrial ISC component Yah1 strongly diminished Fe-S cluster assembly on Nbp35 and Nar1. These findings indicate that Yae1-Lto1 operate downstream of these CIA factors in Rli1 Fe-S cluster association. Finally, activities of the non-Fe-S protein alcohol dehydrogenase and the mitochondrial Fe-S protein aconitase were unchanged upon depletion of both Yae1 and Lto1 (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Taken together, these results, combined with the tight association of Yae1 and Lto1 to the CIA targeting complex, suggest that both proteins are specific for Fe-S cluster formation on Rli1, and thus act late in the CIA pathway. A similar Fe-S protein target specificity is unprecedented in yeast."

This degron is composed of the light-reactive LOV2 domain of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> phot1 and the murine ornithine decarboxylase-like degradation sequence cODC1 (<a href=\"#bib52\">Renicke et al., 2013</a>). Exposure to blue light triggers proteasomal degradation of the psd-fusion proteins (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Induced degradation of Yae1-psd and Lto1-psd was maximal after 2 hr of blue light exposure (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). The extent of Yae1 and Lto1 depletion affected the growth rate of the mutant cells only weakly (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). To further increase the depletion efficiency, cells were treated with the translation inhibitor cycloheximide during light exposure to fully inhibit synthesis of Yae1 protein (<a href=\"#bib52\">Renicke et al., 2013</a>). This trick further decreased the amount of Yae1 (compare immunoblots of <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). We then investigated the effect of light-induced Yae1 or Lto1 depletion on the de novo assembly of Rli1's Fe-S clusters by employing our <sup>55</sup>Fe radiolabeling procedure. Light-induced depletion of Yae1 caused a strong reduction of <sup>55</sup>Fe-S cluster insertion into Rli1 in comparison to the non-exposed sample (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). In contrast, the amount of <sup>55</sup>Fe associated with Leu1 was unchanged upon exposure to blue light. The latter result showed that cycloheximide had no general negative effect on <sup>55</sup>Fe-S cluster insertion into apoproteins. The Lto1-psd mutant strain could not be used in this approach because Rli1 incorporated only little <sup>55</sup>Fe suggesting that the C-terminal psd module interfered with normal function of Lto1. Collectively, these results demonstrate that the light-induced degradation of Yae1 leads to a similar diminution of Fe-S clusters on Rli1 as that observed for Gal-YAE1 cells (cf. <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>)."

No growth was observed, unless cells were transformed with a plasmid containing WT <i>RLI1</i> (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>, top rows) demonstrating that Rli1 is essential even under anaerobiosis. A clue how to explain the non-essentiality of Yae1-Lto1 in the absence of oxygen came from the inspection of Rli1 mutant proteins in which cysteine residues 25 and 61 were exchanged either alone or simultaneously to serine (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kispal et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Zhai et al., 2014</a>). These residues coordinate two different [4Fe-4S] clusters of Rli1 (<a href=\"#bib8\">Barthelme et al., 2007</a>). Depleted Tet-RLI1 cells expressing single cysteine mutants of <i>RLI1</i> were viable under anaerobic but not aerobic conditions (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>, middle rows). In contrast, the <i>RLI1</i> double mutation rendered cells inviable under both conditions (bottom row). These results show that single mutations of <i>RLI1</i> surprisingly support WT growth under anaerobic conditions (see also [<a href=\"#bib76\">Zhai et al., 2014</a>] for the C25S mutation), apparently because Fe-S cluster binding to these Rli1 proteins is maintained despite the loss of one cluster coordination site. Such a behavior is not unusual for Fe-S proteins (<a href=\"#bib71\">Urzica et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Netz et al., 2012a</a>, <a href=\"#bib44\">2012b</a>). Under aerobic conditions, and even more so in the presence of oxidants (<a href=\"#bib1\">Alhebshi et al., 2012</a>), the Rli1 cluster binding stability is too low to sustain growth. The observed higher stability of the Rli1 Fe-S clusters in the absence of oxygen may readily explain the non-essentiality of Yae1 and Lto1, also indicating that their requirement in Fe-S cluster insertion into Rli1 can be bypassed to some extent under anaerobic conditions."

Their function is unique, because, unlike the previously identified CIA proteins, these components do not act as general Fe-S maturation factors. Rather, they function downstream of the known CIA proteins by specifically assembling the essential Fe-S protein Rli1. Our findings allowed us to expand the current model of CIA (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>) (<a href=\"#bib46\">Paul and Lill, 2014</a>). Yae1 and Lto1 form a complex that acts as a dedicated adaptor to recruit Rli1 to the late-acting part of the CIA machinery. This model was derived from the interaction of Yae1-Lto1 with both the CIA targeting complex (Cia1-Cia2-Mms19) and the Rli1 client. The high target specificity of Yae1-Lto1 is further documented by the fact that the complex is also dispensable for the maturation of Fe-S cluster-containing CIA proteins such as Nbp35 and Nar1. Yae1 and Lto1 perform non-overlapping, individual functions, since even upon overexpression they cannot mutually complement each other, despite some relationship in amino acid sequence (see below). Nevertheless, their function is conserved in higher eukaryotes as the human proteins YAE1D1 and ORAOV1 can substitute their yeast counterparts, but only when co-expressed, again documenting the function as a complex. Collectively, these data demonstrate that the Yae1-Lto1 complex acts as a conserved specificity factor for Fe-S cluster maturation of the highly conserved eukaryotic protein Rli1 (human ABCE1)."

First, a [4Fe-4S] cluster is assembled on the scaffold protein complex composed of Cfd1-Nbp35. This reaction depends on a yet unknown sulfur-containing compound (X-S) which is produced by the mitochondrial iron-sulfur cluster (ISC) assembly machinery and is exported by the mitochondrial ABC transporter Atm1 to the cytosol. Further, the electron transfer chain NADPH-Tah18-Dre2 is required. The Grx3-Grx4 complex mediates a yet undefined function, possibly in delivering iron, for cytosolic-nuclear Fe-S protein biogenesis. Second, the newly assembled [4Fe-4S] cluster is released from Cfd1-Nbp35 and inserted into target apoproteins via Nar1 and the CIA targeting complex (Cia1-Cia2-Mms19). The precise mechanism of the latter steps in still unclear. As reported in this study, maturation of the essential Fe-S protein Rli1 additionally depends on the function of the two specific adaptor proteins Yae1 and Lto1. The Yae1-Lto1 complex uses a unique binding cascade to recruit Rli1 to the CIA targeting complex for Fe-S cluster insertion. The CIA targeting complex interacts with the conserved C-terminal tryptophan residue (W) of Lto1; the conserved deca-GX<sub>3</sub> motifs (yellow boxes) of Yae1-Lto1 are crucial for their complex formation; and Yae1 associates with Rli1. Such an adaptor function is dispensable in the maturation pathway of the virus-induced Fe-S protein viperin because it directly binds to the CIA targeting complex via its conserved C-terminal tryptophan residue."

A similar, but shorter \u2018GX<sub>3</sub>G\u2019 motif has been recognized in a number of membrane proteins, where the GX<sub>3</sub>G motif forms trans-membrane helix dimerization by inter-helical hydrogen bonds (<a href=\"#bib57\">Senes et al., 2004</a>). The function of the deca-GX<sub>3</sub> motif has not been explored until now, but we speculate that it serves a role in Yae1-Lto1 heterodimer formation as in membrane proteins. The deca-GX<sub>3</sub> motif is also found in bacterial FliH, a protein involved in the assembly and substrate export of flagella (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bai et al., 2014</a>). FliH forms a dimer and transiently binds to the ATPase FliI. Bacterial FliI is similar in structure to the \u03b1\u03b2-subunits of F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>0</sub> ATPase and hence not related to the ABC-type ATPase Rli1, leaving open any functional relevance of the deca-GX<sub>3</sub> protein\u2014ATPase interaction. Our Lto1 mutational studies demonstrated that the deca-GX<sub>3</sub> motif is functionally important for Yae1-Lto1 complex formation, and consequently for complex interaction with the CIA machinery (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). Exchanges of conserved glycine residues of Lto1, for instance in the middle and C-terminal parts of the deca-GX<sub>3</sub> motif, strongly affected its association with both Yae1 and the CIA targeting complex, thus explaining the strongly impaired efficiency of these Lto1 variants to support Fe-S cluster assembly on Rli1. In contrast, mutation of two N-terminal glycine residues caused only moderate effects on complex formation and Rli1 maturation suggesting some residual function of this disrupted deca-GX<sub>3</sub> motif."

The decreased Fe-S cluster assembly of Rli1 observed for this Lto1 W \u2192 A mutation is therefore best explained by the weakened contact of Lto1 to the CIA machinery thus limiting the recruitment of the Rli1 client (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). In summary, our mutational studies strongly suggest a model for Yae1-Lto1 acting as a dedicated adaptor complex mediating the contacts between the CIA targeting complex and Rli1. The CIA targeting complex binds Lto1 via its C-terminal W, the two deca-GX<sub>3</sub> motifs are crucial for Yae1-Lto1 complex formation, and, as shown earlier (<a href=\"#bib76\">Zhai et al., 2014</a>), Yae1 mediates the contact to Rli1 (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). This chain of binding events facilitates efficient Rli1 maturation. Interestingly, a characteristically different but related maturation strategy is followed by the radical SAM Fe-S protein viperin, an interferon-induced antiviral defense component (<a href=\"#bib70\">Upadhyay et al., 2014</a>). This protein uses its conserved C-terminal tryptophan to directly associate with the CIA targeting complex. Removal of this residue abolishes complex formation with the CIA targeting complex, assembly of viperin's Fe-S cluster, and consequently antiviral function. The presence of a tryptophan at the viperin C-terminus thus renders an adaptor function like that of Yae1-Lto1 dispensable."

For all these functions, its two Fe-S clusters are essential (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kispal et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Khoshnevis et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Barthelme et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Becker et al., 2012</a>).

We designed an experimental approach that allowed us to test the potential stabilizing function of Yae1-Lto1 for the Rli1 Fe-S clusters. This involved the combination of blue light-induced rapid degradation of Yae1 and the estimation of the Fe-S cluster stability of radiolabeled Rli1. Depletion of Yae1 by blue light exposure diminished de novo Fe-S cluster assembly of Rli1, yet did not affect the stability of the clusters, clearly documenting that Yae1 (and presumably Lto1) function as maturation rather than stabilization factors for Rli1. This maturation function is particularly needed under oxidative conditions to generate enough functional Rli1 to support normal growth. In contrast, under anaerobic conditions both <i>YAE1</i> and <i>LTO1</i> are dispensable for normal growth ([<a href=\"#bib61\">Snoek and Steensma, 2006</a>]; this work), indicating that their function can be bypassed to some extent in the absence of oxidative stress. Nevertheless, as documented by our radiolabeling assay these proteins are still beneficial for Rli1 maturation under anaerobic conditions. The decreased need to (re-)generate damaged Fe-S clusters of Rli1 may render them dispensable. These findings are fully consistent with a recent study concluding that the oxygen sensitivity of Rli1 is best explained by affecting Fe-S cluster synthesis and/or transfer steps rather than the Rli1 Fe-S cluster stability (<a href=\"#bib1\">Alhebshi et al., 2012</a>). This view nicely fits to the observation that <i>RLI1</i> functions as a high copy suppressor of <i>LTO1</i> mutations (<a href=\"#bib76\">Zhai et al., 2014</a>). Collectively, the sum of these studies suggest that Yae1-Lto1 largely increase the efficiency of Rli1 maturation, in particular under aerobic conditions, yet in the absence of oxygen these factors can be bypassed to some extent without losing cell viability."

Similarly, <i>E. coli</i> ErpA is essential for Fe-S cluster maturation of isoprenoid biosynthesis enzymes under aerobic conditions, but can be replaced by IscA under anaerobiosis (<a href=\"#bib73\">Vinella et al., 2009</a>). As a second example, the bacterial NfuA protein functions as a Fe-S cluster transfer protein that is essential for maturation of dedicated Fe-S proteins such as aconitase particularly in the presence of oxygen or oxidative stress conditions, yet can be bypassed under low oxygen conditions (<a href=\"#bib2\">Angelini et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bandyopadhyay et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Py et al., 2012</a>).

Protein pellets were resuspended in trypsin solution (30 \u00b5l of 10% acetonitrile (ACN), 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate (Ambic), and 0.025 \u00b5g trypsin) and digested at 37\u00b0C overnight. Digestion was stopped by addition of 30 \u00b5l of 50% ACN in 5% formic acid (FA). Peptide solutions were dried in a speed vac and resuspended in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid for StageTIP purification (<a href=\"#bib51\">Rappsilber et al., 2007</a>). StageTIPs were prepared with 2 layers of 3 M Empore C18 membranes. Peptides were eluted with 40 \u00b5l of 50% ACN in 1% acetic acid and dried in a speed vac prior to MS analysis. After resuspension in 20 \u00b5l of 5% ACN in 5% FA, 10% of each sample were analyzed by LC-MS/MS during a 45 min gradient by reversed-phase chromatography coupled to an LTQ-Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) in Higher Energy Collision Dissociation mode. Peak lists were extracted using MaxQuant (version 1.1.1.36) (<a href=\"#bib15\">Cox and Mann, 2008</a>) and submitted to Mascot 2.2.03 (<a href=\"http://www.matrixscience.com/\">www.matrixscience.com</a>) searches against the yeast SGD protein database including common contaminants, with carbamidomethylation (C) as a fixed modification, oxidation (M), as well as deamidation (N, Q) and protein N-terminal acetylation as variable modifications.

This algorithm assigns a confidence score to the probability of observing a true interaction using Poisson distributions. In order to assess the dependency of the observed interactions to changes in the SAINT parameters, we applied the SAINT algorithm by using a range of different parameters, for example, the average confidence score threshold (0.8\u20130.95 in steps of 0.01, range taken from <a href=\"#bib13\">Choi et al. (2011)</a>), Mascot scores (10\u201350 in steps of 10), with or without taking extremely high counts into account, and with or without normalization for spectral counts. In total, we had 320 parameter combinations. By varying these parameters we then counted the number of times that we observed an interaction against the number of variations, thus giving a fraction between 0 and 1 for each bait-prey pair. We only considered interactions that have been assigned an average SAINT score above 0.8 in at least one of the parameter sets. We then built a network with interactions of high (\u22650.5) and low (&lt;0.5) robustness, that is, resistance or sensitivity to variations in SAINT parameters. To support our findings and to expand our network of observed bait-prey interactions, we integrated data from the STRING database (<a href=\"#bib66\">Szklarczyk et al., 2011</a>). For interactions observed in our screen, we kept all experimental STRING data without a confidence score threshold. For additional STRING interactions, we only considered experimentally observed interactions with the highest predefined STRING confidence score (0.9)."

This is in contrast to the findings for the Gal-YAE1 strain, and the fact that both genes are essential for cell viability. Upon examination of the reason for the lack of a growth defect, we suspected that the Gal-LTO1<sup>long</sup> strain did not allow a critical reduction of the Lto1 protein. A combination of bioinformatic, cell biological and biochemical analyses provided clear information that the reason for this observation was an erroneous translation start site for <i>LTO1</i>. As summarized in detail below the correct physiological start site of the <i>LTO1</i> gene is located 108 bp downstream of the annotated start codon (ATG3 in <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>)."

Inspection of the <i>S. cerevisiae</i> Lto1 protein sequence suggested another putative translation start site for Lto1 (residue Met37 corresponding to codon ATG3; <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>) which roughly matches the N-termini of the other Lto1 homologs. Ribosome foot-printing data (<a href=\"#bib25\">Ingolia et al., 2009</a>) supported that the actively translated region of the <i>LTO1</i> mRNA does not encompass the N-terminal extension of 36 residues (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>). To directly test the importance of the N-terminal 36 residues, we created a <i>LTO1</i> mutant in which the <i>GALL</i> promoter was inserted right in front of ATG3. This mutant strain (termed Gal-LTO1) showed normal growth on galactose-containing medium demonstrating that the N-terminal 36 residue extension of Lto1 is not critical for cell viability (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). Conspicuously, the Gal-LTO1 cells were unable to grow on glucose-containing medium suggesting efficient depletion of Lto1, unlike that seen for Gal-LTO1<sup>long</sup> cells."

These proteins and the non-mutated Lto1 were expressed from a centromeric plasmid under control of the endogenous promoter in Gal-LTO1 cells grown with galactose or glucose. Both <i>LTO1</i> mutations did not affect cell growth. This result clearly documented that the N-terminal segment of Lto1 including its previously proposed start methionine is not essential suggesting that ATG3 rather than ATG1 is the physiologically correct translation start site (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>). To further support this conclusion, we analyzed the importance of the DNA region between codon ATG1 and ATG3 for <i>LTO1</i> expression efficiency. To this end, we fused different DNA segments of the <i>LTO1</i> gene in front of the luciferase reporter gene (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3C</a>). The fusion constructs were transformed in WT yeast cells and the luciferase-based luminescence was recorded as a measure of <i>LTO1</i> promoter efficiency. Any truncation within the ATG1-ATG3 segment strongly impaired the transcriptional activity suggesting that this region has gene regulatory rather than coding function. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that the physiological start site of <i>LTO1</i> is located 108 bp downstream of the previously annotated start codon."

                    "text": "Iron-sulfur clusters are simple inorganic structures that are essential prosthetic groups contained in a variety of proteins. The maturation of proteins that contain Fe-S clusters is complicated, probably because free forms of both iron and sulfur are toxic, and Fe-S clusters contained in many proteins are highly sensitive to oxygen. Fundamental aspects of Fe-S protein maturation involve the separate formation of Fe-S clusters on an assembly scaffold and the subsequent delivery of clusters to a variety of \u201cclient\u201d proteins. The manuscript by Paul et al. describes the functional analysis of two cytosolic iron sulfur cluster assembly (CIA) factors, Lto1 and Yae1 that are involved in the specialized delivery of Fe-S clusters to a specific client. Namely, these proteins are shown to be dedicated specificity factors for assembly of the Fe-S clusters contained in Rli1, a protein essential for ribosome function in yeast. The authors provide evidence that depletion of either Lto1 or Yae1 causes a specific loss in maturation of Rli1 but not in maturation of other cytosolic or nuclear Fe-S proteins. It is shown that Lto1/Yae1 form a complex that interacts with the CIA targeting complex. It is also demonstrated that Lto1/Yae1 are involved in cluster delivery for maturation of Rli1, rather than stability of the nascent clusters post maturation. The unique (for eukaryotes) deca-GX3 motif in both Lto1 and Yae1 is shown to facilitate their interaction while a conserved tryptophan in Yae1 is needed for recruitment of the target Rli1. Evolutionary conservation of the function of Yae1 and Lto1 is shown via the demonstration that their function in yeast can be replaced by the human orthologues YAED1 and ORAOV1. It is not yet fully understood why there is a dedicated system for the terminal stage in Rli1 maturation, but this could be related to a particular oxygen sensitivity of its associated clusters."

The analysis of this aspect by immunoblotting was restricted to the detection of Yae1 because we did not succeed in creating an efficient Lto1 antibody. This may be due to the relatively low abundance of both Yae1 and Lto1 in yeast cells (cf. Ghaemmaghami et al. (2003) Nature 425, 737). As published previously (by systematic yeast strain analyses described in Steensma 2006, and reproduced by <a href=\"#bib76\">Zhai et al. 2014</a>), the <i>YAE1</i> and <i>LTO1</i> genes can be deleted without the loss of cell viability under anaerobic conditions. This finding is mimicked by using the GAL promoter strains, and clearly indicates that a low efficiency bypass of the newly identified adapter function of Yae1-Lto1 must exist (even under gene deletion situations), yet only under anaerobic conditions where the maturation process is not negatively influenced by oxygen toxicity."

The resulting slightly higher residual amount of protein still allows some growth of depleted cells (as opposed to the <i>GAL</i> situation). We therefore have added cycloheximide to block the re-synthesis of Yae1 during the light exposure period. This trick (introduced by <a href=\"#bib52\">Renicke et al., 2013</a>) enhanced the defects of protein depletion (compare immunoblots in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a> with ) and <sup>55</sup>Fe association with Rli1. This issue is now better mentioned in revised text. In the growth plates, such a trick cannot be used, of course. We have tried to improve our text to make this complex issue clear."

When we deplete CIA proteins in general, we observe that the amount of immediate partner(s) of the depleted CIA protein is also decreased. This is very much the case for the components of the CIA targeting complex, i.e. Cia1, Cia2, and Mms19 which act as a platform for Fe-S cluster insertion (see <a href=\"#fig10\">Author response image 2</a>). Since the entire late-acting CIA targeting complex is falling apart when one constituent is absent, we expected that this instability may render the interpretation of such experiments difficult or impossible. Nevertheless, we now have performed the suggested Cia1-depletion experiment (see <a href=\"#fig11\">Author response image 3</a>). The outcome of the experiment (to our surprise) confirmed the results of the Nbp35 depletion. However, the amount of Rli1 co-precipitating with Yae1 and Lto1 was reduced, and the interaction analysis was much less specific. This likely is the consequence of the dissociation of the CIA targeting complex as discussed above."
