This ambiguity introduces folding challenges that are met by a complex maturation process. We have investigated this conformational maturation using NMR studies of methyl-labeled RT for the slower processes in combination with molecular dynamics simulations for rapid processes. Starting from an inactive conformation, the p66 precursor undergoes a unimolecular isomerization to a structure similar to its active form, exposing a large hydrophobic surface that facilitates initial homodimer formation. The resulting p66/p66' homodimer exists as a conformational heterodimer, after which a series of conformational adjustments on different time scales can be observed. Formation of the inter-subunit RH:thumb' interface occurs at an early stage, while maturation of the connection' and unfolding of the RH' domains are linked and occur on a much slower time scale."

This ambiguity introduces folding challenges that are met by a complex maturation process. We have investigated this conformational maturation using NMR studies of methyl-labeled RT for the slower processes in combination with molecular dynamics simulations for rapid processes. Starting from an inactive conformation, the p66 precursor undergoes a unimolecular isomerization to a structure similar to its active form, exposing a large hydrophobic surface that facilitates initial homodimer formation. The resulting p66/p66' homodimer exists as a conformational heterodimer, after which a series of conformational adjustments on different time scales can be observed. Formation of the inter-subunit RH:thumb' interface occurs at an early stage, while maturation of the connection' and unfolding of the RH' domains are linked and occur on a much slower time scale."

The analysis revealed the shape of a single p66 protein molecule, and showed that occasional changes in shape allow one p66 molecule to bind to a second. This means that an immature version of reverse transcriptase contains two p66 subunits with different shapes. The shapes of each of the two subunits then undergo further changes with time. In one of the subunits, competing interactions lead to a molecular tug-of-war that prevents part of the protein from adopting its folded shape. This part subsequently unravels and is later destroyed by another HIV enzyme (called HIV protease) to form the smaller p51 subunit."

Currently, all of the drugs in clinical use target the mature RT p66/p51 heterodimer, however, a single p66 peptide chain functions as the precursor for each subunit of the RT heterodimer, requiring a complex maturation process that includes subunit-selective elimination of a single ribonuclease H (RH) domain. The need for such a process is a consequence of a metamorphic polymerase domain that is able to adopt different structures in each RT subunit, allowing it to fulfill two different functional roles. The metamorphic polymerase domain reduces the need for additional coding sequences in the HIV gene, consistent with evolutionary pressures on the size of the RNA viral genome (<a href=\"#bib5\">Belshaw et al., 2007</a>), while requiring a more complex structural maturation process. Hypotheses for the formation and maturation of the RT homodimer include proposals in which RH domain proteolysis precedes heterodimer formation (<a href=\"#bib25\">Srivastava et al., 2006</a>), models in which p66 forms an initially symmetric homodimer followed by RH domain unfolding leading to an asymmetric homodimer (<a href=\"#bib2\">Anderson and Coleman, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Abram and Parniak, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Sharaf et al., 2014</a>), and models in which an initially formed asymmetric homodimer leads to partial RH domain unfolding (<a href=\"#bib14\">Hostomska et al., 1991</a>). Until recently, no detailed structural data were available for the p66 monomer and very little structural evidence was available to support or refute any of the above models. Not only does this represent a significant gap in understanding the behavior of an important viral enzyme but also the intermediates involved in heterodimer formation provide potentially useful targets for the development of new interventional strategies."

The p66 monomer is the substrate for dimerization, and thus, provides the starting point for analysis of p66/p66' dimer formation and subsequent conformational changes. Structural comparisons of the RT subunits and the p51 monomer indicate that the most significant conformational variations are observed for the palm thumb connecting segment (residues 212\u2013240) and for the connection domain. However, information for the connection domain has been particularly limited by the fact that it has not been possible to study it in isolation."

Mutagenesis-based assignments of the isoleucine \u03b4-methyl resonances arising from the connection domains provide a more complete description of the changes taking place in this highly plastic region of the protein. This information also provides insight into the coordinated changes that link conformational maturation of the p66' connection' domain to RH' unfolding. We also report molecular dynamics simulations for some of the early isomerization events not directly accessible to our NMR measurements. Using our recently introduced isomerization-restricted p66 mutant, we also demonstrate subunit-selective labeling, which allows us to the study the conformational maturation of the p66' subunit of RT without additional resonances from the p66 subunit, greatly reducing the resonance overlap problem. Although the selective labeling/NMR detection strategies utilized cannot provide an atomic-level description of the entire conformational maturation process, they provide localized snapshots of the environment of the labeled residues that allow us to evaluate specific models for this process, much as crystal structures provide snapshots corresponding to different stages of an enzyme-catalyzed transformation. These studies provide a more complete description of the complex conformational maturation processes leading to formation of the p66/p51 RT heterodimer."

Individual resonances can then be identified as <i>M</i>, <i>E</i>, or <i>C</i> indicating the conformational species to which they correspond.

There are subsequently a number of conformational adjustments within the dimer, culminating with irreversible RH' unfolding, that complete the conformational maturation process to produce the mature p66<i>E</i>/p66<i>C</i> homodimer. The p66<i>E</i>/p66<i>C</i> structure is equivalent to an RT heterodimer structure in which all residues on the p66<i>C</i> subunit after \u223c430 are disordered, exposing the major proteolysis site as well as additional sites susceptible to HIV-1 PR cleavage."

A key structural feature of the monomer, represented in the upper left hand corner, is the absence of most interface contacts; only the interface between the discontinuous fingers/palm and the connection remains. Thus, the necessary domain rearrangements required for conformational isomerization are more easily accomplished than would be the case if the process began from either the <i>E</i> or <i>C</i> conformational states. The unimolecular isomerization of the p66 monomer depicted in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> requires only the occasional dissociation of the fingers/palm:connection interface. Another important feature of the initial homodimer is that the inter-subunit RH:thumb' interface is not present. The absence of this interface provides ample room for accommodation of the supernumerary RH' domain that is present in the initial homodimer. A third feature of the process represented in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> is that the detailed interactions between the two connection domains that are present in the mature RT heterodimer are not yet fully realized in the initial dimer structure. Rather, we suggest that the initial structure is more dependent on non-specific hydrophobic stabilization involving residues on the two connection domains. Since many of the early conformational transitions corresponding to the first two equilibria in <a href=\"#equ1 equ2 equ3\">Equation 1</a> are not directly accessible to the NMR methods used in the present study, we utilized our palm loop deletion mutant as well as molecular dynamics simulations to further probe these initial events."

Both structures correspond to NNRTI-RT complexes. In 3QIP, helix \u03b1M' adopts a more standard geometry, with five strong hydrogen bonds (\u22643.2 \u00c5), while the helix in 1SV5 has only one strong hydrogen bond and adopts a more extended conformation in which Tyr427 is at the position of Gln426 in the 3QIP structure. These alternate conformations correspond to an alternate set of interactions within the p51 subunit. A similar conclusion supporting a conformational mixture also results from re-analysis of the electron density for some individual structures (not shown). The ability of the helix to adopt alternate registrations results from the fact that nearly all of the residues are hydrophobic. The ability of \u03b1M' to adopt these conformations facilitates transfer of residues from the RH' domain, allowing recruitment of Tyr427' by the connection' domain when thermal fluctuations release it from RH'."

A structural comparison of the fingers/palm in an isolated construct (RT216, pdb: 1HAR) (<a href=\"#bib27\">Unge et al., 1994</a>), the p51\u2206PL monomer (pdb: 4KSE) (<a href=\"#bib33\">Zheng et al., 2014</a>), the p51 and p66 subunits of RT (pdb: 1DLO) (<a href=\"#bib14a\">Hsiou et al., 1996</a>) reveals significant differences. This variation is most conveniently characterized by the angle between the approximately coplanar helices A (residues 28\u201343) in the fingers and F (residues 194\u2013211) in the palm (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). In both the monomer and the p51 subunit of RT, this angle is \u223c45\u00b0. By comparison, in the isolated RT216 construct or the p66 subunit of RT, the angle is more obtuse, with values of 90\u00b0\u2013100\u00b0. Importantly, in both of the structures with the more acute angle, there is a large interface between the fingers/palm and the connection domains. In contrast, for both of the structures lacking this interface, the angle defined by helices A\u2013F is much more open. This correlation suggests that the conformation with the more acute fingers/palm angle may be stabilized by the inter-domain interactions between the fingers/palm and the connection domains."

Starting structures included residues 1\u2013236 for the p66 and p51 subunits of apo RT (pdb: 1DLO). As discussed in \u2018Materials and methods\u2019, the missing p51 segment from 219\u2013230 was modeled by introducing the corresponding segment from the p66 subunit. The fingers/palm \u03b1<sub>AF</sub> angle was determined as a function of time after removal of all other domains. Simulations for the isolated fingers/palm starting with either the p66 or the p51 conformations are shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>. As indicated in the figure, the more open conformation present in the p66 subunit (red line) is stable over the time period of the simulation. Alternatively, the simulation beginning with the fingers/palm in the p51 subunit (black line) indicates that between \u223c35 and 45 ns the \u03b1<sub>AF</sub> angle undergoes a transition from its initial acute value to \u223c90\u00b0. This result is consistent with an intrinsic preference for the open conformation observed in the crystal structure of the isolated fingers/palm construct, RT216 (pdb: 1HAR). Analogous simulations starting with the monomer structure (pdb: 4KSE) or with the p51 subunit of an RT-inhibitor complex containing the missing loop residues (pdb: 1S9E) produced qualitatively similar results, with the most significant variation related to the time at which the transition to the more extended conformation occurs (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

Thus, although the final fingers/palm conformation produced by the simulations is similar to that observed in the p66 subunit of RT, the conformations of residues located at the domain boundaries do not agree with those in p66. The simulations are thus consistent with the general conclusion that the conformations of domain boundary residues depend on inter-domain interactions. This conclusion applies to residues in the palm loop, which fail to form strands of the larger \u03b2-sheet formed from palm and thumb residues."

The large fingers/palm:connection interface of \u223c1470 \u00c5<sup>2</sup> in the p51 subunit of RT includes extensive hydrophobic contacts (<a href=\"#bib10\">Ding et al., 1994</a>).

In the active, p66<i>E</i> subunit of RT, this same group of hydrophobic residues in the palm domain interacts directly with residues from the palm loop (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), which in the <i>E</i> conformation become part of the functionally important primer grip that positions the primer terminus for catalysis (<a href=\"#bib12\">Ghosh et al., 1996</a>). Formation of alternate, intra-domain hydrophobic contacts by residues of the palm loop/primer grip can thus tend to interfere with re-association of the fingers/palm and connection domains, thereby enhancing the availability of the connection domain for intermolecular association with the monomer (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Further, these residues also form part of the binding site for non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). This is a highly flexible region of the protein in which the NNRTI binding site is not identifiable in the absence of a bound inhibitor, and hence, is likely to be able to rapidly form intra-domain hydrophobic contacts that can inhibit connection domain re-association."

The p51 spectrum was obtained in D<sub>2</sub>O buffer, 25 mM Tris-d11, pD 7.5, 0.02 % NaN<sub>3</sub> that also contained 800 mM KCl and 20 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> in order to convert most of the p51 to the dimeric form. Some monomer resonances are apparent in both spectra, however, in the p66/p66' sample, these resonances decay, while in the p51/p51' spectrum they are constant. A resonance labeled [375M] likely arises from Ile375 in the monomer, however, the shift at high salt differs from the shift observed in the monomer, so this assignment is only suggested.

In each of these cases, the misassigned resonances corresponded to residues positioned very near the mutated residues.

We thus utilized extensive site-directed mutagenesis as the basis for making these assignments in the p66 subunit of the RT heterodimer. Although this method provided a basis for many of the assignments, it also proved problematical for assigning some of the closely positioned methyl resonances such as those arising from Ile329 and Ile375. Overall, in addition to the Ile \u2192 Val mutants, we also utilized several \u2018nudge\u2019 mutations, which helped to resolve assignment ambiguities. These included S379C (to assign Ile341), Y342H (to assign Ile326), and H361Y (to assign RH domain resonances Ile522, Ile505, and Ile526 located near the connection:RH domain interface. Ultimately, the strategy used was aimed at obtaining a set of self-consistent assignments allowing us to overcome the limitations of individual substitutions, which in a few cases led to ambiguous results.

The connection domain H361Y nudge mutation allows further assignment of residues located at the RH interface. A schematic figure showing the relative positions of H361, Ile505, Ile522, and Ile526 is shown in the lower right hand corner of the spectrum. Ile522, located 3.5 \u00c5 from His361 imidazole C1 and N2, is not observed, due either to broadening or to a shift to the densely populated spectral region, and Ile526 and Ile521 exhibit small shift perturbations. We note further that the assignment of Ile505 is consistent with the perturbation of this resonance observed previously in the presence of an active site RH domain ligand (see Figure 4b of <a href=\"#bib32\">Zheng et al., 2012</a>), and its relative proximity to the RH active site, as well as with the upfield shift of this resonance predicted by SHIFTX analysis. Not unexpectedly, the resonance perturbations resulting from the H361Y mutation are very similar (although not identical) to the perturbations resulting from the I522V mutation, shown in the previous supplemental figure."

The I375V mutation eliminated two connection domain resonances, consistent with the 3.4 \u00c5 separation of the \u03b4-methyl groups of Ile375 and Ile329, indicating that Ile329 also experiences a major shift perturbation. We have now been able to make more specific assignments to Ile375 and Ile329 based on the effects of other nearby mutations, particularly I341V (<a href=\"#fig5s5\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 5</a>), which perturbs the closer Ile375 resonance without affecting the Ile329 resonance, as well as the relative perturbations produced by S379C (<a href=\"#fig5s13\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 13</a>).

We, thus, conclude that the conformation of the p51 subunit of the p51/p51' homodimer can be characterized as adopting a p51<i>E</i>-like conformation, that is, similar to the p66 conformation of the heterodimer but lacking an RH domain. In contrast, the conformation of the p51' subunit of the homodimer is more difficult to characterize. In some cases, for example, Ile202' and Ile47', the resonances are in close agreement with those of the p51<i>C</i> subunit of the RT heterodimer (blue spectrum), while in other cases, for example, Ile274', Ile329', and Ile375', resonances near the positions expected for p51<i>C</i> are not observed (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). The resonance of Ile274' from the thumb' domain is at the position of p51<i>M</i> rather than p51<i>C</i>, and the connection' Ile329' and Ile375' resonances are not readily observed, as is the case with the monomer. This behavior indicates that formation of the p51/p51' dimer leads to shifts in the fingers'/palm' that are consistent with dimer formation, while several of the p51' thumb' and connection' domain resonances more closely approximate the pattern of the p51 monomer. We conclude that the NMR data support a homodimer model in which the p51 subunit approximates the p66 RT subunit without an RH domain, while the p51' subunit conformation approximates that of the p51 monomer that includes a disordered thumb' and disordered C-terminal \u03b1M' residues (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a> schematic and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Apparently, the interactions between helix \u03b1M' and the thumb' are insufficient to stabilize a p51<i>C</i> conformation similar to that observed in the heterodimer, indicating that the additional interactions with the RH domain are required for this conformation to be significantly populated."

The strategy presented below compares the Ile shifts in the p66 subunit of the wt RT heterodimer with the shifts in a mutant heterodimer containing a p51 thumb' mutation positioned at the interface with RH. Specifically, residue Leu289 on the p51 subunit interacts with a hydrophobic pocket on the p66 RH domain, so the non-conservative p51(L289K) mutant should significantly disrupt the structure of this interface in the p66/p51(L289K) heterodimer.

Based on the behavior of the Ile382<i>E</i> resonance, this interface is formed at a sufficiently early stage so that it is largely present during the first 2D <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>13</sup>C HMQC accumulation period of 5.5 hr. Analysis of the time-dependent data gave a time constant of 2.4 \u00b1 0.2 hr (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>), consistent with a relatively early formation of this portion of the interface involving the connection and fingers' domains. This conclusion also follows from the time-dependent behavior of the Ile47' resonance discussed above."

This model was supported by the decay of several resonances that could be assigned specifically to the RH' domain (<a href=\"#bib33\">Zheng et al., 2014</a>). The more complete assignments of the connection domain included with the present study (<a href=\"#fig5s10 fig5s11 fig5s12 fig5s13 fig5s14 fig5s15 fig5s3 fig5s4 fig5s5 fig5s6 fig5s7 fig5s8 fig5s9\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplements 3\u201315</a>) provide further substantiation of this hypothesis. The Ile329 and Ile375 resonances are particularly useful for analysis of connection domain conformational processes since they are well resolved and give unique signals characteristic of the <i>E</i> and <i>C</i> conformations. These resonances are also not readily observed in the monomers, probably as a result of exchange broadening (although a broad resonance in the general region of Ile375 may correspond to this residue). The I375V mutation eliminates both the Ile375 and Ile329 resonances as a consequence of the proximity of these two residues (\u03b4CH<sub>3</sub>(Ile329)-\u03b4CH<sub>3</sub>(Ile375) = 3.4 \u00c5 in 1DLO) (<a href=\"#fig5s14\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 14</a>). The spectrum of the mature p66(I375V)/p66'(I375'V) homodimer (<a href=\"#fig5s15\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 15</a>) shows the same two missing resonances arising from the p66 subunit and also identifies two additional perturbed resonances that we assign to the corresponding residues in the p66' subunit of the homodimer."

Consistent with the behavior summarized above, the three resonances assigned to residues in the p66 subunit: Ile329<i>E</i>, Ile375<i>E</i>, and Ile434<i>E</i> are approaching their equilibrium intensities during the first NMR accumulation. During the subsequent accumulation periods, the Ile434<i>C</i> resonance, which contains contributions from both the p66' subunit of the homodimer and from the overlapping Ile434<i>M</i> resonance of the monomer, decays almost completely. The Ile329<i>C</i> and Ile375<i>C</i> resonances arising from the connection' domain of the p66' subunit of the homodimer show gradual intensity gains over this same time period. We attribute these changes to the simultaneous destabilization of RH' and the conformational maturation of the connection' as residues derived from RH' are incorporated into helix \u03b1M'. The temporal linkage of these events is consistent with a model in which they are functionally coupled processes. These occur on a much slower time scale than the conformational processes described in the previous section that include isomerization of the monomer to an <i>E</i>-type conformation, initial formation of the immature homodimer, and formation of the RH:thumb' interface."

Since we have observed no stable monomer in the extended (<i>E</i>) conformation, the time-dependent intensity of the Ile382<i>E</i> resonance arises from the active (extended) p66 subunit of the dimer and is indicative of time-dependent dimerization. The Ile382 time constant of 2.4 hr appears to be the earliest dimerization event that can be monitored by NMR. Since this value is significantly below the time required for accumulation of the NMR spectrum, the value is subject to substantial error, and presumably represents an upper limit for the actual time constant describing interface formation. As in the example of Ile382<i>E</i>, the Ile329<i>E</i> intensity also builds up on a short time scale (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>), corresponding to time constants that are shorter than the NMR accumulation period. Thus, the connection domain in the p66<i>E</i> subunit appears to become conformationally defined at a relatively early time after dimerization.

Thus, as in the homodimerization study, the data demonstrate that formation of the connection' domain is temporally correlated with the disappearance of resonances characteristic of the folded RH'. This observation further supports the maturation of the connection' domain at the expense of the RH' domain. In these studies, none of the resonances uniquely attributed to the <i>E</i> conformation was observed, indicating that the p66\u2206PL subunit of the pseudo-homodimer does not adopt the <i>E</i> conformation to any significant extent.

Due to the more significant effects of the monomer in this study, we have not attempted to introduce a monomer correction, as was done in our previous analysis (<a href=\"#bib33\">Zheng et al., 2014</a>), and instead just fit the data to the simplest mathematical models that provided reasonable approximations. The results, summarized in <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>, indicate that: 1) the initial monomer concentration has decreased by \u223c 40% after which it decays with a time constant of \u223c10 hr based on Ile393M and Ile47M peaks, reaching a limiting level of \u223c20% of the total. 2) the RH' Ile434', Ile495', and Ile521' resonances all decay with similar apparent time constants with a mean value of 10.7 hr, and the connection' Ile329'; and Ile375' resonances increase with similar time constants, kinetically linking these two processes. 3) the Ile47' resonance intensity is divided between monomer and dimer species, Ile47<i>M</i> and Ile47<i>C</i>, so that the time-dependent behavior results from the monomer\u2192 dimer conversion (<a href=\"#fig8s2\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

Subsequent dimerization of p66\u2206PL may require release of p66 monomers from p66/p66' dimers at various stages of conformational maturation, until most of the p66 and p66\u2206PL have formed sufficiently stable dimers so that further release of p66<i>M</i> becomes extremely slow."

This uniformity allows it to adopt alternate registrations in which one hydrophobic residue substitutes for another. This conformational variability is supported by a comparison of multiple crystal structures (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). The ability of the helix to adopt alternate registrations facilitates its victory in the tug-of-war for residues from RH'. Thus, immature, distorted helical conformations can be present that are more consistent with a folded RH' domain, and the helix is then able to recruit and incorporate Tyr427' from RH' when this residue is released from RH' due to thermal fluctuations. Recruitiment of Tyr427' into \u03b1M' results in improved helical geometry and more stable interactions between \u03b1M' and other connection' residues. As shown previously, RH' is significantly destabilized by the loss of Tyr427', facilitating its unfolding and subsequent proteolytic degradation (<a href=\"#bib33\">Zheng et al., 2014</a>)."

The structure of the p66 monomer provides perhaps the most compelling support for a conformational selection model, since most of the domain interfaces are abrogated in the monomer without the need for dimer formation to promote this process. Only the fingers/palm:connection needs to dissociate to allow the necessary reorganization of the domains. The inherent preference of the bent fingers/palm domains to adopt a more extended conformation provides some additional impetus for dissociation of this interface (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). Further support for this model is derived from the effect of the palm loop deletion in blocking dimerization and the molecular dynamics simulations presented above (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). The initially formed homodimer contains two folded RH domains and two immature connection domains. The fingers/palm domains in the two subunits are probably close to their final conformation in the initial homodimer, since the initial isomerization of the monomer to the extended conformation is proposed to be concerted with straightening of the fingers/palm (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). The RH:thumb' interface is not initially present. Based on the analysis of Ile methyl resonances of residues distributed throughout the molecule, slower processes that nevertheless are largely accomplished during the first HMQC accumulation period include: 1) formation of the inter-subunit RH:thumb' interface; 2) maturation of the connection:RH interface; 3) maturation of the p66 connection and thumb subdomains. These conformational steps appear to be cooperative."

Although for some of the resonances analyzed in the p66/p66\u2206PL dimerization study, there is significant overlap between the monomer and dimer species, no correction for this overlap was utilized."

This protein forms dimers, which however, change their conformation to become asymmetric. The authors use MD simulation to obtain insight into the fast events of this conformational changes as well as NMR spectroscopy to follow the slower events. Due to the large size of the proteins investigated only methly group labeling is possible. Overall this is a very interesting study that provides insight into a very important process. The conformational changes in the HIV reverse transcriptase are important from a medical as well as from a basic science view."

For the acceptance in <i>eLife</i> it will therefore be important to clearly focus on the new data and clearly indicate what is new relative to the previous published manuscripts.

This study is focused on a determination of the RT maturation process that converts the initial p66 monomer into the p66/p51 heterodimer, employing NMR and molecular dynamics to provide insights into the individual steps involved. Importantly, since all current RT inhibitors target the mature structure, understanding the maturation process, which can involve more fragile structural intermediates, opens the possibility of interfering with maturation rather than with function, which in principle also eliminates the problem of trying to compete with the substrates for binding. This is a rather complex molecule to evaluate and to describe, but the improved readability was apparent to all who read this revision."

As far as we are aware, there is no direct interaction between the two RH domains, and we did not mean to imply otherwise. We have tried to revise the presentation to further clarify the interactions for which we do find evidence. The intersubunit interaction between the thumb' and the RH domain is, we believe, significant, and is supported most directly by the study utilizing the L289K' mutation in the p51 subunit of RT."

A detailed analysis revealed that although all simulations showed the increased A/F angle (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2013figure supplement 1</a>), the limiting conformations do not uniformly approach the conformation that is observed in the p66 subunit of RT. The approach utilizing truncation of the modeled sequence at residue 236 in order to reveal the intrinsic conformational preferences of the fingers/palm eliminates direct interactions with other domains that are important for determining the fingers/palm conformations at the domain boundaries. Further, we found that although the distance between residues Asp218 and Gly231 that flank the palm loop does increase during the course of the simulations, this change is not associated with formation of the mature primer grip conformation that is present in the p66 subunit of RT. In addition to the absence of inter-domain interactions, termination of the sequence at residue 236, allows the C-terminal residues to adopt a more unconstrained ensemble of positions that are not representative of the full RT molecule. To summarize, we believe that truncation of the sequence after residue 236 is a useful approach for evaluating the intrinsic domain orientation of the fingers/palm. However, the deletion eliminates interactions with other domains that can significantly affect the conformation of residues near the domain boundaries, leading to some artifactual results. In the revised manuscript, in the last paragraph of the subsection entitled \u201cIntrinsic conformational preferences of the fingers/palm\u201d, we have dropped the distance calculation from the paper and added some discussion to clarify what features of the fingers/palm are and are not explained by the simulations."

Prompted in part by the reviewers\u2019 questions, we made an extensive review of the kinetic analysis and for the data in <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>, decided to adopt a more phenomenological approach in which we selected the simplest model that most closely approximated the data and did not try to introduce corrections for resonances in which there is significant monomer/dimer overlap. This decision was based on the fact that in the dimerization study with p66\u2206PL, the there is a relatively large fraction of monomer species, making the correction as large as the measured data, as well as the fact that in subtracting different resonances, it becomes necessary to introduce an arbitrary correction factor to account for differences in relaxation behavior. The revised analysis for Ile47 is particularly informative leading to the conclusion that a more rapid initial dimerization accounting for about 20-30% of the monomer is followed by a slower dimerization reaction with a time constant similar to that of most of the slow time constants that we measure. We also have included multiple examples of the kinetic fits as supplementary figures to <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a> and <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a> to illustrate the quality of the data fits. One other change is that we dropped one of the four data sets used in the homodimerization study, so utilized three rather than the original four studies. In the study that was dropped, the labeling level was significantly decreased due to an error in addition of the labeled precursor, so that the S/N was generally much lower."

According to <a href=\"#bib16\">Kleiman et al. (2010)</a>, the viral core contains a complex formed from tRNALys, 3-annealed viral genome plus reverse transcriptase (see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> of this reference). Formation of this complex will help to stabilize the dimer form and can facilitate maturation. Preliminary NMR studies demonstrate that addition of dsDNA exerts this type of effect. Importantly, formation of this type of complex should not alter the nature of the maturation steps that we have observed, but only help them to occur on a shorter time scale."
