Rodent single-cell recordings suggest the ability of spatially tuned cells to represent subsequent locations. Grid-like representations have been observed in the human entorhinal cortex during virtual and imagined navigation. However, hitherto it remains unknown if grid-like representations contribute to mental simulation in the absence of imagined movement. Participants imagined directions between building locations in a large-scale virtual-reality city while undergoing fMRI without re-exposure to the environment. Using multi-voxel pattern analysis, we provide evidence for representations of absolute imagined direction at a resolution of 30\u00b0 in the parahippocampal gyrus, consistent with the head-direction system. Furthermore, we capitalize on the six-fold rotational symmetry of grid-cell firing to demonstrate a 60\u00b0 periodic pattern-similarity structure in the entorhinal cortex. Our findings imply a role of the entorhinal grid-system in mental simulation and future thinking beyond spatial navigation."

Rodent single-cell recordings suggest the ability of spatially tuned cells to represent subsequent locations. Grid-like representations have been observed in the human entorhinal cortex during virtual and imagined navigation. However, hitherto it remains unknown if grid-like representations contribute to mental simulation in the absence of imagined movement. Participants imagined directions between building locations in a large-scale virtual-reality city while undergoing fMRI without re-exposure to the environment. Using multi-voxel pattern analysis, we provide evidence for representations of absolute imagined direction at a resolution of 30\u00b0 in the parahippocampal gyrus, consistent with the head-direction system. Furthermore, we capitalize on the six-fold rotational symmetry of grid-cell firing to demonstrate a 60\u00b0 periodic pattern-similarity structure in the entorhinal cortex. Our findings imply a role of the entorhinal grid-system in mental simulation and future thinking beyond spatial navigation."

These neurons are known as grid cells because their activity produces a grid-like pattern. A separate group of neurons, called head direction cells, represents the rat\u2019s facing direction. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies that have tracked brain activity in humans as they navigate virtual environments have found similar grid-like and direction-related responses. A recent study showed grid-like responses even if the people being studied just imagined moving around an arena while lying still. Theoretical work suggests that spatially tuned cells might generally be important for our ability to imagine and simulate future events. However, it is not clear whether these location- and direction-responsive cells are active when people do not visualize themselves moving."

Place cells typically exhibit one firing field (<a href=\"#bib37\">O\u2019Keefe and Dostrovsky, 1971</a>), while grid cells are characterized by multiple firing fields arranged in a regular hexagonal pattern tessellating the entire environment (<a href=\"#bib19\">Hafting et al., 2005</a>). Complementarily, directional information is carried by head direction cells, which increase their firing rate as a function of the animal\u2019s directional heading irrespective of its location (<a href=\"#bib45\">Taube et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Taube, 2007</a>).

This is in line with the observation of grid-like representations during imagined movement through an environment (<a href=\"#bib24\">Horner et al., 2016</a>). However, hitherto it remains unknown if grid-like representations support mental simulation independent of imagined movement, which could suggest a more general role of grid cell computations in navigational planning, future anticipation and cognition."

In line with the suggested role for grid cell computations in vector navigation (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bush et al., 2015</a>), we expected the grid-cell system to be involved in determining the vector comprising the direction and distance from the start to the target building in our task. Our approach focused on the direction to the target to track putative grid-cell representations during imagination by systematically comparing neural similarity of imagined directions with varying angular differences (see Materials and methods). We predicted that an involvement of the grid system in mental simulation should be reflected in a 60\u00b0\u00a0periodic pattern-similarity structure in the entorhinal cortex, consistent with the hexagonal firing properties of grid cells (<a href=\"#bib19\">Hafting et al., 2005</a>) and the hexadirectional fMRI signal in entorhinal cortex observed during virtual navigation (<a href=\"#bib13\">Doeller et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Horner et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Kunz et al., 2015</a>).

(<b>c</b>) Based on this, we expected increased pattern similarity when comparing trial pairs from the 0\u00b0 modulo 60\u00b0 condition to trial pairs from the 30\u00b0 modulo 60\u00b0 condition. The difference between the conditions is smaller than in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3c</a> due to the different sampling of directions with respect to the grid orientation."

An alternative explanation of this effect through visual similarity of the imagined views appears unlikely due to the complex nature of the task in which each direction was sampled from multiple locations in our large-scale environment (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) and buildings served as cues for a wider range of sampling directions. Therefore, our finding provides the first evidence for fine-grained coding of absolute direction at an unprecedented angular resolution of 30\u00b0, consistent with the characteristics of the head direction system in rodents (<a href=\"#bib45\">Taube et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Taube, 2007</a>), and constitutes a three-fold increase in resolution of the directional representations observed in humans compared to previous studies (<a href=\"#bib34\">Marchette et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Chadwick et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Baumann and Mattingley, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Vass and Epstein, 2013</a>, <a href=\"#bib48\">2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Shine et al., 2016</a>). Secondly, the structure of pattern similarity in entorhinal cortex was characterized by a six-fold rotational symmetry akin to the firing properties of grid cells (<a href=\"#bib19\">Hafting et al., 2005</a>). Our findings provide evidence for an involvement of grid-like representations in mental simulation in the absence of imagined movement."

Therefore, our findings provide novel evidence, complementary to a recent report (<a href=\"#bib24\">Horner et al., 2016</a>) showing evidence for grid-like entorhinal processing during imagined movement through a simple virtual arena. Furthermore, in contrast, we investigated spatial processing in a large-scale, urban environment (<a href=\"#bib44\">Stokes et al., 2015</a>) and, moreover focused on multi-voxel patterns. In particular, we demonstrate that this novel analysis approach, which does not rely on the estimation of the orientation of the hexadirectional signal in entorhinal cortex in an independent data set (<a href=\"#bib13\">Doeller et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Kunz et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Horner et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Constantinescu et al., 2016</a>), is sensitive to grid-like entorhinal signals by capitalizing on the six-fold symmetry of grid cell firing patterns. Contrary to the previously employed approach relying on the estimation of the orientation of the hexadirectional signal for each participant (<a href=\"#bib13\">Doeller et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Kunz et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Horner et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Constantinescu et al., 2016</a>), the individual grid orientation is not approximated using the multivariate analysis. Yet, the grid orientation might influence the strength of the grid-like entorhinal signal observed in a given participant because the sampled directions might be more or less aligned with this individual\u2019s grid orientation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a\u2013c</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a> for illustration). This needs to be taken into consideration when aiming to relate grid-like signals to behavior. However, only the multivariate approach enabled us to investigate the six-fold rotational symmetry in our large-scale environment, in which a continuous sampling of directions as required for the estimation of the orientation of the hexadirectional signal would not have been feasible. This parsimonious approach might prove valuable for future studies investigating the role of grid-like signals in human cognition, in particular in studies with children (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bullens et al., 2010</a>) or older participants (<a href=\"#bib42\">Schuck et al., 2015</a>) and in clinical settings (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hartley et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Maguire et al., 2001</a>), where time for data acquisition is typically limited and could for instance help to further understand the putative link between the entorhinal grid system and Alzheimer\u2019s disease (<a href=\"#bib30\">Kunz et al., 2015</a>)."

This time period was chosen due to the complex nature of the task, which required the participant to first retrieve the respective buildings and their locations before being able to imagine the direction between them. To rule out a potential influence of brain activity corresponding to the onset of the response screen on the analyzed volumes we conducted a whole-brain searchlight analysis (with the parameters described in detail below), which compared trial pairs with identical visual input at the onset of the response screen to pairs where this visual input differed. Since the initial response screen always showed the start building, trial pairs with the same start location would exhibit increased pattern similarity in brain areas processing visual information if the volumes analyzed contained brain activity corresponding to visual processing. No clusters showed this effect at a significance threshold of p&lt;0.001 uncorrected and a cluster extent threshold of 10 voxels."

Only search spheres including more than 30 voxels were analyzed. Pattern similarity was calculated as the Pearson correlation coefficient across all voxels within a sphere, separately for all possible pairs of trials. To test the hypothesis of increased representational similarity for similar directions, we averaged Fisher z-transformed correlation coefficients for two different conditions: Pairs of trials probing the same direction or directions with an angular difference of 30\u00b0 were contrasted against pairs of trials sampling directions 60\u00b0 or more apart (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a</a>).

Note that participants did not see these images during the task, but were instructed to imagine the views. Five statistics were used to quantify visual features of each image: By computing a two-dimensional discrete Fast-Fourier-Transform we obtained magnitude and phase metrics of the images. Next, the red, green and blue values for each image were converted to CIELAB color space. This color space provides information about the luminance and two color opponent dimensions (red-green and yellow-blue) corresponding to the cone responses of the human retina.

While we did not observe significant differences for the magnitude information or the color dimensions (all Bonferroni-adjusted p&gt;0.2), phase and luminance information of imagined scenes were significantly less similar for comparisons of trials sampling similar directions compared to pairs sampling dissimilar directions in a subset of participants. Specifically, Fisher z-transformed correlations were significantly lower (corrected for 24 comparisons) for image pairs from similar direction trials for twelve participants when considering the phase information (minimum significant T<sub>3838</sub> = \u22123.25; maximum significant T<sub>3838</sub> = \u22124.42) and for six participants when considering luminance information (minimum significant T<sub>3838</sub> = \u22123.11; maximum significant T<sub>3838</sub> = \u22124.70).

Again, RSA was performed on the residuals of a GLM with the motion parameters as predictors. For each ROI, we calculated pattern similarity for all pairs of trials and defined two conditions to compare Fisher z-transformed Pearson correlations coefficients. We hypothesized that a possible influence of grid-cell representations on imagination should be reflected in a 60\u00b0 periodicity of pmEC activity patterns (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a,b</a>\u00a0and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1a,b</a>) analogously to the 60\u00b0 modulation of the amplitude of the BOLD signal observed during navigation (<a href=\"#bib13\">Doeller et al., 2010</a>). Extending this previous method, we pursued a more parsimonious and more powerful multivariate approach, which does not rely on the univariate estimation of a putative grid orientation on an independent dataset (which is only feasible with exhaustive sampling of directions during navigation [<a href=\"#bib13\">Doeller et al., 2010</a>]). Here, pattern similarity in pmEC was expected to be modulated by the angular difference of the directions sampled in a pair of trials (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3c</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1c</a>). To test this hypothesis two conditions were defined based on the modulus 60\u00b0 of the angular difference between the sampled directions in a trial pair (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3d</a>). This remainder of modulus 60\u00b0 could either be 0\u00b0 or 30\u00b0 due to the regular sampling of directions in our paradigm. We calculated the difference in mean pattern similarity between the 0\u00b0 modulo 60\u00b0 and the 30\u00b0 modulo 60\u00b0 condition for each subject. On the group level, we tested for increased pattern similarity in the 0\u00b0 modulo 60\u00b0 condition by comparing these pattern similarity difference values against 0 using a one-tailed one-sample T-test. Reported p-values are Bonferroni corrected for separate comparisons in left and right pmEC. To visualize whether the significant difference observed between the conditions in pmEC reflected a consistent 60\u00b0 modulation of pattern similarity across angular differences, we plotted pattern similarity as a function of angular difference between trials pairs (<a href=\"#fig3s4\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 4</a>)."

Null distributions were obtained by shuffling the trial labels and analyzing the resulting correlation matrix for each of 10,000 permutations.

We assessed whether a distance measure differed between the 0\u00b0 modulo 60\u00b0 and the 30\u00b0 modulo 60\u00b0 condition by testing the difference between the mean distance values of the two conditions against 0 using a one-sample t-test, analogous to our approach in the pattern similarity analysis. The results of these tests are reported in the following paragraphs. In each control analysis, we then computed a GLM with a continuous distance predictor and pairwise Fisher z-transformed correlation coefficients as the criterion. The residuals of these GLMs (i.e. pattern similarity that could not be explained by the distance predictor) were then used to compute the pattern similarity differences between the 0\u00b0 modulo 60\u00b0 and the 30\u00b0 modulo 60\u00b0 condition (<a href=\"#fig3s7\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 7</a>).

Analogous to the 60\u00b0 modulation analysis, we calculated the difference between combined error values in the 0\u00b0 modulo 60\u00b0 and the 30\u00b0 modulo 60\u00b0 condition for each participant on the first level and tested for a difference on the second level using a one-sample t-test. The combined error values were not different between the conditions (T<sub>23</sub> = 1.24, p\u00a0=\u00a00.227, <a href=\"#fig3s8\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 8</a>)."

Namely, the authors aimed to determine whether one could detect a grid representation in the fMRI BOLD signal while study participants carried out a spatial task requiring them to imagine the direction one would need to face to navigate from one place in a virtual environment to another. This is an important area of research as grid cells, in the rodent brain, are thought to underlie navigation and support general mnemonic processes. Moreover, recent theoretical accounts suggest they may be in important for planning future navigation (Bush, Barry et al. (2015)). As such, finding grid representations during navigational simulations would support claims and provide more general insight into how the brain prepares for future behaviour. The study is a theoretically important extension of existing work in this area, suggesting that grid cells are important for general types of cognition, which do not align to current physical movement. The experiment is well designed and introduces new methodology into the field. The inclusion of the many control analyses and visualisations of the constituent parts of the data are helpful towards supporting the reported findings."

The authors acknowledge this in the paper. The reviewers clearly support publication of the current study. First, we believe it contains substantial novelties over the Horner study (explained shortly), and second we appreciate the replication of such an interesting signal in two concurrently run studies. All reviewers, however, were unsure about the authors attempt to disambiguate the two studies by claiming that imagining directions to goals (rather than imagining physical movement) took the study out of the domain of spatial navigation. We agree that it is a different phenomenon. We think that the current study widens the scope of grid-like activity to the domain of navigational planning of the sort that is predicted theoretically in (Bush et al. Neuron 2015). Because the imagined directions could not be directly enacted (because many of them passed through buildings), we also think that the current result implies a global grid-like signal of the sort investigated in (Carpenter et al. Current biology.), but for imagined navigation. We also think that the novel finding of head-direction specific activity in the current manuscript is a potentially important one. We think that the authors could focus on these strengths of the current manuscript, and do not need to rely on the claims about non-spatial processes that are more difficult to justify in a completely spatial experiment."

This is due to the minimal sampling of directions. Essentially, then, the technique is similar to fitting one of sin(6\u03b8) or cos(6\u03b8) and ignoring the other one and taking the absolute values of the betas. Obviously there is a sensitivity gain from pooling over voxels, which may regain much of the sensitivity loss. This is obviously ok, if you find a significant effect, but these issues are not well presented in the manuscript. A naive reader might easily think that there is some magic whereby there is no longer any requirement to know the grid angle. This should be clarified."

The authors acknowledge this in the paper. The reviewers clearly support publication of the current study. First, we believe it contains substantial novelties over the Horner study (explained shortly), and second we appreciate the replication of such an interesting signal in two concurrently run studies. All reviewers, however, were unsure about the authors attempt to disambiguate the two studies by claiming that imagining directions to goals (rather than imagining physical movement) took the study out of the domain of spatial navigation. We agree that it is a different phenomenon. We think that the current study widens the scope of grid-like activity to the domain of navigational planning of the sort that is predicted theoretically in (Bush et al. Neuron 2015). Because the imagined directions could not be directly enacted (because many of them passed through buildings), we also think that the current result implies a global grid-like signal of the sort investigated in (Carpenter et al. Current biology.), but for imagined navigation. We also think that the novel finding of head-direction specific activity in the current manuscript is a potentially important one. We think that the authors could focus on these strengths of the current manuscript, and do not need to rely on the claims about non-spatial processes that are more difficult to justify in a completely spatial experiment.</i> "

To demonstrate that absolute directional coding in the parahippocampal gyrus was not driven by building locations we excluded (I) comparisons of trials sampling directions from the same start location and (II) comparisons of trials using the same target building. Specifically, we obtained the pair-wise similarity matrix from the peak voxel of the absolute directional coding effect of our main analysis (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>) and calculated the pattern similarity difference between pairs of trials sampling similar (angular differences \u2264 30\u00b0) and dissimilar (angular differences \u2265 60\u00b0) directions after excluding the respective comparisons.

For consistency, we turned towards the approach employed when ruling out potential distance effects in the grid-like signal observed in entorhinal cortex. This two-step procedure is mathematically similar to the multiple regression approach suggested by the reviewers in that variance explained by the distance predictor is removed before computing our effect. Specifically, we set out from the locations of the buildings entering each pair- wise comparison and quantified three distance measures for each trial pair: (I) the mean length of the vectors connecting the respective start and target buildings, (II) the difference in length between these vectors and (III) the average distance of the six vectors marking all possible connections between the four buildings of a trial pair. Calculating the same contrast as for the pattern similarity analysis (computing the difference between the mean distances for trial pairs with angular differences \u2264 30\u00b0 and for pairs with larger angular differences and then testing these difference scores against 0) revealed that both the mean distance (T<sub>23</sub> = 8.30, p &lt; 0.001) and the difference in distance (T<sub>23</sub> = 58.23, p &lt; 0.001) was greater for trial pairs sampling similar directions, while the \u2018neighborhood distance\u2019 was smaller (T<sub>23</sub> = -77.51, p &lt; 0.001) for these comparisons. Crucially, absolute directional coding in the PHG was independent of all distance measures: For each subject, we used the different distance scores as regressors in three separate GLMs to predict pattern similarity values of all trial pairs in the peak voxel of the main absolute directional coding effect (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>) and computed the difference in pattern similarity between pairs sampling similar versus dissimilar directions on the residuals of these GLMs. We still observed increased pattern similarity for trial pairs sampling similar directions compared to pairs sampling dissimilar directions after controlling for the mean trial distance (T<sub>23</sub> = 3.90, p &lt; 0.001), the difference in distance within a trial pair (T<sub>23</sub> = 3.61, p &lt; 0.001) and the average distance between all buildings of a pair (T<sub>23</sub> = 3.97, p &lt; 0.001).

This is due to the minimal sampling of directions. Essentially, then, the technique is similar to fitting one of sin(6\u03b8) or cos(6\u03b8) and ignoring the other one and taking the absolute values of the betas. Obviously there is a sensitivity gain from pooling over voxels, which may regain much of the sensitivity loss.

Contrary to the approach established by Doeller et al. (Nature, 2010) and subsequently used by Kunz et al. (Science, 2015), Horner et al. (Current Biology, 2016) and Constantinescu et al. (Science, 2016) the approach we employ does not rely on estimation of the grid orientation, but it capitalizes exclusively on the six-fold-symmetric firing patterns of grid cells. In the original paper, grid orientations were estimated per voxel and then averaged across the voxels in the entorhinal cortex. Grid orientations were significantly clustered in most participants (Doeller et al., Nature, 2010, Suppl. Figure 9). These findings are in line with recent reports of clustering of grid orientations across cells in simple environments (Krupic et al., Nature, 2015; Stensola et al., Nature, 2015). Taking the assumption of a shared grid orientation across voxels to the extreme, it is indeed conceivable that there might be no sensitivity to the 60\u00b0 modulation of pattern similarity values targeted by our multivariate approach if the grid orientation is 15\u00b0 or 45\u00b0 with the sampling of only twelve directions."

This stands in contrast to the voxel- wise, univariate analysis employed by Doeller et al. (Nature, 2010). Differences in grid orientation across voxels could potentially also reflect variation in the grid orientation across grid cell modules reported by Stensola et al. (Nature, 2012, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C, D</a>). Variation in the orientation of grid modules is also present in the two more recent studies reporting an alignment of grid orientations to environmental boundaries (Krupic et al., Nature, 2015, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>; Stensola et al., Nature, 2015, Extended Data <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A, B</a>). Differences in orientation between grid modules could result in differences in putative grid orientation across voxels in the entorhinal cortex, which might normalize sensitivity differences."

This was also observed by Doeller et al. (Nature, 2010), where participants navigated an environment with multiple prominent landmarks for orientation. Potentially, this might still result in different sensitivity of our analysis across participants due to the sampling of twelve directions. While the sampling of twelve directions constitutes the minimum number of directions necessary for our analysis, a higher number of directions would have been infeasible to assess in a controlled fashion in our direction imagination task. Since the more fine-grained sampling of directions needed to estimate individual grid orientations could not be realized with our design only the multivariate approach allowed for the investigation of grid-like entorhinal signals."

If there are more or less of these than their complements (trials that occur mostly in the 30\u00b0 pairs), is it possible that they can cause some statistical autocorrelation in the question of interest. We think this is unlikely, but would be interested to hear your thoughts. We are aware that this is a weakly specified criticism.

However, we do not believe this is the case for two reasons: One of the control analyses reported in the manuscript showed that pattern similarity was increased in the 0\u00b0 modulo 60\u00b0 condition when only comparing voxel patterns of trials recorded in different scanning runs (T<sub>23</sub> = 2.08, p = 0.049; <a href=\"#fig3s6\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 6</a>, bar IV). We believe that excluding comparisons of trials from the same run makes a contribution of temporal autocorrelation to the effect highly unlikely as the scanner was stopped in between runs and runs were separated by breaks typically lasting a few minutes to allow participants to rest. These breaks were terminated by the participant indicating he was ready to continue with the next task block."
