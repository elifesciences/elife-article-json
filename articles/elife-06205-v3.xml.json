During mammalian development, two global demethylation events are followed by waves of de novo DNA methylation. In vivo mechanisms of DNA methylation establishment are largely uncharacterized. Here, we use <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> as a system lacking DNA methylation to define the chromatin features influencing the activity of the murine DNMT3B. Our data demonstrate that DNMT3B and H3K4 methylation are mutually exclusive and that DNMT3B is co-localized with H3K36 methylated regions. In support of this observation, DNA methylation analysis in yeast strains without Set1 and Set2 shows an increase of relative 5<sup>me</sup>C levels at the transcription start site and a decrease in the gene-body, respectively. We extend our observation to the murine male germline, where H3K4me3 is strongly anti-correlated while H3K36me3 correlates with accelerated DNA methylation. These results show the importance of H3K36 methylation for gene-body DNA methylation in vivo."

During mammalian development, two global demethylation events are followed by waves of de novo DNA methylation. In vivo mechanisms of DNA methylation establishment are largely uncharacterized. Here, we use <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> as a system lacking DNA methylation to define the chromatin features influencing the activity of the murine DNMT3B. Our data demonstrate that DNMT3B and H3K4 methylation are mutually exclusive and that DNMT3B is co-localized with H3K36 methylated regions. In support of this observation, DNA methylation analysis in yeast strains without Set1 and Set2 shows an increase of relative 5<sup>me</sup>C levels at the transcription start site and a decrease in the gene-body, respectively. We extend our observation to the murine male germline, where H3K4me3 is strongly anti-correlated while H3K36me3 correlates with accelerated DNA methylation. These results show the importance of H3K36 methylation for gene-body DNA methylation in vivo."

Chromatin plays a fundamental role in both the establishment and maintenance of each cell's state. Many players contribute to chromatin states, including nucleosome organization, histone post-translational modifications, and non-coding RNAs (<a href=\"#bib5\">Chen and Dent, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Maze et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Quinodoz and Guttman, 2014</a>). Another mechanism for maintaining the state of a cell through cell division is the methylation of cytosines at position 5 (5<sup>me</sup>C), a widespread heritable DNA modification found in prokaryotes, plants, several fungi, and animals (<a href=\"#bib22\">Iyer et al., 2011</a>). In mammals, DNA methylation plays a fundamental role in processes such as imprinting, X-chromosome inactivation, transposon inactivation, and gene expression regulation (<a href=\"#bib47\">Smith and Meissner, 2013</a>). Dysregulation of DNA methylation is a common feature in cancer (<a href=\"#bib12\">Eden et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">You and Jones, 2012</a>) and a variety of human diseases are caused by defective imprinting (<a href=\"#bib38\">Peters, 2014</a>)."

However, DNA methylation is not static throughout mammalian development. In fact, 5<sup>me</sup>C can either be lost by a passive mechanism, such as the failure to maintain DNA methylation through cell division or by an active mechanism such as the removal of methylcytosine, typically via an oxidized intermediate (<a href=\"#bib36\">Pastor et al., 2013</a>)."

However, global demethylation and de novo methylation events can also occur during development (<a href=\"#bib36\">Pastor et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Seisenberger et al., 2013</a>). For example, most DNA methylation is progressively lost between fertilization and the formation of the blastula and global de novo DNA methylation then occurs coincidently with implantation of the embryo. This de novo methylation event largely shapes the methylation pattern of the animal, with additional changes occurring in somatic tissues, which contribute to cellular identity. In the germline however, a second reprogramming event occurs. After specification of the germ cells, most DNA methylation is lost during early primordial germ cell (PGCs) development. Unlike in early embryogenesis, imprints are erased during this period. Genome-wide de novo methylation then occurs before birth in the male germline and upon oocyte maturation in females (<a href=\"#bib46\">Smallwood et al., 2011</a>). This de novo methylation event establishes the imprints that are inherited in the next generation."

In contrast, the inactive DNMT3L possesses only a functional ADD domain. The ADD domains of all three DNMTs have been shown to preferentially bind histone 3 tails that lack methylation at lysine 4 (H3K4me0) (<a href=\"#bib35\">Ooi et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Zhang et al., 2010</a>), and this binding has been recently shown to relieve DNMT3a auto-inhibition (<a href=\"#bib17\">Guo et al., 2015</a>). This is consistent with the observation that genomic regions bearing H3K4 methylation are generally depleted of 5<sup>me</sup>C (<a href=\"#bib45\">Singh et al., 2013</a>). The PWWP domain of several proteins has been shown to bind H3K36 methylation (<a href=\"#bib48\">Vermeulen et al., 2010</a>), and indeed the DNMT3a-PWWP domain has also been shown to interact with the tri-methylated lysine 36 of histone H3 (H3K36me3) in vitro (<a href=\"#bib9\">Dhayalan et al., 2010</a>). The importance of these histone-binding domains in targeting DNA methyltransferase activity in vivo is still unclear. It is also possible that the PWWP domain's primary function is to bind DNA and not nucleosomes (<a href=\"#bib9\">Dhayalan et al., 2010</a>). Recently, it has been reported that the PWWP domain is important in specifying the localization of DNMT3b in mouse embryonic stem cells (<a href=\"#bib2\">Baubec et al., 2015</a>)."

To address this question, we introduced DNMT3b into an organism that has no endogenous DNA methylation machinery, the budding yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, to study the chromatin components affecting the activity of a mammalian de novo DNA methyltransferase. This system has several advantages over the study of DNA methylation in mammalian cells. Yeast has conserved histone sequences and many residues are modified at the same sites as those found in higher eukaryotes. However, unlike mammalian cells, yeast cells can be easily manipulated and the small size of their genome reduces costs associated with next-generation sequencing-based approaches. Moreover, yeast has already been used to show the importance of the N-terminus of histone H3 in targeting the DNA methylation complex (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hu et al., 2009</a>)."

In fact, mutation of the H3K36 methyltransferase Set2 decreases DNA methylation over regions that would normally contain H3K36me3. Thus the marks themselves, as opposed to genomic features that correlate with these marks, are responsible for targeting DNA methylation. We also demonstrate that the pattern of H3K4 and H3K36 methylation in embryonic male germ cells accurately predicts which regions undergo de novo methylation, indicating that the mechanism observed in yeast is conserved in mammals."

We measured the levels of 5-methylcytosine (5<sup>me</sup>C) in these strains using whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1A</a>). We observed significant levels of 5<sup>me</sup>C of DNA extracted from the exponentially growing and stationary phases of the same strain culture (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a> and <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2A</a>), with higher methylation levels observed in stationary phase. CpG dinucleotides were preferentially methylated, as expected from the previously characterized activity of mammalian DNMT3. The methylation levels of CpG dinucleotides range from 3.3 to 7.7%, depending on the yeast strain analyzed. These levels are about 10\u201320 times higher than the average of other dinucleotides levels (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2A</a>), and well above the bisulfite non-conversion rate of 0.27%, as estimated from an unmethylated lambda DNA spike-in."

The mouse germline is an excellent model for such studies. The mouse germline is specified from the epiblast at E7.25 and then progressively loses DNA methylation through subsequent rounds of cell division. By E13.5, almost all DNA methylation has been lost (<a href=\"#bib39\">Popp et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Seisenberger et al., 2012</a>). In male germ cells, cell division halts, and the de novo methyltransferases and their co-factor DNMT3L are expressed between E13.5 and birth, when the genome undergoes global de novo DNA methylation (<a href=\"#bib43\">Seisenberger et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Kobayashi et al., 2013</a>). Thus in this setting, DNA methyltransferases are introduced into hypomethylated cells, and are therefore an ideal model to study the targeting of de novo DNA methylation."

Consistent with previous observations about the timing of de novo DNA methylation in the developing mouse germline, global CpG methylation rises from 7% at E13.5 to 55% at E16.5 and reaches at 75% by P2.5 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Previous studies have shown that the entire male germline genome is methylated by default, except for regions of H3K4 methylation such as TSSs which antagonize de novo DNA methylation (<a href=\"#bib45\">Singh et al., 2013</a>). However, charting the progression of DNA methylation over time, it is apparent that there exist \u2018early methylating\u2019 regions that reach their final methylation state by E16.5 and \u2018late methylating\u2019 regions that undergo substantial DNA methylation between E16.5 and P2.5. We observed that heavily transcribed regions of chromosomes showed much higher DNA methylation at E16.5 than less transcribed regions (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Furthermore, while the TSS of active genes was unmethylated, gene bodies of actively transcribed genes were typically early-methylators (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B,D</a>).

To test this hypothesis, we analyzed published H3K4me3 ChIP-seq data (<a href=\"#bib30\">Lesch et al., 2013</a>) and performed H3K36me3 ChIP-seq on sorted germ cells of pooled E13.5 testis (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1G</a>).

The expression of the murine DNMT3b in a host with no detectable levels of 5<sup>me</sup>C led to the methylation of CpG dinucleotides at different levels depending on the specific chromatin context. The presence of the H3K4me3 mark inhibits the activity of DNMT3b, while H3K36me3 promotes DNA methylation. This suggests that the activity of DNMT3B is guided by the interactions of the ADD and PWWP domains with histone tails. It has been recently shown (<a href=\"#bib2\">Baubec et al., 2015</a>) that in embryonic stem cells the PWWP domain is responsible for the targeting of DNMT3b to regions enriched for the H3K36me3. Similarly to our finding in yeast, the reintroduction of DNMT3b into methylation deficient DNMT1/DNMT3A/DNMT3B triple KO (TKO) ES cells partially restores 5<sup>me</sup>C levels. Methylation levels are higher at H3K36me3 sites, a trend eliminated by the ablation of the H3K36me3 methyltransferase Setd2 (<a href=\"#bib2\">Baubec et al., 2015</a>). Our findings are in agreement with the Baubec et al. observations, both in a system where other factors guiding DNA methylation are absent (yeast), and during a period of biologically important de novo DNA methylation (germ cells)."

According to our findings, the levels of DNA methylation are guided by the presence of two transcription-dependent marks: H3K4 and H3K36 methylation. The discrepancy between the findings in yeast and germ cells can be explained by the difference in the length of their genes. Yeast genes are relatively small compared to genes in higher eukaryotes so, H3K4 methylation can spread within the body of the gene, thus preventing the binding of the DNMT3-ADD domain to the N-terminus of histone H3 and reducing its activity. In contrast, in mammals, H3K4me is localized to the start of the gene, and does not spread significantly within the gene body. Hence, highly transcribed genes in mammals show a strong enrichment of H3K4me3 around the TSS and H3K36me3 into the gene-body, shaping their intragenic DNA methylation distribution."

In mature oocytes, which have intermediate global levels of CpG methylation (\u223c50%), similar to male E16.5 PGCs, actively transcribed gene bodies have far higher levels of DNA methylation than less transcribed genes and intergenic regions (<a href=\"#bib46\">Smallwood et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Kobayashi et al., 2012</a>). Also, in oocytes, intragenic CpG islands show far higher DNA methylation than other CpG islands (<a href=\"#bib46\">Smallwood et al., 2011</a>). Transcriptional read-through is a common feature of maternally imprinted loci (<a href=\"#bib52\">Weaver and Bartolomei, 2014</a>) and ablation of an upstream promoter prevents proper methylation of the imprinted <i>Gnas</i> locus (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chotalia et al., 2009</a>). In mammalian soma, inactive X-chromosome shows higher promoter methylation, consistent with its silent state, but markedly lower intragenic methylation (<a href=\"#bib18\">Hellman and Chess, 2007</a>). Transcriptional elongation is also correlated with DNA methylation in tumor cells (<a href=\"#bib23\">Jin et al., 2012</a>). It has been suggested that transcriptional read-through could \u2018open\u2019 chromatin for DNMTs, or that heterochromatin is physically inaccessible to DNMTs.

H3K36me3 and DNA methylation could cooperate to silence these transposons in the germline and other periods of de novo methylation, and to maintain silencing through development. Moreover, where multiple TSSs exist for a gene, as in many imprinted loci, H3K36me3-mediated DNA methylation may serve to ensure the dominance of one promoter in a given cell type."

All catalytically active DNMT3-family methyltransferases in animals contain PWWP domains, and accordingly, gene body DNA methylation is observed in all animals that have retained DNMT3 enzymes. Preferential methylation of gene bodies over intergenic regions is observed for invertebrates such as honey bees (<i>Apis mellifera</i>), sea squirts (<i>Ciona intestinalis</i>), sea anemones (<i>Nematostella vectensis</i>) (<a href=\"#bib55\">Zemach and Grafi, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Feng et al., 2010</a>). While the relationship between relative gene expression and gene-body methylation varies across these species, there is a strong correlation between gene-body H3K36me3 in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> genes and DNA methylation of homologous gene bodies in other invertebrates (<a href=\"#bib33\">Nanty et al., 2011</a>). DNA methylation is also associated with gene bodies in zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>) (<a href=\"#bib55\">Zemach and Grafi, 2003</a>) and in mammalian contexts as discussed above. Finally, some chlorophyte algae have a \u2018chlorophyte-type cytosine methylase\u2019, which evolved independently of DNMT3-family methyltransferases, which is fused to two PWWP domains (<a href=\"#bib22\">Iyer et al., 2011</a>). Thus, H3K36me3 could be relevant to DNA methylation targeting throughout the plant and animal kingdoms."

The resulting solution is treated twice with phenol:chloroform (1:1), once with chloroform and ethanol precipitated. The DNA pellet is resuspended in EB buffer (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Between 500 and 1000 ng of extracted yeast DNA is added to 2 ng of \u03bb unmethylated DNA (Promega, Madison, WI, D1521) and the mixture is sonicated with a Covaris S-2 to obtain fragments in the 200\u2013300 bp range (Total time: 6 min; Duty cycle: 10%; Intensity: 5; Cycles/Burst: 200; Mode: Frequency sweeping).

Data from WGBS experiments in mice (<a href=\"#bib37\">Pastor et al., 2014</a> and <a href=\"#bib43\">Seisenberger et al., 2012</a>) were summarized in Supplementary file 1 panel G and Supplementary file 2 panel C, in the same manner as the yeast DNA methylation data. Also, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figures 6E and 6F</a> are quantitative metaplots over all protein coding genes, which show global correlation of DNA methylation and H3K36me3 (6F) and anti-correlation with H3K4me3 (6E)."
