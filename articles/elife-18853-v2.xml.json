More than 60 years ago, cristae were discovered as characteristic elements of mitochondria that harbor the protein complexes of oxidative phosphorylation, but how cristae are formed, remained an open question. Here we present experimental results obtained with yeast that support a novel hypothesis on the existence of two molecular pathways that lead to the generation of lamellar and tubular cristae. Formation of lamellar cristae depends on the mitochondrial fusion machinery through a pathway that is required also for homeostasis of mitochondria and mitochondrial DNA. Tubular cristae are formed via invaginations of the inner boundary membrane by a pathway independent of the fusion machinery. Dimerization of the F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub>-ATP synthase and the presence of the MICOS complex are necessary for both pathways. The proposed hypothesis is suggested to apply also to higher eukaryotes, since the key components are conserved in structure and function throughout evolution."

More than 60 years ago, cristae were discovered as characteristic elements of mitochondria that harbor the protein complexes of oxidative phosphorylation, but how cristae are formed, remained an open question. Here we present experimental results obtained with yeast that support a novel hypothesis on the existence of two molecular pathways that lead to the generation of lamellar and tubular cristae. Formation of lamellar cristae depends on the mitochondrial fusion machinery through a pathway that is required also for homeostasis of mitochondria and mitochondrial DNA. Tubular cristae are formed via invaginations of the inner boundary membrane by a pathway independent of the fusion machinery. Dimerization of the F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub>-ATP synthase and the presence of the MICOS complex are necessary for both pathways. The proposed hypothesis is suggested to apply also to higher eukaryotes, since the key components are conserved in structure and function throughout evolution."

These F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub>-ATP synthase pairs stabilize the cristae membranes as they curve to form the sac-like structure.

Light microscopy has revealed mitochondria as threadlike bodies that form three-dimensional networks. Mitochondria are dynamic organelles undergoing continual fission and fusion (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bereiter-Hahn and V\u00f6th, 1994</a>). The dynamics of mitochondria is essential for their function as well as maintenance, inheritance and integrity of their DNA (mtDNA).

There is a considerable diversity in mitochondrial architecture, but common basic structural elements can be recognized (<a href=\"#bib42\">Mannella, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Perkins et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Sun et al., 2007</a>). Mitochondria are delimited from the cytosol by the outer membrane (OM). The inner membrane (IM) is composed of the inner boundary membrane (IBM) and the crista membranes. The cristae are invaginations of the IM into the interior of the mitochondria (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). In most cases they form lamellae, but tubules are also observed (<a href=\"#bib20\">Fawcett, 1981</a>). Crista junctions (CJs) join the cristae with the IBM. They represent small ring or slot like openings that connect the intermembrane space with the intracrista space. The IM encloses the matrix space. Cristae do not cross the matrix space completely, but they are closed by strongly bent crista rims. Septa completely cross the matrix space and separate it into distinct compartments. They are virtually absent in wild type (WT) cells, but are frequent in a variety of mutant cells. Continuous protein and lipid import leads to generation of curved septa which can be seen as onion-like structures in cross sections (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Over the past 20 years a number of proteins have been identified which play key roles in mitochondrial function, dynamics and homeostasis. Still, our knowledge concerning the molecular mechanisms that determine the formation and maintenance of mitochondrial architecture is quite limited."

Based on our results we present a model that postulates the existence of two different pathways of crista formation and is fully consistent with published data on mitochondrial structure, function and dynamics in yeast and mammalian cells. In the first pathway, two IBM sheets are converted into a single lamellar crista upon fusion of mitochondria. This process not only requires Mgm1, the dynamin-like fusion protein of the IM, but also the dimeric form of the F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub>-ATP synthase (F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub>) and the MICOS complex. Mgm1 appears to mediate fusion of the IM only when dimeric F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub> is available to stabilize bending of the newly formed crista membrane and to thereby generate crista rims. Assembly of the MICOS complex is proposed to limit the fusion process by forming a CJ. In the second pathway, crista formation is independent of Mgm1, but dependent on dimeric F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub> and MICOS. It entails formation of tubular cristae and not of lamellar cristae. Our results suggest a mechanism by which growth of membranes from the IBM, driven by the influx of newly synthesized proteins and lipids, creates these tubular cristae. Importantly, all proteins found to be involved in crista biogenesis are conserved from yeast to human, emphasizing the general importance of this process."

Its deletion in yeast leads to fragmentation of mitochondria and loss of respiration-dependent growth as well as of mtDNA (<a href=\"#bib13\">Cipolat et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Jones and Fangman, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Meeusen et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Song et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Wong et al., 2000</a>).

Consistent with these observations, quantitative EM of \u2206<i>mgm1</i> cells revealed mitochondrial profiles that were mainly empty or contained one or a few septa. Vesicular and crista-like membranes were present only to a minor extent (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

Cristae membranes accommodate the respiratory chain complexes which consist of both nuclear and mitochondria-encoded subunits. Thus, it is conceivable that loss of mtDNA first leads to the loss of respiratory chain complexes and then indirectly also to the loss of cristae. Alternatively, Mgm1 might be required for cristae formation, and in the absence of cristae mtDNA is not maintained. To discriminate between these two scenarios, we made use of the temperature sensitive <i>mgm1-5</i> mutant in which a shift to non-permissive temperature leads to the inactivation of the protein and concomitant fragmentation and alteration of mitochondrial ultrastructure (<a href=\"#bib44\">Meeusen et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Wong et al., 2000</a>). We performed quantitative EM of WT and <i>mgm1-5</i> cells grown at 25\u00b0C, shifted to 37\u00b0C for 25 min, and back again to 25\u00b0C for 30 min. In WT cells almost only cristae were present and no significant changes were observed upon exposure to 37\u00b0C and return to 25\u00b0C (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A and B</a>). In <i>mgm1-5</i> cells grown at 25\u00b0C, cristae made up about 70%; apparently the temperature sensitive mutant was leaky. Exposure to 37\u00b0C and thus inactivation of Mgm1 led to a drastic loss of cristae (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A and B</a>). We expected that a time period of 25 min, which is much less than one generation time of yeast, would be too short to result in loss of mtDNA. Indeed, staining of mtDNA and test on respiratory competence revealed no loss of functional mtDNA upon exposure to 37\u00b0C for 25 min (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). However, longer exposure (72 hr) of <i>mgm1-5</i> cells to non-permissive temperature led to inhibition of cell growth on\u00a0respiratory medium (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Strikingly, upon return of the <i>mgm1-5</i> cells to 25\u00b0C for 30 min cristae reappeared and septa were reduced, comparable to the situation before incubation at non-permissive temperature (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A and B</a>). Interestingly, mitochondrial respiratory complexes in both WT and mutant, as determined for Complex III and IV, remained intact during the temperature shifts (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a>)."

To analyze the structure of these cristae we used electron tomography. Notably, exposure of <i>mgm1-5</i> cells to 37\u00b0C led to a decrease of lamellar and an increase of tubular cristae as compared to WT (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E and F</a>; <a href=\"#media1\">Videos 1</a> and <a href=\"#media2\">2</a>). These results show that the\u00a0disappearance and reappearance of cristae are rapid and depend on functional Mgm1. We conclude that the formation of lamellar and tubular cristae relies on two different pathways. Moreover, Mgm1 plays a direct role in the\u00a0formation and maintenance of lamellar but not of tubular cristae."

Mgm1 is present in two isoforms (<a href=\"#bib58\">Shepard and Yaffe, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Wong et al., 2000</a>). l-Mgm1 contains a transmembrane helix that anchors it to the IM; in contrast, s-Mgm1 lacks the transmembrane helix and was reported to be present at the IBM or OM (<a href=\"#bib57\">Sesaki et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Wong et al., 2000</a>) and a short form of Opa1 was found to be co-localized with the OM fission machinery (<a href=\"#bib3\">Anand et al., 2014</a>). Importantly, both l-Mgm1 and s-Mgm1 forms are required for Mgm1 function in mitochondrial fusion (<a href=\"#bib18\">DeVay et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Zick et al., 2009</a>). To test where s-Mgm1 is located, we generated sub-mitochondrial vesicles by sonication and separated them by gradient density centrifugation. Remarkably, s-Mgm1 co-fractionated with the outer membrane marker Tom70, indicating that it is associated with the outer membrane (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). These data suggest that Mgm1 could interact with the OM in the course of IM fusion. Thus, as outlined below, it is possible that after fusion of the OM a septum is formed by IMs that are not yet fused, and that Mgm1 at IM/OM contact sites initiates the\u00a0conversion of these septa membranes into a crista membrane by IM fusion."

The subunits of the F<sub>O</sub> sector, Su e/Atp21 and Su g/Atp20, mediate the formation of F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub> dimers (<a href=\"#bib5\">Arnold et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Habersetzer et al., 2013</a>). Deletion of Su e or Su g leads to the formation of membrane sheets that are crossing the matrix space completely and to onion-like structures. Examination of a large number of EM sections showed that these membrane sheets are not cristae as previously assumed, but septa. Onions represent cross sections of curved septa (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). This is also apparent upon tomographic reconstruction of isolated mitochondria from cells lacking dimeric F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub> (<a href=\"#bib17\">Davies et al., 2012</a>). A fundamental difference between cristae and septa is that crista membranes are strongly bent to generate crista rims and thus the sac-like crista structure, whereas septa are not closed but divide the matrix into membrane-limited subcompartments. In spite of this drastic alteration of mitochondrial architecture, growth is only moderately retarded under respiratory conditions (<a href=\"#bib50\">Paumard et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Rabl et al., 2009</a>). It is presently unknown how and when during crista formation this bending is taking place. We localized fully assembled F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub> by detection of its subunit F<sub>1</sub>\u03b2 and found it almost exclusively in the crista membranes of WT mitochondria (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). In the Su e deletion mutant, however, the fraction of monomeric F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub> detected in the IBM was increased by a factor of three in comparison to WT (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). This observation is compatible with the assumption that the distribution of F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub> in cristae and IBM correlates with its oligomeric state. Similar to F<sub>1</sub>\u03b2, Su e was present in crista membranes of WT mitochondria (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Very low levels of F<sub>1</sub>\u03b2, monomeric F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub> and unassembled Su e may exist in the IBM into which new components are continually being inserted, but dimeric F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub> is present almost exclusively in cristae and does not assemble in the planar IBM. Thus, the assembly of dimeric F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub> is likely to take place during the\u00a0formation of cristae when the\u00a0bending of membranes has to occur."

Since CJs are essential elements of cristae, we asked whether MICOS has a function in the formation of cristae. A so far unanswered question is whether the cristae in WT and the stacked membranes in the \u0394<i>mic60</i> mutant differ in their functions. The protein composition of these mitochondria is very similar to that of WT cells (<a href=\"#bib28\">Harner et al., 2014</a>).

Its deletion leads to the\u00a0formation of a highly branched and interconnected mitochondrial network (<a href=\"#bib9\">Bleazard et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Otsuga et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Smirnova et al., 1998</a>). Loss of Mgm1 in cells depleted of Dnm1 does not lead to loss of cristae (<a href=\"#bib57\">Sesaki et al., 2003</a>). This surprising observation appeared to contradict our suggestion that Mgm1 is directly required for crista formation and maintenance. To resolve this apparent discrepancy, we first analyzed the ultrastructure of mitochondria in the \u2206<i>dnm1</i> mutant. We observed that mitochondrial architecture differed significantly from that in WT. These mitochondria are considerably enlarged, densely filled with vesicular profiles and short tubular cristae, while CJs are abundant along the IBM (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). In comparison to WT, the number of cristae with lamellar structure was found to be much lower as highlighted by electron tomography. 3D reconstruction revealed that the vesicular profiles mostly represent interconnected highly convoluted and branched tubular structures (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>; <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>). These tubules seem to have the ability to fuse and to branch. Interestingly, we identified tubular cristae also in WT cells by tomography, albeit much less frequently (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>; <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). Normal levels of components of OXPHOS as well as assembled MICOS and dimeric F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub> were present in these mitochondria (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C and D</a>). Notably, the level of the\u00a0assembled MICOS complex in the \u2206<i>dnm1</i> mutant was significantly increased. This is consistent with the higher number of cristae and CJs in this mutant. The necessity for the\u00a0accommodation of OXPHOS and other membrane proteins likely requires an increase of the number of cristae since the surface area of tubular cristae compared to lamellar cristae is much lower. In summary, we reasoned that the mitochondrial network is in an almost completely fused state in the absence of Dnm1, and thus the rate of fusion is strongly decreased. The diminished Mgm1 activity might then result in a drastically reduced formation of lamellar cristae and massive production of tubular cristae."

Indeed, we observed mitochondria with numerous tubular cristae (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), supporting the idea that tubular cristae are the predominant type in the absence of fusion activity. However, this phenotype was observed to a much lesser degree than in the \u25b3<i>dnm1</i>\u25b3<i>mgm1</i> mutant. Strikingly, \u25b3<i>dnm1</i>\u25b3<i>fzo1</i> cells quite frequently contained constricted mitochondria and mitochondria with septa (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Since it has been\u00a0repeatedly suggested that a separate Dnm1-independent fission mechanism exists for the IM (<a href=\"#bib23\">Gorsich and Shaw, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Ishihara et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Westermann, 2010</a>), we consider it possible that these structures represent division events of the IM in the absence of OM fusion. This could then provide Mgm1 with suitable inner membrane structures for the formation of lamellar cristae and explain why the cristae phenotype of \u25b3<i>dnm1</i>\u25b3<i>fzo1</i> is less severe than that of \u25b3<i>dnm1</i>\u25b3<i>mgm1.</i> Together, these observations suggest that mitochondrial fusion is important for generating crista structure."

Vesicular-tubular profiles, often located close to the IBM and associated with sheet-like membrane structures, were present in the interior of the mitochondria. Tomographic reconstructions revealed a rather corrugated and perforated appearance, in contrast to the planar structure of WT lamellar cristae. Therefore, these membranes are most likely formed by association of extended tubules, which partly fuse with each other (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>; <a href=\"#media5\">Video 5</a>). Interestingly, in contrast to the \u0394<i>dnm1</i>\u0394<i>mgm1</i> mutant, growth of \u0394<i>dnm1</i>\u0394<i>mic60</i> cells was very slow on respiratory medium (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>) and the rate of mtDNA loss was higher in this mutant, indicating that in the\u00a0absence of fully functional Mgm1, MICOS and thereby CJs and tubular cristae contribute to maintenance of mtDNA (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). The steady state levels of the mitochondrial proteins analyzed were similar to those in \u0394<i>dnm1</i> cells. MICOS components were an exception, as they were reduced to different degrees. This was, however, also observed with the \u25b3<i>mic10</i> or \u25b3<i>mic60</i> single deletion mutants. The level of Cox2, a mitochondrial gene product, was also reduced (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). We suggest that in \u0394<i>dnm1</i>\u0394<i>mic60</i> mutant, in contrast to the \u0394<i>mic60</i> single mutant in which lamellar cristae can be made, the proteins and lipids imported into the mitochondria invaginate the IBM. This results in irregular networks which, as indicated by the biochemical and the growth phenotype, lack the characteristic properties of cristae."

Based on our findings and the literature about these three factors and their interactors, we developed a hypothesis that postulates the existence of two distinct mechanisms for the generation of lamellar and tubular cristae. Regarding the formation of lamellar cristae, a first important issue is how Mgm1 performs fusion of the mitochondrial IM (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). It is known that dysfunction of the components that mediate mitochondrial membrane fusion, Fzo1, Ugo1, and Mgm1, leads to loss of mtDNA and loss of cristae, concomitant with septa formation and inhibition of IM fusion (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hermann et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Hoppins et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Meeusen et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Sesaki et al., 2003</a>). It was shown that Fzo1 in the OM interacts with the IM, and Mgm1 in the inner membrane interacts physically with Fzo1 and Ugo1 in the OM (<a href=\"#bib22\">Fritz et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Sesaki et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Wong et al., 2003</a>). Both l-Mgm1 anchored in the IM and s-Mgm1 bound to the OM are required for fusion (<a href=\"#bib18\">DeVay et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Zick et al., 2009</a>). These observations suggest a mechanism by which progression of IM fusion takes place at sites where IM and OM are in close contact (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). Fusion of the OM by Fzo1 would first generate a mitochondrion with a planar septum consisting of non-fused IM. Tethering of these two IMs by Mgm1 could take place at the IM surface in contact with the OM. According to our hypothesis, the fusion of the IM is then initiated by Mgm1 and proceeds along the IM-OM contacts, thereby generating a membrane sac protruding into the matrix. Shifting the temperature sensitive <i>mgm1-5</i> mutant to non-permissive temperature leads to rapid fragmentation of mitochondria (<a href=\"#bib44\">Meeusen et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Wong et al., 2000</a>). Quantitative EM analysis of this process reveals that, in addition to fragmentation, a rapid and extensive loss of cristae takes place, while septa are formed. These findings strongly suggest that the activity of Mgm1 not only is required for fusion but also for maintenance of cristae. Importantly, cristae are rapidly regenerated upon reactivation of Mgm1. Equally important, mtDNA is retained during inactivation of Mgm1 and remains functional. Thus, it is not the loss of mtDNA that causes loss of cristae and formation of septa, emphasizing a role of Mgm1 in crista maintenance."

The fusion rate of mitochondria in wild type cells has been measured by live cell microscopy (<a href=\"#bib34\">Jakobs et al., 2003</a>). Under steady-state conditions at least one fusion and one fission event was observed per minute and cell. This rate is apparently determined by regulatory processes that ensure a balance of fusion and fission. In contrast, fusion of the IM in <i>mgm1-5</i> mutant cells by reactivation of Mgm1 is likely to reflect an entirely different situation. Here, the conversion of a septum to a crista requires only the time of IM fusion by Mgm1 which upon its reactivation is immediately ready to function. The overall process of mitochondrial fusion requires a multitude of steps, including fusion of the OM. Fusion of the IM likely represents one of the fastest steps. Notably in this context, fusion intermediates have not been identified convincingly in intact cells. These conclusions are in good agreement with observations that acute ablation of Opa1 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts leads to disorganized cristae and reduced respiratory function, but maintenance of mtDNA (<a href=\"#bib14\">Cogliati et al., 2013</a>)."

Very interestingly, recent experiments with reconstituted vesicles have revealed that Mgm1 mediates membrane bending (<a href=\"#bib56\">Rujiviphat et al., 2015</a>). Bending of crista membranes takes place only when the F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub>-ATP synthase can dimerize (<a href=\"#bib17\">Davies et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Rabl et al., 2009</a>). Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that bending of crista membranes takes place concurrently with the fusion process, and dimeric F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub>-ATP synthase is required to stabilize the bending of the membrane. Importantly, according to our model, in the absence of Su e, a dimerization component of the F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub>-ATP synthase, fusion of IM by Mgm1 cannot take place. Rather, OM fusion still occurs in the absence of IM fusion and septa are generated. The continual import of proteins and lipids then leads to expansion of the septa membranes. This expansion may cause the curved structures of septa that in EM sections appear as onion-like profiles (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>)."

In agreement with this speculation, we found that the MICOS component Mic10 is preferentially located at sites where septa merge with the IMS, the septum junctions. Our hypothesis does not exclude a stabilizing function of MICOS for cristae. Since membrane proteins and protein complexes can shuttle between cristae and the IBM (<a href=\"#bib66\">Vogel et al., 2006</a>), it seems likely that a major reason for crista stability is the continued presence and activity of Mgm1. In addition, our hypothesis provides a rational explanation for the generation of the stacked closed membrane sheets lacking connection with the IBM that are formed in the absence of functional MICOS complex. In the absence of the MICOS core components, Mic60 and Mic10, fusion proceeds as in WT cells, but cannot be halted (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). Interestingly, a very similar mechanism was suggested for the fusion of vacuoles, the yeast homolog of lysosomes (<a href=\"#bib71\">Wickner, 2010</a>). Upon fusion of vacuoles an internal vesicle is generated (<a href=\"#bib68\">Wang et al., 2002</a>). It might well be that these vesicles are generated like the internal stacks in Mic10 or Mic60 deletion mutants. According to our hypothesis, during fusion septa membranes and the nascent crista membrane form a continuum. This allows free distribution of proteins between the IBM and the nascent crista membrane. This would also explain the similarity of the composition of intramitochondrial membrane sheets, made in the absence of MICOS, to crista membranes as well as their full functionality in mediating OXPHOS."

In this pathway, import of newly synthesized proteins and lipids into the IBM and passage through CJs leads to the formation of tubular cristae. Assembly of CJs can take place since a pool of MICOS subunits is present in the IBM (<a href=\"#bib27\">Harner et al., 2011</a>). Interestingly, oligomeric forms of the MICOS subunit Mic10 can induce membrane curvature in vitro and were suggested to form CJs in vivo (<a href=\"#bib6\">Barbot et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Bohnert et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Milenkovic and Larsson, 2015</a>). We propose that the shape of CJs formed by the MICOS complex determines the tubular shape of nascent cristae. Dimerization of F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub> would stabilize bending of the tubular cristae, very much like it stabilizes the rims of lamellar cristae. Interestingly, regular helical zipper-like structures of presumably dimeric F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub> were observed at the surface of the tubular cristae of the protist <i>Paramecium multimicronucleatum</i> by scanning EM (<a href=\"#bib2\">Allen et al., 1989</a>). Remarkably, in the absence of both Dnm1 and functional MICOS, tubules are formed. We suggest that they are generated by the continual influx of proteins and lipids and shaped by dimeric F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub>. Since CJs are not formed, these tubules are rather unstable, having a high tendency to fuse and to generate bizarre corrugated networks, and are not functional in OXPHOS and maintenance of mtDNA (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>). This points to a correlation between presence of cristae and mtDNA. In fact, mtDNA, condensed in nucleoids, was reported to be bound to crista membranes, possibly to crista rims (<a href=\"#bib38\">Kopek et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Kukat and Larsson, 2013</a>)."

In this situation, the mitochondrial network is virtually completely fused and Mgm1-dependent fusion activity should be drastically reduced. The lack of requirement of Mgm1 in this pathway provides a rational explanation for the most surprising observation that Mgm1 can be deleted in the Dnm1 deletion background without loss of cristae. Residual formation of lamellar cristae in the absence of Dnm1 can be explained by residual fusion and fission activity of mitochondria (<a href=\"#bib23\">Gorsich and Shaw, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Ishihara et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Westermann, 2010</a>). The virtually complete lack of lamellar cristae in cells deficient in both Dnm1 and Mgm1 further supports this assumption. Most interestingly, a study on the role of Opa1 in mitochondrial cristae remodeling showed that mitochondria isolated from mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking functional Opa1 lacked lamellar cristae; instead, these mitochondria contained short tubular-type cristae (<a href=\"#bib21\">Frezza et al., 2006</a>). These observations are not only in very good agreement with our conclusions on a direct role of Mgm1 in crista formation, but also point to the conservation of its role in crista biogenesis in mammalian cells."

This is clearly the case in yeast, as we observed lamellar and, to a lower extent, tubular cristae in WT cells. Inspection of a large number of published EM images of mitochondria from different cell types reveals a bias to lamellar vs. tubular cristae. For example, lamellar cristae dominate in pancreatic cells and hepatocytes, whereas in steroidogenic cells tubular cristae are the principle architectural feature. A mixed situation prevails in certain types of muscle cells where both lamellar and tubular profiles can be recognized (<a href=\"#bib10\">Blinzinger et al., 1965</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Fawcett, 1981</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Hanaki et al., 1985</a>). Tomographic reconstruction is the optimal approach to determine precisely the distribution of these two types of cristae. Such a study has been performed with cerebellar neuronal cells and revealed lamellar and tubular cristae that are regularly connected by sites of fusion (<a href=\"#bib51\">Perkins et al., 1997</a>). Furthermore, the\u00a0differentiation of isolated zona glomerulosa cells of rat adrenal cortex triggered by treatment with adrenocorticotropic hormone leads to a drastic change of the corticoid hormones synthesized and to a concomitant transformation of the crista structure from mainly \u201clamellar-tubular\u201d to \u201ctubular-convolute\u201d (<a href=\"#bib4\">Andreis et al., 1990</a>). Interestingly, steroidogenesis in human trophoblasts was reported to be dependent on the activity of Opa1. During developmental induction of the steroidogenic pathway, Opa1 levels decreased and steroid formation increased. Manipulations of cells to increase Opa1 levels led to decreased efficiency of steroidogenesis. At the same time, crista structure was observed to be remodeled (<a href=\"#bib69\">Wasilewski et al., 2012</a>). Altogether, many basic questions need to be answered, including how mitochondrial architecture is modulated in response to metabolic and developmental requirements, how the state of cellular differentiation affects mitochondrial ultrastructure and why specific crista structures are necessary for specific cellular functions."

Since the identified key players are highly conserved from yeast to human, our study has immediate relevance for the relationship of structure and function of mammalian mitochondria of different tissues under normal and dysfunctional conditions. Finally, our results emphasize that understanding inheritance and homeostasis of mitochondria requires an integrated view on their three-dimensional architecture and the molecular topological functions of the various key players involved."

For electron microscopy after cryo-sectioning (Tokuyasu method), cells were grown to exponential phase in YPD or YPG medium, chemically fixed, embedded in 12% gelatin and cryo-sectioned as described previously (<a href=\"#bib24\">Griffith et al., 2008</a>). Ultrathin cryo-sections were collected with a 1:1 mixture of 2% methylcellulose (in ddH2O) and 2.3 M, sucrose 120 mM PIPES, 50 mM HEPES, pH 6.9, 4 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 20 mM EGTA and layered on Formvar/carbon coated copper 100 mesh grids. Structural phenotypes were analyzed by evaluation of 100 mitochondrial profiles unless otherwise indicated. Immunological reactions were performed with monoclonal anti-HA (RRID:<a href=\"https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_514505\">AB_514505</a>) and a protein A-gold 10 nm conjugate. Protein localization gold particles present in 100 cells were counted. Samples for the electron tomography analyses were processed as previously described (<a href=\"#bib43\">Mari et al., 2014</a>)."

Mitochondria are cellular organelles with a characteristic shape and inner architecture. The most fascinating ultrastructural feature of mitochondria is the presence of numerous, heterogeneously shaped invaginations of the inner membrane that are the main sites of oxidative phosphorylation in eukaryotic cells and have been termed cristae membranes. Cristae are considered to represent a specialized micro-compartment within mitochondria that is ideally suited to support ATP synthesis by chemiosmotic coupling. Surprisingly, very little is known about the mechanisms of cristae biogenesis. It has been shown that dimerization and oligomerization of ATP synthase complexes and the MICOS complex that connects cristae membranes to the peripheral inner membrane regions are critical for normal cristae morphology and function. But a comprehensive and conclusive model how differently shaped cristae are formed has been lacking."

The authors classified the cristae into lamellar cristae and tubular cristae and then analyzed those different crista structures in various yeast deletion and temperature-sensitive mutants by EM. They found that lamellar cristae are formed by Mgm1, which mediates inner membrane fusion, in cooperation with the MICOS complex, the crista junction forming machinery, and the ATPase dimer, which forms highly bended crista rims. On the other hand, they found that tubular cristae are formed by the MICOS complex and ATPase dimer, but not by Mgm1. They proposed a new model on how the IM fusion by Mgm1 leads to lamellar cristae together with the MICOS complex and ATPase dimer. This overall conclusive hypothesis is consistent with earlier studies on mitochondrial morphology and dynamics and several key points are supported by new experimental data. The cornerstones of this model are: 1) Tubular and lamellar cristae are formed via different mechanisms. 2) Both pathways require the dimerization of ATP synthase and the MICOS machinery. 3) Tubular cristae are formed by triggering inner membrane invaginations, probably at MICOS complexes, that grow through vectorial transport of proteins and lipids into the emerging tubule. 4) Formation of lamellar cristae additionally requires the inner membrane fusion activity of Mgm1/OPA1. 5) The inner membrane fusion activity of Mgm1 is limited to sites of mitochondrial outer and inner membrane contacts. 6) Therefore, inner membrane fusion events leave behind double membrane sheets derived from the original sites of inner membrane tethering that finally become lamellar cristae. 7) Membrane bending at the rims of these new-born lamellar cristae is stabilized by dimerization and oligomerization of ATP synthase complexes. 8) Mgm1-mediated inner membrane fusion is stopped at the position of inner membrane MICOS complexes leading to the formation of crista junctions. In this way the MICOS complex prevents the complete detachment of the inner membrane fusion septum from the peripheral inner membrane."

Many different forms and subcomplexes of MICOS have been suggested, which raises the question, what is the nature of the molecular species detected with Mic27 antibodies in native gels western blots? Does MICOS dissociate into the recently demonstrated Mic10- and Mic60-containing subcomplexes in Su e-deficient mitochondria? Why does Dnm1 depletion enhance the level of the assembled MICOS complex?

The fusion events measured in this way comprise quite a number of steps including establishing contact with another mitochondrion, fusion of the outer membrane, all complex reactions. The situation in the experiment addressed here is very different since the OM is fused and the reactivated Mgm1 is ready for immediately starting fusion of two aligned membranes. In fact, the experiment suggested by one of the referees, the analysis of the mitochondrial morphology in <i>mgm1-5</i> cells upon temperature shifts, points also in this direction (see also further down). Cristae reappear faster than the mitochondrial network. This indicates, that reactivated Mgm1 does use the septa formed at non-permissive temperature to make new cristae.
