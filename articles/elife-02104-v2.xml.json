Mof is the enzymatic subunit of two different HAT complexes, MSL and NSL. The individual contribution of MSL and NSL to transcription regulation in mESCs is not well understood. Our genome-wide analysis show that i) MSL and NSL bind to specific and common sets of expressed genes, ii) NSL binds exclusively at promoters, iii) while MSL binds in gene bodies. Nsl1 regulates proliferation and cellular homeostasis of mESCs. MSL is the main HAT acetylating H4K16 in mESCs, is enriched at many mESC-specific and bivalent genes. MSL is important to keep a subset of bivalent genes silent in mESCs, while developmental genes require MSL for expression during differentiation. Thus, NSL and MSL HAT complexes differentially regulate specific sets of expressed genes in mESCs and during differentiation."

Mof is the enzymatic subunit of two different HAT complexes, MSL and NSL. The individual contribution of MSL and NSL to transcription regulation in mESCs is not well understood. Our genome-wide analysis show that i) MSL and NSL bind to specific and common sets of expressed genes, ii) NSL binds exclusively at promoters, iii) while MSL binds in gene bodies. Nsl1 regulates proliferation and cellular homeostasis of mESCs. MSL is the main HAT acetylating H4K16 in mESCs, is enriched at many mESC-specific and bivalent genes. MSL is important to keep a subset of bivalent genes silent in mESCs, while developmental genes require MSL for expression during differentiation. Thus, NSL and MSL HAT complexes differentially regulate specific sets of expressed genes in mESCs and during differentiation."

Specific transcription factors like Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog form a core transcriptional network, which is required for the maintenance of mESC pluripotency (<a href=\"#bib39\">Orkin et al., 2008</a>). Chromatin-modifying enzymes further regulate transcriptional mESCs networks and cellular differentiation processes and can be associated with activation or repression of genes (<a href=\"#bib38\">Orkin and Hochedlinger, 2011</a>). Histone acetylation is important for mESC pluripotency and is regulated by the concerted action of histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs) (<a href=\"#bib35\">Meshorer and Misteli, 2006</a>). Acetylation of histone proteins leads to an open and dynamic chromatin conformation allowing an active transcription state, which is also a signature of mESC pluripotency (<a href=\"#bib34\">Meshorer, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Niwa, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Efroni et al., 2008</a>). During differentiation of mESCs, the overall transcription rates decrease, whereas the chromatin structure becomes more compact with a global reduction of histone H3 and H4 acetylation. In line with the requirement of histone acetylation in mESC maintenance and differentiation, genetic deletion or knockdown of several HATs affects mESC pluripotency (<a href=\"#bib31\">Lin et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Fazzio et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Gupta et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Thomas et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Zhong and Jin, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Li et al., 2012</a>)."

These enzymes often function as part of multi-protein co-activator complexes (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib28\">Lee and Workman, 2007</a>). Mof (also known as Kat8 or Myst1), is a MYST-type HAT specific for histone H4 lysine 16 acetylation (H4K16ac) (<a href=\"#bib19\">Hilfiker et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Smith et al., 2001</a>, <a href=\"#bib47\">2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Taipale et al., 2005</a>) and has been shown to be the catalytic subunit of two distinct protein complexes in <i>Drosophila</i> (d) and mammals: the male-specific lethal (MSL) and the non-specific lethal (NSL) complexes (<a href=\"#bib47\">Smith et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Mendjan et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Cai et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Raja et al., 2010</a>). In <i>Drosophila</i>, the dMSL complex is targeted to transcribed regions of male X-chromosomal genes, where it mediates dosage compensation (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib48\">Straub and Becker, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Gelbart and Kuroda, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Conrad and Akhtar, 2011</a>). In contrast, dNSL is present at gene promoters of male and female chromosomes, where it regulates transcription of housekeeping genes (<a href=\"#bib40\">Prestel et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Raja et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Feller et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Lam et al., 2012</a>). Mof itself and subunits of the Mof-containing dMSL and dNSL HAT complexes are required for the binding of the two <i>Drosophila</i> Mof-containing complexes at promoters and gene bodies, which leads to H4K16 acetylation and gene expression (<a href=\"#bib42\">Raja et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Kadlec et al., 2011</a>)."

Mof deletion correlated with cell cycle defects and cell death. Moreover, mESCs could not be derived from <i>Mof</i><sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> mouse embryos. In agreement, it was shown that Mof plays an essential role in the maintenance of mESC pluripotency (<a href=\"#bib29\">Li et al., 2012</a>). H4K16 acetylation levels were undetectable in <i>Mof</i><sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> embryos, whereas the acetylation of other histone lysine residues was unaffected (<a href=\"#bib52\">Thomas et al., 2008</a>).

The obtained genome-wide binding maps show that MSL and NSL locate to a large number of expressed genes and each complex has a distinct binding profile at promoters or gene bodies. Our combined ChIP-seq and KD data indicate that MSL and NSL have a combinatorial effect on a given set of genes, whereas some specific loci are only MSL- or only NSL-dependent. Our data indicate that NSL binds exclusively at promoters, while MSL binds more in gene bodies. We show that in mESCs NSL regulates cell growth whereas MSL is the main HAT complex acetylating histone H4K16. MSL is present at mESC-specific genes. Moreover, MSL binds to and regulates developmental genes in mESCs and during differentiation. Altogether our data demonstrate that MSL and NSL complexes are present at expressed genes in mESCs, but that MSL is essential for regulation of key mESC-specific and bivalent developmental genes."

To this end, we raised antibodies targeting Msl1 or Nsl1, which are specific subunits of the MSL or NSL complexes, respectively, and are known to play a role in the assembly and the regulation of these complexes (<a href=\"#bib42\">Raja et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Kadlec et al., 2011</a>). The specificity of the purified antibodies was demonstrated by western blot assays and immunoprecipitations followed by mass spectrometry using the multidimensional protein identification technology (MudPIT) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Western blot assays indicated that both of the generated antibodies are specific (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>). In addition, both antibodies immunoprecipitated (IP-ed) the endogenous MSL and NSL complexes with the previously described polypeptide composition (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cai et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Importantly, Mof was identified in both IP-ed MSL or NSL complexes, in the same range of abundance than Msl1, or Nsl1 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a> for all identified proteins by MudPIT). Gel filtration followed by western blot analyses further indicated that Msl1 and Nsl1 are only present in Mof-containing complexes as they have eluted from the Superose 6 column in the same molecular weight containing fractions as their respective entire endogenous MSL (about 240 kDa), or NSL (about 800 kDa) complexes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Of note the enzymatic subunit Mof was detected in the respective MSL and NSL complexes, but in addition as a potentially free form in the 50 kDa range fractions (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). These results together demonstrate the incorporation of all nuclear Msl1, or Nsl1, together with Mof, in their respective endogenous complexes and a fraction of \u2018free\u2019 Mof that is not present in either MSL or NSL."

As a control, in the same five categories densities of Pol II peaks at promoters correlated with gene expression with decreasing Pol II densities from highly to poorly expressed genes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Barski et al., 2007</a>).

In contrast, there is no significant difference of the Nsl1 median values between the five groups, indicating that Nsl1-binding to promoters is not proportional with the level of expression (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). Our results thus demonstrate that both Msl1 and Nsl1 bind to active genes, but that only the binding strength of Msl1, and not that of Nsl1, correlates with mRNA levels, suggesting a different dynamic and/or functional behaviour of the two complexes at the regulated loci."

The comparison of the distribution patterns of Msl1, Nsl1, Pol II and H4K16ac around the TSSs (\u00b12 kb) of all Msl1- and Nsl1-bound genes further indicates that the Msl1 binding profile is more similar to the genome-wide presence of H4K16ac, than that of Nsl1 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>).

To address this question, we analysed the global acetylation of H4K16 after Msl1 or Nsl1 KD and also quantified acetylation of H4K5 and H4K8, two other proposed substrates for hNSL in differentiated human cells (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cai et al., 2010</a>). Western blot analyses of total histone proteins from mESCs expressing shRNAs targeting Msl1 or Nsl1 revealed a dramatic reduction of H4K16ac upon Msl1 depletion, whereas Nsl1 KD did not affect H4K16ac levels (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). This is in good agreement with the differential Msl1 and Nsl1 ChIP-seq profiles (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Moreover, H4K5ac and H4K8ac levels did not change in cells expressing either Msl1 or Nsl1 shRNA (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Altogether, the above results indicate that in mESCs (i) the enzymatic activity of the MSL complex is responsible for H4K16 acetylation downstream of the TSS, (ii) MSL is the main acetylase for H4K16 and (iii) the global H4K16 acetylating function of MSL cannot be compensated by other HAT complexes."

Our statistical analyses showed that these numbers are significant (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). To identify genes regulated specifically by MSL and/or by NSL, we analysed genes bound by only Msl1, by only Nsl1, or together by Msl1 and Nsl1 for gene ontology (GO). All three categories are enriched for GO terms such as metabolic process, gene expression, cell proliferation, and cell cycle. These GO terms represent housekeeping functions of every cell type, but can also be related to the cellular homeostasis of ESCs. Interestingly, genes bound by only Msl1 are enriched for GO terms such as embryo development, stem cell differentiation and maintenance (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Importantly, almost 50% of all reference genes associated with stem cell maintenance are Msl1 positive (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>)."

To further analyse the cellular roles of MSL and NSL in mESCs, Msl1, or Nsl1 were individually depleted by shRNA KD (see <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A\u2013D</a>). To exclude compensation between MSL and NSL complexes, a double KD of Msl1 and Nsl1 (shMsl1/shNsl1) was also carried out (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Next, total cell numbers were counted over 6 days. These analyses indicated that KD of Msl1 reduces slightly cell proliferation, while the KD of Nsl1, or the double KD of Msl1 and Nsl1 lead to a much slower cell growth (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). When analysing cell morphology under these KD conditions, we did not observe any change in mESC shape.

These FACS measurements demonstrated that mESCs treated with shMSL1, shNsl1 and shMsl1/shNsl1 accumulate in the G1-phase of the cell cycle, with shNsl1 and shMsl1/shNsl1 being more severe than shMsl1 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). These results together suggest that Nsl1 might be more required for regulating housekeeping genes involved in cellular homeostasis of mESCs, as reflected in higher number of G1-phase cells and decreased cell proliferation of shNsl1 and shMsl1/Nsl1 mESCs."

In shMsl1 KD cells, 275 genes were found to be downregulated (with Msl1 itself is in the downregulated list (<a href=\"#SD4-data\">Figure 7\u2014source data 1</a>)), and 500 genes upregulated, as compared to control KDs. By comparing Msl1-bound and Msl1-regulated genes (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>), we found that Msl1 is present at about 30% (105 genes) of all downregulated and at 20% (107 genes) of all upregulated genes. In Nsl1 KD conditions, 1158 genes are downregulated (including Nsl1 itself) and 429 are upregulated, as compared to KD controls (<a href=\"#SD4-data\">Figure 7\u2014source data 1</a>).

Along these lines, in our experimental system Msl1, or Nsl1 single, or double KD mESCs do not loose Oct4 expression (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), a common marker of mESC pluripotency."

Analysing the biological function of Msl1, Nsl1, or Mof downregulated genes, we observed GO terms like metabolic processes, gene expression, cell death, or cell cycle control (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). However, only downregulated genes in <i>Mof</i> KO mESCs are significantly enriched for GO terms like stem cell differentiation or maintenance (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>). Several of these genes are amongst the Msl1 positive mESC-specific genes, such as Nanog, Sox2, Oct4 (<a href=\"#bib29\">Li et al., 2012</a>) (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>).

Importantly, KD of Msl1 leads to the upregulation of developmental genes, such as <i>Nestin</i> and <i>Ntrk1</i> (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). These genes often contain both positive (H3K4me3) and negative (H3K27me3) epigenetic modifications (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>, <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). It is well established that H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 histone modifications co-localize at bivalent domains, which are poised for a quick activation during distinct differentiation processes (<a href=\"#bib3\">Azuara et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bernstein et al., 2006</a>). The Ezh2 subunit of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), which catalyzes histone H3K27 tri-methylation, is also a good marker of bivalent domains (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bernstein et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Ku et al., 2008</a>). To determine whether Msl1, or Nsl1, would bind to bivalent domains genome-wide, we compared the combined list of all Msl1 and Nsl1 binding sites with Pol II and Ezh2 profiles, together with H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 marks (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>). The heatmap indicates that about 343 Msl1 binding sites significantly co-localize with Ezh2, H3K27me3, and H3K4me3, which define the bivalent domains (see Cluster C in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>, <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1B</a> for statistical analyses). Importantly, these 343 bivalent domain sites are negative for Nsl1 binding. The presence of Msl1 (our study) and Mof (<a href=\"#bib29\">Li et al., 2012</a>) at bivalent genes in mESCs suggests that the MSL complex is involved in keeping these developmental genes silenced, but poised for activation in mESCs."

Bivalent genes such as Pax6, Hes5, Mapt2 and Nestin, which are also considered as key markers of NPC differentiation, were upregulated in pluripotent mESC under Msl1 KD conditions (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>; and see above).

In differentiated human cells Mof, and subunits of MSL (i.e. Msl1, Msl3) or the Nsl1 subunit of NSL have been reported to be crucial for global H4K16 acetylation by either MSL or NSL, respectively (<a href=\"#bib30\">Li et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Zhao et al., 2013</a>). Thus, while the subunit composition of the two Mof-containing MSL and NSL complexes is conserved between mESCs and differentiated human cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Cai et al., 2010</a>), the function of the NSL complex seems to be differently regulated in pluripotent mESCs than in differentiated cells. Our observation that the KD of the Nsl1 subunit of NSL does not abolish global H4K16ac levels in mESCs suggests that in these pluripotent cells NSL may have a very localized HAT activity around TSSs of bound genes and the acetylation at these loci cannot be detected in total histone preparations, in contrary to the Msl1 KD. This difference may also be due to the more dynamic recruitment of NSL by mESC-specific factors. In contrast to MSL, NSL binding to promoters does not correlate with RNA expression levels (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B\u2013D</a>). This further suggests that the two Mof-containing complexes have different mechanisms of action in transcriptional regulation in mESCs. Moreover, the depletion of MSL function is supposed to recapitulate those chromatin perturbations and related cellular changes that are caused by the Mof KO and are linked to H4K16ac loss."

As contrary to Msl1 and Nsl1, \u2018free\u2019 Mof was detected in mESC nuclear extracts (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>), we cannot exclude the possibility that to certain extent Mof alone could compensate for the function of the MSL or NSL complex under Nsl1 and Msl1 KD conditions. However, the abolished global H4K16ac levels in shMsl1 mESCs would rather propose that other transcriptional co-activators, modifying other histone residues than H4K16, could compensate the role of H4K16ac in transcriptional activation."

The HAT Mof is important for mESC pluripotency. Mof-deficient embryos have slight cell cycle defects and undergo cell death (<a href=\"#bib52\">Thomas et al., 2008</a>). Under our experimental conditions, KD of Msl1 and Nsl1 alone or together did not affect expression of key transcription factors of the pluripotency network (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figures 6A</a>, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). Our observation that in mESCs Nsl1 KD leads to decreased cell numbers during proliferation and an increase in cells in the G1-phase of the cell cycle shows that NSL might influence mESC proliferation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B\u2013D</a>).

Our data showing that Msl1 KD abolishes global H4K16ac levels, together with the aberrant chromatin compaction observed in the Mof-deficient embryos (<a href=\"#bib52\">Thomas et al., 2008</a>), suggest that the MSL complex is an important factor in establishing high acetylation levels required for more open chromatin conformation and consequent mESC pluripotency. In addition to its role as a general regulator of H4K16ac in mESCs, the MSL complex seems to be recruited to ESC-specific loci to regulate different steps in the transcription process, such as (i) chromatin accessibility, (ii) pre-initiation complex formation and/or (iii) Pol II transcription elongation rates. Importantly, the Msl1-bound mESC-specific genes are regulated by Mof. Note however, these Mof- and Msl1-bound and Mof-regulated genes were not affected by the KD of Msl1 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B\u2013D</a>, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E,F</a>). As above explained this may be due to the different experimental systems used here and the <i>Mof</i> KO study. Nevertheless, we assume that these genes are regulated by the whole MSL complex.

So far, little is known about the function of HATs at bivalent genes. Interestingly, we show that a subset of bivalent genes (about 350 genes) is bound by MSL in ESCs (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A,B</a>, <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>) and consequently that the KD of Msl1 results in the upregulation of a subset of bivalent genes in mESCs (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>). Consistent with our study, Mof has also been shown to be present at bivalent genes (<a href=\"#bib29\">Li et al., 2012</a>). It seems that the MSL complex, probably in concert with HDACs and/or other chromatin remodelling factors, can have a silencing function at these bivalent genes. In contrast, the same genes require MSL for expression during differentiation (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a>). Even though the morphology of NPCs was not obviously influenced under Msl1 KD conditions, expression of key developmental NPC genes, such as Pax6 and Hes5, were downregulated during NPC differentiation (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a>). Thus, our findings together with the observation that Mof is also binding to bivalent genes in mESCs, strongly suggests that the presence of MSL at bivalent loci is important for keeping these bivalent genes poised in pluripotent mESCs, allowing a quick transcriptional upregulation of the same genes during mESC differentiation."

NSL binds mostly to genes with housekeeping functions and mediates mESC proliferation suggesting that NSL is important for the cellular homeostasis of mESCs. MSL is the main acetyltransferase complex acetylating H4K16. Moreover, MSL binds to mESC-specific genes, which are de-regulated in <i>Mof</i> ablated mESCs. Moreover MSL is present at bivalent domains in mESCs, where it may poise genes for activation during mESC differentiation.

In summary, protein mixtures were TCA precipitated, urea-denaturated, reduced, alkylated, and digested with endoproteinase Lys-C (Roche) followed by modified trypsin digestion (Promega). Peptide mixtures were loaded onto a triphasic 100 \u03bcm diameter fused silica microcapillary column described as follows (<a href=\"#bib32\">McDonald and Yates, 2002</a>). Loaded microcapillary columns were placed in-line with a Quaternary Dionex Ultimate 3000 HPLC pump and a LTQ Velos linear ion trap mass spectrometer equipped with a nano-LC electrospray ionization source (ThermoFischerScientific). A fully automated 12-steps MudPIT run was performed as previously described (<a href=\"#bib15\">Florens et al., 2006</a>) during which each full MS scan (from 300 to 1700 m/z range) was followed by 20 MS/MS events using data-dependent acquisition. Proteins were identified by database searching using SEQUEST (<a href=\"#bib12\">Eng et al., 1994</a>) within ThermoProteome Discoverer 1.3 and 1.4 (ThermoFischerScientific). Tandem mass spectra were searched against a <i>Mus musculus</i> protein sequence database containing 16,604 entries (from the Swissprot 2013-04-03 release). In all searches, cysteine residues were considered to be fully carboxyamidomethylated (+57 Da statically added) and methionine considered to be oxidized (+16 Da dynamically added). Proteins were considered as specific in a given IP data set if they were absent or 10-fold minimum enriched as compared to a MOCK IP, performed on the same protein input by using a non-specific antibody targeting yeast TAF90. Relative protein abundance for each protein in either the anti-Msl1, or the anti-Nsl1 IPs was estimated by the calculation of a Normalized Spectral Abundance Factor (NSAF) (<a href=\"#bib60\">Zybailov et al., 2006</a>). NSAF values were calculated from the spectral counts of each identified protein. To account for the fact that following enzymatic digestion larger proteins result in more peptides/spectras than small proteins, each given spectral count was divided by the corresponding protein length to provide a spectral abundance factor (SAF). To obtain NSAF, SAF values were normalized against the sum of all SAF values in the corresponding run. Thus, NSAF values obtained from a given protein mixture, such as immunoprecipitated protein complexes, allow the comparison of the abundance of a given protein/subunit to another in the same mixture/complex."

Moreover, mRNA expression of selected genes was analysed by (RT)-qPCR, whereas primer sequences are summarized in <a href=\"#SD5-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>. Total RNA, which was used for gene expression profiles and cDNA synthesis, was isolated with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and treated with DNAse. cDNA was synthesized with Transcriptor reverse transcriptase (Roche) using random hexamers according to the manufacturer's protocol. For normalization of protein amount by WB analyses the anti-Tubulin (T6557; Sigma-Aldrich) antibody and ponceau solution (Sigma-Aldrich) was applied. To analyse the pluripotency state of KD mESCs the anti-Oct4 (611202; BD Labs) antibody was used. To analyse cell morphology images were taken with the digital inverted EVOS XL core (Fisher Scientific, France) microscope using a 10X objective."

First we determined total cell numbers of ESCs, in which we depleted either Msl1, or NSL1, or both. Under these conditions we observed that especially shNsl1 and shMsl1/Nsl1 ESCs had a much slower cell proliferation rate, when compared to control ESCs, whereas the morphology of these ECS was not altered (see new <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A and 6B</a>). Next we measured whether the observed reduction of cell numbers was due to apoptosis. However, we did not find any increase in apoptotic cells under these KD conditions (new <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2013figure supplement 1B</a>). Therefore next we tested whether the KD ESCs would be blocked in any particular cell cycle phase by using FACS analyses (new <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). In agreement with the above observed cell numbers, we found that KD ESCs accumulated in G1-phase of the cell cycle and that this increase was more severe in shNsl1 and shMsl1/Nsl1 ESCs. We have further described these new observations in the Results section \u201cNSL influences cellular proliferation of mESC\u201d."

As described in the Results and Discussion sections of our revised version, we cannot exclude that the lentiviral KDs are only partially efficient or the compensation of MSL and/or NSL function by \u201cfree\u201d Mof (see also new <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a> and our answer to point 3). Even though the pluripotency state does not seem to be affected (as judged by the expression of the used markers) and the double knockdown does not entirely recapitulate the Mof KO phenotype, our new results suggest that Nsl1 is more required for regulating housekeeping genes involved in cellular homeostasis of mESCs.

For this, mESCs were differentiated into neuronal progenitor cells (NPCs) under control and Msl1 KD conditions (see new <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2013figure supplement 1C</a>). First, we analysed expression profiles of bivalent as well as developmental genes, such as Pax6, Hes5, Mapt2 and Nestin, which are also considered as key markers of NPC differentiation. Importantly, our new results show that while these key developmental marker genes, including several bivalent genes, become upregulated in pluripotent mESC under Msl1 KD conditions (new <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>), their expression are in contrary downregulated in NPCs in which Msl1 was silenced during NPC differentiation (new <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a>). Note however, that Msl1 KD cells morphologically are still able to form NPC-like cells (Figure 8\u2013figure supplement 8D). These new results indicate the important regulatory requirement of the MSL complex for the expression of bivalent genes, known to become upregulated during cellular differentiation, in mESC and further differentiated NPCs. These new observations and figures are described in the Results section and further discussed in the Discussion section."

Knockdown of Msl1 leads to a global loss of histone H4K16ac indicating that MSL is the main HAT acetylating H4K16 in mESCs. MSL is enriched at many mESC-specific genes, but also at bivalent domains. Interestingly, MSL is important to keep a subset of bivalent genes silent in pluripotent ESCs, while the same genes require MSL for expression during differentiation. In agreement, during neuronal differentiation MSL is essential for the regulation of key developmental genes."

However, at this specific loci neither Nsl1, nor Msl1 can be detected. This can be explained by several ways: a) the \u201cfree\u201d Mof detected in ESC nuclear extracts (see new <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a> and our answers to point 3) is binding at these sites, b) the anti-mMof antibody used in the ChIP-seq study, in addition to mouse Mof, is also recognizing another protein (with a similar epitope) that may also bind to DNA, or c) due to their specific conformation and/or involvement in special chromatin structures neither MsL1, nor Nsl1 can be crosslinked at these sites. Along the same lines, Straub et. al. (2013 Genome Research), when comparing ChIP-chip and ChIP-seq profiles, suggested that <i>Drosophila</i> Msl1 and Mof might not be detectable by ChIP-seq approaches in genebodies due to the extensive fragmentation of chromatin (to obtain very small DNA fragments (200 bp)), which are then used for sequencing. Thus, extensive fragmentation might result in disruption, or at least partial disruption, of large chromatin-bound complexes, resulting in ChIP-seq signal loss of proteins not directly associated with the chromatin. If Mof would be closer to the DNA than Msl1, or Nsl1, respectively, in MSL or NSL complexes at certain loci, the sole detection of Mof could be explained by the suggestion of Straub et al (2013)."

As during enzymatic digestions of protein mixtures for proteomic analyses large proteins contribute more peptide/spectra than small ones, a normalized spectral abundance factor (NSAF) was defined to account for the effect of protein length on spectral count for comparing protein abundance in the different samples (<a href=\"#bib60\">Zybailov et al. 2006</a>, Journal of Proteome Research; <a href=\"#bib15\">Florens et al. 2006</a>, Methods). NSAF is calculated as the number of spectral counts (SpC) identifying a protein, divided by the protein\u2019s length (L), divided by the sum of SpC/L for all proteins in the experiment. Thus, NSAF allows the comparison of abundance of individual proteins in multiple independent samples and has been applied to quantify the subunit abundance in various protein mixtures and in multiprotein complexes (<a href=\"#bib15\">Florens et al. 2006</a>, Methods; Paoletti et al. 2006, PNAS; Bieniossek et al. 2013, Nature). This NSAF counting method provides an easy way of identifying proteins with similar (or different) abundances in immunoprecipitated (IP-ed) protein complexes using MudPIT. This is the method we used. As the NSAF values of Msl1 (7,8) and Mof (13,5), or Nsl1 (9,3) and Mof (14), were in a comparable range (see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>) in either the anti-Msl1, or the anti-Nsl1 protein immunoprecipitations, we concluded that all the IP-ed Msl1, or Nsl1 associated with comparable amounts of Mof in mESCs, respectively. If free Msl1 or Nsl1 had been present in mESCs, the NSAF values would have been much higher for Msl1 than for Mof, or for Nsl1 than for Mof, which was clearly not the case."

This new data (shown in new <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>) now further indicates that Msl1 and Nsl1 incorporate in their respective complexes (together with Mof), which elute from the GF column at their respective molecular weights (250 kDa for MSL and 760 kDa for NSL). Moreover, we did not detect any free Msl1, or Nsl1 (in the 65 kDa and 130 kDa range), respectively) present in mESC nuclear extracts. Thus, we can assume that Msl1 and Nsl1 ChIP-seq profiles are representative for MSL and NSL complex binding (however see also answer to point 2). Moreover, our new GF results showing the elution of Mof in the 50 kDa range (without Nsl1 and Msl1), suggest the existence of a small \u201cfree\u201c Mof pool in ESCs."
