Other mammals are known to actively engage in such \u2018olfactory sampling\u2019 but there was no evidence of anything resembling these behaviors in humans. Now, in <i>eLife</i>, Noam Sobel and co-workers at the Weizmann Institute of Science\u2014including Idan Frumin as first author\u2014present a remarkably ingenious and carefully designed series of studies revealing that handshaking is very likely to serve this purpose in humans (<a href=\"#bib3\">Frumin et al., 2015</a>)."

This opened the door for the critical experiment in which volunteers\u2014who believed they were waiting to take part in a research study\u2014were greeted by an experimenter who entered the room three minutes after the volunteers were seated. During the 20 second greeting, the experimenter either shook the right hand of the volunteer, or they did not shake hands at all. The researchers then analyzed the hand movements of the volunteers for 80 seconds before and after the greeting via hidden video recordings."

However, the volunteers who shook hands with someone of the opposite gender spent more time with their left (i.e. non-shaking) hand near their face. Indeed, the analysis also revealed that their hands contacted their face in the immediate vicinity of their nose (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Frumin et al. also examined the airflow in the nose before and after a handshake. They found that when a volunteer held their hand close to their nose, the airflow in the nose was more than twice the level during normal breathing, which suggests that the volunteers were indeed sniffing their hands."

Oddly, the male chemosignal had the same effect on the behavior of the volunteers as the female chemosignal, although this effect was weaker.

How do such chemosignals affect human behavior, beyond the hand sniffing behaviors demonstrated in this research? Why do same gender and opposite gender handshakes produce different patterns of hand sniffing? Could these patterns be driven by cultural factors?"

The elegance of introducing a new perspective, as Sobel, Frumin and co-workers have done in this study, is that it not only opens our eyes to a previously ignored phenomenon, but also stimulates new research questions."
