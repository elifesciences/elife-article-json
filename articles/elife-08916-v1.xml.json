However, it is not known where in the secretory pathway GnT1IP-L inhibits MGAT1, nor whether GnT1IP-L inhibits other N-glycan branching N-acetylglucosaminyltransferases of the medial Golgi. We show here that the luminal domain of GnT1IP-L contains its inhibitory activity. Retention of GnT1IP-L in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) via the N-terminal region of human invariant chain p33, with or without C-terminal KDEL, markedly reduced inhibitory activity. Dynamic fluorescent resonance energy transfer (FRET) and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays revealed homomeric interactions for GnT1IP-L in the ER, and heteromeric interactions with MGAT1 in the Golgi. GnT1IP-L did not generate a FRET signal with MGAT2, MGAT3, MGAT4B or MGAT5 medial Golgi GlcNAc-tranferases. GnT1IP/<i>Mgat4d</i> transcripts are expressed predominantly in spermatocytes and spermatids in mouse, and are reduced in men with impaired spermatogenesis."

However, it is not known where in the secretory pathway GnT1IP-L inhibits MGAT1, nor whether GnT1IP-L inhibits other N-glycan branching N-acetylglucosaminyltransferases of the medial Golgi. We show here that the luminal domain of GnT1IP-L contains its inhibitory activity. Retention of GnT1IP-L in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) via the N-terminal region of human invariant chain p33, with or without C-terminal KDEL, markedly reduced inhibitory activity. Dynamic fluorescent resonance energy transfer (FRET) and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays revealed homomeric interactions for GnT1IP-L in the ER, and heteromeric interactions with MGAT1 in the Golgi. GnT1IP-L did not generate a FRET signal with MGAT2, MGAT3, MGAT4B or MGAT5 medial Golgi GlcNAc-tranferases. GnT1IP/<i>Mgat4d</i> transcripts are expressed predominantly in spermatocytes and spermatids in mouse, and are reduced in men with impaired spermatogenesis."

A rat testis membrane-bound form has been termed GL54D but its activity has not been determined (<a href=\"#bib1\">Au et al., 2015</a>). The mouse homologue of GL54D is the shorter transcript, previously termed GnT1IP-S (<a href=\"#bib16\">Huang and Stanley, 2010</a>), and recently designated MGAT4D by the Human Genome Nomenclature Committee. When the N-terminus of GnT1IP-S is extended by a Myc or HA tag, it becomes membrane-bound and inhibits MGAT1 in cultured cells, similar to GnT1IP-L. In male germ cells mouse GnT1IP-S is probably membrane-bound like its rat homologue GL54D (<a href=\"#bib1\">Au et al., 2015</a>).

The specificity of GnT1IP-L for MGAT1 compared to related medial Golgi GlcNAc-transferases, and the interactions of GnT1IP-L in the ER and Golgi, were investigated by dynamic fluorescent resonance energy transfer (FRET) and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) experiments that previously identified homomeric and heteromeric interactions between Golgi glycosyltransferases (<a href=\"#bib27\">Rivinoja et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Hassinen et al., 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib14\">2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Hassinen and Kellokumpu, 2014</a>). The combined results show that GnT1IP-L inhibitory activity lies in its luminal domain, that it forms homomers in the ER, and in the Golgi it forms heteromers specifically with MGAT1. Interestingly, data extracted from published RNA-seq and microarray experiments reveal differential and complementary expression of mouse <i>Mgat1</i> and GnT1IP/<i>Mgat4d</i> genes in male Sertoli and germ cells, and show that transcripts of human GnT1IP/<i>MGAT4D</i> are markedly reduced in testis biopsies of men with impaired spermatogenesis."

Resistance to L-PHA, accompanied by increased expression of cell surface oligomannose N-glycans detected by GNA, are hallmarks of inhibition of MGAT1 activity in CHO cells (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chen and Stanley, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Huang and Stanley, 2010</a>). The subcellular localization of each construct was investigated by transient transfection of HeLa cells and analysis of immunofluorescence using antibodies to Myc or HA, Golgi \u03b1-mannosidase II (MAN2A1), or GM130, or ER protein disulfide isomerase (PDI). In initial experiments, five Phe residues in the GnT1IP-L TM domain were all replaced with either Leu (similar hydrophobicity index to Phe) or Ala (hydrophobicity reduced \u223c50% compared to Phe or Leu). Transfectants expressing GnT1IP-L(F/L) or GnT1IP-L(F/A) (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>) at similar levels based on western analysis, had an increased ability to bind GNA, and exhibited resistance to the toxicity of L-PHA (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a> and data not shown).

The chimeric protein was localized to the Golgi compartment (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>), was well expressed, and conferred resistance to L-PHA in stable CHO transfectant populations (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,C</a>). The L-PHA resistance assay in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a> shows transfectants or control cells that were stained by methylene blue after \u223c3 days of growth from 2000 cells plated in the presence of increasing concentrations of L-PHA. Plates were stained when wells incubated in medium alone (no L-PHA) had become confluent. The variability seen in the proportion of transfectants highly resistant to L-PHA in populations expressing GnT1IP-L mutant or chimeric proteins is due to variable expression levels of cDNAs and is also observed with wild-type GnT1IP-L (see Figure 5B; <a href=\"#bib16\">Huang and Stanley, 2010</a>). The important parameter is the proportion of cells in a transfectant population that consistently resist the toxicity of L-PHA. Homogenous mutant Lec1 CHO cells that completely lack MGAT1, or cells selected for high expression of GnT1IP-L (<a href=\"#bib16\">Huang and Stanley, 2010</a>), are uniformly resistant to L-PHA (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>)."

This result suggests that the luminal domain of GnT1IP-L is responsible for its ability to inhibit MGAT1. An important control was to examine the reverse chimera\u2014the cytoplasmic and TM domains of GnT1IP-L linked to the luminal domain of MGAT1, termed GnT1IP-L/MGAT1-Myc (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> and <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). This chimera did not cause stable transfectants to become resistant to L-PHA (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>), and did not induce hypersensitivity to Con A (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>), in two independent clones with equivalent expression (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). In addition, the activity of MGAT1 in the GnT1IP-L/MGAT1-Myc transfectant lysates was 6.1 or 15.5 nmol/mg protein/hr, respectively, compared to 7.7 nmol/mg/hr in a CHO cell lysate and 0.5 nmol/mg protein/hr in a Lec1 lysate. The activity of B4GALT1 in the same lysates was equivalent (16\u201321 nmol/mg protein/hr). A separate experiment with the same extracts gave qualitatively similar results. The fact that one GnT1IP-L/MGAT1-Myc transfectant did not have increased MGAT1 activity may reflect the efficiency of active enzyme formation when the chimeric protein was overexpressed. Nevertheless, it is clear that GnT1IP-L/MGAT1-Myc does not significantly inhibit MGAT1 activity whereas MGAT1/GnT1IP-L is inhibitory. Thus, the GnT1IP-L luminal domain is active when localized by the MGAT1 cytoplasmic and TM domain, and the luminal domain of GnT1IP-L is necessary to inhibit MGAT1 activity."

Previous experiments have shown that GnT1IP-L does not inhibit MGAT3 activity, although it interacted with MGAT3 in immunoprecipitation assays in CHO cell lysate. MGAT1 and MGAT2 form a complex (<a href=\"#bib25\">Nilsson et al., 1993</a>, <a href=\"#bib23\">1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Opat et al., 2000</a>), and their interactions have been directly observed in a dynamic FRET assay (<a href=\"#bib15\">Hassinen et al., 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib14\">2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Hassinen and Kellokumpu, 2014</a>). To determine if GnT1IP-L inhibits medial Golgi glycosyltransferases other than MGAT1, CHO stable transfectants expressing HA-GnT1IP-L were assayed for MGAT2 and MGAT5 activities. A specific acceptor for MGAT4 was not available for assay. Relative expression was determined as a ratio to B4GALT1 activity, which is not affected by GnT1IP-L (<a href=\"#bib16\">Huang and Stanley, 2010</a>). It can be seen in <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a> (<a href=\"#SD6-data\">Source code 1</a>) that whereas GnT1IP-L inhibited MGAT1 activity by \u223c75%, MGAT2 and MGAT5 activities were not markedly inhibited in CHO cells. We also found that GnT1IP-L inhibits MGAT1 activity in COS-7 cells, and induces increased expression of GNA binding reflecting increased expression of oligomannose N-glycans at the surface of COS-7 cells, as expected when MGAT1 is inhibited (data not shown)."

Previous assays of glycosyltransferases tagged at the C-terminus by monomeric cerulean (mCer) or monomeric venus (mVen) determined FRET interactions by flow cytometry and showed that numerous glycosyltransferases of the N- and O-glycan pathways form homomers in the ER and heteromers in the Golgi (<a href=\"#bib27\">Rivinoja et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Hassinen et al., 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib14\">2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Rivinoja et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Hassinen and Kellokumpu, 2014</a>). The latter heteromeric interactions occur between glycosyltransferases that act sequentially in the same glycan pathway and in the same compartment of the Golgi. Interactions between GnT1IP-L and medial Golgi GlcNAc-transferases MGAT1 to MGAT5 were investigated by the same methods via transient transfection into COS-7 or Lec1 CHO cells stably expressing GnT1IP-L, or transient co-transfection of GnT1IP-L cDNA with an individual MGAT cDNA. Mouse GnT1IP-L-mVen was investigated for interactions with mouse or human MGAT1, MGAT2, MGAT3, MGAT4B and MGAT5. First, it was shown by fluorescence microscopy that each of the human GlcNAc-transferases tagged with mChe localized correctly to the Golgi when transfected into COS-7 or Lec1 CHO cells stably expressing GnT1IP-L-mVen (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a> and data not shown). Measurements of FRET efficiencies revealed that GnT1IP-L interacted with MGAT1 but not with MGAT2, MGAT3, MGAT4B or MGAT5 in COS-7 or Lec1 CHO cells which lack endogenous MGAT1 (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chen and Stanley, 2003</a>) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a> and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a>). The same results were obtained with the mouse GlcNAc-transferases (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a> and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a>). The lower FRET efficiencies of mouse enzymes may reflect species differences as lower expression of all mouse MGAT constructs was observed. If the data are expressed as a percentage of the MGAT1/GnT1IP-L interaction, no differences are evident between mouse and human interactions. These data also show that GnT1IP-L forms homomers with itself as well as heteromers with MGAT1. The specificity of the FRET signal between GnT1IP-L and MGAT1 was further demonstrated by inhibition of complex formation by overexpression of either GnT1IP-L-HA or MGAT1-HA (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a> and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a>). As expected, overexpression of HA-tagged MGAT2, MGAT3, MGAT4B or MGAT5 did not inhibit the FRET signal induced by co-transfection of GnT1IP-L and MGAT1 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>)."

This paradigm was also investigated for GnT1IP-L and MGAT1 using BiFC analysis with N-terminal Venus (VN) or C-terminal Venus (VC) fragments attached to the C-terminus of MGAT1 or GnT1IP-L. Expression and Golgi localization of VN and VC fusion proteins were confirmed by staining with rabbit anti-GFP Ab (detected with anti-rabbit Ab conjugated to Alexa Fluor 594), and goat anti-GFP Ab (detected with anti-goat Ab conjugated to Alexa Fluor 405). Confocal microscopy was performed with a filter set that detected BiFC signal (green), VN signal (red) and VC signal (blue).

To determine if Golgi acidity is also important for the formation of GnT1IP-L heteromers with MGAT1, COS-7 cells stably expressing GnT1IP-L-mVen were co-transfected either with GnT1IP-L-mChe or MGAT1-mChe, and treated with 40 \u03bcM chloroquine for 4 hr (added 16 hr post-transfection), or for 16 hr (added at 8 hr post-transfection). Compared to untreated controls, either treatment with chloroquine did not significantly reduce GnT1IP-L homomers, but caused an \u223c60% reduction in GnT1IP-L/MGAT1 heteromers (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a> and <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 8\u2014source data 1</a>). To evaluate whether this reduction in heteromers is accompanied by an increase in the amount of GnT1IP-L homomers, MGAT1-HA and GnT1IP-L-mChe were co-transfected into cells stably expressing GnT1IP-L-mVen, and treated with chloroquine. The proportion of homomers increased almost twofold, presumably due to the disruption of heteromer formation (16 hr treatment), or their disassembly (4 hr treatment) at the higher Golgi pH (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a> and <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 8\u2014source data 1</a>). Chloroquine treatment did not impair the Golgi localization of any of the test proteins (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>). Therefore GnT1IP-L, like MGAT1 as shown previously (<a href=\"#bib13\">Hassinen and Kellokumpu, 2014</a>), forms homomers in the ER and heteromers with MGAT1 in the acidic Golgi lumen, where it inhibits MGAT1 activity."

                                "text": "We previously identified a potential function for GnT1IP-L in testis based on the observation that cells expressing GnT1IP-L, Myc-GnT1IP-S or lacking MGAT1 bind more tightly to a Sertoli cell line (<a href=\"#bib16\">Huang and Stanley, 2010</a>). Lectin histology experiments in mouse and rat have shown that spermatocytes bind low levels of L-PHA (<a href=\"#bib18\">Jones et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Batista et al., 2012</a>), reflecting low expression of complex N-glycans due potentially to inhibition of MGAT1 by GnT1IP-L (<a href=\"#bib18\">Jones et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Batista et al., 2012</a>). The GnT1IP/<i>Mgat4d</i> gene is very highly expressed in mouse testes compared to all other tissues (see <i>Mgat4d</i> BioGPS microarray data [<a href=\"#bib38\">Wu et al., 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib37\">2013</a>]). In mouse germ cells, expression of GnT1IP/<i>Mgat4d</i> based on microarray and RT-PCR data is very low in spermatogonia, highest in spermatocytes and intermediate in spermatids (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chalmel et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Huang and Stanley, 2010</a>). This expression pattern in mouse germ cells is complementary to <i>Mgat1</i> that is high in spermatogonia, and greatly reduced in spermatocytes (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chalmel et al., 2007</a>). Very similar results are evident from an analysis of mouse RNA-Seq data that we interrogated for GnT1IP/<i>Mgat4d</i> and <i>Mgat1</i> transcripts (Gene Expression Omnibus Dataset GSE43717; [<a href=\"#bib30\">Soumillon et al., 2013a</a>, <a href=\"#bib31\">2013b</a>]). Mapping the relative expression values of GnT1IP/<i>Mgat4D,</i> (ENSMUSG00000035057) and <i>Mgat1</i> (ENSMUSG00000020346) onto the expression values of all 36,823 transcripts for different mouse germ cell subtypes clearly indicates that GnT1IP/<i>Mgat4D</i> (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>, blue) is exclusively expressed in post-meiotic germ cells (<a href=\"#SD4-data\">Figure 9\u2014source data 1</a>). In contrast, <i>Mgat1</i> (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>, red) is expressed at lower levels in all germ cell types, as well as somatic Sertoli cells. These results, as well as the observation that antibodies to rat GnT1IP (GL54D) detect signals in spermatocytes and spermatids but not spermatogonia (<a href=\"#bib1\">Au et al., 2015</a>), suggest post-meiotic transcriptional activation of the GnT1IP/<i>Mgat4d</i> gene. Interestingly, examination of the Soumillon et al. RNA-Seq data for the 130 nucleotides upstream of the <i>Mgat4d</i> start site which encode the sequence specific to GnT1IP-L, revealed very low numbers of reads that were not significant (data not shown). This may reflect the regulated expression of GnT1IP-L during spermatogenesis (<a href=\"#bib17\">Iguchi et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Huang and Stanley, 2010</a>)."

The data show that GnT1IP/<i>MGAT4D</i> transcripts are very poorly expressed in all testicular phenotypes in which there are no pre-meiotic germ cells in the germinal epithelium (Tubular atrophy, TA; Sertoli cell only syndrome, SCO), or only pre-meiotic germ cells (only spermatogonia present (SPG)) (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10A</a>; <a href=\"#SD5-data\">Figure 10\u2014source data 1</a>). It is also evident that the phenotype of meiotic arrest (MA), which in the majority of cases occurs at the level of pachytene spermatocytes in the human, exhibits no significant GnT1IP/<i>MGAT4D</i> expression. However, testicular phenotypes presenting with reduced (hypospermatogenesis, HYS) or normal and unimpaired levels of round and elongated spermatids (full spermatogenesis, FS), display a massive increase in GnT1IP/<i>MGAT4D</i> expression.

A small increase at the level of spermatogonia suggests that, in humans, <i>MGAT1</i> is expressed in spermatogonia whereas GnT1IP/<i>MGAT4D</i> is not, tallying with the data obtained from mouse microarray studies (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chalmel et al., 2007</a>).

                        "text": "In this paper we show that the MGAT1 inhibitory activity of GnT1IP-L requires its luminal domain. Thus, mutations in the TM domain from Phe to Leu or Ala, or swapping the cytoplasmic and TM domain with that of MGAT1, do not significantly reduce GnT1IP-L inhibitor activity. The requirement for the luminal domain is consistent with our previous findings that removal of the C-terminal 39 aa of membrane-bound GnT1IP-S, or the stem domain of GnT1IP-L, abrogate inhibitor activity (<a href=\"#bib16\">Huang and Stanley, 2010</a>). The specificity of GnT1IP-L for MGAT1 vs other GlcNAc-transferases of the medial Golgi was investigated here using BiFC and a dynamic FRET assay. These experiments showed no significant FRET activity between GnT1IP-L and MGAT2, MGAT3, MGAT4B or MGAT5. The only substantial FRET signal was obtained between GnT1IP-L and MGAT1, and this signal could only be inhibited by overexpression of either GnT1IP-L or MGAT1. As this result implies, and as shown previously for MGAT1, GnT1IP-L forms homomers with itself, as well as heteromers with MGAT1. These interactions were further defined using BiFC and FRET experiments following treatment with nocodazole or chloroquine. The combined data show that GnT1IP-L preferentially forms homomers in cells treated with nocodazole when it is confined to the ER, and heteromers with MGAT1 following nocodazole removal and a recovery period when it moves to the Golgi. GnT1IP-L homomers are also formed preferentially when the Golgi pH is elevated by treatment with chloroquine. Therefore, GnT1IP-L behaves like the glycosyltransferases previously studied (<a href=\"#bib13\">Hassinen and Kellokumpu, 2014</a>), interacting with itself in the ER and primarily with MGAT1 in the Golgi. It is interesting that GnT1IP-L showed no FRET interaction with MGAT2 which is predicted to be in a \u2018kin recognition\u2019 complex with MGAT1 (<a href=\"#bib25\">Nilsson et al., 1993</a>, <a href=\"#bib23\">1994</a>), and which has been shown to form heteromers with MGAT1 using the dynamic FRET assay used here (<a href=\"#bib15\">Hassinen et al., 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib14\">2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Hassinen and Kellokumpu, 2014</a>). GnT1IP-L also did not inhibit or disrupt the formation of MGAT1/MGAT2 heteromers in a competition assay. Therefore, it may be concluded that when GnT1IP-L is in a complex with MGAT1, MGAT2 is not excluded from that complex, and that GnT1IP-L binds to a different site on MGAT1 than MGAT2. In addition, our data show that overexpression of MGAT2 did not disrupt GnT1IP-L/MGAT1 heteromers. The same lack of competition was observed for overexpression of MGAT3, MGAT4B and MGAT5."

Thus, while the GL54D homologue GnT1IP-S is secreted from CHO cells (<a href=\"#bib16\">Huang and Stanley, 2010</a>), it is likely to be membrane-bound in mouse germ cells, similar to GL54D in rat (<a href=\"#bib1\">Au et al., 2015</a>)."

In characterizing the CHO N-glycans generated following expression of membrane-bound GnT1IP, no complex N-glycans that might reflect GlcNAc transfer were identified by mass spectrometry, but rather a great increase in the abundance of the Man<sub>5</sub>GlcNAc<sub>2</sub> substrate of MGAT1 was observed (<a href=\"#bib16\">Huang and Stanley, 2010</a>). In addition, we have shown that GnT1IP-L induces increased binding of GNA reflecting enhanced expression of oligomannose N-glycans, increased resistance to lectins that bind complex N-glycans, and/or inhibition of MGAT1 activity, in a variety of cell lines including CHO, COS-7, HeLa cells (<a href=\"#bib16\">Huang and Stanley, 2010</a>; this work) and PC3 cells (unpublished observations). Of course, a glycan, protein or lipid substrate may be present in only very low quantities or not expressed in CHO cells. Thus it cannot be ruled out that GnT1IP-L has an activity other than its ability to specifically inhibit MGAT1. Importantly however, another example of a gene that has homology to, and the protein domain structure of a glycosyltransferase, but an activity that is distinct, is C1GALT1C1, originally called COSMC (<a href=\"#bib19\">Ju and Cummings, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Wang et al., 2010</a>). This protein is a specific chaperone dedicated to the Gal-transferase C1GALT1, and essential for its activity (<a href=\"#bib36\">Wang et al., 2010</a>). Thus, although GnT1IP-L (or MGAT4D) has homology to family 54 glycosyltransferases, the only activity yet identified for membrane-bound GnT1IP is as a specific inhibitor of MGAT1."

Most interestingly, the gene encoding MGAT1 is expressed in a complementary manner to GnT1IP-L in male germ cells (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a> and [<a href=\"#bib8\">Chalmel et al., 2007</a>]). We are currently investigating the hypothesis that membrane-bound GnT1IP functions to down-regulate MGAT1 activity in spermatocytes and potentially spermatids, thereby enhancing their ability to bind to Sertoli cells. It is therefore of interest that men with impaired spermatogenesis exhibit greatly reduced expression of GnT1IP in microarray studies of testis biopsies (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>). The degree of reduction appears to reflect the proportion of the remaining population of germ cells. Interestingly, MGAT1 transcripts were not reduced but were slightly increased reflecting robust expression of <i>MGAT1</i> in Sertoli cells (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chalmel et al., 2007</a>). Germ cell expression of MGAT1 is however, essential for spermatogenesis in mice since conditional deletion of the <i>Mgat1</i> gene in spermatogonia blocks spermatogenesis and results in infertile males (<a href=\"#bib2\">Batista et al., 2012</a>). Ongoing studies with conditional knockout mice, and mice overexpressing GnT1IP-L or MGAT1 in specific germ cell populations, should reveal roles for GnT1IP-L and MGAT1 in spermatogenesis."

Previous research form the Stanley lab demonstrated that overexpression of GnT1P-L does not increase transfer of GlcNAc to N-glycans, but instead reduces MGAT1 activity. The current manuscript follows up on these earlier findings by testing whether GnT1P-L can inhibit other MGATs. The authors use FRET and BiFC experiments to characterize the homomeric and heteromeric interactions of GnT1P-L and MGAT1. Importantly, GnT1P-L does not inhibit MGAT2-MGAT5, and does not interact with these other GlcNAc-transferases. Heteromeric interactions between GnT1P-L and MGAT1 occur in the Golgi and are dependent upon the slightly acidic environment of the Golgi lumen. Analysis of MGAT1 and GnT11P-L expression in spermatocyte progenitor cells point to an important role for GnT1P-L during spermatogenesis."

This link from transcript levels to the glycan structures in the respective cell types needs to be more clearly presented so that it is clear what the take home message is for the gene expression data. Observations are made that GnT1IP-L expression is elevated in postmeiotic germ cells consistent with data in Figure 11 on human testis biopsies from men with impaired spermatogenesis.

For GNT1IP-L-CD1, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a> of Huang et al. showed that the C-terminal deletion mutant is mainly retained in the ER, so formation of GNT1IP-L-CD1-MGAT1 heteromers should be reduced based upon the results presented in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a> of the current manuscript. Unless I have overlooked something, interaction between a C-terminal GNT1IP deletion mutant and MGAT1 has only been tested in the context of the short form (GNT1IP-S-CD2 in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). Since the short form (GNT1IP-S) is not a MGAT1 inhibitor, one has to be concerned that ER retention of the truncation mutant is a contributing factor in lack of inhibitory activity. Since the current manuscript does not use BiFC or FRET to characterize formation of heteromers between MGAT1 and these inactive GNT1IP-L mutants, it seems premature to conclude that specific sub-regions of the lumenal domain are required for GNT1IP-L inhibitory activity."

This link from transcript levels to the glycan structures in the respective cell types needs to be more clearly presented so that it is clear what the take home message is for the gene expression data. Observations are made that GnT1IP-L expression is elevated in postmeiotic germ cells consistent with data in Figure 11 on human testis biopsies from men with impaired spermatogenesis. The authors hypothesize that blockage in glycan maturation is critical for germ cell interaction with Sertoli cells</i>."

Materials and methods now includes two sections: \u201cAnalysis of mouse RNA sequencing data\u201d and \u201cAnalysis of human microarray data\u201d, in which we describe in detail how datasets were downloaded, which Reads/Probesets were extracted, and how they were visualized with respect to germ cell subtypes and testicular phenotypes. The legends have been updated so that the legend title now contains data origin (RNA-Seq or Microarray). The x-axis of the histogram now has the correct label \u201clog2 FPKM\u201d (thanks for alerting us). Also FPKM is now defined in the legend to the new <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a> as well as in the Materials and methods section."

For GNT1IP-L-CD1,</i> <a href=\"#fig4\"><i>Figure 4C</i></a> <i>of Huang et al. showed that the C-terminal deletion mutant is mainly retained in the ER, so formation of GNT1IP-L-CD1-MGAT1 heteromers should be reduced based upon the results presented in</i> <a href=\"#fig7\"><i>Figure 7</i></a> <i>of the current manuscript. Unless I have overlooked something, interaction between a C-terminal GNT1IP deletion mutant and MGAT1 has only been tested in the context of the short form (GNT1IP-S-CD2 in</i> <a href=\"#fig5\"><i>Figure 5</i></a><i>). Since the short form (GNT1IP-S) is not a MGAT1 inhibitor, one has to be concerned that ER retention of the truncation mutant is a contributing factor in lack of inhibitory activity. Since the current manuscript does not use BiFC or FRET to characterize formation of heteromers between MGAT1 and these inactive GNT1IP-L mutants, it seems premature to conclude that specific sub-regions of the lumenal domain are required for GNT1IP-L inhibitory activity</i>."

                    "text": "We have added a description of the similarities and differences between GnT1IP-S and \u2013L to the Introduction and elsewhere. Our previous paper showed that adding an N-terminal tag (Myc or HA) to GnT1IP-S converts it to a membrane-bound form that inhibits MGAT1 in transfected cells, indistinguishable from GnT1IP-L. The sequence of GnT1IP-L from aa 45 to 417 is identical to GnT1IP-S and differs only in that it has a 44 aa N-terminal extension. Some mutant constructs were made with Tag-GnT1IP-S which inhibits MGAT1 (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>, <a href=\"#bib16\">Huang and Stanley, 2010</a>), and mislocalizes co-expressed MGAT1 to the ER more severely than Myc-GnT1IP-S-CD1 (C-terminal 39 aa deletion) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a> in <a href=\"#bib16\">Huang and Stanley, 2010</a>). Tag-GnT1IP-S-CD1 does not induce resistance to L-PHA (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>), nor inhibit MGAT1 activity. Thus, it is appropriate to say that loss of the 39 C-terminal amino acids inactivates inhibition of MGAT1 by membrane-bound GnT1IP. Co-immunoprecipitation with MGAT1 was observed with a 121 aa C-terminal deletion, which suggests that the 39 aa deletion mutant would also interact with MGAT1. We have modified the revised text."
