Recent crystal structures solved in apo and ATP-bound states revealed molecular motions of the extracellular domain following agonist binding. However, the mechanism of pore opening still remains controversial. Here we use photo-switchable cross-linkers as \u2018molecular tweezers\u2019 to monitor a series of inter-residue distances in the transmembrane domain of the P2X2 receptor during activation. These experimentally based structural constraints combined with computational studies provide high-resolution models of the channel in the open and closed states. We show that the extent of the outer pore expansion is significantly reduced compared to the ATP-bound structure. Our data further reveal that the inner and outer ends of adjacent pore-lining helices come closer during opening, likely through a hinge-bending motion. These results provide new insight into the gating mechanism of P2X receptors and establish a versatile strategy applicable to other membrane proteins."

Recent crystal structures solved in apo and ATP-bound states revealed molecular motions of the extracellular domain following agonist binding. However, the mechanism of pore opening still remains controversial. Here we use photo-switchable cross-linkers as \u2018molecular tweezers\u2019 to monitor a series of inter-residue distances in the transmembrane domain of the P2X2 receptor during activation. These experimentally based structural constraints combined with computational studies provide high-resolution models of the channel in the open and closed states. We show that the extent of the outer pore expansion is significantly reduced compared to the ATP-bound structure. Our data further reveal that the inner and outer ends of adjacent pore-lining helices come closer during opening, likely through a hinge-bending motion. These results provide new insight into the gating mechanism of P2X receptors and establish a versatile strategy applicable to other membrane proteins."

Members of the P2X family of receptors are ion channels that form pores through the membrane. When a molecule of ATP binds to the external region of the receptor, it activates it and causes the receptor to change from a closed to an open shape. Once opened, ions flow through the channel\u2019s pore and trigger a response inside the cell. P2X receptors are found on most animal cells (including nerve cells) and are involved in both normal cellular activity and processes linked to disease, including inflammation and chronic pain."

This allowed the pore to be opened and closed in response to changes in light. Habermacher et al. then studied the behavior of these modified receptors within a natural membrane and found that the light stimulated movements were similar to those seen with ATP. When the behavior of the receptor and light-sensitive linkers was studied using computer simulations, it led to new models of the P2X pore in the open and closed state. In these models, the open channel was more tightly packed than in the previous structure and an unexpected hinge-bending movement was seen to accompany the opening of the channel. It is hoped that this new approach will also be useful for probing how other membrane proteins change their shape when activated."

Once opened, a flow of ions (sodium, potassium and calcium) transit through the transmembrane (TM) pore and initiates signal transduction. Depending on the P2X subtype, gating is followed by desensitization, a temporary inactivation that terminates the ion flow. ATP-gated P2X receptors are also involved in a wide range of pathological disorders, including chronic and inflammatory pain (<a href=\"#bib39\">Khakh and North, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Abbracchio et al., 2009</a>).

There are three interfacial ATP-binding pockets in the extracellular domain (ECD) that protrude ~40\u2009\u00c5 outside of the membrane. The transmembrane domain (TMD) comprises six TM spanning \u03b1-helices, two from each subunit termed TM1 and TM2, which are arranged around the threefold axis of symmetry, with TM1 positioned peripheral to TM2. The pore-lining TM2 helices are steeply angled nearly 45\u00b0 from the membrane plane and they\u00a0form,\u00a0in the apo state, a gate in the middle of the membrane that is thought to control the flux of ions.

As a result, the lower region of the ECD undergoes a flexing motion that pulls apart the outer ends of the six TM helices (<a href=\"#bib24\">Hattori and Gouaux, 2012</a>). This lateral displacement, in turn, enlarges through an iris-like opening the narrowest part of the channel, creating a wide entryway of 7\u2009\u00c5 in diameter, which allows ions to flow through the open pore (<a href=\"#bib24\">Hattori and Gouaux, 2012</a>)."

However, there are areas of discordance between the X-ray structures and the available data at the level of the TM pore. Although the location of the gate (<a href=\"#bib58\">Samways et al., 2014</a>), the relative position and gating motion of TM1 and TM2 within the individual subunits (<a href=\"#bib44\">Li et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Heymann et al., 2013</a>) and the movement of the outer ends of the TM helices (<a href=\"#bib44\">Li et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Kracun et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Heymann et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Browne et al., 2014</a>) inferred from experimental data are in qualitative agreement with the crystal structures, there are reasons to question whether the ATP-bound structure provides an accurate blueprint of a native open-channel pore. First, the proposed mechanism of gating implies a great radial outward movement of the TM helices away from the threefold axis, which creates large \u2018crevices\u2019 between the TM helices of adjacent subunits. As a result, the TMD appears loosely packed. Although endogenous lipids have been suggested to occupy these gaps (<a href=\"#bib24\">Hattori and Gouaux, 2012</a>), recent modeling supported by experimental data has suggested that these crevices are not present in membrane-embedded receptors (<a href=\"#bib26\">Heymann et al., 2013</a>). Second, metal bridging experiments suggest that the inner portion of TM2 helices narrows as the channel opens (<a href=\"#bib41\">Kracun et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Li et al., 2010</a>), a feature that is not visible from the ATP-bound structure (<a href=\"#bib24\">Hattori and Gouaux, 2012</a>). Third, to obtain diffracting crystals, proteins were extensively truncated at both the amino and carboxy termini and solubilized with detergents (<a href=\"#bib24\">Hattori and Gouaux, 2012</a>). Although the truncated receptor was functional, the lack of the intracellular domains, which critically control the function of the receptor (<a href=\"#bib15\">Chaumont et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Allsopp and Evans, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Robinson and Murrell-Lagnado, 2013</a>), may distort somewhat the structure of the pore, raising the possibility that the X-ray structure may represent a non-native, open-channel state. Hence, additional data are needed to understand the gating mechanism of a full-length, membrane-embedded P2X receptor."

We chose residues from the extracellular apex of the TM helices for which the interatomic distances of the C\u03b2-atoms of at least one of the X-ray structures closely matched the end-to-end distance of MAM (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>). Furthermore, to limit all possible combinations, only single cysteine mutations per subunit were designed, and, therefore, only one MAM photo-linker is expected to cross-link two adjacent subunits within a receptor. As pairwise positions are considered, horizontal cross-linking relative to the membrane plane is expected. With these criteria, we identified 10 residues in TM1 and TM2 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>) and substituted each of them with a cysteine into the P2X2-3T background, a functional receptor in which the three native cysteines were mutated to threonine (<a href=\"#bib44\">Li et al., 2008</a>), and expressed the single mutants in HEK cells.

In these conditions, MAS is expected to react with a single cysteine without cross-linking. Control experiments with MAS revealed that the majority of the light-gated currents were indistinguishable from those originating from MAM treatment (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C, D</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>), suggesting that in these experiments MAM actually does not cross-link adjacent subunits. However, for three mutants (Y47C, D57C, and I328C) there was clear evidence for MAM cross-linking. For the D57C mutant, there was no light-gated current following MAS treatment, whereas the response of the Y47C and I328C mutants to MAM exhibited clear differences relative to MAS in current amplitudes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>), on-rate kinetics and stability in the dark (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3A\u2013D</a>). Moreover, biochemical experiments clearly showed that the I328C-mutated protein, and not P2X2-3T, migrated on sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS\u2013PAGE) at the position expected for dimeric cross-linked subunits only after MAM treatment (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). Similar results were also obtained for the Y47C and D57C mutants (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>), although the extent of cross-linking was lower than that of I328C. The reason for the relatively low extent of cross-linking is unclear, but the currents elicited by light were also consistently small for these mutants compared to the I328C mutant, suggesting that the kinetics of cross-linking are not complete. Alternatively, a fraction of the cell-surface mutant receptors might not be reactive to MAM fusion (possibly due to protein misfolding), thus decreasing the cross-linking efficiency. Finally, we cannot rule out the possibility that the dimer band transfers less efficiently in Western blotting. Overall, because the Y47, D57, and I328 residues are located at the outer ends of the TMD, these cross-linking data provide direct evidence that a lateral outward motion of both TM1 and TM2 is involved in channel gating."

                                "text": "To evaluate the physiological relevance of the light-driven motions, we determined key biophysical features of the light-gated channels and compared them to those of channels activated by ATP. We focused on the I328C mutant because it gave the most robust currents. First, we found that the rate of activation by light (time constant \u03c4 = 131 \u00b1 9 ms, n = 8, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) closely resembled that induced by a saturating concentration of ATP for the wild-type (WT) P2X2 receptor (300 \u03bcM; \u03c4 = 128 \u00b1 11 ms, n = 4) (<a href=\"#bib65\">Trujillo et al., 2006</a>). This result suggests that light and ATP open the channel with similar kinetics, although light source intensity and conditions of ATP application were not optimal. Second, increasing time treatment with MAM from 5 to 40 min increased the relative amount of light-gated currents relative to maximal ATP-gated currents from 20 \u00b1 7 to 60 \u00b1 5% (n = 7\u20139), demonstrating that light promotes gating motions that are nearly as efficient as those induced by ATP (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A-C</a>). Third, light-gated currents rapidly inactivated in the dark, and currents were recovered from inactivation by switching back to the <i>cis</i>-isomer (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), two processes that are reminiscent of P2X desensitization and resensitization, respectively. Fourth, channels opened by light at 525 nm increased by twofold the maximal ATP response without changing ATP sensitivity relative to control. Given that ATP is a partial agonist on the rP2X2 receptor (<a href=\"#bib17\">Ding and Sachs, 1999</a>), this suggests that MAM-induced motions are functionally linked to ATP function (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1D, E</a> and <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 2</a>). Fifth, we found that light-gated channels remained selective to cations (<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1</a>) and showed calcium permeability that was somewhat lower (by 1.6-fold) than that of the ATP-gated P2X2-3T (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a> and <a href=\"#SD4-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 2</a>) (<a href=\"#bib42\">Lemoine et al., 2013</a>). In addition, as P2X2 receptors are known to undergo \u2018pore dilation\u2019 during prolonged ATP application (<a href=\"#bib38\">Khakh et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Virginio et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Rokic and Stojilkovic, 2013</a>), which is defined by a progressive increase in permeability to large organic cations such as <i>N</i>-methyl-d-glucamine (NMDG), we tested the ability of NMDG to permeate light-gated channels. No NMDG current was detected after 525 nm light switching (<a href=\"#SD5-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 3</a>), suggesting that the open state reached by MAM fused horizontally between two I328C mutant subunits in the <i>trans</i> configuration is not trapped in a dilated, open-channel state (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Last, to determine the unitary conductance of the light-gated receptors, we carried out single-channel recordings in\u00a0the outside-out configuration (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Control experiments showed that the main conductance state (O) of channels opened by ATP in patches excised from cells expressing the P2X2-3T channel was somewhat higher than that previously determined for the WT P2X2 receptor (<a href=\"#bib30\">Jiang et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Rothwell et al., 2014</a>). This increased ATP unitary current enabled us to detect an additional low-conductance substate (S), a feature that has already been reported to occur occasionally for the WT P2X2 receptor (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a> and <a href=\"#SD6-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 4</a>) (<a href=\"#bib17\">Ding and Sachs, 1999</a>). In agreement with the macroscopic recordings, illumination at 525 nm of patches excised from MAM-treated cells expressing the I328C mutant induced a peak current that rapidly declined to a steady-state level of activity, where individual openings and closings can be detected (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Compared to the P2X2-3T receptor, currents opened and closed much more frequently and were highly flickery. Due to this flickery behavior, accurate determination of the open and shut times could not be made. This finding is in agreement with a recent report showing that unitary currents of the I328C channels were also flickery and that receptors exhibit a degree of activity in the absence of\u00a0exogenously applied ATP (<a href=\"#bib57\">Rothwell et al., 2014</a>). However, analysis of the all-points histograms showed that channels appeared to open to multiple conducting levels, as observed for the ATP-gated P2X2-3T receptor. These conductance states (full (O) and low-conductance substates (S)) were comparable, albeit lower (~35%) than those of the P2X2-3T receptor (<a href=\"#SD6-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 4</a>), suggesting that the open states reached by MAM under light illumination are not fundamentally dissimilar to those naturally populated by ATP."

We paired the mutation I328C located at the extracellular apex of one TM2 with other cysteine substitutions located at the intracellular side of another TM2 (from V343 to W350; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>), thus designing double-cysteine mutants. To distinguish vertical MAM cross-linking from either horizontal cross-linking or MAM reactions involving only one I328C residue (i.e. such as with MAS), light-gated currents were systematically compared with those originating from the I328C mutant alone. All single and double mutants gave robust ATP currents, except for I328C/D349C, which was not functional and D349C, which gave unstable currents (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 2</a>). These latter two mutants were not further analyzed. Following MAM treatment, none of the single internal pore mutants responded to light (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). In contrast, all the functional double mutants were light sensitive, although for most of them activation at 525 nm was very similar to that of the I328C mutant, suggesting that cross-linking occurs horizontally between two adjacent I328C-mutant subunits (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>)."

First, light-gated motions were nearly as effective as those induced by ATP, as evidenced by the fact that light activated channels at 60 \u00b1 7% (n = 13 cells, preincubation time of 20 min) of the maximal whole-cell ATP response. This value was higher than that obtained from I328C measured at the same preincubation time (31 \u00b1 4%), suggesting that rates of vertical cross-linking between I328C and S345C are higher than those observed horizontally involving two I328C-mutated subunits. Furthermore, in contrast to the single I328C mutant, light-gated currents were stable in the dark for I328C/S345C double mutant, suggesting that these light-driven motions did not induce apparent desensitization of the receptor (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). Second, engineered I328C/S345C channels opened by <i>cis</i>-MAM were still largely selective for sodium over chloride ions (<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1</a>), and displayed calcium permeability that was higher than that of the I328C mutant, but slightly lower than that of the P2X2-3T receptor (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2B</a> and <a href=\"#SD4-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 2</a>). Third, a small but substantial NMDG permeability (around 15%) was recorded (<a href=\"#SD5-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 3</a>), which suggests that <i>cis</i>-MAM traps a partially dilated state, revealing that the MAM photo-linker has the ability to trap different ion permeability states. Last, in outside-out patches, channels opened stepwise after 365 nm illumination to discrete levels of conductance with no apparent decline of activity, in agreement with macroscopic recordings (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). Unitary currents of the highest conducting level (O<sub>1</sub> in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>) were higher than those of the I328C mutant cross-linked horizontally by MAM and resembled those of the P2X2-3T receptor activated by ATP, although the probability of occurrence was extremely low (<a href=\"#SD6-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 4</a>). Two additional low-conductance substates (S<sub>1</sub> and S<sub>2</sub>) were also detected in relatively abundant amounts that may correspond to a mixture of cross-linked species (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). Because currents were also highly flickery, they were not analyzed further. Overall, these data indicate that shortening the distance between the inner and outer ends of adjacent TM2 helices drives channel opening, a motion that was not anticipated by X-ray structures."

There are potential caveats concerning the use of concatemers (<a href=\"#bib62\">Stelmashenko et al., 2012</a>), but we provide evidence that currents recorded after expression of the different constructs result from channels formed by the intact concatenated proteins. All tested concatemers responded robustly to ATP, and no apparent protein breakdown was detected by SDS\u2013PAGE (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3B and 3D</a>). Concatemers that allow MAM cross-linking at one of the three interfaces (denoted OO/CO/OC or OC/OO/CO, where C and O stands for cysteine mutation and WT residue, respectively) or within one subunit (intra helix cross-linking; OO/OO/CC) showed no light-gated currents (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3A\u2013C</a>). However, a gradual increase of the ratio of the currents elicited by UV light to those gated by ATP was observed for concatemers that allow MAM cross-linking at two and three interfaces assuming a clockwise orientation of the subunits (OC/CO/CC and CC/CC/CC, <a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3A\u2013C</a>), demonstrating that two MAM linkers are sufficient to gate the channel (the alternative counterclockwise orientation was inconsistent with the data). No or negligible light-gated currents were recorded in cells expressing concatemers harboring cysteine mutations in other combinations, as would be expected if there were alternative patterns of cross-linking (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3A\u2013C</a>)."

In sharp contrast, the MD relaxation of the open state with fused MAM produced a significant contraction of the TMD, as compared to the X-ray structure of the ATP-bound state with the anchor points distances shortening from 27.7 to 24.7\u2009\u00c5 upon horizontal cross-linking (C\u03b2 of I336C) and from 23.2 to 17.2\u2009\u00c5 upon vertical cross-linking (C\u03b2 of I336C and N353C); see <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a> and <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>. Consistent with a recent modeling study (<a href=\"#bib26\">Heymann et al., 2013</a>), this structural rearrangement results in the disappearance of the large crevices observed in the X-ray structure of the open state (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). In addition, the cross-linking simulations of the open state produce a more compact structure of the inner TMD, with an open channel stabilized by a new interface between the pore-lining TM2 helices (note that for the simulations of the open state, the TM1-TM2 interface was stabilized by incorporating structural information obtained from recent intra-subunit Cd<sup>2+</sup> bridging essays [<a href=\"#bib26\">Heymann et al., 2013</a>]). This new interface involves the side chain of L351 (rP2X2: V343) on one subunit and G343 (A335) and/or that of A347 (T339) on the adjacent subunit. The restructuring of the TMD in simulation is driven by a significant conformational change of the upper region of the TM2 helices, which straighten, pack closer together around the region of L351 and lock the ion channel in an open-pore conformation (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The immediate structural consequences are: (1) an upward shift of the constriction point, which moves from L351 or W358 (upon reconstruction of the unresolved side chains in 4DW1) to A347 and (2) a significant kinking of the TM2 helices at residues V354-I355. Most importantly, the structural reorganization of the TMD occurs while keeping the ion pore open (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). In this respect, it is important to stress that in all simulations of the open state carried out in the absence of MAM, the ion pore systematically shut under the effect of thermal fluctuations (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>; see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019)."

The comparison of the distributions of fused <i>versus</i> free MAM (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>) makes it clear that: (1) cross-linking reduces the configurational freedom of the photo-switcher quite significantly; (2) the end-to-end distance distributions of fused MAM overlap significantly with those of free MAM; (3) there is a significant shift of the <i>cis versus trans</i> distributions when the photo-linker is bound. Overall, these observations indicate that our cross-linking experiments provide evidence of a well-defined structural change of the TM2 helices during activation. Additionally, the comparison of the end-to-end distributions of free MAM and fused MAM indicates that cross-linking is \u2018soft\u2019, such that the structural stability of the open-channel state must be an intrinsic property of the protein; that is, it is not a rare open state stabilized by MAM-cross-linking, but rather the native active state which has been elicited by photoswitching."

                        "text": "There are at least three major issues that may arise from the photo-switchable tweezers strategy. The first one is related to the flexibility of the photo-linker (<a href=\"#bib7\">Beharry and Woolley, 2011</a>), as we showed that free MAM in solution is not completely rigid, in particular the <i>cis</i> isomer, whose end-to-end distance distribution spans from 4 to 22\u2009\u00c5. However, when cross-linked to the TMD of the receptor, we provide evidence that the end-to-end distance distribution shrinks considerably due to the steric constraints imposed by the surrounding protein and membrane. Thus, cross-linked MAM can be considered as a photo-switchable molecular ruler. The second point is the physiological relevance of the light-gated motions. We show here that light-gated channels exhibit biophysical features of the WT receptor activated by ATP, suggesting that the discrete conformational states elicited by light closely resemble those populated by ATP. Most importantly, we found that light-induced motions of the TMD positively modulate ATP function, thus indicating an efficient crosstalk between the ion pore and the distant neurotransmitter-binding sites, a mechanism that is reminiscent of the action of positive allosteric modulators. It remains to be determined, however, whether or not pathways elicited by light that lead to channel opening and closing are similar to those triggered by ATP. The third potential shortcoming is the uncertainties of the extent of \u2018mixed channels\u2019 formed from a heterogeneous population of cross-linked subunits. Although we cannot formerly rule out this possibility, experiments with concatemers rather suggest that mixed channels, if present, occur insignificantly. In particular, the experiments using the OC/CO/CC construct that, in principle, allows cross-linking of either two (vertical) MAM molecules between I328C and S345C or only one (horizontal) MAM molecule between two adjacent I328C subunits, but does not allow both horizontal and vertical cross-linking reactions within the same channel, supports the hypothesis that the currents induced by UV light originate mostly from a homogeneous population bearing two vertical MAM cross-linkers (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). In addition it should be stressed that intrinsic formation of disulfide bridges may restrict the extent of cross-linking, but the formation of such disulfides was rather low in our conditions. Our approach thus offers a simple and unique strategy to probe directly in physiological conditions the large-scale functional motions of membrane-embedded proteins."

Our data confirm the lateral expansion of the outer ends of the TM helices (<a href=\"#bib44\">Li et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">2010</a>), which was observed in the X-ray structure of the ATP-bound state (<a href=\"#bib24\">Hattori and Gouaux, 2012</a>), and functionally probed recently by the shorter photo-linker 4,4\u00b4-bis(maleimido)azobenzene (BMA) (<a href=\"#bib13\">Browne et al., 2014</a>). However, our findings provide evidence that the simulated end-to-end distance of <i>trans</i>-MAM when cross-linked horizontally (~25\u2009\u00c5) is substantially shorter than the distance separating the \u03b2-carbons of two adjacent I328 residues in the X-ray structure of the ATP-bound state (~28\u2009\u00c5). The same holds true for the vertical distance probed by <i>cis</i>-MAM between the \u03b2-carbons of I328 and S345 from adjacent subunits, which appears as overstretched in the X-ray structure of the open channel. Importantly, no light-gated currents were recorded at P329C, a mutant for which the distance separating the \u03b2-carbons of two adjacent P329 in the X-ray structure of the ATP-bound state (~23\u2009\u00c5) was expected to match the end-to-end distance of <i>trans</i>-MAM, while the shorter photo-linker BMA was recently shown to optically control the channel activity of this mutant (<a href=\"#bib13\">Browne et al., 2014</a>). Incorporating all these structural restraints in the new model of the active state provides compelling evidence that the extent of the outward expansion is reduced by ~3\u2009\u00c5 relative to the ATP-bound X-ray structure (<a href=\"#bib24\">Hattori and Gouaux, 2012</a>). As a direct consequence, the large inter-subunit crevices visualized by the crystals in the middle of the TMD disappear, and the TMD becomes more tightly packed. The existence of these crevices represents a matter of controversy and recent modeling supported by experimental bridging data has suggested that lipids would be able to cross these gaps and block ion conduction in the bound ATP state (<a href=\"#bib26\">Heymann et al., 2013</a>). Our data provide evidence that these crevices are likely artifacts of crystal environment, although we do not rule out the possibility that lipid binding to these interfaces may modulate receptor activity (<a href=\"#bib57\">Rothwell et al., 2014</a>)."

This conclusion is supported by the relaxation of the ATP-bound state of zfP2X4 by explicit water/membrane MD with fused MAM, which produced a significant reorganization of the TMD with an open pore stabilized by a new TM2-TM2 interface formed by L351 (V343 in rP2X2) of one subunit and G343 and A347 (A335 and T339 in rP2X2, respectively) of another. The simulations suggest that the new interface is produced by a conformational change of the extracellular end of the pore-lining helices TM2, which straighten relative to the X-ray structure, pack closer together around the region of L351 and lock the channel in a stable, open-pore state. The immediate structural consequences are: i) an upward shift of the constriction point to A347 that is equivalent to T339 in rP2X2, a residue shown to be critically involved in channel gating (<a href=\"#bib14\">Cao et al., 2007</a>), and, ii) a significant kinking of the TM2 helices at residues V354-I355. Consistent with this\u00a0observation, we found that mutating the nearby residue G350 (G342 in rP2X2) into proline, which is expected to promote \u03b1-helical bending, dramatically increases the ATP sensitivity in rP2X2. Residue G342 is highly conserved in the P2X family and was shown to be critically involved in ion pore dilation (<a href=\"#bib38\">Khakh et al., 1999</a>). A recent work has reported that a missense mutation at this position in the human P2X2 receptor is associated with hereditary hearing loss, suggesting a vital role for this particular conserved glycine residue (<a href=\"#bib20\">Faletra et al., 2014</a>). Additionally, G342 is located in proximity to G344, another critical residue for gating (<a href=\"#bib22\">Fujiwara et al., 2009</a>). Our data thus demonstrate that during activation the TM2 helices bend through a critical \u2018gating hinge\u2019, a mechanism that is reminiscent of the conformational change involved in K<sup>+</sup> channels gating (<a href=\"#bib16\">del Camino and Yellen, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Jiang et al., 2002</a>)."

A closer comparison with the model of <a href=\"#bib26\">Heymann et al. (2013)</a> shows, however, significant changes in the tertiary structure of the TM2 helices as well as the quaternary organization of the TMD. In our open-state model, the upper region of the TM2 helices is straight and the open-pore conformation is stabilized by the new TM2-TM2 interface. These structural features are different to those of the model of Heymann et al., which displays no tertiary change of the helices compared to the ATP-bound X-ray structure and shows a distinct TM2/TM2 interface that is located below the characteristic kink at residue G350, although some of these interfacial residues (L351 and A347) are common with those of the present model. In addition, the new model of the open state appears to be inconsistent with the Cd<sup>2+</sup> bridging experiment at position 343 in rP2X2 (L351 in zfP2X4) (<a href=\"#bib45\">Li et al., 2010</a>). In fact, the distances between the C\u03b2 atoms of the L351 residues, which correspond to Cd<sup>2+</sup> coordinating residues (V343C) in rP2X2 (<a href=\"#bib45\">Li et al., 2010</a>), are too far apart (11.6\u2009\u00c5) to make a successful metal-coordination site in our model of the open state, even in alternative rotameric states where the C\u03b3 atoms of L351 lie approximately 9\u2009\u00c5 apart (full coordination occurs when this distance falls to approximately 6\u2009\u00c5). This said, the side chains of L351 are facing the ion pore lumen in proximity to one another, and it could well be that, when mutated into cysteines, they form an inter-subunit Cd<sup>2+</sup> coordination site through a major rearrangement of the TM2 helices, perhaps driven by electrostatic interactions with the metal ion. Even though the experimental data support the hypothesis that Cd<sup>2+</sup> binding occurs in the open state of the receptor (<a href=\"#bib45\">Li et al., 2010</a>), this constraint was not included in our model because it would cause sufficient narrowing of the internal pore that would be incompatible with an open-conducting state. Whether or not the disagreement between our new model of the open state and the inter-subunit Cd<sup>2+</sup> binding site would be sufficient to disprove its structural details is questionable and further (crosslinking) experiments are required."

The protein trimers were then embedded in a pre-equilibrated 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-<i>sn</i>-phosphatidylcholine (POPC) bilayer and fully solvated (including the open pore) with modified TIP3P (<a href=\"#bib19\">Durell et al., 1994</a>) water molecules using VMD (<a href=\"#bib28\">Humphrey et al., 1996</a>). The net charge of the system was neutralized by adding a 150 mM equivalent of sodium and chloride ions. The resulting all-atom constructs (~138000 atoms each) were modeled using the CHARMM force-field version 36 (<a href=\"#bib9\">Best et al., 2012</a>) with MAM parameters obtained from the CHARMM general force-field (<a href=\"#bib66\">Vanommeslaeghe et al., 2010</a>)."

Harmonic restraints were set on the positions of the phosphorus and adenosine heavy atoms (1 kcal/mol/\u00c5<sup>2</sup>) of the ATP agonists and of the C\u03b1 and C\u03b2 atoms (1.0 and 0.5 kcal/mol/\u00c5<sup>2</sup>, respectively) of the protein except for the TM2 helices, the cross-linked Cys residues, and the added terminal residues. Following a short thermalization (600 ps), a 2-ns MD relaxation was performed in the NPT ensemble at 310\u2009K and 1 atm with vanishing positional restraints. Because in the absence of MAM the open-state conformation captured in the crystal was unstable in simulation, that is, spontaneous shut of the ion pore within a few (&lt;5) nanoseconds of equilibration independently of the initial setups (i.e. equilibration procedure, protonation state of residues, membrane composition, etc.), for the simulations of the open state, the TM1-TM2 interface was stabilized by incorporating structural information obtained from recent intra-subunit Cd<sup>2+</sup> bridging essays (<a href=\"#bib26\">Heymann et al., 2013</a>). Specifically, the trigonal-planar Cd<sup>2+</sup> coordination between the side chains of N35 (C\u03b3), N353C (S\u03b3), and C356 (S\u03b3) was mimicked by introducing harmonic distance restraints (reference distance 4.2\u2009\u00c5, force constant 1 kcal/mol/\u00c5<sup>2</sup>). Structural information related to the inter-subunit Cd<sup>2+</sup> coordination site of<a href=\"#bib45\">Li et al., (2010)</a>, which involves the side chains of L351 (rP2X2: V343), was not included in the modeling."

Six independent 50 ns-long unrestrained MD simulations of the free MAM molecule in solution (~10,000 atoms) were performed using ACEMD (<a href=\"#bib23\">Harvey et al., 2009</a>) in the NVT ensemble at 310\u2009K for the <i>cis</i> and <i>trans</i> configurations and for the R/R, S/R, and S/S stereoisomers. Trajectories were analyzed using VMD and Wordom (<a href=\"#bib59\">Seeber et al., 2007</a>), and molecular snapshots were rendered using PyMOL (Schr\u00f6dinger, LLC). Profiles of the TM pore radius along the axis were calculated using the program HOLE (<a href=\"#bib60\">Smart et al., 1996</a>) for backbone atoms only to emphasize global TM2 displacements. The mean distances between the S\u2013S atoms (free MAM) obtained along the MD simulations were computed by averaging over the R/R and S/S stereoisomers (25,000 snapshots each) and twice the R/S (resp. S/R) stereoisomer (2 \u00d7 25,000 snapshots) for a total of n = 100000 for both the <i>cis</i> and <i>trans</i> configurations. The mean distances between the C\u03b2\u2013C\u03b2 of the cross-linked Cys residues were obtained for all four stereoisomers per MAM over the 200 snapshots saved along the 2 ns-long MD simulation, that is, n = 800 or 2400 for one or three MAM molecule(s), respectively. The normalized probability distributions of the S\u2013S or C\u03b2\u2013C\u03b2 distances were obtained by clustering all distance values using a bin width of 0.2\u2009\u00c5. For the free MAM simulations, the peak probability was then selected as the mean of the distribution, and the standard deviation was obtained after performing a least-square fit with a normal distribution over the full dataset of probabilities using a modified Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (<a href=\"#bib37\">Kelley, 1999</a>). For the simulations with MAM fused to the protein, both the mean and the standard deviation were obtained from the gaussian least-square fit."

However, there are areas of discordance between the X-ray structures and the available data at the level of the transmembrane pore. Although the location of the gate (Samways et al., 2014), the relative position and gating motion of TM1 and TM2 within the individual subunits (Li et al., 2008; Heymann et al., 2013) and the movement of the outer ends of the TM helices (Li et al., 2008; Kracun et al., 2010; Li et al., 2010; Heymann et al., 2013; Browne et al., 2014) inferred from experimental data are in qualitative agreement with the crystal structures, there are reasons to question whether the ATP-bound structure provides an accurate blueprint of a native open-channel pore\u2019."

As the atomic coordinates for the model (of Heymann et al., 2013) are not publicly available, a detailed comparison with our model of the open state is difficult and can be done only qualitatively. Both models consistently show a significant shrinking of the subunits interface in the TMD, which results in the disappearance of the large crevices observed in the X-ray structure of the ATP-bound state (Hattori &amp; Gouaux, 2012). However, significant differences between them are apparent both at the level of the tertiary structure of the TM2 helices and the quaternary organization of the TMD. In our open-state model, the upper part of the TM2 helices straightens and stabilizes the open channel by producing a new TM2/TM2 interface that involves the side chain of L351 from one subunit and G343 and A347 from another. These structural features are different from those of the model of Heymann et al., which based on their <b>Figure 8A</b> displays no tertiary change of the TM2 helices compared to the X-ray structure and a distinct TM2/TM2 interface, located well below the characteristic kink (residue G350). Importantly, our model of the open state was shown to preserve an open-channel conformation in fully unrestrained MD simulations of dozens of ns, unlike the X-ray structure of the ATP-bound state, which shuts under the effect of thermal fluctuation in a few nanoseconds independently of the initial setup (subsection \u201cMolecular modelling\u201d). Because our model of the open state incorporates distance restraints at the TM1-TM2 interface corresponding to the Cd<sup>2+</sup> binding experiments of Heymann et al., it is consistent with these metal bridges by construction."

In our case, we cannot formerly rule out this possibility, however, experiments using concatemers suggest that mixed channels, if present, occur insignificantly. In particular, the experiment using the OC/CO/CC construct that, in principle, allows cross-linking of either two (vertical) MAM molecules between I328C and S345C or only one (horizontal) MAM molecule between two adjacent I328C subunits, but does not allow both horizontal and vertical cross-linking reactions within the same channel, supports the hypothesis that the currents induced by UV light originate mostly from a homogeneous population bearing two vertical MAM cross-linkers (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3-figure supplement 3</a>). We are aware of the potential caveats that may arise from the use of concatemers (see Stelmashenko et al., 2012), however, we present evidence that currents recorded after expression of the different constructs results from channels formed by the intact concatenated proteins (no evidence of protein breakdown as detected by SDS PAGE and all tested concatemers responded robustly to ATP). Concerning the intrinsic formation of disulfide bridges, they can effectively affect the cross-linking efficiency of MAM, but the extent of disulfide formation was rather low in our conditions. All these points are now discussed in the third paragraph of the Discussion to help the reader appreciating the potential shortcomings of the photo-switchable tweezers method."
