These cells signal the animal\u2019s position or direction relative to the external world; that is, they represent space allocentrically, similar to a \u2018you are here\u2019 mark on a geographic map. The allocentric property has implicated these cells as the neural substrate of a \u2018cognitive map\u2019 of the environment (<a href=\"#bib69\">O'Keefe and Nadel, 1978</a>; but see <a href=\"#bib7\">Bennett, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Filimon, 2015</a>).

Different studies often disagree on their relative influence (<a href=\"#bib42\">Knierim and Hamilton, 2011</a>). Furthermore, the firing correlates of the two most extensively investigated cells (HD cells and place cells) can complicate the interpretation of these studies. HD cells provide an orientation/direction signal, but they do not provide a position signal, limiting experimental investigations to rotational manipulations and limiting the analysis to the directional frame. Place cells usually produce a single place field in a standard laboratory experiment, and therefore rotations and translations of the internal map can only be discerned unequivocally from the collective response of a population of them. But place cells can remap independently of each other (<a href=\"#bib12\">Bostock et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Colgin et al., 2008</a>), can turn on and off in a familiar environment or in response to cue manipulations (<a href=\"#bib76\">Shapiro et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Monaco et al., 2014</a>), and can be modulated by nonspatial aspects of the animal\u2019s experience (<a href=\"#bib91\">Wood et al., 1999</a>, <a href=\"#bib92\">2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Frank et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Moita et al., 2003</a>). In contrast, a grid cell fires in space according to a periodic, triangular pattern that simultaneously reveals its positional (by its phase) and directional (by its orientation) anchoring to the external world. Unlike place cells, grid cells do not undergo \u2018global remapping\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib54\">Leutgeb et al., 2004</a>), but instead they are active and have similar spatial correlates in all environments (<a href=\"#bib36\">Hafting et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Fyhn et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Marozzi et al., 2015</a>). Grid cells are thus ideal candidates to elucidate the allocentric nature of the internal map and its neural basis."

Studies to date have mostly concentrated on the role of the proximal navigation boundaries and their geometric configuration in the anchoring (<a href=\"#bib75\">Savelli et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Solstad et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Stensola et al., 2012</a>, <a href=\"#bib83\">2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Krupic et al., 2015</a>), shaping (<a href=\"#bib4\">Barry et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Stensola et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Krupic et al., 2015</a>), compartmentalization (<a href=\"#bib24\">Derdikman et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Carpenter et al., 2015</a>), and metrical correction (<a href=\"#bib38\">Hardcastle et al., 2015</a>) of the grid pattern. Current theoretical proposals consequently reflect the prevailing experimental focus on these environmental features. For example, it has been suggested that grid cells are primarily concerned with representing geometric information about the local enclosure (<a href=\"#bib50\">Krupic et al., 2016</a>), and emphasis has been placed on the role played by boundaries in stabilizing or differentiating grid maps (<a href=\"#bib33\">Giocomo, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Stensola and Moser, 2016</a>). In contrast, the influence of remote cues remains under-investigated. Although grids were shown to realign or rescale in a context- or novelty-dependent manner after all distal cues were changed (<a href=\"#bib32\">Fyhn et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Barry et al., 2007</a>), the cues were not subject to spatial manipulations in these experiments (but see <a href=\"#bib65\">Neunuebel et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Gupta et al., 2014</a> for experiments with circular tracks and T-mazes). Motivated by the well-known influence of remote inputs on non-metric neural correlates of space (<a href=\"#bib67\">O'Keefe and Conway, 1978</a>; <a href=\"#bib85\">Taube et al., 1990b</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Knierim and Hamilton, 2011</a>), we investigated the relative influence of remote landmarks and local geometric cues on grid cells recorded in an open field."

Visually prominent cues were affixed to the walls of the experimental room (355 \u00d7 280 cm, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>). We translated or rotated a square foraging platform (137 \u00d7 137 cm) between recording sessions, starting from a standard position (STD) in which the platform was parallel to the experimental room (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,C,E</a>). Two types of platforms were used with two separate sets of rats. One had walls (35.6 cm) and replaceable floor paper producing a luminance contrast between the walls and the floor (five rats, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, left). The other had small lips (2.5 cm) around the perimeter and its floor was not replaceable (two rats, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, right). Results from all 308 grid cells recorded over multiple days in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) and/or para-subiculum (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>) of the seven rats are described and included in statistical tests. These analyses provide a rich description of the reproducibility of the grid cell responses over multiple days of experimentation, but they also lead to complications regarding statistical analysis. To ameliorate concerns about the artificial inflation of statistical power by repeated sampling of the same units, the statistical tests were repeated after datasets were algorithmically pruned to minimize the possibility of resampling individual units (\u2018thinned datasets\u2019, see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods for details). These tests are reported if they differed from the full dataset in failing to reach statistical significance at \u03b1\u00a0=\u00a00.05."

To disambiguate these alternatives, we rotated the platform 70\u00b0 CW. If the grids were controlled by the platform itself, we would expect a 70\u00b0 CW rotation with respect to the room, which would be measured as a 10\u00b0 CW rotation due to the 60\u00b0 symmetry of the grid. On the other hand, if the grids preserved the STD alignment relative to the platform's geometric structure, but rotated relative to the physical platform itself, we could observe a 20\u00b0 CCW rotation with respect to the room, which is geometrically congruent to a 70\u00b0 CW rotation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). (A third possible outcome is that the grid remains anchored to the room reference frame, yielding a 0\u00b0 rotation.) In contrast to the uniform response to the ROT20 manipulation, grid rotations in response to the ROT70 manipulation formed a bimodal distribution (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). One of the modes (\u2018left mode\u2019, 50 units from three rats) was located at\u00a0~20\u00b0 CCW (mean 18\u00b0), representing grids that were controlled by the platform\u2018s geometric structure (the \u2018geometric\u2019 reference frame), but rotated relative to the physical platform itself (test of mean angle vs. 10\u00b0 CW, p&lt;0.0001; also significant at p&lt;0.0001 for each rat with n\u00a0&gt;\u00a07). In one of the two rats that accounted for most of the data in this mode, rotations of the grid and the platform geometric frame matched (rat 332, mean rotation 21\u00b0 CCW, test of mean angle vs. 20\u00b0 CCW, p&gt;0.05). In the other rat of the left mode, grids slightly under-rotated (rat 334, mean 16\u00b0 CCW, p&lt;0.0001), similar to ROT20. Also similar to ROT20, very little shift of grid phase was observed for all the grids in this mode (mean 3.6 cm, 5% of grid period, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). The grids in the left mode, therefore, did not follow uncontrolled cues of the platform, but rather treated its orthogonal axes as interchangeable under the influence of the room cues."

By contrast, the other mode in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a> (\u2018right mode\u2019, mean 6\u00b0 CW, 69 units from three rats) reflects grids that kept a stronger relationship with the room\u2019s distal landmarks/walls than with the platform\u2019s geometric boundaries (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). The location of this mode is approximately consistent with the rotation expected of room-controlled grids (grid rotation\u00a0=\u00a00\u00b0, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a> \u2018R\u2019). In some cases, the local boundaries were almost completely ignored, as if the platform were a sampling aperture that unmasked a different region of the grid (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), capturing varying sets of vertices and/or varying fractions of the same firing fields (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). However, the location of the right mode is also consistent with an under-rotation of grids following the full 70\u00b0 CW platform rotation (grid rotation\u00a0=\u00a010\u00b0 CW, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a> \u2018P\u2019). Taking the phase shifts of these grids into account resolves which reference frame dominated (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>, see also further explanation in Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods). The phase shifts necessary to align each STD grid to its corresponding ROT70 grid were much larger when calculated relative to the physical platform compared to the room, both in absolute space and as a proportion of the grid period (phase shift magnitude, 29\u00a0\u00b1\u00a012.9 cm vs. 6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.7 cm, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, W<sub>(69)</sub>\u00a0=\u00a08, p&lt;7.5x10<sup>\u221213</sup>; 34 \u00b1 11% vs. 7 \u00b1 5% proportion of grid period; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>). The phase shifts calculated based on a hypothesis that the grids randomly reoriented to any of the 4 sides of the platform were also larger than phase shifts based on the room-based reference frame (data not shown). These grids therefore strongly dissociated from both the physical platform (by phase shift) and its geometric structure (by rotation), and were instead controlled predominantly by the room reference frame. Grids dissociating from the proximal reference frame were also observed in one rat after 45\u00b0 CW rotations (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). The difference of response expressed by the bimodal distribution of rotations in ROT70 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>) is unlikely to result from the sampling of functionally differentiated neuronal networks (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>)."

The firing patterns expressed by grid and other spatial cells on the platform displayed a striking degree of similarity between STD and SHIFT (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013C</a>), suggesting that they remained anchored to the platform. While the grid phase shift can provide a quantitative indication of the grid displacement in SHIFT, by definition this measure cannot exceed the grid spatial period, which must be taken into account to interpret the shift of each grid. Hence we calculated (1) the observed STD-SHIFT phase shift relative to the platform and (2) the phase shift relative to the platform that is predicted by a room-bound expansion of the STD grid to the region of the room occupied by the platform in the SHIFT condition (see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods). The difference between (1) and (2) represents the phase shift relative to the room reference frame. The room-relative phase shifts were much larger than the platform-based phase shifts, both in absolute space and as a proportion of the grid period (phase shift magnitude, 14\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010.1 vs. 5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.6 cm, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, W<sub>(119)</sub>\u00a0=\u00a0507, p&lt;4.6x10<sup>\u221216</sup>; 18\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011% vs. 7 \u00b1 4% proportion of grid period; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>, see also <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplements 1</a>\u2013<a href=\"#fig5s7\">7</a>), consistent with positional control exerted primarily by the platform.

The correlations in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a> further improved if the rate maps were first realigned according to the detected grid rotation and shift (blue vs. black). Relative to the platform frame of reference, grids generally shifted slightly in the direction opposite to the performed translation, thus \u2018lagging\u2019 behind the platform (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>, examples in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>).

In a given rat, these dissociations and the changes in dominant reference frame tended to be manipulation-specific and reproducible over time.

Grid rotation was plotted as the polar coordinate and day of recording was plotted as the radial coordinate. Grid rotations often clustered by type of manipulation over the course of many days (manipulations are color-coded and rotations cluster by color). To quantify the reproducibility of the grid rotation response over days, mean unit vectors (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>) were calculated for each rat-manipulation coupling comprising\u00a0&gt;6 recording days (not necessarily contiguous), yielding 10 rat-manipulation couplings from five rats (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). A random distribution of angles would result in a mean vector near 0, whereas perfect clustering would result in a mean vector of 1. In all 10 couplings regardless of reference frame, the rotations were significantly non-uniform (Rao test for circular uniformity, all couplings significant at p&lt;0.001) and significantly different from 0\u00b0 (all 10 couplings x three reference frames significant at p&lt;0.05), indicating imperfect control by any single reference frame. The mean vector length in each coupling was very high (&gt;0.92), demonstrating that the responses to each manipulation type were highly consistent over one week or longer."

Perfect control by a reference frame is indicated by a 0\u00b0 angle, whereas positive angles correspond to a CW rotational dissociation from the frame (i.e. the direction of the experimental rotations of the platforms). The\u00a0radial position indicates the number of recording days since the rat\u2019s first experience of a non-STD session (external edge of the\u00a0central gray circle). Dot size is proportional to the scale of the grid measured in STD. Note the general consistency of responses across days and the segregation of response angles by manipulation type (color). These plots ignore the phase component of the grid response, which dramatically reveals additional separation only in some animals/manipulations.

Of the 36 such groups from four rats that met criteria for circular statistical testing (n\u00a0&gt;\u00a07), 31 groups (each comprising 3\u201313 distinct recording days) from all four rats were found to be significantly different from 0\u00b0 (all 31 groups significant at p&lt;0.05; [in the thinned datasets only 6 groups from two rats met the n\u00a0&gt;\u00a07 requirement and were all found significant at p&lt;0.01]), indicating that relative rotations across identified manipulations were generally systematic with respect to all three reference frames. High angular concentration was measured in these groups (mean vector length\u00a0&gt;0.88 in all groups), further indicating that grid reorientations across the same manipulations were precisely reproduced over multiple days."

We considered all the units that were successfully recorded from this rat in ROT70 and at least another non-ROT70 session in a given day, if they passed the gridness test (see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods) in at least one of these sessions. Whereas 19/43 (44%) of the ROT70 sessions passed the gridness test, a larger proportion did so in all other sessions (84/131, 64%, \u03c7<sup>2</sup> test for proportions with Yates correction for continuity: \u03c7<sup>2</sup>(1)=5.3, p&lt;0.021). The selective loss of regular grid structure was apparent from the first day ROT70 was experienced by the rat and continued up to the last day in which grid cell recordings were available for ROT70, 17 days later (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The loss of gridness was not caused by a gradual, within-session drift of an otherwise well-formed grid: correlation of rate maps obtained from the first and second halves of each session were high in ROT70 and not different than the other sessions (median Pearson correlation 0.66, n\u00a0=\u00a043 vs. 0.68, n\u00a0=\u00a0131, Mann-Whitney test, U\u00a0=\u00a02649, p&gt;0.5). The rate maps that passed the gridness test in ROT70 had more elliptical distortion (<a href=\"#bib81\">Stensola et al., 2012</a>) than those passing the gridness test in any other manipulation type for this rat (median elliptical index 1.2, n\u00a0=\u00a019 vs. 1.1, n\u00a0=\u00a093, Mann-Whitney test, U\u00a0=\u00a01352, p&lt;0.0002).

However, in STD2, the grid did not maintain this standard alignment. Instead, the grid reverted to the same alignment relative to the platform boundaries that it had adopted in the ROT70 session.

This realignment was not random; rather, STD2 invariably reproduced the grid-platform alignment that was displayed in a previous, noncontiguous rotation manipulation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a> (i)). This phenomenon was observed every time a STD2 session was performed in this rat, spanning 10 experiment days across which the daily manipulation sequences varied (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). A few observations added to the surprising character of this phenomenon. First, intervening SHIFT sessions were unaffected and continued to approximately replicate the STD, platform-bound alignment (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) as described above for all rats (see <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Second, the STD2 alignment did not carry over to the STD sessions of the next day (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>); rather, the grids reset to their standard alignment at the start of each recording day. Third, some boundary cells did not change their firing patterns between STD and STD2 when the simultaneously recorded grid cells realigned. Instead, these cells continued to fire along the same geometric boundary in both sessions (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a> (ii)), thus dissociating from the grids in these and other sessions (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

In most pairs the two grid cells were anatomically adjacent as they were recorded from the same tetrode, but in many other cases they were recorded on different tetrodes (SR1-3: 119, 48, and all five pairs, respectively). In some of the latter cases the recording sites were ascertained to be in different layers of MEC or in MEC and parasubiculum (46 in SR1 and 9 in SR2 by a highly conservative histological evaluation).

Early place cell studies emphasized the importance of distal cues (<a href=\"#bib67\">O'Keefe and Conway, 1978</a>), but later studies amply documented the importance of local cues (<a href=\"#bib76\">Shapiro et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Knierim, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Knierim and Rao, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Lee et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Renaudineau et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Siegel et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Kelemen and Fenton, 2010</a>), including geometric ones (<a href=\"#bib66\">O'Keefe and Burgess, 1996</a>).

In our experiments differences in the relative dominance of distal and local cues appeared to depend on individual differences between rats and/or the type of apparatus, rather than on the anatomical regions where the grid cells were recorded (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>).

Rats\u2019 ability to take novel shortcuts through previously inaccessible regions led Tolman to hypothesize the \u2018building up in the nervous system\u2019 of such allocentric maps (<a href=\"#bib86\">Tolman, 1948</a>, p. 193). Grid cell-based path planning is theoretically possible (e.g, <a href=\"#bib51\">Kubie and Fenton, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Erdem and Hasselmo, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Bush et al., 2015</a>) and robust to grid distortions such as shearing and boundary-induced perturbations (<a href=\"#bib80\">Stemmler et al., 2015</a>). Planning a path between two familiar regions through territory that was previously blocked off, therefore, could in principle be accomplished via grid cells controlled by a distal reference frame comprising both regions. In this sense, interindividual variability in the shortcut errors (<a href=\"#bib86\">Tolman, 1948</a>, see also <a href=\"#bib34\">Grieves and Dudchenko, 2013</a>) is consistent with our observation that the grid cell map can be, but is not always, controlled by the distal laboratory reference frame, possibly with an associated angular error. In this putative framework, a remotely anchored grid map provides an implicit metric of currently inaccessible regions of the environment, which can later facilitate the pursuit of unanticipated navigation goals and opportunities. This framework differs from the hypothesis that the grid cell system is primarily dedicated to encoding the geometry of local enclosures (<a href=\"#bib49\">Krupic et al., 2015</a>, <a href=\"#bib50\">2016</a>), and its further investigation requires laboratory environments that provide effective remote anchoring options for the animal\u2019s internal map, such as the apparatus we described."

These differences were generally manipulation-specific and consistent over many recording days. Thus, they do not reflect repeated errors of a grid stabilization process that reacts haphazardly to the conflicting cues each time they are experienced. Rather, these repeatable phenomena possibly reflect an underlying discriminating process of the type that is hypothesized to produce different place cell maps and context-dependent memories through global remapping of place cell\u2019s firing locations (<a href=\"#bib64\">Nadel et al., 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Anderson et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Colgin et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib88\">Wang et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Fyhn et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Stensola et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Stensola and Moser, 2016</a>). Previous observations inspiring this hypothesis include the findings that global remapping or contextual changes are accompanied by grid realignment or expansion relative to a local enclosure (<a href=\"#bib32\">Fyhn et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Barry et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Marozzi et al., 2015</a>) and that global remapping can be elicited through the partial inactivation of MEC (<a href=\"#bib59\">Miao et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Rueckemann et al., 2016</a>). In our experiments, the rats may have come to recognize and memorize each manipulation type as a separate experience or spatial context, which was consistently rendered by a reproducible change of dominant reference frame or (more often) by a distinct anchoring of the grid map to the same dominant reference frame. A more extreme example was noticed in one rat in which the regularity of the grid itself was dramatically disrupted for weeks in one type of manipulation only (ROT70). This highly selective grid disruption was triggered by the conflict between proximal and distal cues in the absence of any structural alteration of the platform. Thus the grid disruption cannot be attributed to tensions induced by the platform frame alone (<a href=\"#bib4\">Barry et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Derdikman et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Stensola et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Krupic et al., 2015</a>) but probably to the grid system\u2019s attempt to reconcile proximal and distal inputs. It is perhaps surprising that this response (as well as other seemingly 'dysfunctional' adaptations that we observed, such as under-rotations/translations) appeared to be consolidated instead of being corrected over the course of weeks of experience, similar to previous observations of grid distortions (<a href=\"#bib24\">Derdikman et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Stensola et al., 2012</a>, <a href=\"#bib83\">2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Krupic et al., 2015</a>). In fact, hypothesized functions of the grid system may be preserved even in the presence of grid distortions (<a href=\"#bib80\">Stemmler et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Carpenter and Barry, 2016</a>), and if small geometric idiosyncrasies of the inputs disproportionately contribute to triggering place-cell global remapping\u2014as entailed by theoretical models relating grid cells to place cells (<a href=\"#bib74\">Savelli and Knierim, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Monaco et al., 2011</a>)\u2014then their consolidation could well prove necessary for consistently recalling the correct place-cell map. A seeming counter-example to the involvement of grid framing in proper context recall was instead noticed in one rat in which different grid maps were produced in identical cue configurations at the beginning and the\u00a0end of the experimental day (STD vs. STD2, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). But even in this case a short-term memory process appeared at play, since we anecdotally found the later grid map to reflect the recent history of experimental interventions (<a href=\"#bib35\">Gupta et al., 2014</a>), which could be regarded as a form of contextual discrimination."

However, because the manipulation-specific grid realignments observed in our experiments were not randomly generated, stabilizing cues other than local boundaries seem necessary at least during the first experience of a manipulation before this learning occurs. In our apparatus, the distal visual landmarks on the room walls, or the room walls/boundaries themselves, were probably utilized to stabilize the grid in addition to local boundaries. Information about distal walls and landmarks may reach grid cells via boundary/landmark vector cells (<a href=\"#bib58\">McNaughton et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Hartley et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Lever et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Deshmukh and Knierim, 2013</a>) (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

By forcing the grids to dissociate from familiar cues, our experimental protocols offered additional opportunities for testing this rigidity. Simultaneously recorded grid cells responded consistently to the conflicting cues, even when their responses implied a large collective drift from the familiar reference frames. Furthermore, grid coordination was very high regardless of the extent of the animal\u2019s previous experience with the manipulation (<a href=\"#fig8s2\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

This finding suggests the existence of internal mechanisms that can keep multi-scale grid populations geometrically coupled. Single-scale grid coupling is a built-in property of most attractor-network models of grid pattern generation (<a href=\"#bib31\">Fuhs and Touretzky, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">McNaughton et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Bonnevie et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Burak and Fiete, 2009</a>). By construction, all grid cells within the same attractor network have identical scale and orientation while their phase differences are determined by the (fixed) network connectivity; thus, the grids remain geometrically coupled no matter their collective response to environmental modifications. However, coordination of grids of different spacing seems to require extending this model with an explicit mechanism for interlocking multiple networks operating at different spatial scales (<a href=\"#bib44\">Knierim and Zhang, 2012</a>). Oscillatory models (<a href=\"#bib16\">Burgess et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Hasselmo et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Blair et al., 2007</a>), on the other hand, do not rely on an extensive network in their basic form. Because they essentially work by turning velocity-modulated temporal oscillations into grid-like spatial oscillations, synchronizing the former might in principle \u2018synchronize\u2019 the latter, thus spatially interlocking the grids. Interlocked grids at different scales would require \u2018n:m\u2019 reciprocal entrainment, by which n cycles of one rhythm correspond to m cycles of the other, possibly at different phase-lags (<a href=\"#bib96\">Zhang et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Deshmukh et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Belluscio et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Brandon et al., 2013</a>). Such a framework, to our knowledge, has not been explored (but <a href=\"#bib97\">Zilli and Hasselmo, 2010</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib9\">Blair et al., 2014</a>\u00a0investigated the synchronization of velocity-modulated oscillators for path-integration error-correction). In a third type of model, Hebbian learning of a grid-forming synaptic pattern is enabled by the spatiotemporal interaction of fast adaptive neural dynamics and spatial inputs that vary on a much slower behavioral timescale (<a href=\"#bib48\">Kropff and Treves, 2008</a>; see also <a href=\"#bib30\">Franzius et al., 2007</a>). The spacing of the grid depends on the time constant of the intrinsic adaptive dynamics. Common orientation in a population of grid cells and invariance of reciprocal phase relationships in multiple environments can be achieved in this model by plastic collateral connections at the time of learning (<a href=\"#bib77\">Si et al., 2012</a>). Future work with this model could investigate how these geometric properties extend to similarly inter-connected populations of grid cells spanning multiple scales. Regardless of the class of models under consideration, the extensions required of existing models to enable multi-scale interlocking could produce theoretical insights into the functional reasons for the quantal organization of the\u00a0grid spacing (<a href=\"#bib4\">Barry et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Stensola et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Knierim and Zhang, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Stensola and Moser, 2016</a>)."

Those investigators observed a scale-dependent response of grid cells by compressing one axis of the enclosure: smaller-scale grids were \u2018chopped off' by the compressed apparatus, whereas larger-scale grids compressed along with it. Thus the mechanism responsible for the cross-scale grid coupling observed in our data may not always be active, and it is therefore unlikely to rely solely on genetically or developmentally hardwired networks. Alternatively, this mechanism may not apply to grid rescaling as it does to grid realignments, as anecdotally suggested by a mildly divergent rescaling followed by tight geometric coupling in a pilot protocol we described (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

We did not typically screen for grid cells as a precondition to perform experimental sessions on a given day, but we tended to run more sessions if previous days had yielded grid cells, or if the\u00a0active observation of the ongoing experiment otherwise suggested the presence of grid cells."

To estimate the rat\u2019s speed, its trajectory was first smoothed by convolving both raw x,y position time series with a clipped Gaussian mask with variance\u00a0=\u00a0300 ms. The mask values were renormalized at each step. Rat\u2019s speed in cm/s was calculated for each of the 30 Hz frame intervals based on the rat displacement between the two consecutive frames. Epochs longer than 500 ms, in which the speed remained below 3 cm/s, were expunged from the original, unsmoothed trajectory and from the spike train. The rat positions left in the unsmoothed trajectory were then binned in 3 \u00d7 3 cm bins to produce an occupancy map of the rat\u2019s dwell time in each bin. The firing rate map was obtained by dividing the count of spikes occurring in each bin by the total occupancy in the same bin. Bins with less than 50 ms dwell time were marked as unoccupied (missing value) and excluded in visualization and analysis. The rate map was then smoothed by a clipped 2D Gaussian mask with 5 \u00d7 5 bins and variance\u00a0=\u00a02. The values of the mask were dynamically renormalized to account for unoccupied bins falling within the mask at each convolution step. If less than five occupied bins fell within the mask at any step, the output bin in the smoothed map was marked as unoccupied (missing value). \u2018Bootstrapped\u2019 rate maps were obtained by repeating the entire procedure after the spike train was resampled with replacement to obtain a new spike train of equal size 100 times, yielding 100 bootstrapped rate maps for each original rate map."

We then computed the crosscorrelogram of the two rate maps. The grid phase shift was given by the vector representing the displacement of the center of mass of the most central correlation field in the crosscorrelogram from the center of the crosscorrelogram.

Because both rate maps are calculated in the platform reference frame (from two cameras, see above), this is the grid phase shift relative to both the platform and geometric reference frames. To compute the phase shift relative to the room, we need to compare the observed platform-based phase shift with the one expected if the same grid were to remain perfectly anchored to the room and the platform were to reveal a different region of its pattern (i.e. corresponding to a null, room-based phase shift). The platform-based phase shift expected in this scenario occurs along the platform translation axis and equals the remainder of the division between the magnitude of the\u00a0platform translation (68.5 cm) and the period of the grid projected along the translation axis. This phase shift can be expressed as a fraction of the grid period (projected on the translation axis, which is the x axis of the autocorrelogram) in radians:"

Thus, for these analyses, we only analyzed grid pairs with quantitatively distinct spatial firing patterns (Pearson correlation of STD rate maps\u00a0&lt;\u00a00.5) to minimize the potential influence of this asymmetry in possible correlations."

We also repeated each statistical test in a \u2018thinned\u2019 dataset, obtained by enforcing the constraint that no two units recorded in different days from the same tetrode can be both present in the dataset if their estimated anatomical distance along the tetrode trajectory was less than 150 \u00b5m. The constraint was generally enforced on samples intended as the combination of the unit itself (defined as rat, day, tetrode, and spike sorting cluster identifiers) and the manipulation type: a unit that is discarded for one manipulation may be retained for another, depending on whether the suspected duplicate from another day had been subjected to the same manipulation. The only exception in which we thinned by unit identity alone, with no consideration of the\u00a0manipulation type, was the comparison of proportions of cells passing the gridness test in different manipulations for rat 387 (section \"Neural correlates of the local VS. remote cue conflict\"). The thinning procedure was completely automated with no manual intervention.

Accordingly, to perform statistical tests and comparisons on angles denoting grid directions and rotations, we employed circular statistical methods after the [\u221230\u00b0,+30\u00b0] range and sample angles were linearly mapped onto the full circle spanning the [\u2212180\u00b0,+180\u00b0] range.

There is a consistent set of cases where ambiguous rotations are remapped according to the distal cues."

However, the authors present countervailing evidence to the emerging view that local borders are the sole determinants of the grid cells firing pattern. Therefore, despite the lack of a \"surprising factor\", the work is timely and relevant. The paper provides many \"missing pieces of the puzzle\" of how grid cells actually work and I can see myself in the near future, as a theoretical scientist, using this manuscript as reference. Importantly, the methodology seems to be rigorous, aligned to the community standards and is scientifically sound. Thus, I would recommend its acceptance for publication granted that my concerns (described below) and minor clarity issues in the manuscript are solved."

However, it concerns me whether drift in the grid cell activity during such a long period contaminates the statistics. Mainly, the grid cell pattern could possibly switch between different anchors in time. If so, it would interfere in the gridness values and grid orientation. To better understand this issue, the authors could examine the stability of the grid cells comparing the first and second halves of the exploration or come with a metric about how long does it take for the grid map to stabilize. They can compare these analyses in STD and conflictual conditions."

The size of the platform in this study is rather large (137x137cm if compared to 80x80cm in other studies). I'm concerned if whether the reported dominance is uniform across the whole platform. One possible side effect of the compartmentation is that grid cells might not be regarded as grid cells (low grid score). The authors could segment the apparatus and analyze different parts separately. They can look whether the anchor in one side of the arena is the same as in another side (same for center vs. borders)."

It is inappropriate in most neural coding contexts, where cause-effect relations are merely convenient short-hands for directed interactions, and interactions tend to be multifarious. It is particularly inappropriate in studies like this one, where competing interactions are quantitatively set against each other. In my view the authors should recast their analyses in the language of quantifying the strength of each interaction they look at, rather than extracting p-values. For example, in the three-way competition thought to occur in the ROT70 condition, would a low p for the \"intermediate\" hypothesis of room control be distinguishable for a specific combination of the two extremal hypotheses of platform and geometric control, with little room control?"

Epochs of animal immobility \u2013 when the hippocampal spatial representation can stop tracking the animal position while \u201creplaying\u201d previously experienced trajectories in the present or other familiar environments \u2013 were not used in the calculation of the rate map, thus any distortion in the grids cannot be attributed to this phenomenon.

In most cases, the sign of these differences did not depend on the size of the sliding time window used to compute the velocities (66ms and 1s) and the differences were found to be statistically significant (as assessed by Mann-Whitney or Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests on very large data sets pooled from all days). We refrain from interpreting these particular results, as the effect sizes are very small. As mentioned in the response to the previous comment, our impression is that the type of apparatus and individual differences played a role in the emergence of different responses in different rats, but the statistical validation of this impression requires a larger number of rats.

Mainly, the grid cell pattern could possibly switch between different anchors in time. If so, it would interfere in the gridness values and grid orientation.

We had noticed that some of these distortions (including 387) might result from an anisotropic balance of relative dominance of the two reference frames, possibly center vs. periphery, as the reviewer also wondered. Compartment-based analyses of the kind employed in the cited studies and recommended by the reviewer can in principle quantify these effects. But for compartmentalized analyses to work, enough vertices of the grid would need to fall within each compartment to make a reliable local autocorrelogram. Unfortunately, we anticipate that this would not be the case for most of our data. Prior to our original submission, we made progress on devising alternative analyses, but we realized that such effort would evolve into a study of its own that is best dealt with separately."

This criterion minimizes the chance that the loss of gridness was caused by mounting noise in the recordings, so we reasoned that these were the most likely candidates in which a loss of gridness caused by a compartmented response could be observed. Visual inspection of their rate and spike/trajectory maps suggested that in the majority of these cases the failure to pass the gridness test could be likely attributed to (1) poorer spatial sampling (i.e. not uniformly repeated multiple times) that did not pass the bootstrap part of our gridness test or (2) a large grid dissociating from the platform and losing a vertex (or a large part of it), making its grid structure no longer detectable. In no case did the number of visible vertices seem to allow the type of analysis discussed above. Because we are not able to adequately address the reviewer\u2019s concern with our current data, we believe it would be best to not discuss the issue in the paper.
