It has been proposed that expanded transcripts adopt G-quadruplex (G-Q) structures and associate with proteins, but whether this occurs and contributes to disease is unknown. Here we show first that the protein that predominantly associates with GGGGCC repeat RNA in vitro is the splicing factor hnRNP H, and that this interaction is linked to G-Q formation. We then show that G-Q RNA foci are more abundant in C9 ALS patient fibroblasts and astrocytes compared to those without the expansion, and more frequently colocalize with hnRNP H. Importantly, we demonstrate dysregulated splicing of multiple known hnRNP H-target transcripts in C9 patient brains, which correlates with elevated insoluble hnRNP H/G-Q aggregates. Together, our data implicate C9 expansion-mediated sequestration of hnRNP H as a significant contributor to neurodegeneration in C9 ALS/FTD."

It has been proposed that expanded transcripts adopt G-quadruplex (G-Q) structures and associate with proteins, but whether this occurs and contributes to disease is unknown. Here we show first that the protein that predominantly associates with GGGGCC repeat RNA in vitro is the splicing factor hnRNP H, and that this interaction is linked to G-Q formation. We then show that G-Q RNA foci are more abundant in C9 ALS patient fibroblasts and astrocytes compared to those without the expansion, and more frequently colocalize with hnRNP H. Importantly, we demonstrate dysregulated splicing of multiple known hnRNP H-target transcripts in C9 patient brains, which correlates with elevated insoluble hnRNP H/G-Q aggregates. Together, our data implicate C9 expansion-mediated sequestration of hnRNP H as a significant contributor to neurodegeneration in C9 ALS/FTD."

Expansion of a hexanucleotide, GGGGCC (G<sub>4</sub>C<sub>2</sub>) in an intervening sequence separating two putative first, noncoding exons in the gene <i>C9ORF72</i> (C9) (<a href=\"#bib13\">DeJesus-Hernandez et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Renton et al., 2011</a>) is the most frequent known cause of both disorders. How this expansion leads to disease is unclear, although several non-mutually exclusive mechanisms have been suggested. The existence of ribonucleoprotein inclusions involving the RNA binding proteins TDP-43 or FUS in the brains and spinal cords of nearly all ALS patients and the occurrence of ALS-causing mutations in their respective genes (<a href=\"#bib33\">Ling et al., 2013</a>) suggest that defects in RNA processing lead to neurodegeneration. In the case of C9ALS, sequestration of RNA-binding proteins by the transcribed G<sub>4</sub>C<sub>2</sub> expansion is a proposed pathogenic mechanism, and it has been shown that RNA from this locus forms intranuclear foci in the brains of affected individuals (<a href=\"#bib15\">Donnelly et al., 2013</a>). However, while a number of proteins have been suggested to bind the transcribed repeats (<a href=\"#bib22\">Haeusler et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Lee et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Cooper-Knock et al., 2014</a>), the functional significance of such binding is not well established. It has also been shown that poly dipeptide repeat (DPR) proteins are translated from repeat-containing transcripts, and DPRs may contribute toxic effects of their own (<a href=\"#bib36\">Mori et al., 2013b</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Kwon et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Wen et al., 2014</a>)."

Second, the sequence of the expansion favors formation of an especially stable G quadruplex (G-Q) structure, which consists of planar tetrad arrays of four non-sequential guanosine residues connected by Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds. Two or more of these planar arrays then interact through pi-pi stacking, stabilized by a central monovalent cation, generally potassium (<a href=\"#bib12\">Davis, 2004</a>). Independent G-Qs can stack upon each other, forming higher order multimers. This is relevant to sequences that have many repetitive G-Q motifs in a series, such as is in telomeres and in expanded regions like C9 (<a href=\"#bib40\">Patel et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Martadinata et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Payet and Huppert, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Kobayashi et al., 2011</a>)."

For example, stability is greater for RNA versus equivalent DNA structures, reflecting the presence of 2\u2019 hydroxyls that participate in H-bonds within the RNA quadruplex (<a href=\"#bib8\">Collie et al., 2011</a>). Furthermore, four quartet G-Qs, such as the <i>O. nova</i> telomeric sequence (GGGGTTTT)<sub>n</sub>, are substantially more stable than their three quartet human telomeric counterparts, which in turn are more stable than G-Qs with two quartets (<a href=\"#bib31\">Lee et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Mullen et al., 2012</a>). The fact that RNA G-Qs, and more so those with four quartets such as the C9 expansion, are so exceptionally stable is important when considering toxic function arising from repeat RNA in ALS/FTD. It has been proposed that G-Q formation is a significant aspect of the toxicity of the repeats in ALS/FTD (<a href=\"#bib22\">Haeusler et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Simone et al., 2015</a>), but whether such structures are indeed prevalent in C9 ALS/FTD patient brains, and if so, whether, and how, they are pathogenic in ALS/FTD has not been determined."

Using a sensitive UV-crosslinking assay, we identified the splicing factor hnRNP H as the predominant C9 RNA binding protein in a brain cell-derived nuclear extract, and show how this interaction reflects association with G-Q containing repeats. Significantly, using G-Q- and hnRNP H-specific antibodies for immunofluorescence, we observed more G-Q structures and increased hnRNP H colocalization in C9 patient-derived cells than in control cells. We detected aberrant alternative splicing of multiple known hnRNP H splicing targets in C9 patient brains, and show that this correlated with increased levels of insoluble G-Q associated hnRNP H in these same brain samples. Intriguingly, the magnitude of splicing deregulation we observed in these specimens also roughly correlated with disease severity. Our results thus support a model in which the G<sub>4</sub>C<sub>2</sub> repeat expansions in C9 RNA form stable G-Q structures that sequester hnRNP H in insoluble aggregates, which in turn lead to changes in hnRNP H-target exon inclusion in a variety of disease-relevant transcripts."

While previous studies have identified a number of possible C9 RNA binding proteins (<a href=\"#bib22\">Haeusler et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Lee et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Cooper-Knock et al., 2014</a>; see Discussion), we investigated this in a way that allowed us not only to analyze direct binding with sensitivity and selectivity, but also to determine the possible influence of G-Q formation on binding. To this end, we incubated 32P CTP-labeled in vitro\u00a0transcribed RNAs containing ten C9 repeats (10R), typically at a concentration of ~1 nM, in nuclear extract prepared from U87 glioblastoma cells (NE) and exposed the samples to UV light. Crosslinked RNA-protein complexes were digested with RNAse A, T1, a mixture of both, or nothing, and resolved by SDS-PAGE. We consistently observed two predominant bands, one of ~60\u201365\u2009kDa and one ~75\u2009kDa (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1a</a>). Unexpectedly, these species were unaffected by RNAse A, T1 or both (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1a</a>, lanes 2\u20135), with the only difference being that in the absence of RNAse, a band appeared at the top of the gel, possibly reflecting higher-order aggregates that failed to migrate into the gel (lane 2). Notably, although the RNA alone ran as a single band of the predicted size on denaturing urea PAGE (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b</a>, lanes 1 and 5, bottom), on SDS PAGE the free RNA gave rise to two bands, one at the expected MW of the full-length RNA (~20\u201325\u2009kDa, based on protein markers), and a lower band that migrated faster (~15\u2009kDa) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1a</a>, lane 1). The fact that RNAse had no effect on the mobility of the crosslinked doublet suggested that the shifted RNA was in fact still full-length and thus resistant to RNAse. Given that the free RNA also resolved into two bands, we hypothesized that the two higher MW species resulted from crosslinking of the same protein to two differentially mobile full-length RNAs."

It has been reported that transcripts containing multiple independent G-Qs can give rise to distinct species on native gels due to multiple folded conformations (<a href=\"#bib41\">Payet and Huppert, 2012</a>). To test whether the RNAs we detected represent different G-Q conformations, we immunoprecipitated (IPed)10R in either water or G-Q stabilizing conditions of 200\u2009mM KCl and 500 \u03bcM pyridostatin (PDS) using the G-Q specific antibody BG4 (<a href=\"#bib3\">Biffi et al., 2013</a>), and resolved the IPed RNA by nondenaturing (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b</a>, top) or denaturing (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1b</a>, bottom) PAGE. On denaturing PAGE, full-length RNA was detected following IP, consistent with the presence of G-Q (lane 5, bottom). On nondenaturing PAGE, both products were recovered following IP (lane 5, top), indicating that both species contain G-Qs. Pre-incubation of the RNA in KCl and PDS enhanced the efficiency of IP (lane 5 versus lane 4); however, G-Q stabilization was not necessary for recognition of 10R by BG4, as we observed minor recovery of 10R in water, visible upon longer exposure (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, lane 4). We conclude that the two 10R species resolved by nondenaturing PAGE reflect two distinct G-Q states, e.g., one in which four G<sub>4</sub>C<sub>2</sub> tracts form one G-Q, and the other in which eight tracts form two G-Qs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1c</a>)."

To this end, we attempted to denature RNA structures by heating in water to 95\u00a0\u00b0C either 10R or a derivative (10R-7dG) in which GTP was replaced during transcription with the G-Q destabilizing GTP analog 7-deaza GTP (7dG). RNAs were then added to NE, crosslinked, treated with RNAses and the pattern following SDS PAGE compared to RNA that had been kept on ice prior to crosslinking (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1d</a>). Heating 10R slightly reduced the appearance of the crosslinked doublet, leading to a corresponding increase of a band at ~50\u2009kDa (compare lanes 1 and 3). More striking results were observed with 10R-7dG. Even in the absence of heating, crosslinking to produce the high MW doublet was substantially reduced relative to 10R (lane 2), supporting the view that these species represent protein binding to G-Q RNA. Strikingly, heating 10R-7dG abolished appearance of the doublet and produced strong crosslinking that gave rise to the ~50\u2009kDa species (lane 4). (A weaker band was detected just below the 50\u2009kDa species; as described below, the two are very likely related). Notably, the only free RNA (at the bottom of the gel) that underwent significant RNAse degradation was heated 10R-7dG (lane 4), consistent with the idea that RNAse resistance reflects stable G-Q structures."

Unheated 10R-G reproduced the doublet pattern observed with 10R (lane 3). However, heated 10R-G resulted in the nearly complete loss of the doublet and appearance of increased amounts of the 50\u2009kDa species (and fainter band beneath), as well as a reduction in intensity of the upper free RNA species (lane 5). With unheated 10R-G-7dG we observed much higher levels of 50\u2009kDa bands than with 10R (compare lanes 2 and 4). When 10R-G-7dG was heated, only the 50\u2009kDa bands remained, and the free RNA underwent significant degradation, similar to what was observed with 10R-7dG (compare lanes 4 and 6). To extend these results, we incubated 10R-G and 10R-G7dG in 0.1\u2009M KCl before heating, reasoning that stabilization of G-Qs might counteract denaturation. Indeed, crosslinking to 10R-G incubated in 0.1\u2009M KCl led to less crosslinking at 50\u2009kDa and reappearance of the higher MW doublet (compare lane 7 to lane 5). Likewise, heating 10R-G7dG in 0.1\u2009M KCl reduced appearance of the 50\u2009kDa band, while also resulting in a faint higher MW doublet (lane 8). These results both strengthen our hypothesis that the crosslinked species all arise from interaction with the same protein, and also indicate that the identity of the labeled nucleotide can indeed influence crosslinking and/or protection from RNAse."

With 10R-7dG, the major and minor 50\u2009kDa crosslinked species described above were IPed, but the more abundant higher MW species again were not (lane 8). With 10R, the higher MW doublet was again the major species detected, and was also not IPed (lanes 2\u20134). Nonetheless, we believe this doublet does in fact represent hnRNP H, but the structured nature of the RNA that enables the complex to resist RNAse degradation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1a</a>) also obstructs recognition by hnRNP H antibody (see also below). Note that the band just beneath the 50\u2009kDa species may represent the highly related protein hnRNP H2, which would be predicted to IP with the hnRNP H antibody (<a href=\"#bib51\">Stark et al., 2011</a>)."

Although the data are consistent with the doublet also arising from hnRNP H crosslinking, we utilized two additional approaches to investigate this further. First, we purified hnRNP H1- 6XHIS from <i>E. coli</i> (H1; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2c</a>) and performed UV-crosslinking assays with H1 incubated with 10R-G that was digested with RNAse A/T1 or not, and compared the results with the pattern in NE (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2d</a>). In this case, to enhance the\u00a0potential G-Q formation and thus detection of the doublet, we included 50\u2009mM KCl in the buffer. Crosslinking with NE followed by RNAse treatment produced a combination of the doublet and ~50\u2009kDa species (lane 3). Notably, the amount of doublet was much greater, and the amount of the 50\u2009kDa species much less, than when crosslinking was performed in the absence of KCl (compare with <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1e</a>, lane 5). Crosslinking with purified H1 followed by RNAse treatment led to a single species running slightly above 50\u2009kDa (lane 1), reflecting the ~4\u2009kDa affinity tag on H1. However, when products were not treated with RNAse, both H1 and NE produced highly similar patterns of doublets, as well as lower mobility species that failed to migrate into the gel, likely reflecting larger multimers as observed above (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2b</a>, lane 3). Notably, when we heated the RNA even more stringently (to 100\u00b0C) and omitted KCl (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2e</a>), we observed a much simpler pattern, essentially showing only the 50\u2009kDa (NE, lane 3) or 54\u2009kDa (H1, lane 4) species."

To this end, we prepared two U87 cell NEs, one treated with an siRNA targeting hnRNP H (siH) and the other with a negative control siRNA (siNC). We were unable to deplete HnRNP H completely, but reduced its levels in siH NE to roughly 45% relative to siNC NE (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>, top right; silver stained gel (lower right) confirmed equivalent protein concentrations in two NEs). We then performed UV crosslinking with 10R-G in both NEs. Importantly, both species in the crosslinked doublet, as well as the band at the top of the gel, were significantly reduced in siH NE relative to the amount detected in siNC NE (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>). We conclude that hnRNP H is the predominant, and perhaps only, protein in U87 NE to crosslink to 10R and that the variations in mobility reflect differential G-Q formation and/or stability."

This approach allowed us to estimate the affinity of hnRNP H for C9 RNA, as well as examine any quantitative preference for the folded versus unfolded conformation. For this, we used RNAs with four G<sub>4</sub>C<sub>2</sub> repeats, as the ten repeat RNAs produced complex patterns in these assays. RNAs were transcribed with GTP or 7-deaza-GTP to generate 4R and 4R-7dG and gel shift assays were performed with increasing concentrations of purified recombinant H1 (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). From these assays, we estimated the K<sub>D</sub> for the interaction between H1 and 4R to be 75.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a014 nM, while the affinity of H1 for 4R-7dG was significantly higher, with a K<sub>D</sub> of 13.5\u00b13.0 nM. Notably, we observed the appearance of supershifted RNA-protein complexes with both RNAs at higher concentrations of H1. This may reflect multiple H1 molecules binding to a single RNA, and is perhaps related to the higher-order structures observed in UV-crosslinking experiments. These results suggest that hnRNP H binds either to 4R RNA in both folded and unfolded conformations but with different modes of recognition and affinities, or preferentially to linear G-tracts, as has been found for the third qRRM domain of the highly related protein hnRNP F (<a href=\"#bib14\">Dominguez et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Samatanga et al., 2013</a>). Either mechanism, however, has relevance to the interaction of hnRNP H with the C9 repeats, as expanded transcripts are predicted to be composites of G-Qs and linear G-tracts. While determining the precise mode of binding will likely require structural studies, these results provide evidence that hnRNP H binds the C9 repeats with sufficient affinity for the interaction to be physiologically significant."

Previous efforts to visualize GGGGCC repeat foci in cells have relied on in situ hybridization (<a href=\"#bib15\">Donnelly et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Cooper-Knock et al., 2014</a>). However, this approach on the one hand may underestimate the extent of repeat foci because of the difficulties denaturing putative G-Q structures, while on the other provides no information on the structure of the repeats. We therefore asked instead whether an excess of G-Q structures exists in cells from ALS patients with the C9 expansion (C9ALS). We used the (Flag-tagged) BG4 antibody to visualize G-Qs by immunofluorescence of fibroblasts and astrocytes from C9ALS patients and from healthy individuals without neurological symptoms (all patient-derived samples described in <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>)."

The program displays only the BG4 foci (red) that coincide with DAPI staining in patient and control fibroblasts (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a</a>) and astrocytes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b</a>). We chose to limit our analysis of BG4 to DAPI-positive areas in order to avoid counting artifacts, since the majority of G-Q staining occurs in the nucleus and because DAPI staining in the cytoplasm can indicate presence of nucleic acids. Omitting BG4 but not FLAG antibody resulted in no staining in the red channel (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Due to potential variability in staining between experiments, we analyzed each experiment separately, normalizing the average counts per cell in each cell line to the average control cell in each experiment, providing a fold change relative to control. From four separate staining experiments with fibroblasts, we compared 16 normalized values from seven C9ALS patients comprising a total of ~1860 cells to 12 values from five control lines comprising a total of 1350 cells using an unpaired t-test, with all C9ALS fibroblasts comprising one group, and all control fibroblasts another. This indicated that, on average, patient cells contained 1.8 times as many G-Q foci as control cells, with a false discovery rate of less than 0.1% (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3c</a>). Likewise, comparison of one C9ALS patient astrocyte line and one control over three separate experiments (210 and 227 total cells, respectively) revealed that patient cells had 2.0 times as many foci, with a false discovery rate of less than 5% (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3c</a>)."

One potential explanation for the low frequency of overlapping G-Q/hnRNP H foci we observed is that an excess of BG4-reactive RNA masked hnRNP H within RNA-bound aggregates. In support of this, when we counted colocalization events after RNAse A treatment in 44 patient astrocytes we found roughly the same rate of cytoplasmic colocalization events (9% after treatment as compared to 8.1% before), but more than three times as many nuclear colocalization events (20% after treatment compared to 6.2% before) (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). No colocalization events, nuclear or cytoplasmic, were detected in control astrocytes after RNAse A treatment.

(BG4 staining was not possible due to high variability and background.) We counted instances of nuclear hnRNP H foci that were larger than 0.5 microns in any dimension, which was approximately the lower limit for measurement of discernable puncta. Motor neurons (MNs) were identified based on their location in the ventral horn, size, and low DAPI signal. In the 36 C9ALS MNs we detected, we counted a total of 46 large hnRNP H foci, representing possible C9 RNA/hnRNP aggregates (see below). In contrast, in 19 nonALS MNs, we detected only three large hnRNP H foci. We conclude that hnRNP H distribution is significantly altered in disease-relevant MN populations in C9ALS patients."

We hypothesized that binding of hnRNP H to the C9 repeats leads to local depletion of hnRNP H, and the consequent deregulation of splicing targets. Such a mechanism would be similar to that which occurs in myotonic dystrophy type 1 and 2 (<a href=\"#bib59\">Wheeler and Thornton, 2007</a>). In the case of the C9 repeats, sequestration of hnRNP H would most frequently result in increased skipping of cassette exons whose inclusion is mediated by concentration-dependent binding of hnRNP H to G-runs enriched in the immediate downstream intron (<a href=\"#bib60\">Xiao et al., 2009</a>). To investigate this possibility, we first searched RNA-seq datasets from hnRNP H knockdown (KD) and CLIP experiments (<a href=\"#bib60\">Xiao et al., 2009</a>) to identify potential hnRNP H targets of interest to the ALS/FTD disease continuum. We selected 13 exons (listed in <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>) whose inclusion appeared significantly reduced upon hnRNP H KD (<a href=\"#bib60\">Xiao et al., 2009</a>). Targets were selected on the basis of direct links to ALS/FTD or other neurological diseases (e.g. <i>ATXN2, KIF1C, PEX19, ARRB2</i>), or because of documented involvement in pathways implicated in ALS/FTD such as excitotoxictiy (<i>GABBR1, CABIN1</i>), protein degradation (<i>PSMD4, BAT3</i>), cytoskeletal remodeling and neuritogenesis (<i>PPP1R12C</i>) and RNA metabolism (<i>PAN2, RNH1, DAZAP1</i>).

For example, changes in expression of splicing factors with hnRNP H-regulated exons, such as RBM38, PCBP2 and HNRPDL, could alter splicing. Similarly, levels of the splicing factor hnRNP A1, which has been suggested to bind the C9 repeats (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cooper-Knock et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Zamiri et al., 2014</a>), have been suggested to influence roughly one third of the events that change upon hnRNP H depletion (<a href=\"#bib24\">Huelga et al., 2012</a>). We therefore asked whether cassette exons that are regulated by hnRNP A1 are misspliced in C9ALS relative to nonALS brains. We performed <sup>32</sup>P-RT-PCR across six exons affected by hnRNP A1 KD: three that undergo more skipping following hnRNP A1 depletion and three that are more included (<a href=\"#bib24\">Huelga et al., 2012</a>) (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3d\u2013f</a>). Only one exon, in <i>ZCCHC17</i>, differed significantly, and it was more excluded in C9ALS patients relative to nonALS, opposite the outcome that would be predicted if hnRNP A1 levels were reduced. Notably, the regulated exon in <i>ZCCHC17</i> had hnRNP H CLIP tags, ~100 bp downstream, likely coinciding with a potentially G-Q forming intronic sequence (<a href=\"#fig5s4\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). Only one other gene, <i>G2AD (AP1G2</i>), had CLIP tags in or near the regulated exon, overlapping a polyG exonic motif ~70 bp downstream (<a href=\"#fig5s4\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 4</a>).

To investigate this, we determined the mean percent exon inclusion of the 16 significantly misspliced hnRNP H target exons and the single SRSF2 and hnRNP A1 targets for each patient, and ordered the patients from lowest to highest average inclusion. We reasoned that if there was variation, the patient in which hnRNP H function was most reduced would have the lowest inclusion values, while the patient with the least functional reduction would have the highest exon inclusion values, for all of the genes, except for <i>WDR45, HNRPDL, RPL10</i> and <i>OS9</i>, which we hypothesized would display the opposite trend. Using linear regression, we plotted a best-fit line for each gene (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5m</a>), and indeed found that for every gene except <i>WDR45, HNRPDL, RPL10</i> and <i>OS9</i> a straight line with a positive slope could be drawn (values listed in <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>), demonstrating that the patient with the lowest average inclusion had the lowest percent inclusion for all genes tested. As expected, the lines for <i>WDR45, HNRPDL, RPL10</i> and <i>OS9</i> all had negative slopes. Interestingly, this trend also reflected disease duration, i.e., time from onset of symptoms until death, for each patient, a rough indicator of disease severity (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). Shorter disease duration correlated with greater changes in exon inclusion, suggesting that hnRNP H splicing dysregulation is a marker of clinical progression."

We quantified the abundance of hnRNP H in each fraction, summing them to find the amount of total hnRNP H, and determined the percentage of insoluble hnRNP H from two independent experiments. We plotted these values for C9ALS patients and nonALS controls and compared them using a t-test (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6b</a>). The average percentage of insoluble hnRNP H was 30.0% in nonALS and 56.1% in C9ALS (p=0.013). We conclude that there is 1.9 times as much insoluble hnRNP H in the motor cortex of C9ALS patients as compared to control, providing evidence that hnRNP H sequestration by C9 repeats occurs in the brains of ALS patients to a biochemically significant level."

To provide evidence for this, we performed co-IP with BG4 and the resuspended insoluble pellets from motor cortex from five C9ALS patients and five controls, followed by western blotting for hnRNP H, and for comparison, for SR proteins, including SRSF1 and SRSF2, which reportedly bind the C9 repeats (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6c</a>). We performed three independent co-IP experiments, and quantified the amount of hnRNP H that co-IPed with BG4 in C9ALS and non-ALS controls. We found, on average, 2.7 times as much hnRNP H co-IPed from the C9ALS samples as from the nonALS controls (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6d</a>) (p=0.0007). We obtained similar results when we performed no BG4, beads-alone controls and subtracted the hnRNP H signals without antibody from the signal with BG4 for each sample: 2.8 times as much hnRNP H co-IPed from the C9ALS samples as from the nonALS controls (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Using an antibody that recognizes a common phospho-epitope on all SR proteins, we did not detect co-IP of any SR proteins (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6c</a>). We conclude that hnRNP H forms aggregates with G-Qs in the brains of C9ALS patients, providing additional evidence that hnRNP H is indeed sequestered by C9\u2009G-Q RNA, and to an extent sufficient to bring about the observed splicing dysregulation. Below we discuss how the effects on splicing, and the aggregation itself, may be relevant to the ALS/FTD disease spectrum."

Our conclusion that hnRNP H is the major C9 binding protein is consistent with studies implicating it in in C9ALS (<a href=\"#bib32\">Lee et al., 2013</a>) as well as in G-Q binding (<a href=\"#bib11\">Dardenne et al., 2014</a>;<a href=\"#bib17\">Fisette et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">von Hacht et al., 2014</a>).

Moreover, a positive correlation between the extent of the change in inclusion and the number of G\u2019s in these G-runs was observed, and larger changes in splicing following KD were detected for exons with relatively weak 5\u2019 splice sites. Thus, when hnRNP H is depleted, or sequestered as we propose, these types of exons would be the most severely compromised. Indeed, sequencing of RNA from C9ALS patient brains revealed global changes in alternative splicing, particularly skipping of exons that are proximally enriched for putative hnRNP H binding motifs (<a href=\"#bib42\">Prudencio et al., 2015</a>). Our work provides a mechanism to explain these findings, and implicates G-Q formation and hnRNP H sequestration in the pathogenesis of ALS/FTD."

While it is unknown which, if any, of the splicing changes we detected are disease relevant, all of the target genes we analyzed encode proteins that can be mechanistically linked to ALS/FTD. For example, <i>ATXN2</i> encodes a polyglutamine protein associated with spinocerebellar ataxia 2 (<a href=\"#bib25\">Imbert et al., 1996</a>) and contains an expansion that also confers increased susceptibility to ALS in sporadic (<a href=\"#bib16\">Elden et al., 2010</a>), and possibly C9 (<a href=\"#bib56\">van Blitterswijk et al., 2014</a>), cases. Additionally, <i>GABBR1</i> encodes one of the subunits of the heterodimeric GABA receptor B (GABA<sub>B</sub>R). When exon 19 is skipped, as we observed in patient brains, a frameshift occurs, likely reducing levels of GABBR1 protein. GABA is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mammalian CNS (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gassmann and Bettler, 2012</a>) and reduced GABA-mediated inhibition may contribute to excitotoxic cell death in ALS (<a href=\"#bib5\">Brockington et al., 2013</a>), which may provide a molecular basis for the potentially pathogenic finding of cortical hyperexcitability in C9ALS patients (<a href=\"#bib19\">Geevasinga et al., 2015</a>).

We hypothesize that slight alterations in expression of the genes described above, and perhaps other hnRNP H-regulated transcripts, together contribute to ALS/FTD pathology. We propose that over time, RNA transcribed from the C9 repeats eventually accumulates to levels sufficient to titrate cellular supplies of hnRNP H, thus leading to splicing defects of target transcripts. Some of these changes, such as with genes we have analyzed, would be 'driver' events, others, perhaps most, would be 'passenger' events that do not contribute to disease. While deleterious consequences arising from missplicing might be tolerated or avoided in dividing cells that can regenerate before hnRNP H levels become sufficiently low, longer-lived, postmitotic neurons would not have the advantage of clearing RNA-protein aggregates, which may themselves have toxic consequences for the cell. We predict that in neurons, sequestration of hnRNP H becomes more severe with time and continuing C9 transcription, until functional levels become low enough to deregulate splicing, providing an explanation for the age dependence of ALS/FTD."

Within the ALS/FTD spectrum, the composition and location of aggregates are useful for defining distinct disease subtypes that often reflect the diverse genetic underpinnings of these two related disorders (<a href=\"#bib54\">Thomas et al., 2013</a>). The most prevalent aggregations in ALS are ubiquitinated, cytoplasmic inclusions containing TDP-43, which occur in the brain and spinal cord of virtually all ALS patients, with the exception of SOD1 and FUS ALS cases. Thus far, the only aggregates unique to C9 are p62/ubiquitin-positive, TDP-43-negative cytoplasmic and nuclear inclusions containing DPRs derived from non-ATG translation of expanded C9 transcripts (<a href=\"#bib4\">Blokhuis et al., 2013</a>). Such DPRs can display neurotoxic properties (Mizielinska et al., 2014; <a href=\"#bib58\">Wen et al., 2014</a>), consistent with a role in MN death in ALS. However, it has been reported that they are enriched in non-vulnerable brain regions and largely absent from the spinal cord of C9ALS patients, raising questions regarding their exact role in motor neuron degeneration (Davidson et al., 2015). While foci containing expanded C9 RNA have been referred to as aggregates (<a href=\"#bib32\">Lee et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Reddy et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Zamiri et al., 2014</a>), whether this is in fact the case had not been previously investigated. Our experiments thus provide the first evidence that G-Q expansions bound to hnRNP H indeed form insoluble aggregates, and are present in disease-relevant regions of the brain. While we have focused on the consequences of hnRNP H sequestration on splicing, it remains to be seen if these aggregates also have dominant neurotoxic properties."

The program first prompts the user to set a variable threshold value between 0 and 1 for the intensity of the staining to be analyzed in the red channel, which corresponds to BG4 staining. We used a threshold of 0.1 for every image. The script then removes all staining in the red channel below the threshold intensity and removes any red channel staining that does not overlap with the staining in the blue channel (nucleus, or DAPI-stained cytoplasm). It then proceeds to utilize the regionprops function to measure the parameters of each continuous object in the image and then sums the area parameter of each object in the image, AreaTotal. Then a trimmed mean of areas is taken where the top and bottom 10% of area data is removed from the data set and the remainder of the area data is averaged. This provides the average area of a single stained object. Taking the AreaTotal and dividing by this average area gives a trimmed mean approximated object count, or foci count, referred to here."

Sections were blocked with 5% normal donkey serum diluted in Tris buffered saline (pH 7.4) with 0.2% Triton X-100 (TBS-T) and incubated with hnRNP H antibody (Bethyl) diluted in TBS-T with 5% normal donkey serum overnight at 4\u00b0C. After washing with TBS-T, tissue sections were incubated for 4\u2009hrs at RT with species-specific secondary antibody coupled to Alexa 568 (1:1000; Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). After washing with TBS-T, coverslips were applied with Flouromount G (Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL) and imaged in a blinded fashion using an SP5 Leica confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). The\u00a0images were converted into z-stack max projections and individual foci were measured using ImageJ."

The repeat has been shown to adopt a highly stable G quadruplex structure of stacked G-quartets. It is predicted that the G<sub>4</sub>C<sub>2</sub> sequence will also bind the proteins hnRNP H and possibly F, which recognize G-runs. The authors show that a 10-repeat RNA does form quadruplexes based on its gel mobility, RNase insensitivity, and reactivity with a quadruplex-specific antibody BG4. This same RNA also crosslinks to hnRNP H, and from a variety of experiments the authors show that the protein binds to RNA that contains quadruplexes. They then examine the BG4 and hnRNP H immunostaining patterns of C9 patient and control astrocytes and fibroblasts. They find that both control and mutant cells stain with BG4 but the numbers of stained foci and their total area roughly double in the C9 mutant cells. Immunofluorescence with anti-hnRNP H antibodies identified a small number of nuclear and cytoplasmic inclusions co-stained for both BG4 and hnRNP H. These were significantly more frequent in C9 patient cells, but for most cells were not observed whether the cells were C9 mutant or wildtype. Postulating that the binding to the C9 repeat will sequester hnRNP H and reduce its activity on other transcripts, the authors compare the splicing of some known hnRNP H target exons in mutant and wildtype cells. They find modest but statistically significant changes in exon inclusion, which parallel changes seen after hnRNP H RNAi depletion. The patient cells exhibit graded splicing responses where cell lines showing the largest difference from wildtype on one exon show the largest effect for all exons. Interestingly, this gradient of hnRNP H response also parallels the severity of the disease as measured by time to death after diagnosis. Finally, the authors examine the amount of hnRNP H present in a Sarkosyl-insoluble form as a measure of the aggregated protein in cells. They find that the fraction of protein in insoluble aggregates is increased in ALS patient brain tissue over control brains and that this protein is precipitated with the BG4 anti-G quadruplex antibody."

The interaction between hnRNP H and C9 repeat RNA (4R, containing 4 repeats) is indeed of high affinity, supporting the physiological relevance of the proposed sequestration of hnRNP H. Specifically, we found that hnRNP H has higher affinity for a 7-deaza-GTP containing G-quadruplex (G-Q) deficient sequence (K<sub>D</sub> =13.5 nM) than for the same sequence unmodified (K<sub>D</sub> =75.5 nM). This suggests that G-Q formation may indeed decrease the amount of hnRNP H that is bound to C9 repeat RNA. While this aligns, as mentioned by the reviewers, with previous findings with the third qRRM (qRRM3) of hnRNP F and AGGGAU hexamers capable of forming intermolecular G-Qs (Samatanga et al., 2013), we note that our analysis used full-length hnRNP H1 and an RNA sequence that can form an intramolecular G-Q. Our measured K<sub>D</sub> value with unmodified repeats (75.5 nM) was less than half that measured previously with the 7-deaza GTP modified AGGGAU hexamers and hnRNP F qRRM3 (180 nM). Based on these results, we cannot say with certainty whether hnRNP H binds G-Qs, linear G runs, or both. However, as we now state in the text: \"These results suggest that hnRNP H binds either to 4R RNA in both folded and unfolded conformations but with different modes of recognition and affinities, or selectively to linear G-tracts, as has been found for the third qRRM domain of the highly related protein hnRNP F (Dominguez et al., 2010; Samatanga et al., 2013). Either mechanism, however, has relevance to the interaction of hnRNP H with the C9 repeats, as expanded transcripts are predicted to be composites of G-Qs and linear G-tracts. While determining the precise mode of binding will likely require structural studies, these results provide evidence that hnRNP H binds the C9 repeats with sufficient affinity for the interaction to be physiologically significant.\""

Crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (IP) provided proof that the 50 kDa species represents hnRNP H bound to short fragments of RNA. The appearance of this species was enhanced by treatments that allow degradation of unprotected RNA such as denaturing G-Qs with heat or by destabilizing G-Q tetrad formation with 7-deaza GTP. Conversely, the higher MW doublet, or 70 kDa species, represents a protein bound to full-length RNA, as proven by the RNAse insensitivity of this species. As additional evidence that the 50 and 70kDa species are related and reflect differences in RNA G-Q content, we expanded <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a> (new lanes 7 and 8, described in subsection \u201cCharacterization of C9 protein binding\u201d, last paragraph) to demonstrate that incubating RNA in G-Q stabilizing conditions (100 mM KCl) during heat denaturation allows for less RNAse degradation and thus more of the 70 kDa species than when the same RNA was heated in water, which gave more of the 50 kDa species."

Our explanation that this species does indeed represent hnRNP H bound to the full-length RNA was therefore deductive: when the excess G-Q RNA was degraded, the only protein that remained crosslinked was hnRNP H. Thus we find it highly unlikely that hnRNP H was not bound to the full-length RNA when it contained stable G-Qs. We note that this would be true regardless of whether hnRNP H recognizes linear G-tracts, G-Qs, or both, since all of the numerous G-Q folded conformations of ten GGGGCC repeats contain some linear portion of RNA (e.g., as illustrated schematically in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). This argument is also supported by the relative sizes of hnRNP H, the free RNA, and the 70 kDa species, as well as by the gel shift data showing that both the unmodified and 7-deaza GTP modified C9 RNAs bound hnRNP H with reasonable affinities."

In order to explicitly measure insoluble, i.e. aggregated, hnRNP H, we previously presented the ratio of sarkosyl soluble: insoluble hnRNP H of only the initially insoluble fraction obtained after cell lysis. However, this analysis neglected a significant fraction of hnRNP H found in the initially soluble fraction. We therefore changed the presentation of this data to reflect the percentage of sarkosyl insoluble hnRNP H out of total cellular hnRNP H, calculated as the sum of all three fractions. While we previously included cerebellum and motor cortex from a cohort of ten individuals, we found that the overall levels of hnRNP H were more consistent in motor cortex, and thus limited our analysis to this more disease-relevant brain region. Importantly, we also added four patients to our cohort (tissue recently made available), two C9ALS, one nonALS patient, and one sporadic ALS patient with a <i>SOD1</i> mutation, confirmed negative for C9 expansion (grouped with nonALS) (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>).

This data, coupled with the related biochemical analysis of sarkosyl insoluble G-Q RNA/hnRNP H aggregates (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C and D</a>), provide strong support for our conclusion that sufficient amounts of hnRNP H are sequestered to bring about the splicing changes observed."

Only one of the other five hnRNP A1 targets (<i>G2AD</i>) had hnRNP H CLIP tags in or around the regulated exon. Similar to <i>ZCCHC17</i>, inclusion of the <i>G2AD</i> exon was also decreased slightly in C9ALS brains (p= 0.096), opposite the effect predicted for hnRNP A1 depletion. The remaining hnRNP A1 targets not found to change detectably were devoid of hnRNP H CLIP tags near the regulated exons. This data, along with analysis of three SRSF2 targets already in the paper, support our conclusion that splicing of hnRNP H targets is preferentially deregulated in ALS patient brains."
