They are thought to exert their therapeutic effects through multiple mechanisms, including the inhibition of cyclo-oxygenases, modulation of NF-\u03baB activity, and direct activation of AMPK. However, the full spectrum of their activities is incompletely understood. Here we show that salicylate specifically inhibits CBP and p300 lysine acetyltransferase activity <i>in vitro</i> by direct competition with acetyl-Coenzyme A at the catalytic site. We used a chemical structure-similarity search to identify another anti-inflammatory drug, diflunisal, that inhibits p300 more potently than salicylate. At concentrations attainable in human plasma after oral administration, both salicylate and diflunisal blocked the acetylation of lysine residues on histone and non-histone proteins in cells. Finally, we found that diflunisal suppressed the growth of p300-dependent leukemia cell lines expressing AML1-ETO fusion protein <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. These results highlight a novel epigenetic regulatory mechanism of action for salicylate and derivative drugs."

They are thought to exert their therapeutic effects through multiple mechanisms, including the inhibition of cyclo-oxygenases, modulation of NF-\u03baB activity, and direct activation of AMPK. However, the full spectrum of their activities is incompletely understood. Here we show that salicylate specifically inhibits CBP and p300 lysine acetyltransferase activity <i>in vitro</i> by direct competition with acetyl-Coenzyme A at the catalytic site. We used a chemical structure-similarity search to identify another anti-inflammatory drug, diflunisal, that inhibits p300 more potently than salicylate. At concentrations attainable in human plasma after oral administration, both salicylate and diflunisal blocked the acetylation of lysine residues on histone and non-histone proteins in cells. Finally, we found that diflunisal suppressed the growth of p300-dependent leukemia cell lines expressing AML1-ETO fusion protein <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. These results highlight a novel epigenetic regulatory mechanism of action for salicylate and derivative drugs."

Aspirin is derived from salicylate but is a more potent drug. Aspirin exerts its anti-inflammatory effect by shutting down the activity of proteins that would otherwise boost inflammation. Aspirin achieves this by releasing a chemical marker, called an acetyl group, to be added to these proteins via a process known as protein acetylation. However, salicylate cannot trigger protein acetylation and so it was not clear how it reduces inflammation."

This experiment revealed that the thermal unfolding temperature of p300/acetyl-CoA was 48.6\u00b0C, while treatment with 10 and 25\u2009mM salicylate reduced the unfolding temperature to 46.1\u00b0C and 40.8\u00b0C, respectively (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>).

We therefore selected diflunisal for further analysis. Diflunisal induced deacetylation of specific histone residues, H2A<sub>K5, K9</sub>, H2B<sub>K12/K15</sub>, H3<sub>K56</sub> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), a pattern of histone acetylation similar to that induced by salicylate. Importantly, the IC<sub>50</sub> for H2B<sub>K12/K15</sub> inhibition in cells was 160\u2009\u03bcM, which is within the range of plasma concentrations of diflunisal (150\u2013350\u2009\u03bcM) after daily oral administration (<a href=\"#bib28\">Nuernberg et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Mano et al., 2006</a>).

To investigate a potential application of our newly characterized salicylate- and diflunisal-mediated inhibition of CBP/p300 activity, we tested the effects of various doses of salicylate and diflunisal on two AML1-ETO expressing cancer cell lines (human Kasumi-1 cells and a mouse AE9a-driven AML cell line that we generated). In support of our model, K24 and K43 acetylation of AML1-ETO were decreased in a dose-dependent manner by salicylate (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, left) and by diflunisal (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, right). Salicylate inhibited cell proliferation at concentrations as low as 1\u2009mM (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). This growth inhibition was caused in part by increased apoptosis, as shown by annexin V/7AAD double staining (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Diflunisal also increased apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Additional measurements of nuclear DNA distribution showed a dose-dependent increase of the sub-G1 cell fraction, highly suggestive of apoptotic fragmentation by salicylate (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>) and diflunisal (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>). We also noted an increased fraction of G1 cells and a decreased fraction of S and G2/M cells after salicylate treatment, consistent with reports that CBP/p300 is required for the G1/S transition (data not shown) (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ait-Si-Ali et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Iyer et al., 2007</a>). Salicylate did not affect the surface expression of differentiation-related antigens (CD11b and CD34 in Kasumi-1, Mac-1 and C-kit in AE9a) (data not shown), in accordance with our previous finding that acetylation of AML1-ETO is required for self-renewal and leukemogenesis but not for its ability to block cell differentiation (<a href=\"#bib42\">Wang et al., 2011</a>). To further test whether p300 is the relevant target of diflunisal in Kasumi-1 cells, we transduced lentiviral expression vectors for p300 or empty control into Kasumi-1 cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>). Cells transduced with the empty vector showed inhibition of growth by diflunisal, similar to untransduced cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H</a>). In contrast, p300-transduced cells were significantly more resistant to diflunisal (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H and I</a>), and exhibit less apoptotis measured by annexin V positive cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4J</a>) and sub-G1 fraction (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4K</a>). These results support the model that diflunisal kills Kasumi-1 cells by apoptosis due to p300 inhibition."

Many mechanisms of action have been proposed for the anti-inflammatory effects of salicylate in mammalian cells, including weak inhibition of cyclooxygenase (<a href=\"#bib43\">Warner et al., 1999</a>), inhibition of IKK\u03b2 inhibition (<a href=\"#bib47\">Yin et al., 1998</a>) and topoisomerase II (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cox et al., 2011</a>), modulation of NF-\u03baB (<a href=\"#bib22\">Kopp and Ghosh, 1994</a>), and activation of AMPK (<a href=\"#bib19\">Hawley et al., 2012</a>). The simple structure of salicylate might enable it to interact with different affinities with many cellular proteins, which could explain its pleiotropic effects. While we cannot completely rule out the possibility that the effects of salicylate on acetylation may derive in part from off-target effects, in addition to the direct interaction with CBP/p300 reported here, our study demonstrate a direct inhibition of p300 and CBP by salicylate, diflunisal and their metabolites (see discussion below)."

We identified histone AcH3K56 as the most sensitive histone acetyl mark to inhibition by both drugs. This results is highly consistent with the literature showing that CBP (also known as Nejire) in flies and CBP and p300 in humans acetylate H3K56 (<a href=\"#bib12\">Das et al., 2009</a>). We also note that the pattern of histone marks inhibition are remarkably similar between the two drugs, but at different concentrations in agreement with their relative abilities to inhibit p300/CBP <i>in vitro</i>. In terms of what is observed for the other histone aceylated sites, the situation is more complex. Indeed, many histone modifications are regulated by multiple HAT enzymes. For example, acetyl H4K5 is regulated by HAT1, CBP, p300, Tip60, HB01 whereas acetyl H3 K14 is regulated by CBP, p300, PCAF, gcn5, ScSAS3 (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kouzarides, 2007</a>). We therefore interpret the observed lack of inhibition of some histone H3 or H4 acetylation sites by salicylate or diflunisal to reflect the compensating activities or other histone acetyltransferases that target the same sites."

Therefore, salicylate\u2019s NF-\u03baB inhibitory effect can be at least partly explained by p300 inhibition. AMPK is reported to inhibit p300 acetyltransferase activity by phosphorylating p300 at serine 89 (<a href=\"#bib48\">Zhang et al., 2011</a>), suggesting that AMPK activation by allosteric salicylate binding might inhibit p300 indirectly. However, our findings clearly showed that salicylate does not inhibit p300 by activating AMPK since the p300 inhibition is insensitive to an AMPK inhibitor (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>)."

These data are therefore consistent with the proposed model that partial or complete inhibition of p300 by salicylate represents one of its relevant biological targets.

Reactions were initiated by addition of acetyl-CoA (final concentration = 5\u2009\u03bcM), bringing the final assay volume to 30\u2009\u03bcL. Assays were quenched after 10 min (&lt;15% product accumulation) by addition of 5\u2009\u03bcL of 0.5\u2009M neutral hydroxylamine and transferred to a Perkin-Elmer Lab-Chip EZ-Reader instrument for analysis. Separation conditions were: downstream voltage of \u2212500 V, upstream voltage of \u22122500 V, and a pressure of \u22121.5 psi. Percent conversion was calculated by ratiometric measurement of substrate/product peak heights. Percent activity represents the percent conversion of KAT reactions treated with inhibitors relative to untreated control KAT reactions, and corrected for nonenzymatic acetylation. Dose-response analysis of p300 inhibition was performed in triplicate and analyzed by nonlinear least-squares regression fit to Y = 100/(1 + 10\u2227(Log IC50 \u2013 X)*H), where H = Hill slope (variable). IC50 values represent the concentration that inhibits 50% of KAT activity. Calculations were performed using Prism 6 (GraphPad) software."

This finding is surprising but also important for several reasons. First, salicylate is widely known for its anti-inflammatory property by targeting mainly COX1/2 and other proteins. The finding that this molecule also acts on CBP/p300 adds another functionally important target to appreciate the role of salicylate. Second, the Nimer lab previously showed the importance of CBP/p300 for the survival of ETO AML and herein demonstrated that salicylate and diflunisal are effective against ETO AML at the dose relevant to depletion of several acetylation marks. The therapeutic implication of the two compounds is important given their ready use, although the two compounds may hit multiple other targets at the present high doses."

In particular, the new model of the formation of \"salicyl-CoA\" and \"diflunisal-CoA\", if they are indeed the cases, may explain many conflicting data in vitro. However, for such situations, the in vitro biochemical data may not be relevant anymore to evaluate these compounds because they will act differently upon the formation of CoA-adduct. In contrast, the weak interaction of salicyl or diflunisal only argues that HATs contain binding pockets to accommodate these moieties. The reviewer strongly suggests revising the wording of \"salicyl or diflunisal as inhibitors of HATs)\" into \"HATs contain the binding pockets of salicyl or diflunisal to engage the corresponding interaction in vitro and in cellular contexts\". By this way, it leaves the possibility that salicyl or diflunisal may be subject to the formation of CoA-adduct and thus act as pro-drugs inside cells. The paper can even be further strengthened by showing the formation of \"salicyl-CoA\" and \"diflunisal-CoA\" in a cellular setting."

However, salicylate does not, unlike its acetylated derivative aspirin, inhibit COX-1 and COX-2 activity in vitro (Vane, J. R. (1971) Nature New Biol. 231, 232\u2013235; Vargaftig, B. B. (1978) J.

However, salicylate has been shown to exert a comparable analgesic and anti-inflammatory action as aspirin. Salicylates have been proposed to exert their pharmacological effects via inhibition of the transcription factor nuclear factor NF-\u03baB and other targets.

In addition, our inhibition data in cell lines show a lower IC<sub>50</sub> (IC<sub>50</sub> ~5mM for H2B<sub>K12/15</sub>) and new data show that a salicylic acid metabolite, salicyl-CoA inhibits CBP/p300 with 28-fold increased potency in comparison with salicylate: IC<sub>50</sub> =220 \u03bcM for salicyl-CoA vs 6.12 mM for salicylate (new <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). These data are consistent with the proposed model that partial or complete inhibition of p300 by salicylate represents one of its relevant biological targets. It is important to note that a small molecule the size of salicylic acid used at such high concentrations is expected to interact with a number of cellular proteins. The observations presented in this manuscript support the hypothesis that some of the biological activities of salicylic acid and diflunisal are mediated via p300 inhibition."

This result is highly consistent with the literature showing that the histone acetyl transferase CBP (also known as Nejire) in flies and CBP and p300 in humans acetylate H3K56 (Das C, Lucia MS, Hansen KC, Tyler JK. CBP/p300-mediated acetylation of histone H3 on lysine 56. Nature. 2009 May 7; 459 (7243): 113-7). We also note that the pattern of histone marks inhibition are remarkably similar between the two drugs, but at different concentrations in agreement with their relative abilities to inhibit p300/CBP in vitro. In terms of what is observed for the other sites, the situation is more complex. Indeed, many histone modifications are known to be regulated by a variety of HAT enzymes. For example, acetyl H4<sub>K5</sub> is regulated by HAT1, CBP, p300, Tip60, and HB01 whereas acetyl H3 K14 is regulated by CBP, p300, PCAF, gcn5, and ScSAS3 (Cell128 (<a href=\"#bib35\">4</a>): 693-705.). We interpret the observed lack of inhibition of histone H3 or H4 acetylation by salicylate or diflunisal to reflect the compensating activities or other histone acetyltransferases that target the same sites."

Diflunisal is a known COX-1/2 inhibitor with IC<sub>50</sub> of 113\u00b5M (Proc Natl Acad Sci USA96 (13): 7563-8), but other NSAIDs that lack p300 inhibitory activity failed to inhibit Kasumi-1 cells growth (data not shown). Further, we have also tested the effect of p300 overexpression on the anticancer effect of diflunisal on Kasumi cell lines using lentiviral expression vectors for p300 or empty control (new <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>). Cells transduced with the empty vector showed inhibition of growth by diflunisal, similar to untransduced cells (new <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H</a>). In contrast, p300-transduced cells were significantly more resistant to diflunisal (new <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4, H and I</a>), and exhibit less apoptosis measured by annexin V positive cells (new <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4J</a>) and sub-G1 fraction (new <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4K</a>).

The reviewer strongly suggests revising the wording of \"salicyl or diflunisal as inhibitors of HATs)\" into \"HATs contain the binding pockets of salicyl or diflunisal to engage the corresponding interaction in vitro and in cellular contexts\". By this way, it leaves the possibility that salicyl or diflunisal may be subject to the formation of Co-A adduct and thus act as pro-drugs inside cells.
