We have previously reported that myeloid-defective zebrafish mutants display apoptosis of regenerative cells during fin fold regeneration. Here, we found that the apoptosis phenotype is induced by prolonged expression of <i>interleukin 1 beta</i> (<i>il1b</i>). Myeloid cells are considered to be the principal source of Il1b, but we show that epithelial cells express <i>il1b</i> in response to tissue injury and initiate the inflammatory response, and that its resolution by macrophages is necessary for survival of regenerative cells. We further show that Il1b plays an essential role in normal fin fold regeneration by regulating expression of regeneration-induced genes. Our study reveals that proper levels of Il1b signaling and tissue inflammation, which are tuned by macrophages, play a crucial role in tissue regeneration."

We have previously reported that myeloid-defective zebrafish mutants display apoptosis of regenerative cells during fin fold regeneration. Here, we found that the apoptosis phenotype is induced by prolonged expression of <i>interleukin 1 beta</i> (<i>il1b</i>). Myeloid cells are considered to be the principal source of Il1b, but we show that epithelial cells express <i>il1b</i> in response to tissue injury and initiate the inflammatory response, and that its resolution by macrophages is necessary for survival of regenerative cells. We further show that Il1b plays an essential role in normal fin fold regeneration by regulating expression of regeneration-induced genes. Our study reveals that proper levels of Il1b signaling and tissue inflammation, which are tuned by macrophages, play a crucial role in tissue regeneration."

The gene produces a signal protein and this prolonged activity causes the primed regenerative cells to die. However, the cells can survive if <i>interleukin 1b</i> activity is quickly suppressed by macrophages.

The\u00a0zebrafish is a powerful model species\u00a0for investigation\u00a0of regeneration mechanisms because it exhibits high regenerative capacity. Zebrafish can regenerate complex structures such as fins, heart, brain, retina, and other tissues (<a href=\"#bib7\">Gemberling et al., 2013</a>). The caudal fin of zebrafish, in particular, has been used as a model for analyzing epimorphic regeneration, a type of regeneration in the urodele limb and fish fin (<a href=\"#bib39\">Poss et al., 2003</a>). During epimorphic regeneration, two characteristic tissues, the wound epidermis and the blastema, are induced in response to tissue amputation, and their coordinated actions regulate cell proliferation and morphogenesis and thus lead to tissue regeneration. Studies conducted using the caudal fin regeneration model have identified numerous genes and molecular signaling pathways that are critical for fin regeneration (<a href=\"#bib62\">Yoshinari and Kawakami, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Wehner and Weidinger, 2015</a>)."

Our analyses of the <i>clo</i> mutant revealed that a diffusible survival factor from myeloid-lineage cells is required to prevent apoptosis of the primed regenerative cells.

Furthermore, Petrie and coworkers (<a href=\"#bib38\">Petrie et al., 2014</a>) showed that genetic ablation of macrophages in adult zebrafish impaired fin outgrowth and often induced an abnormal fin. These studies suggest a crucial role for macrophages in tissue regeneration; however, the mechanism by which myeloid cells affect regeneration remains to be elucidated."

Moreover, although myeloid cells are widely regarded as the main cells that secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines such as Il1b and thereby promote inflammation, we demonstrate that epidermal cells surrounding the amputated tissue are the source of Il1b in both wild-type (WT) and <i>clo</i> larvae. Notably, <i>il1b</i> expression in the regenerating epidermis is usually quenched by the action of macrophages, and a lack of this anti-inflammatory effect of the macrophages results\u00a0in apoptosis. Lastly, we show that Il1b signaling plays an indispensable role in normal tissue regeneration by activating expression of regeneration-induced genes. Thus, our study highlights the function of Il1b and the inflammatory response in tissue regeneration. A proper level of <i>il1b</i> expression and the inflammatory response, which are tuned by macrophages, are necessary for progression of tissue regeneration."

Thus, myeloid cells are considered to trigger inflammation by providing pro-inflammatory cytokines. Here, we demonstrated that the pro-inflammatory cytokine Il1b is provided by epidermal cells in response to tissue injury. We showed that apoptosis occurred if the Il1b action at the injury site was prolonged, and that macrophages were responsible for attenuation of <i>il1b</i> expression and resolution of inflammation. Furthermore, our data suggest that normal <i>il1b</i> expression and inflammatory response are necessary in tissue regeneration to\u00a0activate expression of regeneration-induced genes.

Total RNAs from approximately 500 posterior tissue samples were extracted using TRIzol (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. RNA sequencing analysis was performed by Dragon Genomics (Kyoto, Japan). Briefly, purified and fragmented PolyA<sup>+</sup> RNAs were prepared from 3 \u03bcg each of the total RNAs using the TruSeq RNA sample preparation kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA), and the respective cDNAs were synthesized according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The cDNAs fused with an adaptor on both ends were PCR-amplified (15 cycles) and used for sequencing analysis (Illumina HiSeq2000). The obtained sequence reads (60927373 reads for WT uncut, 59284653 reads for amputated WT at 6 hpa, 58507894 reads for amputated <i>clo</i> mutant at 6 hpa) were aligned to the zebrafish reference sequence using Bowtie software (version 0.12.7; RRID:<a href=\"https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_005476\">SCR_005476</a>) (<a href=\"#bib26\">Langmead et al., 2009</a>). The normalized expression level of the respective genes, RPKM (reads per kilobase of exon model per million mapped reads), was calculated using ERANGE software (version 3.2; RRID:<a href=\"https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_005240\">SCR_005240</a>) (<a href=\"#bib33\">Mortazavi et al., 2008</a>)."

Apoptosis was examined using an in situ apoptosis detection kit (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). Briefly, samples were rehydrated with PBTx, treated with 10 \u03bcg/ml Proteinase K in PBTx (5 min, RT), washed with PBTx, and refixed with 4% PFA in PBS (20 min). The samples were further incubated (15 min, on ice) in a freshly prepared 0.1% sodium citrate buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100, washed with PBTx, and reacted with the TUNEL reaction mixture at 37\u00b0C for 1.5 hr. The reaction was terminated by washing with PBTx. The samples were mounted in 80% glycerol and fluorescence images were acquired using confocal microscopy. The TUNEL-positive cells were quantified by counting the number of cells in the area posterior to the notochords."

According to the reviewer\u2019s suggestion, we further examined temporal changes of neutrophil and macrophage accumulation, respectively, in the injured fin fold. We observed that both of neutrophil and macrophage increased until 3 hpa, reached at a maximum number between 3-6 hpa in the vicinity of <i>il1b</i>-expressing site, and then decreased thereafter. The timing coincides with the stage when the initial <i>il1b</i> expression in WT was downregulated, suggesting a possibility that myeloid cell migration could play a role for attenuating <i>il1b</i> expression. However, we cannot conclude that it is necessary for attenuating <i>il1b</i> expression.
