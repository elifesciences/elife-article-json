Several studies have suggested that optical stimulation provides the precision and dynamic range requisite for closed-loop neuronal control, but no approach yet permits feedback control of neuronal firing. Here we present the \u2018optoclamp\u2019, a feedback control technology that provides continuous, real-time adjustments of bidirectional optical stimulation in order to lock spiking activity at specified targets over timescales ranging from seconds to days. We demonstrate how this system can be used to decouple neuronal firing levels from ongoing changes in network excitability due to multi-hour periods of glutamatergic or GABAergic neurotransmission blockade in vitro as well as impinging vibrissal sensory drive in vivo. This technology enables continuous, precise optical control of firing in neuronal populations in order to disentangle causally related variables of circuit activation in a physiologically and ethologically relevant manner."

Several studies have suggested that optical stimulation provides the precision and dynamic range requisite for closed-loop neuronal control, but no approach yet permits feedback control of neuronal firing. Here we present the \u2018optoclamp\u2019, a feedback control technology that provides continuous, real-time adjustments of bidirectional optical stimulation in order to lock spiking activity at specified targets over timescales ranging from seconds to days. We demonstrate how this system can be used to decouple neuronal firing levels from ongoing changes in network excitability due to multi-hour periods of glutamatergic or GABAergic neurotransmission blockade in vitro as well as impinging vibrissal sensory drive in vivo. This technology enables continuous, precise optical control of firing in neuronal populations in order to disentangle causally related variables of circuit activation in a physiologically and ethologically relevant manner."

It can be used to restore and maintain the baseline level of neuron activity in the presence of drugs that would otherwise produce large increases or decreases in the firing of neurons.

Recently, a diverse set of specialized techniques that employ elements of feedback control have emerged for studying adaptation in neuronal micro-circuits (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ahrens et al., 2012</a>), using electrical stimulation to control spike latency (<a href=\"#bib52\">Wallach et al., 2011</a>) and firing levels (<a href=\"#bib50\">Wagenaar et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Newman et al., 2013</a>), improving brain-computer interfaces (<a href=\"#bib49\">Velliste et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Cunningham et al., 2011</a>), inducing motor plasticity (<a href=\"#bib20\">Jackson et al., 2006</a>), and controlling intracellular firing rate (<a href=\"#bib28\">Miranda-Dom\u00ednguez et al., 2010</a>). True feedback control has been most broadly applied in neuroscience research using the voltage clamp, which is used to decouple the membrane potential from causally related voltage-dependent conductances. This approach has provided the foundation for our understanding intracellular electrochemical signaling and demands extension to other features of neural activity."

Changes in thalamic firing tone can alter cortical receptive fields (<a href=\"#bib45\">Stoelzel et al., 2009</a>) and the nature of temporal coding within the thalamocortical pathways (<a href=\"#bib53\">Wang et al., 2010</a>). Long-term changes in network firing levels can trigger a multitude of homeostatic processes that regulate circuit excitability and stability (<a href=\"#bib47\">Turrigiano et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Corner et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Turrigiano, 2011</a>). A system analogous to the voltage clamp, but capable of precise, bidirectional control of circuit firing levels could be used to identify the independent role of firing rate in downstream processes in spite of changes to causally-related variables. For instance, long-term changes in population firing have long been thought to initiate compensatory homeostatic mechanisms, but a causal link has remained elusive. Direct bidirectional control over population firing rates would allow us to test this hypothesis directly. Optogenetic tools are routinely used to provide genetically specified, millisecond time-scale stimulation or suppression of neural activity with light (<a href=\"#bib25\">Mattis et al., 2011</a>) during simultaneous, artifact-free electrical recording. The ability to simultaneously perturb and measure neural activity form the basic elements of a feedback loop, which can be exploited to control firing. Although several studies have presented closed-loop optogenetic stimulation techniques (<a href=\"#bib24\">Leifer et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Stirman et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Paz et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Krook-Magnuson et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">O'Connor et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Siegle and Wilson, 2014</a>), no approach yet permits feedback control of neuronal firing levels."

We show that the optoclamp allows precise control of population firing levels in dissociated cortical networks over timescales ranging from seconds to days. We characterize the effects of different control schemes, algorithm parameters, and optical waveforms on the precision of feedback control and higher-order statistics of population activity. We show that firing rate control can be achieved over many hours and used to restore pre-drug firing levels during chronic blockade of excitatory or inhibitory synaptic transmission. Using this approach, we decouple the effects of suppressed neurotransmission from the indirect effects on network firing, and find that changes in firing levels are not required to induce homeostatic alterations in network excitability. Finally, we show how optogenetic feedback can be used to control firing activity in vibrissal somatosensory thalamus of rats. We find that background thalamic activity levels can be controlled during ongoing sensory input without corrupting the fine-scale temporal structure of whisker-evoked spike trains. Together, our results demonstrate that the optoclamp is an effective general tool for decoupling neural firing from other variables that would normally affect network excitability."

This variability likely reflects heterogeneous network excitability, opsin expression, synaptic connectivity, and developmental processes (<a href=\"#bib51\">Wagenaar et al., 2006</a>) and suggests that the controller continuously adapts to ongoing changes in network excitability in order to precisely clamp firing levels. To test this possibility, we delivered open-loop replay of successful closed-loop control signals and found they were incapable of controlling firing (Figure 4, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> cultures). This demonstrates the necessity of real-time feedback to achieve precise control of neural firing, even for same target rate within single preparations."

Control performance was equivalent to the drug-free case and control failure was isolated to high target rates (9\u201310 Hz/unit) due to stimulus saturation (<a href=\"#fig2s6\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 6B\u2013E</a>). We also tested PI control during blockade of GABAergic transmission and found that reliable control was not possible (<a href=\"#fig2s6\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 6</a>). This is likely due to the destabilizing effects of bicuculline, which caused the controller to oscillate. This result is consistent with studies indicating a general role of reduced inhibition in diseases of circuit instability such as temporal lobe epilepsy (<a href=\"#bib22\">Kobayashi and Buckmaster, 2003</a>) and Dravet syndrome (<a href=\"#bib9\">Dutton et al., 2013</a>)."

During each 5-min step, the controller made rapid, second-to-second adjustments in stimulus intensity to maintain the instantaneous target rate, while slower changes in stimulus intensity occurred over minutes. Minute-to-minute changes in the control signal intensity likely reflect short-term synaptic depression and changes in cellular excitability that accrued over each control epoch. Therefore, the control signal can be used as a readout of network excitability, analogous to how injected current from a voltage clamp amplifier can be used to asses cellular excitability."

Each permitted successful closed-loop control, but notably, the choice of stimulus waveform significantly affected the peak firing correlation (<i>P</i> = 6.5 \u00d7 10<sup>\u221224</sup>) and synchrony (<i>P</i> = 10<sup>\u221222</sup>) of the population response (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). The square pulse trains typically used for ChR2-based stimulation (<a href=\"#bib25\">Mattis et al., 2011</a>) resulted in periodic, highly correlated population firing (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Compared to square pulses, sinusoidal stimuli decreased peak unit-to-unit firing correlations (\u221210.6%, p = 0.028), but did not affect synchrony. PRBS stimuli reduced peak correlations (\u221224.0%, p = 6.8 \u00d7 10<sup>\u221213</sup>) and firing synchrony (\u221217.9%, p = 4.6 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22128</sup>). Continuous light modulation increased both correlations (+21.3%, p = 4.3 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22125</sup>) and synchrony (+41.4%, p = 2.5 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22129</sup>). Triangular pulses did not affect correlation or synchrony. Importantly, while periodic input signals produced a periodic response, PBRS input and continuous intensity modulation resulted in non-periodic firing. Therefore, altering the temporal characteristics of excitatory stimulus waveforms resulted in remarkably different higher-order firing statistics while still enabling successful PI control. This emphasizes the fact that, in its current form, the optoclamp only controls population firing levels and leaves more complex features of neural activity unconstrained and subject to the influence of network connectivity, network dynamics, and the nature of the stimulus signal."

Indeed, we found that linear increases in optical intensity resulted in extremely variable and temporally non-stationary firing over trials and units (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Further, we examined whether successful control could be achieved by locking the stimulator at a static optical power once the controller stabilized. Halfway through each 30-s trial we locked the light signal either at the last output taken by the controller or the average control signal during first half of the trial (6 TCUs; <a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

Increasing <i>\u03c4</i> (from 0.8 to 1.6 s) introduced lag into the control loop, causing overshoot, decreased stability, and a significant increase in RMS tracking error (+57%, p = 1.4 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22126</sup>). Conversely, lowering <i>\u03c4</i> (from 0.8 to 0.16 s) decreased overshoot and significantly reduced RMS tracking error (\u221246.9%, p = 1.2 \u00d7 10<sup>\u221210</sup>). Increasing T<sub><i>i</i></sub> (from 1 to 10 s) did not significantly affect RMS tracking error (p = 0.088), but caused over-damping and increased controller settling time. Reducing T<sub><i>i</i></sub> (from 1 to 0.1 s) significantly decreased RMS tracking error (\u221218%, p = 0.011) and introduced overshoot during control onset. Together, these results indicate that low-latency feedback and a short integral time constant improve the performance of firing rate control in vivo. In this experiment, <i>\u03c4</i> = 0.16 s and T<sub>i</sub> = 1 s gave the best performance in terms of RMS error."

To characterize the timescales over which the optical controller and whisker stimuli affected firing, we calculated the spike-triggered average (STA) of optical power and whisker position (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E,F</a>). During concurrent whisker stimulation and closed-loop control, the full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the STA for optical power and whisker position differed by more than an order of magnitude, indicating that sensory input and optical control signals affected firing on distinct timescales (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8G</a>; mean \u00b1 SD FWHM of STA: optical power, 0.46 \u00b1 0.2 s vs whisker position, 18.3 \u00b1 5.5 ms, p = 0.0079). Therefore, optogenetic feedback control using continuously modulated input provides a means to control baseline firing state without distorting the fine-scale temporal structure of sensory-evoked spike trains. Punctate vibrissa stimuli rearrange spike times instead of introducing additional spikes, allowing the temporal correlations in the firing rate to dictate the downstream response rather than the magnitude of the firing rate. This effect is reminiscent of firing modulation by free air whisking in vibrissa primary sensory cortex (<a href=\"#bib8\">Curtis and Kleinfeld, 2009</a>) and contrasts the effect of pulsed optogenetic stimulation, which transiently overrides the influence of sensory input on the temporal structure of spike trains."

In contrast, the optoclamp continuously updates stimulus intensity and frequency in real-time to enable precise control of neural firing in cultured networks and single cells in vivo and therefore provides a foundation for techniques aiming to achieved true closed-loop optical control of neural activity (<a href=\"#bib16\">Grosenick et al., 2015</a>). We have shown that this form of optogenetic feedback control is capable of clamping network firing rates using different stimulation protocols (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>) and control algorithms (<a href=\"#equ4\">Equations 4, 12, 13, 14</a>) over a wide range of controller parameters (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a> through <a href=\"#fig2s5\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 5</a>, <a href=\"#fig7s3\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 3</a>) and timescales (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> vs <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> through <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>).

Finally, we found that even when using the same controller and target firing rate, successful control often required vastly different intensities of optical stimulation across experiments and experimental preperations (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>).

First, by continuously servoing the current injected into a cell in order to maintain a target membrane potential, the injected current mirrors underlying synaptic or intrinsic conductances that are difficult to measure directly. Second, because the voltage clamp can precisely control the membrane potential, it can decouple strong causal relationships that exist between the membrane voltage and other variables. For example, measuring the open-loop relationship between the membrane voltage and voltage-dependent conductances is impossible in the unclamped cell since these variables feed back onto one another. The voltage clamp breaks this circular dependence in order to systematically examine the strength of conductances at fixed voltage levels."

For instance, population-level excitability in an unclamped network must be inferred through measures of firing activity, which in turn affects network excitability. By continuously updating the intensity of optical stimulation to clamp network firing at set levels, information about network excitability and afferent input can be read directly from optical control signals (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). One shortcoming of this feature is that it is difficult to identify the origin of changes in network excitability that appear in optical control signals since they result from the aggregate effect of many different processes. However, parallel limitations also exist for the voltage clamp. For example, when using voltage clamp, it can be difficult to distinguish contributions from different neurotransmitter systems and intrinsic conductances or to deduce the relationship between synaptic currents measured at the recording site vs at the site of receptor binding. Another issue with both optical clamping and the voltage clamp is that the control signal can be contaminated by non-ideal aspects of the recording or stimulation setup. For instance, opsin desensitization could affect the intensity of light required for the optoclamp to maintain firing levels. Likewise, space clamp and seal stability issues that arise during voltage clamp influence the amount of current required to hold a target membrane potential."

Different neural circuits have distinct population-level dynamics, connectivity, neurotransmitter systems, cellular constituents, and opsin expression properties. Therefore, analogous to the voltage clamp, the optoclamp should be used in combination with auxiliary techniques that can compensate for imperfections in the control system and allow the mechanistic underpinnings of changes in excitability that occur during clamping to be isolated. For instance, the effects of opsin desensitization and bandwidth can be factored out of optical control signals such that the control signals accurately reflect changes in network excitability during clamping (<a href=\"#bib46\">Tchumatchenko et al., 2013</a>). Further, the optoclamp can be combined with existing pharmacological, genetic, or electrophysiological tools to isolate specific mechanisms that influence network excitability following clamping (<a href=\"#bib12\">Fong et al., 2015</a>)."

Using two case studies, operating on very different time-scales, we have demonstrated that the optoclamp is capable of decoupling thalamocortical cell baseline state from fine-scale sensory-evoked firing patterns in vivo (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>) and decoupling network firing levels from various forms of neurotransmission (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). The former is especially relevant given recent focus on the state-dependent nature of thalamic coding (<a href=\"#bib17\">Halassa et al., 2014</a>), and the need for stimulation technologies capable of controlling non-stationary neural dynamics in order to inject meaningful sensory information into damaged circuits (<a href=\"#bib42\">Stanley, 2013</a>). Decoupling firing levels from variables to which they are normally causally intertwined can also help clarify causal relationships between firing and other factors that influence network excitability. For instance, determining the independent roles of neurotransmission and spiking on various forms of plasticity has proven challenging since manipulation of neurotransmission invariably affects spiking levels, and vice versa. To overcome this, Fong et al. recently used the optoclamp to decouple network firing levels from long-term AMPAergic neurotransmission blockade to show that upward synaptic scaling is directly triggered by reduced AMPAergic transmission without relying on changes in spiking activity (<a href=\"#bib12\">Fong et al., 2015</a>). This provides a plasticity mechanism to explain the increases in network firing levels we witnessed following long-term CNQX treatment even when firing was clamped to pre-drug levels for the duration of drug application (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>)."

Our implementations of the optoclamp are quite reliable for controlling neural activity in cultured networks and thalamic cells in vivo and the technique's simplicity lowers the barrier for its adoption. However, there are several avenues for further development of the method we have presented. For instance, we used a pre-sorting procedure to identify neurons used for real-time firing rate estimation in subsequent clamping periods. During periods of optical stimulation, neurons that were silent during the pre-sorting routine may be activated. If these cells had systematically different firing characteristics the sorted units used for firing rate estimation, then our procedure would lead to a biased estimate of network firing levels. Although we found no evidence that this was the case in our networks, the situation might differ for other neural preparations or brain regions. If this issue were to arise, spike sorting could be removed entirely and firing could be normalized by the number of recording channels, provided that the channel count is sufficiently high."

For example, the incorporation of spatial light modulation would allow optical inputs to be steered towards the spike initiation zones of individual cells in order to minimize light exposure (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>) and abnormal conductances, and potentially enable complex system identification alogrithms to be introduced into the feedback loop (<a href=\"#bib16\">Grosenick et al., 2015</a>). Additionally, decreased feedback latency or the addition of predictive elements to the feedback loop may enable control over rapid sensory or motor events. There are two options to obtain accurate firing rate measures over very short timescales (e.g., that of individual whisker perturbations). The first option is to sample a very large population of neurons such that small time bins will have an adequate number of spikes for accurate estimation of population firing levels. This large population measure would need to be combined with a sub-millisecond feedback loop and opsins with extremely fast kinetics. Alternatively, if an accurate model of feedforward network dynamics could be incorporated into the controller, reliable control over fast events might be possible with a modestly sized population of cells, a slower feedback loop, and standard opsin variants. This is a viable approach in circuits for which predictive models of feedforward network dynamics are available, such as early visual, auditory, and vibrissal pathways (<a href=\"#bib54\">Wu et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Millard et al., 2013</a>), or, for which accurate input/output relationships can be deduced in situ using real-time system identification (<a href=\"#bib16\">Grosenick et al., 2015</a>). Additionally, control algorithms that incorporate models of feed-forward neural dynamics will be more capable of stabilizing firing in unstable circuits, such as epileptic networks, without total cessation of ongoing activity."

However, in the optoclamp's current form, higher-order temporal characteristics, such as the unit-to-unit firing correlation, are not actively controlled features of neural activity. Therefore, during clamping periods, these features of population firing will be dependent on network architecture, the identity and percentage the cells expressing opsins, and opsin dynamics. Improvements on our technique might treat higher order features of network activity, such as unit-to-unit correlation and synchrony, as secondary control targets. In this case, the controller would use real-time measures of higher order firing statistics to adjust the spatial and temporal characteristics of optical stimuli in order to enforce a particular firing structure, such as the heterogeneity of activity levels across cells and/or temporal variance of firing activity (e.g., regular firing vs bursting). Optogenetic feedback control could also be incorporated into more complex experimental contexts. For example, firing rate control could be made contingent on specific behaviors or complex spatiotemporal activity patterns associated with specific behaviors (<a href=\"#bib55\">Zhang et al., 1998</a>), in order to introduce fictive reward or neuromodulatory signals to influence learning or alleviate pathological activity. In particular, optoclamping cortical activity to replace lost neuromodulatory tone is a potentially exciting future avenue for treating Parkinson's disease (<a href=\"#bib2\">Beuter et al., 2014</a>)."

If combined with real-time control, these techniques could offer the ability to optically clamp activity levels in specified subnetworks with far greater specificity than is afforded using electrodes. Perhaps most exciting, recent improvements in microbial rhodopsins for simultaneous voltage indication and optogenetic stimulation provide a means for all-optical measurement and perturbation of the membrane voltage at subcellular resolution and millisecond timescales (<a href=\"#bib11\">Flytzanis et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Hochbaum et al., 2014</a>). These tools even allow simultaneous sensing and actuation using a single opsin. Using opsins to both measure and actuate voltage within a feedback control loop will open the possibility of voltage clamping arbitrary populations of cells without puncturing their cell bodies. This would enable an unprecedented improvement of fine-scale control and measurement of neural circuit activation in vitro and, with specialized optics, in vivo."

The functionality of our technique across control parameters, algorithms, preparations, and firing rate measures (network vs single units) indicates the robustness and general applicability of the technique to different experimental contexts. When combined with secondary genetic, pharmacological, or behavioral manipulations and tailored to particular experimental contexts using suitable control algorithms, we envision the use of optogenetic feedback control in a multitude of experimental and clinical contexts requiring precise control of neuronal activity. For these reasons, we believe that the optoclamp is a powerful addition to the expanding optogenetic toolbox and will improve and accelerate the study of neural control of motor action, sensory encoding and adaptation, neuromodulation, and activity homeostasis."

Throughout the experiment, measurements of the heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and response to toe pinch stimuli were used to monitor and titrate the depth of anesthesia. Body temperature was maintained at 37\u00b0C by a servo-controlled heating blanket (FHC, Bowdoinham, ME).

The microelectrodes had an impedance of 1\u20132 M\u03a9 at 1 kHz. The optical fiber was ground to a fine point, producing a spherical, rather than conical, pattern of light delivery. The optrode was advanced to the ventral posterio-medial (VPm) region of the thalamus using a precision microdrive (Knopf Instruments, Tujunga, CA). Single and multi-unit activity were band-pass filtered between 300 and 5000 Hz and digitized at 24.414 kHz using an RZ2 multichannel bioacquisition system (Tucker Davis Technologies, Alachua, FL). The principal vibrissa was determined by manually deflecting individual whiskers and observing resultant multi-unit activity."

The problem with this approach is that the resonance behavior of neurons is highly diverse and depends on the intrinsic membrane properties. Thus, any interpretations on the population behavior will depend on the nature of the cells expressing ChR2 and the percent of the contributing neuron types expressing CR2. Thus, the mentioned 'systematic modulation' of neuronal networks at the end of the subsection headed \u201cProportional-integral control of network firing\u201d is very much dependent on various factors such as cell types, percent of neuron types expressing Chr2, brain area under investigation. This should be discussed in the manuscript."

They use eNpHR3.0 to balance the lack of inhibition and ChR2 to counteract the lack of excitation in vitro and in vivo. With this method, the authors approximate the input to the neuronal population by the power of the yellow light minus the power of the blue light. Since the study controls for the neuronal firing, the clamp can be used to cancel slow components for several seconds. This was used to keep the neuronal firing rate constant in order to show that the synaptic homeostasis is not dependent on neuronal firing rate. This is a nice application of the method. Overall the paper is well written and the figures are clear. What is missing is a discussion and data about how this method differs from classic patch clamp and how one can deal with the differences. The patch clamp is an important reference since it is relatively easy to understand its advantages and disadvantages."

First, the advantage with single cell patch clamp is that there is a minimal impact on the remaining network since only one cell is modified. Here a whole population is modulated. Therefore a crucial question is how this modulation spreads through the network, how this spread changes the processing, and how this spread even will change the input that should be measured in the first place. Second, the main output of the classic voltage clamping is the amount of current that is required to compensate for various currents into a neuron. It is important that the compensation is complete, otherwise the injected current cannot be interpreted easily. This requires the regulator to be very fast. This is relatively easy with the membrane potential and currents for a patched cell, but not for a population of heterogeneously firing cells. It would be even more difficult to control for the firing of an individual neuron. This might explain why the controller needs some time to accumulate the spikes (tau=0.16s). This will unfortunately not be fast enough to follow the very fast transients caused by vibrissa stimulation (see <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). Since the control feedback speed probably depends on the temporal resolution of the neuronal signal, it would be interesting to study what happens when the temporal resolution is increased by taking more and more neurons into account. In this case it may be possible to decrease the time constant such that fast network dynamics can be studied."

With this method, the authors approximate the input to the neuronal population by the power of the yellow light minus the power of the blue light. Since the study controls for the neuronal firing, the clamp can be used to cancel slow components for several seconds. This was used to keep the neuronal firing rate constant in order to show that the synaptic homeostasis is not dependent on neuronal firing rate. This is a nice application of the method. Overall the paper is well written and the figures are clear. What is missing is a discussion and data about how this method differs from classic patch clamp and how one can deal with the differences.
