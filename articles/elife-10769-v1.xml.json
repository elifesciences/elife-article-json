Here, we survey mtDNA copy number variation across 22 tumor types profiled by The Cancer Genome Atlas project. We observe a tendency for some cancers, especially of the bladder, breast, and kidney, to be depleted of mtDNA, relative to matched normal tissue. Analysis of genetic context reveals an association between incidence of several somatic alterations, including IDH1 mutations in gliomas, and mtDNA content. In some but not all cancer types, mtDNA content is correlated with the expression of respiratory genes, and anti-correlated to the expression of immune response and cell-cycle genes. In tandem with immunohistochemical evidence, we find that some tumors may compensate for mtDNA depletion to sustain levels of respiratory proteins. Our results highlight the extent of mtDNA copy number variation in tumors and point to related therapeutic opportunities."

Here, we survey mtDNA copy number variation across 22 tumor types profiled by The Cancer Genome Atlas project. We observe a tendency for some cancers, especially of the bladder, breast, and kidney, to be depleted of mtDNA, relative to matched normal tissue. Analysis of genetic context reveals an association between incidence of several somatic alterations, including IDH1 mutations in gliomas, and mtDNA content. In some but not all cancer types, mtDNA content is correlated with the expression of respiratory genes, and anti-correlated to the expression of immune response and cell-cycle genes. In tandem with immunohistochemical evidence, we find that some tumors may compensate for mtDNA depletion to sustain levels of respiratory proteins. Our results highlight the extent of mtDNA copy number variation in tumors and point to related therapeutic opportunities."

Reznik et al. used next-generation DNA sequencing data produced by The Cancer Genome Atlas consortium to estimate the number of copies of mitochondrial DNA in tumor cells and the adjacent normal tissue. This revealed that in many types of cancer, tumor cells have fewer copies of mitochondrial DNA than the cells that make up normal tissue. In many cases, the depletion of mitochondrial DNA was accompanied by a reduction of the expression of mitochondrial genes, suggesting that mitochondrial activity may be suppressed in these tumor types."

However, the contribution of changes in the gross number of mtDNA genomes in a tumor (i.e. the \u2018mtDNA copy number\u2019) to tumor development and progression has not been adequately investigated."

Because mitochondria undergo a constant process of fusion and fission, it is difficult to meaningfully determine the number of mtDNA molecules per mitochondrion. Instead, studies have focused on measuring mtDNA copy number per cell, with estimates for\u00a0humans\u00a0that vary between a few hundred and over one hundred thousand copies, depending on the tissue under examination (<a href=\"#bib48\">Wai et al., 2010</a>). Furthermore, because mtDNA serves as a template for the transcription of essential electron transport chain complexes, the quantity of mtDNA in a cell may serve a surrogate marker for the cell\u2019s capacity to conduct oxidative phosphorylation if the copy number of mtDNA is rate-limiting. For instance, a recent study estimated that energy-intensive tissues such as cardiac and skeletal muscle contained between 4000 and 6000 copies of mtDNA per cell, while liver, kidney, and lung tissues averaged between 500 and 2000 copies (<a href=\"#bib11\">D'Erchia et al., 2015</a>)."

First, the normal functions of mitochondria (e.g. respiration) may be subverted to support the growth of the tumor. A canonical example of this is the observation that many tumors suppress mitochondrial respiration in favor of increased uptake of glucose and secretion of lactate (\u2018the Warburg effect\u2019), a phenomenon which has found clinical utility for imaging of tumors using FDG-PET (<a href=\"#bib47\">Vander Heiden et al., 2009</a>). Second, mitochondria are susceptible to mutations in nuclear- and mitochondrially-encoded genes, and a subset of tumors are known to be caused by mutations of the mitochondrial enzymes FH, SDH, and IDH (<a href=\"#bib24\">King et al., 2006</a>). Furthermore, mtDNA dysfunction affecting the electron transport chain can lead to generation of excess reactive oxygen species (ROS), contributing to tumor cell metastasis (<a href=\"#bib20\">Ishikawa et al., 2008</a>)."

Large-scale studies of mtDNA in cancer have instead focused on the analysis of mutations and heteroplasmy, largely ignoring the contribution of mtDNA copy number variation to the development and progression of tumors. Here, we use whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing data to examine changes in mtDNA copy number across a panel of cancer types profiled by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) consortium. Using the resulting mtDNA copy number estimates, we ask fundamental questions about mtDNA and cancer. We investigate whether evidence of the Warburg effect can be found in patterns of mtDNA accumulation or depletion. We further examine the connection between gene expression levels and mtDNA copy number, and identify a subset of mitochondrially-localized metabolic pathways exhibiting a high degree of co-expression with mtDNA levels. Finally, we ask whether gross variations of mtDNA copy number are linked to the incidence of somatic alterations (including mutations and copy number alterations) across cancer types. Altogether, our results shed light on the contribution of aberrant mitochondrial function, through changes in mtDNA content, to cancer."

Comparable approaches have been used to estimate somatic copy number alterations within the nuclear genome in cancer [for a review, see <a href=\"#bib59\">Zhao et al. (2013)</a>]. The approach assumes that regions of the genome of equal ploidy should be sequenced to comparable depth. In a normal human cell, the autosomal nuclear genome is at a fixed (diploid) copy number. Thus, by calculating the ratio of reads aligning to the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes, respectively, it is possible to estimate mtDNA ploidy relative to a diploid standard.

To validate estimates of mtDNA copy number, we compared estimates from samples submitted to both WXS and WGS. Although mitochondrial reads are abundant in both WGS and WXS, the two sequencing methods capture mtDNA at different efficiencies: exome sequencing involves the targeted enrichment of exonic regions prior to sequencing and does not target mtDNA (<a href=\"#bib37\">Samuels et al., 2013</a>), while WGS sequences cellular DNA in an unbiased manner. If our approach to estimating mtDNA copy number is accurate, then we expect that the two sequencing platforms should offer comparable estimates of mtDNA copy number across a panel of samples,\u00a0i.e., samples with high mtDNA copy number in WGS should have similarly high mtDNA copy number in WXS. We compared mtDNA copy number estimates in 1110 samples across 8 tumor types profiled by both WXS and WGS, controlling for sequencing center and TCGA plate ID. We confirmed that across all combinations of cancer types and sequencing centers, WXS and WGS offer significantly correlated estimates of mtDNA copy number (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

Although our computational method is unable to deconvolve sequencing traces arising from tumor cells vs. infiltrate, we nevertheless investigated the statistical association between tumor mtDNA content and stromal/immune infiltration. We obtained estimates of stromal and immune cell infiltration based on gene expression data for eight tumor types calculated using the ESTIMATE algorithm (<a href=\"#bib57\">Yoshihara et al., 2013</a>). We correlated these values with estimates of mtDNA copy number, with full results reported in <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplements 2</a>\u2013<a href=\"#fig3s6\">6</a>, with p-values reported as uncorrected for multiple hypothesis testing.

In total, five cancer types showed statistically significant association between patient survival and mtDNA content. In three cancer types (adrenocortical\u00a0carcinoma, p-value 0.026; chromophobe renal cell carcinoma, p-value 0.053; and low-grade\u00a0glioma, p-value 0.009), high tumor mtDNA content was associated with better survival. The opposite trend, of poor survival in patients with high tumor mtDNA, was observed in clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (p-value 0.023) and melanoma (p-value 0.043). The finding regarding KICH is particularly intriguing given the central role mitochondrial dysfunction has been proposed to play in the disease (<a href=\"#bib7\">Davis et al., 2014</a>). That mtDNA copy number correlates with better or worse survival, depending on cancer type, suggests that other confounding factors strongly tied to survival, such as the presence of somatic mutations, may influence mtDNA levels. In a later section, we will investigate this hypothesis."

Several of these gene sets, including those related to mRNA processing and the cell cycle, are associated with known non-metabolic functions of mitochondria in the cell. In particular, the replication of mitochondria and mtDNA is intimately linked to the cell cycle (<a href=\"#bib4\">Chatre and Ricchetti, 2013</a>), and the nucleotide precursors to mtDNA are in part produced de novo, via a pathway that is only active during the S phase of the cell cycle (<a href=\"#bib41\">Sigoillot et al., 2003</a>). Several immune pathways, including those related to interferon signaling, are also frequently negatively correlated with mtDNA content. This is interesting in light of the role that mitochondria play in innate immunity (<a href=\"#bib53\">West et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Weinberg et al., 2015</a>). Of particular interest is a recent report by West and colleagues (<a href=\"#bib54\">West et al., 2015</a>), demonstrating that mtDNA stress induced by depletion of TFAM triggered the innate immune response via interferon-stimulated genes and anti-viral signaling. Of the seven tumor types shown to be depleted of mtDNA in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, five (BLCA, BRCA, ESCA, HNSC, KIRC ) exhibit a negative correlation between expression of immune system genes and tumor tissue (but not necessarily normal tissue) mtDNA content."

These results echo a complementary finding by Navis and colleagues (<a href=\"#bib34\">Navis et al., 2013</a>), who reported that a mutant IDH1 R132H oligodendroglioma xenograft model displayed high densities of mitochondria and increased levels of mitochondrial metabolic activity.

Using somatic mtDNA mutation calls provided by the TCGA (<a href=\"#bib7\">Davis et al., 2014</a>), we examined whether mtDNA-mutated samples were likely to have more or fewer mtDNA copies than unmutated samples.

As mentioned earlier, our results from gene expression analysis (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>) indicate that mtDNA copy number is correlated to mitochondrial respiratory gene expression in KIRC and KIRP, but not BLCA. In fact, in BLCA, the gene sets most strongly correlated\u00a0to mtDNA copy number were associated with the cell cycle and immune response. This suggests that other mechanisms compensate for the depletion of mtDNA in BLCA (and potentially in other cancer types), which is further discussed in the concluding section.

For example, oncocytomas (not analyzed in this work) are well-known to be characterized by the excessive accumulation of mitochondria (<a href=\"#bib43\">Tickoo et al., 2000</a>). Furthermore, decreases in mtDNA copy number have been reported in breast cancer (<a href=\"#bib30\">Mambo et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Fan et al., 2009</a>), liver cancer (<a href=\"#bib27\">Lee, 2004</a>), and clear-cell kidney cancers (<a href=\"#bib32\">Meierhofer et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Nilsson et al., 2015</a>). While the majority of our observations agree with prior work (when comparing to [<a href=\"#bib58\">Yu, 2011</a>]), some of our results are in contradiction to prior studies. The discordance between findings seems in part due to inadequate sample sizes, and incomplete or unavailable matched normal tissue. For example, in contrast to (<a href=\"#bib30\">Mambo et al., 2005</a>) and (<a href=\"#bib51\">Wang et al., 2005</a>), we find no clear increase or decrease in mtDNA content in thyroid or endometrial carcinomas, respectively.

The literature contains several reports of mtDNA copy number depletion without reduction in mitochondrial transcription/respiratory activity, both in\u00a0vitro\u00a0and in vivo. In (<a href=\"#bib40\">Seidel-Rogol and Shadel, 2002</a>), HeLa cells depleted of mtDNA by culture in ethidium bromide showed substantial mitochondrial transcription despite the fact that mtDNA, TFAM, and mitochondrial RNA polymerase were all at depleted levels. There, the authors suggest that an excess of TFAM and mitochondrial RNA polymerase prior to\u00a0depletion\u00a0may ensure that, even once depleted, transcription is sustained. Another report examined mtDNA depletion as a result of thymidine kinase 2 deficiency in mice, and observed a down-regulation of the mitochondrial transcriptional terminator MTERF3 in heart tissue. As a result, the expression of mitochondrial transcripts (ND6 and COX1) increased in heart tissue, as did the ratio of the levels of these transcripts to mtDNA levels. The consequence of this transcriptional compensation was that the heart tissue was spared from respiratory deficiency (<a href=\"#bib9\">Dorado et al., 2011</a>). In tandem with our report, these findings emphasize a nuanced connection between mtDNA copy number and respiratory gene expression. We would argue strongly that future studies investigating changes in mtDNA in tumors should quantify mtDNA protein expression in parallel with estimating mtDNA copy number. A number of related open questions remain to be resolved, including what mechanisms determine the incidence and/or extent of compensation to mtDNA depletion, and what the consequences of mtDNA depletion may be when such compensation takes place (e.g. upregulation of the immune response)."

The presence of activating IDH1 mutations (in low grade gliomas) or a large number of copy number alterations (in serous-like endometrial carcinomas) is strongly correlated to high tumor mtDNA content. If these tumors (and others with increased mtDNA content) have an increased dependence on mitochondrial metabolism to proliferate, using mitochondrially-targeted therapies (e.g. metformin) may be a therapeutic opportunity. Similarly, vulnerability to mitochondrially-targeted therapies might arise from disabling passenger mutations in genes required for mtDNA copy number maintenance (e.g. DNA polymerase gamma). Both hypotheses should be amenable to investigation in carefully chosen cell line models of cancer."

Variation of this kind, if it exists, might reflect functional diversity in mitochondrial metabolic activity and signaling in different regions of a tumor. Alternately, it would be of particular interest to trace the time-evolution of mtDNA content in a single patient over the course of treatment. As critical players in immunity, signaling, and metabolism, we suspect that mitochondria will inevitably play a role in the evolution of resistance to therapeutic intervention."

Interestingly, some tumor types which did not show correlation with respiratory genes, now do (e.g.HNSC tumors). Of note, while the anti-correlation between expression of 2 different interferon-related genesets (\u03b1/\u03b2 interferon and total interferon) and mtDNA copy number is still retained, it is no longer in the top-10 most anti-correlated gene sets and does not appear in <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>.

We noted that (<a href=\"#bib1\">1</a>) bladder cancers are depleted of mtDNA content relative to normal tissue both in WXS and WGS (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>), but (<a href=\"#bib2\">2</a>) using gene expression data, levels of mtDNA in bladder tumors are not correlated to expression of respiratory genes (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>).

Two of the three cases showed stronger staining in tumor than in normal, although the magnitude of the effect was relatively small compared to the difference in staining in KIRC. These results suggest that there may be a compensatory effect in bladder cancers, such that respiratory capacity is sustained despite reduced mtDNA copy number. As we describe in the newly added text in third paragraph of the Discussion, a number of other groups have reported similar compensation in other instances mtDNA depletion (in vitro, and in vivo)."
