Yet, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain obscure. Our systems-level analyses identified a duration code that instructs stimulus specific crosstalk between TLR4 activated canonical NF-\u03baB pathway and lymphotoxin-\u03b2 receptor (LT\u03b2R) induced non-canonical NF-\u03baB signaling. Indeed, LT\u03b2R costimulation synergistically enhanced the late RelA/NF-\u03baB response to TLR4 prolonging NF-\u03baB target gene-expressions. Concomitant LT\u03b2R signal targeted TLR4-induced newly synthesized p100, encoded by <i>Nfkb2</i>, for processing into p52 that not only neutralized p100 mediated inhibitions, but potently generated RelA:p52/NF-\u03baB activity in a positive feedback loop. Finally, <i>Nfkb2</i> connected lymphotoxin signal within the intestinal niche in reinforcing epithelial innate inflammatory RelA/NF-\u03baB response to <i>Citrobacter rodentium</i> infection, while <i>Nfkb2<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice succumbed to gut infections owing to stromal defects. In sum, our results suggest that signal integration <i>via</i> the pleiotropic NF-\u03baB system enables tissue microenvironment derived cues in calibrating physiological responses."
