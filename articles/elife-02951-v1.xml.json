We determined the organizational principles governing how dirty fruit flies groom their bodies with sequential movements. Using genetically targeted activation of neural subsets, we drove distinct motor programs that clean individual body parts. This enabled competition experiments revealing that the motor programs are organized into a suppression hierarchy; motor programs that occur first suppress those that occur later. Cleaning one body part reduces the sensory drive to its motor program, which relieves suppression of the next movement, allowing the grooming sequence to progress down the hierarchy. A model featuring independently evoked cleaning movements activated in parallel, but selected serially through hierarchical suppression, was successful in reproducing the grooming sequence. This provides the first example of an innate motor sequence implemented by the prevailing model for generating human action sequences."

We determined the organizational principles governing how dirty fruit flies groom their bodies with sequential movements. Using genetically targeted activation of neural subsets, we drove distinct motor programs that clean individual body parts. This enabled competition experiments revealing that the motor programs are organized into a suppression hierarchy; motor programs that occur first suppress those that occur later. Cleaning one body part reduces the sensory drive to its motor program, which relieves suppression of the next movement, allowing the grooming sequence to progress down the hierarchy. A model featuring independently evoked cleaning movements activated in parallel, but selected serially through hierarchical suppression, was successful in reproducing the grooming sequence. This provides the first example of an innate motor sequence implemented by the prevailing model for generating human action sequences."

Dust-covered flies follow a predictable sequence of cleaning tasks: beginning by using their front legs to clean their eyes, they then clean their antennae and head. This likely helps to protect their sensory organs. Next, they move on to the abdomen, possibly to ensure that dust doesn't interfere with their ability to breathe. Wings and thorax follow last. Periodically, the flies stop to rub their legs together to remove any accumulated dust before resuming the cleaning sequence."

Then Seeds et al. tried to stimulate more than one cleaning behavior at a time; they discovered that wing-cleaning suppressed thorax-cleaning, abdomen-cleaning suppressed both of these, and head-cleaning suppressed all the others. This suggests that a \u2018hierarchy\u2019 exists in the brain that exactly matches the sequence that flies normally follow as they clean their body parts."

One hypothesis suggests that each action in a series triggers performance of the next action (<a href=\"#bib21\">James, 1890</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Adams, 1984</a>). This is one of the earliest views of motor sequencing and is thought to underlie some sequential behaviors, such as bird song (<a href=\"#bib31\">Long et al., 2010</a>). An alternative hypothesis proposes that the premotor units of all actions in a sequence are activated or readied in parallel and then sequentially selected through winner-take-all competition (<a href=\"#bib30\">Lashley, 1951</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Houghton and Hartley, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Bullock, 2004</a>). This model was originally proposed based on human psychology experiments demonstrating a parallel representation of letter typing acts prior to the typing of a word. Electrophysiological evidence in primates is consistent with this parallel model of serial behavior (<a href=\"#bib2\">Averbeck et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Mushiake et al., 2006</a>). However, it has been difficult to causatively confirm the model and determine its underlying action selection mechanisms."

Independent control of each action in a sequence is challenging to achieve in most systems. However, recent tool development in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> permits subdivisions of behavior to be identified and manipulated in freely moving flies by expressing neural activators in subsets of neurons in the brain. This approach has revealed that acute neural activation can trigger specific behaviors and subcomponents of behaviors, such as abdominal bending and courtship song (two subcomponents of the courtship sequence) (<a href=\"#bib8\">Clyne and Miesenb\u00f6ck, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">von Philipsborn et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Flood et al., 2013</a>).

Grooming consists of discrete cleaning movements that occur in predictable sequences; however, the mechanisms that govern transitions between the movements are not known (<a href=\"#bib43\">Szebenyi, 1969</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Fentress and Stilwell, 1973</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Dawkins and Dawkins, 1976</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Sachs, 1988</a>). Local mechanical stimulation of a body part causes fruit flies to perform precisely targeted cleaning sweeps with their front or hind legs towards that body part (<a href=\"#bib44\">Vandervorst and Ghysen, 1980</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Corfas and Dudai, 1989</a>). In contrast, when they are completely coated in dust, flies coordinate a repertoire of cleaning movements to groom their whole bodies (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bentley, 1975</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Phillis et al., 1993</a>). We reasoned that we could exploit the behavior of such dust-coated flies to determine how different grooming actions are prioritized and ordered when they are stimulated at the same time. We show that dust on the body elicits different independently evoked cleaning motor programs for five body parts that progress in series. By genetically targeting different neural subsets, we gain experimental control over each cleaning motor program to demonstrate that they are organized into a suppression hierarchy. We next generate an empirically derived computational model that demonstrates how a suppression hierarchy can mediate the sequential selection of the cleaning motor programs. This work reveals how the organization of <i>Drosophila</i> grooming is well described by a parallel model of serial behavior."

                                "text": "We tested whether flies would prioritize cleaning of specific body parts when they were completely dirty. This was achieved by coating flies in dust, paired with measurements of changing dust distributions on the body surface (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplements 1 and 2</a>) and manual annotation of their cleaning movements (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>; <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). In response to dust on their bodies, flies groomed with a predictable progression of targeted cleaning movements (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D\u2013F</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4B,C</a>). This progression required dust, as undusted flies did not groom in a sequential progression (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4A,C</a>). Dusted flies rapidly cleaned their eyes and then focused on the antennae, demonstrating that they sequentially clean specific regions on the head (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). They next cleaned their posterior body parts in the order from abdomen to wings to thorax. The grooming progression occurred as a sequence in which the probabilities of cleaning different regions of the body gradually changed through time. That is, the progression was not absolutely unidirectional as flies returned to cleaning earlier body parts even though they had already started cleaning later body parts (referred to as return cleaning) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4B</a>, example ethograms). As the flies progressed through the grooming sequence, each bout of body part cleaning featured cyclic transitions between sweeps of the targeted region and rubbing of the legs against each other (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s5\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5</a>; <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). These cyclic bouts of leg rubbing likely occurred when the legs accumulated sufficient dust from sweeping the body, which was then rubbed towards the distal leg parts and removed. Grooming of the entire body did not necessarily proceed as a continuous process. Flies often paused to walk around and then resumed cleaning where they left off or transitioned to other body parts (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>). Thus, flies groom by gradually cleaning different body parts in bouts that are characterized by cyclic transitions between body cleaning sweeps and leg rubbing (shown as a series of transition diagrams in <a href=\"#fig1s6\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 6</a>). The priority order for cleaning the different body parts is: eyes &gt; antennae &gt; abdomen &gt; wings &gt; thorax."

                                "text": "The modularity of grooming is evident from observations that individual cleaning movements can be evoked by locally applied stimuli (<a href=\"#bib44\">Vandervorst and Ghysen, 1980</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Corfas and Dudai, 1989</a>). This led us to ask whether grooming movements are modular enough to be activated independently in the brain. We expressed the temperature-sensitive cation channel dTrpA1 (<i>UAS-dTrpA1</i>) (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hamada et al., 2008</a>) in different enhancer-driven GAL4 expression patterns in the nervous system (<a href=\"#bib22\">Jenett et al., 2012</a>) and screened for grooming phenotypes (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 for details). Using this method to activate neurons targeted by different GAL4 lines, we discovered that grooming movements could indeed be independently activated in the absence of dust. We identified different GAL4 lines that caused exclusive cleaning of each body part, including the head, abdomen, wings, and legs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>; see <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>, <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>, <a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a>, <a href=\"#media5\">Video 5</a>, <a href=\"#media6\">Video 6</a>, <a href=\"#media7\">Video 7</a>, <a href=\"#media8\">Video 8</a>, and <a href=\"#media9\">Video 9</a> for representative videos and more detail regarding the behavioral phenotypes). Some lines we identified drove cleaning of different body subparts such as the antennae, in agreement with our observations that flies precisely target cleaning of different regions of the head (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, R26B12). Although these lines were sufficient for driving highly specific cleaning movements, we did not find evidence that blocking the activity of their targeted neurons could disrupt dust-induced grooming (tested using the neural inhibitors <i>UAS-Shibire</i><sup><i>ts1</i></sup> or <i>UAS-TNT</i>, data not shown). This suggests that the targeted neurons are sufficient but not necessary for driving their respective cleaning movements. All lines tested could activate continuous cleaning of their corresponding body parts for long periods of time (at least 25 min). Thus, grooming can be decomposed into specific motor programs (hereafter referred to as cleaning modules) that can be independently activated by subsets of neurons. Experimental induction of these cleaning modules via GAL4-expressed dTrpA1 allowed us to directly test how they are sequentially executed during the progression of grooming."

Flies (including controls) were warmed to 30\u00b0C to activate the targeted neurons while their cleaning movements were recorded and manually scored (n = 10 flies/GAL4 line; 130 flies total). Ethograms of the scored behaviors are displayed by compressing all mutually exclusive events to a single line per fly. Colors below the movement names correspond to those on the ethograms. White space in each ethogram represents the time flies spent walking or standing in place. The GAL4 lines are grouped into four cleaning movement categories: head, abdomen, thorax and/or wings, and legs. The grid displays increases and decreases from control flies in the fraction of time each line spent performing different cleaning movements. Grid heat map represents the p-values for the comparisons of the different GAL4 lines and control flies (Kruskal\u2013Wallis followed by Mann\u2013Whitney U pairwise tests and Bonferroni correction). Note: R71C07 displays significant increases in both abdominal cleaning and leg rubbing. Although this line is shown in the abdominal cleaning category, it could also be included with leg rubbing. Lines labeled in red are used in experiments shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> and <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>.

Such temporal conflicts between competing behaviors can be resolved if the performance of one behavior suppresses the others, such that only one is selected at a time (<a href=\"#bib11\">Davis, 1979</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Redgrave et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Kupfermann and Weiss, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Kristan, 2008</a>). Building on this concept, we hypothesized that asymmetries in intermodular suppression could underlie biases in the preferred order of execution. Specifically, we hypothesized that a suppression hierarchy between cleaning modules could mediate fly grooming priorities. In this schema, the ability of the cleaning modules to suppress each other forms a hierarchy in which modules \u2018higher\u2019 in the hierarchy are able to suppress \u2018lower\u2019 modules, but not vice-versa. For this hypothesis to account for the fly grooming progression, the order of suppression within the hierarchy would have to match the order of the normal grooming sequence, as schematized (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Thus, in a completely dusted fly, the most hierarchically superior module is able to suppress all the other competing modules, the second highest module can suppress all but the first one, and so on."

For this experiment, we selected lines that could induce a particular cleaning module and lacked additional phenotypes that might confound our grooming-specific interpretations (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, lines labeled in red, <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>, <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>, <a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a>, <a href=\"#media5\">Video 5</a>, <a href=\"#media6\">Video 6</a>, <a href=\"#media7\">Video 7</a>, <a href=\"#media8\">Video 8</a>, and <a href=\"#media9\">Video 9</a>). <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a> illustrates the outcome of these experiments, which matched the prediction of the hierarchical suppression hypothesis (compare <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a> to <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). For example, when a fly carrying a GAL4 driver that activates abdominal cleaning (R24B03) was stimulated in the presence of whole-body dust, it first cleaned the head, then abdomen (just as wild-type flies do), but then persisted in cleaning its abdomen instead of proceeding to its wings and thorax (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2A,D</a>, see R24B03). This demonstrates that abdominal cleaning is below head cleaning but above wing and thoracic cleaning in the suppression hierarchy. In contrast, flies carrying GAL4 drivers that activate head cleaning (R23A07, R40F04, R26B12) failed to remove dust from their posterior body, consistent with the hypothesis that the behavior would suppress posterior cleaning modules (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). GAL4 lines that activated abdominal (R24B03), wing (R53A06), or all posterior cleaning modules (R45G01) showed little impairment in removing dust from their heads (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, see R24B03, R53A06, and R45G01). Like wild-type flies, these GAL4 lines cleaned their heads at the onset of dusting, indicating that the normal progression of cleaning was preserved up to the point where it was blocked (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2A,D,E</a>, see R24B03, R53A06, and R45G01). This demonstrates that the \u2018endogenously\u2019 produced (dust stimulated) head-cleaning module suppressed strong, artificially activated abdominal, wing, and thoracic cleaning. The fact that head cleaning suppresses other movements through both artificial and endogenous activation argues against the possibility that suppression was an artifact of dTrpA1 activation. These results support our hypothesis that the cleaning modules are competing for output via an intermodular suppression that favors those that are hierarchically superior. The full suppression hierarchy of cleaning modules is: eyes &gt; antennae &gt; abdomen &gt; wings &gt; thorax, which mirrors the serial order of grooming observed in dusted flies."

One possible explanation for the observed progression is that each module sequentially triggers the next module in the series, analogous to an activation chain (<a href=\"#bib21\">James, 1890</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Adams, 1984</a>). We tested this possibility using the GAL4 lines to elicit different cleaning modules in the absence of dust to see if activation of one cleaning module would stimulate execution of the next module. We found that activation and subsequent acute deactivation of neurons that controlled a given cleaning module did not directly elicit the next module in the grooming sequence (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3A,C</a>). This indicated that an activation chain among the cleaning modules is not sufficient to direct the progression of grooming. This conclusion is supported by observations that cleaning movements are only directed to the body part that is stimulated and not to other parts (<a href=\"#bib44\">Vandervorst and Ghysen, 1980</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Corfas and Dudai, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Kays et al., 2014</a>)"

To test this hypothesis, we took advantage of the fact that artificial activation of specific cleaning modules blocks grooming of subordinate body parts (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Thus, if the cleaning modules are evoked by dust on specific body parts, then flies released from artificial activation should initiate cleaning of the next dirty body part in the hierarchy. We tested this prediction by rapidly cooling the dusted GAL4/<i>UAS-dTrpA1</i> flies shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a> to a temperature at which dTrpA1 is inactive, and then observing the first cleaning movements performed. In effect, flies were returned to a normal behavioral state but with different distributions of dust on their bodies (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3A,C</a>). Indeed, flies resumed cleaning the body part downstream of where the sequence had been blocked (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3B,D</a>). For example, flies with clean heads and abdomens, but dirty wings and thoraces, focused on cleaning their wings (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, line R24B03). Thus, cleaning progresses to the next dirty and hierarchically superior part."

Between the proposed models describing how nervous systems execute serial actions, hierarchical suppression through competition is a core feature of parallel response models rather than activation chain models (<a href=\"#bib19\">Houghton and Hartley, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Bullock, 2004</a>). The general schema for this motor-control strategy for grooming is shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a> and consists of three layers: a sensory layer, a hierarchical layer, and a winner-take-all layer. The sensory layer consists of parallel sensory inputs that each independently activate a specific cleaning module. The hierarchical layer establishes differences in the activation levels between the cleaning modules (described in detail below). The winner-take-all layer then selects the module with the highest activation level by suppressing execution of the other modules. Once a module is selected, the reduced sensory drive that results from cleaning dust from the relevant body part gradually lowers its activation level, thereby allowing cleaning to proceed to whichever module has the next highest activation level (In <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a><b>,</b> the removal of dust by a module is represented with blunt arrows from the winner-take-all layer to the dust). Grooming proceeds from the module with the highest activation level to that with the lowest until dust is removed from all of the body parts. This organization leads to the emergence of sequential cleaning of body parts."

Circle fill levels show theoretical differences in the relative activation levels of the modules.

Theoretical all-to-all inhibitory connections in this layer are depicted as a gray box for simplicity. Blunt arrows from the winner-take-all layer to the yellow dust depict that the winning module reduces its own sensory input by cleaning off the dust and consequently becoming less active.

We simulated both possible implementations with a computational model to test if they were sufficient to explain the progression of grooming that we observed. The winner-take-all layer is the same for both implementations. Winner-take-all neural networks can be modeled using all-to-all inhibitory connections between the different units; however, conceptually, they simply select the most active unit and inhibit the rest (<a href=\"#bib19\">Houghton and Hartley, 1995</a>). In the model presented here, we selected the cleaning module with the highest activation level by using a maximum function (\u2018Materials and Methods\u2019). The only difference between the two implementations of the model is how the activation level of each cleaning module is set in the hierarchical layer. If no differences are set in the relative activation levels between modules, the result is unordered grooming, with equal probability of the modules occurring (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Alternatively, the sensitivity to dust (sensory gain) across the modules can be varied, such that their activation levels are proportional to the amount of dust on each body part, weighted by their sensitivity to the dust stimulus (gain of response to the dust stimulus). With this schema, modules with the highest sensory gain had a higher probability of being selected than those with lower gains, reproducing the observed sequence of grooming behavior (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). We see a similar result when the differences in the activation levels of the competing modules arise from unidirectional (asymmetric) lateral inhibitory connections (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Thus, both simulations produce the sequential selection of cleaning modules observed in grooming behavior. This demonstrates that hierarchical suppression can be established through either variable sensory gain or direct unidirectional inhibition, in conjunction with winner-take-all selection of the module with the highest activation level."

Based on the computational model, this occurs when the cleaning modules have relatively similar activation levels. For example, when no hierarchical differences are set among the modules (i.e., <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), they are all activated to nearly the same level in response to dust, and their selection is dependent only on slight differences in dust levels on their corresponding body parts. Once selected, a cleaning module reduces dust on its body part, causing its activation level to drop below that of the next cleaning module. That next module is then selected and cleans the associated body part until its own activation level falls below that of another module, and so on. Thus, incremental amounts of dust are removed from body parts while frequent switching occurs among the different modules (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). In the case where a hierarchy is set among the cleaning modules (i.e., <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C\u2013D</a>), the selection of those that are most hierarchically superior is initially very probable because their activation levels are relatively high in response to the starting amount of dust. As dust is removed, however, these levels among the modules become more similar. This equalization of activation levels through dust removal results in return cleaning by the modules, and the simulations shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,D</a> come to more closely resemble that of <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a> as cleaning progresses. Such return cleaning is also seen in wild-type grooming flies, and can thus be explained by our parallel model (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>)."

First, it can mimic the constitutive cleaning phenotypes of GAL4 lines expressing dTrpA1 in the absence of dust. Constitutive activation was implemented by setting a particular body part to be fully dusted regardless of the amount of cleaning done (as if the sensory neurons were constantly active). This resulted in the continual cleaning of a particular body part without triggering any other cleaning modules (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). Second, the model recapitulates the hierarchical suppression that we observed in our competition experiments (shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Adding dust to all body parts in the presence of the constitutive activation of a module and unidirectional inhibitory connections simulated hierarchical suppression. This leads to sequential cleaning by the hierarchically superior modules, whereas cleaning by the inferior modules was absent, despite the presence of dust (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>). Thus, we find close agreement between the experimental results and the model of grooming behavior, both in the progression of cleaning modules down the hierarchical levels and in the ability of modules higher in the hierarchy to suppress the modules below."

These alternations are an important and prominent feature in normal grooming behavior for efficient dust removal (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E,G</a>, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). In order to simulate the alternations, we considered leg rubbing to be a member of the same suppression hierarchy with the other cleaning modules and ran the model simulation based on two premises (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). First, leg rubbing occurs at all stages of grooming. Therefore, it would necessarily be among the most hierarchically superior of the cleaning modules to be able to suppress cleaning by the others. Second, dust accumulates on the legs while they clean the body parts. This accumulation of dust increases the activation level to the point where leg rubbing is active and the body cleaning modules are subsequently suppressed. The removal of dust from the legs through leg rubbing then reduces suppression on the body cleaning modules and allows cleaning of the corresponding body parts to resume. This cyclic accumulation and removal of dust from the legs during body cleaning could account for the high transition probabilities between the leg and body modules. When we simulated leg rubbing in the model, the sequential progression of body cleaning modules down the hierarchy was preserved (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). The simulation also produced the cyclic alternations between cleaning of a body part and leg rubbing that we observed in our empirically obtained ethograms of wild-type flies (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,D</a>). We conclude that hierarchical relationships among the cleaning modules mediate not only their sequential execution, but also the cyclic transition dynamics between body cleaning and leg rubbing."

Therefore, if leg rubbing is constitutively activated, it should suppress cleaning of the other body parts in a competition experiment where flies are coated in dust. We tested this prediction by using a GAL4 line that drove strong leg rubbing of both the front and hind legs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, R17F11). When these flies were coated in dust, they were unable to completely clean their bodies, indicating that the body cleaning modules were suppressed (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). This supports the prediction that leg rubbing is part of a grooming suppression hierarchy. However, cleaning of some body parts were suppressed more than others, suggesting that leg rubbing is not the most superiorly positioned module in the suppressive hierarchy. For example, activated leg rubbing did not suppress eye cleaning. This suggests that eye cleaning is at the top of the grooming hierarchy. Additionally, leg rubbing only weakly suppressed cleaning of the abdomen. Given that abdominal cleaning is the most hierarchically superior of the cleaning modules performed by the hind legs, this may suggest that hind leg rubbing and abdominal cleaning are more equal in their positions in the hierarchy. These results indicate that our model can explain the main observed features of the grooming progression, including the sequential cleaning of body parts and the frequent alternations between leg rubbing and body part cleaning."

These concepts are often referred to as behavioral choice, action selection, motor program selection, or decision making (<a href=\"#bib11\">Davis, 1979</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Redgrave et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Kupfermann and Weiss, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Kristan, 2008</a>). For example, mollusks will suppress mating in order to feed (<a href=\"#bib11\">Davis, 1979</a>). This suggests that food is rarer than potential mates, and thus feeding has a higher value than mating. We find that a suppression hierarchy mediates the selection of competing cleaning movements that cannot be executed at the same time. The existence of this hierarchy suggests that inherent values are placed on cleaning the different body parts and selecting one over others represents a \u2018best\u2019 choice. Eye cleaning is executed first in response to dust and is the most hierarchically superior cleaning module. This suggests a high value for flies to keep their eyes clear of debris. Because clean legs are necessary for cleaning each body part, their position near the top of the hierarchy is necessary for efficient debris removal. The antennae may have high value to flies because of the number of different sensory modalities that they house (e.g., audition, olfaction, gravity sensing, wind detection) (<a href=\"#bib29\">Laissue and Vosshall, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Kamikouchi et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Yorozu et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">B\u00f6r\u00f6czky et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Wilson, 2013</a>). Keeping the abdomen clear of debris is likely critical for respiration as it contains numerous spiracles (<a href=\"#bib38\">Phillis et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Heymann and Lehmann, 2006</a>).

Although much attention has focused on the role of hierarchical suppression in selecting between behavioral choices, there is little experimental evidence to support its role as a mechanism for eliciting action sequences. The grooming sequence may be considered as a series of \u2018forced choices\u2019 among different competing cleaning modules that are selected in priority order through suppression. As each body part is cleaned, suppression of the other cleaning modules is lifted, and a new round of competition between the remaining cleaning options occurs. Our work lends strong support to an emerging view that hierarchical suppression is a ubiquitous action selection mechanism, whether it is used in deciding among available behavioral choices, or selecting movements performed in complex serial tasks. Thus, the evolutionarily ancient ability to select among competing behaviors through hierarchical suppression may have provided the necessary infrastructure to perform motor actions in sequence (<a href=\"#bib19\">Houghton and Hartley, 1995</a>)."

Either local stimulation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>) or neuronal activation (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3C</a>) of a particular body part-cleaning module activates only one module and does not trigger the others. Feedforward activation models predict a chain of different cleaning modules once the sequence is triggered rather than just one (<a href=\"#bib21\">James, 1890</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Rhodes et al., 2004</a>). Second, the observed structure of grooming behavior in fully dusted flies is inconsistent with an activation chain model. As flies progressively groom their bodies, the transitions among different cleaning modules are gradual (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D,E</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4B</a>, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B\u2013D</a>). These gradual transitions are characterized by return cleaning among the modules, meaning that previous cleaning modules are revisited after later modules were already selected. Cleaning modules elicited through feedforward activation are not likely to exhibit such return cleaning, but should produce more deterministic sequences, such as those observed for zebra finch bird song (<a href=\"#bib31\">Long et al., 2010</a>). Although it is possible that activation chains mediate some aspects of grooming behavior, our evidence indicates that a parallel model alone is fully sufficient to reproduce major features of the dust-induced grooming sequence (discussed below)."

Both involve the parallel activation of premotor units in the sequence. The activation of the cleaning modules occurs through dust sensing, where each module is independently stimulated by a dust stimulus on its corresponding body part. Coating the body of the flies in dust leads to the parallel stimulation of the modules, and thus competition among them. Parallel models resolve such simultaneous activation schemes by creating a gradient of activity levels among the units that are executed in the sequence and selecting the one with the highest activity in a winner-take-all network. Our computational model of grooming works through a similar mechanism (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). We find that either differences in the sensory gain of the dust response or unidirectional (asymmetric) lateral inhibitory connections among the modules can generate an activity gradient. The most active cleaning module is selected in the winner-take-all layer while the others are suppressed. Parallel models propose that the sequence progresses when the selected unit is deleted, and a new round of competition and suppression occurs between the remaining units. In grooming, the active module \u2018deletes\u2019 itself from the sequence by reducing the dust stimulated sensory drive through cleaning (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>).

The only difference between leg rubbing and body cleaning is that the act of cleaning the body part leads to the transfer of dust to the legs, which then activates leg rubbing (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). The cyclic transfer and removal of the dust input leads to oscillatory behavior. Thus, simple modifications to the infrastructure underlying parallel models could produce different types of transition dynamics between modules (i.e., sequential progression and oscillatory dynamics). This demonstrates that these models can generate behaviors of increasing adaptive complexity."

Our model of the grooming progression has features like those proposed to explain learned sequences that also require parallel activation of units that compete for motor output. An example of this was derived from studies of human typing that revealed that adjacent letters in a word were often exchanged in error. This suggested that a plan for all the letters necessary to generate a word was readied prior to typing and that execution of each letter competed for output based on a hierarchical prioritization scheme and winner-take-all competition (<a href=\"#bib30\">Lashley, 1951</a>). Such studies led to the proposal of parallel models as a way nervous systems implement sequential behavior (<a href=\"#bib19\">Houghton and Hartley, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Bullock, 2004</a>). To our knowledge, work presented here provides the first evidence of a parallel model in an innate behavior and suggests that this organization may be more widespread than previously thought. Putting these concepts together with those discussed about behavioral choice leads to the consideration of the possibility that the neural infrastructure driving simple behavioral choice has served as a framework for the evolution of complex sequential behaviors such as typing (<a href=\"#bib19\">Houghton and Hartley, 1995</a>). The unifying feature of these vastly different examples of action selection is hierarchical suppression among competing actions. This raises the possibility that the underlying neural circuits have common organizational features."

Many complex behaviors are likely to involve hundreds or even thousands of neurons and information about the behavioral organization helps focus circuit-mapping efforts on specific features. For example, one prediction of our model of hierarchical suppression points to unidirectional lateral inhibitory connections among the cleaning modules (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Previous work has demonstrated that such inhibition can occur through direct inhibitory connections from hierarchically superior behavioral circuits to subordinate competing circuits (<a href=\"#bib25\">Kovac and Davis, 1977</a>). Therefore, it may be reasonable to search for direct inhibitory connections among the cleaning motor programs. Alternatively, such inhibition among behavioral motor programs may be due to shared neural circuits. In this case, the activity of a behavioral motor program suppresses another, solely because the shared circuit components cannot drive two behaviors at once (<a href=\"#bib6\">Briggman and Kristan, 2008</a>). Future experiments will address whether these or other neural circuit mechanisms govern hierarchical inhibition in serial grooming. Thus, the work presented here provides not only a framework for future experiments to understand how neurons and neural circuits mediate serial grooming, but also a basis for extrapolation to analogous organizational logic in other network-driven sequences."

What types of neurons might these GAL4 lines target? Two types that are already implicated in initiating movements are sensory and command neurons. Sensory neurons can activate specific motor programs as the initiators of stimulus-response circuits (<a href=\"#bib42\">Sherrington, 1906</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Huston and Jayaraman, 2011</a>). In fruit fly grooming, mechanosensory neuron-coupled bristles can trigger cleaning responses with mechanical stimulation (<a href=\"#bib44\">Vandervorst and Ghysen, 1980</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Corfas and Dudai, 1989</a>). This suggests that activation of these sensory neurons with dTrpA1 could trigger the specific cleaning modules. Command neurons have been defined as interneurons that are necessary and sufficient for activating specific motor programs (<a href=\"#bib27\">Kupfermann and Weiss, 1978</a>). However, the neurons targeted by the GAL4 lines used in this study only show sufficiency for activating cleaning movements as expression of <i>UAS-Shibire</i><sup><i>ts1</i></sup> or <i>UAS-TNT</i> were unable to block cleaning (unpublished data). This may be explained if the GAL4-targeted neurons are those referred to as \u2018command-like\u2019 (also known as command systems, decision neurons, or higher order interneurons) (<a href=\"#bib28\">Kupfermann and Weiss, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Kristan, 2008</a>). These neural types are sufficient to activate particular motor programs but do not necessarily fit the strict criteria of also being necessary. Thus, we propose that sensory neurons, command-like neurons, or both activate the cleaning modules."

It is likely that the lines target a mixed population of neurons, where only some are grooming specific. There are examples of GAL4 lines that activate specific behaviors, where only a subset of the neurons within each expression pattern confers the phenotype (<a href=\"#bib45\">von Philipsborn et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Luan et al., 2012</a>). Alternatively, the enhancer fragments used in generating the GAL4 lines might target expression to many different types of neurons involved in the same behavior (<a href=\"#bib36\">Pfeiffer et al., 2008</a>). For example, the <i>fruitless</i> gene is expressed in 1500 neurons of different types that comprise elements of a courtship circuit (<a href=\"#bib48\">Yu et al., 2010</a>). Activation of this population of <i>fruitless</i> neurons with dTrpA1 is sufficient to trigger courtship behavior (<a href=\"#bib35\">Pan et al., 2011</a>). Further refinement of the expression patterns driven by the GAL4 line enhancers will allow us to distinguish between these possibilities. Thus, we anticipate that identifying the neural circuitry for each cleaning module and determining how these circuitries interact will reveal how the serial organization of grooming behavior is encoded in the nervous system through a hierarchical suppression mechanism."

Starts of cleaning events are defined when the legs are farthest anterior (hind leg movements) or posterior (front leg movements) of the body part before they sweep in the opposite direction. Transitions between movements were included at the end of the preceding movement. Wing cleaning with the hind legs and leg rubbing using the second legs were sometimes asymmetrically performed in that one leg performed cleaning of a particular body part while the contralateral leg was stationary."

This paradigm sets up a distinctive motor sequence in which grooming proceeds and allowed the testing of the organizational principles governing how dusted flies groom their bodies with sequential movements. Using genetically targeted activation of neural subsets, the authors drove different components of the grooming sequence that clean individual body parts. They then performed competition experiments to show that the different motor components are organized into a suppression hierarchy so that components that occur first suppress those that occur later. They then make a simple 'neural' model with two layers, a hierarchical layer of the independent cleaning movements and a winner take all layer, which nicely captures their data. Cleaning one body part reduces the sensory drive to its cleaning movement, which relieves suppression of the next movement, allowing the grooming sequence to progress down the hierarchy. They then discuss the implications of their finding for how sequential behaviors are performed and how simple behavioral choices are made."

The results are spectacular and, at least to me, completely unexpected. They screened more than 1500 Drosophila GAL4 stocks created at Janelia that expressed a temperature-sensitive cation channel (dTrpA1) in all the GAL4-expressing neurons. From these, they found 12 lines that reliably affected different aspects of grooming behavior. They then devised behavioral and anatomical tests to assay the sequence of behaviors that normally occurs in normal grooming. They then used activation of the components of grooming (using the legs to wipe dust from different body parts) to test whether the sequencing of the grooming components (which they call \u201cmodules\u201d) depends upon a series or a parallel mechanism. (They come down strongly in favor of a parallel mechanism.) Both the behavioral and genetic tools they devised are extremely clever (horrendously tedious, but conceptually clear), and the analyses are appropriate and convincing. The major conclusion (that there are separable modules of grooming that inhibit one another in a hierarchical order) is well documented and, for the most part, clearly presented."

Minimally, at the end of the first paragraph in Results the authors could tell us that there is another feature of grooming that will be detailed later. In fact, the initial transitions diagram (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>) has a hint of this alternation; it could be mentioned in discussing this diagram."

In this work, Seeds et al. describe a new behavioral sequence that underlies grooming behavior, and take advantage of quantitative analyses and genetic manipulations that allow them to get at the organization of this behavior. Intriguingly, these studies support a parallel track model in which sensory input, combined with different sensory gains and a winner take all competition recapitulate many of the core features of fly behavior. As this system is the first to capture a sequence in which the sensory input that drives the behavior is the same across modules, it represents a powerful paradigm for the dissection of its neural control. This work is quantitative, rigorous, makes a general point and is appropriate for <i>eLife</i> with some modest changes I describe below."

I would therefore request that the authors extend the type of display in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>, developing a time-dependent transition probability model. A simple way to do this would be to cut the ethogram data into 5 minute segments, and replot the transition probability model (thresholded, as the authors do already). This kind of representation should give a more accurate sense of how the behavior changes progressively."

As far as I can tell, the model structure using sensory feedback and the winner take all layer should be deterministic \u2013 at whatever level of sensory gain is initiated, combined with the present level of dust, only one module should be selected (and should persist until the level of dust on that body part drops sufficiently for another module to win). However, the data in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> show that, like real flies, at most time points, the models have mixed character, with flies alternating between different activities (which change progressively). I understand how leg grooming is exceptional, in the sense that its sensory drive increases periodically (giving an oscillatory character to the behavior), but for all other grooming behaviors, the sensory drive can only decline. Is there a noise term that is not described in the text? If so, what is its form? If not, can the authors provide a more accessible description for why their models are not deterministic in time?"

First, the cleaning modules have parallel sensory inputs and stimulation of one input does not result in a complete sequence of movements, as might be predicted by an activation chain. Second, a serial model does not predict the return cleaning among the modules that occurs in wild type flies (return cleaning is described more in the next paragraph). We reasoned that an activation chain model would simply result in a deterministic sequence of simulated grooming movements, rather than this return cleaning. This said we make no claim that some degree of internal triggering of cleaning modules (through an activation chain) does not exist. In other words, a \u2018mixed model\u2019 could explain the empirically observed grooming behavior even better. In this case, execution of a cleaning module is selected by two components: winner-take-all (parallel model) and internal triggering from the previous cleaning module (serial model). All we claim in this work is that the parallel model alone is fully sufficient to reproduce the major aspects of grooming sequence discussed in this manuscript. We revised the Results and Discussion to better set up and then state our argument against an activation chain as the primary mediator of the grooming sequence. The manuscript has been changed to address this and other related comments from reviewers two and three. We now focus more attention on the return cleaning that occurs among the cleaning modules. We do this by first establishing that the flies clean a body part, then clean the next, but still return to clean previous body parts. These returns by the cleaning modules in wild type flies are now emphasized more in the Results that describe <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>. Next, a new paragraph was added on the return cleaning in our description of the output of the model (in reference to <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Finally, we argue in the Discussion that return cleaning is not what is expected of a simple activation chain model, but can be explained by our parallel model."

This causes variability in which modules are selected first when there is no suppression hierarchy (i.e. as in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). This is not, however, what causes the alternations among the cleaning movements described by the reviewer. Alternations occur as the activation levels between the movements get closer and closer through cleaning. For example, module 1 occurs first in the sequence and proceeds until the dust level on its corresponding body part is reduced enough that the next dirty module 2 now has a higher relative activation level. Module 1 is not yet clean, but clean enough that its sensory drive is less than module 2. Once module 2 cleans its body part, thus reducing its own sensory drive, the activation level of module 1 is now above 2. These two modules will alternate back and forth until their activation levels fall below module 3. Now these alternations will occur among all three modules. Therefore, the sequence has a sequential nature but, at the point where the activity levels become more similar through cleaning, the behavior takes on this alternating character (we now refer to this as return cleaning in the paper \u2013 i.e. returning to clean previously cleaned parts). This is apparent in the ethograms of actual flies after they are dusted, and in the model (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B-D</a>, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,C</a>). Although the appearance of the different movements in a particular order (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>) may be thought of as deterministic, the return cleaning between the cleaning movements is more probabilistic.
