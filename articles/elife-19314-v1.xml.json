The substrate binding stoichiometry of the bacterial NSS protein, LeuT, and thus the principal transport mechanism, has been heavily debated. Here we used solid state NMR to specifically characterize the bound leucine ligand and probe the number of binding sites in LeuT. We were able to produce high-quality NMR spectra of substrate bound to microcrystalline LeuT samples and identify one set of sodium-dependent substrate-specific chemical shifts. Furthermore, our data show that the binding site mutants F253A and L400S, which probe the major S1 binding site and the proposed S2 binding site, respectively, retain sodium-dependent substrate binding in the S1 site similar to the wild-type protein. We conclude that under our experimental conditions there is only one detectable leucine molecule bound to LeuT."

The substrate binding stoichiometry of the bacterial NSS protein, LeuT, and thus the principal transport mechanism, has been heavily debated. Here we used solid state NMR to specifically characterize the bound leucine ligand and probe the number of binding sites in LeuT. We were able to produce high-quality NMR spectra of substrate bound to microcrystalline LeuT samples and identify one set of sodium-dependent substrate-specific chemical shifts. Furthermore, our data show that the binding site mutants F253A and L400S, which probe the major S1 binding site and the proposed S2 binding site, respectively, retain sodium-dependent substrate binding in the S1 site similar to the wild-type protein. We conclude that under our experimental conditions there is only one detectable leucine molecule bound to LeuT."

Instead, transporter proteins in cell membranes must take these molecules from the outside of the cell and release them to the inside. Some cells, including those in the brain, also release amino acids and molecules derived from them into the spaces outside of the cell to send signals to other nearby cells. Again, transporter proteins must move these signaling molecules back inside cells, to stop the signaling and to allow the molecules to be recycled. Importantly, problems with these uptake mechanisms have been linked to disorders such as depression, epilepsy and Parkinson\u2019s disease."

This transporter takes up an amino acid called leucine into cells, and is commonly used as a model to understand this family of transporter proteins more generally. Using a technique called solid state nuclear magnetic resonance, Erlendsson, Gotfryd et al. could detect a single molecule of leucine bound to each transporter, but not a second one. This technique could also pinpoint that the leucine was located at the transporter\u2019s central binding site. Leucine was never found at the proposed secondary binding site. Together these findings suggest that only one molecule of leucine binds to the transporter at any one time, and that it binds to the transporter\u2019s central binding site."

The transporters are thereby crucial for the\u00a0regulation of synaptic transmission in the CNS and alterations in their function have been linked to several psychiatric and neurological disorders such as depression, bipolar disorders, attention deficit hyperactive disorder (ADHD), epilepsy, and Parkinson\u2019s disease (<a href=\"#bib2\">Broer, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Kristensen et al., 2011</a>). The understanding of the molecular mechanisms and structural (re)arrangements underlying NSS function has advanced significantly in recent years. The most detailed insight into structure-function relationships of NSSs comes from studies of the amino acid transporter, LeuT, from <i>Aquifex</i> aeolicus (<a href=\"#bib4\">Kantcheva et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Kazmier et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Malinauskaite et al., 2014</a>, <a href=\"#bib9\">2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Piscitelli et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Quick et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Shi et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Singh et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Wang et al., 2012a</a>, <a href=\"#bib20\">2012b</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Yamashita et al., 2005</a>). Recent structures of the drosophila dopamine transporter (dDAT)\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib10\">Penmatsa et al., 2013</a>) and the human serotonin transporter (<a href=\"#bib3\">Coleman et al., 2016</a>), which are eukaryotic members of the NSS family, confirm that LeuT is a reliable model protein and proves its value in understanding the molecular function of this class of transporters."

The S2 site is suggested to be an allosteric trigger, essential for coupling the energy from the electrochemical gradient to the transport of the solute. The binding of leucine to the S2 site has been measured to have the same affinity (in nM range) as binding to the S1 but does not, as the S1 bound substrate, directly coordinate sodium (<a href=\"#bib14\">Quick et al., 2012</a>). However, attempts to crystallize LeuT with substrate bound to the S2 site have so far been unsuccessful, and therefore the existence of the S2 site is supported primarily by radioligand binding assays and guided MD simulations\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib14\">Quick et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Zhao et al., 2011</a>). Due to the lack of structural evidence, the existence of a high-affinity S2 site has been questioned (<a href=\"#bib11\">Piscitelli et al., 2010</a>), supporting the need for employing new techniques for investigating ligand binding in NSS proteins."

Our approach offers several advantages: (i) We use microcrystalline samples of LeuT prepared under experimental conditions allowing for conformations capable of ligand binding to both S1 and S2 (<a href=\"#bib14\">Quick et al., 2012</a>). (ii) NMR offers information on the full structural ensemble which is unlikely not to include conformers (even lowly populated) prone to bind leucine in S2. (iii) Leucine binding to S1 and S2 may be distinguished by characteristic chemical shifts that are expected to be different due to different chemical environments, i.e. interacting residues (<a href=\"#bib15\">Reyes et al., 2011</a>)."

All experiments were done at a DDM concentration commonly used in <i>in vitro</i> assays (i.e., 0.05% corresponding to 5.7x CMC).

                        "text": "To achieve sufficiently narrow line widths of the NMR signals and to avoid any signal from unbound leucine, we produced microcrystalline samples of LeuT (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), and performed cross polarization (CP)-based NMR experiments at temperatures above the freezing point. In all other preparations tested (frozen, lyophilized and proteoliposomes) the signal from the unspecific or unbound leucine completely dominated the spectra (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3A\u2013B</a>). Using the microcrystalline preparations, we were able to produce the\u00a0high quality CP-based <sup>15</sup>N detected spectra showing one significant (above 2\u03c3 \u2013 <a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>) peak at 38.2 ppm that could be assigned to the amine of protein bound leucine (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). In addition to the sharp signal from leucine, much broader signals between 110 and 130 ppm were also observed, which originate from the <sup>15</sup>N natural abundance of the LeuT amides (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). To further assess whether the intense signal at 38.2 ppm reflects sodium specific leucine binding to LeuT, we performed a parallel experiment substituting Na<sup>+</sup> with K<sup>+</sup>. Sodium is required for leucine binding (<a href=\"#bib22\">Zhao et al., 2011</a>). By the use of <sup>23</sup>Na-NMR we confirmed the presence of only a negligible amount of residual NaCl (at 7.1 ppm), and that no detectable Na<sup>+</sup> was coordinated in the protein (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). In the absence of Na<sup>+</sup>, the signal at 38.2 ppm in the <sup>15</sup>N 1D spectrum disappeared as expected for a signal originating from <sup>15</sup>N-leucine bound to LeuT (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Worth of note, the amine NH<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup> group of free leucine has a chemical shift of approximately 41 ppm at pH 8 (<a href=\"#fig1s5\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5A\u2013B</a>), demonstrating that the bound substrate resides in a not fully solvent accessible environment. Importantly, we were unable to detect any signal from any additionally bound leucine. Similarly, the <sup>13</sup>C CP/MAS spectra from the same samples clearly displayed only one single set of sodium dependent leucine signals (<a href=\"#fig1s6\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 6</a>)."

                        "text": "To investigate whether the origin of the substrate peak at 38.2 ppm was due to leucine binding either\u00a0to the S1 or the S2 site, we recorded solid state NMR spectra of two variants with compromised leucine binding, F253A (S1) and L400S (S2) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>). For these experiments we lowered the final concentration of the added enriched substrate to 5 \u03bcM to ensure proper detimental effect by the mutations. This concentration has previously been reported not to provide any detectable [<sup>3</sup>H]leucine occupancy in the S2 site of LeuT\u00a0L400S, but saturated S1 binding (<a href=\"#bib14\">Quick et al., 2012</a>). For LeuT WT the specific leucine peak was unaffected by lowering the free leucine concentration (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The F253A mutant has previously been shown to impair binding to the S1 site (<a href=\"#bib1\">Billesb\u00f8lle et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Wang et al., 2012b</a>). Thus, F253A serves as a S1 disturbing mutant at low substrate concentrations. In the F253A 1D <sup>15</sup>N spectrum, we observed sodium dependent substrate binding with a chemical shift of 38.4 ppm and a slightly lower signal intensity, when compared to the WT spectra (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). The shift in F253A was consistent for both high (1 mM) and low (5 \u00b5M) leucine concentrations (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Most importantly, the chemical shift difference of\u00a0~0.2 ppm for the observed bound leucine peak, demonstrates that the ligand is affected by the local environment of the S1 binding site. The L400S mutation was previously suggested to abolish S2 leucine binding (<a href=\"#bib14\">Quick et al., 2012</a>). The <sup>15</sup>N spectrum obtained for leucine bound to L400S (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, blue) completely resembled the spectrum obtained with WT protein (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, red). We were not able to detect any change in intensity or chemical shift. This argues against the possibility that the substrate signal we observe in LeuT WT samples is reporting on a combination of S1 and S2 binding. Also, we reason that it would be highly unlikely for an S1 bound substrate and a putative S2 site-bound substrate to have the same chemical shift as the environment of the putative S2 binding site markedly differs from the S1 binding site. As a major difference, the proposed S2 binding site does not involve direct sodium binding (<a href=\"#bib16\">Shi et al., 2008</a>)"

We note, however, that at our current signal-to-noise ratio (~20), we would not be able to detect species populated less than 5% of the structural ensemble. Based on the minor change in chemical shift in the F253A (S1) mutant, and the completely unaltered signal for the L400S (S2) mutant we reason that the observable bound leucine is located at the S1 binding site, thus supporting the idea that LeuT exhibit one single central binding site. We cannot exclude that the detection of S2 binding may only be possible upon the\u00a0complete transition of the transporter towards a specific (yet unknown) conformation or that unfavourable crystal contacts might complicate S2 binding. However, several crystal structures have shown the binding of antidepressants, which overlaps with the putative S2 site, using these exact conditions (<a href=\"#bib17\">Singh et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Zhou et al., 2009</a>). As previously proposed for LeuT (<a href=\"#bib11\">Piscitelli et al., 2010</a>) we speculate that the S2 substrate binding site, if present, is rather a transient site, responsible for optimal functionality of the transporter."

This S2 site has been proposed to play an important role in the transport mechanism. Clearly, a detailed study of ligand binding to membrane proteins is a central aspect for understanding their workings in cell membranes. The LeuT system has served as a powerful bacterial model system to understand the details of ligand and ion concentrations as well as the role of lipids and detergents. The crystal structures of the bacterial amino acid transporter LeuT have been determined in various conformations. It has been established that LeuT is a very useful model for Neurotransmitter:Sodium:Symporters. For these reasons, this work addresses an important, so far unresolved issue."

The latter are expected to perturb either of the proposed sites. The authors describe a single sodium dependent signal in the wild type with similar chemical shifts and magnitudes at high (1mM) or low (5\u03bcM) substrate concentrations. At the low concentration, an identical signal was observed with the S2 site mutant, whereas the amplitude of the signal of the S1 mutant was lowered and the shift was different. The reviewers were interested in the topic and approach, but raised several issues that will need to be addressed in a revised manuscript."

Why did the authors not conduct longer experiments to obtain a better signal to noise ratio? In addition, the 15N signal of the F253A mutant refers to the spectrum with the lowest signal to noise and the claimed 0.2 ppm peak shift could easily disappear with a slight change in phase correction. Even if this shift is really present, it is probably smaller than the intrinsic NMR line width."

Why did the authors not conduct longer experiments to obtain a better signal to noise ratio? In addition, the 15N signal of the F253A mutant refers to the spectrum with the lowest signal to noise and the claimed 0.2 ppm peak shift could easily disappear with a slight change in phase correction. Even if this shift is really present, it is probably smaller than the intrinsic NMR line width.</i>"

Although it would be very nice with better signal-to-noise, we have already pushed the amount of NMR time used for recording a single 1D spectrum to the limit. The spectra presented in the paper were signal averaged in 6 blocks of 60K scans. The magnet was re-tuned before each block of scans, which resulted in just about 64 hours for each 1D experiment. Consequently, increasing the signal to noise by a factor of two would require at least 256 hours of experiment time, which in our opinion would be too much. It could risk a significant destabilization of the sample."

We did not obtain as much crystallized protein for these variants as for LeuT WT and the signal-to-noise for the S1 peaks in these spectra are indeed lower than for the WT spectrum (4:1 and 11:1, respectively). However, the peaks are sharp and their positions are well defined (intrinsic line widths of ~30 Hz). We agree with the reviewers that our presentation of the data can be improved. In the original figure we had processed the data with a line broadening of 100 Hz, hiding the resolution. To accommodate this issue, we have presented the data in the inset of <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> with only 1 Hz line broadening. In addition, in <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a> we have produced power spectra, and aligned the intensities of the three constructs to demonstrate that the 0.2 ppm difference cannot be accounted for by minor phasing errors."

To this end, we realize that the fourth paragraph of the Results and Discussion puts unnecessary emphasis on the slight change in intensity. Our conclusion that the bound leucine senses changes in the S1 local environment (caused by the F253A mutation) and therefore are bound in S1, rests primarily on the differences in chemical shift of the leucine signals between LeuT WT and F253A. The comparison of the signal intensities relies on tentative normalization based on the natural abundance resonances, which are not suitable for making conclusions on subtle differences in the affinity, as also noted above."
