Furthermore, because mechanical stress is widespread, mechanical signals are difficult to uncouple from biochemical-based transduction pathways. Here we focus on the homeobox gene <i>SHOOT MERISTEMLESS (STM</i>), a master regulator and marker of meristematic identity in <i>Arabidopsis</i>. We found that <i>STM</i> expression is quantitatively correlated to curvature in the saddle-shaped boundary domain of the shoot apical meristem. As tissue folding reflects the presence of mechanical stress, we test and demonstrate that <i>STM</i> expression is induced after micromechanical perturbations. We also show that <i>STM</i> expression in the boundary domain is required for organ separation. While <i>STM</i> expression correlates with auxin depletion in this domain, auxin distribution and <i>STM</i> expression can also be uncoupled. <i>STM</i> expression and boundary identity are thus strengthened through a synergy between auxin depletion and an auxin-independent mechanotransduction pathway at the shoot apical meristem."

Furthermore, because mechanical stress is widespread, mechanical signals are difficult to uncouple from biochemical-based transduction pathways. Here we focus on the homeobox gene <i>SHOOT MERISTEMLESS (STM</i>), a master regulator and marker of meristematic identity in <i>Arabidopsis</i>. We found that <i>STM</i> expression is quantitatively correlated to curvature in the saddle-shaped boundary domain of the shoot apical meristem. As tissue folding reflects the presence of mechanical stress, we test and demonstrate that <i>STM</i> expression is induced after micromechanical perturbations. We also show that <i>STM</i> expression in the boundary domain is required for organ separation. While <i>STM</i> expression correlates with auxin depletion in this domain, auxin distribution and <i>STM</i> expression can also be uncoupled. <i>STM</i> expression and boundary identity are thus strengthened through a synergy between auxin depletion and an auxin-independent mechanotransduction pathway at the shoot apical meristem."

These growing tips are called shoot meristems, and the stem cells they contain create all the aboveground organs of the plant (stems, leaves and flowers etc.). In each meristem, a boundary forms between the slow-growing stem cells at its centre and the fast-growing organs that form around them. Because these plant cells are both stuck together by their cell walls and growing at different rates, strong mechanical stresses are created causing this boundary to fold. A key regulator of the meristem is a protein called STM, but it remains unclear whether mechanical signals are involved in the control of this protein."

Analysing STM in different mutant plants combined with advanced imaging techniques revealed that STM activity correlates with the extent of creasing at this boundary. The STM protein is also required at the boundary to ensure that developing organs separate out. These findings suggest that boundary folding might somehow create signals that activate STM. One candidate signal was the plant hormone called auxin because reduced levels of this hormone were previously associated with boundary formation. However, in further experiments, Landrein et al. ruled out auxin\u2019s involvement in this process."

Finally, proteins related to STM can be found in all biological kingdoms, including some proteins that regulate important process in animal development. Whether the activity of these related proteins is also regulated by mechanical forces remains to be investigated."

While this view has been overshadowed by the rise of molecular biology and morphogen-based patterning mechanisms, a growing contribution of mechanics in shape changes is currently emerging. In this framework, an instructing role of mechanical forces has been successfully explored theoretically (<a href=\"#bib78\">Shraiman, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Aegerter-Wilmsen et al., 2007</a>) and there is today accumulating evidence that many molecular actors involved in development are under both biochemical and mechanical control. In particular, studies on single animal cells show that mechanical forces contribute to the control of cell division and cell polarity, and relevant mechanotransduction pathways have been identified (e.g. <a href=\"#bib46\">Houk et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Fink et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Thery et al., 2007</a>). The idea that mechanical stress may also play a role in defining cell identity has also emerged in the past decade (<a href=\"#bib33\">Engler et al., 2006</a> <a href=\"#bib5\">Aliee et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Landsberg et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Farge, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Brunet et al., 2013</a>). However, this pioneering work is still debated and a role of mechanical signals in cell identity during development remains an open question. Furthermore, all the currently known mechanotransduction pathways involve elements of established biochemical-based transduction pathway (e.g. <a href=\"#bib48\">Janmey et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Jaalouk and Lammerding, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Orr et al., 2006</a>). Assuming mechanical signals play an important role in development, one may thus question the added value of mechanical signals in development if their action is so tightly coupled to biochemical signaling."

Mechanical cues contribute to the emergence of lateral roots in <i>Arabidopsis</i> (<a href=\"#bib29\">Ditengou et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Richter et al., 2009</a>), the expression level of the transcription factor <i>PtaZFP2</i> correlates to the amount of bending in poplar stems (<a href=\"#bib22\">Coutand et al., 2009</a>) and the expression of the <i>ELA1</i> gene in a specific cell layer of the developing seed is triggered by mechanical signals that are generated by the growth of the embryo against the endosperm (<a href=\"#bib23\">Creff et al., 2015</a>). While these studies suggest that physical forces can contribute to cell identity definition in plants, this remains to be fully demonstrated. A fitting system for this question is the shoot apical meristem (SAM), which contains a plant stem cell niche and controls the formation and identity of all aerial organs. Because cells are glued to each other, differential growth generates mechanical conflicts leading to shape changes. For instance, tissue folding occurs in the boundary domain of the SAM between the slow growing meristem and the fast growing organ. Because the epidermis is load-bearing (<a href=\"#bib30\">Dumais and Steele, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Kutschera and Niklas, 2007</a>), the boundary domain is characterized by a highly anisotropic mechanical stress; this mechanical stress controls microtubule orientation, which in turn channels growth direction and promotes tissue folding (<a href=\"#bib17\">Burian et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Hamant et al., 2008</a>). A contribution of mechanical stress in the polarity of the auxin efflux carrier PIN-FORMED 1 (PIN1) was also proposed suggesting an indirect contribution of mechanical signals in auxin patterns and thus in organogenesis at the shoot apex (<a href=\"#bib45\">Heisler et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Nakayama et al., 2012</a>). While the genetic bases of meristem functions are now well documented, a link between these genetic regulators and mechanical signals remains to be identified in the SAM."

Interestingly, the <i>STM</i> promoter has previously been reported to be more active in the boundary domains of the SAM (<a href=\"#bib44\">Heisler et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Leasure et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Kim et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Jurkuta et al., 2009</a>). In line with this observation, <i>STM</i> expression is regulated by several boundary specific genes (<a href=\"#bib2\">Aida et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Borghi et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Lee et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Takada et al., 2001</a>), in part <i>via</i> auxin signaling (<a href=\"#bib3\">Aida et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib85\">Treml et al., 2005</a>).

To assess this quantitatively, we measured the Gaussian curvature of the boundary at different stages of development in parallel with CFP signal intensity. Existing quantification protocols were not adequate: the replica method for instance involves the application of dental resin to make a cast of the meristem (e.g. <a href=\"#bib54\">Kwiatkowska and Dumais, 2003</a>) and this may impact gene expression; the image analysis software <i>MorphoGraphX</i> could provide a mesh surface together with gene expression levels, but some errors in the most curvy parts of the meristem could not be avoided. We thus implemented the level set method (<a href=\"#bib77\">Sethian, 1999</a>) in Python to detect the exact surface of the meristem: a suitable surface obtained by the thresholding of the image is evolved to the smooth surface that is the most accurate representation of the surface contrast in the 3D images. Second, <i>MorphoGraphX</i> was used to mesh the surface (<a href=\"#bib51\">Kierzkowski et al., 2012</a>), and to compute the Gaussian curvature taking into account neighborhoods within a 15 \u03bcm radius (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1C</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Using this pipeline, a negative correlation between CFP signal intensity and Gaussian curvature could be revealed and quantified (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C\u2013E</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). As a negative control, and using the same pipeline, no clear correlation between Gaussian curvature and CFP signal could be observed in a line expressing a transcriptional fusion <i>pPDF1::CFP-N7</i> that exhibits a relatively homogeneous signal in the whole meristem epidermis (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>)."

In this line, expression is restricted to boundaries, thus confirming the correlation between the GFP signal intensity and the extent of curvature at the boundary at least qualitatively (n\u00a0&gt;\u00a020, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). The correlation could also be observed in meristems from NPA-grown seedlings (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In this line, the signal was so clear-cut, that the total area of GFP expressing cells on longitudinal sections could be qualitatively correlated with the formation of a crease (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). To quantify this, we generated optical longitudinal section through the middle of each emerging primordia, measured the surface area of expression of <i>pBOUND&gt;&gt;GFP</i> in these sections and plotted it against the angle of tissue folding at the same position (see Material and methods). As in the <i>pSTM::CFP-N7</i> line, we measured a strong correlation between the area of <i>pBOUND&gt;&gt;GFP</i> expression and the angle of boundary folding measured on the orthogonal sections (n = 154, 5 SAMs observed at 5 time points over 48\u2009hr, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>).

We reasoned that if <i>STM</i> promoter activity is truly correlated with curvature at the boundary, we should still be able to detect such correlation in the <i>bot1-7</i> mutant background, although with a delay in time. First, we measured the folding angle with respect to organ size in <i>bot1-7</i>. As expected, we observed a reduction in folding angle for a given primordium size in <i>bot1-7</i> when compared to the WT, demonstrating that the relation between tissue folding and organ emergence is impaired in <i>bot1-7</i>: large organs still have shallow boundaries (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B,C</a>). Next, we measured the GFP signal area in the boundaries of the <i>bot1-7 pBOUND&gt;&gt;GFP</i> line as described above. Note that both <i>bot1-7</i> and <i>pBOUND&gt;&gt;GFP</i> are in the WS-4 ecotype, allowing comparison between mutant and WT backgrounds. Whereas <i>pBOUND&gt;&gt;GFP</i> expression area was still correlated to tissue folding, we also observed a reduction in the area of GFP expression for a given primordium stage, when compared to the WT indicating a delay in <i>pBOUND&gt;&gt;GFP</i> appearance in <i>bot1-7</i> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>, WT: n = 154 measured on 5 meristems at 5 time points; <i>bot1-7</i>: n = 79 measured on 4 meristems at 5 time points). Therefore, modifying the shape of the SAM in <i>bot1-7</i> did not abolish the correlation between <i>STM</i> promoter activity and curvature, and instead demonstrated that <i>STM</i> promoter activity scales to Gaussian curvature values even when the relation between organ size and boundary shape is affected. Based on these results, <i>STM</i> promoter activity can thus be considered as a read-out of the extent of folding in the boundary of the SAM."

The <i>stm-dgh6</i> mutant exhibits the typical <i>stm</i> phenotype with two partly fused cotyledons, at an angle divergent from 180\u00b0, and a development arrest. At the same stage, the WT can exhibit up to 8 leaves while the <i>stm-dgh6\u00a0\u00a0</i>only displays two old cotyledons (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). As observed in other strong <i>stm</i> alleles, <i>stm-dgh6</i> was able in rare cases to reinitiate organogenesis and generate a lot of vegetative tissues. In our growth conditions, we found that roughly 1out of 30 <i>stm-dgh6</i> plants managed to grow beyond the cotyledon stage: these plants generated many whorled leaves and a few sterile flowers (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). To test whether <i>pSTM::STM-Venus</i> can complement the <i>stm-dgh6</i> phenotype, we selected 96 plants homozygous for the <i>pSTM::STM-Venus</i> construct and segregating the <i>stm-dgh6</i> mutation. After genotyping for the presence of the <i>stm-dgh6</i> mutation, we could not distinguish the WT, <i>stm-dgh6</i> heterozygotes and <i>stm-dgh6</i> homozygote plants visually, confirming that <i>pSTM::STM-Venus</i> can fully complement the mutation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D-F</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Importantly, we checked that STM-Venus was expressed in the <i>stm-dgh6</i> homozygote background by confocal microscopy. We found that the signal was comparable to that of <i>pSTM::STM-Venus</i> in a WT background, notably with an enhanced signal in boundaries (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>). In a few plants, we also observed larger stems and meristems, suggesting that <i>pSTM::STM-Venus</i> expression level might be slightly higher than that of the endogenous gene. These results demonstrate that higher <i>STM</i> promoter activity at the boundary in the marker lines reflects the endogenous <i>STM</i> expression pattern. Based on these data, and to ease the reading for the rest of the paper, we will use the wording '<i>STM</i> expression' when analyzing the fluorescent signal in <i>STM</i> transcriptional reporter lines."

Genetic evidence suggests that, in addition to its role in meristem maintenance, <i>STM</i> also contributes to organ separation in the meristem, in conjunction with other boundary expressed genes, such as <i>CUC, KNAT6, JLO</i> and <i>LOF</i> genes (<a href=\"#bib60\">Lee et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Aida et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Belles-Boix et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Spinelli et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Borghi et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Aida et al., 1999</a>). Lack of STM activity can generate organ fusions (e.g. <a href=\"#bib32\">Endrizzi et al., 1996</a>) and can enhance the fusion phenotype of <i>cuc1</i> and <i>cuc2</i> mutant seedlings, revealing a role of <i>STM</i> in boundary formation during the early stages of embryo development (<a href=\"#bib2\">Aida et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">2002</a>). This function also involves the <i>STM</i> paralog <i>KNAT6</i> gene, which is expressed in the boundary domain of the meristem in embryos (<a href=\"#bib8\">Belles-Boix et al., 2006</a>). Based on this literature, the expression of <i>STM</i> at the boundary is generally thought to control organ separation, but this has not been formally demonstrated."

In these lines, <i>STM</i> expression level was not always negatively correlated to <i>STM</i> amiRNA expression level; yet, <i>STM</i> expression was down-regulated in all the lines we analyzed showing that this amiRNA can effectively inactivate <i>STM</i> to some extent (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Given the expression pattern in the <i>STM</i> transcriptional marker lines, we reasoned that in these lines, we should primarily inactivate <i>STM</i> in the boundaries and to a lesser extent in the rest of the meristem. To test whether the amiRNA was effective at downregulating <i>STM</i> mRNA accumulation in boundaries, we introgressed the <i>pSTM::STMamiRNA</i> in the <i>pSTM::STM-Venus</i> lines. As expected, the STM-Venus signal was slightly (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H</a>) or more strongly reduced (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3I</a>) at the boundary, leading to a homogeneous STM-Venus signal in the meristem. Although meristem size was affected in these lines (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3J and K</a>), meristem termination defects were rare when compared to <i>stm</i> mutants. In particular, many normal and fertile flowers were generated (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3K</a>). We also observed that Gaussian curvature in the boundaries did not scale to meristem size (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3K</a>). Strikingly, major fusion defects were observed in most of the lines we generated, thus showing that organ separation was impaired in these lines (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3K</a>). The presence of wide boundaries (relative to meristem size) together with a reduction in meristem size that brings adjacent boundaries next to one another, may cause such fusion events. Because the fusions are revealed much later in development, we cannot completely exclude other scenarios. Note that <i>STM</i> mRNA, protein or amiRNA can move between non-boundary cells and boundary cells. Yet, as a negative impact of the amiRNA on STM-Venus signal could be detected at the boundary, these data rather confirm that <i>STM</i> expression at the boundary has functional implications and further support its role in organ separation."

The impact of STM on crease formation at the boundary could be mediated by inhibiting cell growth in this domain.

As auxin keeps accumulating in the organ, outgrowth goes on and curvature at the boundary increases. Interestingly, auxin and KNOX proteins are known to act antagonistically. Disrupting auxin transport with NPA or in <i>pin1</i> and <i>pid</i> mutant enhances class I <i>KNOX</i> gene expression (<a href=\"#bib76\">Scanlon, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Furutani et al., 2004</a>). Conversely, <i>KNAT1</i> inactivation can partially rescue the leaf number defects in <i>pin1</i>, suggesting that the auxin signaling pathway also promotes organ emergence by repressing the expression of <i>KNOX</i> genes (<a href=\"#bib43\">Hay et al., 2006</a>). In the boundary, the PIN1-dependent auxin minimum was also shown to promote axillary meristem formation whereas ectopic auxin production in the boundary inhibits axillary meristem formation (<a href=\"#bib89\">Wang et al., 2014</a>). This is further consolidated by the analysis of the DII-Venus auxin sensor, which is degraded in the presence of auxin and exhibits a strong signal at the boundary (<a href=\"#bib16\">Brunoud et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib88\">Vernoux et al., 2011</a>).

Interestingly, while this correlation could also be observed on longitudinal sections through the boundary as it folds (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), we also found that this correlation is stronger in the L1 layer: In the L2 layer, <i>pSTM::CFP-N7</i> expression increased during crease formation, but this was not always correlated with an increase in DII-Venus signal (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>)."

If this scenario were true, the application of exogenous auxin should thus inhibit <i>STM</i> expression at the boundary. To test this hypothesis, we applied the synthetic auxin 2,4-D onto the meristem and observed the expression of <i>STM</i>. As expected, DII-Venus levels were dramatically decreased in these conditions ([<a href=\"#bib16\">Brunoud et al., 2012</a>]; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>), confirming that auxin could indeed diffuse into the meristem. In the same conditions, <i>STM</i> expression at the boundary was however either unchanged or even slightly increased (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). This suggests that, whereas auxin levels negatively correlate with <i>STM</i> expression in the meristem, this correlation is also dispensable: <i>STM</i> expression and auxin depletion can be uncoupled at the boundary. This also shows that the relation between auxin and <i>STM</i> expression is more complex. Next we investigated whether the involvement of mechanical signals in <i>STM</i> expression at the boundary could help clarify these discrepancies."

                                "text": "There is growing evidence that mechanical stresses act as instructive signals in parallel to biochemical signals in development. These stresses have notably been involved in the progression of gastrulation in Drosophila embryos (e.g. <a href=\"#bib34\">Farge, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Lecuit and Lenne, 2007</a>) or in the formation of leaves with ruffled edges (<a href=\"#bib6\">Audoly and Boudaoud, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Nath et al., 2003</a>). In the meristem, the boundary separates a fast growing organ from the slow growing meristem. Mechanical stresses thus emerge early on from differential growth in the boundary and have been shown to act as instructive signals controlling the behavior of cortical microtubules and PIN1 early on. In turn, this promotes tissue folding that further reinforces the stress pattern at the boundary (<a href=\"#bib41\">Hamant et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Heisler et al., 2010</a>). We thus explored a scenario in which mechanical stress may be sufficient to induce and reinforce <i>STM</i> expression at the boundary. To do so, we investigated whether mechanical perturbations can trigger <i>STM</i> expression."

                                "text": "Note that mechanical perturbations can be of different nature. Mechanical perturbations induced by wind or touch, are extrinsic and discontinuous; they cause short-term elastic deformations (e.g. transient bending). They can impact gene expression within minutes and induce major developmental responses such as stem thickening, when repeated (<a href=\"#bib14\">Braam and Davis, 1990</a>). In the context of meristem growth, mechanical (tensile) stresses are in contrast intrinsic and continuous, and they cause long-term plastic responses (growth). The origin of such growth-related stresses lies in the presence of high turgor pressure rather than external stimuli. The opposition between these two kind of stresses can be illustrated with the microtubule response: transient pinching does not lead to supracellular microtubule alignments in the meristem, and this has even served as a negative control for the microtubule response to ablations in this tissue (<a href=\"#bib41\">Hamant et al., 2008</a>). Nonetheless we cannot exclude the possibility that some elements of the mechanotransduction pathways are shared between these two types of mechanical signals. Here, given our correlation between <i>STM</i> expression and crease formation at the boundary, we designed our mechanical tests to check whether <i>STM</i> expression can be modified by continuous mechanical perturbations."

Note that in all these experiments, we used in vitro-grown plants with a naked meristem recovering from a NPA treatment, as plants from the greenhouse need to be dissected to access the SAM, and the wounds may interfere with the mechanical perturbations. Using a microvice, we first induced global compression of the SAM. This is predicted to increase tension in the epidermis, and in the most extreme cases, to induce a bias in maximal stress direction parallel to the blades (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, [<a href=\"#bib41\">Hamant et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib86\">Uyttewaal et al., 2012</a>]<b>)</b>. Around 8 h after compression, we detected an increase of <i>pSTM::CFP-N7</i> signal (n = 8; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a> and <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). Similar induction was observed in the <i>pBOUND&gt;&gt;GFP</i> line; although the GFP signal was more variable before compression, a strong induction could nevertheless be observed in the <i>pBOUND&gt;&gt;GFP</i> line after compression (n = 11; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a> and <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). Furthermore, even if the induction of <i>STM</i> expression occurred earlier in the <i>pSTM::CFP-N7</i> line than in the <i>pBOUND&gt;&gt;GFP</i> line (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B and C</a>), the overall time frame (8 h onwards) rather suggests an indirect effect of compressions on <i>STM</i> expression."

Strikingly, we observed a local increase of <i>pSTM::CFP-N7</i> signal intensity around the ablation site from t = 18 h onwards (n = 16; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figures 5E</a> and <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>). The induction also seemed stronger in larger ablations than in smaller ablations, consistent with a greater range of stress perturbation in larger ablations (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). A similar response was also observed in the <i>pBOUND&gt;&gt;GFP</i> background, again with a delay (n = 12; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a> and <a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a>). While some degree of variability between individual plants at t = \u20090h could be observed, <i>pBOUND&gt;&gt;GFP</i> expression was also consistently induced after ablation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>). We also noticed that with both markers, the induction of <i>STM</i> was not homogeneous around the ablation site. In particular, <i>STM</i> was never induced at the base of meristem, that\u00a0is in the differentiating cells from the upper part of the stem. This is consistent with the prevailing view from the literature stating that the competence to express <i>STM</i> is limited to meristematic cells <i>sensu stricto</i>, and our data suggest that such a prepattern cannot be overridden by mechanical perturbations."

Even though this method is only semi-quantitative, we could detect an asymmetric signal, with a higher intensity near the ablation site, consistent with the results obtained with the <i>pSTM::CFP-N7</i> and <i>pBOUND&gt;&gt;GFP</i> lines after ablation (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>, n = 9). Note that ablation may also provide increased accessibility to the probe. Last, to check whether <i>STM</i> expression would be enhanced by wound-induced jasmonate production, we incubated shoot apices with 100 \u03bcM jasmonate over night. In these conditions, we did not observe any significant induction of <i>pSTM::CFP-N7</i> signal in most of the plants (N = 10/14, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5J</a>), and slight fluctuations in CFP signal in the remaining ones (N = 4/14, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5K</a>). Based on these results, we cannot rule out completely that jasmonate interferes with <i>STM</i> expression. Yet, as this contrasts with the systematic and steady induction of <i>STM</i> after ablation and with the robust induction of a <i>pJAZ10::GUS</i> reporter by jasmonate (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5L-O</a>), wound-induced jasmonate is not the most likely candidate as a secondary messenger between stress and <i>STM</i> induction."

Isoxaben is a well-known inhibitor of cellulose synthesis; after treatment, walls become mechanically weaker, and thus tensile stress increases (<a href=\"#bib45\">Heisler et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib86\">Uyttewaal et al., 2012</a>). In these conditions, we could detect a global increase in <i>pSTM-CFP-N7</i> signal intensity, when compared to that of the control (measurement on 10 nucleus of the central zone in the control (n = 6 meristems) and isoxaben-treated (n = 7 meristems); <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G and H</a>). This response was also confirmed in the <i>pBOUND&gt;&gt;GFP</i> background (control: n = 10, isoxaben: n = 20; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5I</a>). Note that <i>pBOUND&gt;&gt;GFP</i> was not induced in the entire meristem after isoxaben treatment, further demonstrating that mechanical perturbations cannot override the prepattern in the SAM. Because these different experimental setups have little in common except mechanical stress perturbation, we thus propose that <i>STM</i> expression can indeed be modulated by mechanical stress in the SAM."

To test this hypothesis, we first focused on <i>PINOID (PID</i>). Like <i>STM</i> in the boundaries, <i>PID</i> has an established role in organ separation and boundary function (<a href=\"#bib37\">Furutani et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Reinhardt et al., 2003</a>). In a <i>pPID::PID-YFP</i> line, we observed a more abundant signal at the boundary of the meristem, as in the <i>pSTM::STM-Venus</i> line (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). As detailed expression data were lacking in the meristem, we first analyzed the activity of the <i>PID</i> promoter. We generated a <i>pPID::CFP-N7</i> line and observed a pattern that somewhat echoes that of <i>pSTM::CFP-N7</i>. In particular, the CFP signal was detected in the entire meristem and was enhanced in the boundary domain (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). The signal obtained in a <i>pPID::AlcR ALcA::GFP</i> line (<i>pPID&gt;&gt;GFP</i>) further confirmed this result, echoing the <i>pBOUND&gt;&gt;GFP</i> signal (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C and D</a>). However, after ablation, <i>PID</i> expression was not affected in both the <i>pPID::CFP-N7</i> and <i>pPID&gt;&gt;GFP</i> lines, in contrast to our results in the <i>pSTM::CFP-N7</i> and <i>pBOUND&gt;&gt;GFP</i> line (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E\u2013G</a>, <i>pPID::CFP-N7</i>: n = 13; <i>pPID&gt;&gt;GFP</i>: n = 7). No induction could also be detected after isoxaben treatment in the <i>pPID&gt;&gt;GFP</i> line (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>; n = 11). Therefore, in our hands <i>PID</i> expression appeared as a negative control for our mechanical perturbations: <i>PID</i> expression at the boundary may not depend on a mechanical signal. Conversely, it suggests that the induction of <i>STM</i> by mechanical stress retains some specificity."

Note that in contrast to <i>CUC3</i> for which a transcriptional fusion is sufficient to recapitulate boundary expression, <i>CUC1</i> expression is restricted to the boundary <i>via</i> the post-transcriptional action of miR164, and thus strict boundary expression of <i>CUC1</i> can only be observed in a translational fusion line (<a href=\"#bib79\">Sieber et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Laufs et al., 2004</a>). After ablations, no significant induction could be observed in the <i>pCUC1::CUC1-GFP</i> line (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>; n = 11). For instance, when comparing the time points before and 24 h after ablations, GFP signal intensities were roughly identical and the GFP pattern could not be easily related to the wound position or shape. Later on, as the meristem recovered from the wound, new boundaries were initiated in which new GFP signal could be observed, again with no relation to the ablation position or shape (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Sometimes, the new CUC1-GFP signal even formed a line perpendicular to the wound edge, corresponding to the initiation of the boundary of following organs (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>, bottom panels), in contrast to <i>pSTM::CFP-N7</i> and <i>pBOUND&gt;&gt;GFP</i> induction that always appear and further consolidates along the wound edge. In other words, the cycle of <i>CUC1</i> induction at the boundary went on largely undisturbed, independent of the presence of a neighboring ablation. Altogether, this strongly suggests that <i>CUC1</i> expression at the boundary is also not controlled by a mechanical signal."

In the <i>pCUC3::CFP</i> line, we observed a strong and steady induction of CFP signal after ablation in all the analyzed meristems (n = 20). Interestingly, this induction seemed to appear earlier than in the <i>pSTM::CFP-N7</i> line, as a strong induction could be detected as early as t = 6 hr after ablation (<a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Although these data may suggest that <i>CUC3</i> expression is controlled by a mechanical signal, further tests would be required to reach such a conclusion. Nonetheless this demonstrates that boundary expressed transcription factors, even from the same family, are not systematically induced by wounding and, thus, that the mechanical induction of <i>STM</i> retains some specificity."

                                "text": "Another issue raised by our mechanical perturbations is the relatively long time responses (8 to 24 hr) for <i>STM</i> to be induced. While this is consistent with the relatively slow timing of organ emergence and boundary folding in Arabidopsis meristems (<a href=\"#bib55\">Kwiatkowska, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Reddy et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Grandjean et al., 2004</a>), it strongly suggests that the induction of <i>STM</i> expression after mechanical perturbations is indirect and could involve secondary signals, such as hormones. In line with this hypothesis, mechanical signals in animal development have all been shown to interfere with established biochemical signal transduction pathways (e.g. [<a href=\"#bib48\">Janmey et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Jaalouk and Lammerding, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Orr et al., 2006</a>]). Auxin signaling could again play such a role at the boundary, as the polarity of the auxin efflux carrier PIN1 depends in part on membrane tension (<a href=\"#bib45\">Heisler et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Nakayama et al., 2012</a>). Based on these data, a scenario emerges where mechanical stress would control PIN1 localization at the boundary, which in turn would locally deplete this domain from auxin, leading to a local induction of <i>STM</i> expression. Although our previous results suggest that <i>STM</i> expression at the boundary does not solely rely on auxin depletion (based on a global auxin treatment, see <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,D</a>), it does not formally exclude the possibility that the contribution of mechanical stress in <i>STM</i> expression at the boundary is mediated by local auxin gradients. In other words, whether mechanical stress impacts <i>STM</i> expression independently of the response of PIN1 to mechanical stress is unknown."

To do so, we performed a series of ablations on meristems expressing the DII-Venus sensor. Such treatments induce a local reorientation of PIN1 around the ablation (<a href=\"#bib45\">Heisler et al., 2010</a>), i.e. parallel to the new stress pattern, and should lead to the local depletion of auxin. After ablation and despite some variability in the basal level of DII<i>-</i>Venus signal on meristems recovering from NPA treatment (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>), we indeed consistently observed an induction of DII-Venus signal around the site of ablation (n = 21; <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>, <a href=\"#media5\">Video 5</a>). Interestingly, the first effect of mechanical stress on DII-Venus signal was detected around 4 to 8 h after ablation, which is consistent with the timing of the response of PIN1 after ablation (ca. 4 hr [<a href=\"#bib45\">Heisler et al., 2010</a>]) and the subsequent response of <i>pSTM::CFP-N7</i> after mechanical perturbation (8 to 18 hr after compression or ablation respectively, this study). The DII-Venus signal was also induced after compression (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>) further matching the response observed in the <i>pSTM::CFP-N7</i> line. Altogether, this suggests that auxin patterns and mechanical stress fields act synergistically to control <i>STM</i> expression at the boundary."

Although polar auxin transport in the meristem is largely inhibited, this mutant can generate bulges and sometimes ill-shaped flowers suggesting that compensatory mechanisms can be induced (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D and E</a>; [<a href=\"#bib66\">Okada et al., 1991</a>]). Because some degree of organogenesis is present in the <i>pin1</i> mutant, this allowed us to observe boundary formation in this background. To distinguish this form of organogenesis from what we observed in the WT, we use the word 'pseudo-boundary' in <i>pin1-6</i>. Despite the variability in DII-Venus signal in the <i>pin1-6</i> meristems, we could not detect any DII-Venus signal in <i>pin1-6</i> pseudo-boundaries, suggesting that <i>PIN1</i> is necessary to deplete auxin from the boundary (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>, n = 6). Interestingly, both <i>pBOUND&gt;&gt;GFP</i> and <i>pSTM::CFP-N7</i> signals were present in the <i>pin1-6</i> pseudo-boundaries (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D and E</a>), thus suggesting that PIN1 is not a major player in the correlation between tissue folding and <i>STM</i> expression."

This demonstrates that the induction of <i>STM</i> after ablation can occur independently of PIN1. While we cannot rule out the possibility that other auxin carriers substitute for <i>PIN1</i> in the <i>pin1</i> background, despite our efforts, the induction of <i>STM</i> around the ablation site could not be clearly correlated with DII-Venus signal intensity, suggesting that the induction of <i>STM</i> after an ablation is not primarily caused by a local reduction in auxin levels. In other words, <i>STM</i> expression and auxin distribution can be partially uncoupled and the correlation between tissue folding and <i>STM</i> expression always remains."

In these conditions, a lateral outgrowth can be induced at the periphery of the meristem, mimicking the first stages of organ emergence. In both the <i>pBOUND&gt;&gt;GFP</i> and <i>pSTM::CFP-N7</i> lines, oryzalin-triggered tissue folding led to a slight increase of GFP and CFP signals respectively, in the young boundaries (<a href=\"#fig7s3\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Because this induction occurred in the presence of NPA and as oryzalin indirectly modifies the mechanical status of cell walls (and thus promotes organ emergence), this further supports a scenario in which mechanical stress can promote the expression of <i>STM</i> at the boundary, relatively independently of auxin distribution."

For instance, the patterning genes <i>Twist</i> and <i>Notail</i> are induced by the deformation of the embryo during gastrulation and epiboly in Drosophila and Zebrafish embryos respectively, through the activation of the \u03b2-catenin pathway (<a href=\"#bib15\">Brunet et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Farge, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Desprat et al., 2008</a>). This suggests that shape changes are not only the result of biochemical regulation, but are also the source of mechanical signals that further channel morphogenesis <i>via</i> the control of gene expression. Our observations are in line with these conclusions: we report that the expression of <i>STM</i> at the boundary of the shoot apical meristem is correlated with tissue folding and is increased by mechanical stress. This provides a scenario in which biochemical factors, such as auxin, promote differential growth and shape changes in the meristem, which in turn, generate mechanical signals that can impact the expression of some of these regulators."

Here we show that mechanical stress at the boundary contributes to the local expression of <i>STM</i> that is in turn necessary for the separation between organs. Note that tensile stress at the meristem boundary becomes anisotropic before tissue folds, as maximal stress direction is first prescribed by differential growth. In this respect, our results might thus be extended to other tissues like leaves or embryo, where the induction of <i>KNOX</i> genes would be related to differential growth, and thus stress, before tissue folding."

Interestingly, overexpression of class I <i>KNOX</i> genes is sufficient to induce ectopic meristems (<a href=\"#bib21\">Chuck et al., 1996</a>). The boundary also plays a crucial role in plant architecture: this is where auxin is redistributed from the adjacent neighboring organ to the meristematic pool where new organs or new axis need to be initiated (<a href=\"#bib44\">Heisler et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Reinhardt et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">de Reuille et al., 2006</a>). The central role of the meristem boundary in plants largely explains why this domain has received considerable attention over the past decades, albeit from a molecular genetics point of view mainly (<a href=\"#bib4\">Aida and Tasaka, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib84\">Tian et al., 2014</a>). The role of mechanical stress in the function and regulation of the boundary domain of the meristem opens the possibility that other functions than organ separation are influenced by mechanical signals."

                        "text": "Another question raised in this work is that of the coordination between mechanical and biochemical signals to control development. In animals, well-known elements of biochemical-based transduction pathways are involved in mechanotransduction. For instance, integrin, \u03b2-catenin or YAP/TAZ are all involved in transducing mechanical signals (e.g. <a href=\"#bib48\">Janmey et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Jaalouk and Lammerding, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Orr et al., 2006</a>). Such intermingling raises the question of whether these signals can really be uncoupled with one another and this may even question the added value of mechanical signals in development. This is what we touched upon by analyzing the coordination between the plant hormone auxin and mechanical stress in the meristem. While we provide further evidence supporting a strong coordination between <i>STM</i> expression and auxin depletion, we also found that the response to mechanical stress can uncouple them. In particular, mechanical perturbations induce <i>STM</i> expression even when auxin transport or level is affected. In addition, mechanical stress does not seem to impact the expression of <i>PINOID</i>, which has been associated with the control of PIN1 polarity and thus auxin patterns in the meristem (<a href=\"#bib71\">Robert and Offringa, 2008</a>). This is thus a case where two redundant signalling pathways act relatively independently to control the same morphogenetic event. We propose that the absence of a strict coupling between auxin depletion and mechanical stress is a way to add robustness in meristem functions at the boundary. Incidentally, this highlights the added value of mechanical signals in this domain."

In addition to auxin, <i>STM</i> has been associated with the homeostasis of cytokinins, gibberellins and ethylene. Activation of <i>STM</i> promotes the expression of the cytokinin biosynthesis gene <i>AtIPT7</i> and cytokinin response factor <i>ARR5</i> (<a href=\"#bib90\">Yanai et al., 2005</a>). Conversely, overproduction or application of cytokinins increase the expression level of <i>STM</i> and can rescue weak <i>stm</i> mutant alleles (<a href=\"#bib73\">Rupp et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Jasinski et al., 2005</a>). This interaction with cytokinins is largely shared among the different class I <i>KNOX</i> genes and, consistently, it has been shown that <i>KNAT1</i> and <i>KNAT6</i> display redundant functions with <i>STM</i>. Interestingly, the level of cytokinins has been predicted to increase in the boundary, based on the cytokinin activity reporter pTCS signal, and axillary meristem formation has been shown to require cytokinin signalling (<a href=\"#bib89\">Wang et al., 2014</a>), consistent with the well-known bushy phenotypes of cytokinin overproducers. Temporally, this cytokinin burst would follow the initial reduction in auxin level at the boundary (<a href=\"#bib89\">Wang et al., 2014</a>). Thus cytokinin, in parallel to and after auxin depletion, may very well contribute to <i>STM</i> induction at the boundary. Class I KNOX proteins also reduce gibberellins levels, notably through a direct repression of the GA-20\u00a0oxidase gene (<a href=\"#bib74\">Sakamoto et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Chen et al., 2004</a>); conversely gibberellins can rescue the phenotype of KNOX overexpressors (<a href=\"#bib42\">Hay et al., 2002</a>). The induction of the gibberellin catabolism gene GA-2\u00a0oxidase was also shown to depend on KNOX proteins (<a href=\"#bib49\">Jasinski et al., 2005</a>)."

In contrast, other hormones, such as ethylene, have been associated to the plant response to many stresses. Interestingly, ethylene restricts the expression of class I KNOX gene <i>KNAT2</i> in the shoot meristem to the boundary domain (<a href=\"#bib40\">Hamant et al., 2002</a>). Note however that the exact contribution of ethylene in mechanoperception remains debated. For instance, while touch can induce ethylene synthesis, ethylene response mutants still display thigmomorphogenesis in response to touch (<a href=\"#bib19\">Chehab et al., 2012</a>); touch-induced thigmomorphogenesis rather depends on jasmonate (<a href=\"#bib19\">Chehab et al., 2012</a>). While certain hormones are rather associated with repetitive elastic deformations (like touch or wind), others are involved in continuous plastic deformations (i.e. growth and shape changes), these may be better candidates for the regulation of <i>STM</i> expression at the boundary."

In the past decades, there has been tremendous progress in the identification of genes that trigger such events in all living organisms. The robustness of such a complex regulation is often thought to rely on redundancy between different molecular pathways. Here we have investigated whether the shape itself, and its associated mechanics, interferes with gene expression and channels morphogenesis by constraining the possible outputs of the gene regulatory network. If generalized, such a dialog between gene and form could help us understand how reproducible shapes can emerge from a complex gene regulatory network that is susceptible to noise. Because of its essential function in morphogenesis and its impact on developmental robustness, this 'shape to gene' feedback may also have far reaching implications in evolution."

Longitudinal optical sections of various thicknesses were performed using the ImageJ software. In many cases, the Fire lookup table from ImageJ was used to represent the <i>CFP</i> signal intensity and background signal from raw images was reduced in images, by modulating the minimum level of intensity in ImageJ as shown by the calibration bars on the different pictures. The minimum level was however never above 50\u00a0out of 256 in intensity and the same processing was applied on all time points, and on control and assay alike. In some projections from of <i>pSTM::STM-Venus</i> and <i>pSTM::CFP-N7</i> where the signal was weak, area outside the nucleus emitting in both green and red channels and corresponding to either the auto-fluorescence of the plasts or the FM4-64 signal were automatically removed using the function calculator-plus subtraction of ImageJ."

The curvature maps were generated by plotting the mean Gaussian curvature on either non-segmented or cell-segmented meshes with a neighboring of 15 \u00b5m. The maps of <i>pSTM::CFP-N7</i> signal were generated by blurring the CFP signal with a radius of 10 \u00b5m and projecting it on the cellular mesh with a thickness of 10 \u00b5m. Note that the oldest organs were not included in the quantifications because of the inability of the mesh to follow the surface of the meristem in very deep boundaries and to extract well the <i>pSTM::CFP-N7</i> signal in these area. Furthermore, cells at the extremities of the mesh were also not included in the quantifications due to the presence of aberrations of Gaussian curvature on these parts of the mesh."

However, given the considerable lag between the mechanical insult and the change in <i>STM</i> expression, the reviewers feel that alternative interpretations are still valid and the claim that the <i>STM</i> promoter is mechanosensitive is overstated. We would therefore like to ask you to perform a more comprehensive analysis to strengthen your idea. For example, how does <i>STM</i> expression react to transient mechanical stimuli, such as pinching? Moreover, we would like to ask you to perform experiments to exclude the possibility that the observed expression changes are due to a wounding response. Analysis of <i>STM</i> expression upon local jasmonate application is one experiment that can be helpful here. Demonstrating that the behavior of the <i>STM</i> reporter is unchanged in the JA signaling mutant <i>coi1</i> would be another option. (We are aware that others have suggested that JA may be involved in thigmotropism, but it appears that those effects are probably rather indirect)."

If there is indeed causality linking mechanical stress and <i>STM</i> expression rather than correlation only, one could expect that this does not hold for any gene expressed in the boundary region. Performing the key experiments with other genes that are expressed in the boundary region could answer this question. Such control experiments should focus on other transcriptions factors."

The finding that an important developmental regulator is under control of physical forces in the growing organism while at the same time acting on shaping the organism is certainly of relevance to a wide audience. The experiments (mostly live cell imaging of fluorescent reporters, coupled to perturbations) and analyses shown are of high quality and are mostly well presented.

For instance, touch is an extrinsic, discontinuous mechanical perturbation that triggers thigmorphogenesis, and could for instance be coded in frequency. As an example, repeated stem bending can lead to stem thickening and this response can also lead to desensitization (e.g. Martin et al., 2010 J. Exp Bot). Another kind of mechanical perturbation is the intrinsic and continuous membrane tension in animal cells, leading to the inhibition of endocytosis, cytoskeleton reorganization and cell polarity (e.g. Houk et al., 2012 Cell). Tension also builds up in cell walls in plants: the slow extension of cell wall under turgor pressure, leading to wall thinning, triggers wall synthesis to compensate for wall weakening (Cosgrove 2005 Nat. Rev. Mol Cell Biol). Therefore mechanical cues can be either discontinuous or continuous in nature. The relevant mechanotransduction (and timing) will highly depend on the nature of these cues. Our data on <i>STM</i> are rather consistent with a response to intrinsic continuous tension than with discontinuous touch, and we have reworded the text in this revision to clarify this point."

In fact, this can serve as a negative control for our ablation experiments: when a needle touches the surface without breaking the top cell wall, <i>STM</i> is not induced. This means that <i>STM</i> is induced only when high and prolonged tensile stresses are present. A similar response was observed for microtubule orientation in the meristem: microtubule reorient only when the top wall breaks, i.e. when continuous directional tensile stresses are induced (Hamant et al., 2008 Science). This observation is more in line with <i>STM</i> expression pattern maxima, which are not stochastic, are slow to change and correspond to regions under high and continuous tensile stresses. This means that <i>STM</i> could be the downstream target of the wall integrity pathway for instance (continuous stress), rather than the touch mechanotransduction pathway (intermittent stress). Consistent with this, we also tested the potential impact of jasmonic acid on <i>STM</i> induction and could not detect any significant induction (see below)."

In this revision, we present the response to mechanical perturbations for two new boundary-expressed transcription factors. We decided to focus our efforts on <i>CUC1</i> and <i>CUC3</i>. Both genes display a boundary specific expression, albeit with minor differences both in their exact spatio-temporal pattern and regulation. We found that <i>CUC1</i> expression is completely insensitive to ablations, thus confirming that all boundary-expressed transcription factors are not induced by mechanical perturbations. In contrast, we found that <i>CUC3</i> is always induced after ablation, and we even found that this induction happened earlier than <i>STM</i>. Interestingly, <i>CUC3</i> has a greater contribution to the separation of cotyledons than <i>CUC1</i> and <i>CUC2</i> (Vroemen et al., 2003 Plant Cell) and it displays a slightly different spatio-temporal expression pattern that of <i>CUC1</i> and <i>CUC2. CUC3</i> is also not regulated by miRNA164.

Exp Bot). Here we only focus on curvature because the formation of a crease reflects the presence of stress at the boundary for sure, while a flat shape may or may not be related with stress (differential growth then also needs to be measured).

This is quite different from a transient compression from the top of the tissue. In fact, the ablations, lateral compressions and isoxaben treatments that are included in our manuscript are more consistent with the situation at the boundary: a prolonged exposure to mechanical stress. This discussion comes down to signal transduction kinetics: if one could increase very transiently auxin concentration (for a fraction of a second), the TIR1 auxin pathway would probably not be induced significantly enough to have a visible, steady, impact on gene expression. But this may be sufficient to induce visible short term responses, like a calcium peak. In other words, the cell responds differentially to transient and prolonged cues. Similarly, cellulose synthesis occurs in response to prolonged exposure to mechanical stress (caused by progressive wall thinning/weakening). To our knowledge, one pinching event does not induce a permanent increase of cellulose synthesis; only the repetition of such deformations (like the wind) may have a significant impact on growth. Last, in the text we refer to other documented genes that are downstream targets of mechanical stress. While some of them (TOUCH genes) are clearly induced within minutes of mechanical deformation, others (e.g. ELA1 in the immature seed (Creff et al., 2014 Nat. Com)) take several hours to be induced after prolonged exposure to stress, like STM in our experiments."
