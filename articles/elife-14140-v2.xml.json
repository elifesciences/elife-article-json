Using high-speed videography in anesthetized mice, we characterize the amplitude of whisker protractions evoked by varying the intensity, duration, and frequency of optogenetic stimulation. Recordings from primary somatosensory cortex (S1) in anesthetized mice indicated that optogenetic whisker pad stimulation evokes robust yet longer latency responses than mechanical whisker stimulation. In head-fixed mice trained to report optogenetic whisker pad stimulation, psychometric curves showed similar dependence on stimulus duration as evoked whisker movements and S1 activity. Furthermore, optogenetic stimulation of S1 in expert mice was sufficient to substitute for peripheral stimulation. We conclude that whisker protractions evoked by optogenetic activation of whisker pad muscles results in cortical activity and sensory perception, consistent with the coding of evoked whisker movements by reafferent sensory input."

In the rodent whisker system, which has been used extensively as an experimental model of active sensing, animals use their mystacial vibrissae (whiskers) to sample the immediate environment in rhythmic bouts of active self-generated whisker movements, called whisking (<a href=\"#bib33\">Kleinfeld et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Brecht, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Diamond et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Prescott et al., 2011</a>). A temporal sequence of extrinsic and intrinsic whisker pad muscle activation drives exploratory whisking: the extrinsic muscle <i>M. nasolabialis profundis</i> initiates the forward pad translation, and then the intrinsic 'sling' muscles that surround the base of each whisker follicle drive further protraction (<a href=\"#bib15\">D\u00f6rfl, 1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Berg and Kleinfeld, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Hill et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bosman et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Haidarliu et al., 2015</a>). Sensory signals arising from whisker-object contact are transmitted through the infraorbital nerve to trigeminal ganglion, ventral-posterior medial (VPM) thalamus, and S1 (<a href=\"#bib49\">Petersen, 2007</a>). Because whisker pad muscles almost completely lack spindles, proprioception is thought to play a minor role, if any, in determining whisker position in space. Instead, sensations that arise from whisker self-motion \u2013 'reafferent' signaling \u2013 is thought to play an important role in determining whisker position and object localization (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kleinfeld and Desch\u00eanes, 2011</a>). Although earlier studies suggested that reafferent signaling is encoded in parallel to afferent (touch-related) signals via posterior medial (POm) thalamus (<a href=\"#bib61\">Yu et al., 2006</a>), recent evidence suggests that reafferent signaling is also\u00a0processed along the same lemniscal (VPM-S1) pathway to cortex as afferent input from whisker-object contact (<a href=\"#bib44\">Moore et al., 2015</a>)."

Artificial whisking produces whisker protractions with amplitude and frequency that can be well controlled experimentally. This paradigm has drawbacks, however, including the necessity to perform experiments in anesthetized subjects, which makes it difficult to relate reafferent signaling to behavior; and the inability to stimulate certain muscle groups, which means that only whisker protractions, not retractions, can be evoked. Recently, optogenetic studies of motor nerves and muscles have used the hindlimb as a model system (<a href=\"#bib37\">Liske et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Towne et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bryson et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Magown et al., 2015</a>). While various central elements of the whisker system have been targeted for optical control in behaving mice (<a href=\"#bib50\">Poulet et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">O'Connor et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Sachidhanandam et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Matyas et al., 2010</a>), peripheral\u00a0optogenetic stimulation have not been used to investigate control of whisker movements."

We first characterize the amplitude and frequency of whisker protractions evoked by anterior whisker pad stimulation in anesthetized mice. We then compare the electrophysiological responses in S1 to optogenetic and mechanical whisker stimulation. Finally, we show that awake, head-fixed mice are able to perceive optical whisker pad stimulation in a behavioral detection task. The results suggest that optogenetic stimulation of whisker pad muscles leads to sensory perception through reafferent signaling."

The duration of each pulse in the train was 2 ms. Two alternative adaptation indexes were calculated as either the ratio of amplitudes of the last response to the first response in the pulse train (a<sub>n</sub>/a<sub>1</sub>) or the amplitudes of the second response to the first response in the pulse train (a<sub>2</sub>/a<sub>1</sub>). A smaller adaptation index indicates a larger difference between first and second or last peaks during the optical pulse train, and therefore greater adaptation. The adaptation index of a<sub>n</sub>/a<sub>1</sub> decreased to lower values than the adaptation index of a<sub>2</sub>/a<sub>1</sub> at the same frequency (e.g., at f = 28\u2009Hz, a<sub>n</sub>/a<sub>1</sub> = 0.41 \u00b1 0.04, a<sub>2</sub>/a<sub>1</sub> = 0.66 \u00b1 0.04), indicating further adaptation with increasing number of pulses (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). At frequencies greater than 30\u2009Hz, individual evoked movements were no longer discernible, although the envelope of the angle change continued to show adaptation up to 45\u2009Hz and became similar to movements elicited by constant prolonged light steps (data not shown). These data indicate that optogenetically evoked whisker protractions show activation and adaptation over a behaviorally relevant range of frequencies. Together, the results of <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> define fundamental stimulus parameters for optogenetic activation of whisker protractions in Emx1-Cre;Ai27D mice."

                                "text": "We next investigated whether peripheral optogenetic stimulation evoked neural activity in S1 by implanting 8-channel microwire arrays in S1 of Emx1-Cre;Ai27D mice. After one week of recovery, we recorded local field potentials (LFPs) and multiunit spiking activity in three anesthetized mice (isoflurane 0.8\u20131.5%) in response to peripheral optogenetic stimulation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). To account for potential differences in the locations of the arrays in S1, we analyzed signals from the channel with the shortest latency in each mouse. Spiking activity and LFP amplitude increased with the duration of peripheral optogenetic stimulation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,C</a>). Plotting the responses normalized to the maximum response in each mouse indicated that spike count and LFP amplitude increase steeply with light pulse duration from 1\u201320 ms, and moderately between 20\u2013100 ms (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). We used a brief mechanical deflection of the whisker to compare S1 response timing. While the active whisker protraction evoked by optogenetic stimulation provides qualitatively distinct activation of sensory input compared with passive mechanical deflection, this experiment allowed us to determine the relative latencies of S1 responses. The spike number and LFP amplitude evoked by peripheral optogenetic stimulation were on average similar to those evoked by mechanical whisker deflection (peak spike number per stimulus in 10 ms bin: 3.5 \u00b1 0.2 mechanical, 3.2 \u00b1 1.1 optical; LFP peak amplitude: \u2212168.5 \u00b1 24.7 \u00b5V mechanical, 159.66 \u00b1 45.1 \u00b5V optical). In one mouse, the largest responses observed to peripheral optogenetic stimulation were 5.8 spikes/stimulus and \u2212267.5 \u00b5V peak LFP amplitude (129.3 \u00b1 16.3% of the LFP amplitude evoked by mechanical whisker stimulation; values were 54.0 \u00b1 7.6%, and 68.4 \u00b1 2.6% in two other mice). Notably, the response latency determined from LFP recordings was 10.8 \u00b1 0.1 ms longer for peripheral optogenetic stimulation compared to mechanical whisker stimulation (p&lt;1x10<sup>-5</sup> in n\u00a0=\u00a03/3 mice; paired t-tests; 13\u201339 trials per mouse) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, inset; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). These results suggest that the longer latency in S1 for peripheral optogenetic stimulation can likely be attributed to the 11.9 \u00b1 0.8 ms delay associated with the initiation of evoked whisker movement (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>; value from 9.3 mW intensity), and that sensory signals arrive rapidly in S1once whisker movement is initiated. These results are consistent with our histological data suggesting that ChR2 is expressed in muscle and absent from sensory nerve (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>; <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

We trained mice to report the presence of 100 ms (9.94 mW) peripheral optogenetic stimulation by licking for water reward. In each Hit trial, mice received a water drop for licking within a 2\u2009s time window after a stimulus. False Alarm (FA) trials occurred if the mouse licked when no light was delivered during the stimulus time window and resulted in presentation of a 2\u2009s, 5 kHz tone and 5\u201310\u2009s time out before the next trial. Inter-trial time randomly varied from 5\u201310\u2009s. Two of four mice learned the task (d\u2019&gt;1) within 4 sessions (2 sessions per day, 125 trials per session), showing maintained Hit rate with relatively low FA rate (FA rate &lt; 0.3). The other two mice learned only after introducing 2\u2009M salt water solution as additional punishment for licking during FA trials. We aligned learning curves for all mice relative to the start of learning (d\u2019&gt;1) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), which was after the introduction of salt water punishment in 2/4 mice. Overall, behavioral performance improved via a maintained high Hit rate and a decrease in FA rate, resulting in an increase in d\u2019 from 0.7 \u00b1 0.1 to 2.3 \u00b1 0.4 (mean \u00b1 SEM; p\u00a0=\u00a00.017, paired t-test; n\u00a0=\u00a04 mice) over the course of training (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>)."

While the current study focused on the evoked protraction, further study is warranted to quantitatively characterize evoked retractions, including the possibility of using sequential protraction-retraction optical stimulation to mimic the natural whisk cycle (<a href=\"#bib28\">Hill et al., 2008</a>). The different types of movements are due to ChR2 expression in at least two specific whisker pad muscles. We identified native ChR2/tdTomato expression in intrinsic follicular muscles and in the extrinsic muscle <i>M. nasolabialis profundus</i> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Our results, in accordance with previous anatomical and physiological studies (<a href=\"#bib15\">D\u00f6rfl, 1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">D\u00f6rfl, 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Berg and Kleinfeld, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Hill et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Haidarliu et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">2015</a>), suggest that light-evoked protractions involve activation of intrinsic muscles, as well as the pars media superior and pars media inferior of the <i>M. nasolabialis profundus</i>. Because ChR2 is expressed in both muscle types, the relative contribution of activation of intrinsic versus extrinsic muscles to evoked whisker protractions remains unclear. Retractions involve activation of the (deep) pars maxillaris superficialis and pars maxillaris profunda of the <i>M. nasolabialis profundus.</i> Optical stimulation at the rostral whisker pad could favor protraction because of the morphology of the muscles along the surface of the pad, specifically the caudal-to-rostral tapered morphology of the deep retraction muscles (pars maxillaris superficialis and pars maxillaris profunda) (<a href=\"#bib25\">Haidarliu et al., 2010</a>). Achieving selective expression of ChR2 in extrinsic and intrinsic muscles would help to enable functional dissection of the whisker movements controlled by these muscle types."

One possible explanation is that the excitation light was restricted to a 2\u20133\u2009mm diameter spot on the whisker pad, while nerve stimulation evokes widespread muscle activation via acetylcholine release throughout the whisker pad. We also note that optogenetically evoked protractions showed stronger frequency adaptation than reported for artificial whisking. We found strong adaptation over a stimulus frequency range of 2 to 28\u2009Hz (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>), whereas 100\u2009Hz electrical nerve stimulation (artificial whisking) results in sustained whisker protraction for up to 1\u2009s (<a href=\"#bib9\">Castro-Alamancos and Bezdudnaya, 2015</a>). This could be explained by potential differences in muscle groups recruited by optogenetic stimulation in Emx1-Cre;Ai27D mice compared to artificial whisking. It is unlikely that desensitization of ChR2-mediated currents accounts for the adaptation effects we measured, since optogenetic stimulation of hindlimb muscles produces non-adapting contractions with pulse durations up to 1\u2009s (<a href=\"#bib40\">Magown et al., 2015</a>). Intrinsic muscles of the whisker pad are rapidly fatiguing because they consist almost exclusively of type 2B muscle fibers (<a href=\"#bib32\">Jin et al., 2004</a>). The fiber composition of extrinsic muscles is less clear, but appears to be of mixed fiber type (<a href=\"#bib32\">Jin et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Grant et al., 2014</a>). Our results showing strong adaptation are consistent with activation of rapidly fatiguing muscle fibers by optogenetic stimulation. It is possible that artificial whisking recruits less fatigable extrinsic protractor muscles more strongly than optogenetic stimulation. It might be possible in future experiments to determine the relative contribution of different whisker pad muscle groups to the adaptation effects we observed using selective optogenetic stimulation of intrinsic and extrinsic muscles."

                                "text": "In addition to the issues discussed above, the major benefits of peripheral optogenetic stimulation are the non-invasive activation of whisker movements using light and the ability to perform experiments without the use of anesthesia. We used these features to design a behavioral task in head-fixed mice in order to investigate whether mice can perceive whisker movements that result from peripheral optogenetic stimulation. Several recent studies have used similar behavioral paradigms to investigate afferent sensory perception using tasks designed to assess, for example, stimulus detection, object localization, texture or frequency discrimination (<a href=\"#bib1\">Arabzadeh et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">O'Connor et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Morita et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Sachidhanandam et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Musall et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Chen et al., 2015</a>). All of these tasks were designed to test the detection of <i>afferent</i> input, that is, aspects of sensory input arising from an external stimulus. The goal of our task was to test the detection of <i>reafferent</i> input, that is, sensory input arising from self-generated movement. During natural whisking, reafferent input arises from the whiskers moving through space and, because rodents mostly lack proprioceptors in whisker pad muscles (<a href=\"#bib44\">Moore et al., 2015</a>), reafferent signaling is considered important for encoding whisker position and locating objects in space (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kleinfeld and Desch\u00eanes, 2011</a>). However, reafferent signaling has been difficult to study: either the subjects are anesthetized and well controlled whisker movements are elicited by artificial whisking, or the subjects are awake are freely whisking, where whisker movements are not under experimental control. Thus, our behavior task provided a unique opportunity to investigate the detection of reafferent signaling in awake animals with well controlled stimuli. We found that mice could readily learn to detect peripheral optogenetic stimulation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). It should be noted that two mice required introduction of salt water punishment to reduce impulsive responding, as has been used in other types of Go/NoGo tasks (<a href=\"#bib52\">Rebello et al., 2014</a>), and that d\u2019 remained below that observed in other studies due to a sustained FA rate of approximately 0.2 (<a href=\"#bib31\">Huber et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Chen et al., 2015</a>). The reason for the sustained FA rate is not clear but could relate to motivation or hydration levels (<a href=\"#bib23\">Guo et al., 2014</a>) that could be further optimized in future studies. Similar to afferent sensory detection tasks, behavioral performance improved via maintained Hit rate and reduced FA rate over days. Four lines of evidence suggest that mice indeed used reafferent sensory input to perform the behavioral task. (1) Electrophysiological recordings from S1 showed that the latency was approximately 10 ms longer for optogenetically compared to mechanically evoked responses (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,E</a>), suggesting that the whisker must move before sensory signals arrive in cortex. (2) Changes in evoked whisker movements (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>), neural signals in S1 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>), and behavioral responses (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>) showed similar relationship with the duration of optogenetic whisker pad stimulation. (3) Visual stimulation was not sufficient to substitute for peripheral stimulation in expert mice performing the detection task, suggesting that mice were not responding to visual aspects of optogenetic stimulation. (4) Optogenetic stimulation of S1 was sufficient to substitute for peripheral optogenetic stimulation in the detection task (whereas na\u00efve mice did not respond to S1 stimulation; data not shown), suggesting that S1 is involved in perception of reafferent sensory signals."

Male Emx1-Cre;Ai27D mice were implanted with a glass cranial window and metal head post, as in previous work (<a href=\"#bib30\">Holtmaat et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Margolis et al., 2012</a>). Briefly, 4\u20139 week old mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (4% induction, 0.8\u20131.5% maintenance) and placed on a feedback controlled heating blanket maintained at 36\u02daC (FHC, Bowdoin, ME) mounted on a stereotaxic frame (Stoelting, Wood Dale, IL). After cleaning the surface of the skull, bonding agent (iBond, Heraeus Kulzer, Hanau, Germany) and a thin layer of dental cement (Tetric Evoflow, Ivoclar Vivadent, Schaan, Lichtenstein) were applied covering the right side skull and the anterior and posterior left side skull. A 4\u2009mm craniotomy was made with a dental drill (Osada EXL-M40, Los Angeles, CA), leaving the dura mater intact, centered approximately over S1 barrel cortex (-1\u2009mm posterior, -3\u2009mm lateral from Bregma). A 4\u2009mm diameter #1 thickness circular cover glass (Menzel Glaser, Braunschweig, Germany) was implanted directly on the dura. The edges of the glass window were covered with dental cement, and the junction between glass and cement was sealed with cyanoacrylate glue. A custom metal head post was cemented to the right side skull. After surgery, mice were housed under a reversed light cycle (lights off 08:00\u201320:00) and had free access to food and water. All subsequent experiments were conducted during the dark phase of the light cycle. Beginning 3\u20134 days after surgery, mice were handled daily by the experimenter. Adaptation to head restraint began after at least one week of recovery. For behavioral training (below), mice were water restricted to 1\u2009ml/day."

In each session, whisker movements were recorded in response to one stimulus parameter (intensity, duration, frequency; three total sessions per mouse). One mouse was excluded from the study because of anesthesia-related whisker motion artifacts in the first session; another mouse was excluded from the varying frequency experiment because of changing baseline whisker position. Mice were stabilized by bolting the head post to a cross bar and placed on a feedback controlled heating pad maintained at 36\u00b0C. Lack of reflex to tail/foot pinch was used to assess adequate anesthesia levels. Isoflurane levels were adjusted during recordings to maintain an approximately 1\u2009Hz respiration rate. This was a useful benchmark for adequate but light anesthesia and helped to avoid respiration-associated whisker movements that interfered with measurements of evoked whisker movements. Optogenetic stimulation was provided by a high-powered 460 nm LED (Prizmatix, Givat-Shmuel, Israel) coupled to a multi-mode optical fiber (200 \u00b5m core, 0.22 NA; Thorlabs, Newton, NJ). The duration and frequency of light pulses were controlled by trains of TTL pulses from an Arduino Uno board to the LED current driver. The fiber tip was mounted on a micromanipulator (Narishige, Tokyo, Japan) and placed within 2\u2009mm of the anterior right side the whisker pad, resulting in a 2\u20133\u2009mm diameter spot covering 3\u20135 whiskers. Maximum power was 10.3 mW measured at the fiber tip with a power meter (Thorlabs)."

Each movie was 5\u2009s in duration, including a 1\u2009s pre-stimulus baseline. 10 trials were recorded for each stimulus parameter with an 8\u2009s inter-trial interval. Movie files were converted to AVI format offline, and MATLAB-based (Mathworks, Natick, MA) whisker tracking software (<a href=\"#bib35\">Knutsen et al., 2005</a>) was used to extract the frame-wise whisker angle for each trial. Further analysis was carried out using custom routines in MATLAB. Well-isolated individual whiskers were manually selected for whisker tracking, and in some cases traces were averaged from 3\u20134 tracked whiskers. Stimulus-response curves were determined by measuring changes in whisker angle relative to a manually determined resting position. In intensity plots, data were binned in 1 mW bins to account for slight intensity differences used in different subjects. Data are shown as mean \u00b1 SEM for the four mice included in the analysis. Results from one of the four mice use for intensity and duration measurements was excluded from the analysis of adaptation because of unstable data."

Implants were performed in four of the same mice used for whisker tracking and behavior experiments (below); one of four mice was excluded due to poor signal quality. The glass window was removed (<a href=\"#bib19\">Goldey et al., 2014</a>) by carefully drilling the edge of the dental cement and lifting the cover glass with blunt forceps. To allow access for the array, the dura mater was punctured with a 34 gauge needle tip. The most posterior electrodes were targeted to C2-C3/D2-D3 barrel columns, as mapped by intrinsic optical signal imaging through the cranial window before removal. The microwires were inserted by stereotaxic manipulator to 500\u2013600 \u00b5m depth. The reference electrode was located at the anterior part of the array, 3\u20134\u2009mm from the most posterior part of the array. The ground wire was inserted near the olfactory bulb through a small craniotomy and fixed with a stainless steel microscrew. The array and ground wire were stabilized with dental cement, leaving the Omnetics connector exposed. Electrophysiological measurements were made with a 32 channel amplifier (ME32, Multi Channel Systems, Reutlingen, Germany) sampled at 25 kHz. Raw data was analyzed with custom routines in MATLAB. Local field potential (LFP) data was bandpass filtered from 0.1 to 300\u2009Hz, and spiking data from 300\u2009Hz to 10 kHz. Multiunit spikes were detected using a threshold of 3.5 * SD of the entire recorded voltage per trial. Mechanical whisker stimulation was delivered by inserting a single whisker into a 23 gauge metal tube that was glued to a piezoelectric bending element (Physik Instrumente PL140, Karlsruhe, Germany). A 1 ms TTL pulse to the piezo current driver (Physik Instrumente E650) triggered a brief rostrocaudal whisker deflection. 30 trials were averaged for each stimulus in stimulus-response curves."

There was no cue for trial initiation; inter-trial interval was randomized from 5 to 10\u2009s. 'Go' trials, when a stimulus was present, could result in either a 'Hit' or a 'Miss' behavioral response. If licks occurred within a 2\u2009s response window after optogenetic stimulation, the trial was recorded as a Hit and mice received a 5 \u00b5l water reward. Miss trials occurred when the mouse failed to lick within the post-stimulus response window. 'NoGo' trials, when no stimulus was delivered, could result in either a 'False Alarm' (FA) or 'Correct Rejection' (CR) behavioral response. A FA response occurred when the mouse licked during the response window of a NoGo trial. Mice were punished for FAs by 2\u2009s presentation of a 5 kHz tone followed by 5\u201310\u2009s timeout (in addition to the inter-trial interval) before the next trial. A CR was recorded when mice did not lick when no stimulus was delivered. Mice were trained using 125 trials per session, two sessions per day. The probability of Go trials was lowered from 60% to 50% upon reaching a FA rate of &lt;0.3. Mice with high FA rate after one week of training received salt water (2M NaCl) dispensed from a second spout as additional punishment (<a href=\"#bib52\">Rebello et al., 2014</a>)."

In four sessions in each mouse after learning had occurred (d\u2019&gt;1), we introduced trials with various durations of whisker pad stimulation (1, 5, 10, 20, 40, or 100 ms) with the same total stimulus probability. Mice were rewarded with water for licking within the 2\u2009s response window, as in standard training sessions. Trials with stimuli 20\u2013100 ms duration were included in learning curves. In separate sessions, visual catch trials were introduced by delivering 460 nm light through a second optical fiber either in front of the head (so that light reached the eye). Catch trials were randomly interleaved (10% stimulus probability) with whisker pad optical stimulation trials; if mice licked during a catch trial, FA punishment was delivered. The second optical fiber was also used in separate behavior sessions to stimulate S1 with 460 nm light (10% stimulus probability). In this case, the fiber was placed &lt;1\u2009mm above the cranial window in a location corresponding to previously mapped S1.

The authors realized that this could be used to investigate the reafferent sensory input that accompanies this form of active sensation. The whisker motions evoked optogenetically are shown to be perceptible and to generate signals that reach S1. The stimulation space is explored well and the work offers a guide for how people may use this technique in the future. The work will be a useful tool to add to the study of the vibrisso-trigeminal system."

One of the reviewers notes the presence of some apparent fluorescence near the shaft of the whisker. If expression is absent in the sensory afferents, this could be demonstrated with images of the IO nerve and/or ganglion. If on the other hand, there is some expression in the sensory nerve but the authors think they are selectively stimulating the muscles and/or facial motor nerve, they would have to devise some way of showing this convincingly, perhaps by showing that S1 does not respond to stimulation after muscle paralysis. Expression in the motorneurons is less problematic for the whole interpretation, but the manuscript should then make very clear that the present experiments cannot distinguish between motor nerve activation and muscle activation."

One of the reviewers notes the presence of some apparent fluorescence near the shaft of the whisker. If expression is absent in the sensory afferents, this could be demonstrated with images of the IO nerve and/or ganglion. If on the other hand, there is some expression in the sensory nerve but the authors think they are selectively stimulating the muscles and/or facial motor nerve, they would have to devise some way of showing this convincingly, perhaps by showing that S1 does not respond to stimulation after muscle paralysis. Expression in the motorneurons is less problematic for the whole interpretation, but the manuscript should then make very clear that the present experiments cannot distinguish between motor nerve activation and muscle activation.</i>"

We found no evidence of expression in nerve fibers at the follicle. To rule out that this negative result was due to technical factors, we performed the same histological analysis in parvalbumin (PV)-Cre;Ai27D mice as a positive control. Previous work has shown that PV is a marker for Merkel endings of the IO nerve that innervate vibrissa follicles (Sakurai et al., 2013, The Organization of Submodality-Specific Touch Afferent Inputs in the Vibrissa Column, Cell Reports 5:87-98). Consistent with this, we found clear evidence for ChR2/tdTomato expression in PV-Cre;Ai27D follicular nerve axons and nerve endings along the shaft of the whisker, suggesting that we would have observed expression in Emx1-Cre;Ai27D mice if it were present. A comparison of sensory nerve ChR2/tdTomato expression in Emx and PV mice is now included in <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>. Although a full characterization of optogenetic stimulation effects in PV-Cre;Ai27D mice was beyond the scope of the present study, we hope to pursue this in future studies of Cre driver lines that target ChR2 expression to different components of vibrissal muscles/nerves. The methods we establish in the present study will form the foundation for such future investigations."

If ChR2 were expressed in follicular nerve endings, optogenetic response latencies would likely be as short as those evoked by mechanical whisker deflections. Instead, the observed longer latency responses to optogenetic stimulation fit the time scale of the evoked whisker movement, consistent with a reafferent rather than direct afferent origin of evoked sensory responses. Thus, our histological and functional data are consistent with the lack of ChR2 in sensory nerve in Emx-Cre;Ai27D mice, a point we clarified in the Results (subsection \u201cBehavioral report of peripheral optogenetic stimulation\u201d). ChR2 expression appears to be localized to extrinsic and intrinsic whisker pad muscles, but largely or completely absent from IO nerve."

The color maps show a similar overall organization, including a rostral protraction area and a caudal-inferior retraction area. We chose to keep a common origin for each colormap, but similarities and differences for each whisker are clearly apparent. This organization is consistent with recent work by Haidarliu et al. (2015) on the structure of extrinsic musculature, which we now point out in the Discussion. We also performed a complementary analysis by plotting the evoked movement time courses for all tracked whiskers at a given stimulus location, which showed additional interesting features. Some sites, such as the rostral protraction area, elicited protractions that were relatively uniform across several whiskers. Other stimulation sites elicited more complex movements (usually of smaller amplitude), including a mixture of protraction and retraction from different whiskers. Although not the main focus of the paper, the phenomenon is now better documented in <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, and the analysis better conveys the richness of movements that can be evoked by optogenetic whisker pad stimulation in Emx1-Cre;Ai27D mice."

Because individual whiskers showed protractions or retractions depending on stimulus location, it is possible that stimulation at some locations elicits co-contractions that result in no net movement. No muscle activation would likely only result from stimulation delivered to the far edges of the whisker pad, but this was beyond the scale that we investigated. We added further description of these issues in the <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a> figure legend.
