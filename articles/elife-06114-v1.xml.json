The wing disc orchestrates dorsal air sac development by producing decapentaplegic and fibroblast growth factor that travel via specific cytonemes in order to signal to the air sac primordium (ASP). Here, we report that cytonemes also link flight muscle progenitors (myoblasts) to disc cells and to the ASP, enabling myoblasts to relay signaling between the disc and the ASP. Frizzled (Fz)-containing myoblast cytonemes take up Wingless (Wg) from the disc, and Delta (Dl)-containing myoblast cytonemes contribute to Notch activation in the ASP. Wg signaling negatively regulates Dl expression in the myoblasts. These results reveal an essential role for cytonemes in Wg and Notch signaling and for a signal relay system in the myoblasts."

Thus, the functions of the muscles, wings, thoracic cuticle, and trachea are linked, and the physical associations are intimate. The progenitor cells that produce these tissues develop together in the wing imaginal disc. Previous studies from this lab showed that the air sac primordium (ASP), which is the progenitor of the dorsal air sacs, depends on Branchless/FGF (FGF) and Dpp signaling proteins that the wing disc produces (<a href=\"#bib46\">Sato and Kornberg, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Roy et al., 2014</a>).

The wing disc is encapsulated by a basement membrane, but a branch of the tracheal system (the transverse connective) penetrates the basement membrane at several sites in the dorsal region of the disc (<a href=\"#bib19\">Guha et al., 2009</a>). Transverse connective that is within the basement membrane lies adjacent to the basal surface of the columnar epithelium, and during the third instar (L3), this segment of the transverse connective sprouts a tubular outgrowth\u2014the ASP\u2014in response to FGF expressed by a group of nearby columnar epithelial cells (<a href=\"#bib46\">Sato and Kornberg, 2002</a>).

ASP cytonemes that contain the Dpp receptor have been observed extending as far as 40 \u03bcm, crossing over approximately 15\u201320 disc cells to reach sources of Dpp. These cytonemes transport Dpp from producing cells to the ASP, and signal transduction is dependent on the contacts they make with the disc cells. Comparably long ASP cytonemes containing the FGF receptor have been observed reaching FGF-expressing disc cells, and in the wing disc, Hh dispersion is effected by a similar mechanism (<a href=\"#bib6\">Callejo et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bischoff et al., 2013</a>).

In wing discs, a mutant form of Wg that is tethered to the plasma membrane by a heterologous transmembrane domain is active (<a href=\"#bib1\">Alexandre et al., 2014</a>), but it is not known how signaling by this tethered form is related to the normal processes that present wild type Wg to receiving cells. There is no experimental evidence that shows directly that Wg disperses by passive diffusion or that it signals in vivo as a soluble, free protein. The study reported here investigated signaling between disc cells, myoblasts, and the ASP.

In order to identify the signaling system that correlates with the contacts between myoblasts and cells in the \u2018lower layer\u2019 of the ASP, we examined the expression patterns of several candidate genes. We did not detect expression of Senseless, Vestigial, Cut, or Distal-less in the ASP, and although we detected expression of Escargot, Trachealess, and Pointed, there was no apparent difference in expression levels between the \u2018upper\u2019 and \u2018lower layers\u2019. In contrast, we found that both the intensity of staining with \u03b1-Hindsight (Hnt) antibody and the expression of Su(H)GBE-lacZ (Su(H)lacZ) were significantly greater in the \u2018lower layer\u2019 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F\u2013H\u2032</a>).

These effects suggest that Notch activity is necessary for ASP development. To determine if Notch signaling in the ASP involves the disc-associated myoblasts, we over-expressed the pro-apoptotic cell death gene <i>reaper</i> (<i>rpr</i>) in myoblasts to reduce their number (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3M,N</a>). ASP growth was impaired by the <i>rpr</i> over-expression (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). We then investigated a role for Delta (Dl) because it is a Notch ligand that is highly expressed in myoblasts (<a href=\"#bib15\">Gildor et al., 2012</a>). To test whether the myoblasts produce Delta that signals to activate Notch in the trachea, Delta was depleted by expression of Dl-RNAi in myoblasts; abnormally small and misshapen ASPs were observed (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>). In contrast, expression of Dl-RNAi in the disc had no apparent effect on the ASP (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3O</a>)."

The Dia protein is a formin whose activated form localizes to tips of filopodia (<a href=\"#bib23\">Homem and Peifer, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Rousso et al., 2013</a>) and cytonemes (<a href=\"#bib42\">Roy et al., 2014</a>), and Nrg is an L1-type cell adhesion protein that has been implicated in the development and stability of neuronal synapses (<a href=\"#bib10\">Enneking et al., 2013</a>). Loss-of-function phenotypes are dependent on context and degree of knockdown and negative results are uninformative, but it has been reported that Dia and Nrg are necessary for cytoneme-mediated Dpp signaling in the ASP (<a href=\"#bib42\">Roy et al., 2014</a>). We examined the effects of <i>dia</i>RNAi and <i>nrg</i>RNAi expression on myoblast cytonemes and on Notch signaling in the ASP and found that both the relative number of myoblast cytonemes and Notch signal transduction in the ASP were reduced (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D\u2013L</a>). Notch signaling was monitored by expression of Hnt (for <i>dia</i>RNAi and <i>nrg</i>RNAi) and Su(H)lacZ (for <i>dia</i>RNAi). Expression of <i>dia</i>RNAi reduced contacts between myoblasts and the ASP (as indicated by reduced GRASP fluorescence; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5M,M\u2032</a>).

TCF<sup>DN</sup> inhibits Wg signaling, but its expression in the ASP had no apparent effect (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7L</a>). This result suggests that Wg signaling is not activated in the ASP and that Wg does not signal directly to the ASP. To evaluate Wg signaling in the myoblasts, we generated clones of mutant myoblasts that were incapacitated for Wg signal transduction. <i>Dishevelled (dsh)</i> is an essential component of the Wg signal transduction pathway (<a href=\"#bib21\">Habas and Dawid, 2005</a>), and although null <i>dsh</i> myoblasts did not activate Wg signal transduction, they grew to generate large clones (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A,B</a> and <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). However, their levels of Dl were elevated relative to <i>dsh</i><sup><i>+</i></sup> neighbors (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>). Ubiquitous expression of TCF<sup>DN</sup> in myoblasts (with the <i>1151</i>-Gal4 driver) decreases the number of myoblasts (<a href=\"#bib51\">Sudarsan et al., 2001</a>), but ASPs that developed in discs with these compromised myoblasts were large and deformed (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D,E</a>). Increased Hnt and Su(H)lacZ expression in the abnormal ASPs (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8G,H,J,K</a>) indicates that Notch signal transduction was increased. These results suggest that Notch signaling in the ASP is sensitive to levels of Dl in myoblasts and that Dl expression in myoblasts is negatively regulated by Wg signaling. Genetic linkage between Wg signaling in myoblasts and Notch signaling in the ASP was demonstrated by simultaneously expressing dTCF<sup>DN</sup> and Dl-RNAi in myoblasts (with the <i>1151-</i>Gal4 driver). ASPs in these double mutant discs were neither stunted nor misshapen (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D,F</a>) and expression of Hnt and Su(H)lacZ was similar to controls (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8G,I,J,L</a>). These results imply that Wg signaling affects the ASP indirectly\u2014that although Wg signaling may not be activated in the ASP, Wg signaling nevertheless plays an important role by down-regulating Dl expression in ASP-associated myoblasts that activate Notch signaling in the ASP. Wg-dependent down-regulation of Notch signaling has also been shown to be important for the myoblasts that generate the flight muscles of the adult fly (<a href=\"#bib20\">Gunage et al., 2014</a>)."

The number of myoblasts in early stage L3 discs is small, and we observed few of them directly overlayed Wg-expressing cells (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>). During L3, the myoblasts proliferate (<a href=\"#bib20\">Gunage et al., 2014</a>) to cover most of the dorsal disc by late L3, and we observed that the domain of Wg-expressing cells in the dorsal disc also expanded (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B,C</a>). However, the relative proximity of these Wg-expressing disc cells to the ASP decreased during the L3 period: although the most ventral Wg-expressing cells were within 5\u201310 \u03bcm of the ASP in early L3 discs, there were no Wg-expressing cells within 60\u201370 \u03bcm in late L3 discs (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9D\u2013F</a>). In order to determine whether myoblasts contact Wg-expressing cells and where such contacts are relative to the ASP, we applied the GRASP technique. The fluorescence of the reconstituted GFP revealed extensive contacts between myoblasts and Wg-expressing disc cells throughout L3, but these contacting myoblasts were adjacent to the ASP only at the early L3 stage (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9G\u2013I</a>). Wg-expressing disc cells did not contact the ASP or nearby tracheal cells at mid or late L3 (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10A</a>). These results suggest that Wg signaling from the disc to the ASP is indirect and that in the myoblasts, Wg signaling that is relevant to the ASP may be specific to the early L3 period."

Myoblasts that had both types of cytonemes were detected (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11A</a>). We next investigated whether the myoblast cytonemes contain Fz and Wg. We analyzed preparations from larvae that expressed a Fz:Cherry protein fusion in myoblasts and whose cytonemes were marked with membrane-tethered GFP. Fz:Cherry was present in motile puncta, many of which localized to myoblast cytonemes and to cytoneme tips (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11C</a> and <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). We also analyzed preparations from larvae whose <i>wg</i>-expressing cells expressed a Wg:Cherry protein fusion and whose myoblasts expressed membrane-tethered GFP (driven by <i>1151-Gal4</i>). Many Wg:Cherry puncta were observed, some of which co-localized with and moved along GFP-marked myoblast cytonemes (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11D</a> and <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>). To examine the role of the myoblast cytonemes, <i>dia</i>RNAi was expressed in the myoblasts, and Delta and \u03b2-catenin were monitored.

We found that the myoblasts are intermediaries that relay Wg signaling from the disc to control Notch signal transduction in the ASP."

In the wing disc, for example, Hh produced in the posterior compartment induces Dpp expression in a spatially limited group of anterior compartment cells that are situated just across the anterior/posterior compartment border. These cells function as the anterior/posterior organizer, dispersing Dpp protein that induces the expression of various target genes by cells across the disc. The Dpp-expressing cells may thus be considered to be intermediaries that relay Hh signaling. This relay system transforms a pattern of binary expression (Hh on in the posterior compartment, off in the anterior compartment) to the more complex nested patterns of expression of Dpp target genes."

Key differences between the systems that may be relevant are timing and physical proximity. Hh induces Dpp expression at the anterior/posterior compartment border in the embryo and appears to do so continuously until the late L3. Moreover, the spatial relationship between the Hh and Dpp-expressing cells remains essentially unchanged as the disc grows and matures. In contrast, Wg signaling in the myoblasts is required only in early L3 (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>) when the ASP and the Wg-expressing disc cells are relatively close (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>). Myoblasts in this region facilitate Wg signaling by extending Fz-containing cytonemes that take up Wg. At later L3 stages, the patterns of Wg expression in the disc are quite different and the distance between Wg-expressing disc cells and the ASP is much greater (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>). At these stages, the myoblasts that contact the ASP with Dl-containing cytonemes are juxtaposed to the ASP, far from the myoblasts that contact the Wg-expressing cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2, 9, 10</a>). The ASP has no apparent requirement for Wg signaling at these stages."

These regional specializations materialize as the ASP grows during the mid and late L3 stages (<a href=\"#bib18\">Guha and Kornberg, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Guha et al., 2009</a>), but in early L3 when Wg signaling is needed, the ASP appears to be simply a small outgrowth with no discernable lumen or regional specializations. Our studies suggest that the myoblasts that activate Notch signaling in the lower layer cells of the late L3 ASP are defined by their prior exposure to Wg. We suggest that the myoblast relay system may accommodate the changing spatial relationship between the disc cells that express Wg and the ASP cells that require Notch signaling."

The consistent finding that mutant cells respond similarly in the embryo and in the larval stages led to the general concept that homeotic genes are required continuously during development (<a href=\"#bib27\">Lawrence and Morata, 1994</a>). Our observation here, that ASP requires Wg signaling only in early L3, is unusual in this context, but it is consistent with two prior reports. One described somatic clones in the wing disc that ectopically activated the Dpp pathway, and analyzed the expression of the Dpp target gene <i>optomotor-blind</i> (<i>omb</i>) (<a href=\"#bib28\">Lecuit et al., 1996</a>). Differences between <i>omb</i> expression in the clones and in normal discs led to the proposal that some <i>omb</i>-expressing cells in late L3 discs are not active for Dpp signal transduction but express <i>omb</i> because of their exposure to Dpp at an earlier stage. The second study analyzed the expression of Wg target genes in wing discs that expressed a form of Wg that is fused to a transmembrane domain of an unrelated protein (<a href=\"#bib1\">Alexandre et al., 2014</a>). It reported that Wg is normally expressed in a pattern of well-defined stripes in late L3 discs and more broadly in younger discs, and to reconcile the apparent discrepancy in late L3 discs between the restricted distribution of the membrane-tethered Wg (detected by immunofluorescence) and the broader expression domains of the Wg targets (<i>frizzled3</i> and <i>Distal-less</i>), it proposed that target genes that are induced in cells at early stages continue to be expressed by descendants of these cells that are not active for Wg signal transduction. Neither study directly examined the temporal dependence of signaling on target gene expression or characterized thresholds for the identified phenotypes."

A requirement for cofactors that enhance solubility in vitro and promote long range signaling in vivo is consistent with this idea (<a href=\"#bib35\">Mulligan et al., 2012</a>). However, the form of Wg that moves between pre- and post-synaptic cells at the <i>Drosophila</i> neuromuscular junction suggests a different mechanism. EM micrographs show that motoneurons secrete Wg in a vesicular form and that postsynaptic cells take up exosome-like vesicles that contain Wg (<a href=\"#bib25\">Korkut et al., 2009</a>). We have previously reported that Dpp and FGF signaling in the ASP is mediated by cytonemes that synapse with signal-producing wing disc cells, and that several genes that are required at neuronal synapses also have essential roles at cytoneme synapses (<a href=\"#bib42\">Roy et al., 2014</a>). We have also suggested that signaling at neuronal and cytoneme synapses is conceptually and structurally similar (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kornberg and Roy, 2014</a>). Although cytoneme synapses that link Wg-producing wing disc cells and myoblasts have not been imaged with EM resolution, the most parsimonious model posits that cytoneme-dependent Wg signaling between disc cells and myoblasts is similar to Wg signaling at the neuromuscular junction and is also vesicle-mediated. The idea is that synaptic transfer and transit in exosome-like vesicles may be universal to Wg signaling. This reasoning has implications for signaling by membrane-tethered Wg."

An alternative possibility is that membrane-tethered Wg localizes to exosome-like vesicles that traffic along cytonemes and activates signal transduction while membrane-bound. Previous studies indicate that Dpp, FGF, EGF, Hh, and Notch may be cytoneme-mediated (<a href=\"#bib24\">Hsiung et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Cohen et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Callejo et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Roy et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bischoff et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Sanders et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Chen and Kornberg, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Roy et al., 2014</a>). The results reported here add Wg to this list and provide evidence that Delta-Notch signaling is cytoneme-dependent. Exchange of signals at synapses may be a universal mechanism of paracrine signaling."

To quantify Hnt staining (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figures 5I, 10J</a>), the mean intensity of 555 nm fluorescence was measured in an area (containing approximately 20 cells) of the lower layer of the ASP. The value (with background fluorescence subtracted) was normalized with respect to Hnt levels in an area containing approximately 10 cells at the dorsoventral boundary of the wing disc. For each experiment, comparisons were made to control genotypes that were prepared and analyzed together with experimental genotypes in order to control for differences in staining and changes to laser intensity. Statistical significance was calculated by t-test."
