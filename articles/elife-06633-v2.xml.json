The hypothalamus plays a role in such behaviors, but prevailing textbook views depict it as an effector of upstream emotion centers, such as the amygdala, rather than as an emotion center itself. We used optogenetic manipulations to probe the function of a specific hypothalamic cell type that mediates innate defensive responses. These neurons are sufficient to drive multiple defensive actions, and required for defensive behaviors in diverse contexts. The behavioral consequences of activating these neurons, moreover, exhibit properties characteristic of emotion states in general, including scalability, (negative) valence, generalization and persistence. Importantly, these neurons can also condition learned defensive behavior, further refuting long-standing claims that the hypothalamus is unable to support emotional learning and therefore is not an emotion center. These data indicate that the hypothalamus plays an integral role to instantiate emotion states, and is not simply a passive effector of upstream emotion centers."

The hypothalamus plays a role in such behaviors, but prevailing textbook views depict it as an effector of upstream emotion centers, such as the amygdala, rather than as an emotion center itself. We used optogenetic manipulations to probe the function of a specific hypothalamic cell type that mediates innate defensive responses. These neurons are sufficient to drive multiple defensive actions, and required for defensive behaviors in diverse contexts. The behavioral consequences of activating these neurons, moreover, exhibit properties characteristic of emotion states in general, including scalability, (negative) valence, generalization and persistence. Importantly, these neurons can also condition learned defensive behavior, further refuting long-standing claims that the hypothalamus is unable to support emotional learning and therefore is not an emotion center. These data indicate that the hypothalamus plays an integral role to instantiate emotion states, and is not simply a passive effector of upstream emotion centers."

However, Kunwar et al. have now challenged this assumption with the aid of a technique called optogenetics, in which light is used to activate specific populations of genetically labeled neurons. When light was used to directly activate neurons within the ventromedial hypothalamus in awake mice, the animals instantly froze and/or fled, just as they would when faced with a predator. Given that the optical stimulation had completely bypassed the amygdala, this suggested that the hypothalamus must be capable of generating this defensive response without any input from the amygdala."

Freezing and fleeing persisted for several seconds after the stimulation had stopped, just as freezing and fleeing responses to predators do not immediately cease after the threat has gone. And finally, destroying the neurons targeted by the stimulation made mice less likely to avoid one of their main predators, the rat. It also made the animals less anxious."

Accordingly, it is not surprising that the brain has evolved multiple circuits to control such behaviors. For example, studies in rodents have led to the conclusion that there are multiple, anatomically distinct pathways controlling learned (conditioned) and innate defensive responses (reviewed in [<a href=\"#bib99\">Rosen, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">LeDoux, 2012</a>] but see [<a href=\"#bib32\">Cezario et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Martinez et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Gross and Canteras, 2012</a>]). In these pathways, sensory inputs converge on the amygdala, whose output is relayed by the hypothalamus to downstream structures that control the defensive response. However, different subdivisions of the amygdala and hypothalamus are thought to control learned vs innate responses, in a parallel manner (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>; reviewed in [<a href=\"#bib37\">Davis, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Fanselow, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">LeDoux, 1995</a>, <a href=\"#bib70\">2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Gallagher and Chiba, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Fanselow and LeDoux, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Canteras, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib99\">Rosen, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib111\">Swanson, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Gross and Canteras, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">LeDoux, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib103\">Saper and Lowell, 2014</a>])."

Indeed, classical studies reporting that electrical stimulation of the hypothalamus is unable to condition learned defensive responses (<a href=\"#bib81\">Masserman, 1941</a>; <a href=\"#bib115\">Wada and Matsuda, 1970</a>) have been used as evidence that the hypothalamus is not itself an emotion center, a view reflected in contemporary textbooks (<a href=\"#bib71\">LeDoux and Damasio, 2013</a>). Instead, it has been assumed, by analogy to circuits mediating conditioned defensive responses, that emotion centers for innate defensive behaviors would be located in the medial amygdala (MEA), and that downstream hypothalamic targets would similarly serve as passive relays for amygdala output (<a href=\"#bib54\">Gross and Canteras, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">LeDoux, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">LeDoux and Damasio, 2013</a>).

We demonstrate that direct activation of these neurons, a manipulation that anatomically bypasses amygdala input, is sufficient to evoke multiple defensive behaviors, whose collective properties are consistent with the induction of an underlying defensive emotion state (<a href=\"#bib6\">Anderson and Adolphs, 2014</a>). Ablation of SF1<sup>+</sup> neurons, moreover, attenuates defensive behaviors in a variety of contexts. Finally, we show that SF1<sup>+</sup> neurons can condition learned defensive responses to initially neutral contextual cues, further refuting earlier claims to the contrary (<a href=\"#bib81\">Masserman, 1941</a>; <a href=\"#bib115\">Wada and Matsuda, 1970</a>). Together these findings suggest that SF1<sup>+</sup> neurons contribute directly and causally to a defensive internal emotion state."

Assuming similar levels of ChR2 expression in each hemisphere, bilateral photostimulation should activate approximately twice as many SF1<sup>+</sup> neurons as unilateral photostimulation (on either side) in the same animal. Indeed, episodes of freezing followed by activity bursts were only observed using bilateral stimulation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Unilateral stimulation under these conditions evoked freezing but no ensuing activity bursts.

The threshold light intensity required to evoke an activity burst was \u223cfivefold higher than that required for freezing (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C\u2013D</a>). Our previous studies of optogenetically evoked social behavior in VMHvl Esr1<sup>+</sup> neurons indicated that more active neurons are recruited with increasing light intensity (<a href=\"#bib72\">Lee et al., 2014</a>). Consistent with that conclusion, Fos was expressed in a significantly higher proportion of SF1<sup>+</sup> neurons in animals that exhibited activity bursts (light intensity 5.25 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>), compared to those exhibiting only freezing (0.65 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E\u2013F</a>). Activity bursts following freezing could also be elicited using a higher frequency of photostimulation at a fixed light intensity (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>), suggesting that increasing the average spiking rate among these neurons can also shift the behavioral output from freezing towards the activity burst."

Therefore, we investigated whether certain stimulation conditions could elicit an activity burst without observable prior freezing. To do so, we used a more penetrant and highly expressing viral serotype, AAV5, for delivery of ChR2 to SF1<sup>+</sup> neurons (<a href=\"#bib10\">Aschauer et al., 2013</a>). Systematic manipulation of stimulation parameters yielded a high-intensity, high-frequency condition (10.5 mW/mm<sup>2</sup> and 100 Hz) that evoked a short-latency activity burst following stimulation offset, without prior freezing (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H\u2013I</a>, arrow). During the ramp-up to such a condition, the latency to the onset of the activity burst during freezing gradually decreased. Taken together, these data suggest that SF1<sup>+</sup> neurons can trigger either freezing and/or activity burst behavior, depending on the intensity and duration of optogenetic activation."

Indeed, the sudden interruption of consummatory activity is often the most sensitive index of a perceived threat or anxiety state (<a href=\"#bib44\">Estes and Skinner, 1941</a>). We thus investigated whether activation of SF1<sup>+</sup> neurons would terminate ongoing social and consummatory behaviors, including mating, aggression and feeding (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F\u2013H</a>). Indeed, all three behaviors were rapidly interrupted by modest photostimulation (1.0 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>), in comparison to eYFP-expressing controls (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G\u2013H</a>). Although continued photostimulation under these conditions eventually resulted in freezing, appetitive behaviors could also be interrupted using shorter periods of photostimulation, during which freezing had not yet occurred (data not shown). These data indicate that SF1<sup>+</sup> neuronal activation not only promotes adaptive defensive behaviors, but also can abrogate consummatory and social behaviors."

We observed significantly longer latencies for ChR2 mice to re-initiate mating after SF1<sup>+</sup> neurons were activated, compared to interleaved internal controls in which yellow rather than blue light was delivered (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5K\u2013M</a>). Thus, activation of SF1<sup>+</sup> neurons causes persistent defensive responses in a variety of behavioral assays, suggesting that it engenders an associated internal defensive state. Consistent with this idea, optogenetic stimulation of these neurons produced nearly a twofold elevation in serum corticosterone (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

Therefore, we asked whether activation of SF1<sup>+</sup> neurons could serve as a US for the formation of associative fear memories. To do this, we used a modified two-chamber, real-time conditioned place aversion assay (RTPA) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), which we refer to simply as conditioned place aversion (CPA). We introduced several modifications for the CPA assay. First, we distinguished the two chambers by lacing them with different odors, and providing distinct mesh flooring and different colored plastic wall inserts. Second, for training we used bilateral stimulation with high light intensity (5.25 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>), which evoked freezing and/or activity bursts, rather than the low-level stimulation employed for the RTPA assay, which produced withdrawal, but no associative memory (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>)."

Before conditioning, we performed a 5 min pre-training test to determine each animal's initial chamber preference. Photostimulation during training was then carried out on each animal's initially preferred side (IPS), to determine whether training would overcome this initial preference. Training was performed over a 20-min period, using the manual closed-loop procedure described for the RTPA assays (see above). It consisted of a series of photostimulation trials lasting 10 s, or until the animal withdrew from the stimulation chamber, whichever occurred first. Trials were repeated at 10-s intervals. If the animal withdrew from the training chamber during a photostimulation trial, the next trial was administered after the animal spontaneously re-entered the stimulation chamber. Over the 20-min training period, animals that initially exhibited freezing or activity bursts in the photostimulation chamber during the first few training trials eventually responded to photostimulation during later trials by rapid withdrawal from the IPS/training chamber."

Early lesion or other inhibitory manipulations of VMHdm produced conflicting results regarding the valence of its role in defensive behaviors (<a href=\"#bib112\">Turner et al., 1967</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Grossman, 1970</a>, <a href=\"#bib55\">1972</a>; <a href=\"#bib117\">Weisman and Hamilton, 1972</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Colpaert, 1975</a>).

A caveat however, is that our genetically targeted ablation may have caused damage to neighboring populations of neurons, in a non cell-autonomous manner, and that such \u2018collateral damage\u2019, if it occurred, could contribute to some of the phenotypes reported here. However, our demonstration that the number of Esr1<sup>+</sup> cells in the adjacent VMHvl and neighboring ARH is quantitatively unaffected following ablation suggests that this possibility is less likely. Furthermore, the observed reduction in predator defense behavior caused by ablation of SF1<sup>+</sup> neurons (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>) is similar to the effect of chemogenetic inhibition of these neurons reported earlier (although the behavioral metrics were different) (<a href=\"#bib104\">Silva et al., 2013</a>).

Whether this scalable control is achieved through an increase in ensemble size and activity within a homogenous population of SF1<sup>+</sup> neurons, or reflects different subpopulations with different thresholds for activation (<a href=\"#bib72\">Lee et al., 2014</a>), will be an interesting topic for future study. Whatever the answer, the observation that a common circuit node can control multiple defensive behaviors, according to its level of activity, argues against alternative views invoking parallel processing models, in which anatomically distinct pathways control different types of behavioral responses depending on cues or contexts (<a href=\"#bib45\">Fanselow, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Mobbs et al., 2007</a>)."

This observation suggests that the brain may be able to integrate the cumulative effects of SF1<sup>+</sup> neuron activation over time, in a manner that changes the type of defensive behavioral output as different thresholds are reached. Such an integrative function is consistent with our observation that activation of these cells produces persistent behavioral effects, as persistent activity is a hallmark of neural integrators (<a href=\"#bib77\">Major and Tank, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Goldman et al., 2007</a>). Alternatively, the transition from freezing to activity burst in our experiments might reflect a time-dependent inactivation or habituation of freezing neurons during photostimulation, which in turn releases from inhibition a second population that controls the activity burst in an antagonistic manner. Whatever the explanation, the ability of SF1<sup>+</sup> neurons to integrate signals that change in their quality or intensity over time could allow an animal to express an appropriate behavioral response (freezing, escape) as a predator threat escalates, as encapsulated by \u2018Predatory Imminence\u2019 theories (<a href=\"#bib48\">Fanselow and Lester, 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Blanchard and Blanchard, 1989b</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Blanchard et al., 1998</a>, <a href=\"#bib16\">2003a</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">McNaughton and Corr, 2004</a>).

These observations argue that the prevailing, \u2018amygdalo-centric\u2019 view of emotion systems should be expanded to include specific hypothalamic structures such as VMHdm, and its associated circuitry (see below). While the VMHdm/c receives input from the anteriodorsal and posterioventral regions of the medial amygdala (MEAad and MeApv) (<a href=\"#bib43\">Dong and Swanson, 2004</a>) and the basomedial amygdala (BMA) (<a href=\"#bib92\">Petrovich et al., 2001</a>), recent data suggest that MeA functions primarily to encode sensory cues (<a href=\"#bib11\">Bergan et al., 2014</a>). If so, then the transformation of such sensory input into an internal emotion state may, arguably, be carried out primarily at the level of VMHdm, or other interconnected hypothalamic nuclei (<a href=\"#bib97\">Risold et al., 1994</a>), rather than in the amygdala itself. It should be noted the VMHdm also receives strong projections from the lateral parabrachial (PB) area, which transmits noxious stimuli (<a href=\"#bib12\">Bester et al., 1997</a>); these projections may also provide sensory input to VMHdm important in the encoding of emotion states."

However, high-resolution anatomical mapping of SF1<sup>+</sup> neurons indicates that recurrent projections to amygdala nuclei are relatively weak (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and <a href=\"http://connectivity.brain-map.org\">http//:connectivity.brain-map.org</a>, VMH, Nr5a1-Cre experiments 114290225 and 182337561, sections 64\u201382). This issue could be addressed, in principle, by combining bilateral activation of SF1<sup>+</sup> neurons with bilateral lesions of the amygdala. However such an experiment is challenging in mice because of the relatively small size of their brain, and the highly invasive nature of such an experiment. Thus, while descending input from the MEA is likely to contribute to VMHdm/c activation during defensive responses in an unmanipulated animal, our data show that one can experimentally bypass such amygdala input and evoke a persistent emotion state by direct activation of SF1<sup>+</sup> neurons."

Therefore the ability of SF1<sup>+</sup> neuronal activation to implement a persistent emotion state could be mediated by other nodes in this circuitry, rather than within VMHdm itself. VMHdm/c SF1<sup>+</sup> neurons send projections to the BNST, AHN, lateral hypothalamus (LHA), PMd, MeA and dorsal peri-aqueductal gray (dPAG), as well as to other structures (see <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>; <a href=\"#media9\">Video 9, 10</a>) (<a href=\"#bib31\">Canteras et al., 1994</a>).

This state of apparent threat arousal or defensive motivation may share properties in common with the emotions that humans subjectively experience as \u2018fear\u2019 or \u2018anxiety\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib94\">Phelps and LeDoux, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">LeDoux, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Adolphs, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Anderson and Adolphs, 2014</a>). While these results raise many important and unanswered mechanistic questions at the level of connectivity and neuronal activity dynamics, at the very least they should prompt a re-evaluation of the prevailing, \u2018amygdalo-centric\u2019 view of emotion control systems, by providing evidence that the hypothalamus is not simply a passive relay or effector of amygdala output, but can serve to implement a central emotion state itself."

One chamber side was covered with black plastic and fine mesh flooring while the other side was left white and had coarse mesh flooring. The different sides were also distinguished by odor (2.5% of Acetophenone or ethyl acetate). CPA testing was carried out over 2 days. Day 1 involved a 5-min pre-training session to habituate animals to the apparatus and to determine each mouse's place preference. Animals that showed more than 90% of preference during pre-training were excluded from the analysis. Each animal was pseudo-randomly placed in one side (counterbalanced across mice). This was followed by a 20-min \u2018conditioning\u2019 session in which blue light stimulation (20 Hz 20 ms, 10 s on and 10 s off, 5.5 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>) was administered in the preferred side until the mouse returned to the non-preferred side.

This new discussion highlights the potential role of the dPAG in encoding or mediating emotion states. In this context, we have included a new supplemental figure (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) to illustrate the major projections of SF1<sup>+</sup> VMH neurons to different brain structures, based on publicly available data in the Allen Brain Mouse Connectivity Atlas database (<a href=\"http://connectivity.brain-map.org/\">http://connectivity.brain-map.org</a>), which consists of serial two-photon tomographic reconstructions of Nr5a1-Cre (SF1-Cre) mouse brains injected with a Cre-dependent AAV expressing GFP. We have used the Allen Brain Atlas Brain Explorer 2 program to computationally reconstruct and render in 3D the projections of SF1<sup>+</sup> neurons to their major targets (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>; <a href=\"#media9\">Videos 9 and 10</a>).

Furthermore, we point out that the effect of this ablation to reduce predator avoidance is similar to the phenotype that was reported by <a href=\"#bib104\">Silva et al. (2013)</a>, using hM4DREADD as an independent method to silence SF1<sup>+</sup> neurons. Therefore, we feel confident that the loss-of-function phenotypes we report are indeed due to the loss of SF1<sup>+</sup> neurons, and not to \u201ccollateral damage\u201d to other neighboring cell populations."

Many of the older studies we were asked to cite used pharmacological methods for activation or inhibition that lacked cellular specificity and spatial resolution or, in cases where electrical stimulation or lesioning was used, could not exclude a role for fibers of passage. Moreover, activation and inhibition manipulations were reported in different studies from different laboratories, using different species and different behavioral assays, making direct comparisons difficult. We have performed both optogenetic activation, and targeted ablation, of a genetically defined subset of VMHdm/c neurons, in mice, using an extensive battery of behavioral assays. Our data argue that the function of SF1<sup>+</sup> neurons is not restricted to predator defense per se, but rather that this population controls defensive behaviors in different contexts containing different types of threats (for example, in anxiety assays). These issues are now discussed in the Discussion section."

In contrast, our study is the first (to our knowledge) to provide evidence of an emotion state in an animal model using a set of objective and general features, common to different emotions within a species and to similar emotions across species (<a href=\"#bib6\">Anderson and Adolphs, 2014</a>), which are independent of anthropocentric homologies and verbal report."
