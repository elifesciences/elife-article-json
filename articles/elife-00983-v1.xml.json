Here, we report that activation of the transcription factor BZR1 is required and sufficient for suppression of immune signaling by brassinosteroids (BR). BZR1 induces the expression of several WRKY transcription factors that negatively control early immune responses. In addition, BZR1 associates with WRKY40 to mediate the antagonism between BR and immune signaling. We reveal that BZR1-mediated inhibition of immunity is particularly relevant when plant fast growth is required, such as during etiolation. Thus, BZR1 acts as an important regulator mediating the trade-off between growth and immunity upon integration of environmental cues."

Here, we report that activation of the transcription factor BZR1 is required and sufficient for suppression of immune signaling by brassinosteroids (BR). BZR1 induces the expression of several WRKY transcription factors that negatively control early immune responses. In addition, BZR1 associates with WRKY40 to mediate the antagonism between BR and immune signaling. We reveal that BZR1-mediated inhibition of immunity is particularly relevant when plant fast growth is required, such as during etiolation. Thus, BZR1 acts as an important regulator mediating the trade-off between growth and immunity upon integration of environmental cues."

A key aspect of plant immunity is the perception of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by surface-localized pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs), leading to PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI) (<a href=\"#bib11\">Dodds and Rathjen, 2010</a>). PRRs of the leucine-rich repeat receptor kinases (LRR-RKs) class rely on the regulatory LRR-RK BAK1 (BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 1-ASSOCIATED KINASE 1) for signaling (<a href=\"#bib23\">Monaghan and Zipfel, 2012</a>); that is the case of FLS2 (FLAGELLIN SENSITIVE 2) and EFR (EF-TU RECEPTOR), which perceive bacterial flagellin (or the active peptide flg22) and EF-Tu (or the active peptide elf18) respectively. BAK1 also interacts with the LRR-RK BRI1 (BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 1), the main receptor for the growth-promoting steroid hormones brassinosteroids (BR), and is a positive regulator of BR-mediated growth (<a href=\"#bib20\">Kim and Wang, 2010</a>). Hence, a crosstalk between the BR- and PAMP-triggered signaling pathways resulting from competition for BAK1 was hypothesized. While a unidirectional antagonism between BR and PTI signaling has been recently described in Arabidopsis (<a href=\"#bib1\">Albrecht et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Belkhadir et al., 2012</a>), the exact underlying mechanisms are still controversial. Activation of the BR signaling pathway via either transgenic overexpression of <i>BRI1</i> or the BR biosynthetic gene <i>DWF4</i> or expression of the activated BRI1 allele <i>BRI1</i><sup><i>sud</i></sup> suppresses PTI outputs (<a href=\"#bib5\">Belkhadir et al., 2012</a>). One such output, the PAMP-triggered callose deposition, could be restored by over-expression of <i>BAK1-HA</i>, suggesting that BAK1 is a limiting factor (<a href=\"#bib5\">Belkhadir et al., 2012</a>). However, exogenous BR treatment of wild-type plants does not affect the FLS2-BAK1 complex formation upon FLS2 activation, while it results in decreased PTI responses (<a href=\"#bib1\">Albrecht et al., 2012</a>)."

Upon treatment with flg22, FLS2 associated normally with BAK1 in these transgenic plants, and neither FLS2 nor BAK1 accumulation was altered (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Moreover, these plants displayed a weaker reactive oxygen species (ROS) burst in response to chitin (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), whose signaling pathway is BAK1-independent (<a href=\"#bib41\">Shan et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Ranf et al., 2011</a>). This result is consistent with the previous finding that exogenous BR treatment can also inhibit the chitin-induced ROS burst (<a href=\"#bib1\">Albrecht et al., 2012</a>). BAK1-HA is not fully functional in BR signaling and exerts a dominant-negative effect on the endogenous BAK1 (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>), which may explain that introduction of the <i>BAK1-HA</i> transgene can override the suppression of immunity triggered by overexpression of <i>BRI1</i> (<a href=\"#bib5\">Belkhadir et al., 2012</a>); BAK1-HA does not exert such a dominant negative effect, however, on PTI signaling (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>).

After BR perception by BRI1 and activation of the BRI1-BAK1 complex, the BR signal transduction cascade includes inactivation of BIN2 (BR INSENSITIVE 2) and BIN2-like kinases, a family of GSK3-like kinases acting as negative regulators of the pathway (<a href=\"#bib44\">Vert and Chory, 2006</a>). This leads to dephosphorylation of BZR1 (BRASSINAZOLE RESISTANT 1) and BES1/BZR2 (BRI1-EMS-SUPPRESSOR 1/BRASSINAZOLE RESISTANT 2), two bHLH transcription factors acting as major regulators of BR-induced transcriptional changes, which then become active (<a href=\"#bib46\">Wang et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Yin et al., 2002</a>). Treatment with the chemicals LiCl and bikinin, which inhibit GSK3-like kinases (<a href=\"#bib10\">De Rybel et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Yan et al., 2009</a>), resulted in impaired flg22-triggered ROS burst (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>), as observed upon genetic or ligand-induced activation of the BR pathway. Furthermore, a triple mutant in <i>BIN2</i> and the two closest related GSK3-like kinases, <i>BIL1</i> (<i>BIN2-LIKE 1</i>) and <i>BIL2</i> (triple GSK3 mutant; <a href=\"#bib44\">Vert and Chory, 2006</a>), shows a similar impairment in response to either flg22 or chitin (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Interestingly, in spite of regulating MAPKs involved in stomata development (<a href=\"#bib19\">Kim et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Khan et al., 2013</a>), neither BR treatment nor loss of function of BIN2 affect flg22-triggered MAPK activation (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), contrary to what has been recently suggested (<a href=\"#bib9\">Choudhary et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Zhu et al., 2013</a>).

Induction of BR signaling by bikinin treatment still represses elf18-induced ROS burst in the BRI1 mutant <i>bri1-5</i> (we used elf18 in this experiment because <i>bri1-5</i> is in the Ws-2 background, which is a natural <i>fls2</i> mutant) (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3C</a>). <i>bri1-5/BZR1\u0394</i> plants (<a href=\"#bib13\">Gampala et al., 2007</a>) still exhibited reduced PAMP-triggered ROS burst (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>), and treatment with the BR biosynthetic inhibitor brassinazole (BRZ) did not affect the <i>BZR1\u0394</i> effect (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3D</a>). Interestingly, BRZ treatment of wild-type Col-0 plants results in increased ROS production (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3D</a>), which is consistent with the fact that BR inhibits PTI responses and suggests that endogenous concentrations of the hormone exert this effect. These results demonstrate that activation of BZR1 affects PTI signaling independently of BR perception or synthesis."

The W-box motif is the binding site for the WRKY family of transcription factors (<a href=\"#bib36\">Rushton et al., 2010</a>), and several members of this family are BR-regulated BZR1-targets (<a href=\"#tbl5\">Table 5</a>).

Notably, <i>wrky11</i>, <i>wrky15</i>, <i>wrky18</i> and <i>wrky70</i> mutants displayed enhanced PAMP-triggered ROS (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>), suggesting that these transcription factors act as negative regulators of early PTI signaling.

The over-representation of the W-box motif among BZR1 targets (<a href=\"#tbl7\">Table 7</a>) suggests that BZR1 may interact with WRKY transcription factors (such as WRKY40) to cooperatively regulate transcription. <i>WRKY40</i> has been described as a negative regulator of defense against biotrophic pathogens and insects (<a href=\"#bib50\">Xu et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Pandey et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Brotman et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Schon et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Schweizer et al., 2013</a>).

Strikingly, <i>wrky40</i> plants are partially impaired in the BR-mediated suppression of PAMP-triggered ROS (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>), suggesting that WRKY40 may act coordinately with BZR1 to suppress immunity. Indeed, we found that BZR1 associates with WRKY40, but not WRKY6, in co-immunoprecipitation experiments when transiently co-expressed in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> leaves (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>) or Arabidopsis protoplasts (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>).

                        "text": "BZR1, together with DELLAs and PIF4, is part of a core transcription module that integrates hormonal (gibberellin [GA] and BR) and environmental (light) signals (<a href=\"#bib12\">Gallego-Bartolome et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Li et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Oh et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Bai et al., 2012b</a>). In the dark, BZR1 is activated by endogenous BR and GA to promote growth, partially through the synergistic interaction with PIF4 (<a href=\"#bib15\">Jaillais and Vert, 2012</a>). Because etiolation requires rapid growth, we hypothesized that plants may prioritize growth over immunity in dark conditions. In fact, we found that PAMP-triggered SGI was partially impaired in dark-grown seedlings (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013D</a>). This impairment was abolished in the BR-insensitive mutants <i>bri1-301</i> and <i>bin2-1</i> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>), indicating that BR signaling is responsible for the dark-induced suppression of this PTI response. Activation of BZR1 in the <i>BZR1\u0394</i> line mimicked the dark-induced suppression of SGI in both light and dark (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). However, activation of BES1 in the <i>BES1</i><sup><i>S171A</i></sup> line did not impact SGI (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>). Consistent with the previous results, exogenous BR treatment suppressed SGI in both light and dark (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2B,C</a>). While treatment with GA alone did not have a dramatic effect on SGI, co-treatment with BL and GA resulted in an enhancement of the BR-mediated suppression of SGI (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>), indicating an additive effect of these two hormones when applied together. Moreover, treatment with the GA synthesis inhibitors paclobutrazol (PAC) or uniconazole (Uni) abolished the effect of BL on SGI (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2B,C</a>), and this effect was reduced in the GA biosynthetic mutant <i>ga1-3</i> (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Taken together, these results demonstrate that BR suppress at least one PTI output, SGI, in the dark in a GA-dependent manner, most likely through activation of BZR1. Notably, although the <i>wrky40</i> mutant undergoes etiolation normally (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2D</a>), it shows a diminished suppression of SGI in the dark (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2D</a>), supporting the idea that WRKY40 is required for the BZR1-mediated inhibition of PTI."

In this work, we show that activation of one of two major BR-activated transcription factors, BZR1, is sufficient to suppress PTI, measured as PAMP-triggered ROS production, PAMP-triggered gene expression, SGI or induced resistance (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1 and 2</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Of note, another PTI output, MAPK activation, is not affected by activation of the BR pathway (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). BR treatment results in BZR1-dependent changes in the expression of defense-related genes, among which several members of the WRKY family of transcription factors can be found. Because the promoters of BR-regulated defense-related genes are enriched in the W-box motif (<a href=\"#tbl4\">Table 4</a>), BZR1-targeted <i>WRKY</i> transcription factors could be responsible for a secondary wave of transcription, ultimately leading to the suppression of PTI. In agreement with this idea, a subset of <i>WRKY</i>s induced by BR (<i>WRKY11</i>, <i>WRKY15</i> and <i>WRKY18</i>) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>) act as negative regulators of PAMP-triggered ROS, potentially by controlling the steady-state expression of genes encoding components required for this response. The over-representation of the W-box motif among the BZR1 targets (<a href=\"#tbl7\">Table 7</a>) raises the possibility that, additionally, WRKY transcription factors could also act together with BZR1 to cooperatively regulate gene expression. We found that WRKY40 associates with BZR1 directly or indirectly in planta (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,D</a>); in the absence of WRKY40, the BR-mediated suppression of PAMP-triggered ROS burst is partially impaired (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Therefore, WRKYs may play a dual role in the BZR1-mediated suppression of defense, as both co- and secondary regulators of defense gene expression. Given that the loss of BR-mediated suppression of PAMP-triggered ROS burst in the <i>wrky40</i> mutant is only partial, BZR1 may interact with other members of the WRKY family, such as WRKY18 or WRKY60, to repress immunity."

All together, these results illustrate that BZR1 controls the expression of transcription factors (e.g. WRKY11, WRKY15, WRKY18 and HBI1), which themselves might control the expression of PTI components (see model in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>) whose identities remain to be identified."

                        "text": "Plants need to finely regulate allocation of resources upon integration of environmental cues, both biotic and abiotic, in order to rapidly and readily adapt to changing conditions and ensure survival in a cost-efficient manner. Dark conditions impose an energetic limitation due to lack of photo-assimilates; in this situation, the restoration of normal photosynthesis by reaching light is an essential requirement to guarantee perpetuation, and as such must be given priority (<a href=\"#bib8\">Casal, 2013</a>). We hypothesize that when plants face conditions that require rapid growth, such as when germinating in soil or when under a canopy, limited resources are invested in this developmental process at the expense of immunity in what must be a quantitative choice. Indeed, we show that etiolated seedlings do not arrest their growth in response to PAMPs as light-grown seedlings do, as measured by total fresh weight (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013D</a>). In addition, BR signaling, acting cooperatively with GA signaling, is required for the dark-induced suppression of this PTI response (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), and activation of BZR1 is sufficient to exert this effect regardless of light conditions (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Although seedlings were used in these experiments due to technical reasons, BR also regulate growth at later developmental stages, so this phenomenon may be more general. Based on these findings, we propose a model in which BZR1 regulates the expression of defense genes, assisted by WRKY40 (and potentially other WRKYs), ultimately resulting in a quantitative suppression of immunity (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). Because the activation status of BZR1 depends on BR, GA and light signaling, BZR1 would act as a molecular integrator of these inputs to effectively regulate the trade-off between growth and immunity."

Furthermore, we requested previously published materials, such as <i>LOX2::GUS</i> and <i>LOX2::LUC</i> constructs or transgenic lines; but, unfortunately, these tools either are not available anymore or can no longer be used due to severe silencing of both reporter constructs. While the Kombrink lab is currently generating these tools again, we also considered making a <i>LOX2::LUC</i> construct ourselves. However, the expression of this reporter transgene has been previously reported to be quasi undetectable in the absence of exogenous MeJA treatment (Jensen et al., Plant J 2002), which would make the suggested experiment (i.e., testing whether BZR1+WRKY40 inhibit LOX2 expression more potently than BZR1 or WRKY40 alone) extremely technically challenging. For these different reasons, we have decided to omit the results on LOX2 expression from the revised manuscript. Nevertheless, the results provided still convincingly show that BZR1 acts together with WRKY40 both genetically (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>) and biochemically (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C\u2013E</a>) to regulate the BR-mediated inhibition of PTI.
