In <i>Drosophila</i>, song is detected by antennal mechanosensory neurons and further processed by second-order aPN1/aLN(al) neurons. However, little is known about the central pathways mediating courtship hearing. In this study, we identified a male-specific pathway for courtship hearing via third-order ventrolateral protocerebrum Projection Neuron 1 (vPN1) neurons and fourth-order pC1 neurons. Genetic inactivation of vPN1 or pC1 disrupts song-induced male-chaining behavior. Calcium imaging reveals that vPN1 responds preferentially to pulse song with long inter-pulse intervals (IPIs), while pC1 responses to pulse song closely match the behavioral chaining responses at different IPIs. Moreover, genetic activation of either vPN1 or pC1 induced courtship chaining, mimicking the behavioral response to song. These results outline the aPN1-vPN1-pC1 pathway as a labeled line for the processing and transformation of courtship song in males."

Calcium imaging reveals that vPN1 responds preferentially to pulse song with long inter-pulse intervals (IPIs), while pC1 responses to pulse song closely match the behavioral chaining responses at different IPIs. Moreover, genetic activation of either vPN1 or pC1 induced courtship chaining, mimicking the behavioral response to song. These results outline the aPN1-vPN1-pC1 pathway as a labeled line for the processing and transformation of courtship song in males."

Here, we are particularly focused on auditory communication, which requires the production and perception of sound signals that are diversified between species and are utilized by both invertebrates and vertebrates to attract female mates during courtship (<a href=\"#bib37\">Murthy, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Brainard and Doupe, 2013</a>). <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> males sing a multi-part, species-specific courtship song that is both critical to female receptivity and encourages courtship by nearby males. Although there has been progress in elucidating the circuitry by which these signals are perceived, processed, and integrated with other sensory cues to elicit stereotyped courtship behaviors, there are very significant gaps in our knowledge."

Ecologically, this response is appropriate for the context of competitive courtship on fruit substrates. Experimentally, stimulation of groups of males with synthetic courtship song can induce both locomotion and chains of males engaging in the initial stages of courtship. This response (distinct from the unstimulated and dysregulated courtship observed in <i>fru</i> mutant males) has been used to investigate the genetic and neural mechanisms underlying auditory detection (<a href=\"#bib12\">Eberl et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Kamikouchi et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Vaughan et al., 2014</a>).

Across different <i>Drosophila</i> species, the antennal receiver is tuned to the conspecific IPF (<a href=\"#bib46\">Riabinina et al., 2011</a>), and behavioral responses appear tuned to the conspecific IPI (<a href=\"#bib15\">Ewing and Bennet-Clark, 1968</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Cowling and Burnet, 1981</a>). While mechanical features of the antenna may have evolved to optimally detect conspecific IPFs, it has been hypothesized that the brain is responsible for recognizing conspecific IPIs (<a href=\"#bib46\">Riabinina et al., 2011</a>). Therefore, we asked whether song-induced chaining behavior of <i>D. melanogaster</i> males varied as a function of song IPI (<a href=\"#bib54\">Schilcher, 1976b</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Yoon et al., 2013</a>). Indeed, the chaining response was significantly higher for songs at 35-ms IPI than for all other IPIs, across a wide range of intensities (p &lt; 0.05, 72.5\u201385 dB, Wilcoxon rank-sum test; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,C</a>), suggesting that <i>D. melanogaster</i> males to some extent are able to preferentially respond to pulse song of their own species. A similar effect was observed using intermittent song stimuli (80 dB; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D,E</a>). We therefore used this assay to test the behavioral role of aPN1, vPN1, and pC1 populations."

To further investigate the directionality of information flow in the aPN1-vPN1-pC1 pathway, we have used DenMark and Syt::GFP for post- and pre-synaptic labeling of vPN1 and pC1 neurons, respectively. The dendrites of vPN1 target the WED region, and vPN1 axonal termini ramify extensively in the LPC region (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). Both dendrites and axons of pC1 are observed within the LPC region (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>), and vPN1 axons overlap with pC1 dendrites when registered in a standard brain (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>).

By expressing spGFP11 in aPN1 neurons and spGFP1-10 in vPN1 neurons, we observed significant GRASP signal in the WED region (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>), suggesting the connections between aPN1 and vPN1.

One possibility to explain this is that <i>71G01-LexA</i> only label a subset of pC1 neurons, and given that pC1 neurons are likely to be heterogeneous (<a href=\"#bib67\">Zhou et al., 2014</a>), the <i>71G01-LexA</i>-labeled pC1 neurons may not include the pC1 auditory neurons that synapse with vPN1 neurons. Alternatively, it might be that the neurites of vPN1 and pC1 in the LPC region is too diffuse to allow reliable detection of the GRASP signal.

First, the arborizations of pC1 neurons match very closely with the projection of vPN1 neurons in the LPC, and optogenetic activation of vPN1 generates robust activity in pC1. Second, pC1 neurons show calcium responses to pulse song stimuli, with IPI tuning that matches that of the behavioral response. Third, silencing pC1 neurons in male flies almost completely abolishes song-induced chaining, while activation induces robust chaining in the absence of song. We therefore conclude that vPN1 may carry song stimuli to activate pC1, where these stimuli are integrated with other sensory modalities such as pheromonal olfactory and gustatory cues to modulate the courtship level in males (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8F</a>)."

However, the pC1 auditory response cannot be easily explained by the dimorphism of vPN1, which responds to pulse song in males but is absent in females. Moreover, the absence of vPN1 in females begs the question of how pC1 receives song information in females. One explanation comes from the observation that vPN1 is a subset of the <i>fru</i>+ aSP-k clone (<a href=\"#bib6\">Cachero et al., 2010</a>). aSP-k shows arborization in VLP and the LPC ring in both male and females, as well as male-specific innervation of the LPC arch that corresponds with vPN1 morphology.

Blue LEDs provide constant background illumination to allow flies to see each other, as male chaining behavior depends on the ability to visually tracking other flies. Because CsChrimson is also sensitive to blue light, we kept the blue light at a very low level (0.001 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>) to make sure that no chaining behavior was triggered with only blue light illumination. The intensity and frequency of high-power red LEDs were controlled with a Teensy 2.0 microcontroller using MATLAB software. Light intensity was measured by placing an optical power meter (PM100D, Thorlabs, NJ, United States) nearby the location of chaining chambers. Fly behavior was recorded by a Stingray camera equipped with a Tokina infrared filter under 880-nm LED illumination (SL1236, Advanced Illumination, VT, United States) to avoid the interference from red and blue LEDs."

A group of eight males with the same genotype were gently aspirated into a culture dish (430165, 35 mm \u00d7 10 mm, Corning, NY, United States) containing fly food at the bottom. Videotaping and red light stimulation were triggered simultaneously with a MATLAB interface for a total duration of 5 min. Videos were scored using LifesongX software. The percentage of time when at least three flies are in a courtship chain was calculated to quantify the chaining behavior induced by CsChrimson activation."

The brain and ventral nerve cord were taken out of the fly and laid on a poly-lysine-coated coverslip. The dissection was realized using the minimum level of illumination possible to avoid spurious activation of CsChrimson. Brains were then continuously perfused in the same saline at 60 ml/hr throughout the experiment. Imaging was done on a two-photon scanning microscope (PrairieTechnologies, Bruker). Excitation wavelength was 920 nm. CsChrimson was excited with 50-Hz trains of 2-ms 590-nm light pulses via a LED shining through the objective. Instantaneous powers measured out of the objective ranged between 50 \u03bcW/mm<sup>2</sup> and 700 \u03bcW/mm<sup>2</sup>. Experiments usually started with a 50 pulses train at 50 \u03bcW/mm<sup>2</sup>. If no response could be seen, the power was raised progressively until a response could be seen or the maximum power was reached.

Zhou et al. identify third and fourth order neurons in the fly brain that respond to courtship song. They beautifully demonstrate the connectivity of the neurons, their responsiveness to sound, and their involvement in male courtship behavior. Strikingly these synaptically connected neurons are both necessary and sufficient to mediate the male response to courtship song. The manuscript is well written, the experiments well executed and the conclusions are appropriate and make an exciting advance to the field. This work parallels another recent publication by the same group looking at the female equivalent pathway."

We have now conducted GRASP experiments (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) and found that reconstituted GFP signals are present between aPN1 and vPN1 neurons but barely detectable between vPN1 and pC1 neurons. One possibility could be that the projections of vPN1 and pC1 neurons in the LPC region are relatively diffuse, posing a great challenge for GRASP detection. We should also note that the <i>71G01-LexA</i> driver used for GRASP only labels a small subset of pC1 neurons, while the intersection of <i>71G01-LexA</i> and <i>dsx</i><sup><i>GAL4</i></sup> actually labels a broader group of pC1 neurons. The higher number of pC1 neurons labeled by the intersectional approach is likely due to flip-out of the stop cassette during early developmental time-points that might transiently express<i>71G01-LexA</i>. Thus, <i>71G01-LexA</i> alone may not label the subset of auditory pC1 neurons that synapse with vPN1 neurons. Nonetheless, we acknowledge that our data do not prove that aPN1-vPN1-pC1 neurons are mono-synaptically connected, and we have carefully revised the text to reflect this."

We think it is likely that the early temporal code in JON/aPN1 is transformed into a rate code within vPN1/PC1.
