The nematode <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> and its natural pathogen, the positive-strand RNA virus Orsay, have recently emerged as a new animal model of host-virus interaction. Using a genome-wide association study in <i>C. elegans</i> wild populations and quantitative trait locus mapping, we identify a 159 base-pair deletion in the conserved <i>drh-1</i> gene (encoding a RIG-I-like helicase) as a major determinant of viral sensitivity. We show that DRH-1 is required for the initiation of an antiviral RNAi pathway and the generation of virus-derived siRNAs (viRNAs). In mammals, RIG-I-domain containing proteins trigger an interferon-based innate immunity pathway in response to RNA virus infection. Our work in <i>C. elegans</i> demonstrates that the RIG-I domain has an ancient role in viral recognition. We propose that RIG-I acts as modular viral recognition factor that couples viral recognition to different effector pathways including RNAi and interferon responses."

The nematode <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> and its natural pathogen, the positive-strand RNA virus Orsay, have recently emerged as a new animal model of host-virus interaction. Using a genome-wide association study in <i>C. elegans</i> wild populations and quantitative trait locus mapping, we identify a 159 base-pair deletion in the conserved <i>drh-1</i> gene (encoding a RIG-I-like helicase) as a major determinant of viral sensitivity. We show that DRH-1 is required for the initiation of an antiviral RNAi pathway and the generation of virus-derived siRNAs (viRNAs). In mammals, RIG-I-domain containing proteins trigger an interferon-based innate immunity pathway in response to RNA virus infection. Our work in <i>C. elegans</i> demonstrates that the RIG-I domain has an ancient role in viral recognition. We propose that RIG-I acts as modular viral recognition factor that couples viral recognition to different effector pathways including RNAi and interferon responses."

Whilst adaptive immunity is specific to vertebrates, innate mechanisms are present in all multicellular organisms, allowing cells to recognize specific pathogens and instigate appropriate responses. RNA viruses are important pathogens of many multicellular organisms, which replicate without a DNA intermediate using RNA dependent RNA polymerase. Successful neutralization of invading RNA viruses by cells thus requires the viral genome to be recognized within the sea of endogenous RNA."

Viral recognition by RIG-I and MDA-5 triggers activation of downstream signaling, mediated by the proteins\u2019 N-terminal CARD domains, and results in the activation of the interferon pathway (<a href=\"#bib59\">Yoneyama et al., 2004</a>). Initial recognition of viral RNA is likely to be mediated by the DExD/H-box helicase domain and the C-terminal RIG-I domain. Though the precise ligands that activate RIG-I family proteins are not fully defined, MDA-5 appears to bind long dsRNA (<a href=\"#bib22\">Gitlin et al., 2006</a>), whilst RIG-I seems to recognize the 5\u2032 end of double stranded RNA, but only if it has a 5\u2032 triphosphate (<a href=\"#bib41\">Pichlmair et al., 2006</a>). As all known RNA polymerases leave a triphosphate at the 5\u2032 end of newly synthesized RNA, the presence of a 5\u2032 triphosphate is likely to be a signature of RNA virus replication and thus allow viral replication intermediates to be distinguished from endogenous mRNA, which will predominantly display a 5\u2032 cap (<a href=\"#bib43\">Rehwinkel and Reis e Sousa, 2010</a>)."

The initial step in protection against positive strand RNA virus infection in plants and insects is detection and subsequent cleavage of the double-stranded replication intermediate by members of the Dicer family of endonucleases. Insects and plants possess dedicated Dicer enzymes responsible specifically for this antiviral response, Dicer-like 4 (and to a lesser extent Dicer-like 1) in plants, and Dicer2 in insects (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bouch\u00e9 et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Deleris et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Fusaro et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Galiana-Arnoux et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">van Rij et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Diaz-Pendon et al., 2007</a>).

However, exposing <i>C. elegans</i> to virus-derived dsRNA using transgenes or infection with mammalian viruses also triggers an RNAi response (<a href=\"#bib32\">Lu et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Schott et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Wilkins et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Yigit et al., 2006</a>). Additionally, we have shown previously that this response is also initiated upon infection with a positive strand RNA virus, named the Orsay virus, which infects <i>C. elegans</i> in the wild through horizontal transmission. Disruption of this pathway through mutation of the core components of the RNAi machinery results in greatly increased viral infection levels. Interestingly, the Orsay virus infects a wild isolate named JU1580 (from which the Orsay virus was isolated) to much higher levels than the N2 strain (<a href=\"#bib16\">F\u00e9lix et al., 2011</a>)."

The three RIG-I family members do not contain the CARD domains required for interferon induction; consistently they have yet to be implicated in signaling pathways. However, they do possess the RIG-I C-terminal domain and the helicase domains, potentially enabling them to recognize viral RNA. So far study of these genes has connected them to the RNA interference response. DRH-1 was initially characterized as a protein interacting with DCR-1, RDE-1 and RDE-4 (<a href=\"#bib52\">Tabara et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Duchaine et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Sijen et al., 2007</a>). RNAi of <i>drh-1</i> was not found to be required for RNAi per se but result in a defect in RNAi of a second gene (<a href=\"#bib52\">Tabara et al., 2002</a>), however it remains unclear whether this effect was solely due to knockdown of <i>drh-1</i>. More recent studies did not observe defects in endogenous or exogenous small RNA pathways in <i>drh-1</i> mutants (<a href=\"#bib23\">Gu et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Lu et al., 2009</a>). However, <i>drh-1</i> mutants were found to be defective in the silencing of a flockhouse virus-derived replicon (<a href=\"#bib33\">Lu et al., 2009</a>). <i>drh-1</i> and <i>drh-2</i> are the result of a recent gene duplication event that occurred after the last common ancestor of <i>C. elegans</i> and its closest known sister clade including <i>C. briggsae</i> (<a href=\"http://www.wormbase.org\">www.wormbase.org</a>) (<a href=\"#bib50\">Stein et al., 2003</a>), and <i>drh-2</i> is the upstream gene in an operon containing <i>drh-1</i>. <i>drh-2</i> has lost some of its functional domains due to frame-shift mutations and its function remains unclear, although it has been suggested to act as a negative regulator of RNAi (<a href=\"#bib33\">Lu et al., 2009</a>). DRH-3 is required for endogenous small RNA pathways in the germline and efficient exogenous RNAi (<a href=\"#bib23\">Gu et al., 2009</a>), and is found in at least two distinct protein complexes including the <span class=\"underline\">ERI</span> <span class=\"underline\">C</span>omplex (ERIC) (<a href=\"#bib23\">Gu et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Thivierge et al., 2012</a>). Thus, an intriguing possibility is that RIG-I family genes in <i>C. elegans</i> initiate RNAi rather than the interferon response."

However, in laboratory conditions, we found that viral infection leads to delayed and decreased total progeny of JU1580 and <i>drh-1(ok3495)</i> mutant animals relative to uninfected animals, whilst infection of N2 had no significant effect (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Furthermore, we performed a competition experiment between N2 and JU2196, which contains the <i>drh-1</i> region from JU1580 introgressed into the N2 background (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). N2 rapidly outcompetes JU2196 in the presence of viral infection, but not its absence, confirming that the increased viral infection resulting from the <i>drh-1</i> deletion is indeed detrimental for fitness (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). In the absence of viral infection, we could not detect in standard laboratory conditions over 10 generations of competition any positive or negative effect of the <i>drh-1</i> deletion and the introgressed surrounding region. Thus the natural <i>drh-1</i> deletion impairs fitness only in the presence of viral infection."

This region presents three main haplotypes among the 97 wild isolates (<a href=\"#bib2\">Andersen et al., 2012</a>): the N2 haplotype, the JU1580 haplotype and a distant haplotypic group (including RW7000 and QX1211), as well as a few recombinants (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). The <i>drh-1(niDf250</i>) allele is exclusively found in isolates carrying the JU1580 haplotype in the 6 Mb region and in a few recombinants with either the N2 or distant haplotypes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). The JU1580 and N2 haplotypes show fewer fixed differences in RAD polymorphic sites between them (24 SNPs) than with the divergent haplotype group (63 and 57 SNPs, respectively). In addition, from our whole-genome JU1580 sequencing data, N2 and JU1580 display a very low level of molecular diversity in the central region of chromosome IV (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). Moreover, we observe a strong decrease in molecular diversity between IV:4529464 to IV:6662701 in isolates carrying the <i>niDf250</i> allele (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>, lines), but not in those carrying the <i>drh-1</i> (N2) allele. Thus, the divergence between the N2 and JU1580 haplotypes in this region, including the <i>niDf250</i> deletion, appears recent relative to much of the species\u2019 genetic diversity. Furthermore, the <i>niDf250</i> allele is in high or even full linkage disequilibrium with a large region of chromosome IV (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>, dots). This lack of diversity and the high linkage disequilibrium around <i>niDf250</i> suggest a partial sweep of the haplotype linked to <i>niDf250</i>. They also imply that the sensitive <i>drh-1</i> allele may have spread by hitch-hiking with a favorable allele."

We previously showed that disruption of small RNA pathway genes such as <i>rde-1</i>, which encodes an Argonaute protein essential for RNAi in response to exogenous dsRNA (RDE-1), renders N2 animals as sensitive to the Orsay virus as JU1580 (<a href=\"#bib16\">F\u00e9lix et al., 2011</a>). DRH-1 interacts with the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) binding protein RDE-4 and the dsRNA-specific endonuclease Dicer (DCR-1), both of which act upstream of RDE-1 in exogenous RNAi (<a href=\"#bib51\">Tabara et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Parrish and Fire, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Barber et al., 2010</a>) However, DRH-1 is dispensable for exogenous RNAi (<a href=\"#bib23\">Gu et al., 2009</a>). We therefore wondered if DRH-1 could act specifically to promote DCR-1 processing of long dsRNA that is produced during viral RNA replication. Indeed, we find that DCR-1 is required for viral resistance in the N2 strain (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). We therefore postulated that the antiviral response involves siRNAs processed by DCR-1, which may initiate a cascade of events analogous to canonical <i>C. elegans</i> RNAi."

                                "text": "In <i>C. elegans</i>, the RNAi pathway is divided into primary and secondary steps. Long dsRNA is processed by DCR-1 to generate a primary siRNA duplex \u223c23 nucleotides (nt) in length with 5\u2032 monophosphates and 2 nt 3\u2032 overhangs. By examining libraries derived solely from small RNAs with 5\u2032 monophosphates (5\u2032 dependent libraries), we could interrogate the primary siRNA response specifically. In wild-type N2 animals, infection with virus leads to generation of predominantly 23 nt small RNAs with no first nucleotide bias, mapping both sense and antisense to the viral genome in equal proportions (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). These small RNAs are likely primary DCR-1 products generated from the double-stranded intermediate of viral replication, consistent with the small RNA response against single-strand RNA viruses in insects (<a href=\"#bib19\">Flynt et al., 2009</a>). Furthermore, overlapping RNAs mapping to complementary strands of the viral genome showed the 2 nt 3\u2032 overhang characteristic of Dicer products (p&lt;10<sup>\u22129</sup>, \u03c7<sup>2</sup> test against a uniform distribution of overhang length) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). The same viRNA pattern was observed in <i>rde-1</i> mutants lacking the primary siRNA Argonaute protein RDE-1 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). Thus <i>rde-1</i> mutants are proficient in primary viRNA formation despite being sensitive to viral infection (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) (<a href=\"#bib16\">F\u00e9lix et al., 2011</a>). In contrast, JU1580 animals showed a markedly different pattern (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). First, a much higher proportion of small RNAs derived from the sense strand than the antisense strand (88% vs 49% in N2). Second, the size distribution of viRNAs was flattened, with a greatly reduced proportion of 23 nt RNAs and an increased proportion of 15\u201320 nt RNAs. These shorter viRNAs were not present in libraries prepared from uninfected JU1580 or N2 controls (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>) and appeared to be derived from regions of strong secondary structure within the virus (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). The <i>drh-1</i> mutant (in an N2 strain background) displayed an identical viRNA pattern to JU1580 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>). Thus JU1580 and <i>drh-1</i> mutant strains are deficient in primary siRNA generation against the virus."

Secondary siRNAs are synthesized by RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRPs), and bind to a number of secondary siRNA-specific Argonaute proteins to bring about target silencing (<a href=\"#bib57\">Yigit et al., 2006</a>). Secondary siRNAs have a modal length of 22 nt, are 5\u2032 triphosphorylated, have a strong preference for a 5\u2032 guanine (G), and are referred to as 22G siRNAs (22Gs). Small RNAs can be enzymatically treated prior to adaptor ligation to allow sequencing (5\u2032 independent) of both primary and secondary siRNAs (<a href=\"#bib38\">Pak and Fire, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Sijen et al., 2007</a>). N2 animals infected with Orsay virus showed a robust secondary 22G siRNA response, primarily antisense to the viral genome (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In contrast, <i>rde-1</i> mutants lacked 22G siRNAs, consistent with a role for RDE-1 in initiating the secondary siRNA response (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In addition, mutants lacking DRH-3 or the RdRP RRF-1 and a strain deficient in 12 worm Argonaute proteins (WAGO-1 through 12) that bind secondary siRNAs (MAGO<i>-</i>12) (<a href=\"#bib57\">Yigit et al., 2006</a>) lacked 22G viRNAs, but still produced primary siRNAs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F,L,M</a>). The above have previously been implicated in secondary siRNA generation in other contexts (<a href=\"#bib57\">Yigit et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Pak and Fire, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Sijen et al., 2007</a>) and <i>drh-3, rrf-1</i> and MAGO<i>-</i>12 mutant strains are also sensitive to viral infection similar to <i>rde-1</i> (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

This suggests that the few DCR-1 products with the correct length in <i>drh-1</i> mutants can still be used to generate secondary siRNAs as in N2, implying that <i>drh-1</i> is not essential for the secondary siRNA pathway.

We suggest that the physical interaction between DRH-1 and DCR-1, and the potential for DRH-1 to recognize the viral genome as foreign, possibly through its well-conserved RIG-I domain, may enable DRH-1 to recruit DCR-1 to the double-stranded replicating viral genome and instigate a hierarchical antiviral siRNA response (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). Our data also show that the role of DRH-1 in viral recognition is distinct from that of its paralogs. Given the sequence and domain similarities between DRH-1, DRH-2 and DRH-3, it will be of interest to determine the mode of RNA recognition by DRH-2 and DRH-3 in the future."

DCR-1 cleaves the viral genome into 23 nt viRNA duplexes with a 2 nt 3\u2032 overhang. Duplex viRNAs are incorporated into the Argonaute protein RDE-1 and one strand is lost to give rise to primary viral siRNAs (primary viRNAs). Primary viRNAs and RDE-1 recruit an RdRP complex to the viral genome to synthesize secondary viral siRNAs, which act to silence viral transcripts or inhibit virus replication. The antiviral RNAi pathway is dependent on the SAGO-2 secondary Argonaute protein (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). The antiviral RNAi pathway has parallels to the exogenous RNAi pathway and the endogenous RNAi pathway thought to recognize aberrant endogenous transcripts (<a href=\"#bib23\">Gu et al., 2009</a>).

However, there must be some mechanism to distinguish between the viral genome and cellular RNAs. <i>Drosophila</i> and plants have a dedicated Dicer enzyme responsible for viral dsRNA recognition. We suggest that in <i>C. elegans</i> DRH-1 may perform this function. The absence of a role for <i>drh-1</i> in the endogenous small RNA pathway (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Gu et al., 2009</a>) supports the idea that it encodes a viral-specific recognition factor. In mammals, the C-terminal domain of the DRH-1 ortholog RIG-I is able to recognize the 5\u2032 triphosphate on viral genomes in the context of the double-stranded replication intermediate (<a href=\"#bib24\">Hornung et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Pichlmair et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Rehwinkel et al., 2010</a>). The C-terminal domain is conserved in DRH-1, thus suggesting that DRH-1 might use a recognition mechanism analogous to RIG-I to recruit DCR-1 to the Orsay virus RNA. In support of this, 5\u2032 RACE experiments from total RNA from infected animals using Orsay virus specific primers fail to detect product unless the 5\u2032 triphosphate is removed prior to adaptor ligation (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), suggesting that the majority of Orsay genomic RNA molecules are indeed phosphorylated at the 5\u2032 end."

Examining whether cells deficient in RIG-I show alterations in small RNA pathways upon viral infection may help to address this question. Equally, it will be interesting to identify whether DRH-1 has a signaling role in <i>C. elegans</i> upon viral infection. Such studies might indicate whether the gene expression or the RNAi function is the ancestral role of RIG-I-like genes."

Yet it is puzzling that a derived allele with deleterious consequences in the presence of viral infection is found at intermediate frequency. One possible explanation might be the low natural occurrence of infecting viruses, meaning that the <i>drh-1</i> deletion is effectively neutral. In support of this argument we have not been able to detect similar intestinal symptoms of viral infection in our extensive <i>C. elegans</i> sampling (<a href=\"#bib16a\">F\u00e9lix and Duveau, 2012</a>), including in other years of sampling in the Orsay orchard. Alternatively the <i>drh-1</i> deletion may have hitch-hiked to fixation with a closely linked beneficial mutation. Such a phenomenon is likely to be common in <i>C. elegans</i> natural populations due to the low effective outcrossing rate, which results in high linkage disequilibrium, especially when associated with a positive selective sweep (<a href=\"#bib8\">Cutter et al., 2009</a>). Indeed we find that the natural <i>drh-1</i> deletion allele is in high linkage disequilibrium with the surrounding region of chromosome IV (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). A related possibility is that the <i>drh-1</i> deletion itself might have a positive fitness effect in some natural conditions. Although we did not detect a fitness advantage for the region surrounding the <i>drh-1</i> deletion under laboratory conditions, we cannot test all possible natural conditions, thus a beneficial effect for the <i>drh-1</i> deletion or its surrounding region remains a possibility. Interestingly, RIG-I appears to have been lost in several clades, including chickens (<a href=\"#bib60\">Zou et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Barber et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>), which might explain the increased sensitivity of chickens to avian influenza virus when compared to ducks (<a href=\"#bib4\">Barber et al., 2010</a>)."

As <i>niDf250</i> had already been identified in the genome sequence analysis, F2 animals were genotyped by PCR for the presence of its JU1580 allele in the 6 Mb central region of chromosome IV with primers oTB40 and oTB43 (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1B</a>). From one heterozygous animal, 20 homozygous <i>niDf250</i> F3 animals were selected and crossed to N2 males to start another cycle of introgression. We repeated this cycle twice and in the final cycle 20 homozygous <i>niDf250</i> F3 animals were isolated. We used a pyrosequencing genotyping method (PyroMark Q96 ID instrument; Biotage) to select among these 20 animals those with the full 6 Mb central region of chromosome IV from JU1580 into the N2 genetic background, and only this region. We genotyped six SNPs on chromosome IV (one at either end of the chromosome, one at either end of the 6 Mb region and two within this region), three SNPs on chromosomes I, III, V, X and two on II. We thus obtained an introgressed line, called JU2170. To obtain recombinants within the 6 Mb central region of chromosome IV for fine mapping, JU2170 hermaphrodites were crossed to N2 males. From 20 F1 heterozygous hermaphrodites, we isolated 300 F2 individuals and selected for recombinants between the two SNPs at either end of the region (IV: 3,877,431 and IV: 11,083,410). We thus obtained five recombinants. We further narrowed down the recombination break point by genotyping inside the candidate region (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

Fastq files generated by the machine had adaptors removed using the program Cutadapt v1, and were converted into Fasta files using a custom Perl script. For alignment to the viral genome, Fasta files were trimmed to leave only reads of between 15 and 30 nucleotides using a custom Perl script and were aligned using Bowtie (version 0.12.7) to RNA1 and RNA2 of the Orsay virus genome (<a href=\"#bib16\">F\u00e9lix et al., 2011</a>), reporting only the best single alignment with up to one mismatch allowed. Sam files from Bowtie were converted into bam files using the SAMtools utility (<a href=\"#bib30\">Li and Durbin, 2009</a>) and bam files were converted into bed files using the BedTools utility (<a href=\"#bib42\">Quinlan and Hall, 2010</a>). Bed files were read into the R environment and plots of the length and first nucleotide as well as read distribution along RNA2 were generated using custom scripts written in R. The level of virus as measured by qRT-PCR was observed to correlate non-linearly with the total level of sense small RNAs in different N2 wild-type samples, thus data were normalized to all viral siRNAs or all sense viRNAs to illustrate differences in read distribution between different samples. Analysis of the overlap to identify potential DCR-1 signatures was carried out by selecting reads of the same length coming from opposite strands on the viral genome, which overlapped by at least one nucleotide. The number of reads overlapping by every possible length either 3\u2032 or 5\u2032 was compared to that expected were the entire distribution uniform using a \u03c7<sup>2</sup> test. Only one overlap was statistically significantly enriched with a cut-off of p&lt;0.05 as indicated in the text. For alignment to the <i>C. elegans</i> genome to analyze any potential changes in 22G levels, fasta files were trimmed to leave only reads of between 18 and 30 nucleotides, and the fasta files were collapsed using the FastX Toolkit. Reads matching to microRNA precursors downloaded from miRbase (<a href=\"#bib29\">Kozomara and Griffiths-Jones, 2011</a>) were removed using a custom Perl script, and the remaining reads were aligned to the Ce6 genome (WS190) using Bowtie, reporting the best match with no mismatches (parameters\u2014best\u2013k 1\u2013v 0). After converting bam files to bed files as above, 22Gs mapping antisense to the Ce6/WS190 UCSC annotations of genes (sangerGene.txt) downloaded from the UCSC genome browser website, were then selected from the alignments using a custom Perl script. Genes with abundant 22G reads in N2 wild-type worms were further selected by setting a cut-off of at least five reads in at least one of the N2 wild-type samples and duplicate or overlapping annotations were removed. Comparison of mutants to N2 wild-type was carried out after normalizing to the total number of aligned reads in each library. Secondary structure analysis of the viral genome was performed using RNA-fold (<a href=\"#bib34\">McCaskill, 1990</a>) on a 50 bp window sliding by increments of 20 bp. A Z-score for the secondary structure strength of each window was calculated by comparing the ensemble free energy mean ensemble free energy for 100 random shuffles of the 50 bp window."

Once the bleached embryos had developed to adulthood, we let them lay embryos for 1 hr and half to further synchronize the populations. After letting the embryos hatch overnight, we started the competition experiment with L2 hermaphrodite larvae in a 1:1 ratio (20 plates with 10 N2 and 10 JU2196 animals on each), adding 50 \u03bcl of Orsay virus preparation on half of these plates and 50 \u03bcl of M9 solution in the other.

After 2 min of centrifugation at 3000 rpm, the supernatant was removed and a fraction of the pellet containing 100\u2013400 animals (generally 2 \u03bcl) was transferred to a new NGM plate.

The gene emerged from an analysis of natural variation in sensitivity to the Orsay virus, and by a combination of GWAS, introgression mapping, and whole-genome sequencing, the authors managed to pin down a small deletion as a major-effect locus. Using mostly if not exclusively genetics, the authors provide evidence that DRH-1 is likely to specifically recruit the Dicer protein DCR-1 to viral dsRNA substrates. This clearly is a new finding, especially in an organism with a single Dicer. While we find the work very interesting, a minimal set of additional experiments would help support the inferences of the genetic analyses by answering the following questions: 1) Does viral infection affect the expression and subcellular location of DRH-1 protein, as assayed with a GFP fusion?"

If the answer to the initial question is yes, this could support the scenario for the possible benefit of the <i>drh-1</i> deletion in a significant fraction of the wild accessions because of enhanced environmental RNAi (which may confer unknown fitness advantages)."

However, we do not agree that this analysis relates directly to the manuscript that we have submitted: any change or lack of change in subcellular localization would neither strengthen nor contradict our model. Furthermore, we believe that a thorough analysis of DRH-1 behaviour upon infection would have to include analysis of the subcellular dynamics of the Orsay virus in order to be meaningful. Since we do not fully understand this yet, a combined analysis should be the focus of an independent future study. Nevertheless, we have generated a transgenic line expressing a DRH-1-GFP fusion protein. We found that these transgenic animals localize GFP diffusely in the cytoplasm of intestinal and other cells (Author response image 1 below, transgene driven by a \u201cubiquitous\u201d promoter, <i>sur-5</i>). We observed that the cytoplasmic localization of GFP does not change in response to infection with the Orsay virus. However, in the absence of a suitable antibody that works in immunofluorescence, we are unable to assess the localization of the endogenous protein, thus we cannot rule out that changes in DRH-1 subcellular localization occur upon infection. We should therefore be cautious about the interpretation of such a negative result and we would prefer not to include these data in the manuscript. We have therefore added a paragraph to the Discussion referencing the gene expression paper, and we have referred to the results of the DRH-1GFP fusion protein analysis as data not shown."
