Among them are the Hox genes, which define different identities along the anterior\u2013posterior axis. Hox proteins exert their function by interaction with TALE transcription factors. Hox and TALE members are also present in some but not all non-bilaterian phyla, raising the question of how Hox\u2013TALE interactions evolved to provide positional information. By using proteins from unicellular and multicellular lineages, we showed that these networks emerged from an ancestral generic motif present in Hox and other related protein families. Interestingly, Hox-TALE networks experienced additional and extensive molecular innovations that were likely crucial for differentiating Hox functions along body plans. Together our results highlight how homeobox gene families evolved during eukaryote evolution to eventually constitute a major patterning system in Eumetazoans."

Among them are the Hox genes, which define different identities along the anterior\u2013posterior axis. Hox proteins exert their function by interaction with TALE transcription factors. Hox and TALE members are also present in some but not all non-bilaterian phyla, raising the question of how Hox\u2013TALE interactions evolved to provide positional information. By using proteins from unicellular and multicellular lineages, we showed that these networks emerged from an ancestral generic motif present in Hox and other related protein families. Interestingly, Hox-TALE networks experienced additional and extensive molecular innovations that were likely crucial for differentiating Hox functions along body plans. Together our results highlight how homeobox gene families evolved during eukaryote evolution to eventually constitute a major patterning system in Eumetazoans."

Given their important patterning roles, Hox genes are thought to have strongly contributed to morphological diversification of bilaterian organisms during evolution. Accordingly, numerous examples have shown that modifications in Hox genes number, expression, and/or activity could correlate to morphological variations across bilaterian lineages (<a href=\"#bib26\">Heffer and Pick, 2013</a>)."

A role of Hox genes in axis patterning was proposed in the hydrozoan <i>Eleutheria dichotoma</i> (<a href=\"#bib32\">Jakob and Schierwater, 2007</a>), but these results are limited by the fact that functional analyses were performed in medusa, a particular developmental stage that is not shared by all cnidarian species.

In Bilateria, Hox patterning functions rely on the presence of the PBC and Meis proteins, which are also present in non-bilaterian phyla (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). We thus assessed whether a Hox/PBC/Meis network could exist outside Bilateria, and if so whether or not it would rely on identical molecular rules as observed in Bilateria."

The Hox/PBC/Meis network relies on interactions between PBC and Meis proteins on one side, and on interactions between Hox and PBC proteins on the other side (<a href=\"#bib41\">Mann et al., 2009</a>). Some posterior vertebrate Hox members do form dimeric complexes with Meis (<a href=\"#bib60\">Shen et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Williams et al., 2005</a>), but these interactions constitute a vertebrate innovation rather than a general rule in Bilateria. Interactions between PBC and Meis occur through conserved regions localized upstream of the HD of both proteins (called PBC-A and MEIS-A domains) and which are thought to derive from a common ancestor domain (<a href=\"#bib6\">Burglin, 1998</a>). These interactions allow the nuclear translocation and stability of PBC (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abu-Shaar et al., 1999</a>). Interactions between Hox and PBC involve a short conserved motif in Hox proteins, called the hexapeptide (HX), which folds within the hydrophobic pocket formed in part by the extra-three residues of the HD of PBC (<a href=\"#bib47\">Merabet et al., 2009</a>). This motif contains a conserved core sequence of four residues in all but AbdB-group Hox proteins, which retain a single tryptophan residue. Additional specific signatures can also be found in the HX of some paralog groups (<a href=\"#bib47\">Merabet et al., 2009</a>). Recent data showed that Hox proteins could also interact with PBC partners through other more specific motifs.

We observed that the nuclear accumulation of mCherry-<i>Nv</i>Pbx fusion protein is contingent upon co-injection with <i>Nv</i>Meis (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Thus, <i>Nv</i>Meis is able to stabilize <i>Nv</i>Pbx, eventually triggering its nuclear accumulation. This observation is reminiscent of Pbx/Meis relationships in bilaterians (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abu-Shaar et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Saleh et al., 2000</a>). We further confirmed this result by visualizing <i>Nv</i>Pbx/<i>Nv</i>Meis complexes directly in live <i>Nematostella</i> embryos through BiFC (Bimolecular Complementation Fluorescence). BiFC relies on the property of fluorescent proteins to be reconstituted when their two non-fluorescent sub-fragments are close enough in space. This method has been developed in several animal model systems to validate interactions between two candidate partners in vivo (<a href=\"#bib37\">Kodama and Hu, 2012</a>). In this study, we co-expressed <i>Nv</i>Pbx and <i>Nv</i>Meis fused respectively to the N-terminal (VN) or C-terminal (VC) fragment of Venus. This resulted in fluorescent signals in the cytoplasm (where interaction occurs first) and nuclei of embryonic cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). No BiFC was obtained between a fusion construct and the complementary isolated VC or VN fragment, highlighting that the interaction between <i>Nv</i>Pbx and <i>Nv</i>Meis fusion proteins was not artificially induced by the inherent affinity of the VN and VC fragments (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>)."

To know whether such sites could be used in the context of <i>Nematostella</i> development, we searched for their presence in the <i>Nematostella</i> genome. We predicted that these DNA-binding sites should be found in the promoter region of genes expressed in the endoderm, where Hox and TALE products are present together. By comparison, the promoter region of genes expressed in the ectoderm should not be enriched in Pbx/Meis-binding sites since the TALE partners are absent in this tissue. Therefore, we performed an in silico analysis based on 76 genes displaying a characterized developmental expression pattern during <i>Nematostella</i> embryogenesis. The choice of working with a limited number of genes was motivated by the fact that we did not find any significant enrichment of Hox/PBC/Meis binding sites in a genome-wide search, neither in <i>Nematostella</i> nor in other metazoan species (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

The density was calculated on all non-coding regions of the genomes (blue-filled bars), repeat-masked except for <i>Amphimedon</i> where the repeat-masked genome was the same as the non-repeat-masked one. Two other conditions (white bars) represent a subset of the genome. The non-coding regions (CNE) conserved in 12 Drosophila genomes show a higher density than genome-wide approaches. These results suggest that the search space needs to be reduced to obtain a good signal/noise ratio. One idea would be to search for conserved regions within cnidarians, taking Nematostella as reference, but such an analysis was beyond the scope of this project, and the divergence time of available cnidarian genomes might not be adapted to this analysis. We attempted a related analysis by taking microsyntenic regions as described in <a href=\"#bib31\">Irimia et al. (2012)</a>. The results do not show a high density comparable to the Drosophila CNEs. We hypothesize that these microsyntenic regions still have a low signal to noise ratio for these motif clusters, or that biologically, the Hox/Pbx + Meis cluster is not majorly involved in the regulation taking place at these regions conserved throughout metazoans. (<b>B</b>) Validation of cluster enrichment. For each organism, we calculated the enrichment of Hox/PBC/Meis clusters, compared to a random control. At first, we conducted this analysis on random sequences, artificially generated from Markov models trained on the genomes of interest, and taking into account the number and positions of the repeats. The results, however, were highly dependent on the order of the Markov model. To circumvent this, we used randomized motifs as a control, allowing us to keep working on the real genomic sequences. We permuted the motif positions 100 times, allowing, removing the biological signal, while retaining the statistical properties of the PSSMs describing the motifs. We observed a clear enrichment of the clusters in Drosophila CNEs. In contrast, most of the genome-wide analyses did not reveal any enrichment, except in Drosophila, which showed a slight enrichment similar to <i>Trichoplax</i>. As Trichoplax has no HX-containing ANTP proteins (therefore no Hox/PBC/Meis network), with signal to noise ratio still quite low, we did not consider this slight enrichment."

In this model, Meis is able to promote HX-dependent interactions between <i>Nv</i>Msx and <i>Nv</i>Pbx by masking inhibitory interaction domains in <i>Nv</i>Msx. Whether a similar role could exist in Bilateria remains to be determined. We noticed that the Drosophila Msx protein contains an HX and forms trimeric but not dimeric complexes with the Drosophila TALE partners (not shown). HX-dependency in those interactions remains to be determined (question marks). Interaction between <i>Dm</i>En and PBC is also HX-dependent but does not require the presence of Meis to occur. In contrast to the NK or extended-Hox families, most members of the Hox family have retained a HX motif. This motif is required for generic Hox/Pbx functions. The additional presence of Meis allows revealing specific Pbx interaction motifs (SPIMs), which could be important for distinguishing and/or diversifying the embryonic activities of each Hox paralog group member.

Interestingly, <i>Ac</i>Meis possesses a MEIS-A domain and displays a high level of sequence similarity with mouse or fly Meis proteins in the HD (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). In contrast, <i>Ac</i>Pbx lacks any PBC-A domain and has a strongly divergent HD when compared to other Pbx proteins (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). As expected, we observed that <i>Ac</i>Pbx could neither bind on a consensus PBC-binding site, nor stimulates the binding of <i>Ac</i>Meis on the same probe, suggesting that both proteins could not interact in vitro (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>). This result was confirmed by using central or posterior Hox/PBC/Meis binding sites, on which no dimeric or trimeric complex with Hox proteins could be formed (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C,D</a>). To assess whether absence of protein complexes could be explained by the strong sequence divergence of <i>Ac</i>Pbx, we repeated experiments with the mouse Pbx1 protein. Under these heterologous partnership conditions, we observed that the binding of <i>Ac</i>Meis could be strongly enhanced in the presence of the Pbx partner, suggesting that the two proteins could make interactions (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>). However, neither dimeric nor trimeric complexes could be formed on central and posterior Hox/PBC/Meis nucleotide probes, demonstrating that <i>Ac</i>Meis lacks protein feature(s) for making cooperative DNA-binding complexes with Hox and PBC proteins (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C\u2032\u2013D\u2032\u2019</a>).

In this context, our work with TALE proteins of <i>Acanthamoeba</i> underlines that the evolution of the TALE partners enabled the interaction network with Hox proteins and hence new functions to emerge during eukaryote evolution."

This motif is present in different ANTP subclasses, including NK, Hox/ParaHox and extended-Hox, specifically in Bilateria and Cnidaria. Different scenarios can be proposed for explaining the evolutionary history of the HX among different ANTP members. These scenarios are hypothetical and diverge according to the putative evolutionary history of the ANTP class homeobox genes. In one scenario, HX-containing NK, Hox and extended-Hox members could have emerged from a common HX-containing NK protein, which itself appeared from duplications of an ancestral HX-deficient NK cluster, at the basis of Eumetazoa (Bilateria+Cnidaria, <a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11A</a>). Alternatively, it was recently proposed that Hox/ParaHox, NK and extended-Hox evolved before the origin of poriferans (<a href=\"#bib45\">Mendivil Ramos et al., 2012</a>), being already present in the last common ancestor of animals (Urmetazoa). In this scenario, we do not favour the hypothesis of independent acquisitions of the HX in the three homeobox gene families. Indeed, although the HX is a short motif, it is always located upstream and at a reasonable distance of the HD. This invariant position is probably critical to ensure interactions with PBC proteins. Moreover, the distance between the HX and the HD could have played important roles for the acquisition of new functions, as noticed in certain bilaterian Hox proteins (<a href=\"#bib48\">Prince et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Saadaoui et al., 2011</a>). Thus, the HX could already have been present in the ProtoANTP protein of the Urmetazoa ancestor, being secondarily lost in Porifera, Ctenophora and Placozoa during evolution (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11B</a>)."

Homology between cnidarian and bilaterian axes is a long-standing and still controversial question. It was first proposed that the oral\u2013aboral axis of <i>Nematostella</i> could be orthologous to the bilaterian AP axis, with an anterior-like (<i>NvHoxA</i>/<i>anthox6</i>) and central/posterior (<i>NvHoxF</i>/<i>Anthox1</i>) Hox gene being expressed at the oral or aboral tip respectively (<a href=\"#bib18\">Finnerty et al., 2004</a>). This expression profile is however not conserved in other cnidarian species (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kamm et al., 2006</a>) and there is compelling evidence that the aboral pole could rather correspond to the anterior end of bilaterians (<a href=\"#bib61\">Sinigaglia et al., 2013</a>). Therefore, expression of <i>Nv</i>Hox genes along the primary body axis could correspond to individual morphogenetic and not positional patterning functions, as recently shown for <i>NvHoxF</i> (<a href=\"#bib61\">Sinigaglia et al., 2013</a>).

We showed that more ancient TALE proteins, like those from the unicellular <i>Acanthamoeba</i> organism could neither interact between each other nor form complexes with Hox proteins. Heterologous interaction assays between <i>Ac</i>Meis and mouse Hox and PBC proteins further exemplified that the PBC/Meis partnership is critical for the formation of Hox\u2013TALE networks. This partnership probably appeared with the PBC-A domain in PBC, and concomitantly with the HX motif during eukaryote evolution. Although the MEIS-A domain was more ancient, the Meis partner also clearly acquired additional protein features, allowing the formation and therefore diversifying the activity of Hox/PBC/Meis networks in Metazoa."

Still, the role and the importance of TALE partners in these additional networks might not be equivalent. We propose that apparition of Hox, NK and extended-Hox members was accompanied by functional sub-specialisations that could in part result from divergent molecular interaction properties with TALE cofactors. For example, only two NK sub-family members (Msx and Tlx) have retained a HX motif, suggesting that interaction between NK and TALE proteins is not a general rule. The same rationale applies to extended-Hox members. On the contrary, the HX is present in almost all Hox paralog groups, which coincides with a general requirement of TALE cofactors in Hox functions. In this context, the role of Meis for revealing additional and more specific Pbx interaction motifs (SPIMs) in Hox proteins (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hudry et al., 2012</a>) was also likely an ancestral feature of the Hox/TALE system for distinguishing functions between different Hox paralog members."

This network was effective as soon as different interaction modes could exist with duplicated Hox family members, allowing diversifying patterning functions along the body axis. This original molecular system was subsequently co-opted by the various contexts of embryogenesis in different eumetazoan phyla, for axis or tissue (see e.g., <a href=\"#bib14\">Di-Poi et al., 2007</a>) patterning, illustrating its remarkable adaptability throughout animal evolution."

The function of the Hox genes in cnidarians is a particularly contentious issue within the field and this manuscript represents an important new perspective on this debate, now supported with abundant new functional data. The detailed functional experiments performed here, involving two different <i>Nematostella</i> Hox genes clearly illustrate that this cnidarian has Hox (and Pbx and Meis) genes that function like the Hox genes of bilaterians, regardless of the difficulties of comparing the embryology and axial development of cnidarians relative to bilaterians. The variety in the modes of interaction between the Meis, Pbx and Hox proteins when the presence of a hexapeptide is varied is also of widespread interest, not just for the evolutionary implications highlighted in this manuscript, but also for the basic mechanistic implications for these transcription factors.\u00a0"

We already described all suitable negative controls in <i>Drosophila</i>, mammalian cells and chick embryos (Hudry et al., BMC Biology 2011; Hudry et al., PLOS Biology 2012).

This is now more clearly stated in the Result section: \u201cNo BiFC was obtained between a fusion construct and the complementary isolated VC or VN fragment, highlighting that the interaction between <i>Nv</i>Pbx and <i>Nv</i>Meis fusion proteins was not artificially induced by the inherent affinity of the VN and VC fragments (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>)\u201d.

It is, after all, a short sequence in which a high degree of variability can be seen amongst gene families and between taxa. In some instances it seems to effectively be just a single Tryptophan (W) residue. One scenario might be that once a hexapeptide\u2013TALE interaction is established in one family then the hexapeptide-interacting aspect of the TALE protein is established and is retained whilst the hexapeptide evolves in other ANTP subclasses? This scenario is the compliment of the differential loss scenario described by the authors, in terms of explaining the patchy distribution of hexapeptide domains across the ANTP class.\u201d"

We agree with Reviewer 2 that given the short size of the HX, this motif could have appeared independently in multiple times during evolution. However, we have to consider that this motif is always located at a precise position in all ANTP subclass members (upstream of the HD), which is probably important to ensure interactions with PBC members. Along the same line, the distance between the HX and the HD may also have played important roles in the acquisition of new functions, as noticed in certain bilaterian Hox proteins. For all these reasons, it is difficult to imagine that the invariant position of the HX could result from independent acquisitions during metazoan evolution. We tried to better emphasize this point in the corresponding discussion part."

What is important is the existence of a patterning system that could be co-opted during evolution: \u201cTogether these observations highlight that patterning molecules can be used along different longitudinal axes during animal evolution, which renders difficult the comparison between Bilateria and Cnidaria. Here we propose that the ancestral molecular cues underlying the Hox patterning system along the cnidarian directive axis could have been recruited for AP patterning in Bilateria.\u201d"
