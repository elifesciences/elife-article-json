How these diverse processes are coordinated remains unclear. We show that in mammalian oocytes Shugoshin-like protein 2 (Sgol2) in addition to protecting cohesin, plays an important role in turning off the SAC, in promoting the congression and bi-orientation of bivalents on meiosis I spindles, in facilitating formation of K-fibers and in limiting bivalent stretching. Sgol2\u2019s ability to protect cohesin depends on its interaction with PP2A, as is its ability to silence the SAC, with the latter being mediated by direct binding to Mad2. In contrast, its effect on bivalent stretching and K-fiber formation is independent of PP2A and mediated by recruitment of MCAK and inhibition of Aurora C kinase activity respectively. By virtue of its multiple interactions, Sgol2 links many of the processes essential for faithful chromosome segregation."

How these diverse processes are coordinated remains unclear. We show that in mammalian oocytes Shugoshin-like protein 2 (Sgol2) in addition to protecting cohesin, plays an important role in turning off the SAC, in promoting the congression and bi-orientation of bivalents on meiosis I spindles, in facilitating formation of K-fibers and in limiting bivalent stretching. Sgol2\u2019s ability to protect cohesin depends on its interaction with PP2A, as is its ability to silence the SAC, with the latter being mediated by direct binding to Mad2. In contrast, its effect on bivalent stretching and K-fiber formation is independent of PP2A and mediated by recruitment of MCAK and inhibition of Aurora C kinase activity respectively. By virtue of its multiple interactions, Sgol2 links many of the processes essential for faithful chromosome segregation."

Sgol2 performs three other functions: it helps to align the chromosomes prior to division by, it is thought, facilitating the formation of the K-fibers that attach the microtubules to the chromosomes; it turns off the checkpoint that monitors the alignment of the chromosomes and the attachment of the microtubules; and it regulates a number of the enzymes involved in the process. The specific interactions that allow Sgol2 to perform these diverse functions in meiosis were also identified. Thus, Rattani et al. show that in linking so many essential processes throughout meiosis, Sgol2 appears to have a key, if not unique, role in determining the fate of chromosomes as cells divide."

The pulling forces produced by kinetochore-microtubules attachments (K-fibers) and resisting forces generated by sister chromatid cohesion, which counteracts K-fiber forces if and when kinetochores attach to microtubules with different polarities. During meiosis I, cohesion along chromosome arms holds bivalent chromosomes together following the creation of chiasmata produced by reciprocal recombination between homologous non-sister chromatids. This cohesion must persist during the attachment of maternal and paternal kinetochores to microtubules from opposite poles (bi-orientation) and resist the resulting spindle forces. The degree of traction exerted by meiotic spindles must create sufficient tension to facilitate bi-orientation (<a href=\"#bib25\">Tachibana-Konwalski et al., 2010</a>). During the bi-orientation process, the initial attachment of kinetochores to the surface of the microtubule lattice (lateral attachment) is converted to attachments to their plus ends (end on attachment), creating K-fibers. Because this process is intrinsically error prone, inappropriate attachments, for example those that connect maternal and paternal kinetochores to the same pole, must be disrupted through phosphorylation of kinetochore proteins by Aurora B/C kinases (<a href=\"#bib10\">Kitajima et al., 2011</a>). However, because these kinases disrupt K-fibers, they must subsequently be down regulated once bivalents bi-orient correctly."

This process converts chromosomes from bivalents to dyads. It is delayed until all bivalents have bi-oriented by the production, at kinetochores that have not yet come under tension, of a potent inhibitor of the APC/C called the mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC) whose Mad2 subunit binds tightly to the APC/C\u2019s Cdc20 co-activator protein. This regulatory mechanism, called the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), must be turned off before APC/C<sup>Cdc20</sup> can direct destruction of securin and cyclin B and thereby activate separase. Another pre-condition for cleavage, at least in yeast, is phosphorylation of cohesin\u2019s kleisin subunit by a pair of protein kinases, namely CK1\u03b4/\u03b5 and DDK (<a href=\"#bib8\">Ishiguro et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Katis et al., 2010</a>). During the first meiotic division, cohesin is phosphorylated along chromosome arms but not at centromeres, which ensures that only cohesion along arms is destroyed by separase at the onset of anaphase I. The consequent persistence of cohesion at centromeres promotes bi-orientation of dyads during meiosis II."

Sgol2\u2019s coiled coil domain binds PP2A in vitro (<a href=\"#bib29\">Xu et al., 2009</a>) but whether this is vital for protecting centromeric cohesion is not known. Sgol2 also interacts with MCAK (<a href=\"#bib7\">Huang et al., 2007</a>), a microtubule depolymerizing kinesin, implicated in correcting inappropriate kinetochore-microtubule interactions (error correction), and with Mad2 an essential component of the MCC (<a href=\"#bib19\">Orth et al., 2011</a>). Shugoshins, though not explicitly Sgol2, have also been implicated in recruiting to kinetochores the Aurora B kinase, necessary both for the SAC and for error correction (<a href=\"#bib27\">Tsukahara et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Yamagishi et al., 2010</a>).

However, if this were the sole function of Sgol2, then chromosome behavior during meiosis I should be unaffected. To our surprise, we found that Sgol2 deficiency caused striking changes in chromosome and microtubule dynamics. It delayed bi-orientation of bivalents on meiosis I spindles, caused increased bivalent stretching, and greatly increased Aurora B/C kinase activity at kinetochores, which was accompanied by an increase in lateral and a decrease in end on kinetochore-microtubules attachments. Lastly, Sgol2 deficiency delayed considerably APC/C<sup>Cdc20</sup> activation, suggesting that it was required to shut off the SAC. Sgol2 helps to turn off the SAC by binding directly both PP2A and the MCC protein Mad2, it moderates chromosome stretching by recruiting to kinetochores the kinesin MCAK, and likely promotes formation of K-fibers by down-regulating the activity of Aurora B/C kinase specifically at kinetochores. Meiotic chromosome segregation is a highly complex process dependent on an array of different biochemical processes. Our findings imply that through its multi-domain structure, Sgol2 has an important if not unique role in coordinating many of the key processes within this array."

Unlike Sgol1, which only interacts stably with the PP2A holoenzyme (a complex of A, B\u2019 and C subunits), Sgol2 also associates with a core complex containing only A and C subunits (<a href=\"#bib29\">Xu et al., 2009</a>). To create versions of Sgol2 defective specifically in binding PP2A, conserved residues (namely L51, N54, R56, and E82) predicted to interact directly with PP2A were substituted by alanine or in the case of E82 also by lysine (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Likewise, the highly conserved asparagine (N55 on Sgol2), corresponding to N61 in Sgol1, which forms a hydrogen bond within the coiled coil enabling it to adopt a conformation compatible with PP2A binding, was substituted by isoleucine (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Importantly, binding between purified Flag- and His-tagged Sgol2 fragments spanning the coiled coil (cc) region (31\u2013117) was unaffected by any of these mutations, implying that all permit coiled coil formation. A triple mutation L51A/N54A/R56A (3A) reduced dimerization modestly (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>) but this effect was not seen when the two proteins were co-expressed in bacteria (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). To assess the effects on PP2A binding, GST-tagged PP2A A subunit was incubated with B\u2019 and C subunits in the presence of MBP-Sgol2cc-Flag. Pull down experiments revealed that N55I and the 3A triple mutation abolished co-purification of Sgol2 with the GST-tagged A subunit while N54A and R56A reduced it.

This motif is conserved in mouse Sgol2 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>) and far-western blots confirmed that interaction between mSgol2 and Mad2 is weakened by substituting the basic amino acid at its center with alanine (H150A) or glutamic acid (H150E) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>). Strikingly, H150E and H150A Sgol2 mRNAs were less effective than wild type in increasing the fraction of <i>sgol2</i><sup><i>\u0394/\u0394</i></sup> oocytes that activated APC/C<sup>Cdc20</sup> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). They also failed to advance the timing of activation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2B,C</a>). Importantly, neither mutation affected Sgol2\u2019s association with kinetochores, its ability to recruit PP2A (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>) or MCAK (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>) to this location, or protection of centromeric cohesion (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). Interestingly, N54A, which reduces PP2A binding, also abrogated Sgol2\u2019s ability to promote APC/C<sup>Cdc20</sup> activation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E,F</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2A,D</a>) without having any effect on MCAK recruitment (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>).

Because this effect was not accompanied by any reduction of cohesin along inter-chromatid axes (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>), it is unlikely to be caused by precocious Rec8 cleavage. Live cell imaging of oocytes microinjected at the GV stage with mRNAs encoding H2B-mCherry and GFP-MCAK showed that maternal and paternal kinetochores were pulled further apart in <i>sgol2</i><sup><i>\u0394/\u0394</i></sup> oocytes at metaphase I (<i>t</i> test, p&lt;0.0001).

Because a similar reduction in inter-kinetochore distances was observed with N54A or H150E mutations (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figures 5C and 6</a>; <a href=\"#media4\">Videos 4 and 5</a>, <i>t</i> test p&lt;0.0001), regulation of bivalent stretching by Sgol2 does not depend on its ability to bind PP2A or Mad2. Thus, the effect cannot be due to changes either in arm cohesion protection or duration of metaphase I."

During phase 1, multiple microtubule-organizing centers (MTOCs) form a ball of polymerizing microtubules on whose surface chromosomes are distributed individually. This is followed by a period (phase 2) in which chromosomes slide laterally over the ball shaped spindle apparatus, eventually congressing to form a \u2018prometaphase\u2019 belt around it. During phase 3, chromosomes invade the cluster of microtubules, which elongates along an axis perpendicular to the earlier chromosome belt, forming a barrel-shaped bipolar spindle. This highly dynamic phase culminates when chromosomes bi-orient on a metaphase plate within the bipolar spindle. During the fourth and final stage (phase 4), bi-oriented chromosomes oscillate around the metaphase plate with low amplitudes (Phase 4)."

This event is accompanied by an increase in Sgol2\u2019s abundance at kinetochores and by phosphorylation of T521 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A,B</a>). MCAK\u2019s abundance at kinetochores gradually increases during phase 3 as chromosomes invade the spindle apparatus and peaks as chromosomes bi-orient on the metaphase plate (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>, top panel; <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). This sequence of events is substantially altered in <i>sgol2</i><sup><i>\u0394/\u0394</i></sup> oocytes. Though GFP-MCAK co-localizes with MTOCs and microtubules, it never subsequently accumulates at kinetochores (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). Chromosomes associate with the surface of the ball, albeit more loosely than in wild type, and undergo visible stretching instead of forming a prometaphase belt (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figures 6 and 8A</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>; <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). This excessive stretching becomes even more pronounced upon formation of bipolar spindles. Thus, the clear demarcation of congression during phase 2 and bi-orientation during phase 3 was largely absent. Microinjection of Sgol2 mRNAs into <i>sgol2</i><sup><i>\u0394/\u0394</i></sup> oocytes greatly accelerated both invasion of the ball by chromosomes and their bi-orientation, with the latter occurring even earlier than in wild type oocytes and before metamorphosis of the ball into a bipolar spindle (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figures 6 and 8A</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>; <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>).

This revealed three differences between wild type and <i>sgol2</i><sup><i>\u0394/\u0394</i></sup> oocytes at 6 hr post-GVBD, when most kinetochores in wild type have relinquished lateral and formed end on attachments and chromosomes have bi-oriented. Kinetochore associated microtubules bundles (K-fibers) were thinner and more sparse, lateral attachments were greatly increased in frequency, and kinetochores (as detected by CREST antibodies) were frequently highly stretched in mutant oocytes (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>). Microinjection of Sgol2 mRNA had the opposite effect, eliminating lateral attachments and kinetochore stretching while greatly increasing the abundance of end-on microtubules associated with each kinetochore, an effect abrogated by T521A T600A (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>). This suggests that the accumulation at kinetochores of Sgol2 phosphorylated by Aurora B/C kinase stimulates the conversion of lateral to end on attachments and that this may be the mechanism by which Sgol2 accelerates chromosome bi-orientation. Because injection of CENPB-eGFP-MCAK mRNAs instead of Sgol2 largely failed to increase end-on attachments at the expense of lateral ones (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>), we suspect that Sgol2 phosphorylated by Aurora B/C has a function at kinetochores besides MCAK recruitment (see below)."

Remarkably, the ratio of p-Knl1 to CREST signals in <i>sgol2</i><sup><i>\u0394/\u0394</i></sup> oocytes at 6 hr post-GVBD was more than double that of wild type controls (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>). Microinjection of Sgol2 mRNA reduced this to below wild type, an effect unaltered by N54A but largely abolished by T521A T600A (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>). Similar results were obtained using a phospho-specific antibody against Ser100 on Dsn1 (data not shown) and one that detects activating auto-phosphorylation of Aurora A/B/C at Thr288, Thr232, or Thr198 (p-Aurora), respectively (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>). Interestingly, these effects were specific to kinetochores as auto-phosphorylation of Aurora B/C on chromosome arms was unaltered in the mutant oocytes (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>). Importantly, Sgol2 did not alter the overall amount of Aurora C at kinetochores (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>). These results imply that Sgol2 counters phosphorylation of KMN network proteins by a mechanism not involving its recruitment of PP2A. Strangely, this process seems to depend on Sgol2\u2019s prior phosphorylation by the very same kinases that it ultimately inhibits. In other words, Aurora B/C creates its own inhibitor at kinetochores, creating a negative feedback loop. Consistent with this notion, the gradual accumulation at kinetochores of Sgol2 phosphorylated at T521 following GVBD (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>) is accompanied by a corresponding reduction in Dsn1 Ser100 phosphorylation (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9D</a>). Critically, Sgol2\u2019s ability to inhibit Aurora B/C kinase activity at kinetochores does not depend on kinetochore-microtubule interactions, as Sgol2 reduced auto-phosphorylation of Aurora B/C even in the presence of microtubule destabilizing drug (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C</a>). To address whether hyper-activity of Aurora B/C at kinetochores could be responsible for the paucity of K-fibers in <i>sgol2</i><sup><i>\u0394/\u0394</i></sup> oocytes, we tested the effect of the Aurora kinase inhibitor AZD1152. This both increased the density of K-fibers and reduced kinetochore stretching but did not eliminate lateral attachments (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>), which may require direct involvement of MCAK. We suggest that Sgol2 promotes chromosome bi-orientation by inhibiting Aurora B/C kinase as well as by recruiting MCAK."

Our creation and analysis of mutations within Sgol2\u2019s highly conserved coiled coil reveals the likely mechanism, namely recruitment of PP2A to centromeres. PP2A might protect cohesin from separase either directly, by binding (<a href=\"#bib6\">Holland et al., 2007</a>) and inhibiting separase activity, or indirectly, by reversing phosphorylation of cohesin\u2019s Rec8 subunit (<a href=\"#bib9\">Katis et al., 2010</a>), a process known to be important for its cleavage in yeast. However, if cohesion protection were Sgol2\u2019s sole function, then its depletion should not compromise chromosome segregation during meiosis I. The precocious loss of cohesion should only affect the second meiotic division. On the contrary, depletion of Sgol2 specifically in oocytes has highly pleiotropic consequences already during meiosis I. These include inefficient SAC silencing, greatly increased bivalent stretching, and major alterations in the dynamics of kinetochore-microtubule attachments (K-fibers). We show that Sgol2 silences the SAC by binding to Mad2 using a similar MIM motif common to Mad2\u2019s other two partners Cdc20 and Mad1. This raises the possibility that Sgol2 silences the SAC by competing with Cdc20 for the binding of activated Mad2, thereby preventing formation of the MCC. However, this cannot be the full story as SAC silencing also depends on Sgol2\u2019s ability to bind PP2A. Because Sgol2\u2019s MIM motif is close to the coiled coil by which it binds PP2A, it is conceivable that PP2A directly (i.e., structurally) facilitates the formation or stability of \u2018closed\u2019 complexes between Sgol2 and Mad2. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that only dephosphorylated Mad2 interacts with Cdc20 and Sgol2, while a phosphomimetic mutant of Mad2 cannot associate with either of these proteins (personal communication Michael Orth). Thus, PP2A could selectively stabilize the Sgol2-Mad2 complex by keeping Mad2 in a de-phosphorylated state. Therefore, it is conceivable that if there were sufficient turnover of Mad2 bound to MCC, then PP2A could promote the Sgol2: Mad2 complex formation and thus alter the activity of the MCC responsible for inhibiting the APC/C."

This facilitates MCAK accumulation at kinetochores. Because artificial recruitment of MCAK to kinetochores by fusion to CENP-B substitutes for Sgol2 with regard to bivalent stretching, we suggest that it is the population of MCAK recruited to kinetochores by Sgol2 that moderates the pulling forces exerted on maternal and paternal kinetochores, possibly by reducing the incidence of lateral attachments."

Our observation that auto-phosphorylation of Aurora B/C kinases as well as phosphorylation of KMN proteins are elevated in Sgol2\u2019s absence but depressed upon microinjection of Sgol2 mRNA suggests that this other function of Sgol2 is to act as a kinetochore-specific inhibitor of Aurora B/C kinases. The notion that Sgol2 moderates Aurora B/C kinase activity at kinetochores was unexpected, as it has been reported that xSgo2, a newly discovered homolog of shugoshin in <i>Xenopus</i>, actually promotes Aurora Kinase activity, generating a favourable environment for microtubule polymerization (<a href=\"#bib23\">Rivera et al., 2012</a>). In this case, the effect may be systemic, that is throughout the cytoplasm, whereas <i>M.m</i> Sgol2 appears to act as an inhibitor only at kinetochores. A remarkable feature of this effect is that Sgol2\u2019s ability to inhibit Aurora B/C kinases at kinetochores depends on its prior phosphorylation at T521 and T600 by the very same Aurora kinases. In other words, Aurora B/C kinase creates its own inhibitor, generating a negative feedback loop. Whether the phosphorylation of Sgol2 necessary for it to act as an inhibitor of Aurora kinases at kinetochores is also generated at this location or along chromosome arms or elsewhere in the cell is currently unclear."

Aurora B/C protein kinases have a key role in destabilizing inappropriate kinetochore-microtubule attachments, namely those that do not generate tension (<a href=\"#bib12\">Lampson and Cheeseman, 2011</a>). They are therefore essential for the efficient bi-orientation of bivalent chromosomes. However, it is important that the de-stabilization process is eventually turned off so that correctly attached bivalents remain stably attached to microtubules. Hitherto, it has been assumed that the mechanism responsible for turning off these kinases merely involved physical forces that pull Aurora substrates away from the enzymes when maternal and paternal kinetochores are pulled in opposite directions (<a href=\"#bib14\">Liu et al., 2009</a>). Though our work does not preclude a role for traction in down regulating Aurora B/C\u2019s access to kinetochore-bound substrates, it raises the possibility that down regulation is also an intrinsic feature of a biochemical system in which Aurora B/C activates its own inhibitor. The regulatory network revealed by our work ensures that Aurora B/C kinases will be active early during the bi-orientation, when incorrect attachments may be more frequent, and less active later, when they have been largely eliminated. It is possible that during the period when Aurora B/C kinases are active, the selective stabilization of correct attachments is mediated by mechanical changes within kinetochores induced by tension, as recently observed in purified yeast kinetochores (<a href=\"#bib1\">Akiyoshi et al., 2010</a>), not as originally thought by tension dependent changes in Aurora kinase activity, for which there has never been much direct evidence. We suggest that an important feature of meiosis I in oocytes is an early phase of high Aurora B/C kinase activity at kinetochores followed by a later phase of lowered activity made possible by the Aurora B/C-Sgol2 negative feedback loop. The lowered activity of Aurora B/C might increase the MT-depolymerizing activity of MCAK at kinetochores (<a href=\"#bib2\">Andrews et al., 2004</a>). This is supported by the fact that the kinetochore pool of MCAK, recruited by Sgol2, is indeed not phosphorylated at serine 92 in mouse oocytes (data not shown). If correct, it will be important to understand the dynamic properties of the feedback loop that ensures that Aurora B/C kinases do not turn themselves off precociously. It is currently unclear whether the Aurora B/C-shugoshin feedback loop is a general feature of meiotic cells or whether it is also a feature of mitotic cells. How Sgol2 inhibits Aurora B/C kinase activity at kinetochores is also unclear, in particular whether Sgol2 does this alone or only in conjunction with the recruitment of MCAK."

Therefore in the revised version, we have removed the statement that stretching of the bivalents causes terminalisation of chiasmata from the Introduction and in the Results we have also modified the phrasing. We have described in the Results that though the bivalent in Sgol2 knockout oocytes appeared terminalised, they still retained cohesion between homologous chromosomes. Furthermore, we have added that this abnormal shape of bivalent chromosomes on chromosome spreads could possibly be explained by increased inter-kinetochore stretching on the proximal end of the chromosomes in Sgol2 knockout oocytes, but these bivalent chromosomes are still connected at distal ends by cohesin molecules."
