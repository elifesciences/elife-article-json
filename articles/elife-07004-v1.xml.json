We discover that <i>microRNA-203</i> is downregulated by <i>Hras<sup>G12V</sup></i>. Using a knockout mouse model, we demonstrate that loss of <i>microRNA-203</i> promotes selection and expansion of tumor-initiating cells.

We comprehensively identify <i>microRNA-203</i> targets required for <i>Hras</i>-initiated tumorigenesis.

This study establishes a role for the loss of <i>microRNA-203</i> in promoting selection and expansion of <i>Hras</i> mutated cells and identifies a mechanism through which <i>microRNA-203</i> antagonizes <i>Hras</i>-mediated tumorigenesis."
