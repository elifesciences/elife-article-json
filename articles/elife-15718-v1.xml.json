Enteric bacterial pathogens have developed strategies to sense bile as an environmental cue to regulate virulence genes during infection. We discovered that <i>Vibrio parahaemolyticus</i> VtrC, along with VtrA and VtrB, are required for activating the virulence type III secretion system 2 in response to bile salts. The VtrA/VtrC complex activates VtrB in the presence of bile salts. The crystal structure of the periplasmic domains of the VtrA/VtrC heterodimer reveals a \u03b2-barrel with a hydrophobic inner chamber. A co-crystal structure of VtrA/VtrC with bile salt, along with biophysical and mutational analysis, demonstrates that the hydrophobic chamber binds bile salts and activates the virulence network. As part of a family of conserved signaling receptors, VtrA/VtrC provides structural and functional insights into the evolutionarily conserved mechanism used by bacteria to sense their environment."

Enteric bacterial pathogens have developed strategies to sense bile as an environmental cue to regulate virulence genes during infection. We discovered that <i>Vibrio parahaemolyticus</i> VtrC, along with VtrA and VtrB, are required for activating the virulence type III secretion system 2 in response to bile salts. The VtrA/VtrC complex activates VtrB in the presence of bile salts. The crystal structure of the periplasmic domains of the VtrA/VtrC heterodimer reveals a \u03b2-barrel with a hydrophobic inner chamber. A co-crystal structure of VtrA/VtrC with bile salt, along with biophysical and mutational analysis, demonstrates that the hydrophobic chamber binds bile salts and activates the virulence network. As part of a family of conserved signaling receptors, VtrA/VtrC provides structural and functional insights into the evolutionarily conserved mechanism used by bacteria to sense their environment."

Its main components are bile salts, cholesterol, and phospholipids that together possess antimicrobial activities, challenging the survival and colonization of both pathogenic and commensal bacteria (<a href=\"#bib4\">Begley et al., 2005</a>). There is increasing evidence that enteric bacterial pathogens can utilize bile as a signaling cue to regulate gene expression profiles during host infection. For example, <i>Salmonella typhimurium</i> senses bile to repress the genes involved in invasion when growing in the intestinal lumen and induce their expression to promote invasion upon the penetration of the mucosal layer wherein the concentration of bile is decreased (<a href=\"#bib54\">Prouty and Gunn, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Prouty et al., 2004</a>). In <i>Shigella spp</i>., bile salts increase the pathogen's adherence and invasion of epithelial cells (<a href=\"#bib52\">Pope et al., 1995</a>). Bile also has important effects on the pathogenicity of <i>Vibrio</i> species, as observed in multiple studies with pathogenic strains of <i>V. cholerae</i> and <i>V. parahaemolyticus</i> (<a href=\"#bib25\">Gupta and Chowdhury, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Schuhmacher and Klose, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Krukonis and DiRita, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Faruque et al., 1998</a>). <i>V. cholerae</i> produces two major virulence factors during infection, cholera toxin (CT) and toxin-coregulated pilus (TCP), and these factors are repressed by ToxT in the presence of bile (<a href=\"#bib25\">Gupta and Chowdhury, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Schuhmacher and Klose, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Krukonis and DiRita, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Faruque et al., 1998</a>). However, it was also reported that bile can activate the production of CT independent of ToxT (<a href=\"#bib28\">Hung and Mekalanos, 2005</a>). Non-O1/non-O139 <i>V. cholerae</i> strains that do not encode CT and TCP can cause gastroenteritis and utilize bile to activate a pathogenic type III secretion system (<a href=\"#bib15\">Dziejman et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Chaand et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Alam et al., 2010</a>). Similarly, <i>V. parahaemolyticus</i> type III secretion system 2 (T3SS2) is induced specifically by bile salts during infection, resulting in acute gastroenteritis (<a href=\"#bib22\">Gotoh et al., 2010</a>). Despite these important discoveries, the mechanism of sensing bile salts by pathogenic bacteria remains unknown. To investigate this mystery, we used <i>V. parahaemolyticus</i> as a model to elucidate how <i>Vibrio spp.</i> sense bile salts as a signal to regulate the expression of virulence genes."

T3SSs encode needle-like secretion apparatuses used to deliver bacterial effector proteins, called Vops, which allow <i>V. parahaemolyticus</i> to invade and kill infected host cells (<a href=\"#bib8\">Broberg et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Makino et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Gal\u00e1n and Wolf-Watz, 2006</a>).

Furthermore, we demonstrate that the periplasmic domains of the transmembrane proteins, VtrA and VtrC, form a functional complex that binds bile salts to activate VtrA\u2019s cytoplasmic DNA binding domain, which in turn induces T3SS2 via the downstream transcription factor VtrB. The structure of VtrA/VtrC periplasmic domains reveals an obligate heterodimer where VtrC recruits structural elements from VtrA to complete a \u03b2-barrel with a hydrophobic inner chamber that binds bile salts. A co-crystal structure of the VtrA/VtrC heterodimer with a bile salt reveals that ligand binding occurs in the hydrophobic inner chamber of VtrC, similar to that found for the family of monomeric calycins. Mutations of residues within the hydrophobic chamber that are important for bile salt-binding disrupt bile salt activation of T3SS2. Collectively, we uncover a mechanism by which bacteria can sense bile salts, and reveal how an evolutionarily conserved receptor senses an environmental cue to induce the production of virulence factors."

The effect of VtrC is specific to T3SS2 because its deletion had no impact on the expression and secretion of the T3SS1 effector VopS (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>).

To verify the cellular localization and orientation of VtrC, we used two reporter proteins from <i>Escherichia coli</i>, alkaline phosphatase PhoA and \u03b2-galactosidase LacZ, whose activities depend on their subcellular localization. PhoA is active only in the periplasm after disulfide bond formation and dimerization, whereas LacZ only exhibits enzymatic activity in the cytoplasm where it can fold properly (<a href=\"#bib62\">van Geest and Lolkema, 2000</a>). PhoA or LacZ were fused to either the N-terminus or the C-terminus of VtrC and their activities were then measured to determine the localization of VtrC (<a href=\"#bib37\">Liu, 2003</a>). As expected, PhoA was active when fused to the C-terminus of VtrC, but not N-terminus (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>).

Given that VtrC is constitutively expressed and its C-terminal domain is oriented in the periplasm, we hypothesized that VtrC, like VtrA, functions upstream of VtrB. The deletion of <i>vtrC</i> did not change the mRNA level of VtrA (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Interestingly, deletion of <i>vtrC</i> resulted in decreased protein levels of VtrA independent of bile salts (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, lanes 3 and 7), suggesting that the presence of VtrC might stabilize VtrA. Ectopic expression of VtrC from a plasmid rescued VtrA levels (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, lanes 4 and 8). As was previously observed for VtrA, the absence of VtrC prevented the induction of <i>vtrB</i> upon T3SS2 activation with bile salts (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Thus, VtrC appears to function upstream of VtrB via a signaling cascade including VtrA. The observed degradation of VtrA in the absence of VtrC suggested that there might be a direct physical interaction between VtrA and VtrC."

Analysis of FLAG immunoprecipitates revealed that endogenous VtrA co-precipitated with VtrC, indicating that these two proteins interact in vivo (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, lanes 3 and 6). VtrA and VtrC interact in the presence and absence of bile salts, suggesting that these proteins interact independently of bile salts before activation of T3SS2 by bile salts, and remain in a complex after treatment with bile salts (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Notably, ectopic expression of FLAG-VtrC, but not FLAG-VtrC that is deleted for its N-terminal transmembrane domain (FLAG-VtrC\u0394N30), fully complemented the deletion of <i>vtrC</i> and restored the activity of T3SS2, confirming that the wild type FLAG-tagged is functional (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). However, we noticed that the apparent molecular weight of full-length FLAG-VtrC (12\u2009kDa) is smaller than the expected size of this protein (20\u2009kDa) suggesting that VtrC may be processed in the periplasm. In any event, our results support that VtrC and VtrA interact in vivo."

We predicted that the VtrA/VtrC interaction might stabilize the VtrC periplasmic domain. Therefore, we co-expressed the periplasmic domains of these two proteins in <i>E. coli</i>: amino acids 161\u2013253 of VtrA and N-terminal His-tagged 31\u2013161 of VtrC.

Two of the five selenomethionines were used for phasing. The two N-terminal methionines and Se-Met 115 in the loop that covers the beta barrel of VtrC were not observed in the final electron density map and were not included in the final model.

The eight \u03b2-strands of VtrC form a \u03b2-sheet meander that folds into itself to form a \u03b2-barrel with a small space between the first and last \u03b2-strands (A\u03b2 and I\u03b2)\u00a0(<a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). The \u03b2-barrel is lined on the inside by hydrophobic side chains (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>) and is covered on one side by the short \u03b1-helix (F\u03b1) and an adjacent disordered loop, which could not be modeled in its entirety due to the poor electron density of this region (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). The H\u03b2-I\u03b2 loop is particularly rich in aromatic side-chains, promoting us to hypothesize that this loop could be involved in binding the steroid ring structure of bile acids (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>). Despite the lack of sequence similarity to proteins of known function, VtrC shares structural similarity with lipocalins, fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs), avidins, metalloprotease inhibitors (MPIs), and other members of the calycin superfamily of proteins (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>) (<a href=\"#bib20\">Flower et al., 2000</a>). The inside of the calycin \u03b2-barrel often acts as a binding site for fatty acids and other hydrophobic molecules, such as retinol and biotin (<a href=\"#bib20\">Flower et al., 2000</a>). Comparison of the overall VtrC structure with other calycins suggests that it adopts a new fold within the superfamily. VtrC falls in between the lipocalins, which include a C-terminal helix that packs against the barrel on the corresponding VtrA interacting surface; and the FABPs, which include a \u03b2-hairpin insertion into the typical 8-stranded \u03b2-barrel in the position of the VtrC disordered loop. Interestingly, VtrA/VtrC would be the first member of this family that is an obligate dimer and not only binds a hydrophobic ligand but also transmits a signal upon binding."

The incorporation of structural elements from VtrA into the \u03b2-barrel fold suggests that VtrC may not fold properly in isolation and is consistent with our inability to purify the VtrC periplasmic domain in the absence of VtrA. Interestingly, the N-terminus of the VtrA periplasmic domain, leading to the transmembrane helix, contacts VtrC G\u03b2 and is in close proximity to the aromatic-rich H\u03b2-I\u03b2 loop (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>), leading us to hypothesize that these residues might be involved in signal transmission across the membrane in response to ligand binding."

Negative power deflections were observed throughout the titration of the bile salt TDC into the VtrA/VtrC solution.

The crystal structure was solved via molecular replacement by using our original VtrA/VtrC heterodimer as a search model, and refined to a resolution of 2.10\u2009\u00c5. The model reveals three VtrA/VtrC heterodimers in the asymmetric unit, each with clear electron density for one TDC molecule bound inside the \u03b2-barrel (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>, <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). A fourth TDC molecule mediated lattice contacts between VtrA chain A and its symmetry mate (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). An analysis of the macromolecular interfaces found in this crystalline lattice by the web server PDBePISA (<a href=\"#bib33\">Krissinel and Henrick, 2007</a>) indicated that the heterodimer is the only stable quaternary structure in solution. Although the three heterodimers in the asymmetric unit are highly similar, average root mean squared deviations (RMSD) of 0.5\u2009\u00c5 for VtrA and 0.6\u20131.5\u2009\u00c5 for VtrC indicates that there are differences in the VtrC monomer (<a href=\"#fig8s2\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 2A,E</a>). RSMD values of 0.4\u20130.5\u2009\u00c5 for VtrA and 1.2\u20131.9\u2009\u00c5 were obtained by superimposing each of the TDC-bound heterodimers to the apo structure (<a href=\"#fig8s2\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 2B-\u2013E</a>), indicating that the overall fold is maintained but there are considerable changes in the VtrC monomer. The largest differences between the VtrA/VtrC-TDC and the apo heterodimers are in the VtrC disordered loop and F\u03b1 that follows it. In the VtrA/VtrC-TDC heterodimer, the disordered loop has been displaced by the TDC molecule and is now observable in two out of the three heterodimers in the crystallographic asymmetric unit. Residues Thr122 and Ser123, which were in the disordered loop in the apo structure, now form part of F\u03b1 in two of the TDC-bound heterodimers. Remarkably, one of these residues (Ser123) now forms a hydrogen bond with the 12\u03b1-hydroxyl group of TDC (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>). The main chain amide between F150 and Tyr151 (H\u03b2-I\u03b2 loop) coordinates the 3\u03b1-hydroxyl group (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>), which is present in all bile salts, suggesting that this interaction is important for specificity towards bile salts. Several VtrC residues in the binding pocket maintain hydrophobic interactions with TDC, including the side chains of Phe150 with steroid ring A and Tyr81 with the hydrophobic part of the bile acid (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>)."

The mutation of His50, located at the top of the hydrophobic cleft, to an arginine residue is expected to produce steric hindrance by insertion of a large side chain into the bile salt binding pocket (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>). When VtrC-H50R was expressed in the <i>vtrC</i> deletion strain and bile salts were added, the T3SS2 could not be induced as indicated by the lack of expression and secretion of the T3SS2 effector VopA (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>, lanes 5 and 11). We also changed Tyr81 to an alanine residue, which we predicted would disrupt bile salt binding by eliminating the interaction between the Tyr81 aromatic ring and the bile salt side chain (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>). When VtrC-Y81A was expressed in the <i>vtrC</i> deletion strain and bile salts were added, the T3SS2 was not induced as indicated by the lack of expression and secretion of VopA (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>, lanes 6 and 12). As a control, we chose to mutate a surface exposed residue, Gln42, to an alanine (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>). As expected, this mutant rescued the <i>vtrC</i> deletion strain and upon addition of bile salts the T3SS2 was activated as indicated by the expression and secretion of VopA (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>, lanes 4 and 10).

Deciphering how bacteria use bile as a signal to regulate the expression of virulence genes is essential to our understanding of disease mechanisms and also can offer insights for designing novel therapeutic strategies. Bile salt-induced T3SSs are the primary virulence factor in many <i>Vibrio</i> species (<a href=\"#bib8\">Broberg et al., 2011</a>). In this study, we uncovered a previously unidentified component of a widespread, conserved signaling platform that is essential for bile salt sensing and activation of virulence factors in <i>Vibrios</i>.

The VtrA/VtrC heterodimer fold is similar to members of the calycin superfamily, which contain eight to ten-stranded \u03b2-barrels that often bind hydrophobic molecules (<a href=\"#bib20\">Flower et al., 2000</a>). Calycins have low sequence similarity, but relatively high structural conservation. They can be subdivided into several families based on structural details characteristic of each group (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>) (<a href=\"#bib20\">Flower et al., 2000</a>). Calycin families are markedly different in their distribution among biological kingdoms, cellular localization, and function, e.g.: (1) FABPs are cytosolic proteins involved in lipid homeostasis in animals, (2) MPIs are bacterial proteins that are secreted into the periplasm to inhibit metalloproteases, (3) lipocalins are found in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes, and they are mostly extracellular or attached to the outer membrane and bind a variety of ligands (<a href=\"#bib20\">Flower et al., 2000</a>). In terms of structure, VtrC does not seem to cluster with any particular family and it forms its own clade (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). Although calycins have been found to form complexes with other proteins, our inspection of the available structures of complexes did not reveal any arrangement that resembled that of the VtrA/VtrC obligate heterodimer. This complex is unique for this family because it is formed from two proteins and it is a complex that transmits a signal upon binding its ligand."

Analogous to VtrC's disordered loop and short \u03b1-helix, FABPs have a helix-turn-helix motif that forms a lid over one side of the barrel and is proposed to act as a portal for ligand access (<a href=\"#bib59\">Storch and McDermott, 2009</a>). In the case of FABPs, it has been suggested that ligand binding induces subtle conformational changes that promote protein-membrane or protein-protein interactions (<a href=\"#bib59\">Storch and McDermott, 2009</a>). We observe a similar scenario for the VtrA/VtrC obligate heterodimer bound to bile salts where, upon binding bile salt, it appears an unstructured loop is translocated from the inside of the hydrophobic chamber to the outside of the chamber, where it becomes structured. Future studies will focus on how a conformational change during bile salt binding may induce a switch in the VtrA/VtrC interaction that will result in activation of the VtrA cytoplasmic transcription activator domain (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>)."

GrlR is a cytosolic lipocalin that represses the LEE repressor GrlA by binding to its helix-turn-helix (HTH) domain. Similar to <i>vtrA</i> and <i>vtrC, grlR</i> and <i>grlA</i> are transcribed from a bicistronic operon, although the order of the lipocalin and transcriptional regulator genes is reversed in the latter pair. Analytical ultracentrifugation and the structure of GrlR in complex with the GrlA HTH domain revealed a heterotrimeric complex where a GrlR dimer binds one GrlA HTH monomer (PDB ID: 4KT5) (<a href=\"#bib50\">Padavannil et al., 2013</a>).

While the bile salt-induced T3SS in <i>V. cholerae</i> non-O1/O139 strains is necessary for bacterial colonization and the primary cause of disease during infection (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chaand et al., 2015</a>), the role of T3SS in <i>G. hollisae</i> infection is yet to be characterized. For other bacteria encoding <i>vtrA, vtrC</i> and <i>vtrB</i>, such as <i>Photobacterium marinum</i> and <i>V. caribbeanicus,</i> only a few T3SS related genes or no T3SS related genes are observed in their genomes, respectively. The differences between T3SS gene representation in these bacteria demonstrate this system's diversity and imply that the T3SS may be evolving in response to different living environments. Based on surrounding genes, this bile salt receptor complex may have adapted in other species to bind other hydrophilic ligands. For example, in the ten strains that lack a <i>vtrB</i> homolog but possess a <i>vtrA/vtrC</i> pair, the gene downstream of the <i>vtrA/vtrC</i> operon encodes a putative sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase. This enzyme is a hydrolase involved in the metabolism of sphingolipids (<a href=\"#bib24\">Go\u00f1i and Alonso, 2002</a>) and is a putative virulence factor (<a href=\"#bib47\">Oda et al., 2012</a>).

Because our VtrC PSI-BLAST hits were from different species than our VtrA hits, we initiated a transitive PSI-BLAST search against the NR database (threshold E-value cutoff 0.01) using the most distant identified VtrA sequence as a query (gi|494726765, aa 160\u2013272). The transitive search found the VtrA sequences from the remaining species containing VtrC. All identified VtrA and VtrC hits were found in tandem in their respective genomes, and representative sequences from non-redundant species were collected. VtrB sequences were identified by searching VtrA/VtrC-containing genomes for the VtrB sequence (VPA1348: gi|28901203). Due to widespread nature and strong conservation of the VtrB helix-turn-helix sequence in many transcription factors, we required VtrB orthologs to: 1. be the top-scoring hit in the respective genomes, 2. retain the predicted C-terminal transmembrane helix and 3. be in close proximity to the VtrA/VtrC gene pair. Representatives from each sequence family were aligned using the MAFFT server (<a href=\"http://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/server/\">http://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/server/</a>)."

The representative lipocalin-like domains were compared pairwise all-against-all using DaliLite (<a href=\"#bib27\">Holm and Park, 2000</a>). Pairwise DaliLite Z-scores (Z<sub>AB</sub>) were transformed to distances by comparing to self DaliLite Z-scores (Z<sub>AA</sub>, Z<sub>BB</sub>) using the following equation: -ln(Z<sub>AB</sub>/(0.5*Z<sub>AA</sub>+0.5*Z<sub>BB</sub>)).

This paper identifies a new component of this system, VtrC, that is in the membrane associated with VtrA. The authors crystalize the periplasmic interacting domains of VtrA and VtrC, in the absence of bile, and show the complex binds bile. This is a nice manuscript that definitely increases our understanding of this process, but I feel the authors overstep a bit in terms of the novelty of this work and their conclusions that they provide mechanistic insight into this process.

This particular phasing experiment utilized 1 Se site for 108 amino acids (as density for only 216 amino acids was observed and modeled by the final rounds of refinement), hence the chosen phasing method was MAD and not SAD. Data processing and phasing was performed in the graphical user interface of <i>HKL3000,</i> with autocorrections implemented to correct for systematic errors such as radiation damage and absorption, and to apply <i>B</i>-factor sharpening (Borek D, Dauter Z, Otwinowski Z. (2013) Identification of patterns in diffraction intensities affected by radiation exposure. <i>J Synchrotron Radiat</i> 20:37-48.). We have found the multiple corrections applied in the autocorrections routine of <i>HKL3000</i> to be critical to our success in phasing numerous difficult anomalous phasing projects. In this case, only the first wavelength (anomalous peak) was chosen for the heavy atom search, as more extensive radiation damage had occurred during the data collection for the second wavelength (inflection point). We performed a search for heavy atom positions to a resolution of 4.0 \u00c5 with <i>SHELXD</i> which identified two Se positions with correlation coefficients: CC<sub>All</sub> = 52.9% and CC<sub>Weak</sub> = 31.2%. It is difficult for the authors to understand what else they could have done with their data that could have resulted in <i>SHELXD</i> being able to locate additional selenium sites. Density for only two methionines was observed in the map from the final rounds of model refinement for the native protein (due to disorder of the N-terminal methionines from both monomers of the heterodimer, and the remaining missing methionine is located in the short disordered loop of five residues in VtrC). Both wavelengths were used for phasing in <i>MLPHARE</i>, with a resulting FOM of 0.25 for the complete resolution range from 35.7 \u2013 2.60 \u00c5. This compares well with the estimate of anomalous signal calculated in <i>PHENIX</i>:"

These hydrogen atoms are not located independently in an electron density map and refined independently of the non-hydrogen atoms in the model; rather, they are placed in geometrically idealized conformations with relation to the non-hydrogen atoms they are covalently bonded to and during positional refinement they are tied to their bonded atoms. These are thus known as \u201criding hydrogen atoms\u201d and they have been used for decades in small-molecule refinements (especially in cases where hydrogen atoms are not explicitly observed in the electron density maps). Since 2010 the program authors of <i>PHENIX</i> have encouraged users to incorporate riding hydrogen atoms into their refinement protocols (Adams P.D., <i>et al.</i> (2010) PHENIX \u2013 a comprehensive Python-based system for macromolecular structure solution. <i>Acta Crystallographica D Biol Crystallogr</i> <b>66</b>:213\u2013221; Afonine PV, Mustyakimov M, Grosse-Kunstleve RW, Moriarty NW, Langan P, Adams PD (2010) Joint X-ray and neutron refinement with phenix.refine. <i>Acta Crystallogr D Biol Crystallogr</i> <b>66</b>:1153-63.), and in fact, <i>REFMAC</i> adds the riding hydrogen atoms by default (<a href=\"http://www.ccp4.ac.uk/html/refmac5/keywords/restraints.html\">http://www.ccp4.ac.uk/html/refmac5/keywords/restraints.html</a>). The reasons for including riding hydrogen atoms in refinement are two-fold: 1) the hydrogen atoms actually exist in the molecules and contribute to the X-ray scattering at low resolution, so their inclusion in the refinement improves the agreement between <i>F<sub>obs</sub></i>and <i>F<sub>calc</sub></i> at low resolution; and 2) their inclusion improves the geometry of the refined model, as they are used to analyze clashes due to van der Waals repulsions. Jane and David Richardson have shown the utility of this method with the <i>MolProbity</i> server, which requires hydrogen atoms for the all-atom contact analysis it performs for validation of macromolecular structures (Chen et al. (2010) MolProbity: all-atom structure validation for macromolecular crystallography. <i>Acta Crystallographica D Biol Crystallogr</i> <b>66</b>:12-21.)."
