Transmission of these parasites relies on a stem cell-driven, clonal expansion of larvae inside a molluscan intermediate host. How this novel asexual reproductive strategy relates to current models of stem cell maintenance and germline specification is unclear. Here, we demonstrate that this proliferative larval cell population (germinal cells) shares some molecular signatures with stem cells from diverse organisms, in particular neoblasts of planarians (free-living relatives of schistosomes). We identify two distinct germinal cell lineages that differ in their proliferation kinetics and expression of a <i>nanos</i> ortholog. We show that a <i>vasa</i>/PL10 homolog is required for proliferation and maintenance of both populations, whereas <i>argonaute2</i> and a fibroblast growth factor receptor-encoding gene are required only for <i>nanos</i>-negative cells. Our results suggest that an ancient stem cell-based developmental program may have enabled the evolution of the complex life cycle of parasitic flatworms."

Transmission of these parasites relies on a stem cell-driven, clonal expansion of larvae inside a molluscan intermediate host. How this novel asexual reproductive strategy relates to current models of stem cell maintenance and germline specification is unclear. Here, we demonstrate that this proliferative larval cell population (germinal cells) shares some molecular signatures with stem cells from diverse organisms, in particular neoblasts of planarians (free-living relatives of schistosomes). We identify two distinct germinal cell lineages that differ in their proliferation kinetics and expression of a <i>nanos</i> ortholog. We show that a <i>vasa</i>/PL10 homolog is required for proliferation and maintenance of both populations, whereas <i>argonaute2</i> and a fibroblast growth factor receptor-encoding gene are required only for <i>nanos</i>-negative cells. Our results suggest that an ancient stem cell-based developmental program may have enabled the evolution of the complex life cycle of parasitic flatworms."

When the larval form of the parasite\u2014which cannot infect mammals\u2014enters the snail, the larvae undergo an unusual type of asexual embryogenesis. This results in thousands of parasites that are capable of infecting mammals. Studies suggest that a population of cells known as germinal cells are responsible for this transformation and replication process, but little is known about these cells at the molecular level."

The life cycle initiates as eggs are excreted from a mammalian host into freshwater, releasing ciliated, free-swimming larvae called miracidia that seek out and penetrate a snail intermediate host. Entry into the snail triggers a series of morphological, physiological, and biochemical transformations (<a href=\"#bib2\">Basch and DiConza, 1974</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Kawamoto et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Ludtmann et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Wu et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Parker-Manuel et al., 2011</a>), followed by a clonal expansion of the larvae (called sporocysts at this stage) inside the snail host, ultimately producing thousands of infective cercariae (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib6\">Cheng and Bier, 1972</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Ward et al., 1988</a>). Mature cercariae then emerge from the snail into freshwater, burrow through the epidermis of mammalian hosts, migrate to species-specific niches in the host vascular system, develop to adulthood, and begin to reproduce sexually, thereby completing the life cycle. Thus, asexual amplification inside of the snail is vital for propagation of schistosomes."

Early ultrastructural and histological studies recognized these cells by their stem cell-like morphology and rapid cycling kinetics (<a href=\"#bib44\">Schutte, 1974</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Pan, 1980</a>). In support of the totipotency of these germinal cells, serial transplantation of sporocysts into naive snail hosts led to continuous sporocyst propagation and cercarial production (<a href=\"#bib21\">Jourdane and Th\u00e9ron, 1980</a>). These classic studies led to the model that division of these diploid presumptive totipotent stem cells in mother sporocysts produces progeny that are able to independently initiate the embryogenesis of daughter sporocysts (<a href=\"#bib54\">Whitfield and Evans, 1983</a>). These daughter sporocysts, which are essentially sacs filled with germinal cells, can then produce more daughter sporocysts or infective cercariae in the same manner as they were generated themselves. This process represents \u2018polyembryony\u2019\u2014during which multiple embryos are produced from the same zygote with no intervening gamete production. Thus, germinal cells appear to possess a unique developmental program, and it is unknown how they are specified, maintained, and regulated molecularly."

Guided by this knowledge, we recently identified a population of neoblast-like cells in adult <i>Schistosoma mansoni</i> (<a href=\"#bib11\">Collins et al., 2013</a>). These observations led us to hypothesize that germinal cells underlying schistosome asexual amplification may share a similar molecular program. Here, we show that the proliferating cells in sporocysts express many conserved stem cell genes. Using RNA interference (RNAi) we identify conserved regulators that are required to maintain the proliferative capacity of these cells. The similarity between these germinal cells in schistosome larvae, somatic stem cells in schistosome adults, and planarian neoblasts, links embryonic development and homeostatic tissue maintenance in these parasites; furthermore, it suggests that adaptation of an ancient stem cell developmental program may have enabled the evolution of complex trematode life cycles."

Thus, we screened a number of nucleic acid-binding dyes and determined that POPO-1 clearly distinguishes the RNA-rich germinal cells from the other somatic cell types.

To define this transition more precisely and examine the initiation of cell proliferation, at different times following in vitro transformation, we treated sporocysts with 5-ethynyl-2\u2032-deoxyuridine (EdU), a thymidine analogue that is incorporated into DNA during S-phase of the cell cycle (<a href=\"#bib42\">Salic and Mitchison, 2008</a>). For these experiments, miracidia were transformed to mother sporocysts in vitro and co-cultured with an immortalized snail cell line (<i>Bge</i> cells) under hypoxic conditions (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib56\">Yoshino and Laursen, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Ivanchenko et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Bixler et al., 2001</a>). During the first 20 hr after transformation, few cells incorporated EdU. However, between 20\u201324 hr, we typically observed 1\u20132 clusters of EdU<sup>+</sup> germinal cells, which are identified by their nucleolar and cytoplasmic POPO-1 staining. At later time points (48\u201364 hr), a large fraction of germinal cells in the sporocyst incorporated EdU, and all EdU<sup>+</sup> cells exhibit a germinal cell-specific morphology. These cells were actively dividing as we routinely observed many mitotic figures in these samples (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1D and 2A</a>). As a result of this massive proliferative burst, these germinal cells increased dramatically in number and came to occupy most of the sporocyst body, tripling sporocyst size during the first 3 days. These results suggest that a tightly regulated, sharp developmental transition begins at \u223c20 hr post-transformation, when the first wave of proliferation starts."

Given the differences in how these datasets were generated (i.e., FACS-purified cells from planarian vs whole schistosome sporocysts), together with the fact that the miracidium-to-sporocyst transformation is expected to result in transcriptional changes independent of germinal cell number, this degree of overlap seems likely to underestimate the similarity between the transcriptomes of germinal cells and planarian neoblasts."

Monitoring the ratio of these two cell populations over time, we found the <i>nanos-2</i><sup><i>\u2212</i></sup> population expanded at a higher rate (doubling time \u223c24 hr) than the <i>nanos-2</i><sup><i>+</i></sup> population (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). To examine if these cells possess differences in their cell cycle kinetics, we pulsed sporocysts with EdU for various lengths of time and determined the fraction of <i>nanos-2</i><sup><i>+</i></sup>or <i>nanos-2</i><sup><i>\u2212</i></sup> germinal cells that were EdU<sup>+</sup> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,D</a>). Following a 4-hr EdU pulse, \u223c70% of the <i>nanos-2</i><sup><i>\u2212</i></sup> cells were EdU<sup>+</sup>, whereas only \u223c5% of the <i>nanos-2</i><sup><i>+</i></sup> cells were EdU<sup>+</sup>. The fraction of <i>nanos-2</i><sup><i>+</i></sup> cells that were EdU<sup>+</sup> increased to \u223c40% with an 8-hr pulse, and to \u223c75% with a 16-hr pulse. With either an 8-hr or 16-hr pulse, \u223c95% of <i>nanos-2</i><sup><i>\u2212</i></sup> germinal cells were EdU<sup>+</sup>. To rule out the possibility that EdU<sup>+</sup>/<i>nanos-2</i><sup><i>+</i></sup> cells are progeny of the more rapidly proliferating <i>nanos-2</i><sup><i>\u2212</i></sup> cells, we administrated a short 4-hr EdU pulse followed by a 12-hr chase period in the absence of EdU. We found that only 6% of <i>nanos-2</i><sup><i>+</i></sup> cells were EdU<sup>+</sup>. Since a similar fraction of EdU<sup>+</sup>/<i>nanos-2</i><sup><i>+</i></sup> cells is observed immediately following a pulse (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>), it is unlikely that <i>nanos-2</i><sup><i>\u2212</i></sup> germinal cells differentiate to produce <i>nanos-2</i><sup><i>+</i></sup> cells. Collectively, these observations suggest that <i>nanos-2</i><sup><i>+</i></sup> germinal cells have a longer cell cycle and enter S-phase less often than do <i>nanos-2</i><sup><i>\u2212</i></sup> germinal cells.

For these experiments parasites were treated with double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) continuously while in the egg, after hatching, and during sporocyst development (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Using this procedure we were able to achieve robust reductions (&gt;80%) in both <i>ago-2</i> and <i>vlg-3</i> mRNA levels, as measured by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). To assess the functions of these genes we monitored EdU incorporation in RNAi-treated parasites. Consistent with these genes regulating germinal cell proliferation, RNAi of either <i>ago2-1</i> or <i>vlg-3</i> resulted in significantly fewer EdU<sup>+</sup> germinal cells following a 24-hr EdU pulse (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,C</a>). Inhibition of either <i>ago-2</i> or <i>vlg-3</i> also resulted in a significant reduction in the levels of cell cycle-associated transcripts such as <i>polo kinase</i> and <i>histone H2B</i>, as well as germinal cell-associated genes (<i>ago2-1</i>, <i>vlg-3</i>, and <i>fgfrA</i>) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). To resolve whether these effects were due to defects in cell proliferation or loss of the germinal cells, we examined the expression pattern of germinal cell markers by FISH after RNAi treatments. We observed that RNAi of <i>vlg-3</i> resulted in the loss of both <i>nanos-2</i><sup><i>+</i></sup> and <i>nanos-2</i><sup><i>\u2212</i></sup> germinal cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>), suggesting that it promotes the maintenance of the entire germinal cell population. In contrast to <i>vlg-3,</i> reduction of <i>ago2-1</i> levels resulted in loss of only <i>nanos-2</i><sup><i>\u2212</i></sup> germinal cells; <i>nanos-2</i><sup>+</sup> cells were still present (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>). However, the absence of proliferation after <i>ago2-1</i> RNAi (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>) suggests that the remaining <i>nanos-2</i><sup><i>+</i></sup> cells fail to proliferate. These observations are consistent with qPCR quantification, in which expression of <i>nanos-2</i> was reduced after <i>vlg-3</i> RNAi but retained after <i>ago2-1</i> RNAi (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>)."

These germinal cells also exhibit many transcriptional and functional similarities with the neoblasts of free-living planarians. In planarians, PRC2 components are enriched in neoblasts, and are required for neoblast self-renewal and long-term maintenance (<a href=\"#bib51\">Wagner et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">\u00d6nal et al., 2012</a>); disruption of <i>ago2</i> expression downregulates a specific set of miRNAs and blocks neoblast self-renewal (<a href=\"#bib41\">Rouhana et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Li et al., 2011</a>); <i>Smed-fgfr1</i> is expressed in a subset of planarian neoblasts; <i>Smed-fgfr4</i> (<a href=\"#bib51\">Wagner et al., 2012</a>) and <i>Smed-bruli</i> (<a href=\"#bib18\">Guo et al., 2006</a>) are both enriched in neoblasts; and <i>vasa</i> is required for the proliferation and expansion of neoblasts (<a href=\"#bib41\">Rouhana et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Wagner et al., 2012</a>). Although schistosomes do not have a true <i>vasa</i> ortholog, the <i>vasa</i>/PL10 homolog <i>vlg3</i> may have assumed a \u2018vasa-like\u2019 role in schistosome stem cell maintenance (<a href=\"#bib49\">Tsai et al., 2013</a>). Consistent with this idea, <i>vasa</i>/PL10 homologs in monogenean flatworms, which also lack <i>vasa</i>, are essential for germline development (<a href=\"#bib32\">Ohashi et al., 2007</a>). This conservation at both the cellular and molecular levels suggests an ancient role for these genes in regulating stem cell populations in flatworms. In light of these observations, it is plausible to suggest that neoblast-driven developmental programs inherited from their free-living ancestors may have enabled the evolution of complex trematode life cycles. These pluripotent cells may help the worms adapt successfully to obligate parasitism, by enabling both rapid expansion of an infective population and long-term tissue maintenance in the hostile environments within their intermediate and definitive hosts. Thus, future studies deciphering the evolutionary relationships between various neoblast-like cell populations are essential to understand the successful transmission and pathogenesis of various parasitic flatworms."

In these parasites, proliferating germinal cells are present as two morphologically distinguishable populations (<a href=\"#bib16\">Galaktionov and Dobrovolskij, 2003</a>). One of these populations, smaller in cell size, was speculated to be the most \u2018undifferentiated\u2019 cell type, whereas the other was thought to have more restricted developmental potential and enter embryogenesis directly. Although this morphological heterogeneity was not observed in schistosomes (<a href=\"#bib35\">Pan, 1980</a>), our results uncovered molecular heterogeneity in these germinal cells. The observation that germinal cells expressing <i>nanos-2</i> exhibit slower cell-cycle kinetics is consistent with the conserved role of <i>nanos</i> in lengthening the cell cycle by repressing mitotic transcripts in primordial germ cells from many animals (<a href=\"#bib22\">Juliano et al., 2010</a>). Along with our observations that <i>nanos-2</i> is also expressed in germ cells in schistosome adult gonads (Wang and Newmark, unpublished) as well as adult somatic stem cells (<a href=\"#bib11\">Collins et al., 2013</a>), it is reasonable to expect the <i>nanos-2</i><sup><i>+</i></sup> cells may be more totipotent or germ cell-like, whereas the <i>nanos-2</i><sup><i>\u2212</i></sup> germinal cells may be more primed towards somatic fates. Given recent advances (<a href=\"#bib15\">Dvo\u0159\u00e1k et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Rinaldi et al., 2012</a>), transgenic approaches to dissect the existence of such a developmental hierarchy may be possible in the future."

This conserved molecular context opens access to understanding these cells, and may lead to strategies for intervening and blocking the transmission of the disease."
