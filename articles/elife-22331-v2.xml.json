                    "text": "Voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels are involved in numerous physiological functions and various mechanisms finely tune their activity, including the Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion itself. This is well exemplified by the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent inactivation of L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, whose alteration contributes to the dramatic disease Timothy Syndrome. For T-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, a long-held view is that they are not regulated by intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Here we challenge this notion by using dedicated electrophysiological protocols on both native and expressed T-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. We demonstrate that a rise in submembrane Ca<sup>2+</sup> induces a large decrease in T-type current amplitude due to a hyperpolarizing shift in the steady-state inactivation. Activation of most representative Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable ionotropic receptors similarly regulate T-type current properties. Altogether, our data clearly establish that Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry exerts a feedback control on T-type channel activity, by modulating the channel availability, a mechanism that critically links cellular properties of T-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels to their physiological roles."

This is well exemplified by the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent inactivation of L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, whose alteration contributes to the dramatic disease Timothy Syndrome. For T-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, a long-held view is that they are not regulated by intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Here we challenge this notion by using dedicated electrophysiological protocols on both native and expressed T-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. We demonstrate that a rise in submembrane Ca<sup>2+</sup> induces a large decrease in T-type current amplitude due to a hyperpolarizing shift in the steady-state inactivation. Activation of most representative Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable ionotropic receptors similarly regulate T-type current properties. Altogether, our data clearly establish that Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry exerts a feedback control on T-type channel activity, by modulating the channel availability, a mechanism that critically links cellular properties of T-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels to their physiological roles."

VGCCs are therefore involved in neuronal and cardiac excitability as well as in muscle contraction, neurotransmitter release, hormone secretion and gene expression (<a href=\"#bib6\">Berridge et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Mangoni and Nargeot, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Catterall, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Simms and Zamponi, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Zamponi et al., 2015</a>). Consequently the modulation of VGCC activity plays a pivotal role in the regulation of cardiac and brain activities and this modulation is controlled by a variety of processes, including intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> itself, which provides an important Ca<sup>2+</sup>-driven feedback control (<a href=\"#bib25\">Eckert and Chad, 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Z\u00fchlke et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Peterson et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Liang et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Green et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Tsuruta et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Oliveria et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Hall et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Zamponi et al., 2015</a>)."

It was well demonstrated that both Cav1 and Cav2 channels are modulated by intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<a href=\"#bib43\">Liang et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Dick et al., 2008</a>). For the Cav1 / L-type VGCCs, this Ca<sup>2+</sup> feedback mechanism has been extensively studied in a wide spectrum of biological contexts and a rise in submembrane Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration induces complex effects depending on both the Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration and the duration of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry (<a href=\"#bib25\">Eckert and Chad, 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Z\u00fchlke et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Peterson et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Liang et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Green et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Tsuruta et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Oliveria et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Hall et al., 2013</a>). At the millisecond time scale, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry via L-type channels induces a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent inactivation (CDI) characterized by an acceleration of their inactivation kinetics (<a href=\"#bib25\">Eckert and Chad, 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Z\u00fchlke et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Peterson et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Liang et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Hall et al., 2013</a>). For several seconds to a\u00a0few minutes of stimulation, the cumulative Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry induces a decrease of the L-type current amplitude, which is reversible if stimulation ceases for several minutes (<a href=\"#bib25\">Eckert and Chad, 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Oliveria et al., 2007</a>, <a href=\"#bib51\">2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Hall et al., 2013</a>). For longer period of stimulation, or activation of the ionotropic NMDA receptors, L-type channels are internalized, potentially degraded in lysosomes or recycled to the plasma membrane depending on the amount and the duration of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry (<a href=\"#bib30\">Green et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Tsuruta et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Hall et al., 2013</a>). This precise Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent regulation of the L-type channel activity has a strong physiological role in avoiding cytotoxicity arising from Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload (<a href=\"#bib42\">Lee et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Berridge et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Green et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Tsuruta et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Hall et al., 2013</a>).

The low-voltage-activated, T-type/Cav3 channels are specifically activated by small membrane depolarization below the threshold of classical sodium action potentials, producing a Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry near the resting membrane potential and low-threshold Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes (<a href=\"#bib34\">Huguenard, 1996</a>, <a href=\"#bib35\">1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Perez-Reyes, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Zamponi, 2016</a>). Importantly, availability of Cav3 channels is critically regulated by the resting membrane potential to control T-type channel activity. Because of the negative range of their steady-state inactivation (V<sub>0.5</sub> near \u221270 mV), Cav3 channels are partially inactivated (reduced availability) in the range of the resting membrane potential of most neurons and a membrane hyperpolarization (usually triggered by inhibitory postsynaptic events) is needed to allow their recovery from inactivation (de-inactivation) and their subsequent opening (<a href=\"#bib34\">Huguenard, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Perez-Reyes, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Zamponi, 2016</a>). This behavior is of particular importance in many types of neurons, in which Cav3 channels mediate rebound burst firing, especially in the thalamo-cortical circuit, where Cav3 channels control transition between awake and sleep states (<a href=\"#bib34\">Huguenard, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Perez-Reyes, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Beenhakker and Huguenard, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Zamponi, 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Tatsuki et al., 2016</a>). Overall, Cav3 channels are involved in the control of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis (<a href=\"#bib13\">Chemin et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Bijlenga et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Perez-Reyes, 2003</a>), in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent differentiation of neuronal, muscular and neuroendocrine cells (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bijlenga et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Mariot et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Chemin et al., 2002b</a>), as well as in Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload toxicity in ischemia (<a href=\"#bib49\">Nikonenko et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Bancila et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Gouriou et al., 2013</a>). Importantly, an increase in the Cav3 channel activity has been implicated in several diseases including epilepsy, chronic pain, autism and primary aldosteronism (<a href=\"#bib5\">Beenhakker and Huguenard, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Zamponi, 2016</a>). Although it is evident that a tight control of Cav3 channel activity is necessary to maintain Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis, there is no evidence yet that Cav3 channels are regulated by intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions and/or by Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry."

Cav3 currents were recorded in the presence of 2 mM extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> using fast test-pulse (TP) stimulation (1 Hz), which allows a cumulative Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry. Experiments were performed after dialyzing the cell with 10 mM EGTA, which delimits the change in Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration only at the vicinity of the channel (<a href=\"#bib47\">Marty and Neher, 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Roberts, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Deisseroth et al., 1996</a>). The Cav3.3 current amplitude recorded using fast TP stimulation (1 Hz) progressively decreased to ~50% of the control value (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a</a>). In average, the current decrease was maximal and stable after ~40 s with an average half-time of 18 s (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a and f</a>). The current decrease was also associated with a marked acceleration of the inactivation kinetics (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a</a>), ~3 times after 40 s stimulation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2e</a>). This effect was fully reversible and activity-dependent since the stopping of the TP stimulation for only 5 s already induced ~30% recovery of the current. Recovery was complete after ~2 min without TP stimulation with an average half-time of 20 s (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2f</a>)."

We first hypothesized that the recovery from inactivation of the Cav3.3 current might be affected during a fast stimulation protocol in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive manner. A paired-pulse protocol with increasing inter-pulse durations (100, 400 or 1000 ms) was designed to analyze the kinetics of recovery from the first (Stim 1) to the fortieth (Stim 40) paired-pulse stimulation, as exemplified for an inter-pulse duration of 100 ms in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3a</a>. These experiments revealed that the recovery kinetics of the Cav3.3 current was unaffected at the three inter-pulse durations tested (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b</a>). In contrast, we found that the steady-state inactivation of Cav3.3 current was strongly modified using fast stimulation protocols. This was evidenced using a paired-pulse protocol with variable inter-pulse potentials ranging from \u221240 to \u2212110 mV (as exemplified for an inter-pulse potential of \u221270 mV in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3c</a>). This fast stimulation protocol produced a\u00a0~10 mV hyperpolarizing shift in the <i>V</i><sub>0.5</sub> value of the steady-state inactivation curve (from \u221272.4 mV for Stim 1 to \u221281.1 mV for the Stim 40, p<i>&lt;</i>0.001), without any change in the slope of the inactivation curve (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3d</a>). Importantly, this effect was lost in the presence of intracellular BAPTA (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3d</a>). In addition, we found that the fast stimulation of Cav3.3 current also induced a small but significant leftward shift in the steady-state activation (from \u221252.6 to \u221255.9 mV, p<i>&lt;</i>0.01) as well as an increase in the slope of the activation curve (from 4.7 to 5.6 mV, p<i>&lt;</i>0.05, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3e\u2013f</a>)."

In order to test this possibility, the Cav3.3 current properties before and after fast stimulation were modeled using the Hodgkin-Huxley formalism as previously described for the native T-type current in thalamic neuron (<a href=\"#bib33\">Huguenard and Prince, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Destexhe et al., 1996</a>). We used the NEURON simulation environment (<a href=\"#bib32\">Hines and Carnevale, 1997</a>) as modified previously in order to perform voltage-clamp experiments (<a href=\"#bib20\">Destexhe et al., 1996</a>). In this simulation, the model indicated that the Cav3.3 current elicited from HP \u221270 mV would decrease\u00a0~75% (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4a</a>) according to the shift in the steady-state inactivation observed in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3d</a>. To validate experimentally these data, we performed voltage-clamp experiments at different HPs. Using 0.2 Hz frequency of TP stimulation (to allow current recovery at more depolarized HPs), the decrease in Cav3.3 current was below 20% at HP \u2212110 mV whereas the current decrease was more prominent (~40%, p<i>&lt;</i>0.01) at HP \u221280 mV (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4b</a>). Interestingly, the decrease in Cav3.3 current was also reduced at HPs above \u221270 mV and was less than 10% at HP \u221255 mV (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4c</a>). This U-shaped relationship (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4c</a>) could be explained by two interlinked mechanisms: (i) at negative membrane potentials (below \u221290 mV) the shift in the steady-state inactivation curve has little impact on the decrease in current amplitude (see <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3d</a>); (ii) the small decrease observed at HPs above \u221270 mV would be related to the reduced Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry at depolarized membrane potentials."

At HP \u2212100 mV during 40 s, the fast TP stimulation induced a large Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry as evidenced by the decrease in Cav3.3 current amplitude (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5b</a>, left panel). Then, when the HP was immediately switched to \u221270 mV (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5b</a>, right panel), we observed a significant increase in the current amplitude, i.e. recovery, that reached a steady-state after\u00a0~100 s (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5b</a>). The Cav3.3 current increased furthermore after the stopping of the simulation for 2 min (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5b</a>). The average current amplitude increase during these experiments was\u00a0~400% when using a 0.2 Hz TP stimulation, and up to 600% at 1 Hz (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5d</a>). Similarly, large effects on the Cav3.1 current were also found in these experiments (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5c</a>). Whereas the Cav3.1 current decreased only modestly at HP \u2212100 mV (~10%, see also <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2g</a>), the increase in the Cav3.1 current following the switch to HP \u221270 mV reached\u00a0~600% (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5c and d</a>) as described for the Cav3.3 current. This strong recovery of Cav3.3 and Cav3.1 currents at depolarized HPs clearly indicate that the shift in the steady-state inactivation is a dynamic and reversible mechanism. Importantly, no increase in Cav3.3 and Cav3.1 current was obtained in cells dialyzed with BAPTA (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5d</a>), further confirming a local Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent feedback mechanism."

This finding suggests that because of its biophysical properties, i.e. rapid inactivation kinetics (as compared to Cav3.3) and its slow recovery from inactivation (as compared to Cav3.1 and Cav3.3) (<a href=\"#bib39\">Kl\u00f6ckner et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Kozlov et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Satin and Cribbs, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Chemin et al., 2002a</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Perez-Reyes, 2003</a>), the Cav3.2 current generated in fast TP stimulation does not allow sufficient Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry to induce the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent regulation observed for Cav3.1 and Cav3.3 channels. To directly test this hypothesis, we have studied a Cav3.2 gain of function mutant at Met1549, recently identified in patients with hypertension due to primary aldosteronism (<a href=\"#bib57\">Scholl et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Daniil et al., 2016</a>). The Met1549Ile Cav3.2 mutant presents slower inactivation and deactivation kinetics and is expected to induce much larger Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry than the wild-type channel (<a href=\"#bib18\">Daniil et al., 2016</a>). We found that the Met1549Ile Cav3.2 current decreased by\u00a0~15% during 1 Hz stimulation at HP \u2212100 mV, whereas the current progressively increased when switched at HP \u221280 mV to reach a\u00a0~300% increase (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1c</a>).

In these experiments, we found that the Cav3.3 current progressively increased during the first burst of spikes and then progressively decreased during the time course of the stimulation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6a</a>). In addition, a \u2018rebound\u2019 in the Cav3.3 current was clearly associated with the depolarization after potential (DAP) transition, as previously described (<a href=\"#bib14\">Chemin et al., 2002a</a>). We estimated the current increase as the ratio of the Cav3.3 current obtained at the fourth spike to the first one (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6b</a>), whereas the decrease of the current was estimated as the ratio of the Cav3.3 current obtained at the thirteenth spike to the first one (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6c</a>). Interestingly, the Cav3.3 current increase was similar when cells were dialyzed with an intracellular medium containing either EGTA or BAPTA and reached in average\u00a0~300%, suggesting that the current increase is not dependent of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (p<i>&gt;</i>0.05, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6b</a>). In contrast, the decrease in the Cav3.3 current was bigger in cells dialyzed with EGTA as compared to BAPTA-dialyzed cells (p<i>&lt;</i>0.001, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6c</a>). Importantly, these results were obtained during the first stimulation of the Cav3.3 current suggesting that the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent modulation of the Cav3.3 current could have a strong neuronal impact. To further investigate the behavior of the Cav3.3 current during AP clamp experiments, we performed this stimulation several times at a frequency of 1 Hz whereas the cells were clamped at HP \u2212100 mV between each stimulation to allow Cav3.3 current recovery (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6a</a>). We found that the Cav3.3 current recorded during an AP as well as the \u2018rebound\u2019 in the Cav3.3 current associated with the DAP progressively decreased when the protocol was repeated 40 times in cells dialyzed with EGTA (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1a</a>). To account for the total Cav3.3 current variation, we calculated the integral of the Cav3.3 current at each stimulation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6d</a>). This analysis revealed that the total Cav3.3 current decrease was\u00a0~80% in cells dialyzed with EGTA whereas the current decrease was less than 15% in cells dialyzed with BAPTA (p<i>&lt;</i>0.001, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6d</a>), indicating further the robust Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent modulation of Cav3.3 current during AP-clamp stimulation."

In cells co-expressing the purinergic P2X4 receptor and Cav3.1, the Cav3.1 current was strongly decreased after extracellular perfusion of a solution containing the purinergic agonist ATP, which generated an inward current of several seconds (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7a</a>). Similar results were obtained for Cav3.2 and Cav3.3 currents, and ATP caused in average\u00a0~80% inhibition of the three Cav3 current (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7b</a>). The decrease in Cav3 current induced by P2X4 activation was coupled to an acceleration of the current inactivation kinetics (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7c</a>) and a negative shift in the steady-state inactivation (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7d</a>). Importantly, these effects were absent when similar experiments were performed in the absence of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7b</a>). Because the current decrease could involve a change in the cell surface density of the channels, we have investigated whether the membrane expression of Cav3.3 channels would be modulated by P2X4 activation (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). To this end, we used a Cav3.3 channel construct containing an extracellular HA tag (<a href=\"#bib3\">Baumgart et al., 2008</a>), which allows the measure of its cell surface expression by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay/luminometry (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1a</a>). We found that the ATP treatment did not induce significant change in membrane expression of Cav3.3-HA channels in cells co-transfected with either the P2X4 receptor or the pcDNA3 plasmid (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1b</a>), suggesting that the current decrease did not involve a change in the cell surface density of the channels. To extend these findings to other classes of physiologically relevant ionotropic receptors, electrophysiological experiments were performed with the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable NMDA, 5-HT3, TRPA1 and TRPV1 receptors (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7e</a>). According to the results obtained with the P2X4 receptors, activation of all these receptors produced a 60% to 90% decrease of Cav3.1, Cav3.2 and Cav3.3 currents and this effect was only observed in the presence of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (p<i>&lt;</i>0.001, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7e</a>).

This novel regulation involves a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent modulation of Cav3 availability. It was unraveled by demonstrating that a rise in submembrane Ca<sup>2+</sup> at the vicinity of the Cav3 channels can cause a hyperpolarizing shift in the steady-state inactivation, leading to a strong Cav3 current decrease at physiological resting membrane potentials. This localized increase in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> can be generated by the Cav3 channel activity itself, especially for Cav3.3 channels, or by other routes of Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry through the plasma membrane as obtained following activation of various Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable ionotropic receptors, all inducing a potent inhibition of Cav3.1, Cav3.2 and Cav3.3 currents. Importantly, all the effects described here were observed in 2 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>-containing saline, which corresponds to the physiological range of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration in native tissues (<a href=\"#bib37\">Jones and Keep, 1988</a>), and were lost in the presence of intracellular BAPTA."

The decrease in Cav3.3 current amplitude was well correlated with the increase in the frequency of the TP stimulation. The reduction in Cav3.3 current amplitude was ~50% at 1 Hz frequency of stimulation and reached ~80% during neuronal activities in action potential clamp, suggesting that intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> could be an important physiological regulator of Cav3 current. Importantly, this effect was very dynamic both in its induction (T<sub>0.5</sub>~18 s) and in its recovery (T<sub>0.5</sub>~20 s). Altogether, our results demonstrate that the Cav3 current decrease is linked to the cumulative Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry through Cav3 channels. This Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent inhibition of Cav3 channels was observed only in the presence of external Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicating that a voltage-dependent component in the mechanism is unlikely to contribute to the reported effect. Importantly, this Cav3 current inhibition induced by the Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry is observed using intracellular EGTA but not anymore after the cell dialysis with BAPTA. These data reveal that this Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent modulation of Cav3 channels involves a localized increase in submembrane Ca<sup>2+</sup> at the vicinity of the Cav3 channels without the need for a global Ca<sup>2+</sup> increase (<a href=\"#bib47\">Marty and Neher, 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Roberts, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Deisseroth et al., 1996</a>). Interestingly, in the inside-out patch configuration, the direct application of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-containing solutions up to 100 \u00b5M to the internal side of the membrane did not produce the current inhibition, suggesting that this phenomenon requires some additional components preserved in the whole-cell configuration."

On the other hand, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry via T-type channels is maximal at negative Vm (~\u00a0\u2212100 mV), but the consequence of the shift in the steady-state inactivation is minimized at negative Vm (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). Consequently, the inhibition of the Cav3 current is maximal at physiological resting membrane potentials after stimulation at negative HP. Using this paradigm our data revealed an important finding: a wide range of modulation (~600%) of both Cav3.3 and Cav3.1 currents, but not of Cav3.2 current which was resistant to this modulation."

It is noteworthy that the tsA-201 cells, which derived from HEK-293 cells, endogenously express another class of purinergic receptors, P2Y, which are Gq-coupled receptors and induce a global increase in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> in response to ATP (<a href=\"#bib13\">Chemin et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Fischer et al., 2005</a>).

More recently, these findings were confirmed using cloned T-type channels (<a href=\"#bib61\">Staes et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">McRory et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Perez-Reyes, 2003</a>) but see (<a href=\"#bib41\">Lacinov\u00e1 et al., 2006</a>). Indeed, our data showing that the inactivation kinetics are similar at the beginning of the stimulation obtained in external Ca<sup>2+</sup> and in external sodium (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2e</a>) also support the lack of CDI for Cav3 channels. Accordingly, the important structural motifs for CDI present on L-type channels, as the Ca<sup>2+</sup> (EF Hand) and the calmodulin (IQ motif) binding sites are absent on the C-terminus of Cav3 channels (<a href=\"#bib61\">Staes et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">McRory et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Perez-Reyes, 2003</a>). Therefore, CDI was considered in pioneer studies as a hallmark to distinguish between L-type and T-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents (<a href=\"#bib11\">Carbone and Lux, 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Fedulova et al., 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Bean, 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Bossu et al., 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Bossu and Feltz, 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Dupont et al., 1986</a>). Increasing the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>INT</sub> from 10<sup>\u221210</sup> to 10<sup>\u22127</sup> M or even to 10<sup>\u22126</sup> M was classically used to isolate a \u2018pure\u2019 T-type current, which presented no change in its inactivation kinetics, whereas the L-type current disappeared because of the acceleration of its \u2018run-down\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib9\">Bossu et al., 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Bossu and Feltz, 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Dupont et al., 1986</a>). Interestingly, in these seminal studies, the native T-type current was mostly related to Cav3.2 (nickel-sensitive) channels (<a href=\"#bib11\">Carbone and Lux, 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Fedulova et al., 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Bean, 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Bossu et al., 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Bossu and Feltz, 1986</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Dupont et al., 1986</a>), for which we show that the intrinsic electrophysiological properties do not allow the triggering of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent current inhibition, contrary to Cav3.1 and Cav3.3 channels. However, and consistent with our present findings, these early studies performed in the presence of an increasing amount of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>INT</sub> have reported important features of the T-type current: (1) at 10<sup>\u22128</sup> M, the T-type current was stable during 60 min whereas at 10<sup>\u22127</sup> M the T-type current decreased and was suppressed after 10\u201315 min (<a href=\"#bib9\">Bossu et al., 1985</a>); (2) at 10<sup>\u22127</sup> M, an hyperpolarizing shift (~10 mV) of the steady-state inactivation occurred (<a href=\"#bib10\">Bossu and Feltz, 1986</a>); and (3) at 10<sup>\u22126</sup> M no T-type current was recorded at HPs above \u2212100 mV (<a href=\"#bib24\">Dupont et al., 1986</a>). Altogether, these historical results and our present data are in favor of a \u2018minute scale\u2019 Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent modulation of the T-type current, which induces a hyperpolarizing shift in the steady-state inactivation and consequently a decrease in T-type current amplitude (see <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>)."

In 15 mM external Ca<sup>2+</sup>, the Cav1.2 current dropped to 40% of the control amplitude during 1 Hz stimulation and this inhibition was abolished in the presence of intracellular BAPTA (<a href=\"#bib50\">Oliveria et al., 2007</a>, <a href=\"#bib51\">2012</a>). The Cav1.2 current decrease was stable after 3\u20135 min, similar to that obtained with 40\u201350 s stimulation for Cav3.3 in the presence of the physiological 2 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration, and the recovery was almost total after 4\u20135 min. However, contrary to Cav3 currents, the decrease in the Cav1.2 current stimulated at 1 Hz did not involve a shift in its steady-state inactivation (<a href=\"#bib50\">Oliveria et al., 2007</a>, <a href=\"#bib51\">2012</a>), suggesting distinct mechanisms for the L-type and the T-type current modulation. In addition, a prolonged stimulation of Cav1.2 current (in 10 mM external Ca<sup>2+</sup> saline) induced channel endocytosis (<a href=\"#bib30\">Green et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Tsuruta et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Hall et al., 2013</a>) and, in this case, the recovery of the L-type current took approximately 30 min (<a href=\"#bib30\">Green et al., 2007</a>). This Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent modulation of L-type channels appears distinct of that described here for Cav3 channels, both regarding the time of the recovery and the shift in the steady-state inactivation. In addition, we found that ATP treatment in cells expressing both the P2X4 receptors and the Cav3.3 channels did not induce significant changes in membrane expression of Cav3.3, suggesting that the current decrease did not involve an endocytosis mechanism. Therefore, although the L- and the T-type channel regulation share apparent similar properties, modulation of the T-type current by cumulative Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry has unique features, depending mostly on the shift of the steady-state inactivation, i.e. the modulation of Cav3 availability."

The tsA-201 cells were cultured in 24-well plates and co-transfected with a Cav3.3-HA construct (<a href=\"#bib3\">Baumgart et al., 2008</a>) and either the P2X4 receptor or the pcDNA3 plasmid (ratio 1:1). Two days after transfection, ATP treatments were performed as in the electrophysiological experiments. The cells were washed with the electrophysiological extracellular solution containing 3 \u00b5M ivermectin and afterward 10 \u00b5M ATP was applied for 30\u201345 s at room temperature. Then the cells were directly fixed for 5 min in PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde. After three PBS washes, the cells were incubated for 30 min in blocking solution (PBS plus 1% fetal bovine serum). The Cav3.3-HA protein was detected using a rat anti-HA monoclonal antibody (1:1000 dilution; clone 3F10, Roche Diagnostics,\u00a0France) after incubation for 1 hr at room temperature. After four washes with PBS plus 1% fetal bovine serum for 10 min, cells were incubated for 30 min with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rat secondary antibody (1:1000 dilution; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). Cells were rinsed four times with PBS for 10 min before addition of SuperSignal enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay Femto maximum sensitivity substrate (Pierce, Fisher Scientific, France). Luminescence was measured using a VICTOR2 luminometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences,\u00a0Waltham, MA), and the protein amount in each well was then measured using the BCA assay (Pierce, Fisher Scientific, France) to normalize the measurements. All data were normalized to the level of signal obtained in P2X4 transfected cells without the ATP treatment. Each experiment was performed in quadruplicate and three independent sets of transfection experiments were performed under each condition. The results are presented as the mean \u00b1 SEM."

They show that calcium entry via the channel itself is able to induce this type of feedback inhibition, similar to what has been observed in Cav1.x and Cav2.x channels. The notion that intracellular calcium regulates T-type channels is not accepted or highlighted in the T-type literature. The T-type channels also lack the Ca<sup>2+</sup> and calmodulin binding motifs found in L-type channels. In that context, this work is important because it provides the clearest evidence to date of Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulation of distinct T-type channel isoforms in a manner that could potentially be physiologically important. The study also highlights the conserved nature of calcium regulation in voltage-gated calcium channels."

It is possible there is also a rightward shift in the voltage-dependence of the activation curve that contributes to the apparent inhibition seen. The authors should determine whether the activation curve is shifted under one of the conditions in which the steady-state inactivation is left-shifted."

This is fine for probing the phenomenon and the underlying biophysical mechanisms. Nevertheless, the authors speculate about the physiological implications of their results. The impact of the study would be enhanced if the phenomenon could be demonstrated (perhaps in Cav3.3 where the effect is most robust) with more physiological activation paradigms such as action potential waveforms. Alternatively, I think what would be more compelling is to show that under physiological conditions (i.e., in neurons), native calcium permeable receptors are able to modulate native T-type currents, and by extension, affect neuronal output."

Therefore, we have performed new experiments to address this point.

We found that the calcium-dependent inhibition is associated with a slight leftward shift (~3 mV) in the steady-state activation curve of Cav3.3 but not with a rightward shift (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E-F</a> and subsection \u201cCa<sup>2+</sup> entry during fast TP stimulation induces a negative shift in the steady-state inactivation\u201d, first paragraph). This leftward shift in the steady-state activation is not expected to induce Cav3.3 current inhibition. In addition, we have found no significant variation in the steady-state activation curve of Cav3.1, for which the steady-state inactivation curve is significantly shifted to the left (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and the last paragraph of the aforementioned subsection)."

It should be noted that at these low frequencies calcium does not induce Cav3.1 current inhibition (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a> in our present article) and accordingly no inhibitory effect of calcium was found in Monteil et al., 2000. In addition, the effect of barium or strontium at low frequency of stimulation mainly depends of the Cav3 isoform used and is expected to depend on difference in residues present in (or surrounding) the P-loop of the channels (for example see McRory et al., 2001 \u201cMolecular and functional characterization of a family of rat brain T-type calcium channels.\u201d). Importantly, we have not described in our present study the effect of barium ions (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a> in Monteil et al., 2000) but instead we have used intracellular BAPTA (as compared to EGTA) to probe calcium-dependent effect.

                    "text": "In the study of Lacinova et al., 2006 (cited in the sixth paragraph of the Discussion), the Cav3.1 current was compared between different extracellular and intracellular solution. The authors mainly compare 2 extreme conditions: \u201chigh intracellular calcium concentration\u201d which was 20 mM external calcium combined with 200 \u00b5M free internal calcium; and \u201c0 divalent cation\u201d which was 135 mM external sodium combined with 4 mM intracellular EGTA. Although this study presents interesting results it is very difficult to compare these results with our study (physiological external 2 mM calcium and an internal medium containing EGTA combined with calcium to match physiological concentration at rest ~100 nM) for the following reasons. First, as directly mentioned by the authors (p252), \u201cnon-specific voltage shifts due to altered surface charge took place\u201d when comparing both conditions and therefore a shift in the steady-state inactivation (or activation) could not be quantitatively compared (as discussed p254 and p 256). Therefore, the rightward shift in the inactivation curve observed with the \u201chigh intracellular calcium concentration\u201d was completely expected by a screen charge effect (20 mM external calcium versus 0 external divalent). Second, the dialysis of the cell for several minutes in 4 mM EGTA/0 Ca or in 200 \u00b5M Ca/ 0 EGTA may lead to major change in the cell metabolism, as the prolonged activation/inhibition of several calcium-dependent enzymes (that possibly may lead to Cav3 channel modulation), which was not the case in our study mainly comparing the effect of internal EGTA and BAPTA. However, we do not think that this study reported opposite results as compared to our study. Again, it is important to note that experiments in Lacinova et al., were performed at the frequency of stimulation of 0.2 Hz (p252), a frequency for which we found no calcium-dependent inhibition for Cav3.1 current (and therefore no shift in the steady-state inactivation, as observed in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a> in Lacinova et al.). In addition, using \u201cintermediate\u201d solutions (that limit altered surface charge change), the authors showed that the Cav3.1 current is increased in the presence of intracellular EGTA as compared to 200 \u00b5M intracellular calcium (both in 20 mM external calcium). The same results were observed when comparing the 135 mM external sodium and the 2 mM external calcium (both with EGTA in the intracellular calcium). This suggests that an increase in intracellular calcium promotes the current inhibition (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a> in Lacinova et al.). Also, in the presence of 20 mM external calcium, the inactivation kinetics (and \u2013 to a lesser extent \u2013 the activation kinetics) of the Cav3.1 current were faster in the presence of internal calcium as compared to internal EGTA (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D and E</a> in Lacinova et al.). Overall, although it is very difficult to directly compare our results with those of Lacinova et al. (especially concerning the inactivation curves), we do believe that our study provides data that are not opposite or incompatible with those of Lacinova et al. (2006)."

It is important to note that the used of external 100 mM divalent concentration induces a strong positive shift in V0.5 values due to altered surface charge (as compared to physiological 2 mM calcium, see point 3). Indeed, in the inside-out configuration, we found that at a holding potential (HP) of -50 mV, only the half of channels are inactivated (~47% ). Therefore, as the calcium effect observed in the whole-cell configuration is more robust at depolarized HPs (-70 / -80 mV), we used HP -50 mV in the inside-out configuration to match whole-cell experiments and possibly maximize the putative direct effect of calcium. Before patch excision, the cells were perfused with a solution containing 1 mM EGTA / 0 Ca and the inside-out patch configuration was performed (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Afterward, the effect on the Cav3.3 current of calcium containing solutions (1, 10 and 100 \u00b5M) were tested and compared to the 1 mM EGTA / 0 Ca solution (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>).

Higher concentration of calcium (mM) could not be investigated because we observed a strong tendency of the patches to form vesicles, which were very resistant to air and most of the time irreversible."
