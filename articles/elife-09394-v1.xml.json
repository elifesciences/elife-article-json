Using a scleroderma mouse, we show that transplantation of MHC compatible, minor antigen mismatched bone marrow stromal/stem cells (BMSCs) play a role in the pathogenesis of fibrosis. Removal of donor BMSCs rescued mice from disease. Freshly isolated PDGFR\u03b1<sup>+</sup> Sca-1<sup>+</sup> BMSCs expressed MHC class II following transplantation and activated host T cells. A decrease in FOXP3<sup>+</sup> CD25<sup>+</sup> Treg population was observed. T cells proliferated and secreted IL-6 when stimulated with mismatched BMSCs in vitro. Donor T cells were not involved in fibrosis because transplanting T cell-deficient RAG2 knock out mice bone marrow still caused disease. Once initially triggered by mismatched BMSCs, the autoimmune phenotype was not donor BMSC dependent as the phenotype was observed after effector T cells were adoptively transferred into na\u00efve syngeneic mice. Our data suggest that minor antigen mismatched BMSCs trigger systemic fibrosis in this autoimmune scleroderma model."

Using a scleroderma mouse, we show that transplantation of MHC compatible, minor antigen mismatched bone marrow stromal/stem cells (BMSCs) play a role in the pathogenesis of fibrosis. Removal of donor BMSCs rescued mice from disease. Freshly isolated PDGFR\u03b1<sup>+</sup> Sca-1<sup>+</sup> BMSCs expressed MHC class II following transplantation and activated host T cells. A decrease in FOXP3<sup>+</sup> CD25<sup>+</sup> Treg population was observed. T cells proliferated and secreted IL-6 when stimulated with mismatched BMSCs in vitro. Donor T cells were not involved in fibrosis because transplanting T cell-deficient RAG2 knock out mice bone marrow still caused disease. Once initially triggered by mismatched BMSCs, the autoimmune phenotype was not donor BMSC dependent as the phenotype was observed after effector T cells were adoptively transferred into na\u00efve syngeneic mice. Our data suggest that minor antigen mismatched BMSCs trigger systemic fibrosis in this autoimmune scleroderma model."

This model of SSc occurs spontaneously without the use of artificial agents such as bleomycin (<a href=\"#bib49\">Yamamoto and Nishioka, 2004</a>),\u00a0and exhibits characteristics of human SSc including fibrosis, inflammation, and autoimmunity. Animal models are effective in screening for therapeutic interventions such as anti IL-6 (<a href=\"#bib25\">Le Huu et al., 2012</a>)\u00a0and angiotensin II type-1 receptor antagonists (<a href=\"#bib48\">Yaguchi et al., 2013</a>).

Multipotent BMSCs in the bone marrow differentiate into several mesenchymal lineages including fibroblasts, adipocytes, osteocytes, and chondrocytes (<a href=\"#bib38\">Pittenger et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Prockop, 1997</a>). However, due to the lack of specific markers, a crucial step involving in\u00a0vitro expansion was required to isolate BMSCs, which may modify their phenotype and function (<a href=\"#bib4\">Banfi et al., 2000</a>). Most current information on BMSCs comes from such in\u00a0vitro studies of adherent cells referred to as fibroblast CFUs (CFU-Fs) (<a href=\"#bib12\">Conget and Minguell, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Friedenstein et al., 1974</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Pittenger et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Prockop, 1997</a>),\u00a0which are a heterogeneous population of cells at best. Therefore, the in\u00a0vivo dynamics of BMSCs after whole bone marrow transplantation\u00a0(WBMT) are still unknown, and the establishment of a solid experimental system to trace the fate of BMSCs following transplantation was required."

Our model allows for the first time both whole bone marrow transplantation, as well as the selective transplantation of freshly isolated BMSCs and/or HSCs into recipient mice. By applying this modified SSc model using prospectively isolated BMSCs and HSCs, we sought to identify the role of donor HSCs and BMSCs in the pathogenesis of the autoimmune-related fibrosis in SSc. Here, we show how mismatched donor BMSCs not only contribute to fibrosis in various organs, but also trigger the onset of autoimmune disease by activating host T cells."

The recipients of mismatched HSCs combined with syngeneic BMSCs were indistinguishable from syngeneic HSC and syngeneic BMSC recipients. Physicological connective tissues are also stained in blue in the lacrimal gland, salivary gland, and intestine when BALB/c mice received mismatched HSCs and syngeneic BMSCs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1Bi,iii</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3Ai,iii</a>). Since heat-shock protein 47 (HSP47), a molecular chaperon specific to collagen-secreting cells, has been reported as a useful marker for fibroblasts in paraffin-embedded tissue sections (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kuroda and Tajima, 2004</a>),\u00a0we determined the state of fibrosis by (1)\u00a0semi-quantitative analysis to count the number of HSP47+ fibroblasts per field and (2) Mallory staining, a specific marker of connective tissue\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3A,B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib8\">Brack et al., 2007</a>). Fibrotic lesions in mismatched BMSC recipients had significantly higher HSP47<sup>+</sup> fibroblasts (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Lacrimal gland function was also reduced only in mismatched BMSC recipients (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). In addition, all these observations were canceled in recipients of BMSC-depleted WBM transplantation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1Bv,Cv,Dv</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3Av,Bv</a>). Minimal Mallory staining areas are physiological changes and necessary to support the structure of ducts and intestinal walls (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). The severity of fibrosis triggered by mismatched BMSCs was dose dependent on the number of transplanted BMSCs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E,F</a>).

On the other hand, a notable number of cells derived from mismatched donor EGF<sup>+</sup>SP-HSCs also migrated to fibrotic lesions, but none of the GFP<sup>+</sup> cells expressed HSP47 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). The lineage exclusivity of this transplantation excludes the possibility that HSP47<sup>+</sup> fibroblasts were derived from SP-HSCs as shown in our previous report (<a href=\"#bib23\">Koide et al., 2007</a>). The accumulation of donor-derived fibroblasts was not observed in syngeneic transplantation, where fibrosis does not occur (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>).

The next question was whether these pathogenic T cells were donor-derived T cells, or residual host T cells that lost self-tolerance. Both host-derived T cells and donor HSC-derived T cells are believed to exist in this mouse model, because mature T cells often escape radiation damage and remain in the peripheral blood of recipients (<a href=\"#bib2\">Anderson et al., 2004</a>). Interestingly, almost all spleen cells were donor-derived in matched WBMT, whereas the remaining host-derived cells after mismatched WBMT were higher in mismatched WBMT (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>)."

Our data show that depletion of BMSCs from donor whole bone marrow significantly reduced fibrosis in all organs examined, and rescued mice from lacrimal gland dysfunction associated with the disease. These findings suggest the possible role of donor BMSCs in the initiation of the autoimmune process, as the number of BMSCs in graft correlated with severity of fibrosis (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E,F</a>). Furthermore, the onset of true autoimmune disease in these mice was shown by the repression of Treg induction, followed by an increase in Th17 effector cells of host origin. This shows that migrating donor P\u03b1S-BMSCs are the initial trigger of events leading to increased levels of circulating IL-6, followed by a decrease in Tregs, and conversely an increase in host-derived Th17 cells. Activation or maturation of BMSC-derived progeny is probably also involved in the progression of disease because\u00a0accumulation of donor-derived fibroblasts was not observed in syngeneic BMSC transplantation, where fibrosis does not occur. In the mixed lymphocyte reaction experiments, Thy-1<sup>+</sup> T-cells isolated from host mice after mismatched BMT were activated by P\u03b1S-BMSCs in\u00a0vitro, as shown by enhanced proliferation and IL-6 secretion. In addition, the T-cell proliferation was blocked by anti-MHC antibody. Finally, adoptively transferred T cells from mismatched BMSCs recipients into nude-mice-induced autoimmune-like inflammation and fibrosis in targets organs, indicating that autoreactive recipient T cells were activated by antigens presented by MHC class II molecules in minor antigen mismatched donor BMSCs. Adoptive transferred T cells react recipient BMSCs leading to recipient\u2019 fibrosis (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>) probably because adoptively transferred T cells has already acquired the autoreactive nature to activate the recipient derived BMSCs as shown in vitro analysis from <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a> and <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>."

Since naive T\u00a0cells responded to P\u03b1S-BMSCs in\u00a0vitro at low levels, we speculate that auto-reactive T cells that are only present in basal levels under normal conditions (<a href=\"#bib40\">Sakaguchi et al., 2008</a>)\u00a0can recognize minor differences between B10.D2 and BALB/c BMSCs. The lack of fibrosis following mismatched HSC transplantation suggests that hematopoietic lineage cells, including DCs, did not express such a molecule. The identical phenotype was observed when host and recipient were reversed (i.e. BALB/c BMSCs transplanted to B10.D2 recipients, data not shown). This implies that both B10.D2 and BALB/c BMSCs can be a primary inducer against mismatched recipient T cells, showing that the\u00a0autoimmune-related fibrosis in this model was due to difference in strain, and not a specific reaction of B10.D2 BMSCs and BALB/c T cells."

Previous studies have used culture-isolated BMSCs, which do not reflect the physiological role of these cells in\u00a0vivo. Functional differences between in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo observations may explain discrepancies in the anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory effects of BMSCs reported in the literature (See review by Bernardo et. al. (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bernardo and Fibbe, 2013</a>). Our study has also demonstrated that donor BMSCs can contribute to the fibroblast population observed in fibrotic lesions of the host. Our findings suggest that once mismatched BMSCs migrate into the target organs via certain homing signals, mismatched BMSCs encounter T cells and proliferate and activate under the pathological microenvironment (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). This phenomenon may not be present in syngeneic BMSCs transplantation where an allogeneic response does not occur. As for HSP47 expression, it is clearly seen in activated fibroblasts, but only very faint expression is detected in quiescent fibroblasts in the syngeneic BMSC-transplanted recipients\u2019 target organs. Interestingly, a fraction of BMSCs mobilized in the peripheral blood expressed MHC class II molecules (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Preliminary data show that these cells also express CD45 and type I collagen (data not shown), which corresponds with the phenotype of fibrocytes reported in the literature (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abe et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Chesney et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Mielcarek et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Phillips et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Wang et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Yang et al., 2002</a>).

The phenotype of cGVHD characterized by systemic fibrosis and severe dry eye is very similar to this SSc mouse phenotype. Unlike conventional cGVHD that is believed to be caused by donor T cells, our results show that radio-resistant residual recipient T cells, but not donor-HSC derived de novo T cells, were activated following mismatched BMSC transplantation. Although we do not believe that our findings in this mouse model could be directly applied to human cGVHD cases, it is worth noting this phenomenon. In fact, several previous reports have shown that residual recipient CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells regulate cGVHD(<a href=\"#bib2\">Anderson et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Blazar et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Jaffee and Claman, 1983</a>).

We have found that BMSCs are rarely detected in cord blood but are abundant in G-CSF-mobilized PBL (<a href=\"#bib27\">Mabuchi et al., 2013</a>),\u00a0which may indicate that the onset of cGVHD may correlate with the number of BMSCs transplanted. Taken all, the reduced risk of cGVHD may have been due to the removal or absence of donor BMSCs as we showed in our BMSC-depleted model. Further studies are required for monitoring the frequency of donor BMSCs in grafts and residual host T cells in human cGVHD patients to elucidate the possible role of donor BMSCs in the pathogenesis."

Tear secretion was evaluated as described (<a href=\"#bib26\">Ma et al., 1999</a>;<a href=\"#bib17\">Inaba et al., 2014</a>). Animals were stimulated 3 min after anesthesia by intra-peritoneal injection of 0.02% pilocarpine solution (1 mg/kg; Santen Pharmaceutical Co., LTD), and tears were collected from the conjunctival sac of the lateral canthus for 15 min using 0.5-\u03bcl diameter capillary microglass tubes (Microcaps, Drummond Scientific Company, Broomall, PA). The total tear volume was determined as the average of three separate measurements of 5 min each."

The authors report that mismatched MSCs are a key inducer of fibrosis after BMT and that host T cells, but not donor T cells, are required for the progression of this fibrosis, presumably as a result in a break in tolerance and the initiation of an autoimmune state. This study is potentially important for changing existing views of the pathogenesis of cGVHD. However, there are some doubts about the results, which have to be answered before publication."

There is related to the question of how \"pure\" the P\u03b1S cells are. It is not at all clear that P\u03b1S \"MSCs\" are as uniform a population of cells as the authors think. While they do have features of the best-characterized \"MSC\", bone marrow skeletal stem cells, they have other properties that may be due to the inclusion of other cell types using their minimal cell surface phenotype. As reported in Morikawa et al, 2009a, endothelial cells are Sca-1<sup>+</sup> (and it has been reported that endothelial progenitors express PDGFR\u03b1). Collagenase was used to digest the marrow prior to sorting, thereby liberating more cells that the usual mechanically dissociation. This suggests that endothelial and or progenitor cells are likely to be within the P\u03b1S fraction and indeed, the statements about MHC class II+ fibrocytes suggest that even hematopoietic cells may contaminate the injected population. Further, it is stated that \"P\u03b1S-MSCs\" were found in peripheral blood, but to date there is rigorous evidence that bona fide BMSCs are able to circulate on a routine basis. This calls into question the efficacy of the markers used (PDGFR\u03b1 and Sca-1) to identify only BMSCs. The authors need to show a better characterization of the P\u03b1S cells (CD45<sup>-</sup>/Ter119<sup>-</sup>/PDGFR\u03b1<sup>+</sup>/Sca-1<sup>+</sup> cells), specifically, to show that they have other markers of bone marrow stromal cells (e.g., CD29, CD, 90, CD106) and devoid of endothelial cells (CD31), endothelial progenitors (CD133), or hematopoietic cells, especially of myeloid nature. This is key for the authors to claim that the fibrosis is induced by mismatched bone marrow stromal cells."
