Despite their critical location in our visual system and evidence that they are dynamically gated for dark/light adaptation, the full impact that rod\u2013cone GJs can have on cone function is not known. We recorded the photovoltage of mouse cones and found that the initial level of rod input increased spontaneously after obtaining intracellular access. This process allowed us to explore the underlying coupling capacity to rods, revealing that fully coupled cones acquire a striking rod-like phenotype. Calcium, a candidate mediator of the coupling process, does not appear to be involved on the cone side of the junctional channels. Our findings show that the anatomical substrate is adequate for rod\u2013cone coupling to play an important role in vision and, possibly, in biochemical signaling among photoreceptors."

However, rod signals can bypass rod bipolar cells and enter directly into the cone pathway (<a href=\"#bib12\">DeVries and Baylor, 1995</a>). The earliest opportunity for this crossover is represented by rod\u2013cone gap junctions (GJs) (<a href=\"#bib38\">Raviola and Gilula, 1973</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Tsukamoto et al., 2001</a>). GJs are assemblies of channels made by the docking of pairs of connexon hemichannels on adjacent cells, each formed by six connexin subunits. Cones contact nearby photoreceptors mainly at the tips of thin <i>telodendria</i>, which emerge from their synaptic pedicles, where they express connexin isoform 36 (Cx36) (<a href=\"#bib24\">Lee et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">O\u2019Brien et al., 2012</a>), while the isoform expressed by rods has not been conclusively identified (<a href=\"#bib24\">Lee et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Feigenspan et al., 2004</a>). The rod\u2013cone junctional plaques are very small, each containing few connexon channels (<a href=\"#bib38\">Raviola and Gilula, 1973</a>), and although rod signals were recorded in cat (<a href=\"#bib30\">Nelson, 1977</a>) and in macaque cones (<a href=\"#bib44\">Schneeweis and Schnapf, 1995</a>, <a href=\"#bib45\">1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Hornstein et al., 2005</a>), the extent to which rod\u2013cone coupling contributes to mammalian vision remains unclear. On the one hand, psychophysical and electroretinographic (ERG) experiments, in humans, detected putative correlates of rod\u2013cone coupling (reviewed by <a href=\"#bib47\">Sharpe and Stockman, 1999</a>), and ganglion cell and ERG recordings, in mice lacking Cx36, supported the view that rod\u2013cone coupling is relevant for dim light vision (<a href=\"#bib9\">Deans et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Volgyi et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Abd-El-Barr et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Seeliger et al., 2011</a>); on the other hand, alternative mechanisms could explain the human data (<a href=\"#bib47\">Sharpe and Stockman, 1999</a>), and recordings in cone bipolar cells in Cx36 knockout mice suggested that rod\u2013cone coupling plays a marginal role in rod signal flow (<a href=\"#bib35\">Pang et al., 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib36\">2012</a>)."

However, cut-loading cannot discriminate between rod\u2013rod, rod\u2013cone and cone\u2013cone GJs, and it does not provide information on the absolute strength of coupling, but only on its relative changes. Therefore, the possibility that the impact of coupling on vision is strongly context-dependent raises three pressing questions: (<i>i</i>) what is the maximum level of rod\u2013cone coupling? (<i>ii</i>) how strongly are cones influenced by rod input under these conditions? (<i>iii</i>) what is the level of coupling under different physiological states? Here we investigated the first two of these questions in mouse, a mainstay of current retina research and one in which direct proof of rod input in cones is still lacking. This important gap in our knowledge is explained by the fact that mouse cones were only recently shown to be accessible for patch clamp recordings (<a href=\"#bib6\">Cangiano et al., 2012</a>)."

As expected, the first dim G flash evoked a large response, the bright<sub>a</sub> G flash evoked a saturating response consisting of a fast peak and plateau (for an analysis of the currents involved, see <a href=\"#bib11\">Della Santina et al., 2012</a>), and dim G flash sensitivity recovered slowly after the saturating flash. Rod responses run down in kinetics during patch recordings (<a href=\"#bib6\">Cangiano et al., 2012</a>), a process that also alters their time course of recovery from saturating flashes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A1</a>, cf. black and gray records). Thus, the kinetics protocol was also delivered in a number of rods recorded in loose seal mode, as with this technique, light response kinetics can be stable for several hours (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A2</a>). The time course of the response to the kinetics protocol of rods in the initial minutes of patch recordings (n = 19, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A1</a>, black records, taken before a significant amount of rundown occurred) was similar to that in loose seal recordings (n = 17), as shown in a graph of the normalized dim flash response amplitudes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). In cones, the kinetics protocol evoked a spectrum of response types depending on the cone and on the time from seal (see below). Some cones responded only to the bright<sub>a</sub> G flash (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, top), the expected behavior for uncoupled cones (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). However, the large majority of cones displayed, similar to rods, responses to the first dim G flash, a plateau after the bright<sub>a</sub> G flash, and a slow recovery of the dim flash response (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, middle/bottom). This similarity in the time course of recovery after the bright flash emerges from comparing graphs of normalized dim flash response amplitudes during the kinetics protocol in rods (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>) and cones (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>, n = 11). This is strong evidence for the presence of rod input in cones."

The net change in their response to the kinetics protocol was a scaled version of the typical rod response (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). The rapid time course of this process implied that it began with the recording itself. It did not depend on the repeated exposure of the photoreceptor to light, since it occurred also when single deliveries of the kinetics protocol were separated by several minutes of uninterrupted darkness (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). A response amplitude vs flash strength graph, obtained in two time ranges in the same cone (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>), highlights how cones acquired light sensitivity at intensities normally covered by rods. Note that collecting each full flash response curve of <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a> required \u223c10 min, a time comparable to the time course of the spontaneous increase; therefore, different flash strengths were unavoidably delivered at different levels of progress of the phenomenon. <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> shows, in simplified form, the evolution of dim G flash response amplitude in 50 cones. Its rate of increase varied greatly among cones. When possible we estimated the dim G flash response amplitude prior to patching, by extrapolating to time zero the values observed in the first minutes of recording (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, short red horizontal bars). Based on these estimates, it appears that most cones responded to dim G flashes already before patching, although response amplitudes were generally modest when compared to those expressed during the recordings. If the dim flash sensitivity of cones is due to rod input, then these observations imply that rod\u2013cone junctional conductance is not hardwired, but it is modifiable in a wide range."

We delivered the spectral protocol in rods and cones and quantified spectral preference by the ratio of the peak response amplitudes to G over UV light (for the same flash strength in photons\u00b7\u00b5m<sup>\u22122</sup>). As expected, rods were more sensitive to dim G than to dim UV flashes (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A1,A2</a>, arrows; same rod), with an estimated dim G/UV ratio of 2.7 (SEM 0.2; n = 8) (all rhodopsins have a prominent secondary absorption peak in the ultraviolet [<a href=\"#bib41\">Rodieck, 1973</a>], including mouse rhodopsin [<a href=\"#bib28\">Lyubarsky et al., 1999</a>]).

This behavior was independent of their intrinsic spectral preference in a wide range of G/UV ratios (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>) (corresponding to a wide range of M- vs S-opsin expression levels), again supporting our hypothesis that dim flash responses in cones are driven by rods."

The reason is that the cone membrane potential at the pipette tip (V<sub>Cone</sub>) would differ from the membrane potential of its coupled rods (V<sub>Rod</sub>) when a current flows through the finite resistance of the GJs (i<sub>GJ</sub>), a condition occurring when the cone is held depolarized via the pipette (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>, equivalent circuit).

(<b>B</b>) A reduced version of the spectral protocol (sequences 1\u20132 in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>) was delivered with a cone recorded in current clamp in control conditions (V<sub>Cone(DARK)</sub> = \u221240 mV) or during depolarization by constant current injection beyond the reversal potential of its light-sensitive conductance (V<sub>Cone(DARK)</sub> = +66 mV). While bright<sub>b</sub> flash responses reversed polarity, dim flash responses became smaller but did not reverse.

This matches a different predicted outcome for coupled cones (panel <b>A</b>, V<sub>Rod(DARK)</sub> = E<sub>OS</sub>). The slight shift toward G in the spectral preference displayed by this cone (second bright<sub>b</sub> flash) is likely explained by a slow \u2018bump\u2019 in the plateau displayed after bright<sub>b</sub> flashes, present only at \u221240 mV (not shown, but observed in sequence three of the spectral protocol).

We chose instead a more limited approach of delivering the spectral protocol in cones sensitive to dim flashes, while they are depolarized well beyond the reversal potential of their photoresponse. This was done both in current clamp (CC) and voltage clamp (VC). In CC, we imposed V<sub>Cone(DARK)</sub> &gt; E<sub>OS</sub> by constant current injection. In all five cones tested, we observed that the bright<sub>b</sub> flash responses reversed in polarity (i.e., depolarizing) and actually became larger than in control conditions. In contrast, four of these cones had their dim flash responses reduced in amplitude to the point of being no longer distinguishable from noise, while the remaining one retained a small hyperpolarizing response (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>). This result suggests that in these conditions, V<sub>Rod(DARK)</sub> was slightly below or anyway near E<sub>OS</sub> (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>, middle and bottom rows). In VC, the photocurrent responses of a cone to the spectral protocol were recorded at holding potentials (V<sub>Cone(HOLD)</sub>) of \u221240 mV and +60 mV. At the depolarized potential, bright flash photoresponses were reversed and of much larger amplitude, while the dim flash responses became undetectable (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>). This suggests that also in this case (VC recording) V<sub>Rod(DARK)</sub> was close to E<sub>OS</sub> (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>, middle row). Again, it is possible that the absence of dim flash responses was partly due to a voltage-dependent reduction of the junctional conductance."

In three control rod recordings, 100 \u00b5M MFA was superfused with essentially no effect, except for a marginal reduction in light sensitivity that we attribute to the normal rundown observed during long rod recordings. In four cones tested, on the other hand, superfusion with 100 \u00b5M MFA markedly reduced both dim flash responses and the slow plateau after bright flashes. An example is shown in <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A1</a>, where a prominent level of coupling was reached about 30 min from seal formation, after which MFA was delivered. The slow pharmacodynamics of the blocker observed in our recordings (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A1</a>, lower plot) confirmed a previous report in AII amacrine cells (<a href=\"#bib53\">Veruki and Hartveit, 2009</a>). The significant rundown of the cone response kinetics, particularly evident toward the end of the experiment, was first described in <a href=\"#bib6\">Cangiano et al. (2012)</a> and is unrelated to the effect of the blocker, since fast cone responses were observed when the seal was made with MFA already present in the bath (n = 2). Comparing graphs of response amplitude vs flash strength before and during perfusion with MFA in the same cone highlights how junctional coupling transforms the sensitivity profile of the cone making it responsive to dim flashes, thereby widening its dynamic range (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A2</a>). Although control data for this graph were obtained before the cone reached its full coupling potential, a remarkable effect of the blocker on dim flash sensitivity was already visible."

Nevertheless, the rod was still unable to respond to the dim G flash delivered at the earliest delay following the bright<sub>a</sub> G flash. In all five cones recorded near body temperature, we observed dim G flash responses (0.28, 0.32, 0.43, 1.47, and 1.70 mV) and plateaus after bright<sub>a</sub> G flashes (the response of 1.70 mV is shown in <a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10B</a>). In one of these cones, we tested the effect of the GJ blocker MFA (100 \u00b5M): both dim flash responses and plateaus following the bright<sub>a</sub> flash were abolished, leaving behind a fast response to the bright<sub>a</sub> flash (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10B</a>). The flash response profile of this cone, acquired during superfusion with MFA (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10B</a>), revealed that it was significantly more sensitive to G light than the dorsalmost (i.e., the \u2018greenest\u2019) simulated cones in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>.

To shed light on the nature of this interaction, we examined whether the mechanism underlying the coupling process in photoreceptors is related to phenomenologically similar ones found in other systems expressing Cx36 (<a href=\"#bib59\">Zoidl et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Del Corsso et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Veruki et al., 2008</a>). Two possible drivers of the spontaneous coupling increase emerging from these studies were (<i>i</i>) dialysis of the cell by the pipette, and (<i>ii</i>) an increase in intracellular calcium, both occurring as a consequence of <i>whole cell</i> recordings (\u2018Discussion\u2019). However, the fact that we observed this phenomenon in perforated patch clamp recordings, a technique known to cause minimal disturbance to the intracellular environment, makes it unlikely that in mouse cones, it is caused by pipette-cell dialysis (we could exclude an unintended rupture of the patch membrane, since the amphotericin-B present in our pipette solution would have perforated the cell membrane, depolarizing it close to 0 mV and shunting the photovoltages\u2014effects that we indeed observed when going whole cell at the end of recordings to stain the neurons with Lucifer Yellow, LY). Nonetheless, we examined the remote possibility that amphotericin-B (nominally 400 \u00b5M) formed Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable pores (<a href=\"#bib42\">Romero et al., 2009</a>) and that the diffusion of calcium ions from the pipette into the cone led to an opening of GJs (Ca<sup>2+</sup> traces are normally present in the high purity water used for intracellular solutions). In four of five cones recorded with 1 mM EGTA in the pipette (<i>EGTA zero Ca</i><sup><i>2+</i></sup> <i>perforated patch</i> solution), we observed the same progressive increase in coupling (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, blue lines)."

We thus performed whole cell recordings (i.e., without amphotericin-B) with the goal of dialyzing cones with a low Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffered solution. Seals were made on cone pedicles (as confirmed by LY staining, <a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11E</a>) to ensure a rapid and effective \u2018Ca<sup>2+</sup> clamp\u2019 on the cone side of the junctional contacts (located on short telodendria that protrude from the pedicles; <a href=\"#bib52\">Tsukamoto et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">O\u2019Brien et al., 2012</a>). This represented an important step, given what is known about the active compartmentalization of free [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> in cones (<a href=\"#bib57\">Wei et al., 2012</a>). We recorded from three cones with an <i>EGTA low Ca</i><sup><i>2+</i></sup> <i>whole cell</i> solution (50 nM free [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>; see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019), of which only one had weak coupling to rods upon breaking the patch. In two of the three cones, rod coupling increased rapidly in the first minutes of recording (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11A</a>), while in the third cone, coupling did not develop despite a stable recording for more than 1 hr (not shown). Further, we recorded from three cones with a <i>BAPTA low Ca</i><sup><i>2+</i></sup> <i>whole cell</i> solution (50 nM free [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>) to rule out an involvement of fast and localized calcium transients. While all three cones were initially uncoupled, they rapidly increased their coupling to rods up to moderate levels (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11B</a>). Since in all these experiments free calcium in the pedicle was buffered at very low levels compared to those normally present in darkness (\u223c2 \u00b5M spatially averaged: <a href=\"#bib51\">Szikra and Krizaj, 2006</a>), we conclude that high calcium (on the side of the cone) is not required for the expression of the progressive increase in coupling. High calcium, however, could favor coupling. To test this, we recorded from six cones with an <i>EGTA high Ca</i><sup><i>2+</i></sup> <i>whole cell</i> solution (approx. 5 \u00b5M free [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>), all uncoupled or weakly coupled upon breaking the patch. Among five cones that we could monitor for sufficient time, one developed strong coupling over several minutes (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11C</a>), while the remaining four displayed weak coupling, which, however, did not appear to increase over time. Thus, no obvious favoring effect on coupling of high calcium emerged from this group of cones."

Moreover, any pure M-cones would respond to UV light since M-opsin has a prominent secondary absorption peak in the near UV region (the \u03b2-band; <a href=\"#bib15\">Govardovskii et al., 2000</a>). It was thus not surprising that almost all of our recorded cones were intrinsically sensitive to both G and UV light (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a> and <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>, cf. with <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>). Our dissection and recording techniques did not allow us to identify their dorsoventral position in the retina, so that we could not directly examine possible correlations between their location and the level of maximal coupling. We could however conclude that both S-dominant cones (known to be mid and ventrally located) and M-dominant cones (dorsally located) are able to couple strongly to rods (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). As for pure S-cones, our small recorded sample is in no way sufficient to conclude that they have a reduced propensity to couple to rods, since we found uncoupled cones also within the S/M group. Interestingly, there is some evidence in macaque that blue cones form fewer junctional contacts with rods compared to other cone types (<a href=\"#bib33\">O\u2019Brien et al., 2012</a>)."

First, while we recorded from both central and peripheral retina, it is unlikely that we obtained a uniform sampling at all eccentricities; this, combined with the dorsoventral gradients in S- and M-opsin expression (see references above), will distort the observed distribution. Second, any differences in size or accessibility among cones would have affected their odds of being recorded (see <a href=\"#bib6\">Cangiano et al. (2012)</a> for rod vs cone recording bias). Third, compared to the classical approach of estimating cone spectral preference by adjusting the strengths of flashes of different wavelengths to match their response amplitudes, our use of the ratio of the peak response amplitude to moderately bright G and UV flashes of equal strength (our G/UV ratios) shifts values somewhat toward unity as cone saturation is approached (we chose this approach because it was quick and avoided exposing rods to very bright light). Fourth, there could be a contribution of other cones coupled to the recorded cone, which would shift the measured G/UV ratio in one or the other direction depending on their relative expression of S- and M-opsins. Finally, we cannot exclude that in some experiments, coupled rods may have retained a small response to the bright flash following the saturating pre-flash, again shifting the G/UV ratio. These last two factors could explain the shifts in G/UV ratio observed in some cones during spontaneous coupling increase and superfusion with MFA (<a href=\"#fig9s2\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), as well as in the \u2018reversal\u2019 experiment of <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>."

We confirmed this in mouse, observing however a much less dramatic effect: in patched cones, the time to peak (TTP) of dim flash responses was 197 ms (SD 35, n = 24), significantly shorter (p&lt;0.0001) than the 258 ms (SD 25, n = 23) of rods recorded in loose seal (rod and cone data were from both the kinetics protocol and the spectral protocol at 24\u00b0C) (note that the TTP of dim flash responses in patched rods was 288 ms (SD 51, n = 24), moderately but significantly longer (p=0.02) than that of rods recorded in loose seal; since rods recorded in loose seal did not display a kinetics rundown, their TTP values were assumed to be representative of the unperturbed state of rods in our preparation). The considerable discrepancy between the magnitude of the speedup in macaque and mouse could be explained if macaque rods underwent a rundown of kinetics during recordings (as it occurs in mouse), without this being noticed."

First, in cones, this phenomenon is not dependent on diffusion of Ca<sup>2+</sup> between the cell and the pipette, as the spontaneous increase in coupling was expressed in perforated patch recordings, even in combination with EGTA in the pipette solution. This, therefore, excludes the possibility of a Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry through hypothetical Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable pores formed by amphotericin-B in the patch membrane (<a href=\"#bib42\">Romero et al., 2009</a>; see also \u2018Results\u2019). Second, our recordings in whole cell patch clamp with buffered pipette Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels, made in close proximity to the GJs, strongly suggest that changes in free [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> in cones are not responsible for the expression of this phenomenon. Moreover, since the progressive increase in coupling was observed both when preserving the intracellular environment of the cone (perforated patch recordings) and when intentionally dialyzing it (whole cell recordings), a general tentative conclusion may be advanced: diffusible messenger molecules in cones are not necessarily involved in the process. Thus, any diffusible messengers (including Ca<sup>2+</sup>) could be located in the rods surrounding the recorded cone and act on the connexon hemichannels on the rod side."

This observation implies that their cones also expressed a progressive increase in coupling, a process whose electrophysiological counterpart must have gone unnoticed. In this scenario, and taking into account the arguments given above, coupling would be promoted by stretch/deformation of the rods adjacent to the recorded cone. This could explain the large variability in the rate of increase and maximum level of coupling that we observed in our recordings (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>), since the angle of entry and depth of the pipette in the tissue varies from experiment to experiment, likely changing its mechanical interaction with neighboring rods."

A key question that needs to be addressed is when the retina exploits the strong coupling potential detected in this study. Candidate regulators of rod\u2013cone GJs in mammals are (references in the \u2018Introduction\u2019): (<i>i</i>) the circadian synthesis and release of the endogenous retinal neuromodulators, melatonin, dopamine, and adenosine, whereby coupling would be stronger at night when melatonin levels are high; most mouse strains, including the C57BL/6 used here, have deficits in melatonin synthesis (<a href=\"#bib43\">Roseboom et al., 1998</a>) and are thus inadequate to investigate circadian processes; it is therefore possible that the low level of coupling that we estimated for our unperturbed cones may be related to this deficit and that full blown coupling, of the strength emerging during our recordings, is recruited in melatonin-competent mouse strains at night; (<i>ii</i>) acute light exposure, acting on the same neuromodulators and possibly also locally in the photoreceptors, which would inhibit coupling."

Similar discrepancies (<a href=\"#bib16\">Hartveit and Veruki, 2012</a>) exist for the GJs between AII amacrines, also containing Cx36 and thought of being modulated in a circadian and light-dependent fashion. While a common explanation for these conflicting pieces of evidence may eventually be found, our demonstration that rod\u2013cone coupling can be upregulated so as to have a major impact on cones provides an important framework in which to place circadian/light-dependent modulation of these GJs in mouse. In fact, (<i>i</i>) let\u2019s suppose that the level attained in our experiments by the fully developed coupling process had been quite smaller than what we actually observed; then this would have raised serious doubts about the physiological importance of circadian/light-dependent modulation of rod\u2013cone coupling for mouse visual processing; (<i>ii</i>) given however our demonstrated high level of coupling, should a future direct examination of the role of circadian rhythmicity find that only a small fraction of this coupling potential is utilized, one might then well suspect that yet unidentified physiological factors play a greater role in recruiting rod\u2013cone GJs, or, alternatively, that these may have an important part in response to stress and injury. One should recollect that GJs play a dual role, for example, conduits of electrical signals and of intracellular molecules.

A good deal of indirect evidence, and a few direct experiments, supports a picture in which rod signals can traverse the retina through a primary (rod bipolar) pathway and a secondary (rod\u2013cone gap coupling) pathway. The present paper provides to date the most detailed and complete characterization of the cone signals inherited from rods via gap junctions. Building on work presented in the authors' previous paper presenting the first whole-cell recordings from mouse cones (<a href=\"#bib6\">Cangiano et al., 2012</a>), it makes a compelling case that the gap-junctional pathway for rod signals through cones exists in mouse, and characterizes a number of aspects of the pathway."

The authors make the interesting observation that rod input into cones can be modest at the beginning of the recording but can become large as the recording proceeds, presumably as the result of some change in the physiology of the photoreceptors or retina. Although the paper leaves open the reason for the large change in gap-junctional conductance, the simple demonstration of large rod input into cones \u2013 regardless of the conditions of the recording \u2013 provides compelling evidence that junctions between rods and cones in mouse are capable of transferring large voltage signals."

We have approached this question by obtaining whole cell patch clamp recordings from cone synaptic terminals, to dialyze cones in the immediate proximity of their GJs to rods, using low (\u223c50 nM free [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>; n=6) or high calcium buffered intracellular solutions (approx. 5 \u00b5M free [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>; n=6). Our findings are presented in a new section of the Results and in a new <a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11</a>. In summary, we have found that the process of coupling increase is expressed even when free [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> in the pedicle is clamped to low levels, both with EGTA and BAPTA. Conversely, high calcium levels did not appear to favor coupling compared to the low calcium condition or to perforated patch recordings."

Moreover, since this phenomenon was expressed both in perforated patch and whole cell recordings, two techniques at opposite extremes in terms of their impact on the intracellular milieu of the cone, we suggest that any diffusible messenger involved in the process would likely be located in the neighboring rods."
