The discrete steps that allow mitochondria to attach to one another and merge their outer membranes are unknown. By combining an <i>in vitro</i> mitochondrial fusion assay with electron cryo-tomography (cryo-ET), we visualize the junction between attached mitochondria isolated from <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> and observe complexes that mediate this attachment. We find that cycles of GTP hydrolysis induce progressive formation of a docking ring structure around extended areas of contact. Further GTP hydrolysis triggers local outer membrane fusion at the periphery of the contact region. These findings unravel key features of mitofusin-dependent fusion of outer membranes and constitute an important advance in our understanding of how mitochondria connect and merge."

The discrete steps that allow mitochondria to attach to one another and merge their outer membranes are unknown. By combining an <i>in vitro</i> mitochondrial fusion assay with electron cryo-tomography (cryo-ET), we visualize the junction between attached mitochondria isolated from <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> and observe complexes that mediate this attachment. We find that cycles of GTP hydrolysis induce progressive formation of a docking ring structure around extended areas of contact. Further GTP hydrolysis triggers local outer membrane fusion at the periphery of the contact region. These findings unravel key features of mitofusin-dependent fusion of outer membranes and constitute an important advance in our understanding of how mitochondria connect and merge."

For example, compartments called mitochondria \u2013 which are surrounded by two layers of membrane \u2013 provide the energy needed for many cell processes. The organization of the network of mitochondria in a cell has a large effect on their capacity to provide energy. Mitochondria can fuse together to make larger compartments or divide to make smaller ones. Defects in fusion or division of mitochondria can reduce the amount of energy that is provided, which, in humans and animals can lead to diseases that affect various organs, especially those in the nervous system."

These proteins then promote a tighter attachment in which the outer membranes of the two mitochondria come into contact over a larger area. This contact area is determined by a linear arrangement of proteins referred to as the docking ring. Brandt, Cavellini <i>et al.</i> further observed that local fusion between the outer membranes takes place at the edge of the contact area in the path of the docking ring."

Fusion and fission are crucial for all mitochondrial functions including oxidative phosphorylation, calcium signalling, apoptosis and lipid metabolism.

To promote fission, soluble DRPs assemble into spirals around membrane compartments. GTP hydrolysis causes the spirals to constrict, reducing the diameter of the compartments, ultimately followed by their separation (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bui and Shaw, 2013</a>). In contrast to fission, the role of DRPs in lipid bilayer fusion remains poorly understood. Among the three families of transmembrane DRPs implicated in fusion, Mitofusins and OPA1 mediate fusion of the mitochondrial outer and inner membranes, respectively, whereas atlastins promote homotypic fusion of ER tubules (<a href=\"#bib33\">McNew et al., 2013</a>). GTP binding and hydrolysis participate in <i>trans</i> auto-oligomerization of atlastins and OPA1 through their respective GTPase domains (<a href=\"#bib1\">Rujiviphat et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Klemm et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Byrnes et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">DeVay et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Meglei and McQuibban, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Moss et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Saini et al., 2014</a>). The resulting homotypic tethering of ER and mitochondrial inner membranes is accompanied by conformational rearrangements of the DRPs that are thought to trigger subsequent fusion of lipid bilayers. Based on structural insights gained from BDLP (Bacterial Dynamin-Like Protein)\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib30\">Low and L\u00f6we, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Low et al., 2009</a>), a close relative of the yeast mitofusin Fzo1, mitofusins may promote outer membrane tethering and fusion through similar processes of oligomerization and conformational rearrangement (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cohen et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Escobar-Henriques and Anton, 2013</a>)."

Whether DRPs participate in the formation of such structures during membrane attachment and fusion is unknown. In particular, the precise orchestration of events from the initial attachment of membranes to their ultimate fusion and the requirement for GTP binding and hydrolysis during these steps is elusive. By combining the power of an <i>in vitro</i> mitochondrial fusion assay with cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET), we undertook to visualize the junction between mitochondria, resulting in an unprecedented dissection of the outer membrane fusion process."

Fusion may occur anywhere within the contact area devoid of visible densities because this area corresponds to regions where membrane contact is closest. Alternatively, the docking ring might trigger fusion over the whole rim of the contact area, similar to the 'vertex ring' that assembles at the edge of docked vacuoles (<a href=\"#bib48\">Wang et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Wickner, 2010</a>). This ring, composed of SNAREs, small GTPases, tethering factors and lipid microdomains, promotes membrane fusion at the periphery of contact regions between vacuoles, generating a lumenal vesicle that degrades in the fused organelle. In the context of mitochondrial fusion, such an intralumenal outer membrane vesicle would block the subsequent attachment of inner membranes. Indeed, we did not find fused outer membrane intermediates of this kind."

While the switch from docking to fusion is bound to be a rapid, transient process and cryo-ET can only sample specimen volumes of the order of 10<sup>\u20137</sup> nanoliters, we succeeded in capturing such a docked intermediate. The tomographic volume shows that the outer membranes of two mitochondria were locally fused to form a toroid, 40 nm pore on one side of the contact area (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). The toroid pore formed in the path of the docking ring (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a> and <a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a>). Densities in the vicinity of the fusion pore were sparse, suggesting that in this region the docking ring structure was in the process of disassembly (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). These observations provide a proof of principle that the docked intermediates are competent for effective outer membrane fusion, raising the question of which molecular events trigger the transition from docking to outer membrane fusion."

To validate Fzo1 as a potential component of the densities found at mitochondrial contact sites, we thus devised an <i>in situ</i> protein labeling strategy for cryo-ET. Recent experiments to label mitochondria for cryo-ET with a purified, biotin-labelled protein import substrate conjugated with streptavidin-coated Quantum Dots have been successful (<a href=\"#bib18\">Gold et al., 2014</a>). To biotinylate mitofusin molecules <i>in situ</i>, Fzo1 was C-terminally fused to the Avi tag, a 15 amino-acid peptide that is recognized and can undergo specific biotinylation by the <i>E. coli</i> biotin ligase BirA (<a href=\"#bib4\">Beckett et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">van Werven and Timmers, 2006</a>). Mitochondria isolated from wild-type (<i>FZO1</i>) or <i>FZO1-Avi</i> cells were biotinylated <i>in vitro</i> with recombinant BirA before processing for outer membrane attachment assays, followed by incubation with streptavidin-coupled Q-Dots to label the Fzo1-Avi construct (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). While Q-Dots were rarely found on the surface of tagged or untagged mitochondria (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C and D</a>, right graph), they were enriched at the junction of attached <i>FZO1-Avi</i> mitochondria as compared to attached <i>FZO1</i> mitochondria (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a>, left graph). Moreover, Q-Dots, and therefore the <i>FZO1-Avi</i> constructs, were located either at the periphery of docked contact sites or between tethered contact sites (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E</a>). These data confirm the accumulation of mitofusins at mitochondrial contact sites and corroborate the likely contribution of Fzo1 to densities found at junctions of tethered and docked intermediates."

We do not exclude that small protein complexes, which are not visible by cryo-ET, might reside between outer membranes and participate in the fusion process. However, our observations do suggest that the docking ring of protein densities is the driving force for subsequent bilayer merging. We thus propose that the fusion of bilayers is initiated by further GTP hydrolysis in the path of the docking ring where the outer membrane curvature is most pronounced (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>, step 3). This step may trigger the disassembly of the docking ring.

So far, the only structural insight into mitofusins derives from the HR2 domain of Mfn1 that has been proposed to tether outer membranes at a distance of 16 nm (<a href=\"#bib24\">Koshiba et al., 2004</a>). This would exceed the 6 nm membrane spacing we measured in tethered intermediates. The overall morphology of the HR2 dimer can hardly account for the distinctive shape of the protein units we observed. However, the structure of the bacterial Fzo1 homolog BDLP in the open conformation (<a href=\"#bib30\">Low and L\u00f6we, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Low et al., 2009</a>) and the established <i>trans</i>-interaction of atlastins through their GTPase domain (<a href=\"#bib5\">Klemm et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Byrnes et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Liu et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Saini et al., 2014</a>) allow us to propose an alternative model. Similar to BDLP, mitofusins bound to GMP-PNP or GTP may adopt an open conformation that, in analogy to atlastins, would promote <i>trans</i>-oligomerization of Fzo1 molecules through their GTPase domain. Conformational changes of the mitofusin oligomers upon GTP hydrolysis would pull the outer membranes closer together. This model is not only consistent with the shape of the protein units we visualized but also with the essential requirement of GTP hydrolysis for transition from mitochondrial tethering to mitochondrial docking we unraveled in this study. Hence, the structure of mitofusins with or without bound GTP will be instrumental to evaluate this model."

However, centrifugation is not sufficient, and an incubation of at least 10 min on ice, previously suggested to promote Fzo1 association in <i>trans</i>, has been shown to be essential for <i>in vitro</i> fusion (<a href=\"#bib36\">Meeusen et al., 2004</a>)."

The observation that fusion starts at the edge of the docking ring and also depends on GTP hydrolysis suggests that the transition from tethering to docking brings membranes closer over an extended area. This would induce a locally increased curvature of the lipid bilayer, which may be critical. An ultimate cycle of GTP hydrolysis in this region of local membrane curvature would therefore lead to fusion instead of bringing membranes closer together. Notably, micrographs taken from gastric mucosa of a mole, featured in Chapter 7 of Don W. Fawcett\u2019s 'The Cell', present a series of three pairs of mitochondria proposed to represent successive stages of mitochondrial fission (<a href=\"#bib16\">Fawcett, 1981</a>). The middle stage intermediate from this series and the fusion events identified in our study actually appear strikingly similar. This not only suggests that the sequence of events shown in this chapter might in fact correspond to successive stages of fusion but also that our model of outer membrane fusion may apply <i>in vivo</i> with mitochondria from mammalian cells."

In yeast, the efficient fusion of outer membranes requires Fzo1 ubiquitylation by the Mdm30 ubiquitin ligase and subsequent degradation by the proteasome (<a href=\"#bib10\">Cohen et al., 2008</a>). While its precise function is yet to be fully characterized, this regulation was previously shown to take place at the stage of mitochondrial attachment (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cohen et al., 2011</a>). It is therefore conceivable that the UPS-dependent regulation of Fzo1 participates in regulating proper assembly of docking rings, which is consistent with the observation that high levels of Fzo1 inhibit mitochondrial docking (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). At this stage, we cannot exclude that ubiquitylation and degradation of Fzo1 regulates the transition from docking to effective fusion of outer membranes. Further investigations will be required to answer the fascinating question of how mitochondrial fusion is regulated.\ufeff\ufeff"

For this purpose, the <i>FZO1</i> ORF placed under control of its own promoter, was fused at its 3\u2019-end in tandem with a sequence encoding for the Avi tag, a 15 amino-acid peptide that can be recognized and undergo specific biotinylation by the <i>E. coli</i> biotin ligase BirA (<a href=\"#bib4\">Beckett et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">van Werven and Timmers, 2006</a>). The resulting <i>pFZO1-AVI</i> plasmid (MC369) was introduced in <i>fzo1\u25b3</i> cells using a plasmid shuffling strategy to yield the <i>FZO1-AVI</i> yeast strain (MCY1155) that expresses Fzo1-Avi as the sole source of mitofusin in the cell. After verifying that Fzo1-Avi is competent for mitochondrial fusion <i>in vivo</i>, mitochondria were purified to promote biotinylation of Fzo1-Avi <i>in vitro</i>. Briefly, 0.5 mg of total mitochondrial enriched fractions prepared from FZO1 (MCY1154) or FZO1-Avi (MCY1155) cells were incubated at 25\u00b0C for 60\u2009min with 10 \u00b5g BirA and 1X biotin in biomix A\u00a0+\u00a0B buffer (Biotinylation kit purchased from GeneCopoeia Inc; Rockville, MD) before processing for attachment assays. Following 30\u2009min incubation on ice in Stage 1 buffer, attachment reactions were incubated for 60\u2009min at 4\u00b0C with 50 nM streptavidin-coupled QDs before processing for cryo-ET analysis."

The authors centrifuged the mitochondria to attach to each other at 4\u00b0C and stimulated fusion by increasing the temperature to 25\u00b0C. After centrifugation, the authors observed two types of mitochondrial contacts. The first type of contact, with a relatively short distance of 1-3 nm, includes a regular pattern of globular proteins or protein complexes at the periphery of the contact sites (termed docking ring) based on three-dimensional reconstitution. The second type of contact does not exhibit a docking ring, and globular protein patterns are observed uniformly over the contact surface. The formation of these contact sites requires Fzo1, an outer membrane GTPase that is essential for mitochondrial fusion. Incubation of mitochondria in the presence of GMP-PNP decreased the first type of contact site with a docking ring and increased the second type of contacts, suggesting that GTP hydrolysis is necessary for the formation of contacts with a docking ring from less-organized contacts. To test whether the docking ring contains Fzo1, the authors examined the localization of Fzo1 using the Avi tag and quantum dots and noted that Fzo1 was enriched at the junctions. The authors additionally suggest that fusion initiates at the periphery of contact sites where the docking ring is located (based on one image that they were able to capture). The model in which Fzo1 forms a ring-like pattern at membrane contacts using GTP hydrolysis is interesting. Since structural intermediates of mitochondrial fusion are largely unknown, this study potentially provides new insight into the mechanisms of mitochondrial fusion. However, at the same time, the findings are still preliminary."

The reviewers appreciate the high technical challenges posed by this problem and the novelty of the approach, but at the same time are skeptical about the model. The main point seems to be that localized tethering is followed by spreading of the contacts to a larger area with Fzo1 moving out to the edges. It is not easy to understand how this sequence of events promotes fusion. The reviewers worry that the spreading could be an artefact of the system; in vitro fusion is slow and relatively inefficient in comparison with fusion in living cells, and thus the single fusion event caught by cryo-EM could be abnormal. Can it be excluded that the large rings may just happen when mitochondria are squished together enough in vitro. It is not clear if this may happen <i>in vivo</i>."

The reviewers appreciate the high technical challenges posed by this problem and the novelty of the approach, but at the same time are skeptical about the model. The main point seems to be that localized tethering is followed by spreading of the contacts to a larger area with Fzo1 moving out to the edges. It is not easy to understand how this sequence of events promotes fusion. The reviewers worry that the spreading could be an artefact of the system;</i> in vitro <i>fusion is slow and relatively inefficient in comparison with fusion in living cells, and thus the single fusion event caught by cryo-EM could be abnormal. Can it be excluded that the large rings may just happen when mitochondria are squished together enough in vitro. It is not clear if this may happen in vivo.</i> "

This distinction was manifest by the observation of outer membrane-fused intermediates in which two unfused cristae systems are surrounded by a single outer membrane. By blocking fusion of inner membranes, the occurrence of such outer membrane-fused intermediates was subsequently demonstrated <i>in vivo</i> (Chan DC <i>et al.</i>, Mol Biol Cell, 2009), confirming that <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> fusion processes are similar."

Most importantly, it establishes that the incubation on ice enables the transition from tethering to docking and demonstrates the essential requirement of GTP hydrolysis, which proves that it is an active process. An important conclusion of the study is that absence of docking systematically correlates with a lower incidence of outer membrane-fused intermediates, and therefore with an inhibition outer membrane fusion. Moreover, mitochondria in the docked configuration are the only intermediates with which we were able to capture fusion events (1 in cryoEM and 2 new events in TEM; see below). Taken together, these observations indicate clearly that docked mitochondria are the initial state in the formation of outer membrane-fused intermediates <i>in vitro</i>. Visualization of docking <i>in vivo</i> merits further investigation, but this clearly goes well beyond the scope of our study. In the revised manuscript, we extended the Discussion to emphasize the main differences between <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> mitochondrial fusion (see point 4 below)."

It has to be realized though that the visualization of such inherently rare events by electron cryo-tomography, which samples volumes of a few billionths of a nanoliter at a time, is extremely difficult. We were fortunate to capture one fusion intermediate after incubation of docked intermediates at 4\u00b0C and extensive screening. By lowering the temperature we slowed down the rate of fusion pore opening as much as possible, but even so found only one single event. In addition, fusion is, even at 4\u00b0C, highly transient, which reduces the capturing probability further. Lowering the temperature to 0\u00b0C is unlikely to help, and temperatures below 0\u00b0C are obviously excluded in aqueous solution. It might be possible to visualize fusion events by live imaging and fluorescence microscopy, but this would be at much lower resolution and an entirely different study."

While this is still a rare event, we were indeed able to image two more fusion events in this way, in addition to the fusion intermediate captured by cryo-EM. In both cases, the outer membranes are fused near the outer rim of the contact region.

It is however important to remember that the enrichment of Fzo1 at mitochondrial contact sites has already been shown by immuno-labelling of TEM sections (Hoppins <i>et al.</i>, J Cell Biol 2009). In our study we nevertheless took the challenge of devising a specific method for Fzo1 labelling on cryo-tomograms, partly to confirm this finding, but mainly to demonstrate that mitofusins accumulate in contact regions, where we discovered the docking rings and regular repeats of globular densities. We must also emphasize that <i>in situ</i> Q-dot labelling of endogenous proteins in cryo-tomograms has to our knowledge never been published before. The reviewers and editors should be aware that our approach thus represents a technical breakthrough and is very much more challenging than a routine labelling technique such as to immuno-staining of thin plastic sections."

The quantification demonstrates that while Q-Dots were rarely found on the surface of tagged or untagged mitochondria (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C and D</a>, right graph), they were enriched threefold at the junction of attached FZO1-Avi mitochondria as compared to attached FZO1 mitochondria (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a>, left graph). This indicates both that Fzo1 labeling was specific (although weak) and that this specific labeling occurred preferentially in regions where Fzo1 accumulates as shown by Hoppins <i>et al</i>. These observations thus confirm that in our tomograms Fzo1 is enriched at mitochondrial contact sites, which is in line with the involvement of this mitofusin in the assembly of docking rings and regular repeats of globular densities."

Third, localizing another protein would require yet another setup to tag the protein, label it with Q-dots and localize it by Cryo-EM, which, taken together, would place an unreasonably heavy burden on us that would take many months."
