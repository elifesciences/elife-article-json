However, the molecular details of how hunger triggers changes in the activity of neural circuits to elicit these adaptive behavioural outcomes remains to be resolved. We show here that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) regulates neuronal activity to elicit appropriate behavioural outcomes in response to acute starvation, and this effect is mediated by the coordinated modulation of glutamatergic inputs. AMPK targets both the AMPA-type glutamate receptor GLR-1 and the metabotropic glutamate receptor MGL-1 in one of the primary circuits that governs behavioural response to food availability in <i>C. elegans</i>. Overall, our study suggests that AMPK acts as a molecular trigger in the specific starvation-sensitive neurons to modulate glutamatergic inputs and to elicit adaptive behavioural outputs in response to acute starvation."

Instead, scientists often study less complex animals like a type of worm called <i>C. elegans</i>, because this model organism has a simpler nervous system and it is easier to observe its feeding behaviours. Previous observations have revealed that well-fed worms travel backwards when they are hungry, revisiting sites where they have previously found food. Yet, when the worms are starving, they move forward more frequently, presumably to find new sources of food."

Worms genetically engineered to lack this enzyme tend to move backward when they are starved, instead of moving forward like typical starving worms. This shows that AMPK triggers a wider search for new food sources. Further experiments showed that AMPK acts to inhibit two receptors, which in turn, affects the activity of two different neurons. These two neurons work together to change the animal\u2019s behaviour and boost the likelihood the animal will be able to find a new food source when food is scarce."

In the absence of food, well-fed animals reverse frequently, a behavioural pattern that reflects a sensory memory of food that is expressed by the navigation circuit and results in efficient exploration of a limited area.

Unlike most other organisms studied to date, <i>C. elegans</i> mutants that lack all AMPK signalling are viable, but show clear phenotypes when subjected to energy stress (<a href=\"#bib55\">Narbonne and Roy, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">2009</a>). Therefore, using calcium imaging, cell type\u2013specific optogenetic techniques, and classic genetic analysis, we identified and characterized the neural circuit in which AMPK functions as a molecular switch. This circuit includes the AIB and AIY interneurons; two neurons that form one of the primary circuits that dictate appropriate food- and odour-evoked behaviours (<a href=\"#bib25\">Gray et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Chalasani et al., 2007</a>). We discovered that AMPK modulates AIB and AIY activity through two distinct mechanisms to ultimately ensure that adaptive foraging behaviours are appropriately triggered during periods of starvation. In the AIB interneurons AMPK regulates the abundance of the \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor GLR-1 in the postsynaptic elements, presumably by phosphorylation of serine 907 and 924 resulting in changes in synaptic strength and specific behavioural outputs. In addition, we also demonstrate that AMPK modulates a key metabotropic glutamate receptor called MGL-1 in the AIY interneuron at both mRNA and protein levels leading to an increase in AIY neuronal activity in starved animals. Together, our results indicate that AMPK acts as a starvation-inducible molecular trigger in the nervous system that modulates glutamatergic neuronal activity by at least two distinct mechanisms to modify behavioural outcomes in response to energy stress."

This is reflected by the frequency of body bends; which is considered as a representative readout for locomotory movement away from a nutrient-depleted environment in search of new resources, and reversals; a behaviour most often associated with local exploration (<a href=\"#bib25\">Gray et al., 2005</a>). Both of these behaviours are affected in starved <i>aak-2</i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>).

In its natural habitat, a well-fed animal would be more likely to risk exploring distant locations for high quality food sources, whereas a starved animal would be less likely to stray far from a recently discovered vital food supply. These paradigms regulate behavioural plasticity in response to starvation in <i>C. elegans</i> and are mediated by distinct dopaminegic and serotonergic signalling (<a href=\"#bib63\">Sawin et al., 2000</a>).

Green and red colos show depolarized and hyperpolarized neurons, respectively. This circuitry consists of AWC sensory neurons and AIB and AIY interneurons. Food or odour removal results in AWC depolarization. Upon its depolarization, AWC releases glutamate at AWC/AIB and AWC/AIY synapses. The released glutamate then eventually acts on AMPA-type glutamate receptor GLR-1 in the AIB or glutamate-gated chloride channel GLC-3 in the AIY resulting in their depolarization and hyperpolarization, respectively. This neuronal pattern ultimately promotes reversals and turns resulting in shorter runs and increased local exploration (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chalasani et al., 2007</a>).

If these defects disrupt distal exploratory foraging behaviour then starved <i>aak-2</i> mutants could also be defective in finding food at a distance. We therefore placed starved animals on plates with a point food source (<i>E. coli)</i> and monitored the time required for each animal to encounter the bacteria. We noted that <i>aak-2</i> mutants were substantially less efficient than wild type controls in their ability to track to the food source (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). However, from this assay alone, we were unable to distinguish if this defect is a consequence of a deficiency in their ability to sense food or to integrate the detection of nutritional signals to appropriately modify locomotory behaviour since we also observed a significant defect in the ability of AMPK mutants to chemotaxis toward the attractant isoamyl alcohol (IAA) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). However, since the expression of <i>aak-2</i> within the sensory neurons failed to restore the defective distal exploratory behaviour in <i>aak-2</i> mutants, while this defect was fully rescued by driving <i>aak-2</i> expression specifically within the AIB and AIY interneurons, we conclude that AMPK is critical for the integration of sensory cues and not with chemosensation per se (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>).

Furthermore, if AMPK does have a specific role in the AIB and the AIY, then what determines its functionality in this subset of AMPK-sensitive neurons? To test if AMPK affects other mediators of glutamatergic inputs we assessed whether AMPK compromise could modify the phenotypes associated with: <i>nmr-1</i>, which encodes a NMDA-type ionotropic glutamate receptor subunit; the glutamate-gated chloride channels <i>avr-14 and mgl-2</i> which encodes a group I metabotropic glutamate receptor (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chalasani et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Piggott et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Dillon et al., 2015</a>).

We monitored calcium transients using the genetically-encoded calcium sensor G-CaMP\u00a0individually in both interneurons as a proxy for neuronal activity (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B,C,D,E,F</a>). We observed a decrease in AIY activity in starved <i>aak-2</i> mutants that was rescued by AIY-specific <i>aak-2</i> expression, consistent with <i>aak-2</i> regulating AIY activity/response during starvation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B,C,G</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Previous studies have shown that calcium spikes in the AIY interneurons correlate positively with forward runs and negatively with the initiation of reversals with gradual increases preceding forward run initiation (<a href=\"#bib23\">Flavell et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Luo et al., 2014</a>). Our results suggest that the decreased AIY activity in starved <i>aak-2</i> mutants at least partially contributes to their defective distal exploratory behaviour. To further investigate whether the increased reversal rate correlates with decreased AIY activity in starved <i>aak-2</i> mutants, we monitored the calcium levels in the AIY interneuron of freely behaving animals. The AIY calcium levels were consistently higher upon the termination of reversals, and during the subsequent forward runs with gradual increase preceding forward run initiation suggesting that the calcium peaks in the AIY correlate with the suppression of reversals and the observed acute increase in forward speed (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). Furthermore, consistent with our previous results, we found that starved <i>aak-2</i> mutants display increased reversal frequency and shorter durations of forward locomotion, both of which correlated with decreased calcium influx and associated AIY activity (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2C,E,F</a>)."

Given the epistatic relationship between <i>aak-2</i> and <i>glr-1</i> we next asked if the increased reversal frequency in starved <i>aak-2</i> mutants occurs as a result of decreased GLR-1 turnover linked to a change in its post-translational regulation due to the absence of AMPK.\u00a0To examine this possibility, we used a previously described chimaeric receptor tagged with the green fluorescent protein (GLR-1::GFP) that localizes to discrete punctate structures and that can be used to visualize central glutamatergic synapses in living animals (<a href=\"#bib8\">Burbea et al., 2002</a>). We measured the density of GLR-1::GFP-containing puncta in the AIB neuronal process in a strain that expresses GLR-1::GFP driven by the AIB-specific promoter <i>npr-9</i>. Notably, we observed that the GLR-1 levels in the AIB neuronal process in the nerve ring where the AIB interneurons form their synapses (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>) was significantly greater in <i>aak-2</i> mutants than WT animals during starvation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,C</a>). Moreover, this difference could be rescued by introducing AMPK specifically within the AIB interneurons (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>), highlighting the importance of AMPK in modulating GLR-1 abundance within the AIB interneurons."

Therefore, to further investigate if the effect of AMPK on GLR-1 abundance is limited to the AIB interneurons or alternatively AMPK is globally required for the modulation of GLR-1 steady state levels throughout the nervous system, we measured the density of GLR-1::GFP-containing puncta in the anterior region of the ventral nerve cord between the RIG neuron cell bodies, and in the vulva using the [P<i>glr-1::glr-1::gfp</i>] transgene (<a href=\"#bib8\">Burbea et al., 2002</a>).

To determine the importance of these sites we used the [P<i>npr-9::glr-1::gfp</i>] fusion protein as a template to generate a GLR-1::GFP variant with non-phosphorylable AMPK sites. The cytoplasmic domain of GluR has already been described as an important phosphoregulatory target, mostly by kinases such as PKA and PKC (<a href=\"#bib60\">Roche et al., 1996</a>). Since two conserved AMPK phosphorylation sites were identified within the cytoplasmic domain of GLR-1 (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1F</a>), we mutated both S907 and S924 to non-phosphorylable alanine residues to evaluate how these sites contribute to the stability of GLR-1 within the AIB neuronal process during periods of starvation. Wild type animals bearing the compound (S907A, S924A) variant transgene demonstrated defective exploratory behaviour that was comparable to <i>aak-2</i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). To further examine if the GLR-1 receptors that accumulate in AMPK mutants act as functional synaptic receptors we examined the locomotory behaviour of <i>eat-4; glr-1</i> double mutants expressing the non-phosphorylable variant (S907A, S924A). We noticed that the\u00a0increased reversal frequency rate accompanied by reduced forward locomotion in animals expressing the (S907A, S924A) variant was largely suppressed in the absence of <i>eat-4</i> indicating that the compromise of AMPK signalling results in an increased abundance of functional synaptic GLR-1 receptors (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>).\u00a0Furthermore, the GLR-1 (S907A, S924A) variant accumulated in the AIB neuronal process and this accumulation was not enhanced upon removal of <i>unc-11</i> (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>), further suggesting that AMPK regulates GLR-1 abundance directly by phosphorylating the protein to mediate UNC-11/AP180-dependent GLR-1 endocytosis in response to starvation."

Although we did not observe any change in the levels of <i>glc-3</i> mRNA in well-fed or starved animals, we did observe an slight increase in <i>mgl-1</i> mRNA levels in well-fed and a more significant increase in starved <i>aak-2</i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1B,C</a>) suggesting that AMPK regulates MGL-1 levels by either blocking its transcription or affecting the stability of <i>mgl-1</i> transcripts. The former possibility is less plausible given the short time delay that occurs between the response to food deprivation and the consequent behavioural changes. Since we did not detect any significant change in the <i>mgl-1</i> mRNA levels in WT animals, it is likely that AMPK controls the abundance of <i>mgl-1</i> transcripts in the AIY and possibly other <i>mgl-1</i>-expressing neurons in response to starvation, typical of its function in adapting to energy stress. These results however do not exclude the possible role of AMPK in regulating MGL-1 protein levels directly through phosphorylation, as has been described for some ion channels (<a href=\"#bib42\">Lang and F\u00f6ller, 2014</a>), although this would be in addition to its observed impact on <i>mgl-1</i> transcript abundance."

This suggests that AMPK regulates <i>mgl-1</i> activity by impinging on both mRNA and protein function. The AMPK-mediated phosphorylation of serine 234 in MGL-1 may be required for the modulation of distal exploratory behaviour independent of its regulation of MGL-1 levels. We currently cannot exclude that this post-translational modification could affect some aspect of MGL-1 receptor function. Taken together, our results are consistent with a role for AMPK in modulating <i>mgl-1</i> function in the AIY interneurons whereby <i>mgl-1</i> activity is attenuated in response to starvation-induced AMPK signalling resulting in increased AIY activity and the consequent suppression of reversals."

This difference can be explained by the fact that the overexpressed GLR-1 is most likely still targeted for endocytosis and degradation while AMPK is present and active, while in <i>aak-2</i> mutants there is a defect in GLR-1 endocytosis allowing it to accumulate to functionally critical levels in the puncta.

The spectrum of these responses however varies dramatically and naturally reflects both the environment and the physiology of the organism. Humans are characteristically hypersensitive and/or rapidly irritable during periods of acute food deprivation providing a familiar example of how a collection of neural circuits become reproducibly activated or blocked in response to this specific acute stress, culminating in highly predictable behavioural responses. These behavioural changes are achieved in part through synaptic plasticity, which is required for adaptation to varying circumstances in an experience-dependent manner\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib6\">Bito, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Collingridge et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Liu et al., 2012</a>).

We were able to improve forward locomotion by the targeted expression of <i>aak-2</i> in the AIB and AIY interneurons, while consequently reducing the abnormally frequent reversal behaviour typical of AMPK mutants, consistent with the involvement of AIB and AIY in regulating both reversal frequency and the duration of forward movement (<a href=\"#bib66\">Tsalik and Hobert, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Wakabayashi et al., 2004</a>).

Remarkably, our results delineate a novel role for AMPK in the modulation of neuronal activity in response to starvation through the simultaneous regulation of glutamatergic inputs mediated by two different receptors: GluR/GLR-1 in the AIB and MGL-1 in the AIY. Of note, unlike <i>mgl-1</i> null mutations that resulted in the\u00a0partial rescue of locomotory behaviour of <i>aak-2</i> mutants, we noticed a complete rescue upon removal of <i>eat-4</i> or <i>glr-1</i>.

Our data demonstrate that the loss of AMPK signalling results in an increase in AIB neuronal activity and a concomitant decrease in AIY activity. This may be rationalized by the fact that <i>C. elegans</i> neurons release neurotransmitter in a graded fashion. Like vertebrate rod and cone photoreceptors which show tonic activity in the dark, and are hyperpolarized or depolarized by light, and removal of light respectively, AWC olfactory neurons have been shown to display basal activity in the absence of odour, but are inhibited or stimulated by odour or odour removal, respectively (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chalasani et al., 2007</a>). Therefore, the increased GLR-1 and MGL-1 abundance in the AIB and AIY interneurons could potentially result in responses of longer duration and increased strength upon tonic neurotransmitter release at rest, or upon activation of AWC consequently increasing reversal frequency and shortening runs (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>)."

We provide several lines of evidence that demonstrate that AMPK regulates GLR-1 abundance, by affecting its ubiquitylation status during conditions of acute starvation. First, the total GLR-1 level is decreased upon starvation. Second, the amplitude and size/width of GLR-1 puncta that are two determinants of GLR-1 abundance are increased in the AIB neuronal process and in the ventral nerve cord in <i>aak-2</i> mutants. Third, this elevated GLR-1 accumulation cannot be further enhanced upon the disruption of the various processes required to remove GLR-1 from the membrane suggesting that AMPK and the ubiquitin-mediated internalization of GLR-1 may therefore function in a linear genetic pathway. Fourth, mutating the AMPK phosphorylation sites in GLR-1 results in increased GLR-1 abundance and defective distal exploratory behaviour. Finally, this defect is comparable to that observed in <i>aak-2</i> mutants, while crossing the GLR-1 (S907A, S924A) variant into the <i>aak-2</i> mutant background did not further exacerbate the distal exploratory behavioural defect. Therefore, consistent with its well-described role in the mouse where it regulates glutamatergic neurotransmission (<a href=\"#bib73\">Yang et al., 2011</a>), AMPK is required to regulate the abundance of GLR-1 in specific glutamatergic neurons. In doing so it modulates glutamatergic inputs and synaptic strength to elicit appropriate behavioural outcomes in response to starvation."

AMPK modulates glutamatergic inputs in both interneurons by impinging on AMPA-type glutamate receptor GLR-1 and metabotropic glutamate receptor MGL-1 which consequently regulate distinct downstream behavioural outputs. The most salient feature of our study is our demonstration that AMPK acts as a molecular switch in the nervous system that is most likely not limited to the circuitries engaged in the\u00a0regulation of feeding and locomotory behaviours. Given the conserved AMPK phosphorylation sites in GLR-1 and MGL-1, we speculate that AMPK regulates the activity of neural circuits in various organisms at least partly by affecting these two receptor types to modulate a wide range of neuronal outputs that respond to physiological or developmental contexts involving various stresses. Alternatively, its starvation-inducible or pharmacological activation could provide a highly effective, non-invasive means of modifying behavioural outputs."

The study has identified the key interneurons in a locomotory circuit as the functional targets of the AMPK <i>aak-2</i> in response to starvation.

Similarly, <i>aak-2</i> animals that were previously well-fed or starved display a comparable rate of forward locomotion similarly-treated wild type animals when evaluated on an abundant food source after a short period of time (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B, C</a>). To further examine if <i>aak-2</i> mutants display a general dampening of locomotory speed we examined the forward locomotion rate (body bends) of <i>aak-2</i> mutants upon exposure to a gentle touch applied to the posterior (just before the anus). We found that <i>aak-2</i> mutants show similar locomotory speed compared to WT animals following this touch stimulus suggesting that they do not display any defect in locomotory speed (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D</a> and subsection \u201cNeuronal AMPK signalling triggers distal exploratory behaviour in starved animals\u201d, fourth paragraph). Therefore, it is likely that the basal AMPK activity regulates the observed change in speed specifically in response to food depletion in well-fed animals, while it has a more pronounced effect on behaviour when activated upon prolonged starvation. Since the increased reversal frequency affects the duration of forward movement (Burbea M, Dreier L., 2002; Tsalik and Hobert, 2003 and our <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2E, G</a>), we believe that the forward locomotion rate in starved <i>aak-2</i> animals is very likely to be also affected by the <i>aak-2</i>-associated defect in suppressing reversals. This can potentially explain the reason for greater difference in forward locomotion between <i>aak-2</i> and WT animals upon 2 hours of starvation compared to 10 minutes off food. Because of the antagonistic relationship between forward and backward locomotion, we always try to include the results for both forward and backward locomotion throughout our study. We pointed this out in the third paragraph of the aforementioned subsection in our description of the data presented in the first figure (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). We show that the effect of AMPK on locomotory behaviour is largely confined to starved animals, while AMPK also regulates reversal frequency."

As previously mentioned, to examine if <i>aak-2</i> mutants display a decrease in locomotory speed we monitored the locomotory behaviour of <i>aak-2</i> mutants upon exposure to a gentle touch applied to the posterior end of their body. In our opinion this serves as a good control since it is a stimulus that is unrelated to the starvation-sensing circuit.

This is further corroborated by our optogenetic results where we show that although AIY activation or AIB inactivation in starved WT animals (when AIB is likely inactive and AIY is likely active (Gray et al., 2005)), do not change their locomotory behaviour, while optogenetically activating AIY or inactivating AIB in <i>aak-2</i> mutants ameliorates both forward and backward locomotion. Therefore, taken altogether it is unlikely that the reduced locomotory speed in <i>aak-2</i> mutants is a consequence of a more general developmental deficit. Rather, it is most probably a consequence of reduced AIY activity and increased AIB activity in starved <i>aak-2</i> mutants."

We did the experiment and the data have been added to the revised manuscript as <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>. Previous studies have shown that overexpression of GLR-1 in the AIB interneurons causes an increase in reversal rate in the absence of food(Chalasani et al., 2007), while a group in Japan has recently reported that <i>mgl-1</i> mutants display a reduced reversal rate. Their data indicate that the expression levels of MGL-1 in the AIY interneurons are critical for appropriate chemotaxis toward DA and increased MGL-1 levels result in abnormal choice between the repellant and attractant (Suehiro and Mitani, International <i>C. elegans</i> Conference 2015). These results are consistent with our data that demonstrate the accumulation of GLR-1 and MGL-1 in the AIB and AIY interneurons of starved AMPK mutants, respectively. Furthermore, these changes in abundance correlate with changes in the forward and backward locomotion rate and aberrant chemotaxis. In our study, using various approaches, we highlight that the appropriate suppression of reversals that would normally occur during starvation is impaired in <i>aak-2</i> mutants and is potentially caused by the increased abundance of GLR-1 and/or MGL-1. To determine whether the increased abundance of these receptors can cause the same phenotype as <i>aak-2</i> mutants, we examined the locomotory behaviour of starved animals that overexpress GLR-1 in the AIB, or MGL-1 in the AIY, or in animals that overexpress both transgenes. As we have shown in <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, overexpressing MGL-1 in the AIY resulted in a phenotype that was quite similar to that seen in starved <i>aak-2</i> mutants. The overexpression of MGL-1 in the AIY interneurons was more effective in phenocopying the locomotory defects of starved <i>aak-2</i> mutants than the effect of overexpression of GLR-1 in the AIB, which resulted in a modest, but nevertheless significant, defect in transition between local to distal exploration. This can be explained by the fact that overexpressed GLR-1 is most likely still targeted for endocytosis and degradation while AMPK is present and active. In <i>aak-2</i> mutants there is a defect in GLR-1 endocytosis allowing it to accumulate in puncta. However, when it is overexpressed there is some accumulation but AMPK is still present to modulate the excess accumulation of the receptor. Nevertheless, overexpression of either of these, or both transgenes results in a similar behavioural defect as that which we report for <i>aak-2</i> mutants. We have added these data to the manuscript as <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, and we describe our interpretations in the last paragraph of the subsection \u201cAMPK modulates MGL-1 in the mRNA and protein levels in the AIY interneurons to modify distal exploratory behaviour in response to starvation\u201d."

Therefore the GFP signal was initially quantified in the strains that express a single copy of the MGL-1::GFP from endogenous <i>mgl-1</i> promoter sequence. However, since <i>mgl-1</i> is expressed in the AIY interneurons at much lower levels compared to other <i>mgl-1</i>-expressing neurons (data not shown), this signal was very faint and was easily bleached, we repeated and confirmed these results in strains that express MGL-1::GFP in extra chromosomal arrays in order to obtain better quality images and eliminate the problem of rapid photobleaching. To ensure that our observations of the multi-copy transgene are not a consequence of differential expression of the array, 3 independent MGL-1::GFP-expressing strains were examined by an experimenter who was blind to the genotypes of the strains in each case. The results obtained with all three transgenic lines were consistent with our observations made with the CRISPR-introduced allele. We therefore strongly believe that the signal we observe with the extrachromosomal transgenes recapitulates the endogenous situation and indicates that MGL-1 levels vary between starved WT and <i>aak-2</i> mutant animals."

                    "text": "Since we had to assess the GLR-1::GFP signal in the neuronal process of AIB, a single copy transgene was not sufficient to generate a strong and quantifiable signal for our experiments. Therefore, as was the case with the MGL-1::GFP, we generated multiple transgenic lines which were scored by an experimenter who was blind to the genotypes while the images were being acquired and also during subsequent analysis. We obtained reproducible results from all of our transgenic lines that were consistent with GLR-1 being regulated by AMPK in the AIB neuronal process. Moreover, since GLR-1 abundance in the AIB neuronal process was clearly elevated in <i>unc-11</i> animals, and which was not further enhanced upon the removal of <i>aak-2</i>, we conclude that AMPK must be part of a linear pathway that contributes to the endocytic regulation of GLR-1 abundance. Consistent with this possibility GLR-1 variants that lacked the consensus AMPK phosphorylation sites in GLR-1 accumulated in a manner similar to <i>unc-11</i> mutants or in <i>aak-2; unc-11</i> doubles. Because we can quantify differences in the levels of GLR-1 and its variants in the various genotypes we have tested, it seems unlikely that the transgenic expression levels contribute significantly to the regulation that we observe. We therefore contend that the AMPK-dependent differences in GLR-1 abundance that we observe in the AIB neuronal process in starved animals are not the result of the increased GLR-1 contributed by the extrachromosomal, multicopy transgenes, but rather due to the regulation of the protein by AMPK and additional regulators of the endocytic degradation pathway."
