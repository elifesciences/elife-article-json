ATPase assays and mass spectrometry analysis of the 2D crystals confirmed that the enzyme complex was complete and active. The structure of the matrix-exposed region was determined at 24 \u00c5 resolution by subtomogram averaging and repositioned into the tomographic volume to reveal the crystal packing. F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub> ATP synthase complexes are inclined by 16\u00b0 relative to the crystal plane, resulting in a zigzag topology of the membrane and indicating that monomeric bovine heart F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub> ATP synthase by itself is sufficient to deform lipid bilayers. This local membrane curvature is likely to be instrumental in the formation of ATP synthase dimers and dimer rows, and thus for the shaping of mitochondrial cristae."

ATPase assays and mass spectrometry analysis of the 2D crystals confirmed that the enzyme complex was complete and active. The structure of the matrix-exposed region was determined at 24 \u00c5 resolution by subtomogram averaging and repositioned into the tomographic volume to reveal the crystal packing. F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub> ATP synthase complexes are inclined by 16\u00b0 relative to the crystal plane, resulting in a zigzag topology of the membrane and indicating that monomeric bovine heart F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub> ATP synthase by itself is sufficient to deform lipid bilayers. This local membrane curvature is likely to be instrumental in the formation of ATP synthase dimers and dimer rows, and thus for the shaping of mitochondrial cristae."

Animals, plants, and fungi primarily make their ATP in a specialised compartment called the mitochondrion, which is found inside their cells. The mitochondrion is often referred to as the powerhouse of cells as it captures and stores the energy that animals gain from eating food in the molecule ATP. Other enzymes in the cell break apart ATP to release the stored energy, which they use to power various cellular processes."

The tight folding of the inner membrane is thought to make this process more efficient. An enzyme named ATP synthase performs the final steps of the energy transformation process by producing ATP (ATP synthase literally means \u2018ATP maker\u2019). This enzyme sits in pairs along the edges of the inner membrane folds. This raises the question: does the ATP synthase cause the membrane to fold or does this enzyme just \u2018prefer\u2019 these folded edges (which are instead caused by something else inside the mitochondrion)?"

An electron microscope was used to generate a three-dimensional volume of the 2D membrane crystal via a process similar to a MRI or CAT scan that one might have in hospital. In the three-dimensional volume of the membrane crystal, Jiko, Davies et al. discovered that instead of being flat as expected, the membrane of the 2D membrane crystal was rippled and that this ripple was caused by the membrane-embedded part of the ATP synthase. The geometry of the ripple exactly matched half of the bend at the edge of the membrane folds in the mitochondrion. Therefore, Jiko, Davies et al. concluded that a pair of ATP synthases, as found in mitochondria, was responsible for defining the tight folds of the inner mitochondrial membrane."

Nevertheless, a number of atomic models have been obtained by x-ray crystallography for various parts of the yeast and bovine mitochondrial F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub> ATP synthase including the F<sub>1</sub> subcomplex (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abrahams et al., 1994</a>), the F<sub>1</sub>/<i>c</i>-ring subcomplex (<a href=\"#bib35\">Stock et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Watt et al., 2010</a>), the peripheral stalk subcomplex (<a href=\"#bib10\">Dickson et al., 2006</a>), and the F<sub>1</sub>/peripheral stalk fragment (<a href=\"#bib27\">Rees et al., 2009</a>). All these structures except the <i>c</i>-ring belong to the soluble region of the F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub> ATP synthase. The membrane-embedded part of the mitochondrial F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub> ATP synthase has two important functions. First, it allows protons to cross the membrane, thereby driving ATP synthesis; and second, it causes the dimerisation and oligomerisation of the enzyme in the membrane. The first structure of the membrane-embedded region of an F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub> ATP synthase dimer was recently determined for the colourless green algae, <i>Polytomella sp.</i>, by single-particle cryo-EM (<a href=\"#bib2\">Allegretti et al., 2015</a>). At 7 \u00c5, the map shows that the conserved <i>a</i>-subunit forms a pair of horizontal helix haripins adjacent to the <i>c</i>-ring, whereas the peripheral stalk forms an intricate and unique dimerisation interface which is different from that of the bovine or yeast enzyme (<a href=\"#bib9\">Davies et al., 2011</a>)."

Knock-out studies in yeast demonstrated the involvement of subunits e and g in dimer formation and cristae morphology, suggesting a crucial role of the F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub> ATP synthase dimers in cristae formation (<a href=\"#bib21\">Paumard et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Davies et al., 2012</a>). Subtomogram averaging of the F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub> ATP synthase dimers in situ revealed an angle of 86\u00b0 between the monomers (<a href=\"#bib7\">Davies et al., 2012</a>). Coarse-grained molecular dynamic simulations have indicated that the shape of the F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub> ATP synthase dimer alone is sufficient to deform the lipid bilayer and drive the self-assembly of the F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub> ATP synthase dimers into rows (<a href=\"#bib7\">Davies et al., 2012</a>). However, a recent single-particle cryo-EM map of detergent solubilised, bovine F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub> ATP synthase monomers found the detergent micelle around the F<sub>o</sub> domain was bent leading to the suggestion that the monomer alone could deform lipid bilayers (<a href=\"#bib3\">Baker et al., 2012</a>)."

To determine the structure of membrane-embedded bovine heart F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub> ATP synthase, we generated 2D crystals of intact and active bovine heart F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub> ATP synthase using the synthetic lipid 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DMPC). By a combination of subtomogram averaging and electron crystallography of tomographic slices, we determined the in situ structure and packing of the enzyme complex in 2D crystals. The oblique orientation of individual complexes in the membrane results in a zigzag arrangement of the lipid bilayer, which perfectly matches the observed bend in the detergent micelle of the isolated complex (<a href=\"#bib3\">Baker et al., 2012</a>). Our results demonstrate that the transmembrane region of bovine mitochondrial F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub> ATP synthase monomer is sufficient to bend the lipid bilayer. This membrane deformation is likely to be a prerequisite for the self-association of F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub> ATP synthases into dimers and dimers into rows, as observed in mitochondrial cristae."

The F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub> ATP synthases form pairs of particles of twofold symmetry, which are in contact half-way up the peripheral stalks. The angle included by the long axes of the monomers in a pair is approximately 24\u00b0 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Note that these ATP synthase pairs in the 2D crystals are structurally unrelated to the native dimers observed in mitochondrial membranes (<a href=\"#bib36\">Strauss et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Davies et al., 2011</a>). Pairs of F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub> ATP synthase particles from opposite faces of the lipid bilayer interact via their <i>c</i>-rings and are related to each other by a \u223c90\u00b0 rotation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>)."

In this view, it becomes apparent that the pairs of opposing <i>c</i>-rings and the long axes of the F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub> ATP synthases include an angle of 16\u00b0 with the crystal plane. Therefore, in order for the <i>c</i>-rings to be fully embedded in the membrane, the lipid bilayer within the 2D crystals must adopt a zigzag topology, as observed in the vesicle cross-sections (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). To assess whether the F<sub>o</sub> domain of the bovine F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub> ATP synthase could in fact account for this curvature, we placed the segmented volume of the single-particle map of this enzyme (<a href=\"#bib3\">Baker et al., 2012</a>) into our extended sub-tomogram average. To our surprise, the bend of the micelle-embedded membrane region of the single-particle map perfectly matched the kink in the membrane that is required to hold successive <i>c</i>-rings together (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D,E</a>). Thus the packing of F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub> ATP synthases into the 2D crystal strongly supports the notion that the membrane domain of the monomeric bovine heart F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub> ATP synthases is inherently bent and that this is sufficient to impose a local curvature on the lipid bilayer."

Even though the resolution of our sub-tomogram average at 24 \u00c5 is nominally less good than that of the single-particle map at 18 \u00c5, several features are more clearly resolved. This includes the densities of the central and peripheral stalks, the OSCP subunit and the \u03b1- and \u03b2-subunits, which are clearly separated in the sub-tomogram average (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). This may be a result of the more accurate particle alignment, which used 3D volumes rather than 2D projection images. In fact, <a href=\"#bib3\">Baker et al. (2012)</a> recently reported that by reducing their data set by 82% to include only the best projection images, structural features of their cryo-EM map became clearer, although the nominal resolution, determined by the Fourier shell correlation, was unchanged. The resolution of our sub-tomogram average is about 1.5\u00d7 better in the x\u2013y plane than the z direction due to the single orientation of F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub> ATP synthase particles in the crystal relative to the missing wedge of information (<a href=\"#bib26\">Radermacher, 1988</a>)."

A small connecting density visible between the midpoint of the peripheral stalk and \u03b1-subunit may account for this difference. A similar connection is seen in the single-particle cryo-EM map of the bovine complex (<a href=\"#bib3\">Baker et al., 2012</a>). Analysis of the fitted x-ray structure suggests possible ionic interactions between subunit <i>d</i> and residues 463\u2013475 of the \u03b1-subunit, which is the point where the structures of the \u03b1 and \u03b2-subunits diverge (<a href=\"#bib41\">Walker et al., 1982</a>). This additional contact may help the peripheral stalk in its role as a stator, but may also prevent the stalk from interfering with the catalytic cycle of the \u03b2-subunit by pulling it away from the \u03b1/\u03b2 interface. Alternatively, the peripheral stalk may be pulled away from the \u03b1/\u03b2 interface by its interactions in the membrane."

In accordance with this, we were able to fit the bovine heart peripheral stalk fragment (<a href=\"#bib10\">Dickson et al., 2006</a>) extended by several residues from the F<sub>1</sub>-peripheral stalk structure (<a href=\"#bib27\">Rees et al., 2009</a>) into the density as a rigid body without the need to introduce hinges as previously suggested (<a href=\"#bib3\">Baker et al., 2012</a>) (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This fit therefore challenges the notion that the peripheral stalk acts as a flexible linker that stores torque or elastic energy during the catalytic cycle (<a href=\"#bib34\">Sorgen et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Sorgen et al., 1999</a>). This hypothesis was based on the bacterial enzyme, which has a peripheral stalk consisting of only two long alpha helices. The bovine peripheral stalk, in contrast, consists of one long alpha helix plus subunits <i>d</i>, F<sub>6</sub> and the N-terminal domains of other F<sub>o</sub> subunits, which would generate a more rigid structure (<a href=\"#bib10\">Dickson et al., 2006</a>). A rigid peripheral stalk would hold the (\u03b1\u03b2)<sub>3</sub> hexamer in a stationary position relative to the membrane. This is probably more important in mitochondria than in bacteria, as the mitochondrial F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub> ATP synthase has another important role in generating local membrane curvature and maintaining cristae morphology through the formation of dimer rows (<a href=\"#bib7\">Davies et al., 2012</a>). The dimer interface is located at the base of the peripheral stalk (<a href=\"#bib9\">Davies et al., 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib7\">2012</a>) and thus any flexibility in the structure of the peripheral stalk may compromise the formation and stability of the dimer."

This was surprising as the <i>c</i>-ring, located directly beneath the central stalk, is easily visible in x-ray models filtered to 20 \u00c5 resolution. Therefore, if the sub-volumes are well enough aligned to give an overall resolution of 24 \u00c5, we would expect to see the <i>c</i>-ring in the lipid bilayer. In our sub-tomogram average, we only see a weak density for the <i>c</i>-ring. The lack of detail in the membrane region is unlikely to be caused by the missing wedge as we have observed a similar phenomenon in sub-tomogram averages of other membrane proteins, which have no missing wedge of information, and in single-particle maps when the resolution does not extend beyond 15 \u00c5. The extent of this problem appears to correlate with the composition of the surrounding lipid or detergent. Thus, the lack of protein density in the membrane region for our averages at this resolution seems to be caused mainly by contrast matching between the surrounding lipid and protein."

This improved the signal-to-noise ratio because noise originating from additional crystal layers or surrounding buffer was removed in silico by careful selection of the z-slices and Fourier filtering of the diffraction pattern. Thus 2D processing of tomographic 3D crystal volumes poses an attractive alternative for the electron crystallographic treatment of small 2D crystals of large membrane complexes that are not accessible to canonical image processing due to limited size and order. As exemplified in our 2D crystal of the F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub> ATP synthase, the molecular packing of multi-subunit membrane complexes with large extramembranous domains can be complicated with multiple layers and multiple tilt angles relative to the crystal plane. These are circumstances under which projection maps alone are easily misinterpreted and our approach of combining electron tomography with electron crystallography enables a straightforward interpretation (<a href=\"#bib14\">Gerle et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Tani et al., 2013</a>)."

F<sub>1</sub> subcomplexes were picked manually in 3dmod with the F<sub>1</sub> subcomplexes of opposite orientation assigned to different files. Particles were separated randomly into two data sets and processed independently. Particle alignment was performed in PEET, starting with the contrast-enhanced binned 2 \u00d7 2 tomograms, then the binned 2 \u00d7 2 tomograms without contrast enhancement and finally the unbinned (1 \u00d7 1) volume. An initial reference volume was calculated for each data set by averaging all selected subvolumes on one side of the membrane. Subvolumes containing F<sub>1</sub> subcomplexes from the opposite side of the membrane were rotated 180\u00b0 about the x-axis prior to alignment. Alignment parameters were then restricted to \u00b145\u00b0 about the x and y-axis, and 12 pixels in xyz. No restriction was placed on the z-axis rotation. Initial alignment was performed with a resolution limit of 60 \u00c5 and gradually lowered to 30 \u00c5 in accordance with the FSC. To assess over-fitting, phases beyond 40 \u00c5 in the tomogram were randomized and the last alignment iteration was repeated (<a href=\"#bib5\">Chen et al., 2013</a>). The final average, calculated from 2500 subvolumes, was filtered to 18 \u00c5 using a Fermi filter with a temperature factor of 0.002 px<sup>\u22121</sup> (<a href=\"#bib13\">Frank, 1996</a>). Fourier shell correlation was performed in PEET using a box size of 96 voxels. Atomic models were docked into the EM density using the sequential fit routine of Chimera and superimposed using the matchmaker command (<a href=\"#bib23\">Pettersen et al., 2004</a>). Electron density maps of atomic models were calculated in CCP4 (<a href=\"#bib43\">Winn et al., 2011</a>)."

This is because the lipid bilayer has no regular order, and the Fourier terms originating from the membrane are filtered out during the masking of the protein diffraction pattern. A similar process also occurs during helical reconstructions, which means the signal from the protein is enhanced whereas the signal from disordered lipid is removed. In contrast, subtomogram averaging is conducted using real space cross correlation-based methods and all Fourier terms including those from the membrane contribute to the final average. This means both contrast matching and the missing wedge greatly affects the final average and both are likely to be important causes for the absence of transmembrane density in our subtomogram average."
