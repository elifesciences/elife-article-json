Little is known about whether optimality is preserved when subjects can choose when to make a decision (reaction-time task), nor when sensory inputs have time-varying reliability. Using a reaction-time version of a visual/vestibular heading discrimination task, we show that behavior is clearly sub-optimal when quantified with traditional optimality metrics that ignore reaction times. We created a computational model that accumulates evidence optimally across both cues and time, and trades off accuracy with decision speed. This model quantitatively explains subjects's choices and reaction times, supporting the hypothesis that subjects do, in fact, accumulate evidence optimally over time and across sensory modalities, even when the reaction time is under the subject's control."

Little is known about whether optimality is preserved when subjects can choose when to make a decision (reaction-time task), nor when sensory inputs have time-varying reliability. Using a reaction-time version of a visual/vestibular heading discrimination task, we show that behavior is clearly sub-optimal when quantified with traditional optimality metrics that ignore reaction times. We created a computational model that accumulates evidence optimally across both cues and time, and trades off accuracy with decision speed. This model quantitatively explains subjects's choices and reaction times, supporting the hypothesis that subjects do, in fact, accumulate evidence optimally over time and across sensory modalities, even when the reaction time is under the subject's control."

Numerous previous studies have examined how integrating multiple sensory cues\u2014either within or across sensory modalities\u2014alters perceptual sensitivity (<a href=\"#bib47\">van Beers et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Ernst and Banks, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Battaglia et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Fetsch et al., 2009</a>). These studies generally reveal that subjects' ability to discriminate among stimuli improves when multiple sensory cues are available, such as visual and tactile (<a href=\"#bib47\">van Beers et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Ernst and Banks, 2002</a>), visual and auditory (<a href=\"#bib1\">Battaglia et al., 2003</a>), or visual and vestibular (<a href=\"#bib15\">Fetsch et al., 2009</a>) cues. The performance gains associated with cue integration are generally well predicted by models that combine information across senses in a statistically optimal manner (<a href=\"#bib8\">Clark and Yuille, 1990</a>). Specifically, we consider cue integration to be optimal if the information in the combined, multisensory condition is the sum of that available from the separate cues (see <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a> for formal statement) (<a href=\"#bib8\">Clark and Yuille, 1990</a>)."

In natural settings, by contrast, subjects usually choose for themselves when they have gathered enough information to make a decision. In such contexts, it is possible that subjects integrate multiple cues to gain speed or to increase their proportion of correct responses (or some combination of effects), and it is unknown whether standard criteria for optimal cue integration apply. Indeed, using a reaction-time version of a multimodal heading discrimination task, we demonstrate here that human performance is markedly suboptimal when evaluated with standard criteria that ignore reaction times. Thus, the conventional framework for optimal cue integration is not applicable to behaviors in which decision times are under subjects' control."

Some of these studies have reported that reaction times for multisensory stimuli are faster than predicted by \u2018parallel race\u2019 models (<a href=\"#bib38\">Raab, 1962</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Miller, 1982</a>), suggesting that multisensory inputs are combined into a common representation. However, other groups have failed to replicate these findings (<a href=\"#bib10\">Corneil et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Whitchurch and Takahashi, 2006</a>) and it is unclear whether the sensory inputs are combined optimally. Thus, multisensory integration in reaction time experiments remains poorly understood, and there is no coherent framework for evaluating optimal decision making that incorporates both perceptual sensitivity and reaction times. We address this substantial gap in knowledge both theoretically and experimentally."

Here, we develop a novel form of DM that not only integrates evidence optimally over time but also across different sensory cues, providing an optimal decision model for multisensory integration in a reaction-time context. The model is capable of combining cues optimally even when the reliability of each sensory input varies as a function of time. We show that this model reproduces human subjects' behavior very well, thus demonstrating that subjects near-optimally combine momentary evidence across sensory modalities. The model also predicts the counterintuitive finding that discrimination thresholds are often increased during cue combination, and demonstrates that this departure from standard cue-integration theory is due to a speed-accuracy tradeoff."

Short reaction times imply that subjects gather less information to make a decision, yielding greater discrimination thresholds. Longer reaction times may decrease thresholds, but at the cost of time. Consequently, if subjects decide more rapidly in the combined condition than the visual condition, they might feature higher discrimination thresholds in the combined condition even if they make optimal use of all available information. Thus, to assess if subjects perform optimal cue combination, we need to account for the timing of their decisions."

In general, reaction times were faster for larger heading magnitudes, and reaction times in the vestibular condition were faster than those in the visual condition (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> for subject D2, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a> for other subjects). In the combined condition, however, reaction times were much shorter than those seen for the visual condition and were comparable to those of the vestibular condition (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). Thus, subjects spent substantially more time integrating evidence in the visual condition, which boosted their discrimination performance when compared to the combined condition. Note also that discrimination thresholds in the combined condition were substantially smaller than vestibular thresholds, especially at 70% coherence (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2 and 3</a>). Thus, adding optic flow to a vestibular stimulus decreased the discrimination threshold with essentially no loss of speed. A similar overall pattern of results was observed for the other subjects (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). These data provide clear evidence that subjects made use of both visual and vestibular information to perform the reaction-time task, but the benefits of cue integration could not be appreciated by considering discrimination thresholds alone."

Additionally, DMs are known to optimally integrate evidence over time (<a href=\"#bib28\">Laming, 1968</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bogacz et al., 2006</a>), given that the reliability of the evidence is time-invariant (such that, at any point in time from stimulus onset, the stimulus provides the same amount of information about the task variable). However, DMs have neither been used to integrate evidence from several sources, nor to handle evidence whose reliability changes over time, both of which are required for our purposes."

We assumed that heading is represented by a neural population code in which neurons have heading tuning curves that, within the range of heading tested in this experiment (\u00b116\u00b0, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>), differ in their heading preferences but have similar shapes.

For low coherence, motion energy in the stimulus is almost uniform for all heading directions, such that all neurons in the population fire at approximately the same rate (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, dark blue curve).

As the latter can vary between different modalities, we allowed it to differ between visual, vestibular, and combined conditions, but not for different coherences, thus introducing the model parameters <i>t</i><sub><i>nd</i>,<i>vis</i></sub>, <i>t</i><sub><i>nd</i>,<i>vest</i></sub>, and <i>t</i><sub><i>nd</i>,<i>comb</i></sub>. Although the fitted non-decision times were similar across stimulus conditions for most subjects (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), a model assuming a single non-decision time resulted in a small but significant decrease in fit quality (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). Overall, 12 parameters were used to model cue sensitivities, bounds, variances, and non-decision times in all conditions, and these 12 parameters were used to fit 312 data points for subjects that were tested with 6 coherences (168 data points for the three-coherence version). An additional 14 parameters (8 parameters for the three-coherence version; one bias parameter per coherence/condition, one lapse parameter across all condition) controlled for biases in the motion direction percept and for lapses of attention that were assumed to lead to random choices (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019). Although these additional parameters were necessary to achieve good model fits (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>), it is critical to note that they could not account for differences in heading thresholds or reaction times across stimulus conditions. As such, the additional parameters play no role in determining whether subjects perform optimal multisensory integration. Alternative parameterizations of how drift rates and bounds depend on motion coherence yielded qualitatively similar results, but caused the model fits to worsen decisively (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>; <a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>)."

Assuming that the weighting of both modalities followed the velocity profile of the stimulus also decisively reduced fit quality (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>, \u2018weighting by velocity\u2019), although this effect was not consistent across subjects (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>).

The parallel race model (<a href=\"#bib38\">Raab, 1962</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Miller, 1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Townsend and Wenger, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Otto and Mamassian, 2012</a>) postulates that the decision in the combined condition emerges from the faster of two independent races toward a bound, one for each sensory modality. Because it does not combine information across modalities, the parallel race model predicts that decisions in the combined condition are caused by the faster modality. Consequently, choices in the combined condition are unlikely to be more correct (on average) than those of the faster unimodal condition. For all but one subject, the vestibular modality is substantially faster, even when compared to the visual modality at high coherence and controlling for the effect of heading direction (2-way ANOVA, p&lt;0.0001 for all subjects except C). Critically, all of these subjects feature significantly lower psychophysical thresholds in the combined condition than in the vestibular condition (p&lt;0.039 for all subjects except subject C, p=0.210, <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2A</a>). Furthermore, we performed standard tests (Miller's bound and Grice's bound) that compare the observed distribution of reaction times with that predicted by the parallel race model (<a href=\"#bib32\">Miller, 1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Grice et al., 1984</a>). These tests revealed that all but two subjects made significantly slower decisions than predicted by the parallel race model for most coherence/heading combinations (p&lt;0.05 for all subjects except subjects F and B2; <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2B</a>), and no subject was faster than predicted (p&gt;0.05, all subjects; <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2B</a>).

Particularly, they feature worse discrimination performance (higher psychophysical thresholds) in the combined condition than would be predicted from the unimodal conditions\u2014in some cases even worse than the better of the two unimodal conditions. This occurs because subjects tend to decide more quickly in the combined condition than in the more sensitive unimodal condition and thus have less time to accumulate evidence. This indicates that a more general definition of optimal cue integration must incorporate reaction times. Indeed, subjects' behavior could be reproduced by an extended diffusion model that takes into account both speed and accuracy, thus suggesting that subjects accumulate evidence across both time and cues in a statistically near-optimal manner (i.e., with minimal information loss) despite their reduced discrimination performance in the combined condition."

Moreover, previous work relied on the implicit assumption that subjects make use of all evidence throughout the duration of the stimulus. However, this assumption need not be true and has been shown to be violated even for short presentation durations (<a href=\"#bib31\">Mazurek et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Kiani et al., 2008</a>). Therefore, apparent sub-optimality in some previous studies of cue integration or in some individual subjects (<a href=\"#bib1\">Battaglia et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Fetsch et al., 2009</a>) might be attributable to either truly sub-optimal cue combination, to subjects halting evidence accumulation before the end of the stimulus presentation period, or to the difficulty in estimating stimulus processing time (<a href=\"#bib43\">Stanford et al., 2010</a>). Unfortunately, these potential causes cannot be distinguished using a fixed-duration task. Allowing subjects to register their decisions at any time during the trial alleviates this potential confound."

In the multisensory context, this raises the question of whether evidence accumulation is bounded for each modality separately, as assumed by the parallel race model, or whether evidence is combined across modalities before being accumulated toward a single bound, as in co-activation models and our modified diffusion model. Based on our behavioral data, we can rule out parallel race models, as they cannot explain lower psychophysical thresholds (better sensitivity) in the combined condition relative to the faster vestibular condition. Further evidence against such models is provided by neurophysiological studies which demonstrate that visual and vestibular cues to heading converge in various cortical areas, including areas MSTd (<a href=\"#bib23\">Gu et al., 2006</a>), VIP (<a href=\"#bib41\">Schlack et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Chen et al., 2011b</a>), and VPS (<a href=\"#bib6\">Chen et al., 2011a</a>). Activity in area MSTd can account for sensitivity-based cue weighting in a fixed-duration task (<a href=\"#bib13\">Fetsch et al., 2011</a>), and MSTd activity is causally related to multi-modal heading judgments (<a href=\"#bib4\">Britten and van Wezel, 1998</a>, <a href=\"#bib5\">2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Gu et al., 2012</a>).

However, it differs from these models in important aspects. First, co-activation models have been introduced to explain reaction times that are faster than those predicted by parallel race models (<a href=\"#bib38\">Raab, 1962</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Miller, 1982</a>). Our subjects, in contrast, feature reaction times that are slower than those of parallel race models in almost all conditions (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2B</a>). We capture this effect by an elevated effective bound in the combined condition as compared to the faster vestibular condition, such that cue combination remains optimal despite longer reaction times. Second, co-activation models usually combine inputs from the different modalities by a simple sum (e.g., <a href=\"#bib46\">Townsend and Wenger, 2004</a>). This entails adding noise to the combined signal if the sensitivity to one of the modalities is low, which is detrimental to discrimination performance. In contrast, we show that different cues need to be weighted according to their sensitivities to achieve statistically optimally integration of multisensory evidence at each moment in time (<a href=\"#equ2\">Equation 2</a>)."

For the vestibular modality, we assume that the temporal profile of sensitivity to the evidence follows acceleration. This may appear to conflict with data from multimodal areas MSTd, VIP, and VPS, where neural activity in response to self-motion reflects a mixture of velocity and acceleration components (<a href=\"#bib14\">Fetsch et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Chen et al., 2011a</a>). Note, however, that the vestibular stimulus is initially encoded by otolith afferents in terms of acceleration (<a href=\"#bib12\">Fernandez and Goldberg, 1976</a>). Thus, any neural representation of vestibular stimuli in terms of velocity requires a temporal integration of the acceleration signal, and this integration introduces temporal correlations into the signal. As a consequence, a neural response that is maximal at the time of peak stimulus velocity does not imply a simultaneous peak in the information coded about heading direction. Rather, information still follows the time course of its original encoding, which is in terms of acceleration. In contrast, the time course of the sensitivity to the visual stimulus is less clear. For our model we have intuitively assumed it to follow the velocity profile of the stimulus, as information per unit time about heading certainly increases with the velocity of the optic flow field, even when there is no acceleration. This assumption is supported by a decisively worse model fit if we set the weighting of the visual momentary evidence to follow the acceleration profile (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>, \u2018weighted by acceleration\u2019). Nonetheless, we cannot completely exclude any contribution of acceleration components to visual information (<a href=\"#bib29\">Lisberger and Movshon, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Price et al., 2005</a>). In any case, our model fits make clear that temporal weighting of vestibular and visual inputs is necessary to predict behavior when stimuli are time-varying."

Thus, for our task, it is reasonable to assume that subjects can estimate their sensitivity to cues. We have recently begun to consider how sensitivity estimation and cue integration can be implemented neurally. The neural model (<a href=\"#bib50\">Onken et al., 2012</a>. Near optimal multisensory integration with nonlinear probabilistic population codes using divisive normalization. The Society for Neuroscience annual meeting 2012) estimates the sensitivity to the visual input from motion sensitive neurons and uses this estimate to perform near-optimal multisensory integration with generalized probabilistic population codes (<a href=\"#bib30\">Ma et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Beck et al., 2008</a>) using divisive normalization.

These findings, and the extended diffusion model that we have developed, provide the foundation for building a general understanding of perceptual decision-making under more natural conditions in which multiple cues vary dynamically over time and subjects make rapid decisions when they have acquired sufficient evidence."

A 3-chip DLP projector (Galaxy 6; Barco, Kortrijk, Belgium) was mounted on the motion platform behind the subject and front-projected images onto a large (149 \u00d7 127 cm) projection screen via a mirror mounted above the subject\u2019s head.

Confidence intervals for threshold estimates were obtained by taking 5000 parametric bootstrap samples (<a href=\"#bib49\">Wichmann and Hill, 2001</a>).

We never averaged data across subjects as they feature qualitatively different behavior, due to different speed-accuracy tradeoffs. Furthermore, for subjects performing both the three-coherence and the six-coherence version of the experiment, we treated either version as a separate data set. For each modality/coherence combination (7 combinations for 3 coherences, 13 combinations for 6 coherences) we fitted one bias parameter that prevents behavioral biases from influencing model fits. The fact that performance of subjects often fails to reach 100% correct even for the highest coherences and largest heading angles was modeled by a lapse rate, which describes the frequency with which the subject makes a random choice rather than one based on accumulated evidence. This lapse rate was assumed to be independent of stimulus modality or coherence, and so a single lapse rate parameter is shared among all modality/coherence combinations."

Model predictions for choice fractions and reaction times for correct and incorrect choices were computed from the solution to integral equations describing first-passage times of bounded diffusion processes (<a href=\"#bib42\">Smith, 2000</a>).

First, we found a (possibly local) maximum by pseudo-gradient ascent on the likelihood function. Starting from this maximum, we used a Markov Chain Monte Carlo procedure to draw 44,000 samples from the parameter posterior under the assumption of a uniform, bounded prior. After this, we used the highest-likelihood sample, which is expected to be close to the mode of this posterior, as a starting point to find the posterior mode by pseudo-gradient ascent. The resulting parameter vector is taken as the maximum-likelihood estimate. All pseudo-gradient ascent maximizations were performed with the Optimization Toolbox of Matlab R2013a (Mathworks), using stringent stopping criteria (TolFun = TolX = 10<sup>\u221220</sup>) to prevent premature convergence."

Unlike tasks that have fixed information delivery times, the behavioral thresholds in the combined task, in the present study, are not better than both of the individual thresholds. The reason for this is that subjects terminate evidence accumulation more quickly in the combined condition. The authors develop a model which incorporates time-varying evidence across both cues up to the reaction time (minus baseline stimulus-response processing) and they show that this model accurately characterizes reaction times and accuracy. They also show that the subjects approximately optimally integrate evidence."

The behavior has been carefully carried out, the data analysis is detailed and thorough, and the modeling provides and important insight into the behavioral process. I think both the experimental data and the modeling insights are quite compelling and novel. On one hand, multisensory experiments have become quite popular, and performance improvements have been amply documented both in terms of reaction times and of response accuracy. But in retrospect it seems rather surprising that multisensory enhancement has not been studied for the more natural, simultaneous condition in which both time and accuracy are in play. This work not only fills in this gap, but also presents results that may seem quite paradoxical when RT and accuracy are analyzed separately from each other. Surprisingly, the combined condition does not produce better (i.e., more accurate) performance, as one may have thought based on previous results, but mostly faster performance."

The model may not be the ultimate one \u2013 it is rather abstract and provides little mechanistic intuition about the underlying neuronal coding schemes and circuit interactions \u2013 but it does serve its purpose at this point, which is to prove a quantitative statistical benchmark for measuring the effectiveness of those underlying neural interactions, as well as a framework for testing and generating hypotheses. The generalization to two evidence streams, rather than one, and to a time-dependent reliability of the sensory evidence is a clever and useful theoretical advance, and it describes the data quite well."
