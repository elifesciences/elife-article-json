The inner hair cells (IHCs) are the primary sensory receptors adapted for rapid auditory signalling, but they are not thought to be intrinsically tuned to encode particular sound frequencies. Here I found that under experimental conditions mimicking those <i>in vivo</i>, mammalian IHCs are intrinsically specialized. Low frequency gerbil IHCs (~0.3 kHz) have significantly more depolarised resting membrane potentials, faster kinetics and shorter membrane time constants than high-frequency cells (~30 kHz). The faster kinetics of low-frequency IHCs allow them to follow the phasic component of sound (frequency-following), which is not required for high-frequency cells that are instead optimally configured to encode sustained, graded responses (intensity-following). The intrinsic membrane filtering of IHCs ensures accurate encoding of the phasic or sustained components of the cell's <i>in vivo</i> receptor potential, crucial for sound localisation and ultimately survival."
