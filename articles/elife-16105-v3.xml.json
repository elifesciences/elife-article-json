The methods, denoted cascade MDFF and resolution exchange MDFF, sequentially re-refine a search model against a series of maps of progressively higher resolutions, which ends with the original experimental resolution. Application of sequential re-refinement enables MDFF to achieve a radius of convergence of ~25 \u00c5 demonstrated with the accurate modeling of \u03b2-galactosidase and TRPV1 proteins at 3.2 \u00c5 and 3.4 \u00c5 resolution, respectively. The MDFF refinements uniquely offer map-model validation and B-factor determination criteria based on the inherent dynamics of the macromolecules studied, captured by means of local root mean square fluctuations. The MDFF tools described are available to researchers through an easy-to-use and cost-effective cloud computing resource on Amazon Web Services."

The methods, denoted cascade MDFF and resolution exchange MDFF, sequentially re-refine a search model against a series of maps of progressively higher resolutions, which ends with the original experimental resolution. Application of sequential re-refinement enables MDFF to achieve a radius of convergence of ~25 \u00c5 demonstrated with the accurate modeling of \u03b2-galactosidase and TRPV1 proteins at 3.2 \u00c5 and 3.4 \u00c5 resolution, respectively. The MDFF refinements uniquely offer map-model validation and B-factor determination criteria based on the inherent dynamics of the macromolecules studied, captured by means of local root mean square fluctuations. The MDFF tools described are available to researchers through an easy-to-use and cost-effective cloud computing resource on Amazon Web Services."

These methods, denoted cascade MDFF (cMDFF) and resolution exchange MDFF (ReMDFF), augment the traditional MDFF method (<a href=\"#bib71\">Trabuco et al., 2008</a>, <a href=\"#bib72\">2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">McGreevy et al., 2016</a>) (called direct MDFF henceforth) with enhanced conformational sampling techniques, namely simulated annealing (<a href=\"#bib10\">Br\u00fcnger, 1988</a>) and replica exchange molecular dynamics (<a href=\"#bib65\">Sugita and Okamoto, 1999</a>). The central idea behind the techniques introduced is to fit a search model sequentially to a series of maps of progressively higher resolutions, ending with the original experimental resolution; all but the last in the series are computationally blurred lower-resolution derivatives of the original map, so that larger-scale features of the structure are determined first by fitting to the blurred densities, and smaller-scale refinements are performed subsequently during the fitting to higher-resolution densities. Altogether, this treatment enables a richer conformational sampling of the model within the map than direct MDFF, thereby\u00a0allowing accurate modeling of the global and local structural features from the map; a similar treatment has previously been employed to increase the radius of convergence of MDFF protocols, but with crystallographic data (<a href=\"#bib61\">Singharoy et al., 2015</a>)."

The two methods were found to resolve atomic structures with accuracy greater than that of direct MDFF and comparable to that of Rosetta, even with poor choices of search models. The accuracy is evaluated in terms of the quality of fit measured through global and local cross-correlations (GCC and LCC), integrated Fourier shell coefficients (iFSC), and EMRinger scores (<a href=\"#bib4\">Barad et al., 2015</a>), as well as in terms of the quality of structural integrity measures like MolProbity (<a href=\"#bib12\">Chen et al., 2010</a>)."

In line with this new finding, RMSF values are shown to provide a physical basis for the determination of optimal sharpening B-factors that maximize the signal-to-noise ratio within a map. These B-factors are determined at three different levels of model description: whole-system, per-domain, and per-residue."

                                        "text": "Summarized in <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>, the fitting results, in terms of quality of fit as well as model quality, are significantly better for cMDFF and ReMDFF than for direct MDFF: (<b>i</b>) RMSD of the fitted structure with respect to the reported de novo model is 0.7\u2009\u00c5 and 0.9\u2009\u00c5 for cMDFF and ReMDFF respectively, much lower than the 3.7\u2009\u00c5 RMSD attained with direct MDFF (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3a</a>); (<b>ii</b>) EMRinger scores for cMDFF and ReMDFF are 3.16 and 3.45 respectively, higher than the 1.91 obtained for direct MDFF, implying accurate fitting of sidechains into the density; (<b>iii</b>) MolProbity scores are consistently small for all the flexible fitting techniques in part due to fewer, less severe steric clashes and fewer Ramachandran outliers (further detailed in <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>); (<b>iv</b>) integrated FSC (iFSC2, corresponding to the range 3.4\u201310\u2009\u00c5 on the FSC plot obtained as per Appendix 1 - Section 6), considered a more stringent measure of model quality than CC (<a href=\"#bib18\">DiMaio et al., 2015</a>), attained higher values of 5.22\u2009\u00c5 and 4.66\u2009\u00c5 for cMDFF and ReMDFF, respectively, than 2.74\u2009\u00c5 for direct MDFF. iFSC1, evaluated at the lower resolution range of 5\u201310\u2009\u00c5 improves from 2.11\u2009\u00c5 for direct MDFF to 4.22\u2009\u00c5 and 3.76\u2009\u00c5 for cMDFF and ReMDFF, respectively, showing a trend similar to that of iFSC2 corresponding to the high-resolution range; and (<b>v</b>) GCCs improved from an initial value of 0.48 to 0.56, 0.67 and 0.67 for direct, cMDFF, and ReMDFF protocols respectively. Similarly, typical residue LCC values improved from about 0 to greater than 0.80 (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4a</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s5\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). Overall, cMDFF and ReMDFF refinements produce structures that interpret the 3.2-\u00c5 \u03b2-galactosidase map much more accurately than direct MDFF does. <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a</a> shows, visually, how the cMDFF-derived structure differs from the direct MDFF structure in terms of fit. In judging the RMSD values to the target model the reader is reminded that equilibrium MD simulations of a single structure at room temperature typically exhibit RMSD values relative to the initial structure or the average structure of about 3\u2009\u00c5; the same is true for \u03b2-galactosidase (see <a href=\"#fig2s6\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 6</a> in Appendix 1 - Section 7). Consequently, an RMSD of 0.7\u2009\u00c5 of the cMDFF/ReMDFF-fitted model relative to the target implies a high-quality refinement. The high quality of this refinement is further supported by visualizations of accurate sidechain placements within the density, shown in <a href=\"#fig2s7\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 7</a>."

Surprisingly, large scale map-model validation measures, such as RMSD, GCC, or iFSC values, remain insensitive to such local discrepancies in the refined model.

In light of the initial model quality dependence of MDFF, it is advisable to begin refinement with an initial model of maximal secondary structure information, yet with minimal tertiary structure. Dependable initial secondary structure is also required since MD simulations have limited capability of recovering the structure of a protein fold if the search model begins with a random coil conformation (<a href=\"#bib22\">Freddolino et al., 2010</a>). To this end, notwithstanding observed cMDFF improvements of the secondary structure (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a> columns 4 vs. 6, and also demonstrated for \u03b3-secretase [<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1D</a>]), moderate- to high-confidence homology models will serve as the most optimal starting point, as has been successfully shown for MDFF with low-resolution EM (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chan et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Noble et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Wickles et al., 2014</a>) and crystallographic data (<a href=\"#bib47\">McGreevy et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Li et al., 2014</a>). Quantitatively speaking, employing the current example (\u03b2-galactosidase) and the following one (TRPV1), it is now shown that a search model which deviates from the target by an RMSD of 7\u201325\u2009\u00c5 featuring Ramachandran outliers of ~3%, poor rotamers of 11\u201338%, overall Molprobity score of ~4 and EMRinger score of ~0.20 can be accurately refined against a sub-5\u2009\u00c5 EM map with cMDFF or ReMDFF."

The search model was prepared from the reported de novo structure through an interactive MD protocol described in Appendix 1 - Section 3.

To observe the effect of MDFF on a substantially well-fitted initial structure, a direct MDFF simulation was also performed to refine the de novo structure within the reported map. The simulation yielded a structure that was comparable in all the quality measures considered to the structures obtained from cMDFF and ReMDFF (Appendix 1 - Section 8).

Also, since the number of Ramachandran outliers were minimal in both the 25\u2009\u00c5-deviated and de novo initial models, the cMDFF, ReMDFF, and direct MDFF-refined models exhibited low percentages of Ramachandran outliers, as reflected in <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1B</a>."

Conventionally, however, only a single model representing a best fit to the map is reported. One may ask how statistically representative a single model can be. To quantify the deviation of a fitted model from the rest of an ensemble of simulated molecules, root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) of the model relative to the ensemble-averaged structure was computed during an MDFF refinement simulation employing the protocol described in Methods. In the following, the RMSF of a fitted model is first shown to be indicative of the quality of fit of the model, as well as to represent the degree of natural conformational variation exhibited within the thermodynamic ensemble underlying the map. Second, the RMSF values are found to correlate both locally and globally with the resolution of an EM map, providing an interpretation of map quality based on the inherent (i.e., natural) dynamics of the macromolecule under observation. Finally, RMSF values are also employed to identify optimal B-factor values for the sharpening of a map.

The initial conformation is a poor fit of the map, characterized by low values of GCC, LCC, and iFSC (the row containing \u2018initial\u2019 structure in <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Such conformations belong to a diverse ensemble of poorly fit structures, explored by the search model in the early phase of the fitting, that gives rise to high initial RMSF values shown in <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>. In the ending phase of the refinement, well-fitted structures are obtained with improved GCC, LCC, and iFSC (cMDFF row of <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Owing to the high resolution (3.2\u2009\u00c5) of the EM density map, the population of these well-fitted structures is much smaller than that of partially-fitted structures. Thus, as can be observed in <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, the converged ensemble of the well-fitted structures exhibit much smaller fluctuations than the initial one.

The numbers of atoms in the resolution bins are displayed as a histogram (in red) spanning a system-specific range of resolutions. The lowest resolution bins contained low (&lt;20) populations and visual inspection consistently revealed the atoms to be on the edges of the density or were otherwise located inside map noise, and were therefore ignored during further analysis. A clear linear correlation between RMSF and local resolution can be found in each case, such that applying a linear fit produces the high <math id=\"inf24\"><msup><mi>R</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></math> value shown in each graph heading. Also displayed in each heading is an overall RMSF, averaged over all atoms in the system. The overall RMSF reflects the conformational variety of structures that fit within the map, and is found to correspond to the map resolution such that higher resolutions produce lower RMSFs. The second row of plots show that the RMSF during MDFF simulation also linearly correlates with RMSF during unbiased MD simulations of (<b>e</b>) \u03b2-gal, (<b>f</b>) TRPV1 and (<b>g</b>,<b>h</b>) \u03b3-sec, establishing that fluctuations during MDFF reflect the inherent flexibility of a system."

Noting that the RMSF value during unbiased MD simulations reflects flexibility (<a href=\"#bib31\">Karplus, 1990</a>), this linear correlation clearly establishes the dependence of RMSF during MDFF refinement on the inherent flexibility of the macromolecule, at least for our four demonstration systems (see Appendix 1 - Section 2 for MD simulation details). Since the flexibility of a molecule during the imaging process contributes to the limiting resolution of the resulting EM density map (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kucukelbir et al., 2014</a>), it is not surprising that overall and local map resolutions correlate with overall and local RMSF values of the best fitted model (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>)."

The added value of RMSF is particularly evident on the local level, where the other measures may not perform as consistently. For example, a high LCC may be the result of a highly flexible structure fitting to a low-resolution region of the map, and not necessarily of a good representation of the local structure. As a result, although multiple low-resolution regions of the model in <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2a</a> possess similar LCCs, disparate RMSFs of the same regions clearly indicate differences in local quality of the model. Likewise, EMRinger scoring, when applied to small groups of residues, does not correlate with local resolution (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2b</a>), and, therefore, is incapable of distinguishing regions of small number of atoms by local model quality. In contrast, RMSF clearly resolves local resolution, and, thus, resolves the map and model quality even with as few as 100 atoms."

An initial decrease in the RMSF values is observed with increase in B-factor sharpening of the map. However, the RMSF eventually reaches a minimum before increasing as the B-factor is further increased. Surprisingly, for all the three structures the B-factor corresponding to the minimum RMSF coincides with the one determined by Guinier analysis (<a href=\"#bib19\">Fern\u00e1ndez et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Rosenthal and Henderson, 2003</a>) to provide maximum contrast. In fact, for TRPV1, B-factors determined from the RMSF minima are found to be higher for the soluble regions than for the transmembrane helices (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, b vs. c), again, in agreement with those B-factors derived from the Guinier analysis. Therefore, the RMSF analysis of maps with varying B-factor sharpening provides an alternate procedure for the determination of the optimal B-factor, which has been traditionally determined by Guinier analysis."

This relationship indeed implies that the smaller the average atomic fluctuations, the lower are the B-factors, and by definition (<a href=\"#bib43\">Liu and Xiong, 2014</a>) the higher are the measured structure factor amplitudes, and hence the contrast, of the resulting map in both crystallographic and EM experiments (<a href=\"#bib43\">Liu and Xiong, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Fern\u00e1ndez et al., 2008</a>). By analogy, RMSF within MDFF is a measure of these average atomic fluctuations under the experimental setting (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, bottom row) and, therefore, within a set of maps of varying B-factors, the highest contrast is indicated by the lowest RMSF obtained during fitting of a model. Since Guinier analysis of EM data selects B-factors based on the same atomic displacement-structure factor relationship that justifies the RMSF-based selection of B-factors (<a href=\"#bib55\">Rosenthal and Henderson, 2003</a>), the B-factor selected from our analysis of the lowest RMSF matches excellently with those from the Guinier analysis of EM maps."

These scores indicate clearly that the models derived from maps at B-factor sharpening of \u221250 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5a</a>), \u2212100 (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3b</a>), and \u2212100 (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1a</a>) are more accurate than those derived from the unsharpened ones. Indeed, as further illustrated in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5a</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3b</a>,\u00a0and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, the maximum EMRinger score is attained for the same B-factor that produces the minimum RMSF. Sharpening by B-factors of magnitudes any higher than 50 for \u03b2-galactosidase, and 100 for \u03b3-secretase or TRPV1 damages key density features thus reducing the quality of the associated fitted models. In addition, correlation of the RMSF of the fitted structure with that from an unbiased MD of the system is still preserved (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5b</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2b</a>) for the B-factor sharpened map, confirming that the dynamical fluctuations of the structure within the sharpened map reflects the inherent dynamics of the system. Altogether, RMSF establishes a unique map-model validation criterion that represents an ensemble view of the fitted structures, while also preventing over-sharpening of the EM maps."

Using a mask around specific regions of interest, estimation of local B-factors for different parts of a map is also possible. However, this method is limited to large domains of macromolecular complexes due to problems associated with tight masking of cryo-EM maps. For maps with resolutions better than ~3\u2009\u00c5, local B-factors could be estimated and refined in X-ray crystallography programs. However, most highresolution cryo-EM maps have resolutions between 3 to 5\u2009\u00c5 (<a href=\"#bib41\">Liao et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bartesaghi et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Zhao et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Fischer et al., 2015</a>). In this resolution range, B-factors could be estimated from MDFF and used as prior information to improve model building and refinement. For resolutions better than 3\u2009\u00c5, MDFF-derived values may serve as initial estimates of B-factors. Furthermore, many cryo-EM maps show local variations in resolution, complicating the model building process. A possible solution may be to combine local B-factor refinement for highresolution regions of a map and B-factors derived from MDFF for lower resolution regions.

The test system converges to the known target structure in approximately 0.1 ns simulation time. The time to convergence requires very little wall clock time, and, therefore, incurs a small monetary cost to a user (<a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>). However, it should be noted that human error and varying experience level can easily add to the incurred cost of cloud usage. Some systems may require multiple simulations to achieve a high quality structure and, therefore, additional time beyond the example discussed here. Furthermore, preparing a structure for simulation may require additional time and resources over the purely simulation-oriented results presented here. The files and information necessary to run ReMDFF on the test system using EC2 cloud computing resources are available at (<a href=\"http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/cloud/\">http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/cloud/</a>).

Furthermore, utilizing the fact that the inherent flexibility of a macromolecule is a key determinant of the achievable resolution of the corresponding map, RMSF values have been employed to identify the optimal amount of sharpening for a given map offering the highest contrast, as established typically through Guinier analysis. The RMSF computations in MDFF provide a viable means of determining per-residue B-factors."

The sub-5\u2009\u00c5 EM maps have also been able to resolve proteins in multiple conformations (<a href=\"#bib46\">Matthies et al., 2016</a>). Both these type of maps will continue to benefit from accurate ensemble-based flexible fitting techniques for the foreseeable future. MDFF provides a natural method to model flexible regions; de novo models constructed for one conformational state can be flexibley fitted into the density of the other state(s), thus avoiding the arduous task of model construction for all the conformational states for capturing a conformational transition process with cryo-EM."

Prior to simulation, MDFF-specific parameters can be modified and include <math id=\"inf37\"><mi>\u03b6</mi></math> and the subset of atoms to be coupled to the MDFF potential. The latter typically consists of all non-hydrogen atoms or backbone atoms and <math id=\"inf38\"><mi>\u03b6</mi></math> is usually set to 0.3. MDFF can be performed in various simulated conditions, including different temperatures and vacuum, membrane, and\u00a0explicit or implicit (<a href=\"#bib68\">Tanner et al., 2011</a>) solvent environments. The choice of parameters and conditions depends on the requirements of each specific case. For example, a highly polar molecule would be more accurately simulated in explicit solvent rather than in vacuum, but the computational cost would be much higher in this case. The MDFF simulation is run until the system has reached stationarity, as determined by RMSD; typical run times are nanoseconds."

Original published maps of resolutions 3.2\u2009\u00c5 and 3.4\u2009\u00c5 for \u03b2-galactosidase (EMD-5995 [<a href=\"#bib5\">Bartesaghi et al., 2014</a>]) and TRPV1 (EMD-5778 [<a href=\"#bib41\">Liao et al., 2013</a>]), respectively, were fitted with search models characterized by RMSD values of 7\u2009\u00c5 and 25\u2009\u00c5, respectively, relative to the known de novo target models (PDB entries 3J7H and 3J5P, respectively); these search models were prepared as described in Appendix 1 - Section 3. Scale factors <math id=\"inf93\"><mi>\u03b6</mi></math> (<a href=\"#equ1\">Equation 1</a>) of values 1.0 and 0.3 were employed for \u03b2-galactosidase and TRPV1, respectively, to couple all the heavy atoms of the models to the respective maps. All other simulation parameters are noted in Appendix 1 - Section 2. The resulting structure from each MDFF simulation was then subjected to a final re-refinement applying a scaling factor of 1.0. Furthermore, the temperature was ramped down from 300\u2009K to 0\u2009K over 30 ps and held at 0\u2009K for an additional 1 ns. This re-refinement step additionally improved the fitting of sidechains (<a href=\"#bib47\">McGreevy et al., 2014</a>). Thus, all the MDFF results reported in the present study pertain to the structures that are obtained from direct MDFF, cMDFF, or ReMDFF simulations followed by the final re-refinement step."

Next, MDFF simulation runs were sequentially performed, starting with the map of the lowest resolution, progressing through maps of successively higher resolution, and ending with the original map. Each run was chosen to be long enough for the structure to equilibrate within the MDFF potential. Taking advantage of the stochastic nature of MDFF simulations, multiple independent cMDFF simulations (10 in the present study) were performed for each system to be fitted, generating an ensemble of fitted structures. From the ensemble, the best structure was determined by the various quality indicators described in Results.

First, the local resolution map output by ResMap is loaded into VMD and then the <i>interpvol</i> keyword can be used to automatically select the atoms found inside the volume values specified, using interpolation. The average RMSF of each selection can then be calculated for a structure during the steps of a MDFF simulation after the initial fitting has occured and the structure has stabilized. In principle any criteria for atom selection can be used for RMSF analysis, though we use local resolution of the EM density here to illustrate the correlation between the two measurements.

However, these advanced simulation techniques come with an added complexity in the setup and execution of the methods. The current implementation of these methods in NAMD (<a href=\"#bib54\">Phillips et al., 2005</a>) and VMD (<a href=\"#bib27\">Humphrey et al., 1996</a>) aim to automate the steps previously discussed. The MDFF Graphical User Interface (GUI) (<a href=\"#bib48\">McGreevy et al., 2016</a>) can be used to set up cMDFF and ReMDFF simulations and provides default parameters, including the number and extent of smoothed maps used for the fitting, with which to run. The parameters for the smoothed maps and number of steps used per map are set heuristically based on previous experience and represent an adequate initial starting point. The GUI automatically generates each of the smoothed maps and converts them to potentials for use in the ReMDFF simulation. All parameters can be tuned by a user to adapt the protocols to their specific system and preference. The GUI produces a series of NAMD configuration files and scripts used for running the simulation, as well sorting and visualizing the results in VMD.

The cloud computing model provides researchers with access to powerful computational equipment that would otherwise be too costly to procure, maintain, and administer on their own. A particular obstacle is that structural modeling often involves the use of different software suites, such as VMD (<a href=\"#bib27\">Humphrey et al., 1996</a>) for simulation preparation and Situs (<a href=\"#bib80\">Wriggers, 2010</a>) for initial rigid-body docking or VMD, NAMD (<a href=\"#bib54\">Phillips et al., 2005</a>), and Rosetta (<a href=\"#bib37\">Leaver-Fay et al., 2011</a>) for iterative refinement of models (<a href=\"#bib42\">Lindert and McCammon, 2015</a>).

In the following MD run, minimization was performed over 5000 steps and equilibration was performed for 3 ns, with protein backbone atoms held fixed. Finally, the entire system was equilibrated for a further 6.4 ns.

Additionally, the substantial ankyrin repeat region (residues 111 to 198) was removed because the corresponding density was missing from the map. For the purpose of testing the robustness of cMDFF and contrasting its performance with that of direct MDFF, the structure was distorted (see <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2b</a>) during an interactive MD (<a href=\"#bib62\">Stone et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Grayson et al., 2003</a>)\u00a0simulation, subjecting residues 199 to 430 in one subunit\u2019s extramembrane domain to a series of transformations, consisting roughly of a polar angle change of 15\u00b0 toward the cytoplasmic pole followed by an azimuthal rotation of 30\u00b0, so that the backbone RMSD of the transformed region was about 22 \u00c5 relative to the original structure."

All replicas can be monitored during the simulation and poorly fitted ones can be discarded by a user. It is also worth noting that the region of the TRPV1 map to which both cMDFF and ReMDFF successfully fitted the model, characterizes a diverse range of local resolutions from 4 \u00c5 to 6 \u00c5 challenging thus the conformational sampling capability of any flexible fitting technique. For the same reason, this region was avoided during Rosetta refinements of TRPV1 (<a href=\"#bib18\">DiMaio et al., 2015</a>)\u00a0but is addressed now via MDFF."

The first of these simulations was a direct MDFF simulation of the reported \u03b2-galactosidase structure, fitting only backbone atoms to the 3.2-\u00c5 map. The fitted structure was compared to the 'refined de novo' structure reported in Results. It was found that EMRinger scores were lower at 2.35 when only backbone atoms were fitted, compared to 4.23 when non-hydrogen atoms were fitted. This result suggests that even if the backbone is correctly placed, the MD force fields alone (i.e. CHARMM36 (<a href=\"#bib7\">Best et al., 2012</a>)\u00a0here) are incapable of providing sidechain geometries consistent with the map.

Subsequently, simulated maps were created from the fitted structures using VMD\u2019s MDFF plugin and resolution settings equivalent to the reported maps. In total, there were two simulated maps, also with labels 1 and 2 corresponding to the half-map from which the fits were obtained, for each protein. FSC plots describing the direct comparison of simulated maps with the corresponding half-maps (e.g. simulated map 1 with half-map 1) as well as the cross comparison of simulated maps with the non-corresponding half-maps (e.g. simulated map 1 with half-map 2) were created. <a href=\"#fig2s8\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 8</a> show the plots for \u03b2-galactosidase and TRPV1, respectively. The high degree of similarity between the cross comparisons as well as between cross comparisons and direct comparisons indicate a very low degree of over-fitting. In fact, iFSC values calculated for the plots (see Figures) are practically uniform. EMRinger scores for the same sets of comparisons were also calculated. For \u03b2-galactosidase, the EMRinger scores were 3.25 for simulated map 1 against half-map 1, 2.97 for simulated map 2 against half-map 2, 2.92 for simulated map 1 against half-map 2, and 2.81 for simulated map 2 against half-map 1; these numbers are fairly comparable to the EMRinger scores with the full maps as presented in <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>. For TRPV1 again, the EMRinger scores were 1.43 for all comparisons. The high degree of similarity between EMRinger scores for the different comparisons corroborates the favorable conclusion drawn from the FSC calculations."

However, in practice the applications of their method may be somewhat limited since either (a) the EM map is near atomic resolution (3.5 A or better) allowing ab initio tracing, or (b) the map is lower resolution in which case higher resolution structures of fragments are generally needed in order to have confidence in the final model. The new method is probably most useful in the resolution range 4-7 A where ab initio fitting to the maps is not possible and when high-resolution structures are available of all components, but these components undergo large conformational changes."

An EM map is a manifestation of this distribution of structures, more so because unlike crystallography, it captures the biomolecules in a native- like environment. Consequently, reporting a single structure does not suffice to elucidate the conformational diversity that the full distribution of functionally relevant structures manifest. We report an ensemble of 12 structures that represent the conformational diversity of \u03b2-galactosidase (Figure 5\u2014source data 1).

However, this method is limited to large domains of macromolecular complexes due to problems associated with tight masking of cryo-EM maps. For maps with resolutions better than ~3 \u00c5, local B-factors could be estimated and refined in X-ray crystallography programs. However, most high-resolution cryo-EM maps have resolutions between ~3 to 5 \u00c5. In this resolution range, B- factors could be estimated from MDFF and used as prior information to improve model building and refinement. For resolutions better than ~3 \u00c5, MDFF-derived values may serve as initial estimates of B-factors to be further refined by crystallography programs.

Additionally, many of the reference choices seem unnecessary. For example, in the first paragraph of the Introduction, describing how cryo-EM has evolved, the authors cite papers on NMR methods for complexes over 20 kDa (Clore and Gronenborn), membrane proteins by XFEL (Neutze et al) and ribosome structures at mid-resolution (the papers by Rawat et al).
