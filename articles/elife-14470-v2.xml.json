                    "text": "Mutations in <i>PROP1</i> are the most common cause of hypopituitarism in humans; therefore, unraveling its mechanism of action is highly relevant from a therapeutic perspective. Our current understanding of the role of PROP1 in the pituitary gland is limited to the repression and activation of the pituitary transcription factor genes <i>Hesx1</i> and <i>Pou1f1,</i> respectively. To elucidate the comprehensive PROP1-dependent gene regulatory network, we conducted genome-wide analysis of PROP1 DNA binding and effects on gene expression in mutant mice, mouse isolated stem cells and engineered mouse cell lines. We determined that PROP1 is essential for stimulating stem cells to undergo an epithelial to mesenchymal transition-like process necessary for cell migration and differentiation. Genomic profiling reveals that PROP1 binds to genes expressed in epithelial cells like C<i>laudin 23,</i> and to EMT inducer genes like <i>Zeb2, Notch2</i> and <i>Gli2. Zeb2</i> activation appears to be a key step in the EMT process. Our findings identify PROP1 as a central transcriptional component of pituitary stem cell differentiation."

Our current understanding of the role of PROP1 in the pituitary gland is limited to the repression and activation of the pituitary transcription factor genes <i>Hesx1</i> and <i>Pou1f1,</i> respectively. To elucidate the comprehensive PROP1-dependent gene regulatory network, we conducted genome-wide analysis of PROP1 DNA binding and effects on gene expression in mutant mice, mouse isolated stem cells and engineered mouse cell lines. We determined that PROP1 is essential for stimulating stem cells to undergo an epithelial to mesenchymal transition-like process necessary for cell migration and differentiation. Genomic profiling reveals that PROP1 binds to genes expressed in epithelial cells like C<i>laudin 23,</i> and to EMT inducer genes like <i>Zeb2, Notch2</i> and <i>Gli2. Zeb2</i> activation appears to be a key step in the EMT process. Our findings identify PROP1 as a central transcriptional component of pituitary stem cell differentiation."

PROP1 binds to promoters and enhancers of genes with demonstrated roles in EMT during development of other organs, including <i>Notch2, Zeb2</i> and <i>Gli2. Zeb2</i> expression appears to be a pivotal step in the EMT process. In addition, we show that PROP1 has an indirect role in regulating <i>Sox2</i> expression and stem cell proliferation. This in-depth molecular analysis of PROP1 action advances our fundamental understanding of pituitary organogenesis and the pathophysiology of hypopituitarism."

Genetic tracing experiments revealed that <i>Sox2</i>-expressing cells in the embryonic pituitary give rise to <i>Sox2-</i>expressing cells postnatally and to all the hormone-producing cell types of the anterior pituitary gland, demonstrating that SOX2-positive cells are the pituitary stem cells (<a href=\"#bib35\">Rizzoti et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Andoniadou et al., 2013</a>). We recently demonstrated that all the hormone-producing cells of the anterior and intermediate lobes of the pituitary gland pass through a <i>Prop1</i> expressing intermediate (<a href=\"#bib9\">Davis et al., 2016</a>). Pituitary stem cells are reported to express PROP1 and SOX2 (<a href=\"#bib14\">Garcia-Lavandeira et al., 2009</a>), but the overlap in expression of these genes during mouse embryogenesis has not been analyzed. PROP1-expressing cells are largely co-incident with SOX2 expressing progenitors at e12.5, although SOX2-positive cells extend over a larger area of Rathke\u2019s pouch (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, left panel). Later in development, at e14.5, PROP1 expression is decreased, particularly in the dorsal region of Rathke\u2019s pouch, where the highly proliferative SOX2-positive cells still predominate. At this time, <i>Prop1-</i>expressing cells are predominately located in the transitional zone, where cells are migrating ventrally to populate the anterior lobe (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, left panel) (<a href=\"#bib47\">Ward et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Suh et al., 2002</a>). One of the known functions of PROP1 is to activate expression of another pituitary-specific transcription factor, POU1F1. Little or no co-localization of POU1F1 and SOX2 is observed in the cell nuclei, either during development or after birth (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, right panel). The consistently mutually exclusive expression of SOX2 and POU1F1 supports the idea that POU1F1 regulates a later stage of differentiation, and it suggests that any effect of POU1F1 on pituitary stem cells would be indirect. Thus, PROP1, but not POU1F1, is initially expressed in SOX2 expressing stem cells in the embryonic pituitary, and the co-localization of PROP1 and SOX2 is transient, ceasing as cells migrate and transition to differentiation."

Non-cycling precursors are restricted both spatially and temporally during normal development and are marked by expression of p57<sup>Kip2</sup> and cyclin E. In most tissues, cyclin E marks the transition from G1 to S phase, but it marks non-cycling precursors in the developing pituitary gland (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bilodeau et al., 2009</a>). As differentiation proceeds, p27<sup>Kip1</sup> is up-regulated concomitant with extinguishing p57<sup>Kip2</sup> expression, and p27<sup>Kip1</sup> protects cells from re-entering the cell cycle (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bilodeau et al., 2009</a>). To investigate whether PROP1 has a role in regulating the progression of proliferating stem cells to a transition phase, we evaluated the expression of transitional cell markers in <i>Prop1</i> loss-of-function mutant (<i>Prop1</i><sup>df/df</sup>, p.Ser83Pro) and control pituitaries. Immunofluorescence revealed CYCLIN E expression in the expected transitional zone of non-cycling progenitors in normal e13.5 pituitaries, but it is completely absent at e13.5 in the pituitaries of <i>Prop1</i><sup>df/df</sup> mice (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Immunoreactivity for p57<sup>kip2</sup> and p27<sup>kip1</sup> was spatially and temporally normal in <i>Prop1</i><sup>df/df</sup> pituitaries, but the number of double positive cells was abnormally high in mutants (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). This suggests that <i>Prop1</i> deficiency causes an abnormal progression from stem cell to differentiated cell. Cyclin D1 is expressed during the G1 phase of the cell cycle and is essential for cells to passage into S phase. At e12.5, CYCLIN D1 is expressed mainly in the proliferative zone of wild-type and <i>Prop1</i> mutant pituitaries. However, at e13.5, there is a reduction in CYCLIN D1-positive cells in dwarf pituitaries (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). These results show that <i>Prop1</i> is necessary for several aspects of cell cycle regulation during embryogenesis: promoting proliferation of progenitor cells marked by Cyclin D1, transitioning them out of the cell cycle to express Cyclin E, and progressing from p57<sup>kip2</sup>-positive transitional cells to p27<sup>kip1</sup>-positive differentiating cells."

The known pattern of <i>Prop1</i> expression correlates with the first wave of proliferation, which peaks at e12.5 and wanes at e14.5, but expression during the postnatal wave of cell proliferation has not been investigated. Using qRT-PCR, we discovered high <i>Prop1</i> mRNA levels at postnatal days 3 and 7 (P3 and P7), that are similar to the peak levels at e12.5 and coincident with the second wave of cell proliferation (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

The missense mutation in <i>Prop1</i> mutant mice does not lead to enhanced protein degradation (<a href=\"#bib13\">Gage et al., 1996</a>), and the mutated protein can be detect using the PROP1 antibody directed against the N\u00a0terminus. We characterized the specificity of the PROP1 antibody by performing immunofluorescence for PROP1 on e12.5 embryos from wild-type and <i>Prop1<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice, which carry a deletion in the <i>Prop1</i> gene and are not expected to produce a stable protein (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) (<a href=\"#bib28\">Nasonkin et al., 2004</a>). As expected, strong, nuclear PROP1 immunoreactivity is detected throughout the middle zone of Rathke\u2019s pouch in wild-type embryos. No PROP1 staining was detected in the pituitaries of <i>Prop1<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice, confirming the specificity of the antibody (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The expansion of SOX2-positive cells in <i>Prop1<sup>df/df</sup>\u00a0</i>pituitaries correlates with an expansion of <i>Prop1-</i>expressing cells in the marginal zone (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A and C</a>). The expanded population of SOX2-expressing cells in <i>Prop1<sup>df/df</sup></i> dwarf pituitaries exhibit less co-localization with SOX9 relative to controls (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B and D</a>).

These colonies represent a mixture of stem cells and cells that have engaged in the transitioning process to differentiation (<a href=\"#bib2\">Andoniadou et al., 2013</a>). We analyzed the number of colony-forming cells (CFCs) per pituitary in normal and mutant mice postnatally, as a measure of the stem cell reserve and engagement (<a href=\"#bib15\">Gaston-Massuet et al., 2011</a>). We demonstrated that both mutants, <i>Prop1</i><sup>df/df</sup> and <i>Pou1f1</i><sup>dw/dw</sup>, can generate progenitor CFCs in culture that express stem cell markers, such as SOX2, SOX9, GFRA2 and CYCLIN D2 by immunostaining (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The number of CFC per pituitary at postnatal days 7, 13 and 38 is reduced in <i>Prop1</i> mutant relative to wild-type pituitaries (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, left panel). Colonies from <i>Prop1</i><sup>df/df</sup> mice differ qualitatively from those of normal mice. Wild-type mice produce colonies that have two visually distinct types. About half of the colonies are comprised of cells that are compact and piled up, which is typical for undifferentiated progenitors (<a href=\"#bib15\">Gaston-Massuet et al., 2011</a>). The rest of the wild-type colonies are comprised of large, flat cells, but 100% of <i>Prop1</i> mutant colonies are the flat cell type (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B and C</a>, left panel). After 4 days in culture, the difference in morphology in the <i>Prop1</i> mutant colonies is already apparent (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). In contrast to <i>Prop1</i><sup>df/df</sup>, the pituitaries from <i>Pou1f1</i><sup>dw/dw</sup> mice produced similar number of colonies per pituitary gland at all ages analyzed relative to wild types, and their morphology was representative of wild type (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A\u2013C</a> right panels).

Remarkably, the gene expression profile supports the idea that <i>Prop1-</i>mutant-derived colonies fail to undergo an Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT)-like process that occurs in both wild-type and <i>Pou1f1</i><sup>dw/dw</sup> colonies. The epithelial markers E-cadherin (<i>Cdh1</i>) and claudin-23 were uniquely up-regulated in <i>Prop1</i> mutant colonies. Moreover, markers of EMT including the regulatory gene <i>Zeb2</i>, which is a transcriptional repressor of the <i>Cdh1</i> gene, are expressed at lower levels only in <i>Prop1</i><sup>df/df</sup> colonies (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). We detected up-regulation of miR-200a in colonies from <i>Prop1</i> mutant pituitaries. This microRNA inhibits the accumulation of ZEB proteins at the <i>Cdh1</i> gene promoter (<a href=\"#bib42\">Vandewalle et al., 2005</a>). Other genes in the EMT-like pathway that exhibited altered expression include the matrix metallopeptidases (<i>Mmps</i>), a disintegrin and metalloproteinases with or without thrombospondin motifs (<i>Adam</i> and <i>Adamts</i>). Moreover, some of the signaling pathways that are down-regulated in colonies from <i>Prop1</i> mutants are well known for being EMT-inducers, including those mediated by Notch, transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF\u03b2), bone morphogenetic protein (BMP), Wnt and SHH signaling (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>)."

Because <i>Zeb2</i> is an inducer of EMT in other tissues (<a href=\"#bib42\">Vandewalle et al., 2005</a>), we tested whether reduction in <i>Zeb2</i> expression was sufficient to alter colony morphology and gene expression. We achieved effective reduction of <i>Zeb2</i> expression with siRNA designed to target <i>Zeb2,</i> but not with the siRNA negative control (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). Lowered <i>Zeb2</i> expression was sufficient to reduce expression of <i>Gli2</i> and increase expression of <i>Cdh1.</i> Treatment with <i>Zeb2</i> siRNA appeared to block formation of tightly packed colonies typical of normal pituitary stem cell cultures (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A and B</a>). Thus, in the absence of <i>Prop1</i> or <i>Zeb2</i> the colonies fail to initiate the EMT-like process and exhibit abnormal morphology and EMT marker gene expression. This supports the idea that <i>Prop1</i> induces EMT-like process in the stem cell population."

PROP1 binds DNA near the <i>Hesx1</i> and <i>Pou1f1</i> genes and suppresses or activates their expression, respectively (<a href=\"#bib39\">Sornson et al., 1996</a>). Little is known about other direct targets of PROP1 regulation. There are no available cell lines that express <i>Prop1,</i> and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis is difficult in small, developing tissues. To identify potential <i>Prop1</i> target genes, we engineered expression of a biotin-tagged PROP1 in pituitary GHFT1 cells, a cell line that was originally developed by targeted oncogenesis in transgenic mice using the <i>Pou1f1</i> enhancer and promoter sequences to drive SV40\u2009T-antigen expression (<a href=\"#bib22\">Lew et al., 1993</a>). GHFT1 cells are thought to represent immortalization of cells in the pituitary primordium at approximately e14.5 when <i>Prop1</i> has activated <i>Pou1f1,</i> but the hormone genes that are downstream targets of <i>Pou1f1</i> are still silent. We generated a stable, derivative, GHFT1 cell line that expresses the bacterial biotin ligase BirA (BirA) using neomycin selection, and a second, stable derivative using puromycin drug selection that expresses BirA and recombinant PROP1 (Prop1Tag). <i>Prop1</i> was engineered to encode a 23 amino acid BirA recognition motif fused to the amino terminus (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib52\">Yu et al., 2009</a>). We chose to modify the amino terminus of PROP1 because is not well conserved (<a href=\"#bib49\">Ward et al., 2007</a>). Western blot analysis, using a BirA antibody, demonstrated expression of BirA in both the BirA cell line and BirA-Prop1Tag cell line. Using streptavidin horseradish peroxidase, we demonstrated in vivo biotinylation of the recombinant PROP1 in the BirA-Prop1Tag cell line (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>)."

This takes advantage of the extremely high affinity of avidin for biotinylated proteins (<a href=\"#bib44\">Viens et al., 2004</a>). A quantitative DNA-PCR assay was used to assess enrichment for occupancy of Prop1Tag at a known PROP1 binding site in the <i>Pou1f1</i> gene. To assess nonspecific background PROP1-DNA binding, a quantitative DNA-PCR assay was carried out for a site in the <i>Hoxd10</i> promoter, which is not expressed in the pituitary or other structures anterior to the hindbrain (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>). The known PROP1 binding site in <i>Pou1f1</i> was highly enriched relative to input and to the controls. The DNA recovered by SA-ChIP was sequenced with a HiSeq 2000 sequencing analyzer and the results analyzed with a standard bioinformatics pipeline. The enrichment profile near the <i>Pou1f1</i> gene identified the known PROP1-binding sites at the early enhancer and the promoter, as well as another, more prominent site at -6\u00a0kb, demonstrating the efficacy of our approach for identification of novel PROP1-binding sites (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D and E</a>). We carried out sequence motif searches on the ChIP-Seq peaks (center \u00b1 200 bp) that were recovered throughout the genome using HOMER algorithms.

Our genome-wide analysis of PROP1 binding identifies target genes that regulate these processes. We propose that <i>Prop1</i> mediates progenitor cell proliferation by driving cell cycle progression. In the absence of functional <i>Prop1</i>, embryonic pituitary progenitors fail to maintain expression of the proliferative markers Cyclin D1 and Cyclin D2 (<a href=\"#bib47\">Ward et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Raetzman et al., 2004</a>), and they fail to initiate expression of the transitional marker Cyclin E. We did not detect <i>Prop1-</i>binding sites near the <i>CyclinD1, D2</i> or <i>E</i> genes, suggesting that <i>Prop1</i> regulation of these genes is indirect. There is a precedent for <i>Gli2</i> activating expression of these genes in the developing lung (<a href=\"#bib37\">Rutter et al., 2010</a>). <i>Gli2</i> is necessary for pituitary progenitor proliferation and normal pituitary morphology (<a href=\"#bib46\">Wang et al., 2010</a>). <i>Gli2-</i>deficient mice either lack their anterior pituitary or have pituitary hypoplasia (<a href=\"#bib46\">Wang et al., 2010</a>). Loss-of-function mutations in the human <i>GLI2</i> gene cause pituitary anomalies and holoprosencephaly (<a href=\"#bib36\">Roessler et al., 2003</a>). <i>Gli2</i> expression is reduced in colonies derived from <i>Prop1</i> mutant pituitaries, and PROP1 binds to the 5\u2019 region of the <i>Gli2</i> gene in cell culture. However, <i>Gli2</i> expression is not strictly or directly <i>Prop1</i> dependent because <i>Gli2</i> is expressed in the mesenchyme surrounding the pituitary early on (at e12.5) and is expressed in pituitary tissue after <i>Prop1</i> expression wanes (e15.5)."

Second, <i>Prop1</i> mutants have reduced cyclin D1 and D2 expression in the progenitor compartment embryonically. Third, <i>Prop1</i> mutants have more SOX2-positive cells residing in the marginal zone or residual Rathke\u2019s cleft, and fewer SOX2-positive cells in the parenchyma, in comparison to both <i>Pou1f1</i> mutants and control mice.

We determined this using several different approaches: colony-forming assays, in vivo analysis of <i>Prop1</i> mutant tissues and genetically engineered cell lines. <i>Prop1</i> deficiency affects pituitary colony-forming properties, and the <i>Prop1</i> mutant<i>-</i>specific alterations in gene expression in these CFCs indicate failure of an EMT-like process. The classic pattern of EMT involves loss of Cdh1 (E-Cadherin) and up-regulation of Cdh2 (N-Cadherin). In <i>Prop1</i> mutants CFCs as well as in pituitary tissues, we observed an increase in Cdh1, however no changes in Cdh2 expression were found. Thus, the process is likely a partial EMT, in which mesenchymal cells do not display all the characteristics of a typical EMT (<a href=\"#bib21\">Leroy and Mostov, 2007</a>). A number of transcription factors, including ZEB family members, regulate EMT. PROP1 binds to the <i>Zeb2</i> promoter, suggesting the regulation may be direct. The level of <i>Zeb2</i> expression is decreased in both CFCs and developmental pituitaries from <i>Prop1</i> mutant mice, and reduction in <i>Zeb2</i> expression is sufficient to mimic some of the properties of <i>Prop1-</i>deficient CFCs. ZEB family proteins reduce epithelial marker expression and increase mesenchymal marker expression during the induction of EMT in other organs (<a href=\"#bib30\">Peinado et al., 2007</a>). In addition, <i>Zeb2</i> is repressed through microRNA 200 family members (<a href=\"#bib6\">Brabletz and Brabletz, 2010</a>), and we found an increase in miR-200a transcripts in colonies from <i>Prop1</i> mutant pituitaries.

Several genes down regulated in the stem cell colonies from <i>Prop1</i> mutant pituitaries were associated with main inducers of the EMT including members of the Notch, TGF-\u03b2, Wnt and Hedgehog pathways. All these signaling pathways are also well known for their critical role in pituitary embryonic development and have important roles in tumorigenesis in both humans and mice.

(DW/J-<i>Pit1<sup>dw</sup></i> \u00d7 CAST/EiJ) F<sub>2</sub> mice were used in this work. <i>Prop1<sup>-/-</sup> </i>mice (officially <i>Prop1</i><sup>tm1Sac</sup>) were generated from mouse embryonic stem cells engineered to contain a deletion in <i>Prop1</i> first exon through a portion of exon 2 (<a href=\"#bib28\">Nasonkin et al., 2004</a>). All transgenic lines have been maintained as colonies at the University of Michigan through heterozygous matings. The morning after conception is designated e0.5, and the day of birth is designated as P1. All mice were housed in a 12-h light, 12-h dark cycle in ventilated cages with unlimited access to tap water and Purina 5058 chow. All procedures using mice were approved by the University of Michigan Committee on Use and Care of Animals, and all experiments were conducted in accordance with the principles and procedures outlined in the National Institutes of Health Guidelines of the Care and Use of Experimental Animals. The genotypes of <i>Prop1</i><sup>df/df</sup> and <i>Pou1f1</i><sup>dw/dw</sup> mice were determined as described (<a href=\"#bib47\">Ward et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Gage et al., 1996</a>). For all experiments, mutants were compared to wild type littermates, to control for the different genetic backgrounds."

FastQC and cross-correlation test were performed to evaluate the data quality. Peaks were annotated for their locations regarding to nearby genes by HOMERv4.6. To discover DNA binding motifs enriched among PROP1 peaks, HOMER's findMotifsGenome.pl was used. FIMO was used to identify locations of motifs inside peaks. ChIP-Seq data are available in the GEO database under accession number GSE77302."

This idea was implicit in descriptions of PROP1 mutant mice initiated almost 20 years ago and pursued by Dr Camper, but the present work provides RNA-seq and ChIP-seq data for PROP1 in the support of this hypothesis. Changes in gene expression in PROP1 mutant pituitaries, such as for the genes encoding E-cadherin, claudin 23, MP2/3, ZEB2, <i>Notch2</i> and GLI2, are correlated with presence of PROP1 ChIP-seq peaks in their vicinity. The authors also show that PROP1 expression overlaps with the progenitor marker <i>Sox2</i>, presumably as progenitors exit the stem state towards differentiation. They also show that the transitional marker cyclin E is much less expressed in PROP1 mutant pituitaries despite the fact that the cell cycle inhibitors p57 and p27 are expressed normally in developing pituitaries. Finally, they show that the colony-forming ability of PROP1 mutant pituitaries is qualitatively, but not quantitatively, altered to yield more of a differentiated rather than progenitor appearance."

As detailed in the individual critiques below, the major common concern was that the data on changes in E-cadherin expression were not very convincing and that some form of more functional assessment of the proposed target genes in PROP1 mutants would help support the hypothesis proposed in the title of the paper. While there are a number of issues raised by the referees, the three key areas that must be addressed before we can consider a revised manuscript are listed below. If you feel you can address these in the required two-month time frame, we will be happy to receive a revised manuscript. If you have concerns about this, please let us know and we can discuss further. It may help us if you responded to this decision letter with a list of the experiments you feel address the major concerns of the reviewers and a reasonable timetable for their completion."
