We performed a screen for cell types that have high levels of signaling through mTORC1, a protein kinase that couples nutrient availability to cell growth. This screen revealed that reticulocytes show high levels of phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6, a downstream target of mTORC1. We found that mTORC1 activity in RBCs is regulated by dietary iron and that genetic activation or inhibition of mTORC1 results in macrocytic or microcytic anemia, respectively. Finally, ATP competitive mTOR inhibitors reduced RBC proliferation and were lethal after treatment with phenylhydrazine, an inducer of hemolysis. These results identify the mTORC1 pathway as a critical regulator of RBC growth and proliferation and establish that perturbations in this pathway result in anemia."

We performed a screen for cell types that have high levels of signaling through mTORC1, a protein kinase that couples nutrient availability to cell growth. This screen revealed that reticulocytes show high levels of phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6, a downstream target of mTORC1. We found that mTORC1 activity in RBCs is regulated by dietary iron and that genetic activation or inhibition of mTORC1 results in macrocytic or microcytic anemia, respectively. Finally, ATP competitive mTOR inhibitors reduced RBC proliferation and were lethal after treatment with phenylhydrazine, an inducer of hemolysis. These results identify the mTORC1 pathway as a critical regulator of RBC growth and proliferation and establish that perturbations in this pathway result in anemia."

Boosting the activity of the mTOR complex leads to a type of anemia in which the cells are much larger than normal, and which is normally associated with inadequate amounts of folate and B12 vitamins."

Key targets of mTORC1 include S6 kinase (S6K), which influences cell size, and the eIF4-E binding protein (4E-BP1), which regulates cell proliferation through effects on cap-dependent translation (<a href=\"#bib47\">Shima et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Dowling et al., 2010</a>). mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) is resistant to rapamycin and contains the protein Rictor. mTORC2 phosphorylates and activates several kinases in the AGC family, such as Akt and SGK, on a sequence known as the hydrophobic motif (<a href=\"#bib44\">Sarbassov et al., 2005</a>).

This approach takes advantage of the fact that activation of mTORC1 leads to rapid phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 (rpS6) on five C-terminal serine residues (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>; Ser 235, 236, 240, 244, 247) (<a href=\"#bib40\">Pende et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Roux et al., 2007</a>). As rpS6 is a structural component of the ribosome, this phosphorylation introduces a \u2018tag\u2019 on the ribosomes from cells that have active mTORC1 signaling. We thus used phospho-specific antibodies to S6 to selectively immunoprecipitate these phosphorylated ribosomes from cells with high levels of TORC1 signaling in mouse brain homogenates, thereby enriching for the mRNA expressed in a subpopulation of activated cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib26\">Knight et al., 2012</a>)."

To test these possibilities, we first used western blotting to quantify the level of pS6 in the lysates from the brain and RBCs.

We then extended this analysis by purifying the ribosomes from a panel of mouse tissues, including fat, testis, lungs, liver, heart, pancreas, stomach, and kidney, and then analyzed the level of pS6 in these tissues compared to blood. Remarkably, reticulocytes had the highest level of pS6 in any tissue we examined (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>).

To explore the role of mTORC1 in RBC growth and hemoglobin synthesis, we first used a genetic approach to either increase or decrease mTORC1 signaling selectively in hematopoietic cells. mTORC1 is under tonic inhibition by the Tsc1/Tsc2 complex, and <i>Tsc1</i> deletion results in constitutively increased mTORC1 signaling. Previous work has shown that inducible deletion of <i>Tsc1</i> in adult animals using either <i>Mx1</i><sup><i>Cre</i></sup> or <i>Gt(ROSA)26Sor</i><sup><i>Cre</i></sup>-<i>ERT2</i> promotes rapid cycling of the hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and is associated with decreased hematopoiesis due to HSC exhaustion (<a href=\"#bib3\">Chen et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Gan et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Gan and DePinho, 2009</a>).

These changes are often characteristic of stress erythropoiesis, suggesting erythropoiesis in the spleen of TSC-KO mice is activated to compensate for reduced RBC production by the bone marrow. To confirm this, we isolated splenocytes and bone marrow cells (BMCs) from TSC-KO and control mice and used flow cytometry to quantify the abundance of RBC progenitors in these two compartments. Consistent with this possibility, TSC-KO mice showed a decrease in the number of erythroid progenitors in the bone marrow (EryB: 5.08 vs 16.3, p &lt; 0.01), and a reciprocal increase in the number of erythroid progenitors in the spleen (EryA: 3.15 vs 10.4%, p &lt; 0.01) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>).

An excess of free globin decreases red blood cell survival in a number of conditions including thalassemia. Thus, chronic iron deficiency triggers an adaptive response in which hemoglobin synthesis and RBC size are reduced, resulting in a microcytic hypochromic anemia in which the low heme levels are balanced by lower levels of globin synthesis. During iron deficiency the activity of heme-regulated eIF2alpha kinase (HRI), a protein kinase that is selectively expressed in RBCs is increased and acts to reduce hemoglobin synthesis. This kinase is phosphorylated and inhibited by free heme and is disinhibited with iron depletion (<a href=\"#bib4\">Chen, 2007</a>). HRI knockout mice do not reduce globin synthesis after iron deficiency indicating that activation of this kinase plays an important role in the adaptive response to dietary iron deficiency (<a href=\"#bib17\">Han et al., 2001</a>)."

To test this we challenged two cohorts of TSC-KO mice as well as littermate controls with either a low iron or control diet for two months and then measured the effect on RBC growth and proliferation. Similar to the effects of an HRI deficiency on the response to iron deficiency, TSC-KO mice became visibly moribund and showed progressive mortality beginning at 3 weeks on an iron deficient diet, such that only 64% of the TSC-KO mice survived the 2-month experiment (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>).

We also noted premature mortality in TSC-KO mice whether or not they were on a low iron diet. Autopsies of two TSC-KO mice, one on chow and another on an iron deficient diet at 6 months of age were performed. Both mice had extramedullary hematopoiesis with multifocal myeloid hyperplasia which was described as moderate. Consistent with the greater mortality of animals on low iron diet, the iron deficient TSC-KO mouse showed increased number of phagocytosed red blood cells in multiple organs compared to the chow-fed TSC-KO animal. These data are consistent with the possibility that constitutive activation of the mTOR pathway in the setting of iron deficiency, which was further exacerbated by phlebotomy for blood collection, decreased RBC viability and increased mortality at younger ages.

Experiments using inducible deletion of mTORC1 subunits in the hematopoietic cells have yielded variable results. For example, an inducible deletion of <i>Rptor</i> in either <i>Mx1</i><sup><i>Cre</i></sup> or <i>ERT2</i><sup><i>Cre</i></sup> animals was reported to be well tolerated in adult animals (<a href=\"#bib19\">Hoshii et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Kalaitzidis et al., 2012</a>). By contrast, inducible deletion of the mTOR kinase in adult mice has recently been reported to result in severe anemia and lethality within 17 days (<a href=\"#bib16\">Guo et al., 2013</a>). The more dramatic phenotype following mTOR deletion may reflect the role of other mTOR complexes in erythropoiesis or reflect differences in recombination efficiency and selectivity between these experiments.

This raised the possibility that the differences between the effects of these two drugs could be a result of inhibition of mTORC2 by MLN0128 but not rapamycin. Alternatively, it is possible that mTORC1 in RBCs was not inhibited by rapamycin to the same extent as it was by MLN0128. In a prior report, a genetic deletion of the essential mTORC2 component rictor had little effect on hematopoiesis, suggesting that TORC2 does not play a major role (<a href=\"#bib32\">Magee et al., 2012</a>). For this reason, we compared first the effects of MLN0128 and rapamycin on mTORC1 signaling. Mice were treated with either rapamycin, MLN0128, or a third, structurally unrelated ATP competitive mTOR inhibitor (KU-0063794) (<a href=\"#bib14\">Garcia-Martinez et al., 2009</a>), and the level of pS6 in RBCs was analyzed by western blotting. MLN0128 and KU-0063794 both potently inhibited S6 phosphorylation in RBCs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). The effect of these drugs was similar at 1 and 2 hr, although MLN0128 showed more durable inhibition at later time points (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). By contrast, we unexpectedly found that rapamycin only weakly inhibited S6 phosphorylation in RBCs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>) and that this rapamycin resistance could not be overcome even by chronic rapamycin treatment (daily for 4 weeks) at high doses (10 mg/kg). This effect was specific to RBCs, as rapamycin potently and durably blocked S6K signaling in other tissues from the same animals (such as liver, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). Because S6 is not a direct target of mTORC1, we also assessed the phosphorylation state of 4E-BP1 in animals treated with MLN0128 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). These data showed that phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 was markedly decreased in treated animals. Furthermore, the extent of this reduction was highly correlated with the reduction in the level of phosphorylation of S6 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>)."

In that study, we used immunoprecipitation of polysomes with an anti-pS6 antibody to enrich for mRNAs from cells that had activated mTORC1 signaling. This study revealed an unexpected enrichment of globin transcripts in the precipitated polysomes. In this study, we report that circulating reticulocytes are the source of these enriched globin transcripts and that these cells have an especially high level of S6 phosphorylation. Since mTOR is known to link changes in nutrient availability to changes in translation and cell growth, these data suggested that mTOR could play an important role in fine tuning the physiologic state of RBCs in response to alterations in the availability of critical nutrients such as iron. We found that mTORC1 in RBCs is regulated by iron and that iron deficiency results in decreased mTORC1 activity in RBCs in vivo. We further showed that activation of mTORC1 by deletion of Tsc1 results in severe macrocytic anemia, while genetic inhibition of mTORC1 results in a lethal microcytic anemia. Thus bidirectional modulation of mTORC1 signaling is sufficient to cause either a macrocytic and microcytic anemia, both of which can be caused by nutrient deficiency. We further showed that pharmacologic inhibition of mTOR by ATP competitive inhibitors and to a lesser extent rapamycin resulted in an acute blockade of erythropoiesis in adults and that mTORC1 signaling is critically required for survival, following hemolytic stress. Finally, we identified rapamycin resistant S6K signaling in RBCs as a biochemical correlate of the differential effects of these drugs on RBC function. Thus, these studies delineate a critical role for mTORC1 signaling in RBC growth, development, and proliferation, and define how this pathway is selectively modulated by distinct pharmacologic, genetic, or nutritional perturbations leading to anemia."

The hereditary anemias, Diamond-Blackfan and 5q-syndrome, are caused by haploinsufficiency of ribosomal proteins S14 and S19, and recent data show that these anemias can be ameliorated by pharmacologic doses of L-leucine (<a href=\"#bib22\">Jaako et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Payne et al., 2012</a>), which activates mTORC1 signaling through S6K and promotes translation. Thus, our finding that RBCs depend critically on signaling through the mTORC1 pathway is consistent with the broader view that RBCs are uniquely sensitive to perturbations that affect protein translation."

Consistent with this, a reduced level of mTORC activity leads to a microcytic anemia either as a result of iron deficiency or a red cell specific mutation in Raptor. As mentioned, HRI, another iron-dependent kinase, is also known to play a critical role in mediating the response to iron deficiency (<a href=\"#bib25\">Kazemi et al., 2007</a>). Further studies may reveal whether the roles of this kinase and mTORC1 in the response to iron deficiency are redundant or if there is cross-talk between these two pathways. Our data further indicate that increased mTORC1 activity in animals with a red cell specific TSC mutation can increase RBC size, similar to the effects of B12 and folate deficiency. Further studies may reveal whether a deficiency of these nutrients leads to mTORC1 activation or whether a different mechanism contributes."

                        "text": "A surprising finding from our study was that S6K signaling in RBCs is rapamycin resistant yet remains sensitive to ATP competitive mTOR inhibitors. Countless studies have shown that rapamycin potently blocks S6 phosphorylation in diverse cellular contexts, and the recent mTOR crystal structure has elucidated the structural origin of this sensitivity (<a href=\"#bib51\">Yang et al., 2013</a>). The biochemical basis for the rapamycin resistance of RBCs is unclear, but it is intriguing that pharmacokinetic studies have reported that rapamycin preferentially accumulates in RBCs (<a href=\"#bib52\">Yatscoff et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Yatscoff, 1996</a>). This has been proposed to result from the elevated expression of (unidentified) rapamycin binding proteins in the erythrocytes. It is thus possible that RBCs express an unusual complement of FKBPs that blunt rapamycin's ability to block mTORC1 signaling. This would provide an explanation for why the widespread clinical use of rapamycin as an immunosuppressant is not associated with a concomitant impairment of erythropoiesis."

While rapamycin analogs have been used clinically for more than a decade, the first ATP competitive mTOR inhibitors are currently in the early-stage clinical trials. A key question for these drugs is how their side-effect profile will compare to widely used rapalogs. Some studies have shown that ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitors actually have weaker effects on lymphocytes than rapamycin, suggesting that these drugs may be safer and less immunosuppressive (<a href=\"#bib23\">Janes et al., 2010</a>). Our data by contrast indicate that ATP competitive mTOR inhibitors block erythropoiesis much more potently than rapamycin, particularly under conditions of erythropoietic stress. Consistent with these data, anemia has been identified as a dose-limiting toxicity in some patients enrolled in the phase I trial of MLN0128 (<a href=\"#bib21\">Infante et al., 2012</a>). As impairment of erythropoiesis is a common side effect of many chemotherapies, it will be important to monitor how these drugs interact with ATP competitive mTOR inhibitors that potently block RBC function. These data also suggest the need for further studies of patients on these medications in clinical settings where hematopoiesis may be disrupted."

A basic challenge for biology is to understand how complex physiologic processes emerge from the action of individual cell types, genes, and pathways. Advances in mouse genetics have made it possible to test hypotheses about the function of genes in specific tissues using methods such as Cre-lox recombination. Yet, the existence of thousands of distinct cell types in mammals suggests a need for new approaches to prioritize and guide this effort. In this paper and a companion report (<a href=\"#bib26\">Knight et al., 2012</a>), we have described a new way to map biochemical events onto cell types within a complex tissue. Our approach is based on capturing RNA from cells in proportion to a biochemical signal such as mTORC1 activation, and then using RNA sequencing to quantify this signal across numerous cell-type-specific marker genes in parallel. We have previously used this technique to identify neurons in the mouse brain that are activated during a behavior (<a href=\"#bib26\">Knight et al., 2012</a>). In this study, we describe how this same approach has revealed a critical role for mTORC1 signaling in a hematopoietic cell type that was only a trace contaminant in our original experiments. These studies illustrate how unbiased genomic approaches such as RNA sequencing can be powerfully repurposed to measure the functional activity of cell types in a complex tissue. We believe the broader application of these approaches has the potential to transform how biologists monitor and analyze complex physiologic systems."

It has been evident for a long time that a high level of protein synthesis is critical to producing hemoglobin in the quantities required in the red cell, and mTOR, which positively promotes translation, has been shown to be inhibited by iron deficiency in RBCs, suggesting a mechanism of coordination between hemoglobin translation and iron availability. However, the specific link and roles of mTORC1 and mTORC2 have not been previously investigated. The authors' findings demonstrate that abnormally high or low mTORC1 activity induces macrocytic or microcytic anemia, respectively. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of mTOR sensitizes mice to hemolytic stress. Moreover, this work yields some surprising findings regarding attenuated effects of rapamycin on S6K signaling (versus effects of MLN0128, an ATP competitive mTOR inhibitor) that are of chemotherapeutic relevance. These findings arose from a serendipitous finding of globin RNAs in rpS6 enriched ribosomes. This indicates the potential sensitivity of this method for identifying rare populations with enhanced mTORC1 activity. The experiments are carefully performed, the data of high quality, and the results support the conclusions."
