For example, when monkeys direct their attention to a visual stimulus, the response gain of specific subsets of neurons in visual cortex changes. Here, we develop a functional model of population activity to investigate the structure of this effect. We fit the model to the spiking activity of bilateral neural populations in area V4, recorded while the animal performed a stimulus discrimination task under spatial attention. The model reveals four separate time-varying shared modulatory signals, the dominant two of which each target task-relevant neurons in one hemisphere. In attention-directed conditions, the associated shared modulatory signal decreases in variance. This finding provides an interpretable and parsimonious explanation for previous observations that attention reduces variability and noise correlations of sensory neurons. Finally, the recovered modulatory signals reflect previous reward, and are predictive of subsequent choice behavior."

For example, when monkeys direct their attention to a visual stimulus, the response gain of specific subsets of neurons in visual cortex changes. Here, we develop a functional model of population activity to investigate the structure of this effect. We fit the model to the spiking activity of bilateral neural populations in area V4, recorded while the animal performed a stimulus discrimination task under spatial attention. The model reveals four separate time-varying shared modulatory signals, the dominant two of which each target task-relevant neurons in one hemisphere. In attention-directed conditions, the associated shared modulatory signal decreases in variance. This finding provides an interpretable and parsimonious explanation for previous observations that attention reduces variability and noise correlations of sensory neurons. Finally, the recovered modulatory signals reflect previous reward, and are predictive of subsequent choice behavior."

This model made it possible to detect hidden signals that control the attentional boosting of these neurons. Rabinowitz et al. show that when a monkey carries out a visual task, the neurons in V4 are under the influence of a small number of shared amplification signals that fluctuate in strength. These amplification signals selectively affect V4 neurons that process different parts of the visual scene. Furthermore, when the monkey directs their attention to a part of the visual scene, the associated amplifier reduces its fluctuations. This has the side effect of both boosting and stabilizing the responses of the affected V4 neurons, as well as increasing their independence."

Although some of this variability presumably arises from noise in local circuits, a substantial portion appears to be due to fluctuations in neurons\u2019 excitability, i.e. their gain (<a href=\"#bib21\">Goris et al., 2014</a>). Since this may result from changes in internal states that modulate sensory responses, such as wakefulness, reward, and expectations, or from changes in top-down signals arriving from other cortical areas, it is likely that a significant component of the gain fluctuations in individual neurons are not \u201cprivate\u201d, but shared across populations (<a href=\"#bib16\">Ecker et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Sch\u00f6lvinck et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Lin et al., 2015</a>).

The model includes stochastic modulatory signals that alter the gains of targeted subsets of neurons. We fit the model to spiking data from populations of \u223c100 neurons in visual area V4, simultaneously recorded from both hemispheres of a macaque monkey that was performing a change-detection task under directed spatial attention (<a href=\"#bib8\">Cohen and Maunsell, 2009</a>). The model is fit without specification of the hemispheric origin of the neurons, or the extent to which they were influenced by the various gain factors. The resulting fitted model reveals that the population was predominantly influenced by two independent shared modulatory signals, each operating primarily within one hemisphere, and each targeting the neurons most relevant for the task. The statistics of each of these signals changed significantly depending on the attentional condition, with each modulator exhibiting a decrease in variance when the monkey was cued to attend to the stimuli in the corresponding hemifield. Together with the (classical) increases in mean response, these changes in the statistics of the shared modulatory signals account for the previously-reported decrease in neural variability and noise correlations. Finally, we show that the inferred modulatory signals are correlated with the monkey\u2019s behavioral performance on each trial, and are influenced by the reward received on the previous trial. The structure and statistics of shared modulatory fluctuations thus provide a parsimonious account of attentional effects on population coding and behavior.

Evidence for fluctuating modulation of sensory responses was recently provided in (<a href=\"#bib21\">Goris et al., 2014</a>). The statistical argument that these inputs are multiplicative (rather than additive) is based on a consideration of their effects as a function of firing rate: multiplicative noise has its greatest effects on response variance (and covariance) for stimuli evoking high firing rates, while additive noise has its greatest effects on response variance (and covariance) for stimuli evoking low firing rates. This is difficult to assess in the context of the V4 attentional dataset, since the standard stimuli were all identical, and responses to the targets were often interrupted by saccades. Restricting the analysis to target responses that were not interrupted is possible, but such conditioning on a behavioral state (and likely a modulator state) would complicate any interpretation. There was, however, some variability in evoked firing rates arising from adaptation. Many neurons showed a trend of slightly decreasing response to the sequence of standard stimuli, with an average total decrease of \u223c5% in firing rate over the ten presentations after the first. This decrease was sufficiently small that including it in the analysis of the main text only marginally improved predictive log-likelihoods (as in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a</a>), and did not qualitatively change any of the main results or conclusions. These small changes in firing rate over the stimulus sequence were nevertheless sufficient to examine the hypothesis that neural response variance was due a multiplicative noise source.

We then fit the model to these synthetic datasets, and measured how well the model fits recovered the true modulatory structure. More specifically, we extracted default model parameters by fitting each neural population: the stimulus-driven mean firing rates <i>F</i>, the cue-dependent gains <i>C</i>, and the slow global drifts <i>D</i>. Then, for a given number of simulated modulators <i>K</i> (from 1 to 12), we sampled a (<i>T</i>\u00a0\u00d7 <i>K</i>) matrix of time-varying modulator values (each value i.i.d.

For each population and <i>K</i>, we chose the scaling parameter <i>\u03bb</i> such that the median noise correlation between the simulated neurons matched the median noise correlation between the actual neurons. We next fitted the models to these simulated datasets to see how well they recovered the underlying structure. As for the actual data (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>), we evaluated the model fits via the predictive log-likelihood on held-out data. Each colored line shows the predictive LLs of the fitted models for a given \u201cground truth\u201d number of modulators. In comparison, the grey squares show the model performance for the actual data. There are two important patterns here. First, for simulated models containing up to 8 modulators, the predictive LLs are greatest when we fit a model having the same number of modulators as the ground truth number used to simulate the data. This demonstrates that the model is in principle able to recover more modulators than the 4 we fit to the actual data. Second, as the number of simulated modulators increases, the ability of the fitted models to make predictions on held-out data declines. This is because the total energy of the shared gain fluctuations is constrained by the measured noise correlations, and is spread amongst the simulated modulators. In this respect, the model predictions on the actual data are most consistent with simulations of 3 or 4 modulators. Finally, it is worth noting that, in simulation, when fitting more modulators than the ground truth, the predictive performance suffers. This reflects overfitting to the noise in the training set. We do not see as pronounced a decline for the model fits to the actual data: instead, the predictive LLs appear to saturate with the number of modulators. This difference between the actual and synthetic data likely reflects our assumption in the simulations that the modulators were all of equal magnitude. A saturation of predictive LL may arise when there is a small set of dominant modulators, and a number of weaker ones. We do not have the statistical power to explore such a long tail of modulatory influences within this dataset, and focus instead on the strongest components."

Here we show that these features are present within higher-dimensional modulator models.\u00a0In <a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>, we show that these additional modulatory components do not convey any additional structure in these three domains. It is useful to first view the modulator model as a form of exponential-family Principal Component Analysis (PCA) (<a href=\"#bib10\">Collins et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Solo and Pasha, 2013</a>;<a href=\"#bib51\">Pfau et al., 2013</a>). Standard PCA, like the shared modulator model, uncovers directions in signal space of maximal variation. However, PCA suffers from an identifiability problem: it can uniquely recover the subspace in which a small set of signals lie, but not the coordinate axes. PCA does select a particular orthogonal coordinate system to represent this subspace, but this solution is not unique, is sensitive to noise, and typically reveals little about the underlying generative process. This same identifiability problem is present with the shared modulator model. In the two-modulator case, we are able to resolve the ambiguity in the coordinate system by exploiting anatomical information (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2b\u2013c</a>; see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods). However, the problem of identifiability becomes more acute in higher dimensions. Here, we show that the results presented in the main text for the 1-modulator/hemisphere model also hold for the unconstrained 2-modulator model. We also extend the 2-modulator results to the 3- and 4-modulator cases. This is necessary as, unlike standard PCA, the solutions to our equations in lower dimensions do not necessarily lie within subspaces of higher-dimensional solutions. This is because the regularization scheme and algorithm we use create biases that disrupt any strict nesting. We therefore need to explicitly test whether the structures we uncover in the 2-modulator model are also present in the 3- and 4-modulator models. And this needs to be done under the limitations of the identifiability problem, i.e. without choosing a particular coordinate system for the modulation subspace. First column: In <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2b\u2013c</a>, we showed that the vectors of modulator coupling weights for LHS units and RHS units in the 2D modulator model were typically orthogonal. Here we show that this holds in higher dimensions. For each recording day, we measured the angle between the average weight vector for LHS units (<math id=\"inf2\"><msub><mrow><mover accent=\"true\"><mrow><mi>w</mi></mrow><mo>\u0304</mo></mover></mrow><mrow><mi>L</mi></mrow></msub></math>), and the average weight vector for RHS units (<math id=\"inf3\"><msub><mrow><mover accent=\"true\"><mrow><mi>w</mi></mrow><mo>\u0304</mo></mover></mrow><mrow><mi>R</mi></mrow></msub></math>), i.e. the arc cosine of their inner product. The 2-modulator hemisphere-constrained model used in most of the main text has this orthogonality enforced by constraint (top row). For the unconstrained 2-, 3-, and 4-modulator models (remaining rows), the blue histograms show the distribution of these angles across recording days. For comparison, we shuffle the anatomical labels on each unit and repeat the analysis to obtain the red histograms. The clustering of the actual data around <i>\u03c0</i>/2 indicates near orthogonality of the hemispheric weights. Second column: In <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2d</a>, we showed that neurons which were task-relevant (i.e. had larger <i>d</i>\u2032 values) were more strongly coupled to the (1D) hemispheric shared modulators. Here, we show that this holds in higher dimensions. For each recording day, we measured the magnitudes of all units\u2019 coupling weight vectors, <math id=\"inf4\"><msub><mfenced close=\"||\" open=\"||\"><mi>w</mi></mfenced><mn>2</mn></msub></math>. Green histograms show the distribution of magnitudes for the quartile of units with largest <i>d</i>\u2032 values; brown histograms show the distribution of magnitudes for the quartile with the smallest <i>d</i>\u2032 values. Third column: In <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b</a>, we showed that the variance of the (1D) hemispheric shared modulators changed according to the attentional cue: specifically, when the cue switched, one hemispheric modulator decreased in variance, while the other increased in variance. To show that this holds in higher dimensions, it is necessary to construct an appropriate metric for this change in second-order statistics that generalizes to higher dimensions, and that also does not depend on a choice of coordinate system. To accomplish this, we measure the effect of the attentional cue as a change in the covariance of the (multivariate) modulator. Considering the change from the cue-right to the cue-left condition, we can measure the effect on the modulator\u2019s second-order statistics via the ratio of the two modulator covariances, <math id=\"inf5\"><msub><mrow><mi>C</mi></mrow><mrow><mi>cueL</mi></mrow></msub><mspace width=\"0.3em\"></mspace><msubsup><mrow><mi>C</mi></mrow><mrow><mi>cueR</mi></mrow><mrow><mo>-</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msubsup></math>. The eigenvalues of this matrix then provide a coordinate-system-free measure of how the modulator statistics change. If the largest eigenvalue, <i>\u03bb<sub>max</sub></i>, is significantly greater than 1, then there is a direction in modulation space that became more variable due to the switch in cue. If the smallest eigenvalue, <i>\u03bb<sub>min</sub></i>, is significantly less than 1, then there is a direction in modulation space that became less variable due to the switch in cue. Eigenvalues close to 1 indicate that the variance of modulation in that direction was unchanged by the cue. Thus these two values, <i>\u03bb<sub>max</sub></i> and <i>\u03bb<sub>min</sub></i>, play an analogous role to the ratios of modulator variance examined in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3b</a>. The scatter plots show the distribution of <i>\u03bb<sub>max</sub></i> and <i>\u03bb<sub>min</sub></i> for the higher-dimensional modulator models. Blue points show these eigenvalues from each recording day; red points show the distributions obtained if we shuffle the cue labels for each trial. Importantly, when <i>\u03bb<sub>max</sub></i> exceeds 1 and <i>\u03bb<sub>min</sub></i> is less than 1 (i.e. when the points lie in the lower right quadrant), then the change in attentional cue is causing an increase in modulator variance in one direction, and a decrease in modulator variance in an orthogonal direction. These effects are clear (and significant, compared with the null distribution in red) in all cases."

In <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>, we demonstrate that these properties also manifest within 3- and 4-modulator models. We wondered whether any additional structure can be seen in the extra two dimensions of modulation that we can include beyond the 2-modulator model. To answer this, we partitioned the 4-dimensional modulator space into two 2-dimensional halves. For each recording day, we define a particular 2D subspace of modulation along anatomical grounds. We measured the mean weight vectors for LHS and RHS units, <math id=\"inf6\"><msub><mrow><mover accent=\"true\"><mrow><mi>w</mi></mrow><mo>\u0304</mo></mover></mrow><mrow><mi>L</mi></mrow></msub></math> and <math id=\"inf7\"><msub><mrow><mover accent=\"true\"><mrow><mi>w</mi></mrow><mo>\u0304</mo></mover></mrow><mrow><mi>R</mi></mrow></msub></math> respectively. As shown in <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>, these two vectors were always near-orthogonal. We define their 2D span as the \u201chemispheric subspace of modulation\u201d, <math id=\"inf8\"><mi>H</mi><mspace width=\"0.3em\"></mspace><mo>=</mo><mspace width=\"0.3em\"></mspace><mi>span</mi><mrow><mo>(</mo><msub><mover><mi>w</mi><mo>\u00af</mo></mover><mi>L</mi></msub><mo>,</mo><msub><mover><mi>w</mi><mo>\u00af</mo></mover><mi>R</mi></msub><mo>)</mo></mrow></math>. This is a 2D subspace of the 4D weight vectors, capturing the largest component of hemispheric-specificity in the modulator weights. What remains in the 4D modulation space is the hemispheric subspace\u2019s orthogonal complement, <math id=\"inf9\"><msup><mi>H</mi><mo>\u22a5</mo></msup></math>. This divides the 4D space into two 2D subspaces, and thus amounts to a partial choice of a coordinate system. We can therefore study the anatomical and functional properties of the coupling weights in <math id=\"inf10\"><mi>H</mi></math> and <math id=\"inf11\"><msup><mi>H</mi><mo>\u22a5</mo></msup></math>, and also the attention-dependent statistics within the corresponding 2D spaces of time-varying modulator values. This panel shows that all three properties described in <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a> manifest predominantly in <math id=\"inf12\"><mi>H</mi></math>, but not in <math id=\"inf13\"><msup><mi>H</mi><mo>\u22a5</mo></msup></math>. In summary, each V4 hemisphere is being driven by a shared modulatory signal, that preferentially affects task-specific neurons, and has statistics that depend on the attentional cue provided to the animal. In addition, there is some evidence that other shared modulatory factors are affecting the population of V4 neurons. However, these latter signals do not share the same properties: their net effects are weaker, they do not appear to have the same anatomical or functional specificity, and they do not appear to be affected by the attentional cue."

First, although the model was not given any information regarding anatomical location or connectivity of the neurons, the estimated coupling weights for each modulator clearly identify the hemisphere in which the corresponding neurons reside (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2b\u2013c</a>). In a given recording, each modulator had largely positive weights for neurons in one hemisphere (indicating that these neurons\u2019 gains were being co-modulated by this signal), and small weights for neurons in the opposite hemisphere. Thus, the weight structure of the estimated model suggests that the two hemispheric V4 subpopulations are modulated by two independent signals. Based on this observation, we examined a restricted model, in which we explicitly enforce the hemispheric assignment of each modulator (from here on, referred to as the LHS and RHS modulators), by setting the weights for neurons in the opposite hemisphere to zero. This enforced assignment reduces the number of weight parameters by a factor of two, and results in a modest improvement in the quality of model predictions on held-out data, reaching the level of the 4-modulator model (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a</a>, grey square). For the remainder of this article, we retain this enforced assignment of the modulators to the hemispheres."

We characterized the task-relevance of each neuron in terms of its ability to discriminate the standard and target stimuli in the cue-away (inattentive) condition. Specifically, for each neuron, we computed the difference in mean spike count for the two stimuli, relative to the standard deviation (known in the perceptual psychology literature as <i>d</i>\u2032). Comparison of these values to the modulator coupling weights indicates that the modulators preferentially targeted the most task-informative neurons (<i>r</i>\u00a0=\u00a00.42; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2d</a>). One might suspect that some portion of this effect is simply due to firing rate\u2014units with higher mean firing rates typically had stronger coupling weights to the modulators, paralleling previous observations (<a href=\"#bib8\">Cohen and Maunsell, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Mitchell et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">de la Rocha et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Ecker et al., 2010</a>) (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a>).

Right: effect of reward on performance predicted by chaining together the effects of reward on modulator (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7a</a>) and modulator on performance (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7c</a>). The biasing effect of reward on behavior, as mediated by the V4 modulators, is consistent with the observed data (left), but captures only a relatively small proportion of the total reward bias (\u223c5\u201310%). To estimate the total behavioral reward bias, we fitted Bernoulli-GLMs (i.e. GLMs with a Bernoulli observation process) which predict the response (hit/miss), given the previous trial\u2019s reward (hit for target on cued side/hit for target on opposite side/other) as regressors. When the current trial\u2019s target was cued, we treated the orientation change as an additional regressor, and we included a lapse parameter as behavioral performance typically saturated below 100% correct (<a href=\"#bib73\">Wichmann and Hill, 2001</a>). The effect of previous reward in this model manifests as a bias term within the sigmoid (logistic) nonlinearity. To estimate the V4-mediated reward bias, we measured how large these total behavioral reward biases were if they had to pass through the \u201cbottleneck\u201d of the V4 modulators. We thus fitted three GLMs: a Gaussian-GLM which predicts the cued modulator on a trial, given the previous reward (and the previous modulator values); a second Gaussian-GLM which predicts the opposite modulator on a trial in the same way; and a Bernoulli-GLM which predicts the response (hit/miss), with the two modulators on that trial as a regressor. By multiplying these two effects together (the average change in modulators due to each previous reward state in the first and second GLMs, with the modulator coefficients in the third GLM), we obtained the desired quantities."

Conversely, after receiving a reward for correctly identifying an opposite target, on the next trial they are substantially more likely to score a hit for an opposite target, and a miss for a cued target (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7b</a>)."

When fit to measured population activity, the model reveals the hidden influence of 2\u20134 shared modulatory signals (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a</a>). The two most significant modulators exhibit pronounced anatomical, functional and attentional structure: they each target neurons in one hemisphere (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2b\u2013c</a>); they are most strongly coupled to the most task-relevant neurons (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2d\u2013e</a>); and their temporal statistics change under cued attention (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). Specifically, when attention is directed to one hemifield, the modulatory signal associated with the corresponding V4 hemisphere decreases in variance, thus stabilizing the shared gain fluctuations within that subpopulation. This, in turn, provides an interpretable and parsimonious account of the observed effects of attention on V4 responses: a reduction in variability (Fano factor) and pairwise spike count correlation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). The estimated coupling strengths to the modulatory signals predicts the degree to which individual neurons exhibit these effects (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>).

These behaviors are predicted by our model as a simple consequence of the attention-driven changes in modulator variance. Since attention reduces the variance of the shared modulator, it would also be expected to reduce the variance of summed activity across the population, such as that measured in LFPs. In addition, since attention reduces the proportion of neural variance due to shared modulation, the correlation between single neuron spike counts and the aggregate LFP activity would also be reduced (<a href=\"#bib21\">Goris et al., 2014</a>)."

The multiplicative nature of this interaction is broadly consistent with the patterns of response variability seen throughout visual cortex, which show signatures of multiplicative, rather than additive noise (<a href=\"#bib21\">Goris et al., 2014</a>). Nevertheless, other modeling efforts have found evidence for shared additive noise (<a href=\"#bib33\">Lin et al., 2015</a>), and we cannot fully rule out the possibility that additive noise also contributes to the variability in our data. A strong test of the multiplicative assumption requires analysis of neural responses over a range of stimulus drive levels. In the dataset analyzed here, reliable responses to only one stimulus per neuron are available for analysis (target responses have not been included, since they are corrupted by co-occurring saccades). Nevertheless,\u00a0the modest reduction in firing rates arising from adaptation to repeated presentations of the standard stimuli provides some opportunity to examine this question. We find that the patterns of response variance along this axis are indeed consistent with the multiplicative hypothesis (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). A more definitive comparison of additive vs. multiplicative interactions could be achieved with more extensive experimental manipulations of stimulus parameters."

At first glance, this result seems at odds with the attention-induced reduction of variance in the inferred modulators of our model, which generally leads to a decrease in noise correlations. However, a plausible explanation may arise from considering that populations are not just affected by attention-dependent sources of modulation, but also by additional sources that are attention-independent. In the datasets we study here, we identify two examples: the global slow drifts (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), and the extra, non-hemispheric, fast modulators (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). If the two subpopulations responsible for encoding the two visual stimuli each have their own, separate, attention-dependent modulator, while both populations are subject to an additional set of common, attention-independent modulations, then attention might serve to \u201cunmask\u201d the cross-population correlations arising from these common modulatory signals.

However, the model does not account for all of the observed cue-dependent changes in variability (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5b</a>), suggesting that the model structure (e.g. Poisson spiking, with rate modulated by an exponentiated sum of shared signals) is too restricted to capture the full extent of the effects. Moreover, the dimensionality and structure of the estimated modulators are limited by the experiment itself (<a href=\"#bib20\">Gao and Ganguli, 2015</a>), and thus cannot be taken as a complete account of modulatory activity in V4. The behavioral task is designed to engage two attentional conditions, each associated with stimuli presented over extensive blocks of trials in one hemifield of the visual world. Similarly, the stimuli in the task provide only a minimal characterization of the selectivity of individual neurons (e.g. receptive field locations, tuning properties). We expect that a more complex task, in which attention is precisely focused in terms of visual location, stimulus properties, and/or time, could potentially reveal modulatory signals targeting more specific subpopulations of neurons."

The principal\u00a0value of these models is in providing a parsimonious quantitative framework that explains the relationship between stimuli, neural responses, and behavior. In this respect, a primary contribution of our work is to show that the patterns of neural variability in a visual cortical population during this attentional task are dominated by a few internal signals. This need not have been the case: the model could have required many more modulators to explain the structure of observed population activity, or the imposed structure of the model might have proven inappropriate or insufficient to provide an account of the data."

We can envision three broad scenarios for the mechanistic source of shared gain fluctuations: bottom-up (stimulus-driven) input, recurrent activity within the population, and top-down state signals. Each of these mechanisms has previously been proposed as an explanation for excess neural response variance or noise correlations (<a href=\"#bib21\">Goris et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Ecker et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Ecker et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Ecker et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Zohary et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Shadlen et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Shadlen and Newsome, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Nienborg and Cumming, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Yang and Shadlen, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Arieli et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Litwin-Kumar and Doiron, 2012</a>). The latter two mechanisms seem compatible with the low-dimensional nature (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2a</a>), spatial scale (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2b\u2013c</a>), and temporal scale (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>) of the modulatory signals we have identified. Top-down and recurrent mechanisms need not operate independently: recent theoretical work proposes a combination of these two mechanisms, in which top-down modulation induces a change in the balance of excitability in a recurrent E-I network (<a href=\"#bib74\">Wiese et al., 2014</a>). One potential top-down biological substrate is cholinergic input, which has a multiplicative (<a href=\"#bib13\">Disney et al., 2007</a>) and hemispherically-specific (<a href=\"#bib41\">Mesulam et al., 1983</a>) effect on neurons in macaque visual cortex, and is known to be enhanced under attention (<a href=\"#bib27\">Herrero et al., 2008</a>). However, it has recently been shown that in area V1, cholinergic input mediates attention-dependent increases in mean firing rate, but not changes in response variance or noise correlations, which appear to depend on NMDA receptors (<a href=\"#bib26\">Herrero et al., 2013</a>). Consistent with these findings, our model suggests that the attention-mediated increase and stabilization of gain in area V4 might arise from two separate mechanisms: the estimated coupling weights associated with the cue and modulator signals are similar but not identical (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5c</a>), and when they are forced to be identical, model predictions worsen. A full mechanistic account of the modulators could be developed in future experiments by comparing the estimated modulator signals against other neural or physiological signals (e.g. neurotransmitter concentrations, or pupil dilation (<a href=\"#bib40\">McGinley et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Reimer et al., 2014</a>), and by comparing the weights with detailed anatomical and functional properties of the neurons in the population."

This would predict that when a modulator increases, detection probability on the corresponding side would improve (as we see in the top left and bottom right of <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7a</a>). However, the observation that the value of a modulator also affects performance on the other side (top right and bottom left of <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7a</a>) is inconsistent with this hypothesis.

Another is the fact that attention reduces the correlation between pairs of neurons (Cohen and Maunsell 2009, Mitchell et al. 2009). The two are apparently contradictory, because increases in firing rate gain, on their own, would have caused the opposite effect on correlations. Yet the model captures both: the first by an increase in mean gain, and the second by a decrease in the variance of the gain (which also explains the well-known reduction in variability caused by attention)."

Moreover, it is a considerable improvement over prior methods to summarize the effect of attention on a large population. The prior methods involved finding a vector between the mean uncued response and the mean cued response and projecting the data onto that axis (Cohen and Maunsell, 2010). The new approach is more general, and finds the directions in neural state space that best account for trial-to-trial shared neural variability with certain broad features. In this way, variability can be assigned to dimensions that have some interpretation, and the contributions of each dimension can be quantified."

In most previous studies, the measured correlations were interpreted as fluctuations in the neural representation of the stimulus. Because correlations often impair the ability to accurately decode, these 'representation fluctuations' were hypothesized to be harmful to the ability to detect changes in the stimulus. Thus, attention would aid detection by increasing signal (by increasing firing rate) and by decreasing noise in the stimulus representation (visible in noise correlations). Cohen and Maunsell 2010 and 2011 described a different form of correlated neural variability: fluctuations in the attentional signal itself. Even when attentional demands are nominally the same across trials, the internal deployment of attention fluctuates, leading to fluctuations in performance: better performance when 'attentional fluctuations' happen to be higher."

The present work, instead, indicates a much simpler solution: the decreases in correlated variability caused by attention can be attributed entirely to decreases in the variability of the attentional signals themselves. There is no need to assume attentional modulation of representational fluctuations. Indeed, it isn't even clear if there are large representational fluctuations. Which means we are left with one parsimonious interpretation of the data, which provides a unifying explanation for prior results."

Yet, the paper seems to fall short of a full commitment to its own findings. Or rather, it commits to the aspects that agree with prior work \u2013 there is modulation in dimensions that seem attentional, as in Cohen and Maunsell 2010 \u2013 while downplaying the aspects that disagree with prior work. Indeed, a conclusion that can be drawn from the paper is that there is no longer any reason to assume that 'representational fluctuations' are reduced by attention. Rather, this old explanation should be replaced with the new explanation where it is attentional variability itself that is the measured effect. In parts of the Discussion the manuscript commits to that. Yet in other parts, it reverts to explanations of the older variety. For instance, when describing the effect of cholinergic input it reverts to the old model, in which attention causes a reduction in variability. The subsequent paragraph also seems to adhere to the old view. The manuscript seems to avoid undermining prior work, rather than committing to the new unifying interpretation that in other places (including the Abstract and Introduction) it seems willing to endorse."

For instance, consider the following idea (provided by one of the reviewers). If the commonly observed decline in 'noise correlations' is in fact due to a decline in attentional fluctuations (rather than a cue-induced suppression of representational fluctuations) then that makes the following prediction.

For example, much of <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> can be inferred from Cohen and Maunsell 2010, including the impact of the cue and two modulatory signals (panel a) and the hemispheric separation (panels b, c). One of the more compelling links to behavior (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>) is essentially a reproduction of the effect in Cohen and Maunsell.Therefore, for this paper to have impact, it is particularly important to ensure that it does 'provide a unified account of attentional effects on population coding and behavior' (to quote its own words). Yet, the paper seems to fall short of a full commitment to its own findings. Or rather, it commits to the aspects that agree with prior work \u2013 there is modulation in dimensions that seem attentional, as in Cohen and Maunsell 2010 \u2013 while downplaying the aspects that disagree with prior work. Indeed, a conclusion that can be drawn from the paper is that there is no longer any reason to assume that 'representational fluctuations' are reduced by attention. Rather, this old explanation should be replaced with the new explanation where it is attentional variability itself that is the measured effect. In parts of the Discussion the manuscript commits to that. Yet in other parts, it reverts to explanations of the older variety. For instance, when describing the effect of cholinergic input it reverts to the old model, in which attention causes a reduction in variability. The subsequent paragraph also seems to adhere to the old view. The manuscript seems to avoid undermining prior work, rather than committing to the new unifying interpretation that in other places (including the Abstract and Introduction) it seems willing to endorse.</i>"

Bottom row: the noise correlations in the two subgroups are roughly equal (though still overall lower in the cue towards condition). Note that the subgroups\u2019 noise correlations are lower than the full dataset for that cue condition, as we have reduced the (conditional) variance in the shared modulator.
