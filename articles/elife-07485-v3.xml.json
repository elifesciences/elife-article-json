                    "text": "Maintenance of energy homeostasis depends on the highly regulated storage and release of triacylglycerol primarily in adipose tissue, and excessive storage is a feature of common metabolic disorders. CIDEA is a lipid droplet (LD)-protein enriched in brown adipocytes promoting the enlargement of LDs, which are dynamic, ubiquitous organelles specialized for storing neutral lipids. We demonstrate an essential role in this process for an amphipathic helix in CIDEA, which facilitates embedding in the LD phospholipid monolayer and binds phosphatidic acid (PA). LD pairs are docked by CIDEA trans-complexes through contributions of the N-terminal domain and a C-terminal dimerization region. These complexes, enriched at the LD\u2013LD contact site, interact with the cone-shaped phospholipid PA and likely increase phospholipid barrier permeability, promoting LD fusion by transference of lipids. This physiological process is essential in adipocyte differentiation as well as serving to facilitate the tight coupling of lipolysis and lipogenesis in activated brown fat."

CIDEA is a lipid droplet (LD)-protein enriched in brown adipocytes promoting the enlargement of LDs, which are dynamic, ubiquitous organelles specialized for storing neutral lipids. We demonstrate an essential role in this process for an amphipathic helix in CIDEA, which facilitates embedding in the LD phospholipid monolayer and binds phosphatidic acid (PA). LD pairs are docked by CIDEA trans-complexes through contributions of the N-terminal domain and a C-terminal dimerization region. These complexes, enriched at the LD\u2013LD contact site, interact with the cone-shaped phospholipid PA and likely increase phospholipid barrier permeability, promoting LD fusion by transference of lipids. This physiological process is essential in adipocyte differentiation as well as serving to facilitate the tight coupling of lipolysis and lipogenesis in activated brown fat."

In addition, the helix interacts with a molecule in the lipid droplet membrane called phosphatidic acid. Barneda et al. suggest that this interaction helps to transfer the contents of one droplet to another by making it easier for lipids to move through the droplets\u2019 membranes."

However, excessive or defective lipid storage is a key feature of common diseases such as diabetes, atherosclerosis, and the metabolic syndrome (<a href=\"#bib23\">Greenberg et al., 2011</a>). The organelles that are essential for storing and mobilizing intracellular fat are lipid droplets (LDs) (<a href=\"#bib65\">Walther and Farese, 2012</a>). They constitute a unique cellular structure where a core of neutral lipids is stabilized in the hydrophilic cytosol by a phospholipid monolayer embedding LD\u00a0proteins. While most mammalian cells present small LDs (&lt;1 \u03bcm) (<a href=\"#bib61\">Suzuki et al., 2011</a>), white (unilocular) adipocytes contain a single giant LD that occupies most of their cell volume. In contrast, brown (multilocular) adipocytes hold multiple LDs of smaller size that increase the LD surface/volume ratio, which facilitates the rapid consumption of lipids for adaptive thermogenesis (<a href=\"#bib15\">Cinti, 2012</a>)."

The multilocular morphology of brown adipocytes is a defining characteristic of these cells along with expression of genes such as Ucp1. The acquisition of a unilocular or multilocular phenotype is likely to be controlled by the regulation of LD growth. Two related proteins, CIDEA and CIDEC, promote LD enlargement in adipocytes (<a href=\"#bib71\">Wu et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Puri et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">2008</a>), with CIDEA being specifically found in BAT. Together with CIDEB, they form the CIDE (cell death-inducing DFF45-like effector) family of LD\u00a0proteins, which have emerged as important metabolic regulators (<a href=\"#bib72\">Xu et al., 2012</a>)."

The study of CIDE proteins has revealed a critical role in the LD fusion process in which a donor LD progressively transfers its content to an acceptor LD until it is completely absorbed (<a href=\"#bib21\">Gong et al., 2011</a>). However, the underlying mechanism by which CIDEC and CIDEA facilitate the interchange of TAG molecules between LDs is not understood. In the present study, we have obtained a detailed picture of the different steps driving this LD enlargement process, which involves the stabilization of LD pairs, phospholipid binding, and the permeabilization of the LD monolayer to allow the transference of lipids."

During differentiation of immortalized brown pre-adipocytes, large LDs were formed by the fusion of pre-existing LDs (<a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). This fusion process was characterized by a slow and progressive reduction in the volume of a donor LD until it was completely absorbed by an acceptor LD (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), which is characteristic of CIDE activity. As CIDEA is selectively expressed in brown adipocytes and could have a prominent role in the acquisition of their multilocular morphology, we explored the effects of its expression in undifferentiated pre-adipocytes. After inducing CIDEA, LDs in pre-adipocytes showed an equivalent dynamic pattern to that observed in differentiating brown cells, with the progressive fusion of the initial LDs until a few large LDs remained in the cell (<a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). LD fusion was achieved by the slow transference of lipids between LDs, and was preceded by the formation of small clusters of interacting LDs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Given the importance of this process in adipocyte dynamics, we decided to undertake a comprehensive molecular analysis."

Control cells, which lacked expression of CIDEA, did not show LD enlargement (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). As many proteins are constructed of domains, which are conserved across families and serve as their main structural and functional units, we assessed the conserved regions within the CIDE proteins. By comparing the 217 amino acid (aa) sequence of CIDEA with that of CIDEB and CIDEC, four highly conserved regions could be identified (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The N-terminal (N-term) domain of CIDEA is composed of a basic region (2\u201372 aa) followed by an acidic sequence (73\u2013110 aa). These distinctly differently charged regions are indicated by protein crystallography studies to be important for the dimerization of CIDE domain proteins (<a href=\"#bib43\">Lugovskoy et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Wang et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Sun et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Lee et al., 2013</a>). The CIDEA C-terminal (C-term) is rich in basic aas and contains a highly conserved region (126\u2013155 aa) and a basic and hydrophobic sequence (162\u2013197 aa). Based on this sequence analysis, we created an extensive collection of v5-tagged CIDE point and deletion mutants to test their effects on LDs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). Interestingly, certain mutations such as R171E/R175E promoted the aggregation of the cellular LDs in a few 'bunch of grapes'-like LD clusters, but were unable to induce the transference of lipids between them (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). In other cases, as with the expression of CIDEA-(116\u2013217)-v5, the LDs remained small and dispersed throughout the cytoplasm despite the protein being normally localized at their surface. Finally, some versions of CIDEA, such as CIDEA-(1\u2013118)-v5, showed no LD localization and did not affect their size, number, or distribution. Together with the time-lapse results, this indicates that the molecular mechanism of CIDEA is composed of three discrete phases: LD targeting, LD\u2013LD docking, and LD growth."

In fact, the last 66 aas of CIDEA were sufficient for LD localization, as shown with the expression of CIDEA-(152\u2013217)-v5, whereas it lacked the ability to facilitate the docking of LDs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2C</a> and <a href=\"#fig4\">4A</a>). Although it is known that the C-term domain of CIDE proteins is essential for LD localization and enlargement (<a href=\"#bib42\">Liu et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Christianson et al., 2010</a>), only the structure of the N-term domain has been solved (<a href=\"#bib43\">Lugovskoy et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Wang et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Sun et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Lee et al., 2013</a>). The CIDE-N domain (Pfam reference PF02017) has been determined in members of the CIDE family (PBD Codes: 2eel (hCIDEA), 1D4B (hCIDEB), 4MAC (mCIDEC), 4ikg (mCIDEC)) to aas 40\u2013117, 34\u2013100, and 41\u2013118 in hCIDEA, hCIDEB, and mCIDEC, respectively. Thus, the sequence 163\u2013180 that we found essential for LD\u00a0targeting (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>) lacks direct structural information to date. We therefore predicted its structure using in silico approaches. The region displayed high probability of a helical conformation with a strongly amphipathic character (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>, and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). To experimentally confirm the presence of an amphipathic helix in the LD-targeting domain of CIDEA, circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy was used to estimate the secondary structure of a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 158\u2013185 in CIDEA. The CD spectra in the presence of 0.1% n-dodecyl-\u03b2-D-maltopyranoside confirmed the presence of \u03b1-helical structure (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>)."

While HA-(1\u2013120)-CIDEA showed no LD localization and had no effect on LD distribution or size, HA-CIDEA-(1\u2013117)-(163\u2013180) was partially localized on the LD surface and promoted LD clustering (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). Furthermore, the deletion of this C-term sequence in CIDEA-\u25b3(163\u2013179)-v5 completely eliminated LD localization in most of the cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,C</a>), confirming its role in LD targeting. However, partial LD localization could be observed in a small percentage of cells, together with the presence of LD clusters. This was also observed in CIDEA-\u25b3(162\u2013197)-v5 and was particularly frequent in CIDEA-(N172X)-v5, which contains a deletion in the middle of the helix. In contrast, no LD\u00a0targeting could be observed for the N-term fragment alone (1\u2013118\u00a0aa) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). This may indicate that other regions in C-term may contribute to LD localization either by directly binding the LD membrane or by interacting with other LD proteins. Similarly, LD targeting was compromised when the amphipathic character of the helix was disrupted in CIDEA-(F166R/V169R/L170R)-v5 by introducing cationic aas in its hydrophobic face. Although LD localization was only lost in a small percentage of cells, in the remaining cells the LD staining was accompanied by a predominantly cytosolic localization (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2C</a> and <a href=\"#fig3\">3E</a>). In contrast, the predominant LD localization of wild type (wt) CIDEA was maintained in CIDEA-(K167E/R171E/R175E)-v5, which presents a charge inversion of the helix but maintains its amphipathic properties (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2C</a> and <a href=\"#fig4\">3E</a>)."

As histidine has a lower pKa value than arginine and lysine, it can carry a positive charge depending on the pH and local environment, which could explain the activity retained by this protein."

However, the residual interaction still detectable by co-IP could sustain the LD-docking activity, as cells expressing this construct displayed normal LD clustering (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>). CIDEA-(152\u2013217)-v5 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig4\">4A</a>), which showed no LD clustering and lacked both the 126\u2013155 interaction site and the N-term domain, displayed a further reduction on the co-IP signal (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Therefore, trans complexes through N-term dimerization would be responsible for the LD clusters and weak co-IP signal observed in CIDEA-(126\u2013155)-v5. The lack of co-IP between the N-term fragment and the full-length CIDEA could be due to conformational and positional factors favouring the interaction between the HA-tagged full-length proteins in the LD or between the cytosolic v5-tagged N-term fragments. In fact, co-IP between N-term fragments of CIDEC was previously reported (<a href=\"#bib60\">Sun et al., 2013</a>). This interaction could be disrupted with the point mutations E87Q/D88N or R55E as predicted by the crystal structure of the N-term fragment, which reveals the formation of homodimers in which the positively charged R46, R55, and R56 in one molecule interact with negative residues in the other (E87 and D88) (<a href=\"#bib60\">Sun et al., 2013</a>). Interestingly, we found that the equivalent mutations in CIDEA (E79Q/D80N and R47E) impaired LD docking, while R47Q and R47A, which would not create repulsions between the interacting domains, did not affect CIDEA activity (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Taken together, these results suggest that both the C-term dimerization site (126\u2013155) and the N-term domain of CIDEA can contribute to LD\u2013LD docking by forming complexes with its counterparts on the adjacent LD."

In fact, whereas deletion of the N-term domain of CIDEA blocks LD enlargement (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>), it has been described that the C-term fragment of CIDEC retains its activity (<a href=\"#bib21\">Gong et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Jambunathan et al., 2011</a>). Here we show that similar to CIDEA, the N-term of CIDEC is involved in LD\u2013LD docking, as its deletion increases the fraction of cells displaying isolated LDs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). However, in the cells where the C-term of CIDEC could effectively induce LD\u2013LD docking, large LDs were observed instead of LD clusters, showing that although its docking efficiency is reduced, this region of CIDEC is sufficient for docking and enlarging the LDs. This differs from CIDEA, in which the C-term fragment cannot induce LD enlargement despite retaining a partial LD docking activity. In addition to the intrinsic differences between CIDEC and CIDEA, their activity could be affected by the interaction with additional proteins. While PLIN1 interacts with CIDEC, but not CIDEA, and potentiates its activity (<a href=\"#bib60\">Sun et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Grahn et al., 2013</a>), we have observed that CIDEA interacts with PLIN5 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>), which is rich in BAT (<a href=\"#bib29\">Harms and Seale, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Zhou et al., 2003</a>). In addition to PLIN5, CIDEA showed high affinity for both CIDEB and CIDEC, while it did not co-IP with DFF40 or DFF45, which share homology with the N-term domain of CIDE proteins (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). As BAT cells express high levels of both CIDEA and CIDEC, the formation of CIDE heterocomplexes could be involved in the regulation of LD enlargement to retain the multilocular state."

The interaction with phosphatidic acid (PA) was of particular interest, as increased levels of this phospholipid have been linked with LD fusion (<a href=\"#bib19\">Fei et al., 2011</a>) and the identification of enzymes such as AGPAT3 and LIPIN-1\u03b3 in LDs supports the existence of in situ generation and consumption of PA (<a href=\"#bib69\">Wilfling et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Wang et al., 2011</a>). PA binding was confirmed by the strong affinity of CIDEA-v5 for PA\u00a0beads (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>), which was greatly reduced by pre-incubation of the lysate with soluble PA, but not phosphatidylcholine (PC). Although the N-term fragment showed some residual affinity, the main PA-binding site of CIDEA was in the C-term region containing the amphipathic helix (163\u2013180) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). The charge inversion of its three cationic amino acids resulted in the loss of affinity for PA\u00a0beads in the inactive mutant (K167E/R171E/R175E)-CIDEA-v5 without affecting its LD localization (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>), linking PA\u00a0binding with the TAG-transference step (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>)."

The triple-E replacement mutant was also able to bind this LD, and even the F166R/L169R/V169R mutant was now able to interact with the membrane (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>). This result fits well with the CD results where the addition of PA also rescued the helix induction in this mutant peptide through interaction with the liposomes (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). Interestingly, while the presence of PA permitted the accommodation of the F166R/L169R/V169R helix in the LD monolayer, it could not penetrate as deep towards the TAG core as the wt or helix. The average distance of the peptide to the centre of the LD ( \u00b1 SEM) was 5.6 \u00b1 0.04 nm and 5.7 \u00b1 0.03 nm for wt and K167E/R171E/R175E, respectively. In the presence of PA, the distance was 5.6 \u00b1 0.02 nm, 5.7 \u00b1 0.02 nm, and 6.1 \u00b1 0.02 for wt, K167E/R171E/R175E, and F166R/L169R/V169R, respectively (also see <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G, H</a>). This result confirms that the presence of the hydrophobic face was necessary for proper helix insertion in the LD monolayer."

We observed that TAG molecules were able to escape the LD core and were integrated in the hydrophobic section of the membrane (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5H</a>). This TAG infiltration was increased after the docking of the wt helix in the membrane (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), suggesting that CIDEA could promote the migration of TAG into the membrane as an intermediate state prior to the transference to the acceptor LD. To complete the transference, the hydrophobic TAG molecules should overcome the energy barrier constituted by the phospholipid polar heads and water molecules in the LD\u2013LD interface. Interestingly, we observed that the wt helix could attract PA molecules in its vicinity by the interaction of its cationic residues with the negatively charged polar head of PA (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5H</a>). A direct interaction of the amphipathic helix with PA was also indicated by molecular docking using Autodock Vina, which supported the role of the K167, R171, and R175 residues in the interaction (<a href=\"#fig5s4\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). Remarkably, CG-MD simulations showed that whereas the non-amphipathic cationic helix F166R/L169R/V169R also interacted with PA molecules from its superficial docking position in the LD membrane, the anionic amphipathic mutant K167E/R171E/R175E was docked in a PA-depleted area and avoided the PA molecules (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5H</a>). Although TAG infiltration was also observed in this simulation and the helix was well embedded in the membrane, its inability to attract PA molecules could be responsible for the lack of TAG transference activity in CIDEA-(K167E/R171E/R175)-v5 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). Taken together, these results indicate that CIDEA binds the LD by embedding a cationic amphipathic helix into the LD monolayer and that once there, it can interact with PA molecules, which could facilitate TAG transference."

Certain mutations in the dimerization sites that do not eliminate the interaction result in a decrease of the TAG transference efficiency, reflected by the presence of small LDs docked to enlarged LDs. This suggests that in addition to stabilizing the LD\u2013LD interaction, the correct conformation of the CIDEA complexes is necessary for optimal TAG transfer. Furthermore, the formation of stable LD pairs is not sufficient to trigger LD fusion by lipid transfer. In fact, although LDs can be tightly packed in cultured adipocytes, no TAG transference across neighbour LDs is observed in the absence of CIDE proteins (<a href=\"#bib21\">Gong et al., 2011</a>), showing that the phospholipid monolayer acts as a barrier impermeable to TAG. Our CG-MD simulations indicate that certain TAG molecules can escape the neutral lipid core of the LD and be integrated within the aliphatic chains of the phospholipid monolayer. This could be a transition state prior to the TAG transference, and our data indicate that the docking of the amphipathic helix in the LD membrane could facilitate this process. However, the infiltrated TAGs in LD membranes in the presence of mutant helices, or even in the absence of docking, suggests that this is not enough to complete the TAG transference."

PA, whose requirement is indicated by our PA-depletion experiments, is a cone-shaped anionic phospholipid that could locally destabilize the LD monolayer by favouring a negative membrane curvature that is incompatible with the spherical LD morphology (<a href=\"#bib36\">Kooijman et al., 2005</a>). Interestingly, while the zwitterion PC, the main component of the monolayer, stabilizes the LD structure (<a href=\"#bib37\">Krahmer et al., 2011</a>), the negatively charged PA promotes their coalescence (<a href=\"#bib19\">Fei et al., 2011</a>). This is supported by our CG-MD results which resulted in a deformation of the LD shape by the addition of PA. We propose a model in which the C-term amphipathic helix positions itself in the LD monolayer and interacts with PA molecules in its vicinity, which might include trans interactions with PA in the adjacent LD. The interaction with PA disturbs the integrity of the phospholipid barrier at the LD\u2013LD interface, allowing the LD to LD transference of TAG molecules integrated in the LD membrane (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). Additional alterations in the LD composition could facilitate TAG transference, as differentiating adipocytes experience a reduction in saturated fatty acids in the LD phospholipids (<a href=\"#bib3\">Arisawa et al., 2013</a>), and in their PC/PE ratio (<a href=\"#bib33\">H\u00f6rl et al., 2011</a>), which could increase the permeability of the LD membranes; we previously observed that a change in the molecular structures of TAG results in an altered migration pattern to the LD surface (<a href=\"#bib48\">Mohammadyani et al., 2014</a>)."

However, the implication of PA, a minor component of the LD membrane, could represent a control mechanism, as it is plausible that the cell could actively influence the TAG flux direction by differently regulating the levels of PA in large and small LDs, which could be controlled by the activity of enzymes such as AGPAT3 and LIPIN-1\u03b3 (<a href=\"#bib69\">Wilfling et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Wang et al., 2011</a>). This is a remarkable possibility, as a switch in the favoured TAG flux direction could promote the acquisition of a multilocular phenotype and facilitate the browning of WAT (<a href=\"#bib5\">Barneda et al., 2013</a>). Interestingly, Cidea mRNA is the LD protein-encoding transcript that experiences the greatest increase during the cold-induced process by which multilocular BAT-like cells appear in WAT (<a href=\"#bib5\">Barneda et al., 2013</a>). Furthermore, in BAT, cold exposure instigates a profound increase in CIDEA protein levels that is independent of transcriptional regulation (<a href=\"#bib73\">Yu et al., 2015</a>). The profound increase in CIDEA is coincident with elevated lipolysis and de novo lipogenesis that occurs in both brown and white adipose tissues after \u03b2-adrenergic receptor activation (<a href=\"#bib50\">Mottillo et al., 2014</a>). It is likely that CIDEA has a central role in coupling these processes to package newly synthesized TAG in LDs for subsequent lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation. Importantly, BAT displays high levels of glycerol kinase activity (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bertin, 1976</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Bertin et al., 1984</a>) that facilitates glycerol recycling rather than release into the blood stream, following induction of lipolysis (<a href=\"#bib51\">Portet et al., 1974</a>), which occurs in WAT. Hence, the reported elevated glycerol released from cells depleted of CIDEA (<a href=\"#bib74\">Zhou et al., 2003</a>) is likely to be a result of decoupling lipolysis from the ability to efficiently store the products of lipogenesis in LDs, therefore producing a net increase in detected extracellular glycerol. This important role of CIDEA is supported by the marked depletion of TAG in the BAT of Cidea-null mice following overnight exposure to a temperature of 4\u00b0C (<a href=\"#bib74\">Zhou et al., 2003</a>) and by our finding that CIDEA-dependent LD enlargement is maintained in a lipase-negative yeast strain."

The induction of a brown-like phenotype in WAT has potential benefits in the treatment and prevention of metabolic disorders (<a href=\"#bib68\">Whittle et al., 2013</a>). Differences in the activity and regulation of CIDEC and CIDEA could also be responsible for the adoption of unilocular or multilocular phenotypes. In addition to their differential interaction with PLIN1 and 5, we have observed that CIDEC is more resilient to the deletion of the N-term than CIDEA, indicating that it may be less sensitive to regulatory post-translational modifications of this domain. This robustness of CIDEC activity together with its potentiation by PLIN1 could facilitate the continuity of the LD enlargement in white adipocytes until the unilocular phenotype is achieved. In contrast, in brown adipocytes expressing CIDEA the process would be stopped at the multilocular stage, for example, due to post-translational modifications that modulate the function or stability of the protein or alteration of the PA levels in LDs."

This protein complex will be anchored in the LD\u2013LD interface, forming the molecular environment necessary for TAG transport across the membrane. Finally, the amphipathic helix embedded in the LD membrane interacts with the cone-shaped phospholipid PA, generating a local perturbation of the monolayer integrity that would increase its permeability to TAG and enable its exportation to the acceptor LD. The new mechanistic insight into the molecular events underpinning LD dynamics revealed by this study highlights CIDEA and PA production as targets for therapeutic modulation of LD accumulation."

It is important to emphasise that we are not claiming that CIDEA only binds PA as in this paper we show that it can interact with other phospholipids such as cardiolipin or phosphatidylinositol phosphates. We have focused on PA due to its suggested role in modulating membrane dynamics to facilitate LD enlargement and the recent identification in LDs of enzymes that generate and consume PA (AGPAT3 and LIPIN-1\u03b3). Importantly, our data unequivocally demonstrate that CIDEA can interact with PA and that the presence of PA is necessary for CIDEA activity. PA depletion in yeast and mammalian cell models prevents LD enlargement without affecting the LD localization of CIDEA, and we demonstrate that the amphipathic helix is essential for PA-binding and LD enlargement, as its disruption by truncation of the protein or amino acid substitutions results in the prevention of both processes. Finally, the additional CG-MD simulations of the PA-helix interaction in the context of the LD membrane have been utilized to clarify the potential role of PA in the molecular mechanism of CIDEA action (detailed in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>)."

In contrast, as the CD assay proved a useful tool to analyse the interaction of the amphipathic helix with membranes (regardless of the presence of PA), we decided to analyse the effect of amino acid substitutions impairing LD targeting. In view of the previous results with CIDEA-(L169R/V170R)-v5, we added CIDEA-(F166R/L169R/V170R)-v5 to the LD phenotype analysis, observing impaired LD binding.

Importantly, these data provide experimental evidence that our in silico analysis based on the 18-aa helix is a valid approach to model the interaction of CIDEA with the LD membranes."

The reviewer is correct in noting the charges, and these have been omitted in the new simulations.

The Co-IP is a reliable assay for determination of protein-protein interactions. Other assays such as GST pulldowns would not reveal additional mechanistic insight into the protein-protein interactions we have demonstrated. The dimerization of the N-term fragments of CIDE proteins had been previously characterized by NMR, X-ray crystallography, co-IP, and gel filtration assays, as referenced in the manuscript. The novelty of our approach is the combination of the co-IP data, to test the existence of interactions with the LD-LD docking analysis. This has provided the functional demonstration of the hypothesized role of CIDEA-CIDEA interactions in LD-LD docking, and has revealed that both the N-term and C-term dimerization sites can contribute to this process. To achieve this goal, our cell culture model was optimized to reduce the presence of spontaneous LD clusters to facilitate the study of CIDEA-induced LD clustering by the identification of LD-LD docking defective mutants. Numerous endogenous LD clusters are observed in undifferentiated 3T3-L1 cells, which have been previously used for functional studies on CIDE proteins. In contrast, our Hela cells contained few LDs in basal conditions, and LD formation was induced by BSA-oleate treatment 24 hours after transfection. The newly formed LDs were dispersed thorough the cytoplasm and were targeted by the different CIDEA constructs already present, which could promote their docking and enlargement during a short period of time before fixation (18 hours). This experimental setting largely prevented the LD-LD docking activity by endogenous LD proteins, allowing the disclosure of LD-LD docking defective CIDEA mutants."
