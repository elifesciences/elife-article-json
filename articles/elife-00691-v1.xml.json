How these phosphorylations affect the structure and enzymatic function of PTEN is poorly understood. To gain insight into the mechanistic basis of PTEN regulation by phosphorylation, we generated semisynthetic site-specifically tetra-phosphorylated PTEN using expressed protein ligation. By employing a combination of biophysical and enzymatic approaches, we have found that purified tail-phosphorylated PTEN relative to its unphosphorylated counterpart shows reduced catalytic activity and membrane affinity and undergoes conformational compaction likely involving an intramolecular interaction between its C-tail and the C2 domain. Our results suggest that there is a competition between membrane phospholipids and PTEN phospho-tail for binding to the C2 domain. These findings reveal a key aspect of PTEN\u2019s regulation and suggest pharmacologic approaches for direct PTEN activation."

How these phosphorylations affect the structure and enzymatic function of PTEN is poorly understood. To gain insight into the mechanistic basis of PTEN regulation by phosphorylation, we generated semisynthetic site-specifically tetra-phosphorylated PTEN using expressed protein ligation. By employing a combination of biophysical and enzymatic approaches, we have found that purified tail-phosphorylated PTEN relative to its unphosphorylated counterpart shows reduced catalytic activity and membrane affinity and undergoes conformational compaction likely involving an intramolecular interaction between its C-tail and the C2 domain. Our results suggest that there is a competition between membrane phospholipids and PTEN phospho-tail for binding to the C2 domain. These findings reveal a key aspect of PTEN\u2019s regulation and suggest pharmacologic approaches for direct PTEN activation."

The PTEN protein is believed to be regulated by a variety of mechanisms including post-translational modifications, protein\u2013protein interactions, and protein\u2013lipid interactions (<a href=\"#bib3\">Campbell et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Iijima et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Walker et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Vazquez et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Denning et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Chagpar et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Shenoy et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Song et al., 2012</a>). Previously mapped PTEN post-translational modifications include phosphorylation (<a href=\"#bib55\">Vazquez et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Torres and Pulido, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Miller et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Al-Kouri et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Cordier et al., 2012</a>), acetylation (<a href=\"#bib33\">Okumura et al., 2006</a>), ubiquitylation (<a href=\"#bib60\">Wang et al., 2007</a>), and sumoylation (<a href=\"#bib16\">Huang et al., 2012</a>). Phosphorylation of a cluster of Ser/Thr residues (Ser380, Thr382, Thr383, and Ser385) on PTEN\u2019s C-terminal tail have received considerable attention in studies on PTEN regulation and appears to be a major modification (<a href=\"#bib61\">Wu et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Vazquez et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Odriozola et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Rahdar et al., 2009</a>).

While the molecular mechanism of how this is achieved is uncertain, altered protein\u2013protein interactions (<a href=\"#bib61\">Wu et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Vazquez et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Sumitomo et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Takahashi et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">van Diepen et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Huang et al., 2012</a>) as well as conformational changes (<a href=\"#bib32\">Odriozola et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Rahdar et al., 2009</a>) in PTEN have been suggested to be induced by phosphorylation. It has been unclear if phosphorylation of PTEN has a direct effect on membrane association or is indirectly mediated through other macromolecular interactions. Most PTEN phosphorylation analyses have relied on cellular transfection experiments in which replacement of the Ser and Thr residues with Ala have been indirect indicators of phosphorylation function. However, Ser and Thr have different properties from Ala and such mutations may be misleading in deducing the action of a phosphoSer/phosphoThr (<a href=\"#bib55\">Vazquez et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Torres and Pulido, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Al-Khouri et al., 2005</a>). What has been lacking thus far is a biochemical analysis of purified phosphorylated PTEN in which the phosphorylation sites are well-defined in position and stoichiometry. Inherent challenges in obtaining this material include the difficulty in using kinases for introducing phosphates site-specifically into PTEN and the proposed potential for PTEN autodephosphorylation (<a href=\"#bib65\">Zhang et al., 2012</a>). To circumvent these issues, we employ here expressed protein ligation, a method for protein semisynthesis (<a href=\"#bib40\">Schwarzer and Cole, 2005</a>), for generating 380,382,383,385-tetraphosphorylated-PTEN (4p-PTEN). Expressed protein ligation involves the production of a recombinant protein carrying a C-terminal thioester by exploiting the action of an intein, and its chemoselective ligation to an N-Cys containing synthetic peptide (<a href=\"#bib29\">Muir et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Vila-Perell\u00f3 and Muir, 2010</a>). Within the synthetic peptide, phosphoSer/phosphoThr can be installed using standard chemical techniques at specific locations. We show here that, relative to the unphosphorylated form, 4p-PTEN adopts a more compact conformation in which the C-tail appears to interact with the C2 domain in a fashion that reduces its affinity for lipid membranes and diminishes its catalytic activity."

Nevertheless, we found the presence of chitinase to be a surmountable issue by a chromatographic pre-clearing step with a bed of fibrous cellulose. We also found that High Five insect cells rather than the more typical SF9 insect cells were critical for robust expression.

As described in the \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 section, apparent V<sub>max</sub> and apparent K<sub>m</sub> values obtained from these experiments were fit to the equations in the \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 section associated with the equation below:"

As reported previously for unphosphorylated PTEN produced in <i>E. coli</i> (<a href=\"#bib26\">McConnachie et al., 2003</a>), we found that increasing levels of both phosphatidylserine (PS) and PIP<sub>2</sub> in vesicles positively influence PIP<sub>3</sub> dephosphorylation by both n-PTEN and 4p-PTEN (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure Supplement 3</a>). We next carried out a series of PTEN-vesicle binding assays using PIP<sub>2</sub> and PS as membrane targeting lipids by measuring differential sedimentation fractionation. These experiments demonstrated markedly reduced membrane binding for 4p-PTEN vs n-PTEN under all conditions tested (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Both n-PTEN and 4p-PTEN show proportionally greater binding to vesicles as concentrations of PIP<sub>2</sub> and PS are increased, but 4p-PTEN compared with n-PTEN requires a significantly higher concentration of anionic lipid to achieve a similar level of membrane sedimentation. For example, 7 mol% PIP<sub>2</sub> sedimented about one-fifth of 4p-PTEN, which was comparable to the amount of n-PTEN sedimented by 3 mol% PIP<sub>2</sub> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). With 5 mol% PS, the ratio of n-PTEN:4p-PTEN sedimented was about 10:1 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). These results corroborate the PTEN affinity differences observed in the phosphatase assays where C-tail phosphorylation of PTEN inhibited membrane binding."

In the course of purification of our semisynthetic PTENs by anion exchange chromatography, we made the paradoxical observation that the tetraphosphorylated PTEN reproducibly eluted at an earlier elution volume (\u223c70 ml and lower salt concentration, 90 mM NaCl) and more sharply relative to the unphosphorylated protein (\u223c100 ml, 140 mM NaCl) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Elution of n-PTEN as one large peak followed by multiple small peaks was attributed to minor heterogeneous insect cell-mediated phosphorylation in the recombinant tail moiety on and near Thr366 and Ser370 as detected with a site-specific Ab (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). A similar elution pattern was observed with t-PTEN (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). This heterogeneity is presumably collapsed under one peak in 4p-PTEN. Since 4p-PTEN has a nominal eight negative charge increase relative to n-PTEN, we were surprised that 4p-PTEN showed decreased affinity to cationic resin. One explanation for this result is that, relative to n-PTEN, 4p-PTEN undergoes a conformational change which buries its negatively charged C-tail, reducing its availability for interacting with cationic resin. The fact that clusters of charges can be more important than overall charge for protein\u2013ion exchange resin interactions has been discussed previously (<a href=\"#bib5\">Chung et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Hou et al., 2010</a>)."

Serendipitously, we found that freeze-thawing dilute 4p-PTEN led to apparent denaturation of the protein since it was much more susceptible to alkaline phosphatase catalyzed dephosphorylation of the tail phosphate cluster. Under the same conditions, near complete dephosphorylation was observed within 7.5 min. To more precisely determine this rate, we cut in half the concentration of alkaline phosphatase, and assumed that this process follows a pseudo-first-order kinetic mechanism. In this way, we estimate that native 4p-PTEN vs denatured 4p-PTEN shows a 25-fold reduced rate of alkaline phosphatase-catalyzed dephosphorylation of the tail phospho cluster (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>).

The shape of the pair distance distribution function p(r) plot for n-PTEN reveals a single hump with a large shoulder region at higher r values (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). The shoulder region is indicative of a protein with an elongated shape (<a href=\"#bib36\">Putnam et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Jacques and Trewhella, 2012</a>), possibly due to the presence of the extended tail.

                                "text": "Based on prior models as well as the proteolysis and SAXS experiments, we constructed several mutant semisynthetic PTENs to investigate possible PTEN residues that contribute to the closed conformation of 4p-PTEN (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Semisynthetic phospho- and unphosphorylated PTEN containing four mutations K13A, R14A, R15A, and R161A (\u2018N-mutant\u2019) was constructed to test the possibility that these basic residues in the N-terminus, co-localized in the crystal structure and implicated in phospholipid binding, might be critical in stabilizing the closed 4p-PTEN conformation. We also generated the penta-mutant unphosphorylated and phosphorylated PTENs containing K260A/K263A/K266A/K267A/K269A (\u2018A5-mutant\u2019) and K260D/K263D/K266D/K267D/K269D (\u2018D5-mutant\u2019) as neutral and charge inverted forms that probe the importance of the CBRIII loop in the C2 domain to conformational constriction. A fourth construct of semisynthetic PTEN that included deletions in the N-terminus (aa 1\u20136), D-loop (aa 286\u2013309), and C-terminus (aa 395\u2013403, and also contained T366A/S370A), (\u2018X-mutant\u2019) was prepared to facilitate comparisons to the crystallized form of PTEN which possessed the same N-terminal and \u2018D-loop\u2019 deletions (<a href=\"#bib22\">Lee et al., 1999</a>). These semisynthetic PTEN mutants were generated analogously to that of n-PTEN and 4p-PTEN. Anion exchange chromatography showed the same paradoxical behavior for the phosphorylated forms of the N-mutant, A5-mutant, and X-mutant PTENs with faster than expected elution of these semisynthetic proteins. Of note, elution of the unligated X-mutant PTEN on anion exchange chromatography sharpened to a single peak compared to the broader distribution of unligated wt PTEN (t-PTEN), presumably because mutation of Thr366/Ser370 abolishes the phosphorylation events that lead to heterogeneity (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Moreover, N-mutant, A5-mutant, and X-mutant 4p-PTEN proteins showed nearly identical rates of dephosphorylation by alkaline phosphatase relative to wt 4p-PTEN indicating that they are each in the same \u223c25:1 equilibrium favoring the closed conformation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3</a>)."

With respect to anion exchange chromatography, D5 mutant 4p-PTEN eluted broadly with much of the protein eluting at higher NaCl concentrations than the unphosphorylated D5 mutant (<a href=\"#fig6s4\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). Later elution is the expected profile for a typical phosphorylated protein relative to an unphosphorylated protein compared with the paradoxical pattern for n- and 4p- semisynthetic PTENs. In addition, D5 mutant 4p-PTEN was dephosphorylated about eightfold faster than the native wt 4p-PTEN and only threefold slower than denatured wt 4p-PTEN, implying that the tail phosphate cluster is dramatically more exposed in the D5 mutant (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure Supplement 3</a>). We considered the possibility that Asp substitutions of the Lys residues in the D5 mutant led to overall protein destabilization and denaturation. However, D5- mutant 4p-PTEN readily processed soluble PIP<sub>3</sub> substrate, \u223cthreefold faster than wt and A5-mutant 4p-PTENs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Moreover, the D5-mutant 4p-PTEN phosphatase activity showed saturation with soluble PIP<sub>3</sub> (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>), with catalytic parameters approaching those of n-PTEN, consistent with a more open conformation than that of wt 4p-PTEN. Taken together, these results make clear that the penta-Asp substitutions in the CBRIII loop are non-denaturing but can significantly disrupt the closed conformation of 4p-PTEN, presumably by electrostatic repulsion of the anionic tail. As reported previously (<a href=\"#bib3\">Campbell et al., 2003</a>), the activity of the N-mutant which contains mutations of K13, R14, and R15 to alanine, is reduced compared to wt (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s5\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 5</a>)."

In this assay, t-PTEN showed similar behavior to n-PTEN, with saturable kinetics as a function of soluble PIP<sub>3</sub> (compare <a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 7B and 2A</a>). Of note, the C-tail phosphopeptide 4p-25mer, but not the unphosphorylated peptide n-25mer, was a potent inhibitor of t-PTEN soluble PIP<sub>3</sub> phosphatase activity with an IC<sub>50</sub> \u223c 1 \u03bcM (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). In the presence of 1 \u03bcM 4p-25mer, the t-PTEN phosphatase activity showed an increase in K<sub>m</sub> for soluble PIP<sub>3</sub> (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>), mimicking the behavior of 4p-PTEN. Strikingly, the D5 mutant form of t-PTEN was resistant to the inhibition by 4p-25mer at concentrations up to 10 \u03bcM of the peptide (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). Analogous to its effects on t-PTEN phosphatase activity, 4p-25mer but not n-25mer inhibited t-PTEN binding to PIP<sub>2</sub> vesicles, although less potently presumably because of competition for binding surfaces on the body of PTEN between the vesicle lipids and the 4p-25mer tail peptide (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). Taken together, these experiments reveal that the intermolecular effects of the C-tail phosphopeptide on the PTEN body resemble those proposed for the intramolecular conformational change in 4p-PTEN."

The SAXS results suggest that phospho-tail is in close proximity to the C2 domain. Replacement of the PTEN Lys cluster of the CBRIII loop with Asp residues (5D mutant) but not Ala residues (5A mutant) in 4p-PTEN renders the phospho-tail more susceptible to alkaline phosphatase hydrolysis, presumably because the anionic phosphate tail clashes with the Asp carboxylate negative charges. The intermolecular effects of the 4p-25mer C-tail on the t-PTEN body and their reduced sensitivity conferred by CBRIII loop mutation further corroborate the phospho-tail\u2013C2 interaction. Prior studies suggest that the five clustered Lys residues of the CBRIII loop are found on the membrane binding surface of the C2 domain, and their mutation decreases PTEN binding to lipid vesicles in vitro and plasma membranes in cell transfection experiments (<a href=\"#bib22\">Lee et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">McConnachie et al., 2003</a>)."

Our best evidence against the possibility that conformationally closed 4p-PTEN binds membrane is that the interfacial K<sub>m</sub>s (i<i>K</i><sub>m</sub>s) for 4p-PTEN, n-PTEN, and t-PTEN are all the same, within error, in dephosphorylating vesicle-bound PIP<sub>3</sub> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). Since the K<sub>m</sub>s for soluble PIP<sub>3</sub> dephosphorylation are different for 4p-PTEN and n-PTEN (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>), it would be surprising that the i<i>K</i><sub>m</sub>s would be the same if the conformation of 4p-PTEN were closed when bound to vesicle. It is plausible, however, that some closed 4p-PTEN with reduced membrane affinity is interacting with vesicle while in a catalytically impaired state, which would contribute only in a minor way to the i<i>K</i><sub>m</sub>. Nevertheless, we also know how important the CBRIII loop is for membrane binding which, as discussed above, is likely abutting the phospho-tail in the closed conformation.

It is interesting that the soluble PIP<sub>3</sub> K<sub>m</sub> for 4p-PTEN vs n-PTEN is elevated whereas the interfacial K<sub>m</sub> (i<i>K</i><sub>m</sub>) with vesicles containing PIP<sub>3</sub> is the same for both enzyme forms. Both the trypsin protease pattern and SAXS analysis of 4p-PTEN vs n-PTEN reveal apparent structural/dynamic changes within the catalytic domain upon phosphorylation that may account for the altered phosphatase properties. Such conformational changes in the catalytic domain upon phosphorylation may come from direct interactions with the tail, though they could also be transmitted allosterically through tail-C2 binding since the C2 domain makes intimate contacts with the catalytic domain. It should be noted that the CBRIII loop, while critical for vesicle interaction, is dispensable for soluble PIP<sub>3</sub> substrate processing, as shown here and previously (<a href=\"#bib26\">McConnachie et al., 2003</a>).

However, in contrast to the findings here, the co-immunoprecipitation of the PTEN tail and body was disrupted by the altered residues in the N-mutant and A5-mutant PTENs. Since the N-mutant and A5-mutant 4p-PTENs showed the same apparent closed equilibrium constant as wt 4p-PTEN, this suggests that there may be differences in this trans interaction identified in mammalian cell extracts vs the closed conformation of the intact 4p-PTEN molecule analyzed in the current study. Indeed, we found higher than expected apparent affinity between the 4p-25mer and the t-PTEN body (IC<sub>50</sub> 1 \u03bcM) and more complete inhibition (&gt;95%) of the lipid phosphatase activity of t-PTEN by the 4p-25mer with soluble PIP<sub>3</sub> substrate than would be predicted based on results with 4p-PTEN (4p-PTEN:n-PTEN activity was \u223c6:1). The \u223c25:1 equilibrium favoring the closed conformation of 4p-PTEN based on alkaline phosphatase susceptibility seems relatively small compared with an apparent K<sub>d</sub> of \u223c1 \u03bcM for the 4p-25mer-t-PTEN intermolecular interaction. Such results may suggest structural differences in the intermolecular complex vs the intramolecular conformational change. While there are several plausible explanations for this, one interesting possibility is that there may be energetic strain associated with achieving conformational closure in the intramolecular case of 4p-PTEN not associated with a phospho-tail\u2013t-PTEN intermolecular interaction."

Each of these examples involves an SH2 domain interacting with a phosphotyrosine. We propose a Src-like model for PTEN, in which a cluster of pSer/pThr drives an apparently long distance intramolecular binding interaction to deactivate the enzyme. How 4p-PTEN may be reactivated in vivo remains an important question. There are presumably cellular phosphatase enzymes that can dephosphorylate phospho-PTEN or ligands which can bind allosterically to phospho-PTEN that may promote conformational opening. In contrast to prior suggestions based on trans experiments, we see no evidence of the autodephosphorylation of 4p-PTEN (<a href=\"#bib65\">Zhang et al., 2012</a>). As we are reliant on western blots with an antibody that may recognize states of depleted phosphorylation of the tail, partial autodephosphorylation cannot be completely ruled out by our experiments. However, the stability of the closed conformation of 4p-PTEN over the dozens of hours of expressed protein ligation points to resistance of the tail phosphates to PTEN enzymatic removal. Because of the structural concealment of the 380\u20135 phosphoSer/Thr residues in the closed 4p-PTEN conformation, such autodephosphorylation may be especially disfavored."

Altered protein\u2013protein interactions or efficiency of ubiquitylation may be influenced by phosphorylation-mediated conformational closure of phospho-PTEN. While PTEN is a tumor suppressor and can be mutated in cancer, it is often wild type but expressed at low levels. Direct stimulation of cellular phospho-PTEN by pharmacologic agents could prove to be effective as an anti-cancer therapy. A related approach has been explored to activate the tumor suppressor p53 (<a href=\"#bib10\">Foster et al., 1999</a>) and the apoptotic protein procaspase (<a href=\"#bib12\">Gray et al., 2010</a>). It may be possible to find small molecules that bind specifically to the phospho-tail and prevent its intramolecular engagement with the C2 domain or bind somewhere on the PTEN body and stabilize the open PTEN conformation allosterically. The soluble PIP<sub>3</sub> substrate dephosphorylation assay with 4p-PTEN should provide a means for screening for such activators. Alternatively, inhibitors of CK2 and/or GSK3\u03b2 protein kinase, the enzymes responsible for PTEN C-tail phosphorylation, may be effective in targeting PIP<sub>3</sub>/Akt-driven tumors."

The chitin bead column with fusion protein bound was then washed with 250 ml of washing buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.6, 250 mM NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100). C-terminally truncated PTEN (t-PTEN) was generated by DTT cleavage of the fusion protein, producing t-PTEN at yields of \u223c8\u201310 mg per liter of cell culture. Full length semisynthetic PTEN was then generated on the chitin column by adding 400 mM MESNA and 2 mM of C-terminal peptide buffered with 3 ml of 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.2), 150 mM NaCl. Based on the post ligation yield of PTEN protein it is estimated that there is a maximum PTEN-thioester concentration of \u223c80 \u03bcM in the ligation reaction. The ligation reactions were carried out for 48\u201372 hr at room temperature and monitored by SDS PAGE.

Lipids were sonicated in 100 \u03bcl volumes in glass test tubes at room temperature until the solution clarified. Vesicles made in this way are 30\u201350 nm in diameter. Vesicles were used in assays within 15 min of being made. In assay reactions, the ratio of the number of vesicles to the number of PTEN molecules was maintained at 4:1 or greater. Ovalbumin (0.05 mg/ml) was used to stabilize the PTEN protein in the assays. 25 \u03bcl reactions were initiated by the addition of vesicle substrate and incubated at 30\u00b0C for 3 min. The reaction was quenched with 3 M perchloric acid. Hydrolyzed <sup>32</sup>P<sub>i</sub> was then separated from <sup>32</sup>P-PIP<sub>3</sub> by a Bligh\u2013Dyer extraction. The aqueous phase was then treated with 1% ammonium molybdate and the resulting phosphate\u2013molybdate complex was extracted with toluene:isobutanol (1:1). This organic phase was then counted using a Beckman scintillation counter."

In order to argue that autoinhibition works by interfering with lipid binding, evidence would be needed showing that (3) the phospho-C-terminal peptide interacts with the lipid-binding interface, and (4) that conservative mutations at the lipid-binding interface interfere with peptide binding and relieve autoinhibition of 4p-PTEN.

We understood that the major missing piece from the reviewers\u2019 perspective relates to whether the C-tail phosphopeptide of PTEN can act in trans to impact the lipid phosphatase activity of the body of PTEN (t-PTEN). We have now performed the key experiments that address this concern. In brief, the results are fully consistent with the (new) <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a> model. We have found that t-PTEN shows similar enzymatic activity to n-PTEN with the soluble PIP<sub>3</sub> substrate. C-tail phosphopeptide potently inhibited t-PTEN lipid phosphatase activity with soluble PIP<sub>3</sub> and t-PTEN binding activity to PIP<sub>2</sub> containing-lipid vesicles, whereas the unphosphorylated C-tail had no effect in the same concentration range. Moreover, the C2 domain mutant form of t-PTEN (D5 t-PTEN, which contains mutations on the membrane binding CBRIII loop) was resistant to the catalytic inhibition effects of C-tail phosphopeptide, consistent with the model that a principal functional interaction between the body and phospho-tail involves the lipid binding interface of the C2 domain. In addition, we have also performed a more complete analysis of the substrate concentration dependence of the 5D mutant of 4p-PTEN lipid phosphatase activity, and these results fortify the interpretation of the regulatory implications of this mutant. These data and a related discussion are now added to the revised manuscript (new <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a> and new <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). We think the inclusion of these results significantly strengthens the manuscript and establishes a modular structural interaction for phospho-PTEN. Below we delineate our point-by-point responses to the reviewers\u2019 comments and describe the accompanying changes in the revised manuscript."

Since these CBRIII loop Lys residues mutated in the D5 4p-PTEN mutant are crucial for membrane binding, it seems likely that the structure and functional changes by mutation and phosphorylation are linked, as depicted in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>."

As discussed previously, the critical micellar concentration (CMC) of diC6 PIP<sub>3</sub> is greater than 1 mM, significantly higher than the concentrations used in this study (<a href=\"#bib3\">Campbell et al. 2003</a>). The mechanism of PTEN interaction with soluble substrate is at least somewhat distinct from the way PTEN interacts with vesicles, since the Lys residues of the C2 domain CBRIII loop are dispensable for efficient catalysis with soluble substrate, as first shown by Peter Downes and colleagues (<a href=\"#bib26\">McConnachie et al. 2003</a>), but they are important for vesicle binding and tumor suppressive ability (<a href=\"#bib22\">Lee et al. 1999</a>, <a href=\"#bib26\">McConnachie et al. 2003</a>, <a href=\"#bib41\">Shenoy et al. 2012</a>, Shenoy et al. 2013).

Thus, we do not see a large benefit in trying to saturate the 4p-PTEN velocity versus soluble substrate concentration plot in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>. We do think that <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a> and soluble substrate assays add value to the manuscript because they: 1) show that the catalytic domain of PTEN is at least subtly altered in the closed conformation of 4p-PTEN relative to n-PTEN; 2) suggest that when 4p-PTEN binds vesicles, it opens, since the i<i>K</i><sub>m</sub> of 4p-PTEN matches that of n-PTEN and t-PTEN; 3) provide a convenient method for distinguishing open and closed forms that help substantiate the more open state of the D5 4p-PTEN; 4) could ultimately be used for high throughput screening for allosteric activators of 4p-PTEN."

We were concerned that, by disconnecting the tail from the body, there can be unnatural interactions that may not be seen with the intact molecule, where the physical attachment may help to define the orientation and energetics of the tail binding to the body. Nevertheless, the reviewers\u2019 comments helped persuade us of the value of this complementary approach in illuminating whether the tail works as an autonomous module in regulating the body. Thus we have performed this series of experiments (i\u2013v) as suggested and have shown: i) the lipid phosphatase kinetics with soluble PIP<sub>3</sub> substrate t-PTEN are very similar to those of n-PTEN, ii) the C-tail phosphopeptide of PTEN potently inhibits t-PTEN lipid phosphatase activity with an IC50 of 1 \u03bcM, iii) the C-tail unphosphorylated peptide of PTEN has minimal effect on the enzymatic activity of t-PTEN, establishing the key role of the phosphate modifications, iv) the enzymatic activity of the D5 mutant of t-PTEN loses sensitivity to C-tail phosphopeptide, suggesting that the lipid-binding interface of the C2 domain is crucial to phosphopeptide interaction, v) addition of the C-tail phosphopeptide reduces t-PTEN binding to lipid vesicles. This additional set of experiments (shown as new <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>) is fully consistent with, and helps support the connection between a phosphotail-C2 interaction and the functional inhibition of enzymatic activity and lipid binding as posited in the <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a> model. Beyond helping to confirm the model in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>, these trans tail\u2013body experiments revealed some unexpected but interesting new aspects of the molecular recognition in phospho-PTEN. We did not anticipate the high apparent affinity of phosphopeptide tail binding to the PTEN body (ca. Kd 1 \u03bcM) based on the estimated 25:1 closed:open equilibrium measured in the alkaline phosphatase experiments with the intact 4p-PTEN. While there are several potential explanations for this high apparent affinity, one intriguing possibility is that adoption of the closed conformation of 4p-PTEN may be associated with energetic strain, a cost not incurred in the intermolecular system. Another unexpected finding was the nearly complete inhibition (&gt;95%) of t-PTEN enzymatic activity with 10 \u03bcM phosphopeptide, exceeding the apparent rate differential (6-fold) measured with 4p-PTEN vs. n-PTEN. There may be multiple reasons for this, but it is possible that the intermolecular binding event with 4p-PTEN pieces could result from structural interactions that are not thermodynamically accessible in the intramolecular case. Regardless, these additional findings should provide us and others with important topics for future investigation."

But, as mentioned above, we do not think this is central to the main conclusions of the manuscript, or the model in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>. While understanding how phosphorylation of PTEN affects the specific binding interaction of a soluble substrate to the PTEN active site may have some value, it is likely at least somewhat different from how the enzyme interacts with vesicle embedded phospholipid substrate. We believe that our original results and additional findings in the revised manuscript clearly demonstrate that the K<sub>m</sub> for soluble PIP<sub>3</sub> is increased by phosphorylation (and intramolecular conformational change) of PTEN, and this result is noteworthy regardless of whether k<sub>cat</sub> is also affected."
