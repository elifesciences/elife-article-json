Previously we have demonstrated that hPSC-derived human lung organoids (HLOs) resembled human fetal lung tissue <i>in vitro</i> (Dye et al. 2015). Here we show that HLOs required a bioartificial microporous Poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLG) scaffold niche for successful engraftment, long-term survival, and maturation of lung epithelium <i>in vivo</i>. Analysis of scaffold-grown transplanted tissue showed airway-like tissue with enhanced epithelial structure and organization compared to HLOs grown <i>in vitro</i>. By further comparing <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> grown HLOs with fetal and adult human lung tissue, we found that <i>in vivo</i> transplanted HLOs had improved cellular differentiation of secretory lineages that is reflective of differences between fetal and adult tissue, resulting in airway-like structures that were remarkably similar to the native adult human lung."
