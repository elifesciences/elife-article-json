Initiation of HR in the G1 phase blocks non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) impairing DSB repair. Completion of HR in G1 cells can lead to the loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH), which is potentially carcinogenic. We conducted a gain-of-function screen to identify miRNAs that regulate HR-mediated DSB repair, and of these miRNAs, miR-1255b, miR-148b*, and miR-193b* specifically suppress the HR-pathway in the G1 phase. These miRNAs target the transcripts of HR factors, BRCA1, BRCA2, and RAD51, and inhibiting miR-1255b, miR-148b*, and miR-193b* increases expression of BRCA1/BRCA2/RAD51 specifically in the G1-phase leading to impaired DSB repair. Depletion of CtIP, a BRCA1-associated DNA end resection protein, rescues this phenotype. Furthermore, deletion of miR-1255b, miR-148b*, and miR-193b* in independent cohorts of ovarian tumors correlates with significant increase in LOH events/chromosomal aberrations and BRCA1 expression."

Completion of HR in G1 cells can lead to the loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH), which is potentially carcinogenic. We conducted a gain-of-function screen to identify miRNAs that regulate HR-mediated DSB repair, and of these miRNAs, miR-1255b, miR-148b*, and miR-193b* specifically suppress the HR-pathway in the G1 phase. These miRNAs target the transcripts of HR factors, BRCA1, BRCA2, and RAD51, and inhibiting miR-1255b, miR-148b*, and miR-193b* increases expression of BRCA1/BRCA2/RAD51 specifically in the G1-phase leading to impaired DSB repair. Depletion of CtIP, a BRCA1-associated DNA end resection protein, rescues this phenotype. Furthermore, deletion of miR-1255b, miR-148b*, and miR-193b* in independent cohorts of ovarian tumors correlates with significant increase in LOH events/chromosomal aberrations and BRCA1 expression."

Such a double-strand break can delete genes or even kill the cell. In fact, conventional cancer therapy kills cancer cells by causing irreparable double-strand breaks. Conversely, a normal cell that is constantly exposed to DNA damaging agents can become a tumor if double-strand breaks are incorrectly repaired. An efficient and accurate double-strand break repair system needs to be in place to prevent this transformation. Therefore, an in-depth understanding of double-strand break repair and the factors involved are important for both gaining insight into the cause of cancer and to improve cancer therapy."

Since it needs a readily available DNA template, this method only works in phases of the cell growth cycle where there are many copies of DNA\u2014that is, in the post-DNA replication phases. In particular, homologous recombination does not work during the pre-replication, G1 phase. If homologous recombination is attempted during G1, it will block the other methods employed by cells to repair broken strands of DNA."

Two major mechanistically distinct pathways, homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) have evolved to repair DSBs (<a href=\"#bib14\">Ciccia and Elledge, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Chapman et al., 2012b</a>). HR requires an undamaged homologous DNA template to replace an adjacent damaged one with high fidelity (<a href=\"#bib49\">San Filippo et al., 2008</a>). By contrast, the untemplated NHEJ pathway is more error-prone as it rapidly processes and joins broken DNA ends (<a href=\"#bib38\">Lieber, 2010</a>). There is tight regulation of the DSB repair pathways during the cell cycle as HR is restricted to the S/G2 phase and NHEJ is pre-dominant in G1 but has moderate activity throughout the cell cycle. The balance of HR and NHEJ proteins (such as BRCA1 and 53BP1) involved in early steps of the two repair pathways are critical for pathway choice and the cell-cycle phase specific regulation of each pathway (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bouwman et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bunting et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Chapman et al., 2012b</a>). Initiation of HR via resection of broken DNA ends blocks NHEJ and could lead to unrepaired DSBs in G1 cells (<a href=\"#bib28\">Helmink et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Escribano-Diaz et al., 2013</a>). The physiological consequence of HR-mediated repair of a DSB in the G1-phase is the loss of heterozygosity (LOH)."

Ectopic HR leading to LOH may play a critical role in carcinogenesis as recessive oncogenic mutations are revealed and/or tumor suppressor function is lost (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bishop and Schiestl, 2003</a>). The regulation of the HR pathway is also extremely relevant for cancer therapy. Chemical inhibitors of the DNA repair protein, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), exhibit synthetic lethality in BRCA-deficient tumors that have a defective HR pathway (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bryant et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Farmer et al., 2005</a>). Although the molecular mechanism underlying this phenotype remains unresolved, lack of PARP activity in an HR-deficient scenario leads to the accumulation of DSBs in proliferating cells and this triggers apoptosis (<a href=\"#bib27\">Helleday, 2011</a>). Epigenetic suppression of factors in the HR pathway occurs in sporadic breast and ovarian tumors, and collectively this phenotype has been described as \u2018BRCAness\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib52\">Turner et al., 2004</a>). Tumors with the \u2018BRCAness\u2019 phenotype are likely to respond to PARP inhibitors, and identifying factors (such as microRNAs) that induce the \u2018BRCAness\u2019 phenotype may enhance the clinical utility and scope of PARP inhibitors."

The regulation elicited by miRNAs is highly complex, given that a single miRNA can influence the expression of many mRNAs, and conversely a single mRNA is targeted by multiple miRNAs (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bartel, 2009</a>). Due to this complexity the role of miRNAs in DSB repair remains largely unknown (<a href=\"#bib13\">Chowdhury et al., 2013</a>). Using the experimental system of in vitro hematopoietic cell differentiation, we discovered that miR-182 targets BRCA1 (<a href=\"#bib41\">Moskwa et al., 2011</a>). Over-expression of miR-182 in triple negative breast tumor lines (in vitro and in vivo) suppresses HR via down-regulation of BRCA1 and sensitizes cells to PARP inhibitors.

Over-expression of seven miRNAs significantly reduced HR-mediated DSB repair. Based on their expression in a panel of breast and ovarian lines, we focused on characterizing the mechanism and physiological relevance of miR-1255b, miR-193b*, and miR-148b*. Despite lacking canonical binding sites, miR-1255b, miR-193b*, and miR-148b* associate with the BRCA1, BRCA2, and RAD51 transcripts and regulate their expression. Remarkably, the miRNA-mediated regulation of these genes is cell cycle dependent and inhibition of miR-1255b, miR-193b*, and miR-148b* leads to enhanced expression of BRCA1, BRCA2, and RAD51 specifically in the G1 phase. A functional consequence of inhibiting these miRNAs is a basal increase in DSBs in G1 cells. This phenotype can be reversed by silencing CtIP (the BRCA1-associated DNA end resection factor) which initiates HR-mediated DSB repair. Furthermore, deletion of these miRNAs in two independent cohorts of high-grade serous ovarian tumors correlates with increase in LOH."

The miRNA mimics from Qiagen and Applied Biosystems have proprietary chemical modifications that cause inactivation of the \u2018passenger\u2019 strand, allowing the \u2018active\u2019 strand to associate with target transcripts and regulate gene expression. The goal was to identify miRNA mimics that sensitize breast tumor cells, MDA-MB231 to the clinical PARP inhibitor, ABT888 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>). The miRNA mimics from Applied Biosystems impacted ABT888 sensitivity over a broad range, \u223c10- to 12-fold difference between the mimics with the highest impact on viability and the control mimics. Whereas the viability range with the mimics from Qiagen was limited to 3- to 4-fold. BRCA2 siRNA served as a positive control for each plate and the mimic for miR-182 served as an internal control. BRCA2 is an important gene for repair of replication-induced DNA damage and depletion of BRCA2 has an impact on viability even in the absence of PARP inhibitors (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). miRNA mimics that caused significant loss of viability in the absence of PARP inhibitors (equal or more than BRCA2 siRNA) were not considered (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The Applied Biosystems library yielded a rank ordered list of the top 13 miRNAs (including miR-182) based on viability percentage that sensitized cells to ABT888 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>) (<i>Z</i>-score thresholds [Z &lt; \u22122]). Prior to individual validation experiments, we utilized the results from the screen performed with the Qiagen library to confirm the impact of these miRNAs on ABT888 sensitivity. Our results show that 12 of the 13 miRNAs had at least a 25% impact on ABT888 sensitivity. Next, we confirmed the impact of these miRNAs on PARP inhibitor sensitivity using two clinical PARP inhibitors, ABT888 and olaparib (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>) in two breast cancer cell lines, MDA-MB231 and 21NT (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>).

To test whether expression of the 12 selected miRNAs impacts HR, we used a functional assay that assesses HR-mediated repair of an I-SceI-induced DSB (<a href=\"#bib42\">Nakanishi et al., 2005</a>). U2OS cells that have a single, stably integrated copy of the artificial recombination substrate DR-GFP were used for this assay. A chromosomal DSB was introduced in one of two tandem non-functional GFP genes by transient transfection of an I-SceI-encoding plasmid. A functional GFP gene can be reconstituted if the DSB is repaired by HR using the other partial GFP gene as a template. Using this assay, 11 of the 12 miRNAs significantly diminished HR-mediated DSB repair, which correlated with their impact on PARPi sensitivity. (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>). We prioritized the miRNAs according to their impact on HR and selected 7 miRNAs that reduced HR-efficiency by \u226530% (miR-1231, miR-1255b, miR-148b*, miR-876-3p, miR-221*, miR-193b*, and miR-185*).

We used a two-pronged approach to identify these genes. First, we used a collection of target prediction algorithms to identify genes targeted by these 3 miRNAs and compared it to the list of DDR proteins (see the \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). Second, we used a candidate-based approach using the prediction algorithm RNA22 to screen all the genes implicated in DDR for miRNA recognition element of miR-1255b, miR-148b*, and miR-193b*. This gave us a list of 18 proteins which have been previously implicated in HR-mediated repair of DSBs. We then assessed the impact of over-expressing miR-1255b, miR-148b*, and miR-193b* on the mRNA level of these 18 genes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). There was at least a 50% reduction in the transcripts of EXO1, MDC1, BRCA1, BRCA2, BRIP1, RAD51, and PALB2 in cells over-expressing either miR-1255b, miR-148b*, or miR-193b*. We next determined the impact of these miRNAs on the protein levels of the putative targets. Over-expressing miR-1255b reduces the cellular levels of BRCA1 and BRCA2, miR-148b* reduces RAD51 and miR-193b* reduces BRCA1, BRCA2, and RAD51 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>), and this impact is not related to an altered cell cycle (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Although over-expression of miR-1255b, miR-148b*, and miR-193b* correlates with significant increase in the transcripts of certain DNA repair genes (such as MRE11 and NBS1 for miR-1255b and miR-193b*; EXO1 for miR-193b*), there was no detectable increase in protein levels (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). It is possible that the increase in transcript levels of the DNA repair genes is due to miRNA-mediated down-regulation of transcriptional repressors or mRNA-destablizing proteins, such as AUF1."

To test for association of miR-1255b, miR-148b*, and miR-193b* with their respective target transcripts, we adopted a recently described method for capturing miRNA\u2013mRNA complexes using streptavidin-coated beads from cells transfected with biotinylated forms of the miRNA mimics (<a href=\"#bib46\">Orom and Lund, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Lal et al., 2011</a>). The amount of BRCA1, BRCA2, and RAD51 transcripts was measured in the pull-downs (GAPDH served as a control transcript) and the enrichment was assessed relative to pull-down with biotinylated control mimic (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E\u2013G</a>). Strikingly, consistent with our previous results, miR-1255b selectively pulled-down BRCA1 and BRCA2 transcripts but not the RAD51 transcript (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>). Conversely, miR-148b* pulled-down RAD51 transcript but not BRCA1 and BRCA2 transcripts, and miR-193b* pulled down all three transcripts. Furthermore, we used a combination of the biotinylated mimics to investigate overlapping targets, combining miR-1255b with miR-193b* and miR-148b*with miR-193b* (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>). Relative to the individual counterparts, the miR-1255b/miR-193b*combination immunoprecipitated increased the amount of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mRNAs and the miR-148b*/miR-193b* combination immunoprecipitated increased RAD51 mRNA (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>)."

Canonical MREs are predicted based on the seed rule, that is, the target site within 3\u2032 UTR forms Watson\u2013Crick pairs with bases at positions 2 through 7 or 8 of the 5\u2032 end of the miRNA (<a href=\"#bib37\">Lewis et al., 2005</a>). However, it is noteworthy that there is considerable evidence of \u2018seedless\u2019 or non-canonical association of miRNAs with target transcripts including sites in the coding sequence (CDS) (<a href=\"#bib15\">Didiano and Hobert, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Grimson et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Chi et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Lal et al., 2009a</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Hafner et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Shin et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Chi et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Loeb et al., 2012</a>).

We have previously used the PITA algorithm to expand the search criterion and identify non-canonical MREs for specific miRNA/mRNA combinations (<a href=\"#bib32\">Lal et al., 2009a</a>). The PITA algorithm identifies base pairing beyond the 5\u2032end of the miRNA, allows G:U wobbles or seed mismatches and predicts MREs across the entire target transcript, not just the 3\u2032UTR. Using this approach, we observed that consistent with our experimental data, there were putative non-canonical MREs for miR-193b*, miR-1255b, and miR-148b* in the transcripts of BRCA1, BRCA2, and RAD51 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>).

To confirm the interaction of endogenous miR-1255b, miR-193b*, and miR-148b* with specific MREs in the BRCA1, BRCA2, and RAD51 transcripts, we adopted a loss-of-function approach. We used miRNA inhibitors (also known as antagomirs, ANTs) that are single-stranded chemically enhanced oligonucleotides designed to irreversibly bind endogeneous miR-1255b, miR-193b* and miR-148b and suppress their activity. We estimated luciferase activity after inhibiting the miRNAs using antagomirs and, consistent with our previous results, found that inhibition of miR-1255b enhanced luciferase activity of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 reporter construct, inhibition of miR-148b* enhanced luciferase activity of the RAD51 reporter construct, and inhibition of miR-193b* enhanced luciferase activity of the BRCA1, BRCA2, and RAD51 reporter constructs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). The specificity of the MREs was further validated as the mutant versions of the luciferase reporters were immune to the antagomirs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>)."

To determine the functional significance of non-canonical MREs in the BRCA1, BRCA2, and RAD51 transcripts we generated expression constructs without the MREs by either deletion (MREs in 3\u2032UTR) or mutation (MREs in CDS) of them. Next, MDA-MB231 cells were co-transfected with (i) miR-1255b and BRCA1 or BRCA2 expression plasmid lacking miR-1255b binding sites; (ii) miR-193b* and BRCA1 or BRCA2 or RAD51 expression plasmid lacking miR-193b* binding sites; (iii) miR-148b* and a RAD51 expression plasmid lacking miR-148b* binding sites. First, the BRCA1, BRCA2, and RAD51 expression constructs lacking the specific MREs completely restored the expression of these genes in the presence of the corresponding miRNA mimic further validating the predicted MREs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, lower panel). Furthermore, in regard to ABT888 sensitivity, expression of BRCA1 or BRCA2 significantly \u2018rescued\u2019 the impact of miR-1255b, expression of BRCA1 or BRCA2 or RAD51 significantly \u2018rescued\u2019 the impact of miR-193b*, and expression of RAD51 significantly \u2018rescued\u2019 the impact of miR-148b* (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>, upper panel). Together, these results strongly suggest that miR-1255b, miR-193b*, and miR-148b* influence HR-mediated repair of DSBs and PARP inhibitor sensitivity by regulating expression of BRCA1, BRCA2, and RAD51."

However, the cellular function of endogenously expressed miR-1255b, miR-193b*, and miR-148b* remains unclear. To address this issue, we quantified their expression in cycling cells, specifically during the G1 to S transition. Consistent with previous reports (<a href=\"#bib25\">Gudas et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Vaughn et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Chen et al., 1997</a>), we observe that mRNA levels of BRCA1, BRCA2, and RAD51 are enhanced in the S-phase (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,C</a>). miR-1255b, miR-193b*, and miR-148b* inversely correlate with their target transcripts, and are significantly down-regulated as cells move into the S-phase. This was observed both in the breast tumor line, MDA-MB231 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>) and the non-tumorigenic breast epithelial line MCF10A (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Antagonizing these miRNAs induces a specific increase in target transcripts (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>) and proteins (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>) in the G1-phase, that is transfection of the miR-1255b ANT causes significant increase in BRCA1 and BRCA2 and not RAD51, miR-148b* ANT increases RAD51 and miR-193b* ANT increases BRCA1, BRCA2, and RAD51 in G1 cells (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D,E</a>, cell cycle profiles are shown in <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Combined inhibition of miRNAs with overlapping targets causes a synergistic increase in target transcripts in G1 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>). There is a significant increase in BRCA1 and BRCA2 transcripts in cells co-transfected with miR-1255b ANT and miR-193b*ANT, and a significant increase in RAD51 mRNA in cells co-transfected with miR-148b*ANT and miR-193b*ANT.

Therefore, it is feasible that up-regulation of HR factors due to the inhibition of miR-1255b, miR-193b*, and miR-148b* in G1 cells may also de-stabilize the balance of the HR and NHEJ pathways and thereby impede DSB repair. To test this hypothesis, asynchronous cells were transfected with antagomirs for miR-1255b, miR-193b* and miR-148b* and stained with Cyclin A to visualize S/G2 cells and distinguish them from G1 cells; \u03b3-H2AX was utilized as a marker for DSBs.

Mitotic recombination is a consequence of HR-mediated repair of DSBs in the G1 phase. Recent studies demonstrate that homologous chromosomes are in close proximity at DSB sites in the G1 phase (<a href=\"#bib22\">Gandhi et al., 2012</a>, <a href=\"#bib21\">2013</a>) further supporting the notion that HR-mediated DSB repair is feasible in G1 cells and this in turn could lead to LOH. Based on our experimental data, the prediction would be that loss of miR-1255b, miR-193b*, and miR-148b* would correlate with enhanced LOH events that are occurring due to mitotic recombination. To test this hypothesis, we utilized the data from the <a href=\"#bib7\">Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2011</a> (TCGA, [2011]), where the processed LOH data for high-grade serous ovarian tumors is readily available. The HR-pathway and expression of BRCA1 and BRCA2 is extremely relevant in ovarian tumors, and we observed that there is detectable expression of miR-1255b, miR-148b*, and miR-193b* in a panel of ovarian tumor lines (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>).

We observed that the number of LOH events is significantly higher in tumors with deletions of miR-148b* and miR-193b* relative to the tumors that are diploid copy neutral at these loci. The number of LOH events was also moderately higher (One tailed Mann Whitney's U test; p&lt;0.08) in tumors with deletion of miR-1225b compared to the copy neutral ones (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). It is noteworthy that mature miR-1255b is encoded from two distinct genomic loci (miR-1255b-1 on chr4: 36427988-36428050 and miR-1255b-2 on chr1: 167967898-167967964). In our deletion analysis, we correlated LOH events with deletion of either miR-1255b-1 or miR-1255b-2, therefore the moderate correlation of LOH with loss of miR-1255b may be due to the presence of the second copy. The limited sample size with deletions of both miR-1255b-1 and miR-1255b-2 precludes any statistical analysis. Reflecting overall genomic instability, there is a significant increase in somatic amplifications and deletions in tumors with deletions in miR-1255b, miR-148b*, and miR-193b* (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>)."

The statistical significance was limited due to small size of the data set, but the patterns were consistent even with alternative cutoffs. In our analysis, we compared the copy neutral LOH events to specifically focus on LOH events that are likely to occur due to recombination between homologous alleles.

In the few recent studies (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hu et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Yan et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Wang et al., 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib55\">2012a</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Dimitrov et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Huang et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Neijenhuis et al., 2013</a>), including ones from our group (<a href=\"#bib33\">Lal et al., 2009b</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Moskwa et al., 2011</a>), the focus has been the impact of a single miRNA on an individual DSB protein. A key conceptual limitation to this approach is that miRNAs typically target hundreds of transcripts and are more likely to have a profound impact on a pathway like the HR repair pathway by regulating several HR factors. Here, we systematically identified miRNAs influencing HR (miR-1231, miR-1255b, miR-148b*, miR-876-3p, miR-221*, miR-193b*, and miR-185*) and observed that three of these miRNAs (miR-1255b, miR-148b*, and miR-193b*) regulate expression of BRCA1, BRCA2, and RAD51. Intriguingly, they lack canonical binding sites in the 3\u2032UTR of BRCA1, BRCA2, and RAD51, but interact with these transcripts via non-canonical MREs. These results underline the importance of binding of miRNAs to their target transcripts that are not restricted to base pairing at \u2018seed regions\u2019, and highlight the shortcomings of current prediction algorithms in identifying functional targets of miRNAs."

Specifically 53BP1 and its associated factors (RIF1 and PTIP) promote NHEJ and counter BRCA1 thereby balancing the process of DSB repair between HR and NHEJ (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bouwman et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bunting et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Chapman et al., 2012a</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Callen et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Di Virgilio et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Escribano-Diaz et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Zimmermann et al., 2013</a>). Loss of the 53BP1-associated protein RIF1 or the protein H2AX allows the BRCA1/CtIP-mediated resection of DNA ends in G1 cells impeding NHEJ and leading to the persistence of DNA lesions (<a href=\"#bib28\">Helmink et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Escribano-Diaz et al., 2013</a>). Conversely, it is likely that the ectopic increase in expression of BRCA1 and other HR factors in the G1 phase will also disrupt the balance of DSB repair. Our results represent an intriguing example of an organized, miRNA-driven physiological system for controlling the level of endogenous HR factors in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Down-regulating the expression of HR factors, particularly, an HR-initiating factor like BRCA1 in the G1 cells is necessary for maintaining genomic stability. Inhibiting miR-1255b and miR-193b* allows increased BRCA1 expression in G1 cells leading to CtIP-mediated resection and a potential block in NHEJ. This will disrupt the balance of HR and NHEJ (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>) with significant increase in genomic instability. Furthermore, execution of HR-mediated repair in G1 cells would result in LOH which has the potential of revealing recessive oncogenic mutations. The loss of miR-1255b, miR-148b*, and miR-193b* largely correlates with increased genomic instability and a higher frequency of LOH, which is consistent with our experimental data. In some cases, the correlations are moderate and not statistically significant, and this may reflect the heterogeneity of primary tumors, limited sample size and the technical shortcomings of large sets of genomic data. These shortcomings notwithstanding, there is a clear pattern that emerges from our experimental data and clinical analysis that strongly suggests that miRNAs regulate the optimal expression of HR proteins in the course of the cell cycle and prevent ectopic activation of the HR pathway. A single copy loss of BRCA1 (<a href=\"#bib31\">Konishi et al., 2011</a>), BRCA2 (<a href=\"#bib47\">Popova et al., 2012</a>), or RAD51 (<a href=\"#bib51\">Smeenk et al., 2010</a>) impacts genomic stability giving credence to the idea that a miRNA-mediated alteration in the cellular levels of these proteins may significantly impact the DNA repair process. Furthermore, for miR-1255b and miR-193b*, there is a moderate reduction in multiple HR factors, which further compounds their impact on the HR repair pathway. The underlying mechanism of cell cycle-dependent expression of miRNAs regulating HR factors remains to be investigated in future studies."

NHEJ is the preferred pathway in the G1 phase with 53BP1 and the Ku complex binding the broken DNA end. miRNAs (such as miR-1255b and miR-193b*) suppress HR factors, particularly BRCA1, preventing end resection of the DNA lesions. However, when these miRNAs are inhibited or deleted it may disrupt the correct choice of DSB repair pathway. Ectopic over expression of BRCA1 will allow CtIP-mediated resection in G1 cells, preventing NHEJ. Furthermore, HR-mediated repair in G1 is detrimental to cell health as it would lead to LOH. In S-phase, DSBs are predominantly repaired by HR and down-regulation of miRNAs targeting BRCA1, BRCA2 and RAD51 may be important in ensuring efficient HR-mediated DSB repair. Over-expression of miRNAs (such as miR-1255b, miR-193b*, and miR-148b*) targeting BRCA1, BRCA2 and RAD51 in the S phase will impede various steps of HR, and the HR deficiency will sensitize these cells to PARP inhibitors."

Z-score was calculated by the following equation where x is luminescence value for each miRNA, \u03bc is negative control mean, and \u03c3 is negative control standard deviation: z = (x\u2212\u03bc)/\u03c3."

We marked those LOH events as heterozygous deletion mediated, which overlapped with deletion events (aCGH log2 signal intensity ratio &lt;\u22120.20) for at least 80% of its length. After excluding those LOH events, we focused on the copy neutral LOH events of size &gt;1 Mb. There were 26,176 LOH events in 418 samples. In each sample, at each of the three miRNA loci, we inferred its copy number status as follows: miRNA loci of log2 signal intensity &lt;\u22120.2 were flagged as deletions, and those regions with signal intensity \u2265\u22120.2 to \u22640.2 were flagged as copy neutral.

We focused only on the LOH events with size &gt;10 kb; we counted the number of marker SNPs in those LOH region (N), and the number of such SNPs with allelic copy number &lt;1.9 (n). If n/N was \u22650.8, we postulated that LOH to be deletion mediated; while the remaining ones (n/N &lt;0.8) as copy neutral LOH. There were 685 copy neutral LOH events in these samples. We repeated the analyses with a n/N cut-off of 0.75. In each sample, at each of the three miRNA loci, we inferred its copy number status based on the nearest marker SNP. If the copy number call was &lt;1.9, we marked that as a deletion, and if the copy number call was between 1.9 and 2.1, we flagged it as copy neutral, respectively."

First, the writing does not meet the standard of scientific English for publication. This is reflected by frequent grammatical errors and informal phrases throughout the text. Second, the writing does not flow smoothly, as many concepts or findings are not explained well. Some data, for instance, the rescue experiments in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, can only be judged after getting a better understanding of what the authors want to deliver. The weakness in the writing significantly compromised the quality of this work. We suggest rewriting this paper in a precise and concise way, and explain the rationale clearly before moving on to the experimental details. We further suggest that you consult a senior colleague to offer comments on your revised text."

We have completely re-written this section to clarify these issues. To systematically identify miRNAs that impact PARP inhibitor sensitivity we screened two commercially available miRNA mimic libraries (Qiagen and Applied Biosytems). MiRNA mimics are 20-22 nts, chemically modified double-stranded RNA molecules designed to mimic endogenous mature miRNAs. The miRNA mimics from Qiagen and Applied Biosystems have proprietary chemical modifications that cause inactivation of the \u2018passenger\u2019 strand, allowing the \u2018active\u2019 strand to associate with target transcripts and regulate gene expression. We used the Applied Biosytems library as our primary screen, and this yielded a rank ordered list of the top 13 miRNAs based on viability percentage that sensitized cells to PARP inhibitor. Prior to individual validation experiments we utilized the results from the screen performed with the Qiagen library to confirm the impact of these miRNAs on ABT888 sensitivity. Basically the screen with the Qiagen library was used to validate the \u2018hits\u2019 from the Applied Biosystems library, before we did any focused experiments."

Depletion of BRCA2 dramatically sensitizes cells to PARP inhibitors. However, BRCA2 is an important gene for repair of replication-induced DNA damage and depletion of BRCA2 has an impact on viability even in the absence of PARP inhibitors (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2013figure supplement 1</a>). Our goal was to identify miRNAs that cause loss of viability only when cells are treated with PARP inhibitors. Therefore, miRNA mimics that caused significant loss of viability in the absence of PARP inhibitors were not considered. We used BRCA2 depletion in untreated cells as a threshold to eliminate miRNAs that may cause loss of viability independent of PARP inhibitors."

To explore the physiological relevance of the seven miRNAs that significantly impacted HR-mediated DSB repair and PARP inhibitors sensitivity we needed to identify cells where these miRNAs are endogenously expressed. From the perspective of cancer biology, the HR pathway is extremely relevant for breast tumors, specifically triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and clinical trials with PARP inhibitors are underway in TNBC. Therefore in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a> we initially assessed the endogenous expression of seven selected miRNAs (miR-1231, miR-1255b, miR-148b*, miR-876-3p, miR-221*, miR-193b*, and miR-185*) in a panel of TNBC lines. Of the seven miRNAs, only miR-1255b, miR-148b*, and miR-193b* had detectable and aberrant over expression in TNBC lines (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Therefore we focused on an in-depth analysis of miR-1255b, miR-148b*, and miR-193b*. Again this section has been re-written and the point clarified."

The expression level of a large majority of these miRNAs is not known in TNBC lines. I\u2019m not sure what criterion we would utilize to select the \u2018negative\u2019 miRNAs and look at their expression in TNBC lines, and more importantly how that would add to our story. However, we did take the reviewers\u2019 comment in mind to further substantiate this figure. Of the seven miRNAs we initially selected based on impact on HR-mediated DSB repair, miR-1231, miR-876-3p, miR-221*, and miR-185* were not expressed in the TNBC lines. However, it is important to show that our detection method is valid for these miRNAs, and their lack of expression in TNBC lines is not an artifact. Therefore we have included data showing that these miRNAs are expressed in other cell lines."
