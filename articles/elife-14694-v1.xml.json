                    "text": "The mechanisms regulating synapse numbers during development and ageing are essential for normal brain function and closely linked to brain disorders including dementias. Using <i>Drosophila</i>, we demonstrate roles of the microtubule-associated protein Tau in regulating synapse numbers, thus unravelling an important cellular requirement of normal Tau. In this context, we find that Tau displays a strong functional overlap with microtubule-binding spectraplakins, establishing new links between two different neurodegenerative factors. Tau and the spectraplakin Short Stop act upstream of a three-step regulatory cascade ensuring adequate delivery of synaptic proteins. This cascade involves microtubule stability as the initial trigger, JNK signalling as the central mediator, and kinesin-3 mediated axonal transport as the key effector. This cascade acts during development (synapse formation) and ageing (synapse maintenance) alike. Therefore, our findings suggest novel explanations for intellectual disability in Tau deficient individuals, as well as early synapse loss in dementias including Alzheimer\u2019s disease."

Using <i>Drosophila</i>, we demonstrate roles of the microtubule-associated protein Tau in regulating synapse numbers, thus unravelling an important cellular requirement of normal Tau. In this context, we find that Tau displays a strong functional overlap with microtubule-binding spectraplakins, establishing new links between two different neurodegenerative factors. Tau and the spectraplakin Short Stop act upstream of a three-step regulatory cascade ensuring adequate delivery of synaptic proteins. This cascade involves microtubule stability as the initial trigger, JNK signalling as the central mediator, and kinesin-3 mediated axonal transport as the key effector. This cascade acts during development (synapse formation) and ageing (synapse maintenance) alike. Therefore, our findings suggest novel explanations for intellectual disability in Tau deficient individuals, as well as early synapse loss in dementias including Alzheimer\u2019s disease."

The loss of Tau or spectraplakins causes the microtubules to fall apart and triggers an internal stress signalling pathway known as the JNK pathway. Activating JNK signalling blocks the transport of synaptic materials along axons, which prevents the formation of new synapses and starves existing synapses leading to their decay."

We found a significant rescue of Syt levels at motoraxonal endings, which was not observed in vehicle-treated controls (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D\u2013E</a>). Therefore, a decrease in microtubule stability is a likely cause for defective transport of synaptic proteins in <i>shot-tau</i> mutant neurons. It could be argued that Shot-Tau dependent microtubule stabilisation directly regulates processive advance of kinesins in axons (see Discussion), yet the rather normal transport dynamics we observed upon live imaging in <i>shot-tau</i> mutant neurons clearly excluded this possibility (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>)."

As a potential mediator, we suspected the JNK signalling pathway which is known to respond to a number of cellular stresses (see Discussion). To test our hypothesis, we investigated the pattern of JNK activity, using an antibody against phosphorylated JNK (JNK-P) (<a href=\"#bib32\">Langen et al., 2013</a>). In wild type embryos at stage 16, we found high accumulations of JNK-P at motoraxon tips and low levels in the somata of CNS and sensory neurons (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figures 6F</a> and <a href=\"#fig7\">7A</a>), i.e. a localisation pattern similar to that of synaptic proteins and Unc-104 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C\u2013E</a>). This distribution was altered in single <i>tau<sup>MR22</sup> </i>or <i>shot<sup>3</sup></i> mutant embryos, showing higher levels of JNK-P in neuronal somata and lower levels at the tips of motoraxons (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). This altered pattern was intensified in <i>shot-tau</i> double mutant neurons (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>) and clearly reminiscent of the redistribution patterns observed with synaptic proteins and Unc-104 in these neurons (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4E</a> and <a href=\"#fig5\">5E</a>). Notably, these changes in the pattern of JNK activation were reproduced when inducing microtubule stress by applying nocodazole to early stage 16 wildtype embryos (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>). Complementary to this finding, treatment of <i>shot-tau</i> mutant neurons with the microtubule stabilising drug epothilone B, increased the localisation of JNK-P at axonal tips and reduced the aberrant localisation in somata (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>)."

This effort was essentially aided by our finding that Tau and Shot are functionally redundant, and the subsequent incorporation of Shot into our studies. The robust phenotypes of <i>shot-tau</i> double-mutant neurons enabled us to demonstrate roles of Shot-Tau during the formation and maintenance of pre-synaptic sites in axons, and unravel the underlying mechanistic cascade which involves three major steps. Firstly, the absence of Shot-Tau causes microtubule destabilisation. Secondly, this cytoskeletal stress causes aberrant JNK activity patterns with upregulation in somata and downregulation at axon tips. Thirdly, aberrant JNK activation leads to a somatic roadblock for kinesin-3 mediated transport, thus inhibiting the delivery of synaptic proteins and eventually causing synapse loss. Depending on whether the functions of Tau and/or Shot are removed during development or ageing, either the formation or the maintenance of synapses are affected, respectively\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>)."

However, experiments with double knock-down in culture and in the adult brain clearly showed strong synapse reduction whilst maintaining normal branch patterns, and Unc-104 rescued synapse reduction in <i>shot-tau</i> mutant neurons without major increases of the branch pattern in these neurons.

                                "text": "Our findings provide potential new mechanistic explanations for various tau related brain disorders. For example, microdeletions in the region of MAPT (the human tau gene) cause intellectual disability (<a href=\"#bib50\">Sapir et al., 2012</a>), and Tau's synapse-promoting roles m\ufeffay well contribute to this pathology. Furthermore, various tauopathies are characterised by precocious pathological loss of synapses. Our data suggest that loss of tau could lead to defective synapse maintenance and eventually synapse loss. For example, a prominent group of dementias which lacks distinctive histopathology (DLDH) are characterised by the loss of Tau (<a href=\"#bib67\">Zhukareva et al., 2001</a>). Further tauopathies including Alzheimer disease, typically involve hyper-phosphorylation and aggregate formation of Tau (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hern\u00e1ndez and Avila, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Williams, 2006</a>). In this scenario, there are two parallel, non-exclusive modalities through which Tau can cause pathology. Firstly, detached hyper-phosphorylated tau attains gain-of-function roles in the cytoplasm damaging neurons through a number of mechanisms (<a href=\"#bib39\">Morris et al., 2013</a>). Secondly, hyper-phosphorylation of tau causes a loss-of-function condition by depleting Tau from microtubules. However, since Tau knock-out mouse models mostly failed to show significant phenotypes and the neuronal functions of endogenous tau remain little understood, the pathological importance of Tau loss from microtubules has been marginalised (<a href=\"#bib39\">Morris et al., 2013</a>). Our results now re-emphasise the notion that loss of Tau from microtubules could contribute to neurodegenerative pathology and deliver mechanistic explanations."

However, we found similar, yet milder phenotypes if only Tau was depleted, suggesting that the mechanisms described here could well contribute to slow disease progression in tauopathies. Our discovery that spectraplakins are MAPs which functionally overlap with Tau, opens up new experimental avenues for Tau studies. So far, spectraplakins have been linked to the degeneration of sensory and autonomous neurons (<a href=\"#bib13\">Edvardson et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Ferrier et al., 2013</a>), and it remains to be elucidated whether they may have similar roles also in the brain.

To quantify synaptic proteins at the tip of embryonic motorneurons in vivo. we manually selected the area occupied by the growth cones using the FasII staining and measured the signal intensity derived from the Syt channel; the background intensity was subtracted. Images used for these measurements did not contain saturated levels. Also, to measure the number of synaptic densities in DC neurons in the medulla of the adult brain, we used thresholding to select synaptic densities followed by particle analysis. The number of branches in the medulla per DC neuron was quantified manually. To quantify MT stability upon nocodazole\u00a0treatment, we counted the number of breaks in the microtubule bundle per axon."

Sometimes read-outs focus on syt punctae, sometimes brp, n-syb and different ages in culture or in vivo. Different read-outs in different experiments make comparisons more difficult. A principal concern arising from the presentation of selective read-outs is the specificity of the phenotypes. Defective syt puncta (the most commonly used read-out in the paper) can arise directly and indirectly from numerous causes. Just because they become more when there is more kinesin does not mean that the function of tau and shot is truly rescued. I am wondering what these neurons look like, what other markers look like and what aspects of neuronal function and maintenance are truly 'rescued' with unc104 overexpression compared to the microtubule-stabilizing drug compared to JNK signaling attenuation. Finally, a key issue is the lack of simple genetic rescue experiments. The authors only provide one tau rescue experiments at the beginning of the paper. The shot mutant is never rescued by a shot transgene."

Next the authors produce microtubule stress with nocodazole and report active JNK redistribution similar to the tau, shot double mutant and conclude that microtubule stress is the underlying cause. The key test of this idea would be epothilone B treatment to reduce microtubule stress and show that JNK-P is normalized, but unfortunately this experiment is missing."

For the rest of the paper we mostly focused on Syt which has been used previously to quantify presynaptic sites (see as an example Wan et al., Neuron, 2000; Liu et al., The Journal of Neuroscience 2010; Franciscovich et al., Genetics 2008 and Rieckhof et al., Journal of Biological Chemistry, 2003).
