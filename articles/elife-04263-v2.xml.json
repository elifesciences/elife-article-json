                    "text": "miR-128, a brain-enriched microRNA, has been implicated in the control of neurogenesis and synaptogenesis but its potential roles in intervening processes have not been addressed. We show that post-transcriptional mechanisms restrict miR-128 accumulation to post-mitotic neurons during mouse corticogenesis and in adult stem cell niches. Whereas premature miR-128 expression in progenitors for upper layer neurons leads to impaired neuronal migration and inappropriate branching, sponge-mediated inhibition results in overmigration. Within the upper layers, premature miR-128 expression reduces the complexity of dendritic arborization, associated with altered electrophysiological properties. We show that <i>Phf6</i>, a gene mutated in the cognitive disorder B\u00f6rjeson-Forssman-Lehmann syndrome, is an important regulatory target for miR-128. Restoring PHF6 expression counteracts the deleterious effect of miR-128 on neuronal migration, outgrowth and intrinsic physiological properties. Our results place miR-128 upstream of PHF6 in a pathway vital for cortical lamination as well as for the development of neuronal morphology and intrinsic excitability."

We show that post-transcriptional mechanisms restrict miR-128 accumulation to post-mitotic neurons during mouse corticogenesis and in adult stem cell niches. Whereas premature miR-128 expression in progenitors for upper layer neurons leads to impaired neuronal migration and inappropriate branching, sponge-mediated inhibition results in overmigration. Within the upper layers, premature miR-128 expression reduces the complexity of dendritic arborization, associated with altered electrophysiological properties. We show that <i>Phf6</i>, a gene mutated in the cognitive disorder B\u00f6rjeson-Forssman-Lehmann syndrome, is an important regulatory target for miR-128. Restoring PHF6 expression counteracts the deleterious effect of miR-128 on neuronal migration, outgrowth and intrinsic physiological properties. Our results place miR-128 upstream of PHF6 in a pathway vital for cortical lamination as well as for the development of neuronal morphology and intrinsic excitability."

The generation of the active form of miRNAs from their initial nuclear transcripts occurs for the majority of miRNAs via two RNase-mediated processing events (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib20\">Krol et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Siomi and Siomi, 2010</a>). While still in the nucleus, the primary miRNA transcript (pri-miRNA) is cleaved by the concerted action of the DROSHA ribonuclease and the RNA binding protein DGCR8. DROSHA cleavage releases precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs) with a size range between approximately 60 and 80 nucleotides that are characterized by a stem-loop secondary structure. After nuclear export, the pre-miRNA is cleaved again to generate the active, \u223c22 nucleotide mature miRNA by a second protein complex containing the DICER ribonuclease. Developmental regulation of miRNA expression is known to occur at each step in this biogenesis pathway (<a href=\"#bib20\">Krol et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Siomi and Siomi, 2010</a>)."

By inhibiting the expression of two proteins active in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), miR-128 was shown to promote neurogenesis in a cell culture model (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bruno et al., 2011</a>). Additional functions for miR-128 were then reported in behavior and memory. In a study on the acquisition and suppression of fear-evoked memory, increased expression of miR-128 correlated with, and was required for, the extinction of a learned fear response (<a href=\"#bib22\">Lin et al., 2011</a>).

The sequence and secondary structures of the precursor miRNAs produced from the two copies of miR-128 differ, but they produce identical \u223c21 nt miRNAs after Dicer processing. This arrangement is evolutionarily conserved among vertebrates. Recently, the phenotypes of deletion mutants for the mouse miR-128 genes were reported (<a href=\"#bib45\">Tan et al., 2013</a>). The two gene copies were shown to be unequal, with miR-128-2 responsible for approximately 80% of the miR-128 level in the adult forebrain. Deletion of miR-128-2 resulted in hyperactive motor behavior and severe epileptic seizures. Selective ablation of miR-128-2 in post-mitotic neurons in the forebrain was sufficient to cause hyperactivity and seizures that could be rescued by ectopic expression of miR-128 (<a href=\"#bib45\">Tan et al., 2013</a>).

We present evidence that post-transcriptional regulation restricts the accumulation of miR-128 to post-migratory neurons in the embryonic cortical plate and adult stem cell zones. Premature expression of miR-128 led to deficits in the radial migration and dendritic outgrowth of upper layer cortical neurons that were associated with an increase in intrinsic excitability. In contrast, inhibition of miR-128 during migration led to a shift in final neuronal positioning toward the upper boundary of the cortical plate. We identify the X-linked syndromic intellectual disability gene <i>Phf6</i> as a significant regulatory target for miR-128. Co-expression of PHF6 suppressed both the morphological and the physiological aspects of the miR-128 gain-of-function phenotype."

In agreement with our previous work (<a href=\"#bib42\">Smirnova et al., 2005</a>), Northern blots of RNA taken from the mouse cortex at several developmental stages show that the mature, 21 nt miR-128 RNA is upregulated between embryonic day 12.5 (E12.5) and E18.5 and remains high postnatally and in adulthood (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). In this experiment, we used a high-sensitivity LNA probe complementary to the mature miRNA that should also allow detection of both miR-128 precursor RNAs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). We detected a single precursor signal present at a low level that, in contrast to the mature form, remained constant at all time points tested (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). We next employed precursor-specific probes directed against the divergent sequences of their respective loops (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). The specificity and efficacy of the two probes was confirmed using RNA from cells transfected with expression constructs for the two isoforms (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Using the pre-miR-128-2 specific probe (see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>), we detected a strong band of the expected size that was present at nearly constant levels throughout embryonic and postnatal development (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Expression of the miR-128-1 precursor was below the limit of detection (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>), indicating that miR-128-2 is more highly expressed than miR-128-1 in the embryonic cortex, consistent with a recent report (<a href=\"#bib45\">Tan et al., 2013</a>). Taken together, these results suggest that the dynamic expression of miR-128 in cortical development is achieved at least in part by post-transcriptional regulation of pre-miR-128-2 processing."

Comparing the regulation of pre-miR-128-2 and miR-128 in embryonic corticogenesis suggests that accumulation of miR-128 occurs after the completion of neurogenesis and at the end of radial migration as cortical neurons reach their final position in the cortex and begin their functional and morphological maturation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A\u2013C</a>).

This allowed us to introduce miR-128 into proliferating and migrating cells that normally do not express the mature miRNA. We used the plasmid vector Intron-RED, which allows precursor miRNA sequences to be expressed from a synthetic intron engineered in dsRed, generating the expression constructs pre-miR-128-1-RED and pre-miR-128-2-RED for the two miR-128 precursors (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 for details). Comparing the activity of the two constructs in Northern blot and sensor assays revealed that the pre-miR-128-1-RED construct displayed reduced activity compared to pre-miR-128-2-RED (refer to <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B,C</a>). The defect in pre-miR-128-1 processing therefore appears to be intrinsic to the precursor and/or flanking sequences and allows the use of the pre-miR-128-1-RED construct as a negative control. To verify that forced miR-128 expression from pre-miR-128-2-RED can overcome the inhibitory mechanism that acts on endogenous pre-miR-128-2, we stained for mature miR-128 in electroporated brains at E18.5. We could confirm that cells expressing dsRed from the pre-miR-128-2-RED expression vector, but not the control Intron-RED vector, were the sole miR-128<sup>+</sup> cells in the IZ (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

In comparison, the majority of pre-miR-128-2 expressing neurons migrated successfully into the cortical plate but their final position was shifted toward the deep layers (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Quantification of the effect on migration confirmed the shift in neuronal position to deeper layers in response to premature expression of miR-128-2 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>).

The layer II-III neurons targeted by electroporation at E15.5 characteristically express the transcription factors Cux1 and Cux2, while earlier born layer V neurons express Ctip2 (<a href=\"#bib28\">Nieto et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Arlotta et al., 2005</a>). Co-staining of electroporated brains at P0 with these layer-specific markers revealed that the majority of Cux1<sup>+</sup> cells had reached their destination in the upper layers, but some Cux1<sup>+</sup> cells were still present in the deep layers and in the white matter. Regardless of their position in the cortical plate, cells electroporated with pre-miR-128-2-RED co-stained for Cux1 at approximately the same frequency as control cells (&gt;80%, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,D,E</a>). Furthermore, dsRed<sup>+</sup> cells expressing pre-miR-128-2 in layer V did not express Ctip2 at higher levels than control cells (&lt;2%, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,D\u2032,E\u2032</a>) suggesting that their improper localization was not an indirect consequence of temporal misspecification. Together, these results indicate that the fate of the cells electroporated with premiR-128-2 was not affected despite the defect in neuronal migration."

Our sponge inhibitor expresses an eGFP cassette containing an array of 16 high-affinity synthetic miR-128 binding sites within the 3\u2032 UTR under the control of the CAGGS promoter. Upon electroporation of the anti-miR-128 sponge construct at E15.5 and analysis at P7, we observed a significant shift in neuronal position toward the top of the cortical plate in sponge compared to control neurons (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F,G</a>). The inverse migration phenotypes observed in upper layer neurons upon either increasing (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>) or decreasing miR-128 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F,G</a>) activity suggests that a pathway critical for correct cortical lamination is highly sensitive to the level of miR-128."

Careful examination of the electroporated regions, however, revealed differences in the proper bipolar morphology of pre-miR-128-2<sup>+</sup> neurons as they migrated radially through the cortical plate (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>). Because migrating neurons change morphology quickly, we analyzed control and pre-miR-128-2 electroporations performed in the same litter to avoid differences due to small variations in mating, electroporation, or sacrifice time. In controls, the majority of the electroporated neurons were already at their correct position in layer II/III, and those still migrating presented long, radially oriented leading processes (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Neurons expressing pre-miR-128-2 were more scattered throughout the cortical plate (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), with the leading processes of actively migrating cells frequently branched. To quantify this result, we reconstructed randomly selected neurons located in the deep layers and therefore still in the process of active migration. Control neurons generally had a single, unbranched leading process with occasional short filopodia (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, upper row). Neurons expressing pre-miR-128-2, on the other hand, were consistently more branched and also had more filopodia (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, lower row). The morphology of the neurons was quantified using the number of branches and the number of filopodia per neuron as criteria (see Materials and methods for details). Consistent with their overall morphology, ectopic expression of miR-128 in migrating neurons led to an approximately 2.5-fold increase in the number of filopodia and a commensurate increase in branch number (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). This suggests that the effects of miR-128 on migration are related to a failure in the regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics believed to be responsible for radial movement (<a href=\"#bib17\">Heng et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Cooper, 2013</a>). Staining of the electroporated area with the radial glia marker Nestin did not revel any obvious changes in the glial scaffold directing migration of these neurons, consistent with a cell autonomous effect (data not shown)."

The sensitivity of the mouse 3\u2032UTR to miR-128 was confirmed in a reporter assay upon co-expression of miR-128, with the response to pre-miR-128-2-RED greater than pre-miR-128-1-RED, as expected (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). To determine if miR-128 can regulate endogenous <i>Phf6</i>, we used two cell lines, HeLa and HEK-293, that express <i>Phf6</i> but not miR-128. In HeLa cells transfection with synthetic miR-128 led to a strong reduction in endogenous PHF6 protein. Transfection of two non-targeting miRNAs, let-7b or miR-125, had no effect (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>). Similar results were obtained in HEK-293 cells. As controls, we transfected with synthetic miRNAs for either let-7b, a non-targeting miRNA, or miR-124, a microRNA with one conserved binding site in the PHF6 3\u2032UTR. Whereas let-7b had no effect, transfection with synthetic miR-128 consistently reduced PHF6 protein levels by an average of approximately 50% (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>, quantified in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5H</a>). Unlike miR-128, the reduction in PHF6 in response to miR-124 was not statistically significant, suggesting that the three predicted binding sites for PHF6 act cooperatively to mediate stronger repression than the single site present for miR-124."

To test if miR-128 might be acting via suppression of <i>Phf6</i>, we generated an expression plasmid containing the open reading frame of <i>Phf6</i> linked to eGFP via an IRES sequence. As a negative control, we tested a similar construct containing the ORF of <i>Nrp2</i>, a known regulator of migration but weak miR-128 target (see <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Co-expression of NRP2 and pre-miR-128-2 after electroporation at E15.5 had no effect on the migration of cortical neurons assayed at P7 compared to expression of pre-miR-128-2 alone (data not shown). In contrast, co-expression of PHF6 and pre-miR-128-2 significantly reduced the number of ectopic neurons in the lower layers and promoted their migration into the upper layers (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A\u2013C</a>). Quantification of neuronal position at P7 confirmed that significantly more PHF6/miR-128 double-positive neurons reached the upper layers than those expressing miR-128 alone (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). These results suggest that precise timing of miR-128 expression is required to fine-tune the pro-migratory function of PHF6."

Furthermore, neurons prematurely expressing miR-128 showed a steeper current\u2013voltage relationship across a range of hyper- and depolarizing current pulses compared to control cells, an effect that can be primarily accounted for by their higher input resistance (203 \u00b1 18 M\u03a9 for pre-miR-128-2-RED vs 161 \u00b1 18 M\u03a9 for Intron-RED, 26% change, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D,E</a>). Because we found no difference in the membrane time constant between pre-miR-128-2 expressing cells and control cells (data not shown), the increased input resistance is most likely a consequence of the observed reduction in dendritic complexity (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). However, in combination with the depolarized membrane potential it may also indicate a reduction in basal membrane conductance mediated by potassium leak channels. In either case, in their sum, these changes should lead to an increase in excitability. Indeed, we observed a reduction in the current required to trigger action potential discharge (rheobase) in pre-miR-128-2 expressing cells compared to control cells (79.3 \u00b1 1.0 pA vs 124.5 \u00b1 12.8 pA, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>). Furthermore, pre-miR-128-2 expressing cells fired trains of action potentials (APs) at substantially higher frequencies (42 \u00b1 4 Hz) in response to large depolarizing current pulses (250 pA, 500 ms), a 63% increase compared to control cells (26 \u00b1 1 Hz, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7G</a>). Interestingly, in response to large hyperpolarizing pulses the miR-128 gain-of-function neurons responded with an approximately twofold larger voltage sag than control neurons (5.6 \u00b1 0.5 mV vs 2.6 \u00b1 0.2 mV, measured for \u2212250 pA current pulses, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7H</a>).

Based on the disparate temporal control of pre-miR-128-2 and miR-128, post-transcriptional mechanisms appear to contribute to the timing of miR-128 activity. Post-transcriptional regulation of miRNA biogenesis is believed to facilitate dynamic control over miRNA activity that may be required for cells to rapidly change their gene expression in response to developmental or environmental signals (<a href=\"#bib20\">Krol et al., 2010</a>). Another possible advantage of post-transcriptional control is that it would allow the timing of miR-128 expression to be partly uncoupled from the regulation of <i>Arpp21</i> transcription, the host mRNA for miR-128-2. One example of this in the nervous system is the ability of miR-26 to suppress its host gene <i>Ctdsp2</i> and allow differentiation of neural stem cells (<a href=\"#bib11\">Dill et al., 2012</a>). There is evidence for a similar feedback relationship between miR-128 and <i>Arpp21</i> in the adult brain during the suppression of fear-evoked memories (<a href=\"#bib22\">Lin et al., 2011</a>). However, mice deficient in <i>Arpp21</i> are viable and without a known defect in cortical development (<a href=\"#bib30\">Rakhilin et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Davis et al., 2012</a>)."

The mechanism or mechanisms responsible for post-transcriptional control of miR-128 remain to be determined, however, it appears to help restrict miR-128 accumulation to the cortical plate after neurogenesis and radial migration have occurred.

Previously, three brain-enriched miRNAs (miR-9, miR-132, and miR-137) have been implicated in the regulation of neuronal migration (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib13\">Evsyukova et al. 2013</a>). miR-9 and miR-132 cooperate as positive regulators of migration by preventing the expression of the transcription factor FOXP2 (<a href=\"#bib6\">Clovis et al., 2012</a>). Similarly, in utero electroporation of miR-137 leads to increased migration of progenitors into the cortical plate due to the ability of miR-137 to stimulate neuronal differentiation (<a href=\"#bib44\">Sun et al., 2011</a>). By contrast, we show that miR-128 is a negative regulator of migration and that the onset of miR-128 activity coincides with the termination of upper neuron migration. Manipulating the timing of miR-128 expression interferes with migration and cortical lamination, at least in part through regulation of the transcriptional repressor PHF6."

Within the nervous system, mutations in PHF6 have been detected in the developmental disorders B\u00f6rjeson-Forssmann-Lehmann (BFLS; <a href=\"http://www.omim.org/entry/301900\">OMIM 301900</a>) and Coffin\u2013Siris (CSS; <a href=\"http://omim.org/entry/135900\">OMIM 135900</a>) syndromes (<a href=\"#bib23\">Lower et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Tsurusaki et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Wieczorek et al., 2013</a>). BFLS is an X-linked recessive intellectual disability disorder associated with epilepsy and other developmental abnormalities. The phenotypic spectrum of CSS phenotypes overlaps BFLS and includes variable intellectual disability and developmental delay. CSS was recently shown to be associated with mutations in several components of SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes in addition to PHF6, strongly suggesting a role for PHF6 in epigenetic regulation (<a href=\"#bib37\">Santen et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Tsurusaki et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Wieczorek et al., 2013</a>). Furthermore, biochemical evidence has linked PHF6 to several chromatin modifying complexes, including the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylation complex (NuRD) (<a href=\"#bib46\">Todd and Picketts, 2012</a>) and the Polymerase associated factor 1 complex (Paf1C) (<a href=\"#bib52\">Zhang et al., 2013</a>).

Knockdown of PHF6 during embryonic corticogenesis resulted in impaired upper layer neuron migration characterized by excessive branching of the leading process. Knockdown of PAF1 led to quantitatively similar effects on migration, suggesting that PHF6 acts in the context of Paf1C to facilitate migration (<a href=\"#bib52\">Zhang et al., 2013</a>). The reciprocal expression patterns we observe comparing miR-128 and PHF6 during cortical development and neuronal growth in vitro suggest that miR-128 is a significant regulator of PHF6. We also show that the effect of miR-128 on the morphology and final distribution of migrating upper layer progenitors is similar to that reported after PHF6 knockdown (<a href=\"#bib52\">Zhang et al., 2013</a>). Moreover, co-expression of PHF6 and miR-128 alleviated this phenotype, indicating that miR-128 is a physiological regulator of PHF6 during corticogenesis. The regulation of SWI/SNF-complex subunit composition by miR-124 provides a precedent for temporal control of epigenetic modifiers by miRNAs during neurogenesis (<a href=\"#bib32\">Ronan, et al., 2013</a>). By regulating PHF6, miR-128 may play a similar role for Paf1C or the NuRD complex later in neuronal differentiation. Because premature miR-128 expression inhibited and miR-128 inhibition exaggerated radial migration, the miR-128/PHF6 circuit may play a role in how migrating neurons interpret their position, whether in response to an internal clock, external cues, or cell\u2013cell interactions."

We show for the first time that miR-128 and PHF6 cooperate in the regulation of dendritic arborization of upper layer neurons. Electrophysiological recordings also show that the balance between miR-128 and PHF6 influences cell autonomous excitability. PHF6 knockdown has previously been shown to increase the excitability of heterotopic neurons that were retained in the white matter due to impaired migration (<a href=\"#bib52\">Zhang et al., 2013</a>). Although this finding offers a potential explanation for the cognitive deficits and seizure activity observed in BFLS and CSS, the underlying mechanisms are not yet understood. Comparing the intrinsic properties of neurons expressing either ectopic miR-128 alone or miR-128 together with PHF6, we found that much, but not all, of the difference in intrinsic electrophysiological properties may be directly related to the effects on structural complexity. Layer II/III neurons expressing miR-128 prematurely had reduced complexity of their dendritic arbor, with the most apparent differences observed in their proximal dendrites. This reduction in dendritic complexity was rectified by co-expression of PHF6 and miR-128. Electrophysiological recordings further showed that the input resistance of recorded neurons was increased following miR-128 expression, as would be expected from a reduction in dendritic complexity. Interestingly, premature miR-128 expression also led to a more depolarized resting membrane potential than control cells. This is unlikely to be a direct effect of the morphological changes, and may reflect a reduction in hyperpolarizing leak currents. The net effect of the physiological changes induced by miR-128 was an increase in excitability, reflected by a reduced rheobase and increased firing frequency in response to depolarizing currents. In addition, exogenous PHF6 dampened the effects of miR-128 for all parameters tested. Thus, neuronal excitability is highly sensitive to the precise timing of miR-128 expression and subsequent repression of PHF6 during network formation in vivo. The lack of complete rescue of some parameters by PHF6, however, indicates that additional regulatory targets of miR-128 may contribute to some of the physiological effects we see in post-migratory neurons."

Loss of miR-128 resulted in heightened excitability that was attributed to the upregulation of ion channels and signal transduction pathways that occurred in the absence of miR-128. In contrast to D1 neurons, there were no significant differences in either the amplitude or the frequency of postsynaptic IPSCs or EPSCs in the cortical neurons we analyzed.

Membrane potential (VM) was calculated as the 50 ms baseline prior to the small hyperpolarizing step."

Images were taken using a Leica SL confocal microscope, for reconstruction a 40\u00d7 objective and Z-stack step of 1 \u00b5m was used. Nuclear staining was used to identify the deep layers of the cortical plate, individual neurons were reconstructed with the Fiji plugin Simple Neurite tracer. Quantification was essentially as described in <a href=\"#bib15\">Guerrier et al. (2009)</a>. For analysis at P21 electroporated animals were sacrificed, perfused, and 100-\u00b5m slices were prepared. Electroporated neurons were visualized by staining with dsRed antibody. Z-stack images were taken with an inverted epifluorescence microscope (Olympus IX81) with a 1 \u00b5m stack and reconstructed as above. For P15 neurons, after recording outside-out patches were formed and cells were filled with biocytin for 15 min.

The step between stacks was 1 \u00b5m at a resolution of 1024 \u00d7 1024. Neurons were reconstructed using the Simple Neurite Tracer plugin. Sholl analysis was performed on 3-D reconstructions using the Sholl analysis plugin for Fiji. The radius of the first concentric sphere was set at 7.5 \u00b5m and the increase between radii was 5 \u00b5m.

The authors need to provide loss-of-function evidence downregulating mir-128 to demonstrate that it is required for the migration and dendritic branching phenotypes described. The phenotypes resulting from electroporation of miR-128 are analysed at two stages: i) in cortical plate neurons where mature miR-128 is normally expressed, and where exogenous miR-128 is therefore overexpressed; ii) in migrating IZ neurons where mature miR-128 is normally not expressed and where exogenous miR-128 is therefore expressed ectopically. This is assuming that electroporation of pre-miR-128-2 results in production of mature miR128, which seems logical since it has a biological effect, although this is not shown. There is also no explanation of why exogenous pre-miR-128-2 has an activity in migrating neurons and is therefore presumably processed into the mature form, while endogenous pre-miR-128-2, which is also expressed in these cells, is not."

The opposite is true for miR-128, staining intensity relative to the CP is <i>reduced</i> in the VZ/SVZ and IZ, respectively (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). A similar pattern is seen at E16.5: staining intensity for pre-miR-128-2 in the VZ/SVZ and IZ is slightly reduced compared to the CP (approximately 08:1).

First, postnatal expression of miR-128 during outgrowth is very high compared to the situation in migrating cells at the onset of miR-128 expression (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). Therefore migration may be more sensitive to the sponge than outgrowth, due to the high but limited number of sponge binding sites expressed in each cell (see Broderick and Zamore, 2014 for a discussion of the limitations of competition strategies). Alternatively, since the outgrowth phenotype was substantially mediated by <i>Phf6</i> (as seen in the rescue experiments), it is possible that inappropriate <i>Phf6</i> overexpression due to the sponge does not cause an obvious morphological defect."

To further document <i>Phf6</i> expression patterns, we are providing new in situ data for <i>Phf6</i> using both a highly specific LNA-based probe for mRNA detection and a newly available antibody (now included in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5, A-D</a>).

Generally speaking, in the highly analogous case of shRNA knockdowns it is not usually required to show that the shRNA construct reduces the target protein expression in vivo after in utero electroporation. It should suffice to demonstrate the efficacy and specificity of the shRNA in cell culture and that the biological effect is rescued in vivo by an shRNA-insensitive expression construct. What we have shown is analogous: we show that a <i>Phf6</i> construct lacking the miR-128 recognition sequences in the 3\u2019UTR rescues the migration, outgrowth and electrophysiological phenotypes we see with ectopic miR-128. We show that the three conserved miR-128 binding sites in the <i>Phf6</i> 3\u2019UTR (now described in <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2013figure supplement 1</a>) are recognized in a reporter assay (now shown in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>).

We would also like to say that we consider FACS analysis a fairly heroic effort and hope that it does not become the gold standard, as it requires considerable animal experimentation and the availability of an excellent FACS facility."

Based on our experience with other miRNAs, we do not believe staining of miR-128 positive or deficient cells for <i>Phf6</i> would be quantitatively rigorous, particularly since all available <i>Phf6</i> antibodies require amplification using the TSA system."

The largely reciprocal expression patterns of <i>Phf6</i> and miR-128 are consistent with a role for miR-128 in the regulation of <i>Phf6</i> during radial migration of cortical neurons. We show for the first time that excess miR-128 during development perturbs migration, outgrowth and intrinsic activity of upper layer cortical neurons. We show that exogenous <i>Phf6</i> can rescue these phenotypes. These results are consistent with previous reports on <i>Phf6</i> activity in migration and extend the influence of <i>Phf6</i> to outgrowth and concomitant measures of activity. We hope that the evidence for this regulatory interaction is now on much more solid ground."
