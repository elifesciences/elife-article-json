                    "text": "Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) is a key cell cycle regulator implicated in the development of various cancers, including prostate cancer. However, the functions of PLK1 beyond cell cycle regulation remain poorly characterized. Here, we report that <i>PLK1</i> overexpression in prostate epithelial cells triggers oncogenic transformation. It also results in dramatic transcriptional reprogramming of the cells, leading to epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and stimulation of cell migration and invasion. Consistently, PLK1 downregulation in metastatic prostate cancer cells enhances epithelial characteristics and inhibits cell motility. The signaling mechanisms underlying the observed cellular effects of PLK1 involve direct PLK1-dependent phosphorylation of CRAF with subsequent stimulation of the MEK1/2-ERK1/2-Fra1-ZEB1/2 signaling pathway. Our findings highlight novel non-canonical functions of PLK1 as a key regulator of EMT and cell motility in normal prostate epithelium and prostate cancer. This study also uncovers a previously unanticipated role of PLK1 as a potent activator of MAPK signaling."

However, the functions of PLK1 beyond cell cycle regulation remain poorly characterized. Here, we report that <i>PLK1</i> overexpression in prostate epithelial cells triggers oncogenic transformation. It also results in dramatic transcriptional reprogramming of the cells, leading to epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and stimulation of cell migration and invasion. Consistently, PLK1 downregulation in metastatic prostate cancer cells enhances epithelial characteristics and inhibits cell motility. The signaling mechanisms underlying the observed cellular effects of PLK1 involve direct PLK1-dependent phosphorylation of CRAF with subsequent stimulation of the MEK1/2-ERK1/2-Fra1-ZEB1/2 signaling pathway. Our findings highlight novel non-canonical functions of PLK1 as a key regulator of EMT and cell motility in normal prostate epithelium and prostate cancer. This study also uncovers a previously unanticipated role of PLK1 as a potent activator of MAPK signaling."

In other experiments, the levels of PLK1 in prostate cancer cells were deliberately lowered, which caused the cells to change to become more like epithelial cells and become less mobile. Wu et al. also investigated how PLK1 promotes the EMT and cell migration. These experiments showed that PLK1 activates a protein that controls an important chain of signaling events called the ERK/MAPK pathway, which is essential for cell growth and migration."

It contains a conserved N-terminal kinase catalytic domain and a C-terminal polo-box domain (PBD) that is involved in substrate binding. PLK1 mediates almost every stage of cell division, including mitotic entry, centrosome maturation, bipolar spindle formation, sister chromatid segregation, mitotic exit, and cytokinesis execution (<a href=\"#bib2\">Barr et al., 2004</a>). In addition to its canonical role in mitosis and cytokinesis, recent studies suggest that PLK1 may have other important functions such as regulation of microtubule dynamics, DNA replication, chromosome dynamics, p53 activity, and recovery from the G2 DNA damage checkpoint (<a href=\"#bib39\">Liu et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Song et al., 2011</a>)."

Constitutive expression of <i>Plk1</i> in NIH/3T3 cells causes oncogenic foci formation and these transformed cells are tumorigenic in nude mice (<a href=\"#bib58\">Smith et al., 1997</a>). In contrast, depleting PLK1 in U2OS cells abrogates anchorage-independent growth (<a href=\"#bib13\">Eckerdt et al., 2005</a>). These results highlight PLK1 as a possible driver of oncogenic transformation, although it remains unclear if PLK1 itself is sufficient to induce tumor development. It has been suggested that PLK1 controls cancer development through multiple mechanisms that include canonical regulation of mitosis and cytokinesis, as well as modulation of DNA replication and cell survival (<a href=\"#bib11\">Deeraksa et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Luo and Liu, 2012</a>). Importantly, previous studies reported that increased PLK1 expression levels positively correlate with the invasiveness of colorectal, breast, and thyroid tumors (<a href=\"#bib23\">Han et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Rizki et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Zhang et al., 2012</a>). These data imply a possible role for PLK1 in tumor invasion and metastasis; however, direct evidence supporting this hypothesis and mechanisms of the proinvasive activity of PLK1 during PCa progression are lacking."

Furthermore, they express luminal cytokeratins and do not grow in soft agar or form tumors in nude mice.

We examined the ability of PLK1-overexpressing cells to grow in soft agar, a property that frequently correlates with cell tumorigenicity. Under these conditions, control RWPE-1 cells formed few, if any, colonies in soft agar, whereas RWPE-1\u2013PLK1 cells showed robust colony formation after 3 weeks of growth (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>).

To assess <i>in vivo</i>\u00a0tumorigenicity of PLK1-overexpressing prostate epithelial cells, control RWPE-1 or RWPE-1\u2013PLK1 cells were injected subcutaneously into the flanks of NOD/SCID/\u03b3<sub>c</sub><sup>null</sup> (NSG) mice (<a href=\"#bib15\">Fu et al., 2003</a>).

Since PLK1 is a crucial regulator of the cell cycle, it may promote epithelial cell motility indirectly by stimulating cell proliferation. To rule out this indirect effect, we compared the random movement of individual RWPE-1\u2013PLK1 cells to that of control RWPE-1 cells using time-lapse microscopy. Both migratory distance and velocity were significantly higher in RWPE-1-PLK1 cells compared to control RWPE-1 cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E\u2212G</a>, <a href=\"#media1\">Videos 1</a>, <a href=\"#media2\">2</a>).

EMT is believed to play key roles in tumor progression and metastasis by enabling a switch from the stationary epithelial-like cell phenotype to the motile mesenchymal phenotype. On a molecular level, EMT is characterized by the decreased expression of epithelial markers and the increased expression of mesenchymal markers. In order to investigate whether <i>PLK1</i> overexpression triggers EMT in RWPE-1 cell, we examined the expression of most of the characteristic epithelial and mesenchymal markers. Remarkably, relative to control RWPE-1 cells, RWPE-1\u2013PLK1 cells downregulated epithelial markers (E-cadherin and cytokeratin 19) and upregulated mesenchymal markers (N-cadherin, vimentin, fibronectin, and SM22), at both the mRNA and protein levels (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,C</a>). The switch from epithelial to mesenchymal markers did not depend on the stages of the cell cycle (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In agreement with the results obtained in RWPE-1 cells, <i>PLK1</i> overexpression also induced an EMT-like phenotype in PrEC cells (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Furthermore, we compared induction of EMT in cells expressing wild-type (WT), constitutively active (TD), or kinase-defective (KM) PLK1. Constitutively active PLK1 induced the most robust reprogramming of gene expression in RWPE-1 cells, whereas expression of kinase inactive PLK1 failed to induce EMT (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). These results suggest that a PLK1-mediated phosphorylation event contributes to the induction of EMT in prostate epithelial cells. Importantly, <i>PLK1</i> overexpression in RWPE-1 cells disrupted localization of E-cadherin, \u03b2-catenin, and junctional adhesion molecule (JAM)-A at the areas of cell-cell contacts, thereby indicating profound disassembly of adherens and tight junctions (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>, arrows). This was accompanied by dramatic reorganization of the actomyosin cytoskeleton manifested by redistribution of non-muscle myosin IIB from the perijunctional F-actin bundles into basal stress fibers (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>, arrowheads). Taken together, these data demonstrate induction of EMT in PLK1-overexpressing prostate epithelial cells, which is likely to promote a pro-motile phenotype by disrupting intercellular adhesions and creating isolated mesenchymal cells with invasive properties (<a href=\"#bib47\">Moreno-Bueno et al., 2008</a>)."

To exclude the effects of severe PLK1 depletion on growth inhibition and cell death, stable cell lines with partial PLK1 knockdown using a lentivirus encoding shRNA that targets the 3\u2019-UTR of PLK1 were established using 2 known metastatic PCa cell lines (DU145 and C4-2B). Downregulation of PLK1 expression in these cells was confirmed by immunoblotting (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). As shown in <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, the partial PLK1 knockdown did not affect cell cycle progression and did not trigger cell apoptosis. Importantly, PLK1 downregulation promoted an epithelial phenotype in PCa cells by decreasing the expression of mesenchymal markers and increasing E-cadherin expression, inducing morphological alterations to a more epithelial-like appearance, and triggering the assembly of intercellular junctions (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2212C</a>). Furthermore, downregulation of PLK1 expression resulted in significant attenuation of PCa cell motility based on both wound closure and Matrigel invasion assays (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D,E</a>). All the observed changes induced by PLK1 knockdown were reversed by re-expression of WT PLK1, but not by kinase-defective KM PLK1 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2212E</a>)."

Downregulation of ZEB2 increased the expression of E-cadherin and cytokeratin 19, while it decreased the levels of N-cadherin, fibronectin, and vimentin; conversely, depletion of ZEB1 was less effective and primarily decreased vimentin expression (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>).

Aberrant activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MAPK/ERK) pathway has been shown to contribute to tumor invasion and progression, and has recently been linked to the EMT process (<a href=\"#bib51\">Reddy et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Shin et al., 2010</a>). Therefore, we examined the effect of <i>PLK1</i> overexpression on the activation status of key molecular constituents of the ERK signaling cascade. <i>PLK1</i> overexpression in RWPE-1 cells resulted in increased phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and its upstream kinase MEK1/2 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>), thereby indicating activation of MEK1/2-ERK1/2 signaling. Consistently, we also detected enhanced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in PLK1-overexpressing PrEC cells (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In order to determine the potential causal role of the MEK/ERK pathway in PLK1-induced EMT and accelerated motility of prostate epithelial cells, we blocked this pathway with RO5126766, a highly selective dual inhibitor of MEK and its upstream kinase, RAF (<a href=\"#bib43\">Martinez-Garcia et al., 2012</a>). Exposure of RWPE-1\u2013PLK1 cells to RO5126766 abrogated ERK activation, reduced expression of ZEB1 and ZEB2, and completely reversed the biochemical manifestation of EMT (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>).

Recent studies have uncovered Fra-1 as an essential player in the ERK/ZEB signaling pathway, which induces EMT and cell migration (<a href=\"#bib57\">Shin et al., 2010</a>). Fra1 belongs to the <i>Fos</i> gene family, whose protein products can dimerize with protein of the JUN family, thereby forming the transcription factor complex AP-1. Ectopic expression of Fra1 in epithelioid cells resulted in morphologic changes that resemble fibroblastoid conversion, and increased motility and invasiveness (<a href=\"#bib36\">Kustikova et al., 1998</a>). Fra1 has been implicated as a potent regulator of anti-apoptosis, cell motility, and invasion in a variety of tumor cell types (<a href=\"#bib46\">Milde-Langosch, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Young and Colburn, 2006</a>). Based on these data, we sought to elucidate if Fra1 is essential for PLK1-induced EMT and accelerated cell motility in PCa. Overexpression of PLK1 in RWPE-1 cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>) and PrEC cells (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) resulted in increased Fra1 expression at both the mRNA and protein levels compared to control cells. Moreover, knocking down Fra1 in RPWE-1\u2013PLK1 cells significantly decreased ZEB1/2 expression and reversed the biochemical signature of the EMT (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Importantly, Fra1 depletion reversed the increased wound healing and Matrigel invasiveness and restored assembly of intercellular junctions in PLK1-overexpressing RWPE-1 cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D\u2013F</a>). These data highlight Fra1 as a crucial molecular effector connecting ERK activation and induction of ZEB1/2 expression in the PLK1-induced signaling pathway leading to EMT and increased motility of PCa cells."

Oncogenic CRAF causes EMT and invasion (<a href=\"#bib27\">Hou et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Lan et al., 2004</a>). To determine the involvement of CRAF in PLK1-induced EMT and accelerated motility of prostate epithelial cells, we determined if CRAF is activated in RWPE-1\u2013PLK1 cells. It has been reported that phosphorylation of CRAF at S338 and S339 is essential for its activation and that the first essential role of CRAF kinase activity is to autophosphorylate S621 (<a href=\"#bib12\">Diaz et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Noble et al., 2008</a>). S621 phosphorylation plays a critical role in preventing CRAF proteasome-mediated degradation (<a href=\"#bib50\">Noble et al., 2008</a>). Immunoblotting analysis with antibodies specifically recognizing those 2 different phosphorylated sites (S338 and S339) demonstrated a significant increase in CRAF phosphorylation following <i>PLK1</i> overexpression (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). Furthermore, CRAF autophosphorylation of S621 was also significantly elevated upon <i>PLK1</i> overexpression (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). Downregulation of CRAF expression by a specific shRNA caused several prominent biochemical alterations in PLK1-overexpressing RWPE-1 cells. These alterations include inhibition of ERK signaling manifested by decreased MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation; decreased expression of Fra1, ZEB1, and ZEB2; and complete reversal of EMT-like expressional reprogramming of prostate epithelial cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). Moreover, CRAF depletion restored assembly of intercellular junctions and suppressed wound healing and Matrigel invasion of PLK1-overexpressing RWPE-1 cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C\u2013E</a>). These results demonstrate that CRAF plays an essential role in PLK1-induced EMT and cell motility."

Phosphorylation of CRAF at S338, S339, and S621 was significantly elevated in cells expressing WT or TD PLK1, but not KM PLK1 (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a>). Cells expressing TD PLK1 displayed higher levels of phosphorylated CRAF compared to those with WT PLK1 (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a>). These data suggest that the enzymatic activity of PLK1 is both directly and indirectly responsible for those phosphorylation events. Consistently, phosphorylated ERK was significantly increased in cells expressing WT or TD PLK1, but not KM PLK1 (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E</a>), suggesting that a PLK1-induced phosphorylation event triggers the activation of ERK signaling. On the other hand, shRNA-mediated downregulation of PLK1 led to dramatic reduction of CRAF phosphorylation at S338, S339, and S621, which was rescued by WT PLK1, but not KM PLK1 (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8F</a> and <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Furthermore, inhibition of ERK signaling, manifested by decreased MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation along with reduced expression of Fra1, ZEB1, and ZEB2, was observed upon PLK1 knock down, and these effects were reversed by re-expressing WT, but not KM PLK1 (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8F</a> and <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). To further confirm that PLK1 directly phosphorylates CRAF at S338 and S339, cells were synchronized in M phase by nocodazole treatment followed by a transient inhibition of PLK1 activity with 2 different concentrations of BI 2536 for 30\u2009min. Significant reduction in phosphorylation of CRAF at S338 and S339 was immediately observed upon treatment with the higher dose of the PLK1 inhibitor (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8G</a>), thereby suggesting that PLK1 indeed directly phosphorylates CRAF at S338 and S339. Furthermore, when we blocked the PLK1 phosphorylation sites on CRAF by mutating S338 and S339 to alanines (CRAF-A/A), S621 phosphorylation was significantly diminished as compared to WT CRAF or the phospho-mimetic mutant (CRAF-D/E) (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8H</a>), suggesting that PLK1-induced phosphorylation of CRAF at S338 and S339 contributes to the CRAF autophosphorylation of S621. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that PLK1 is responsible for phosphorylation-mediated activation of CRAF, which leads to CRAF autophosphorylation."

In order to elucidate the mechanisms of this selective upregulation of CRAF protein, we asked whether PLK1 can stabilize CRAF. Cells were treated with cycloheximide to inhibit <i>de novo</i> protein synthesis and the expression level of CRAF was compared at different time points (0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 15\u2009hr) in control cells and cells overexpressing different forms of PLK1 (WT, TD, and KM). Immunoblotting analysis demonstrated significant degradation of CRAF in control cells and cells expressing an inactive PLK1-KM mutation (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8I</a>). CRAF degradation was inhibited by MG132 (a proteasome inhibitor), but not by chloroquine (a lysosomal inhibitor) (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8J</a>). In contrast, no significant CRAF degradation was observed in cells overexpressing either WT PLK1 or its constitutively active TD mutant (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8I</a>). Given the previous finding that CRAF autophosphorylation of S621 is critical for preventing its degradation (<a href=\"#bib50\">Noble et al., 2008</a>) and our observations that PLK1 phosphorylation of CRAF leads to its activation and subsequent autophosphorylation at S621 (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A\u2013H</a>), we hypothesized that PLK1-induced phosphorylation of CRAF contributes to CRAF stabilization by promoting its autophosphorylation. To corroborate the previous findings from another group (<a href=\"#bib50\">Noble et al., 2008</a>), we mutated S621 of CRAF to alanine (CRAF-S621A) or aspartate (CRAF-S621D) and examined their stability. Consistently, CRAF-S621A displayed a much shorter half-life when compared to WT CRAF or CRAF-S621D (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8K</a>). Importantly, the CRAF-A/A mutant (lacking PLK1-mediated phosphorylation) was quickly degraded over a 15-h time course (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8K</a>), which is in agreement with our observation that the CRAF-A/A mutant harbors a much lower level of S621 phosphorylation (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8H</a>). In sharp contrast, the CRAF WT and the CRAF-D/E mutant showed minimal degradation during that period of time (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8K</a>). These results demonstrate that PLK1 increases the stability of CRAF protein by preventing proteasome degradation."

However, our study is the first to demonstrate the causal role of PLK1 in regulating cancer cell motility. Indeed, by using a combination of gain- and loss-of-function approaches, we established that PLK1 is necessary and sufficient to promote both planar migration and invasion of prostate epithelial cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig2\">2</a>).

Indeed, overexpression of PLK1 induced EMT-like alterations in prostate epithelial cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>), whereas PLK1 knockdown restored epithelial features of invasive prostate cancer cell lines (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). This PLK1-dependent regulation of cell phenotype has not been previously reported in any cell type, and it is likely to underlie the observed effects of PLK1 on epithelial cell motility. There are several potential mechanisms by which the induction of EMT can promote cell motility. One mechanism involves disassembly of epithelial junctions that weaken intercellular adhesions, thereby allowing cell dissemination (<a href=\"#bib19\">Godde et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Le Bras et al., 2012</a>). Another mechanism involves rearrangement of the actomyosin cytoskeleton from epithelia-specific perijunctional bundles to basal stress fibers that are characteristic of mesenchymal cells. This rearrangement enhances cell-matrix adhesion and enables more efficient cell migration (<a href=\"#bib42\">Martin et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Yilmaz and Christofori, 2009</a>). We observed both junctional disassembly and cytoskeletal rearrangements in prostate epithelial cells undergoing PLK1-mediated EMT (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). Our finding that <i>PLK1</i> overexpression potently induced EMT in prostate epithelium is important given recent evidence highlighting EMT as an emerging mechanism of PCa progression, metastasis, and therapeutic resistance. For instance, several EMT markers, such as vimentin and N-cadherin, are commonly expressed in circulating tumor cells from patients with relapsed metastatic PCa (<a href=\"#bib1\">Armstrong et al., 2011</a>). A 'cadherin switch' with increased N-cadherin and reduced E-cadherin expression has been associated with relapse after PCa surgery and development of metastatic disease (<a href=\"#bib21\">Gravdal et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Umbas et al., 1992</a>). Work from Reiter\u2019s group demonstrates a central role for N-cadherin in PCa metastasis (<a href=\"#bib64\">Tanaka et al., 2010</a>). Finally, the levels of ZEB proteins positively correlate with Gleason grading and PCa metastasis (<a href=\"#bib20\">Graham et al., 2008</a>)."

                        "text": "Through a series of biochemical analyses, we delineated the molecular mechanism underlying PLK1-mediated cell motility and EMT. Previous studies demonstrated that CRAF-MEK1/2-ERK1/2 signaling plays a crucial role in the regulation of EMT as well as cell migration and invasion in several cancers (<a href=\"#bib5\">Birchmeier et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Hay and Zuk, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Schoenenberger et al., 1991</a>). The CRAF-MEK1/2-ERK1/2 pathway is regulated by Ras as well as various kinases including Src, PKC, and PAK (<a href=\"#bib33\">King et al., 1998</a>). In this study, we discovered a novel regulatory pathway for MAPK signaling. We demonstrated that CRAF is a physiological substrate of PLK1 (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). CRAF consists of a N-terminal regulatory domain and a C-terminal catalytic domain. The 'N-region', located at the N-terminal of the kinase domain, contains the critical activating phosphorylation sites, S338 and S339 (<a href=\"#bib12\">Diaz et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Edin and Juliano, 2005</a>). S338 can be phosphorylated by the p21 activated kinase (PAKs) (<a href=\"#bib33\">King et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Chaudhary et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Sun et al., 2000</a>) and other as yet unidentified kinases (<a href=\"#bib9\">Chiloeches et al., 2001</a>). Our data support a dual-mechanism model of PLK1-mediated regulation of CRAF signaling (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8L</a>): PLK1 directly interacts with and phosphorylates CRAF at S338 and S339, which leads to CRAF activation. The activated CRAF undergoes autophosphorylation of S621, thereby preventing proteasome-mediated degradation of CRAF, which generates a positive-feedback loop, leading to a further increase in CRAF level and activity. This activation event triggers the activation of downstream MEK1/2-ERK1/2 signaling in prostate epithelial cells overexpressing PLK1 (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8L</a>). Consistently, Mielgo et al. reported that PLK1 associates with CRAF and that this interaction does not require CRAF kinase activity (<a href=\"#bib45\">Mielgo et al., 2011</a>). Interestingly, they also found that CRAF indirectly promotes PLK1 activation (<a href=\"#bib45\">Mielgo et al., 2011</a>). This adds an additional layer of complexity to the PLK1-CRAF interplay to further activate CRAF. In addition, PLK1 may differentially trigger distinct signaling pathways under different physiological conditions. For instance, PLK1 can directly activate MEK/ERK signaling through phosphorylation of the MEK activating site in airway smooth muscle cells (<a href=\"#bib30\">Jiang and Tang, 2015</a>), although that is not the case for PCa (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>)."

These results indicate that PLK1 promotes EMT and motility through the CRAF-MEK1/2-ERK1/2-Fra1-ZEB1/2 pathway in prostate epithelial cells. These findings highlight PLK1 as a critical molecular rheostat that controls phenotypic plasticity of normal prostate epithelial cells as well as PCa progression and dissemination. Identification of the CRAF-MEK1/2-ERK1/2 signaling cascade as an essential downstream effector of PLK1 in prostate epithelial cells corresponds with the known roles of this cascade in the pathogenesis of various types of cancer, including PCa (<a href=\"#bib44\">McCubrey et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Roberts and Der, 2007</a>). Given the fact that the frequency of <i>Ras</i> gene mutations in prostate tumors is low (<a href=\"#bib6\">Carter et al., 1990</a>), PLK1-induced activation of CRAF provides mechanistic insights into the aberrant activation of CRAF-MEK1/2-ERK1/2 signaling frequently detected in PCa. Future experiments will further establish PLK1-mediated regulation of CRAF-MEK1/2-ERK1/2 signaling in patients with PCa. Interestingly, it was reported that ERK2/Fra1/ZEB1/2 signaling is responsible for induction of EMT in RasG12V-transformed MCF10A cells (<a href=\"#bib57\">Shin et al., 2010</a>), suggesting that ERK/Fra1/ZEB signaling could be a common pathway to induce EMT in mammalian epithelial cells."

The current dogma in the field implies that PLK1 controls cancer development through multiple mechanisms, including canonical regulation of mitosis and cytokinesis as well as modulation of DNA replication and cell survival (<a href=\"#bib11\">Deeraksa et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Luo and Liu, 2012</a>). Whether and how PLK1 drives PCa metastasis <i>in vivo</i> remain to be elucidated. Our xenograft studies showed that <i>PLK1</i> overexpression in human prostate epithelial cells leads to cellular transformation <i>in vitro</i> and promotes tumor formation in NSG mice, which suggests that PLK1 has a tumor-promoting role in the prostate. Strikingly, NSG mice engrafted with RWPE-1\u2013PLK1 cells developed lung micrometastases at a high frequency (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), which provides <i>in vivo</i> evidence that PLK1 plays a role in PCa invasion and metastasis. Our study establishes the role of PLK1 in the induction of EMT and stimulation of cell motility, which adds a novel and previously unanticipated role for PLK1 during PCa development. Furthermore, our observation that partial downregulation of PLK1 in metastatic PCa cells has no effect on cell cycle progression and cell viability suggests that a low level of PLK1 is sufficient to maintain cell viability and regulate the cell cycle. In contrast, upregulation of PLK1 promotes its non-canonical functions, including stimulation of EMT and acceleration of cell motility. This could explain why normal cells develop a complex system to tightly control the level and activity of PLK1 throughout the cell cycle, and how increased PLK1 promotes tumorigenesis."

Loss of cell-cell contacts and reorganization of the intracellular cytoskeleton during EMT results in increased cell migration and invasion (<a href=\"#bib47\">Moreno-Bueno et al., 2008</a>). This allows cells to invade the surrounding stroma and vasculature, which leads to tumor dissemination and metastases (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hugo et al., 2007</a>). However, the mechanisms that drive EMT in PCa remain elusive (<a href=\"#bib21\">Gravdal et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Howard et al., 2008</a>). This study provides strong evidence that PLK1 is a key regulator of EMT in prostate epithelial cells and in PCa, which represents an underlying mechanism for PLK1-driven PCa progression and spreading. EMT also enables cancer cells to avoid apoptosis, anoikis, and oncogene addiction (<a href=\"#bib31\">Jordan et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Tiwari et al., 2012</a>). An emerging mechanism of EMT is reprogramming epithelial cells into cancer stem cells that have been strongly associated with resistance to chemotherapy and disease recurrence (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chang et al., 2013</a>). Whether PLK1-induced EMT contributes to these oncogenic processes will need further investigation. Interestingly, the low level of endogenous PLK1 observed in RWPE-1 cells appears to be sufficient to mediate growth-factor\u2013induced EMT (<a href=\"#fig3s4\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). This suggests that in tumor cells that do not overexpress PLK1, the low level of PLK1 that is required for cell division could also mediate induction of EMT under certain circumstances, such as in the tumor microenvironment. This finding would have important implications in targeting PLK1 for anticancer treatments. For instance, targeting PLK1 might be applied to a wide variety of cancers, regardless of their PLK1 expression levels, to prevent induction of EMT and tumor metastasis. Including PLK1 inhibitors in current standard therapeutic regimens could expand the scope of clinical efficacy that currently available drugs have established."

This previously unanticipated pro-migratory activity of PLK1 is driven by direct phosphorylation and activation of CRAF, which results in enhanced signaling through the MEK1/2-ERK1/2-Fra1-ZEB1/2 pathway. The insights gained from this study will fundamentally advance our understanding of the oncogenic functions of PLK1 and the molecular basis of PCa development and metastatic dissemination, which have the potential to facilitate optimization of treatment regimens targeting PLK1 signaling to significantly enhance anticancer efficacy. Furthermore, our novel findings may be generalizable to many other cancers since preliminary clinical evidence suggests that PLK1 is involved in the development of several other human cancers."

Mechanistically, overexpression of PLK1 was found to activate MEK/ERK via direct phosphorylation and stabilization of CRAF at S338. Activated ERK kinase has been reported by others to upregulate FRA1, which in turn induces ZEB1/2 to promote EMT, consistent with their conclusions. The reviewers' main concern is that essentially all the experiments rely on PLK1 overexpression, which may or may not be physiological, with only two PLK1 knockdown experiments shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> and <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8F</a>."

More importantly, although overexpression of PLK1 was able to induce EMT, the data in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> about endogenous PLK1 on EMT are not convincing. First, only a single shRNA was used and there was no re-expression control (see concerns in point 3). Second, it is unclear whether PLK1 is differentially expressed and/or activated in the metastatic cell lines used in this figure compared to the non-metastatic lines used in the rest of the study. In this regard, it would also be important to determine, whether PLK1 is involved in any physiological EMT events, such as TGF\u03b2-induced EMT."

Immunoblotting analyses of four EMT gene products are not sufficient evidence to support the conclusion that knockdown of PLK1 blocked EMT and caused partial MET. Morphological and immunostaining analyses are needed in addition. In addition, a standard system to analyze EMT in prostate cancer is \"ARCaP, ARCaP-E and ARCaP-M\", and these gold standard cell lines for studying EMT in prostate cancer field could be used to verify the EMT results."

This experiment needs to be repeated with additional PLK1 shRNAs, combined with re-expression of shRNA-resistant WT and kinase-dead PLK1 to establish that the observed effect on CRAF effect is due to loss of PLK1 kinase activity. This is particularly important because the level of CRAF protein was significantly reduced by the PLK1 shRNA, which could account at least in part for its decreased phosphorylation. At the same time, the consequences of knocking down endogenous PLK1 on activation of the rest of the ERK/FRA1/ZEB pathway needs to be analyzed using the same controls. Since PLK1 is generally believed to be essential for cell cycle progression, the authors should also analyze the cell cycle distribution of the cells to determine if this might account for any observed change when PLK1 is knocked down. In addition, depletion of Plk1 not only enriches cells in mitosis, but subsequently induces apoptosis in a broad range of cancer cells, and this could also attenuate migration and lead to a reduced expression or decay/degradation of mesenchymal markers (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>) and CRAF (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8F</a>). For this reason, it would also be informative to carry out and include apoptosis assays."

(Nat Med. 17:1641) reported that PLK1 and CRAF associate, but they concluded that CRAF pS338 is upstream of PLK1 activation, rather than, as you propose, PLK1 being upstream of CRAF activation. In addition, Jiang and Tang (Respir Res 16:93) reported that PLK1 can activate MEK/ERK, although that study suggested the activation was CRAF pS338-independent, with PLK1 phosphorylating MEK activating sites.
