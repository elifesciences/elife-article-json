Yet the molecular determinants of allosteric connectivity in tyrosine kinase domain are incompletely understood. By means of structural (X-ray and NMR) and functional characterization of pathogenic gain-of-function mutations affecting the FGF receptor (FGFR) tyrosine kinase domain, we elucidated a long-distance allosteric network composed of four interconnected sites termed the \u2018molecular brake\u2019, \u2018DFG latch\u2019, \u2018A-loop plug\u2019, and \u2018\u03b1C tether\u2019. The first three sites repress the kinase from adopting an active conformation, whereas the \u03b1C tether promotes the active conformation. The skewed design of this four-site allosteric network imposes tight autoinhibition and accounts for the incomplete mimicry of the activated conformation by pathogenic mutations targeting a single site. Based on the structural similarity shared among RTKs, we propose that this allosteric model for FGFR kinases is applicable to other RTKs."

Yet the molecular determinants of allosteric connectivity in tyrosine kinase domain are incompletely understood. By means of structural (X-ray and NMR) and functional characterization of pathogenic gain-of-function mutations affecting the FGF receptor (FGFR) tyrosine kinase domain, we elucidated a long-distance allosteric network composed of four interconnected sites termed the \u2018molecular brake\u2019, \u2018DFG latch\u2019, \u2018A-loop plug\u2019, and \u2018\u03b1C tether\u2019. The first three sites repress the kinase from adopting an active conformation, whereas the \u03b1C tether promotes the active conformation. The skewed design of this four-site allosteric network imposes tight autoinhibition and accounts for the incomplete mimicry of the activated conformation by pathogenic mutations targeting a single site. Based on the structural similarity shared among RTKs, we propose that this allosteric model for FGFR kinases is applicable to other RTKs."

The structures of normal and mutant forms of the FGF receptor were determined using X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Combining these results with activity data from the diseased receptors revealed four key interdependent sites in the protein that play essential roles in maintaining the receptors in an inhibited state. Disease-causing mutations are generally located in these sites, and take advantage of their interdependence to make the kinase active more frequently, even when the receptor domain is not bound to a signaling molecule."

The 58 human RTKs are divided into\u00a0~17 subfamilies, each featuring unique architectures in their extracellular domain that are specialized to bind and mediate the biological actions of distinct growth factors, cytokines and hormones such as EGF, FGF, PDGF, VEGF, IGF, insulin and NGF (<a href=\"#bib43\">Lemmon and Schlessinger, 2010</a>). The divergent extracellular domains of RTK subfamilies are linked via a single transmembrane helix to the intracellular domain that harbors the conserved tyrosine kinase domain. Despite exhibiting major structural diversity in their ectodomains, all RTKs must rely on the universal process of ligand-induced dimerization or rearrangement of preformed dimers to elevate the intrinsic activity of the intracellular kinase domain (<a href=\"#bib43\">Lemmon and Schlessinger, 2010</a>). In the case of EGFR subfamily, receptor dimerization facilitates the formation of an asymmetric kinase dimer, wherein a donor kinase allosterically stabilizes the active conformation of the receiver kinase (<a href=\"#bib42\">Kovacs et al., 2015</a>). Other RTK subfamilies require trans-phosphorylation on regulatory tyrosines located in the activation loop (A-loop) in order to trigger activation. Analysis of crystal structures of unphosphorylated receptor tyrosine kinase domains representing every RTK subfamily show that in the resting state (i.e. in the absence of extracellular ligand engagement) kinase domains are autoinhibited through a variety of mechanisms (<a href=\"#bib35\">Huse and Kuriyan, 2002</a>). In the case of insulin receptor, MUSK, and TRK subfamilies, kinase autoinhibition is mediated by the A-loop itself whereby the conserved DFG motif at the N-terminal end of the A-loop blocks ATP binding and a regulatory tyrosine at the C-terminus of the A-loop acts as a\u00a0pseudo substrate competing with substrate binding (<a href=\"#bib34\">Hubbard, 2002</a>). In another model based on the crystal structure of FLT3\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib27\">Griffith et al., 2004</a>), the juxtamembrane region located outside the conserved kinase domain is involved in maintaining the autoinhibited kinase conformation along with the A-loop. Hydrophobic residues from the juxtamembrane insert into the ATP binding cleft to both compete with ATP binding and to facilitate the inactive conformation of the A-loop. Akin to the first model, a regulatory tyrosine in the A-loop inserts in the substrate binding site and acts as a competitive inhibitor (<a href=\"#bib34\">Hubbard, 2002</a>). In the case of the FGFR, KIT, PDGFR, and VEGFR subfamilies, kinase autoinhibition is principally mediated by a network of hydrogen bonds in the vicinity of the kinase hinge region that constrains the ability of the kinase to adopt the active conformation (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chen et al., 2007</a>). Additionally, in FGFR kinase an arginine at the C-terminal end of the A-loop makes a salt-bridge with the catalytic base resulting in occlusion of the enzyme\u2019s active site\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib51\">Mohammadi et al., 1996</a>)."

The available structures of A-loop phosphorylated kinases each display a salt-bridge between the phosphotyrosine and a conserved arginine residue within the A-loop that causes a dramatic structural rearrangement of the A-loop (<a href=\"#bib35\">Huse and Kuriyan, 2002</a>). This conformational change sets in motion a series of poorly characterized long-range allosteric events that ultimately enables the kinase to adopt the active conformation (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chen et al., 2007</a>). While crystal structures have provided atomistic insight into the two major conformational states (i.e. autoinhibited and activated forms), the role of enzyme dynamics and allosteric communication involved in this structural change can only be indirectly inferred from the static depictions."

Indeed, structural and biochemical analyses of gain-of-function mutations mapping to the kinase hinge region led us to identify a network of hydrogen bonds formed by three residues termed the molecular brake that suppress the ability of FGFR kinase to attain the active conformation (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chen et al., 2007</a>). Mutation at each of the three constituents of the molecular brake disrupts the network of hydrogen bonds resulting in a profound increase in the intrinsic kinase activity of FGFRs and a variety of human skeletal disorders and cancers. More recently, through crystallographic and solution NMR analyses of five pathogenic FGFR2 kinases at a conserved lysine in the A-loop (the second hotspot), we showed that these mutations introduce additional hydrogen bonding or hydrophobic contacts to differentially stabilize the active conformation of the A-loop (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chen et al., 2013</a>) in a dynamic two-state equilibrium regimen. In this model, FGFR kinase domain toggles between a conformationally rigid autoinhibited state and a conformationally flexible activated state. Notably, the kinase activity was found to directly correlate with the fractional population of the active state."

Our data reveal two clusters of hydrophobic interactions, termed \u2018DFG latch\u2019 and \u2018\u03b1C tether\u2019, which\u00a0relay allosteric signals between the A-loop and the molecular brake. These hydrophobic networks, located strategically at the interface between the N- and C-lobes of the kinase, sense the structural fluctuations in the A-loop and molecular brake and undergo rearrangements to determine the kinase interlobe angle and hence kinase activation. Naturally occurring pathogenic and acquired drug-resistant mutations seize the four-site allosteric control pathway to bias the kinase equilibrium toward the active state thereby causing excessive signaling in human skeletal disorders and cancers. In addition to enriching our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of FGFR-related diseases, these findings are anticipated to make a major impact for ongoing drug discovery efforts targeting FGFRs and other RTKs such as PDGFRs, KIT, VEGFRs, and CSF1R that share the four-site allosteric mechanism."

Notably, in these pathogenic kinases, the hydrogen bond network at the molecular brake located 25 \u00c5 from the site of mutation was disrupted indicating that conformational changes of the A-loop propagate across the enzyme via long-range allostery (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Previously, we also solved crystal structures of pathogenic FGFR2Ks (N549H, N549T, E565A, E565G, K641R) that directly target the three constituents of the molecular brake, namely N549, E565 and K641, and showed that these mutations disrupt the autoinhibitory network of hydrogen bonds leading to profound kinase activation (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chen et al., 2007</a>). Surprisingly, however, the A-loop conformation and angle between the N- and C-lobes of the kinase in these mutants remained identical to unphosphorylated wild-type (WT) FGFR2K (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). This observation prompted us to consider the possibility that crystal packing contacts might have affected the A-loop conformation in these molecular brake mutant structures.

First, the location of the \u03b1C helix in the unphosphorylated FGFR2K crystal structure is very similar to that in the phosphorylated active FGFR1K and FGFR2K and mutationally activated FGFR3K<b><sup>K650E</sup></b> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>); second, the conformation of the first seven residues of the A-loop (DFGLARD) in the unphosphorylated FGFR2K matches those of the phosphorylated activated FGFR1K and FGFR2K and the mutationally activated FGFR3K<b><sup>K650E</sup></b> including \u03b29 strand formation, which is a characteristic feature of the activated kinases (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>); third, the substrate tyrosine binding site in the unphosphorylated FGFR2K is fully accessible which is in stark contrast to that in the unphosphorylated FGFR1K (PDB ID: 3KY2 [<a href=\"#bib3\">Bae et al., 2010</a>]) and FGFR4K (PDB ID: 4QQT [<a href=\"#bib32\">Huang et al., 2015</a>]) where a prominent salt-bridge between an FGFR-invariant arginine from the A-loop and the catalytic base occludes the active site, which we have termed the A-loop plug (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Notably in the crystal structures of the unphosphorylated FGFR2K (2PSQ) and its molecular brake mutants (2Q0B, 2PWL, 2PZ5, 2PY3, 2PZR), a tightly bound sulfate ion occupies a similar location as the phosphate moiety of the phosphorylated A-loop tyrosine 657 (pTyr-657) in the phosphorylated active FGFR2K structure. This sulfate ion makes hydrogen bonds with the invariant arginine from the DFGLARD motif reminiscent of pTyr-657 in the phosphorylated active FGFR2K. Hence, it appears that the partially active kinase conformation seen in the crystal structures of the unphosphorylated WT FGFR2K (2PSQ) and its molecular brake mutants have been influenced by crystal packing and the presence of the sulfate ion trapped in the A-loop."

                                "text": "In light of this ambiguity, we tried crystallizing the unphosphorylated FGFR2K in different space groups in hopes of eliminating the bias introduced by the lattice contacts on the A-loop conformation in <i>2PSQ</i>. However, these attempts were to no avail. We would like to mention that other groups have faced the same problem with FGFR2K crystals (<a href=\"#bib22\">Eathiraj et al., 2011</a>). Evidently, strong lattice contact forces prevail and conceal a truly autoinhibited conformation of the A-loop in the unphosphorylated form of FGFR2K. Hence, we decided to use NMR spectroscopy to assess the conformation of the unphosphorylated FGFR2K in solution (i.e. free of crystal lattice contacts). Guided by crystallographic data, two sets of NMR experiments were designed to obtain proximity information between the A-loop and the C-lobe in the unphosphorylated form of FGFR2K in solution. According to the crystal structures, the A-loop tyrosines in unphosphorylated FGFR1K (and FGFR4K) are tethered to the C-lobe, whereas in the\u00a0unphosphorylated FGFR2K the A-loop including the tyrosines are stabilized away from the C-lobe by the favorable lattice contacts. Notably, in all the activated forms of FGFRKs, the A-loop adopts a common open conformation and makes few contacts with the C-lobe. Hence, if the A-loop tyrosines in the unphosphorylated FGFR2K were positioned similarly as in FGFR1K (and FGFR4K) then upon A-loop phosphorylation, the residues in the C-lobe of FGFR2K would be expected to experience chemical shift perturbations. Plotting of the chemical shift differences between the unphosphorylated and monophosphorylated (pY657) activated FGFR2K onto the crystal structures of unphosphorylated FGFR1K (3KY2) and FGFR2K (2PSQ) shows significant perturbations for several residues in the C-lobe including the \u03b1EF helix (L675), \u03b1F helix (V691), and \u03b1G helix (I707, V709, E711, L712, F713, K717, E718, and M722) (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). These NMR results cannot be reconciled with the observed conformation of the A-loop in the FGFR2K structure (2PSQ) as the A-loop tyrosines in this structure do not interact with these perturbed residues in the C-lobe. Hence, the chemical shift mapping analysis implies that the true autoinhibited conformation of the A-loop in FGFR2K is more similar to that observed in crystal structures of FGFR1K (3KY2) and FGFR4K (4QQT) than in the unphosphorylated FGFR2K structure. In addition to mapping chemical shift differences, we also carried out paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) experiments to directly probe the distance between the A-loop tyrosines and the C-lobe of the enzyme. PRE effects are strong up to a distance of\u00a0~20 \u00c5 for nitroxide spin labels and start to dissipate at distances longer than\u00a0~25 \u00c5. Since PRE experiments require a surface-exposed free cysteine for covalently attaching a paramagnetic spin label onto the protein, we mutated I707 to cysteine. Located in the \u03b1G helix of FGFR2K, I707 is ideally suited to discern the A-loop conformational difference between unphosphorylated FGFR2K (2PSQ) and FGFR1K/FGFR4K (3KY2/4QQT) structures (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). In the unphosphorylated FGFR2K structure (2PSQ), the C\u03b3 of I707 and the nitrogen atom of Y656 are\u00a0~27 \u00c5 apart, whereas the corresponding distance between V704 and Y653 in FGFR1K (3KY2) is much shorter (~15 \u00c5). Following selective enrichment with <sup>15</sup>N tyrosine, the I707C FGFR2K mutant was covalently reacted with MTSL nitroxide (1-oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-3-pyrroline-3-methyl)-methanethiosulfonate), and <sup>1</sup>H/<sup>15</sup>N HSQC spectra were then acquired on both the oxidized (paramagnetic) and reduced forms (diamagnetic; treated with ascorbic acid) of the MTSL labeled I707C mutant (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). The intensity retentions were calculated by dividing the peak heights for the oxidized and reduced sample spectra, and following the approach from Battiste and Wagner (<a href=\"#bib5\">Battiste and Wagner, 2000</a>), these values were converted into the distances shown in <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>. Both Y656 and Y657 were found to be\u00a0~19 \u00c5 away from the MTSL-labeled C707, which is in better agreement with the A-loop conformation in the FGFR1K structure (3KY2) than the A-loop conformation in FGFR2K (2PSQ). While this distance is slightly longer than that measured in the FGFR1K crystal structure, it is within the typical range of experimental uncertainty (\u00b14 \u00c5) (<a href=\"#bib5\">Battiste and Wagner, 2000</a>) stemming from the packing of MTSL against the protein. Hence, as with the chemical shift data, our PRE results also imply that the A-loop conformation in the unphosphorylated FGFR2K structure (2PSQ) is not a genuinely inhibited conformation, and that in solution the A-loop of FGFR2K most likely adopts a similar conformation as that displayed by the A-loops of unphosphorylated FGFR1K (3KY2) and FGFR4K (4QQT) in the crystal."

A clue into the hotspots of this allosteric path was provided by the analysis of five gain-of-function mutations from the FGFR2K isoform that map to the a\u03b1C helix (M537I), \u03b1C\u2013\u03b24 loop in the close vicinity of molecular brake (I547V), \u03b1E helix (L617M/F), and A-loop (D650V) (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). The M537I and L617M mutations confer resistance to the anticancer drug ponatinib (<a href=\"#bib8\">Byron et al., 2013</a>), and M537I also corresponds to the M528I mutation in FGFR3 that was recently identified in patients with proportionate short stature (<a href=\"#bib38\">Kant et al., 2015</a>). I547V is a somatic mutation detected in endometrial carcinoma patients\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib58\">Pollock et al., 2007</a>) and corresponds to the gain-of-function I538V mutation in FGFR3, which is responsible for hypochondrolasia syndrome (<a href=\"#bib29\">Grigelionien\u00e9 et al., 1998</a>). The L617F mutation is a naturally occurring gain-of-function mutation found in patients with Crouzon craniosynostosis syndrome (<a href=\"#bib26\">Goos et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Suh et al., 2014</a>). Lastly, the D650V mutation, which is not an authentic pathogenic FGFR mutation, corresponds to D816V, D842V and D835V mutations of KIT, PDGFR and FLT3, respectively, that frequently occurs in human Systemic mastocytosis (<a href=\"#bib44\">Lim et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Garcia-Montero et al., 2006</a>), gasterointestinal stromal (GIST) tumors (<a href=\"#bib15\">Corless et al., 2005</a>), and acute myeloid leukemia (<a href=\"#bib70\">Yamamoto et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Abu-Duhier et al., 2001</a>). Notably, KIT, PDGFR, and FLT3 all share the same network of hydrogen bonds at the molecular brake as FGFR2K, suggesting that these kinases are also subject to autoinhibition by this regulatory site (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chen et al., 2007</a>). Indeed, somatic mutations of the conserved asparagine from the molecular brake triad activate these RTKs in GIST tumors (<a href=\"#bib15\">Corless et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Dutt et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Kinoshita et al., 2007</a>)."

                                "text": "Analysis of the I547V and L617M/F mutations in the context of autoinhibited and activated FGFRK crystal structures revealed a previously unrecognized cluster of hydrophobic interactions centering on the phenylalanine from the RTK-invariant DFG motif (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,E and G</a>). This hydrophobic cluster, which we have termed the DFG latch, determines the conformation of the N-terminal part of the A-loop and hence the N-lobe rotation. Specifically, in the autoinhibited FGFR1K, FGFR3K, and FGFR4K structures, the conformations of the DFG and adjacent LAR residues are physically incompatible with downward rotation of the \u03b1C helix toward the C-lobe, a well-documented mandatory event in kinase activation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). The inhibited conformation of the DFGLAR motif is primarily dictated by the DFG latch where the phenylalanine is fixed in its observed inhibitory position through tight hydrophobic interactions with L617 from the \u03b1E helix, I553 from the \u03b1C-\u03b24 loop, and I541 from the \u03b1C helix of FGFR2K (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C,E and G</a>). In the phosphorylated activated FGFRK structures, however, an RTK-invariant salt bridge between the arginine within the DFGLAR motif and the phosphotyrosine in the A-loop is formed. This intraloop salt bridge facilitates backbone hydrogen bonding between this same arginine and the conserved I623 situated in the catalytic loop resulting in the formation of the short \u03b26-\u03b29 sheet (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). This structural change alters the conformation of the preceding DFG latch causing the \u03c7<sub>1</sub> side chain dihedral angle of F645 to rotate by 120\u00b0 which places the side chain of F645 in a new location that is now conducive with downward rotation of the N-lobe (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Notably, in the activated kinase, the hydrophobic DFG latch becomes less engaged relative to the autoinhibited kinase as indicated by longer distances between the phenylalanine and the other three constituents of the latch (I541, I547, L617) as well as a decrease in shape complementarity (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D,F and I</a>). According to this structural analysis, the L617M/F and I547V gain-of-function mutations act by weakening the DFG latch that encourages the movement of the N-lobe toward the C-lobe, which under physiological conditions would be accomplished by A-loop tyrosine phosphorylation. In addition, we postulate that the weakened hydrophobic contact between F645 of the DFG motif and I547, which is situated on the same \u03b1C-\u03b24 loop as N549, perturbs the hydrogen bonding network at the molecular brake resulting in its disengagement. It should be noted that the DFG conformation seen in the activated FGFRK structures is distinct from the so-called \u2018DFG-out\u2019 conformation induced by binding of type II ATP competitive inhibitors such as Ponatinib and Gleevec (<a href=\"#bib62\">Schindler et al., 2000</a>)."

In autoinhibited FGFRK structures, the conserved aspartic acid (D650 in FGFR2K) does not play any role in stabilizing the autoinhibited conformation of the A-loop (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A and B</a>). However, in activated kinase structures, it makes van der Waals contacts with two conserved methionines (M537 and M540 in FGFR2K) at the C-terminal end of the \u03b1C helix (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). These van der Waals/hydrophobic contacts cooperate with the aforementioned arginine-phosphotyrosine salt bridge to further promote the \u03b29-\u03b26 strand formation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>), thus encouraging movement of the phenylalanine from the DFG motif to facilitate N-lobe rotation. The structural changes at the \u03b1C tether and DFG latch results in breakage of hydrogen bonds at the A-loop plug, which frees up the substrate-binding site. Based on this structural analysis, D650V or M537I mutations in FGFR2K may accentuate the hydrophobic contacts between the A-loop and the a\u03b1C helix to facilitate N-lobe rotation and hence kinase activation. Thus, according to our four-site allosteric model, phosphorylation on the A-loop tyrosine triggers a series of concerted allosteric motions to couple all four sites thereby conferring catalytic competency on FGFRKs (see model in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). It should be stressed that the DFG-latch and \u03b1C tether terms are not synonymous to the canonical DFG motif and a\u03b1C helix terminology. Rather the DFG-latch and \u03b1C tether describe two previously unrecognized clusters of interacting residues that are involved in modulating kinase dynamics between the autoinhibited and activated forms of the enzyme. Neither of these clusters were previously known in the RTK field, which were discovered by studying the effects of naturally occurring gain-of-function mutations in FGFRKs."

For each mutant, a plot of the chemical shift perturbations as a function of residue is displayed in <a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1</a> with representative spectra shown in <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a> for residues near or within the molecular brake (A567), catalytic loop (I623), DFG latch (G646), and \u03b1C tether (G542). Mutation at the DFG latch (I547V) caused chemical shift perturbations for residues within the molecular brake, \u03b1C tether, and catalytic loop (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>). Likewise, mutations affecting the \u03b1C tether (M537I, D650V) gave small but significant chemical shift changes to G646 of the DFG motif and I623 from the catalytic loop. Notably, the D650V mutation induced a perturbation at A567, which is in the vicinity of the molecular brake, whereas the M537I mutation did not significantly perturb this residue. Finally, mutations at the molecular brake (N549T, E565A, K641R) induced significant chemical shift changes to residues at or proximal to the molecular brake, DFG latch, \u03b1C tether, and catalytic loop (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>; <a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

                                "text": "To augment the backbone chemical shift data, we next acquired <sup>1</sup>H/<sup>13</sup>C HMQC data on samples of WT FGFR2K, K659E (A-loop mutant), and E565A (molecular brake mutant) that\u00a0were\u00a0selectively <sup>13</sup>C labeled at Ile, Val, and Leu methyl groups. The corresponding methyl group chemical shift perturbation data of E565A and K659E relative to WT are mapped onto the unphosphorylated FGFR1K crystal structure (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>; PDB ID: 3KY2). The E565A mutant incurred major chemical shift changes at residues both proximal to the molecular brake (I548, L551, V564) and distal from the molecular brake at the DFG motif (I541, I547) and A-loop (L647, I651). These data demonstrate that disruption of the hydrogen bonding network of the molecular brake influences the conformation of the A-loop via long-range allostery. Surprisingly, however, the K659E mutant did not exhibit significant backbone or methyl chemical shift perturbations at the molecular brake region (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>). Therefore, to supplement the <sup>1</sup>H/<sup>15</sup>N TROSY-HSQC and <sup>1</sup>H/<sup>13</sup>C HMQC chemical shift perturbation data on the K659E mutant, amide <sup>15</sup>N and methyl <sup>13</sup>C (Ile, Leu, and Val) CPMG relaxation dispersion measurements were carried out (<a href=\"#bib45\">Loria et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Korzhnev et al., 2004a</a>). Note that the CPMG technique is a more sensitive method than chemical shift perturbation analyses to detect sparsely populated conformational states and is routinely used to explore protein dynamics on the \u00b5sec-msec timescale (<a href=\"#bib50\">Mittermaier and Kay, 2009</a>). Indeed, several residues in the K659E mutant showed significant relaxation dispersions (i.e. \u0394R<sub>2,eff</sub>\u00a0&gt;2 s<sup>\u22121</sup>) both at the backbone amide and side chain methyl groups (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10C\u2013F</a>). These residues map to the DFG latch (I541, I547, F645), A-loop (L647), catalytic loop (I623, L627), molecular brake (I548, V699), \u03b1C tether (M538), and P+1 pocket (I707, V709). To determine the rate of conformational exchange, methyl group CPMG dispersion curves at two magnetic fields corresponding to I548, I623, L627, L647, I707, and V709 were fit in a global fashion using the two-site exchange equation (<a href=\"#bib46\">Luz and Meiboom, 1963</a>). Based on this analysis, an exchange rate (k<sub>ex</sub>) of 2000\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0500 s<sup>\u22121</sup> was estimated (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10F</a>) indicating that this pathogenic mutant interconverts between the autoinhibited/active states on a \u00b5sec-msec timescale (i.e. fast-intermediate exchange). By contrast, CPMG relaxation dispersion measurements on unphosphorylated WT FGFR2K showed very few residues exhibiting relaxation dispersions (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10A and B</a>). Based on these observations, we conclude that the unphosphorylated form of FGFR2K is conformationally rigid (i.e. only a small fraction of kinase molecules are in the active state conformation). These NMR data are congruent with the X-ray crystal structures showing that the kinase domain of FGFR is subject to a three-level autoinhibition mechanism via the molecular brake, the DFG latch and the blockade of the active site by the A-loop/catalytic loop salt bridge (A-loop plug)."

Comparison of these spectra with those of unphosphorylated (inhibited) WT FGFR2K showed a substantial reduction in peak intensities for the DFG motif and catalytic loop in the monophosphorylated activated FGFR2K. These observations reiterate that the DFG motif in the autoinhibited kinase is conformationally rigid (i.e. DFG latch on), whereas in the active form it becomes mobile with conformational fluctuations occurring on the \u00b5sec-msec timescale. Notably, CPMG relaxation dispersions experiments performed on K659E also showed significant relaxation dispersions for F645 and the surrounding methyl groups of I541 and I547. These data further support that kinase activation by A-loop phosphorylation or by pathogenic mutations enhances conformational dynamics of the enzyme and leads to a weakening of the DFG latch consistent with our structural analysis. Thus, the observed conformation of F645 side chain seen in the static X-ray structures of activated FGFR kinases represents the thermodynamically most stable orientation of the highly mobile phenyl ring in the active state. Our data are consistent with the previously published NMR data for other activated protein kinases including protein kinase A (<a href=\"#bib48\">Masterson et al., 2008</a>) and p38 MAP kinase (<a href=\"#bib66\">Vogtherr et al., 2006</a>), which also showed broadening around the DFG motif. Hence, it appears that enhanced conformational dynamics on the \u00b5sec-msec timescale for the DFG motif upon activation might be a general feature of all protein kinases."

                                "text": "To gain further insight into the trajectory of the long-range allosteric network, we applied chemical shift covariance analysis (CHESCA) (<a href=\"#bib63\">Selvaratnam et al., 2011</a>) to the backbone chemical shift data of unphosphorylated and A-loop phosphorylated wild-type and unphosphorylated mutated FGFR2Ks carrying a pathogenic mutation at lysine 659 (K659T, K659Q, K659N, K659M, K659E). Specifically, inter-residue pairwise correlations (|r<sub>ij</sub>|\u00a0&gt;\u00a00.97) were clustered using the complete linkage clustering approach as described previously (<a href=\"#bib63\">Selvaratnam et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Boulton et al., 2014</a>). Three individual clusters of residues (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C,D</a>) were found to each match closely with the relative kinase activities of the K659 mutants (<a href=\"#fig9s2\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). In addition, the single value decomposition method was used to show that each of these residues within the individual clusters aligned along the same principle component axis (<a href=\"#fig9s2\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), which further confirmed the existence of a common allosteric network (<a href=\"#bib63\">Selvaratnam et al., 2011</a>). In total, 18 residues were found to comprise the same allosteric network shown in <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C and D</a>. Mapping these sites onto the autoinhibited FGFR1K structure (PDB ID: 3KY2) illuminated a network of allosterically coupled residues belonging to the catalytic loop (D626 to N631), region surrounding the molecular brake (T635), \u03b1F helix (F689), Gly-rich loop (G488, F492), and A-loop (A643). The identification of A643, which is located immediately before D644 of the DFG motif, is harmonious with the crystallographically\u00a0deduced role of the DFG latch as a conduit in the allostery transmission from the A-loop to the molecular brake. Likewise the identification of D626 and other catalytic loop residues by CHESCA strongly supports a major conformational change of the A-loop between the inhibited and activated structures, which is induced by A-loop tyrosine phosphorylation and mimicked by pathogenic mutations. As mentioned earlier, in the autoinhibited FGFRK structures (e.g., FGFR1K, PDB ID: 3KY2), D623 in FGFR1K corresponding to D626 in FGFR2K engages in a salt bridge with R661 from the A-loop thereby blocking the substrate-binding site (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Upon activation this arginine residue disengages from the aspartate and makes a cation-\u03a0 interaction with the incoming substrate tyrosine (<a href=\"#bib30\">Huang et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Chen et al., 2008</a>). Taken together, the chemical shift perturbation data and CHESCA analysis support the existence of an allosteric connectivity between the molecular brake and A-loop that is mediated through the DFG latch and \u03b1C tether. Importantly, the regions of the kinase identified using CHESCA match to those identified by CPMG experiments, although the latter method detected additional residues involved in the conversion between the activated and autoinhibited conformations not picked up by CHESCA."

Notably the amino group of the ATP adenine ring makes a direct hydrogen bond with the backbone carbonyl oxygen of an FGFR-invariant glutamic acid whose side chain is a central mediator of the hydrogen bonding network at the molecular brake. Moreover, the conserved aspartic acid from the tyrosine kinase-invariant DFG motif participates in ATP binding by coordinating a Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion in concert with the \u03b1 and \u03b2 phosphate groups of ATP. Based on these structural observations, ATP binding may potentially promote the active state conformation of FGFRK by impinging on the molecular brake and DFG latch regions, which form part of the allosteric communication network we propose in our study. However, a direct comparison of the crystal structures of inhibited and activated kinases in complex with AMP-PCP (<a href=\"#bib51\">Mohammadi et al., 1996b</a>), a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog, clearly shows that ATP binding alone is ineffective in altering the hydrogen bonding network of the molecular brake or switching the phenylalanine position in the DFG latch. In other words, despite binding the ATP analog, unphosphorylated FGFRK remains in the inhibited conformation. Notably, in contrast to the fully ordered ATP analog in the crystal structure of the phosphorylated kinase-ATP complex, only the adenosine portion of the ATP analog is ordered in the crystal structure of unphosphorylated kinase (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). This is due to the fact that the DFG conformation for the unphosphorylated kinase is not permissive for Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion coordination by the conserved aspartic acid resulting in a disordered state of the phosphate moieties within the ATP analog. It is also noteworthy that the adenosine of the bound analog exhibits a high-temperature factor further suggesting a less tightly bound conformation by the unphosphorylated kinase. Therefore, compared to pathogenic mutations that directly target the four regions of the allosteric network, ATP is a poor extrinsic effector of conformational equilibrium between the active and inhibited states."

Specifically, we compared the <sup>1</sup>H/<sup>13</sup>C Ile/Val/Leu methyl and <sup>1</sup>H/<sup>15</sup>N amide chemical shift changes upon addition of a saturating amount of AMP-PCP:Mg<sup>2+</sup> mix. The rationale behind comparing chemical shifts is essentially the same as that described above for probing the effect of A-loop phosphorylation. Namely, if ATP binding facilitated a conformational switch of the autoinhibited kinase to the activated state, then we would detect significant chemical shift perturbations in C-lobe residues that tether the A-loop tyrosines to the C-lobe. As expected, addition of AMP-PCP induced large chemical shift changes for residues in the proximity of the ATP binding pocket including the \u2018gatekeeper\u2019 residue (V564) and glycine-rich loop residues (i.e. G488, G490). By contrast, most C-lobe residues including residues V691 and L712, that tether A-loop tyrosine to the C-lobe, were completely insensitive to the presence of AMP-PCP or experienced only minor perturbations (i.e. L675) implying that nucleotide binding does not significantly impact the A-loop conformation (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). As shown in <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>, phosphorylation at Y657 induced several major chemical shift changes in the kinase C-lobe. Hence, in agreement with X-ray data, the NMR results also demonstrate that AMP-PCP (mimic of ATP) binding to an autoinhibited enzyme cannot force the A-loop to the active conformation. Therefore, compared to pathogenic mutations that directly target the four regions of the allosteric network, ATP is a relatively poor extrinsic effector of conformational switching between the active and inhibited states. Furthermore, given that ATP concentration in the cytosol is relatively constant between 1\u00a0and\u00a010 mM, ATP is unlikely to serve as a physiological means in modulating intrinsic dynamics of the FGFRK."

Specifically, three out of the four sites of the allosteric network (molecular brake, DFG latch, A-loop plug) mediate strong hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic intramolecular contacts that repress the kinase from adopting an active conformation. Only the \u03b1C tether site provides van der Waals forces to encourage the active conformation. Thus, evolution of the FGFR kinase structure has favored a biased design to impose tight autoinhibition on the kinase that severely limits the ability of the enzyme to adopt the active state. Consequently, mutational derepression of only one of the three autoinhibitory sites (molecular brake, DFG latch or A-loop plug) or mutational strengthening of the \u03b1C tether alone does not completely convert the kinase to the active state, which implies that mutation in one site partially accesses the conformation of the remaining three sites. In other words, A-loop phosphorylation and the subsequent formation of an intra-loop pTyr-Arg salt bridge is the most effective way to fully couple the four sites to give rise to the largest fraction of activated kinase population. Notably, the differential abilities of pathogenic mutations to couple all four sites translate into differences in active state populations for these mutations which correlate with the gradations in gain-of-function and the associated clinical severity found in skeletal syndromes caused by the mutations (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chen et al., 2013</a>)."

To test this hypothesis, we engineered the following double mutants that combine mutations from two different sites namely: molecular brake and A-loop (E565A/K659M), molecular brake and DFG latch (E565A/I547V and E565A/L617M), molecular brake and \u03b1C tether (E565A/D650V, and E565A/M537I), and DFG latch and \u03b1C tether (I547V/M537I and L617M/D650V) (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). In order to assess whether strengthening the \u03b1C tether alone could overcome the repressive forces that are exerted by three autoinhibitory sites, an additional M537I/D650V double mutant was also prepared. Lastly, as a control, we constructed the N549H/E565A double mutant in\u00a0which two mutations target the same allosteric site (i.e. the molecular brake). The activities of the double mutants were directly compared against those of respective single mutants as well as the unphosphorylated and phosphorylated WT kinases using a mass spectrometry-based in vitro substrate phosphorylation assay. As shown in <a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12A</a>, the activities of all double mutants targeting different allosteric regions were higher than the individual mutants. In fact, the activity of the E565A/K659M double mutant nearly reached the maximal activity achieved by A-loop phosphorylated WT FGFR2K. The D650V/M537I mutant was more active than either of the D650V and M537I single mutants as well as their added activities, but was unable to reach the activity of the A-loop phosphorylated WT kinase. By contrast, double mutants targeting the same allosteric site (N549H/E565A) or two adjoining sites (I547V/E565A) gave only a subtle increase in activity beyond those of the single mutants. This lack of synergy between N549H and E565A mutations in elevating kinase activity is expected as either mutation alone is sufficient to disrupt the hydrogen bonding network at the molecular brake. These extensive kinase assay data show that double mutations among the four sites of the allosteric network can reinforce each other in increasing the enzymatic activity. The physiological evidence for synergism between gain-of-function mutations is provided by a recent discovery of a rare case of Thanatophoric Dysplasia (TD) caused by double missense FGFR3 mutations in cis (N540K and V555M) located in the molecular brake and near the DFG latch (<a href=\"#bib56\">Pannier et al., 2009</a>). While the N540K mutation accounts for 70% of Hypochondroplasia cases and results in a mild form of dwarfism, the combination of this mutation with V555M results in TD, a neonatal lethal skeletal syndrome, presumably due to greater gain-of-function of the double mutant relative to the single mutations alone."

In agreement with their elevated kinase activities, both double mutants crystallized in an activated conformation displaying an active A-loop conformation, a disengaged molecular brake, a weakened DFG latch and an engaged \u03b1C tether (<a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12B,C</a> and <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Taken together with our extensive structural and functional results on single mutants, these data on the double mutants further support a four-site long-range allosteric network that controls FGFRK conformational dynamics and activity. Although the four-site design of the allosteric network introduces additional entry points for pathogenic mutations, we surmise it might be more advantageous over a single switch mechanism from a pathophysiological perspective. Specifically, pathogenic mutations in a one-switch mechanism involving idealized cooperativity would fully activate the kinase thus leading to more dire consequences than in the multi-site mechanism where a single mutation can only achieve partial kinase activation. Since the probability of acquired mutations simultaneously occurring\u00a0at two sites in a cis fashion is extremely low, we propose that this multi-site mechanism has evolved as a defense mechanism to diminish the detrimental effects of opportunistic mutations."

The chemical shifts from a series of mutations at K659 (T, N, Q, M, E) and wild-type phosphorylated and unphosphorylated FGFR2K were used as input.\u00a0Residues\u00a0with chemical shift differences between phosphorylated and unphosphorylated FGFR2K less than 10 Hz in <sup>1</sup>H and 5 Hz in <sup>15</sup>N were excluded from the analysis. The combined chemical shift (CCS) was calculated by summing the <sup>15</sup>N and <sup>1</sup>H chemical shifts with a 0.2 scaling factor for <sup>15</sup>N (CCS\u00a0=\u00a00.2\u03b4<sub>N</sub> + \u03b4<sub>H</sub>). The clustering was carried out with the software package Cluster 3.0 (<a href=\"http://bonsai.hgc.jp/~mdehoon/software/cluster\">http://bonsai.hgc.jp/~mdehoon/software/cluster</a>) (<a href=\"#bib16\">de Hoon et al., 2004</a>). Dendrograms were prepared using Java TreeView (<a href=\"http://jtreeview.sourceforge.net\">http://jtreeview.sourceforge.net</a>) (<a href=\"#bib61\">Saldanha, 2004</a>). Residue clusters were selected that had correlation coefficients |r<sub>ij</sub>|\u00a0&gt;\u00a00.97. In order to determine whether these residues belonged to the same functional network, a chemical shift sub-matrix was constructed only of residues within the identified clusters. The resulting state-based dendrograms are shown in <a href=\"#fig9s2\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 2</a> and reveal that the three displayed clusters in <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9D</a> belong to the same functional network based on kinase activity assays carried out previously (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chen et al., 2013</a>)."

Of particular interest is the finding that in the active conformation many regions of a FGFR kinase, including the DFG motif, is more flexible than in the inactive conformation."

The only one discussed in the manuscript (PDB: 2PSQ) was thought to be complicated by crystal lattice packing by authors. Although the functional data and NMR data implies that FGFR2K, like FGFR1K, is autoinhibited in the unphosphorylated state, no direct evidence indicates that, as this study assumes, the autoinhibited structure of FGFR2K is necessarily highly similar to the other FGFR kinases. This is a potentially important weakness of this study, especially because allosteric communication can be sensitive to subtle structural differences and vary significantly among homologue proteins. In the revision the authors need to address this issue with new data or with additional discussions."

This would disrupt the interface interactions, including those involving residues distal to the mutation site, but it would be inappropriate to describe the binding interface as an allosteric network and the mutated residues as switches, despite the distal affects. The reviewers think, for similar reasons, the two terms may not be appropriate to describe this work, which identifies key structural determinants involved in FGFR autoinhibition and activation. It appears that the mutational data (including those that have pathogenic effects and those that are rationally introduced by authors) can also be explained just by the structure features captured in crystal structures, without invoking the concept of a \"four switch allosteric network\".

The only one discussed in the manuscript (PDB: 2PSQ) was thought to be complicated by crystal lattice packing by authors. Although the functional data and NMR data implies that FGFR2K, like FGFR1K, is autoinhibited in the unphosphorylated state, no direct evidence indicates that, as this study assumes, the autoinhibited structure of FGFR2K is necessarily highly similar to the other FGFR kinases. This is a potentially important weakness of this study, especially because allosteric communication can be sensitive to subtle structural differences and vary significantly among homologue proteins.

However, despite numerous attempts, we failed to crystallize the unphosphorylated FGFR2K in a different space group. We would like to mention that other groups have faced the same problem<sup>1</sup>. Evidently, strong lattice contact forces prevail and conceal a truly autoinhibited conformation of the A-loop in FGFR2K. To overcome this problem, we decided to carry out additional NMR experiments to assess the conformation of the A-loop of FGFR2K in solution (free of lattice contacts). As discussed in the manuscript (Results and Discussion), the conformations of A-loop in both the crystal structures of unphosphorylated FGFR1K (3KY2) and FGFR4K (4QQT) are essentially identical and both show the A-loop tyrosines to pack tightly against the C-lobe. In stark contrast, in the FGFR2K structure (2PSQ) the N-terminal half of A-loop adopts an active-like conformation while the C-terminal half of A-loop adopts an alternative conformation (neither inhibited nor active). Importantly, in 2PSQ, the A-loop tyrosine residues face away from the C-lobe and are completely solvent exposed. Based on these crystallographic data, we devised two NMR experiments to obtain proximity information between the A-loop tyrosines and the C-lobe in the unphosphorylated FGFR2K in solution that would help resolve ambiguity regarding the A-loop conformation:"

We reasoned that if the A-loop tyrosines in the unphosphorylated FGFR2K were interacting with the C-lobe as observed in the unphosphorylated FGFR1K and FGFR4K structures, then we would detect chemical shift differences upon A-loop phosphorylation for the A-loop tyrosines and for the C-lobe residues that pack against the A-loop tyrosines. As shown in <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>, we plotted the chemical shift perturbations onto FGFR1K and FGFR2K structures and found substantial perturbations that clustered in a region directly surrounding the location of the A-loop tyrosines in the FGFR1K structure (i.e., catalytic loop, \u03b1EF, \u03b1F, \u03b1G helices). These NMR results cannot be reconciled with the observed conformation of the A-loop in the FGFR2K structure (2PSQ) as the A-loop tyrosines in this structure do not interact with these perturbed residues in the C-lobe. This NMR analysis supports the notion that the unphosphorylated FGFR2K structure (2PSQ) represents a partially activated conformation due to crystal packing."

PRE effects are strong up to a distance of ~20 \u00c5 but diminish at distances greater than ~25 \u00c5. PRE experiments require a free cysteine for covalently linking a paramagnetic spin label onto the protein. To this end we selected I707 of FGFR2K for introducing a free cysteine since this isoleucine is positioned ideally to dissect the A-loop conformational difference between unphosphorylated FGFR2K (2PSQ) and FGFR1K/FGFR4K (3KY2/4QQT) structures (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). In the unphosphorylated FGFR2K structure (2PSQ), the C\u03b3 of I707 and the nitrogen atom of Y656 are ~27 \u00c5 apart, whereas the corresponding distance between V704 in Y653 in FGFR1K (3KY2) is much shorter (~15 \u00c5). To carry out these experiments with good confidence and resolution, the I707C FGFR2K mutant was selectively labeled with <sup>15</sup>N tyrosine prior to covalently attaching an MTSL label. <sup>1</sup>H/<sup>15</sup>N HSQC experiments on the mutant sample in the absence and presence of reducing agent showed notable reductions in peak intensities for the two A-loop tyrosines in the oxidized samples that are consistent with a distance less than 20 \u00c5 (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). We estimated the distance from the intensity retention using the approach of Battiste and Wagner and calculated a value of ~19 \u00c5. While this is slightly longer than the distance measured in the FGFR1K crystal structure (3KY2), it is within the acceptable range of experimental uncertainty stemming from the packing of MTSL against the protein (i.e., possible side-chain rotamers). Hence, as with the chemical shift data, our PRE results also imply that the A-loop conformation in the unphosphorylated FGFR2K structure (2PSQ) is not a genuinely inhibited conformation, and that in solution the A-loop of FGFR2K likely adopts a similar conformation as that displayed by the A-loops of unphosphorylated FGFR1K (3KY2) and FGFR4K (4QQT) in the crystal."

                    "text": "As noted by the reviewer, binding of ATP into the cleft between the N- and C-lobes of the kinase involves residues from the molecular brake and the conserved DFG motif. Notably the amino group of the ATP adenine ring makes a direct hydrogen bond with the backbone carbonyl oxygen of an FGFR-invariant glutamic acid whose side chain is a central mediator of the hydrogen bonding network at the molecular brake. Moreover, the conserved aspartic acid from the tyrosine kinase-invariant DFG motif participates in ATP binding by coordinating a Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion in concert with the \u03b1 and \u03b2 phosphate groups of ATP. Based on these structural observations, we concur with the reviewer that ATP binding may potentially promote the active state conformation of FGFR kinase by impinging on the molecular brake and DFG latch regions which form part of the allosteric communication network we propose in our study. However, a direct comparison of the crystal structures of inhibited and activated kinases in complex with AMP-PCP, a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog, clearly shows that ATP binding alone is ineffective in altering the hydrogen bonding network of the molecular brake or switching the phenylalanine position in the DFG latch<sup><a href=\"#bib43\">2</a></sup>. In other words, despite binding to the ATP analog, the unphosphorylated FGFR kinase remains in the inhibited conformation. Notably, in contrast to the fully ordered ATP analog in the crystal structure of the phosphorylated kinase-ATP complex, only the adenosine portion of the ATP analog is ordered in the crystal structure of unphosphorylated kinase (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). This is due to the fact that the DFG conformation for the unphosphorylated kinase is not permissive for Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion coordination by the conserved aspartic acid resulting in a disordered state of the phosphate moieties within the ATP analog. It is also noteworthy that the adenosine ring of the bound analog exhibits a high temperature factor further suggesting a less tightly bound conformation by the unphosphorylated kinase."

Specifically, we compared the <sup>1</sup>H/<sup>13</sup>C Ile/Val/Leu methyl and <sup>1</sup>H/<sup>15</sup>N amide chemical shift changes upon addition of a saturating amount of AMP-PCP:Mg<sup>2+</sup> mix. The rationale behind comparing chemical shifts is essentially the same as that described above for probing the effect of A-loop phosphorylation. Namely, if ATP binding facilitated a conformational switch of the autoinhibited kinase to the activated state, then we would detect significant chemical shift perturbations in C-lobe residues that tether the A-loop tyrosines to the C-lobe. As expected, addition of AMP-PCP induced large chemical shift changes for residues in the proximity of the ATP binding pocket including the \u201cgatekeeper\u201d residue (V564) and glycine-rich loop residues (i.e., G488, G490). By contrast, most C-lobe residues including residues V691 and L712, that tether A-loop tyrosine to the C-lobe, were completely insensitive to the presence of AMP-PCP or experienced only minor perturbations (i.e., L675) implying that nucleotide binding does not significantly impact the A-loop conformation (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). As shown in <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>, phosphorylation at Y657 induced several major chemical shift changes in the kinase C-lobe. Hence, in agreement with X-ray data, the NMR results also demonstrate that AMP-PCP (mimic of ATP) binding to an autoinhibited enzyme cannot force the A-loop to the active conformation. Therefore, compared to pathogenic mutations that directly target the four regions of the allosteric network, ATP is a relatively poor extrinsic effector of conformational switching between the active and inhibited states. Furthermore, given that ATP concentration in the cytosol is relatively constant between 1-10 mM, ATP is unlikely to serve as a physiological means in modulating intrinsic dynamics of the FGFR kinase."

Analyzing quantitative differences among isoforms would have to factor in additional sequence differences that might favor one amino acid substitution over the other. This is a challenging endeavor which we plan to address in future studies focused on delineating subtle differences in the composition of the allosteric network that give rise to subtle differential activities of the four FGFR isoforms.
