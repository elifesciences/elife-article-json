Complementary auxotrophs of <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> amino acid and nucleotide metabolism regularly fail to compensate for each other's deficiencies, implying the absence of growth-relevant  metabolite exchange capacities. Contrastingly, we find that cells within colonies maintain a rich exometabolome and prefer uptake of extracellular metabolites over self-synthesis, indicators of ongoing metabolite exchange. We conceived a system that begins with a self-supporting cell which grows autonomously into a heterogeneous community, only able to survive by exchanging histidine, leucine, uracil and methionine. Compensating for the progressive loss of prototrophy, resultant communities obtained an auxotrophic composition in a nutrition dependent manner, and achieved wild-type like exometabolome, growth parameters and cell viability. Yeast as a eukaryotic model thus possesses extensive capacity for growth-relevant metabolite exchange, and readily cooperates in metabolism within progressively establishing communities."
