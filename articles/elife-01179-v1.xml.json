Stop codon readthrough is essential to diverse viruses, and phylogenetically predicted to occur in a few hundred genes in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, but the importance of regulated readthrough in eukaryotes remains largely unexplored. Here, we present a ribosome profiling assay (deep sequencing of ribosome-protected mRNA fragments) for <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, and provide the first genome-wide experimental analysis of readthrough. Readthrough is far more pervasive than expected: the vast majority of readthrough events evolved within <i>D. melanogaster</i> and were not predicted phylogenetically. The resulting C-terminal protein extensions show evidence of selection, contain functional subcellular localization signals, and their readthrough is regulated, arguing for their importance. We further demonstrate that readthrough occurs in yeast and humans. Readthrough thus provides general mechanisms both to regulate gene expression and function, and to add plasticity to the proteome during evolution."

Stop codon readthrough is essential to diverse viruses, and phylogenetically predicted to occur in a few hundred genes in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, but the importance of regulated readthrough in eukaryotes remains largely unexplored. Here, we present a ribosome profiling assay (deep sequencing of ribosome-protected mRNA fragments) for <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, and provide the first genome-wide experimental analysis of readthrough. Readthrough is far more pervasive than expected: the vast majority of readthrough events evolved within <i>D. melanogaster</i> and were not predicted phylogenetically. The resulting C-terminal protein extensions show evidence of selection, contain functional subcellular localization signals, and their readthrough is regulated, arguing for their importance. We further demonstrate that readthrough occurs in yeast and humans. Readthrough thus provides general mechanisms both to regulate gene expression and function, and to add plasticity to the proteome during evolution."

                        "text": "Upon encountering a stop codon, ribosomes can terminate translation with remarkable fidelity, yet they do not always do so. Stop codon readthrough, the decoding of a stop codon as a sense codon by the ribosome, plays important regulatory roles. Most immediately, readthrough diversifies the proteome by creating a pool of C-terminally extended proteins. In this capacity, it is essential to a variety of plant and animal viruses (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cimino et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Li and Rice, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Napthine et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Skuzeski et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Yoshinaka et al., 1985</a>; reviewed in <a href=\"#bib1\">Beier and Grimm, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Firth and Brierley, 2012</a>). In eukaryotic host genes, readthrough is functionally important insofar as it may suppress pathological phenotypes caused by premature stop codons (<a href=\"#bib40\">Kopczynski et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Fearon et al., 1994</a>), antagonize nonsense-mediated decay (<a href=\"#bib38\">Keeling et al., 2004</a>), and, by changing the C-terminal sequence of a given protein, modulate its activity (<a href=\"#bib73\">Torabi and Kruglyak, 2012</a>), stability (<a href=\"#bib57\">Namy et al., 2002</a>), and/or localization (<a href=\"#bib18\">Freitag et al., 2012</a>). In yeast, the efficiency of translation termination is modulated by [<i>PSI</i><sup>+</sup>], an epigenetic state resulting from prion-like aggregates of Sup35p, the yeast homologue of the translation termination factor eRF3 (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib75\">Tuite and Cox, 2007</a>). Various yeast strains exhibit [<i>PSI</i><sup>+</sup>]-dependent fitness advantages, implying that increased readthrough activates useful genetic diversity that is ordinarily masked by stop codons (<a href=\"#bib74\">True and Lindquist, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Halfmann et al., 2012</a>). In addition, a small baseline level of readthrough appears to be beneficial in wild [<i>psi<sup>\u2212</sup></i>] yeast strains, as alleles of various factors controlling termination efficiency are under balancing selection (<a href=\"#bib72\">Torabi and Kruglyak, 2011</a>)."

                        "text": "However, a broad understanding of the biological roles of readthrough in eukaryotes remains elusive due to a lack of experimental data. To date, only a handful of eukaryotic host genes have been experimentally demonstrated to undergo readthrough in wild-type or prion-free organisms (<a href=\"#bib21\">Geller and Rich, 1980</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Xue and Cooley, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Klagges et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Steneberg et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Namy et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Jungreis et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Freitag et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Torabi and Kruglyak, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Yamaguchi et al., 2012</a>). Compelling evidence that readthrough is broadly important in eukaryotes came with the development of algorithms (CSF and PhyloCSF) that use orthologous nucleotide sequences from related organisms to identify protein-coding regions of a reference genome based upon signatures of amino acid conservation (<a href=\"#bib48\">Lin et al., 2007</a>, <a href=\"#bib49\">2011</a>). Using this approach, 283 readthrough events were predicted in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, six of which they confirmed experimentally (<a href=\"#bib48\">Lin et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Jungreis et al., 2011</a>). While these algorithms provide a powerful means to identify ancient and phylogenetically conserved readthrough events, they are limited in their ability to detect evolutionarily recent events. Nor can bioinformatic approaches identify a priori the tissues or cell types in which readthrough occurs, measure the fraction of ribosomes that read through a given stop codon, or determine whether any of these processes are regulated: such questions demand experimental approaches."

Application of the <i>Drosophila</i> ribosome profiling strategy allows annotation of the <i>Drosophila</i> proteome using empirical data. By examining the physical locations of ribosomes along mRNAs, we discover that readthrough is far more pervasive than expected: we identify more than 300 readthrough events not predicted by phylogenetic approaches. We provide evidence that these novel extensions are of recent evolutionary origin, and show using specific examples that both the novel and conserved extensions can produce stable protein products, be produced in a regulated manner, and contain functional subcellular localization signals. We further demonstrate that readthrough occurs at many loci in [<i>psi<sup>\u2212</sup></i>] yeast and in primary human foreskin fibroblasts, arguing that readthrough is both a ubiquitous feature of eukaryotic translation and a novel mechanism to regulate gene expression. Stop codon readthrough thus adds plasticity to the proteome during development, and provides an evolutionary mechanism for extant genes to acquire new functions."

Aliquots of this lysate were digested with increasing amounts of RNase I, and resolved on 10\u201350% sucrose gradients. As amounts of RNase I increase, the heights of all peaks\u2014including the monosomal (80S) peak\u2014decrease before polysomes are fully resolved to monosomes. (<b>B</b>) as in (<b>A</b>), but using micrococcal nuclease (MNase) and our current protocol. From 0.5 to 2 U MNase/\u03bcg total RNA, monosomes are resolved with no reduction in the size of the monosome peak. This result indicates that <i>Drosophila</i> ribosomes are stable to MNase over a broad range of concentrations, whereas the mRNA between ribosomes is digested. (<b>C</b>) Ribosome protection assay. A 320 nucleotide fragment of enolase (FlyBase accession: FBgn0000579) was amplified using oligos oJGD123 &amp; oJGD124 (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>). A body-labeled probe against this sequence was transcribed from this template using \u03b132P-UTP and the T7 MaxiScript kit (Ambion). S2 cell lysates were prepared as in methods and aliquoted. Aliquots were digested as in methods, except with 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3 or 4 U MNase/\u03bcg total RNA. Monosomes were sedimented through a sucrose cushion, resuspended in 600 \u03bcl 10 mM Tris pH 7.0, and their RNAs extracted as in \u2018Materials and methods\u2019. Concentrations were determined using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer. 5 \u03bcg of each sample was hybridized to 50,000 CPM of probe overnight at 42\u00b0C. Single-stranded regions were digested with RNase A/T1 and the remaining footprint: probe duplexes detected using the mirVana micro-RNA detection kit (Ambion), resolved on a 15% TBE-urea gel (Invitrogen), and visualized on a Storm phosphorimager (Molecular Dynamics by GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences, Pittsburgh, PA). For size markers, we end-labeled the Novex 10 bp dsDNA ladder (Invitrogen) with 32P. Over two-fold range of nuclease concentrations, the \u223c30 nt peak corresponding to ribosome-protected footprints remains constant in size and intensity, indicating a lack of degradation consistent with the unchanged monosome peak height across this range of digestion conditions in (<b>B</b>). Also visible is a roughly 60 nt band which we infer to be protected by adjacent ribosomes (disomes) that sterically exclude the nuclease. This interpretation is consistent with the presence of a small disome peak in digested samples (c.f. panels <b>B</b> and <b>D</b>, and <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>).

For each ROI meeting these criteria (2800\u20133200 ROI per sample), we generated a \u2018coverage vector\u2019 tallying ribosome density at each nucleotide position. We then normalized each coverage vector to the mean number of footprint reads covering the annotated coding region in the ROI, excluding a 3-codon buffer flanking the start or stop codon to avoid bleedthrough from initiation or termination peaks. We then plotted the median value across all normalized coverage vectors at each position. Peaks are visible in the start and stop codons of embryo samples. Consistent with our previous work, stop codon peaks are missing from S2 cell samples because terminating ribosomes release during our 2-min treatment with translation inhibitors. They are present in our embryo samples, because these are flash-frozen and lysed in the presence of translation inhibitors, which block termination as well as initiation and elongation."

Second, our measurements of 5\u2032 UTR density are indistinguishable whether we enrich digested monosomes by sedimentation through a sucrose cushion (which collects all heavy particles) or specifically separate them from preinitiation complexes by fractionation of a sucrose gradient (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Thus, the dominant signal contributing to our measurement of footprint density in 5\u2032 UTRs is derived from fragments protected by 80S ribosomes. Third, because initiation and termination of translation are slow compared to elongation, initiation and termination events produce peaks of ribosome density (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Ingolia et al., 2011</a>). Such peaks are frequently visible at the boundaries of predicted uORF sequences (example in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>), again arguing that reads aligning to 5\u2032 UTRs represent translation events. Given the known roles of uORFs in regulating both the translation and the stability of mRNAs (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib53\">Meijer and Thomas, 2002</a>) we anticipate that our methods will facilitate future analyses of the contributions of uORFs to control of gene expression throughout fly development."

However, a subset of transcripts exhibit high footprint density within the predicted extensions. To determine whether the footprint density was consistent with stop codon readthrough (as opposed to alternate explanations, like frameshift), we manually scored each predicted extension whose corresponding structural gene was sufficiently expressed in our embryo sample (158 in total). An extension was scored positively if there existed ribosome density in the extension, ribosome density vanished or unambiguously decreased following the first in-frame stop codon, and positions occupied by ribosomes in the putative extension evenly covered the majority of the extension\u2019s length (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 for further details).

Therefore, libraries prepared with RNase I (e.g., yeast and mammalian libraries) offer superior spatial resolution along mRNAs. In such libraries, the locations of ribosome-protected footprint fragments in coding regions exhibit a characteristic three-nucleotide periodicity or <i>phasing</i> from which reading frames can be deduced (<a href=\"#bib30\">Ingolia et al., 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib31\">2011</a>). We therefore tabulated the phasing of ribosome-protected footprint fragments in all annotated coding regions, putative C-terminal extensions, and the 40 codon windows downstream of the putative extensions as an approximation of the portion of the 3\u2032 UTR distal to the putative extension (hereafter called \u2018distal 3\u2032 UTRs\u2019). To control for cloning biases caused by skewed nucleotide frequencies at each phase, we tabulated the phasing of randomly-fragmented mRNA fragments that were cloned using the same protocol and aligned to the same regions. Non-random phasing consistent with translation is apparent in both the coding regions and the putative extensions, but not the distal 3\u2032 UTR (p=3.98 \u00d7 10<sup>\u221226</sup>, \u03a7<sup>2</sup> test, footprints vs mRNA fragments in extension, dof = 2; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Importantly, the major component of phasing in the putative extensions occurs in the same reading frame as that of coding regions, indicating that readthrough (as opposed to, e.g., frameshift) is a major contributor to protected fragment density in 3\u2032 UTRs in yeast. Having found global evidence for readthrough, we manually scored a subset of yeast genes to identify individual examples of readthrough, using the same filtering and scoring criteria we used in the <i>Drosophila</i> datasets. We found 30 clear examples of readthrough in yeast (examples in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,C</a>; full results in supplementary table 3 at Dryad: <a href=\"#bib12\">Dunn et al., 2013</a>), demonstrating that readthrough is not unique to <i>Drosophila.</i>"

In the first scenario, readthrough rates for all transcripts should increase or decrease monotonically in one cell or tissue type compared to another. In the latter two scenarios, readthrough rates should increase for some transcripts, but decrease for others. We identified four significant increases and five significant decreases in readthrough rate in embryos compared to S2 cells, indicating that readthrough is at least in part regulated on a transcript-by-transcript basis. The distribution of fold-changes in readthrough rate spans several orders of magnitude, indicating that transcripts that are robustly read through in one cell type are not necessarily read through in another (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). This result implies that extensions function in specific cellular or developmental contexts, consistent with earlier reports that readthrough of specific genes is regulated in metazoans (<a href=\"#bib65\">Robinson and Cooley, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Yamaguchi et al., 2012</a>)."

Thus, a C-terminal extension produced by termination failure could purely by chance alter the function or behavior of its host protein, and thus come under selection. Indeed, <a href=\"#bib18\">Freitag et al. (2012)</a> reported two readthrough events in fungi that append peroxisomal localization signals (PTS1) to the C-termini of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and 3-phosphoglycerate kinase, enabling these typically cytosolic enzymes to function in peroxisomal metabolism. We therefore searched our full set of C-terminal extensions for short peptide signals that direct peroxisome localization, nuclear localization (NLS), prenylation, or ER retention, or that resemble transmembrane domains (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). PTS1 signals were detected in one extension. 10 proteins not annotated as nuclear in FlyBase contain predicted NLSes in their extensions. Eight extensions contain predicted transmembrane domains and one contains a C-terminal prenylation signal. No extension contained an ER retention signal (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>)."

When expressed in S2 cells, three of four NLSes relocalized the cytosolic reporter to the nucleus at levels above background (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>, columns 3\u20135), arguing that these extensions can regulate the localization of their endogenous host proteins. Given the large number of short peptide signals (e.g., phosphorylation motifs, degradation motifs, ubiquitination sequences, etc) that have been discovered, and the limited number of reporters we tested here, we likely underestimate the number of extensions that confer function.

Our studies indicate that readthrough is far more pervasive than previously appreciated, is biologically regulated, and may append functional peptide signals to host proteins.

In this model, transcripts that contain contexts favorable to leaky termination would yield substoichiometric, C-terminally extended populations of cellular proteins. If a particular extension is deleterious, natural selection can favor mutations in the corresponding mRNA that promote efficient termination rather than readthrough. If, instead, the extension provides a fitness advantage, selection can act upon both its amino acid sequence (to tune its function), as well as the nucleotide sequence of its mRNA (to increase or otherwise regulate its readthrough rate). In extreme cases, where an extension is universally advantageous, a mutation that changes a stop codon to a sense codon might become fixed, resulting in a constitutively extended gene. Conceivably, the two C-terminal extensions that we discovered to contain sense codons in place of their annotated stop codons could be the end result of this process."

This point is illustrated by the studies of Kaiser and Botstein, which demonstrated that a large proportion\u2014roughly 30%\u2014of randomly-generated peptide sequences are functional, insofar as they can relocalize a cytosolic form of invertase to the nucleus, mitochondrion, or endoplasmic reticulum in yeast (<a href=\"#bib36\">Kaiser et al., 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Kaiser and Botstein, 1990</a>). Given the large number of short peptide signals now known (e.g., D-boxes, KEN-boxes, SH3 binding epitopes, phosphorylation sites, etc), it is likely that a far greater fraction of random peptide sequences contain at least one functional signal. Consistent with this hypothesis, we discovered C-terminal extensions that are not phylogenetically conserved nonetheless contained functional NLSes in <i>Drosophila.</i> Furthermore, because these short signals are modular, their addition to the C-terminus of a protein can confer novel function, without requiring modification or coevolution of the host protein. In this way, even novel C-terminal extensions arising purely from termination failure can immediately alter the behavior of their host proteins, in beneficial or deleterious ways, and thus come under selection. Over evolutionary time, this process could yield phylogenetically conserved readthrough events or, in extreme cases, constitutively extended proteins."

Between these, one would find extensions under varying degrees of age, conservation, and selection. This notion is borne out in our data: in <i>Drosophila,</i> a subset of readthrough events are well supported by conservative codon substitutions across the phylogeny (<a href=\"#bib48\">Lin et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Jungreis et al., 2011</a>), but a far larger set is not conserved between species. In aggregate, this non-conserved group shows weak but statistically significant signals of selection among fifty wild-type individuals of <i>D. melanogaster</i> (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>), suggesting that a fraction of this group is undergoing protein coding selection.

While RNase I is an unbiased enzyme, MNase has a strong 3' A/T bias. As a result, MNase-digested footprints are longer than RNase-digested footprints, and not always fully resolved to the edges of ribosomes. This fact gives rise to a small amount of positional uncertainty with P-site mapping in MNase datasets. We handle this uncertainty in our P-site assignment strategy by assigning a fraction of the P-site over a neighborhood of adjacent nucleotides determined by the length and endpoints of each read alignment as detailed in the methods section of our manuscript and as previously performed in <a href=\"#bib60\">Oh et al., 2011</a>.

The <i>Drosophila</i> gene <i>kelch,</i> the first gene discovered to undergo readthrough in <i>Drosophila,</i> provides a good example. <i>kelch</i> is essential for female fertility, and has an extension notable for both its conservation (PhyloCSF score 7784, conserved throughout the sequenced <i>Drosophila</i> phylogeny) and length (787 amino acids). However, Robinson and colleagues found that expression of specifically the short form, but not of the long form, complemented the fertility defect observed in the null mutant (<a href=\"#bib65\">Robinson &amp; Cooley, 1997</a>). Nonetheless, given its conservation and length, it is hard to imagine that this extension is not functional. Robinson and colleagues therefore proposed that the long form of <i>kelch</i> may be more important in other tissues (e.g., the imaginal discs, where the long form is specifically up-regulated relative to the short form), but they did not create the conditional mutants necessary to test this hypothesis (<a href=\"#bib65\">Robinson &amp; Cooley, 1997</a>)."

Secondly, we assumed that protein-coding selection, if present, should yield similar signatures in the amino acid sequences of known coding regions and of putative C-terminal extensions (i.e., conservation, if present, should favor synonymous amino acid substitutions over non-synonymous changes, and the primary amino acid sequence should be important)."

Given that the novel extensions we report largely fall within this size range (median: 16 codons; 76% 10 codons or longer), we think that a signal of conservation, if present, should be detectable by PhyloCSF with comparable sensitivity (provided our second assumption, that extensions should be have similarly in their conservation properties to known coding regions, is also reasonable; further discussed below).

This expectation arises from the fact that the PhyloCSF score is actually a likelihood ratio, calculated as the log ratio of probabilities of observing a given set of triplet substitutions under a coding model of evolution versus a non-coding model of evolution. Therefore, positive scores indicate a higher probability of observing a given set of substitutions if the ancestral sequence were coding, while a negative score actually indicates a greater likelihood of observing those substitutions under a non-coding model. In other words, a negative score actually provides evidence in favor of a non-coding model rather than indicate the absence of evidence for a protein-coding model. Simultaneous absence of evidence of both models would a ratio of probabilities close to 1.0 and a log-ratio of 0. Instead, we find a median PhyloCSF score for the novel extensions to be -159.8 decibans, indicating that, on average, a non-coding model fits these extensions far better (10<sup>16</sup>-fold) than a coding model.

One explanation is the evolutionary trajectory we describe in our manuscript.
