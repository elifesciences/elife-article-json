Each of the 21 MB output neuron (MBON) types elaborates segregated dendritic arbors along the parallel axons of \u223c2000 Kenyon cells, forming 15 compartments that collectively tile the MB lobes. MBON axons project to five discrete neuropils outside of the MB and three MBON types form a feedforward network in the lobes. Each of the 20 dopaminergic neuron (DAN) types projects axons to one, or at most two, of the MBON compartments. Convergence of DAN axons on compartmentalized Kenyon cell\u2013MBON synapses creates a highly ordered unit that can support learning to impose valence on sensory representations. The elucidation of the complement of neurons of the MB provides a comprehensive anatomical substrate from which one can infer a functional logic of associative olfactory learning and memory."

For each driver line, the source of the enhancer fragments used to make the p65ADZp and ZpGAL4DBD constructs are given. Most enhancer fragments are from the collection of GAL4 lines described in <a href=\"#bib45\">Jenett et al. (2012)</a>; see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 for the details of the TH and TDC2 constructs. All ZpGAL4DBD constructs are inserted into <i>attP2</i>; the insertion sites of the p65ADZp constructs are indicated by the letter at the end of the driver name as follows: A, <i>su(Hw)attP8</i>; B, <i>attP40</i>; C, <i>VK00027</i>. The cell types in which expression is seen with each driver are indicated in the matrix; the level of expression in each cell type is indicated by the gray scale (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). Note that observed expression depends to some extent on the reporter construct used (see <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a> for an example). The data in this matrix were based on imaging with <i>pJFRC225-5xUAS-IVS-myr::smGFP-FLAG</i> in <i>VK00005</i>. The <i>VK00005</i> insertion site supports high-expression levels (Pfeiffer et al., 2012); many of the split-GAL4 drivers show more cell type specificity using reporters in <i>attP18</i> (see the accompanying paper for examples) (<a href=\"#bib4\">Aso et al., 2014</a>). We did not observe expression outside the central nervous system in any of these lines except MB062C; see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 and <a href=\"#fig2s7\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 7</a> for a description of the assay used.",

Each of the 21 MB output neuron (MBON) types elaborates segregated dendritic arbors along the parallel axons of \u223c2000 Kenyon cells, forming 15 compartments that collectively tile the MB lobes. MBON axons project to five discrete neuropils outside of the MB and three MBON types form a feedforward network in the lobes. Each of the 20 dopaminergic neuron (DAN) types projects axons to one, or at most two, of the MBON compartments. Convergence of DAN axons on compartmentalized Kenyon cell\u2013MBON synapses creates a highly ordered unit that can support learning to impose valence on sensory representations. The elucidation of the complement of neurons of the MB provides a comprehensive anatomical substrate from which one can infer a functional logic of associative olfactory learning and memory."

For each driver line, the source of the enhancer fragments used to make the p65ADZp and ZpGAL4DBD constructs are given. Most enhancer fragments are from the collection of GAL4 lines described in <a href=\"#bib45\">Jenett et al. (2012)</a>; see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 for the details of the TH and TDC2 constructs. All ZpGAL4DBD constructs are inserted into <i>attP2</i>; the insertion sites of the p65ADZp constructs are indicated by the letter at the end of the driver name as follows: A, <i>su(Hw)attP8</i>; B, <i>attP40</i>; C, <i>VK00027</i>. The cell types in which expression is seen with each driver are indicated in the matrix; the level of expression in each cell type is indicated by the gray scale (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). Note that observed expression depends to some extent on the reporter construct used (see <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a> for an example). The data in this matrix were based on imaging with <i>pJFRC225-5xUAS-IVS-myr::smGFP-FLAG</i> in <i>VK00005</i>. The <i>VK00005</i> insertion site supports high-expression levels (Pfeiffer et al., 2012); many of the split-GAL4 drivers show more cell type specificity using reporters in <i>attP18</i> (see the accompanying paper for examples) (<a href=\"#bib4\">Aso et al., 2014</a>). We did not observe expression outside the central nervous system in any of these lines except MB062C; see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 and <a href=\"#fig2s7\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 7</a> for a description of the assay used.",

The resulting map reveals that the mushroom body contains roughly 2200 neurons, including seven types of Kenyon cells and 21 types of output cells, as well as 20 types of neurons that use the neurotransmitter dopamine. Moreover, this map provides insights into the circuits that support odor-based learning. It reveals, for example, that the mushroom body can be divided into 15 anatomical compartments that are each defined by the presence of a specific set of output and dopaminergic neuron cell types. Since the dopaminergic neurons help to shape a fly's response to odors on the basis of previous experience, this organization suggests that these compartments may be semi-autonomous information processing units."

Innate behaviors are observed in na\u00efve animals without prior learning or experience, suggesting that they are mediated by genetically determined neural circuits. Responses to most sensory stimuli, however, are not innate but experience-dependent, allowing an organism to respond appropriately in a variable and uncertain world. Thus, most sensory cues acquire behavioral relevance through learning. In <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, a number of different forms of learning have been observed in response to sensory stimuli (<a href=\"#bib87\">Siegel and Hall, 1979</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Liu et al., 1999</a>, <a href=\"#bib58\">2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Masek and Scott, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Schnaitmann et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Ofstad et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib104\">Vogt et al., 2014</a>). In associative olfactory learning, exposure to an odor (conditioned stimulus, CS) in association with an unconditioned stimulus (US) results in appetitive or aversive memory (<a href=\"#bib79\">Quinn et al., 1974</a>; <a href=\"#bib98\">Tempel et al., 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib101\">Tully and Quinn, 1985</a>).

The image was generated using a 3D image rendering software (FluoRender) (<a href=\"#bib108\">Wan et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib109\">Wan et al., 2012</a>). The 51 glomeruli of the AL extend projection neurons (PN) to the calyx of the MB and the lateral horn (LH). There are a total of \u223c200 PN; 6 from the DL3 glomerulus are shown. See <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a> for an introduction to olfactory circuit. (<b>B</b>) Subregions within the MB. The \u03b3 lobe, calyx, and pedunculus (ped) are displayed separately from other lobes; their normal positions are as shown in panel <b>A</b> and <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>. Color-coding is as in panel <b>A</b>. See below for a detailed description of dorsal accessory calyx (dAC) and ventral accessory calyx (vAC). (<b>C</b>) A schematic representation of the key cellular components and information flow during processing of olfactory inputs to the MB (see text for references and more details). Olfactory receptor neurons expressing the same odorant receptor converge onto a single glomerulus in the AL. A small number (generally 3\u20134) of PNs from each of the 51 AL glomeruli innervate the MB calyx where they synapse on the dendrites of the \u223c2000 Kenyon cells (KCs) in a globular structure, the calyx. Each KC exhibits, on average, 6.4 dendritic \u2018claws\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib15\">Butcher et al., 2012</a>), and each claw is innervated by a single PN. There is little order in connection patterns of PNs to KCs. The axons of the KCs project in parallel anteriorly through the pedunculus to the lobes, where KCs terminate onto the dendrites of MB output neurons (MBONs). KCs can be categorized into three major classes \u03b1/\u03b2, \u03b1\u2032/\u03b2\u2032, and \u03b3 based on their projection patterns in the lobes (<a href=\"#bib24\">Crittenden et al., 1998</a>). The \u03b2, \u03b2\u2032, and \u03b3 lobes constitute the medial lobes (also known as horizontal lobes), while the \u03b1 and \u03b1\u2032 lobes constitute the vertical lobes. These lobes are separately wrapped by ensheathing glia (<a href=\"#bib7\">Awasaki et al., 2008</a>). The \u03b1/\u03b2 and \u03b1\u2032/\u03b2\u2032 neurons bifurcate at the anterior end of the pedunculus and project to both the medial and vertical lobes (<a href=\"#bib53\">Lee et al., 1999</a>). The \u03b3 neurons project only to the medial lobe. Dendrites of MBONs and terminals of modulatory dopaminergic neurons (DANs) intersect the longitudinal axis of the KC axon bundle, forming 15 subdomains, five each in the \u03b1/\u03b2, \u03b1\u2032/\u03b2\u2032, and \u03b3 lobes (numbered \u03b11, \u03b12, and \u03b13 for subdomains in the \u03b1 lobe from proximal to distal) (<a href=\"#bib97\">Tanaka et al., 2008</a>). Additionally, one MBON and one DAN innervate the core of the distal pedunculus intersecting the \u03b1/\u03b2 KCs (pedc, see below). There are seven types of KCs; five of the seven types have their dendrites in the main calyx, while those of the \u03b3d cells form the vAC (<a href=\"#bib2\">Aso et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Butcher et al., 2012</a>) and those of the \u03b1/\u03b2p cells the dAC (<a href=\"#bib97\">Tanaka et al., 2008</a>). The accessory calyces are thought to receive non-olfactory input since they do not receive input from the PNs from the AL (<a href=\"#bib97\">Tanaka et al., 2008</a>). Different KCs occupy distinct layers in the lobes as indicated (p: posterior; c: core; s: surface; m: medial; a: anterior; and d: dorsal). Some MB extrinsic neurons extend processes to only a specific layer within a subdomain, defining elemental subdivisions in the lobes, or \u2018synaptic units\u2019 as proposed by <a href=\"#bib97\">Tanaka et al. (2008)</a>."

Most antennal lobe projection neurons (PNs) extend dendrites to a single glomerulus and project axons that bifurcate to innervate two brain regions, the lateral horn and the MB (<a href=\"#bib88\">Stocker et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib110\">Wong et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Jefferis et al., 2007</a>). The invariant circuitry of the lateral horn is thought to mediate innate behaviors, whereas the MB translates olfactory sensory information into learned behavioral responses (<a href=\"#bib36\">Heisenberg et al., 1985</a>). The PN axons synapse onto the dendrites of the Kenyon cells (KCs) in the MB calyx; the parallel axons of the KCs form the MB lobes.

The MBONs of a given type exhibit spatially stereotyped dendritic arbors in the MB lobes that form 15 compartments that collectively tile the lobes.

These GAL4 drivers typically label many other neurons, making it difficult to disambiguate the projection patterns of the labeled MB neurons. We therefore identified lines with overlapping expression patterns for the MB neurons and used the split-GAL4 strategy (<a href=\"#bib60\">Luan et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Pfeiffer et al., 2010</a>) to identify lines with more restricted expression in the MB (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). After screening 2500 such intersections, we obtained more than 400 split-GAL4 combinations that had strong expression in the MB neurons. Most split-GAL4 lines that drive expression in MBONs or DANs contain a small number of neurons that share virtually identical morphologies and exhibit bilateral symmetry, and this profile is maintained across different individuals (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplements 3\u20136</a> and data not shown).

These split-GAL4 lines allowed us to classify the MB neurons into cell types (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> and <a href=\"#media2\">Videos 2\u20134</a>). We operationally define a cell type as a single neuron (per hemisphere) or a group of neurons that is not further subdivided in any of the 7000 GAL4 lines. Moreover, neurons within most cell types exhibit indistinguishable morphology. Importantly, we identified on average 12 GAL4 drivers that label the same cell type within the set of 7000 lines, indicating that the screen was near saturation in our large GAL4 collection."

The optic lobes (OL), central brain (CB), and ventral nerve cord (VNC) are indicated. The enhancer fragments from these lines were used to generate the fly line MB018B carrying both <i>R20G03-p65ADZp</i> in <i>attP40</i> and <i>R19F09-ZpGAL4DBD</i> in <i>attP2</i> (right). The p65ADZp and ZpGAL4DBD proteins are themselves inactive; the reconstitution of an active GAL4 transcription factor requires heterodimerization that occurs only in cells expressing both proteins (<a href=\"#bib60\">Luan et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Pfeiffer et al., 2010</a>). This approach, therefore, labels cells in which both enhancers are active. The arrow indicates the cell body of one MBON-\u03b1\u20322 cell visualized using <i>pJFRC225-5xUAS-IVS-myr::smGFP-FLAG</i> reporter in <i>VK00005</i> (white).

We also generated split-GAL4 lines for a variety of other modulatory cell types that project to the MB including serotonergic, GABAergic, octopaminergic, and peptidergic neurons (<a href=\"#fig2s6\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 6</a>). We chose lines with minimal off-target expression in neuronal and non-neuronal cells (<a href=\"#fig2s7\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 7</a>) to facilitate the use of these lines in future functional analyses to manipulate the activity of individual cell types."

These are the three major intrinsic and extrinsic neuron types innervating the MB lobes. Additionally, there are two intrinsic neurons (MB-APL and MB-DPM) and 10 extrinsic neuron types that innervate the MB; see <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a> for references. The extrinsic neurons with processes in the lobes include two types of octopaminergic neurons (OA-VPM3 and OA-VPM4) and one type of peptidergic neuron (SIFamide).

                                "text": "(<b>A</b>) Schematic representation of the experiment. PA-GFP was expressed pan-neuronally, using a <i>synaptobrevin-GAL4</i> driver, except in the KCs where GAL4 activity was suppressed by <i>MB247-GAL80</i>. Photoactivation of the MB lobes was guided by a red fluorescent protein expressed broadly in the KCs (<i>MB247-DsRed</i>). A two-photon laser was used to achieve three-dimensional precision of the photoactivation. Photoactivation results in an increase in the fluorescence of PA-GFP molecules in the processes of neurons innervating the MB lobes. The photoactivated GFP molecules then diffuse throughout the cytoplasm of these neurons, revealing both cell bodies and processes (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 for details and limitations). (<b>B</b>) Baseline fluorescence of PA-GFP before photoactivation in the ventral medial (top; cluster 1 in panel <b>D</b>) or posterior lateral region of the brain (bottom; cluster 2 in panel <b>D</b>). Each panel represents a maximum intensity projection of z-stack images obtained with two-photon microscopy. (<b>C</b>) Fluorescence of PA-GFP after photoactivation of the right MB lobes in the same brain regions as in (<b>B</b>). The cell bodies as well as the processes of photoactivated neurons are labeled strongly with PA-GFP. The cell bodies of MB-DPM and MB-APL neurons were also visualized. (<b>D</b>) MB extrinsic neurons as identified by PA-GFP tracing upon photoactivation of the right MB lobes. Shown here is a three-dimensional reconstruction of a confocal stack. KCs are labeled in magenta (<i>MB247-DsRed</i>) and the cell bodies and the processes of photoactivated neurons are shown in green (native PA-GFP fluorescence). Five clusters of cell bodies comprising more than two cells were detected reproducibly (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019) and are schematically indicated by the boxes (bottom): 1, ventral medial cluster; 2, posterior lateral cluster; 3, dorsal medial cluster; 4, anterior lateral cluster; and 5, delineated by the dashed lines, the anterior medial cluster that includes the PAM-cluster DANs. PA-GFP labeling in the contralateral (i.e., left) hemisphere includes the cell bodies of DANs (the PAM cluster DANs in the anterior medial region and the PPL1 cluster DANs in the posterior lateral region), as they innervate the MB lobes bilaterally. Eight individual neurons were also detected, which include MB-APL and MB-DPM in the ipsilateral hemisphere, and one MBON-\u03b21&gt;\u03b1, one MBON-\u03b34&gt;\u03b31\u03b32 (closed arrow), one MBON-\u03b33, and one MBON-\u03b33\u03b2\u20321 (open arrow) in the contralateral hemisphere, because these extend dendrites in the contralateral MB lobes (see below). In addition, one cell body ventral to the calyx (arrowhead) and one cell body ventral lateral to the antennal lobe were reproducibly observed, which represent MBONs not identified in the split-GAL4 lines (see <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, also see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). The comparison of number of cells identified in split-GAL4 lines and in the PA-GFP tracing experiments is as follows: cluster name; cell counts by split-GAL4 lines, cell counts by PA-GFP tracing (sample size): (1) Ventral medial; 5, 5.2 \u00b1 0.8 (n = 5).

Note that the split-GAL4 line labeling the MBON-\u03b2\u20321 type, which comprises of 7\u20139 cells in the anterior lateral cluster (MB078C, see <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>) includes at least three cells that exhibit very sparse dendritic arbors in the MB lobes as examined by multicolor flp-out experiments (data not shown). This was also observed in an independent experiment, in which the \u03b2\u20321 compartment was specifically photoactivated (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>) and may account for the fact that PA-GFP experiments identified fewer cells than the split-GAL4 lines in the anterior lateral cluster. It was not feasible to accurately count the large number of cells in the anterior medial cluster (cluster 5; indicated as a dashed box) comprising mostly the PAM DANs and several MBONs such as MBON-\u03b11 (see <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> and \u2018Materials and methods\u2019).

                                "text": "We photoactivated each of the 15 MB lobe subdomains (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>), or compartments (see below), individually to provide an independent approach to identify the extrinsic neurons associated with each compartment. PA-GFP was expressed pan-neuronally using a <i>synaptobrevin-QF</i> driver (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019) but was suppressed in \u03b1/\u03b2 and \u03b3 KCs using <i>MB247-QS</i>. Note that the \u03b1\u2032/\u03b2\u2032 KCs were visualized when compartments in the \u03b1\u2032/\u03b2\u2032 lobes were photoactivated (e.g., panel <b>B</b>). Different split-GAL4 lines (e.g., MBON lines for panels <b>A</b> and <b>B</b>, and DAN lines for panels <b>C</b> and <b>D</b>) were used to drive expression of membrane-targeted red fluorescent protein (myr::tdTomato) to demarcate a specific compartment within the lobes for photoactivation. The photoactivated samples were subsequently immunostained for a marker of dopaminergic cells (tyrosine hydroxylase [not shown] or dopa-decarboxylase [DDC, see panels <b>E</b> and <b>F</b>]) to classify individual photoactivated neurons as MBONs or DANs (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). (<b>A</b>\u2013<b>D</b>) Each panel shows a diagram of the experiment and a three-dimensional reconstruction of confocal images showing DANs and MBONs innervating the photoactivated compartment. Photoactivation was performed unilaterally (i.e., right) as indicated in the diagram. Native PA-GFP fluorescence is shown alone in gray scale in the middle panel and in green in the bottom panel together with myr::tdTomato signals driven by the indicated split-GAL4 in magenta; overlap is white. We identified all of the MBONs found in the split-GAL4 lines by photoactivation of each compartment (arrows and data not shown). We also identified DANs innervating each compartment (for example, myr::tdTomato negative and PA-GFP positive cells in panels <b>A</b> and <b>B</b>). We noted additional DANs in the PAM cluster that are not labeled by the split-GAL4 lines (green cell bodies in panels <b>C</b> and <b>D</b>). We therefore counted PAM cluster DANs associated with each medial lobe compartment based on these PA-GFP experiments (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). The comparison of numbers of DANs in the PAM cluster identified in split-GAL4 lines and in the PA-GFP tracing experiments (i.e., photoactivated cells positive for tyrosine hydroxylase or dopa-decarboxylase) is as follows: compartment name; cell counts by split-GAL4 lines, cell counts by PA-GFP tracing (sample size): \u03b31; 13 (as mixtures of PAM-\u03b34 and PAM-\u03b34&gt;\u03b31\u03b32 in MB312B), 3.8 \u00b1 1.3 (n = 5). \u03b32; 13 (as mixtures of PAM-\u03b34 and PAM-\u03b34&gt;\u03b31\u03b32 in MB312B), 7.8 \u00b1 2.2 (n = 6). \u03b33; 9 (MB441B), 23.6 \u00b1 6.3 (n = 5). \u03b34; 13 (as mixtures of PAM-\u03b34 and PAM-\u03b34&gt;\u03b31\u03b32 in MB312B), 17.3 \u00b1 1.3 (n = 6). \u03b35; 8 (MB315C), 21.5 \u00b1 1.3 (n = 6). \u03b2\u20321; 14 (as mixtures of PAM-\u03b2\u20321ap and PAM-\u03b2\u20321m in MB025B), 12.8 \u00b1 1.3 (n = 4). \u03b2\u20322; 35 (sum of PAM-\u03b2\u20322a in MB109B, PAM-\u03b2\u20322m in MB032B, PAM-\u03b2\u20322p in MB056B, and PAM-\u03b22\u03b2\u20322a in NP5272), 41.3 \u00b1 6.6 (n = 4). \u03b21; 5 (sum of PAM-\u03b21 in MB063B and at least one PAM-\u03b21 in MB194B), 6.6 \u00b1 1.1 (n = 5). \u03b22; 11 (sum of PAM-\u03b22\u03b2\u20322a in NP5272 and PAM-\u03b22 in MB209B), 18.8 \u00b1 4.3 (n = 5). Thus, by simply summing the number of cells associated with these compartments, PA-GFP experiments identified \u223c154 DANs in the anterior medial cluster (i.e., PAM cluster) as compared to 121 cells labeled by the split-GAL4 lines. Note these numbers include PAM DANs innervating multiple compartments (PAM-\u03b34&gt;\u03b31\u03b32 and PAM-\u03b22\u03b2\u20322a) and are therefore an overestimate. The split-GAL4 collection identified 98 DANs of 14 types in the PAM cluster, whereas anti-dopamine immunostaining identified 115\u2013135 DANs in the PAM cluster (<a href=\"#bib57\">Liu et al., 2012</a>). (<b>E</b>) An example of immunostaining for dopa-decarboxylase (DDC) upon photoactivation of a single compartment. The panels represent a single confocal section of the PAM cluster upon photoactivation of the \u03b35 compartment. (<b>F</b>) The \u03b34\u03b35 extrinsic neuron identified by the PA-GFP tracing and not in the split-GAL4 screen shown in <b>D</b> (arrowhead) is DDC-negative and thus is likely an MBON. Images are maximum intensity projections. Dorsal is to the top and lateral is to the right. The cell body of this \u03b34\u03b35 MBON is positioned between the PPL1 and PPL2c DAN clusters.

A three-dimensional reconstruction of a confocal stack with neuropil labeled by nc82 immunostaining (gray) and the \u03b34\u03b35 MBON labeled by anti-Texas-Red immunostaining (red) is shown (bottom). The arrowhead indicates the cell body that is located close to the posterior surface of the brain ventral to the MB calyx. This neuron as well as an additional MBON with its cell body ventral lateral to the antennal lobe observed in PA-GFP experiments was found in a VT-GAL4 line (see <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a> for single cell morphologies).

We defined MBONs as neurons that have dendrites in the MB. The antennal lobe projection neurons are also MB-extrinsic neurons by definition, but not listed. The polarity of neurons was often obvious in high-resolution confocal images of membrane labeled cells (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A,B</a>) in which presynaptic terminals and dendrites exhibit distinctive morphologies. However, in each case we confirmed the polarity using a reporter that localizes to presynapses by virtue of the synaptic vesicle protein Synaptotagmin (<i>pJFRC51-3xUAS-Syt::smGFP-HA</i> in <i>su(Hw)attP1</i>; <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>). In addition to the 21 MBON cell types, one neuron (MBON-calyx, or MB-CP1) extends dendrites in the main calyx, the posterior part of the pedunculus and the ventral part of the lateral horn, and thus we classify this as an atypical MB output neuron (see <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

For the MBONs with axon terminals in the MB lobes, the \u2018&gt;\u2019 symbol followed by the compartments, or the lobes, in which the axon terminals innervate is appended to the dendritic compartment (e.g., MBON-\u03b21&gt;\u03b1 for the MB output neuron with dendrites in \u03b21 and presynaptic terminals in the \u03b1 lobe). For the DAN type with dendrites in the MB lobes, the \u2018&lt;\u2019 symbol followed by the compartments in which its dendritic arbors elaborate is appended to the compartment with axon terminals (e.g., PAM-\u03b34&lt;\u03b31\u03b32 for the PAM neuron that terminates in \u03b34 and has dendrites in \u03b31 and \u03b32).

The dendrites of the KCs form the MB calyx and their parallel axons form the three MB lobes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>) (<a href=\"#bib24\">Crittenden et al., 1998</a>). The main calyx primarily receives olfactory input from the antennal lobe, whereas the smaller ventral and dorsal accessory calyces are thought to receive non-olfactory input (see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>) (<a href=\"#bib97\">Tanaka et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Butcher et al., 2012</a>). The KCs have been divided into three classes, \u03b3, \u03b1\u2032/\u03b2\u2032, and \u03b1/\u03b2, with each class projecting axons to the eponymous lobe (<a href=\"#bib24\">Crittenden et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Lee et al., 1999</a>). The split-GAL4 screen and the analysis of the axonal projection patterns of single cells revealed that these three classes of KCs divide into seven cell types (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a> and <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). Each of the four neuroblasts contributes to each of the seven cell types and the dendrites of the KCs generated from the different neuroblasts remain segregated in the main calyx (<a href=\"#bib56\">Lin et al., 2007</a>). The parallel axon fibers of each of the seven types of KCs occupy specific layers within the \u03b3, \u03b1\u2032/\u03b2\u2032, and \u03b1/\u03b2 lobes (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figures 6 and 7</a>). Two KC types divide the \u03b3 lobe into the main and dorsal (d) layers, two types divide the \u03b1\u2032/\u03b2\u2032 lobe into the middle (m) and anterior\u2013posterior (ap) layers, and three KC types divide the \u03b1/\u03b2 lobe into the posterior (p), core (c), and surface (s) layers (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figures 6 and 7</a>, also see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Examination of single cell morphologies suggests that each KC may form <i>en passant</i> synapses with target MBONs along the length of its axon, providing each MBON with access to a large number of KC inputs. Five of the seven types of KCs elaborate their dendrites in the main calyx, whereas two types of KCs (\u03b3d and \u03b1/\u03b2p) have dendrites exclusively in the ventral and dorsal accessory calyces, respectively (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figures 6A and 7A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib56\">Lin et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib97\">Tanaka et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Butcher et al., 2012</a>)."

Representative aligned images of each KC type (see also <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>) are shown; the name of the cell type and the approximate number of cells per brain hemisphere are indicated. Three examples of single cell morphologies, segmented from multicolor flip-out experiments, are presented for each cell type illustrating the branching pattern of the KC axons as they project through the lobes. In the single cell images, the cell body, primary neurite, dendrites, and axon in the pedunculus have been false-colored green and axons in the lobes are magenta. Based on co-expression in specific split-GAL4 lines and single cell morphologies, we have divided the KC population into 7 cell types. The number of cells of each type was estimated by counting labeled nuclei in split-GAL4 lines (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019) and is shown in parentheses. (<b>A</b>) The \u03b3d KCs are thought to be of embryonic origin, because they are not included in a clonal analysis that visualized all post-embryonic KCs (<a href=\"#bib56\">Lin et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib112\">Yu et al., 2013</a>), and they have morphological similarity to the embryonic born KCs of basal cockroaches (<a href=\"#bib30\">Farris and Strausfeld, 2003</a>). Their dendritic arbors form a protrusion extending ventral lateral to the main calyx, which we named the ventral accessory calyx (vAC). Their axons occupy the most peripheral layer in the pedunculus, the ventral and anterior layers in the \u03b31\u2013\u03b34 compartments, and the dorsal layer in \u03b35. Single cell morphologies (from MB028B and MB355B) reveal that the \u03b3d axons have more branches in \u03b33\u2013\u03b35 than in \u03b31 and \u03b32. The vAC may be devoted to non-olfactory inputs; the major types of olfactory projection neurons from the antennal lobe do not innervate this structure (<a href=\"#bib15\">Butcher et al., 2012</a>). (<b>B</b>) The \u03b3 main KCs have their dendrites in the main calyx and their axons occupy about 75% of the volume of the \u03b3 lobes. Single cell morphologies (from MB369B and MB355B) reveal that each \u03b3 main KC branches in all the five compartments of the \u03b3 lobe. (<b>C</b>) The \u03b1\u2032/\u03b2\u2032ap KCs have dendrites in the main calyx and project axons to the anterior and posterior layers of the \u03b1\u2032/\u03b2\u2032 lobes. Single cell morphologies (from MB461B and MB463B) reveal that axonal branches from single KCs project to both \u03b2\u20322a and \u03b2\u20322p, where they overlap with distinct sets of output and dopaminergic neurons (see below). (<b>D</b>) The \u03b1\u2032/\u03b2\u2032m KCs have dendrites in the main calyx. In \u03b2\u20322, their axons are located in the area between the bifurcating axons of \u03b1\u2032/\u03b2\u2032ap neurons shown in panel <b>C</b>. In the \u03b1\u2032 lobe, their axons are medial to those of the \u03b1\u2032/\u03b2\u2032ap cells. Single cell images are from MB418B and MB369B."

The \u03b1/\u03b2p KC axons project to the posterior layer of the \u03b1/\u03b2 lobe.

They can be morphologically subdivided into inner and outer core cells (<a href=\"#bib97\">Tanaka et al., 2008</a>), although the border between the inner and outer core is not well defined and we were unable to make a split-GAL4 driver line that labels only the outer core cells.

Each KC cell type sends axonal projections to a spatially segregated layer in the lobes. The dendritic arbors of each KC type also tend to be found in the same regions of the calyx (<a href=\"#bib56\">Lin et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Leiss et al., 2009</a>), but those dendritic zones are largely overlapping and individual KCs within a given cell type exhibit variable dendritic projection patterns (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figures 6 and 7</a>). Moreover, the KCs receive input from an apparently random collection of glomeruli (<a href=\"#bib67\">Murthy et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Caron et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Gruntman and Turner, 2013</a>).

These observations suggest a unique function of the KCs in the processing of olfactory information (see \u2018Discussion\u2019)."

The 15 lobe compartments and the core of distal pedunculus (pedc) are separated with thick vertical lines, and each compartment is further divided into columns representing \u2018synaptic units\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib97\">Tanaka et al., 2008</a>), elemental subdivisions that are the smallest regions in the MB lobes where a specific set of MBONs, DANs, and KC types overlap. For example, the \u03b21 compartment can be divided into posterior (\u03b21p), surface (\u03b21s), and core (\u03b21c) subdivisions containing the axons of the \u03b1/\u03b2p, \u03b1/\u03b2s, and \u03b1/\u03b2c KCs, respectively. The processes of some MBONs and DANs do not arborize in an entire compartment, but only in a subset of its elemental subdivisions. <a href=\"#bib97\">Tanaka et al. (2008)</a> first described this anatomical feature and called such regions \u2018synaptic units\u2019. An example is shown in <a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11D</a>, which shows a two-color labeling experiment illustrating the subdivision of the \u03b12 compartment by the dendrites of the two MBONs, one of which arborizes in the domain of the posterior KCs (\u03b12p) and the other in the domain of the surface and core KCs (\u03b12sc); this arrangement is diagrammed in Panel <b>D</b>. The heavy vertical lines divide subdivisions into three groups representing different MBON neurotransmitter types (also indicated by the colors filling the cells of the matrix). The rows of the matrix correspond to the cell types of KCs, MBONs, and DANs. See <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a> for synonyms for cell type names and references. The colors of the cells of the matrix indicate the putative transmitter for MBONs and cluster of origin for DANs. The color correspondence is given below the matrix. The two MBON types of unknown neurotransmitter type are indicated in light gray. The fully-colored cells of the matrix represent processes of neurons (dendrites for MBONs and synaptic terminals for DANs) that are uniformly and densely distributed in that subdivision; fainter colors represent subdivisions that are innervated only sparsely. In three cases, output neurons send axon terminals back into the MB. Such cases are represented by an \u2018X\u2019 with the size representing the density of terminals in that subdivision. One DAN cell type (PAM-\u03b34&lt;\u03b31\u03b32) has dendrites within (as well as outside) the lobes in the subdivisions indicated by an \u2018O\u2019 (see <a href=\"#fig14s1\">Figure 14\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). The projection patterns of the GABAergic MB-APL and serotonergic MB-DPM are diagramed; these neurons are MB intrinsic neurons that broadly innervate the MB (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B,C</a>) (<a href=\"#bib107\">Waddell et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib97\">Tanaka et al., 2008</a>). Also diagrammed are the projection patterns of the octopaminergic OA-VPM3 and OA-VPM4 (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>) (<a href=\"#bib13\">Busch et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Busch and Tanimoto, 2010</a>) and SIFamide peptidergic neurons (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1F</a>) (<a href=\"#bib103\">Verleyen et al., 2004</a>) within the lobes; these neurons have only a small fraction of their terminals within the MB (<a href=\"#fig2s6\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 6</a>) and these sparsely innervate only a subset of the compartments. The following abbreviations are used in the names of the subdivisions: a, anterior; m, middle; p, posterior; d, dorsal; s, surface; c, core; and pedc, pedunculus core. (<b>B</b>\u2013<b>D</b>) Diagrams illustrating different circuit motifs found in the MB lobes. (<b>B</b>) The terminals of a single DAN type (PAM-\u03b11) and the dendrites of a single MBON type (MBON-\u03b11) occupy a compartment. 16 of the 21 MBON types, like MBON-\u03b11, arborize dendrites within just one of the three lobes (i.e., \u03b3, \u03b1\u2032/\u03b2\u2032, and \u03b1/\u03b2), indicating that these MBONs receive inputs from only one of the three KC classes. (<b>C</b>) Two DANs (PAM-\u03b35 and PAM-\u03b2\u20322a) innervate the region occupied by one MBON (MBON-\u03b35\u03b2\u20322a). One DAN fills the \u03b35 compartment and the other only innervates the anterior elemental subdivision of the \u03b2\u20322 compartment (\u03b2\u20322a); a single MBON has inputs from the areas defined by both DANs. Four MBON types, like MBON-\u03b35\u03b2\u20322a, extend dendrites spanning lobe boundaries. (<b>D</b>) A single DAN (PPL1-\u03b1\u20322\u03b12) innervate two compartments (the \u03b1\u20322 and \u03b12), an area covered by three MBON types (MBON-\u03b1\u20322, -\u03b12sc, and -\u03b12p3p). Eight MBON types, like MBON-\u03b12sc and MBON-\u03b12p3p, arborize dendrites further confined to elemental subdivision(s) within a compartment. This suggests that these MBONs receive input exclusively from subtypes of KCs; for example, MBON-\u03b12p3p receives input from \u03b1/\u03b2p KCs, which presumably carry non-olfactory information (see <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). Nearly all DANs have their termini confined to a single compartment; however, we identified 3 DAN types that have axon terminals in two compartments."

The number of cells per cell type found in each brain hemisphere is shown in parentheses. Some cell types were not separated by split intersections and images show mixtures of cell types in these cases. Except for PAM-\u03b34&lt;\u03b31\u03b32 and PPL1-\u03b31, DANs have dendritic branches in the ipsilateral hemisphere and axons that bilaterally innervate the same MB compartments in both hemispheres. The distribution of neurites outside the MB lobes is shown in more detail in <a href=\"#fig18s1\">Figure 18\u2014figure supplement 1</a>. The split-GAL4 drivers for each cell type are listed in <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a> and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary File 1</a>. (<b>A</b>) The dendrites of MBON-\u03b35\u03b2\u20322a arborize in the contralateral \u03b35 and \u03b2\u20322a. The major axon of MBON-\u03b35\u03b2\u20322a projects ipsilaterally to the superior medial protocerebrum (SMP), whereas a very thin axon projects to the CRE and SMP in the other hemisphere (see <a href=\"#fig14s1\">Figure 14\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). (<b>B</b>) PAM-\u03b35 neurons. Dendrites of these neuron arborize in the same regions of SMP where the MBON-\u03b35\u03b2\u20322a neurons terminate, suggesting a possible recurrent loop (see text and <a href=\"#fig20\">Figure 20C</a>).

(<b>D</b>) The dendrites of MBON-\u03b22\u03b2\u20322a bilaterally arborize in the \u03b22 compartment and \u03b2\u20322a subdivision and its axon projects ipsilaterally to the superior intermediate protocerebrum (SIP) and superior lateral protocerebrum (SLP) (see also <a href=\"#fig14s1\">Figure 14\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). (<b>E</b>) PAM-\u03b22 neurons. (<b>F</b>) PAM-\u03b22\u03b2\u20322a neurons have sparse terminals in the anterior layer of \u03b2\u20322a and even sparser terminals in the core layer of \u03b22. The dendrites of PAM-\u03b22\u03b2\u20322a and PAM-\u03b22 are spatially segregated, suggesting that distinct upstream neurons regulate their activity. (<b>G</b>) MBON-\u03b2\u20322mp arborizes in the contralateral \u03b2\u20322mp; its main axon projects to the CRE and SMP on the same side and its minor axon to the ipsilateral side (<a href=\"#fig14s1\">Figure 14\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). A second output neuron, MBON-\u03b2\u20322mp-bilateral, sparsely arborizes its dendrites in the \u03b2\u20322mp compartment and projects dense axons bilaterally (see <a href=\"#fig14s1\">Figure 14\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). (<b>H</b>) PAM-\u03b2\u20322p neurons. (<b>I</b>) PAM-\u03b2\u20322m neurons. (<b>J</b>) The MBON-\u03b34&gt;\u03b31\u03b32 dendrites arborize in the contralateral \u03b34 and its axon projects both within the lobes to \u03b31 and \u03b32 and to regions outside the lobes. (<b>K</b>) PAM-\u03b34 neurons and PAM-\u03b34&lt;\u03b31\u03b32 neurons. The image shows a mixture of two cell types; PAM-\u03b34&lt;\u03b31\u03b32 is unusual, in which it has some of its dendrites within the MB (in the \u03b31 and \u03b32 compartments; see <a href=\"#fig14s1\">Figure 14\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). (<b>L</b>) The MBON-\u03b21&gt;\u03b1 dendrites arborize in the contralateral \u03b21 and its axon innervates the \u03b11, \u03b12, and \u03b13 compartments within the lobes as well as areas outside the lobes (see <a href=\"#fig14s1\">Figure 14\u2014figure supplement 1F</a>); the terminals in \u03b13 are concentrated in the surface and posterior layers. (<b>M</b>) PAM-\u03b21 neurons (bottom). The posterior layer of \u03b21 is more densely innervated by a second PAM cluster cell type, PAM-\u03b21ped, that also projects to the posterior end of the pedunculus (see <a href=\"#fig14s1\">Figure 14\u2014figure supplement 1G</a>). (<b>N</b>) The dendrites of MBON-\u03b11 arborize in \u03b11 and its axons project to the posterior SIP and SLP. Two neurons with identical morphology are present in each hemisphere. Although we observed this cell type in MCFO analysis of the dVGlut-GAL4 line OK371 (<a href=\"#bib61\">Mahr and Aberle, 2006</a>), its terminals showed much weaker immunoreactivity to the anti-dVGluT than the other putative glutamatergic neurons. (<b>O</b>) PAM-\u03b11 neurons (bottom) have terminals that extend slightly outside the area arborized by the dendrites of MBON-\u03b11 to the distal end of the pedunculus."

Computational alignment to a single reference brain extends these observations to all DAN types and further demonstrates that the DAN axon termini tile the MB lobes (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10H,J,L</a>). Thus, different MBON types have access to largely equivalent input from the KCs but are modulated by different DANs (<a href=\"#fig12\">Figures 12 and 13</a>). In classical learning paradigms, different DAN types respond to different unconditioned stimuli (US) (<a href=\"#bib80\">Riemensperger et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Mao and Davis, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Burke et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Liu et al., 2012</a>).

Each of these three MBONs projects to the compartments of other MBONs but not back to the compartment occupied by its own dendrites. Thus information flows in one direction, and these MBON connections could create a multi-layered feedforward network (<a href=\"#fig17\">Figure 17J</a>, see \u2018Discussion\u2019). 12 of the MBON types receive input from the KCs but not from other MBONs and therefore read out KC activity as a single output layer. Most of the MBONs having dendrites in the \u03b1\u2032/\u03b2\u2032 and \u03b3 lobes provide such a single-layer readout. In contrast, the glutamatergic MBON whose dendrites arborize in the \u03b34 compartment projects axons into the \u03b31 and \u03b32 compartments as well as to neuropils outside the MB (<a href=\"#fig17\">Figure 17A,G\u2013I</a>). Thus, the \u03b31 and \u03b32 MBONs have access to direct KC input as well as to the input provided by the \u03b34 MBON. The outputs of these two \u03b3 lobe compartments thus reflect a two-layer feedforward network. The readout of the \u03b1/\u03b2 lobe is even more elaborate because the \u03b31 MBON projects to all of the compartments of the \u03b1/\u03b2 lobe (<a href=\"#fig17\">Figure 17C,E,F</a>), and the \u03b21 MBON projects to the \u03b11, \u03b12, and \u03b13 compartments (<a href=\"#fig17\">Figure 17B</a>). The \u03b11, \u03b12, and \u03b13 MBONs thus represent a four-layer feedforward network with access to the KC activity of the \u03b1/\u03b2 and \u03b3 lobes, both directly and indirectly through MBON intermediaries (<a href=\"#fig17\">Figure 17J</a>)."

As different functions of learning and memory, such as acquisition and retrieval, have been attributed to different KC classes (<a href=\"#bib40\">Isabel et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Krashes et al., 2007</a>), MBONs integrating across lobes may function in coordinating different phases of learning and memory.

Within a neuropil, the axon terminals of each MBON type exhibit distinct and confined projection patterns, suggesting that different MBON types may synapse onto different neurons (<a href=\"#fig19\">Figure 19</a>, also see <a href=\"#fig14\">Figures 14\u201316</a> for individual MBON projection patterns). However, we also observed significant overlap between the axon terminals of different MBONs, suggesting that in certain cases MBONs may converge onto the same post-synaptic target neuron (<a href=\"#fig20\">Figure 20A,D,E</a>). These results, obtained by computational alignment, were confirmed for a subset of MBONs by two-color labeling experiments (<a href=\"#fig20\">Figure 20J\u2013L</a>; <a href=\"#media6\">Video 6</a>)."

Interestingly, 90% of the dendritic arbors of the DANs reside in four of the neuropils targeted by the MBONs: CRE, SMP, SIP, and SLP (<a href=\"#fig18\">Figures 18E and 19</a>). Because DANs are activated by unconditioned stimuli (US), these neuropils are likely targets of the US input (see \u2018Discussion\u2019). We observed cases where the dendrites of different DAN types in a single neuropil overlap (<a href=\"#fig20\">Figure 20B,F,G</a>), suggesting that they may share upstream input. Furthermore, we observed overlap between MBON terminals and DAN dendrites within each neuropil, implying that some MBONs may synapse on specific DANs (<a href=\"#fig20\">Figure 20C,H,I</a>). In some cases, the axon terminals of an MBON overlap with the dendrites of the DAN type innervating the same compartment (<a href=\"#fig20\">Figure 20H</a>). This may provide feedback that regulates dopamine release and hence learning. In other cases, axon termini of MBONs from one compartment overlap with the dendrites of DAN types projecting to different compartments (<a href=\"#fig20\">Figure 20I</a>). This provides a pathway through which the activity of one MBON could modulate the synapses between KCs and MBONs of other compartments."

These cholinergic MBONs may exploit LH neurons capable of eliciting innate behaviors to generate learned olfactory responses (<a href=\"#bib86\">Sejourne et al., 2011</a>). This connection may also serve to modulate innate behavioral responses as a consequence of learning.

In the representation of odors by the antennal lobe projection neurons, every odor can be thought of as a point in an approximately 50 dimensional space, each dimension corresponding to a particular glomerulus. The KC representation of odor identity has a dimension at least an order of magnitude larger, not only because there are many more KCs than antennal lobe glomeruli but also because the KCs mix projection neuron inputs nonlinearly (<a href=\"#bib33\">Gruntman and Turner, 2013</a>). The dimension of the KC representation not only allows for a far greater capacity to respond appropriately to a large number of odors, it can also enhance performance in more complex decision-related tasks. Interestingly, the lack of structure in the input to the KCs, the small number of inputs, and the sparseness of their activity all appear to be tuned to maximize this dimension (<a href=\"#bib73\">Perez-Orive et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Huerta et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Caron et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Gruntman and Turner, 2013</a>) (Ann Kennedy, Columbia University Thesis).

The dimension of the MBON can be no greater than their number (34) and is likely to be considerably smaller because there are only 21 different MBON cell types. Thus, rather than providing a general representation of odor identity, the activity of the individual MBONs is more likely to encode a set of \u2018state variables\u2019 that collectively bias behavioral responses to sensory stimuli. This bias is likely to reflect the combined effects of external experiences and the internal state of the fly (see accompanying paper) (<a href=\"#bib4\">Aso et al., 2014</a>, <a href=\"#bib49\">Krashes et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Bracker et al., 2013</a>).

Thus, the high-dimensional representation of odor identity in the KCs may be transformed into a low-dimensional representation that dictates behavioral bias. Just as an individual odor is represented by an ensemble of KCs, a given behavioral bias is likely to be represented by an ensemble of MBONs. In accord with this view, activation or inactivation of combinations of MBON cell types results in more robust effects on behavior than those observed with individual MBONs (see the accompanying paper) (<a href=\"#bib4\">Aso et al., 2014</a>)."

Each compartment therefore receives specific dopaminergic input capable of modifying the synapses between the KCs and specific MBONs. These compartments may reflect basic computational units of the MB. The specificity of the dopamine input and its ability to direct learning may therefore transform the unstructured KC representation of odor to an ordered MBON representation encoding behavioral bias. Specific subpopulations of DANs may react to different features in the external and internal world (<a href=\"#bib62\">Mao and Davis, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Liu et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib99\">Tomchik, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Das et al., 2014</a>).

The interactions among the different MBON types may form a multi-layer feedforward readout network (<a href=\"#fig17\">Figure 17</a>). Processing through such a network significantly expands the computational capacity of a readout system, which can be valuable for more complex learning strategies. Consider a learning scenario in which a fly associates an odor with a strongly aversive US. A conditioned aversive response to the initial odor could occur through plastic changes affecting an ensemble of output neurons, and a low response threshold could allow these responses to generalize to related odors. Upon further experience, some odors within this category might be identified as \u2018safe\u2019 or even appetitive. Ethologically important exceptions could be learned if one of the neurons that interconnect compartments (MBON-\u03b34&gt;\u03b31\u03b32, MBON-\u03b31pedc&gt;\u03b1/\u03b2, and MBON-\u03b21&gt;\u03b1) became responsive to a \u2018safe\u2019 odor and inhibited the original trained ensemble of aversive MBONs.

Thus, MBONs may modify the activity of the DANs that modulate their own activity and plasticity, resulting in a recurrent loop. This could provide positive or negative feedback to a specific compartment. Positive feedback might enhance learning to particularly salient stimuli, whereas negative feedback might suppress dopamine release once the correct response has been learned. These recurrent connections may also allow output from one compartment to modulate learning in other compartments, as some MBONs appear to target DANs that innervate non-cognate compartments."

The CRE, SMP, SIP, and SLP may be sites of convergence for all of the signals relevant for classical conditioning. These convergence zones are major sites of arborization for the dendrites of the DANs and axons of the MBONs. Since DANs are activated in response to an aversive or appetitive US, these neuropils are also likely to receive input from neurons transmitting information about the nature of the US. A US, by definition, elicits an innate behavioral response consistent with its valence, suggesting that the outputs from these neuropils may convey motor commands. Interestingly, dendrites of neurons projecting to the fan-shaped body in the central complex, a brain region coordinating motor actions (<a href=\"#bib91\">Strauss, 2002</a>), arborize in these neuropils (<a href=\"#bib35\">Hanesch et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib111\">Young and Armstrong, 2010</a>). We therefore postulate an evolutionary primitive circuit in the MBON convergence zones, in which US inputs activate motor command neurons to elicit innate responses. Evolution may have built upon this simple reflex circuit, incorporating pathways from the MB that generate learned behaviors in response to a CS (<a href=\"#fig21\">Figure 21</a>)."

These compartments are interconnected inside the lobes and the MBONs send converging outputs (color-coded arrows) to small subregions within five neuropils: the lateral horn (LH), CRE, SMP, SIP, and SLP. The dendrites of DANs are also confined mostly in the convergence zones within the CRE, SMP, SIP, and SLP. These neuropils, therefore, must receive information encoding the unconditioned stimuli (US), such as sugar and shock, which recruit DANs for memory formation. In the simplest model, these same sensory inputs would activate not just the DANs but also other output neurons of these neuropils that elicit appropriate unconditioned behaviors. MBON, conveying the learned valence of stimuli, might then terminate onto these same output neurons. A subset of projection neurons from the antennal lobe and LH output neurons (LHONs) also converge with MBONs in these zones (see accompanying paper <a href=\"#bib4\">Aso et al., 2014</a>). In this way, learned and innate responses could use a common set of downstream circuits, originating in the LH, CRE, SMP, SIP, and SLP, to drive behavior."

This is in sharp contrast to most brain structures in invertebrates that consist of small number of neurons with stereotyped projections that suggest determined connections. The MB represents an exception. The MB lobes are formed by the axons of a large number of equivalent neurons, the KCs, and as with vertebrate cortical neurons, the number of KCs increases in species with more complex behaviors (<a href=\"#bib89\">Strausfeld, 2012</a>). Moreover, the inputs to the KCs from olfactory projection neurons are not determined or stereotyped but appear random. Thus, the MB diverges from the highly ordered neural architecture typical of the invertebrate nervous system. The MB may therefore represent an evolutionary primitive brain structure homologous in form and function to structures in the vertebrate brain (<a href=\"#bib84\">Schurmann, 1974</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Laurent, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib100\">Tomer et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Farris, 2011</a>). The elucidation of the inputs and outputs of the MB may now permit an understanding of how learning links an abstract representation to a specific behavior, and this may provide insight into higher associative functions in both invertebrate and vertebrate brains."

Photoactivation was performed using a two-photon laser scanning microscope (Ultima, Prairie Technologies, Middleton, WI) with an ultrafast Ti:S laser (Chameleon Vision, Coherent, Santa Clara, CA) modulated by Pockels Cells (Conoptics, Danbury, CT). A water immersion objective (60X/1.0 NA, Olympus, Japan) was used for both visualization and photoactivation. Emitted photons were detected by a GaAsP detector (Hamamatsu Photonics, Japan) for green fluorescence and a PMT for red fluorescence. The laser was tuned to 925 nm for visualizing the samples (with an intensity of \u223c0.7\u20132 mW as measured after the objective) and 710 nm for photoactivation. The Pockels Cells bias voltage was adjusted to obtain maximum signal-to-noise ratio when tuned at 710 nm, and photoactivation laser intensity at 710 nm was adjusted to be between 2 and 3 mW as measured after the objective. The photoactivation scan was performed with a pixel size of 0.24\u20130.39 \u03bcm and pixel dwell time of 2 \u03bcs. Each pixel was scanned four times successively using the frame-averaging function of the microscope software (PrairieView, Prairie Technologies); this was repeated with each repetition separated by 10\u201330 s. A target volume, such as the MB lobes (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>) or a single MB lobe compartment (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>), was divided into 8\u201315 z-slices with 2\u20135 \u03bcm steps, depending on the size of the target as well as the orientation of the sample. The number of repetitions of the photoactivation scan depended on the expression levels of PA-GFP as well as the depth of the photoactivation target. For photoactivation of the MB lobes, the photoactivation scan was repeated 30\u201360 times. For photoactivation of a single compartment, the photoactivation scan was repeated 90\u2013120 times. All photoactivated samples were prepared for confocal microscopy as follows: fixed for 45 min at RT using 2% PFA/PBL (2% paraformaldehyde in 75 mM lysine, 37 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4), washed multiple times in PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100 (PBST), blocked with 10% normal goat serum in PBST, incubated in primary antibodies overnight at 4\u00b0C, washed multiple times in PBST, and incubated in secondary antibodies overnight at 4\u00b0C (or for more than 3 hr at RT) before final washes with PBST. The samples were mounted using either VECTASHIELD (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA) or SlowFade Gold (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) and confocal imaging was performed using an LSM510 with a Plan-Neofluar 40X/1.3 objective (Zeiss, Germany). The following primary and secondary antibodies were used: rabbit-anti-DsRed (1:1000, Clontech), nc82 (1:10, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank), mouse anti-tyrosine hydroxylase (1:100, EMD Millipore, Germany), rat anti-Dopa decarboxylase (1:400, a gift from Jay Hirsch), rabbit anti-TexasRed (1:500, Invitrogen, Life Technologies), Alexa Fluor 568 goat anti-rabbit (1:200, Life Technologies), Alexa Fluor 633 goat anti-rat (1:200, Life Technologies), and Alexa Fluor 633 goat anti-mouse (1:200, Life Technologies)."

This identified five clusters of MB extrinsic neuron cell bodies, each of which reproducibly contained more than two cells (n = 3 brains, data not shown, see <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Neurons found reproducibly, but not within these clusters, include MB-APL, MB-DPM, two MBONs located by the contralateral spur (MBON-\u03b34&gt;\u03b31\u03b32 and MBON-\u03b21&gt;\u03b1; MV2), and two MBONs located in the contralateral anterior lateral region (MBON-\u03b33 and MBON-\u03b33\u03b2\u20321). We examined the number of neurons in each of the five clusters except the anterior PAM cluster (see below) by comparing higher resolution images of areas containing each cluster taken before and after photoactivation. Two or three clusters were examined per sample, and a volume of \u223c200 \u03bcm \u00d7 \u223c200 \u03bcm \u00d7 \u223c100 \u03bcm was imaged at 0.39 \u03bcm \u00d7 0.39 \u03bcm \u00d7 1 \u03bcm resolution for each cluster.

Slight shifts in sample orientation precluded the use of a simple image calculation to identify photoactivated neurons. Instead, the photoactivated cell bodies were visually identified from aligned images assisted by a custom MATLAB interface. This analysis identified two neurons with their cell bodies located in regions that do not contain any of the neurons identified in the split-GAL4 lines. One was located ventral to the calyx (MBON-\u03b34\u03b35) and the other was located ventral lateral to the antennal lobe (MBON-\u03b31\u03b32) (see below, and <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

The photoactivation mask was generated using this red marker, and in some cases where the split-GAL4 driver labels two compartments, this was further restricted using basal fluorescence of PA-GFP in the \u03b1\u2032/\u03b2\u2032 KCs (for example, to demarcate the \u03b22 compartment using MBON-\u03b22\u03b2\u20322a, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Upon photoactivation, the brains were fixed and immunostained for tdTomato and tyrosine hydroxylase or dopa-decarboxylase as described above. The confocal images were processed by a custom MATLAB code to identify photoactivated cells. For each image, the fluorescent intensity of the photoactivated GFP signals was measured by drawing a region-of-interest around tdTomato positive neurons (i.e., neurons whose processes had been used as target for the photoactivation), and the green channel of the image was thresholded by a pixel intensity value representing mean minus 2\u00d7 standard deviations of all the pixels within the regions-of-interest. A cell was counted as photoactivated if most of the pixels within the cell, as determined visually, were over this threshold value. Finally, we determined whether these cells are dopaminergic by examining co-localization with tyrosine hydroxylase or dopa-decarboxylase. Photoactivation of each of the 15 compartments identified all the MBONs included in the split-GAL4 lines (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, and data not shown). We observed the same number of PA-GFP positive cell bodies for each MBON cell type as were labeled by the corresponding MBON split-GAL4 line (e.g., <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>) and therefore these experiments confirmed that the split-GAL4 lines label all neurons within each MBON type. For the MBONs with dendrites in \u03b1\u20321 and \u03b1\u20323 compartments and cell bodies near KC cell bodies, it was not possible to assess whether there are more neurons of these types, because the cell bodies of photoactivated \u03b1\u2032/\u03b2\u2032 KCs were not distinguishable from those of the MBONs."

Photoactivation was targeted to the medial lobes using the absence of basal PA-GFP fluorescence in the KCs to demarcate the MB lobes. Upon photoactivation, the brain was treated with collagenase (2 mg/ml, Sigma) for 30 s, the glial sheath removed using fine forceps, and the brain was mounted again in Sylgard-coated Petri dish in saline. A fire-polished, pulled glass pipette (0.5 mm ID, 1.0 mm OD, Sutter) was backfilled with a TexasRed dye (lysine-fixable 3000 MW, Invitrogen) dissolved in saline. A two-photon microscope was used to guide the pipette to the photoactivated cell body, and the dye was injected into the cell body by iontophoresis using over one hundred 3 ms pulses of 20 Vdc applied every 0.5 s. The dye was allowed to diffuse for an additional 10 min and then the brain was fixed and immunostained with anti-TexasRed antibody and nc82. Four brains were examined and in all cases we identified one neuron with the same morphology."

Our alignment strategy is outlined in <a href=\"#fig22\">Figure 22</a>. We imaged each brain twice: the entire brain at low-resolution (20\u00d7 objective lens; voxel size, 0.56 \u00d7 0.56 \u00d7 1.0 \u00b5m) and a confocal stack (or stacks) covering the region of interest at high-resolution (63\u00d7 objective lens; voxel size, 0.19 \u00d7 0.19 \u00d7 0.38 \u00b5m). The two images were scaled to have isotropic voxels; because the low-resolution images were obtained with an air objective, they were optically flattened compared to the high-resolution images and, thus, required scaling in the z-axis. We then aligned the high-resolution image tile to the low-resolution whole brain image, using the reference nc82 channel, by means of image stitching (<a href=\"#bib114\">Yu and Peng, 2011</a>), which obtains translations through searching the maximum normalized cross correlation using the fast Fourier transform (FFT). Then affine registration of the low-resolution whole brain image to the JFRC2013 standard brain was used to provide a global alignment of the partial brain image to the standard brain. Finally, a non-linear transformation was applied to locally register the high-resolution tile image to the JFRC2013 standard brain using a symmetric diffeomorphic registration algorithm (<a href=\"#bib6\">Avants et al., 2008</a>) with a combination of mutual information and normalized cross correlation as the similarity metric in the local alignment."

As far as I understand, most of these neurons are identified for the first time, at least to the resolution described, in this paper. So, the authors are in a position to name these neurons. I understand the rationales of the authors' choice using the connectivity with specific mushroom body lobes, and it may seem rational within this paper as it builds from Kenyon cell subtypes to MBONs. But even when reading the companion paper, only a slight distance away, it is already very difficult to remember these names (e.g., MBON-gamma4&gt;gamma1gamma2, MBON-beta'2mp_bilateral, MBON-gamm1pedc&gt;alpha/beta, etc.) or the rationale behind without constantly checking this paper. Consider many papers that will follow this paper in many years to come! Often complex names can turn off young scientists wishing to enter an otherwise very exciting field. In my view, these names should be greatly simplified. I have a specific suggestion. Since the authors found that MBONs neatly fall within three neurotransmitter phenotypes, and that MBONs that belong to a particular neurotransmitter category intersect with specific MB lobes at specific locations (both very interesting new findings!), why not name the MBONs after neurotransmitters (which is one of the most used convention for classifying neurons), and then within a neurotransmitter category, give a number, perhaps based on the proximal-distal axis of the mushroom body axons (e.g., MBON-ACh1, ACh2...; GABA1, GABA2...; Glu1, Glu2...). An alternative is to use consecutive numbers, for instance, MBON-ACh1-ACh8, GABA9-GABA12, GLU13-19, etc. With a modified <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>, readers can quickly check which lobe MBON-GABA3 receives input from, etc. The authors may also consider renaming the DANs but this may have more historical constraint and DANs don't neatly match MBONs.

Most major claims, except one which can be easily addressed (see below), are supported by thorough and convincing evidence.

The authors stated that \"The five KC types that receive olfactory information are each represented by hundreds of neurons per hemisphere and have their dendrites in the main calyx. Although their axons project to spatially segregated layers in the lobes, their dendritic arbors are intermingled in the calyx and KCs within a given cell type exhibit variable dendritic projection patterns (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figures 6 and 7</a>). Moreover, the KCs receive input from an apparently random collection of glomeruli (<a href=\"#bib67\">Murthy et al., 2008</a>, <a href=\"#bib33\">Gruntman and Turner, 2013</a>, <a href=\"#bib18\">Caron et al., 2013</a>)\". The statement is vague and implies a random spatial distribution of KC dendrites in the main calyx. In fact, the main calyx is clearly subdivided into 4 paralleled divisions, each derived from dendrites of descendent neurons of one of the four neuroblasts (Technau and Heisenberg, 1982; <a href=\"#bib41\">Ito et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Lee et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib115\">Zhu et al., 2003</a>, 2006; <a href=\"#bib56\">Lin et al., 2007</a>). Within each division, dendritic arbors of each KC type segregate at specific and separate spatial domain (<a href=\"#bib56\">Lin et al., 2007</a>). Authors agree with that the pioneer alpha/beta (the posterior alpha/beta) KCs have dendrites exclusively in the dorsal accessory calyx and show that the newly identified embryonic gamma KCs have dendrites exclusively in the ventral accessory calyx. Consistently, in the main calyx, dendritic arbors of 5 other KC types also appear to distribute differently from each other (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figures 6 and 7</a>). It remains unclear how the segregated KC dendrites account for the random PN-KC connections. Authors should either clarify their statement and cite the previous report indicating segregated dendrite distribution of each KC type in the main calyx or provide additional evidences of detailed anatomical analysis if otherwise."

Using state-of-art genetic tools, authors identified a comprehensive list of single neurons comprising the mushroom body and constructed a map of potential neural connections dividing MB lobes into 15 functional compartments. Moreover, they generated 85 split-GAL4 lines expressing exclusively in few MB related neurons that allow genetic manipulation of specific target neurons. Most major claims, except one which can be easily addressed (see below), are supported by thorough and convincing evidence. The study has great impact to the field and will transform the way of future study for understanding how genes and circuits control complex insect behaviors. I support the publication of the study and urge the authors make the generated tools immediately available to the entire field to further accelerate our understanding of brain functions</i>."

The authors stated that \"The five KC types that receive olfactory information are each represented by hundreds of neurons per hemisphere and have their dendrites in the main calyx. Although their axons project to spatially segregated layers in the lobes, their dendritic arbors are intermingled in the calyx and KCs within a given cell type exhibit variable dendritic projection patterns (</i><a href=\"#fig6\"><i>Figures 6 and 7</i></a><i>). Moreover, the KCs receive input from an apparently random collection of glomeruli (</i><a href=\"#bib67\"><i>Murthy et al., 2008</i></a><i>,</i> <a href=\"#bib33\"><i>Gruntman and Turner, 2013</i></a><i>,</i> <a href=\"#bib18\"><i>Caron et al., 2013</i></a><i>)\". The statement is vague and implies a random spatial distribution of KC dendrites in the main calyx. In fact, the main calyx is clearly subdivided into 4 paralleled divisions, each derived from dendrites of descendent neurons of one of the four neuroblasts (Technau and Heisenberg, 1982;</i> <a href=\"#bib41\"><i>Ito et al., 1997</i></a><i>;</i> <a href=\"#bib53\"><i>Lee et al., 1999</i></a><i>;</i> <a href=\"#bib115\"><i>Zhu et al., 2003</i></a><i>,</i> <i>2006</i><i>;</i> <a href=\"#bib56\"><i>Lin et al., 2007</i></a><i>). Within each division, dendritic arbors of each KC type segregate at specific and separate spatial domain (</i><a href=\"#bib56\"><i>Lin et al., 2007</i></a><i>). Authors agree with that the pioneer alpha/beta (the posterior alpha/beta) KCs have dendrites exclusively in the dorsal accessory calyx and show that the newly identified embryonic gamma KCs have dendrites exclusively in the ventral accessory calyx. Consistently, in the main calyx, dendritic arbors of 5 other KC types also appear to distribute differently from each other (</i><a href=\"#fig6\"><i>Figures 6 and 7</i></a><i>). It remains unclear how the segregated KC dendrites account for the random PN-KC connections. Authors should either clarify their statement and cite the previous report indicating segregated dendrite distribution of each KC type in the main calyx or provide additional evidences of detailed anatomical analysis if otherwise</i>."
