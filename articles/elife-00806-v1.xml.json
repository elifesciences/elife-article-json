Understanding how these different responses are regulated is a central question for developmental biology. In this study, we used mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC) differentiation to uncover a new mechanism for PI3K signalling that is required for endoderm specification. We found that PI3K signalling promotes the transition from na\u00efve endoderm precursors into committed anterior endoderm. PI3K promoted commitment via an atypical activity that delimited epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Akt1 transduced this activity via modifications to the extracellular matrix (ECM) and appropriate ECM could itself induce anterior endodermal identity in the absence of PI3K signalling. PI3K/Akt1-modified ECM contained low levels of Fibronectin (Fn1) and we found that Fn1 dose was key to specifying anterior endodermal identity in vivo and in vitro. Thus, localized PI3K activity affects ECM composition and ECM in turn patterns the endoderm."

Understanding how these different responses are regulated is a central question for developmental biology. In this study, we used mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC) differentiation to uncover a new mechanism for PI3K signalling that is required for endoderm specification. We found that PI3K signalling promotes the transition from na\u00efve endoderm precursors into committed anterior endoderm. PI3K promoted commitment via an atypical activity that delimited epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Akt1 transduced this activity via modifications to the extracellular matrix (ECM) and appropriate ECM could itself induce anterior endodermal identity in the absence of PI3K signalling. PI3K/Akt1-modified ECM contained low levels of Fibronectin (Fn1) and we found that Fn1 dose was key to specifying anterior endodermal identity in vivo and in vitro. Thus, localized PI3K activity affects ECM composition and ECM in turn patterns the endoderm."

It involves the activity of a number of conserved signal transduction pathways. However, the complex set of morphological rearrangements that occur during gastrulation make it difficult to uncouple the role of specific signals in mediating cell migration from those acting directly on cell specification (<a href=\"#bib44\">Villegas et al., 2010</a>). Embryonic stem cell (ESC) differentiation offers a tractable in vitro model, which can be used to complement the analysis of embryos. ESCs are karyotypically normal, self-renewing and pluripotent cell lines derived from the mammalian blastocyst that can be driven to differentiate toward all the three germ layers. Adherent ESC differentiation models, therefore, allow direct access to mechanisms regulating cell fate decisions in a stable defined environment. The inductive activity of specific signalling pathways can be tested on isolated progenitor populations, allowing the deciphering of specific target cells and paracrine interactions (<a href=\"#bib33\">Murry and Keller, 2008</a>)."

Endoderm progenitors will give rise to the entire digestive track in addition to thymus, thyroid, liver, pancreas, lungs, gallbladder as well as the extra-embryonic component of the visceral yolk sac. Therefore, understanding the basis for endoderm induction is the first step in attempting directed differentiation to organ cell types. In mammals, endoderm induction occurs in two waves. The first occurs at implantation and leads to the formation of the extra-embryonic visceral endoderm and the second occurs during gastrulation. During gastrulation, the precursors of the definitive endoderm emerge from the anterior region of a transient embryonic processing centre known as the primitive streak (PS) (<a href=\"#bib50\">Zorn and Wells, 2009</a>). These precursors will either push away, or intercalate into, the visceral endoderm that surrounds the embryo proper (<a href=\"#bib22\">Kwon et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Burtscher and Lickert, 2009</a>). The first endoderm to emerge from the PS region is the anterior definitive endoderm (ADE) or prospective foregut. These cells move forward along the midline of the embryo to convey anterior information to the emerging neural axis and eventually give rise to the liver, pancreas and other derivatives of the foregut (<a href=\"#bib50\">Zorn and Wells, 2009</a>). ADE induction is dependent on a network of specific transcription factors downstream of Wnt and high levels of Nodal related TGF-beta signalling. However, as this emerging endodermal signalling centre moves forward during gastrulation, it starts to express antagonists of both these signals, protecting the anterior neural ectoderm from the mesoderm inducing properties of these pathways (<a href=\"#bib42\">Tam and Loebel, 2007</a>)."

FGF signalling is also required to induce the morphological rearrangements that are normally associated with gastrulation and endoderm migration (<a href=\"#bib46\">Yamaguchi et al., 1994</a>), including the induction of an epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) that enables the beginning of cell migration. EMT and cell migration are also regulated by the substrate upon which cells adhere, the extra-cellular matrix (ECM) (<a href=\"#bib15\">Hynes, 2009</a>). For example, PS formation can be inhibited on the anterior side of the embryo as a consequence of the visceral endoderm depositing ECM components that block cell migration (<a href=\"#bib7\">Egea et al., 2008</a>) and FGF signalling has been linked to visceral endoderm-dependent deposition of basement membrane components in ESC differentiation (<a href=\"#bib44\">Villegas et al., 2010</a>). However, while these studies link FGF signalling to ECM composition and cell migration, they do not address how ECM could be involved in patterning the embryonic axis or induction of specific cell types during ESC differentiation."

We uncoupled the signalling downstream of the FGF receptor using an in vitro mESC based model for endoderm induction. We found that endodermal patterning by FGF was dependent on a PI3K/Akt1 activity that temporally restricts EMT. This unexpected PI3K/Akt1 activity, which we show is required both in vivo and in vitro, is transduced via a modification to ECM composition, which in itself, promotes cell type specification. Using liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry (LC-MS), we further identified ECM components and found that Fibronectin (Fn1) levels were an essential determinant of the ECM-dependent endoderm patterning activity. Taken together, our findings link anterior-posterior (A\u2013P) patterning of the endoderm to EMT and uncover a novel ECM-based mechanism for the activity of PI3K/Akt1 signalling during germ layer specification."

Differentiation conditions are shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> and the medium used is defined in \u2018Materials and methods\u2019 section. We used BMP4 together with modest doses of the Nodal-like TGF-beta Activin A, to promote the differentiation of mESCs to epiblast-like cells, followed by the further differentiation of epiblast towards PS and endoderm in the presence of FGF and Activin A. Through the use of this staged differentiation protocol we have been able to generate committed ADE from ESCs more efficiently (<a href=\"#bib31\">Morrison et al., 2008</a>). We monitored the formation of ADE, anterior primitive streak (APS) and endoderm in general, using either single or combinatorial fluorescent reporter ESC lines generated by gene targeting. These included the fluorescent reporter gene RedStar under the transcriptional control of the early anterior endoderm marker <i>Hhex</i> (HRS) (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>) and a GFP under the control of the <i>Goosecoid</i> (<i>Gsc</i>) locus, a marker of PS and APS (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). For additional resolution of ESC differentiation to endoderm we used the cell surface marker, Cxcr4 (<a href=\"#bib31\">Morrison et al., 2008</a>). ADE was identified as either double positive for Hhex and Cxcr4 (H<sup>+</sup>C<sup>+</sup>) or Hhex and Gsc (H<sup>+</sup>Gsc<sup>+</sup>). Differentiation of these reporter lines was assessed by quantitative RT-PCR (q-RT-PCR) (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>), which confirmed that these cells pass through the in vitro equivalents of specific developmental stages, including PS, APS (or mesendoderm), and ADE, thereby recapitulating in vivo development. Based on these data, we designated the specification phase leading up to PS specification as phase 1 and the stage of subsequent mesoderm and endoderm segregation as phase 2 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). The transition between phase 1 and 2 is marked by the appearance of Gsc-GFP cells during day 3.0\u20133.5 of ESC differentiation."

Thus, all these kinases were required broadly for ESC differentiation towards mesoderm and endoderm, but only PI3K appeared specific to the transition between mesendoderm and committed ADE. To confirm that these signalling requirements were specific to phase 2, we also examined the effects of these inhibitors in phase 1. Inhibition of either JNK or PI3K was highly toxic, leading to extensive cell death, even at low concentrations (<a href=\"#SD4-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>).

Thus, the induction of ADE was dependent on the action of PI3K early during phase 2. During this phase of differentiation two populations of Gsc-GFP expressing cells (Gsc<sup>low</sup> and Gsc<sup>high</sup>) become apparent. We found that Hhex<sup>+</sup> ADE cells were always Gsc<sup>high</sup> suggesting they arose specifically from the earlier Gsc<sup>high</sup>Hhex<sup>\u2212</sup> population. We also found that this Gsc<sup>high</sup> population was diminished in the presence of LY while the Gsc<sup>low</sup> population was considerably expanded (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). Thus, PI3K was required in early PS precursors to generate Gsc<sup>high</sup> cells that can later give rise to Hhex<sup>+</sup> ADE. When LY-treated cells were released from the PI3K block and cultured for an additional 3 days in phase 2 differentiation conditions, we observed a complete recovery of Hhex induction, suggesting that in the absence of PI3K cells fail to progress in differentiation, but they were maintained in a less differentiated endodermal na\u00efve state (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). To better characterize this LY-dependent na\u00efve state we assessed a panel of markers by q-RT-PCR and IC. Alongside the high levels of endodermal markers previously observed (<i>Sox17, Foxa2</i>) in LY-treated cultures, they also showed expression of early primitive streak markers such as <i>Mixl1</i> and <i>Cdh2</i>, but not mesodermal specific gene expression (<i>Meox1, Meox2, Mesp1, Mesp2, Isl1, Gata1</i>) (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C</a> and data not shown). While these cultures expressed high level of PS gene expression, this appears to be predominantly endoderm as 90% of the Gsc<sup>+</sup> cells in these LY-treated cultures co-expressed Sox17 (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1D,E</a>). These cells also do not up-regulate the expression of posterior (<i>Cdx2</i>), or visceral (<i>Hnf4a, Dab2</i>) endoderm markers.

While ADE cells progressed efficiently into both lineages, LY-treated cells failed to differentiate efficiently (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1F</a>). However, when LY-treated na\u00efve cells were returned to normal differentiation for 3 days prior to subjecting them to hepatocyte differentiation, they performed as normal Hhex positive ADE cultures, efficiently generating Hnf4a/AFP positive hepatocyte progenitors (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Endodermal cultures were also subjected to intestinal differentiation (<a href=\"#bib38\">Spence et al., 2011</a>), but we were unable to generate intestinal spheres from either ADE or LY-treated cells (data not shown). This may indicate that specific posterior pre-patterning of na\u00efve endoderm is required. Taken together, these experiments suggest that the cells produced by PI3K/Akt1 inhibition are non-regionalized endoderm (na\u00efve) that retains the ability to give rise to specific endodermal domains when returned to normal differentiation."

                                "text": "To identify the factors downstream of pAkt1 that mediate non-autonomous ADE induction, we tested the ability of supernatants produced during normal differentiation to rescue ADE generation in LY-treated cultures, but failed to observe any effect (data not shown), suggesting that these factors might not readily diffuse. We therefore tested the hypothesis that the ADE inducing activity downstream of Akt1 might be the result of specific Akt1-dependent ECM proteins. We reasoned that if the role of Akt1 in anterior patterning is conducted by the production of a specific ECM, then if we expose differentiating cells to the action of an ECM generated under normal conditions, pAkt1 would no longer be necessary for ADE induction. To do so, we prepared ECM from untreated differentiating ESC cultures (ECM1) or from cultures treated with LY (ECM2). These ECM preparations were then tested for their ability to induce or rescue endoderm differentiation in the presence of LY (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). HRS-Gsc-GFP cells were differentiated to the APS GFP<sup>+</sup> stage (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), collected, re-plated onto the different matrices or gelatine (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>) and differentiated in the presence or absence of LY. <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a> shows that ECM1, but not ECM2, could support ADE differentiation in the presence of LY. Moreover, ECM1 not only restored anterior induction, but the combination of LY and ECM1 enhanced anterior endoderm specification, such that these cultures were almost 60% ADE (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). These data suggest that the capacity of LY to enhance Sox17<sup>+</sup>Foxa2<sup>+</sup> expression was harnessed by ECM1, which was able to convert the Sox17<sup>+</sup>Foxa2<sup>+</sup> na\u00efve population into Hhex<sup>+</sup> prospective foregut (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Cells plated on ECM1 in the presence of LY displayed epithelial morphology, enhanced E-cadherin and reduced Snai1 expression (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). While treatment of differentiating cultures with LY resulted in a loss of expression of the tight junction and polarity markers, ZO-1 and aPKC, organized expression of these was restored within 12 hr of plating onto ECM1 (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Cells plated on ECM2 in the presence of LY did not generate ADE or form an organized epithelium (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). To exclude the possibility that Akt1 activation was somehow stimulated by re-plating on these ECMs, despite the block to PI3K signalling, we assessed Akt1 activation after re-plating and observed no rescue of the LY-mediated block to Akt1 phosphorylation (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). Thus, ECM1 has the capacity to redirect the LY-mediated enhancement of <i>Sox17/Foxa2</i> expression through an Akt1 independent pathway and convert the majority of the culture to properly patterned anterior endoderm. These data suggest that ECM1 together with LY could be used to enhance physiological ESC differentiation toward foregut (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>, middle panel)."

To provide a better picture of PI3K/Akt1-dependent changes in the ECM that might be induced by post translational modification, we used mass spectrometry coupled to liquid chromatography (LC-MS) to define PI3K-dependent differences between ECM1 and ECM2. Details of ECM extraction and LC-MS methodologies can be found in \u2018Material and methods.\u2019 Specific proteins enriched in ECM1 include two heparan sulphates proteoglycans (HSPG), Perlecan and Col18a1; two HSPG regulators Sulf1 and Cyr61; the metalloprotease Adamts15, the anterior endoderm associated diffusible factors Nodal and Lefty1; and the endoderm/epithelial associated cytokeratines Krt8, Krt18 and Krt19 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>, <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 7\u2014source data 2,3</a>). While a number of these proteins are not canonical matrix proteins, they are generally associated with integrin signalling and tight junction formation. Interestingly, Fibronectin (Fn1), a promoter of EMT and migration, was highly enriched in ECM2 as was the PS associated diffusible factor Fgf8 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>, <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 7\u2014source data 2,3</a>). Analysis by q-RT-PCR confirmed that <i>Fn1</i> expression was transcriptionally regulated by PI3K/Akt1 signalling (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>), and that the induction of <i>Fn1</i> expression was a cell autonomous response to Akt1 activation (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Moreover, the addition of Fn1 to differentiating ESC cultures, either through re-plating of PS stage cultures onto Fn1-coated dishes (data not shown) or through direct addition to phase 2 differentiation (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>) abolished the induction of ADE specific transcription. As Fn1 is known to signal through Akt1 (<a href=\"#bib18\">Khwaja et al., 1997</a>), and Akt1 is involved in ADE specification, we asked whether exogenous Fn1 resulted in Akt1 activation during normal endoderm differentiation. <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a> shows that Fn1 did not stimulate Akt1 phosphorylation, but it actually inhibited it (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>)."

We therefore assessed the requirement of Fn1 during endoderm specification by examining the endoderm of embryos homozygous for a null mutation in the <i>Fn1</i> locus (<i>Fn1</i><sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup>) (<a href=\"#bib9\">George et al., 1993</a>). In <i>Fn1</i><sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> embryos, the domain of Cer1 expression was expanded toward the posterior-proximal side of the embryo within the domain of Foxa2 expression (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E</a>, <a href=\"#fig8s2\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 2A\u2013C</a>). We also assessed the protein expression of the pan-endoderm marker Sox17 and found that like Fn1, Sox17 was expressed at lower levels in the Cer1 positive foregut region.

Cells in PS region are in the process of generating mesoderm and endoderm (mesendoderm). At the anterior end of the PS, high levels of pAkt1 regulate proper epithelialization and anterior endoderm specification through the production of a unique ECM low in Fn1. Low levels of PI3K/Akt1 led to the production of an Fn1-enriched ECM that favours na\u00efve endoderm generation."

These cellular movements, the ECM that cells move on and the signals they are exposed to during their migration all contribute to the patterning of the embryonic endoderm (<a href=\"#bib1\">Arnold and Robertson, 2009</a>). The non-canonical ECM-dependent pathway downstream of PI3K described here provides an explanation for the diversity of cellular responses that can be achieved through the activation of pAkt1. PI3K/Akt1 signalling has been extensively associated with the induction of EMT (<a href=\"#bib23\">Larue and Bellacosa, 2005</a>) rather than its suppression. However, in the context described here, Akt1 modifies the ECM to drive cell\u2013cell contact and either induce or preserve epithelial identity. Thus, high levels of PI3K activity ensure that Fn1 levels remain low and that EMT is suppressed. The involvement of an ECM intermediate also provides context for an endoderm specific role for FGF signalling. FGF receptor activation is essential for ESC differentiation towards multiple lineages and leads to Grb2 and SHP2 recruitment, activating both PI3K and MAPK signalling pathways (<a href=\"#bib20\">Kouhara et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Xu et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Villegas et al., 2010</a>). These pathways have been associated with mesoderm induction, EMT and cell migration during gastrulation (<a href=\"#bib3\">Casey et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Rodaway et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Ciruna and Rossant, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Mizoguchi et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Poulain et al., 2006</a>). In endoderm, where FGF signalling is required, but does not induce EMT (<a href=\"#bib31\">Morrison et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Hansson et al., 2009</a>), the signalling is contextualized and rendered distinct as a result of the activity of this pathway in remodelling the ECM. PI3K activity in the visceral endoderm of embryoid body differentiation (<a href=\"#bib25\">Li et al., 2001</a>) has also been associated with the production of ECM required to support the epithelialization of the epiblast (<a href=\"#bib17\">Jeanes et al., 2009</a>)."

In this context, Akt1 activation supports human ESC self-renewal by inhibiting Raf/Mek/Erk and canonical Wnt signalling, which in turn may also promote EMT, although it is not clear whether this route takes place in vivo during early endoderm differentiation or how comparable the mouse and human ESC differentiation models are. Accordingly, the transient reduction in pAkt1 we observed at the beginning of differentiation may be coupled to early activation of the ERK and Wnt pathways as cells become prepared for mesoderm and endoderm induction. However, prior to the appearance of endoderm gene expression, differentiating ESCs contained high levels of pAkt1 and this appeared essential for the deposition of the correct, Fn1<sup>low</sup> regionalized ECM. That cells rapidly down-regulate Snai1 upon re-plating suggests that the ECM-dependent pathway described here allows rapid modifications to differentiation as cells become exposed to a new environment."

How do these elements impact on the key signalling events regulating lineage specification? Several elements of this matrisome are directly involved in Fn1 signalling and exogenous Fn1 can alter ECM activity. Genetic studies indicate that Fn1-integrin interactions are essential for axial extension of the mesendoderm (<a href=\"#bib47\">Yang et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Davidson et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Marsden and DeSimone, 2003</a>). However, Fn1 is not required for gastrulation and specific endodermal patterning defects have not been previously reported. The <i>Fn1</i> and <i>Itga5</i> null mutants are both embryonic lethal and die by E10.5 due to cardiovascular problems, posterior truncations, and kinking of the neural tube among others defects (<a href=\"#bib9\">George et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Yang et al., 1993</a>). We observed higher levels of Fn1 in the posterior region of gastrulation stage embryos and the region where the nascent foregut moves into was uniquely low in Fn1. In Fn1<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> embryos, the region of Cer1 positive ADE is expanded, suggesting that the deposition of Fn1 may help to restrict the prospective foregut domain as it migrates up from the distal end of the embryo. Consistent with this observation, the foregut did not fold into a tube and remained as a flat field of expanded Foxa2<sup>+</sup> cells in Fn1<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> embryos, indicating that the regulation of Fn1 deposition helps delineate and form the prospective foregut. We also observed a similar inverse correlation between the expression of Sox17 and Cer1, indicating that Sox17 is expressed at higher levels in Fn1 rich regions of the endoderm. This is consistent with our in vivo and in vitro data, which show significantly higher levels of Sox17 expression in na\u00efve endoderm that was generated in response to inhibition of PI3K."

Two out of the three main Heparan Sulphate-bearing species, Perlecan and Col18a1 (<a href=\"#bib11\">Halfter et al., 1998</a>) were expressed at high levels in ECM1. <i>Knock down</i> of these two HSPG\u2019s have been shown to impair endoderm differentiation in vitro (<a href=\"#bib14\">Higuchi et al., 2010</a>). Potentially, this HSPG-bearing ECM could be acting in conjunction with low levels of Fn1 to modulate growth factor bioavailability, and operate as a platform for cytokine signalling. As the cytokines we added exogenously to the cultures were not found in either ECMs, we think it is unlikely that this explains the full activity of these ECMs in vitro<i>.</i> However, we did find that ECM1 contained Nodal and Lefty1, whereas ECM2 contained Fgf8 (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>, <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 7\u2014source data 2,3</a>). It has been suggested that specific modifications in the ECM are required for Nodal transport within the embryo (<a href=\"#bib34\">Oki et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Marjoram and Wright, 2011</a>). Moreover, the inclusion of Nodal, Lefty1 and Fgf8 within these matrices fits with the locus of their extracellular activity in vivo. Our observation that these cytokines appear specifically embedded in the ECM suggests that the mechanism by which these proteins function in vivo involves association with ECM proteins (<a href=\"#bib15\">Hynes, 2009</a>)."

Part of the explanation for this lack of success may lie in the inability to pattern the correct intermediates. The observation that inhibition of PI3K leads to enhanced Sox17 and Foxa2 expression (<a href=\"#bib29\">McLean et al., 2007</a>) has been used in ESC differentiation protocols to generate endoderm derivatives. Our data suggest that these cells are less efficient in further differentiation to derivatives of the ventral foregut such as pancreatic or hepatic progenitors. Based on both molecular and functional analysis of these endoderm cells they appear to be na\u00efve endoderm, similar to the mesenchymal cell type that emerges from the primitive streak and intercalates into the visceral endoderm layer (<a href=\"#bib22\">Kwon et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Burtscher and Lickert, 2009</a>) to form the hindgut. These Sox17<sup>high</sup> mesenchyme-like cells that arise from the primitive streak region of the embryo exist only transiently in vivo, and while we show that prolonged and enhanced induction of this state in vitro may be reversed by reintroducing cells back into normal differentiation, the direct onward differentiation of these cells may have deleterious effects on their capacity to form functional cell types in vitro. Interestingly, while these cells become epithelialized as they intercalate in the visceral endoderm, their levels of Sox17 remain high throughout gastrulation, suggesting that a na\u00efve endoderm state could extend beyond the initial EMT event."

High dose (50 \u00b5M) was used as control (new <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2013figure supplement 1A\u2013D</a>). Interestingly, we found enhanced cell death in the Gsc negative population of undifferentiated cells at day 3, while enhanced cell death in differentiating Gsc positive populations was not detected. From day 4 onwards neither population was significantly affected. To test if the enhanced cell death observed at day 3 on Gsc negative cells had a role in the LY-induced block to anterior differentiation, we suppressed cell death by the addition of Z-VAD-FMK (10 \u00b5M), a specific Caspase inhibitor. However, Z-VAD-FMK failed to rescue the block to ADE specification generated by LY.
