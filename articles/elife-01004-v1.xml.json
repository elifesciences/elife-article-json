We identified a novel mode of communication by which apoptotic cells induce additional apoptosis in the same tissue. Strong induction of apoptosis in one compartment of the <i>Drosophila</i> wing disc causes apoptosis of cells in the other compartment, indicating that dying cells can release long-range death factors. We identified Eiger, the <i>Drosophila</i> tumor necrosis factor (TNF) homolog, as the signal responsible for apoptosis-induced apoptosis (AiA). Eiger is produced in apoptotic cells and, through activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway, is able to propagate the initial apoptotic stimulus. We also show that during coordinated cell death of hair follicle cells in mice, TNF-\u03b1 is expressed in apoptotic cells and is required for normal cell death. AiA provides a mechanism to explain cohort behavior of dying cells that is seen both in normal development and under pathological conditions."

                        "text": "Apoptosis is a distinct form of programmed cell death in which cells activate an intrinsic suicide program to self-destruct. This process plays a major role in development and tissue homeostasis, and abnormal regulation of apoptosis is associated with a variety of human diseases (<a href=\"#bib15\">Fuchs and Steller, 2011</a>). Dying cells can secrete signals that will stimulate the recruitment of phagocytes (find-me signals) as well as expose signals on their surface to facilitate their engulfment (eat-me signals) (<a href=\"#bib37\">Lauber et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Ravichandran, 2003</a>). However, apoptosis has been traditionally regarded as a silent process that does not affect surrounding tissues. Only more recently has it become clear that apoptotic cells are the source of signals that can have profound effects on their neighbors. Cells that undergo apoptosis in response to stress and injury can secrete mitogenic and morphogenetic signaling proteins to stimulate growth and tissue repair (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bergmann and Steller, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Morata et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Greco, 2013</a>). These factors include Wnt, Dpp/Bmps and Hedgehog (Hh) proteins, which all play major roles in the regulation of growth and patterning during development (<a href=\"#bib27\">Huh et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Perez-Garijo et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Ryoo et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Fan and Bergmann, 2008</a>). Mitogenic signaling by apoptotic cells has been reported for a diversity of animals, from <i>Hydra</i>, to flat worms, <i>Drosophila</i> and vertebrates, and it has been implicated in regeneration, wound healing and tumor growth (<a href=\"#bib72\">Tseng et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Chera et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bergmann and Steller, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Li et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Pellettieri et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Huang et al., 2011</a>). This mechanism appears well suited to communicate cellular loss to stem and progenitor cells in the tissue environment to stimulate proliferation and tissue repair. On the other hand, large groups of cells often undergo coordinated death during development and under conditions of severe tissue injury (<a href=\"#bib18\">Glucksmann, 1951</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Jacobson et al., 1997</a>). Classic examples for such group suicide behavior in normal development include the elimination of the tadpod tail during amphibian metamorphosis, and the removal of interdigital membranes during digit individualization in vertebrates. In <i>Drosophila</i>, apoptosis plays a crucial role in several morphogenetic events, sculpting tissues and organs, removing a large number of cells in a coordinated manner and inducing cellular reorganization (<a href=\"#bib41\">Lohmann et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Link et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Manjon et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Suzanne et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Suzanne and Steller, 2013</a>). In vertebrates, another example of communal death is the regressive phase of the hair follicle (HF), which undergoes cycles of growth (anagen), degeneration (catagen) and rest (telogen) (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hardy, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Fuchs, 2007</a>). In catagen, all the cells in the lower portion of the HF are eliminated by apoptosis (<a href=\"#bib39\">Lindner et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Botchkareva et al., 2006</a>). In all these cases, cell death takes place in a very rapid and highly synchronized manner. However, it is not known how this cohort behavior is achieved. Likewise, many pathological states are associated with extensive cell death, which leads to severe damage and can have grave consequences for patients. Examples include alcohol-/drug-induced liver failure, viral infection, cardiac infarction, ischemic stroke and cachexia (<a href=\"#bib65\">Sharma and Anker, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Kang and Izumo, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Guicciardi and Gores, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Yuan, 2009</a>). In all these pathologies, apoptosis accounts for widespread cell loss and is thought to contribute to patient mortality (<a href=\"#bib70\">Thompson, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Favaloro et al., 2012</a>). One possible explanation for all these \u2018mass suicide\u2019 phenomena is that apoptotic cells may release signals to coordinate their \u2018communal death\u2019."

We observed that massive induction of apoptosis in the posterior compartment of <i>Drosophila</i> wing discs caused non-autonomous apoptosis at a considerable distance in the anterior compartment. Moreover, apoptosis of cells in the anterior compartment requires signaling from apoptotic cells in the posterior compartment, indicating that apoptosis-induced-apoptosis (AiA) is an active phenomenon. We next explored the mechanism underlying AiA and found that apoptotic cells produce Eiger, the TNF homolog in <i>Drosophila</i>. Eiger activates the JNK pathway in neighboring cells and induces them to die. Finally, we examined whether AiA also occurs in vertebrates and whether it plays a physiological role for the coordinated death of groups of cells. We found that during the regressive phase (catagen) of the HF, apoptotic cells produce TNF-\u03b1. Inhibition of TNF-\u03b1 disrupts the coordinated death of HF cells in catagen, indicating that this mechanism plays a physiological role to maintain synchronicity in the HF cycle. Taken together, these observations reveal a novel mechanism to coordinate cohort behavior of dying cells that is seen both in normal development and under pathological conditions."

Under these conditions, cells initiate the apoptotic cascade but cannot execute cell death because the activity of effector caspases is blocked. Although apoptotic cells are normally very rapidly cleared in living tissues, undead cells persist for long times and thereby permit analysis of signaling events associated with the induction of apoptosis. We used the Gal4/UAS system for transgene expression of the pro-apoptotic gene <i>hid</i> and the caspase inhibitor <i>p35</i> in the posterior compartment of wing imaginal discs (<a href=\"#bib8\">Brand and Perrimon, 1993</a>). As expected, we observed ectopic Wg expression and discs with abnormal and in many cases overgrown posterior compartments due to increased cell proliferation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). Undead cells contain high levels of cleaved caspases and were visualized by staining with activated caspase-3 antibody, which recognizes cleaved effector caspases as well as the activity of the initiator caspase Dronc (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib12\">Fan and Bergmann, 2010</a>). Surprisingly, we also observed large numbers of apoptotic cells in the anterior compartment (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Under these conditions, we typically saw two large clusters of dying cells in the wing pouch. It appears that cells in this region of the wing disc are more susceptible to apoptosis, as indicated by the fact that higher rates of cell death within this region were also observed after X-irradiation and <i>hid</i> over-expression (<a href=\"#bib48\">Milan et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Moon et al., 2005</a>). Interestingly, caspase-3 staining of apoptotic cells in the anterior compartment differed significantly from that seen in undead cells. Although active caspase-3 immunoreactivity was cytoplasmatic and diffuse in undead cells, the staining of cells in the anterior compartment was punctate and intense, indicating that these cells are dying (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). To confirm this idea, we performed TUNEL labeling (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). As expected, undead cells in the posterior compartment did not show TUNEL staining, but caspase-3-positive cells in the anterior compartment also displayed distinct TUNEL labeling (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). These findings indicate that undead cells in the posterior compartment of the <i>Drosophila</i> wing disc have the ability to stimulate the induction of apoptosis at a distance in a different compartment."

To investigate this possibility, we manipulated the size of the posterior compartment by downregulation of dMyc. dMyc is a key regulator of tissue growth, and downregulation of dMyc leads to a reduction of cell and tissue size (<a href=\"#bib31\">Johnston et al., 1999</a>). We reasoned that if non-autonomous apoptosis is the consequence of the increased size of the posterior compartment, then this phenomenon should not take place under conditions where the size of the posterior compartment is normal or reduced. Therefore, we generated posterior compartments that express <i>hid</i> and <i>p35</i> together with dMyc RNAi. Under these conditions, we still observed undead cells, as revealed by cleaved caspase-3 staining, in a compartment with significantly reduced size (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Importantly, despite the size reduction, we still saw large numbers of apoptotic cells in the anterior compartment (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). These observations argue strongly against the idea that size compensation causes non-autonomous cell death in this system."

To gain insight into the underlying molecular mechanism, we considered a role of the JNK pathway since it is activated during stress-induced apoptosis in <i>Drosophila</i> and plays a role for the induction of Dpp and Wg in apoptotic cells (<a href=\"#bib64\">Ryoo et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Perez-Garijo et al., 2009</a>). For this purpose, we first examined the pattern of JNK activation by generating undead cells in the posterior compartment and used a <i>puckered</i>-<i>lacZ</i> construct to monitor JNK activity. <i>puckered</i> (<i>puc</i>), the sole <i>Drosophila</i> JNK-specific MAPK phosphatase, is a feedback antagonist of the JNK pathway (<a href=\"#bib45\">Martin-Blanco et al., 1998</a>). Hence, the <i>puc-lacZ</i> line, which is an insertion in the <i>puckered</i> gene (<i>puc</i><sup><i>E69</i></sup>), serves both as a mutant for <i>puckered</i> and as a read-out for JNK activity. As expected, we saw very high <i>puc-lacZ</i> staining in undead cells, where the apoptotic loop keeps JNK constantly activated (<a href=\"#bib66\">Shlevkov and Morata, 2012</a>). However, we also observed modest activation of JNK in dying cells in the anterior compartment (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Sometimes we also saw a trail of puc-lacZ activity between undead cells and dying cells. We also investigated the effect of increasing the activity of the JNK pathway using the above-mentioned mutant background for <i>puckered</i> (<i>puc</i><sup><i>E69</i></sup>). Normally, the generation of undead cells in the posterior compartment for 72 hr causes only a modest induction of apoptosis in the anterior compartment (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). However, in a <i>puc</i><sup><i>+/\u2212</i></sup> background, the amount of apoptosis in the anterior compartment was dramatically increased (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>).

The mouse hair follicle (HF) is an ideal system for investigating AiA since cohort cell death naturally occurs at precise times in the HF cycle (<a href=\"#bib39\">Lindner et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Botchkareva et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Tong and Coulombe, 2006</a>). The HF cycles between phases of growth (anagen), destruction (catagen) and rest (telogen) (<a href=\"#bib22\">Hardy, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Fuchs, 2007</a>). During catagen, apoptosis leads to degeneration of the lower two-thirds of the HF while the upper part remains intact (<a href=\"#bib39\">Lindner et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Tong and Coulombe, 2006</a>) (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>). This portion encompasses the bulge, which houses the HF stem cells required for the generation of the new HF (<a href=\"#bib62\">Rompolas et al., 2012</a>). The first catagen phase commences at postnatal day 16 (P16) and hence we isolated skin at this time point. At P16, we could easily detect HFs with a large number of apoptotic cells. These cells displayed apoptotic morphology such as membrane blebbing, condensed nuclei and were positive for cleaved capase-3 (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>). It was previously shown that the HF cycle is dependent upon TNF signaling (<a href=\"#bib25\">Hoffmann et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Ruckert et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Tong and Coulombe, 2006</a>), but the cellular source of TNF-\u03b1 has not been determined.

We examined TNF-\u03b1 expression and found that apoptotic cells in the HF expressed high levels of TNF-\u03b1 (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>). Significantly, TNF-\u03b1 was not detected at any other location besides apoptotic cells. These results are consistent with the idea that apoptotic cells are the source of pro-death signals during catagen and that AiA contributes to the destruction of the HF."

Instead, apoptotic cells have the capacity to produce proliferative signals, such as Wg and Dpp, thus serving as a crucial driving force in wound healing, regeneration and tumor formation in a variety of different organisms (<a href=\"#bib27\">Huh et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Perez-Garijo et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Ryoo et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Chera et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Li et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Pellettieri et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Huang et al., 2011</a>). Here, we demonstrate that signaling by apoptotic cells is not limited to the production of proliferative signals: dying cells can generate pro-apoptotic signals that induce apoptosis in neighboring cells. We show that the induction of this apoptosis is triggered by Eiger, the ortholog of TNF in <i>Drosophila</i>, which in turn activates the JNK pathway and leads to cell death in a non-autonomous manner. Furthermore, we were able to provide evidence for the existence of AiA under physiological conditions in mice. We found that during catagen, the regressive phase of the hair cycle, apoptotic cells in the lower and transient portion of the HF also express TNF-\u03b1. Significantly, TNF-\u03b1 is required for coordinated cell death in the HF.

In fact, it has been shown that cells neighboring apoptotic cells downregulate Hippo pathway and consequently activate Diap1 (<a href=\"#bib20\">Grusche et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Sun and Irvine, 2011</a>).

Eiger is produced by apoptotic cells in the posterior compartment of the wing disc and it activates JNK in cells of the neighboring compartment, inducing them to die. Downregulation of Eiger in the posterior compartment or JNK in the anterior compartment was able to suppress AiA. However, it remains to be elucidated whether Eiger directly diffuses to the cells in the anterior compartment, or if some other mechanism is responsible for the activation of JNK in dying cells in the anterior compartment. Recently, it was shown that, upon wounding, JNK activity can be propagated at a distance through a feed-forward loop (<a href=\"#bib75\">Wu et al., 2010</a>). Significantly, AiA is not restricted to the <i>Drosophila</i> wing disc. We obtained evidence for a role of TNF-\u03b1-mediated AiA during the destruction of the hair follicle (HF) in catagen, the regressive phase of the hair cycle (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>). TNF-\u03b1 plays a known role to promote cell death and has been previously implicated in HF progression, wound healing and regeneration (<a href=\"#bib74\">Werner and Grose, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Tong and Coulombe, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bohm et al., 2010</a>).

There are many other examples of cell death being used during development to sculpt tissues and organs, including the removal of structures during metamorphosis (tadpole tail, larval organs in insects, elimination of inappropriate sex organs in mammals, deletion of the amnio serosa during insect embryogenesis) and the separation of digits through apoptosis of the interdigital webbing in many vertebrates (<a href=\"#bib18\">Glucksmann, 1951</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Jacobson et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Fuchs and Steller, 2011</a>). In all these cases, AiA may facilitate cohort behavior and contribute to the rapid and complete elimination of large fields of cells."

It is known that cells respond to viral infection by entering apoptosis and in this way impede the replication of the virus (<a href=\"#bib4\">Barber, 2001</a>).

It is known that radiotherapy in humans can induce biological effects in non-irradiated cells at a considerable distance, a phenomenon called radiation-induced bystander effect (<a href=\"#bib24\">Hei et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Prise and O\u2019Sullivan, 2009</a>). Our current findings provide a possible explanation for some of these effects. Therefore, large-scale induction of apoptosis by AiA may contribute to successful cancer therapy. TNF family proteins are being used as models for drug development aimed to treat cancer (<a href=\"#bib3\">Ashkenazi, 2008</a>). Furthermore, Eiger, the only TNF member in <i>Drosophila</i>, has a known role in the elimination of pre-tumoral <i>scrib</i><sup>\u2212</sup> clones (<a href=\"#bib29\">Igaki et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Ohsawa et al., 2011</a>). In addition, cell competition induces cell death even in aggressive <i>scrib</i><sup>\u2212</sup><i>Ras</i><sup>V12</sup> tumors, raising the possibility that AiA is induced during tumor initiation, which may affect the tumor microenvironment and ultimately tumor growth (<a href=\"#bib47\">Menendez et al., 2010</a>). It is well known that TNF can play both tumor-promoting and tumor-suppressing roles, but AiA has not been investigated in this context (<a href=\"#bib57\">Pikarsky and Ben-Neriah, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Vainer et al., 2008</a>). Future studies will shed new light on the relevance of signaling by apoptotic cells and the implications of this signaling mechanism in different scenarios."

The Psc-QF&gt;QUAS-<i>rpr/hid</i>; Ci-Gal4&gt;UAS-QS flies are lethal, and it is not possible to temporally control the expression of rpr/hid since the QS inhibitor is used for spatial control. Nevertheless, evidence for non-leakiness under these conditions is provided in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>. Here we use posterior compartment markers (GFP and <i>hh-lacZ</i>) to show that anterior dying cells clearly lack these marks."
