                    "text": "The postnatal neurodevelopmental disorder Rett syndrome, caused by mutations in <i>MECP2</i>, produces a diverse array of symptoms, including loss of language, motor, and social skills and the development of hand stereotypies, anxiety, tremor, ataxia, respiratory dysrhythmias, and seizures. Surprisingly, despite the diversity of these features, we have found that deleting <i>Mecp2</i> only from GABAergic inhibitory neurons in mice replicates most of this phenotype. Here we show that genetically restoring <i>Mecp2</i> expression only in GABAergic neurons of male <i>Mecp2</i> null mice enhanced inhibitory signaling, extended lifespan, and rescued ataxia, apraxia, and social abnormalities but did not rescue tremor or anxiety. Female <i>Mecp2</i><sup>+/-</sup> mice showed a less dramatic but still substantial rescue. These findings highlight the critical regulatory role of GABAergic neurons in certain behaviors and suggest that modulating the excitatory/inhibitory balance through GABAergic neurons could prove a viable therapeutic option in Rett syndrome."

Surprisingly, despite the diversity of these features, we have found that deleting <i>Mecp2</i> only from GABAergic inhibitory neurons in mice replicates most of this phenotype. Here we show that genetically restoring <i>Mecp2</i> expression only in GABAergic neurons of male <i>Mecp2</i> null mice enhanced inhibitory signaling, extended lifespan, and rescued ataxia, apraxia, and social abnormalities but did not rescue tremor or anxiety. Female <i>Mecp2</i><sup>+/-</sup> mice showed a less dramatic but still substantial rescue. These findings highlight the critical regulatory role of GABAergic neurons in certain behaviors and suggest that modulating the excitatory/inhibitory balance through GABAergic neurons could prove a viable therapeutic option in Rett syndrome."

Many researchers who study Rett syndrome use mice as a model of the disorder. In particular, male mice with the mouse equivalent of the human <i>MECP2</i> gene switched off in every cell in the body (also known as <i>Mecp2</i>-null mice) show many of the features of Rett syndrome and die at a young age."

This discovery led Ure et al. \u2013 including a researcher involved in the 2010 study \u2013 to ask if activating <i>Mecp2</i> in the same neurons in otherwise <i>Mecp2</i>-null mice was enough to prevent some of their Rett syndrome-like symptoms."

Alterations in this excitatory/inhibitory balance are postulated to underlie a number of neuropsychiatric disorders, such as autism\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib38\">Vattikuti and Chow, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Gogolla et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Rubenstein and Merzenich, 2003</a>), schizophrenia\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib3\">Belforte et al., 2010</a>), and Rett syndrome\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib10\">Dani et al., 2005</a>). Much of the work on this balance has focused on excitatory neurons, which make up the majority of the brain\u2019s neuronal population, yet it has become increasingly clear that inhibitory neurons, which predominantly release the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), play important roles in the proper function of entire circuits\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib40\">Xue et al., 2014</a>) and in the behaviors regulated by these circuits\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib41\">Yizhar et al., 2011</a>). Dysfunctional GABAergic signaling has been implicated in multiple neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib34\">Siniatchkin and Koepp, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Pizzarelli and Cherubini, 2011</a>), including Rett syndrome\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib7\">Chao et al., 2010</a>). In fact, deletion of <i>Mecp2</i> solely in GABAergic neurons is sufficient to reproduce the majority of the Rett-like features of the constitutive <i>Mecp2</i>-null mouse, including ataxia, stereotyped behaviors, seizures, breathing abnormalities, and premature death\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib7\">Chao et al., 2010</a>)."

RTT is notable for the variety of different behaviors it affects: disease-causing <i>MECP2</i> mutations cause a rapidly fatal neonatal encephalopathy in human males but allow females to develop normally until around one year of age, at which point they regress developmentally, losing acquired language, social, and motor milestones, and instead develop ataxia, seizures, hand stereotypies, learning and memory deficits, and respiratory abnormalities\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib36\">Trevathan and Naidu, 1988</a>). <i>Mecp2</i> knockout mice replicate all these features of the human disease\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib9\">Chen et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Guy et al., 2001</a>), with male <i>Mecp2</i>-null mice developing symptoms and dying within the first five months of life. <i>Mecp2</i>-heterozygous females develop progressive neurological dysfunction with a later onset, because random X chromosome inactivation preserves expression of wildtype <i>Mecp2</i> in more than half of their cells (<a href=\"#bib32\">Samaco et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Young and Zoghbi, 2004</a>)."

This system has already been used to demonstrate the critical role for GABAergic signaling in the pathogenesis of RTT\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib7\">Chao et al., 2010</a>), as well as revealing non-overlapping roles for parvalbumin (PV)- and somatostatin (SOM)-expressing GABAergic neurons in behavior\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib18\">Ito-Ishida et al., 2015</a>), a role in feeding and aggression for <i>Sim1</i>-positive hypothalamic neurons\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib12\">Fyffe et al., 2008</a>), and a critical role for proper glutamatergic function in anxiety, tremor, and acoustic startle response (see companion paper <a href=\"#bib23\">Meng et al., 2016</a>). Conversely, rescue of <i>Mecp2</i> expression in certain cell types can indicate whether targeting that cell type has therapeutic potential and can give insight into the interplay between multiple circuits in the diseased brain. Therefore, we genetically re-expressed <i>Mecp2</i> solely in GABAergic neurons in a mouse otherwise null for <i>Mecp2</i>, restoring <i>Mecp2</i> expression and function to inhibitory neurons, and observed profound improvement in both male and female mice."

This indicates that the development of tremor is particularly dependent on proper excitatory network activity; indeed, loss of <i>Mecp2</i> from GABAergic neurons does not result in tremor (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chao et al., 2010</a>), while glutamatergic conditional knockout mice do develop a tremor which is not observed in glutamatergic conditional rescue mice (see companion paper <a href=\"#bib23\">Meng et al., 2016</a>). Breathing, however, seems to be affected by dysfunction in both excitatory and inhibitory networks, as GABAergic conditional <i>Mecp2</i>-knockout mice do develop abnormal breathing patterns (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chao et al., 2010</a>). In addition, the rescue mice shared the acoustic startle deficit observed in the <i>Mecp2</i><sup>lox-Stop/Y</sup> mice (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>), with no differences in prepulse inhibition at any decibel level noted (data not shown). Interestingly, rescue mice also showed a partial benefit to anxiety: <i>Mecp2</i><sup>lox-Stop/Y</sup> and rescue mice performed similarly in the elevated plus maze test (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a>), but the rescue mice were indistinguishable from wildtype and <i>Viaat</i>-Cre control mice in the light-dark box test <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2I</a>.

Interestingly, levels of <i>Gad1, Gad2</i>, and <i>Vgat</i> were all decreased in the <i>Mecp2</i><sup>lox-Stop/Y</sup> but were identical to wildtype and <i>Viaat</i>-Cre levels in the rescue mice (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). We next assessed a slate of genes that are expressed in inhibitory neurons and known to be altered in <i>Mecp2</i>-null brains and observed the expected downregulation of <i>Nxph4, Gabra3, Kcng4, Opn3</i>, and <i>Scg2</i> as well as upregulation of <i>A1593442, Robo2, Rassf8</i>, and <i>Cabp7</i> in the <i>Mecp2</i><sup>lox-Stop/Y</sup> cerebellum. Tissues from rescue mice, however, showed reversal of these expression patterns, with the exception of <i>Robo2</i>, which trended to normalization (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Re-expression of <i>Mecp2</i> in GABAergic neurons thus normalizes several transcriptional changes related to inhibitory neuron function."

We prepared cortical slices and conducted whole cell recordings on pyramidal neurons in layer II/III of the somatosensory cortex, a region that showed alterations in these currents in the GABAergic conditional knockout mouse\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib7\">Chao et al., 2010</a>). We found that the frequency and amplitude of mIPSCs in the rescue mice showed a strong trend to increase when compared to the other genotypes, while the decay rate trended lower (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>), although none of these changes reached statistical significance when analyzed using a one-way ANOVA with a Tukey posthoc test (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). Taken together, these data suggest a trend to increased presynaptic GABA release with <i>Mecp2</i> reexpression in GABAergic neurons. Furthermore, rescue mice had similar numbers of vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT)-positive puncta to wildtype and <i>Viaat</i>-Cre controls in the hippocampal CA1, while <i>Mecp2</i><sup>lox-Stop/Y</sup> mice had significantly fewer VGAT+ synapses, indicating that reexpression of <i>Mecp2</i> in GABAergic neurons normalizes inhibitory synapse number (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). In contrast, the frequency and amplitude of mEPSCs in rescue mice were lower than those of wildtype and <i>Viaat</i>-Cre controls but similar to those of <i>Mecp2</i><sup>lox-Stop/Y</sup> mice (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>), indicating that <i>Mecp2</i> reexpression in GABAergic neurons failed to rescue mEPSCs. Vesicular glutamate transporter (Vglut1)-positive puncta numbers in the CA1 were not significantly different across genotypes, although there was a strong trend to fewer Vglut1+ puncta in the rescue mice (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure\u00a0supplement 1A</a>).

We also observed rescue of ataxic phenotypes at 18 weeks of age; while there was no significant difference in locomotion in the open field, the female rescue mice were no different from wildtype females in the footslip assay (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B,C</a>). Like the male rescue mice, however, the startle deficit of the female rescue mice at nine weeks was unaffected by reexpression of <i>Mecp2</i> in inhibitory neurons (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>), and we observed no difference in prepulse inhibition (data not shown); in contrast, this startle deficit was rescued in the glutamatergic neuron rescue female mice (see companion paper <a href=\"#bib23\">Meng et al., 2016</a>)."

This mimics the human disease, as some female RTT patients live full lifespans with considerable supportive care. To determine if the behavioral rescue observed at younger ages was sustained later in life, we assessed behavior in females at 30 weeks and 13 months of age. At both ages, <i>Mecp2</i><sup>lox-Stop/+</sup> females displayed a pronounced tremor and hindlimb clasping when suspended. At 30 weeks of age, female <i>Mecp2</i><sup>lox-Stop/+</sup> mice had similar locomotion to the other genotypes (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>), but they had poor grip strength (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>) and impaired dowel walk performance (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). In addition, they were hypersocial when presented with a novel partner mouse in the partition test (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>) and were slower to build nests (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G</a>). In contrast, the female rescue mice performed similarly to wildtype mice in each of these assays, although the difference from the <i>Mecp2</i><sup>lox-Stop/+</sup> mice was not statistically significant at early ages because of the latter\u2019s relatively mild impairment (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E\u2013G</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1D\u2013E</a>). At 13 months of age, female rescue mice moved noticeably more than the <i>Mecp2</i><sup>lox-Stop/+</sup> females (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6H</a>), were less ataxic by rotarod (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6I</a>), footslip (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6J</a>), and dowel walk (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1F</a>), and had better grip strength (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6K</a>). On each behavioral metric the performance of female rescue mice at this late age was worse than wildtype but still better than that of <i>Mecp2</i><sup>lox-Stop/+</sup> mice; interestingly, reexpression of <i>Mecp2</i> solely in glutamatergic neurons resulted in a near complete reversal of RTT-like phenotypes (see companion paper <a href=\"#bib23\">Meng et al., 2016</a>), possibly because restoring glutamatergic function in a brain with approximately half of the GABAergic neurons retaining <i>Mecp2</i> expression due to random X inactivation more closely approximated a normal excitatory-inhibitory balance. Notably, the GABAergic rescue mice had an observable tremor, but they never developed the hindlimb-clasping characteristic of the <i>Mecp2</i><sup>lox-Stop/+</sup> mice. The mitigation of the RTT-like phenotype observed in female rescue mice thus persisted well into their second year of life."

Artificial elevation of the ratio between excitatory and inhibitory signaling leads to social deficits in mice, an effect that is rescued by an increase of inhibitory circuit activity\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib41\">Yizhar et al., 2011</a>). Here, we present evidence that increasing inhibitory activity alone can reverse the majority of symptoms of a mouse model of RTT. Using existing, well-characterized mouse lines, we restored full-length <i>Mecp2</i> transcription solely in GABAergic neurons and enhanced inhibitory function in an otherwise <i>Mecp2</i>-null brain. This was sufficient to extend lifespan significantly and rescue body weight, ataxia, and apraxia in both male and female rescue mice."

                        "text": "At the time of this writing, there have been several conditional knockouts of <i>Mecp2</i> that target different neuronal subtypes, each replicating a few aspects of the <i>Mecp2</i> deletion phenotype: <i>Sim1</i> conditional knockout mice are hyperphagic and become obese\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib12\">Fyffe et al., 2008</a>); mice with <i>Mecp2</i> deleted from dopaminergic neurons develop some motor deficits\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib31\">Samaco et al., 2009</a>); and conditional knockout of <i>Mecp2</i> from basal forebrain cholinergic neurons may result in decreased anxiety and impaired social interaction (<a href=\"#bib43\">Zhang et al., 2016</a>). Deletion of <i>Mecp2</i> from two subtypes of inhibitory neurons, PV- and SOM-expressing neurons, also shortened lifespan and replicated a subset of the phenotypes of global <i>Mecp2</i> loss: PV-conditional knockout mice lacked critical period plasticity in the visual cortex\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib17\">He et al., 2014</a>) and developed motor, learning and memory, and social interaction deficits, while SOM-conditional knockout mice exhibited stereotyped behaviors and seizures\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib18\">Ito-Ishida et al., 2015</a>); interestingly, reexpression of <i>Mecp2</i> in these individual populations prolongs life and improves disease scores and auditory information processing (<a href=\"#bib13\">Goffin et al., 2014</a>). Of all the conditional knockouts, however, the GABAergic conditional knockout mouse most closely replicates the effect of global <i>Mecp2</i> deletion, with premature lethality, motor dysfunction, learning and memory deficits, and stereotypies. Only the anxiety and the persistent tremor of the <i>Mecp2</i>-null mouse is not reproduced\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib7\">Chao et al., 2010</a>)\u2014behaviors that are reproduced instead by the glutamatergic conditional knockout, along with motor incoordination, acoustic startle deficits, and early lethality (see companion paper <a href=\"#bib23\">Meng et al., 2016</a>). In parallel, our rescue of <i>Mecp2</i> expression solely in GABAergic neurons in otherwise <i>Mecp2</i>-null male mice completely reverses hypersociability, ataxia, and apraxia, as well as partially normalizing anxiety, but has no effect on acoustic startle responses or tremor. Meng et al\u2019s glutamatergic rescue of <i>Mecp2</i> expression in the same <i>Mecp2</i>-null male mice completely normalizes anxiety, tremor, and acoustic startle deficits, as well as reversing hypersociability and extending lifespan, but does not affect motor coordination. This extraordinary complementarity makes it clear that while certain behaviors may be mainly dependent on the proper function of only excitatory neurons (ie acoustic startle response, tremor) or only inhibitory neurons (ataxia), other behaviors are dependent on both populations functioning properly (social behavior). However, caution must be exercised in assessing the exact contributions of each population, as the <i>Viaat</i>-Cre allele also expresses in glycinergic neurons, which are important for breathing and proper brainstem function (<a href=\"#bib27\">Rahman et al., 2015</a>). Furthermore, small populations of neurons in the lateral and medial habenula, the auditory cortex, and possibly in the CA3 release both GABA and glutamate (<a href=\"#bib33\">Shabel et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Root et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Safiulina, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Noh et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Uchigashima et al., 2007</a>), which further complicates the picture. However, inhibitory neurons are found throughout the brain and, due to their exquisite sensitivity to the surrounding circuitry, can influence the behavior of large populations of surrounding neurons (<a href=\"#bib40\">Xue et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bonifazi et al., 2009</a>), while glycinergic and GABA/glutamate-coreleasing neurons are far smaller in number and restricted to discrete regions of the brain. It is thus reasonable to attribute the bulk of the behavioral rescue to the improved inhibitory function we observe in the rescue mice. Thus, the work presented here not only indicates that some behavioral aspects of RTT pathogenesis are modularly regulated by specific populations of neurons but also emphasizes the need for a complete understanding of the interplay between excitatory and inhibitory neurons in behavioral outputs."

A normal lifespan in the male mice is likely particularly dependent on the\u00a0function of both neuron types. In addition, there may also be a role for glia in RTT pathogenesis, as these cells are critical for neurotransmitter recycling\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib21\">Marcaggi and Attwell, 2004</a>). Notably, reactivation of <i>Mecp2</i> transcription solely in GFAP-positive astrocytes rescues the respiratory abnormalities of the <i>Mecp2</i>-null mouse and extends survival\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib19\">Lioy et al., 2011</a>), whereas our GABAergic rescue mouse showed no clear improvement in breathing. It is therefore conceivable that normal respiration and normal lifespan depend on an interplay between proper excitation, inhibition, and astrocyte function."

In the male rescue mice, inhibitory cells express <i>Mecp2</i>, but all excitatory neurons are null for <i>Mecp2</i>. When <i>Mecp2</i> expression is restored in inhibitory neurons in males, the increase in GABA signaling may effectively counteract much of the deficit resulting from the loss of <i>Mecp2</i> in all excitatory neurons, possibly explaining the profound rescue of disease-related symptoms in the male mice. In the female rescue mice, however, random X-inactivation should allow roughly 50% of the excitatory and inhibitory neurons to retain functional <i>Mecp2\u00a0</i>(<a href=\"#bib42\">Young and Zoghbi, 2004</a>), resulting in a heterogeneity of excitatory neuron activity within the brain of female mice that may neutralize much of the benefit gained by normalizing inhibitory neuron function. This idea is supported by the work of Meng et al., who show that rescue of <i>Mecp2</i> expression solely in excitatory neurons confers greater behavioral rescue in females than males. These glutamatergic rescue females benefit from a fully normalized excitatory neuron population as well as normal functioning from approximately 50% of inhibitory neurons, resulting in a strong rescue that is less impeded by heterogeneity. Males, however, are still left with dysfunctional inhibitory circuits and thus experience less benefit from restoration of MeCP2 levels in excitatory neurons. It is clear that inhibitory neurons are a valuable target for future pharmacological studies; future therapies that boost GABAergic function in both wildtype and <i>Mecp2</i>-null cells might prove more effective than a treatment targeted to the null cells alone. However, the work presented here and the work of Meng et al. also indicate that to achieve complete reversal of RTT symptoms, it may be necessary to pharmacologically elevate both inhibition and excitation."

Pharmacological therapies enhancing GABAergic signaling might confer noticeable benefit to RTT syndrome patients, buying time until additional therapies can be added to modulate other pathways such as glutamatergic signaling. However, our findings suggest great care is warranted in the choice of disease model for any future drug trial, as the <i>Mecp2</i>-null male and <i>Mecp2</i>-heterozygous female mice responded very differently to genetic rescue of <i>Mecp2</i> expression. For a therapeutic to be truly translatable to human RTT patients, it must be tested in both models."

At least 16\u2009hr before the partition tests, a novel age- and gender-matched partner mouse of a different background was placed on the opposite side of the partition. On the day of the test, the cage was placed on a well-lit flat surface. All nesting material and water bottles were removed from both sides of the cage, and the test mice were observed for 5 min while interaction time with the now-familiar partner mouse was recorded. Interactions involved the test mouse smelling, chewing, or actively exploring the partition. At the end of the first test (Familiar 1), the familiar partner mouse was replaced by a novel mouse of the same age, gender, and strain, and test mouse interactions were recorded for five minutes (Novel). The novel mouse was then removed and the familiar partner mouse returned to the cage, followed by observation for another 5 min (Familiar 2). At the completion of the partition test, test mice were returned to their original home cage. Data is shown as mean \u00b1 standard error of mean.

Adult male mice at 7\u20138 weeks of age were anesthetized with isoflurane and mounted in a stereotaxic frame. Under aseptic conditions, each mouse was surgically implanted with 4 silver wire (127 \u00b5m diameter, A-M Systems,\u00a0Sequim,\u00a0WA) recording electrodes aimed at the subdural space of the left/right frontal cortex (A2.0, LR1.8) and left/right parietal cortex (P3.8, LR1.8), respectively\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib25\">Paxinos and Franklin, 2001</a>). The reference electrode was positioned in the occipital region of the skull. All electrode wires were attached to a miniature connector (Harwin Connector, Portsmouth, Hampshire, UK) that was secured on the skull by dental cement. After 2 weeks of post-surgical recovery, cortical EEG activities (filtered between 0.1\u2009Hz and 1 kHz, sampled at 2 kHz) were recorded for 1\u2009hr per day over 4 days. Traces were analyzed by eye for abnormal electrographic signals."
