This program can be circumvented by a protein-based genetic element, the [<i>GAR</i><sup>+</sup>] prion, permitting simultaneous metabolism of glucose and other carbon sources. Diverse bacteria can elicit yeast cells to acquire [<i>GAR</i><sup>+</sup>], although the molecular details of this interaction remain unknown. Here we identify the common bacterial metabolite lactic acid as a strong [<i>GAR</i><sup>+</sup>] inducer. Transient exposure to lactic acid caused yeast cells to heritably circumvent glucose repression. This trait had the defining genetic properties of [<i>GAR</i><sup>+</sup>], and did not require utilization of lactic acid as a carbon source. Lactic acid also induced [<i>GAR</i><sup>+</sup>]-like epigenetic states in fungi that diverged from <i>S. cerevisiae</i> ~200 million years ago, and in which glucose repression evolved independently. To our knowledge, this is the first study to uncover a bacterial metabolite with the capacity to potently induce a prion."

This program can be circumvented by a protein-based genetic element, the [<i>GAR</i><sup>+</sup>] prion, permitting simultaneous metabolism of glucose and other carbon sources. Diverse bacteria can elicit yeast cells to acquire [<i>GAR</i><sup>+</sup>], although the molecular details of this interaction remain unknown. Here we identify the common bacterial metabolite lactic acid as a strong [<i>GAR</i><sup>+</sup>] inducer. Transient exposure to lactic acid caused yeast cells to heritably circumvent glucose repression. This trait had the defining genetic properties of [<i>GAR</i><sup>+</sup>], and did not require utilization of lactic acid as a carbon source. Lactic acid also induced [<i>GAR</i><sup>+</sup>]-like epigenetic states in fungi that diverged from <i>S. cerevisiae</i> ~200 million years ago, and in which glucose repression evolved independently. To our knowledge, this is the first study to uncover a bacterial metabolite with the capacity to potently induce a prion."

The robust nature of this glucose-associated repression can be readily observed by using glucose mimetics.

For example, just 0.05% of the mimetic glucosamine prevents yeast cells from utilizing non-fermentable carbon sources present at 40-fold higher concentrations (<a href=\"#bib3\">Ball et al., 1976</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Brown and Lindquist, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Kunz and Ball, 1977</a>)."

This allows them to switch from being metabolic specialists to metabolic generalists, gaining the ability to metabolize a wide variety of carbon sources in the presence of glucose. This heritable change in metabolic program is not accompanied by a change in the yeast genotype. Rather, the trait is cytoplasmically transduced from mother cells to their daughters through the inheritance of an altered protein conformation \u2013 a prion known as [<i>GAR</i><sup>+</sup>] (named for its ability to reverse <span class=\"underline\">g</span>lucose <span class=\"underline\">a</span>ssociated <span class=\"underline\">r</span>epression) (<a href=\"#bib9\">Brown and Lindquist, 2009</a>). Although the molecular details of [<i>GAR</i><sup>+</sup>] are incompletely understood, several operational tests to identify and modify it are known. [<i>GAR</i><sup>+</sup>]\u2019s nomenclature derives from defining characteristics of prion biology: dominance in genetic crosses (denoted by capital letters) and transmission to all progeny of meiosis (denoted by brackets). The ability to acquire [<i>GAR</i><sup>+</sup>] has been widely conserved among wild <i>S. cerevisiae</i> strains and is also present in fungal species separated by at least two hundred million years of evolution (<a href=\"#bib30\">Jarosz et al., 2014b</a>)."

Notably, this relationship substantiates a model in which [<i>GAR</i><sup>+</sup>]\u2019s benefit as a reversible bet-hedging element would alone be sufficient to motivate its evolutionary retention (<a href=\"#bib30\">Jarosz et al., 2014b</a>)."

[<i>GAR</i><sup>+</sup>] yeast cells also produce less ethanol, which itself has anti-bacterial properties. This generates a more hospitable environment for the inducing bacteria and allows them to flourish in fermentations where they would otherwise have perished (<a href=\"#bib29\">Jarosz et al., 2014a</a>); bacterial species that strongly induce [<i>GAR</i><sup>+</sup>] are common contaminants in failed wine fermentations (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bisson et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Boulton et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Jarosz et al., 2014a</a>).

These results and others have led us to propose that inducing bacteria produce a diffusible signal that promotes [<i>GAR</i><sup>+</sup>] in yeast."

Different concentrations of lactic acid elicit distinct and heritable [<i>GAR</i><sup>+</sup>]-like phenotypes that have the properties of \u2018strong\u2019 and \u2018weak\u2019 variants of the prion. Lactic acid also has the capacity to induce [<i>GAR</i><sup>+</sup>]-like epigenetic states in evolutionarily distant organisms in which glucose repression has evolved independently. Our results suggest that [<i>GAR</i><sup>+</sup>] induction may provide a molecular explanation for Pasteur\u2019s observations, and indicate that links between lactate and diversification of metabolic strategies have been repeatedly employed to modulate the collective behavior of eukaryotic cells. More importantly, we for the first time uncover a bacterially secreted molecule that induces a prion. We do so using a straightforward approach with few technical prerequisites, which we propose could be used for discovering other natural molecules that potentiate epigenetic transformations."

To characterize the diffusible element that was responsible for eliciting this change in yeast metabolism, we employed activity guided fractionation.

After removing the bacteria from the media by filtration to create a sterile conditioned medium, we assessed its capacity to induce growth on media containing glycerol (2%) and glucosamine (0.05%), hereafter abbreviated as GLY + GlcN.

Because <i>PMA1</i> is essential, we employed <i>pma1-DAmP</i>, a degron allele that reduces the amount of protein expressed (<a href=\"#bib8\">Breslow et al., 2008</a>).

Both depend upon the transcription factor <i>SOK2</i>, and the active mechanism is ultimately mediated by the monocarboxylate transporter <i>JEN1</i>. Jen1 is required for yeast to grow on lactic acid as a sole carbon source, but is down-regulated during glucose repression (<a href=\"#bib10\">Casal et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Pacheco et al., 2012</a>), and its transcript was not abundant in [<i>GAR</i><sup>+</sup>] cells compared to control cells (<a href=\"#bib9\">Brown and Lindquist, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Jarosz et al., 2014a</a>).

We also tested whether enzymes reported to be involved in lactic acid metabolism in the <i>Saccharomyces</i> Genome Database (<a href=\"#bib12\">Cherry et al., 2012</a>) could influence the ability of this molecule to induce [<i>GAR</i><sup>+</sup>]. Individual deletion of these various lactic acid dehydrogenases and transhydrogenases (<i>DLD1, DLD2, DLD3</i>, and <i>CYB2</i>) also had no significant effect on [<i>GAR</i><sup>+</sup>] induction by lactic acid (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>).

An intriguing but plausible explanation is that other bacterially secreted factors influence perception of the lactic acid signal, and that the effects of these molecules may also be species specific. Indeed, there is precedent for this behavior in choanoflagellates, where two bacterially secreted lipids were required to recapitulate full induction of rosette, multicellular colony formation (<a href=\"#bib2\">Alegado et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Woznica et al., 2016</a>).

This lack of knowledge in both areas hampers our ability to propose a mechanistic model that is more than just conjecture. We now allude to this in the Discussion, highlighting our result that <i>SOK2</i> provides a link between the two responses."

This work raises another interesting point of comparison that fascinates us \u2013 can other prions be induced by common environmental factors? Of course, we would not expect that lactic acid could induce all yeast prions, but discovery of inducers for other prions could substantially revise our understanding of the ecological dynamics at play in prion biology. We also now incorporate these lines of thinking in the Discussion."

This is consistent with prior work by Tyedmers et al., which found that multiple general proteostasis stressors could induce another prion, [<i>PSI</i><sup>+</sup>].
