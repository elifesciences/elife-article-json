Despite 20 years of research, APC's mechanistic function remains mysterious. We used FRAP, super-resolution microscopy, functional tests in mammalian cells and flies, and other approaches to define APC's mechanistic role in the active destruction complex when Wnt signaling is off. Our data suggest APC plays two roles: (1) APC promotes efficient Axin multimerization through one known and one novel APC:Axin interaction site, and (2) GSK3 acts through APC motifs R2 and B to regulate APC:Axin interactions, promoting high-throughput of \u03b2catenin to destruction. We propose a new dynamic model of how the destruction complex regulates Wnt signaling and how this goes wrong in cancer, providing insights into how this multiprotein signaling complex is assembled and functions via multivalent interactions."

Despite 20 years of research, APC's mechanistic function remains mysterious. We used FRAP, super-resolution microscopy, functional tests in mammalian cells and flies, and other approaches to define APC's mechanistic role in the active destruction complex when Wnt signaling is off. Our data suggest APC plays two roles: (1) APC promotes efficient Axin multimerization through one known and one novel APC:Axin interaction site, and (2) GSK3 acts through APC motifs R2 and B to regulate APC:Axin interactions, promoting high-throughput of \u03b2catenin to destruction. We propose a new dynamic model of how the destruction complex regulates Wnt signaling and how this goes wrong in cancer, providing insights into how this multiprotein signaling complex is assembled and functions via multivalent interactions."

Adult organs and tissues also contain small numbers of stem cells that can replace old or damaged cells. In both of these processes, stem cells need to \u2018decide\u2019 when they should start to change into a more specialized cell type, and which cell fate to choose (e.g., liver cell vs kidney cell). A signaling pathway involving Wnt proteins helps to direct many of these decisions. But if the \u2018Wnt signaling pathway\u2019 becomes activated at the wrong time, it can lead to cancer. For example, the first step in development of colon cancer is the inappropriate activation of Wnt signaling, and is most often caused by mutations in the gene that encodes a protein called APC. The APC protein is a tumor suppressor and normally inhibits Wnt signaling. However, even after over 20 years of effort, it remains largely mysterious how APC does this."

This protein complex performs one of the first steps in a process that ultimately marks a key component of the Wnt signaling pathway for destruction. Pronobis et al. have now used a range of techniques to define APC's role in this so-called \u2018destruction complex\u2019. This analysis revealed the internal structure of a complex made from APC and Axin, and showed that cable- and sheet-like assemblies of Axin were intertwined with APC cables. Further experiments then revealed how APC and Axin proteins are added into or leave these complexes, and showed that this is critical for this protein machine to work."

Secondly, specific features in APC allow it to interact with a third protein (called GSK3), which can then regulate how APC interacts with Axin. One of the next challenges will be to uncover how APC helps to transfer the components of Wnt signaling to the next step of their destruction, and to clear up the role played by GSK3."

Axin has binding sites for \u03b2cat, APC, GSK3, CK1 and PP2A, and self-polymerizes via its DIX domain (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), which allows it to locally increase the concentration of proteins mediating \u03b2cat phosphorylation (<a href=\"#bib17\">Ikeda et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Fagotto et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Liu et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Fiedler et al., 2011</a>).

APC's SAMP repeats bind Axin's RGS region, helping mediate destruction complex assembly. Both the Arm rpts and SAMPs are essential for APC function. APC also has multiple \u03b2cat binding sites, the 15 and 20 amino acid repeats (15Rs and 20Rs), which have different affinities for \u03b2cat, and act redundantly to sequester \u03b2cat and fine tune Wnt signaling (<a href=\"#bib29\">Liu et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Roberts et al., 2011</a>).

However, recent studies revealed that the destruction complex remains intact for some time after Wnt signals are received, and can continue to phosphorylate \u03b2cat (<a href=\"#bib16\">Hernandez et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Li et al., 2012b</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Kim et al., 2013</a>).

Further, while tumor cells do not effectively target \u03b2cat for destruction, it is less clear at what step destruction is blocked by APC truncation. In the simplest model, mutant destruction complexes wouldn't template \u03b2cat phosphorylation, but Axin's ability to do this in vitro in APC's absence cast doubt on this (<a href=\"#bib14\">Ha et al., 2004</a>). Further, cancer cells with truncated APC have high levels of phosphorylated \u03b2cat, suggesting that the step blocked is after \u03b2cat phosphorylation (<a href=\"#bib54\">Yang et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Kohler et al., 2008</a>). One intriguing study proposed that APC acts in the destruction complex to protect \u03b2cat from dephosphorylation and then targets it to the E3 ligase (<a href=\"#bib49\">Su et al., 2008</a>). However phospho-\u03b2cat is elevated in APC-mutant cell lines, despite loss of APC function suggesting that protecting \u03b2cat from dephosphorylation is not APC's only role in the destruction complex (<a href=\"#bib54\">Yang et al., 2006</a>).

Most destruction complex models, even those that consider the kinetics of initial destruction complex assembly (<a href=\"#bib25\">Lee et al., 2003</a>), portray it as a static entity that binds, phosphorylates and hands off \u03b2cat. Recent work prompted us to consider an alternative hypothesis, viewing the destruction complex as a complex multiprotein entity whose assembly, structure and dynamics are key to its function in maintaining low \u03b2cat levels when Wnt signaling is off. To test this hypothesis, we used FRAP, super-resolution microscopy and other approaches to explore the structure and dynamics of the destruction complex. This provided new insights into APC's mechanism of action, providing evidence that it plays two roles inside the active destruction complex: (1) APC promotes efficiency of the destruction complex by enhancing complex assembly through two separate APC:Axin interaction sites, one of which is novel, (2) the novel APC:Axin interaction is dynamic, and regulation of this interaction by GSK3 acting via motifs R2 and B is essential to send phosphorylated \u03b2cat to destruction. More broadly, our data also provide insights into how intrinsically disordered regions assist in the assembly and dynamics of multiprotein signaling complexes."

Here we sought to define the mechanism by which these motifs and APC itself act, using as a model SW480 colon cancer cells. These cells have high \u03b2cat levels, as they lack wildtype human APC1 (hAPC1) and instead express a truncated APC1 protein ending before the mutation cluster region (MCR; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). SW480 cells also express human APC2 (<a href=\"#bib31\">Maher et al., 2009</a>), but this is not sufficient to help mediate \u03b2cat destruction. We express in these cells fly APC2, the homolog of hAPC1, a full length APC that shares all conserved regions important for Wnt regulation with hAPC1 but is significantly smaller in size (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Fly APC2 effectively reduces \u03b2cat levels in SW480 cells (<a href=\"#bib41\">Roberts et al., 2011</a>), and thus can interact with all human destruction complex proteins needed to target \u03b2cat for degradation."

Axin puncta are dynamic multiprotein complexes that can recruit APC and other destruction complex proteins, and previous data from many labs are consistent with the idea that the puncta can serve as useful models of the smaller endogenous destruction complexes, based on correlations between puncta formation, dynamics, and function in \u03b2cat destruction (e.g. <a href=\"#bib12\">Faux et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Fiedler et al., 2011</a>)."

Our current goal was to define how these proteins' domains function together to facilitate APC and the destruction complex's mechanisms of action. To do so, we used the APC:Axin puncta formed in SW480 cells as a visible and thus measurable read-out to study mechanisms underlying destruction complex structure, assembly, dynamics and function."

This strategy likely leads to both variable expression levels between cells and elevated expression relative to endogenous protein. We first investigated variation from cell to cell within a transfection, by quantitating whole cell fluorescence of GFP- or RFP-tagged APC2 or Axin and investigating whether different levels of Axin or APC2 expression altered the ability to down-regulate \u03b2cat levels (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). There was a substantial range of APC2 or Axin expression levels among cells (5- to 10-fold). Importantly, \u03b2cat levels were substantially reduced at all levels of APC2 or Axin expression, even the lowest levels assessed\u2014this was true for Axin alone, APC2 alone, or Axin plus APC2 (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). In all cases, ability to reduce \u03b2cat levels was somewhat diminished at the highest levels of expression (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>)\u2014this may be because at very high expression levels, the transfected protein forms non-functional complexes with only a subset of the destruction complex proteins, as was previously suggested (<a href=\"#bib25\">Lee et al., 2003</a>)."

We describe the procedure used in detail in the Materials and methods. We began with Axin, to determine the level of over-expression of fly Axin vs endogenous human Axin. Since fly Axin is not recognized by hAxin1 antibodies we did this in two steps, first comparing levels of tagged human Axin1 vs <i>Drosophila</i> Axin using antibodies against the epitope tag, and then comparing the levels of the transfected human Axin1 vs the endogenous Axin1 protein in SW480, using antibodies against human Axin1 (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). We then used these ratios and the transfection efficiencies to calculate the average ratio of <i>Drosophila</i> Axin:endogenous hAxin1. Transfected Axin accumulated at roughly 80- to 120-fold that of endogenous hAxin1 (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). For APC, estimating \u2018overexpression\u2019 was more problematic, as SW480 cells do not accumulate wild-type APC1\u2014instead they accumulate a truncated APC1 ending at amino acid 1338 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). We thus used a similar two-step process, comparing levels of tagged human APC1 cloned so as to mimic the truncated APC1 seen in SW480 cells vs tagged <i>Drosophila</i> APC2 using antibodies to the epitope, and then levels of tagged truncated human APC1 vs that of the endogenous truncated APC1 protein (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). This ratio was roughly 1400\u20132400 (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). We suspect this is an over-estimate of the relative ratio of <i>Drosophila</i> APC2 to <span class=\"underline\">normal levels</span> of hAPC1 in a wild-type colon cell, as the truncated APC1 protein present in SW480 cells would accumulate at lower levels than wild-type APC1 if it is subjected to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, like many other proteins with early stop codons and like other truncated <i>APC1</i> alleles (<a href=\"#bib5\">Castellsagu\u00e9 et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Popp and Maquat, 2013</a>). Further, we also may need to reduce the ratio by a further factor of two as it is probable SW480 cells carry only one copy of the truncated APC allele, as most colorectal tumors either have the second allele mutated early enough to not produce a truncated protein or have lost the second allele by deletion (<a href=\"#bib8\">Christie et al., 2013</a>). Regardless, it is important to remember that while the puncta provide a useful and visualizable model of the destruction complex, we are examining over-expressed proteins."

Consistent with this, deleting the SAMPs disrupted APC2 recruitment into Axin puncta. However a shorter APC2 mutant, lacking both the SAMPs and R2 and B and thus resembling the truncated hAPC1 in tumors (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), did co-localize with Axin (<a href=\"#bib41\">Roberts et al., 2011</a>). We further found that deleting R2 and/or B, both of which are essential for APC function in flies and mammals, restored colocalization of Axin and APC2\u2206SAMPs (<a href=\"#bib41\">Roberts et al., 2011</a>).

When co-expressed with Axin, the Arm rpts and Axin puncta associate, suggesting the Arm rpts are the Axin association site (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C,D</a> arrows; intriguingly they often did not precisely colocalize, in contrast with the full length proteins (<a href=\"#bib41\">Roberts et al., 2011</a>)). Next we defined where on Axin the Arm rpts associate, by expressing Axin fragments and conducting co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E,F</a>). Both full length Axin and a region including the GSK3 binding site co-IPed with APC's Arm rpts (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E,F</a>). Axin's DIX domain was weakly detected in co-IPs, but this may occur by polymerization with full-length endogenous human Axin1 (hAxin1). Thus fly APC2's Arm rpts can mediate association with Axin's middle region.

In these images, Axin and APC colocalized in puncta without resolvable internal structure (e.g., <a href=\"#bib34\">Mendoza-Topaz et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Roberts et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>).

We thus used the superresolution approach Structured Illumination Microscopy (SIM) to visualize APC:Axin complexes, revealing a striking and previously undescribed internal structure.

To test this hypothesis, we quantified puncta cross-sectional area in Axin vs APC + Axin expressing cells, making z-projections of transfected cells and using the ImageJ particle analyzer. This revealed APC2:Axin puncta average almost twice the cross-sectional area of puncta formed by Axin alone (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2K</a>, left). We confirmed this by comparing the volume of Axin and APC:Axin complexes, as measured from our SIM data\u2014once again APC + Axin puncta were on average significantly larger than those assembled from Axin alone, and the largest APC + Axin puncta were larger than any of the Axin puncta (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2L</a>). When we compared the average number of complexes in Axin alone vs APC2 + Axin expressing cells, we found twice as many complexes in cells expressing Axin alone (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2K</a>, right), suggesting that in the absence of functional APC, Axin forms more numerous but smaller puncta. These data support the hypothesis that APC2 induces changes in the structure of Axin complexes formed in vivo, enhancing Axin assembly into higher order complexes."

Previous analyses suggested that Axin dynamics within the destruction complex puncta correlate with function. Axin puncta are dynamic protein assemblies, and the Wnt effector Dishevelled significantly increases Axin dynamics in puncta, suggesting it negatively regulates Axin self-association (<a href=\"#bib47\">Schwarz-Romond et al., 2007</a>), consistent with its known negative regulatory role in destruction complex function. To directly assess APC2 and Axin dynamics in the destruction complex and their influence on one another, we used Fluorescent Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) to measure dynamics of both APC2-GFP and Axin-RFP (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013D</a>). We assessed both recovery (mobile) fraction and t<sub>1/2</sub>, using unbleached puncta as controls. Recovery fraction assesses what percentage of molecules in a complex turnover in the experimental time frame, and t<sub>1/2</sub> reflects the rate at which the dynamic fraction is exchanged\u2014they are not necessarily dependent on one another. We found APC2 is also a dynamic component of destruction complex puncta, reaching a recovery plateau of 40% and a t<sub>1/2</sub> of 150 s (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>); however, APC2 is not as dynamic as Axin (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>)."

However, in SW480 cells, which express both truncated hAPC1 and endogenous hAPC2 (<a href=\"#bib31\">Maher et al., 2009</a>), Axin overexpression can increase \u03b2cat destruction (<a href=\"#bib35\">Nakamura et al., 1998</a>). If APC's role in the active destruction complex is to stabilize Axin assembly and thus the destruction complex scaffold, then APC should enhance Axin's ability to target \u03b2cat for destruction. We thus examined whether Axin alone fully restores \u03b2cat destruction, or whether adding APC2, either to endogenous wild-type Axin or co-expressed with fly Axin, further facilitates this. We began by measuring \u03b2cat fluorescence intensity in z-projections of cells transfected with either APC2 + Axin or Axin alone, using untransfected cells as internal controls (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F\u2013H</a>). Interestingly, while Axin reduced total \u03b2cat levels (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F,G</a>), \u03b2cat was further reduced in cells expressing both APC2 and Axin (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F,I</a>) suggesting that APC2 promotes more effective destruction complex activity."

Fly GFP-APC2 colocalizes in puncta with exogenous hAxin1-RFP (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3J</a>), and more importantly, endogenous hAxin1 coIPs with Flag-APC2 expressed in SW480 cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3K</a>). One further caveat is that we were assessing the ability of APC2 and Axin to promote \u03b2cat destruction after over-expression. To determine if differing levels of over-expression might explain the differences between Axin and APC2 + Axin (or \u2018APC2 alone\u2019), we quantitated level of Axin or APC2 expression in a given cell by measuring levels of GFP/RFP fluorescence, and in parallel assessed levels of \u03b2cat in that cell (via fluorescence intensity). Strikingly, \u03b2cat levels were more effectively reduced by APC2 + Axin or by \u2018APC2 alone\u2019 than by Axin at <span class=\"underline\">all levels</span> of expression assessed. As noted above, in all cases, ability to reduce \u03b2cat levels was somewhat diminished at the highest levels of expression (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>)\u2014this may be because at very high expression levels, the transfected protein forms non-functional complexes with only a subset of the destruction complex proteins, as was previously suggested (<a href=\"#bib25\">Lee et al., 2003</a>).

In contrast, puncta in cells co-expressing APC2 and Axin had almost undetectable \u03b2cat levels (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3I\u2032</a>, inset). We thus hypothesized that APC enhances Axin's ability to promote \u03b2cat exit from the destruction complex, and thus the destruction complex's \u03b2cat throughput. To further explore this, we examined phospho-\u03b2cat levels. SW480 cells, like other colon cancer cell lines with hAPC1 truncated before the Mutation Cluster Region (MCR; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), have high phospho-\u03b2cat levels (<a href=\"#bib54\">Yang et al., 2006</a>). This suggests that while Axin can facilitate \u03b2cat phosphorylation in these cells, Axin is less efficient at targeting \u03b2cat for destruction in the absence of wild-type APC1, and thus phosphorylated \u03b2cat accumulates. Strikingly, expressing APC2 alone or APC2 + Axin dramatically decreased phospho-serine 33/37 \u03b2cat (to \u223c20% that in untransfected cells), while Axin alone reduced phospho-\u03b2cat to only 60% (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3L,M</a>).

As others have previously observed (<a href=\"#bib44\">Sadot et al., 2002</a>), proteasome inhibition elevates \u03b2cat levels. Proteasome inhibition elevates \u03b2cat levels both in cells expressing Axin alone and in those expressing APC2 plus Axin (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Strikingly, this allows it to accumulate in puncta even in cells expressing Axin + APC2 (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A vs B</a>).

Deleting either region increased APC2 dynamics in Axin puncta; APC2\u0394Arm and APC2\u0394SAMPs turnover reached higher plateaus (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>; 80\u201390% vs 40% for wild-type) in shorter times (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>; t<sub>1/2</sub> wildtype APC2 150 s; APC2\u0394Arm 75 s; APC2\u0394SAMPs &lt;25 s). Thus, APC2 needs both the Arm rpts and the SAMPs to stably associate with Axin complexes. Next we examined Axin dynamics in the presence of each APC2 mutant. Both the Arm rpts and SAMPs were required to stabilize Axin in destruction complexes, since Axin coexpressed with either APC2\u0394Arm or APC2\u0394SAMPs exhibited the fast dynamics characteristic of Axin expressed alone (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>).

We thus tested whether both Axin interaction sites were essential for the effects on the structure of Axin puncta. APC2\u0394Arm, which retains the SAMPs, closely colocalized with Axin, even at SIM resolution, rather than forming filaments of its own within puncta, like wild-type APC2 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D\u2013F</a> vs <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4H</a>). Further, Axin within these puncta remained simple in structure, similar to puncta formed by Axin alone (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G</a>). APC2\u0394SAMPs, which is much less tightly associated with Axin by either confocal localization or coIP (<a href=\"#bib15\">Hart et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Roberts et al., 2011</a>), did not strongly colocalize with Axin, instead forming a diffuse network surrounding Axin puncta. Importantly, APC2\u0394SAMPs did not alter Axin structure within puncta as visualized by SIM. In the presence of APC2\u2206SAMPs, Axin puncta retained the simpler structure of those formed by Axin (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4I\u2013K</a>). Further, neither APC2\u0394Arm nor APC2\u0394SAMPs increased Axin puncta size or reduced Axin puncta number (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4L\u2013N</a>). Thus APC's ability to stabilize destruction complexes and stimulate growth of Axin cables requires both sites mediating Axin complex interaction, the Arm rpts and SAMPs. Both sites are also required to allow APC2 to efficiently downregulate \u03b2cat levels; APC2\u2206SAMPs did not stimulate \u03b2cat destruction below Axin-alone mediated levels, while APC2\u2206Armrpts could not downregulate \u03b2cat levels (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4O</a>). Since both APC2's Arm rpts and the SAMPs are essential for Wnt regulation in <i>Drosophila</i> (<a href=\"#bib41\">Roberts et al., 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib40\">2012</a>), this suggests that APC2's ability to stabilize destruction complex assembly through its multivalent interactions is critical for destruction complex throughput of \u03b2cat."

Co-IPs extended the FRAP results, revealing more stable APC2\u0394SAMPs:Axin interaction when R2 was deleted (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>; quantified in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>; the change after deleting motif B and the SAMPs did not reach statistical significance).

APC2\u2206SAMPs (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>) is only weakly recruited into Axin puncta (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). If GSK3 phosphorylation of R2/B antagonizes Arm rpts:Axin association, inhibiting GSK3 should increase colocalization of APC2\u0394SAMPs with Axin, as did deleting R2 or B (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Strikingly, while APC2\u2206SAMPs is largely diffusely cytoplasmic (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>), BIO treatment strongly increased Axin:APC2\u0394SAMPs colocalization (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a> arrows), in a concentration dependent manner (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>). Consistent with this, only 16% of untreated control cells had APC2\u0394SAMPs:Axin colocalization (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>), while inhibiting GSK3 with BIO increased colocalization to 75% of cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>). LiCl also led to robust Axin:APC2\u0394SAMPs colocalization (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1G</a> vs <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1H</a>; quantified in <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1I</a>). We used coIP to verify that APC2\u0394SAMPs associates more robustly with Axin upon GSK3 inhibition. Deleting the SAMPs drastically reduced APC2:Axin coIP (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7G</a>; quantified in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7H</a>). GSK3 inhibition by either LiCl or BIO increased APC2\u0394SAMPs coIP with Axin (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7G,H</a>). Thus GSK3 inhibition stabilizes steady state Axin:APC2\u2206SAMPs association, as did deleting R2 or B, consistent with our model that phosphorylating these motifs normally antagonizes Axin:Arm rpts association."

This suggests APC2 turnover in Axin complexes is regulated by GSK3. Our model further predicts that GSK3 regulates APC2 dynamics by regulating the APC2Arm rpts:Axin association. Thus GSK3 inhibition should stabilize APC2\u0394SAMPs:Axin interactions and reduce APC2\u0394SAMPs dynamics.

Strikingly, the recovery plateau and t<sub>1/2</sub> of APC2\u0394R2/B\u0394SAMPs were insensitive to GSK3 inhibition (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7K</a>), in contrast to APC2\u2206SAMPs. These data are consistent with GSK3 affecting APC2 residence time in the destruction complex through R2/B. However, deleting R2/B and blocking GSK3 activity had different effects on APC2 recovery fraction, suggesting that not all effects of GSK3 are mediated through R2/B. GSK3 phosphorylates other targets in the destruction complex, and thus it is very likely GSK3 inhibition has additional means of altering destruction complex dynamics. Further, an unphosphorylated R2/B motif may affect APC's dynamics differently than deleting R2/B. Taken together, however, our data suggest that GSK3 acts in part through R2 and B to promote release of APC2's Arm rpts from the Axin complex."

We thus inhibited GSK3 with either BIO or LiCl in cells co-expressing Axin and APC2 and examined both puncta size and number. GSK3 inhibition did not further increase puncta size or further decrease puncta number (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7L</a>).

Our hypothesis suggests phosphorylation of R2/B promotes release of APC2's Arm rpts from the Axin complex, and that this would be essential for the catalytic cycle of the destruction complex\u2014thus mutating these putative GSK3 phosphorylation sites in motif B would reduce APC2 function in helping mediate \u03b2cat destruction. To begin to test this, we replaced 2 (APC2AA; <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>, red arrows), 4 or 6 (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>, magenta arrowheads) conserved serines in B that match the GSK3 consensus with alanine, to prevent phosphorylation. All reduced function in downregulating \u03b2cat levels (see below and data not shown). We thus focused on the least altered of these, the mutant that replaced the more N-terminal two serine residues with alanine (APC2AA; <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>, red arrows), thus preventing phosphorylation. We also created a mutant that replaced these same two residues with aspartic acid, creating a phosphomimetic APC2 (APC2DD). Strikingly, while APC2DD effectively reduced \u03b2cat levels (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C,F</a>), APC2AA was unable to do so. APC2AA cells accumulated \u03b2cat at levels as high or higher than adjacent untransfected cells (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D,F</a>), suggesting these two amino acid missense mutations substantially reduced APC2 function. APC2DD substantially reduced \u03b2cat levels (to \u223c30%), but was not quite as effective as wildtype APC2 (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8F</a>). This statistically significant difference may suggest dephosphorylation of these residues is also required for full APC2 function. We also found mutating a single conserved serine residue in R2 to alanine (APC2 R2S-&gt;A (=APC2S660A); <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>) strongly diminished APC2 function in reducing \u03b2cat levels (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E,F</a>). Together, these data are consistent with a model in which phosphorylation of conserved serines in APC2 motifs R2 and B are important for APC's function in the destruction complex to target \u03b2cat for degradation. Finally, we tested whether the first of these putative phosphomutants affected APC2 dynamics in the FRAP assay. Since GSK3 inhibition slowed APC's dynamics, we predicted APC2AA should have a lower turnover rate than wildtype APC or APC2DD. We saw a subtle but statistically significant reduction in APC2AA recovery fraction (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8G</a>). However this was not nearly as dramatic as that of deleting R2 or B (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>); perhaps this due to the fact that we only altered two of several potential phosphorylation sites. Together these data are consistent with the idea that phosphorylation of conserved serine residues in R2/B regulates APC's function in the destruction complex, but since the effect on dynamics was substantially less dramatic than that of deleting R2 or B, it suggests other residues in R2 and B may also contribute to regulating APC2 dynamics. Further, it is clear that GSK3 has other effects on the complex, complicating interpretation of its inhibition. It will be important to examine this in the future."

Although we know APC functions in the destruction complex to help target \u03b2cat for degradation, its mechanism of action remains unknown. Our study offers novel insights into APC's function in the destruction complex, providing the first glimpses of the internal structure of the APC:Axin complex, and leading to a novel dynamic and testable model of a regulated catalytic cycle of destruction complex function. Based on our data we propose an explicit mechanistic model for APC2 function inside the destruction complex (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>). In step 1, APC2 stabilizes destruction complex assembly via its Arm rpts and SAMPs motifs. The assembled destruction complex then facilitates \u03b2cat phosphorylation (step 2) and protects it from dephosphorylation. GSK3, which phosphorylates \u03b2cat, Axin and other sites on APC, also phosphorylates APC2's R2 and B (step 3; CK1 may also be involved, as it is in the other phosphorylation events in the complex). We hypothesize this induces a conformational change in APC2 that releases the Arm rpts from association with Axin (step 4); since only a subset of APC2 molecules in the destruction complex would release the Arm rpts at any given time, the overall destruction complex would remain stable. We propose this conformational change allows transfer of phospho-\u03b2cat to the E3-ligase (step 5). Alternately, GSK3 may regulate the release of a complex of APC and phospho-\u03b2cat, allowing APC to shield phospho-\u03b2cat from dephosphorylation (<a href=\"#bib49\">Su et al., 2008</a>) and guide it to the E3-ligase. The catalytic cycle of APC would then be reset by dephosphorylation (step 6). This provides a testable model for the mechanisms regulating a key signaling pathway. It also may provide insights into the assembly and dynamics of other large multiprotein complexes that assemble via dynamic multivalent interactions involving motifs within intrinsically disordered regions, leading to phase transitions (<a href=\"#bib26\">Li et al., 2012a</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Toretsky and Wright, 2014</a>)."

One mechanism involved was already known: the DIX domain of Axin polymerizes in a head-to-tail fashion, in which beta-sheet 2 of one DIX domain interacts with beta-sheet 4 of the next monomer, thus forming filaments, and this polymerization is essential for destruction complex function (<a href=\"#bib47\">Schwarz-Romond et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Fiedler et al., 2011</a>). These Axin polymers are responsible for assembly of the cytoplasmic puncta we use as a model. Previous and current data from a number of labs are consistent with the idea that the puncta serve as useful models of the smaller endogenous destruction complexes (<a href=\"#bib12\">Faux et al., 2008</a>), based on correlations between puncta formation, dynamics, and function in \u03b2cat destruction. We used the puncta to visualize assembly and dynamics of Axin:APC complexes in parallel with functional studies in colon cancer cells and <i>Drosophila</i> to define APC's role in destruction complex assembly and function. It is important to note that our data in SW480 cells involve significant over-expression\u2014it will be useful in the future to examine destruction complex structure and function at endogenous levels, perhaps by tagging endogenous loci using CRISPR."

We found APC does so by interacting with Axin via <span class=\"underline\">two</span> different kinds of interaction sites: the known direct interaction with the SAMPs, and a novel interaction via APC's Arm rpts, which may be direct or indirect. Both interactions are critical for targeting \u03b2cat for destruction since APC without either SAMPs or Arm rpts cannot reduce \u03b2cat levels effectively. Almost all truncations in colon cancers remove the SAMPs (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kohler et al., 2008</a>).

Consistent with our observation that APC2 promotes growth and reduces dynamics of Axin complexes, APC2 cables intertwine with and bridge Axin cables. Both Axin interaction sites are required for these effects. Stimulating growth of Axin complexes via destruction complex stabilization by APC2 may be essential when proteins are expressed at endogenous levels, increasing local concentrations of all destruction complex components, accounting for the highly efficient \u03b2cat destruction observed in the presence of APC. It will be interesting to explore the nature of the protein network involved at even higher resolution. As noted above, thus far we have visualized complexes of APC2 and Axin expressed at significantly elevated levels\u2014it will be important to verify and extend these studies to the more modest size complexes found in vivo during normal development, using CRISPR to tag endogenous loci."

Overexpressing Axin reduced total \u03b2cat levels, suggesting Axin can partially compensate for APC truncation, but phospho-\u03b2cat levels remained elevated inside the destruction complex. Interestingly, introducing APC2 reduced \u03b2cat accumulation in puncta and reduced phospho-\u03b2cat levels. These data suggest that without functional APC, Axin can mediate \u03b2cat phosphorylation, but transfer of \u03b2cat out of the destruction complex toward destruction is less efficient. It remains to be determined whether the accumulated phospho-\u03b2cat is actively transferred by Axin to the E3-ligase in the absence of functional APC, or if it is passively transferred due to a substantial increase in phospho-\u03b2cat. Thus while Axin can template \u03b2cat phosphorylation and can, at least in the presence of the truncated APC1 present in tumor cells, send it on to destruction, our data suggest APC promotes the rate at which \u03b2cat is transferred out of the destruction complex and sent to the proteasome.

In contrast, in flies, in the complete absence of endogenous APC, APC2 requires its Arm rpts for Wnt regulation (<a href=\"#bib32\">McCartney et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Roberts et al., 2012</a>). Our data provide the first mechanistic role for the Arm rpts in Wnt function, demonstrating they act as a regulated Axin interaction site, and revealing that this interaction is conserved in humans. Whether this interaction is direct or indirect remains to be determined."

Two conserved APC motifs, R2 and B, are essential to target \u03b2cat for degradation (<a href=\"#bib22\">Kohler et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Roberts et al., 2011</a>). Deleting either leads to \u03b2cat accumulation in the destruction complex, suggesting R2 and B are critical for destruction complex throughput of \u03b2cat. Our colocalization, FRAP, and co-IP assays further suggest R2/B controls APC2:Axin association via APC2's Arm rpts. These data are consistent with a model in which APC2's R2 and B trigger an intramolecular conformational change in APC2, releasing the Arm rpts from association with the Axin complex (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>). In contrast, the SAMPs bind Axin independently of R2/B. In our model binding via the SAMPs would keep APC associated with Axin complexes when the Arm rpts are released, maintaining a functional destruction complex and facilitating \u03b2cat transfer to the E3-ligase. However, as noted above, it is also possible GSK3 may regulate the release of a complex of APC and phospho-\u03b2cat, allowing APC to shield phospho-\u03b2cat from dephosphorylation (<a href=\"#bib49\">Su et al., 2008</a>) on the way to the E3-ligase."

GSK3 increases APC2 dynamics, destabilizing the Arm rpts:Axin association via a mechanism that requires R2 and B. Strikingly, mutating two conserved serines in B to alanine blocked APC2's ability to reduce \u03b2cat levels, while a parallel phosphomimetic mutant did not disrupt APC2 function. We saw a similar reduction in APC2 function after mutating a conserved serine residue in R2. Consistent with our data, CK1epsilon phosphorylation of hAPC1 R2 occurs in an Axin-dependent fashion, and site directed mutagenesis blocking phosphorylation of two conserved serines in R2 (hAPC1 S1389 and S1392; distinct from and just C-terminal to the residue we mutated in APC2 R2) reduced the ability of a human APC1 fragment to down regulate Wnt signaling (<a href=\"#bib43\">Rubinfeld et al., 2001</a>), further suggesting R2 phosphorylation also is important for APC function. Our data are consistent with a model in which GSK3 phosphorylation of R2 and B could be one major regulatory step in APC2's dynamic cycle in the destruction complex, triggering release of the Arm rpts from the Axin complex, and thus allowing APC2 to promote \u03b2cat release for destruction (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>). However, our data also show that mutating two residues in motif B to prevent their phosphorylation had only a subtle effect on APC2 dynamics. This may suggest additive roles for multiple phosphorylated residues, or may suggest the connection between phosphorylation, dynamics and function is more complex. Further, GSK3 can phosphorylate most of the other proteins in the destruction complex, and thus it clearly plays multiple roles in its function."

Our results also suggest GSK3 is likely to affect destruction complex structure and dynamics via several mechanisms, consistent with its known role in phosphorylating Axin and other sites in APC. Mathematical modeling suggests that a reduction in GSK3 ability to phosphorylate \u03b2cat is one key step in Wnt signaling activation, placing GSK3 activity in the center of \u2018destruction complex inactivation\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib25\">Lee et al., 2003</a>). It is intriguing to speculate about GSK3-mediated APC regulation in the context of Wnt signaling. Since GSK3 activity is inhibited by Wnt signaling, key residues in R2 and B that drive APC:Axin interaction dynamics would no longer be phosphorylated. Our data suggest this would decrease APC dynamics in the Axin complex (since APC's Arm rpts would more strongly associate with Axin), perhaps reducing \u03b2cat transfer out of the destruction complex. Thus the drop in GSK3 activity upon Wnt signaling would not only downregulate the destruction complex via its main target, \u03b2cat, but through a core destruction complex component, APC, by acting via R2 and B. It will be of interest to explore further these complex interactions in both Wnt off and Wnt on states."

This re-focused our attention on the much higher levels of \u03b2cat seen in <i>APC2 APC1</i> mutants than occur in wildtype cells where Wg signal turns the destruction complex \u2018OFF\u2019. These results suggest the destruction complex remains active when Wnt signal is on, but operates less effectively\u2014this is very consistent with recent in vitro work (<a href=\"#bib16\">Hernandez et al., 2012</a>). A destruction complex operating at reduced levels could lead to high enough \u03b2cat levels to activate Wnt target genes but could maintain low enough levels to be quickly shut down when needed; it would also prevent the apoptosis seen in some cell types at extremely high \u03b2cat levels. The drop in GSK3 activity upon Wnt signaling would both decrease phosphorylated \u03b2cat and, based on our model, inhibit APC facilitating \u03b2cat transfer to the E3-Ligase. This speculative hypothesis would merge two recent studies proposing either reduced \u03b2cat phosphorylation (<a href=\"#bib16\">Hernandez et al., 2012</a>) or a key regulated step involving transfer of \u03b2cat to the E3-ligase (<a href=\"#bib27\">Li et al., 2012b</a>) as key steps in Wnt regulation of the destruction complex.

Beads were blocked in 5% BSA/1xPBS overnight at 4 \u00b0C, added to antibody-lysis mix, incubated 1\u20132 h at 4 \u00b0C, washed 5\u00d7 with lysis buffer 4 \u00b0C, mixed with 2xSDS and incubated 10 min at 96 \u00b0C . Cell lysis for immunoblotting was similar. For \u03b2cat protein levels centrifugation was at 13,200 rpm for 30 min or 1000 rpm for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C. Drug treated cells were harvested after 6h. Proteins were run on 8% or 6% (hAPC1) SDS gels and blotted to nitrocellulose. IP quantification was in ImageJ using Gel plot analyzer. IP baits were normalized to amount of IPed protein, and \u03b2cat protein levels were normalized to loading control \u03b3-tubulin."

However, there were many places where the reviewers felt that there were additional experiments and important controls needed to support the conclusions of the manuscript. In particular, providing more information about the levels of overexpression in tissue culture cell lines would be helpful. More support is also needed for the conclusion that APC dynamics promotes beta-catenin flux through the DC (alternative approaches are suggested by the reviewers, such as the use of proteasome inhibitors). More explanation is needed for the selection of the sites focused on, and more mutational analysis should be considered in order to strengthen their conclusions. In addition, there were many places where more restricted (less-broad) conclusions were merited by the data presented in this manuscript (as detailed fully below, in the reviewers' comments). As an online journal <i>eLife</i> provides sufficient space to fully explain both rationales for and the important caveats of the experimental approaches used."

There are a couple of general sentences stating that the field is comfortable with using these punctae as surrogates for the endogenous DC that are not very compelling. The super-resolution microscopy is cool and the images are gorgeous, though the fact remains they are large protein complexes caused by overexpression. They are probably are functional in regard to down-regulating beta-catenin, but are all their characteristics relevant to endogenous DC function? This is an inherent limitation of the manuscript. It would be helpful for readers to know what level of overexpression is being employed (compare to endogenous proteins) and what is variability of expression among individual cells transfected with APC or Axin constructs."

This undercuts the utility of the <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G, I</a> comparison, maybe there is undetectable levels of beta-catenin in Axin/APC2 punctae because there is less overall beta-catenin.

They then proceed to the next critical test: mutating predicted GSK3 sites in APC and testing them functionally. They mutate two serines in B, converting them to either alanines (APC2AA) or aspartic acid (APC2DD; hoping for a phosphomimic effect). Clearly the AA mutant is defective in APC function, nicely shown in the fly rescues in <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>. But the effects on punctae dynamics are absent (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8F</a>; comparing wild-type APC2 with APC2AA). The authors focus on the small difference between APC2DD and APC2AA, but this difference is also very, very subtle. The data don't fit into a coherent model, since they demonstrate that a surgical mutation that has a big effect on APC function has no detectable effect on APC/Axin dynamics. Perhaps a more comprehensive mutagenesis of the predicted phosphorylation sites would provide a clearer link between GSK3 phosphorylation of APC, APC dynamics in DC punctae and APC function. But the two mutants characterized are not sufficient."

It's very reasonable to invoke a phosphorylation induced conformational change: it's a common mechanism for regulating protein shape. But the manuscript doesn't provide direct evidence for a conformational change, and I don't think the data provides a paradigm for the broader field of researchers studying multiprotein complexes. Rather, I think this report does address important issues in APC function in the DC, and that is a significant goal."

Have the authors tried this? I ask only because the \u03b2-cat accumulation at punctae is somewhat confusing-one can only see this structure if the diffuse pool was effectively degraded, and all of the mutants basically need to do this in order for the authors to capture differences in \u03b2-cat accumulation within punctae. I think it would be helpful to clarify that all of the mutants can degrade \u03b2-catenin (as evidenced by depletion of the diffuse cytosolic pool of \u03b2-cat), but that there must be rate differences due to accumulation differences in the punctae."

The authors need to define what criteria they used to identify putative sites. I have a number of concerns about this experiment: The kinase assay is lacking positive controls. What is the band in the GST/GSK3 lane? Why are there multiple bands in the R2/B/GSK3 lane? What do the asterisks mean in the figure? Why are there GST-only bands in the coomassie lanes 3-6? What was the rationale for mutating the two selected Ser residues? They don't seem to match the consensus any better than the others. The logic given states that they are the most N terminal, when in fact two other Ser residues are more N terminal, and there are no potential CK1 priming sites. As the authors wisely state in subsection \u201cMutating putative phosphorylation sites in B disrupts APC2's function in regulating \u03b2cat destruction in SW480 cells\u201d, it is very likely that GSK3 inhibition affects many aspects of DC dynamics, so all findings should be interpreted cautiously.

We thus compared transfected fly APC2 to this truncated human APC1 protein, seeing ratios of roughly 1400-2400 fold. However, we think this is likely to significantly overestimate over-expression relative to what would be the normal level of accumulation of wild-type human APC1 in a normal colon cell for two reasons. First, the truncated APC1 protein present in SW480 cells is reasonably likely to accumulate at lower levels than wild-type APC1, as it is likely to be subjected to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay like many other proteins with early stop codons. In fact, a recent paper noted that 12/14 APC- mutation\u2013positive families in whom the mutation was located before the last exon of the gene had allele specific imbalance at the mRNA level, which is consistent with a mechanism of nonsense-mediated decay (<a href=\"#bib5\">Castellsagu\u00e9 et al., 2010</a>). Second, we also may need to reduce the difference by a factor of two as it is probable SW480 cells carry only one copy of the truncated APC allele, as most colorectal tumors either have the second allele mutated early enough to not produce a truncated protein or have lost the second allele by deletion (<a href=\"#bib8\">Christie et al., 2013</a>)."

APC2DD substantially reduced \u03b2cat levels (to \u223c30%), but was not quite as effective as wildtype APC2 (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8F</a>). This statistically significant difference may suggest dephosphorylation of these residues is also required for full APC2 function. We also found mutating a single conserved serine residue in R2 to alanine (APC2660; <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>) strongly diminished APC2 function in reducing \u00dfcat levels (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E,F</a>). Together, these data are consistent with a model in which phosphorylation of conserved serines in APC2 motifs R2 and B are important for APC's function in the destruction complex to target \u03b2cat for degradation. Finally, we tested whether the first of these putative phosphomutants affected APC2 dynamics in the FRAP assay. Since GSK3 inhibition slowed APC's dynamics, we predicted APC2AA should have a lower turnover rate than wildtype APC or APC2DD. We saw a subtle but statistically significant reduction in APC2AA recovery fraction (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8G</a>). However this was not nearly as dramatic as that of deleting R2 or B (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>); perhaps this due to the fact that we only altered two of several potential phosphorylation sites. Together these data are consistent with the idea that phosphorylation of conserved serine residues in R2/B regulates APC's function in the destruction complex, but since the effect on dynamics was substantially less dramatic than that of deleting R2 or B, it suggests other residues in R2 and B may also contribute to regulating APC2 dynamics. Further, it is clear that GSK3 has other effects on the complex, complicating interpretation of its inhibition. It will be important to examine this in the future.\u201d"

For example, one of the relevant sections now reads: \u201cMotifs R2 and B include highly conserved serine/threonines matching the GSK3 and CK1 consensuses, and this region is phosphorylated by GSK3 in vitro. GSK3 increases APC2 dynamics, destabilizing the Arm rpts:Axin association via a mechanism that requires R2 and B. Strikingly, mutating two conserved serines in B to alanine blocked APC2's ability to reduce \u03b2cat levels, while a parallel phosphomimetic mutant did not disrupt APC2 function. We saw a similar reduction in APC2 function after mutating a conserved serine residue in R2. Consistent with our data, CK1epsilon phosphorylation of hAPC1 R2 occurs in an Axin-dependent fashion, and site directed mutagenesis blocking phosphorylation of two conserved serines in R2 (hAPC1 S1389 and S1392; distinct from and just C-terminal to the residue we mutated in APC2 R2) reduced the ability of a human APC1 fragment to down regulate Wnt signaling (<a href=\"#bib43\">Rubinfeld et al., 2001</a>), further suggesting R2 phosphorylation also is important for APC function. Our data are consistent with a model in which GSK3 phosphorylation of R2 and B could be one major regulatory step in APC2's dynamic cycle in the destruction complex, triggering release of the Arm rpts from the Axin complex, and thus allowing APC2 to promote \u03b2cat release for destruction (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10</a>). However, our data also show that mutating two residues in motif B to prevent their phosphorylation had only a subtle effect on APC2 dynamics. This may suggest additive roles for multiple phosphorylated residues, or may suggest the connection between phosphorylation, dynamics and function is more complex. Further, GSK3 can phosphorylate most of the other proteins in the destruction complex, and thus it clearly plays multiple roles in its function.\u201d"

We found that Fly GFP-APC2 colocalizes in puncta with exogenous hAxin1-RFP (present in new <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3J</a>), and more importantly, that endogenous hAxin1 coIPs with Flag-APC2 expressed in Sw480 cells (new <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3K</a>).

These cells have high \u03b2cat levels, as they lack wildtype human APC1 (hAPC1) and instead express a truncated APC1 protein ending before the mutation cluster region (MCR; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). SW480 cells also express human APC2 (<a href=\"#bib31\">Maher et al., 2009</a>), but this is not sufficient to help mediate \u03b2cat destruction.\u201d We note the potential importance of truncated APC1 and APC2 in the residual function of Axin over-expression in these cells when we initiate examination of Axin vs Axin + APC2 function, as follows: \u201cAxin cannot target \u03b2cat for destruction in APC's complete absence, even when Axin is overexpressed (<a href=\"#bib34\">Mendoza-Topaz et al., 2011</a>). However, in SW480 cells, which express both truncated hAPC1 and endogenous hAPC2 (<a href=\"#bib31\">Maher et al., 2009</a>), Axin overexpression can increase \u03b2cat destruction (<a href=\"#bib35\">Nakamura et al., 1998</a>).\u201d Finally, we now end the relevant section of the Discussion by pointing toward the importance of further resolving these issues in the future, as follows: \u201cThe development of CRISPR knockout technology will allow future examination of the importance of truncated APC1, as well as the endogenous APC2 and Axin expressed in colon cancer cells in destruction complex assembly and function.\u201d"

The reviewer correctly points out that there are two more serines in \u201cmotif B\u201d N-terminal to those we mutated. However, in fly APC1, fly APC2, and the single APC family member in the brine shrimp <i>Daphnia</i>, there is a cysteine residue deleted relative to the vertebrate APC1 or APC2 sequences, and thus the spacing of these more N-terminal serines was not exactly the same. As a result, one of these N-terminal serines doesn't share the correct spacing in the arthropod family members to be a match to the usual GSK3 consensus (S-X-X-X-S) (we now make this clear in the Figure). We thus initially confined our analysis to the region of motif B C-terminal to this deleted residue. We began with this more confined definition of motif B, and mutated two, four or six of the conserved serine residues to alanine. Each of these essentially eliminated function of APC2 in downregulating \u00dfcat levels. We thus continued our analysis with the least altered of these, which altered the two residues on which we focused in our work.
