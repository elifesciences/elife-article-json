Here we reveal that IgE<sup>+</sup> B cells are constrained by chronic activity of the IgE B cell receptor (BCR). In the absence of cognate antigen, the IgE BCR promoted terminal differentiation of B cells into plasma cells (PCs) under cell culture conditions mimicking T cell help. This antigen-independent PC differentiation involved multiple IgE domains and Syk, CD19, BLNK, Btk, and IRF4. Disruption of BCR signaling in mice led to consistently exaggerated IgE<sup>+</sup> germinal center (GC) B cell but variably increased PC responses. We were unable to confirm reports that the IgE BCR directly promoted intrinsic apoptosis. Instead, IgE<sup>+</sup> GC B cells exhibited poor antigen presentation and prolonged cell cycles, suggesting reduced competition for T cell help. We propose that chronic BCR activity and access to T cell help play critical roles in regulating IgE responses."

Here we reveal that IgE<sup>+</sup> B cells are constrained by chronic activity of the IgE B cell receptor (BCR). In the absence of cognate antigen, the IgE BCR promoted terminal differentiation of B cells into plasma cells (PCs) under cell culture conditions mimicking T cell help. This antigen-independent PC differentiation involved multiple IgE domains and Syk, CD19, BLNK, Btk, and IRF4. Disruption of BCR signaling in mice led to consistently exaggerated IgE<sup>+</sup> germinal center (GC) B cell but variably increased PC responses. We were unable to confirm reports that the IgE BCR directly promoted intrinsic apoptosis. Instead, IgE<sup>+</sup> GC B cells exhibited poor antigen presentation and prolonged cell cycles, suggesting reduced competition for T cell help. We propose that chronic BCR activity and access to T cell help play critical roles in regulating IgE responses."

IgE-mediated hypersensitivity responses are typically localized to specific tissues such as the skin, nose, lung, or intestine, whereas systemic responses can result in life-threatening anaphylaxis. Only a small fraction of individuals with allergic diseases will experience anaphylaxis, however, suggesting that IgE responses are normally restricted. Indeed, IgE is the least abundant antibody isotype in serum. While the availability of IgE in serum is limited in part by a short half-life and binding to Fc receptors, the production of secreted IgE appears to be tightly regulated (<a href=\"#bib19\">Geha et al., 2003</a>)."

A likely candidate for intrinsic regulation is the expression of the IgE B cell receptor (BCR). Each isotype of BCR has a different constant region sequence which may confer different signaling capabilities. IgG BCRs can promote enhanced responses compared with IgM BCRs, most notably enhanced PC differentiation in recall responses (<a href=\"#bib44\">Martin and Goodnow, 2002</a>). This is thought to be due, at least in part, to the extended intracellular cytoplasmic tail of the IgG BCR, compared with the short three amino acid sequence (KVK) in IgM (<a href=\"#bib44\">Martin and Goodnow, 2002</a>). A conserved tyrosine motif in the cytoplasmic tail of the IgG BCR, which was reported to be primarily responsible for its differential signaling, is also present in the IgE BCR (<a href=\"#bib16\">Engels et al., 2009</a>). The cytoplasmic tail of the IgE BCR has also been implicated in promoting apoptosis through binding the mitochondrial protein Hax1 (<a href=\"#bib36\">Laffleur et al., 2015</a>)."

This cell fate predisposition occurred in the absence of cognate antigen, whereas the IgG1 BCR promoted PC differentiation only in the presence of cognate antigen. Multiple domains of the BCRs were responsible for the difference between the IgE and IgG1 isotypes. The propensity of the IgE BCR to induce antigen-independent PC differentiation was associated with a weak, constitutive activity of the IgE BCR. Genetic or pharmacological perturbations in BCR signaling led to reduced PC differentiation of IgE<sup>+</sup> B cells in the absence of cognate antigen in cell culture. In immunized mice, reductions in BCR signaling led to consistently increased IgE<sup>+</sup> GC B cell responses with variable effects on PCs. The effects of BCR signaling on IgE<sup>+</sup> GC B cell responses could not be explained by differential rates of apoptosis, as we found no evidence that the IgE BCR directly promotes apoptosis. Instead, BCR signaling slowed the cell cycle progression of IgE<sup>+</sup> GC B cells, and low IgE BCR expression limited antigen uptake and presentation. Thus, IgE B cell responses are restrained by a predisposition toward early PC differentiation, prolonged cell cycles, and limited access to T cell help, leading to reduced affinity maturation and memory cell generation."

We previously reported that this in vivo observation could be recapitulated in primary B cell cultures with anti-CD40 antibodies and IL-4 (<a href=\"#bib83\">Yang et al., 2012</a>), which promote class switch recombination (CSR) to IgE and IgG1. In these B cell cultures, a substantially greater fraction of IgE<sup>+</sup> cells were PCs compared with IgG1<sup>+</sup> cells. This result was confirmed again here using CD138 (Syndecan-1) as a marker of PCs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A and B</a>). We found that a larger fraction of IgE<sup>+</sup> cells than IgG1<sup>+</sup> cells had a PC phenotype regardless of the concentration of anti-CD40 antibody, although we noted that stronger CD40 stimulation was inhibitory toward PC differentiation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A and B</a>). We also previously established that the increased PC differentiation occurs in IgE<sup>+</sup> B cells that have undergone the same number of cell divisions as IgG1<sup>+</sup> B cells (<a href=\"#bib83\">Yang et al., 2012</a>). These observations established a strong correlation between CSR to IgE and PC differentiation, but the cause of this correlation was unknown. Notably, these culture conditions mimic T cell help but do not stimulate the BCR. We hypothesized that the IgE BCR itself promotes PC differentiation in the absence of cognate antigen. We sought to test this model by ectopically expressing the IgE BCR in primary B cells."

We chose retroviral transduction, which is a robust method to express genes in primary B cells (<a href=\"#bib80\">Wu et al., 1987</a>). However, initial experiments with standard retroviral vectors were hampered by variable expression. We therefore engineered a retroviral vector using the EF1\u03b1 promoter (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), which we found gave much more uniform and robust expression. A heavy chain variable region specific for 2,4,6-trinitrophenyl (TNP) was linked to the heavy\u00a0chain\u00a0constant regions of each BCR isotype (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). As a reporter of transduction, Cerulean (<a href=\"#bib61\">Rizzo et al., 2004</a>), a derivative\u00a0of\u00a0cyan fluorescent protein, was placed upstream of the heavy chain, linked by a 2A sequence (<a href=\"#bib13\">de Felipe et al., 2006</a>) which allows translationally-linked expression of multiple proteins from a single transcript (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

B cell proliferation was again stimulated with anti-CD40 and IL-4. Transduced cells were identified as Cerulean<sup>+</sup> and PC differentiation was measured by the expression of the marker CD138 (Syndecan-1). Strikingly, among all isotypes tested, the IgE BCR promoted the highest frequency of PC differentiation in the absence of cognate antigen (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). The IgM and IgG1 BCRs did not promote PC differentiation in the absence of cognate antigen, whereas the IgD and IgA BCRs had intermediate effects (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Since the IgG1 BCR has been reported to be much more efficient than IgM at inducing PC differentiation in vivo (<a href=\"#bib44\">Martin and Goodnow, 2002</a>), we modified our system to test antigen-dependent effects. Specifically, we generated retroviral constructs encoding both the light chain and heavy chain from a TNP-specific monoclonal antibody, in which the heavy chain variable region was linked to the constant regions of various heavy chain isotypes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). These TNP-specific BCR constructs were then transduced into AID-deficient B cells. Upon the addition of TNP-ovalbumin (OVA), the TNP-specific IgG1 BCR promoted robust PC differentiation, similar to the IgE BCR (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). The addition of TNP-OVA also resulted in a more moderate increase in PC differentiation in cells transduced with TNP-specific IgM BCRs, with intermediate results with IgD BCRs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). However, the addition of TNP-OVA did not cause a further increase in PC differentiation in cells transduced with TNP-specific IgE or IgA BCRs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). Taken together, these data suggest that the IgE BCR is a strong inducer of PC differentiation in an antigen-independent manner, mimicking the behavior of an antigen-engaged IgG1 BCR."

Initial efforts focused on the intracellular cytoplasmic tail (CT) region, which is thought to be responsible for major differences in signaling among BCR isotypes (<a href=\"#bib79\">Wienands and Engels, 2016</a>). Surprisingly, antigen-independent PC differentiation was unaffected when the IgE CT was replaced with that of IgG1 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). The transmembrane (TM) region of the BCR is thought to mediate association with the signaling adapters Ig\u03b1 and Ig\u03b2 (<a href=\"#bib59\">Reth, 1992</a>), yet swapping the TM region also had no impact on antigen-independent PC differentiation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Membrane BCRs also contain a short extracellular segment proximal to the membrane that is unique to each isotype, known as the membrane Ig isotype-specific (migis) segment or the extracellular membrane proximal domain (<a href=\"#bib12\">Davis et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Major et al., 1996</a>). The expression of constructs in which the migis of IgE was swapped with that of IgG1 led to a profound loss of antigen-independent PC differentiation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). In reverse swaps, in which these domains of IgE were introduced into IgG1, the migis enhanced antigen-independent PC differentiation, but more striking results were seen when the IgE migis was combined with the IgE TM and CT, but not with the TM alone, suggesting that the CT may also be able to contribute to antigen-independent PC differentiation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Taken together, the IgE migis region appears to be necessary, but not sufficient, for antigen-independent PC differentiation mediated by the IgE BCR. Full antigen-independent activity of the IgE BCR required the IgE migis region to be combined with either the extracellular domains of IgE or the CT of IgE."

We observed that IgM was downmodulated in B cells transduced with IgE (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, construct 1) but not with IgG1 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, construct 3). The IgM downmodulation was dependent on the migis region, as revealed by transducing constructs with the migis regions swapped (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, constructs 2 and 4). Indeed, in cells transduced with each of the constructs shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, all of the constructs that contained the IgE migis resulted in downmodulation of surface IgM, whereas the constructs that contained the IgG1 migis did not (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). We hypothesized that this IgM downmodulation might reflect competition of the transduced BCRs versus IgM for binding to Ig\u03b1. It was reported that similar to IgM, the IgE BCR depends on binding to Ig\u03b1 for export from the endoplasmic reticulum, whereas the IgG BCR does not (<a href=\"#bib74\">Venkitaraman et al., 1991</a>). This difference among isotypes had been attributed to the TM domain (<a href=\"#bib59\">Reth, 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Venkitaraman et al., 1991</a>), but we considered whether the migis, which is proximal to the membrane, could also be involved in Ig\u03b1 association. We transduced the IgE versus IgG1 BCRs, or constructs in which the migis regions were swapped, into J558L cells, which lack Ig\u03b1 (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hombach et al., 1990</a>). For comparison, we transduced the BCRs into J558L cells in which we had stably transduced Ig\u03b1. Remarkably, the IgE migis made BCR surface expression completely dependent on Ig\u03b1, whereas the IgG1 migis permitted substantial surface BCR localization in the absence of Ig\u03b1 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D and E</a>).

Specifically, we made use of mice with a loxP-flanked B1-8 Ig heavy chain variable region allele\u00a0(B1-8<sup>flox</sup>), which could be deleted with Cre recombinase (<a href=\"#bib37\">Lam et al., 1997</a>). These mice were bred to mice carrying C\u03b31 (<i>Ighg1)</i>-Cre (<a href=\"#bib11\">Casola et al., 2006</a>), which is efficiently induced by anti-CD40 and IL-4, resulting in Cre-mediated deletion of the existing B1-8<sup>flox</sup> BCRs. We retrovirally transduced these cells with new BCRs close in time to the deletion of the existing BCR, mimicking natural CSR. Ectopic expression of BCRs of different isotypes in B1-8<sup>flox/+</sup> C\u03b31<sup>Cre/+</sup> B cells gave similar results to AID-deficient B cells, with IgE promoting a high frequency of antigen-independent PC differentiation, whereas IgG1 promoted antigen-dependent PC differentiation (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). In domain swap experiments in B1-8<sup>flox/+</sup> C\u03b31<sup>Cre/+</sup> cells, the IgE migis region still contributed to antigen-independent PC differentiation, but played a less prominent role than in the AID-deficient B cells, presumably since no IgM was present to compete for Ig\u03b1 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>). Specifically, in IgE BCR constructs with the IgG1 migis, antigen-independent PC differentiation was reduced compared with constructs with the IgE migis, but was still elevated compared with the full IgG1 BCR, suggesting only a partial requirement of the migis region for antigen-independent PC differentiation. In reverse domain swaps in which regions of the IgG1 BCR were substituted with their counterparts in IgE, we observed a synergistic contribution of both the IgE migis and IgE CT to antigen-independent PC differentiation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>). However, when the IgG1 extracellular domains were coupled with the IgE migis, IgE TM, and IgE CT, the frequency of antigen-independent PC differentiation was intermediate between that of the full IgE BCR and IgG1 BCRs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F</a>), again suggesting a contribution of the IgE extracellular domains, which were further explored below. Taken together, these data indicated that the IgE migis and CT both contributed to, but could not fully account for, the antigen-independent activity of the IgE BCR."

The IgE BCR has four extracellular constant region domains (CH1-4), whereas the IgG1 BCR has three domains (CH1-3), with the second domain (CH2) of IgE replaced by a hinge in IgG1 (<a href=\"#bib24\">Gould et al., 2003</a>). As expected, in the context of the IgE migis and CT, which we established above were major contributors to antigen-independent PC differentiation, there was no significant effect of swapping the extracellular domains, although there was a trend suggesting a contribution of the IgE CH2 and CH3 domains (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>). We therefore considered whether a contribution of the extracellular domains could be further revealed in hybrid constructs containing the IgG1 CT, to remove the contribution of the IgE CT. Indeed, both the IgE CH2 and IgE CH3 reproducibly contributed to antigen-independent PC differentiation, as revealed by transducing hybrid constructs in which these domains had been swapped with the IgG1 hinge and CH2, respectively (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>). Thus, multiple parts of the IgE molecule, specifically the CH2, CH3, migis, and CT, all contribute to antigen-independent PC differentiation, making this BCR distinct from the IgG1 BCR."

The surface expression of the transduced IgE and IgG1 BCRs were equivalent to each other, as measured with an antibody to the light chain which pairs with these heavy chains (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). We also compared the surface expression of the transduced BCRs with the endogenous BCRs in normal B cells that had been induced to undergo natural CSR to IgE versus IgG1. We observed that the surface expression of the transduced BCRs was overlapping with the surface expression of normal endogenous IgE BCRs, but less than that of normal endogenous IgG1 BCRs (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). This difference was due to the fact that membrane IgE normally has lower expression than membrane IgG1 (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), as previously reported (<a href=\"#bib28\">He et al., 2013</a>). Therefore, in the transduction system we did not \u2018overexpress\u2019 the BCRs but rather achieved a surface abundance similar to normal membrane IgE. We also noted that the induction of PC differentiation by the IgE BCR occurred over the entire range of surface BCR expression, indicating that small changes in surface expression would be unlikely to impact our results (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). All domain swap constructs had equivalent expression of the Cerulean reporter and achieved measurable surface IgE and/or IgG1 expression within approximately a 4-fold range (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>).

Initial attempts to look at phosphorylation of the downstream signaling adapters such as Syk, Btk, Erk, and Akt, by phosflow failed to show striking differences between IgE<sup>+</sup> and IgG1<sup>+</sup> B cells (data not shown), presumably because many of these phosphorylation events are transient and can only be observed within minutes of strong acute stimulation, whereas the antigen-independent activity may be weaker and constitutive. We therefore considered cumulative readouts of BCR activity. We found that a larger fraction of IgE<sup>+</sup> B cells than IgG1<sup>+</sup> B cells expressed the activation marker CD69 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>), which was particularly apparent with low concentrations of anti-CD40 antibody, since strong CD40 stimulation could itself promote CD69 upregulation (data not shown). Recently, it has been reported that Nur77 upregulation is a readout that is very sensitive to antigen-receptor signaling but only weakly induced by CD40 stimulation (<a href=\"#bib85\">Zikherman et al., 2012</a>). IgE<sup>+</sup> B cells had higher constitutive Nur77 expression than IgG1<sup>+</sup> B cells, as revealed by a Nur77-GFP reporter (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>).

Inhibitors of Syk and PI3Ks, which are critical kinases in BCR signal transduction, also partially inhibited PC differentiation but led to a marked loss of cell viability and thus were not further evaluated (data not shown).

These results suggest that antigen-independent PC differentiation has a differential reliance on particular BCR signaling pathways.

With our retroviral transduction system described above, we ectopically expressed TNP-specific light chains together with TNP-specific heavy chains coupled to IgE versus IgG1 constant regions (with the construct shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). We then treated cells with ibrutinib in order to inhibit Btk, prior to antigen stimulation with TNP-OVA. In the absence of TNP-OVA, ibrutinib treatment reduced antigen-independent PC differentiation mediated by the transduced BCRs, as we had previously observed in normal primary B cells that had undergone natural class switch recombination to IgE and IgG1 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). Interestingly, however, when we added TNP-OVA, antigen-dependent PC differentiation was not significantly affected by ibrutinib treatment (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). To further evaluate the effects of Btk inhibition on constitutive versus antigen-dependent BCR signals, we used the Nur77-GFP reporter to measure BCR signaling activity in B cells carrying the B1-8 Ig heavy chain variable region knock-in specific for 4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenylacetyl\u00a0(NP) when paired with \u03bb light chains. Consistent with our previous results, in the absence of antigen, IgE<sup>+</sup> B cells exhibited higher Nur77-GFP expression than IgG1<sup>+</sup> B cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>). The addition of cognate antigen (NP-OVA) resulted in much stronger GFP expression in antigen-specific B cells of both isotypes (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>). Ibrutinib treatment abrogated Nur77-GFP expression in the absence of antigen, whereas ibrutinib treatment had less pronounced effects on Nur77-GFP expression in the presence of antigen (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>). Taken together, these data indicate that the constitutive activity of the IgE BCR is weaker than antigen-dependent BCR stimulation and is more sensitive to pharmacological inhibition."

                                "text": "Based on our above findings that the IgE BCR has a weak but constitutive activity that is distinct from the IgG1 BCR, we anticipated that perturbing BCR signaling in vivo might have differential effects on IgE versus IgG1 responses. After immunization, BLNK-deficient mice showed a striking increase in IgE<sup>+</sup> B cell frequencies within GCs, compared with no change in IgG1<sup>+</sup> B cell frequencies, in the context of relatively normal total GC B cell numbers (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). BLNK-deficient mice also had an increase in IgE<sup>+</sup> PCs, but not IgG1<sup>+</sup> PCs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). This result differed from cell culture, which we consider in depth below (see the Discussion section). While CD19-deficient mice are defective in T-dependent immune responses in vivo (<a href=\"#bib60\">Rickert et al., 1995</a>) and could not be studied, we tested the role of CD19 by immunizing mice heterozygous for <i>Cd19</i> (<a href=\"#bib60\">Rickert et al., 1995</a>). The two-fold reduction in <i>Cd19</i> in these mice also resulted in a selective increase in the frequency of IgE<sup>+</sup> B cells in GCs, but did not affect the frequency of IgG1<sup>+</sup> B cells nor total GC B cell numbers (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). <i>Cd19</i> heterozygous mice also showed a modest elevation in IgE<sup>+</sup> PCs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Since both BLNK and CD19 are involved in B cell development, which could potentially have an indirect effect on IgE responses, we also tested the effects of transient pharmacological inhibition of BCR signaling. Wild-type mice were immunized and then 6 d later, at the beginning of the GC and PC responses, were treated with ibrutinib to inhibit Btk for 3 d. This inhibition of BCR signaling during an ongoing GC response resulted in a general two-fold reduction in GC cell numbers (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>) as previously reported (<a href=\"#bib47\">Mueller et al., 2015</a>), but there was again a selective increase in the frequency of IgE<sup>+</sup> B cells in GCs, whereas the frequency of IgG1<sup>+</sup> GC B cells was unaffected (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). A trend toward an increase in IgE<sup>+</sup> PCs was also observed in ibrutinib-treated mice, although this did not reach statistical significance (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Since ibrutinib can also inhibit Itk (<a href=\"#bib15\">Dubovsky et al., 2013</a>), which has been implicated in T cell regulation of IgE responses (<a href=\"#bib18\">Felices et al., 2009</a>), we sought to test the effects of BCR signaling perturbation specifically in activated B cells in mice with normal B cell development. In <i>Syk</i><sup>flox/+</sup> C\u03b31<sup>Cre/+</sup> mice, two functional copies of the <i>Syk</i> gene are present in all cells except activated B cells, which express C\u03b31-Cre and become <i>Syk</i> heterozygous. This two-fold decrease in <i>Syk</i> specifically in activated B cells also resulted in a selective increase in the frequency of IgE<sup>+</sup> B cells within GCs, whereas IgG1<sup>+</sup> B cell frequencies were not significantly affected, in the context of slightly elevated total GC B cell numbers (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). IgE<sup>+</sup> PCs, but not IgG1<sup>+</sup> PCs, were elevated as well when activated B cells were <i>Syk</i> heterozygous (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Thus, with four different BCR signaling perturbations, IgE<sup>+</sup> B cell frequencies were selectively elevated in GCs, indicating that in general, BCR signaling negatively regulates IgE<sup>+</sup> GC B cell responses. The effects of these signaling perturbations on IgE<sup>+</sup> PC numbers were variable, possibly reflecting differential requirements for these signaling adapters in antigen-independent versus antigen-dependent PC differentiation (see the Discussion section)."

In vivo, the effects of <i>Irf4</i> heterozygosity were subtle, but we observed a two-fold increase in the frequency of IgE<sup>+</sup> B cells compared with a 10% increase in the frequency of IgG1<sup>+</sup> B cells in GCs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). There was also a trend toward increased IgE<sup>+</sup> PCs when <i>Irf4</i> was made heterozygous, although this did not reach statistical significance (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). The selective increase in IgE<sup>+</sup> B cells in GCs and slight increase in IgE<sup>+</sup> PCs when <i>Irf4</i> was heterozygous resembled our above findings with perturbations in BCR signaling. These findings suggest that <i>Irf4</i> may be one target responsible for the specific effects of BCR signaling on IgE GC and PC responses."

Indeed, IgE<sup>+</sup> PCs can arise both via extrafollicular and GC-derived pathways (<a href=\"#bib82\">Yang et al., 2014</a>). We therefore sought to gain insight into the origin of the IgE<sup>+</sup> PCs that accumulated in some mice with perturbed BCR signaling. The extent of somatic mutation of the antibody variable regions in PCs and GC B cells was assessed in conditional <i>Syk</i> heterozygous and control mice. We sequenced VDJs containing the VH186.2 variable region, which dominates the NP-specific response on the C57BL/6 background (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bothwell, 1984</a>), from individual NP-specific cells. The majority of IgE<sup>+</sup> and IgG1<sup>+</sup> GC B cells carried somatic mutations, as expected, whereas the vast majority of IgE<sup>+</sup> and IgG1<sup>+</sup> PCs had germline sequences at this timepoint (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). This result indicates that the majority of IgE<sup>+</sup> PCs were likely derived from the extrafollicular pathway, suggesting that a two-fold reduction in <i>Syk</i> led to an increase in the IgE<sup>+</sup> PC extrafollicular response. However, there was an increase in the fraction of PCs carrying somatic mutations when the cells were <i>Syk</i> heterozygous. In addition, a substantial fraction of GC B cells still had germline sequences at this timepoint. Therefore, we cannot formally exclude that some of the increase in IgE<sup>+</sup> PCs may have arisen from the enhanced IgE GC response of <i>Syk</i> heterozygous B cells. Overall, our data implicate BCR signaling in the regulation of both extrafollicular and GC pathways of the IgE response. The IgE BCR may therefore have additional influences on in vivo responses distinct from promoting antigen-independent PC differentiation, which we explored further below."

The apoptosis was linked to relocalization of the mitochondrial protein Hax1 (<a href=\"#bib36\">Laffleur et al., 2015</a>), which was reported to bind a sequence found in the CT of the IgE BCR (<a href=\"#bib52\">Oberndorfer et al., 2006</a>). <a href=\"#bib36\">Laffleur et al. (2015)</a> reported that in primary B cell cultures with anti-CD40 and IL-4, upon withdrawal of these stimuli, IgE<sup>+</sup> B cells exhibited increased apoptosis compared with IgG1<sup>+</sup> B cells. However, we were unable to reproduce this result. While withdrawal of anti-CD40 and/or IL-4 led to a general increase in apoptotic cells as measured by annexinV staining, the frequency of apoptotic IgE<sup>+</sup> and IgG1<sup>+</sup> B cells were similar (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Ectopic expression of the IgE BCR in primary B cells also resulted in similar frequencies of apoptosis to ectopic expression of the IgG1 BCR (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B and C</a>). Swapping (constructs 2 and 5) or truncating the IgE CT domain to the short KVK sequence found in IgM (construct 3) also had no significant impact on apoptosis (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B and C</a>). <a href=\"#bib36\">Laffleur et al. (2015)</a> also reported that transfection of the IgE BCR into the A20 B cell line promoted high levels of apoptosis, making it difficult to obtain stable transfectants. While the A20 cell line is not amenable to retroviral transduction, we were able to use this approach to express our constructs in WEHI-231 cells, which are known to readily undergo apoptosis upon BCR cross-linking (<a href=\"#bib7\">Benhamou et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Hasbold and Klaus, 1990</a>). Similar frequencies of apoptosis were observed in WEHI-231 cells transduced with the IgE BCR versus IgG1 BCR or with CT mutant constructs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>), as we had observed in primary B cells. In contrast, anti-IgM treatment induced robust apoptosis of WEHI-231 cells, as expected, confirming the validity of the assay (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>, rightmost panels). The frequency of cells transduced with the IgE BCR was also stable from 3 d to 7 d after transduction (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>), arguing against any deleterious effects of expressing the IgE BCR or its CT. Similar results were also obtained in two other B cell lines, BAL 17 and M12 (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kim et al., 1979</a>;\u00a0data not shown). Notably, <a href=\"#bib36\">Laffleur et al. (2015)</a> had expressed human IgE heavy chains in a mouse B cell line without verifying that the human heavy chains can pair appropriately with mouse BCR components, whereas in our study we expressed normal mouse IgE heavy chains in mouse B cell lines, avoiding this potential technical issue."

Recent studies have demonstrated that selection for high affinity B cells in the GC is linked to differential proliferation rates (<a href=\"#bib21\">Gitlin et al., 2015</a>, <a href=\"#bib22\">2014</a>). Cells with faster cell cycles would outcompete cells with slower cell cycles, which can be measured by administering a pulse of a thymidine analog during S phase and then evaluating cell cycle progression (<a href=\"#bib21\">Gitlin et al., 2015</a>). Using this approach, we immunized mice and 6\u20137 d later, at the peak of the GC response, we injected the thymidine analog EdU to pulse-label cells in S phase. We then waited 3.5 hr to allow cells to variably progress from S phase to the G2, M, and/or G1 phases of the cell cycle, which was assessed by measuring DNA content (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). In wild-type mice, we observed that IgE<sup>+</sup> GC B cells tended to have slower cell cycles than IgG1<sup>+</sup> GC B cells, as revealed by a smaller proportion of EdU<sup>+</sup> cells reaching the G1 phase of the cell cycle in this time window (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A and B</a>). We then tested whether inhibition of Btk with ibrutinib affected the cell cycle speed. Interestingly, ibrutinib treatment resulted in a greater fraction of EdU-labeled cells progressing to the G1 phase of the cell cycle in 3.5 hr, indicating faster cell cycles (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). In ibrutinib-treated mice, IgE<sup>+</sup> and IgG1<sup>+</sup> GC B cells showed equivalent cell cycle speeds (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). Thus, inhibiting BCR signaling actually made IgE<sup>+</sup> GC B cells more competitive with IgG1<sup>+</sup> GC B cells. The observed differences in cell cycle speeds are likely to magnify over multiple cell cycles, as GC B cells have been reported to undergo cell division every 6\u201312 hr (<a href=\"#bib3\">Allen et al., 2007b</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Hauser et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">MacLennan, 1994</a>).

It is thought that the ability of the membrane BCR to bind and endocytose antigen, which is then processed and presented on MHC class II, determines the extent of T cell interactions in the GC (<a href=\"#bib2\">Allen et al., 2007a</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Victora and Nussenzweig, 2012</a>). The BCR was reported to be in lower abundance on the surface of IgE<sup>+</sup> GC B cells compared with IgG1<sup>+</sup> GC B cells (<a href=\"#bib28\">He et al., 2013</a>). In order to confirm this finding, we used an adoptive transfer system in which we tracked antigen-specific B cells. Specifically, Hy10 knock-in B cells (<a href=\"#bib3\">Allen et al., 2007b</a>), specific for avian egg lysozyme, were transferred into congenically-marked mice, which were then immunized with the low affinity antigen duck egg lysozyme (DEL), conjugated to OVA to provide T cell help. We then evaluated BCR surface expression by measuring the capacity for antigen binding. Hy10 IgE<sup>+</sup> and IgG1<sup>+</sup> GC B cells were labeled with fluorescent hen egg lysozyme (HEL), a high affinity antigen. We observed that antigen-specific IgE<sup>+</sup> GC B cells bound 4.4-fold less HEL than antigen-specific IgG1<sup>+</sup> GC B cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D and E</a>), consistent with a four-fold difference reported with a different antigen system (<a href=\"#bib28\">He et al., 2013</a>). We then tested antigen uptake and presentation with the well-established Y-Ae system (<a href=\"#bib20\">Germain and Jenkins, 2004</a>), which has recently been applied to discern differences in the abundance of peptide-MHC complexes on the surface of GC B cells (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bannard et al., 2016</a>). In this system, the Y-Ae antibody recognizes the E\u03b1 peptide presented on the I-A<sup>b</sup> MHC molecule (<a href=\"#bib49\">Murphy et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Rudensky et al., 1991</a>). We conjugated the E\u03b1 peptide to HEL and then administered this reagent in the aforementioned adoptive transfer system. After several hours, allowing time for antigen processing to occur, IgE<sup>+</sup> GC B cells had reduced Y-Ae antibody binding compared with IgG1<sup>+</sup> GC B cells, indicating that IgE<sup>+</sup> GC B cells displayed fewer peptide-MHC complexes (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F and G</a>). Taken together, these data suggest that the low BCR surface expression on IgE<sup>+</sup> GC B cells limits the ability of these cells to compete for T cell help, illuminating an additional mechanism by which the IgE BCR may limit IgE<sup>+</sup> GC B cell responses."

In the presence of stimuli mimicking T cell help, the constitutive activity of the IgE BCR promoted PC differentiation in an antigen-independent manner. In contrast, the IgG1 BCR promoted PC differentiation only when the receptor was ligated with cognate antigen. This difference between the IgE and IgG1 BCRs was attributed to multiple domains, particularly the extracellular membrane-proximal migis region, with further contributions from the IgE CH2 and CH3 extracellular domains and the IgE CT. In cell culture, the BCR signaling adapters BLNK, Btk, CD19, and Syk contributed to antigen-independent PC differentiation mediated by the IgE BCR, with an essential role for CD19. In mice, genetic deficiency or pharmacological inhibition of these signaling components consistently resulted in elevated IgE GC responses, yet IgE PC responses were variably affected. The increased IgE<sup>+</sup> GC B cell responses upon Btk inhibition were associated with accelerated cell cycle progression, suggesting that the reduced competitive fitness of IgE<sup>+</sup> GC B cells is in part due to BCR signaling. In addition, low surface expression of the IgE BCR on GC B cells led to reduced antigen uptake and presentation, likely limiting access to T cell help."

BCRs were known to exhibit tonic signaling, as deletion of the BCR results in rapid B cell death (<a href=\"#bib35\">Kraus et al., 2004</a>). In this study, we reported that the IgE BCR stood out among all isotypes tested as exhibiting the highest capability of inducing antigen-independent PC differentiation. However, our data suggest that the constitutive activity of the IgE BCR is substantially weaker in magnitude than acute antigen stimulation. Interestingly, weak, constitutive BCR activity also promoted the PC differentiation of B cells from mice in which the BCR had been substituted with the latent membrane protein 2A (LMP2A) from Epstein Barr virus (<a href=\"#bib38\">Lechouane et al., 2013</a>). Increased PC differentiation was also reported in a BCR transgenic line with low surface abundance of IgG2a and elevated constitutive activity (<a href=\"#bib43\">Man et al., 2010</a>).

The migis was also a major determinant of BCR surface localization in the presence versus the absence of Ig\u03b1. This finding suggests that the interaction between the BCR and Ig\u03b1 extends beyond the TM domains into the extracellular membrane proximal region. A possible association of the migis region with Ig\u03b1 had been speculated based on experiments with human versus mouse Ig\u03b1 (<a href=\"#bib59\">Reth, 1992</a>). In addition, the migis regions of IgM and IgD were reported to control the glycosylation pattern of Ig\u03b1 (<a href=\"#bib58\">Pogue and Goodnow, 1994</a>). Since our data identified the migis region as an important component of the antigen-independent activity of the IgE BCR, we propose that this region is normally involved in signal transduction upon antigen binding. The migis of IgE had been implicated in signal transduction in a study of simplified BCR molecules in which receptors were cross-linked (<a href=\"#bib57\">Poggianella et al., 2006</a>). Human IgE BCRs contain one of two possible migis regions by alternative splicing, a long versus short form (<a href=\"#bib57\">Poggianella et al., 2006</a>).

It seems plausible that for the membrane IgE BCR, the ability to adopt an asymmetric bend conformation mimics antigen binding.

Indeed, we found it striking that in four different perturbations of BCR signaling, the frequency of IgE<sup>+</sup> B cells within GCs was selectively increased, whereas the frequency of IgG1<sup>+</sup> B cells was not affected.

Specifically, the antigen-independent activity of the IgE BCR is likely to promote the \u2018premature\u2019 terminal differentiation of IgE<sup>+</sup> B cells into PCs. The BCR signaling perturbations may have inhibited this premature terminal differentiation, thereby enabling IgE<sup>+</sup> B cells to undergo further rounds of proliferation, prior to normal antigen-dependent PC differentiation. This model is consistent with our observations that the BCR signaling perturbations did not affect IgG1<sup>+</sup> PC numbers, which our data suggest are generated primarily by antigen-dependent signals. In addition, this model is consistent with our findings regarding IRF4, a transcription factor that is essential for PC differentiation and can be induced by BCR signaling (<a href=\"#bib51\">Nutt et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Ochiai et al., 2013</a>). When activated B cells were made <i>Irf4</i> heterozygous, this resulted in reduced antigen-independent IgE<sup>+</sup> PC differentiation in cell culture but a slight increase, rather than a decrease, in the total number of IgE<sup>+</sup> PCs in immunized mice. Some of the increase in IgE<sup>+</sup> PCs that we observed with various perturbations in mice could be a consequence of enhanced IgE<sup>+</sup> GC B cell responses, but our somatic hypermutation analysis suggests this cannot fully explain the results, since most IgE<sup>+</sup> PCs had germline sequences whereas most IgE<sup>+</sup> GC B cells had somatic mutations. Another possibility is that the BCR signaling perturbations could have a direct impact on the proliferation or longevity of the IgE<sup>+</sup> PCs, which have high surface expression of the IgE BCR. The BCR signaling perturbations could also have affected the rate of CSR to IgE, as PI3K signaling has been reported to negatively regulate CSR (<a href=\"#bib54\">Omori et al., 2006</a>). Overall, our data are most consistent with the model that perturbations in BCR signaling led to delayed terminal differentiation of IgE<sup>+</sup> B cells, enabling further rounds of proliferation and the generation of longer-lived PCs."

Our mutational analysis revealed that most of the IgE<sup>+</sup> PCs were derived from the extrafollicular pathway at the timepoint in which we could observe increases in IgE<sup>+</sup> GC B cells, suggesting that BCR signaling also has a direct impact on the GC response. One group proposed that IgE<sup>+</sup> B cells are progressively lost from GCs due to low BCR surface expression, leading to reduced BCR signaling and apoptosis (<a href=\"#bib28\">He et al., 2013</a>). However, using similar methods to detect apoptotic B cells, we were unable to replicate the finding that IgE<sup>+</sup> B cells had higher rates of apoptosis compared with IgG1<sup>+</sup> B cells in GCs. A caveat to these disparate findings is that the ex vivo analysis of the apoptosis of GC B cells may be hampered by the rapid uptake of apoptotic cell fragments by tingible body macrophages (<a href=\"#bib41\">MacLennan, 1994</a>). In contrast, the analysis of apoptosis in cultured B cells should be more robust. Yet, in cell culture studies, we were also unable to observe an increased rate of apoptosis in IgE<sup>+</sup> B cells compared with IgG1<sup>+</sup> B cells, in contrast to a recent study (<a href=\"#bib36\">Laffleur et al., 2015</a>). We further verified that the ectopic expression of the IgE BCR in primary B cells did not promote apoptosis in cell culture. In addition, while a recent study reported that IgE BCR expression promoted the apoptosis of a B cell line (<a href=\"#bib36\">Laffleur et al., 2015</a>), we were unable to replicate this result in three different B cell lines. Consistent with our observations, a study of isotype-specific BCR signaling reported no difficulty in expressing the IgE BCR in B cell lines (<a href=\"#bib64\">Sato et al., 2007</a>). A possible explanation for the apoptosis due to the IgE BCR observed in the <a href=\"#bib36\">Laffleur et al. (2015)</a> study was that the human IgE BCR was expressed in mouse B cells. The human IgE heavy chain may not appropriately pair with key accessory proteins in mouse cells, such as the mouse Ig light chains or mouse Ig\u03b1, which could affect BCR surface localization. We also observed that the progressive loss of IgE<sup>+</sup> B cells from GCs could not be prevented by overexpression of the anti-apoptotic gene <i>Bcl2</i>, in contrast to our prior results demonstrating that short-lived IgE<sup>+</sup> PCs were rescued from apoptosis. Similarly, another group reported that IgE<sup>+</sup> GC B cells were very rare in mice deficient in the death receptor Fas, despite exaggerated IgE<sup>+</sup> PC responses (<a href=\"#bib10\">Butt et al., 2015</a>).

We favor a model in which constitutive signaling by the IgE BCR delays the progression of IgE<sup>+</sup> GC B cells through the G2/M phases of the cell cycle.

IgE<sup>+</sup> B cells, at a disadvantage for T cell help, might thus show reduced evidence of light zone to dark zone transit.

This group also reported that the IgE BCR promoted apoptosis; however, we were not able to observe this effect in any of our in vitro or in vivo assays. As in our domain swap studies, this study identified the IgE migis region as critical for antigen-independent PC differentiation. The IgE migis was reported by Haniuda et al. to influence the BCR association with CD19, which we propose would be secondary to the interaction with Ig\u03b1 that we identified here. The extracellular domains of IgE were also implicated in the autonomous activity of the IgE BCR in this paper, which here we have further defined as specifically the CH2 and CH3 domains of IgE. The authors also reported a modest impact of deleting the IgE CT but did not test swapping this domain with that of IgG1, as we reported here. Another distinct feature of our work presented here is the microscopy studies of the mobility and clustering of the IgE BCR, which were not examined by Haniuda et al. While both groups observed increased IgE<sup>+</sup> GC B cells in <i>Cd19</i>-heterozygous and BLNK-deficient mice, our conclusions differed with respect to IgE<sup>+</sup> PC responses. Haniuda et al. reported a decreased IgE PC/GC ratio in <i>Cd19</i>-heterozygous mice as evidence of decreased PC generation; however, this ratio was likely affected primarily by the increased number of IgE<sup>+</sup> GC B cells, since we actually observed a modest increase, rather than a decrease, in IgE<sup>+</sup> PC numbers in these mice. We were also not able to reproduce the decrease in IgE<sup>+</sup> PCs reported in BLNK-deficient mice and instead we observed a striking increase in IgE<sup>+</sup> PCs. We further tested the in vivo impact of inhibiting Btk as well as deletion of a single copy of <i>Syk</i> and <i>Irf4</i>, which also led to increased IgE<sup>+</sup> GC B cell responses but inconsistent effects on IgE<sup>+</sup> PCs. While we support the idea that the autonomous activity of the IgE BCR can promote short-lived PC differentiation, the uncoupling of IgE<sup>+</sup> GC B cell and PC responses in our studies suggested that BCR signaling has other impacts on IgE<sup>+</sup> GC responses.

Upon CSR to IgE, a B cell will begin to express the IgE BCR, which has distinct constitutive activity. If this B cell receives T cell help, this BCR activity will promote PC differentiation. However, if this B cell does not receive T cell help, this BCR activity will delay cell cycle progression, causing the B cell to be outcompeted by clones expressing other isotypes. In this way, the constitutive activity of the IgE BCR makes cell fate relatively independent of antigen stimulation of the BCR, but rather highly dependent on antigen presentation and T cell help. Thus, the availability of T cell help may be a major mechanism for controlling IgE B cell responses. The chronic activity of the IgE BCR leads to surface BCR downmodulation, reducing antigen uptake and presentation, thus making it less likely that the cell will receive T cell help. Premature PC differentiation, delayed cell cycle progression, and limited T cell help due to IgE BCR expression all result in the progressive decline in IgE<sup>+</sup> GC B cells and prevent the generation of IgE<sup>+</sup> memory B cells and long-lived PCs, thereby reducing the average affinity and overall duration of the IgE response."

With the exception of the apoptosis analyses described below, nonviable cells were excluded by labeling cells during surface staining with the fixable viability dye eFluor780 (eBioscience) as described (<a href=\"#bib83\">Yang et al., 2012</a>). Intracellular IgE staining was as described (<a href=\"#bib83\">Yang et al., 2012</a>). Briefly, cell surface IgE was first blocked with a large excess of unconjugated anti-IgE antibody RME-1 (RRID:<a href=\"https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_315073\">AB_315073</a>, BioLegend) during surface staining, then cells were fixed and permeabilized using the Cytofix/Cytoperm Fixation/Permeabilization solution kit (BD Biosciences). Then intracellular IgE was stained with fluorescently-labeled RME-1 (see <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). For the detection of NP-binding cells, APC (ProZyme) was conjugated to the succinimidyl ester of NP (NP-Osu; Biosearch Technologies) at a ratio of 1 mg APC to 80 \u00b5g NP-Osu as described (<a href=\"#bib46\">McHeyzer-Williams and McHeyzer-Williams, 2004</a>) and then purified on Bio-Spin 6 or Bio-Spin 30 spin columns (Bio-Rad) equilibrated with PBS. For the preparation of HEL-Alexa 647, lyophilized HEL (Sigma-Aldrich) was resuspended at 1.1 mg/mL in DPBS (Life Technologies), and then diluted with 10% v/v 1 M sodium bicarbonate. To this solution, an 8.8-fold molar excess of Alexa Fluor 647 carboxylic acid, succinimidyl ester (Life Technologies) was added. After incubation at room temperature for two hours with gentle mixing, excess free Alexa Fluor 647 dye was removed by passing the solution through two Bio-Spin 6 columns (Bio-Rad) equilibrated with PBS. Flow cytometry data were collected on an LSR Fortessa (BD) and analyzed with FlowJo v10. All samples were gated on FSC-A versus SSC-A, over a broad range of FSC-A to include blasting lymphocytes, followed by FSC-W versus FSC-H and then SSC-W versus SSC-H gates to exclude doublets. Some two dimensional plots are shown with \u2018large dots\u2019 for better visualization of rare events."

The primary B cells were then fixed and permeabilized for IgE and IgG1 staining. For the ex vivo analysis of apoptosis in GC B cells, after surface staining, fixed and permeabilized cells from draining LNs were stained with anti-activated caspase 3 antibody (RRID:<a href=\"https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_1727414\">AB_1727414</a>, clone C92-605, BD Biosciences). Alternatively, cell suspensions from draining LNs were incubated with FITC-VAD-FMK (BioVision) at 37\u00b0C for 30\u2019, washed once with the buffer included in the CaspGLOW kit (BioVision), and then surface stained with annexin V and for other markers, followed by intracellular staining for IgE and total IgG1, as described above. Our FSC-A and SSC-A gating strategy involved a broad FSC-A gate for lymphocytes that included both viable and recently apoptotic cells, but did not include small cell fragments which tended to be autofluorescent and nonspecifically bound to\u00a0antibodies, which would have confounded analysis."

To ensure acquiring sufficient events of IgE<sup>+</sup> B cells, 50 million cells from the draining LNs of each mouse were processed. Consequently, intracellular IgE and total IgG1 were stained as described above, but in the Click-iT saponin-based permeabilization and wash buffer. Finally DAPI was added to label DNA to determine the fraction of cells in the G1, S, and G2/M phases of the cell cycle. The final concentration of DAPI was adjusted to achieve a similar fluorescence intensity of the G1 peak and the signal was collected on a linear scale at the LO speed setting to maximize resolution. Doublets were excluded by FSC-W, SSC-W, and DAPI-W measurements."

Cells were allowed to adhere for five mins and then imaged live at 37\u00b0C. TIRF\u00a0microscopy images were captured by an Olympus IX-81 microscope supported by ANDOR iXon+ DU-897D electron-multiplying EMCCD camera, a 514 nm laser, a 568 nm laser, Olympus 100\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01.45 N.A. objective lens and a TIRF port.

We performed this analysis with conditional <i>Syk</i> heterozygous versus control mice as suggested. The data are now included as <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>. We did this analysis at 9 days after immunization, consistent with all of the in vivo analyses in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, which had shown a consistent increase in IgE<sup>+</sup> GC B cells and variable increases in IgE<sup>+</sup> PCs under various BCR signaling perturbations. Interestingly, at this timepoint, more than 90% of IgE<sup>+</sup> and IgG1<sup>+</sup> PCs had germline sequences, suggesting they were from the extrafollicular pathway. However, a substantial fraction of GC B cells also had germline sequences, leaving open the possibility that some fraction of the PCs were GC-derived. In addition, some increase in the frequency of PCs with somatic mutations was observed in the conditional <i>Syk</i> heterozygous mice. The implication of these findings is that BCR signaling perturbations affect IgE responses in both the extrafollicular and GC pathways. We have revised the text of the manuscript accordingly."
