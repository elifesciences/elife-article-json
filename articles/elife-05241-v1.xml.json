Here, we elucidate the transformation of visual signals flowing from the input to the output of the primate retina, using a combination of large-scale multi-electrode recordings from an identified ganglion cell type, visual stimulation targeted at individual cone photoreceptors, and a hierarchical computational model. The results reveal nonlinear subunits in the circuity of OFF midget ganglion cells, which subserve high-resolution vision. The model explains light responses to a variety of stimuli more accurately than a linear model, including stimuli targeted to cones within and across subunits. The recovered model components are consistent with known anatomical organization of midget bipolar interneurons. These results reveal the spatial structure of linear and nonlinear encoding, at the resolution of single cells and at the scale of complete circuits."

Here, we elucidate the transformation of visual signals flowing from the input to the output of the primate retina, using a combination of large-scale multi-electrode recordings from an identified ganglion cell type, visual stimulation targeted at individual cone photoreceptors, and a hierarchical computational model. The results reveal nonlinear subunits in the circuity of OFF midget ganglion cells, which subserve high-resolution vision. The model explains light responses to a variety of stimuli more accurately than a linear model, including stimuli targeted to cones within and across subunits. The recovered model components are consistent with known anatomical organization of midget bipolar interneurons. These results reveal the spatial structure of linear and nonlinear encoding, at the resolution of single cells and at the scale of complete circuits."

Large arrays of electrodes were used to record the responses of many retinal ganglion cells in response to the activation or de-activation of pairs of cones. These experiments revealed that the responses of ganglion cells are not simply the sum of the inputs that they receive from cones; specifically, the activation of one cone is not cancelled by the deactivation of another. Instead, the data suggest that bipolar cells add cone inputs together and then pass on the total activation (but not deactivation) to ganglion cells."

It also suggests that similar approaches may be used to characterize how signals flow across other brain networks in which large-scale recordings are now possible."

A notable example is the <i>nonlinear subunit</i> computation (<a href=\"#bib34\">Hochstein and Shapley, 1976</a>) observed in the responses of several types of RGCs, the output neurons of the retina. In these cell types, the circuitry composing the RGC receptive field does not linearly integrate cone photoreceptor inputs over space, as assumed by simplified descriptive models (<a href=\"#bib16\">Chichilnisky, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Keat et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Pillow et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Field et al., 2010</a>).

First, subsets of one or more cones are assigned to \u2018subunits\u2019, which are assumed to be non-overlapping to ensure unique solutions during fitting, that is, a cone cannot provide input to multiple subunits (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019); this assumption is biologically sensible given evidence for minimal overlap in bipolar dendritic trees (<a href=\"#bib79\">W\u00e4ssle et al., 1994</a>) and little divergence from cones to OFF midget bipolar cells (<a href=\"#bib41\">Kolb and Marshak, 2003</a>). Signals from cones within a subunit are weighted and linearly combined. Second, a common nonlinear transformation is applied to the outputs of these subunits (<a href=\"#bib2\">Ahrens et al., 2008</a>). Finally, the model computes a weighted sum of subunit responses, meant to reflect the convergence of bipolar cells onto the ganglion cell, and this summed response is subjected to an output nonlinearity that produces a non-negative spike rate.

Responses to gratings were measured in 32 OFF midget RGCs from one retina. RGCs exhibited clear signs of nonlinear integration (see <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a> for an example cell). At low spatial frequencies (period matched approximately to the size of the receptive field), responses were modulated at the temporal frequency of the stimulus. But at higher spatial frequencies, their responses were modulated at twice the temporal frequency of the stimulus, for at least some spatial phases. The rectifying nonlinearities within the fitted subunit model were sufficient to predict this frequency doubling, whereas the LN model exhibited dominant response modulation at the frequency of the stimulus (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Across the population, accuracy of the subunit model was 83 \u00b1 1% <i>R</i><sup><i>2</i></sup> adj.

Improvement was more pronounced at higher spatial frequencies (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>), ranging from 10 \u00b1 1% (at a frequency where one cycle spanned the entire RF) to 50 \u00b1 6% (at a frequency where each cycle spanned 1\u20132 cones), and was significant at all frequencies (paired t-test, p &lt; 0.0001). A qualitatively similar pattern of results was observed in a second retina (data not shown). Especially for the higher spatial frequencies, the difference between models for gratings was qualitatively more pronounced than for noise stimuli (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>), suggesting that stimuli with extended spatial structure help highlight differences between model predictions."

The functional connectivity of the fitted model provides, for each recorded retina, a prediction of the number of cones per bipolar cell (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). This allowed a comparison between the anatomical connectivity and the functional connectivity predicted by the full subunit model. Note that comparing the number of subunits rather than cone convergence onto subunits is approximately equivalent, because midget bipolar cells tile the retina with a coverage factor of \u223c1 and without overlap (<a href=\"#bib79\">W\u00e4ssle et al., 1994</a>). For RGCs at small eccentricities, the fraction of subunits recovered by the model including 1\u20132 cones was consistent with the fraction expected based on anatomical observations made separately (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). For larger eccentricities, the model recovered larger subunits, also generally in agreement with anatomical observations.

We fitted and validated the model using a comprehensive stimulus ensemble, including noise, gratings, and targeted stimuli that highlighted the nonlinear responses. Together, these results provide a picture of the spatial circuit structure of three major stages of visual processing in the primate retina."

In the cat retina, \u2018X\u2019 cells were defined as those that sum visual input linearly within the spatial receptive field, whereas \u2018Y\u2019 cells were defined as those that exhibited nonlinear behaviors (notably, frequency-doubling) (<a href=\"#bib26\">Enroth-Cugell and Robson, 1966</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Hochstein and Shapley, 1976</a>). These functionally defined classes have been associated with the morphologically distinct beta and alpha RGCs (<a href=\"#bib9\">Boycott and W\u00e4ssle, 1974</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Peichl and W\u00e4ssle, 1981</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">W\u00e4ssle et al., 1981a</a>, <a href=\"#bib77\">1981b</a>). Subsequent work aimed to establish a similar dichotomy in the primate retina (<a href=\"#bib27\">Field and Chichilnisky, 2007</a>). The magnocellular-projecting parasol RGCs have been shown to exhibit nonlinearities similar to Y cells. In contrast, the parvocellular-projecting midget RGCs have usually been likened to linear X cells (<a href=\"#bib66\">Shapley et al., 1981</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Kaplan and Shapley, 1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Derrington and Lennie, 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Levitt et al., 2001</a>). The nonlinearities revealed here (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1, 4, 6</a>) are inconsistent with this interpretation, as are previous in vivo studies of parvocellular-projecting cells (<a href=\"#bib23\">Derrington and Lennie, 1984</a>) and ex vivo studies of midget RGCs (<a href=\"#bib55\">Petrusca et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Cafaro and Rieke, 2013</a>), which demonstrated modest but clear frequency-doubling in response to contrast reversing visual stimuli. Two factors may explain these discrepancies. First, many previous in vivo studies probed midget cell responses in the central retina, where the receptive field center consists of a single cone, and thus, a single subunit. In such cases, the entire receptive field is formed by the cone collecting aperture, and would be expected to exhibit the linear summation of incident light intensity performed by the cone. Second, in vivo studies were typically performed using anesthetics that could raise the basal release of neurotransmitter from bipolar cells, and low basal release rates are thought to underlie at least part of the rectifying subunit nonlinearity (<a href=\"#bib60\">Robbins and Ikeda, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Demb et al., 2001</a>). Indeed, variability in basal release rates could account for some of the variability across preparations observed here (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3D, 6</a>)."

The most commonly stated defining characteristic for Y cells is a frequency doubled response to a contrast reversing grating, with a magnitude that is independent of the spatial phase of the stimulus (<a href=\"#bib26\">Enroth-Cugell and Robson, 1966</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Hochstein and Shapley, 1976</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Crook et al., 2008</a>). Although midget cells exhibited frequency doubling in response to contrast reversing gratings (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>), the magnitude was phase dependent (not shown). Phase dependence may arise both from the low occurrence of multi-cone subunits, and the fact that midget cells receive input from only one bipolar cell type, which forms a single mosaic with minimal dendritic overlap (<a href=\"#bib79\">W\u00e4ssle et al., 1994</a>). In contrast, the ON and OFF parasol RGC populations, which exhibit properties consistent with the Y cell definition (<a href=\"#bib55\">Petrusca et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Crook et al., 2008</a>), receive input primarily from two bipolar cell types (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bordt et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Calkins and Sterling, 2007</a>), each of which receive convergent input from many cones, and overlap each other in space, and thus would be expected to exhibit greater phase invariance. Lack of phase independence in midget cells may also arise from differences between feed-forward and crossover inhibition that shapes midget vs parasol RGC responses respectively (<a href=\"#bib12\">Cafaro and Rieke, 2013</a>)."

The firing rates obtained in the present work are somewhat lower than those found in anesthetized in vivo recordings (<a href=\"#bib71\">Troy and Lee, 1994</a>). Nonlinear spatial summation (as in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>) was observed in midget cells exhibiting a range of spontaneous firing rates from 0 to 10 spikes/s (not shown). It remains uncertain whether and to what degree these ex vivo recordings, or in vivo recordings under anesthesia, reflect a more natural state with respect to the signals studied. The confirmation of the biological relevance of nonlinear signaling by OFF midget cells awaits a decisive test in awake behaving animals."

But it differs in several essential aspects. First, the model expresses subunit computations directly in terms of elementary circuit components: photoreceptors, inferred bipolar cells, and ganglion cells. Combined with precise experimental control, this approach bridges the gap between abstract functional models and detailed circuit computations, and may thus complement the growing number of tools available for manipulating neurons and circuits. Second, unlike some previous efforts to characterize subunits (<a href=\"#bib75\">Victor and Shapley, 1979b</a>), all components of the model used here were fitted based on a single ensemble of stimuli and spiking responses, rather than inferred separately based on responses to specialized stimuli. Simultaneous fitting is a generally preferable strategy for optimization, because it allows the parameters to work together to explain observed responses. Finally, unlike some approaches (e.g., spike-triggered covariance [<a href=\"#bib69\">Strong et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Brenner et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Rust et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Touryan et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Pillow and Simoncelli, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Schwartz et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Chen et al., 2007</a>] or maximally-informative dimensions [<a href=\"#bib67\">Sharpee et al., 2004</a>]), which have recovered stimulus features that are unique only up to an arbitrary linear transformation, this method recovers a unique solution for the spatial structure of subunits."

While elegant, iso-response contour mapping has only proven practically useful with stimuli defined in two or three dimensions (<a href=\"#bib6\">B\u00f6linger and Gollisch, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Horwitz and Hass, 2012</a>), whereas the current model operated on the full set of cone inputs to each RGC (typically 5\u201315 dimensions). Another study (<a href=\"#bib65\">Schwartz et al., 2012</a>) developed a model for responses of ON alpha-like mouse RGCs by combining detailed morphological measurements with direct physiological measurements from bipolars and RGCs. The functional approach taken here, while lacking the firm anatomical foundation, can extend more readily to describing computations in complete neuronal populations (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>) and in multiple cell types."

A study of cone electrical coupling in primate retina suggested that signal mixing is modest (<a href=\"#bib35\">Hornstein et al., 2004</a>), thus it is probably unable to account for the cancellation observed. However, that study was performed in dark-adapted retina, whereas the results reported here were obtained in light-adapted retina; coupling may depend on light adaptation and the circadian cycle (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bloomfield and V\u00f6lgyi, 2009</a>) (but see <a href=\"#bib35\">Hornstein et al., 2004</a>). Thus, it is difficult to entirely rule out a contribution of cone coupling. However, since many cone pairs tested exhibited little or no cancellation (e.g., <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>), any effects of adjacent cone coupling are likely to be weak or sporadic. In contrast to this prediction, connexin-36 immunolabeling revealed ubiquitous expression at junctions between nearly all neighboring cones, in both central and peripheral primate retina (<a href=\"#bib50\">O'Brien et al., 2012</a>). Also, the observed eccentricity dependence of the spatial extent of cancellation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>) implies that for the present results to be explained by cone coupling, the coupling would have to increase substantially with eccentricity."

For example, unlike midget RGCs, parasol RGCs receive input from more than one type of bipolar cell, and the receptive fields of these bipolar cells likely exhibit substantial spatial overlap, whereas the current model assumes nonoverlapping subunits (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). Indeed, preliminary model fits of parasol responses produce subunits smaller than what is expected from anatomical data, as would be expected in the case of two overlapping bipolar populations (<a href=\"#bib10\">Boycott and W\u00e4ssle, 1991</a>) (not shown).

Incorporating inhibitory interneurons could also improve the accuracy of subunit estimation, if other components in the current model are indirectly absorbing their effects. In some stimulus regimes, it may also be important to incorporate nonlinearities in cone signals. Specifically, the logic of the linearity test (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>), and the structure of the model (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>), assume linearity of the cone signal, which is a reasonable approximation for weak stimuli (<a href=\"#bib62\">Schnapf et al., 1990</a>), but fails for stronger stimuli (J Angueyra and F Rieke, personal communication). This may account for the moderately lower predictive accuracy of the model when fit to noise and tested on stronger increment-decrement stimuli (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). The model would also be enhanced by allowing for temporal nonlinearities (rather than static ones) (<a href=\"#bib8\">Borghuis et al., 2013</a>), post-spike temporal filtering (<a href=\"#bib57\">Pillow et al., 2008</a>), more complex spike generation, and perhaps nonlinearities that vary across subunits. More generally, the model should be extended to include mechanisms for luminance and contrast gain control (<a href=\"#bib46\">Mante et al., 2008</a>), both of which are essential for natural vision. All of these extensions would require new targeted stimulus ensembles and model fitting procedures, and together provide an exciting direction for future research."

For initial characterization with large pixels, the intensity of each display primary at each pixel location was independently chosen from a binary distribution, yielding a stimulus with chromatic variation. For high resolution characterization of individual cones, the intensities of the display primaries were modulated in unison in most experiments (13 of 15). This yielded a black-white binary intensity modulation with higher variance and thus greater modulation of RGC responses. In the other two experiments, the display primaries were modulated independently of one another. In both conditions, the contrast of each primary (difference between the maximum and minimum intensities divided by the sum) was 96%. For low spatial resolution receptive field maps used for classification (not shown), the pixels were 25.5 or 34 \u03bcm on a side, the stimulus refresh rate was 20, 30, or 60 Hz, and recording duration was 30 min. For high resolution maps (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1, 3, 4</a>), the pixels were 3.4 \u03bcm on a side, the stimulus refresh rate was 10, 12, or 15 Hz, and recording duration was 30\u201360 min (depending on the experiment). High resolution spatial receptive fields shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1, 3, 4</a> were calculated by collapsing the spike-triggered average over time. For this purpose, the time course was calculated from the average of a subset of stimulus pixels whose absolute peak intensity exceeded four robust standard deviations of all pixel intensities."

Briefly, the linear spatial receptive field of each cone was modeled as a gaussian, and the linear spatial receptive field of each RGC was modeled as a sum of cones. For each retina, a mosaic of cones was greedily chosen to maximize the likelihood of spiking responses across all reliably identified cells (including multiple types). After identifying cone locations, the high-resolution noise stimulus was integrated against the Gaussian profile of each cone, to obtain a set of cone input signals for each RGC. These signals were then convolved in time with the temporal component of the spike-triggered average, effectively aligning the stimulus with the response in time. All modeling subsequently focused only on the spatial component of the response. Spikes were binned by the timing of stimulus frames, which across experiments was typically 12 Hz (83 ms bins). This spatial and temporal preprocessing yielded, for each RGC, a <i>C</i> \u00d7 <i>T</i> stimulus matrix <b><i>X</i></b>, where <i>C</i> is the number of cones providing input to that RGC, and <i>T</i> is the number of stimulus frames in the experiment, and a <i>T</i> \u00d7 1 vector <b><i>y</i></b> of spike counts. These preprocessing steps assume a linear model of the ganglion cell response, but linear analysis is adequate for the purpose of cone localization, because it only requires that each cone provides non-zero input to at least one ganglion cell, which will be true for most monotonic non-linearities; the same procedure was also anatomically validated in previous work (<a href=\"#bib58\">Field et al., 2010</a>)."

From amongst these held out stimuli, we selected the 20% individual stimulus frames for which the squared difference in the prediction of the two models was largest. Selecting stimuli by individual frames was appropriate because stimuli were preprocessed to have a one-to-one correspondence with the response at each frame. Performance of both models was then compared to actual neural response on these stimuli. This selection does not favor either model a priori, because it is not based on their performance in explaining the data, but only on how much their predictions differ."

With parallelization, hundreds of RGCs from an entire retina could be fit in under 10 min. Once model fits were obtained for every RGC, several RGCs (5\u201310) with high SNR and a variety of subunit configurations were chosen for targeted single cone and paired cone stimulation. Chosen RGCs were at least two cell spacings away from each other, to minimize the impact of stimulating cones lying in the receptive field surround of any of the chosen RGCs. Typically four cones were chosen per RGC. For simplicity, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a> only reports data for the three cones per RGC showing the strongest response to single-cone stimulation, but the quantitative analysis (see below) included all cones tested. Cone location analyses generated stimulus screen coordinates for the center of every cone found in the mosaic. Coordinates of cones within the receptive field of the chosen RGCs were then used to specify regions of the screen selected to stimulate single cones, as follows. Depending on cone spacing in each preparation, spots of radius 7.65\u20139.35 \u03bcm were generated around each cone center location. The full native screen resolution was used (pixels 1.7 \u03bcm on a side). For cases in which cone spacing was close enough that the resulting regions would overlap, pixels were assigned to whichever competing cone had the nearest center coordinates. Single cones were then stimulated with uniform contrast steps over the defined regions. Recording trials were 750 ms long with the stimulus presentation occurring in the first 250 ms. Stimulation region (i.e., choice of cone) and contrast were randomized across trials. Control experiments in which light stimuli were presented within the spaces in between cones demonstrated the specificity of this stimulation (<a href=\"#bib43a\">Li et al., 2014</a>)."

For each such selected cone, the firing rate response to single or paired stimulations were averaged across repeated trials (typically 20\u201340) and within a 300 ms time window following stimulus presentation. These four firing rates were then divided by their maximum. This normalization served to emphasize the relative effect of pairing increments with a decrement of light, as well as correct for differences in effective cone strength between measurement and model due to, for example, small movement of the retina in between stimulus presentations. For each RGC, model predictions were generated by providing negative or positive inputs to the same combination of cones tested in the experiment. The predictions were then similarly divided by the maximum predicted firing rate for each cone. Finally, the predictive accuracy was computed as the square of the correlation coefficient between predicted and measured response across all cone pairs. Given the non-normal estimator of interest (a difference of correlation coefficients), a bootstrap test was used to compare predictions of the different models\u2014full subunit, single-cone subunit, and LN. On each iteration of a bootstrap, cone pairs were randomly sampled with replacement across RGCs, accuracies for all models were reestimated (as above), and the differences in accuracy between models were computed. The accuracies were considered significantly different if the fifth percentile of the resulting distribution of differences exceeded 0."

A possible explanation for such large subunits could lie in gap-junction among photoreceptors. Ideally one would test this possibility experimentally, e.g. by adding dopamine D1 agonist or antagonist to modulate the gap-junctional link among photoreceptors (or at least test with the model if cones that are associated in one subunit for an OFF RGC tend to be associated as one subunit for an overlapping ON RGC?). Another possible explanation lies in amacrine cells feeding signals from surrounding bipolar cells. These cells are currently not considered in the model, and might result in single subunits pooling from very large photoreceptors sets in the model. Another possibility, which is not possible to rule out given the way the model is explained, is that some sort of constraint (or minimization) is posed on the number subunits (bipolar cells), leading to artifactually large subunits. Finally, if data are available from a region closer to the fovea, it would be very interesting to see whether the model is able to capture the relationship between 1 photoreceptor \u2013 1 bipolar cell \u2013 1 retinal ganglion cell."

This is a key issue, and if one wanted to prove it one could perhaps add the same anesthetics to the in vitro retina as used during in vivo recordings. The alternative explanation is that it is the in vitro condition that somehow distorts the nonlinearity. The washout of neuromodulators could be a source of variability in ex vivo preps, too. In the absence of experimental data, this issue needs to be treated in a more balanced way, and both possibilities kept open."

A simple linear STA analysis is adequate for the purpose of cone localization because it relies only on each cone providing, on average, a non-zero input to the response of at least one ganglion cell. While there are some classes of subunit nonlinearities that could in principle cause cones to be missed in the STA calculation (e.g. full-wave rectification), in practice most monotonic nonlinearities, including half rectification, which appears to dominate in midget cell responses, will not do so. Note that the <a href=\"#bib58\">Field et al. (2010)</a> paper developed this method, and showed that the estimated locations were in close correspondence with anatomical measurements. The use of the STA to estimate cone size/extent is justified because each cone combines the pixel intensities within its aperture approximately linearly (<a href=\"#bib62\">Schnapf, et al. 1990</a>, Visual Transduction of Cones in the Monkey). Finally, convolving with the temporal component of the STA primarily served only to align stimulus and response times, and all subsequent aspects of the analysis focused entirely on the spatial component of the response."

Although the reviewers are presumably advocating for treating the issue in Results, we chose to handle it in the Discussion and continue to favor doing so. There is a developed literature on midget/P-cells and their similarity to cat X-cells. We have reviewed this literature and find that most previous in vivo studies measured frequency doubling in P-cells at eccentricities &lt;10 deg (e.g. <a href=\"#bib39\">Kaplan and Shapley 1982</a> and <a href=\"#bib43\">Levitt et al. 2001</a>). At these eccentricities, the vast majority of macaque-midget RGCs receive input from just one cone (<a href=\"#bib41\">Kolb and Marshak 2001</a>). With a single cone in the receptive field, there is no possibility of a spatial (Y-like) non-linearity in the receptive field center, because the cone integrates light linearly over its collecting aperture (<a href=\"#bib62\">Schnapf, et al. 1990</a>, Visual Transduction of Cones in the Monkey). One previous in vivo study in which P-cells were studied over a larger range of eccentricities (0-30 deg) did find midget cells with a substantial second harmonic response to contrast reversing gratings (<a href=\"#bib23\">Derrington and Lennie 1984</a>). Although this point was not strongly emphasized in the Abstract, it is clear in the data (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2 and 6</a>). The authors did not analyze the magnitude of the second harmonic as a function of eccentricity, but their results appear consistent with those presented here as well as other previous ex vivo studies from the peripheral primate retina (Petrusca et al. 2006, <a href=\"#bib12\">Cafaro and Rieke 2013</a>). Our interpretation is that the apparent discrepancy probably results from the fact that midget cells appear X-like when they sample from only one cone, while spatial non-linearies are revealed at eccentricities where they sample from multiple cones. In other words, there is no factual disagreement with the literature, and our results point to a possibly nearly ubiquitous mechanism in RGCs. This point is discussed in detail in the second paragraph of the Discussion."

Namely, a decrement of light presented to one cone in the receptive field center enhances the response to a simultaneously presented increment presented to another cone (this was not found in any OFF midget cells). We are currently investigating the possibility that this is caused by a RF surround within the subunit, facilitating the response of the RF center of the subunit. To explore this issue fully will require a more sophisticated model, novel fitting approaches, and a collection of additional experiments. Thus we view it as beyond the scope of this manuscript.

A possible explanation for such large subunits could lie in gap-junction among photoreceptors. Ideally one would test this possibility experimentally, e.g. by adding dopamine D1 agonist or antagonist to modulate the gap-junctional link among photoreceptors (or at least test with the model if cones that are associated in one subunit for an OFF RGC tend to be associated as one subunit for an overlapping ON RGC?). Another possible explanation lies in amacrine cells feeding signals from surrounding bipolar cells. These cells are currently not considered in the model, and might result in single subunits pooling from very large photoreceptors sets in the model. Another possibility, which is not possible to rule out given the way the model is explained, is that some sort of constraint (or minimization) is posed on the number subunits (bipolar cells), leading to artifactually large subunits.

There are several possible mechanistic underpinnings of the large receptive field subunits observed for some cells (we assume that the reviewers are referring to <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). The reviewers suggest testing the role of gap junctions by modulating cone-cone gap junctions with D1 agonist or antagonists. This is an interesting idea and one that is worth pursuing, but it requires an extensive repeat of all the experiments shown here, with the additional complexity of pharmacology and controls, and we view it is beyond the scope of this study. First, it is not clear that dopamine modulates cone-cone gap junctions in the primate retina. Dopamine does not appear to modulate rod-cone gap junctions in the primate retina (Schneeweis and Schnapf 1999) as has been found in lower vertebrates. Second, both D1-like and D2-like receptors have been localized to primate photoreceptors (Zarbin 1986; Dearry 1991), so it is unclear which should be targeted. Finally, dopamine has effects at many locations in the retina (Witkovsky 2004). Knowing how to conclusively interpret the results of manipulating dopamine in the primate retina would require extensive intracellular recordings from photoreceptors, bipolar cells and ganglion cells. In short, understanding the role of dopamine receptor signaling among photoreceptor coupling in the primate retina is a major endeavor."
