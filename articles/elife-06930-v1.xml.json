In mothers of many species, changes in key energy-associated internal organs are common yet poorly characterised functionally and mechanistically. In this study, we show that, in adult <i>Drosophila</i> females, the midgut is dramatically remodelled to enhance reproductive output. In contrast to extant models, organ remodelling does not occur in response to increased nutrient intake and/or offspring demands, but rather precedes them. With spatially and temporally directed manipulations, we identify juvenile hormone (JH) as an anticipatory endocrine signal released after mating. Acting through intestinal bHLH-PAS domain proteins Methoprene-tolerant (Met) and Germ cell-expressed (Gce), JH signals directly to intestinal progenitors to yield a larger organ, and adjusts gene expression and sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) activity in enterocytes to support increased lipid metabolism. Our findings identify a metabolically significant paradigm of adult somatic organ remodelling linking hormonal signals, epithelial plasticity, and reproductive output."

In mothers of many species, changes in key energy-associated internal organs are common yet poorly characterised functionally and mechanistically. In this study, we show that, in adult <i>Drosophila</i> females, the midgut is dramatically remodelled to enhance reproductive output. In contrast to extant models, organ remodelling does not occur in response to increased nutrient intake and/or offspring demands, but rather precedes them. With spatially and temporally directed manipulations, we identify juvenile hormone (JH) as an anticipatory endocrine signal released after mating. Acting through intestinal bHLH-PAS domain proteins Methoprene-tolerant (Met) and Germ cell-expressed (Gce), JH signals directly to intestinal progenitors to yield a larger organ, and adjusts gene expression and sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) activity in enterocytes to support increased lipid metabolism. Our findings identify a metabolically significant paradigm of adult somatic organ remodelling linking hormonal signals, epithelial plasticity, and reproductive output."

In particular cells of the midgut, juvenile hormone also regulates some genes involved in the metabolism of lipids. If the activity of juvenile hormone is blocked in these cells, the female flies produce fewer eggs. These changes in the midgut still happen in mutant flies that cannot produce eggs and don't increase their food intake after they mate. Therefore, the changes appear to prepare flies for the increased nutritional demands rather than being caused by it."

This prompted us to characterise possible intestinal changes occurring during the phase of peak fertility (<a href=\"#bib20\">David et al., 1974</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Klepsatel et al., 2013</a>). We focused on the midgut epithelium because of its major digestive/absorptive roles (<a href=\"#bib44\">Lemaitre and Miguel-Aliaga, 2013</a>). In the midgut epithelium, long-lived progenitors (intestinal stem cells (ISCs)) divide to self-renew and to give rise to committed progenitors (called enteroblasts (EBs)), which directly differentiate into two types of progeny: absorptive enterocytes (ECs) and enteroendocrine cells (EECs) (<a href=\"#bib33\">Jiang and Edgar, 2012</a>). We found that mating increases the number of both dividing and differentiating midgut cells, as revealed by phospho-Histone H3 (pH3) stainings and temporal analyses of progenitors and their descendants using the dual-labelling system <i>escargot</i>-Repressible Dual Differential Marker (<i>esgReDDM</i>, <a href=\"#bib3\">Antonello et al., 2015</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,C,E</a>). The midgut of mated females also becomes visibly larger; gut diameter measurements were suggestive of a net increase in the number of postmitotic intestinal cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,D</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>): an increase that we confirmed by cell number and density counts (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Concurrent with midgut re-sizing, we observed mating-dependent activation of the single <i>Drosophila</i> homologue of the mammalian family of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs [<a href=\"#bib81\">Theopold et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Shimano, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Seegmiller et al., 2002</a>], also known as <i>HLH106</i> in flies, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>), using a reporter subject to the same physiologically regulated proteolytic processing as wild-type SREBP (<a href=\"#bib41\">Kunte et al., 2006</a>). SREBP activation after mating was accompanied by upregulation of midgut transcripts involved in fatty acid synthesis and activation (<i>SREBP</i>, the long-chain fatty acid CoA ligases <i>bubblegum</i> (<i>bgm</i>) and <i>Acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain</i> (<i>Acsl</i>) and, depending on genetic background, <i>Fatty acid synthase</i> (<i>FAS</i>) and <i>Acetyl-CoA carboxylase</i> (<i>ACC</i>)) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E,F</a>), many of which are known SREBP targets in flies and/or mammals (<a href=\"#bib73\">Seegmiller et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Horton et al., 2003</a>). Immunohistochemical analyses using reporters pointed to the ECs located in the posterior midgut region (R5, <a href=\"#bib11\">Buchon et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Marianes and Spradling, 2013</a>) as preferential sites of transcriptional and SREBP activity changes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A\u2013D</a>). Thus, in female flies actively engaged in reproduction, changes in both intestinal progenitors and their progeny parallel those observed in mammals leading to hyperplasia (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hammond, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Speakman, 2008</a>), increased organ size (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hammond, 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Speakman, 2008</a>) and upregulation of lipid gene expression (<a href=\"#bib4\">Athippozhy et al., 2011</a>)."

The synthesis of juvenile hormone (JH) in the <i>corpus allatum</i>, an endocrine gland, can be stimulated ex vivo by the male-derived Sex Peptide, suggesting regulation by mating (<a href=\"#bib55\">Moshitzky et al., 1996</a>). Using rapid direct analysis in real time (DART) mass spectrometry, we profiled haemolymph of both virgin and mated female flies and established that the levels of in vivo circulating JH are indeed increased after mating (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). The levels of two other juvenoid compounds, JH3-bisepoxide (JH3B) and methylfarnesoate (MF), were too low to be detected. We cannot, however, rule out that they also are regulated by mating and contribute to signalling through the JH pathway (<a href=\"#bib89\">Yin et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Tiu et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib85\">Wen et al., 2015</a>). JH has been shown to sustain ovarian maturation through pleiotropic actions on adipose and reproductive tissues (<a href=\"#bib25\">Flatt et al., 2005</a>), but its intestinal roles remain to be established. Consistent with a possible intestinal role, we detected transcript upregulation of the JH target <i>Kruppel homolog 1</i> (<i>Kr-h1</i>) (<a href=\"#bib34\">Jindra et al., 2013</a>) in guts of mated females (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). To explore the roles of JH signalling on intestinal remodelling, we first fed methoprene, a JH analogue (JHa) (<a href=\"#bib16\">Cerf and Georghiou, 1972</a>), to virgin female flies. This led to effects on intestinal progenitors, gut diameter, and lipid metabolism comparable to those triggered by mating (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B\u2013E,H</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We next blocked endogenous JH production by mis-expressing the protein phosphatase inhibitor <i>NiPp1</i> using the <i>corpus allatum</i>-specific driver <i>Aug21-Gal4</i> (<a href=\"#bib77\">Siegmund and Korge, 2001</a>): a genetic manipulation known to result in adult-specific ablation of the <i>corpus allatum</i> and a dramatic reduction of JH titres in the haemolymph (<a href=\"#bib88\">Yamamoto et al., 2013</a>). Depletion of systemic JH prevented mating-triggered remodelling: a phenotype that could be restored in these gland-ablated flies by JHa feeding (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F,I</a>)."

We used the <i>esgReDDM</i> system, based on the widely used <i>esg-Gal4</i> driver (<a href=\"#bib50\">Micchelli and Perrimon, 2006</a>), to target both classes of intestinal progenitor cells (ISCs and EBs). We first confirmed that expression of RNAi transgenes against either of the two previously identified JH receptors <i>Methoprene-tolerant</i> (<i>Met</i>) or <i>germ cell-expressed bHLH-PAS</i> (<i>gce</i>) (<a href=\"#bib34\">Jindra et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib34a\">Jindra et al., 2015</a>) resulted in a significant reduction in their transcript levels (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We then confined expression of these RNAi transgenes against <i>Met</i>, <i>gce</i>, or their target <i>Kr-h1</i> to adult intestinal progenitors using <i>esgReDDM</i>. Downregulation of any of these three genes fully prevented both the proliferative response to mating and midgut re-sizing, whereas overexpression of <i>Kr-h1</i> led to mating-like responses in virgin females (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G,J</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), indicating direct actions of JH on intestinal progenitors. Intestinal progenitors with downregulated JH receptors were found in numbers comparable to those of controls in virgin females and were able to increase their proliferation in response to a JH-unrelated stimulus: the ROS-inducing compound paraquat (<a href=\"#bib8\">Biteau et al., 2008</a>) (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This indicates that they remain competent to respond to the well-studied homeostatic machinery that maintains gut integrity (<a href=\"#bib33\">Jiang and Edgar, 2012</a>), and suggests that mating- and damage-induced proliferative mechanisms may differ and can be uncoupled. In ECs, targeted by the specific driver <i>Mex-Gal4</i> (<a href=\"#bib63\">Phillips and Thomas, 2006</a>), only downregulation of <i>gce</i> strongly reduced the mating-dependent upregulation of a <i>bgm</i> reporter (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3K</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Together, these findings show that intestinal remodelling results from a rise in systemic JH triggered by mating. JH signals directly to intestinal progenitors to yield a larger organ in a <i>Met</i> and <i>gce</i>-dependent manner. Acting predominantly through <i>gce</i>, JH also adjusts gene expression in ECs to support increased lipid metabolism."

Alternatively, it may occur in preparation for, but be uncoupled from, such nutritional demands. Consistent with the latter idea, the mating-triggered changes in proliferation, midgut size, and SREBP activity are all still apparent in sterile female <i>ovo</i><sup><i>D1</i></sup> mutant flies in which egg production is blocked prior to vitellogenesis and which do not increase food intake after mating (<a href=\"#bib7\">Barnes et al., 2008</a>) (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). To investigate the significance of intestinal remodelling, we used several RNAi transgenes to downregulate either the JH receptors or <i>SREBP</i>, which is activated by mating, specifically in adult ECs. In all cases, EC-specific downregulation led to a reduction in the number (but not viability) of eggs produced (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E,F</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), indicating that JH signalling is required to specifically enhance the quantity (fecundity), but not the quality (viability), of reproductive output. Progenitor cell-specific downregulation may also be expected to reduce fecundity; however, we detected expression of several intestinal progenitor drivers outside the intestine (data not shown), which could affect egg production independently of the intestine. More specific tools will be necessary to resolve this important issue."

As the trafficked nutrients would be therefore released in the form of eggs, we used sterile <i>ovo</i><sup><i>D1</i></sup> females to quantify lipid content, reasoning that it might accumulate in gut and/or peripheral fat stores in the absence of the local ovarian sink (<a href=\"#bib62\">Parra-Peralbo and Culi, 2011</a>). Consistent with this idea, sterile <i>ovo</i><sup><i>D1</i></sup> female flies accumulate peripheral fat after mating (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,C</a>), and lipid accumulation in the posterior midgut could be induced in fertile flies by either treatment of these sterile flies with JHa or by knocking down lipid shuttling proteins acutely, thereby blocking all lipid circulation (<a href=\"#bib60\">Palm et al., 2012</a>) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G\u2013J</a>). Together, these data show that the metabolic reprogramming of ECs by JH supports fecundity, thus confirming that intestinal plasticity is required to sustain reproductive output at the time of peak fertility.

Several reports connect SP to the <i>corpus allatum</i> and JH production (<a href=\"#bib55\">Moshitzky et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Bontonou et al., 2015</a>), suggesting that the systemic effects of mating via SP could be carried out through this pathway. Intriguingly, both JH knockdown in females (<a href=\"#bib88\">Yamamoto et al., 2013</a>) and SP deficiency in males (<a href=\"#bib86\">Wigby and Chapman, 2005</a>) extend female lifespan while reducing reproductive output and/or peak fertility. This \u2018cost of mating\u2019 on lifespan is not relieved by sterility (<a href=\"#bib83\">Ueyama and Fuyama, 2003</a>), suggesting that physiological effects in non-reproductive tissues are responsible. The intestinal reprogramming that we describe here represents a novel physiological target of postmating plasticity ideally placed at the interface between nutrition and reproduction. Ageing in flies is accompanied by reduced fertility (<a href=\"#bib21\">Economos et al., 1979</a>) and intestinal dysplasia (<a href=\"#bib8\">Biteau et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Choi et al., 2008</a>), and genetic manipulations that affect intestinal progenitors can affect lifespan (<a href=\"#bib9\">Biteau et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Rera et al., 2011</a>). Thus, it will be informative to explore the links between JH-triggered postmating responses in lifespan, age-dependent intestinal and reproductive dysfunction, and lifetime fertility."

Increasing evidence is revealing that, in adults, this insect endocrine organ acts as a nexus that detects changes in the organism's circumstances and condition to alter its metabolic and/or reproductive set points. It does so through regulated release of JH, with pleiotropic effects on ovarian maturation, adipose tissue, learning and memory, diapause, innate immunity, and ageing (<a href=\"#bib57\">Nijhout and Riddiford, 1974</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Jowett and Postlethwait, 1980</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Fahrbach and Robinson, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib87\">Wyatt and Davey, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Flatt et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Riddiford, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib88\">Yamamoto et al., 2013</a>). Some of these effects may be modulated by crosstalk between JH and other systemic signals such as insulin-like peptides and ecdysteroids (<a href=\"#bib34\">Jindra et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Koyama et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Mirth et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Rauschenbach et al., 2014</a>), but the cellular and molecular targets of JH action remain incompletely understood. Our findings have uncovered a direct and functionally significant effect on adult organ plasticity by showing that JH promotes proliferation and resets gut size through its actions on intestinal progenitors and activates expression of lipid metabolism genes in ECs. Based on structural and functional similarities, insect JH has been compared to mammalian thyroid hormones (<a href=\"#bib24\">Flatt et al., 2006</a>): key energy balance regulators often associated with gastrointestinal alterations when pathologically dysregulated (<a href=\"#bib51\">Middleton, 1971</a>). Given the well-established changes in thyroid function during human pregnancy (<a href=\"#bib26\">Glinoer, 1997</a>), it will therefore be of interest to explore their contribution to reproductive intestinal remodelling. Downstream of its receptor(s), relay of JH signalling in the intestine may differ from the classical model in which <i>Met</i> and <i>gce</i> act redundantly (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abdou et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Jindra et al., 2013</a>). Indeed, downregulation of either gene alone is sufficient to prevent the mating-induced changes in intestinal progenitors: a finding that we confirmed by observing that viable <i>Met</i><sup><i>27</i></sup> mutants also fail to undergo mating-induced remodelling (data not shown). The actions of Met and Gce may also be cell-specific, as suggested by a preferential requirement for <i>gce</i> in ECs, and may result from different Met/gce expression levels (our unpublished observations) and/or interacting partners. Candidates to consider include Taiman, homologous to the mammalian steroid receptor coactivator 1 (SRC-1)/NCoA-1/p160 (<a href=\"#bib17\">Charles et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Li et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib90\">Zhang et al., 2011</a>) and, more intriguingly, circadian clock proteins: Met-binding partners recently shown to coordinate the switch from diapause to reproduction in other insects (<a href=\"#bib75\">Shin et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bajgar et al., 2013</a>)."

Although intestinal remodelling has not been assessed in human pregnancy, it could be one of the major drivers for the changes in gut microbiota observed during pregnancy (<a href=\"#bib38\">Koren et al., 2012</a>) and could contribute to changes in gastrointestinal physiology, common during pregnancy (<a href=\"#bib36\">Keller et al., 2008</a>). Resetting of anatomical or metabolic features of internal organs may thus be a broadly used strategy to achieve a positive energy balance which, when matched to the developing offspring's demands, will contribute to reproductive success. However, if deployed in the absence of such demands, organ remodelling could contribute to the weight gain and increased fat mass that has been observed upon gonadectomy of multiple species including mice, rats, cats, monkeys, and other mammals (<a href=\"#bib30\">Hansen et al., 2013</a> and references therein). In a more physiological context, inappropriate persistence of such metabolic remodelling beyond pregnancy and lactation could similarly contribute to post-pregnancy weight retention in humans\u2014a phenotype that, at least in mice, is correlated with enhanced intestinal function (<a href=\"#bib15\">Casirola and Ferraris, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Gore et al., 2003</a>). Similarly, inappropriate persistence of JH-like mechanisms that change the homeostatic set point of adult stem cells and their progeny to transform an organ may also help explain why pregnancy changes the susceptibility to certain cancers (<a href=\"#bib28\">Gwinn et al., 1990</a>)."

For the acquisition of gut images in these samples, a single 1392 \u00d7 1040 field was acquired posterior to the midgut\u2013hindgut boundary using QCapture software (QImaging). Progeny dynamics were analysed using the <i>esgReDDM</i> system (<a href=\"#bib3\">Antonello et al., 2015</a>), which has the genetic makeup <i>esg-Gal4, UAS-mCD8::GFP; tub-Gal80</i><sup><i>ts</i></sup><i>, UAS-H2B::RFP</i>. At the permissive temperature of 29\u00b0C, the GFP reporter is expressed in <i>esg-Gal4</i> positive cells (ISCs and EBs), but due to the perdurance of the RFP-tagged histone H2B::RFP the <i>esg-Gal4-</i>negative progeny (including ECs and EECs) generated from these progenitors since the shift to permissive temperature is additionally labelled in red. To restrict progeny analysis to mating-induced changes, <i>esgReDDM</i> flies were maintained at 18\u00b0C, such that Gal4 expression is suppressed by <i>tub-Gal80</i><sup><i>ts</i></sup>, and moved to 29\u00b0C only at the time of mating. After 3 days of mating at 29\u00b0C, guts were dissected and stained for GFP and pH3 (the endogenous RFP signal was detected directly). EC number in the posterior midgut was assessed by imaging the entire gut of <i>caudal &gt; H2B::RFP</i> flies and counting the number of RFP-marked cells. Confocal images were obtained with a Leica TCS SP5 inverted confocal microscope using a 20\u00d7 air objective for <i>esgReDDM</i> and a 10\u00d7 air objective for <i>caudal &gt; H2B::RFP</i>. Stacks were typically collected every 1 \u00b5m, and the images (1024 \u00d7 1024) were reconstructed using maximum projection. Bright-field images or confocal maximum projections were loaded into ImageJ (<a href=\"#bib72\">Schneider et al., 2012</a>) and the line tool used to quantify the width of the gut across the centre of the image. ImageJ was also used to outline the guts of <i>esgReDDM</i> flies using the polygon tool before analysing the resulting region of interest (ROI) with a custom MATLAB (The MathWorks, Inc.) script optimised for the ReDDM method. Extended details about this analysis are available from (<a href=\"#bib3\">Antonello et al., 2015</a>). Briefly, maximum projections were adjusted for levels and offsets and filtered to remove noise (using always the same parameters for scans within one experiment), then the area of the gut was identified by background staining and the cell nuclei by DAPI signal. The size of nuclei can be used to discriminate between diploid cells (ISCs, EBs, and EECs) and polyploid ECs. The red-labelled nuclei (persistent H2B::RFP) and green-labelled cells (mCD8::GFP) were identified by segmentation and compared to the pattern of nuclei defined by DAPI to generate a report of total ECs (large DAPI cells), total progenitors + progeny (RFP signal), total ISCs and EBs (GFP signal), and total area. The same script was also used to count the number of <i>caudal &gt; H2B::RFP</i> cells."

The abundance of the [M-H<sub>2</sub>O + H]<sup>+</sup> signal peak was used for all measurements because the parent ion at m/z 267.20 could not be consistently resolved due to interference from other signals.

Males were then removed, individual female flies were transferred to a new single vial of yeast-supplemented standard food (cornmeal/agar diet with 5% yeast content) every 48 hr, and eggs were counted from the vacated vial to quantify fecundity. To assess egg viability, a fraction of the egg-containing vials were then maintained at 29\u00b0C, and the number of eclosed progeny was counted and compared with egg counts. Each genotype cross was performed three times, and egg production from each fly was assessed over three 48 hr repeats, covering a total of 6 days of egg laying."

After an extraction period (1 hr at 37\u00b0C), aqueous and organic phases were separated by the addition of a 1:1 mixture of 1 M potassium chloride and chloroform (75 \u03bcl each). Samples were briefly centrifuged and 120 \u03bcl of the organic phase was transferred to fresh Eppendorf tubes and left to air-dry for 3 hr. The resulting dessicated lipids were resuspended in 16 \u03bcl of a 1:1 chloroform:methanol mixture. 3 \u03bcl of each sample was applied to TLC plates (Merck Millipore116487) and lipid species were separated by standing the plates in \u223c1 cm of a mobile phase consisting of 69.5% hexane, 29.5% diethyl ether, and 1% acetic acid. Once the mobile phase had traversed the plates, they were briefly dried and then dipped in a cerium-ammonium-molybdate stain (ammonium heptamolybdate tetrahydrate 2.5 g, cerium (IV) sulphate hydrate complex with sulphuric acid 1 g, water 90 ml, sulphuric acid 10 ml). The TLC plates were developed at 80\u00b0C for 25 min and then imaged on a digital scanner. The TAG content was quantified by analysing the resulting TIFF images using the densitometry tool in ImageJ software. All reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich."

In the larva, this manipulation prevents the loading of gut-originated medium-chain diacylglycerides, which are a dominant component of circulating lipids, onto the haemolymph carrier Lipophorin (Lpp) and leads to the accumulation of stored lipid in the larval gut in triglyceride form (<a href=\"#bib60\">Palm et al., 2012</a>). The downregulation of <i>LTP</i> from the fat body driver <i>lpp-Gal4</i> was triggered in virgin females by 1 hr heat-shock at 37\u00b0C; after 6 hr, the guts were dissected for neutral lipid detection using Oil Red O staining."

The preparations were mounted in glycerol for analysis, and the posterior midgut was imaged using either a Zeiss Axioplan stereo microscope equipped with Nomarski optics or an Olympus BX53 phase contrast microscope equipped with a 4\u00d7/0.13 UPlanFLN lens through CellSens software (Olympus, Japan). The resulting TIFF files were analysed quantitatively using a custom ImageJ script: the gut was manually outlined as a ROI using the polygon tool, then the RGB channels were split and the red channel subtracted from the green to eliminate background (grey) signal. The mean intensity of the resulting signal within the ROI was calculated with the built-in Analyse Particles function."

Count data with a distinctly non-normal distribution (specifically, pH3 counts) were fitted with a negative binomial model (R function glm.nb from MASS package, <a href=\"#bib84\">Venables and Ripley, 2002</a>) followed by likelihood ratio tests (R function anova.negbin from MASS package). Rank-based experiments were analysed with the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon rank sum test (R function wilcox.test). All graphs were generated in R using a custom script based on the base boxplot function superimposed with individual data points plotted with the beeswarm function (package beeswarm). Confocal and bright-field images shown in conjunction were always acquired with the same settings as part of a single experiment. For visualisation purposes, level and channel adjustments were applied using Adobe Photoshop CS6 to the confocal images shown in figure panels (the same correction in all comparable images), but all quantitative analyses were carried out on unadjusted raw images or maximum projections.

To really assess this, I suppose one would need to measure reproductive success among a large number of wild-type genotypes from natural populations. Is the claim here that reproductive success is maximized/optimized in the wild-type (as measured/defined here) and that any deviation from this state reduces reproductive success? The authors should be careful with their phrasing, especially with regard to any putative adaptive interpretation of their findings. For example, in the Abstract/Summary, they state that the \u201cmidgut is dramatically remodelled to maximise reproductive success\u201d, and I am wondering how certain one can be about this rather strong claim. I would say that their results are consistent with such an adaptive interpretation but they do not prove it."

Many of their results pertain to fecundity rather than fertility. Reproductive success in the strict sense refers to the number of surviving offspring (thus to fertility, not to fecundity). From the Methods section it appears that the authors have indeed also measured fertility but, alas, I cannot find these data: all the plots seem to show fecundity (at least that is what the axes say), not fertility. Also note that, unlike defined in the Methods (in the subsection headed \u201cFertility and fecundity experiments\u201d), viability (=egg to adult survival, which is a proportion or percentage) is <i>not</i> the same as fertility. Fertility is the number of total eggs produced times viability, giving the total number of eggs produced from which adult flies eclose. Moreover, importantly, as far as I can tell, the authors have measured fecundity only over the first 6 days of adulthood. This is hardly an accurate measure of (lifetime) reproductive success! It might very well be that minor early differences in fecundity will vanish with age so that there won't be any net difference between two groups claimed to be different. On the other hand, since pek fecundity is reached within 3\u20134 days after eclosion, the authors can argue that they have focused on the most important part of the age-dependent fecundity profile. Nonetheless, the authors should be more careful when talking about \u201creproductive success\u201d."
