The Autophagy linked FYVE protein (Alfy), previously identified as a molecular scaffold between the ubiquitinated cargo and the autophagic machinery, is highly expressed in the developing central nervous system, indicating that this pathway may have yet unexplored roles in neurodevelopment. To examine this possibility, we used mouse genetics to eliminate Alfy expression. We report that this evolutionarily conserved protein is required for the formation of axonal tracts throughout the brain and spinal cord, including the formation of the major forebrain commissures. Consistent with a phenotype reflecting a failure in axon guidance, the loss of Alfy in mice disrupts localization of glial guidepost cells, and attenuates axon outgrowth in response to Netrin-1. These findings further support the growing indication that macroautophagy plays a key role in the developing CNS."

The Autophagy linked FYVE protein (Alfy), previously identified as a molecular scaffold between the ubiquitinated cargo and the autophagic machinery, is highly expressed in the developing central nervous system, indicating that this pathway may have yet unexplored roles in neurodevelopment. To examine this possibility, we used mouse genetics to eliminate Alfy expression. We report that this evolutionarily conserved protein is required for the formation of axonal tracts throughout the brain and spinal cord, including the formation of the major forebrain commissures. Consistent with a phenotype reflecting a failure in axon guidance, the loss of Alfy in mice disrupts localization of glial guidepost cells, and attenuates axon outgrowth in response to Netrin-1. These findings further support the growing indication that macroautophagy plays a key role in the developing CNS."

This long life suggests that they may be more vulnerable to damage from cellular debris. Previous research has found that a protein called Alfy, which is abundant in the brain, is involved in cleaning up debris, such as those involved in neurodegenerative diseases, by a pathway known as autophagy. Alfy guides the formation of spherical compartments called autophagosomes, which deliver the debris to another compartment known as the lysosome to permit degradation."

Studying Alfy therefore may help us to understand human conditions that affect the developing or aging brain."

Adult <i>bchs</i> null flies have a shortened life span and show signs of adult onset neurodegeneration, including the accumulation of ubiquitinated aggregates (<a href=\"#bib15\">Filimonenko et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Finley et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Khodosh et al., 2006</a>).

Recently it has been reported that in vertebrates, genetically diminished levels of Alfy disrupts neurogenesis leading to altered forebrain morphology (<a href=\"#bib43\">Orosco et al., 2014</a>).

Constitutive elimination of Alfy leads to perinatal lethality, in conjunction with developmental brain wiring defects throughout the CNS, involving forebrain commissures, internal capsule, optic chiasm, spinal cord and longitudinal tracts such as the medial forebrain bundle. In the ventral midbrain, dopaminergic cell populations retain an immature morphology and their axons aberrantly project into the hypothalamic region, forming an ectopic commissure near the optic chiasm. Consistent with a failure of axon guidance mechanisms, localization of glial guidepost cells for callosal axons were disrupted, and sensitivity of Alfy knockout axons to the trophic effect of Netrin-1 was significantly diminished. Moreover, Alfy is enriched in membrane fractions, suggesting that it may play a key role in membrane trafficking events to establish neural connectivity in the mammalian brain."

Similar analysis in adult tissue revealed that the <i>Wdfy3</i> transcript is ubiquitously expressed, and\u00a0that\u00a0the highest concentration of Alfy was observed in the brain (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), confirming previous results (<a href=\"#bib53\">Simonsen et al., 2004</a>). <i>Wdfy3</i> transcript is detected throughout the both the perinatal and adult brain, as determined by <i>in situ</i> hybridization (ISH) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a> and not shown). Immunoblotting revealed that expression of the protein was present uniformly throughout the brain (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Using both primary neuronal and purified astroglial cultures, endogenous Alfy expression was detected in both cell types (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), supporting recent transcriptome analysis of the mouse cortex (<a href=\"#bib63\">Zhang et al., 2014</a>).

In light of the presence of Alfy in astroglial cells, as well as the midline crossing defects, we hypothesized that migration abnormalities could contribute to the connectivity defects in Alfy GT and KO mice. Thus, we next examined the callosal guidepost cells, a key population implicated in providing intermediate guidance cues to developing cortical axons. Immunostaining against GFAP on P0 mouse brains revealed abnormalities in Alfy GT brains (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D,E</a>). Unlike control brain, the ig cells were undetectable and the gw appeared disorganized and loosely packed. The midline zipper glia (mz), cells proposed to promote fusion of the two telencephalic hemispheres (<a href=\"#bib52\">Silver, 1993</a>), were present but distributed abnormally (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>), whereas cells in the fimbria and dentate gyrus of the hippocampus appear largely normal (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). Taken together, the disorganization of the ig, gw and mz is consistent with the agenesis of the corpus callosum observed in the absence of Alfy. These findings suggest that cells that act as important guideposts for decussating callosal axons (<a href=\"#bib50\">Shu and Richards, 2001</a>) fail to migrate properly in the absence of Alfy, contributing to the connectivity defects observed."

Nissl staining revealed that cortical layering appeared normal, however there was a significant but modest thinning of the cortical plate/subplate at P0 (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Although this may be due to the diminished NF staining observed in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, we next determined if cell proliferation was affected. Pulse-labeling with bromo-6-deoxy-uridine (BrdU) at E15.5 revealed cell division in the developing cortex at the expected location in Alfy GT mice (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). To determine if the\u00a0amount of proliferation was impacted by the loss of Alfy, stereology was performed on BrdU labeled embryos at ages E13.5 and E15.5 (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). No significant difference across genotypes was detected at E13.5, but a modest yet significant reduction in the number of BrdU-positive cells was detected in Alfy KO embryos at E15.5. This difference appeared limited to the cortex, since staining against Ki67 within the subventricular zone at P0 revealed no significant difference between Alfy null mice and controls (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). Further, despite this modest decrease in embryonic proliferation, there were no detectable differences across genotypes in the amount of cell death in E15.5 brains, as indicated by immunohistochemistry against cleaved caspase-3 (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>)."

These structures were observed as early as E15.5. Thus, the loss of Alfy leads to subtle defects in proliferation, but no changes in cell death or specification in the developing cortical projection neurons. Although columnar organization of discrete regions of the cerebral cortex can be disrupted by the absence of Alfy during embryonic development, it is unlikely that these defects can account for the midline crossing defects observed in Alfy null mice."

                                "text": "Using two independent mouse models, we find that the loss of Alfy leads to erroneous pathfinding throughout the CNS. Several of these findings are suggestive that the anatomical phenotype observed in Alfy mutant mice may in part be due to defects in axon guidance. For example, an abnormal dopaminergic commissure at the level of the diencephalon traveling through the hypothalamus from the MFB has been previously reported in the <i>Slit1/Slit2</i> double KO (<a href=\"#bib1\">Bagri et al., 2002</a>), the <i>Deleted in colorectal cancer (Dcc</i>) KO (<a href=\"#bib59\">Xu et al., 2010</a>), and the <i>NK2 Homeobox 1 (Nkx2.1</i>) KO (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kawano et al., 2003</a>) mice. Moreover, diminished guidance cue responsiveness could also account for the failure of the midline astroglia to migrate properly. We therefore hypothesized that Alfy may be involved in the ability of neural cells to respond to guidance cues."

                                "text": "Prior to determining if Alfy is involved in axon guidance, we first determined where Alfy is expressed. To do so, we reintroduced full length Alfy into Alfy null primary dissociated cultures to visualize its localization (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Full length Alfy constructs with an N-terminus tag were transfected into DIV7 dissociated primary cortical cultures. Alfy localized throughout the neuron, including within the axon. Neighboring astroglia also showed a diffuse localization of Alfy (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Next, we performed subcellular fractionation of adult cortical lysates (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B,C</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) (<a href=\"#bib18\">Hallett et al., 2008</a>). Fractionation revealed that Alfy enriched in the light membrane fraction (P3) along with synaptosomal membrane protein synaptophysin and a classic marker for autophagic vesicles, the membrane bound form of microtubule associated protein light chain 3 (LC3-II)\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib24\">Kabeya et al., 2000</a>) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B,C</a>). Additionally, Alfy was enriched in the crude synaptic vesicle fraction (LP1). Taken together, these results suggest that Alfy may be involved in regulating the trafficking, sorting or signaling events that are required for brain wiring."

Under the conditions used, directional responsiveness could not be ascertained (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>), likely due to the abundance of Netrin-1 expression due to the use of HEK293T cells (<a href=\"#bib49\">Shirasaki et al., 1996</a>).

The homozygous loss of <i>Wdfy3</i> disrupts the formation of many axonal connections, causing agenesis of all three forebrain commissural tracts and leading to profound changes in brain wiring throughout the CNS, including the optic chiasm, internal capsule, cerebral peduncle, medial forebrain bundle and spinal cord tracts. At the cellular level, the loss of Alfy led to defects in the development of midline glial population, impacted embryonic cortical neuron proliferation and impeded the ability of axons to respond to Netrin-1. Furthermore, Alfy KO mice present a phenotype unlike mice lacking core autophagy genes such as <i>Atg5</i>, suggesting the perinatal lethality is not due to a loss of general autophagic degradation, as Alfy mutant tissue and cells display the classic response to starvation. We hypothesize that Alfy functions as a selective macroautophagy adaptor protein and that Alfy-dependent regulation of intracellular vesicle trafficking and signaling pathways upstream of macroautophagy can have a significant influence over brain development."

In the adult brain, Alfy facilitates the sorting of ubiquitinated cargo into APs, and one possibility is that during development Alfy has an analogous function. For instance, APs are present in the growth cone and axon tips (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hollenbeck, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Maday and Holzbaur, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Maday et al., 2012</a>). We propose that Alfy could regulate the ability of growth cones to respond to cues by sequestering and sorting proteins into degradative vesicles. Such regulation could be critical for responding to cues in the environment through changes in cell shape and motility. It has been suggested previously that the ubiquitination of guidance receptor complexes could regulate the responsiveness of axons to guidance cues (<a href=\"#bib42\">O'Donnell et al., 2009</a>). The trafficking and responsiveness of the axonal guidance receptors Robo1 and UNC5 has been shown to be regulated by the E3 ubiquitin ligases rpm-1 in <i>C. elegans</i> and USP33 in murine commissural axons, respectively (<a href=\"#bib35\">Li et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Yuasa-Kawada et al., 2009</a>). Furthermore, deletion of the rpm-1 homologue, Phr1, in mice, causes axonal wiring defects reminiscent of Alfy mutants (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bloom et al., 2007</a>). One intriguing possibility is that Alfy might sequester cargo ubiquitinated by E3 ligases such as Phr1 or USP33. Alternatively, the association of Alfy with the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor-associated protein (GABARAP) (<a href=\"#bib39\">Lystad et al., 2014</a>), implies Alfy could be involved in the selective sorting of plasma membrane receptors. Based on this model, we predict that in the absence of Alfy, the efficient degradation of Alfy-associated cargo would be slowed, or the cargo would be trafficked into alternative pathways, disrupting the temporal regulation of signaling events within the growth cone. Similarly, the disruption of the midline glial structures may also reflect the disruption of signaling events that promote the differentiation and migration of these cell populations. Examination of substrates labeled with a Lys63 polyUb chain, which are also associated with APs (<a href=\"#bib48\">Shaid et al., 2013</a>), may identify other Alfy-interacting substrates."

                        "text": "Whereas proteasome-mediated degradation is thought to be the primary catabolic pathway regulating neurodevelopmental signaling (<a href=\"#bib60\">Yi and Ehlers, 2007</a>), recent studies indicate that macroautophagy may also play a critical role in morphogenesis. For instance, the loss of Ambra1, a regulator of the autophagy protein Beclin1, causes neural tube closure defects in mice (<a href=\"#bib16\">Fimia et al., 2007</a>). In humans, recessive mutations in <i>TECPR2</i> and <i>EPG5</i>, genes implicated in AP maturation (<a href=\"#bib54\">Stadel et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Tian et al., 2010</a>), are responsible, respectively, for spastic paraplegia 49 with brain malformations, including hypogenesis of the corpus callosum [OMIM 615031] and Vici syndrome with brain malformations, including agenesis of the corpus callosum [OMIM 242840] (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cullup et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Oz-Levi et al., 2012</a>). Why loss of these autophagy-related proteins causes corpus callosum defects remains unclear. Although little is known about the importance of core autophagy genes such as <i>Atg5, Atg7</i> and <i>Atg14</i> in neurodevelopment, no obvious defects in axonal connectivity have been reported (<a href=\"#bib19\">Hara et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Komatsu et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Liang et al., 2010</a>). One exception is that the conditional elimination of <i>Atg7</i> in POMC neurons leads to a defect in postnatal axonal outgrowth (<a href=\"#bib7\">Coupe et al., 2012</a>), and recently, a partial LoF mutation in a core autophagy gene, Atg5, have been reported to lead to cerebellar hypoplasia and developmental delay (<a href=\"#bib29\">Kim et al., 2016</a>), but connectivity of the callosum appears unaffected. Given that degradation by autophagy is slower than proteasome-mediated turnover, these data suggest that the sorting and sequestration of cargo, rather than elimination of cargo, is critical for the timing of cellular processes regulated by macroautophagy. Alternatively, as a scaffold for ubiquitinated structures for degradation by macroautophagy, the loss of Alfy might have indirect effects on proteasome activity. For example, Alfy is recruited to aggregated structures that form upon proteasome-inhibition (<a href=\"#bib5\">Clausen et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Simonsen et al., 2004</a>); when Alfy is absent, the persistence of structures that might otherwise be eliminated may impact the efficiency of proteasome-mediated degradation. We have previously reported that the deletion of Alfy does not measurably affect the enzymatic activity of the proteasome (<a href=\"#bib15\">Filimonenko et al., 2010</a>) and does not lead to the accumulation of ubiquitinated structures in <i>Alfy</i> null MEFs (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). Nonetheless, it is still possible that localized, discrete disruptions of proteasome activity or modifications in activity enough to disrupt timing might be present, leading to the profound phenotype we observe here."

Most recently, a missense mutation in <i>WDFY3</i> has been linked to autosomal dominant primary microcephaly (<a href=\"#bib25\">Kadir et al., 2016</a>). Furthermore, in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), rare <i>de novo</i> nonsense mutations within <i>WDFY3</i> have been identified across two independent studies (<a href=\"#bib10\">De Rubeis et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Iossifov et al., 2012</a>). <i>WDFY3</i> resides on chromosome 4q21.23 and this region of chromosome 4 was suggested to harbor a genetic predisposition to ASD (<a href=\"#bib4\">Chen et al., 2006</a>) and to schizophrenia (<a href=\"#bib12\">Faraone et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Paunio et al., 2004</a>). In addition, the dosage of <i>WDFY3</i> is affected in a subset of individuals with a rare chromosome disorder known as 4q21 deletion syndrome [OMIM 613509], characterized by intellectual disabilities (ID), language impairment and congenital birth defects (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bonnet et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Cooper et al., 2011</a>). Taken together, these data imply <i>WDFY3</i> is a rare genetic risk factor for childhood neurological disorders. Future studies should aim to determine whether <i>WDFY3</i> dosage is critical for human brain development and how mutations could potentially disrupt the biological function of Alfy. A network analysis study on genomic data found that CNVs in genes associated with autophagy were enriched in patients with ASD (<a href=\"#bib46\">Poultney et al., 2013</a>). While it remains to be determined whether computational modeling can be used to accurately predict the cellular pathways disrupted in ASD, in light of our findings, we would propose that further study is warranted."

Once explants were placed, 350 \u00b5m diameter punches of solidified agarose cell blocks containing either untransfected or Netrin1-MYC transfected HEK293T cells were placed alongside cortical explant pieces. Explants were grown for 48\u2009hr, and then fixed with 4% PFA for 15 min. Explants were imaged and measured using phase contrast microscopy using a 10X objective on a Nikon TiE microscope and NIS Elements software (Nikon). Across two experiments, outgrowth in microns towards the HEK293T cellblock was recorded for the three longest processes in a single plane. The measurements were averaged for each explant and statistical analysis was performed using two-way ANOVA followed by the Fisher LSD post hoc test. Following analysis of outgrowth, explants were further processed for immunocytochemistry as described above. To prepare HEK293T agarose cell blocks, HEK293T cells were seeded at 600,000 cells per six well, then 16\u2009hr later transiently transfected with pGNET1-myc using Lipofectamine 2000.

Concerns expressed about validating the presence of Alfy in the neuronal and glial populations under investigation have been thoroughly addressed. The evidence presented also supports the conclusion that loss of Alfy disrupts localization of glial guidepost cells and prevents axons from responding to guidance cues such as Netrin-1. Alfy knockout mice display malformations of most major axon tracts in the brain as well as a thinner cerebral cortex and a markedly reduced thalamus. These are novel and worthwhile findings of interest to a broad neuroscience audience and indicate a key developmental role for Alfy. They raise the possibility that the known function of Alfy in selective autophagy may be critical in development. Some support for this latter conclusion is provided by showing that Alfy deletion in the mouse model somewhat impairs selective autophagy of previously established Alfy targets but not macroautophagy as monitored by LC3 behaviour. Overall this manuscript makes an important contribution but there are some important issues that need to be addressed by the authors."

Analyses should be completed at multiple developmental stages from E12.5 and quantifications performed. The fact that the cortex is thinner and the thalamus is considerably reduced indicate that there is an issue with the generation, or premature differentiation, of neurons in Alfy mutant mice. Although these may not underlie the axonal guidance disorders, the authors cannot present their argument that Alfy specifically regulates axonal guidance and not neuronal development, based on the current evidence provided.</i>"

In light of this addition, we have now updated our Discussion section to reflect this new finding."

In this submission, we include an analysis of directional outgrowth that was calculated by measuring the length of axons growing on the side of the explant facing the cue and dividing by the length of axons on the opposite side of the explant. We represent this as a guidance ratio and find that while our co-culture conditions generate a reproducible effect on outgrowth in response to Netrin-1 exposure, we do not observe directional growth in either genotype, indicating that our culture conditions do not permit this measurement. We now include both measurements in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>, and additional images in <a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2</a>. One explanation for this outcome is that HEK293T cells have a high secretory capacity, which may cause Netrin-1 act more diffusely. In light of these findings, we have updated our Results and Discussion sections to indicate that the Alfy KO neurons respond less robustly to the trophic effects of Netrin-1, but that we cannot conclude that the loss of Alfy causes a defect in axon guidance."
