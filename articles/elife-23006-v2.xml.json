Here, we extend the technique to include a small amount of defocus which enables contrast transfer function measurement and correction. This hybrid approach simplifies the experiment and increases the data acquisition speed. It also removes the resolution limit inherent to the in-focus method thus allowing 3D reconstructions with resolutions better than 3 \u00c5."

Here, we extend the technique to include a small amount of defocus which enables contrast transfer function measurement and correction. This hybrid approach simplifies the experiment and increases the data acquisition speed. It also removes the resolution limit inherent to the in-focus method thus allowing 3D reconstructions with resolutions better than 3 \u00c5."

It is the first phase-plate-type device to reach near-atomic resolutions in single particle cryo-EM (<a href=\"#bib4\">Chua et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Danev and Baumeister, 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Khoshouei et al., 2016a</a>, <a href=\"#bib10\">2016b</a>). Nowadays such resolutions are not uncommon, but there are still challenges related mainly to intrinsic properties of the target structures. Small, heterogeneous and/or flexible molecules are generally difficult to solve by the traditional defocus phase contrast (DPC) method (<a href=\"#bib3\">Cheng et al., 2015</a>). The VPP improves image contrast and thus could help with solving the structures of such \u2018difficult\u2019 samples. Aside from the improved contrast, one of the main questions about the VPP in the cryo-EM community has been: does it in any way limit the achievable resolution as compared to DPC?"

The in-focus method, although ideal from a theoretical point of view, has a few practical disadvantages and limitations. It requires very accurate focusing which complicates and slows down the data acquisition. Furthermore, the achievable resolution is limited by the spherical aberration of the objective lens to\u00a0~3 \u00c5. At the time of our initial report the 3D reconstruction software did not yet support VPP phase shift (PS) in the contrast transfer function (CTF). In the meantime, such support was implemented which enabled the present work. Here, we present a hybrid approach which combines the VPP with a small amount of defocus. It simplifies the data acquisition to a level similar to DPC and solves the resolution limit issue of the in-focus approach by enabling CTF fitting and correction."

Here, we used the same sample for consistency and continuation. The defocused VPP dataset is illustrated in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>. Acquiring images with defocus is easier and faster because the defocus and astigmatism can be fitted and corrected a posteriori. The VPP provides low frequency contrast which allows the use of defocus values smaller than those typically used in DPC. Because of the low defocus the images (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) look similar to in-focus images (Figure 4A in <a href=\"#bib5\">Danev and Baumeister, 2016</a>). The power spectrum in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, however, clearly shows the effect of defocus with characteristic CTF rings (Thon rings). Fitting the CTFs of VPP data requires an additional PS parameter (<a href=\"#bib15\">Rohou and Grigorieff, 2015</a>). Such fits provide a quantitative measure of the behavior of the VPP. <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a> shows a plot of the PS history throughout the dataset. The VPP was advanced to a new position every 1.5 hr (every\u00a0~40 images, total dose on the VPP\u00a0~50 nC). After each advance the PS drops abruptly to a low value (&lt;0.2 \u03c0) and starts to gradually build up again. <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a> contains a histogram of the measured PS. The distribution has a maximum at\u00a0~0.6 \u03c0 with a relatively small number of micrographs exhibiting low (&lt;0.2 \u03c0) or high (&gt;0.8 \u03c0) PS. The evolving PS of the VPP is an advantage for single particle analysis because it moves the positions of the CTF zeros thus mitigating the need to vary the defocus, which is necessary with DPC. With the VPP, datasets can be collected with a single, low defocus value."

In addition, there is some variation in the PS magnitude between different areas on the phase plate (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). In practice, it is advantageous to have a VPP with slower PS development because this allows collection of more images at each position. The heater used in the original VPP paper (<a href=\"#bib6\">Danev et al., 2014</a>) was a pre-production prototype and the phase plate was homemade thus the production versions used in this work seem to exhibit a faster PS development. The variation of the PS across VPP areas could indicate a local variation in the quality of the amorphous carbon film. Overall, those factors do not prevent the collection of high quality data, as illustrated by the results presented here, but there is definitely room for improvement and we hope that manufacturers will take those observations into account when they develop future versions of the hardware."

Histograms of the measured defocus values are shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>. The distribution of the 300 nm target defocus data is wider than the 500 nm one but this seems to be caused by the systematic defocus oscillations and not by random focusing errors (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). The 300 nm target defocus had a practical disadvantage in that fitting the CTFs of micrographs with defocus\u00a0&lt;300 nm was difficult because the CTF has fewer rings and their period is similar to power spectrum features, such as the amorphous ice ring at\u00a0~3.7 \u00c5.

We approximated the central spot of the VPP with a Gaussian function which has only one parameter \u2013 the size of the spot.

The first few images after moving the VPP to a new position have a low PS which quickly develops (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> in <a href=\"#bib5\">Danev and Baumeister, 2016</a>). In those images there may be noticeable PS evolution throughout the multiframe movie. A CTF fit taking into account such evolution is possible, but in general, throwing away such images has little effect on the data acquisition throughput. For high PS images, the CTF model can, in principle, be modified to include the central VPP spot which should improve their handling. However, it is best to avoid both low and high PS images which could be achieved through an improved data acquisition strategy. An optimal solution would be to incorporate PS monitoring in the automated data acquisition software through on-the-fly CTF fitting of the acquired images. Once the PS reaches a preset value, e.g. 0.8 \u03c0, the VPP is advanced to the next position and pre-irradiated for a given time to build up a desired initial PS, e.g. 0.2 \u03c0, before continuing the acquisition. The dataset presented here was acquired with less frequent changes of the VPP position and without throwing away the first few images in order to explore the effect of PS on the quality of the data."

Future modifications of the data acquisition software, to include on-the-fly CTF fitting, PS monitoring and VPP pre-irradiation, would improve the performance by preventing the collection of low and high PS images.

The super-resolution movies were first converted to MRC format with the <i>newstack</i> from IMOD (<a href=\"#bib13\">Mastronarde and Held, 2016</a>), which increased their size to 5.1 GB/movie. Magnification anisotropy correction (measured to be 1.2%) and gain normalization were performed with <i>mag_distortion_correct</i> (<a href=\"#bib7\">Grant and Grigorieff, 2015</a>). The movie frames were aligned with <i>unblur</i> (<a href=\"#bib1\">Campbell et al., 2012</a>). Particles were picked by template matching in Gautomatch (<a href=\"http://www.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/kzhang/\">http://www.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/kzhang/</a>). The CTFs were fitted with a homemade program in MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick, MA). The rest of the processing was performed in the GPU-accelerated beta version of Relion 2.0 (<a href=\"#bib11\">Kimanius et al., 2016</a>). Particles were extracted from the aligned super-resolution micrographs and movies with 2x downsampling, resulting in a pixels size of 1.054\u00a0\u00c5, matching the physical pixel size of the camera. The box size after downsampling was 180 pixels. The initial dataset of 145,870 particles was subjected to a 3D refinement with D7 symmetry which reached a resolution of 2.6 \u00c5 with a B-factor of 111 \u00c5<sup>2</sup>. The output of the refinement was used to \u2018polish\u2019 the particles with the following parameters: running average three frames, stddev on translations one pixel, stddev on particle distance 100 pixels, B-factor highres-limit 2 \u00c5, B-factor lowres-limit 7 \u00c5. The polished dataset was 3D classified into five classes over several steps with finer and finer angular and translational sampling and E-step resolution limit of 12 \u00c5. The best class, containing 93,596 particles (64% of the dataset), was 3D refined producing the final reconstruction with a resolution of 2.4 \u00c5 and a B-factor of 74 \u00c5<sup>2</sup>. The other 3D classes refined to much lower resolutions with one of them showing some structure deformation in the form of separation between the top and bottom halves of the 20S. This was probably due to an incomplete assembly of some particles rather than being a valid functional state. To produce the resolution vs particle number data, subsets of random particles were extracted from the final dataset and 3D refined separately with a 60 \u00c5 low-pass filtered initial reference. The local resolution distributions were calculated with <i>blocres</i> from Bsoft (<a href=\"#bib8\">Heymann and Belnap, 2007</a>)."

The reduced dose-weighting parameter was determined empirically by trying different values and selecting the value which produced the highest resolution reconstructions. The CTFs were fitted on the non-dose-weighted micrographs with ctffind4 (<a href=\"#bib15\">Rohou and Grigorieff, 2015</a>) version 4.1.5 using the following parameters: spherical aberration 2.62 mm, minimum resolution 20 \u00c5, maximum resolution 3 \u00c5, minimum defocus 3000 \u00c5, maximum defocus 7000 \u00c5, minimum phase shift 0 deg, maximum phase shift 175 deg, phase shift step 10 deg. Micrographs with estimated CTF resolution of less than 3.5 \u00c5 were discarded (48 micrographs) leaving 379 micrographs for processing. Particle picking and 3D classification was performed in the same fashion as described above. 83,127 particles from the best 3D class were 3D refined producing a final reconstruction with a resolution of 2.4 \u00c5 and a B-factor of 85 \u00c5<sup>2</sup>."

Whereas last year the authors used the VPP in-focus, in this paper they collected data with a small defocus. This makes data collection easier, provides an estimate of the evolving value of the phase shift, as well as a more accurate estimate of deviations of the image defocus from the intended value. The resulting improvement in resolution, along with the decrease in the number of particles required to reach a given resolution, represents a very important advance. The resulting map is of a remarkably high resolution (up to 2.2A resolution), which proves that the VPP itself does not impose practical restrictions on currently attainable resolutions in single-particle analysis of biological samples. The paper is well written, and the results are of high interest to anyone interested in structural biology. The reviewers were therefore unanimously supportive of publication in <i>eLife</i>, provided the below is taken into account."

In addition, the different ways of data processing differ in multiple aspects (picking algorithms, dose-weighting, CTF estimation, different particles subsets, etc.), which makes it hard to assess where the advantages of one method over the other actually lie. Probably a more rigorous comparison of the different approaches would be better suited for publication elsewhere.
