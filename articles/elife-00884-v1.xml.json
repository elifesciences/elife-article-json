Cellular actin networks contain multiple NPFs, but how they coordinately regulate Arp2/3 complex is unclear. Cortactin is an NPF that activates Arp2/3 complex weakly on its own, but with WASP/N-WASP, another class of NPFs, potently activates. We dissect the mechanism of synergy and propose a model in which cortactin displaces N-WASP from nascent branches as a prerequisite for nucleation. Single-molecule imaging revealed that unlike WASP/N-WASP, cortactin remains bound to junctions during nucleation, and specifically targets junctions with a \u223c160-fold increased on rate over filament sides. N-WASP must be dimerized for potent synergy, and targeted mutations indicate release of dimeric N-WASP from nascent branches limits nucleation. Mathematical modeling shows cortactin-mediated displacement but not N-WASP recycling or filament recruitment models can explain synergy. Our results provide a molecular basis for coordinate Arp2/3 complex regulation."

Cellular actin networks contain multiple NPFs, but how they coordinately regulate Arp2/3 complex is unclear. Cortactin is an NPF that activates Arp2/3 complex weakly on its own, but with WASP/N-WASP, another class of NPFs, potently activates. We dissect the mechanism of synergy and propose a model in which cortactin displaces N-WASP from nascent branches as a prerequisite for nucleation. Single-molecule imaging revealed that unlike WASP/N-WASP, cortactin remains bound to junctions during nucleation, and specifically targets junctions with a \u223c160-fold increased on rate over filament sides. N-WASP must be dimerized for potent synergy, and targeted mutations indicate release of dimeric N-WASP from nascent branches limits nucleation. Mathematical modeling shows cortactin-mediated displacement but not N-WASP recycling or filament recruitment models can explain synergy. Our results provide a molecular basis for coordinate Arp2/3 complex regulation."

According to this scheme, N-WASP (or another type I NPF), the Arp2/3 complex and two actin molecules are bound at the site of a future branch on an actin filament, poised for branch formation. However, before more actin molecules can be added, N-WASP must be released, either slowly on its own\u2014as Smith et al. also report in findings published concurrently in <i>eLife</i>\u2014or rapidly with the help of cortactin or other type II NPFs."

The V and C regions of VCA bind actin monomers (<a href=\"#bib30\">Kelly et al., 2006</a>), and CA binds two sites on Arp2/3 complex (<a href=\"#bib44\">Padrick et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Ti et al., 2011</a>). Chemical crosslinking assays demonstrate that one CA site is on Arp3 and the other spans Arp2 and ARPC1 (<a href=\"#bib44\">Padrick et al., 2011</a>). Using two CA binding sites, VCA is thought to recruit actin monomers to the Arp2 and Arp3 subunits, stimulating a conformational rearrangement to create an Arp2-Arp3-actin hetero-oligomer that mimics a stable actin filament nucleus (<a href=\"#bib44\">Padrick et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Hetrick et al., 2013</a>).

Cortactin contains an N-terminal acidic region (NtA), which interacts with Arp2/3 complex, 6.5 actin filament binding repeat sequences, and a C-terminal SH3 domain (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Mutations in the NtA that block its interaction with Arp2/3 complex prevent assembly of actin in protrusive structures in transformed cells called invadopodia, and hinder actin-dependent vesicle trafficking required for lamellipodial protrusion and cellular motility (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bryce et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Ayala et al., 2008</a>). These observations demonstrate that cortactin plays an important role in regulating Arp2/3 complex in vivo, yet the precise mechanism of Arp2/3 complex activation is unclear. Because the actin filament-binding repeats are required for activation, it has been hypothesized that cortactin recruits Arp2/3 complex to filaments to stimulate nucleation (<a href=\"#bib57\">Uruno et al., 2001</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). However, whether filament recruitment can explain the acceleration of branching nucleation is unknown. In addition, cortactin on its own is a weak activator of Arp2/3 complex in vitro (<a href=\"#bib62\">Weed et al., 2000</a>), making it uncertain how cortactin can contribute to branching nucleation in vivo."

Consistent with this hypothesis, WASP/Scar proteins and cortactin co-localize in many branched networks in vivo, including at the leading edge of motile cells, podosomes and invadopodia, and at sites of endocytosis (<a href=\"#bib42\">Martinez-Quiles et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">DesMarais et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Grassart et al., 2010</a>). Previous data showed that N-WASP and cortactin compete for binding to Arp3 (<a href=\"#bib60\">Weaver et al., 2002</a>), and cortactin competes more strongly when Arp2/3 complex is bound to filaments (<a href=\"#bib56\">Uruno et al., 2003</a>), but the precise mechanism of synergy is unknown<i>.</i> Previously proposed models include scenarios in which cortactin recruits Arp2/3 complex to the mother filament, where it cooperates with VCA to activate nucleation or induces release of VCA from branch-incorporated Arp2/3 complex to stabilize the nucleus (<a href=\"#bib60\">Weaver et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Uruno et al., 2003</a>). In another model, VCA becomes sequestered at branch junctions, so the concentration of VCA available to activate Arp2/3 complex limits the rate of branching nucleation (<a href=\"#bib52\">Siton et al., 2011</a>). In this model, called the recycling model, cortactin binding displaces VCA from branch junctions, recycling it back into solution for more activation."

Using single-molecule total internal reflection fluorescence (smTIRF) microscopy along with biochemical assays and mathematical modeling, we show that neither a filament recruitment nor a VCA recycling model can explain synergy. Our data instead support an obligatory displacement model, in which cortactin directly targets nascent branch junctions to accelerate the release of VCA. A key concept of the model is that VCA release is required for nucleation, either with or without cortactin, and the VCA release rate modulates the rate of nucleation. We dissect the biochemical requirements for synergy in cortactin and N-WASP to show that oligomerization of N-WASP VCA is required for significant synergy, but the actin filament binding repeats of cortactin are not. In addition, we provide evidence that slow release of N-WASP at nascent branch junctions limits nucleation rates, and that synergy is dependent on the ability of cortactin to accelerate this step. Our data provide important mechanistic insights into the regulation of Arp2/3 complex by cortactin, and lay the foundation for a molecular understanding of how NPFs work together to regulate branching nucleation."

First, Arp2/3 complex must bind to the side of a pre-existing filament to be activated (<a href=\"#bib1\">Achard et al., 2010</a>), and kinetic measurements of pyrene-labeled <i>S. pombe</i> Arp2/3 complex indicated this binding step is slow (<a href=\"#bib4\">Beltzner and Pollard, 2008</a>). Second, deletion of the actin filament binding domain of cortactin abolished its weak intrinsic nucleation activity (<a href=\"#bib57\">Uruno et al., 2001</a>). Finally, cortactin increases copelleting of Arp2/3 complex with actin filaments (<a href=\"#bib8\">Cai et al., 2008</a>). To determine if filament recruitment can explain synergistic activation, we first constructed a mathematical model to describe branching nucleation in the presence of GST-VCA and Arp2/3 complex without cortactin (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). Our goal was to determine how the rate constants for actin filament binding by Arp2/3 complex influence polymerization time courses, and if recruitment of Arp2/3 complex by cortactin could account for the increased rates we measured in our bulk polymerization assays containing cortactin."

The off rate of Arp2/3 complex bound to a mother filament (k<sub>fil_off</sub>) was constrained based on the measured K<sub>D</sub>, 0.9 \u00b5M (<a href=\"#bib27\">Hetrick et al., 2013</a>). The model assumes that the final activation step (k<sub>nuc</sub>) occurs after two actin monomers have been recruited by GST-VCA (<a href=\"#bib44\">Padrick et al., 2011</a>). The model fit the experimental data well, showing a good visual fit to the time courses and a low residual sum of squares (1.3 \u00d7 10<sup>\u221211</sup>) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Optimization of the mother filament on rate showed that k<sub>fil_on</sub> approaches a minimum threshold (2.7 \u00d7 10<sup>3</sup> M<sup>\u22121</sup> s<sup>\u22121</sup>), beyond which, increases in the on rate do not improve the fit (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). We fixed the on rate at 1.4 \u00d7 10<sup>6</sup> M<sup>\u22121</sup> s<sup>\u22121</sup> based on modeling of reactions containing cortactin (see below and \u2018Materials and methods\u2019), and determined the optimized value for k<sub>nuc</sub> is 0.0038 s<sup>\u22121</sup>. This value is 320-fold smaller than the calculated off rate of the nascent branch complex from filament sides, consistent with smTIRF studies that show Arp2/3 complex binds and is released from filaments many times before nucleating a branch (<a href=\"#bib53\">Smith et al., 2013</a>)."

We mimicked the effect of recruitment by simulating an increase in the concentration of actin filaments to saturate Arp2/3 complex side binding. If synergy occurs purely through recruitment, the magnitude of polymerization rate increases caused by adding side-binding sites will be similar to cortactin-induced rate increases. Using k<sub>fil_on</sub> determined from the experimental data with cortactin (1.4 \u00d7 10<sup>6</sup> M<sup>\u22121</sup> s<sup>\u22121</sup>, see below, blue line in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>), we found that increasing side binding sites increased the polymerization rate, but could not account for the dramatic rate increases we observed in experiments containing cortactin (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). This suggests that filament recruitment cannot account for cortactin-mediated synergy. Because of the uncertainty in k<sub>fil_on</sub>, we repeated the simulations at additional k<sub>fil_on</sub> values. First, we used a k<sub>fil_on</sub> value (6.9 \u00d7 10<sup>5</sup> M<sup>\u22121</sup> s<sup>\u22121</sup>, purple line in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>) calculated from the experimentally determined filament off rate of budding yeast Arp2/3 complex (0.625 s<sup>\u22121</sup>) and the affinity of the bovine complex for filaments (<a href=\"#bib53\">Smith et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Hetrick et al., 2013</a>). This simulation also failed to account for experimentally observed synergy. However, in a simulation at the minimum threshold on rate (2.7 \u00d7 10<sup>3</sup> M<sup>\u22121</sup> s<sup>\u22121</sup>, green line in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>), filament recruitment could fully account for synergy. Therefore, while our best estimates of k<sub>fil_on</sub> suggest that actin filament recruitment cannot explain synergy, k<sub>fil_on</sub> is not determined well enough to completely eliminate the possibility that synergy occurs through recruitment."

We tested a range of concentrations of full-length cortactin and a construct containing only the NtA (residues 1\u201384) for their ability to synergize with GST-VCA. We found NtA was synergistic with GST-VCA, demonstrating that actin filament binding is not required for synergy (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). The concentration dependence of synergy for both constructs followed a hyperbolic trend, and the concentration of NtA required for half-maximal synergy was 11 \u00b5M, 110-fold higher than for full-length cortactin. However, at saturation, NtA was as potent as full-length cortactin, increasing the maximum polymerization rate 3.8-fold over GST-VCA-mediated activation of Arp2/3 complex. These data demonstrate that the NtA is sufficient for synergy, but that the actin filament binding repeats allow cortactin to synergize at lower concentrations."

                                "text": "To probe further the mechanism of synergy, we next asked if biochemical features of the type I NPF influence synergy. Dimerization of VCA is known to increase its binding affinity for Arp2/3 complex, and some evidence suggests WASP/Scar proteins function as oligomers in vivo (<a href=\"#bib43\">Padrick et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Gohl et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Footer et al., 2008</a>). Therefore, we compared cortactin-mediated synergy with monomeric vs GST-tagged N-WASP-VCA in a pyrene actin polymerization assay. In previous experiments, GST-VCA behaved similarly to WASP dimerized through physiological SH3-polyproline interactions, so artificial dimerization by GST can mimic in vivo dimerization mechanisms (<a href=\"#bib43\">Padrick et al., 2008</a>). Saturating cortactin enhanced the maximum polymerization rate of a reaction containing GST-VCA 3.7-fold over the rate without cortactin, whereas cortactin weakly influenced a reaction containing monomeric VCA, accelerating the reaction only \u223c1.5-fold over VCA alone (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Increasing the concentration of monomeric VCA did not increase synergy, suggesting the failure to observe potent synergy is not due to under-saturation of two CA binding sites on the complex (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,C</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). VCA dimerized with a leucine zipper (LZ-VCA) behaved identically to GST-VCA, demonstrating that the difference in synergy is due to the oligomerization state of the VCA rather than an artifact caused by GST (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>)."

For instance, if NtA and VCA simultaneously interact with Arp2/3 complex during activation, GST-VCA may be able to recruit two actin monomers while engaging only one NPF binding site, while VCA can only recruit one actin monomer (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Unlike WASP and Scar, native N-WASP contains tandem V regions and may be able to recruit two actin monomers to Arp2/3 complex (<a href=\"#bib49\">Rebowski et al., 2010</a>). Therefore, we made a monomeric N-WASP construct with both V regions (VVCA) and tested its ability to synergize with cortactin. We found that VVCA is not synergistic with cortactin at any concentration (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,B</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

We next explored the importance of the affinity of the type I NPF for Arp2/3 complex in synergy. Based on a number of observations, we hypothesized that type I NPF release is required for nucleation, and that tight binding of the type I NPF can slow the final activation step. First, we observed that at saturation, VCA is a better activator of Arp2/3 complex than GST-VCA (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Second, recent single-molecule imaging experiments show that WASP dissociates from the branch junctions before elongation of the daughter filament (<a href=\"#bib41\">Martin et al., 2006</a>) (<a href=\"#bib53\">Smith et al., 2013</a>, in press at eLife). Finally, crystal structures show that the V region may block the barbed end of actin monomers, preventing interactions with incoming actin monomers required for elongation (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chereau et al., 2005</a>). Therefore, we hypothesized that cortactin synergizes with GST-VCA by displacing it from the nascent branch complex, increasing the rate of the final activation step by accelerating the obligatory release of GST-VCA (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>)."

We reasoned that this mutation would decrease the affinity of GST-VCA for the nascent branch junction, but still allow V to recruit actin monomers to the Arp2/3 complex (<a href=\"#bib12\">Co et al., 2007</a>). We predicted that in the absence of cortactin, saturating concentrations of this mutant would have a higher maximal polymerization rate, because it would release from the nascent branch junction faster than wild-type GST-VCA. Consistent with this prediction, the maximal polymerization rate at saturation was increased 2.5-fold in the R442A mutant compared to wild type (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). The obligatory displacement model predicts that cortactin will be less synergistic with the GST-VCA(R442A) mutant because of its higher intrinsic off rate from the nascent branch complex. Our data are also consistent with this prediction. In the presence of the R442A mutant, cortactin showed approximately twofold less synergy compared to the wild-type GST-VCA (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). As an additional test of the model, we made a V region mutation, E455R, which we predicted would bind more tightly to actin monomers and the nascent branch junction. Based on mutational data and a crystal structure of the V region of WIP bound to actin, an E455R mutation was predicted to interact favorably with Glu93 on the surface of actin (<a href=\"#bib16\">Didry et al., 2011</a>) (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Interestingly, this mutation had no influence on the affinity of N-WASP-VCA for actin monomers (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). However, it decreased the maximal polymerization rate at saturation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>) and increased synergy with cortactin (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). This suggests that the E455R/E93 interaction may occur only in the context of the nascent branch junction.

The multivalent architecture of its actin binding domain led us to hypothesize that cortactin may find branch junctions by diffusing along actin filaments through multiple weak and dynamic interactions, similar to the actin binding protein VASP (<a href=\"#bib26\">Hansen and Mullins, 2010</a>). To test this, we labeled cortactin (residues 1\u2013336) with Alexa-568 and actin monomers with Oregon-Green 488 and visualized their interactions using TIRF microscopy. Single-molecules of cortactin bound to and dissociated from actin filaments during the time courses of the videos (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>; <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>).

To test this, we visualized single molecules of cortactin with preformed branch junctions. Cortactin added to a TIRF chamber with preformed branches bound to both filament sides and branch junctions (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>, <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>). The off rate of cortactin for branch junctions was 0.034 s<sup>\u22121</sup>, almost twofold slower than the off rate for preformed filament sides measured from the same reaction (0.063 s<sup>\u22121</sup>) (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). Interestingly, 30% of the 270 tracked cortactin molecules were bound to branch junctions even though branches made up only \u223c0.13% (68 branch junctions vs \u223c53,000 filament side binding sites) of total cortactin binding sites (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C,D</a>). This suggests that cortactin binds with a significantly higher affinity to branch junctions than filament sides. A twofold change in the off rate is unlikely to account for this difference. To determine if cortactin binds to branch junctions with a higher on rate than filament sides, we first measured the affinity of cortactin for branch junctions and filament sides using the single-molecule data. We counted the total number of bound cortactin molecules, branch junctions and side binding sites in each frame and calculated the average fraction of cortactin bound over hundreds of frames. Using the average fraction bound, we determined that the affinity of cortactin for branch junctions is \u223c300-fold greater than for filament sides: 17 nM vs 5.2 \u00b5M, respectively (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>). Using these equilibrium constants and our previously measured off rates, the calculated on rates of cortactin for branch junctions and filament sides are 2.0 \u00d7 10<sup>6</sup> M<sup>\u22121</sup> s<sup>\u22121</sup> and 1.2 \u00d7 10<sup>4</sup> M<sup>\u22121</sup> s<sup>\u22121</sup>, respectively. Our data show that cortactin targets branch junctions by binding over two orders of magnitude more tightly to junctions than filament sides. High affinity binding to branch junctions is accomplished through a \u223c160-fold increase in the on rate and further amplified by a \u223ctwofold decrease in the off rate. These data explain how cortactin can specifically target nascent branch junctions to displace N-WASP."

To test this prediction, we visualized single-molecules of cortactin in a reaction during active branching nucleation. We observed multiple instances (n = 66) in which cortactin bound to the side of a filament where a daughter filament was later nucleated (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A,B</a>, <a href=\"#media4\">Videos 4 and 5</a>). In each instance, cortactin remained bound to the branch junction after nucleation, consistent with the predictions of the obligatory displacement model. The average lifetime at the junction after nucleation was 62 s, 2.1-fold longer than the average lifetime of cortactin binding to a preformed branch junction (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>). The average lifetime before nucleation was 6.5 s. While the accuracy of pre- and post-nucleation lifetime measurements is limited by our ability to resolve newly formed daughter filaments, the data clearly indicate that cortactin stays bound to the junctions long after nucleation. During active branching, cortactin bound existing branch junctions with an average lifetime of 29.5 s, the same lifetime found using preformed filament reactions (29.1 s). Interestingly, the lifetime of cortactin molecules on filament sides was 2.0\u20132.5-fold lower (8.0 s) than with preformed filaments or polymerizing filaments in the absence of Arp2/3 complex. We cannot currently explain this result, but speculate that it may be due to conformational changes in the filament caused by Arp2/3 complex binding."

To test this, we labeled an NtA fragment (residues 1\u201348) with Alexa-568 and visualized it during branching reactions. Single-molecules of NtA were observed bound to existing branch junctions and to nascent branches from which new daughter filaments nucleated (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a> and <a href=\"#media6\">Video 6</a>). These data indicate that NtA can directly engage Arp2/3 complex after and during branch nucleation and that it does not block daughter filament elongation. This observation is consistent with pyrene actin polymerization assays showing NtA does not inhibit nucleation even at high micromolar concentrations (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>) (<a href=\"#bib60\">Weaver et al., 2002</a>)."

This model was similar to the recruitment model described above, but included additional reactions to account for cortactin interactions with filament sides and at nascent branch junctions (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). We used the kinetic rate constants determined from our single-molecule experiments to describe these reactions, and assumed that cortactin binds to the nascent branch junction with the same rate constants as mature branch junctions. Following cortactin binding to the nascent branch junction, we added a cortactin-mediated displacement activation step (k<sub>dis</sub>) analogous to the GST-VCA-dependent activation step (k<sub>nuc</sub>). Full time courses of pyrene-actin polymerization at a range of cortactin concentrations were fit with the new model, allowing only k<sub>dis</sub> and k<sub>fil_on</sub> to float while k<sub>fil_off</sub> was constrained by the previously measured K<sub>D</sub> value (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>). This model fit the experimental data well (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B,C</a>). A plot of the half time to reach equilibrium (t<sub>1/2</sub>) vs cortactin concentration indicated that t<sub>1/2</sub> decreased identically in both the model and the experimental data, and both showed a t<sub>1/2</sub> of about 80 s at saturating cortactin (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9D</a>). As in the simulations of reactions without cortactin, k<sub>fil_on</sub> had a minimal threshold value, but in these simulations the minimum value was \u223c500-fold greater, 1.4 \u00d7 10<sup>6</sup> M<sup>\u22121</sup> s<sup>\u22121</sup> (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C</a>). Above the threshold, the optimized value for displacement activation (k<sub>dis</sub>) was 0.036 s<sup>\u22121</sup>, 10-fold higher than the activation step in the absence of cortactin, k<sub>nuc</sub> (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C</a>). The simplifications and assumptions made in the construction of the model limit the precision of the optimized values in representing the true microscopic rate constants. Nevertheless, the kinetic pathway of the obligatory displacement model fits the experimental data well, indicating that this model can explain synergy."

In this model, called the recycling model, cortactin is hypothesized to prevent GST-VCA from being sequestered at branches, which could slow polymerization by limiting the concentration of GST-VCA in solution available to activate Arp2/3 complex. A key prediction of this model is that the concentration of free GST-VCA limits branching nucleation rates. To test this mechanism, we simulated recycling by forcing GST-VCA to remain bound after nucleation and introducing a single binding reaction whereby cortactin returns the branch junction-bound GST-VCA to the pool of non-sequestered GST-VCA (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We attempted to use this model to fit time courses of pyrene actin polymerization containing Arp2/3 complex, GST-VCA and a range of concentrations of cortactin. The recycling displacement model could not fit the data because increasing concentrations of cortactin had no influence on modeled polymerization rates. To determine why, we plotted the concentration of sequestered GST-VCA during the modeled time courses at various concentrations of cortactin. In the absence of cortactin, only 3.8% of the total GST-VCA was sequestered at the end of the reaction (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9E</a>). Addition of cortactin reduced the concentration of sequestered GST-VCA, but did not influence the polymerization rate because the free GST-VCA concentration did not limit the rate of the reaction. Therefore, the recycling model cannot account for the synergistic activation of Arp2/3 complex we observe in our assays."

Our data support an obligatory displacement model in which cortactin specifically targets nascent branch junctions to displace GST-VCA, thereby accelerating nucleation (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>). In this model, GST-VCA, two actin monomers and Arp2/3 complex assemble on the side of a filament, creating a nascent branch junction. Cortactin targets the junction, making a multivalent interaction with Arp2/3 complex and the adjacent mother filament. At the nascent branch junction, NtA can compete with CA at the Arp3 binding site on the complex, as previously reported (<a href=\"#bib60\">Weaver et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Padrick et al., 2008</a>). Release of one CA speeds release of the GST-VCA, allowing nucleation and elongation to proceed. Importantly, NtA does not block elongation, as we demonstrate by visualizing labeled NtA at nascent branch junctions during nucleation/elongation. Rather, NtA stays engaged with Arp2/3 complex and the repeats stay bound to the mother filament after elongation, allowing cortactin to remain tightly bound to the mature branch junction. Our smTIRF measurements are consistent with immuno-gold-labeled electron micrographs and three-dimensional EM reconstructions that show cortactin remains at the mature branch junction (<a href=\"#bib8\">Cai et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Egile et al., 2005</a>). The obligatory displacement model is also consistent with the observation that cortactin competes weakly with GST-VCA in the absence of filaments, but strongly in their presence (<a href=\"#bib56\">Uruno et al., 2003</a>)."

                        "text": "A key aspect of the obligatory displacement model is that GST-VCA must be released before nucleation. Our mutational analyses support this requirement, since a mutation in the V region that decreased its affinity for actin increased the rate of nucleation at saturating GST-VCA, suggesting weakened interactions with the nascent branch junction can increase nucleation rates. Additional evidence comes from recent single-molecule TIRF experiments, which show that VCA release precedes elongation of the daughter filament (<a href=\"#bib41\">Martin et al., 2006</a>) (<a href=\"#bib53\">Smith et al., 2013</a>, in press at eLife). Why release of the type I NPF is programmed into the branching nucleation mechanism, at least in the case of dimerized N-WASP-VCA, is not clear. One possibility is that because WASP/Scar proteins are attached to membranes (<a href=\"#bib28\">Higgs and Pollard, 2000</a>), incorporation of the release step into the nucleation mechanism ensures branches are not strongly tethered to the membrane as the growing actin network pushes outward on it<i>.</i> In support of this hypothesis, Akin et al. showed that increasing transient connections between bead-immobilized NPFs and nascent branch junctions decreased bead motility (<a href=\"#bib2\">Akin and Mullins, 2008</a>). Our data suggest cortactin could stimulate release of a membrane bound NPF from Arp2/3 complex to regulate network-substrate connections, providing an additional mode by which cortactin can control the dynamics of branched actin networks. Recent experiments showed that addition of cortactin to a solution of GST-VCA coated beads increased the bead motility to an extent unlikely to be accounted for simply by an increased nucleation rate (<a href=\"#bib52\">Siton et al., 2011</a>). Therefore, cortactin may stimulate branched network dynamics both by increasing nucleation rates and by preventing stalling caused by tight membrane-network attachments."

Our single-molecule experiments revealed the kinetic basis for targeting. Instead of diffusing along filament sides to find branch junctions, cortactin targets branches using a \u223c300-fold increased affinity over filament sides. Most of the binding preference arises from an unusually slow on rate (12,100 M<sup>\u22121</sup> s<sup>\u22121</sup>) of cortactin for filament sides. This on rate is 200\u20132000-fold slower than for most other actin filament binding proteins, and is unlikely to be diffusion limited (<a href=\"#bib33\">Kov\u00e1cs et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">De La Cruz et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Wegner and Ruhnau, 1988</a>). Binding may be slow because it requires a conformational change in filaments, in agreement with an electron microscopy reconstruction showing that cortactin binding widens the gap between protofilaments (<a href=\"#bib45\">Pant et al., 2006</a>). Our mathematical model of obligatory displacement did not include reactions in which cortactin binds filament sides before Arp2/3 complex rather than targeting an existing nascent branch junction. While these pathways can be inserted into the model, we note that in the case of the NtA construct, synergy must occur completely through nascent branch targeting, suggesting nascent branch targeting may be the dominant displacement pathway for the full-length protein. Additional multi-color smTIRF experiments will be required to fully map out the kinetic pathways."

                        "text": "We showed the actin filament binding repeats of cortactin are not required for synergy, eliminating an actin filament recruitment mechanism. While it is possible that recruitment operates simultaneously with displacement in full-length cortactin, we observed that saturating concentrations of NtA activated nucleation to the same extent as saturating full-length cortactin, so there is no recruitment component of synergy that cannot be mimicked by NtA. The high concentrations of NtA required for saturation likely reflect the decreased affinity of NtA for the nascent branch junction caused by removal of the actin filament binding repeats. Importantly, cortactin can weakly activate Arp2/3 complex on its own (<a href=\"#bib62\">Weed et al., 2000</a>), and in contrast to synergy, this intrinsic activity requires the filament binding repeats (<a href=\"#bib57\">Uruno et al., 2001</a>). Therefore, filament recruitment may explain the weak intrinsic activity of cortactin observed in vitro. Our data are inconsistent with a previously proposed recycling model of synergy, in which cortactin indirectly increases nucleation rates by recycling WASP sequestered at mature branch junctions, freeing it to activate Arp2/3 complex (<a href=\"#bib52\">Siton et al., 2011</a>). Instead, our data indicate that cortactin directly influences nucleation at nascent branch junctions. These biochemical distinctions will have important implications in understanding the influence of cortactin on the regulation of Arp2/3 complex in vivo."

The average lifetime of cortactin at branch junctions was 29.2 s, whereas the lifetime of branches has been reported to be between 8 and 27 min (<a href=\"#bib41\">Martin et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Mahaffy and Pollard, 2006</a>). Given these data, cortactin dissociates from branches much more rapidly than branches disassemble. However, cortactin has a high affinity for junctions (K<sub>D</sub> = 17 nM), so it likely dissociates and rebinds branches many times during the life of a branch, even when present at low (nanomolar) concentrations. Therefore, cortactin dynamically stabilizes branch junctions. This mechanism is consistent with FRAP experiments that show cortactin is incorporated into treadmilling networks not just at the leading edge but also throughout the entire network, and exchanges rapidly (<a href=\"#bib36\">Lai et al., 2008</a>). Importantly, in vivo treadmilling networks turn over on much shorter timescales than in vitro branch lifetimes (<a href=\"#bib36\">Lai et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Martin et al., 2006</a>). In cells, the competition of cortactin with branch disassembly factors like GMF, coronin1B, and cofilin may be more important than the intrinsic branch stabilizing activity of cortactin (<a href=\"#bib21\">Gandhi et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Cai et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Blanchoin et al., 2000</a>)."

In single-molecule studies, complications arise from the lack of simple methods to directly measure on rates for filaments (<a href=\"#bib58\">Van Oijen, 2011</a>). Off rates can generally be determined directly from the lifetimes of the on state, but difficulties arise from the complexity of interactions of Arp2/3 complex with filaments. For example, budding yeast Arp2/3 complex dissociated from filaments with three distinct off rates, indicating a heterogeneous population of dissociating species (<a href=\"#bib53\">Smith et al., 2013</a>). Filament binding rate constants are important for not only understanding how Arp2/3 complex works with type I NPFs like WASP/N-WASP, but also how other regulators control Arp2/3 complex activity by mediating its interactions with filaments. The advent of three-color smTIRF experiments will be critical in allowing us to dissect these interactions."

We hypothesize that this is because dimerized type I NPFs engage both Arp2/3 complex binding sites to bind tightly to nascent branch junctions, thereby slowing the nucleation step. In our assays, we artificially oligomerized N-WASP, but in vivo, N-WASP can oligomerize by association with scaffolding proteins like Nck or BAR domain proteins (<a href=\"#bib43\">Padrick et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Li et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Suetsugu, 2013</a>). SCAR/WAVE, another widely expressed type I NPF, has also been shown to oligomerize or cluster on membranes, suggesting it can also act as a higher order oligomer (<a href=\"#bib23\">Gohl et al., 2010</a>). These observations suggest the potential for cortactin-mediated synergy to activate Arp2/3 complex in multiple distinct branched networks in vivo. We note that in addition to Arp2/3 complex, cortactin has dozens of other binding partners, including some that influence its ability to regulate branched networks (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kirkbride et al., 2011</a>). For instance, cortactin binding to WIP, an actin momomer binding protein, greatly enhances cortactin-mediated activation of Arp2/3 complex (<a href=\"#bib31\">Kinley et al., 2003</a>). In addition, the SH3 of cortactin binds N-WASP to relieve its autoinhibition, providing an indirect mechanism for cortactin to upregulate branching nucleation (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kowalski et al., 2005</a>). Biochemical dissection of these reactions will allow us to understand precisely how cortactin coordinates branched networks in vivo."

Firm, even pressure was applied to the slide to secure it to the cover slip tape. The resulting assembly contains a 5 mm \u00d7 24 mm \u00d7 0.1 mm (tape height) reaction chamber with openings on two sides for reaction solution addition and exchange. Solution exchange was performed by using Whatman paper to wick out the chamber solution from one end resulting in the uptake of the new solution into the chamber, from the opposite end."

Single cortactin molecules were identified in each 561-channel image using thresholding image segmentation after removal of noise using a band pass filter. Single-molecule trajectories were created by identifying and linking identical molecules between frames using a nearest neighbor algorithm. An assembled trajectory represents a single-molecule and contains a preliminary frame-based lifetime. All identified molecules were filtered based on the following criteria: Molecule cannot be present in the first or last frame of the image acquisition period, molecule cannot have a lifetime of 1 frame, molecule average intensity must be within a standard deviation of the overall molecular average intensity and the molecule must be associated with an actin filament based on filament identification statistics performed on the corresponding 488-channel images. The molecules that passed the filter were manually tracked to verify the initially determined frame lifetime and to identify the binding class (filament side, branch junction, nascent branch). We identified branches manually by visually inspecting videos. Potential branches were examined in multiple frames to verify that they were not overlapping linear actin filaments. Lifetimes were converted from frames to seconds based on calculated frame rates from image time stamps, and binned into 5 s intervals. The cumulative frequency across all bins was calculated and a plot of 1- cumulative frequency vs lifetime (bin) was fit with a single-exponential decay equation to determine the average off rate from which the average lifetime is the reciprocal."

Start of equilibrium binding was determined from a plot of number of particles vs frame. Number of filament binding sites was calculated for each frame at equilibrium (829 frames) by a custom image processing script run in Matlab, described as follows. For each frame, pixels corresponding to filament fluorescence were identified using image segmentation followed by morphological area opening to remove non-filamentous small fluorescent objects. Pixels corresponding to branch junctions (5 pixels per junction) were subtracted from the total number of pixels and this new number of pixels was divided by 3 (average filament width in pixels) to remove pixels corresponding to the PSF of the filament fluorescence. The final pixel number value was converted to micrometers (1 px = 106.7 nm) to yield the total length of actin filaments in the image frame, and further converted to number of subunits using 370 subunits \u00b5m<sup>\u22121</sup> (<a href=\"#bib35\">Kuhn and Pollard, 2005</a>). A 4% error in total filament length was found between using the above algorithm and manual filament tracing on a small subsection of filaments; therefore, the described length calculation algorithm works well for the extensive length measurements needed. The total number of cortactin filament side binding sites was calculated by assuming a cortactin to F-actin subunit stoichiometry of 1:6. The total number of branch junctions was visually counted in each frame. For each frame, the fraction bound of actin for each binding group was calculated by dividing the total number of counted molecules by the total number of binding sites. The affinity for each binding group was calculated, assuming excess ligand conditions (see below), using the equation: <math id=\"inf1\"><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"italic\">Kd</mi><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mrow><mrow><mo>[</mo><mi mathvariant=\"italic\">cortactin</mi><mo>]</mo></mrow></mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"italic\">fraction</mi><mo>\u00a0</mo><mi mathvariant=\"italic\">bound</mi></mrow></mfrac><mo>\u2212</mo><mrow><mo>[</mo><mi mathvariant=\"italic\">cortactin</mi><mo>]</mo></mrow></mrow></math>, where fraction bound is the average across all analyzed frames and concentration of cortactin is 1.5 nM."

The average number of cortactin molecules bound to junctions or filaments sides per image frame was 20. Because unbound actin filaments were washed out of the chamber, all binding events occurred on the surface, so this number allows us to account for all actin-bound cortactin molecules in the chamber. Using the chamber-to-image ratio (2.48 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22125</sup>), this gives an average number of cortactin molecules bound per chamber of 8.06 \u00d7 10<sup>5</sup>.

Kinetic rate constants for GST-VCA binding to Arp2/3 complex have not been measured, so we used k<sub>on</sub> values measured for monomeric VCA and adjusted the k<sub>off</sub> to account for the previously measured tighter binding of GST-VCA to Arp2/3 complex (<a href=\"#bib43\">Padrick et al., 2008</a>). We decreased the k<sub>on</sub> of actin for GST-VCA bound to Arp2/3 complex and increased the k<sub>off</sub> of GST-VCA:actin from Arp2/3 complex to account for competition between the complex and C for actin binding (<a href=\"#bib30\">Kelly et al., 2006</a>). We modeled the Arp2/3 complex activating nucleation step (k<sub>nuc</sub>) by converting the nascent branch junction of two actin monomers bound to GST-VCA bound to Arp2/3 complex at a filament side to a barbed end which subsequently elongated at 11.6 \u00d7 10<sup>6</sup> M<sup>\u22121</sup> s<sup>\u22121</sup> (<a href=\"#bib46\">Pollard, 1986</a>).

They conclude that displacement of dimeric WASP(VCA) is limiting for branch formation, and that cortactin accelerates the branching reaction primarily by displacing WASP(VCA). In support of this model, they show that: 1) actin filament recruitment cannot account for cortactin activity. Here, the strongest experiment is the demonstration that actin filament binding activity is not required for maximal cortactin stimulation because the minimal NtA domain (which lacks the actin filament binding repeats) stimulates to the same extent, at saturation, as full length cortactin; 2) VCA dimerization is required for cortactin stimulation and, nicely, mutations that alter the rate of N-WASP dissociation alter actin polymerization (and the degree of cortactin stimulation) as predicted by the model (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>); 3) cortactin binds preferentially to branch sites because it associates much faster onto branch sites than onto the sides of actin filaments, and also dissociates a bit slower (direct visualization/binding studies, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4 and 5</a>), and can remain there as the actin filament nucleates and elongates (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>, lifetime measurements); and 4) simulations reveal that data for GST-VCA and cortactin co-stimulation of actin polymerization can be explained by a displacement model, but not by a VCA recycling vs sequestration model (because GST-VCA binding does not significantly deplete the pool of free GST-VCA)."

The authors argue that the difference between dimeric vs monomeric VCA data is that the off rate of monomeric VCA is sufficiently high that cortactin, at the concentrations explored, does not play a role in displacing it. Does the apparent lack of synergy for monomeric VCA depend on VCA concentration or on Arp2/3 concentration? It might also be useful to extend the study to explore a broader range of concentrations. More importantly, the dimeric VCA formed with GST may have an artificially low off rate from the branch junction compared to two monomeric VCAs on a branch junction, making the observed \u2018displacement\u2019 relevant to the dimeric VCA construct but not relevant in vivo. The increased activation by monomeric VCA at saturation compared to dimeric VCA underscores this issue (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Can the authors address this concern?"

The authors argue that the difference between dimeric vs monomeric VCA data is that the off rate of monomeric VCA is sufficiently high that cortactin, at the concentrations explored, does not play a role in displacing it. Does the apparent lack of synergy for monomeric VCA depend on VCA concentration or on Arp2/3 concentration?

In support of this, we showed that VCA dimerized by a leucine zipper shows the same magnitude of synergy with cortactin as GST-VCA. While the leucine zipper and GST are artificial dimerizers, a number of SH3 domain-containing proteins can bind the polyproline stretches in WASP/Scar family proteins to create oligomers which activate Arp2/3 complex similarly to GST-VCA (<a href=\"#bib43\">Padrick et al., 2008</a>). We are currently generating reagents to test whether WASP dimerized in this more physiologically relevant manner shows the same potency in synergy as GST-VCA, but we have no reason to think it will not. One possibility is that the length of the linker between the V region and the dimerization domain could influence synergy. In our GST-VCA construct, the linker between GST and V is 16 amino acids long, similar to the distance between the polyproline stretch and the first V in full-length N-WASP (\u223c16 amino acids) and the V in WASP (\u223c13 amino acids), or Scar/WAVE (\u223c22 amino acids). The linker is longer in our LZ-VCA construct (27 amino acids), which behaves identically to GST-VCA. Together these observations suggest the behavior of the dimers is consistent within the range of linker lengths we expect for physiological dimers."

To our knowledge, there are few experiments that directly address the oligomerization state of these NPFs in a cell during Arp2/3 complex-dependent actin assembly (<a href=\"#bib23\">Gohl et al., 2010</a>). However, given the biochemical data it seems likely that many of these actin assembly processes depend on dimerization or higher order oligomerization of the NPF. Therefore the activity profile of GST-VCA in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a> (and its associated kinetic parameters) may be equally (or more) relevant in dissecting the kinetics of branched network assembly in cells than kinetic parameters for monomeric VCA."
