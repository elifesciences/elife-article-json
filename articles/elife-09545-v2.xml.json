The ganglioside (glycolipid) GM1 is thought to be the sole CT receptor; however, the mechanism by which CTB binding to GM1 mediates internalization of CT remains enigmatic. Here we report that CTB binds cell surface glycoproteins. Relative contributions of gangliosides and glycoproteins to CTB binding depend on cell type, and CTB binds primarily to glycoproteins in colonic epithelial cell lines. Using a metabolically incorporated photocrosslinking sugar, we identified one CTB-binding glycoprotein and demonstrated that the glycan portion of the molecule, not the protein, provides the CTB interaction motif. We further show that fucosylated structures promote CTB entry into a colonic epithelial cell line and subsequent host cell intoxication. CTB-binding fucosylated glycoproteins are present in normal human intestinal epithelia and could play a role in cholera."

The ganglioside (glycolipid) GM1 is thought to be the sole CT receptor; however, the mechanism by which CTB binding to GM1 mediates internalization of CT remains enigmatic. Here we report that CTB binds cell surface glycoproteins. Relative contributions of gangliosides and glycoproteins to CTB binding depend on cell type, and CTB binds primarily to glycoproteins in colonic epithelial cell lines. Using a metabolically incorporated photocrosslinking sugar, we identified one CTB-binding glycoprotein and demonstrated that the glycan portion of the molecule, not the protein, provides the CTB interaction motif. We further show that fucosylated structures promote CTB entry into a colonic epithelial cell line and subsequent host cell intoxication. CTB-binding fucosylated glycoproteins are present in normal human intestinal epithelia and could play a role in cholera."

The toxin enters intestinal cells, causing them to release water and ions, including sodium and chloride ions.

Cholera toxin (CT) is secreted by <i>V. cholerae</i> and is the direct cause of the profuse, watery diarrhea that characterizes fatal cholera. CT is a heterohexamer comprising one copy of cholera toxin subunit A (CTA) and five copies of subunit B (CTB). Mechanistic studies have yielded the following model for how CT intoxicates host cells\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib61\">S\u00e1nchez and Holmgren, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Lencer, 2003</a>). The CTB subunits of the holotoxin bind receptors on the surface of host enterocytes, enabling endocytosis of CT. CT follows a retrograde trafficking pathway to the ER where it is disassembled to release CTA. CTA enters the cytoplasm and catalyzes ADP-ribosylation of the \u03b1-subunits of heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins (G\u03b1<sub>s</sub>). The resulting extended activation of G\u03b1<sub>s</sub> leads to increased activity of adenylate cyclase, raising intracellular cAMP levels. Elevated cAMP causes activation of chloride channels and chloride efflux, followed by massive secretion of water and ions into the intestinal lumen. Affected individuals can experience rapid and severe dehydration, sometimes leading to death (<a href=\"#bib21\">Foster and Baron, 1996</a>)."

In the 1970s, the ganglioside GM1 was identified as a host cell receptor for CT. A role for gangliosides was first postulated when Van Heyningen <i>et al.</i> discovered that a lipid extract from the brain inhibited CT activity\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib67\">van Heyningen et al., 1971</a>); subsequently, multiple groups showed that purified gangliosides inhibited CT binding, with GM1 the most potent inhibitor (<a href=\"#bib16\">Cuatrecasas, 1973</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Holmgren et al., 1973</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">King and van Heyningen, 1973</a>). To test whether GM1 could function as a receptor, exogenous GM1 was incorporated into host cell membranes, where it was shown to increase sensitivity to toxin,\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib16\">Cuatrecasas, 1973</a>) even sensitizing toxin-resistant cells (<a href=\"#bib46\">Moss et al., 1976</a>). Holmgren and co-workers examined intestinal mucosa from several species and found that the extent of CT binding correlated with GM1 content (<a href=\"#bib27\">Holmgren et al., 1975</a>). Further, addition of exogenous GM1 to intestinal mucosa resulted in increased secretory activity in response to CT stimulation, implying that GM1 serves as a functional receptor. Recognition of GM1 occurs exclusively through the CTB subunit. Indeed, the high affinity CTB-GM1 interaction has been extensively characterized through binding assays (<a href=\"#bib37\">Kuziemko et al., 1996</a>) and x-ray crystallography analysis (<a href=\"#bib43\">Merritt et al., 1994</a>)."

While LTB is known to bind both GM1 and glycoprotein receptors, GM1 is commonly \u00a0described\u00a0to\u00a0be the sole host cell receptor recognized by CTB (<a href=\"#bib21\">Foster and Baron, 1996</a>). However, a variety of experimental approaches have pointed to the possibility that CTB may also recognize glycoproteins present on mammalian cells (<a href=\"#bib45\">Morita et al., 1980</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Monferran et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Balanzino et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Platt et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Hansen et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Blank et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Day et al., 2012</a>).

Moreover, GM1 binding does not always correlate with intoxication. For example, treatment of intestinal mucosa with <i>V. cholerae</i> sialidase yielded more GM1 but had no effect on toxin sensitivity (<a href=\"#bib27\">Holmgren et al., 1975</a>). Also, a point mutant of CTB (H57A) was shown to maintain GM1 binding but the corresponding holotoxin did not intoxicate host cells (<a href=\"#bib2\">Aman et al., 2001</a>). Finally, a recent analysis of a normal human intestinal epithelia found that GM1 comprises only 0.01% of the glycosphingolipid content, raising the question of whether its concentration in enterocytes is sufficient to account for intoxication by CT (<a href=\"#bib11\">Breimer et al., 2012</a>)."

Glycoproteins, not gangliosides, are responsible for the majority of CTB binding to human colonic epithelial cell lines. Using a metabolically incorporated photocrosslinking sugar analog, we isolated and identified one CTB-interacting glycoprotein, CEACAM5. The carbohydrate portion of the glycoprotein, not the amino acids, provides the CTB interaction motif. We show that fucose-containing glycans are recognized by CTB, resulting in internalization, the first step in host cell intoxication. Finally, we report evidence suggesting that fucosylated glycoconjugates recognized by CTB are present in normal human tissue. These results shed new light on mechanisms by which CT can enter and intoxicate host cells. In addition, the demonstration that CTB recognizes molecules other than GM1 has important implications for the interpretation of experiments where CTB is used to study the organization of lipids in the plasma membrane. Overall, these observations reveal a previously unrecognized, and potentially physiologically relevant, molecular mechanism for CT entry into epithelial cells."

Appearance of the high molecular weight bands was dependent on both inclusion of Ac<sub>4</sub>ManNDAz and UV irradiation, suggesting that these bands also represent CTB crosslinked to sialylated molecules, but of much larger molecular weight than GM1. Surprised by the difference we observed between Jurkat and colonic epithelial cell lines, we also examined SiaDAz-mediated CTB crosslinking in two additional cell types, a human brain capillary endothelial cell line (hCMEC/D3) (<a href=\"#bib68\">Weksler, 2005</a>) and a human bronchial epithelial cell line (HBEC)\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib52\">Ramirez, 2004</a>).

To test if <i>N</i>-linked protein glycosylation is required for CTB crosslinking, cells were cultured with either deoxymannojirimycin or kifunensine, small molecules that interfere with the maturation of <i>N</i>-linked glycans (<a href=\"#bib22\">Fuhrmann et al., 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Elbein et al., 1990</a>). Immature <i>N-</i>linked glycans will not contain SiaDAz and will be unable to engage in crosslinking. If the CTB crosslinked complex depends on <i>N-</i>linked protein glycosylation, then culturing cells with these inhibitors should reduce or eliminate the complex. We first confirmed the effectiveness of these inhibitors in T84 cells by observing a reduction in the apparent molecular weight of LAMP1, a protein with multiple sites of <i>N</i>-linked glycosylation (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>).

Both deoxymannojirimycin and kifunensine caused subtle effects on the high molecular weight crosslinked CTB complexes, altering the intensities and increasing the apparent molecular weight (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,C</a>).

Culturing either T84 or Colo205 cells with benzyl-\u03b1-GalNAc resulted in dramatic reductions in the intensity of the high molecular weight crosslinked complexes, suggesting that CTB crosslinks to glycoproteins bearing <i>O</i>-linked glycans (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,C</a>). However, use of benzyl-\u03b1-GalNAc also resulted in the appearance of a new CTB-containing species at lower apparent molecular weight (\u223c100\u2009kDa). Because appearance of the 100\u2009kDa band was not dependent on the addition of Ac<sub>4</sub>ManNDAz, it does not represent crosslinking through SiaDAz, and may relate to the UV absorbance properties of the benzyl group in benzyl-\u03b1-GalNAc. Overall, the results of the inhibition experiments demonstrate that CTB crosslinks to glycoproteins, with both <i>N</i>-linked and <i>O</i>-linked glycans playing roles."

While wild-type Colo205 cells produced the high molecular weight crosslinked CTB complex, the intensity of this band was dramatically reduced in cells lacking C1GALT1C1 activity (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). We conclude that GalNAc-type <i>O</i>-linked glycosylation of proteins plays an important role in formation of high molecular weight crosslinked CTB complexes in Colo205 cells. Taken together, the crosslinking data indicate that CTB crosslinks to glycoproteins in colonic epithelial cells, with both <i>N</i>-linked and <i>O</i>-linked glycosylation of proteins making contributions. In contrast, no evidence pointed to CTB crosslinking to GM1 or other gangliosides in either colonic epithelial cell line."

First we examined Jurkat cells, where we had observed multiple CTB crosslinked species. Jurkat cells were cultured with inhibitors of glycosylation to prevent production of specific classes of glycoconjugates, then CTB binding was measured by flow cytometry (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). The ganglioside biosynthesis inhibitor NB-DGJ reduced GM1 production in Jurkat cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>) and also resulted in a decrease in CTB binding (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). In contrast, culturing Jurkat cells with benzyl-\u03b1-GalNAc or kifunensine had no significant effect on CTB binding (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). The inability of benzyl-\u03b1-GalNAc to affect CTB binding to Jurkat cells is consistent with the known <i>O</i>-linked glycosylation defect in these cells, caused by a frame-shift mutation in the gene encoding chaperone C1GALT1C1 (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib31\">Ju and Cummings, 2002</a>).

In the first approach, binding of biotin-labeled CTB to T84 monolayers was measured by an ELISA method (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). In the second approach, binding of Alexa Fluor 647-labeled CTB to clusters of cells was quantified by fluorescence microscopy (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). In the fluorescence microscopy approach, fluorescence was observed primarily to the outer surface of cell clusters, suggesting that Alexa Fluor 647-labeled CTB has limited access to the interior of the cell clusters, or that the CTB ligand is not displayed on the interior surface. Despite the differences in format, the results obtained by the ELISA and fluorescence microscopy methods were in agreement. NB-DGJ, the inhibitor of ganglioside biosynthesis, had no effect on CTB binding. Kifunensine, an inhibitor of <i>N</i>-linked \u00a0glycan\u00a0maturation, resulted in only small effects on CTB binding. In contrast, culturing cells with benzyl-\u03b1-GalNAc, which blocks elaboration\u00a0of\u00a0<i>O</i>-linked \u00a0glycans, resulted in reductions in CTB binding in both assays.

We tested whether either of these proteins were present in the CTB-glycoprotein crosslinked complex. Cells were cultured with Ac<sub>4</sub>ManNDAz, then incubated with CTB. After UV irradiation, the cells were lysed. Immunoprecipitation of CEACAM5 resulted in purification of the CTB crosslinked complex (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Similarly, immunoprecipitation performed with anti-CD44 resulted in purification of the CTB crosslinked complex (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). We also performed immunoprecipitation with anti-CTB, which resulted in efficient purification of CEACAM5, but only weak purification of CD44 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Notably, anti-CTB immunoprecipitated CEACAM5 even when the Ac<sub>4</sub>ManNDAz crosslinker was omitted, suggesting that the CTB-CEACAM5 interaction is relatively strong (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,D</a>). Furthermore, the material purified by anti-CTB and recognized by anti-CEACAM5 had a slightly higher apparent molecular weight when the crosslinker was included than when it was omitted (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Thus, we observe direct crosslinking between CTB and CEACAM5. Additionally, CD44 co-purifies with the CTB-glycoprotein crosslinked complex, but is not directly crosslinked to CTB."

We cultured cells with inhibitors of glycosylation and assessed the effect on the noncovalent CTB-CEACAM5 interaction (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). Both benzyl-\u03b1-GalNAc and kifunensine treatment caused reductions in the apparent molecular weight of CEACAM5, suggesting that this protein bears both <i>N</i>-linked and <i>O</i>-linked glycans. Treatment with benzyl-\u03b1-GalNAc enhanced the CTB-CEACAM5 interaction, while treatment with kifunensine abrogated the interaction, and treatment with NB-DGJ had no effect. Inhibition of <i>N</i>-linked glycan maturation also blocked crosslinking between CTB and CEACAM5 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>).

Epidemiological studies implicate variation among fucose-containing glycoconjugates in human susceptibility to cholera (<a href=\"#bib6\">Barua and Paguio, 1977</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Swerdlow et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Harris et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Holmner et al., 2010</a>). In addition, some glycan array binding experiments performed by the Consortium for Functional Glycomics (CFG) suggest that fucosylated glycans can be recognized by CTB, albeit with lower avidity than GM1 (<a href=\"#bib13\">Consortium for Functional Glycomics, 2010</a>). Importantly, fucose is not present in GM1, which is recognized by CTB through interactions with its terminal Neu5Ac and galactose residues (<a href=\"#bib43\">Merritt et al., 1994</a>). We therefore tested whether monosaccharides, including fucose, Neu5Ac, and galactose, could competitively inhibit CTB binding to different cell lines. We found that 100 mM Neu5Ac potently blocked CTB binding to Jurkat cells, while 100 mM galactose inhibited slightly (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>). Other monosaccharides had no effect. In particular, 100 mM fucose did not interfere with CTB binding to Jurkat cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>), even though binding of a fucose-recognizing lectin, <i>Aleuria aurantia</i> lectin (AAL), was completely inhibited by the same concentration of free fucose (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). These results are consistent with CTB binding to Jurkat cells via recognition of GM1."

T84 cells were incubated with increasing amounts of biotin-CTB in a buffer containing 200 mM free monosaccharide. Binding of biotin-CTB was measured by an ELISA method (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Fucose and Neu5Ac, but not other sugars, effectively prevented binding of all concentrations of CTB. Further, both fucose and Neu5Ac inhibited biotin-CTB binding to T84 cells in a concentration-dependent manner (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). Free fucose also blocked binding of Alexa Fluor 647-CTB to T84 cells, as measured by fluorescence microscopy (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). The ability of monosaccharides to inhibit binding of biotin-CTB to Colo205 cells was measured by flow cytometry (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>). Fucose was the most effective inhibitor, while galactose and Neu5Ac each showed moderate inhibition (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G</a>). While as little as 10 mM fucose could interfere with biotin-CTB binding to Colo205 cells, glucose did not affect biotin-CTB binding even at concentrations as high as 200 mM (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6H</a>). Similarly, free fucose,\u00a0but\u00a0not\u00a0free\u00a0Neu5Ac\u00a0or\u00a0glucose, blocked binding of fucose-recognizing AAL to Colo205 cells ( <a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6<b>\u2014</b>figure supplement 3</a>) . A theme emerging from the monosaccharide competition experiments was that fucose specifically inhibits CTB binding to colonic epithelial cell lines, but not to Jurkat cells. In addition, Neu5Ac and galactose each displayed some ability to block binding of CTB to multiple cell lines."

T84 cells were incubated with lectin, then variable concentrations of biotin-CTB were added and biotin-CTB binding was measured by ELISA (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). Treatment with <i>Ulex europaeus</i> agglutinin I (UEA-1) or <i>Lotus tetragonolobus</i> lectin (LTL), each of which recognize\u00a0specific fucosylated structures, had no effect on biotin-CTB binding. We also examined AAL and <i>Lens culinaris</i> agglutinin (LCA), which both recognize \u03b11-6-fucosylated structures, although AAL has a broader substrate scope and also binds fucose in other linkages (<a href=\"#bib35\">Kochibe and Furukawa, 1980</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Matsumura et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Yu et al., 2012</a>). AAL was able to block biotin-CTB binding, but LCA was not. We titrated the amount of lectins used in this blocking assay, while holding the biotin-CTB concentration constant (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). AAL, but not other lectins, blocked biotin-CTB binding to T84 cells in a concentration-dependent way. We used flow cytometry to test the ability of lectins to block CTB binding to Colo205 cells. Colo205 cells were first incubated with lectin, then CTB was added. Similar to what we observed for T84 cells, AAL effectively blocked CTB binding, while other lectins had no effect (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>). AAL blocked CTB binding to Colo205 cells in a concentration-dependent way (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>), and when free fucose was included during the AAL pre-incubation, AAL was no longer able to block CTB binding (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>). While AAL effectively blocked CTB binding to both T84 and Colo205 cells, this fucose-recognizing lectin was not able to block biotin-CTB binding to Jurkat T cells, even when used in excess over toxin concentration (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>). Taken together, results from lectin blocking experiments are consistent with the idea that CTB binds fucosylated structures on the surface of colonic epithelial cell lines, while fucosylated structures do not contribute significantly to CTB binding to Jurkat cells. In contrast, neither MAL-II, which recognizes \u03b12-3-linked sialic acid, nor <i>Sambucus nigra</i> lectin (SNA), which recognizes \u03b12-6-linked sialic acid, affected biotin-CTB binding to colonic epithelial cell lines (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A\u2013C</a>)."

As the 2F-Fuc concentration increased, reduced amounts of the CTB-glycoprotein crosslinked complex were observed (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A,B</a>), indicating that fucosylation is required for SiaDAz-dependent CTB crosslinking to glycoproteins. Next, we assessed whether fucosylation was required for the direct interaction between CTB and CEACAM5. T84 cells were cultured with Ac<sub>4</sub>ManNDAz and 2F-Fuc, then crosslinking to CTB was performed. CEACAM5 was isolated by immunoprecipitation and probed with anti-CTB to assess CTB-CEACAM5 crosslinking (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>). Less crosslinked CTB-CEACAM5 was observed when fucosylation was inhibited. One possible explanation for this result is that the CEACAM5-CTB interaction is mediated by a fucosylated glycan. Additionally, the decreased crosslinking may reflect reduced overall binding of CTB to the cell surface when fucosylation is inhibited."

First, we confirmed the effectiveness of 2F-Fuc to reduce cell surface fucose in\u00a0T84\u00a0cells\u00a0by showing that it caused a reduction in binding of UEA-1 (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Then, T84 cells were cultured with or without inhibitory concentrations of 2F-Fuc, followed by incubation with increasing concentrations of biotin-CTB. The amount of biotin-CTB bound to the cell surface was measured by an ELISA method (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a>). Inhibition of fucosylation reduced the plateau value for biotin-CTB binding to T84 cells. We also used fluorescence microscopy to measure binding of Alexa Fluor 647-labeled CTB to T84 cells cultured with or without 2F-Fuc. Cells cultured with the fucosylation inhibitor displayed a reduction in Alexa Fluor 647-CTB binding (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E</a> and <a href=\"#fig8s2\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Similarly, Colo205 cells were cultured with 2F-Fuc and CTB binding was measured by flow cytometry (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8F</a>). Inhibition of fucosylation reduced CTB binding to Colo205 cells, too. In contrast, Colo205 cells cultured with a sialylation inhibitor, 3F-NeuAc,\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib53\">Rillahan et al., 2012</a>) displayed enhanced binding to CTB, consistent with a small increase in binding of a fucose-recognizing lectin that also occurs with inhibition of sialylation (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8F</a> and <a href=\"#fig8s3\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). We conclude that recognition of fucosylated structures is an important and general mechanism for CTB binding to colonic epithelial cells. The data regarding sialylation are less clear-cut and additional experiments will be required to determine whether sialic acids are components of the glycan motifs that CTB recognizes on colonic epithelial cells."

We used an in-cell ELISA method to measure the effects of inhibitors of glycosylation on the uptake of biotin-CTB by T84 cells. Cells were first cultured with glycosylation inhibitors, as described above. To quantify internalized biotin-CTB, cells were incubated in the presence of biotin-CTB at 37\u00b0C for the indicated times, then unbound biotin-CTB was washed away and the cells were rapidly cooled to 4\u00b0C to arrest internalization. Remaining surface-bound biotin-CTB was blocked with avidin, and also removed by acid washing. After permeabilizing cells, internalized biotin-CTB was measured by ELISA (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>). Total surface bound biotin-CTB was simultaneously assessed by maintaining control cells at 4\u00b0C (no endocytosis) (<a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) and yielded values consistent with other measurements (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4B,C</a>, <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D,E</a>). The amount of biotin-CTB internalized by cells treated with NB-DGJ was indistinguishable from that observed for control cells (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>), suggesting that gangliosides do not mediate the majority of biotin-CTB internalization. Kifunensine caused a slight enhancement in internalization, suggesting that <i>N</i>-linked glycosylation of proteins might serve as an impediment to CTB internalization. Culturing cells with either benzyl-\u03b1-GalNAc or 2F-Fuc each nearly abolished internalization, implying that fucosylated and/or <i>O</i>-linked glycoproteins may play functional roles in biotin-CTB internalization."

T84 cells were cultured in monolayers in the presence of glycosylation inhibitors. First, we evaluated whether inhibitors of glycosylation caused off-target effects on adenylate cyclase activity. Indeed, both benzyl-\u03b1-GalNAc and kifunensine caused reductions in the amount of cAMP that accumulated in response to stimulation with forskolin (<a href=\"#fig9s2\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>), and with vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP; <a href=\"#fig9s2\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>), and similarly reduced cAMP accumulation in response to CT (<a href=\"#fig9s2\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>). While the effects of benzyl-\u03b1-GalNAc and kifunensine on adenylate cyclase activity make it difficult to interpret how these inhibitors modulate CT intoxication, interpreting the effects of NB-DGJ and 2F-Fuc is more straightforward since neither affected cAMP accumulation in response to forskolin or VIP (<a href=\"#fig9s2\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 2A,B</a>)."

Thus, host cell fucosylation is important for intoxication by CT. Since 2F-Fuc treatment also causes reduced CTB binding and cell entry, the most likely explanation for this result is that reduced fucosylation leads to less CT entering cells, and thereby reduces host cell intoxication. In contrast, NB-DGJ does not dramatically affect CTB binding or internalization, so the explanation for this result is less clear. One possibility is that there is a small amount of GM1 in the cells, which is capable of mediating host cell intoxication via pathway that operates in parallel to the fucosylated glycoproteins. A second possibility is that GM1 is not required for the initial steps of CT binding and internalization, but is required for later steps in intoxication. A final possibility is that GM1 is not essential, but other glucosylceramide glycolipids, which are also reduced due to NB-DGJ treatment, play roles in the trafficking and intoxication process. Notably, CT intoxication appeared to be sensitive to brefeldin A in both untreated cells and in cells that were cultured with NB-DGJ (<a href=\"#fig9s3\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), implying that in both cases, CT intoxication of host cells occurs via retrograde transport through the secretory pathway, consistent with other studies (<a href=\"#bib38\">Lencer, 2003</a>)."

The experiments reported here were performed in T84 and Colo205 cell lines, both colorectal cancer cell lines. While T84 cells are widely used as a model for host cell intoxication by CT, we wondered whether fucosylation and protein glycosylation might also function in CTB binding to normal colonic epithelial cells. To investigate, we used a human colonic epithelial cell line (HCEC) derived from normal human colon cells and immortalized by expression of Cdk4 and hTERT (<a href=\"#bib54\">Roig et al., 2010</a>). HCEC cells were cultured with inhibitors of glycosylation (NB-DGJ, kifunensine, benzyl-\u03b1-GalNAc, or 2F-Fuc), then CTB binding was measured by an in-cell ELISA method (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10A</a>). CTB binding to HCECs was low overall and unaffected by culturing the cells with either kifunensine or NB-DGJ. Culturing HCECs with benzyl-\u03b1-GalNAc resulted in an increase in CTB binding, while culturing HCECs with 2F-Fuc resulted in a decrease in CTB binding. These results suggest that GM1 is not an important determinant for CTB binding to HCECs, and point to a contribution from fucosylated structures, potentially displayed on glycoproteins."

In contrast, in the Jurkat T cell line, GM1 is the main CTB binding ligand. Further, the results presented here implicate glycoproteins as functional receptors that can mediate toxin internalization. Our findings are in conflict with dogma,\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib21\">Foster and Baron, 1996</a>) but not inconsistent with previous results. The earliest studies identifying GM1 as the CT receptor were based on inhibition assays and gain-of-function experiments. Indeed, CTB binds GM1 with high affinity,\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib37\">Kuziemko et al., 1996</a>) so it is not surprising that GM1 is an effective inhibitor of CTB binding and that adding GM1 to cells leads to enhanced CTB binding. However, experimentally addressing how loss of GM1 affects CTB binding and host cell intoxication has been more difficult. Use of selective inhibitors of glycosphingolipid biosynthesis allowed two groups to observe that a portion of CTB binding is GM1-independent (<a href=\"#bib51\">Platt et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Blank et al., 2007</a>). Our data extend this observation, showing that CTB binding is mostly GM1-independent in cell types more closely related to the physiological site of CT action. Further, we report evidence that CTB binds directly to glycoproteins, relying on glycan recognition motifs. Our observation that inhibition of ganglioside biosynthesis does not affect CTB binding to colonic epithelial cell lines is consistent with the low level of GM1 in these cells. Similarly, the normal human intestinal epithelia contains very little GM1,\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib11\">Breimer et al., 2012</a>) suggesting that glycoproteins could be important contributors to CTB binding during <i>Vibrio cholerae</i> infection."

CT has been shown to enter cells through both clathrin- and caveolin-dependent mechanisms, as well a clathrin- and caveolin-independent mechanism (<a href=\"#bib47\">Orlandi, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Torgersen et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Massol, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Howes et al., 2010</a>). Studies to identify the dominant endocytic mechanism have yielded variable results, raising the possibility that CT uses different endocytic mechanisms to enter different cell lines. The existence of multiple glycoprotein receptors provides a plausible explanation for the use of multiple endocytic pathways and for cell type differences. The exact structure of the glycan might also play a functional role in the endocytic mechanism, as modification of proteins with a GM1 ganglioside is sufficient to engender CT binding, but not host cell intoxication (<a href=\"#bib49\">Pacuszka and Fishman, 1990</a>). In addition, a long-standing conundrum about CT internalization is how binding to GM1 located in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane can trigger endocytosis. Our results show that CTB can bind glycoproteins, offering a possible mechanism for receptor-mediated endocytosis."

Our detection of CEACAM5 in T84 cells likely reflects the increased CEACAM5 expression and altered CEACAM5 glycosylation often found in colorectal cancer (<a href=\"#bib55\">Saeland et al., 2012</a>). In addition, while <i>N</i>-linked glycosylation is critical for the CTB-CEACAM5 interaction, the majority of CTB binding to T84 cells depends on <i>O</i>-linked glycosylation of proteins. Another protein previously reported to interact with CTB in pig enterocytes is sucrase-isomaltase (SI)\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib24\">Hansen et al., 2005</a>); however, we did not detect any peptides corresponding to SI in our proteomics analysis of the CTB crosslinked complex. Intriguingly, though, SI is subject to GalNAc-type <i>O</i>-linked glycosylation, which controls its association with detergent-insoluble membrane microdomains (<a href=\"#bib1\">Alfalah et al., 1999</a>). We speculate that certain GalNAc-type <i>O</i>-linked glycans may serve as determinants for both CTB recognition and membrane microdomain targeting, potentially\u00a0explaining why CTB binding fractionates with detergent-insoluble material, an observation that is typically interpreted to result from the binding of CTB to GM1."

Indeed, differences in observed diffusion rates for bound CTB may reflect the identity of the CTB ligand, rather than the fluidity of the membrane in which it resides. Day and Kenworthy noticed that CTB bound to COS-7 cells diffused surprisingly slowly for a lipid-bound protein and speculated that an interaction with a protein might slow its diffusion (<a href=\"#bib18\">Day et al., 2012</a>). Our results predict that CTB diffusion rates will differ in different cell types, with rapid diffusion in GM1-rich cell lines, like Jurkat cells, and slower diffusion in GM1-deficient cell lines, such as T84 and Colo205 cells."

The tissue was cut into 5 mm pieces and epithelial cells released by two cycles of treatment with 1 mM EDTA and 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) in HEPES-buffered Hank\u2019s balanced salt solution containing 2% of fetal calf serum at 37\u00b0C for 15\u2009min with slow stirring (<a href=\"#bib40\">Lundgren et al., 2005</a>). Released epithelial cells were collected by filtration, and pooled with epithelial cell fractions from two subsequent EDTA/DTT cycles for use in analysis of CTB binding by flow cytometry. The cells were first stained with Live/Dead aqua (L34957, Invitrogen). After washing, the cells were blocked with various concentrations of AAL-biotin (B-1395, Vector Labs) or kept in buffer prior to addition of antibodies. The antibodies used were anti-CD45 - APC-H7 (clone 2D1, BD), anti-EpCAM - Alexa Flur 488 (clone 9C4, BioLegend,\u00a0San\u00a0Diego,\u00a0CA), and the protein CTB - Alexa Fluor 647 (C34778, Invitrogen). Some samples were stained in the presence of l-fucose (F2252, Sigma-Aldrich), d-galactose (G0750, Sigma-Aldrich), or d-glucose (G8270, Sigma-Aldrich). The staining cocktail was then preincubated for 5\u2009min before addition to the cells. After staining, the cells were washed and analyzed on a flow cytometer (LSR-II, BD) and the results were analyzed using the FlowJo software."

GM1 is indeed the highest affinity glycan ligand of CT, and is known to support CTA entry into host cells in model systems. But the apparent lack of this ligand on gut epithelial cells has raised the possibility that other weaker avidity ligands mediate CT entry and intoxication. Here, using a method involving metabolic labeling of cells to contain UV reactive sialic acids that crosslink glycan ligands to CT, the authors present compelling evidence that glycoproteins can bind CTB on the surface of the intestinal epithelial cell lines and mediate toxin uptake by endocytosis. There is, however, incomplete evidence that the glycoprotein receptors can mediate intoxication. Clear evidence is presented for fucosylated ligands to mediate CTB binding, and depending on the intestinal cell line O-linked glycans (T84) or both O-linked and N-linked glycans (Colo205) can carry ligands for CT."

With respect to the crosslinking data, one possible interpretation is that sialic acid is not required, but can fortuitously capture some interactions through proximity to the preferred fucosylated ligand. Thus, additional experiments are required to assess the role of sialylation. As suggested, we used the sialyltransferase inhibitor 3F-NeuAc to assess whether sialylation is required for CTB binding to Colo205 cells. (Note that we cannot use 3F-NeuAc in crosslinking experiments because it would be expected to block SiaDAz incorporation.) We observed that inhibition of sialylation resulted in slightly <i>increased</i> binding to CTB, consistent with a slight increase in binding of a fucose-recognizing lectin that also occurs with inhibition of sialylation (new data shown in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8F</a> and <a href=\"#fig8s2\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>). We also attempted to use 3F-NeuAc to assess the role of sialylation in CTB binding to T84 cells, but did not observe inhibition of sialylation at the 3F-NeuAc concentrations tested. Finally, we tested whether free Neu5Ac could inhibit binding to colonic epithelial cell lines. We found that Neu5Ac strongly inhibited CTB binding to T84 cells (new data in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C,D</a>), but only slightly inhibited CTB binding to Colo205 cells (new data in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F,G</a>). Based on these data and the lectin data shown in the previous submission (now shown in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A\u2013C</a>), we cannot make a definitive conclusion regarding a role for sialic acid in CTB binding to colonic epithelial cell lines. Since the role of sialylation is not central to the main conclusions of the current manuscript, we chose to curtail these experiments and moderated our language in the manuscript regarding the role of sialylation in binding of CTB to glycoproteins in these cell lines.

First, to be clear, the binding assays reported in the earlier figures (formerly <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a> and <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>; now <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> and <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a> in the revised manuscript) were performed at 4\u00b0C, conditions that did not allow CTB internalization. The problem we identified was in the data initially reported as Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1, showing the total binding of CTB to T84 cells, as measured by ELISA. The incubation times used for this experiment resulted in strong OPD signals that fell outside the linear range of detection. These skewed values diminished the differences in CTB binding for the different glycosylation inhibitors. Further, these values for total CTB binding were also used, together with measurements of internalized CTB, to calculate internalization efficiencies, shown in the previous version of <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>. Thus, the internalization efficiency plots were also inaccurate. In the revision, we have modified the experimental protocol to avoid saturating OPD signals, so that we accurately measure total CTB binding in this experiment. These results are shown in <a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and are now consistent with the results shown in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> and <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>. We now report the amount of internalized CTB in the main <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>. Notably, little to no CTB was internalized when either fucosylation or O-linked glycosylation was inhibited. In answer to the reviewers\u2019 question, any CTB that is internalized when cells are cultured with 2F-Fuc could reflect CTB molecules that are not bound to fucosylated proteins, or possibly CTB bound to a small amount of fucosylated proteins that might remain present even with 2F-Fuc inhibition. Finally, in the revised manuscript, we chose not to show calculated internalization efficiencies (internalized CTB divided by total CTB bound), out of concern that the low amount of total CTB bound under some conditions could comprise the accuracy of these calculations. Based on these results, the main conclusions for internalization experiments are that inhibition of fucosylation and of O-linked glycosylation each result in a dramatic reduction in the amount of CTB that enters cells, and that NB-DGJ treatment does not substantially affect CTB internalization. The text has been modified to more clearly state these conclusions.<i>5) The evidence against the presence of GM1 in intestinal cell membranes is weak. This is an important point for the paper's central thesis as it underlies the interpretation of the functional studies for the glycoprotein receptors for CTB. Several studies show GM1 in intestinal cells (Critchley et al. 1981, J Biol Chem, 256: 8724-8731 as example), so the lack of detection in this paper is unexpected. The result might be explained by the low level of GM1 in intestinal cells coupled with the relatively insensitive approach used in this paper to detect the gangliosides (resorcinol stain). The authors should re-examine these studies by making use of \"far-western\" toxin blots of TLC plates as described (Magnani et al. 1980, Anal Biochem 109:399-402 and Critchley et al. 1981, J Biol Chem 256: 8724-8731 as examples).</i>"

Almost all toxins and viruses that use the ER to enter host cells bind glycosphingolipids.

However, we recognize that the mechanism of host cell intoxication by CT includes multiple steps. The data we report in the manuscript demonstrate (1) that fucosylated glycoproteins mediate a large fraction of CTB binding to T84 and Colo205 cells, (2) that fucosylated glycoproteins play an important role in the mechanism by which CTB enters T84 cells, and (3) that entry of CT into T84 cells via a fucose-dependent mechanism is on-pathway to host cell intoxication. However, these data do not exclude the possibility that CT might also enter cells via additional mechanisms, a point that we attempted to make more clearly in the revised manuscript. Further, once CT enters cells, we do not know whether it remains bound to fucosylated glycoproteins. CT might be handed off to other molecules for further trafficking steps. Indeed, GM1 could play role in these later trafficking steps, consistent with our observation that NB-DGJ treatment does not affect CTB entry, but does reduce host cell intoxication. In addition, others have reported that the C-terminal KDEL on CTA can enhance the efficiency of host cell intoxication through interactions with the KDEL receptor that mediate retrograde trafficking (for example, see J. Cell Biol. 131: 951-962), providing a potential mechanism for CT to traffic to the ER. We revised the manuscript to make clear that the data reported in this manuscript do not report directly on the trafficking steps that occur after CT enters the host cell, and to point out that CT might exploit multiple parallel pathways for host cell intoxication. We plan to explore whether fucosylated glycoproteins remain associated with CT throughout later trafficking steps, but feel that these studies are beyond the scope of the current manuscript.<i>7) The evidence that glycoproteins are acting as functional trafficking receptors leading to toxicity for cholera toxin is also weak. It is based entirely on use of the chemical inhibitors of glycan synthesis which undoubtedly have off-target effects. And the experiment that tests the idea lacks controls for off-target inhibition of adenylyl cyclase or its coupling to Gs (a frequent event with chemical inhibitors). These studies need to be reproduced using the Gs agonist vasointestinal peptide (VIP) and forskolin to measure maximal adenylyl cyclase activity under each condition \u2013 and compared directly with the toxin-induced signals (or calculated as a ratio).</i>"

As proposed, we tested whether the inhibitors of glycosylation affected activation of adenylyl cyclase activity by VIP and forskolin. Both kifunensine and benzyl-\u03b1-GalNAc caused reduced activation of adenylyl cyclase activity by both VIP and forskolin (new data in <a href=\"#fig9s2\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Thus, we feel that we cannot interpret the effects of kifunensine and benzyl-\u03b1-GalNAc on cholera toxin-induced cAMP production and we have moved these results to <a href=\"#fig9s2\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 2</a>. In contrast, neither NB-DGJ nor 2F-Fuc affected activation of adenylyl cyclase activity by either VIP or forskolin, but both of these inhibitors do cause reduced CT-induced cAMP production, with 2F-Fuc causing a more dramatic effect (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>). Since 2F-Fuc treatment also causes reduced CTB binding and cell entry, the most likely explanation for this result is that reduced fucosylation leads to less CT entering cells, and thereby reduces host cell intoxication. Since NB-DGJ treatment does not grossly affect CTB binding or internalization, we think it is reasonable to consider three possible explanations for the effect that NB-DGJ exerts on CT-induced cAMP production. One possibility is that the cells contain a level of GM1 that is not detectable by the sensitive methods employed in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, but which is nonetheless capable of mediating host cell intoxication via a pathway that operates either in parallel or in concert with that mediated by fucosylated glycoproteins. A second possibility is that GM1 is not required for the initial steps of CT binding and internalization, but is required for later steps in intoxication (i.e. the potential hand-off mechanism discussed in our response to item #6 above). A final possibility is that GM1 is not essential, but other glucosylceramide glycolipids, which are also reduced due to NB-DGJ treatment, play roles in the trafficking and intoxication process. We now enumerate these possibilities explicitly in the manuscript. In summary, with the addition of these control experiments, the data now clearly demonstrate a role for fucosylation in the mechanism of host cell intoxication by CT."

Similarly, in cells that were cultured with NB-DGJ and treated with brefeldin A, the amount of CT-induced cAMP production is equivalent to the background level observed with no CT treatment. Since the magnitude of CT-induced cAMP production in the NB-DGJ-treated cells is small, the difference attributable to brefeldin A has a p value of 0.06. Despite the borderline significance of the p value, the data are most consistent with the residual CT intoxication in NB-DGJ-treated cells occurring through mechanism that depends on the secretory pathway."
