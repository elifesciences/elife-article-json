This continuous model is based upon <i>in vitro</i> reconstitution and <i>in vivo</i> ensemble experiments. Here, we characterize the replisome-complex stoichiometry and dynamics with single-molecule resolution in bacterial cells. Strikingly, the stoichiometries of the replicative helicase, DNA polymerase, and clamp loader complexes are consistent with the presence of only one active replisome in a significant fraction of cells (&gt;40%). Furthermore, many of the observed complexes have short lifetimes (&lt;8 minutes), suggesting that replisome disassembly is quite prevalent, possibly occurring several times per cell cycle. The instability of the replisome complex is conflict-induced: transcription inhibition stabilizes these complexes, restoring the second replisome in many of the cells. Our results suggest that, in contrast to the canonical model, DNA replication is a largely discontinuous process <i>in vivo</i> due to pervasive replication-transcription conflicts."
