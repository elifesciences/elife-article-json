The different subdivisions of the midbrain periaqueductal gray (PAG) are intricately (and differentially) involved in integrating behavioural responses to threat in animals, while the PAG has previously only been considered as a single entity in human research. Here we investigate how these individual PAG columns are differently involved with respiratory threat. Eighteen healthy subjects were conditioned to associate shapes with certain or uncertain impending respiratory load, and scanned the following day during anticipation and application of inspiratory loading using 7 T functional MRI. We showed activity in the ventrolateral PAG (vlPAG) during anticipation of resistive loading, with activity in the lateral PAG (lPAG) during resistive loading, revealing spatially and temporally distinct functions within this structure. We propose that lPAG is involved with sensorimotor responses to breathlessness, while the vlPAG operates within the threat perception network for impending breathlessness."

The different subdivisions of the midbrain periaqueductal gray (PAG) are intricately (and differentially) involved in integrating behavioural responses to threat in animals, while the PAG has previously only been considered as a single entity in human research. Here we investigate how these individual PAG columns are differently involved with respiratory threat. Eighteen healthy subjects were conditioned to associate shapes with certain or uncertain impending respiratory load, and scanned the following day during anticipation and application of inspiratory loading using 7 T functional MRI. We showed activity in the ventrolateral PAG (vlPAG) during anticipation of resistive loading, with activity in the lateral PAG (lPAG) during resistive loading, revealing spatially and temporally distinct functions within this structure. We propose that lPAG is involved with sensorimotor responses to breathlessness, while the vlPAG operates within the threat perception network for impending breathlessness."

A potentially pivotal nucleus within the breathlessness perception pathway is the midbrain periaqueductal gray (PAG). The PAG has been implicated in many basic survival behaviours including cardiovascular, motor and pain responses (<a href=\"#bib14\">De Oca et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Mobbs et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Pereira et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Tracey et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Benarroch, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Paterson, 2014</a>), and is well situated to play a role in the integrative response to breathlessness, with major cortical inputs from areas involved with emotional regulation such as medial prefrontal, insula, anterior cingulate cortices and amygdala (<a href=\"#bib6\">Beitz, 1982</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Gabbott et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Rizvi et al., 1991</a>), and descending connections to the respiratory nuclei of the medulla (<a href=\"#bib35\">Huang et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Sessle et al., 1981</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Hayward, 2004</a>). These medullary nuclei projections include those to the ventrolateral medulla for the switch between inspiration and expiration (<a href=\"#bib61\">Subramanian et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Subramanian, 2013</a>), and the nucleus retroambiguus for pharyngeal, laryngeal, thoracic and abdominal pressure control (<a href=\"#bib34\">Holstege, 1989</a>)."

These columns are proposed to act within active coping strategies for escapable threat (lPAG and dlPAG) associated with fight and flight responses, or passive coping strategies to inescapable threat (vlPAG) often associated with freezing behaviours (<a href=\"#bib38\">Keay and Bandler, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bandler and Shipley, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Bandler et al., 2000</a>).

Therefore, a better understanding of its neural basis has the potential to lead to new treatments with wide ranging impact (<a href=\"#bib33\">Herigstad et al., 2011</a>). Importantly, conditioned anticipation of environmental cues associated with breathlessness is integral to its threat detection and designated response. Anticipation of threatening sensations relies on cues from the environment. Conditioning is a process of learning an association between two unrelated stimuli, such that a previously neutral stimulus (conditioned stimulus, CS) may evoke anxiety due to learned associations with an aversive stimulus (unconditioned stimulus, US) (<a href=\"#bib49\">Pavlov et al., 2003</a>). Descending modulatory systems during anticipation of a stimulus have even been shown to modulate the response to the stimulus itself, such as those demonstrated with pain (<a href=\"#bib52\">Porro et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Price et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Wager et al., 2004</a>). Therefore, each individual PAG column may play differential and important roles in both the anticipation and response to a threatening respiratory stimulus, and thus are\u00a0potentially pivotal in our understanding and treatment of the neural basis of breathlessness. Interestingly, PAG activity has been identified in a recent paper investigating brain responses to breathlessness-related word cues in patients with COPD, although without sufficient resolution to differentiate activity within specific columns (<a href=\"#bib32\">Herigstad et al., 2015</a>)."

However, despite the proposed integral role of the PAG in threat perception, the ability to scrutinise contributions of smaller nuclei is often limited in neuroimaging by resolution and statistical power, and thus key structures such as the PAG have not yet been investigated in humans."

To investigate if uncertainty of an aversive breathing stimulus altered the threat response (<a href=\"#bib54\">Rhudy and Meagher, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Ploghaus et al., 2003</a>), we used three separate anticipation cues with a CS-US contingency pairing of 100%, 50% and 0%. In accordance with animal models, we hypothesised that the vlPAG would be active during anticipation of resistance, as threat is detected and passive coping strategies are employed to manage an upcoming inescapable stressor. Conversely, we hypothesised activity in the lPAG during inspiratory resistance with slowed, deep breathing, corresponding with results in animals (<a href=\"#bib34\">Holstege, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Keay and Bandler, 2001</a>) and our previous work in breath holds (<a href=\"#bib19\">Faull et al., 2015</a>)."

We observed bilateral decreased BOLD activity in the lPAG during resistive inspiratory loading, and during cued anticipation activity in this area correlated with behavioural ratings of breathlessness intensity. Conversely, positive BOLD activity in the right vlPAG was identified during the cued anticipation of certain impending resistance, while uncertain anticipation activity remained subthreshold. Anxiety ratings, intensity scores and the ventilatory response were lower in the uncertain vs. certain condition, indicating a reduction in the conditioned threat response to a 50% (uncertain) predictive cue, compared to the 100% (certain) predictive cue."

During response to threat, functional organisation of these animal PAG columns has been hypothesised to consist of active and passive coping strategies (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bandler et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Hayen et al., 2013a</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Herigstad et al., 2011</a>). The lPAG and dlPAG are thought to employ active coping strategies for escapable stressors, consistent with the tachypnea observed in animals on stimulation of these columns (<a href=\"#bib34\">Holstege, 1989</a>), while the vlPAG employs passive coping strategies for inescapable stressors (vlPAG) such as that seen with a range of physical stimuli (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bandler et al., 2000</a>). In the current investigation of the threat response to breathlessness, the aversive resisted breathing stimulus was an upcoming inescapable stressor, activating the vlPAG, while during the active stimulus response we observed lPAG activity. These results are the first in humans to adhere to the current models of distinctive threat perception of the animal PAG columns, although the cytoarchitecture and autonomic functions produced within the rostro-caudal axes of these columns is in humans not yet known. One recent study by Satpute and colleagues used 7 Ttesla functional MRI to identify highly localised activity in areas of the PAG along the rostro-caudal axis during exposure to aversive images in humans\u00a0[<a href=\"#bib57\">Satpute et al., 2013</a>] however this study was based upon pre-defined divisions within the PAG that neither adhered to its known columnar structure, nor considered the characteristic functions of these columns within threat perception. Therefore, while there is much work to be done to accurately map the cytoarchitecture and functional localisation of autonomic functions within the human PAG columns, we will now discuss each of the activated columns in the current study, as a starting point towards understanding their potential role in the specific threat response to an aversive breathing stimulus as a model of breathlessness."

Prior work by our group identified decreased BOLD signal in the human lPAG during the respiratory challenge of breath holds (<a href=\"#bib19\">Faull et al., 2015</a>), and animal studies have proposed the lPAG may play a role in respiratory behaviours such as prolonged inspirations and expirations (<a href=\"#bib34\">Holstege, 1989</a>). Thus, it is possible that the lPAG is an integral nucleus within the somatomotor pathways of respiratory control in the active response to threat, and anatomical evidence exists to support this hypothesis (<a href=\"#bib18\">Ezra et al., 2015</a>). The lPAG has been reported to receive somatotopically organised spinal sensory afferents (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bandler et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Craven, 2011</a>), which could provide sensory information from the chest, and it propagates direct efferent connections to the midline medulla (<a href=\"#bib11\">Cowie and Holstege, 1992</a>) for possible descending respiratory motor commands. Diffusion tractography in humans demonstrates preferential connectivity between somatomotor regions, such as between primary sensory and motor cortices and the lPAG, compared to the vlPAG (<a href=\"#bib18\">Ezra et al., 2015</a>). Our findings of activity in the lPAG whilst producing elevated inspiratory pressure supports the idea that this column of the PAG is involved in altered respiratory work, although whether this is in a motor or sensory capacity (or both) is currently unknown."

Anticipation of a stimulus allows system preparation and response selection, and activity in the lPAG that scales with the perceived intensity of the forthcoming stimulus indicates a possible top-down control during preparation for the threat of inspiratory resistance. The cortical structures that scaled alongside the lPAG with perceived intensity included the premotor cortex and hippocampus, which may indicate increased motor preparatory activity (<a href=\"#bib23\">Grafton et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Rizzolatti et al., 2002</a>) and greater working memory of the stimulus between the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (<a href=\"#bib41\">Laroche et al., 2000</a>). Conversely, lPAG activity during anticipation did not correlate with anxiety scores. This suggests that lPAG activity is less likely to be involved in the emotional component of resistance anticipation\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib13\">Critchley et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Gray et al., 2007</a>). Future work towards understanding whether the role of the lPAG is causative within this anticipatory breathlessness intensity network may be integral to pinpointing perceptual disruptions in chronic sufferers of breathlessness."

Anticipation of resistance also activated a cortical network of motor, sensory and interoceptive areas, indicating the potential position of the vlPAG within a threat detection and passive preparatory network stimulated by a conditioned breathlessness cue. Additionally, although prefrontal cortical areas were not imaged, diffusion tractography has demonstrated that the vlPAG receives the predominant proportion of the input from the prefrontal cortex (<a href=\"#bib18\">Ezra et al., 2015</a>), and animal models report direct connections between the posterior orbital frontal and anterior insula cortices to the vlPAG (<a href=\"#bib2\">An et al., 1998</a>). Therefore, it is possible that communication between the vlPAG and areas of executive function, interoception and motor preparation are vital to the threat detection and response selection that occur during the cued anticipation of breathlessness, which will be investigated in future work. While this study has made inroads into functionally differentiating the columns of the PAG at high resolution, further research into the intricacies of these communications is needed to fully understand the role of the vlPAG within this network."

Furthermore, the reduction in vlPAG activity was paralleled by reduced anxiety and intensity scores in uncertain anticipation, indicating a smaller conditioned response to this cue. This supports the idea that the vlPAG is involved within the threat perception network for breathlessness, and the magnitude of this activity reflects greater conditioning and increased anticipatory preparation. Interestingly, it does not appear that the uncertainty induced in this study drives hypersensitivity and resultant increased anxiety or rating scores (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>), differing from previous research in pain (<a href=\"#bib54\">Rhudy and Meagher, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Ploghaus et al., 2003</a>). However, previous pain research has often used no anticipation cue in conjunction with an unpredictably intense stimulus, while in this study we used an uncertain prediction of a known stimulus. The current methodology allowed us to manipulate the conditioned response to a cue, permitting investigation into the role of the PAG during reduced perception of threat without changing the intensity of the stimulus."

Within the limited field of view of this study, the cortical network associated with breathing against an inspiratory load covered a network of primary motor and sensory structures, and the subcortical basal ganglia and insula (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>) as well as the lPAG, consistent with previous research using breath holds (<a href=\"#bib19\">Faull et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">McKay et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Pattinson et al., 2009</a>)\u00a0and hypercapnia-stimulated hyperventilation using PET (<a href=\"#bib8\">Brannan et al., 2001</a>). Conversely, during anticipation, vlPAG activity was paired with less extensive activation of cortical primary motor and sensory structures compared with inspiratory loading, while activity was maintained in preparatory motor structures such as the supplementary motor cortex and basal ganglia (<a href=\"#bib26\">Groenewegen, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Mink, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Alexander et al., 1986</a>). While further research is required to investigate the role of prefrontal brain activity that will be simultaneously occurring within this respiratory threat network during anticipation and inspiratory loading, what will be of great interest is how these distinctly different PAG columnar activations are functionally interacting within this extensive cortical network to influence the perception of respiratory threat during these two conditions."

However, this contrast is not feasible beyond targeted PAG column analysis in the current study, as the length of the inspiratory resistance stimulus required to amass statistical power limits the number of possible repeats of each condition. Therefore, beyond the targeted analysis of the vlPAG during certain anticipation of resistance greater than anticipation of no resistance, the anticipation conditions have been analysed against baseline. However, the inclusion of three anticipatory cue conditions does allow greater decorrelation of the general \u2018cue response\u2019 to each anticipation condition in the model. Further studies in this area may look to include more subjects, or fewer anticipation conditions to allow more repeats, enabling contrasts of anticipation of loading against anticipation of no loading in the whole PAG and wider cortex."

This study corroborates with recent findings that the lPAG may be involved with the sensorimotor aspect of breathing control during the active response to breathlessness, and top-down anticipatory activity may influence intensity perception of breathlessness. Conversely, the vlPAG appears to be only activated during anticipation of breathlessness, consistent with freezing behaviours reported in animals, with decreased anticipatory cue conditioning resulting in reduced vlPAG activity. We propose that the vlPAG is involved with the learned anticipatory threat detection of a breathlessness stimulus, corroborating with the proposed model of the vlPAG in the passive threat response to an inescapable stressor. In this study we have discriminated differential functional activity within the columns of the PAG in response to threat for the first time in humans, demonstrating the key differential roles of individual columns within the perception of breathlessness."

Cardiac- and respiratory- related waveforms were used to form voxelwise noise regressors (Physiological noise modelling; FSL version 5.0.8), and the signal associated with these regressors was modelled using retrospective image correction (RETROICOR) (<a href=\"#bib9\">Brookes, et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Harvey et al., 2008</a>).

The first-level analysis in FEAT incorporated a general linear model (<a href=\"#bib65\">Woolrich et al., 2004a</a>), where the finger opposition regressor was derived from the protocol timing values. Inspiratory resistance timings were calculated from the onset to termination of each of the resistance applications from the recorded pressure trace. The anticipation periods were calculated as the time between presentation of the stimulus and onset of inspiratory resistance. Ratings for all respiratory and baseline conditions were included as a rating regressor, that was demeaned against the constant-height inspiratory resistance regressor, to model out variations between the respiratory stimuli. P<sub>ET</sub>CO<sub>2</sub> was included as an additional regressor, de-correlating the CO<sub>2</sub> \u2013induced BOLD changes from the respiratory stimuli throughout the functional scan. This trace was formed by linearly interpolating between the expired CO<sub>2</sub> peaks. Previous research has indicated that variations in the hemodynamic response function (HRF) are apparent throughout the brainstem and cortex (<a href=\"#bib16\">Devonshire et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Handwerker et al., 2004</a>), and between subjects (<a href=\"#bib27\">Handwerker et al., 2004</a>). To account for possible changes in the HRF, including slice-timing delays, we used an optimal basis set of three waveforms (FLOBS: FMRIB\u2019s Linear Optimal Basis Sets, default FLOBS supplied in FSL [<a href=\"#bib66\">Woolrich et al., 2004b</a>]), instead of the standard gamma waveform. The second and third FLOBS waveforms, which model the temporal and dispersion derivatives, were orthogonalised to the first waveform, of which the parameter estimate was then passed up to the higher level to be used in group analysis. Time-series statistical analysis was performed using FILM, with local autocorrelation correction (<a href=\"#bib67\">Woolrich et al., 2001</a>)."

Univariate analysis of the group mean was performed, and anxiety ratings were used as a covariate of interest in a whole-brain linear regression. Small-volume masks of the vlPAG and lPAG (adapted from diffusion-based segmentation of the human PAG [<a href=\"#bib18\">Ezra et al., 2015</a>]) and the whole PAG were used to investigate a-priori areas of interest, using standard cluster thresholding (<i>Z</i>&gt;2.3). A further higher-level covariate analysis was performed, which included additional resistance and anxiety scores as demeaned regressors in the higher-level analysis, where the average resistance score across trials was calculated for each subject, and the anxiety score was taken as the anxiety of certain resistance. We included pack years (cigarettes per day x number of years) as a confound regressor to account for any minimal subject history of smoking."

Please clarify what these connections are, since they are the basis of this study. By far the most important connection of the PAG regarding respiration control is to the nucleus retroambiguus, the only cell group that has direct access to all the motor neurons innervating muscles involved in thoracic and abdominal pressure control. The first time this was demonstrated was by Holstege, 1989 (JCN 284: 242-252). As you discuss the role of the PAG in the integration of motor and autonomic mechanisms integral to the sensorimotor integration of dyspnea in the PAG, you might want to consider a discussion of the PAG modulation of respiratory neurons in the VLM (Subramanian, 2013; Subramanian and Holstege, 2013). This modulation is dependent on the type of behavior selected. Moreover, the PAG mediation of the hypoxic ventilatory response (Lopes et al., 2014) along with the suffocation alarm system in the PAG (Schmitel et al., 2012) is also an interesting aspect related to dyspnea.</i> "

While the use of the 7 T scanner affords greater intrinsic signal within the voxels, reducing the size decreases this signal within each voxel. Therefore, we have used the 7 T scanner properties to gain greater resolution, rather than the potential increase in signal required to observe scaled activity across subjects with this noisy stimulus."
