African trypanosomes possess hundreds of <i>variant surface glycoprotein</i> (<i>VSG</i>) genes, but only one is expressed from a telomeric expression site (ES) at any given time. We found that the expression of a second <i>VSG</i> alone is sufficient to silence the active <i>VSG</i> gene and directionally attenuate the ES by disruptor of telomeric silencing-1B (DOT1B)-mediated histone methylation. Three conserved expression-site-associated genes (ESAGs) appear to serve as signal for ES attenuation. Their depletion causes G1-phase dormancy and reversible initiation of the slender-to-stumpy differentiation pathway. ES-attenuated slender bloodstream trypanosomes gain full developmental competence for transformation to the tsetse fly stage. This surprising connection between antigenic variation and developmental progression provides an unexpected point of attack against the deadly sleeping sickness."

This surprising connection between antigenic variation and developmental progression provides an unexpected point of attack against the deadly sleeping sickness."

In the mammalian host, the cell surface is covered with millions of copies of VSG that form a dense layer that is virtually impervious to host-derived antibodies (<a href=\"#bib9\">Cross, 1975</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Engstler et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Schwede et al., 2011</a>). VSGs are highly immunogenic and provoke a rapid and efficient immune response that diminishes the parasite population. Only trypanosomes that have successfully switched to expression of another, structurally similar but immunologically distinct VSG survive. Trypanosomes possess several hundred <i>VSG</i> genes (<a href=\"#bib3\">Berriman et al., 2005</a>). Their potentially unlimited capacity for antigenic variation forms the basis of trypanosome persistence and virulence. <i>VSG</i> genes are expressed from one of \u223c15 telomeric expression sites (ES) but only one of these is transcribed at any given time (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hertz-Fowler et al., 2008</a>). Chromatin remodeling appears to play an important role in maintaining the monoallelic expression of the active ES (<a href=\"#bib20\">Horn and McCulloch, 2010</a>). Antigenic variation can result from either a change in the active ES, usually gene conversion at the <i>VSG</i> locus, or by an epigenetic change that results in silencing of the active ES and transcription of a previously silent ES (in situ switch). No mechanism or factor has been identified that is involved in the initiation of the latter."

Throughout the parasite's life cycle, the plasma membrane is covered with a series of different surface coats. Antigenic variation only occurs in the mammalian host, and not in the transmitting tsetse fly. Consequently, the trypanosome bloodstream form ES is exclusively functional in the proliferating slender bloodstream stage of the parasite. In response to quorum sensing, the trypanosomes differentiate to the quiescent stumpy form. Stumpy forms are competent for the next developmental transition to procyclic forms, which occurs after ingestion by a tsetse fly (<a href=\"#bib29\">Reuner et al., 1997</a>). This developmental transition is accompanied by silencing of the active ES so that allelic exclusion is lost. How this silencing is achieved is unknown."

Furthermore, we show that transcriptional activity of the ES directly determines cell proliferation and developmental competence via a subset of <i>expression site associated genes (ESAGs)</i>.

To distinguish between these possibilities, we quantified other mRNAs derived from the ES. As transcription of the ES is polycistronic, any transcriptional silencing would also affect genes upstream of the <i>VSG</i>. Initially, the levels of three <i>ESAG</i> mRNAs were measured over a period of 8 hr after <i>VSG121</i> induction (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>). It appears that mRNAs from the telomere proximal <i>ESAG1</i> and <i>2</i> genes decreased faster than mRNA from the telomere distal <i>ESAG12</i> gene. To examine whether this effect was the result of different mRNA half-lives, we inserted the same <i>GFP</i> transgene either upstream of the <i>VSG</i> gene (promoter distal) or next to the ES promoter (promoter proximal) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Upon induction of <i>VSG121</i> expression, the promoter proximal <i>GFP</i> mRNA decreased with significantly slower kinetics (p&lt;0.018; two-way ANOVA test) than that of the promoter distal <i>GFP</i> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, left panel), revealing that the kinetics of <i>GFP</i> mRNA reduction was determined solely by the position of the <i>GFP</i> gene within the active ES. Thus, <i>VSG121</i> overexpression caused a gradual loss of ES activity that started at the telomere and propagated towards the <i>VSG</i> promoter. This process was completed within one cell division cycle and was maintained for 120 hr (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Then the ES was gradually reactivated in the reverse direction (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>).

Parasite growth was not affected for the first 24 hr of tetracycline induction, but then cell proliferation slowed down significantly (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). The cell cycle was analyzed by determining the nucleus (N) and kinetoplast (K) configuration and showed an accumulation of 1K1N cells with the kinetoplasts having a pre-replication morphology and a reduction of cells containing a dividing kinetoplast (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,C</a>). These observations are consistent with the slowed growth resulting from a G1 phase prolongation. To test this model, the percentage of cells in S-phase was determined at different times after induction of <i>VSG121</i> expression. Cells were incubated with the nucleoside-analogue EdU for either 4 or 18 hr (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). In the control (0 hr), 80% of trypanosomes had entered nuclear S-phase within the 4-hr labeling window. In contrast, after 24 hr of <i>VSG121</i> expression only 17% incorporated EdU into nuclear DNA within an equivalent 4-hr window. However, when the parasites were incubated with EdU for 18 hr, 86% had entered S-phase. Thus, the cells were clearly not arrested in the cell cycle, but showed a specific, at least fivefold expansion of the G1-phase from 3 to 15 hr. Remarkably, all trypanosomes remained fully motile and no morphological abnormality or cell death was observed. The marked G1-phase prolongation obviously required a reduction in metabolic flux and anabolic pathways, including protein synthesis, which in turn might be reflected in decreased overall RNA synthesis. Therefore, we measured total RNA synthesis by labeling nascent transcripts with BrUTP and detection with an anti-BrdU antibody. After 8 hr of tetracycline induction, when <i>VSG221</i> transcripts had already decreased to 20%, the general transcription rate was not impaired at all. Only after 24 hr was the global transcription reduced to 30% (p&lt;0.0001; unpaired <i>t</i> test) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). This formally proves that ES attenuation precedes growth retardation and general transcriptional diminution. To test if RNA polymerase I and II transcription was both affected, we inserted luciferase reporter transgenes either downstream of an rDNA promoter or into the <i>tubulin</i>-locus (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In both the cases, luciferase activity was down to 30\u201350% within 2 days. Thus, all tested regions of the genome were slowly silenced. This also explains the gradual decrease in the amount of ectopically expressed <i>VSG121</i> mRNA, which started after 24 hr of tetracycline induction (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>) that is at a time when the active <i>VSG221</i> ES was already attenuated."

To test if DOT1B was also required for the attenuation of the active ES upon ectopic <i>VSG</i> expression, we inserted the tetracycline-inducible <i>VSG121</i> gene into <i>DOT1B-</i>deleted trypanosomes (\u0394dot1b.221<sup>ES</sup>.121<sup>tet</sup>) (<a href=\"#bib20a\">Janzen et al., 2006</a>). Following induction of <i>VSG121</i> expression, the decrease of the ES-resident VSG221 protein occurred with the same kinetics as in the parental cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). However, unlike in the parental cell line the protein levels did not increase again. Furthermore, the cells did not display a growth phenotype (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Therefore, we measured ES activity just upstream of the <i>VSG221</i> gene by inserting a luciferase reporter transgene into both \u0394dot1b and parental cell lines (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). As expected, the luciferase activity decreased rapidly in the parental cells (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, right panel). However, in the <i>DOT1B</i>-knockout trypanosomes luciferase activity was only marginally and transiently reduced at day 2 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, left panel). Thus, in <i>DOT1B</i>-deleted cells, the ES was not attenuated, except for the most telomere-proximal part, where the <i>VSG221</i> gene resides. This suggests that silencing of a <i>VSG</i> gene can be uncoupled from ES silencing. While ES attenuation seems to require DOT1B-dependent histone tri-methylation, <i>VSG</i> silencing does not. This is remarkable as it suggests a mechanism that specifically represses the telomeric <i>VSG</i> gene but not any other part of the ES (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Furthermore, these results formally prove that the ES-resident <i>VSG</i> can be complemented in trans by a heterologous <i>VSG</i> gene. We conclude that the activation of a new <i>VSG</i> ES initiates an in situ switch, and that high-level expression of a second VSG is sufficient to attenuate and eventually silence the formerly active ES. This feedback loop assures monoallelic expression of the <i>VSG</i>."

This developmental transition occurs in the mammalian bloodstream and involves ES-attenuation and growth arrest. The VSG-induced ES attenuation described here does not cause a bona fide cell cycle arrest and the parasites do not display the typical morphology of stumpy trypanosomes. Nevertheless, we hypothesized that the ES-attenuated parasites could have adopted stumpy-like characteristics and actually may represent the enigmatic intermediate stage, which is not yet committed to stumpy differentiation. Therefore, we tested for expression of the cell surface transporter <i>protein associated with differentiation 1</i> (PAD1), which is a molecular marker for stumpy cells and is not expressed in the dividing slender stage (<a href=\"#bib10\">Dean et al., 2009</a>). In addition to a PAD1-specific antibody, we used a transgene, <i>GFP:PAD</i><sub><i>utr</i></sub>, encoding a GFP with a nuclear localization signal and a <i>PAD1</i> 3\u2032UTR (J Sunter, A Schwede and M Carrington, unpublished), which confers the stage specificity of PAD1 (<a href=\"#bib23\">MacGregor and Matthews, 2012</a>). This reporter allowed for live cell analysis of PAD1-expression by flow cytometry (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Prior to induction of the ectopic <i>VSG</i>, the cells showed no PAD1-expression and no GFP signal. After 48 hr of <i>VSG121</i> overexpression, however, the PAD1 protein was clearly detectable on the surface of trypanosomes in the G1-phase of the cell cycle (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>). Likewise, the GFP:PAD<sub>utr</sub> reporter was visible in most G1 cells, but was also expressed in a minor portion of trypanosomes in other cell cycle phases (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). This is in agreement with the observation that the <i>PAD1</i> mRNA is detectable prior to the protein (<a href=\"#bib22\">MacGregor et al., 2012</a>). We conclude that in the absence of the quorum-sensing factor SIF and at 37\u00b0C, the <i>VSG</i> overexpression-induced ES attenuation triggers G1-phase prolongation and concomitant expression of a bona fide stumpy marker in monomorphic slender stage trypanosomes. Notably, PAD1 expression was induced despite the global transcriptional attenuation that started at the same time. This again is reminiscent of the situation in stumpy parasites, where PAD1 expression is induced while general transcription decreases (<a href=\"#bib2\">Amiguet-Vercher et al., 2004</a>)."

If so, the parasites should have become sensitive to the differentiation trigger <i>cis</i>-aconitate, the chemical cue that triggers progression from the stumpy to the procyclic insect stage. This developmental step is accompanied by loss of the VSG coat and expression of the surface protein EP. We induced <i>VSG121</i> expression for 48 hr and then incubated the trypanosomes in the absence of tetracycline with 6 mM <i>cis</i>-aconitate. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed EP1 surface expression as early as 6 hr after addition of <i>cis</i>-aconitate (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Thus, the mechanism of cell surface access block that prevents EP1 from being routed to the plasma membrane of proliferating bloodstream parasites had been deactivated, just as in stumpy cells (<a href=\"#bib12\">Engstler and Boshart, 2004</a>). To quantify the EP1 surface expression, samples were collected 0, 6, and 24 hr after addition of <i>cis</i>-aconitate and analyzed by flow cytometry. In the control cells, no fluorescent EP1 signal was detectable (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>).

After 24 hr, 70(\u00b16)% of cells were EP1-positive (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>). Furthermore, the trypanosomes also altered their cell architecture, adopting a stumpy-like morphology after 6 hr of <i>cis</i>-aconitate treatment. After 24 hr, the posterior part of the cells had elongated and the kinetoplast had repositioned and segregated (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

As growth of procyclic trypanosomes in fact requires temperatures of 27\u00b0C or below and a specific culture medium, we repeated the experiment at 27\u00b0C in the differentiation medium DTM (<a href=\"#bib27\">Overath et al., 1986</a>). Following tetracycline removal, ES-attenuated trypanosomes were incubated with <i>cis</i>-aconitate for 6 and 24 hr, and then analyzed for EP1 expression using flow cytometry. After 6 hr, 58(\u00b18)% of cells revealed strong EP1 fluorescence on the cell surface, while only 5(\u00b12)% of the control population were EP1-positive (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D,E</a>). Interestingly, the ES-attenuated trypanosomes accelerated the cell cycle after 24 hr and started growing as procyclic trypanosomes (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>). This delayed growth response is a characteristic of the differentiation of stumpy trypanosomes to the procyclic insect stage (<a href=\"#bib35\">van Deursen et al., 2001</a>) and probably marks the terminal shutdown of the attenuated ES. We conclude that the VSG-induced ES attenuation triggers the cell biological reprogramming of the parasite and causes the concomitant gain of full developmental competence."

As shown above, the reduction of ES activity is gradual, affecting the telomere-proximal <i>ESAG1</i> and <i>2</i> first. Therefore, we initially examined if loss of these two ESAGs resulted in G1-prolongation and/or PAD1-induction.

The parasite has evolved an efficient system of antigenic variation that relies on monoallelic expression of <i>VSG</i> genes (<a href=\"#bib5\">Borst, 2002</a>). Though the system is optimized for a monotypic coat, two VSGs have to be handled on the same cell surface during antigen switching. Although nothing is known about the length of this period, the different underlying molecular mechanisms suggest variable time scales. Telomere exchange or gene conversion are probably rather fast processes as loss of <i>VSG</i> mRNA by RNAi results in rapid cell cycle arrest (<a href=\"#bib32\">Sheader et al., 2005</a>).

The induction of <i>VSG121</i> expression resulted in the rapid decrease of <i>VSG221</i> mRNA and protein. The ectopic VSG121 dominated the surface coat for several days. The <i>ESAG</i>s were also down regulated, showing that induction of a second <i>VSG</i> gene attenuates the entire active ES. The insertion of reporter genes showed that this ES attenuation starts at the telomere and progresses towards the promoter region. Our data further indicate that the initial spike in the production of ectopic VSG acts as an immediate early signal, which is relayed to an epigenetic ES silencing machinery that requires the histone methyltransferase DOT1B. This model further explains the expression levels in stable VSG double-expressors that have a second <i>VSG</i> inserted into the active ES, just upstream of the endogenous copy (<a href=\"#bib25\">Mu\u00f1oz-Jord\u00e1n et al., 1996</a>). In these double-expressors, both VSGs are expressed in a 50/50 ratio, not exceeding a total amount of 100% compared to wild-type single expressors (data not shown). The generation of such double-expressors requires antibiotic selection for 7 days after transfection. In that time, the trypanosomes react to the initial overexpression of VSG, which occurs immediately after recombination of the transgene into the active ES, and attenuate the ES. When the VSG expression is adapted, attenuation is hold, not affecting the upstream located <i>ESAG</i>s. Thus, high-level expression of a second <i>VSG</i> alone is sufficient to initiate attenuation of the active ES. Importantly and unlike the endogenous <i>VSG</i>, this second <i>VSG</i> does not have to be expressed from an ES and it does not need to be transcribed by RNA polymerase I. Furthermore, <i>VSG</i> silencing and shutdown of the active ES are mechanistically distinct events, as in <i>DOT1B</i>-knockout trypanosomes, the ES-resident <i>VSG</i> is silenced upon <i>VSG</i> overexpression, but the <i>ESAG</i>s are not. No phenotype is observed after <i>VSG</i> overexpression in the <i>DOT1B</i>-knockout cells, proving that neither the initial surplus of VSG production nor the non-trypanosomal T7 RNA polymerase system is toxic."

This is strongly reminiscent of the VSG-mediated attenuation of the trypanosome ES reported here. Despite the enormous evolutionary distance between kinetoplastids and mammals the mechanistic principle appears to be conserved. The trypanosome model obviously offers some opportunities that are not readily available in the OR system, such as following the kinetics of initiation and reversal of gene silencing. Furthermore, in trypanosomes an array of genes is attenuated, whereas in the olfactory system only the <i>OR</i> is silenced. Importantly, the OR system fulfills a single function, namely detection of an almost infinite number of odorant molecules. Our work suggests that the control of monoallelic expression of <i>VSG</i> links at least three key-processes, namely antigenic variation, host range determination, and parasite development. Our findings clearly support a model in which the <i>VSG</i> ES orchestrates events at the crossroads of antigenic variation, cell cycle, and development. The trypanosome cell can operate for significant periods in a dormant state. This ability may become crucial in the course of an in situ switch to a non-functional or impaired VSG or upon activation of a defective ES. Any trypanosome with an attenuated ES will experience a time window of full developmental competence. Thus, the stumpy life cycle stage with its genuine cell cycle arrest can be bypassed."

Interestingly, the cells react by not fully silencing the ES, but rather attenuating its activity to about 20%, probably by chromatin remodeling after histone methylation. In response to ES attenuation trypanosomes enter a semi-quiescent state with a specifically extended G1-phase. The parasites remain in this slow growth state for about 5 days and then resume normal growth without any sign of reduced fitness. While ES attenuation is triggered by the brief period of true <i>VSG</i> overexpression, the entry into the dormant phase is the consequence of ESAG shortage. It is important to note that ES attenuation does not lead to complete ESAG exhaustion, but rather to gradual reduction in expression. Thus, individual ESAGs could reach growth-limiting levels at different concentrations and hence, could induce G1-retardation at different times. In fact, depletion of <i>ESAG1</i> mRNA by RNAi leads to transient growth retardation after 48 hr. The cells recover from this phenotype 2 days later, which is in agreement with the existence of <i>ESAG1</i> knockout lines (<a href=\"#bib7\">Carruthers et al., 1996</a>). Importantly, even depletion of the non-essential and ES-specific <i>ESAG8</i> (<a href=\"#bib19\">Hoek and Cross, 2001</a>) becomes growth limiting for a transient period. In contrast, <i>ESAG2</i>-RNAi is irreversibly lethal and therefore, a complete ES shutdown without functional rescue from non-ES copies or a new ES would be detrimental. Although essential, the down-regulation of <i>ESAG2</i> to the level prevailing in ES-attenuated cells (20%) is tolerated. However, the function of these ESAGs remains elusive. ESAG1 and 2 are N-glycosylated, membrane-associated proteins localized in the flagellar pocket. It is suggested that both could function in the endosome pathway (<a href=\"#bib26a\">Nolan et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Pays et al., 2001</a>). Thus, ESAG1 and 2 could act in concert, which would explain the in parts redundant RNAi phenotypes. In contrast, ESAG8 is found in the nucleolus and the cytoplasm, and interacts with a Puf family member (<a href=\"#bib18a\">Hoek et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib19a\">Hoek et al., 2002</a>). This suggests that ESAG8 plays a role in mRNA regulation and might be linked to the differentiation pathway."

If both VSGs are compatible, and produce a mixed and dense surface coat and the <i>ESAG</i>s of the new ES are fully functional, the old expression site is rapidly and completely silenced with no effects on cell cycle progression. However, if any component of the new ES fails or is not sufficiently functional, the cells can adjust growth, in the extreme, to very basal levels. This way the parasites may either gain time to adapt to the new conditions or reverse the attenuation and re-activate the old ES. We suggest that the latter case resembles an unsuccessful switching event, which would escape experimental detection. In fact, we can only observe successful <i>VSG</i> switching events, thereby neglecting the surprising capacity of trypanosomes to reverse switching directions."

Hence, ES switching plasticity could determine the host range. One extreme example for this is <i>Trypanosoma b. rhodesiense,</i> which is human-infective and thought to be a host-range variant of <i>T. b. brucei</i>. The parasites are specifically adapted to human serum by expression of the serum-resistance antigen (SRA) from one particular <i>VSG</i> ES in most isolates. The structure of the <i>SRA</i>-containing ES is unusual as it is missing several <i>ESAG</i>s present in all other ESs. During an infection of a human, an in situ switch to a <i>VSG</i> in another ES would cause loss of <i>SRA</i> expression, with lethal consequences. Thus, <i>T. b. rhodesiense</i> must not switch off the <i>SRA</i>-containing ES, thus making the ESAG-dependent differentiation pathway obsolete. This may be the reason why the <i>T. b. rhodesiense</i> ES has lost <i>ESAG1</i>, <i>2</i> and <i>8</i>."

The developmental transition from the proliferating slender to the quiescent stumpy bloodstream stage is initiated by quorum sensing of the trypanosome-derived compound SIF (<a href=\"#bib29\">Reuner et al., 1997</a>). The monomorphic cells used in this study are unresponsive to SIF and hence, should have lost the capacity to differentiate to the tsetse-infective stage (<a href=\"#bib36\">Vassella et al., 1997</a>). In our experiments, however, VSG-induced ES attenuation renders monomorphic trypanosomes fully competent for development. After 2 days of <i>VSG</i> overexpression the stumpy stage marker PAD1 was strongly up-regulated, specifically in G1-phase cells, and despite global transcriptional silencing being initiated at the same time. This indicates a highly specific event, which, in the absence of SIF, is orchestrated solely by the state of the <i>VSG</i> expression site. We are currently investigating this alternative pathway in a pleomorphic strain. The induced expression of a second <i>VSG</i> indeed leads to the formation of stumpy forms (data not shown). While VSG itself is not involved, as it is not limiting in our system, three ESAGs signal ES attenuation to the differentiation pathway. Depletion of <i>ESAG</i>s <i>1, 2</i> and <i>8</i> mRNA by RNAi resulted in induction of the PAD1 reporter GFP:PAD<sub>utr</sub>. Down-regulation of any of the other <i>ESAG</i>s did not cause GFP:PAD<sub>utr</sub> expression. This underlines the specificity of the pathway and suggests that ES activity controls the induction of transient developmental competence. Remarkably, by embedding the endogenous PAD1 protein into the VSG coat, the ES attenuated trypanosomes became fully responsive to the developmental trigger <i>cis</i>-aconitate. They initiated transformation to the procyclic insect stage with the same kinetics as stumpy parasites."

We postulate that these parasites linger in an intermediate state with open developmental choices (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). They have the capacity to complete ES switching by adapting to the new ES or, alternatively, they can re-activate the old, attenuated ES. In both of these cases the parasites resume growth as mammalian bloodstream form cells. If taken up by the tsetse fly, however, they would immediately transform to the procyclic insect stage."

This dormancy can last for up to 5 days and is fully reversible. Within this period the trypanosomes become competent for developmental stage transition, which involves expression of the stumpy marker PAD1. The stumpy stage, however, is irreversibly arrested in G0 and therefore committed to a life in the tsetse fly. In contrast, ES attenuation causes a reversible G1 dormancy, which allows either re-activation of the attenuated ES (<i>unsuccessful switch</i>) or survival by development in the insect vector.

For VSG IF, chemically fixed cells were incubated with a mouse anti-VSG121 (1:100) and a rabbit anti-VSG221 (1:100) antibody, followed by incubation with an Alexa488- and Alexa594-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit antibody, respectively (1:1000). For PAD1 detection, chemically fixed cells were permeabilized with 0.05% Triton X-100 for 10 min and incubated with a rabbit anti-PAD1 antibody (1:100), followed by incubation with an Alexa488-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (1:1000). Flow cytometry was performed with a BD Bioscience FACSCalibur Flow Cytometer. Data were analyzed with the BD CellQuest Pro Software. For each sample, 20,000 cells were counted."

If a new <i>VSG</i> ES is activated that contains a full and functional complement of <i>ESAGs</i>, none of those would become limiting when the old ES is attenuated. This in situ switch would rapidly be completed without any effects on cell proliferation. This is what we have defined in our model as a 'successful switch' (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). In contrast, if the newly activated ES does not contain a fully functional or host-compatible set of ESAGs, the trypanosomes would respond to ES attenuation with dormancy and gain of developmental competence. The parasites either adapt to the new ES (as is the case with the unusual <i>T. b. rhodesiense</i> SRA-containing ES; see below), they develop in the tsetse vector, or \u2018simply\u2019 reactivate the old ES.

This suggests that <i>ESAG1</i> might function as a receptor protein (<a href=\"#bib28\">Pays et al. 2001</a>). Likewise, <i>ESAG2</i> is found in the flagellar pocket, but this protein is GPI-anchored and heavily modified with linear p-NAL glycan chains. Thus, <i>ESAG2</i> could function in the elaborate endosome pathway (Nolan et al. 1999). It is tempting to speculate that <i>ESAG1</i> and 2 act in concert, as this would explain the redundant RNAi phenotypes. In contrast, <i>ESAG8</i> is a nucleolar protein that is also distributed in the cytoplasm (Hoek et al. 2000) and interacts with a Puf family member (Hoek et al. 2002). This suggests that <i>ESAG8</i> could play a role in the regulation of mRNA stability, maybe during development. <i>ESAG6/7</i> form a transferrin receptor required for iron uptake and thus have a crucial function in metabolism. <i>ESAG3</i> contains a secretion signal peptide but apparently lacks a membrane-spanning domain and a GPI-anchor (<a href=\"#bib28\">Pays et al. 2001</a>).
