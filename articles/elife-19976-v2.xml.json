In vivo, wide-field GCaMP imaging and sub-cortical/cortical cellular electrophysiology were used in mice to investigate relationships between spontaneous single neuron spiking and mesoscopic cortical activity. We make use of a rich set of cortical activity motifs that are present in spontaneous activity in anesthetized and awake animals. A mesoscale spike-triggered averaging procedure allowed the identification of motifs that are preferentially linked to individual spiking neurons by employing genetically targeted indicators of neuronal activity. Thalamic neurons predicted and reported specific cycles of wide-scale cortical inhibition/excitation. In contrast, spike-triggered maps derived from single cortical neurons yielded spatio-temporal maps expected for regional cortical consensus function. This approach can define network relationships between any point source of neuronal spiking and mesoscale cortical maps."

In vivo, wide-field GCaMP imaging and sub-cortical/cortical cellular electrophysiology were used in mice to investigate relationships between spontaneous single neuron spiking and mesoscopic cortical activity. We make use of a rich set of cortical activity motifs that are present in spontaneous activity in anesthetized and awake animals. A mesoscale spike-triggered averaging procedure allowed the identification of motifs that are preferentially linked to individual spiking neurons by employing genetically targeted indicators of neuronal activity. Thalamic neurons predicted and reported specific cycles of wide-scale cortical inhibition/excitation. In contrast, spike-triggered maps derived from single cortical neurons yielded spatio-temporal maps expected for regional cortical consensus function. This approach can define network relationships between any point source of neuronal spiking and mesoscale cortical maps."

                        "text": "Neural activity ranges from the microscale of synapses to macroscale brain-wide networks. Mesoscale networks occupy an intermediate space and are well studied in cortex forming the basis of sensory and motor maps (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bohland et al., 2009</a>). These networks are largely defined by co-activation of neurons and have been evaluated with a variety of statistical approaches that capitalize on detecting synchrony. The study of large-scale networks (meso-to macroscale) has been mostly restricted to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), or magnetoencephalography that can capture whole-brain activity patterns (<a href=\"#bib17\">de Pasquale et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Kahn et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Logothetis et al., 2012</a>), but lack high spatial and temporal resolution and sensitivity. To overcome these limitations, alternative approaches including mesoscopic intrinsic signal, voltage, glutamate, or calcium sensitive indicator imaging have been employed (<a href=\"#bib39\">Kleinfeld et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Kenet et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Ferezou et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Chemla and Chavane, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Chen et al., 2013b</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Mohajerani et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Stroh et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Vanni and Murphy, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Carandini et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Chan et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Madisen et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Wekselblatt et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib85\">Xie et al., 2016</a>). New preparations using large-scale craniotomies (<a href=\"#bib38\">Kim et al., 2016b</a>) and large format imaging systems (<a href=\"#bib79\">Tsai et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Sofroniew et al., 2016</a>) provide the ability to link mesoscale activity patterns to individual neurons. However, these measures are restricted to superficial layers of cortex and cannot assess linkages with sub-cortical structures. Developments in fiberoptic technology allow local optical functional assessment of brain activity in sub-cortical structures (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hamel et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Kim et al., 2016a</a>), but cannot simultaneously resolve cortex over large fields of view. Although the evolution of imaging has revealed new aspects of cortical processing in identified neurons (<a href=\"#bib30\">Harvey et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Chen et al., 2013a</a>, <a href=\"#bib14\">Chen et al., 2013b</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Fu et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Guo et al., 2014</a>), the electrically recorded action potential is still a signal of prominence given its exquisite timing and ability to reflect the output of neuronal networks (<a href=\"#bib8\">Buzs\u00e1ki, 2004</a>)."

                        "text": "We combine extracellular recordings of single units in the\u00a0cortex, thalamus, and other sub-cortical sites with mesoscopic functional imaging in transgenic mice expressing the calcium indicator GCaMP (<a href=\"#bib87\">Zariwala et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Vanni and Murphy, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Silasi et al., 2016</a>). While slower than protein-based or small molecule voltage sensors, GCaMP imaging offers a high signal-to-noise ratio and is associated with supra-threshold activity which allows a more direct comparison with spike activity. This work extends pioneering studies investigating the relationship between single neuron spiking and local neuronal population activity assessed by voltage-sensitive dye imaging. Spike-triggered averaging (STA) was used to identify the local activity profile related to the spiking activity of a single neuron within this population (<a href=\"#bib4\">Arieli et al., 1995</a>), and it was further demonstrated that this activity profile could reveal the instantaneous spatial pattern of ongoing population activity related to a neuron\u2019s optimal stimulus in visual cortex of anesthetized cat (<a href=\"#bib80\">Tsodyks et al., 1999</a>). This current study extends these approaches and also exploits the main advantage of mesoscopic imaging allowing the simultaneous measurement of brain activity in multiple regions across most of cortex simultaneously and not only that of the local population of activity surrounding the recording site. This multiscale strategy has allowed us to define temporal relationships between the activity of single neurons at the microscopic scale and mesoscale cortical maps (<a href=\"#bib88\">Zingg et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Madisen et al., 2015</a>). Furthermore, we employ multisite, long shank, silicon probe recordings of single neuron activity that facilitates the assessment of long-distance activity relationships between remote subcortical single neuron activity and mesoscale cortical population activity. Spontaneous activity in awake and anesthetized mice was exploited as a source of diverse cortical network activity motifs (<a href=\"#bib49\">Mohajerani et al., 2010</a>, <a href=\"#bib48\">2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Chan et al., 2015</a>). Application of STA to cortical spontaneous activity linked single neurons to mesoscale networks. Single thalamic neuron spikes were found to functionally link to multiple primary sensorimotor maps, in contrast spiking cortical neurons were largely associated with consensus cortical maps. Thalamic neurons were found to both predict and report (firing before and after) specific cycles of wide-scale cortical inhibition/excitation, while cortical neuron firing was usually associated with excitation. These results are consistent with an active computational role of thalamus in sensory-motor processing (<a href=\"#bib78\">Theyel et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Hooks et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Petrus et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Sheroziya and Timofeev, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">McCormick et al., 2015</a>), as opposed to merely serving a relay function and is consistent with a diverse role of the thalamus in feedforward sensory processing. Thalamocortical transmission can dynamically and differentially recruit local cortical excitation and inhibition based on thalamic neuron firing patterns and where thalamocortical feedforward inhibition is a critical feature\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib24\">Galarreta and Hestrin, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Swadlow and Gusev, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Gabernet et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Cruikshank et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Hu and Agmon, 2016</a>). We expect that this spike-triggered cortical mapping technique, exploiting mesoscopic calcium imaging, can be extended to any brain location where electrodes can be placed to identify functionally linked cortical mesoscale networks."

Cortical and sub-cortical neuron spiking activities were recorded electrically while simultaneously imaging cortical mesoscopic activity across a 9\u00a0\u00d7\u00a09 mm bilateral window that encompassed multiple areas of the mouse dorsal cortex including somatosensory, motor, visual, retrosplenial, parietal association and cingulate areas (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>). Spectral decomposition of the mesoscopic spontaneous activity using GCaMP6 revealed the presence of information below 10 Hz that was distinct from non-specific green light reflectance (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Given the slow Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding and unbinding kinetics of GCaMP6, we expect imaging dynamics will be prolonged compared to actual spike records. In some cases, we employed deconvolution (<a href=\"#bib60\">Pnevmatikakis et al., 2016</a>) to improve the time course of raw calcium signals (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). While deconvolution improved the temporal dynamics of the decay of the calcium signal, spike-triggered analysis was only marginally affected and it was not used throughout. Spiking signals were initially recorded in multiple brain areas using glass electrodes (n\u00a0=\u00a08 mice) to minimize obstruction of cortical imaging and reduce potential for damage from electrode placement. Subsequently, laminar probes (16 channel with 0.1 mm contact spacing) permitted the resolution of more spiking neurons simultaneously, and facilitated the recordings in multiple sub-cortical regions (n\u00a0=\u00a016 mice). Given the invasive nature and the long duration of recordings, initial data were obtained from urethane (n\u00a0=\u00a04) or isoflurane (n\u00a0=\u00a012) anesthetized adult mice, but were later optimized to include awake recordings (n\u00a0=\u00a012, see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods). The spike-triggered average maps\u00a0(STMs) obtained under both these conditions were qualitatively similar, and this observation was consistent with previous work using VSD imaging (<a href=\"#bib48\">Mohajerani et al., 2013</a>). To perform these assessments, we identified single neuron spikes from extracellular recordings using spike sorting methods based on clustering of principal components distributions of spike signals on sets of adjacent channels (<a href=\"#bib76\">Swindale and Spacek, 2014</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>)."

For each individual spike, we considered cortical image frames from 3s before to 3s after the spike normalized as \u0394F/F<sub>0</sub> by subtracting and dividing the average calcium activity during the 3s preceding the spike. The static STM was then defined as the peak response (in units of \u0394F/F<sub>0</sub>) calculated for each pixel within a time window of\u00a0\u00b11 s. This peak method is a better reflection of correlated activity than the average over the\u00a0\u00b11 s interval which would smooth out highly activated \u2013 but short duration activity increases. This method revealed that the activity recorded from a single right barrel cortex neuron yielded an STM showing strong and specific GCaMP signal in the barrel and motor cortices of both hemispheres (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1Ei</a>). STMs were thus calculated by averaging calcium activity during spiking activity (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1Eii</a>) and revealed the high spatial specificity of the mapping when compared with reference region (hind limb) or random spike averaging (see Materials and methods) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1Eiii</a>)."

To create SPMs, the cross-correlation coefficient r values between the temporal profiles of one selected pixel and all the others within the field of view were calculated (<a href=\"#bib48\">Mohajerani et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Vanni and Murphy, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Chan et al., 2015</a>) (see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods). To evaluate the similarity between the static STM and SPMs, we calculated the correlation coefficient between pixels of both types of maps for all possible SPMs in the library. We then selected the SPM that resulted in best match: highest correlation between a given STM and the library of SPMs. The library of SPMs is expected to reflect cortical consensus activity motifs (areas undergoing temporally-correlated activity) and can be largely attributed to their underlying intra-cortical axonal projections (<a href=\"#bib48\">Mohajerani et al., 2013</a>). Single cortical neuron-derived STMs were largely predicted by the pattern of cortical connectivity using SPM correlation mapping (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>) as correlations were relatively high between these SPMs and STMs (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). In contrast, thalamic STMs were more complex and corresponded to more unique distributions of cortical patterns and had significantly lower correlations with the cortical consensus SPM library (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,C</a>). For example, VPM, VPL and CP neurons can functionally link to multiple cortical areas that are not predicted by SPM (SPM made by putting the seeds in either BCS1, HLS1 or RS areas). In other words, it is possible that the cortical STMs derived from single spiking sub-cortical neurons are the super-position of 2 or more cortical networks defined by SPMs. To support this theory, we show examples comparing subcortical STMs to pairs of SPMs made from two seed locations that can lead to these potentially more complex maps (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). For example, the VPM STM could be constructed as a combination of a BCS1 and RS SPM (seed point a and b, respectively, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>)."

(<b>D</b>) STMs generated from the four sub-networks reveal substantial differences in the sub-network dynamics (top four STMs) with the sum of all STMs providing the average STM pattern (bottom STM).

The ISI histograms peak at\u00a0~33 ms (i.e. single inter-frame-interval) indicates that spontaneous motifs group naturally into sub-networks and are dominated by \u2018bursts\u2019 of similar motifs each separated by single frames.

It is conceivable that averaging all spike activity may mask STMs from sub-groups of spikes that contribute different motifs during varying ongoing cortical dynamics. One way to divide the spikes into groups is to partition them into bursting versus tonic modes. We found that both STMs and STMTDs are similar across spiking modes to the all-spike average STMs in both cortical and thalamic cells examined (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplements 1</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s2\">2</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s3\">3</a>; see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods).

However, we concede that in awake animals activity is rarely entirely spontaneous and that periods of volitional activity are present interspersed with relatively quiet intervals. Qualitative observations indicate limb twitches as well as tail and facial movements. In order to evaluate the impact of body movement on mapping, STAs were generated from spikes during periods of quietness and compared with STA from all spikes (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Period of quietness and movement were identified by measuring behavior imaging collected simultaneously with the neurophysiological data (see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods, <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1A</a> and <a href=\"#media5\">Video 5</a>). STA generated from periods of quietness did not differ from those generated with all spikes (see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods, <a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). This suggests that, even when some movement could be observed during recordings, they minimally contribute to the mapping. This data also indicated that periods of high movement were relatively rare in awake head-fixed mice under the conditions we have employed and contributed negligibly to overall STA maps. Therefore, brain imaging activity obtained in awake states is mostly indicative of a quiet awake state and is not primarily movement-related activity."

Increases in blood volume are expected to decrease both excitation and emission light. While we have implemented a multi-wavelength correction strategy (see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods), the corrections in practice did not appreciably alter cortical or thalamic STA maps or dynamics altering peak % \u0394F/F<sub>0\u00a0</sub>by more than 1/10 of the maximum \u0394F/F<sub>0</sub>. We provide examples of the strategy being employed (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). In these examples, we employ a short blue reference signal that correlated positively with apparent blood volume artifacts that were revealed by parallel experiments using green reflected light imaging (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1C,D</a>). Consequently, the ratio of green over blue signal greatly reduced the blood volume hemodynamic response. To determine whether the short blue correction strategy was effective, we assessed data from GFP-m mice that exhibit green fluorescence signals that are not expected to be the calcium dependent as in GCaMP6 mice (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). We used the ratio of F/F<sub>0</sub> green fraction signal to blue reflected light signal F/F<sub>0</sub> fraction to reduce nonspecific signals that were observed in GFP mice. Consistent with published work (<a href=\"#bib43\">Ma et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Wekselblatt et al., 2016</a>) blood volume artifacts were greatly reduced. This same strategy was then applied to GCaMP fluorescence data. Although the approach was effective at removing smaller non-specific signals in GFP-m mice, in practice, using GCaMP mice, where much larger activity-dependent signals were present, we revealed only a relatively small apparent contribution of blood volume to cortical and subcortical STA fluorescent signals as in other work (<a href=\"#bib82\">Vanni and Murphy, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Murphy et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Silasi et al., 2016</a>) (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1F,G</a>). Furthermore, thalamic STA maps and STA dynamic plots still indicated cases where thalamic spiking was associated with cortical inhibition. For these reasons, we have attempted to correct other STA maps using this multi-wavelength procedure."

Our results demonstrate that STMs can reveal functional cortical architecture related to the activity of individual cortical and subcortical-cortical neurons. Cortically recorded STMs reflect the cortical state when a neuron spikes in connected areas. We observed that the STMs of individual sub-cortical neurons had more variation than maps attributed to spiking cortical neurons. For example, sub-cortical STM patterns of neighboring neurons were more diverse than cortical neurons, and were less likely to match intra-cortical consensus activity patterns defined using SPM. Sub-cortical-neuron-derived STMs revealed multiple areas of activation and multimodal kinetic behavior, while intra-cortical spiking neuron networks were simpler in structure and kinetics. Furthermore, spiking sub-cortical neurons reflected diverse cortical multi-phasic excitation/inhibition timing patterns that were reflected in dynamic STMTDs. In contrast, most spiking cortical neurons were linked to a single phase of cortical excitation."

Other similar applications where single neuron spiking was recorded and related to spontaneous activity using calcium imaging have been restricted to in vitro brain slices (<a href=\"#bib1\">Aaron and Yuste, 2006</a>)). Our study extends previous in vivo work that assessed spike-triggered events using voltage-sensitive dye imaging (<a href=\"#bib4\">Arieli et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Tsodyks et al., 1999</a>) to encompass a more expansive spatial scale, electrode arrays, awake recordings, and selective genetically encoded indicators of activity. While being important seminal findings (<a href=\"#bib4\">Arieli et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Tsodyks et al., 1999</a>), previous STA work was largely confined to the visual system, performed under anesthesia and was unable to define how collections of brain areas interact. The approach is probably most analogous to event-triggered MRI imaging from the standpoint of larger spatial scale (<a href=\"#bib42\">Logothetis et al., 2012</a>). Interestingly, in this study, it was observed that during hippocampal ripple states that cortex exhibited net positive bold responses and thalamus net negative BOLD responses. This anti-correlated relationship is consistent with some of our observations of thalamic spiking activity corresponding with cortical temporal dynamics exhibiting slow depression of calcium signals and may point to a larger coordinated network involving other brain structures. However, as we did not record simultaneously from hippocampus we cannot definitively comment on whether these observations necessarily correspond to hippocampal ripple events. Furthermore, MRI signals lack temporal resolution and can be more difficult to relate to neuronal activity than GCaMP signals that are isolated within excitatory neurons of GCaMP6f mice using specific promoters (<a href=\"#bib14\">Chen et al., 2013b</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Madisen et al., 2015</a>). Unique to our approach is the power to assess the functional connectivity and temporal dynamics between specific sub-cortical neurons and areas of cortex not predicted by previous knowledge such as linkages between thalamic neurons and cortical state as defined by GCaMP signal dynamics. We anticipate that the approach can be further refined as tools such as more selective cre-dependent CGaMP6f transgenic mice allow for the expression of calcium indicators in particular neuron types (<a href=\"#bib44\">Madisen et al., 2015</a>). Furthermore, two-photon microscopy could be used to provide information about behavior of individual cells within the context of larger maps (<a href=\"#bib13\">Chen et al., 2013a</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Guo et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Okun et al., 2015</a>). Because of the high sensitivity of the indicator and the possibility of measuring the activity of tens of single-units using multiple electrode channels simultaneously, a large number of functional connections can be mapped in only a few minutes of recording. Although we have only used a single electrode shank, we anticipate future applications using higher density electrodes and multiple shanks to collect spikes from more neurons simultaneously."

In contrast, we show that single thalamic neurons tend to fire when cortex is in more kinetically\u00a0diverse states which is dominated by inhibition. The more diverse dynamics between thalamic neurons and cortical mesoscopic networks indicate that sub-cortical thalamic neurons play an instructive role with respect to cortical state, particularly with respect to feedforward cortical inhibition (<a href=\"#bib74\">Stroh et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Urbain et al., 2015</a>), whereas cortical neurons may serve as relay endpoints or amplifiers (<a href=\"#bib20\">Douglas et al., 1995</a>). A better understanding of these dynamics may yield insight into how disorders, such as epilepsy, and dementia, emerge when interactions between brain areas are disrupted (<a href=\"#bib58\">Paz et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Busche et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">McCormick et al., 2015</a>). The diversity in sub-cortical spiking derived maps may also reflect differing receptive field properties in thalamus and cortex based on varying types of functional convergence described previously\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib47\">Miller et al., 2001</a>). Indeed, in the somatosensory whisker barrel system, evidence for \u2018ensemble convergence\u2019 has been described where input from the thalamus can extend outside of the boundaries of the corresponding cortical receptive field (<a href=\"#bib68\">Simons and Carvell, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Linden and Schreiner, 2003</a>). The larger diversity of maps derived from the spiking of different thalamic neurons may be expected because of the smaller size of thalamic nuclei compared to the cortex and the recording of thalamic neurons from more-varied structures. Another potential source of variance may arise from the diversity of thalamocortical impulses that can be comprised of patterns of activity ranging from tonic, 'relay' transmission consisting of high regular rates of firing to burst-like activity where firing rates are low and interspersed with high-frequency events\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib73\">Steriade and Llinas, 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">McCormick and Feeser, 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Sherman and Guillery, 1996</a>). Thalamic bursting can powerfully activate neocortical circuits and has been suggested to serve a \u2018wake-up\u2019 signal to sensory cortices (<a href=\"#bib64\">Sherman and Guillery, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Swadlow and Gusev, 2001</a>). When we segregated our recordings into various firing configurations, we did not observe profound differences in STMs or their temporal dynamics indicating that the averaging methodology is not constrained by a particular firing pattern. However, interpreting these results is caveated by the mesoscale resolution and calcium dynamics present in the recorded data."

Other applications include understanding of how small groups of epileptic neurons (<a href=\"#bib58\">Paz et al., 2013</a>) are coupled to brain networks leading to seizure propagation. Given that reciprocal connections between mesoscale structures are widespread, the cortical maps associated with a spiking neuron in a sub-cortical structure such as the sub-thalamic nucleus may provide clues as to how cortical activity can be manipulated to affect a sub-cortical target. This hypothesis can be tested by recording sub-cortically using electrode arrays, while stimulating regions of cortex that show coincident STMs using Channelrhodopsin-2 or other opsin-activity sensor pairs (<a href=\"#bib40\">Lim et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Rickgauer et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib89\">Zou et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Abdelfattah et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Kim et al., 2016a</a>)."

Slower dynamics are expected given the kinetics of GCaMP6 (<a href=\"#bib14\">Chen et al., 2013b</a>). We have used deconvolution (<a href=\"#bib60\">Pnevmatikakis et al., 2016</a>) to take into consideration the slower kinetics of GCaMP6 and compensate for it. Using this approach, we observed a significant acceleration of raw data but very modest effects on STMTD indicating that STMTD may already be accelerated relative to GCaMP6 kinetics by the statistical nature of spike/Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient temporal convergence. It is also possible that slower dynamics of STMTD reflect sequences of spiking activity propagating through specific polysynaptic circuits. This speculation was supported by the similar time range of STMTD and cue-triggered recall of learned temporal sequences (<a href=\"#bib86\">Xu et al., 2012</a>).

These imaging parameters have been used previously for voltage-sensitive dye imaging (<a href=\"#bib48\">Mohajerani et al., 2013</a>) as well as anesthetized GCaMP3 imaging of spontaneous activity in mouse cortex (<a href=\"#bib82\">Vanni and Murphy, 2014</a>) and awake GCaMP6 imaging in mouse cortex with chronic window (<a href=\"#bib67\">Silasi et al., 2016</a>)."

                                "text": "In some experiments (as indicated), we employed a multi-wavelength strategy to correct for potential green epifluorescence signals that were associated with non-calcium dependent events. We employed a variant of the elegant spectral correction strategy described by others (<a href=\"#bib43\">Ma et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Wekselblatt et al., 2016</a>) that monitor changes in green reflected light near the isobestic point of hemoglobin. This strategy was inspired by previous work using blue excitation/reflected light(<a href=\"#bib69\">Sirotin, 2010</a>). We assume hemoglobin is the primary absorber in brain tissue in vivo and changes in blood volume or oxygenation affect both excitation and emission of light used for wide-field imaging (<a href=\"#bib43\">Ma et al., 2016</a>). Our strategy makes use of short blue wavelength reference light that is also near a hemoglobin isosbestic point. While others have used a strobed LED presentation with a subset of frames providing a green reflected light reference image (<a href=\"#bib43\">Ma et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Wekselblatt et al., 2016</a>), we took advantage of an RGB camera sensor to allow simultaneous acquisition of a shorter wavelength blue\u00a0~447 nm signal that correlates strongly with green reflected light signals. This strategy provides a short blue light reference without the need for strobing which can limit time resolution and potentially entrain some neuronal rhythms (<a href=\"#bib34\">Iaccarino et al., 2016</a>) and is more technically demanding from a hardware synchronization standpoint. Our strategy employs the Raspberry Picam\u2019s RGB sensor (Waveshare Electronics RPi Camera F) to independently resolve signals attributed to blood volume changes as blue reflected light, while simultaneously collecting green epi fluorescence (GCaMP6). We used a Chroma 69013m multi-band filter 10 mm diameter mounted just over the image sensor allowing blue, green, and red signals to be simultaneously obtained in separate channels of the cameras RGB sensor with less than 10% cross talk between channels. We employ 2 Luxeon LEDs: (1) Royal-Blue (447.5 nm) LUXEON Rebel ES LED with added Brightline Semrock 438/24 nm filter to provide a short blue wavelength reflected light signal that is expected to report blood volume changes; (2) a blue 473 nm Luxeon Rebel ES LED for excitation of GCaMP6 with a Chroma 480 nm/30 nm excitation filter. In preliminary analysis, we found that the short blue signal correlated positively with apparent blood volume artifacts that were revealed by parallel experiments using green reflected light imaging (r\u00a0=\u00a00.93, see <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Given that the short-blue reflected light signals provided a surrogate indicator of green reflected light (they are highly positively correlated) we used this in a ratiometric correction strategy. While the shorter blue wavelength light will scatter more than a green strobed reflected light signal used by others (<a href=\"#bib43\">Ma et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Wekselblatt et al., 2016</a>), our analysis of green reflected light and short blue reflected light, indicating that two were highly correlated, suggests that the major artifacts we observe are associated with large blood volume changes in superficial cortical layers."

To identify regions of movement or quietness, the standard deviation of luminance fluctuation was calculated for each pixel. This approach showed that most of the movements were localized on the facial (whisker and jaw) and forepaw regions. A region of interest was manually drawn for each frame and the sum of absolute value of the gradient was calculated by subtracting each frame by their previous within this region. This gradient profile within the region of interest was temporally smoothed at 0.1 Hz, and the median and standard deviation were calculated (\u03c3). Periods of quietness were identified as having a gradient lower than [median+\u03c3/10], while periods of movement were higher than [median+\u03c3]. To more selectively identify periods of quietness isolated from any movement, an exclusion window of 10 s was applied at the beginning and the end of each period of quietness and only periods of more than 10 s were kept. STA was then generated only from spikes for periods of quietness and compared with STA of all spikes."

Our approach was to group single spike motifs by similarity in a high-dimensional space (e.g. 64 \u00d7 64 pixels=4096 dimensions) and removed spontaneous motifs averages that were similar to our groupings to reveal the underlying single cell STM. The first step was to compute distributions of the cortical STMs of all spikes (which have high variability; <a href=\"#fig6s4\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 4A</a>) in a high dimensional space. The lack of obvious clusters indicated that there were no sub-groups of STMs present in the data which are removed by the averaging procedure. We proceeded to group the STM distributions by similarity into four (or more) partitions to reveal active sub-networks present during single spiking (<a href=\"#fig6s4\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 4B</a>). While inter-spike-interval (ISI) distribution were largely similar for the sub-grouped networks (<a href=\"#fig6s4\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 4C</a>) the resulting four sub-networks had substantial diversity indicating that (on averae) spiking occurred during different types of active cortical networks with only one of these sub-networks resembling our all-spike average STM (<a href=\"#fig6s4\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 4D</a>; four sub-network STMs and sum at the bottom). We next identified spontaneous STMs \u2013 that\u00a0is STMs occurring without spiking \u2013 that were most similar to our sub-networks to subtract their contribution and reveal the cell's component STM in the sub-network STMs. We thus grouped spontaneously occurring motifs (<a href=\"#fig6s4\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 4E</a>) into sub-networks similar to spike triggered networks by re-using the spike generated sub-network centres (<a href=\"#fig6s4\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 4B,F</a>). This ensured that the spontaneous sub-networks would be similar to the spike-triggered sub-networks. The resulting spontaneous sub-networks are similar \u2013 but not identical \u2013 to the cell spike triggered sub-networks (<a href=\"#fig6s4\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 4H</a>; note that the sum is mostly noise as expected when summing over all activity). Importantly, when subtracting the spontaneously active sub-network STMs (<a href=\"#fig6s4\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 4H</a>) from the spike-triggered sub-network STMs (<a href=\"#fig6s4\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 4D</a>), we recovered STMs which represented mainly single cell spiking components and were largely similar to the overall average STM. We provide additional examples of this STM partitioning using other cortical and thalamic cells and also an example where we partitioned the STM distribution into 12 sub-networks but still recovered the all-spike average STM from each of the partitioned networks (<a href=\"#fig6s5\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 5</a>)."

Mann-Whitney non-parametric tests were used to compare correlation coefficients between STMs, percentage overlap between STM pairs, and the correlation coefficients between STMs and SPMs. <sup>****</sup> denote p&lt;0.0001. Collection of data and analysis were not performed blind to the nature of the experiment, and there was no randomization of animal groups. STMs included in analyses were generated from a minimum of 200 spikes. Only STMTDs exhibiting fluorescence exceeding 0.5% \u25b3F/F<sub>0</sub> were used for analysis. Sample sizes were not pre-determined but are consistent with previous experiments using similar methodology (<a href=\"#bib48\">Mohajerani et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Vanni and Murphy, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Chan et al., 2015</a>)."

This allows them to form a transfer function of the spatiotemporal patterns in cortex in response to spiking from a single neuron in with cortex or thalamus. These patterns may extend across multiple cortical areas, consistent with long-range connections. Further, they are more robust when derived with respect to cortical versus thalamic spikes. These data provide key, additional evidence for a highly restricted number of patterns generated by cortex, even from \"spontaneous\" activity, compared with the number of neurons in a region of interest."

The reviewers raise excellent issues and I would like the author to respond to all comments. Regarding \"essential\" points, one reoccurring theme that will require additional analysis concerns the averaging. First, it would be very useful to see variance maps as well as average or spike triggered maps (STMs) as an extension of <a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3</a> and <a href=\"#fig4\">4</a>. The two may not be scaled versions of each other if the calcium responses are nonlinear. For that reason, the authors may further consider an analysis of the covariance of the data, as opposed to only the mean, as would reveal properties of \"complex\" versus \"simple\" visual cells. Perhaps this issue is at bay with the thalamic data. An example of how to do this was reviewed in Aljadef et al. (Neuron 2016), where the calcium images would replace the visual stimuli in the analysis."

The first is the important issue of removing potential blood flow contributions, as was done by Chris Niell in a 2016 Journal of Neurophysiology manuscript. This should, ideally, be applied to the present data if at all possible. The second concerns the nature of the STM calculated from temporally isolated spikes versus spikes that are part of a burst. Given the known depression of thalamo-cortical synapses, this could likely contribute the variability of the STM data using thalamic spikes. To address this issue, the thalamic bursts can be isolated from the spike records and, as one possibility, the STM can be computed with respect to only the first spike. Lastly, the \"spontaneous activity\" may currently include sensory-evoked activity from body motion. As the authors recorded body motion, it would be germane to check if \"spontaneous activity\" in fact results from self motion, as this changes the interpretation of \"spontaneous activity' from internally generated to reafferent driven."

For example, seed pixel correlation maps (SPMs) can show the cross-correlation map of the spontaneous activity for a defined seed pixel in the images. In this study, Xiao et al. combined GCaMP imaging of an entire cortex with single neuron electrophysiological recordings, and used the spike-triggered averaging approach to determine the mesoscopic network motif linked to the recorded neurons. The spike trigger averaging approach has already been reported by Grinvald lab (Arieli et al., 1995), and the current study does not provide a new methodological framework. However, combined with state-of-the-art GCaMP imaging, Xiao et al. nicely demonstrates the power of this approach by finding subcortical to cortical network motifs, which have been difficult with optical imaging alone."

However, in GCaMP imaging, single spikes can produce only marginal response changes (\u0394F/F). In addition, a single spike in a single neuron is unlikely to effectively activate all the post-synaptic neurons. Thus, it is possible that multiple-spike events (or bursts) can produce a more reliable STM. The authors could test this possibility by reanalyzing data and the results could be shown as in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C, D</a>."

The current study analyzes such patterns using widefield calcium imaging, selectively in excitatory neurons throughout dorsal cortex \u2013 arguably a useful complementary approach to the aforementioned human work given that calcium signals are more tightly linked to spiking activity. In addition, previous work using hippocampal electrophysiology and fMRI in non-human primates (Logothetis et al., Nature 2012) showed that hippocampal ripple activity during states other than active waking was linked to widespread cortical activation as well as to suppressed activity in subcortical regions (including thalamus), but few studies have taken a similar approach using widefield calcium imaging. The current study uses impressive tools, the combination of which is somewhat novel, to link spiking activity from single cortical and subcortical neurons with widespread GCaMP6 calcium activity during anesthesia and quiet waking. Further, only few studies have performed imaging with such a large field of view (9 mm x 9 mm). In general, the manuscript is well written. The successful collection of these datasets is exciting, and the combination of dense imaging, electrophysiology and behavioral information provides an extremely rich and unique dataset. However, the analyses performed do not effectively extract much of this richness, and do not, in the current form, reveal clearly interpretable insights of broad interest gained by this approach (particularly given the caveats involved in averaging across many neurons). Further, several interpretations of the data are confusing, and some key references require further consideration. These issues are discussed in detail below:"

Further, cortical neurons within S1 are highly correlated, likely more so that nearby neurons in thalamus, further ensuring strong correlation between the cortical spiking activity and the SPM maps (since the seed cortical pixel is likely highly correlated with the cortical single-unit recording), more so that would be likely be possible with most thalamic units). The other suggested explanations for these findings made by the authors in the Discussion are far more speculative, and many would be difficult to test. Further, little effort is made to relate specific thalamic recordings from specific areas to any specific cortical patterns (e.g. did lemniscal thalamic recordings have more similar STMs to SPMs vs non-lemniscal thalamic recordings?). Given that the correlation between cortical neurons and their neighbors is likely very different than the correlation between single thalamic neurons and their neighbors, it might be helpful to compute STMs for multiunit activity in cortex and in thalamus for a given electrode contact, and then subtract a scaled version of this STM from the single unit STM \u2013 that may put the cortical and thalamic analyses on more even footing (all the more true given data in Figure 3Diii). Similar analyses could be done for high-passed LFP or CSD recordings, allowing a better sense of the relationship between a single neuron's spike with network activity, vs. the correlated spiking of that neuron and many nearby neurons. This analysis may also reveal more spatially localized patterns (e.g. for barrel cortex recordings, it might reveal relatively more barrel-specific response profiles). Similarly, for cortical recordings, one could subtract STMs in superficial recordings from STMs with simultaneously recorded neurons in deep layers, thus removing the 'columnar' component of the correlation, and allowing evaluation of residual, layer-specific contributions."

This could very well explain the effects seen in the current <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>, of net suppression in thalamic STMs (at most delays) and net activation for cortical STMs, as it provides evidence that cortical and thalamic neurons are likely anti-correlated during much of spontaneous activity (e.g. during ripple events). It would be worthwhile following this up \u2013 if most spontaneous cortical spiking is ripple-related and involved distributed, correlated cortical patterns, this could also partially explain why cortical STMs look more like SPMs than thalamic SPMs. This is a place where the true level and time course of activity would likely be different if STM analysis methods were used that didn't involve subtraction of GCaMP6 activity in the 3-s window prior to spike onset (see point 3c below)."

(b) the authors suggest using deconvolution of signals as a future direction, but this would seem to be highly useful to use in the present analyses in separating GCaMp6 dynamics from neural dynamics, given the emphasis, in part, on temporal resolution (relative to fMRI). Both points (a) and (b) are effectively addressed in a study that is in some ways quite similar, by Wekselblatt et al., J Neurophys June 2016 -- a paper that is not cited by the authors. In that paper, Wekselblatt et al. nicely show the use of stimulus-evoked widefield GCaMP6 mapping across an intermediate sized cranial window in mice, after deconvolution and removal of vascular signals. (c) Another issue that is difficult to interpret is the normalization of GCaMP6 signal to a window of time prior to spike onset. Clearly this is throwing out a lot of useful information, and may distort much of the information that remains. An alternative approach might be to use a running median subtraction at each pixel, perhaps with removal of any slow drifts over long timescales, which would more effectively reveal what GCaMP6 activity is leading vs. lagging the spiking activity. (d) No discuss of the nature of the spiking activity is presented, yet burst firing (and thus, counting spikes with short ISI as similar to those with long ISI) may also distort the STMs. (e) The cortical delineation of areas is crude, and most secondary areas are not well delineated, making it difficult to assess whether any specific spatial resolution afforded by the technique actually yields insights at the level of specific higher cortical areas. (f): While it is interesting and useful to see that STM patterns become similar after averaging &gt;128 or 256 trials (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>), most of the information in the dataset is lost in this averaging process. Do subsets of spike events share a common spike-triggered pattern, albeit one that is not present on the majority of spike events, and which might be washed out by this averaging?"

We have now implemented a very similar correction to that performed by the Niell lab manuscript (Wekselblatt et al., 2016) and is also similar to work performed by the Hillman lab (Ma et al., 2016). In summary, the Niell lab implemented a strobed light presentation using alternating blue and green lights to capture GCaMP epi-fluorescence (blue illumination) and green reflectance (dim green illumination) in alternating frames. We have used a similar approach but monitor blue reflected light as our reference signal for fluorescence changes due to hemodynamics. We feel that there is some loss of time resolution using the strobed approach and it also depends very strongly on camera timing signals. There is also the issue of the flashing lights potentially stimulating/entraining the animal. Accordingly, we have developed a very similar strategy using a color RGB camera (Picam) (Murphy et al., 2016), which allows simultaneous acquisition of a short blue light reflected signal (447 nm LED and 438/24 nm filter near an isosbestic point for hemoglobin), and a green epi-fluorescence signal (GCaMP). Using the short blue reflected light signal, we now show that 438 nm reflected light is strongly correlated with 532 nm green reflected light in a control experiment (r = 0.93; <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This analysis indicates that short blue reflected light signals can be used as a surrogate for a green reflected signal. Accordingly, we now use the short blue reflected light signal in a division strategy very similar to previous approaches (Sirotin and Das, 2010; Ma et al., 2016; Wekselblatt et al., 2016). The division was performed after both frame-by-frame signals were converted a \u0394F/F<sub>0</sub> and employed a green/blue weight of 1. We have tried weightings than &gt;1.0 for the short blue signal, but found that some aspects of the kinetics were over-corrected. This new analysis dampens non-specific fluctuations associated with blood volume changes, which are aggravated in the awake state. We now show using validation with green light reflection, as well as GFP mice and that our strategy results in a reduction in baseline noise."

We implemented methodology previously described for defining the main spiking modes of a single cell (Sherman and Guillery, 2006; Figure 6.5, pg 236). Briefly, the method requires computing the distribution of each spike\u2019s inter-spike-interval (ISI) between the previous (x-axis) and following (y-axis) spike (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The resulting pre- and post-spike 2D distribution is then plotted using logarithmic scales and naturally arising clusters are grouped or clustered. Spike groups occurring in approximately each quadrant of the plot indicate different spiking modes: first spikes in a burst (bottom right), spiking occurring during a burst (bottom left), last spikes in a burst (top left), and tonic spikes (top right). The vast majority of cortical cells we recorded in barrel cortex did not exhibit multiple classes of spiking modes, however we provide 2 examples where some natural clustering is present (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>(Ai) and (Bi)). The spike sub-groups representing different spiking modes yielded very similar STMs and motifs (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>(Aii) and (Bii)) and similar STMTDs in the area of highest activation, i.e. left barrel cortex (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a> (Aiii) and (Biii)). We also provide examples of two identified thalamic cells which showed more apparent spiking modes (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>(C) and (D)). The thalamic cells we identified showed better bursting versus tonic clusters (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a> (Ci) and (Di)) but much like cortical cells their STM and STMTDs were largely stable across the clustered spiking modes. The 3 cortical and 4 thalamic cells provided in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a> did not exhibit clear spiking modes. For those cells we implemented a simpler methodology and compared all-spike STMs against STMs generated by spikes preceded by at least 500ms of silence as indicative of bursting activity following a period of quiescence (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplements 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s3\">3</a>). Using both of these methodologies to divide spiking times into different modes we found that both STMs and STMTDs across spiking modes are similar to the all-spike average STMs in both cortical and thalamic cells examined."

                    "text": "We additionally sought to determine whether single-spike motifs were similar to each other and formed natural clusters in a high-dimensional representation space. There were no naturally arising clusters suggesting that single spikes occur during many phases of ongoing, i.e. spontaneous, cortical activity. Accordingly, we manually partitioned the motifs into several (4 to 12) groups by similarity and after removing the spontaneous component we were able to recover the all-spike average STMs (<a href=\"#fig6s4\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 4</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s5\">5</a>; see Methods). This single-spike motif sub-grouping suggests that: (i) cells fire during many different ongoing cortical states; and (ii) that despite the high degree of variability single cell spikes appear to correlate with (or possible contribute to) similar overall STM patterns. Given that single spike motifs are very diverse (<a href=\"#fig6s4\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 4</a>(A)) our approach was to project single-spike STMs into a high-dimensional space, compute their distributions and search for clusters or manually partition the resulting distributions. There were no natural groups in the resulting high-dimensional distribution so we partition the data into 4 (or more) sub-groups (<a href=\"#fig6s4\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 4</a>(B), see also <a href=\"#fig6s5\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). The resulting 4 \u201csub-networks\u201d represent (on average) qualitatively different types of ongoing cortical activity during which our cell fires action potentials. While these partitions were manually created, we were interested in determining whether they could generate STMs that resembled all-spike average STMs and whether this was independent of the number of partitions. The 4 partitions chosen generated somewhat different STMs, only one of which strongly resembled our all-spike average STM (<a href=\"#fig6s4\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 4</a>(D); all spike average is bottom STM). The inter-spike-interval (ISI) distributions during activation of these sub-networks is also similar across all partitions further suggesting that this partitioning method did not identify highly bursting or tonic periods of activity (<a href=\"#fig6s4\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 4</a>(C)). Because we had enforced a manual STM-space partition, our resulting sub-network STM averages contained an offset that essentially represented ongoing \u201cspontaneous\u201d cortical activity particular to each STM-space partition. Accordingly, we sought to remove this spontaneous component by carrying out the same partitioning method \u2013 but this time on spontaneous activity (i.e. not using single spike triggers). The distribution of spontaneous STMs (i.e. ongoing STMs not related to our cell spiking) also have substantial variability (<a href=\"#fig6s4\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 4</a>(E)). We next projected all spontaneous motifs into an STM-space but partitioned this space based on the sub-network centres derived previously (<a href=\"#fig6s4\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 4</a>(B) and (D)). This guaranteed that the 4 STMs derived from spontaneous activity would be the closest to our spike-triggered STMs. The spontaneous activity motifs showed a very strong ISI distributions peak at ~33ms (i.e. single-frame time) (<a href=\"#fig6s4\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 4</a>(G)) indicating that STMs that were neighbouring in time (i.e. separated by single frames) were substantially more likely to be in the same region of STM-space and to be grouped together. This is expected as transitions meso-scale cortical dynamics usually last several frames at our 30Hz sampling rate. The sum of the 4 spontaneous STMs yield an STM with an approximately 0% \u0394F/F<sub>0</sub> value \u2013 which is expected when averaging all spontaneous motifs (or frames) during a recording (<a href=\"#fig6s4\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 4</a>(H) bottom STM). The last step is to remove the spontaneously activity STMs (<a href=\"#fig6s4\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 4</a>(H)) from the single cell spike-triggered sub-networks (<a href=\"#fig6s4\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 4</a>(D)). The results reveal that the 4 partition STMs reduce to the all spike average STMs. This analysis supports the averaging method of computing STMs: despite firing during different types of cortical dynamics, single cells contribute to \u2013 and participate in \u2013 ongoing dynamics in a stereotyped way that is represented by the all-spike STM average."

Further, cortical neurons within S1 are highly correlated, likely more so that nearby neurons in thalamus, further ensuring strong correlation between the cortical spiking activity and the SPM maps (since the seed cortical pixel is likely highly correlated with the cortical single-unit recording), more so that would be likely be possible with most thalamic units). The other suggested explanations for these findings made by the authors in the Discussion are far more speculative, and many would be difficult to test. Further, little effort is made to relate specific thalamic recordings from specific areas to any specific cortical patterns (e.g. did lemniscal thalamic recordings have more similar STMs to SPMs vs non-lemniscal thalamic recordings?). Given that the correlation between cortical neurons and their neighbors is likely very different than the correlation between single thalamic neurons and their neighbors, it might be helpful to compute STMs for multiunit activity in cortex and in thalamus for a given electrode contact, and then subtract a scaled version of this STM from the single unit STM \u2013 that may put the cortical and thalamic analyses on more even footing (all the more true given data in Figure 3Diii). Similar analyses could be done for high-passed LFP or CSD recordings, allowing a better sense of the relationship between a single neuron's spike with network activity, vs. the correlated spiking of that neuron and many nearby neurons. This analysis may also reveal more spatially localized patterns (e.g. for barrel cortex recordings, it might reveal relatively more barrel-specific response profiles). Similarly, for cortical recordings, one could subtract STMs in superficial recordings from STMs with simultaneously recorded neurons in deep layers, thus removing the 'columnar' component of the correlation, and allowing evaluation of residual, layer-specific contributions.</i>"

They acknowledge our discussion points, including diversity being attributed to the physical layout of the thalamus versus cortex and the ability to record from potentially more diverse neurons in the thalamus given the relatively smaller structure over which things are mapped. Accordingly, they suggest experiments to place subcortical thalamic neurons on more even footing with cortical neurons. These include making a spike-triggered single cortical neuron map in which multi-unit activity or LFP-triggered activity has been subtracted away. This would potentially allow the contributions of individual cortical neurons to be more easily seen."

We also computed band-passed LFP triggered STMs for Delta (0.1-4Hz), Theta (4-8Hz) and Gamma (25-100Hz). LFP triggered STMs were computed using 60 second periods by multiplying the average LFP amplitude in each imaging time frame. Thus, imaging frames where the average LFP amplitude was large and positive contributed substantially to the STM, whereas frames where the average LFP values were closer to zero did not (negative LFP values were clipped). The findings for both cortical and subcortical recordings are that MUA triggered STMs are similar to single-unit STMs in cortex while LFP triggered STMs \u2013 representing mostly synaptic and some spiking activity, were substantially different from single cell and MUA triggered STMs and across different LFP frequency bands. However, it is important to note that LFP amplitude (or power-) -triggered maps have very low \u0394F/F values, for example most have peak \u0394F/F values &lt; 0.05% (whereas single-unit or MUA peaks are between 1%-5%). Nonetheless, cortical LFP triggered maps do reveal anatomically discrete maps (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). However, while there appear to be some slight differences across layers, the differences do not appear to be substantial or systematic. It is likely that as LFP contains mostly synaptic and some spiking activity from within a region with radius of at least 250\u03bcm (Buzsaki et al., 2012) the STMs may represent average activity from larger neighbouring regions thus blurring the overall effect of local LFP activity."

This is due to the similarities between single-unit and MUA STMs before subtraction. However, we agree overall that this general direction could be pursued further in future work to determine whether the limit of the GCaMP temporal and spatial resolution allows for more nuanced single-unit STMs to be obtained by removing common baselines."

This could very well explain the effects seen in the current <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>, of net suppression in thalamic STMs (at most delays) and net activation for cortical STMs, as it provides evidence that cortical and thalamic neurons are likely anticorrelated during much of spontaneous activity (e.g. during ripple events). It would be worthwhile following this up \u2013 if most spontaneous cortical spiking is ripple-related and involved distributed, correlated cortical patterns, this could also partially explain why cortical STMs look more like SPMs than thalamic SPMs. This is a place where the true level and timecourse of activity would likely be different if STM analysis methods were used that didn't involve subtraction of GCaMP6 activity in the 3-s window prior to spike onset (see point 3c below).</i>"
