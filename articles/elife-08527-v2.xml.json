Here, using novel culturing and computational methods as well as latest analytical techniques, we mapped the proteome and transcriptome during the replicative lifespan of budding yeast. With age, we found primarily proteins involved in protein biogenesis to increase relative to their transcript levels. Exploiting the dynamic nature of our data, we reconstructed high-level directional networks, where we found the same protein biogenesis-related genes to have the strongest ability to predict the behavior of other genes in the system. We identified metabolic shifts and the loss of stoichiometry in protein complexes as being consequences of aging. We propose a model whereby the uncoupling of protein levels of biogenesis-related genes from their transcript levels is causal for the changes occurring in aging yeast. Our model explains why targeting protein synthesis, or repairing the downstream consequences, can serve as interventions in aging."

Here, using novel culturing and computational methods as well as latest analytical techniques, we mapped the proteome and transcriptome during the replicative lifespan of budding yeast. With age, we found primarily proteins involved in protein biogenesis to increase relative to their transcript levels. Exploiting the dynamic nature of our data, we reconstructed high-level directional networks, where we found the same protein biogenesis-related genes to have the strongest ability to predict the behavior of other genes in the system. We identified metabolic shifts and the loss of stoichiometry in protein complexes as being consequences of aging. We propose a model whereby the uncoupling of protein levels of biogenesis-related genes from their transcript levels is causal for the changes occurring in aging yeast. Our model explains why targeting protein synthesis, or repairing the downstream consequences, can serve as interventions in aging."

Although many genes that influence aging have been found, all the generated knowledge is still rather fragmented. It also remains difficult to disentangle cause and consequence. That is to say, sometimes a gene that looks like it might cause aging could simply be a gene that responds to an age related phenomenon. To unravel this puzzle of cause and effect, it is necessary to first get an idea on a system level of everything that changes as an organism ages."

The work first involved developing a new way of growing baker\u2019s yeast to keep and generate large cohorts of aging yeast cells in a constant environment. It also required the use of a mathematical \u2018un-mixing\u2019 tool to separate the data obtained from the aging cohort from the data from the young offspring that the yeast produce while they age."

The \u201ctranscriptome\u201d refers to the collection of RNA molecules in the cell, which are produced whenever a gene is expressed. The \u201cproteome\u201d refers to all the proteins in the cell, which are translated from the RNA transcripts by the cell\u2019s so-called \u201ctranslational machinery\u201d. These experiments revealed that this yeast\u2019s proteome reflects its transcriptome less and less as it ages. In particular, this \u2018uncoupling\u2019 of the proteome from the transcriptome was seen most strongly for the proteins related to the cell\u2019s translational machinery; these proteins accumulated with age relative to their transcripts."

Understanding its driving force is the required step towards enabling interventions that might delay age-related disorders (<a href=\"#bib44\">de Magalh\u00e3es et al., 2012</a>). While this remains an unsolved problem in biology (<a href=\"#bib46\">Medawar, 1952</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Mccormick and Kennedy, 2012</a>), significant advances in the field have shown the process of aging to be malleable at both the genetic and environmental levels, indicating that it is possible for its causal elements to be dissected. The rate of aging, however, is influenced by diverse factors, including protein translation, protein quality control, mitochondrial dysfunction, and metabolism (<a href=\"#bib33\">Kennedy and Kaeberlein, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Webb and Brunet, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Lagouge and Larsson, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Barzilai et al., 2012</a>).

Significant contributions towards global mapping of the aging process have been demonstrated through transcriptome studies (<a href=\"#bib11\">Egilmez et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Lin et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Lesur and Campbell, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Koc et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Yiu et al., 2008</a>) and genome-wide single-gene deletion lifespan measurements (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib45\">Mccormick and Kennedy, 2012</a>). However, a major task remains to comprehensively describe the molecular changes that accompany the aging process. As the exponential increase in daughter cells represents a major challenge in terms of generating sufficient numbers of aged cells, to date no comprehensive description of the changes on both the proteome and transcriptome level has been provided. Assuming that the molecular changes occurring along the replicative lifespan of yeast are, in part, responsible for its decreased viability that occurs over time, we reason that revealing the dynamic and interdependent changes that accompany this process would allow us to distinguish cause from consequence in aging."

Applying next-generation RNA sequencing and shotgun proteomics, we mapped the molecular phenotypes of aging yeast cells at 12 time points, well into advanced age where the majority of cells had died due to aging. Analysis of these dynamic and comprehensive datasets allowed us to identify a general uncoupling of protein levels from their corresponding messenger RNA (mRNA) levels. This uncoupling was most apparent in protein biogenesis-related proteins, which we found over-represented relative to their transcripts. Using computational network-based inference methods, we found that changes in these genes had the strongest ability to predict the behavior of other genes, thereby suggesting their causal role in replicatively aging yeast. On the basis of these analyses, we provide a systems-level model of aging unifying and integrating diverse observations made within the field."

This starting cohort of mother cells was put into a column containing stainless steel mesh that was positioned within a magnetic field (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The daughter cells do not inherit the iron beads, as the yeast cell wall remains with the mother during mitosis (<a href=\"#bib56\">Smeal et al., 1996</a>). By running a constant flow of medium through the column, we washed away the majority of emerging daughter cells. The flowing medium also provided fresh nutrients and oxygen and ensured constant culture conditions, as confirmed for pH, glucose, and oxygen levels (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A\u2013C</a>). By maintaining multiple columns simultaneously, we could harvest cells from the same starting cohort at different time points and thus at different replicative ages (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2D</a>). Because we could retain up to 10<sup>9</sup> mother cells per column (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), we could produce sufficient numbers of aged cells for performing parallel proteome and transcriptome analyses. Computer simulations showed that the age distribution broadened over time (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4A,B</a>). The broadened age distribution results in a lower resolution making detecting the actual changes occurring at later time points more difficult, and we therefore harvested cells at exponentially increasing time intervals to maximize the differences between time points at later ages."

Avidin-fluorescein isothiocyanate (AvF) binding to the biotin-labeled cells distinguished the starting cohort of mother cells from daughter cells (<a href=\"#fig1s5\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5A</a>). Dead cells were identified using propidium iodide (PI), which fluoresces upon intercalating with the DNA of membrane-permeable dead cells (<a href=\"#fig1s5\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5A</a>). These two assays were used to determine the fractions of daughters, mothers, and dead cells in a population (<a href=\"#fig1s5\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5B</a>). From this data, we derived the viability of the mother cells over time, which we found to be in excellent agreement with the lifespan curve of yeast as observed in a microfluidic device (<a href=\"#bib23\">Huberts et al., 2014)</a> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Using the forward scatter of the flow cytometer as a rough proxy for cell size, we could qualitatively observe the cell size increase of live mothers that is known to occur in aging mother cells (<a href=\"#bib12\">Egilmez et al., 1990</a>)\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Similarly, using fluorophore-conjugated wheat-germ agglutinin, which labels bud scars that appear after every division (<a href=\"#bib52\">Powell et al., 2003</a>), we observed an increase of bud scar staining on mother cells in the column, as also visualized by confocal microscopy (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2D</a>). These analyses confirmed known changes that characterize aging yeast: increased cell size and bud scars, and decreased population viability (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B\u2013C</a>)."

The approach exploits the fact that a system of linear equations can be solved when the number of unknowns equals the number of independent equations. Specifically, while we could determine the number of mothers, daughters, and dead cells in a sample using flow cytometry, the contribution of each type of cells to the measured abundance of a particular protein or transcript was unknown. Therefore, by measuring protein and transcript abundances in three mixed samples with various proportions of mothers, daughters, and dead cells, we could mathematically un-mix the abundances. This resulted in un-mixed data for the aging mother cells. Experiments using samples containing mixed cell populations with known molecular phenotypes validated this mathematical un-mixing method for the RNA sequencing (RNAseq) transcriptome, targeted (selected reaction monitoring) proteome, and global (shotgun) proteome data with a &lt;16% average error (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s2\">2</a>; <a href=\"#SD8-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>)."

One sample was collected from the column effluent (Mix 3, mainly daughter cells). Harvesting all cells from the column and applying a further enrichment step on a larger magnet produced the two other samples: one sample contained mainly aged mother cells (Mix 2, 80\u201399% mothers), while the other contained an intermediate composition compared to Mixes 2 and 3 (wash fraction, Mix 1). In each of these mixed-cell samples, we determined the fraction of mothers, daughters, and dead cells and generated the mixed-population proteomes and transcriptomes. Then, we mathematically un-mixed the proteomes and transcriptomes to obtain the molecular phenotype of aging mother cells. The data was corrected for sampling artefacts related to bead labeling and cell harvesting (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a>;\u00a0supplemental notes 2 and 3 in <a href=\"#SD8-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>).

(<b><b>A</b></b>) Samples generated at different steps during biotinylation, bead labeling, and harvesting were assessed for their similarity to a sample that has undergone all processing steps (sample D), as would the starting (bead labeled) sample of the experiment. Using targeted (SRM) proteomics focusing on 74 proteins known to be either strongly affected or not affected when comparing a processed to an unprocessed sample, we found that the presence of beads alone within a sample (sample G) was enough to match the starting bead-labeled sample (sample D). The process of bead labeling itself (sample \u2018H\u2019, where bead labeling conditions were mimicked) yielded proteomes that bore little resemblance to our bead-containing samples. (<b><b>B</b></b>) Cells and bead counts from flow cytometry. A cohort of 4.0\u00d710<sup>8</sup> cells (pink bar, left) was labeled with beads, by adding a known number of beads (4.8\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>8</sup> beads, pink bar , right ). The number of beads attached to a biotinylated cell population (1.2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>8</sup>) is the difference between free beads before (4.8\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>8</sup> beads, pink bar, right) and after bead\u00a0labeling (3.6\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>8</sup> cells, gray bar, right). The number of cells with at least one bead was counted after bead labeling and cell enrichment on a magnet (after bead labeling, 1.2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>8</sup>, gray bar, left). The yield was\u00a0on average 1.1 beads/cell. (<b><b>C</b></b>) The number of free beads and beads attached to the cells was determined for each sample with flow cytometry. The ratio of bead to cells increased maximally two\u00a0fold in both replicates, most likely due to the detachment of cells from beads while being cultivated in the aging columns. (<b><b>D</b></b>) To study the effect of a small increase in bead concentration per sample we mixed unprocessed cells with different numbers of beads and performed targeted (selected reaction monitoring\u00a0[SRM]) proteomics, using the same 74 proteins for assessment. The median of the measured peak intensities decreased with an increase of beads per sample, indicating a loss of proteins. (<b><b>E</b></b>) Nonetheless, we found that varying the amount of beads in the sample in the range relevant to the aging experiment, did not alter the degree to which the sample was changed by the presence of the beads. The Pearson correlation of these samples to the standard (1.06 beads/cell) was higher than the correlation between two replicates of the standard. We conclude that the bead effect is highly reproducible, and can be redressed with a correction factor specific to each protein (See <a href=\"#SD8-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>)."

Up to 16 columns could be run simultaneously (cartoon of red magnet with column) and harvested throughout the aging procedure (cartoon of lifespan curve, fraction surviving at each age). Time points were exponentially spaced, and covered by two partially overlapping replicate campaigns (R1 and R2, dots showing time points), of 14 and 8 time points, respectively. For each time point, either two or three samples were required for mathematical un-mixing of the population, that is, early time points (blue dots), contained mainly live mother and daughter cells, without mortality in the population, and therefore required only two samples for the mathematical un-mixing of two unknowns. While later time points (red dots), contained increasing levels of dead cells, and required three samples for the mathematical un-mixing of three unknowns. Replicate 1 consisted of an unprocessed sample, five time points requiring two samples for un-mixing, and 9 time points requiring three samples for un-mixing, totaling 38 samples. Replicate 2 had in the same way 23 samples, and together the two replicates consisted of 61 samples, which were processed with shotgun proteomics and RNA sequencing\u00a0(RNAseq) transcriptomics. After \u2018omics\u2019 data was collected, a bead correction was applied to proteome data coming from samples containing beads (see methods), and quality assessment of sequencing data removed four sets of samples from the transcriptome (see methods). The subsequent 61 proteome samples and 50 transcriptome samples were used for mathematical un-mixing, which resulted in mother-specific data for the proteome (R1, 15 time points, and R2, 9 time points) and transcriptome (R1, 12 time points, R2, 8 time points). Corresponding daughter-specific data also resulted from the un-mixing procedure (not depicted in schematic). Finally, a reference time point was selected (7.8 hr, see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods) and the replicate datasets were merged to produce a single time series, for each of the proteome and transcriptome, spanning 12 time points throughout the replicative lifespan of the cells."

Specifically, we see protein levels of the stress-related chaperone Hsp104 and the translation elongation factor Tef1 to increase with aging as was shown using a microfluidic platform tracking single cells [<a href=\"#bib65\">Zhang et al., 2012</a>]. Using another microfluidic platform and green fluorescent protein\u00a0(GFP)-tagged Vph1 protein as a marker for the vacuole, it was found that the vacuole increased in size more rapidly than the cell itself, suggesting a net increase of Vph1 protein levels to occur in the aging cell [<a href=\"#bib38\">Lee et al., 2012</a>]. Our data shows Vph1 levels to increase with aging, in line with these observations. Furthermore, our proteome also captures the subtle changes described to occur with the Tpo1 protein and aging, where a computational model based on production and inheritance of the protein throughout aging predicted Tpo1 levels to initially increase and then gradually decrease with age [<a href=\"#bib13\">Eldakak et al., 2010</a>]. A recent study looking at protein abundances in young and old whole-cell extracts found that levels of the nucleoporins Nup116 and Nsp1 decrease with age, while Nup100 and Nup53 did not change significantly [<a href=\"#bib42\">Lord et al., 2015</a>], and for one other nucleoporin, Nup170, was shown that the levels increase with aging [<a href=\"#bib10\">Denoth-Lippuner et al., 2014</a>], which we all also detect in our proteome data (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). Three proteins whose overexpression results in extended lifespan in yeast, Ras2 [<a href=\"#bib58\">Sun et al., 1994</a>], Mxr1 [<a href=\"#bib34\">Koc et al., 2004</a>], and Vma1 [<a href=\"#bib24\">Hughes and Gottschling, 2012</a>] were observed to decrease with age.

To compare the changes between the proteome and transcriptome, we determined the non-parametric Spearman rank correlation, and found a starting correlation of 0.75, a value in agreement with other single-study comparisons between yeast proteomes and transcriptomes (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cs\u00e1rdi et al., 2015</a>). When comparing this correlation in time, however, we found that it declined steadily with age, down to a correlation of 0.70 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). This decreasing trend was observed regardless of the statistical method used (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Furthermore, this trend is also not an experimental artefact, since samples originating from all time points were treated identically, and both proteome and transcriptome datasets originated from the same biological samples. The decrease in correlation between the proteome and transcriptome means that they do not change synchronously. Indeed, during aging, we found different Gene Ontology (GO) terms to describe the changes in the proteins and transcripts that show a larger than two-fold change during aging (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a> vs. <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>).

In contrast, the expression of gene products in quadrants 2 (Q2) and 4 (Q4) were \u2018uncoupled\u2019, meaning that the changes in protein levels did not follow the changes in transcript levels. In Q2, the proteins were over-represented relative to their transcripts, that is, there were more proteins per transcript in older cells than in younger cells.

Therefore, we defined each transcript\u2019s expression profile as a network node, and an edge between each pair of nodes as a partial correlation between the nodes\u2019 expression profiles (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B and C</a>). Next, we determined the directionality of the edges, indicated by arrows. We defined directionality to represent the ability of a transcript\u2019s profile to predict the profile of another transcript. Concretely, when looking at two connected nodes, the node that could be explained by the connected node was considered as the responsive node, while the predicting node was considered to be the causal node (<a href=\"#bib50\">Opgen-Rhein and Strimmer, 2007</a>)\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1D and E</a>). This relation defined the directionality of the edge. Any transcript that had no predictive ability and could not be predicted by any other transcript was removed from the network analysis. Following this, the nodes were clustered by maximizing the global modularity of the network (<a href=\"#bib6\">Csardi and Nepusz, 2006</a>) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Finally, the clusters were ranked based on the ratio of causal (outward arrows) to responsive nodes (inward arrows) per cluster to determine the higher-level causal relations existing between clusters. A sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the optimal sparsity of the network and the cut-off for the partial correlation among transcript profiles, through which we established that the network was a robust representation of the datasets (supplemental note 4 in <a href=\"#SD8-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>, Table S7, <a href=\"#SD7-data\">Figure 6\u2013source data 1</a>).

First, only nodes that have related gene profiles (based on partial correlations), as distinguished from all indirectly related gene profiles (based on simple correlations), are connected in the network (see <b>B</b> below). Second, the directionality of the arrows between two nodes was found by accounting for the relative reduction in the variability between the nodes. This revealed a causal relationship (see <b>D</b> below). Third, highly interconnected nodes were clustered. Finally, based on the clusters and the average directionality among the clusters, a high-level directional network was generated. For further details regarding these steps, see\u00a0below\u00a0and supplemental note 4. (<b><b>B</b></b>) A simulated example to highlight the first step in (<b><b>A</b></b>), showing that the edge between nodes in the network depends on the partial correlation between the gene profiles. Two transcript profiles (\u2018y\u2019 and \u2018z\u2019) were based on a computationally generated transcript profile (\u2018x\u2019), forming a small artificial network with edges between the nodes x and y in addition to x and z. While the simple correlations between all profiles are high (&gt;0.995), the partial correlations are only high for x with y and x with z (grey dashed lines). Therefore, actual relations were only found from x to z and x to y (black edge). We can thus retrieve the true network, by making use of the partial correlations. (<b><b>C</b></b>) The undirected network for the transcriptome data. The edges between the nodes indicate only actual relations (based on partial correlations) between transcript profiles. All edges connected without partial correlations or nodes linked to the dataset without a partial correlation are omitted in this network. (<b><b>D</b></b>) An example to highlight the second step in (<b><b>A</b></b>) that the directionality between two transcript profiles was found by multiple testing of the standardized partial variances of the nodes. The standardized partial variances are the variances once the effect of the related profiles has been removed by regression analysis. For each of the connected node pairs (e.g. \u2018m\u2019 and \u2018n\u2019), the direction goes from the profile with the highest standardized partial variance to the lowest. Basically, for a profile with a lower standardized partial variance, much of its variability is explained by the profiles connected to it, while for a profile with a high standardized partial variance, less of its variability is explained by the profiles associated to it. The latter profile has thus a higher ability to predict the first one than vice versa, and makes a profile with high standardized variance causal over a profile with a low standardized variance. The directionality is indicated as an arrow between the nodes. (<b><b>E</b></b>) The directed network for the transcriptome data. The arrowhead is pointing to the responsive node. For the clustered directed network see <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a> and for the high level directional network see <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>."

The most causal cluster of the proteome network was enriched for chaperone proteins, reflecting a cellular response to internally changing conditions. Such conditions could include metabolic restructuring in response to an increased cell size or to aggregating proteins that are accumulating due to altered protein complex stoichiometry. Furthermore, we found that the causal clusters of the proteome network tended to be expressed according to their transcriptional message (i.e. coupled expression; Q1, Q3), while the responsive clusters represented increasingly uncoupled expression (Q2, Q4) (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>). This both confirmed the response of the cell to the accumulating changes occurring during aging and indicated that the effects of uncoupled protein expression are progressive over time. We see the clear downstream consequences during aging emerging in the proteome, including metabolic shifts, stoichiometric loss, aggregating proteins, and protein overproduction. All of these point to pathways and processes that may become dysfunctional with aging, any of which may ultimately result in cell death."

Furthermore, the dynamic nature of the data allowed us to pinpoint the transcripts of these genes as having the strongest ability to predict the behavior of others transcripts during aging (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>).

The model proposes that proteins of the translation machinery that are uncoupled from transcript levels accumulate in cells with age (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). As the biogenesis genes are themselves involved in translation, their uncoupling might contribute to further uncoupling of the proteome from the transcriptome as a whole. This general uncoupling has degenerative effects (i.e. cell size increase, protein aggregations and loss of stoichiometry in protein complexes), that stimulate transcriptional responses in the cell (i.e. metabolic changes and activated stress responses), which further contributes to changes in the proteome. Although we cannot exclude the possibility of other causes even further upstream, the uncoupling of the protein biogenesis machinery is likely an early driver of replicative aging in yeast."

Ribosome footprinting has shown these proteins to be highly translated (<a href=\"#bib25\">Ingolia et al., 2009</a>), and protein\u00a0turnover experiments have shown them to be highly stable (<a href=\"#bib2\">Belle et al., 2006</a>); thus, it is possible that their overabundance may result from the combination of the dynamics of protein biogenesis, protein turnover, and mRNA stability. Interestingly, the ribosomal proteins themselves showed a low degree of loss of stoichiometry at the protein\u00a0complex level in our data (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>), supporting the idea that they are still active and contributing to uncoupling in the cell. In any case, the uncoupling of protein and transcript levels has downstream consequences for the cell that may explain many phenotypes of aging. First, cell size may increase due to protein overproduction and result in metabolic changes. Second, proteins being overproduced at different rates will alter protein complex stoichiometry. Many documented phenotypes of aging may result from this, including the formation of protein aggregates (<a href=\"#bib14\">Erjavec et al., 2007</a>), increased reactive oxygen species formation by a dysfunctional mitochondrial transport chain (<a href=\"#bib37\">Laun et al., 2001</a>), and loss of gene silencing (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hu et al., 2014</a>). The sum of these may ultimately lead to system failure for the organism."

Our model predicts that a more robust extension of lifespan may be possible in many organisms by targeting the causal factor in aging, protein biogenesis. Indeed, altering the rates of protein production (i.e. translation) or degradation (i.e. autophagy) have repeatedly been shown to influence longevity across a wide range of organisms (see (<a href=\"#bib61\">Wasko and Kaeberlein, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Johnson et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Cuervo, 2008</a>). The translation activators, target of rapamycin\u00a0(TOR)\u00a0and S6 kinase, fall into this category, and decreases in their activity result in increased lifespan in yeast (<a href=\"#bib16\">Fabrizio et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Kaeberlein et al., 2005</a>), worms (<a href=\"#bib59\">Vellai et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Pan et al., 2007</a>), flies (<a href=\"#bib31\">Kapahi et al., 2004</a>), and mice (<a href=\"#bib36\">Lamming et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Selman et al., 2009</a>), as does calorie restriction and drugs such as rapamycin, which are also modulators of protein biogenesis pathways (<a href=\"#bib28\">Johnson et al., 2013</a>).

There is cell-to-cell variation in the replication rates of yeast and so, with time, the distribution of replicative ages per sample increases. These distributions were modeled based on the variation of the replication rates as quantified from single cell microfluidic data (unpublished data). In a mathematical model, a start culture of 1000 cells having a random replication rate, according to a Poisson distribution an average replication rate of 0.5\u00a0hr<sup>\u22121</sup>, was allowed to replicate (and age) (<a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4</a>).

Following the un-mixing of the data, should the resulting data contained \u2018unsolvable\u2019 entries (see supplemental note 1 in <a href=\"#SD8-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>), a data quality criteria was applied: at least five time points per time trace (0\u201372 hr) should be solvable, otherwise the protein or transcript was removed from the dataset. In cases that passed this criteria but still contained one or more unsolvable entries in the time series, the missing data was linearly interpolated by the time points neighboring the data in question using the \u2018approx\u2019 interpolation function in R, implemented by the zoo package (<a href=\"#bib64\">Zeileis and Grothendieck, 2005</a>). Datasets were subsequently normalized to 1 million for both the shotgun proteomes and transcriptomes."

A representative naming for the enrichment was selected after evaluation of the annotation cluster's GO terms (see <a href=\"#SD6-data\">Figure 3\u2013source data 1</a> ,Table S6).

Briefly, these were: (i) Starting from the replicate datasets, the gene expression time series of both the transcriptome and proteome were filtered to remove flat and/or noisy profiles using the R package GPREGE (<a href=\"#bib64\">Zeileis and Grothendieck, 2005</a>). (ii) The gene product networks (i.e transcriptome or proteome) were generated, based on the gene profiles of the respective time course datasets, using the R package GeneNet (<a href=\"#bib50\">Opgen-Rhein and Strimmer, 2007</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib26\">Schaefer et al., 2015</a>). This included generating an undirected network by calculating the partial correlation among gene profiles (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B and C</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 4A</a>). (iii) Following this, a directed network was generated from the undirected network, based on an assessment of a gene profile\u2019s ability to predict another gene profile (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1D and E</a>, <a href=\"#fig7s4\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 4A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib50\">Opgen-Rhein and Strimmer, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Schaefer et al., 2015</a>). (iv) The nodes in the network were clustered together, using the method in (<a href=\"#bib44\">de Magalh\u00e3es et al., 2012</a>) using the R package igraph (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>, <a href=\"#fig7s4\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 4A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cs\u00e1rdi et al., 2015</a>). The causal in/out connections among genes were calculated for all the network clusters and listed in a direction matrix (listed in <a href=\"#SD7-data\">Figure 6\u2014source data 1</a> Table S7). (v) A high-level directional network was generated, where the clusters were plotted in the order of their causal ranking by drawing the direction matrix as arrows between the clusters. (vi). A sensitivity analysis was made to determine the optimal sparsity of the networks and the cut-off for the partial correlation among gene profiles."

Put another way, in a sense, this method is selecting for long-lived cells and thus, some of the changes could reflect beneficial changes rather than deleterious ones, which is why those cells are still alive after so many replications. For example, transcriptional inhibition of biogenesis genes is a major aspect of the general stress response (which has been observed in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>) that promotes longevity. Is it possible that these long-lived cells are a subpopulation with very high stress response levels and the method is biased toward these responses?"

They then immediately claim in the subsection \u201cNewtwork interference identifies protein biogenesis related genes as casual in yeast aging\u201d that \"Taken together, as the biogenesis transcripts were the most predictive of all the changes we measured, our analyses support a model whereby the uncoupling of protein levels of biogenesis-related genes from their transcript levels is causal for the changes occurring in aging yeast\". We think the authors need to better explain their reasoning here, because it is a key claim in the paper. Specifically, we would like to understand the following: (a) Is the decoupling of protein levels from transcript levels of biogenesis genes the causal factor for the transcriptiome changes, or the changes of both transcriptome and proteome, or their global decoupling during aging? (b) What is the mechanism for the decoupling to cause transcriptome changes, since it appears that the authors came up with this claim from their transcriptional network analysis? (c) If the authors want to claim that the decoupling of protein levels from transcript levels of biogenesis genes can cause the global decoupling of the proteome and transcriptome during aging (with which we are totally fine), then the best evidence would seem to arise from a similar network analysis for the decoupled time series of the decoupled genes (Q2 and Q4 in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). The network correlation analysis of the transcriptome in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> seems less than ideal in supporting this claim. To summarize this point, the authors present very rich and impressive data, but we believe that they need to be more specific about what they mean in order to draw such strong conclusions. A titrated summary would be sufficiently interesting: The decoupling of biogenesis protein levels from their transcript levels through some early-life molecular regulation (e.g. a general stress response?) can drive the global decoupling of the proteome and transcriptome, which is a consequence of aging and an important molecular phenotype of aged cells. Here, the overabundance of biogenesis genes is an early event driving a specific molecular consequence of aging, rather than the cause of all the transcriptome and proteome changes during aging.</i>"

We agree that in the prior version of the manuscript we made at a too early stage statements that rather belong to a discussion. Accordingly, we have toned down the bold statements in the Results section, and instead we have expanded the Discussion. Here, we elaborate on the reviewer\u2019s question, showing how it may be the case that the decoupling of protein levels from transcript levels of biogenesis genes (specifically) is causal in aging. We now make clear that we propose a model that is up for discussion: The model suggests that translation machinery can accumulate in young age (specifically decoupling the translation machinery\u2019s proteins from transcripts, seen in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>), further contributing to decoupling of the proteome from the transcriptome as a whole (since the translation machinery accounts for protein abundances, seen in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>), and finally causing transcriptional responses in the cell (seen as responsive clusters in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>, and protein complex deregulation in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). Furthermore, we acknowledge the possibility that causes upstream of the translation machinery may still be contributing to aging, which is also covered in the expanded Discussion. We hope that with these adjustments we have adequately addressed this comment of the reviewer."

Is it possible that since the majority of cells have died, some of the observed proteomic/transcriptomic changes could actually be conducive towards halting aging rather than driving it? Put another way, in a sense, this method is selecting for long-lived cells and thus, some of the changes could reflect beneficial changes rather than deleterious ones, which is why those cells are still alive after so many replications. For example, transcriptional inhibition of biogenesis genes is a major aspect of the general stress response (which has been observed in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>) that promotes longevity. Is it possible that these long-lived cells are a subpopulation with very high stress response levels and the method is biased toward these responses?</i>"

If this were the case, this would indeed be an important concern. Notably, this is an inherent problem to all population-level yeast aging studies. The best evidence against it, which we have described in the revised manuscript, is the validation of the protein abundance changes we measured with independent experiments. Specifically, when we compared single cell data obtained with GFP-tagged strains analyzed in microfluidic chips (the stress reporter HSP104 and TEF1), we found similar protein expression profiles with both methods and no evidence for a long lived subpopulation with different Hsp104 or Tef1 profiles. Thus, we conclude that our dynamic population-averaging data is not caused by the presence of specific long-lived subpopulations. We alert the reader of this potential issue in the main text, which is supported by a new supplementary figure."
