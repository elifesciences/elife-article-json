In this work, we demonstrate a critical role for the RGD-binding integrin \u03b18\u03b21 in promoting nutrient absorption through regulation of gastrointestinal motility. Smooth muscle-specific deletion and antibody blockade of \u03b18 in mice result in enhanced gastric antral smooth muscle contraction, more rapid gastric emptying, and more rapid transit of food through the small intestine leading to malabsorption of dietary fats and carbohydrates as well as protection from weight gain in a diet-induced model of obesity. Mechanistically, ligation of \u03b18\u03b21 by the milk protein Mfge8 reduces antral smooth muscle contractile force by preventing RhoA activation through a PTEN-dependent mechanism. Collectively, our results identify a role for \u03b18\u03b21 in regulating gastrointestinal motility and identify \u03b18 as a potential target for disorders characterized by hypo- or hyper-motility."
