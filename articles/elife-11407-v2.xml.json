In <i>Salmonella typhimurium</i> and <i>Escherichia coli</i>, the virulence determining two-component system PhoQ/PhoP regulates the transcription of <i>mgtA</i> gene by sensing Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentrations in the periplasm. However, the factors that affect MgtA function are not known. This study demonstrates, for the first time, that MgtA is highly dependent on anionic phospholipids and in particular, cardiolipin. Colocalization studies confirm that MgtA is found in the cardiolipin lipid domains in the membrane. The head group of cardiolipin plays major role in activation of MgtA suggesting that cardiolipin may act as a Mg<sup>2+</sup> chaperone for MgtA. We further show that MgtA is highly sensitive to free Mg<sup>2+</sup> (Mg<sup>2+</sup><sub>free</sub>) levels in the solution. MgtA is activated when the Mg<sup>2+</sup><sub>free</sub> concentration is reduced below 10 \u03bcM and is strongly inhibited above 1 mM, indicating that Mg<sup>2+</sup><sub>free</sub> acts as product inhibitor. Combined, our findings conclude that MgtA may act as a sensor as well as a transporter of Mg<sup>2+</sup>."

Information about these interactions could in the future help researchers understand how these bacteria try to protect themself in the hostile environment in the human gut or cells of the immune systems. Further studies of this system could be used to develop biological sensors for magnesium or to design antibiotics that interfere with the magnesium transporter to treat bacterial infections."

Mg<sup>2+</sup> has diverse biological roles, ranging from being an essential cofactor in ATP-mediated enzymatic reactions to being a signaling molecule that activates important virulence systems in bacteria (<a href=\"#bib17\">Groisman et al., 2013</a>). Mg<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis is well studied in Gram-negative bacteria like <i>S. typhimurium</i> and <i>E. coli</i> (<a href=\"#bib36\">Papp-Wallace and Maguire, 2008</a>). Three classes of Mg<sup>2+</sup> transporters have been identified in bacteria: CorA, MgtE and MgtA (magnesium transporter A)/MgtB. Based on the Mg<sup>2+</sup> transport studies, Snavely et al., proposed that CorA transports Mg<sup>2+</sup> under normal Mg<sup>2+</sup> levels, whereas MgtA and MgtB transport Mg<sup>2+</sup> when bacteria faces low Mg<sup>2+</sup> condition (<a href=\"#bib51\">Snavely et al., 1991</a>). Later Garcia Vescovi et al., identified that the low Mg<sup>2+</sup> levels in the periplasm activate the PhoQ/P system (<a href=\"#bib55\">V\u00e9scovi et al., 1996</a>), which in turn induces the expression of genes essential for adapting the Mg<sup>2+</sup> limiting environments (<a href=\"#bib26\">Monsieurs et al., 2005</a>). One of the genes was found to be <i>mgtA</i>. In addition to PhoQ/P mediated activation, a Mg<sup>2+</sup> sensing riboswitch at the 5\u2019 leader region was found to activate the transcription of <i>mgtA</i> gene when the Mg<sup>2+</sup> level in cytoplasm falls below a certain threshold (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cromie et al., 2006</a>). Therefore, both the intracellular and extracellular Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentrations regulate transcription of the <i>mgtA</i> gene. Upon translation, MgtA is believed to transport Mg<sup>2+</sup> from the periplasm into the cytoplasm under Mg<sup>2+</sup> depriving conditions (<a href=\"#bib50\">Snavely et al., 1989</a>). It has been shown that deletion of the <i>mgtA</i> gene affects the survival of <i>S. typhimurium</i> at higher temperatures and also promotes lysis in <i>Streptococcus pneumonia</i> (<a href=\"#bib30\">O'Connor et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Neef et al., 2011</a>) ."

                        "text": "MgtA belongs to the P3 subfamily of P-type ATPases (<a href=\"#bib33\">Palmgren and Axelsen, 1998</a>). The P3 family is subdivided into P3A and P3B. The P3A family is dominated by H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases found in plants (<a href=\"#bib35\">Palmgren, 2001</a>), while P3B contains Mg<sup>2+</sup> ATPases, found to be dominant amongst prokaryotes (<a href=\"#bib21\">K\u00fchlbrandt, 2004</a>). Recently, a close homolog of MgtA was reported in <i>Petunia hybrida</i> (PH1), which lacks the ability to induce a proton gradient. PH1 was proposed to support the proton pumping performed by the P3A proton pump PH5, but evidence for magnesium transport was not established (<a href=\"#bib11\">Faraco et al., 2014</a>). In general, MgtA is found in bacteria, archaea, fungi and plants (See also <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>\u2013<a href=\"#fig1s2\">2</a>). MgtA has ten predicted transmembrane helices (TM), a nucleotide binding domain (N), a phosphorylation domain (P) and an actuator domain (A) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). The Post-Albers cycle describes the transport mechanism of a P-type ATPase (<a href=\"#bib1\">Albers, 1967</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Post et al., 1969</a>). During the transport cycle, P-type ATPases alternate between the E1 and E2 states with different intermediate conformational states (<a href=\"#bib34\">Palmgren and Nissen, 2011</a>). The E1 state has high affinity and is open for ions binding from the cytoplasm. Ion binding induces autophosphorylation by transferring the \u03b3-phosphate from an ATP molecule to a conserved aspartate residue in the DKTGT consensus motif of the P domain forming the E1P state (<a href=\"#bib22\">Lutsenko and Kaplan, 1995</a>). In <i>E. coli</i> MgtA (ecMgtA), the phosphorylated aspartate corresponds to Asp 373. Phosphorylation induces domain rearrangements leading to the E2P state, which is now open to the periplasmic side. E2P has low affinity for the bound ions and high affinity for the counter ions (Mg<sup>2+</sup> in case of MgtA). The exchange of counter ions dephosphorylates the enzyme and forms the E2 state. Further conformational changes return the enzyme back to the E1 state and the counterions are released into the cytoplasm, thus completing the transport cycle. A possible Post-Albers scheme with the four steps transport cycle can be visualized for MgtA and is given in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>. Since MgtA imports Mg<sup>2+</sup> into the cytoplasm, Mg<sup>2+</sup> is predicted to have high affinity to the E2P state. However, the stoichiometry and electrogenic nature of magnesium transport by MgtA remains unknown."

Despite these detailed transcriptional regulatory studies, very little is known about the biochemical mechanism or factors influencing the Mg<sup>2+</sup> transport by MgtA. Here, we present the first biochemical characterization of purified MgtA from <i>E. coli</i>. We show that anionic phospholipids, particularly cardiolipin (CL) are crucial for in vitro activation of MgtA. Further the overexpressed MgtA colocalizes with CL in vivo. We also show that MgtA ATPase activity is highly sensitive to Mg<sup>2+</sup><sub>free</sub> concentration and that Mg<sup>2+</sup> acts as an inhibitor at higher concentrations. Our findings reveal for the first time, the effect of anionic lipids and free Mg<sup>2+</sup> on MgtA function."

All the four fatty acid chains of bovine heart CL are almost exclusively linoleate chains (18:2, 18:1, 18:3) (<a href=\"#bib48\">Shinzawa-Itoh et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Schlame et al., 1993</a>).

The SEC elution profile shows a monodisperse peak corresponding to the size of a monomer (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). The SEC profile of MgtA in the presence and absence of CL did not show signs of dimerization of MgtA. However, a significant shift in the elution peak was observed corresponding to a difference of ~50\u2009kDa. This shift likely indicates an increase in lipid-protein-detergent micelle radius caused by binding of CL to MgtA. The presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> with CL does not show any further shift, confirming that MgtA function as a monomer in the described assay conditions. The general P-type ATPase inhibitor vanadate as well as specific inhibitors that affect different steps of Post-Albers cycle (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>) inhibited the MgtA ATPase activity.

NAO is widely used to image anionic phospholipids in bacteria and displays a specific red-shifted fluorescence emission when bound to CL (<a href=\"#bib23\">Mileykovskaya et al., 2001</a>). The online web resource GenoBase: comprehensive resource database of <i>Escherichia coli</i> K-12 (<a href=\"#bib32\">Otsuka et al., 2015</a>), reports protein localization images for most <i>E. coli</i> proteins. The genes were fused to GFP and overexpressed in the <i>E. coli</i> strain K-12. The confocal images of MgtA (gene locus: JW4201) fused to GFP from GenoBase showed clear fluorescence localized at the poles. Since our biochemical data showed that MgtA is activated in the presence of CL, we hypothesized that MgtA could colocalize with the CL rich domains in <i>E. coli</i>. To further expand the analysis, we decided to include an N-terminal deletion mutant as well (N\u039431-MgtA). The N-terminal of ecMgtA is rich in positively charged residues and is predicted to harbor intrinsically disordered regions. Similar disordered regions are observed in MgtA and the ortholog MgtB from <i>S. typhimurium.</i> The deletion mutant served two purposes; 1) to test whether the positively charged residues were important for the interaction with CL, since activation by lipids binding at the N-terminus had been reported for another P-type ATPase, ATP13A2 of the P5 subfamily (<a href=\"#bib11\">Faraco et al., 2014</a>) and 2) to test whether this stretch was important for trafficking to the membrane. We generated constructs of MgtA and N\u039431-MgtA with blue fluorescent protein (BFP) fused at the C-terminus. The confocal images of <i>E. coli</i> C43(DE3) overexpressing MgtA-BFP confirmed that it was mainly concentrated at the poles and colocalized with the NAO-stained CL domains (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). The N\u039431-MgtA-BFP was also found at the poles and colocalized with CL (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). As a control, the overexpressed BFP alone did not colocalize with the NAO stained CL (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Furthermore, no significant difference in the ATPase activity between the purified wt and N\u039431 mutant (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>) was observed. This suggests that unlike ATP13A2, the intrinsic disorder predicted in the N-termini of both MgtA in <i>E. coli</i> and MgtA/B in <i>S. typhimurium</i> is not required for activation by lipids and do not play any role in membrane trafficking or targeting to the CL domains (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>)."

To estimate the sensitivity of MgtA to Mg<sup>2+</sup>, we have to make the assumption that Mg<sup>2+</sup> must be free in solution to be transported through MgtA. The Mg<sup>2+</sup><sub>free</sub> indicates that the Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions are coordinated only by water and not by ATP, which is also present in the assay mix. It is not possible to perform an ATPase assay with the concentrations of Mg<sup>2+</sup><sub>free</sub>, ATP<sub>free</sub> and Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ATP acting independent of each other.

This experiment showed steep activation of MgtA ATPase activity at low Mg<sup>2+</sup><sub>total</sub> levels that peak when the molar ATP concentration is equivalent to the molar Mg<sup>2+</sup><sub>total</sub> concentration (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). A rapid decline in ATPase activity was observed at higher Mg<sup>2+</sup><sub>total</sub> concentrations. For each of the ATP concentrations indicated, the ATPase activity reached equivalent maximum velocity (~14 \u03bcmol Pi min<sup>-1</sup> mg<sup>-1</sup>). However, the activation profile was slightly shifted towards higher Mg<sup>2+</sup><sub>total</sub> as the ATP concentration in assay buffer increased. This shift can be explained by the fact that higher ATP concentrations chelate more Mg<sup>2+</sup> than lower ATP concentrations, thereby reducing the level of Mg<sup>2+</sup><sub>free</sub> available for MgtA to transport, causing a delay in activation. This is verified by plotting the data from <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a> against the calculated Mg<sup>2+</sup><sub>free</sub> (Calculated with MAXC, see materials and methods) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). We found that the activating concentration of Mg<sup>2+</sup><sub>free</sub> was equivalent (~10.0 \u03bcM) for all three fixed ATP concentrations. Further, we observed that the ATPase activity peaked at 250 \u03bcM Mg<sup>2+</sup><sub>free</sub> and was inhibited rapidly above 1.0 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup><sub>free</sub>. Since the cytoplasmic Mg<sup>2+</sup><sub>free</sub> concentration is ~1 mM (<a href=\"#bib49\">Silver and Clark, 1971</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Froschauer et al., 2004</a>), the inhibition that is observed could occur from the cytoplasmic side of MgtA. In that case, the inhibition can be explained as product inhibition, considering the Mg<sup>2+</sup><sub>free</sub> transported into the cytoplasm to be the product. Together, these results indicate that Mg<sup>2+</sup><sub>free</sub> regulates MgtA ATPase activity when the Mg<sup>2+</sup><sub>free</sub> levels deviate from the 1 mM physiological threshold concentration. We also calculated the apparent K<sub>m</sub> for Mg<sup>2+</sup><sub>free</sub> to be between 10\u201315 \u03bcM for the three ATP concentrations tested (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>) which is only\u00a0slightly\u00a0lower than the reported ~29 \u03bcM from <i>in vivo</i> studies with <i>S. typhimurium</i> at 37\u00b0C (<a href=\"#bib50\">Snavely et al., 1989</a>)."

As observed in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, the ATPase activity peaked when the molar concentration of ATP was equivalent to the indicated levels of molar Mg<sup>2+</sup><sub>total</sub>. However, a slight decrease in the ATPase activity was observed at higher concentrations of ATP for all fixed Mg<sup>2+</sup><sub>total</sub>. This could indicate that the ATP<sub>free</sub> is competing for the Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ATP binding site, thereby reducing the MgtA-Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ATP complex formation. However, interestingly, the activation curves were shifted to higher concentrations of ATP as the Mg<sup>2+</sup><sub>total</sub> in the reaction mix increased. This delay in activation at higher concentrations of fixed Mg<sup>2+</sup><sub>total</sub> once again indicates that high levels of Mg<sup>2+</sup><sub>free</sub> acts as inhibitor as observed in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, and visualized in <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>. When excess Mg<sup>2+</sup><sub>free</sub> is present at lower ATP concentrations, the ATPase activity is inhibited.

To check the influence of pH on MgtA, we tested the MgtA Mg<sup>2+</sup><sub>total</sub> dependency at different pH values (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). Maximum ATPase activity was observed at pH 7.2. However, at all pH values, a decrease in ATPase activity at higher Mg<sup>2+</sup><sub>total</sub> concentration was observed corresponding to product inhibition as seen in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>. When the ATPase activity was plotted against Mg<sup>2+</sup><sub>free</sub> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>), it became clear that in the pH range from 6.3 to 7.2, the activation and inhibition profiles were equivalent with only decrease in the maximum ATPase activity when the pH is below 7.0. At pH 7.6 and pH 7.9, the affinity for Mg<sup>2+</sup><sub>free</sub> was reduced, but the inhibition by Mg<sup>2+</sup><sub>free</sub> was equivalent to the other pH ranges.

Considering that the MgtA homolog PH1 from <i>P. hybrida</i> did not show proton transport activity (<a href=\"#bib11\">Faraco et al., 2014</a>), we have to question whether proton counter transport occurs in MgtA. Both MgtA and PH lack the membrane imbedded arginine, which is important for proton translocation as described for the P3A-type (H<sup>+</sup>) ATPases, Pma1 (Arg 695) in yeast (<a href=\"#bib9\">Dutra et al., 1998</a>) and AHA2 (Arg 655) in Arabidopsis (<a href=\"#bib5\">Buch-Pedersen and Palmgren, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Pedersen et al., 2007</a>). These observations suggest that MgtA may be importing magnesium without the need for proton as counter ion. Since enzymatic activity in general is affected by changes in pH, the pH dependent ATPase activity changes we observe may not be linked to proton translocation. The role of protons as counterions for MgtA therefore awaits further verification."

A key Mg<sup>2+</sup> transporter is MgtA, which is expressed under low Mg<sup>2+</sup> conditions sensed by the PhoP/PhoQ system. A detailed picture of the transcriptional regulation of <i>mgtA</i> is available. However, the in vitro\u00a0enzymatic characterization of MgtA has been missing and the factors that affect the enzymatic functions are not known. Towards the aim of enzymatic characterization of MgtA, we purified MgtA and demonstrated the tight association of MgtA with CL, and sensitivity of MgtA towards Mg<sup>2+</sup>, providing the first step in understanding the P3B-type ATPases."

The purification process decreased the ATPase activity of MgtA, indicating the\u00a0removal of an activating compound or an interacting partner. Addition of total <i>E. coli</i> lipids restored the ATPase activity, leading to successful reactivation of purified MgtA. Addition of DOPE, DOPG and CL independently to an\u00a0ATPase assay revealed that MgtA was only activated by anionic phospholipids. Furthermore, CL showed the strongest activation as compared to DOPG, while DOPE had no effect on ATPase activity. This indicated the importance of specific lipid-protein interactions in the membrane. Our results are the first to link activation by CL to any P-type ATPase. CL has often been linked to membrane proteins connected with the oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria and membrane proteins involved with lipid metabolism (<a href=\"#bib40\">Planas-Iglesias et al., 2015</a>). Lipids exert their effect on membrane proteins either by binding to specific sites or by changing the environment immediate to the protein, thus facilitating oligomerization (<a href=\"#bib10\">Ernst et al., 2010</a>). MgtA does not exhibit oligomerization in presence of CL or CL-Mg<sup>2+</sup>\u00a0in vitro Thus, CL likely causes a small structural change directly on the protein surface either by binding to a specific site or by facilitating Mg<sup>2+</sup><sub>free</sub> recognition. Our data suggests that the CL binding does not occur at the N-terminus but at an yet unidentified site."

This suggests that other lipid types do not interfere with CL binding to MgtA and hints that the head group of the lipids plays an important role in the activation. The preferential selection of CL in the presence of other lipid types hint that MgtA function may be regulated in vivo by changing the local concentration of CL. Since CL have been shown to form domains or rafts at the poles and division septa in <i>E. coli</i> (<a href=\"#bib44\">Renner and Weibel, 2011</a>), we hypothesized that MgtA could be localized in these CL domains. Our confocal studies indeed showed that MgtA is confined to the poles and colocalized with NAO stained CL. Several publications have validated the use of NAO to stain CL-rich domains (<a href=\"#bib23\">Mileykovskaya et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Mileykovskaya and Dowhan, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Mileykovskaya and Dowhan, 2009</a>). However, a recent study questions the specificity of NAO to CL, and shows that NAO stains both anionic phospholipids, PG and CL in the membrane and at the poles of <i>E. coli</i> (<a href=\"#bib31\">Oliver et al., 2014</a>). Considering the discrepancies in NAO staining, it is not possible to distinguish which anionic lipid among CL and PG would have the most pronounced effect on MgtA in vivoin the <i>E. coli</i> inner membrane.\u00a0It has earlier been reported that expression of MgtA and consequent removal of Mg<sup>2+</sup> from the periplasm by MgtA further activated the sensor kinase PhoQ of the two-component system PhoQ/PhoP. This positive feedback regulation increased the level phosphorylated PhoP, which is necessary for the expression of subset of genes expressed under low Mg<sup>2+</sup> condition\u00a0<a href=\"#bib37\">Park and Groisman, 2014</a>It is interesting to note that PhoP of the two-component system PhoQ/P, which activates MgtA expression, also goes to one pole in <i>S. typhimurium</i> when activated by phosphorylation (<a href=\"#bib47\">Sciara et al., 2008</a>).Our observation that MgtA is localized in CL rich domains in the poles, thus connect the localization observed for activated PhoP and MgtA. However the exact molecular mechanism behind the similar localization pattern of MgtA-CL and PhoP remains to be determined."

Thus, it is reasonable to conclude that MgtA is active in an anionic phospholipid environment. This diversity of lipid binding could arise from the structural similarity between PG and CL. In bacteria, CL is synthesized by the\u00a0fusion of two PG molecules (<a href=\"#bib52\">Tropp, 1997</a>). While CL carries two negative charges in the head group, PG carries only one. This difference in the charge could contribute either to efficient binding of lipid or efficient presentation of substrate (Mg<sup>2+</sup>) to MgtA. It has been shown that CL can bind divalent cations like Mg<sup>2+</sup> and undergo lipid phase changes as a function of Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration(<a href=\"#bib54\">Vail and Stollery, 1979</a>). It is therefore tempting to speculate that CL could act as a Mg<sup>2+</sup> reservoir or as a chaperone for easy substrate presentation to MgtA. The Cu<sup>+</sup>-ATPases from the P1B-type ATPase family are well known to require protein chaperones that are either part of the Cu<sup>+</sup>-ATPases or expressed as separate proteins in cytoplasm to bind and deliver Cu<sup>+</sup> to the Cu<sup>+</sup>-ATPases (<a href=\"#bib2\">Arguello et al., 2007</a>). Our observation with bovine heart CL indicates that the head group of cardiolipin plays the main role in activation of MgtA relative to the composition of fatty acid tails. This, it is intriguing to speculate that the head group of CL could function as the Mg<sup>2+</sup> chaperone for MgtA and its function could differ depending on the side it associates with MgtA. If the headgroup of CL faces the periplasmic side, then it may act as a chaperon for Mg<sup>2+</sup>, assisting the uptake of Mg<sup>2+</sup>. If the headgroup faces the cytoplasmic side, it may play a role in sensing the Mg<sup>2+</sup> levels in cytoplasm, thereby regulating MgtA activity. However to further address these questions, a crystal structure of CL bound to MgtA will be necessary as it is not possible to determine the sidedness of the CL headgroup binding site in MgtA in the present study."

MgtA is activated already below 10 \u03bcM Mg<sup>2+</sup><sub>free</sub>. The activation is followed by a rapid decrease in activity as the Mg<sup>2+</sup><sub>free</sub> concentration rises above 1 mM (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). All P-type ATPases require Mg<sup>2+</sup> for their activity. Even though our data does not conclusively establish the transport of Mg<sup>2+</sup> by MgtA, it shows that MgtA is highly sensitive to the Mg<sup>2+</sup><sub>free</sub> and the level of sensitivity is different from other P-type ATPases. The related H<sup>+</sup> ATPase from <i>Neurospora crassa</i> also shows decrease in ATPase activity at higher Mg<sup>2+</sup>\u00a0concentration (<a href=\"#bib4\">Brooker and Slayman, 1983</a>). However, it is not completely inhibited even above 20 mM of Mg<sup>2+</sup><sub>total</sub>, whereas MgtA is completely inhibited above 5 mM. MgtA presents a strikingly narrow activity range induced by Mg<sup>2+</sup> as compared to the H<sup>+</sup> ATPase. Overall, we conclude that MgtA is more sensitive to Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentrations in vitro than any\u00a0other\u00a0studied P-type ATPase. This sensitivity towards Mg<sup>2+</sup> points out that Mg<sup>2+</sup> is the ion transported through MgtA <i>in vivo</i>. The narrow activity range suggests that MgtA could have more Mg<sup>2+</sup> binding sites other than the transport sites to sense the varying Mg<sup>2+</sup><sub>free</sub> concentrations."

The observation that MgtA transports Mg<sup>2+</sup> into the cytoplasm and its ATPase activity decreases above the physiological 1 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup><sub>free</sub>, strengthens the notion that the cytoplasmic Mg<sup>2+</sup><sub>free</sub> concentration also regulates MgtA internally. Additionally, it has been reported that increasing cytoplasmic Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentrations negatively regulates <i>mgtA</i>-coding region (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cromie et al., 2006</a>). Based on these results we extend the model, initially proposed by Groisman and coworkers (<a href=\"#bib7\">Cromie et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Park et al., 2010</a>) in which PhoP/PhoQ senses low Mg<sup>2+</sup> in the periplasm and activates <i>mgtA</i> transcription. When the cytoplasmic Mg<sup>2+</sup> falls below a threshold, the riboswitch allows transcription of <i>mgtA</i>. Our data adds further evidence to the post translated system, in which MgtA is targeted to the PG-CL domains at the poles and transport Mg<sup>2+</sup> into the cytoplasm, thereby satisfying the cellular needs. When the Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration in the cytoplasm exceeds the threshold, Mg<sup>2+</sup><sub>free</sub> negatively regulates both MgtA in PG-CL domain and <i>mgtA</i> coding region (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>).

The authors demonstrate that: 1) anionic phospholipids are required for the in vitro activity (i.e., ATPase) of the MgtA protein; 2) MgtA co-localizes with anionic phospholipids in the poles of <i>E. coli</i>; and 3) the activity of MgtA is highly sensitive to the concentration of free Mg<sup>2+</sup>. This manuscript is well written. Moreover, the authors are cautious by not making more claims than their data and the literature allows. Furthermore, their findings nicely complement and are in agreement with the current knowledge of how expression of the MgtA protein is regulated."

To establish whether the head group or the fatty acid chain of CL was most important for MgtA function, we performed an ATPase assay as a function of CL extracted from bovine heart vs. <i>E. coli</i> CL. Both CL extractions share the same head group, however vary to a greater extent in their fatty acid composition. This experiment indicates that the head group primarily induced initial activation while the fatty acid chains affected the turnover number. Our observations are described in the section \u201cThe head group of CL plays a major role in MgtA activation\u201d as well as in the Discussion.
