The mechanisms by which UNC93B1 mediates these regulatory effects remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that UNC93B1 enters the secretory pathway and directly controls the packaging of TLRs into COPII vesicles that bud from the ER. Unlike other COPII loading factors, UNC93B1 remains associated with the TLRs through post-Golgi sorting steps. Unexpectedly, these steps are different among endosomal TLRs. TLR9 requires UNC93B1-mediated recruitment of adaptor protein complex 2 (AP-2) for delivery to endolysosomes while TLR7, TLR11, TLR12, and TLR13 utilize alternative trafficking pathways. Thus, our study describes a mechanism for differential sorting of endosomal TLRs by UNC93B1, which may explain the distinct roles played by these receptors in certain autoimmune diseases."

The mechanisms by which UNC93B1 mediates these regulatory effects remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that UNC93B1 enters the secretory pathway and directly controls the packaging of TLRs into COPII vesicles that bud from the ER. Unlike other COPII loading factors, UNC93B1 remains associated with the TLRs through post-Golgi sorting steps. Unexpectedly, these steps are different among endosomal TLRs. TLR9 requires UNC93B1-mediated recruitment of adaptor protein complex 2 (AP-2) for delivery to endolysosomes while TLR7, TLR11, TLR12, and TLR13 utilize alternative trafficking pathways. Thus, our study describes a mechanism for differential sorting of endosomal TLRs by UNC93B1, which may explain the distinct roles played by these receptors in certain autoimmune diseases."

To reduce this risk, TLRs are sequestered inside the cell within membrane-bound compartments known as endosomes."

However, the exact mechanisms by which this protein controls TLR trafficking were unclear. Now Lee et al. reveal that it directly controls the packaging of at least six TLRs at the endoplasmic reticulum: it helps to load these TLRs into vesicles, which are in turn processed by the Golgi apparatus\u2014the organelle wherein proteins are sorted and packaged en route to their final destinations. Surprisingly, UNC93B1 remains associated with the TLRs even after Golgi processing."

In order for TLR9 to be delivered to the endosome, UNC93B1 must recruit an adaptor protein called AP-2, whereas other TLRs appear to require different actions by UNC93B1. By defining the mechanisms that underlie the differential trafficking of endosomal TLRs, Lee et al. suggest that we may learn how to manipulate distinct aspects of TLR activation, and also gain insights into the causes of certain autoimmune diseases."

All of the TLRs capable of nucleic acid recognition localize within endosomal compartments which sequesters these receptors away from self nucleic acids in the extracellular space (<a href=\"#bib6\">Barton and Kagan, 2009</a>). Our previous studies as well as work from other groups indicate that a requirement for ectodomain cleavage of intracellular TLRs further restricts receptor activation to protease-rich acidic compartments (<a href=\"#bib22\">Ewald et al., 2008</a>, <a href=\"#bib21\">2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Park et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Garcia-Cattaneo et al., 2012</a>). Bypassing this requirement enables responses to extracellular self nucleic acid and leads to fatal inflammatory disease in mice (<a href=\"#bib42\">Mouchess et al., 2011</a>). Moreover, the system appears carefully balanced as simply overexpressing TLR7 in mice causes responses to self-RNA and development of an SLE-like disease (<a href=\"#bib50\">Pisitkun et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Subramanian et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Deane et al., 2007</a>).

UNC93B1, a multi-pass transmembrane protein localized to the ER, appears to facilitate this trafficking (<a href=\"#bib11\">Brinkmann et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Kim et al., 2008</a>). Mice homozygous for a nonfunctional Unc93b1 (H412R) allele (<i>Unc93b1</i><sup>3d/3d</sup>) fail to respond to TLR3, TLR7, or TLR9 ligands, and mice and humans deficient in UNC93B1 are highly susceptible to viral infection (<a href=\"#bib13\">Casrouge et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Tabeta et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Lafaille et al., 2012</a>). More recently, UNC93B1 has been implicated in the function of TLR11, TLR12, and TLR13 (<a href=\"#bib49\">Pifer et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Shi et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Koblansky et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Oldenburg et al., 2012</a>). UNC93B1 is not required for responses by surface localized TLRs such as TLR2 and TLR4 (<a href=\"#bib59\">Tabeta et al., 2006</a>). UNC93B1 associates with endosomal TLRs, and in cells with defective UNC93B1, TLR9 and TLR7 fail to leave the ER (<a href=\"#bib11\">Brinkmann et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Kim et al., 2008</a>). However, the mechanism by which UNC93B1 facilitates TLR trafficking to endosomal compartments remains enigmatic, especially considering its reported direct translocation from the ER to endolysosomes (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kim et al., 2008</a>). This pathway is inconsistent with our findings that TLR9 and TLR7 traffic through the general secretory pathway en route to endosomes (<a href=\"#bib22\">Ewald et al., 2008</a>, <a href=\"#bib21\">2011</a>). In addition, mice expressing an aspartic acid to alanine mutation at amino acid position 34 in UNC93B1 (<i>Unc93b1</i><sup>D34A/D34A</sup>) were recently shown to develop spontaneous autoimmunity due to enhanced TLR7 responses and diminished TLR9 responses (<a href=\"#bib24\">Fukui et al., 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib23\">2011</a>). These findings suggest that regulation of TLRs by UNC93B1 can influence the relative thresholds of receptor activation. For these reasons, we have sought to define the molecular basis by which UNC93B1 controls endosomal TLR trafficking and function."

Gp96 functions as an ER folding chaperone for many TLRs, including TLR9, and PRAT4A has been implicated in TLR trafficking from the ER (<a href=\"#bib60\">Takahashi et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Yang et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Lee et al., 2012</a>). Additionally, the HRS/ESCRT pathway is involved in post-Golgi trafficking by sorting ubiquitinated TLR7 and TLR9 to endosomal compartments (<a href=\"#bib15\">Chiang et al., 2012</a>), and the adaptor protein-3 (AP-3) has been reported to target TLR9 and TLR7 to lysosome related organelles specialized for type I IFN induction (<a href=\"#bib27\">Honda et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Blasius et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Sasai et al., 2010</a>).

This model is based in part on the observation that UNC93B1 never acquires Endoglycosidase H (EndoH)-resistant glycans (<a href=\"#bib11\">Brinkmann et al., 2007</a>), which are acquired only when proteins traffic through the medial Golgi. Because this proposed function for UNC93B1 conflicts with our model of TLR9 trafficking (<a href=\"#bib22\">Ewald et al., 2008</a>, <a href=\"#bib21\">2011</a>), we first examined whether UNC93B1 is present in endolysosomal compartments in unstimulated cells. Wildtype (WT) UNC93B1 but not the nonfunctional (H412R) mutant was detectable in phagosomes purified from unstimulated RAW264 cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Moreover, a portion of UNC93B1-WT gained EndoH-resistance in multiple cell types, while UNC93B1-H412R was entirely EndoH-sensitive (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B\u2013F</a>). These results agree with a previous report that the H412R mutant fails to leave the ER (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kim et al., 2008</a>). To formally demonstrate that the increased molecular weight of UNC93B1-WT is due to N-linked glycans, we mutated Asn-251, which is within a consensus N-glycosylation site, and this mutant failed to acquire EndoH-resistant glycans (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>). Based on the acquisition of EndoH-resistant glycans by UNC93B1, we examined whether UNC93B1 is detectable within COPII vesicles, which mediate transport of cargo between the ER and Golgi (<a href=\"#bib65\">Zanetti et al., 2012</a>). Using an in vitro COPII budding assay (<a href=\"#bib31\">Kim et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Merte et al., 2010</a>), we compared levels of UNC93B1-WT and UNC93B1-H412R in purified vesicles. UNC93B1-WT, but not H412R, was clearly present within the vesicles, further supporting a model in which UNC93B1 exits the ER through the general secretory pathway (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1H</a>). Altogether, these data indicate that a pool of UNC93B1 protein exits the ER and traffics through the Golgi in unstimulated cells. Moreover, transit from the ER to the Golgi may be important for UNC93B1 function, as the nonfunctional UNC93B1-H412R mutant fails to enter COPII vesicles and does not reach the medial Golgi."

As expected, ER exit of both CD4-TLR3 and CD4-TLR7 required UNC93B1, which is consistent with defective TLR3 and TLR7 signaling in <i>Unc93b1</i><sup>3d/3d</sup> mice (<a href=\"#bib59\">Tabeta et al., 2006</a>), whereas CD4-TLR4 trafficked independently of UNC93B1 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). CD4-TLR11 and CD4-TLR13 also required UNC93B1 for ER exit (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). Less is known about the localization or trafficking of these TLRs, although biochemical studies have suggested that these TLRs can associate with UNC93B1 (<a href=\"#bib11\">Brinkmann et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Melo et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Pifer et al., 2011</a>). Our results are the first to show that UNC93B1 regulates the trafficking of TLR11 and TLR13 by controlling ER exit. Altogether, our data indicate that the role for UNC93B1 in controlling ER exit extends to all known endosomal TLRs (TLR3, TLR7, TLR9) as well as TLR11 and TLR13."

Based on the predicted topology of UNC93B1 (<a href=\"#bib11\">Brinkmann et al., 2007</a>), the N- and C-termini face the cytosol, so we reasoned that these regions would be most likely to interact with putative trafficking factors (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). Interestingly, N-terminal truncations resulted in a strong defect in TLR9 trafficking from the ER as evidenced by significantly reduced or absent precursor and cleaved forms of TLR9 in cells expressing the \u039450 and \u039457 UNC93B1 truncations (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). This defective trafficking resulted in impaired responses to TLR9 ligands in macrophages, while TLR2 responses remained intact (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Taken together, our data indicate that the N-terminal region of UNC93B1 contains residues important for trafficking of TLR9 and UNC93B1 from the ER to endolysosomes. These findings are in agreement with a previous study showing that TLR9 responsiveness is strongly dependent on the N-terminus of UNC93B1, although this study did not directly examine TLR9 trafficking (<a href=\"#bib24\">Fukui et al., 2009</a>).

Moreover, we could detect both the precursor and cleaved forms of TLR9 associated with immunoprecipitated UNC93B1, suggesting that UNC93B1 and TLR9 remain associated after leaving the ER (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). To test whether this post-ER interaction may have functional consequences, we screened UNC93B1 mutants for any role in TLR9 function beyond ER export. Strikingly, truncation of the UNC93B1 C-terminus (\u0394523 and \u0394538) resulted in an accumulation of the Golgi-modified precursor form of TLR9 and a marked reduction of the cleaved receptor (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). This pattern suggests that TLR9 trafficking is blocked at some point after the medial Golgi, in contrast to the trafficking defect observed with N-terminal deletion mutants.

However, for reasons that remain unclear, detection of endogenous or epitope-tagged exogenous TLR7 protein is quite challenging. Consequently, the evidence that TLR7 undergoes ectodomain processing is limited (<a href=\"#bib21\">Ewald et al., 2011</a>), and one group has reported that TLR7 is not cleaved (<a href=\"#bib48\">Park et al., 2008</a>). We synthesized a TLR7 coding sequence optimized for efficient translation (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019) and found that our ability to detect TLR7 protein was significantly improved. Cleaved TLR7 was detected in macrophages expressing UNC93B1-WT but not in macrophages expressing UNC93B1-H412R (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Both the full-length and cleaved forms of TLR7 possessed EndoH-resistant glycans, although fewer of the TLR7 N-linked glycans acquired these modifications than for TLR9 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>, top). These results confirm our previous findings that TLR7 undergoes ectodomain proteolysis and traffics through the Golgi en route to endolysosomes. Importantly, our results confirm that TLR7 trafficking is dependent on UNC93B1."

We considered the possibility that TLR7 may recruit AP-2 directly, thereby obviating the need for UNC93B1. However, when we screened by Y2H for interactions between the cytosolic region of TLR7 and AP-1, AP-2, AP-3, and AP-4, we found that TLR7 interacted specifically with AP-4\u03bc but not AP-2\u03bc (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). We identified three potential Yxx\u03a6 motifs within TLR7, and mutating one of these (Tyr-892) disrupted the interaction with AP-4 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>). In addition, a TLR7-Y892A mutant no longer responded to TLR7 ligands (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G</a>) and displayed reduced ectodomain processing when expressed in bone marrow derived macrophages, suggesting that AP-4 is required for TLR7 delivery to endosomes (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6H</a>). AP-4 has been implicated in vesicular trafficking between the trans Golgi network (TGN) and endosomes (<a href=\"#bib20\">Dell'Angelica et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Aguilar et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Simmen et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Barois and Bakke, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Burgos et al., 2010</a>). Therefore, the association between AP-4 and TLR7 suggests that TLR7 is diverted from the secretory pathway at the TGN and delivered directly to endosomes while continually associating with UNC93B1. Thus, the mechanisms controlling trafficking of TLR7 and TLR9 to the compartments from which they signal are distinct."

UNC93B1 controls exit of at least six TLRs (TLR3, TLR7, TLR9, TLR11, TLR12 and TLR13) from the ER by regulating their loading into COPII vesicles. In addition, we show that UNC93B1 acts at the cell surface by recruiting clathrin AP-2 to internalize TLR9 from the plasma membrane into endosomes. Perhaps most surprisingly, our results indicate that TLR7 and TLR9 have different requirements for UNC93B1 and demonstrate that the localization of these receptors is controlled through distinct post-Golgi trafficking mechanisms.

Interactions between UNC93B1 and TLRs appear necessary for proper trafficking (<a href=\"#bib11\">Brinkmann et al., 2007</a>), but until our work it was unclear how UNC93B1 mediated delivery of TLRs to endosomal compartments. The most direct examination of UNC93B1 function concluded that the protein translocates with TLRs from the ER to endolysosomes without passing through the Golgi apparatus (<a href=\"#bib11\">Brinkmann et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Kim et al., 2008</a>). In contrast, we propose that UNC93B1 is required for loading of TLR9 into COPII vesicles, which direct transport from the ER to the cis-Golgi (<a href=\"#bib65\">Zanetti et al., 2012</a>). Multiple lines of evidence support the conclusion that UNC93B1 regulates this essential aspect of ER exit. First, UNC93B1 is detected within COPII vesicles, but the nonfunctional UNC93B1-H412R mutant is not. Second, a fraction of UNC93B1 protein acquires EndoH-resistant glycans, indicative of trafficking through the medial-Golgi. Again, the UNC93B1-H412R mutant does not acquire EndoH resistance. Third, in cells lacking UNC93B1, TLR9 is not detected within COPII vesicles. Fourth, the EndoH-resistant precursor and cleaved forms of TLR9 are absent in cells not expressing functional UNC93B1. Importantly, we ruled out the possibility that UNC93B1 functions as a folding chaperone by showing that CD4-TLR fusion proteins require UNC93B1 for ER exit. Altogether, these results argue that UNC93B1 regulates TLR passage through the general secretory pathway, instead of controlling direct translocation between the ER and endosomes. We cannot formally rule out that a pool of UNC93B1 uses this non-canonical route, but it would seem to have little if any relevance for TLR trafficking. The recent identification of Sec22b as a factor required for ER to endosome translocation may allow for further investigation of this possibility (<a href=\"#bib14\">Cebrian et al., 2011</a>)."

                        "text": "Our work suggests that at least six, and possibly seven, TLRs are regulated by UNC93B1 in mice. TLR3, TLR7, TLR9, TLR11, TLR12 and TLR13 require UNC93B1 for exit from the ER. It is likely that TLR8 also requires UNC93B1 (<a href=\"#bib28\">Itoh et al., 2011</a>), based on its similarity to TLR7, but we have not yet tested this possibility. Regulation of ER exit of TLR11, TLR12 and TLR13 by UNC93B1 is not completely unexpected, as these TLRs were previously linked to UNC93B1 (<a href=\"#bib11\">Brinkmann et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Melo et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Pifer et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Koblansky et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Oldenburg et al., 2012</a>). The determinants of UNC93B1 binding to each of these TLRs remain poorly defined. Residues within the first 50 amino acids of UNC93B1 appear necessary for export of TLR9 but not for export of TLR7. This result suggests that distinct regions of UNC93B1 are required for association with TLR9 and TLR7, although measuring how these mutations impact TLR/UNC93B1 interactions has been challenging for us and for other groups (<a href=\"#bib24\">Fukui et al., 2009</a>). The fact that UNC93B1-D34A-expressing mice exhibit enhanced TLR7 responses and develop SLE suggests that UNC93B1 is limiting in the ER, at least for TLR7 (<a href=\"#bib23\">Fukui et al., 2011</a>). Presumably, the inability of UNC93B1-D34A to interact with TLR9 results in greater TLR7 export and enhanced signaling. These results and our finding that TLR7 and TLR9 association with UNC93B1 is mutually exclusive suggest that each UNC93B1 molecule may interact with a single TLR. This specificity is particularly important in light of our findings that trafficking routes of TLR7 and TLR9 are distinct. Whether UNC93B1 is similarly selective for other TLRs and identification of the domains that mediate any selectivity are important topics for future studies. Selective export of individual TLRs may provide a mechanism for differential regulation of endosomal TLR responses between cell types or in response to external signals."

                        "text": "Through analysis of UNC93B1 mutants we identified an additional role for UNC93B1 in directing post-Golgi trafficking of TLR9. Unlike typical COPII loading factors, UNC93B1 remains associated with its cargo, traffics with TLR9 to the cell surface, and associates with AP-2 via a YXX\u03a6 motif (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>). Recruitment of AP-2 is necessary for internalization of TLR9 and subsequent trafficking to endolysosomes. This AP-2-dependent trafficking route has been described for several proteins localized to endolysosomes, including LAMP-1, LAMP-2, and MHC Class II (<a href=\"#bib26\">Gough et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Janvier and Bonifacino, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">McCormick et al., 2005</a>). In some cases, the same protein can access endocytic compartments through multiple routes. For example, LAMP-1/2 can also traffic directly from the TGN to endosomes (<a href=\"#bib30\">Karlsson and Carlsson, 1998</a>). While we cannot rule out that TLR9 may reach endolysosomes through multiple routes, AP-2-mediated internalization appears to be the main pathway of delivery, at least in the cells types we have examined. It is interesting that TLR9 and UNC93B1 would have evolved such dependency on this route, especially considering the potential for self-DNA recognition associated with surface localization of TLR9 (<a href=\"#bib7\">Barton et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Mouchess et al., 2011</a>). Indeed, our results appear to underscore why the requirement for ectodomain processing is a critical mechanism ensuring that receptors at the plasma membrane remain nonfunctional (<a href=\"#bib22\">Ewald et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Mouchess et al., 2011</a>)."

Instead, TLR7 utilizes AP-4 to bypass the cell surface and traffic directly to endosomes. This difference in trafficking may result in TLR9 and TLR7 accessing distinct compartments with unique functional properties related to the function of each receptor."

We find no evidence that TLR7 requires UNC93B1 for recruitment of AP-2. Instead, TLR7 appears to employ AP-4 in a direct route of traffic from the TGN to the endosome. These results provide the first evidence that different pathways control TLR7 and TLR9 trafficking and localization. One potential implication of this result is that these pathways may deliver TLR9 and TLR7 to distinct compartments with different access to ligands or distinct signaling properties. We find that TLR11, TLR12 and TLR13, like TLR7, do not require the UNC93B1/AP-2 pathway. However, it remains to be determined whether these TLRs utilize the AP-4 pathway or another pathway to traffic from TGN to endosomes. Further compartmental specialization is generated by AP-3, which interacts with TLR9 and directs the receptor to endosomal compartments dedicated to type I interferon signaling (<a href=\"#bib27\">Honda et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Blasius et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Sasai et al., 2010</a>). TLR7 may also utilize AP-3 to reach this specialized compartment, although we could not detect interaction between AP-3 and TLR7 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). Whether there is transport of TLRs between each of the compartments serviced by AP-2, AP-3, and AP-4 remains an open question."

In addition, TLR7- and TLR9-containing compartments may have differing abilities to access internalized ligands, influencing responses to microbial or self ligands. These possibilities are particularly intriguing when considering the contrasting roles played by TLR7 and TLR9 in SLE, where loss of TLR7 protects against disease while loss of TLR9 exacerbates disease (<a href=\"#bib17\">Christensen et al., 2006</a>). Our findings raise the possibility that distinct cell biological regulation may underlie the different roles played by these receptors in autoimmune disease. Defining the mechanisms underlying this regulation may help explain the etiology of certain autoimmune diseases as well as provide opportunities to selectively manipulate distinct aspects of TLR activation."

As shown in our new Figure 7A, the response to TLR13 ligands is unaffected in these cells, suggesting that TLR13 does not require the UNC93B1/AP-2 pathway for its function. Additionally, we present biochemical evidence that TLR13 trafficking in UNC93B1-Y539A mutant cells is unimpaired (Figure 7B). This result suggests that TLR13 (like TLR7) may utilize AP-4 for Golgi to endosome trafficking, although we do not yet have any direct evidence for this conclusion."

However, we were able to examine TLR11 and TLR12 trafficking in UNC93B1-Y539A mutant cells and found that the trafficking of these receptors is also unaffected by disruption of the UNC93B1/AP-2 pathway (Figure 7C, D)."

We failed to detect any interactions between AP-4 and TLR3, TLR9, TLR11, or TLR13. While this result could support the conclusion that trafficking of TLR3, TLR11, and TLR13 is distinct from trafficking of TLR7, we are hesitant to leap to this conclusion. Our primary concern is that, for reasons that remain unclear, TLR cytosolic domains do not behave equivalently in Y2H assays. For example, Brown et al have reported that the TLR9 cytosolic domain fails to interact with MyD88 by Y2H, while TLR2, TLR5, TLR7, and TLR8 do interact with MyD88 (see Brown et al, EJI, 2006). We have experienced the same problems with the TLR9 cytosolic domain, which is why we did not include Y2H data for TLR9, and suspect that TLR3, TLR11, and TLR13 have similar limitations. Therefore, we cannot rule out that lack of interaction between TLR3, TLR11, or TLR13 (or TLR9 for that matter) and AP-4 is due to a technical limitation of the Y2H assay for these TLRs. For this reason, we have relied on the functional assays that we discussed previously. We would prefer to omit the AP-4 Y2H interaction data from our manuscript due to these technical issues, but we have included the results below for the benefit of the reviewers.
