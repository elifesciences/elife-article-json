SMs are essential for fusion in vivo, but the basis of this requirement is enigmatic. We now report that, in addition to their established roles as fusion accelerators, SM proteins Sly1 and Vps33 directly shield SNARE complexes from Sec17- and Sec18-mediated disassembly. In vivo, wild-type Sly1 and Vps33 function are required to withstand overproduction of Sec17. In vitro, Sly1 and Vps33 impede SNARE complex disassembly by Sec18 and ATP. Unexpectedly, Sec17 directly promotes selective loading of Sly1 and Vps33 onto cognate SNARE complexes. A large thermodynamic barrier limits SM binding, implying that significant conformational rearrangements are involved. In a working model, Sec17 and SMs accelerate fusion mediated by cognate SNARE complexes and protect them from NSF-mediated disassembly, while mis-assembled or non-cognate SNARE complexes are eliminated through kinetic proofreading by Sec18."

SMs are essential for fusion in vivo, but the basis of this requirement is enigmatic. We now report that, in addition to their established roles as fusion accelerators, SM proteins Sly1 and Vps33 directly shield SNARE complexes from Sec17- and Sec18-mediated disassembly. In vivo, wild-type Sly1 and Vps33 function are required to withstand overproduction of Sec17. In vitro, Sly1 and Vps33 impede SNARE complex disassembly by Sec18 and ATP. Unexpectedly, Sec17 directly promotes selective loading of Sly1 and Vps33 onto cognate SNARE complexes. A large thermodynamic barrier limits SM binding, implying that significant conformational rearrangements are involved. In a working model, Sec17 and SMs accelerate fusion mediated by cognate SNARE complexes and protect them from NSF-mediated disassembly, while mis-assembled or non-cognate SNARE complexes are eliminated through kinetic proofreading by Sec18."

Lobingier et al. showed that Sec17 can also load SM proteins on SNARE complexes. This hinders Sec18 action, and so helps to keep the SNARE complexes intact. Because each SM protein tested only binds to the SNARE complex that should function at the membrane where the SM protein resides, these findings suggest SM proteins perform quality control at potential sites of membrane fusion."

However, accruing evidence suggests that SMs share a core ability to bind cognate ternary or quaternary SNARE bundles (<a href=\"#bib11\">Carr et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Scott et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Carpp et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Togneri et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Dulubova et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Kramer and Ungermann, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Lobingier and Merz, 2012</a>). These observations prompted the conjecture that the central, evolutionarily conserved function of SM proteins involves their direct association with assembling pre-fusion <i>trans-</i>SNARE complexes (<a href=\"#bib12\">Carr and Rizo, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Rizo and S\u00fcdhof, 2012</a>).

This acceleration is contingent on initial reaction conditions, and recent experiments show that Munc18-1 stimulates liposome fusion more efficiently in concert with the specialist exocytosis cofactors Munc13 and synaptotagmin (<a href=\"#bib44\">Ma et al., 2013</a>). Similarly, Vps33, Vps45, and Sly1 accelerate liposome fusion, but with nearly absolute requirements for additional factors including Rab proteins and tethering factors (<a href=\"#bib30\">Hickey et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Ohya et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Furukawa and Mima, 2014</a>).

Premature SNARE disassembly was impeded by the Vps-C tethering complex HOPS (<a href=\"#bib88\">Xu et al., 2010</a>). This protective activity of HOPS was hypothesized to reside within its SM subunit Vps33, which is necessary and sufficient for HOPS binding to the vacuole SNARE complex (<a href=\"#bib43\">Lobingier and Merz, 2012</a>). Similarly, Munc18-1, acting in concert with Munc13 and synaptotagmin, facilitated SNARE-mediated liposome fusion in the presence of otherwise inhibitory concentrations of NSF and \u03b1-SNAP (Sec18 and Sec17; <a href=\"#bib44\">Ma et al., 2013</a>). In the absence of NSF and \u03b1-SNAP, Munc18 and Munc13 had little or no effect on the extent of SNARE-mediated liposome fusion when compared to fusion driven solely by SNAREs and synaptotagmin. These findings led to proposals that SMs protect pre-fusion SNARE complexes from premature disassembly while exposing post-fusion complexes and mis-assembled or non-cognate pre-fusion complexes to disassembly by Sec18 (<a href=\"#bib50\">Mima et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Starai et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Rizo and S\u00fcdhof, 2012</a>).

In the course of these studies we discovered that Sec17 directly promotes selective loading of at least two different SM proteins onto cognate SNARE complexes. Moreover, an extraordinarily steep temperature dependence limits SM loading onto SNARE complexes, implying that SM-SNARE complex formation entails significant conformational transitions. The thermal dependence of SM loading may partially explain why SNARE\u2013Sec17\u2013SM complexes eluded detection in previous studies."

To test for synthetic trafficking defects we employed LUCID, a quantitative assay of traffic from the Golgi to the late endosome. LUCID uses a chimeric reporter, the cargo protein Sna3 fused to firefly luciferase (fLuc).

Vacuole and Golgi SM proteins, cognate SNAREs, and Sec17 and Sec18 were individually purified (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>; <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Golgi or vacuole SNARE complexes (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>) were then assembled on immobilized Qa-SNAREs. We emphasize that the SNARE constructs, assembled on affinity supports to probe protein\u2013protein interactions, encoded only cytoplasmic domains, not transmembrane segments. Consequently, the complexes formed from these proteins cannot be described using the membrane-dependent topological terms <i>cis-</i> and <i>trans</i>-. Using conditions optimized for Vps33\u2013SNARE complex binding (<a href=\"#bib43\">Lobingier and Merz, 2012</a>), SNARE complexes were incubated with Sec17, with or without the cognate SM (Vps33 or Sly1). Sec18 was then added to initiate disassembly. In the absence of SMs, Sec18 rapidly and completely disassembled the SNARE complexes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,C</a>, lanes 1\u20135). Disassembly required ATP and was blocked when Mg<sup>2+</sup> was sequestered by EDTA (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,C</a>, compare lanes 5 and 6). Pre-incubation with SMs (Sly1 or Vps33) delayed, but did not prevent, SNARE disassembly (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,C</a>, lanes 7\u201311). The effect of Sly1 was quantified: pre-incubation with the Sly1 decreased the rate of disassembly by 63 \u00b1 9% (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). The Sed5 (Qa-SNARE) used for the experiments shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,D</a> contained only the SNARE domain, and not the H<sub>abc</sub> or N-peptide domains. However, Sly1 also protected Golgi SNARE complexes assembled on Sed5 full cytoplasmic domain rather than Sed5 SNARE domain (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). In control reactions the ability of the Sly1 and Vps33 preparations to impede SNARE disassembly was heat labile (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D,E</a>, compare lanes 3 and 5). Omitting the pre-incubation step reduced both SM binding and SNARE complex protection (<a href=\"#fig3s4\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 4</a>)."

Thus, it was necessary to test whether bound SM proteins reduce the rate of SNARE complex disassembly or, alternatively, accelerate SNARE complex re-assembly. To evaluate these alternatives, SNARE complexes were completely disassembled using Sec17, Sec18, and ATP. Sec18 activity was then quenched with EDTA and the reactions were incubated for an additional 30 min (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). At the low concentrations of free SNAREs liberated by disassembly, no re-assembly of SNARE complexes was detected within 30 min in either the absence or presence of SM (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,C</a>, compare lanes 1 and 3, and lanes 2 and 4).

Because Vps33 has moderate affinity for vacuole SNARE complex (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Lobingier and Merz, 2012</a>), it was also possible to assess the temperature sensitivity of SNARE complex\u2013Vps33 binding without Sec17.

There was little Sly1 dissociation at 4\u00b0C and slightly more at 30\u00b0C (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), indicating that elevated temperature promotes productive SM\u2013SNARE association rather than stabilizing extant SM\u2013SNARE complexes. At 90% saturating levels, Sly1 bound the Sec17\u2013SNARE complex with a half-time of \u223c20 min. Under similar conditions, Sly1 binding to the Sed5 N-peptide and Sec17 binding to Golgi SNARE complexes were both complete within 1 min (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E</a>). When Sly1 was loaded onto SNARE\u2013Sec17 complexes at 24\u00b0 instead of 30\u00b0C, the time required to reach steady-state binding increased from 1 to 4 hr (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8F</a>). These observations indicate that the temperature dependence of SM binding is due to rate-limiting steps in SM\u2013SNARE association rather than dissociation. A possible interpretation is that Vps33 and Sly1 slowly interconvert between ground states unable to bind SNARE complexes and activated, binding-competent, states. SNARE-bound Sec17\u2014and perhaps other docking factors\u2014would then elicit or stabilize activated SM conformations to accelerate SM loading onto cognate SNARE complexes. Because pre-incubation of Sly1 at 30\u00b0C did not accelerate subsequent Sly1 binding to Sec17-SNARE complexes (<a href=\"#fig8s2\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), we suggest that elevated temperature increases the frequency of interconversion between the putative ground and binding-active conformations, rather than by stabilizing an activated conformation."

In these systems the SM, in combination with other factors including HOPS, Munc13, and synaptotagmin, facilitates efficient fusion in the presence of Sec17 and Sec18, suggesting that SMs have a minimum of two fusion-promoting functions. First, SMs promote the assembly of <i>trans-</i>SNARE complexes or make them more fusogenic once assembled. Second, SMs protect <i>trans</i> complexes from premature disassembly by Sec18 (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>, reaction iv). Because multiple cofactors were present in previous studies, it was unclear whether SNARE complex protection from disassembly was attributable directly to SMs, or a property emergent from multiple proteins (<a href=\"#bib73\">Starai et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Ohya et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib88\">Xu et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Ma et al., 2013</a>). Our experiments now show that SMs functionally interact with the SNARE disassembly machinery in vivo, and affirm that SMs from at least two of the four subfamilies are sufficient to decrease rates of Sec18-mediated SNARE disassembly in vitro. Contrary to expectations, however, Vps33 and Sly1 did not compete with Sec17 for SNARE complex binding. Instead, SNARE-bound Sec17 accelerated SM loading, resulting in the efficient formation of SM\u2013Sec17\u2013SNARE co-complexes with 1:3:1 stoichiometry. Sec17 is therefore a multifunctional SNARE complex adapter, capable of recruiting not only the disassembly ATPase Sec18 but also compartment-specific SMs that oppose Sec18-mediated SNARE disassembly."

When an SM recognizes and binds a Sec17\u2013SNARE complex (reaction iv), it promotes fusion in at least three ways. First, the bound SM directly impedes SNARE disassembly by Sec18. Second, the SM augments the SNARE complex's fusogenic activity. Third, by accelerating fusion, the SM shortens the pre-fusion complex's lifetime, thereby shortening its temporal exposure to disassembly by Sec18 (kinetic partitioning; <a href=\"#bib28\">Hardy and Randall, 1991</a>). In this view of fusion, SMs function as true enzymes: they bind and stabilize on-pathway intermediates, protect these intermediates from side reactions, and accelerate the conversion of intermediates to end products. Crucially, this model predicts the annihilation of pathway-specific fusion when SMs are deleted from living cells\u2014a result that holds across many different organisms and fusion pathways. When SM function is compromised, pre-fusion SNARE complexes should be less fusogenic, persist for longer times, and be more exposed to premature disassembly by Sec17 and Sec18 (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>, reaction v)."

Kinetic proofreading entails a sequence of independent, driven discrimination events. For SNARE-mediated fusion in vivo, there would be a minimum of two discrimination events. First, the nucleation of the <i>trans-</i>SNARE complex (an intermediate analogous to a Michaelis complex) has significant but not absolute intrinsic selectivity, derived mainly from packing interactions at the core of the SNARE bundle. Second, on-pathway SNARE bundles are positively selected by SM proteins. Sec17 detects the general shape and charge distribution of assembled SNARE bundles (<a href=\"#bib46\">Marz et al., 2003</a>), while SMs identify pathway-specific SNARE configurations, protecting them from Sec18 and augmenting their forward fusogenic activity. Error products\u2014off-pathway, incorrectly assembled, or damaged SNARE complexes\u2014would not be efficiently bound by SMs (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>, reaction v).

Moreover, certain R-SNAREs (Nyv1, Snc2, Sec22) drive fusion with non-cognate Q-SNAREs (<a href=\"#bib49\">McNew et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Izawa et al., 2012</a>). Compartment-specific tethers confer additional selectivity by accelerating the forward rate of cognate SNARE pairing, but this may not be sufficient. Normal cellular transactions are replete with opportunities to assemble erroneous SNARE complexes that could drive inappropriate fusion or trigger unregulated and irreversible organelle aggregation. For example, mammalian endosomes progressively associate with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) until 98% of late endosomes and lysosomes are adjacent to ER, generally within 30 nm or less (<a href=\"#bib24\">Friedman et al., 2013</a>).

The requirement for physiological (warm) temperatures in our in vitro assays may explain in part why SM\u2013Sec17\u2013SNARE interactions were not previously detected. In vivo, the relevant transitions may occur in a concerted manner; alternatively, they may involve ratchet-like sequential SM association with a series of SNARE assembly intermediates, with each sub-step traversing a smaller energy barrier. The central cavities of SMs are proposed binding sites for SNARE helical bundles and vary in the sizes of their openings, implying conformational flexibility (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bracher and Weissenhorn, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bar-On et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Baker et al., 2013</a>). Our observations provide new empirical support for models in which SM proteins and perhaps SNAREs must undergo substantial conformational transitions to productively associate.

Hence, the increased rate of binding at higher temperatures. Perhaps pre-heating the SM protein alone first would increase the rate of binding when subsequently added to Sec17-SNARE complexes (or SNARE complexes alone), this could indicate that the conformational change is restricted to the SM protein only. Other issues to address \u2013 note that we do not consider it as essential to carry out additional experiments to address them \u2013 they are for your consideration and/or editorial changes."

Similarly, I consider it as problematic to carry out re-assembly kinetics in such a manner \u2013 the bands are barely visible (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>) and only become convincing after adding an approx. 6fold excess of soluble SNAREs, and kinetic resolution is poor. Furthermore, it is conceivable that binding of SM-proteins to a preassembled complex including SNAREs and alpha-SNAP may nonspecifically prevent access of the bulky Sec18p protein (that may not be able anymore to enter the pores of the resin) rather than blocking access to the SNARE complex. For these reasons I suggest to carry out at least one or two control experiments in solution or with the Qa-SNARE being incorporated into the membrane of liposomes."

Hence, the increased rate of binding at higher temperatures. Perhaps pre-heating the SM protein alone first would increase the rate of binding when subsequently added to Sec17-SNARE complexes (or SNARE complexes alone), this could indicate that the conformational change is restricted to the SM protein only</i>."

The results show that pre-incubation of Sly1 at 30\u00b0 C versus lower temperatures has no effect on the subsequent efficiency of Sly1 binding to the SNARE-Sec17 complex. This indicates that elevated temperature does not induce a time-stable binding competence to Sly1 or the other proteins in the system, and is consistent with the interpretation that binding requires Sly1 or perhaps another molecule in the system to equilibrate between two states: a sparsely-occupied (higher-energy), binding-competent state, and a densely-occupied (lower-energy), binding incompetent state. Elevated temperature would increase the rate of inter-conversion between these states, elevating the rate of productive complex formation."

There are multiple types of cooperativity, among which one may delineate at least two classical cases (Ptashne, 2007). The first case is positive conformational cooperativity (allostery), exemplified by the affinity increase that occurs as molecules of O2 sequentially bind hemoglobin. The second case is simpler and more general: the combined effect of multiple binding sites (avidity). It is exemplified by binding of monomeric phage \u03bb repressor to its individual DNA operator half-site, versus the considerably stronger binding of \u03bb repressor to its native palindromic operator, resulting from a low-affinity dimerization interface on the repressor protein. This type of cooperativity can in principle occur solely through rigid body interactions, or it can be coupled to conformational dynamics. Although we do not yet have a deep mechanistic understanding of how SM-Sec17-SNARE assembly occurs, the present experiments strongly support this more general kind of cooperative assembly. We removed the word \u201chighly\u201d to more precisely convey what can, and cannot yet, be said about the mechanisms that drive this assembly reaction."

Vps33 does not have an N-peptide binding pocket and does not interact with the N-peptide of Vam3. Moreover, Vam3 does not enter into a closed conformation and the N-terminal domains of Vam3 are nonessential for Vam3 function (Dulubova et al., 2001; <a href=\"#bib43\">Lobingier and Merz, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Baker et al., 2013</a>; Wang et al., 2001; Laage and Ungermann, 2001). Similarly, yeast Sec1 does not interact with Qa-SNARE N-peptide (<a href=\"#bib77\">Togneri et al., 2006</a>). Thus, interactions between SM proteins and Qa-SNARE N-peptides are not universal and, where they do occur, they are not consistently important for SM function. If there is indeed a general function of SM proteins in SNARE-mediated fusion, that function cannot generally depend on Qa-SNARE N-peptide interactions. Nevertheless, it is still possible that Sed5 N-peptide binding to Sly1 initiates a conformational change that regulates Sly1 assembly dynamics, as suggested for Vps45 and for mammalian Sly1 (Furgason et al., 2009; Arac et al., 2005)."

With only cytoplasmic domains (but not transmembrane segments and the associated membranes), it is inappropriate to identify the complexes studied here as either cis or trans."

These trans-complexes are zipped to packing layer +3 or +4; we and others have presented strong evidence that Sec17 can functionally and physically interact with these trapped trans-complexes (<a href=\"#bib68\">Schwartz and Merz, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib88\">Xu et al., 2010</a>). Moreover, single-molecule laser tweezers experiments with neuronal SNARE complexes are fully consistent with the interpretation that pre-fusion complexes zipper to layer +3 or +4 (Gao et al., 2012). Thus, \u223c70% of the SNARE bundle can be fully folded in the pre-fusion trans-complex."

Consequently, it is still unclear whether Sec17, SMs, or both operating in concert, can discriminate in functionally meaningful ways between cis- and trans-SNARE complexes. However, we emphasize that functional experimentation with liposomes initially prompted the hypothesis that SM proteins protect trans-SNARE complexes from premature disassembly (<a href=\"#bib44\">Ma et al., 2013</a>; Mima and Wickner, 2009; <a href=\"#bib50\">Mima et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib88\">Xu et al., 2010</a>). Our preferred working model focuses on SM and Sec17 association with pre- versus post-fusion complexes, because that interpretation is most consistent not only with the present in vivo and biochemical experiments, but with functional studies published by other laboratories. If our working model inspires experiments that cause it to be supplanted by a better model, it will have served its purpose."

In previous work, SNARE complexes were assembled on the full cytoplasmic domain of Sed5 \u2013 including the Sed5 N-peptide, which Sly1 binds with low-nM affinity. Because the on-rate for this high-affinity binding interaction is fast (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8e</a>), the slower on-rate of Sly1 binding to the SNARE core bundle would have been obscured by the high-affinity Sly1-N-peptide interaction in previously published experiments. The slow on-rate of Sly1 (and of Vps33) binding to SNARE core bundles could reflect a requirement for another protein or a small molecule that accelerates binding, or it could reflect the initial recruitment of the SM to a SNARE assembly intermediate. These issues were raised at length in the original Discussion. In the current submission, the text has been modified for greater clarity."
