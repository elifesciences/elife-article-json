As a first step towards the high-throughput diagnosis of ultra-rare developmental diseases we introduce an automatic approach that implements recent developments in computer vision. This algorithm extracts phenotypic information from ordinary non-clinical photographs and, using machine learning, models human facial dysmorphisms in a multidimensional 'Clinical Face Phenotype Space'. The space locates patients in the context of known syndromes and thereby facilitates the generation of diagnostic hypotheses. Consequently, the approach will aid clinicians by greatly narrowing (by 27.6-fold) the search space of potential diagnoses for patients with suspected developmental disorders. Furthermore, this Clinical Face Phenotype Space allows the clustering of patients by phenotype even when no known syndrome diagnosis exists, thereby aiding disease identification. We demonstrate that this approach provides a novel method for inferring causative genetic variants from clinical sequencing data through functional genetic pathway comparisons."

As a first step towards the high-throughput diagnosis of ultra-rare developmental diseases we introduce an automatic approach that implements recent developments in computer vision. This algorithm extracts phenotypic information from ordinary non-clinical photographs and, using machine learning, models human facial dysmorphisms in a multidimensional 'Clinical Face Phenotype Space'. The space locates patients in the context of known syndromes and thereby facilitates the generation of diagnostic hypotheses. Consequently, the approach will aid clinicians by greatly narrowing (by 27.6-fold) the search space of potential diagnoses for patients with suspected developmental disorders. Furthermore, this Clinical Face Phenotype Space allows the clustering of patients by phenotype even when no known syndrome diagnosis exists, thereby aiding disease identification. We demonstrate that this approach provides a novel method for inferring causative genetic variants from clinical sequencing data through functional genetic pathway comparisons."

Nevertheless, tools to accurately assign functional and disease relevance to sequence variants are substantially lacking. Projects that apply next generation sequencing to patients in clinical settings fail to report genetic diagnoses for approximately 80% of cases (<a href=\"#bib19\">de Ligt et al., 2012</a>). The difficulty lies in identifying the causal variant in an individual patient: even when ignoring experimental error, each individual carries approximately 4 million differences, in the case of whole genome sequencing, relative to the reference genome. Computational analyses currently are able only to interpret the \u223c2500 variants that alter protein sequence at evolutionarily conserved positions and \u223c400 very rare variants that are likely to be causal for pathogenic processes (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abecasis et al., 2012</a>). Notably, of the \u223c10% of the genome that is functional all except the 1.2% that is protein-coding is often disregarded (<a href=\"#bib62\">Weischenfeldt et al., 2013</a>). Therefore, the prediction of causal inherited variants in an individual can result in high false positive and high false negative rates."

However, this approach relies on at least two individuals with the same disorder being available for comparison, an unlikely event given that these two individuals are selected for comparison from the roughly 100 million people affected by rare developmental disorders (prevalence of less than 2 per 100,000 around the world) (<a href=\"#bib43\">Orphanet, 2013</a>). For the past 65 years, clinical geneticists have studied, diagnosed, and characterized developmental disorders on the basis of common characteristics among patients (<a href=\"#bib49\">Rimoin and Hirschhorn, 2004</a>). When a given causal variant is ultra-rare, however, this presents substantial difficulties. Consequently, to realize the full potential of next generation sequencing in clinical diagnostics, phenotypic characterization must also become correspondingly high throughput and sensitive (<a href=\"#bib31\">Hennekam and Biesecker, 2012</a>)."

The computational analysis of facial morphology using 3D imaging has been applied to conditions such as fetal alcohol syndrome (<a href=\"#bib56\">Suttie et al., 2013</a>), schizophrenia (<a href=\"#bib15\">Buckley et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Hennessy et al., 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib32\">2007</a>) and autism (<a href=\"#bib2\">Aldridge et al., 2011</a>). While 3D imaging studies have shown high discriminatory power in terms of classification they have relied on specialized imaging equipment and patient cooperation. Previous work with 2D images has relied on manual annotation of images, controlling lighting, pose and expression to allow consistent analyses. These factors greatly limit the availability, and ultimately the potential widespread clinical utility of such approaches."

To do so we provide a new representation ('Clinical Face Phenotype Space'), which is an application of computer vision and machine learning algorithms for analyzing craniofacial dysmorphisms from ordinary photographs. We have ensured that Clinical Face Phenotype Space is robust to spurious variations such as lighting, pose, and image quality which would otherwise bias analyses. The approach is fully automated and provides objective and consistent computational descriptions of facial gestalt. Our method both greatly narrows the search space for investigating known disorders and will increase the power of inferring causative variants in previously unidentified genetic disease."

We have shown that individuals with the same underlying genetic disease automatically cluster in Clinical Face Phenotype Space. We next tested whether disorders caused by mutations in different genes result in meaningful clusters in Clinical Face Phenotype Space. We selected disorders with a known genetic origin, using either gene associations from OMIM or publications describing the identification of causative genes (see 'Materials and methods'). For each pair of genes, the shortest path in a protein\u2013protein interaction network was obtained from Dapple (<a href=\"#bib50\">Rossin et al., 2011</a>), giving a protein interaction distance relevant to that gene pair. We compared genes underlying monogenic syndromes linked by 1, 2, or 3 path distances, with those with a path distance of 4 or that was unknown; unknown distances are those where no genes are associated with a syndrome, the syndrome is multigenic, or when DAPPLE has no known interaction documented, see 'Materials and methods'. For each pair of syndromes, an average Euclidean distance in Clinical Face Phenotype Space was calculated. The distance in Clinical Face Phenotype Space is significantly shorter between syndromes associated to genes with protein interaction distances of 1, 2, or 3 compared with syndromes with 4 or no known interactions (p&lt; 0.01, p&lt; 0.05 and p&lt; 0.001 respectively, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>).

Given the orders of magnitude lower dimensionality of our data as compared to a 3D imaging capture (<a href=\"#bib28\">Hammond et al., 2005</a>), we were initially concerned that this would be insufficient to capture facial phenotypes. However, we then demonstrated that the approach is able to describe and discriminate between syndromes with a comparable accuracy to previous studies (<a href=\"#bib39\">Loos et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Hammond et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Hammond, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Boehringer et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Dalal and Phadke, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Vollmar et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Boehringer et al., 2011</a>). The accessibility of normal 2D photographs (as opposed to 3D imaging) should outweigh any lower data resolution obtained from any one image and in future developments using multiple profile perspectives will allow 3D structure to be inferred. With accurate registration of a person's face from multiple images across time, from a family photo album for instance, it would capture not only the 3D structure but also the progression and development of dysmorphic gestalt. The automatic image analysis algorithm enables phenotypic metrics to be obtained with objective consistency from each image (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>)."

(2) The spectrum of phenotypes represented was limited. (3) The average image quality in the database was low. (4) The current 36 facial feature points only capture full frontal facial phenotypes, and thus miss valuable information from the full cranium and profile perspectives. Among the approaches that will be tested in future work are: increasing the number of feature points across the cranium, using profile images and taking advantage of multiple images of the same individual. Furthermore, we will be exploring performing explicit modelingmodeling of the 3D variation for 2D images (<a href=\"#bib45\">Ramnath et al., 2008</a>), other types of feature descriptors, alternative metric learning and dimensionality reduction approaches (<a href=\"#bib54\">Simonyan et al., 2013</a>).

This was then used to transform the feature space with Large Margin Nearest Neighbor (LMNN, <a href=\"#bib61\">Weinberger and Saul, 2009</a>). LMNN is an optimization algorithm that uses a training set of pairs of vector labels (x<sub>i</sub>; l<sub>i</sub>) and learns a Mahalanobis distance that maximizes the kNN classification over a training set. Note that even if the system only considers local information (i.e., number of intruders for each instance) the final metric is global. The Mahalanobis distance was computed as dist(x<sub>i</sub>; x<sub>j</sub>) = (x<sub>i</sub> \u2212 x<sub>j</sub>)<sup>t</sup>L<sup>t</sup>L(x<sub>i</sub> \u2212 x<sub>j</sub>) where L is a linear matrix. It is equivalent to the Euclidean distance taken in the space after transformation by L. That is to say, LMNN linearly transforms dimensions in feature space to maximize the margins separating classes of labeled instances. This should, in principle expand dimensions with phenotypically relevant information and compresses dimensions uninformative for classification."

We synthesized 5 test faces at random moving along the first 15 components of both the shape and appearance models. For each face, we generated a set of 20 images for each combination of 5 head rotations and 4 lighting conditions. We use these simulated images to compare similarity measures in the raw feature space and in Clinical Face Phenotype Space (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). We performed a reorientation of the raw feature vectors and Clinical Face Phenotype Space using PCA without dimensionality reduction in order to sort the dimensions by variation magnitude. This allowed us to assess the relative contributions of phenotypic variation and spurious variations to clustering of faces. The strongest influences on clustering would be expected to be encoded in the first modes of variation. Placing the synthetic faces in the reoriented spaces allowed us to describe the PCA signatures of phenotypic variations (shape, appearance) and spurious variation (lighting, head pose)."

Firstly, we assigned a syndrome classification based on the identity of its k nearest neighbors in Clinical Face Phenotype Space. Based on the neighbors' labels a list of syndromes to which the new face could belong was created. The number of neighbors supporting each hypothesis was compared with the probability to see N instances of that syndrome when sampling k from the population of faces in Clinical Face Phenotype Space."
