We conducted a forward genetic screen of chemically mutagenized flies to identify short-sleeping mutants and found one, <i>redeye</i> (<i>rye</i>) that shows a severe reduction of sleep length. Cloning of <i>rye</i> reveals that it encodes a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor \u03b1 subunit required for <i>Drosophila</i> sleep. Levels of RYE oscillate in light\u2013dark cycles and peak at times of daily sleep. Cycling of RYE is independent of a functional circadian clock, but rather depends upon the sleep homeostat, as protein levels are up-regulated in short-sleeping mutants and also in wild type animals following sleep deprivation. We propose that the homeostatic drive to sleep increases levels of RYE, which responds to this drive by promoting sleep."

We conducted a forward genetic screen of chemically mutagenized flies to identify short-sleeping mutants and found one, <i>redeye</i> (<i>rye</i>) that shows a severe reduction of sleep length. Cloning of <i>rye</i> reveals that it encodes a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor \u03b1 subunit required for <i>Drosophila</i> sleep. Levels of RYE oscillate in light\u2013dark cycles and peak at times of daily sleep. Cycling of RYE is independent of a functional circadian clock, but rather depends upon the sleep homeostat, as protein levels are up-regulated in short-sleeping mutants and also in wild type animals following sleep deprivation. We propose that the homeostatic drive to sleep increases levels of RYE, which responds to this drive by promoting sleep."

Mutant flies had normal circadian rhythms, suggesting that their sleep problems were the result of disrupted sleep/wake homeostasis. Consistent with this, levels of redeye showed two daily peaks, one corresponding to night-time sleep and the second to the time at which flies would normally take an afternoon siesta. This suggests that redeye signals an acute need for sleep, and then helps to maintain sleep once it is underway."

The function of sleep is a mystery, but it is surely of great importance to animals, as prolonged sleep deprivation can lead to death. Anatomical studies in mammals and birds have revealed brain structures and neurotransmitters that regulate sleep and wakefulness (<a href=\"#bib23\">Saper et al., 2010</a>). However, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that drive the need to sleep is still in its infancy, partially due to the challenge of performing genetic experiments with mammalian models. In the past decade, several premier genetic organisms have been introduced into the sleep field, including fruit flies, worms and zebra fish. Mammalian counterparts of some sleep components identified in these model animals also regulate sleep (<a href=\"#bib8\">Joho et al., 2006</a>), which argues that (i) behavioral genetics in lower organisms provides an efficient tool to identify sleep components, (ii) at least some of the mechanisms underlying sleep are conserved through evolution."

Process C (the circadian clock) controls the timing, in other words the onset and offset of sleep, whereas process S (the sleep homeostat) regulates sleep duration based on the sleep pressure built up during prior wakefulness (<a href=\"#bib2\">Borbely, 1982</a>). This simple model explains sleep related phenomena, including sleep rebound after sleep deprivation. Molecular mechanisms of circadian control have been well characterized (<a href=\"#bib30\">Zheng and Sehgal, 2012</a>), but, as noted above, relatively little is known about process S. Forward genetic screens in <i>Drosophila</i> have led to the identification of several mutants with altered sleep length, but while the genes implicated by these mutants are required for implementation of sleep drive, they have not yet been directly linked to this drive (<a href=\"#bib24\">Sehgal and Mignot, 2011</a>)."

The <i>rye</i> mutation maps to a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR), which interacts with a previously identified sleep-regulating protein, SLEEPLESS (SSS). Levels of RYE are expressed cyclically, in conjunction with the sleep state, and reflect sleep need such that they are up-regulated after sleep deprivation and in short-sleeping mutants. We conclude that homeostatic sleep drive promotes sleep at least in part by increasing expression of RYE."

To this end, we generated a stock of iso31 (<a href=\"#bib22\">Ryder et al., 2004</a>) flies carrying a newly isogenized third chromosome and treated males of this stock with 10\u201325 mM ethyl-methanesulfonate (EMS). Individual male progeny were bred to achieve homozygosity of the third chromosome, and females of the F3 generation were tested for daily sleep patterns in the presence of light:dark cycles (<a href=\"#bib9\">Koh et al., 2008</a>). As seen in previous screens (<a href=\"#bib9\">Koh et al., 2008</a>), sleep amounts were normally distributed in the 1857 lines assayed (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>). Two homozygous mutant lines showed a severe reduction of sleep length, and we focused on one of these that we named <i>redeye</i> (<i>rye</i>). <i>rye</i> homozygotes show a &gt;50% reduction in both daytime and night-time sleep (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). The activity (average number of beam crossings during periods of activity) of <i>rye</i> mutants is comparable with that of wild type controls, suggesting it is not a hyperactive mutant (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). <i>rye</i> heterozygotes have slightly less sleep than wild type, suggesting that the <i>rye</i> mutation is partially dominant (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a>). The dramatic reduction of baseline sleep results largely from a shortening of the average sleep episode duration (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>), which is indicative of a defect in sleep maintenance. The average number of sleep episodes at night is actually increased significantly in <i>rye</i> mutants, perhaps because the sleep homeostat senses sleep loss and compensates by initiating more bouts. We also assayed <i>rye</i> mutants in sleep deprivation assays and found that they did not lose much additional sleep in response to mechanical stimulation (data not shown). We surmise that an inability to sustain sleep bouts leads to the buildup of high sleep need in <i>rye</i> mutants, which makes them resist any further sleep loss."

These endogenously generated rhythms are best monitored under constant conditions, in the absence of cyclic environmental cues, so we monitored behavior in constant darkness (DD). <i>rye</i> mutants display robust rest:activity rhythms in DD (\u223c62% rhythmicity) despite showing prolonged duration of activity (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>; <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Of the \u2018arrhythmic\u2019 <i>rye</i> homozygotes detected, half (6/11) actually displayed a rhythm of \u223c12 hr period length, which likely resulted from persistence of bimodal behavior (typically seen in light:dark) in DD. Thus, most <i>rye</i> homozygotes are rhythmic. Consistent with the intact circadian behavior, circadian cycling of the clock protein, PERIOD (PER), is normal in central clock cells of <i>rye</i> mutants. The peaks and troughs of expression, as well as the subcellular localization, at different times of day are similar to those in <i>iso</i> controls (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Thus, PER is largely nuclear at ZT20, entirely nuclear at ZT2, expressed at low levels at ZT8 and undetectable at ZT14.

                                "text": "We identified the sleep-altering lesion in <i>rye</i> mutants through a combination of recombination mapping and deep-sequencing. Despite starting with a newly isogenized line, deep-sequencing identified many nucleotide changes in the <i>rye</i> background relative to the parental control and so considerable mapping was required to pinpoint the relevant mutation. Meiotic recombination analysis positioned <i>rye</i> between two genetic markers, <i>thread</i> and <i>curled,</i> in the centromeric region of the 3<sup>rd</sup> chromosome. Further mapping studies, using self identified single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers, narrowed it down to \u223c11 mega-bases (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>, <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 1</a>). For finer localization, we utilized the genome-wide sequence data, which provided 40\u00d7 and 10\u00d7 genomes worth of nucleotide sequence, corresponding to 95% and 88% coverage, for the <i>rye</i> and <i>iso31</i> genomes respectively. Following alignment with the published <i>Drosophila</i> genome, unique nucleotide polymorphisms present in <i>rye</i> mutants were pooled together as potential EMS-induced mutations (n = 26,224). Within the 11 Mb region identified through recombination mapping, there were 1457 potential mutations, but only nine that produced an amino-acid change in coding regions. Sanger sequencing allowed us to exclude seven of these. Two turned out to be deep-sequencing errors and five polymorphisms were also present in the wild type <i>iso</i> stock but not detected due to the low coverage of deep-sequencing in this stock. One polymorphism, in a gene annotated CG7320, was at a site that was also polymorphic in <i>iso</i>, although the amino acid change was different in the two strains. Because of the change in <i>iso</i>, which does not produce a sleep phenotype, we considered CG7320 a less likely candidate for <i>rye</i>. The last of the nine changes identified by deep-sequencing was a C-T transition (typical for EMS-induced mutations) that leads to a threonine to methionine change in CG12414 and is present only in <i>rye</i> mutants (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). CG12414 encodes an \u03b1 subunit of a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAchR) (<a href=\"#bib12\">Lansdell and Millar, 2000</a>). Five alternatively spliced variants produced by this gene are predicted to generate three possible open reading frames with one (pC/pG) containing an intact ligand bind domain (LBD) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). The predicted protein is homologous to several nAChR subunits, including \u03b13, \u03b12, \u03b16, \u03b14 and \u03b17 in order of similarity.

To drive expression in areas that normally express this gene, we cloned the CG12414 promoter region (1.8 kb) and generated a GAL4 construct. This GAL4 is expressed broadly in the <i>Drosophila</i> brain (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). We also cloned the CG12414 cDNA into a UAS construct and crossed the GAL4 and UAS transgenes into an <i>iso</i><sup><i>31</i></sup> stock to ensure a homogenous genetic background. These transgenes were then introduced into <i>rye</i> mutants. While either transgene alone did not alter the <i>rye</i> short sleep phenotype, the <i>rye</i> promoter driving RYE expression (<i>ryeP</i> &gt; <i>uas-rye</i>) partially rescued the mutant phenotype and restored total sleep to levels seen in <i>rye</i> heterozygotes (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). This is expected, given that <i>rye</i><sup>T227M</sup> is partially dominant over wild type. In a wild type background, <i>ryeP &gt; uas-rye</i> does not increase sleep length (data not shown), suggesting that the increase in sleep is specific to the mutant.

It is most similar to the mammalian Lynx-1 protein, which is known to inhibit activity of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (<a href=\"#bib18\">Miwa et al., 2011</a>). The fact that SSS exacerbated the phenotype of flies heterozygous for <i>rye</i>, which have reduced activity of nAChR, suggested that SSS also regulates nAChRs. We tested a possible Lynx-1-like function of SSS in regulating nAChR activity by using a heterologous expression system, specifically <i>Xenopus laveis</i> oocytes. For functional expression of wild type RYE, we expressed it with a human \u03b22 subunit, as insect \u03b2 subunits typically do not work in heterologous systems (<a href=\"#bib17\">Millar and Lansdell, 2010</a>). cRNAs encoding <i>sss</i>, wild type <i>rye</i> and human \u03b22 were injected into oocytes, and 4\u20137 days later whole cell currents were measured following application of ACh (<a href=\"#bib11\">Kuryatov and Lindstrom, 2011</a>). Heterologous expression of insect nAChRs has, in general, been challenging (<a href=\"#bib16\">Millar, 2009</a>), which accounts for the low current values observed (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). However, we still detected a significant reduction of nAChR current upon co-expression with SSS (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). We also co-expressed in vitro transcribed <i>sss</i> and human \u03b14 and \u03b22 subunits and found that SSS also inhibits the robust current produced by the human receptor complex (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). Thus, in addition to its sleep-promoting role reported previously, SSS may also promote wake by repressing activity of nAChRs. As discussed below, loss of the sleep-promoting role has a dominant effect in <i>sss</i> mutants."

On western blots, the antibody recognizes a band (or sometimes a doublet) of \u223c60 Kd, which is the size predicted for the full-length isoform. Surprisingly, in contrast to the flat mRNA levels, levels of RYE protein show a robust rhythm with two peaks each day, one at around ZT6-10 and the other at ZT18-22 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Interestingly, these correspond to the two daily times of sleep, the afternoon siesta and night-time sleep (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), suggesting that RYE is expressed in phase with sleep. The cycling of RYE persists in constant darkness, as do rhythms of sleep (data not shown). However, RYE does not appear to be regulated like other cycling clock components, such as PER, which usually show only one peak (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Furthermore, we found that RYE continues to cycle in <i>Clk</i><sup><i>jrk</i></sup> flies that lack a circadian clock, although the phase of RYE expression tends to be more variable in these flies (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). These data suggest that the RYE oscillation per se does not require process C of the two process model, but may depend upon process S (sleep homeostasis). However, the circadian clock may function to provide more precise timing of RYE expression, perhaps through its control of sleep onset and offset."

Given that RYE levels do not remain high throughout the night or through the afternoon siesta, another possibility is that elevations in RYE correspond to sleep drive and so occur at the time of sleep onset. To test this idea, we assayed RYE expression in short-sleeping mutants. These mutants have low sleep levels, but probably have high sleep drive that cannot be implemented. As shown in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>, for the most part RYE expression exhibits two peaks in these mutants, but the phase is more variable (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplements 1\u20133</a>), indicating that defects in sleep behavior affect the RYE expression pattern. Interestingly, overall RYE values are higher in <i>fumin</i> (<a href=\"#bib10\">Kume et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Ueno et al., 2012</a>), <i>sss</i> (<a href=\"#bib9\">Koh et al., 2008</a>) and <i>insomniac</i> (<a href=\"#bib26\">Stavropoulos and Young, 2011</a>) mutants than in wild type controls. As noted above, the <i>sss</i> mutation affects channel activity, <i>fumin</i> is a mutation in the dopamine transporter (short sleep is thought to result from the high levels of dopamine in the synaptic cleft) and <i>insomniac</i> is thought to affect protein turnover. The one feature these mutants have in common is short sleep, yet they all have elevated RYE expression during an LD cycle (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A\u2013C</a>). Based upon these data, we suggest that RYE reflects sleep need. It is elevated at the time of sleep onset and is further increased in short-sleeping mutants because they have high sleep need."

In addition to the investigation of mechanisms underlying sleep drive, considerable effort is being put into identifying biomarkers of sleep need. Based on what we know about the so-called sleep homeostat, which consists of increasing sleep pressure during wakefulness and dissipation of such pressure following sleep, we suggest that a component or direct output of the homeostat should satisfy three criteria: (i) the gene product should regulate the sleep:wake cycle (i.e., genetic alleles of this gene should have some sleep phenotype); (ii) expression levels or activity of the gene product should go up during wakefulness or during sleep deprivation and (iii) expression levels or activity should decrease after sleep. The function of RYE and the molecular kinetics of the RYE protein largely satisfy these criteria. However, while RYE builds up during sleep deprivation, it does not accumulate gradually over the wake period in a daily cycle. Rather, it displays a marked increase close to the time of sleep onset, suggesting that it is not a central component of the homeostat, but responds to an upstream homeostatic signal, perhaps when that signal reaches a certain threshold. The fact that over-expression of RYE does not promote sleep also supports the idea that it is not the sleep-inducing homeostatic signal (further discussed below). Nevertheless, RYE is not simply a sleep output gene or sleep biomarker. It is required for implementation of signals from the homeostat and it functions to maintain sleep. Thus, we propose that <i>rye</i> is a sleep-regulating gene immediately downstream of the homeostat."

Recently, a few other molecules were reported to change with sleep drive, but the effects were at the level of the mRNA, the magnitude of the increase was less than we report here for RYE and loss of the molecules did not affect baseline sleep duration (<a href=\"#bib25\">Seugnet et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Maret et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Naidoo et al., 2007</a>). In addition, only one is expressed cyclically (<a href=\"#bib20\">Nelson et al., 2004</a>), indicating that others reflect sleep drive only under pathological conditions of sleep deprivation. RYE levels oscillate robustly in a daily cycle, although the phase is not as coherent as seen for circadian clock proteins. The timing of the peak varies within a temporal range, such that there is almost always a daytime peak and a night-time peak but not necessarily at the exact same time (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We suggest that RYE cycles under control of the sleep homeostat, which may not time behavior as precisely as the circadian clock, perhaps because sleep can be influenced by many factors. The variability in RYE cycling is particularly pronounced in short-sleeping mutants and in the <i>Clk</i><sup><i>Jrk</i></sup> circadian clock mutant (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>, <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplements 1\u20133</a>), suggesting that the clock does influence RYE expression although it is not required for its cycling in an LD cycle. Interestingly, RYE cycles exclusively at the level of the protein, indicating translational or post-translational mechanisms. It is worth noting that a recently identified sleep regulator, Insomniac, is a component of specific protein degradation pathways in the cell (<a href=\"#bib26\">Stavropoulos and Young, 2011</a>). Although our study indicates that RYE cycling does not require Insomniac (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>), it is possible that it is regulated by other protein turn-over machinery. Thus, translational/posttranslational regulation appears to be part of the mechanism of sleep homeostasis."

However, transgenic expression of <i>rye</i> in a wild type background does not increase sleep, suggesting that while <i>rye</i> is necessary, it is not sufficient for sleep onset. We cannot exclude the possibility that RYE functions together with other signals as part of the sleep-inducing homeostatic drive. On the other hand, it is also possible that transgenic expression does not produce adequate amounts of RYE protein in relevant cells. This might be the case if RYE is tightly regulated at the level of protein stability. For the moment, though, we prefer the parsimonious explanation noted above, that RYE is not part of the homeostat, but immediately downstream of it."

In contrast, our study indicates that at least one nAChR subunit (RYE) promotes sleep in the fly. There are more than 10 paralogs of nAChR subunits in the fly genome. One possibility is that RYE is expressed specifically in sleep promoting neurons, while other subunits of AChRs are in wake-promoting cells. An increase in ACh during wakefulness may contribute to the accumulation of sleep drive and to the increase in RYE (<a href=\"#bib13\">Lindstrom, 2003</a>). Alternatively, sleep drive may increase RYE independently of ACh, but in either scenario, RYE then promotes sleep. The precise site of RYE action is currently not known. <i>rye-gal4</i> driven GFP is expressed widely in the brain (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), but we cannot be sure that endogenous RYE is as widespread, as our antibody was not effective in immunohistochemistry experiments, and we find that GAL4 drivers are often quite promiscuous (unpublished observations)."

An interaction between <i>rye</i> and <i>sss</i> is therefore not surprising. What is surprising is that overexpression of SSS promotes wakefulness in <i>rye</i><sup><i>T227M</i></sup> heterozygotes (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>). SSS is a GPI-anchored protein that functions as a neuronal modulator. Previous studies indicate that SSS promotes activity of the voltage-gated potassium channel, Shaker (<a href=\"#bib29\">Wu et al., 2010</a>). In this study, we report that SSS acts like a brake on nAChR (RYE) activity (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C,D</a>), as does Lynx-1, a SSS-like molecule, in mammals (<a href=\"#bib18\">Miwa et al., 2011</a>). Although the data we show for <i>Drosophila</i> receptors used only the RYE \u03b1 subunit, it is likely that SSS also inhibits activity of other <i>Drosophila</i> nAChR receptors. As both <i>sss</i><sup><i>P1</i></sup> (a null mutation) and <i>sss</i><sup><i>P2</i></sup> (a hypomorphic allele) are short-sleeping mutants (<a href=\"#bib9\">Koh et al., 2008</a>), we propose that the overall effect of SSS is to promote sleep. The reduced sleep in <i>sss</i> mutants probably results from an increase of neuronal excitability, through inactivation of potassium channels (Shaker) (<a href=\"#bib5\">Dean et al., 2011</a>), or from hyperactivity of nAChR channels in wake-promoting neurons. Thus, typically the sleep-inhibiting effect of SSS, mediated through RYE, is masked by these other more dominant influences. However, in a sensitized background (i.e., <i>rye/+</i>), this effect is evident. RYE promotes sleep, and so loss of RYE results in a decrease in sleep, which is further impacted by SSS overexpression (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>)."

For instance, the <i>rye</i><sup><i>T227M</i></sup> allele could confer a neomorphic function that accounts for the interaction with <i>sss</i>. Likewise, the effects in oocytes could be non-physiological, not necessarily reflecting what happens in the fly brain. However, given that we observe interactions in these two very different types of assays, and both assays indicate repression of nAchR function by SSS, which is the effect predicted from the role of the mammalian SSS-like protein, Lynx1, we believe SSS does indeed regulate nAchRs such as RYE. Interactions between SSS and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are also reported by recent work from another laboratory (W Joiner, personal communication)."

Given that each of these genes represents a relatively infrequent hit in an unbiased screen, the interactions suggest that genetic approaches are converging upon specific sleep-regulating pathways. Interestingly, a recent GWAS study for sleep-altering loci in humans identified significant effects of SNPs in an nAchR subunit as well as in a regulatory subunit of Shaker, suggesting that these mechanisms are also conserved across species (<a href=\"#bib1\">Allebrandt et al., 2013</a>)."

After defolliculation, oocytes were incubated at 18\u00b0C in 50% L15 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 units/ml penicillin, and 10 g/ml streptomycin at 18\u00b0C. 3\u20136 days after injection, whole-cell membrane currents evoked by acetylcholine were recorded in oocytes at room temperature with a standard two-electrode voltage-clamp amplifier (Oocyte Clamp OC-725; Warner Instrument, Hamden, CT). Recordings were performed at a holding potential of \u221250 mV. All perfusion solutions contained 0.5M atropine to block responses of endogenous muscarinic AChRs that might be present in oocytes. Acetylcholine was applied by means of a set of 2-mm glass tubes directed to the animal pole of the oocytes. Application was achieved by manual unclamping/clamping of a flexible tube connected to the glass tubes and to reservoirs with the test solutions. The recording chamber was perfused at a flow rate of 15\u201320 ml/min. cRNAs for human AChR subunits 4 and 2 and <i>Drosophila sss</i> were synthesized in vitro using SP6 RNA polymerase (mMESSAGEmMACHINETM, Ambion).

RYE levels therefore potentially represent an important new biomarker for sleep deprivation. The reviewers also felt that the data on the interaction of <i>rye</i> and <i>sss</i> were the weakest part of the paper and that without deeper investigation the precise interpretation of those experiments was difficult. While it would be satisfying to have mechanism, this study is still quite important without a full understanding of the interaction of <i>rye</i> and <i>sss</i>.

The fact that now combining them results in even less sleep suggests a simple additive and independent effect of each manipulation on sleep. Second, there are no data on RNAi of RYE + OE of SSS. It is possible that the SSS effect is specific to the mutant allele because it has neomorphic function and that SSS may not regulate WT RYE."

While the existence of such a homeostat is well supported by sleep behavior, the molecular basis has remained mysterious, and therefore this manuscript presents an important entry point for such a molecular analysis. The experiments are thorough, well controlled and convincing. The mutation affects a subunit for the nicotinic acetyl choline receptor, and the fact that a protein identified as mutated in a previously isolated short-sleeping mutant (<i>sss</i>) is shown to negatively regulate RYE is important because it suggests that the genetic analysis of sleep in <i>Drosophila</i> may be identifying some mutants in a single genetic pathway \u2013 something that has not been clear thus far. One perhaps could have hoped that this manuscript would also reveal the signals that lead to upregulation of RYE (i.e., more about the pathway for the sleep homeostat), but this will undoubtedly require more years of work by multiple labs."

For one thing, the phase for RYE expression is not right. A factor which directly responds to S should build up during wakefulness and dissipate during sleep, but RYE accumulates when the flies are asleep and only dissipates towards the end of sleep. While this feature of RYE expression alone might suggest that RYE accumulates during sleep to measure sleep recovery and promote waking, the short-sleep phenotype of the mutant and the elevated levels of RYE in various short-sleep mutants and under conditions of sleep deprivation are not consistent with this alternative (so it does seem that RYE is part of the process S). Another interesting feature is that RYE overexpression in a wild type genetic background does not alter sleep, which is inconsistent with a factor that directly drives the S process (this should elevate or phase advance sleep). The authors note this paradox and postulate that RYE overexpression may not be sufficient to induce sleep, or may not produce higher levels of RYE in the relevant cells (perhaps overexpressed proteins is not stable in these cells). Along these lines, perhaps RYE can only accumulate when the S process reaches a threshold that triggers sleep, and then RYE remains high until sleep debt is dissipated. Consideration of these points needs to be added to the Discussion; if nothing else, there needs to be more discussion of the phase of RYE expression and its relationship to its postulated role in the sleep homeostat."

The authors do a very commendable job of isolating, identifying, characterizing and defining this mutation and in so doing further establish <i>Drosophila</i> as a powerful platform to study the biochemical and genetic basis of sleep. The authors convincingly show that loss of Rye leads to a short-sleeping phenotype that can be rescued partially by adding back Rye in a domain circumscribed by a newly generated Rye-GAL4 driver line and weakly phenocopied using RNAi. What is most interesting though is that the Rye protein (assayed using newly generated Rye antibodies) cycles during the day and is most prominently present just before sleep onset, is elevated by sleep deprivation and in several short-sleeping mutants such as sleepless, insomniac and fumin, but is not controlled by the clock machinery. These are hallmarks of a true \u201csomnogen\u201d; however, Rye fails in one test, i.e., artificially increased expression of Rye does not promote sleep. Even so, it seems clear that as the authors suggest, Rye is part of the sleep homeostat and is necessary but not sufficient for sleep drive. This is a very interesting study and is suitable for publication in <i>eLife</i>. One area that could have been investigated a bit more deeply is that of the tissue-specificity of Rye. The authors use the Rye-Gal4 and yet suggest that the expression pattern of this GAL4 line may not reflect that of endogenous Rye expression. Given the large number of extant GAL4 lines and some understanding of the sleep circuitry in <i>Drosophila</i>, it might have been instructive to test a few of these (e.g., pan neuronal, dopaminergic neurons, fan shaped body etc) to define the tissue-restricted requirement of Rye, if any. This could be most simply achieved using RNAi (though the phenotypes are arguably weaker than Rye mutants), selective rescue of Rye phenotypes using the UAS-Rye transgene, or perhaps even attempting to test if strong Rye over-expression in neuronal subsets might induce sleep (due to either stronger over-expression than Rye-GAL4 or a circuit-specific effect of Rye elevation). A minor point is the difference in the timing of the first peak of Rye between wild type and clock mutants (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6 B and C</a>). Do the authors think this is relevant or is the peak of Rye temporally more loosely defined than, say, clock proteins? Overall, this is an excellent manuscript and one of the few that describes a protein that is clearly correlated with sleep drive. Mechanistic associations with sleepless and channel activity further highlight the importance of this protein in sleep regulation."

While the existence of such a homeostat is well supported by sleep behavior, the molecular basis has remained mysterious, and therefore this manuscript presents an important entry point for such a molecular analysis. The experiments are thorough, well controlled and convincing. The mutation affects a subunit for the nicotinic acetyl choline receptor, and the fact that a protein identified as mutated in a previously isolated short-sleeping mutant (</i>sss<i>) is shown to negatively regulate RYE is important because it suggests that the genetic analysis of sleep in Drosophila may be identifying some mutants in a single genetic pathway - something that has not been clear thus far.

For one thing, the phase for RYE expression is not right. A factor which directly responds to S should build up during wakefulness and dissipate during sleep, but RYE accumulates when the flies are asleep and only dissipates towards the end of sleep. While this feature of RYE expression alone might suggest that RYE accumulates during sleep to measure sleep recovery and promote waking, the short-sleep phenotype of the mutant and the elevated levels of RYE in various short-sleep mutants and under conditions of sleep deprivation are not consistent with this alternative (so it does seem that RYE is part of the process S). Another interesting feature is that RYE overexpression in a wild type genetic background does not alter sleep, which is inconsistent with a factor that directly drives the S process (this should elevate or phase advance sleep). The authors note this paradox and postulate that RYE overexpression may not be sufficient to induce sleep, or may not produce higher levels of RYE in the relevant cells (perhaps overexpressed proteins is not stable in these cells). Along these lines, perhaps RYE can only accumulate when the S process reaches a threshold that triggers sleep, and then RYE remains high until sleep debt is dissipated. Consideration of these points needs to be added to the Discussion; if nothing else, there needs to be more discussion of the phase of RYE expression and its relationship to its postulated role in the sleep homeostat</i>."

The authors do a very commendable job of isolating, identifying, characterizing and defining this mutation and in so doing further establish</i> Drosophila <i>as a powerful platform to study the biochemical and genetic basis of sleep. The authors convincingly show that loss of Rye leads to a short-sleeping phenotype that can be rescued partially by adding back Rye in a domain circumscribed by a newly generated Rye-GAL4 driver line and weakly phenocopied using RNAi. What is most interesting though is that the Rye protein (assayed using newly generated Rye antibodies) cycles during the day and is most prominently present just before sleep onset, is elevated by sleep deprivation and in several short-sleeping mutants such as sleepless, insomniac and fumin, but is not controlled by the clock machinery. These are hallmarks of a true \u201csomnogen\u201d; however, Rye fails in one test, i.e., artificially increased expression of Rye does not promote sleep. Even so, it seems clear that as the authors suggest, Rye is part of the sleep homeostat and is necessary but not sufficient for sleep drive. This is a very interesting study and is suitable for publication in eLife. One area that could have been investigated a bit more deeply is that of the tissue-specificity of Rye.
