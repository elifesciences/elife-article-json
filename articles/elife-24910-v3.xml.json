Despite their complexity, listeners readily detect changes in these contexts. We here address the neural basis of statistical decision-making using a combination of psychophysics, EEG and modelling. In a texture-based, change-detection paradigm, human performance and reaction times improved with longer pre-change exposure, consistent with improved estimation of baseline statistics. Change-locked and decision-related EEG responses were found in a centro-parietal scalp location, whose slope depended on change size, consistent with sensory evidence accumulation. The potential's amplitude scaled with the duration of pre-change exposure, suggesting a time-dependent decision threshold. Auditory cortex-related potentials showed no response to the change. A dual timescale, statistical estimation model accounted for subjects' performance. Furthermore, a decision-augmented auditory cortex model accounted for performance and reaction times, suggesting that the primary cortical representation requires little post-processing to enable change-detection in complex acoustic environments."

Despite their complexity, listeners readily detect changes in these contexts. We here address the neural basis of statistical decision-making using a combination of psychophysics, EEG and modelling. In a texture-based, change-detection paradigm, human performance and reaction times improved with longer pre-change exposure, consistent with improved estimation of baseline statistics. Change-locked and decision-related EEG responses were found in a centro-parietal scalp location, whose slope depended on change size, consistent with sensory evidence accumulation. The potential's amplitude scaled with the duration of pre-change exposure, suggesting a time-dependent decision threshold. Auditory cortex-related potentials showed no response to the change. A dual timescale, statistical estimation model accounted for subjects' performance. Furthermore, a decision-augmented auditory cortex model accounted for performance and reaction times, suggesting that the primary cortical representation requires little post-processing to enable change-detection in complex acoustic environments."

For example, individual drops of water can add together to sound like rain or like a dripping faucet, depending on their number, rate, and relative timing (<a href=\"#bib48\">McDermott et al., 2013</a>). However, in real-life, listeners face a dynamic acoustic environment, where statistics do not remain constant for very long. Changes in the statistics of the sound of rustling leaves amidst the sounds of an ongoing storm, or changes in the acoustic composition of a busy cityscape, provide relevant information of putative threats. We investigate here determinants of human performance and their neural representation in these contexts, addressing the hypothesis that the behavior and neural representation are consistent with statistical estimation."

Without this estimate, the listener cannot distinguish between 'what to ignore' given the current statistics and 'what to recognize' as a change. Moreover, the quality of this estimate can influence the speed and certainty of detection, which are essential in real-life contexts. The present study thus investigates the factors influencing detection of deviations in sound statistics, and what the underlying dynamics of auditory sensory and evidence accumulation processes are in the human brain. For this purpose, listeners are presented with a continuous sound, whose statistics change at a random time. Hence, they are faced with the dual-task of estimating the baseline statistics and detecting a potential change in those statistics at any moment, which mimics real-life challenges."

A simple stimulus, governed by only few parameters, can be reliably estimated more quickly than a complex stimulus. We introduce a statistically controlled stimulus that combines simplicity with broad spectral distribution. In contrast to previous studies with narrow-band complex stimuli (<a href=\"#bib2\">Andreou et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Cervantes Constantino et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Overath et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Teki et al., 2013</a>), the sounds here form a minimalistic, but well-controlled model for natural, acoustic textures that are only defined by first order statistics. The task for the subjects was to listen to the texture of the stimulus (for a variable pre-change duration), and then signal the detection of a change in the texture as soon as possible."

As expected, detection performance also depended on the saliency of the change. EEG recordings from auditory projection sites show a strong response related to the onset of the sound, but did not exhibit a discernible response related specifically to the subsequent change in stimulus statistics. By contrast, EEG signals over parietal cortex appeared after the time of change, and displayed a build-up rate that depended on the size of the change (consistent with EEG responses in other evidence integration tasks, e.g. <a href=\"#bib52\">O\u2019Connell et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Kelly and O'Connell, 2013</a>). The peak amplitude of this potential also increased with change size, but decreased with pre-change interval, <i>i.e.</i> the time available to the subjects to sample the stimulus baseline statistics. Performance and reaction times were well predicted by a model of statistical estimation based on the difference in the outputs of two leaky integrators operating at fast and slow timescales. In addition, a model of auditory cortical processing (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chi et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Overath et al., 2008</a>) augmented with an accumulation-to-bound decision stage also accounted for the EEG responses and subjects\u2019 behaviors, thus suggesting that decision-making in such statistically complex acoustic environments may only require minor post-processing (channel-selection and averaging) beyond the early auditory cortex."

In a set of psychoacoustic experiments, listeners (n\u00a0=\u00a012) were presented with complex acoustic stimuli, whose statistics could change at a random time. Several parameters of the change were varied in order to estimate their influence on the change's saliency. In a different set of listeners (n\u00a0=\u00a018) EEG responses were collected to track the brain dynamics reflecting the accumulation of sensory evidence leading to the detection of a change in sound statistics. We propose a simple model to account for the listener's behavior, which is based on the estimation of stimulus statistics on two timescales. Finally, we suggest a neural implementation of this principle based on a model of auditory cortical processing."

Performance also increased monotonically to different asymptotic levels for the four tested change sizes (50, 80, 110, 140%, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>).

This translates to a combined steepening and leftward shift of the performance curves with change size.

Instead, the false alarm rate exhibits an initial linear increase, followed by a constant false alarm rate per unit time (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>), a feature that was embodied in the behavior of the models (see Figures 7E/8F). Furthermore, the initial rising portion of the false alarm rate is a consequence of the dual estimation task design. The uniform regime of false alarm rate is consistent with the use of an exponential distribution of change times, which keeps the change occurrence probability constant per unit of time (see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a> and Materials and methods)."

Such a change size dependence has been reported before (see <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> in <a href=\"#bib52\">O\u2019Connell et al., 2012</a>), and at first appears inconsistent with a fixed threshold. However, since the execution of the button press requires some time, the application of the threshold has to precede the button press by some delay. The observed difference in heights could thus reflect a continued accumulation of evidence at different slopes, during the time interval between decision commitment and response completion, until the execution of the decision is communicated to the CPP source. Consistent with this interpretation, CPP height did not exhibit a dependence on change size, if measured in a window of 200\u2013100 ms preceding the response time (p=0.16, same ANOVA, close to the crossing in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E2</a>).

For example, subjects could make their decisions based on the largest output produced by the change. These would be sampled from the filter with the temporal dynamics and spectral modulation that roughly matched those of the stimuli. The response thus selected is shown in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>.

In order to take into account the time-dependence of the CPP amplitude in the EEG recordings, we used a time-varying threshold that remained identical across all conditions (see <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a> and Materials and methods). The first peak exceeding this threshold (if any) was considered to be the decision point (purple arrow in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). This readout mechanism was fitted to the performance and false alarm rate across change sizes and change times by allowing five free parameters (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E\u2013F</a>): the (bandwidth) scale \u03a9, the (temporal) rate \u03c9, and the decision parameters (\u03bb, <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>; see Materials and methods). The parameters that best fitted the human dataset were \u03a9\u00a0=\u00a00.54 cycle/oct, \u03c9\u00a0=\u00a00.72 Hz (a rate corresponding approximately to dynamics or an integration time-constant of the order of 1\u20132 s), and <i>a</i>\u00a0=\u00a06.2, <i>b</i>\u00a0=\u00a010.8, and \u03bb\u00a0=\u00a01.14 s (\u03c1\u00a0=\u00a00.95; p&lt;5.10<sup>\u221216</sup>; MSE\u00a0=\u00a00.7%). The scale value corresponds to a full width at half-maximum for the scale filter of approximately 0.56 octave, very close to the frequency region spanned by localized changes (0.55 octave). This may indicate that subjects preferentially used a single scale value for monitoring the frequency modulation and that they estimated the most common frequency modulation across trials since half of the trials contained localized changes. Importantly, reaction times predicted by the model matched subject reaction times remarkably well both in distributional shape, mean and spread (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8G</a>), although the fitting procedure did not make use of this information (\u03c1\u00a0=\u00a00.90; p&lt;5.10<sup>\u221213</sup>; MSE\u00a0=\u00a09.1%)."

This is reminiscent of the observation that listeners detected changes more efficiently if their energy was concentrated in the frequency domain (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>).

Similar to the dual timescale model, the peak size of the decision signal increases with change size (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D</a>), unless interrupted by the threshold.

The results demonstrated that listeners estimated the statistics of the stimulus to make their decision, as evidenced by the dependence of performance, reaction times, and the CPP response on the stimulus parameters. We developed a drift-diffusion type model for estimating certain stimulus statistics, which accounted well for the response performance and dynamics in human listeners. Finally, we adapted a model of auditory cortical processing to provide a link between statistical estimation and the underlying physiology. The model accounted equally well for the human performance by exploiting a range of temporal filters, providing a potential, neurally plausible substrate for statistical decision-making. The decision signals of both models exhibit consistent integration behavior with the CPP potential."

Previous work has suggested a possible neural implementation of such a decision making process, in the form of competing neuronal populations, each corresponding to one alternative choice (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib29\">Insabato et al., 2014</a>). While this approach can in principle be extended to the estimation of other properties of a stimulus distribution, i.e. moments or correlations, it has to be adapted more specifically to each particular task.

The spectrotemporal filters implemented in the cortical model exhibit alternating excitatory (positive) and inhibitory (negative) fields (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>) that compare the spectral stimulus properties over a given time window set by a filter's temporal rate.

Previous studies using a linear increase of sensory evidence found a quadratic time progression of the centro-parietal potential. In the present task, the constant amount of evidence as function of time resulted in more linear dynamics of the centro-parietal potential, supporting the integration hypothesis. The task-irrelevant abrupt sensory event (i.e. the onset) was thus filtered out in the parietal EEG response while the task-relevant event (the change in statistics), although more subtle in nature, was selectively integrated and converted into a decision signal."

Consistently, we found the CPP slope and amplitude at the response time to be correlated with evidence level (change size). However, the amplitude was independent of reaction time, and did not depend on change size before the response time (200\u2013100 ms). Additionally, the amplitude of the CPP was found to be inversely related with change times, as one would expect if performance would be influenced by the estimated, maximal trial duration. Such a reduction would be expected both as a consequence of the general task design, i.e. on the one hand, the requirement to not respond to the onset of the first texture, and on the other hand, the possibility to approximate the maximal trial duration. For practical reasons, arbitrary trial lengths are not realizable. Hence, subjects could form an expectation of the maximal sound duration, which means participants could be subject to an urgency signal that would lower their criterion in this time-range."

Although it could in theory explain the time-dependence we observed for CPP heights, subjects did not exhibit any urgency to respond, even after a few seconds, as exemplified by the constant FA rate per unit of time (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). Instead, we propose that this decrease in threshold reflects a more sensitive criterion for change detection, via a more settled estimate of the initial statistics. The decision threshold would thus be dynamically adjusted during the course of a trial. Importantly, the lack of increase in FA rate suggests that the improved estimate of the initial statistics would also reduce the neural response to expectable deviations, such that the sensitivity (type I errors) stays at the same level."

As shown previously (<a href=\"#bib42\">Lewicki, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Smith and Lewicki, 2006</a>), natural statistics shape neural processing, and in a similar way should be informative about which changes to focus on in research.

We computed d\u2019 values to assess the ability to detect changes (<a href=\"#bib17\">Egan et al., 1961</a>), while taking their false alarm rate into account, as classically analyzed using signal detection theory. Due to the present task structure, d\u2019 could be computed as a continuous function of time from stimulus onset. We used the usual approximation d\u2019(t) = Z(HR(t)) - Z(FAR(t)), where Z(p) is the inverse of the Gaussian cumulative distribution function (CDF). HR(t) is the hit rate as a function of time since stimulus onset. HR was computed as the fraction of correct change detections, in relation to the number of trials with changes occurring at t (<a href=\"#bib45\">Macmillan and Creelman, 1991</a>). As detailed above, a correct detection had to occur within 2 s of the change time. Similarly, the false alarm rate FAR(t) was computed as the number of false alarms that occurred over all 2 s windows (starting at t), in which no change in statistics occurred. This created an artificial reaction time for each false alarm, that we used for comparing the distributions of the actual reaction times resulting from the Hits (<a href=\"#bib74\">Yin et al., 2010</a>). d\u2019 was computed for different times and change sizes, yielding only a limited number of trials per condition. To avoid degenerate cases (i.e. d\u2019 would be infinite for perfect scores), the analysis was not performed separately by subject, but over the pooled data. Confidence bounds (95%) were then estimated by bootstrapping within the dataset. The analysis was verified on surrogate data from a random responder (binomial with p=0.01 per time bin at 40 Hz sampling rate), providing d\u2019 close to 0 as expected."

The resulting auditory nerve signals undergo further spectral sharpening via a lateral inhibitory network. Finally, a midbrain model resulting in additional loss in phase locking is performed using short term integration with a time constant of 4 ms, resulting in a time-frequency representation (the auditory spectrogram z(t,f)) (top panel in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>).

Each filter h is tuned (Q\u00a0=\u00a01) to a specific rate (\u03c9 in Hz) of temporal modulations and a specific scale of spectral modulations (\u03a9 in cycles/octave), and a bidirectional orientation (+ for upward and - for downward).

Because changes were isotropic within the sound spectrum, we averaged the upward and downward components of the scale modulation filter. To simplify the analysis, we limited our computations to the real cortical outputs across frequency (i.e. responses corresponding to zero-phase filters).

To facilitate change detection on single trials, we post-filtered the modulation response R(t;\u03c9,\u03a9) using the average response to a change in statistics. Concretely, the shape of the trial-averaged response in R(t;\u03c9,\u03a9) was convolved with single trials, to improve detection of change. Due to the different modulation rates, the length of the average response shape varied by modulation rate <i>\u03c9</i> as 1/ (2<i>\u03c9</i>) ms. A unique combination of rate \u03c9 and scale \u03a9 was used across all trials to characterize the modulation response. Next, we implemented a decision criterion on top of the filtered R(t;\u03c9,\u03a9)."

The threshold parameters tune the balance between conservative and liberal decisions. To take into account this aspect we fitted both performance and false alarm rate across all subjects for all change sizes and change times. Motor-related delay was accounted for by a 250 ms offset added to the estimated reaction times, as was done for the phenomenological model."

For instance, even understanding what the stimuli were and what the listeners were being asked to do was a real challenge. The description of the stimulus design is quite lengthy-yet very hard to follow. Perhaps it would help to start with a more intuitive, descriptive explanation of <i>what</i> you did, <i>why</i> you did it, and what the task was measuring before (in sentence two of your Stimulus Design section) jumping directly to descriptions of probabilities and marginal distributions and what the exact range of frequencies was.

When you find a slow effect in an average, there is no way of knowing if activity is slowly accumulating within each trial, or if it is suddenly jumping from low to high at some point in time, but at different times, within each trial. In either case, you end up with an average that will look like a slow increase (see the recent paper by Jonathon Pillow on this topic). Many of the arguments about evidence accumulation rely on this aspect of the data. This weakness needs to be acknowledged and discussed."

Both offer some sort of insight into how this task might be solved, and can account for important characteristics of the dataset (including features that they were not explicitly modeled to fit). But it is not clear how the results of the cortical model relate to the accumulation dynamics. The cortical model seems to say that everything can happen in A1. But there is not any temporal integration function applied beyond A1, which seems discrepant with the CPP finding (unless the CPP comes from A1?). You address this briefly in the discussion, suggesting that the job of the CPP might be just to select and amplify certain accumulators, but these claims must be made more carefully with reference to the existing literature about the CPP signal. Because it is not clear how the two models are related, it is very hard to figure out what the take-away message is (e.g. how does the cortical model relate to the slow and fast approximation steps the statistical model?). What do we learn from having both? Do either (or both) generate testable predictions for further study? What experiments might be necessary to gather evidence for the statistical model's physiological instantiation? Either choose one model, which emphasizes what you want the reader to understand, or make clear how the models relate, and what each contributes to understanding the phenomena you observed."

Are the differences between brain regions maintained if the same analysis methods are applied to both sets of electrodes?

Another example of this kind of issue is in subsection \u201cEEG recordings and the site of decision-making\u201d, where you conclude that the representation in the CPP electrodes is less temporally precise than the auditory cortical one.

Specifically, your task may depend on detecting changes in the spectral envelope of a single object, which could explain why you do not see change-related signals in auditory cortex, although other researchers do. For example, in the Chait lab, where change-related cortical signals are observed, acoustic scenes likely are perceived as consisting of model multiple objects that appear or disappear. If your listeners do hear multiple sources, this needs to be explained to the reader; if they hear one object changing, then this needs to be explained, and the discussion of how your study relates to \"the real world\" modified."

Neither the previously characterized decision signal \"CPP\" nor the P300 to which it has been equated, to my knowledge, has ever been found with such an inferior topography. The overall problem is that the authors are using the presence of this ERP positivity and the effects of change time on its buildup as evidence supporting their claim that this task is accomplished through sensory evidence accumulation. But for this to work, it needs to be definitively and independently established that signal is in fact an evidence accumulator \u2013 otherwise, the argument is circular, i.e., the neural evidence for the improved change detection at later change times being a result of steeper evidence accumulation comes from the finding that an accumulator signal rises more steeply for later change times, but the sole basis upon which that signal is identified as an evidence accumulator is the fact that it rises more steeply for later change times! Clearly what is needed is an independent way to establish that the signal is an evidence accumulator. Shared properties with an established accumulator signal (CPP) gave at least partial support, but with the topography now so distinct I think the authors have lost this one piece of support. Source localizing to parietal cortex does not help much because parietal cortex in general has not been associated with decision formation any more than any other cognitive function, let alone with evidence accumulation in particular, and a parietal neural source certainly played no part in the CPP's identification as a decision signal."

All the authors would have to do to deal with the broader range of change times is to sort trials into change-time bins. In addition to these independent tests, more reliable analyses could be conducted to address many other unanswered questions in the paper about what the positive buildup signal is actually doing in the task, e.g., what temporal profile does the signal have during the baseline pre-change part of the stimulus \u2013 does it steadily build up reflecting the accumulation of information used to construct the baseline statistical distribution, or does the signal step up discretely as suggested by the current waveforms, and if so, why? And what is the signal actually reflecting with respect to the models, e.g. the sum of the two accumulators working on different timescales?

It is possible in principle that strong auditory-evoked negative activity more frontally causes the positive focus to shift back on the scalp, but this seems an unlikely explanation given that the CPP/P300 have been measured with the same centro-parietal topographies for many auditory tasks including ones containing continuous audio streams (O'Connell et al. 2012)."

This is a revision of a previous submission, based on new EEG data recorded during the exact same task as was physiologically characterized and modeled, and the results are now more definitive and highly interesting, including stronger evidence for accumulation (steeper buildup for stronger changes) and additional effects on peak amplitude of the neural index of accumulation. The concepts and hypotheses are now also laid out very clearly, with nice sections explaining predictions based on statistical estimation strategies. There are just a couple of substantive points that are important to clear up at this stage."

First, the topography of the effect of change size on amplitude should be shown, around the time of response, e.g. the largest change size minus smallest \u2013 does it have a similar CPP topography? This would go some way to verifying that the amplitude effects are not caused by an overlapping, separate process (e.g. slow fronto-central negativity). Also, since the baseline for the response-locked waveforms was 1000-1200ms prior to response, conditions with longer RTs are baselined relative to intervals further out into the stimulus; this is a potential confound because it could be that for lower change sizes, the hit trials are those in which the CPP waveform gets a head-start by accumulating noise or a false change, and so it has less of a distance to go to threshold when the actual change happens. Or given how long some RTs are for weaker changes, the \"head-start\" could be from genuine physical evidence! This would result in an amplitude decrease at response when using the current baselining regime, even in the absence of any change in bound. Therefore a pre-stimulus or a pre-change baseline should instead be used for the response-locked waveforms. It is important to see whether this changes the results. I would be fairly confident that the main effects hold up \u2013 the slope effects certainly will because baselining doesn't matter in that case. Nevertheless, these controls are important to rule out critical potential confounds."

Further, as the authors point out themselves, if bound were collapsing over time, false alarm rate should increase \u2013 it seems that this point should be weaved into the discussion of this effect more than it is.

As in other detection paradigms, some conditions are easy, leading to above chance performance, whereas others are designed to be very hard to detect. Because conditions were not presented in blocks, subjects could not be biased towards chance performance by balancing their perceptual reports to equate the change and no change responses within condition. This led to below chance performance for the hardest no-catch condition (50%) where subjects were missing a substantial proportion of change. If we were to continue the change time axis in both directions, we would expect to find a sigmoidal dependence, possibly not actually reaching 0 and 100% due to fatigue and unsystematic response errors. However, the average performance of these subjects across all non-catch conditions could well be 50%, however, the performance is systematically determined by the independent variable (change time here). We agree, that a higher level of performance would be more reassuring about the subject's strategy in all conditions, however, this would come at the cost of making the task easy for every parameter value, and thus losing the dependence of performance on variables of the task."

Neither the previously characterized decision signal \"CPP\" nor the P300 to which it has been equated, to my knowledge, has ever been found with such an inferior topography. The overall problem is that the authors are using the presence of this ERP positivity and the effects of change time on its buildup as evidence supporting their claim that this task is accomplished through sensory evidence accumulation. But for this to work, it needs to be definitively and independently established that signal is in fact an evidence accumulator \u2013 otherwise, the argument is circular, i.e., the neural evidence for the improved change detection at later change times being a result of steeper evidence accumulation comes from the finding that an accumulator signal rises more steeply for later change times, but the sole basis upon which that signal is identified as an evidence accumulator is the fact that it rises more steeply for later change times! Clearly what is needed is an independent way to establish that the signal is an evidence accumulator. Shared properties with an established accumulator signal (CPP) gave at least partial support, but with the topography now so distinct I think the authors have lost this one piece of support. Source localizing to parietal cortex does not help much because parietal cortex in general has not been associated with decision formation any more than any other cognitive function, let alone with evidence accumulation in particular, and a parietal neural source certainly played no part in the CPP's identification as a decision signal.</i>"

The potentials scalp location is hence consistent with previous reports (e.g. Twoney et al. 2015), although still slightly more occipital than some reports (O'Connell et al. 2012). These residual differences could be related to the complexity of the auditory stimulus, where a more complex stimulus (as presently used) may lead to a slightly more posterior signal from higher auditory cortex, which mixes with the generator of the CPP, or to some modality-specific changes in the localization of the generator (Dreo et al., 2016)."

On the other hand, converging thresholds have also been suggested in other decision theoretic accounts (Bogacz et al, 2009).

The x-axes of the current figures can easily be cut to zoom in on the main dynamics (e.g. the current 500-ms baseline shown before stimulus onset need only be 100 ms), so there should be room to squeeze them in between. This is important given that in places there are references to what happens to the CPP in response to the change, not just prior to response.</i>"

The axes widths were scaled correspondingly to keep the temporal relation between the plots. Correspondingly the Figure Supplement 3 has been removed. The parietal change-locked potentials exhibit similar dependencies on the stimulus parameters, however, the wide distribution of response times together with the response potentials leads to a more widely spread out potential shape than in our previous dataset. References to the change-time related plots have been inserted and all labels changed in text and captions."
