We screened a diverse chemical collection that included previously approved drugs for compounds that induced cold sensitive growth inhibition in the model bacterium <i>Escherichia coli</i>. Among the most cold sensitive was lamotrigine, an anticonvulsant drug. Lamotrigine treatment resulted in the rapid accumulation of immature 30S and 50S ribosomal subunits at 15\u00b0C. Importantly, this was not the result of translation inhibition, as lamotrigine was incapable of perturbing protein synthesis in vivo or in vitro. Spontaneous suppressor mutations blocking lamotrigine activity mapped solely to the poorly characterized domain II of translation initiation factor IF2 and prevented the binding of lamotrigine to IF2 in vitro. This work establishes lamotrigine as a widely available chemical probe of bacterial ribosome biogenesis and suggests a role for <i>E. coli</i> IF2 in ribosome assembly."

We screened a diverse chemical collection that included previously approved drugs for compounds that induced cold sensitive growth inhibition in the model bacterium <i>Escherichia coli</i>. Among the most cold sensitive was lamotrigine, an anticonvulsant drug. Lamotrigine treatment resulted in the rapid accumulation of immature 30S and 50S ribosomal subunits at 15\u00b0C. Importantly, this was not the result of translation inhibition, as lamotrigine was incapable of perturbing protein synthesis in vivo or in vitro. Spontaneous suppressor mutations blocking lamotrigine activity mapped solely to the poorly characterized domain II of translation initiation factor IF2 and prevented the binding of lamotrigine to IF2 in vitro. This work establishes lamotrigine as a widely available chemical probe of bacterial ribosome biogenesis and suggests a role for <i>E. coli</i> IF2 in ribosome assembly."

While there is a relatively thorough understanding of the structure and function of the ribosome during translation (<a href=\"#bib35\">Moore, 2012</a>), the molecular events underlying its assembly remain largely enigmatic. Ribosome biogenesis, which consumes up to 40% of the cell's energy in rapidly growing <i>Escherichia coli</i> (<a href=\"#bib32\">Maguire, 2009</a>), involves the coordinated transcription, modification, and folding of rRNA transcripts; translation, modification, and folding of r-proteins; binding of r-proteins to the appropriate rRNA scaffolds; and binding and release of ribosome biogenesis factors. In vivo, these events occur in parallel and represent a highly dynamic system of interrelated processes that occur cooperatively to narrow the assembly landscape of the ribosome (<a href=\"#bib21\">Holmes and Culver, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Williamson, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Kim et al., 2014</a>)."

Genetic perturbation has been the conventional route to probe the function of these proteins but has drawbacks. Genetic inactivation is typically permanent, often \u2018all or none\u2019 in scope, and for essential genes is fraught with the difficulty of creating conditional alleles. Further, due to the coordination of 30S and 50S subunit biogenesis, and regulatory feedback from the translational capacity of the cell (<a href=\"#bib53\">Yamagishi and Nomura, 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Gaal et al., 1997</a>), genetic probes of ribosome assembly are prone to wide-ranging impacts and pleiotropic phenotypes (<a href=\"#bib29\">Lerner and Inouye, 1991</a>)."

Such chemicals can exert their effects on a time scale of seconds and be added or removed from cell systems at will. Further, small molecules can be dosed to achieve varying levels of target inhibition and as such can be elegant probes of protein function. While existing antibiotics provide a surfeit of probes for on-going efforts to understand the mechanistic details of protein translation, no chemical probes exist for the study of ribosome biogenesis. Small molecule inhibitors of ribosome biogenesis could provide important new tools for the study of this complex process, particularly those events controlled by uncharacterized protein assembly factors. Additionally, chemical inhibitors of bacterial ribosome biogenesis might serve as leads for an entirely new mechanistic class of antibiotics (<a href=\"#bib13\">Comartin and Brown, 2006</a>)."

Using a diverse chemical library that included previously approved drugs and compounds of known bioactivity, we enriched for molecules that induced cold sensitive growth inhibition in the model bacterium <i>E. coli</i>. Indeed, numerous studies have revealed that genetic defects in ribosome assembly result in cold sensitive growth phenotypes (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bryant and Sypherd, 1974</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Dammel and Noller, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Jones et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Bubunenko et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Connolly et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Clatterbuck Soper et al., 2013</a>). We too performed validating efforts, reported herein, of the cold sensitivity of strains from the Keio collection, a comprehensive compendium of <i>E. coli</i> deletion strains. A subsequent chemical screen determined that the anticonvulsant drug lamotrigine induced a strongly cold sensitive growth phenotype. Treatment with this molecule resulted in the accumulation of immature ribosomal subunits in a time-dependent manner without inhibiting protein translation. Spontaneous suppressors of lamotrigine activity mapped exclusively to translation initiation factor IF2, encoded by <i>infB.</i> These mutations, found in the poorly characterized and evolutionarily divergent domain II of IF2, obviated the binding of lamotrigine to IF2 in vitro. This work establishes lamotrigine as a widely available chemical probe of bacterial ribosome biogenesis and suggests a role for <i>E. coli</i> IF2 in this process."

We looked for strains that were sensitized to growth at 15\u00b0C compared to 37\u00b0C (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). A cold sensitivity factor was subsequently generated for each clone, defined as the ratio of growth at 37\u00b0C to growth at 15\u00b0C, normalized to the mean growth ratio measured for the entire collection (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Strains that displayed a cold sensitivity factor in the top 3.5% (155 clones) were analyzed using clusters of orthologous groups (<a href=\"#bib48\">Tatusov et al., 1997</a>, <a href=\"#bib49\">2003</a>) to categorize the cellular function of each deleted gene (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>, <a href=\"#SD5-data\">Supplementary file 1A</a>). To highlight the relative proportion of genes in each functional class, the number of cold sensitive genes in each was divided by the total number of non-essential genes in that same category (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). This normalization procedure highlighted ribosome-related genes as exceptionally sensitive to low temperatures, as &gt;20% of genes in this functional class were found to be cold sensitive. Importantly, this screen was also successful in identifying the vast majority of previously reported cold sensitive ribosome biogenesis genes (<a href=\"#SD5-data\">Supplementary file 1B</a>), providing support that screening compounds for cold sensitivity would enrich for those related to ribosome function and biogenesis."

We note that the doubling time of wild-type <i>E. coli</i> at 15\u00b0C in LB media was 6 hr. Cultures were pulse labeled with [<sup>14</sup>C]-uridine immediately upon drug treatment to visualize the accumulation of newly synthesized particles. Since previous reports have shown that inhibitors of protein translation can cause accumulation of immature ribosomal particles (<a href=\"#bib41\">Siibak et al., 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib42\">2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Sykes et al., 2010</a>), we also tested a panel of antibiotics (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013D</a>) with known mechanism of action for comparison."

After 1 hr of treatment, small quantities of newly synthesized particles were present, and after 6 hr, cells had accumulated labeled ribosomal particles to near steady-state levels. Cultures treated with chloramphenicol (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>), erythromycin (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>), and tetracycline (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>) displayed a substantial accumulation of non-native ribosomal particles after just 1 hr of treatment, illustrating that inhibition of translation can indirectly inhibit ribosomal subunit assembly by limiting the availability of r-proteins. Interestingly, we found that the addition of 2\u00d7 MIC of vancomycin to <i>E. coli</i> resulted in a detectable perturbation of the ribosome profile (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). However, the presence of a \u223c40S particle after 6 hr of treatment is likely the result of cell lysis induced by the inhibition of peptidoglycan synthesis (Stokes and Brown, unpublished data). Treatment with lamotrigine resulted in the accumulation of non-native ribosomal particles after 1 hr of incubation and did so in a time-dependent manner (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>). Further investigations revealed that treatment of <i>E. coli</i> with 2\u00d7 MIC of lamotrigine for only 5 min (\u223c1% of the doubling time) caused a significant accumulation of these non-native particles (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G,H</a>).

The presence of immature 16S rRNA sedimenting in the pre-30S region suggested a heterogeneous composition of 30S particles at various stages of maturation. At the maximum of the 30S peak approximately 40% of 16S rRNA was unprocessed. The 16S rRNA found in fractions corresponding to the 70S subunit was &gt;95% processed, as expected. Overall, a similar trend was seen when analyzing the processing of 23S rRNA in the pre-30S, pre-50S, 50S, and 70S regions of the gradient; increasing sedimentation rate correlated with a decreased proportion of immature 23S rRNA relative to total 23S rRNA.

Furthermore, lamotrigine-treated cells displayed almost identical proportions of immature to total 16S rRNA in the pre-30S region, relative to DMSO-treated cells. Unlike DMSO-treatment, however, lamotrigine treatment resulted in the accumulation of immature 23S rRNA in the pre-30S and pre-50S regions. While the presence of unprocessed 23S rRNA in the pre-50S region strongly suggested an immature 50S subunit sedimenting at \u223c40S, its presence in the pre-30S region raised questions of whether the dominant species in the pre-30S peak (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>) was derived from 16S or 23S rRNA."

To answer this question, we quantified absolute cDNA fluorescence from 5\u2032 primer extension reactions (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Samples of rRNA purified from single fractions of sucrose gradients were reverse transcribed in parallel reactions using either the 16S- or 23S-specific primer. In this study, cDNA production is proportional to the amount of rRNA transcript in the sample and therefore reflects absolute quantities of each rRNA species (16S and 23S) present. The quantity of immature 16S rRNA from DMSO-treated cells was minor relative to cells treated with lamotrigine. This is consistent with previous reports, which have shown that immature ribosomal particles in unperturbed cells account for only a small proportion of total ribosomal material (<a href=\"#bib37\">Mulder et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Chen et al., 2012</a>). Furthermore, while immature 23S rRNA slowly accumulated in this region as a function of lamotrigine treatment length, immature 16S rRNA did so at a significantly greater rate. These results indicate that, by far, the major species of rRNA residing within the pre-30S region in lamotrigine-treated cells was unprocessed 16S rRNA. Thus, 5\u2032 primer extension results strongly suggested that lamotrigine treatment results in the accumulation of an immature 30S subunit that sediments at \u223c25S and an immature 50S subunit that sediments at \u223c40S."

Early-log cultures of <i>E. coli</i> grown at 15\u00b0C in <sup>14</sup>N-labeled LB media were treated with DMSO or 2\u00d7 MIC of lamotrigine for 6 hr, lysed, and the ribosomal particles were separated through sucrose gradients. Fractions spanning the pre-30S to the 70S regions were spiked with a fixed concentration of 70S ribosomes purified from cells grown in <sup>15</sup>N-labeled media. These spiked samples were then digested with trypsin and prepared for mass spectrometry. This approach resulted in multiple independent peptide measurements for each r-protein in every fraction (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2A,B</a>). Protein occupancy was calculated as <sup>14</sup>N/[<sup>14</sup>N + <sup>15</sup>N]. Direct inspection of the protein occupancy profiles revealed distinct patterns for early- (e.g., S15, L24) and late- (e.g., S3, L28) binding proteins. In the DMSO samples, all r-proteins within a given subunit displayed highly correlated occupancy patterns with maximal occupancy corresponding to \u2018peak\u2019 fractions as determined by rRNA absorbance (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). In contrast, treatment with lamotrigine resulted in significant occupancy of the early-binding proteins in pre-30S and pre-50S fractions, whereas the late-binding r-proteins exhibited relatively unperturbed profiles. Indeed, protein S15 is found at significantly greater occupancy in the pre-30S fractions upon lamotrigine treatment (dark blue). This effect on early binding proteins is particularly pronounced in the L24 profile with peak occupancy shifted six fractions earlier in the gradient (from orange to green). To facilitate further analysis, this large data set (\u223c20,000 measurements) was compressed to a 53-protein \u00d7 28-fraction heat map using the median protein occupancy value for each protein in each fraction (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>, <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a>).

Notably, this effect was enhanced in the lamotrigine-treated samples. The depletion of these proteins is consistent with prior in vivo analysis of small subunit biogenesis at 37\u00b0C, which found S2, S3, and S21 to be the latest-binding small subunit proteins (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Chen and Williamson, 2013</a>). Consistent with sucrose gradient traces monitoring UV absorbance and [<sup>14</sup>C]-uridine incorporation, we observed a subtle broadening of the 30S protein occupancy peak upon treatment with lamotrigine. Analysis of the leading edge of this peak revealed an enrichment of relatively early-binding proteins S13, S7, S16, S8, S15, S6, and S18, consistent with the presence of 30S subunit assembly intermediates in lamotrigine-treated cells. Inspection of large subunit protein occupancy revealed drastic changes as a result of lamotrigine treatment, resulting in the accumulation of an immature particle depleted of the late-binding r-proteins L35, L36, L16, L30, and L28 as well as earlier-binding proteins, L34, L6, and L21 (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2D</a>).

To distinguish between these possibilities, we used mass spectrometry to determine the occupancy pattern for the ribosome biogenesis factors RbfA and DeaD (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>). These proteins were completely absent from mature 70S particles, and thus we reasoned that their presence could be used as markers of immature particles. The 30S-specific maturation factor RbfA co-sedimented with the 30S particles in both DMSO- and lamotrigine-treated samples. Further, the 50S-biogenesis factor DeaD co-migrated with the pre-50S peak in the lamotrigine-treated samples and the 50S peak in the DMSO-treated samples. These data further suggest that the pre-30S and pre-50S particles are immature subunits and not the result of degradation of mature ribosomal particles."

Wild type and mutant forms of <i>E. coli</i> IF2 were purified and incubated with [<sup>3</sup>H]-lamotrigine in the presence of GDP or GTP. After incubation for 3 hr at 15\u00b0C, the reaction mixtures were passed through a pre-cooled Sephadex G-25 column, and the flow-through was collected and scintillation counted to detect the presence of lamotrigine-IF2 complexes. Lamotrigine was found to associate with wild-type <i>E. coli</i> IF2 in a G-nucleotide-dependent manner, with lamotrigine-IF2 complex formation favored in the presence of GDP over GTP (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). We note here that previous studies have not reported measurable GTP turnover by IF2 in the absence of ribosomal subunits (<a href=\"#bib39\">Severini et al., 1991</a>). Analyses of lamotrigine binding with mutant IF2 in the presence of GTP and GDP failed to reveal association (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Consistent with these results, lamotrigine was found to have activity solely against members of the Enterobacteriaceae (<a href=\"#SD6-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>), which is the only bacterial family that contains the domain II sequence outlined in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>. Interestingly, the potency of lamotrigine at 15\u00b0C against the Enterobacteriaceae was directly correlated with IF2-\u03b1 sequence homology, further suggesting that the sequence of domain II defines essential structural features for lamotrigine association (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1E,F</a>)."

Because the quantity of labeled subunits did not change as a function of the length of the chase, these particles likely represent fully mature subunits that have simply dissociated. Interestingly, DMSO-treated cells harvested immediately after the 3-hr pulse and before the addition of the chase show a slight decrease in the levels of complete 70S ribosomes relative to any of the samples harvested post-chase (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). This small but significant change likely results from the presence of an intracellular pool of [<sup>14</sup>C]-uridine, which is incorporated into 70S particles during the initial 30-min chase. This pool may consist of free nucleotides that are not washed away during the chase or, as described previously, may exist as transcribed rRNA that has not completed the assembly process (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chen et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Chen and Williamson, 2013</a>). Cells harvested at subsequent times during the chase period showed no change in the quantities of 30S, 50S, and 70S particles, indicating that all newly synthesized rRNA is incorporating exclusively non-labeled uridine.

Specifically, the levels of pre-30S and pre-50S particles decreased with a corresponding increase in 70S ribosomes. This trend continued throughout the 3-hr chase period, after which there were no apparent differences between DMSO-treated and lamotrigine-treated cells. Interestingly, after 1 hr of non-labeled uridine chase, a cluster of three particles that sedimented at approximately 40S (discussed above as the pre-50S), 45S, and 50S appeared.

Involving nearly 60 protein factors, the process is rapid, highly efficient, and studies to date suggest that assembly intermediates are elusive and do not accumulate in significant amounts (<a href=\"#bib37\">Mulder et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Chen et al., 2012</a>). The genetic inactivation of ribosome biogenesis factors has provided an opportunity to perturb the process in order to better understand the action of chemical modification and chaperone functions in the assembly process (<a href=\"#bib40\">Shajani et al., 2011</a>). Nevertheless, many of these factors are essential and resist genetic manipulation. Further, genetic inactivation has poor temporal resolution and is not ideally suited to probe the coordinated action of these factors in time and space. Indeed, our understanding of ribosome function has benefited enormously from a great number and variety of small molecule probes of chemical and conformational steps of protein translation (<a href=\"#bib50\">Tenson and Mankin, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Wilson, 2009</a>). Chemical inhibitors of the assembly process would similarly provide important new probes of ribosome biogenesis. Herein, we report the discovery and characterization of a small molecule inhibitor of ribosome assembly in <i>E. coli</i> under cold temperature growth conditions. The inhibitor, lamotrigine, is a widely available anticonvulsant drug whose target in <i>E. coli</i> is domain II of the initiation factor IF2. In all, this work provides the first small molecule probe of ribosome assembly and points to a novel role for IF2 in <i>E. coli</i> ribosome biogenesis."

The screen was inspired by numerous previous reports of cold sensitive mutants in ribosome-related genes and was validated with a screen of the <i>E. coli</i> Keio collection. In our screen of the Keio collection, ribosome genes were overwhelmingly enriched and, of the known cold sensitive ribosome biogenesis genes, we were successful in identifying the vast majority of these. We next screened a diverse collection of \u223c30,000 small molecules, including many known drugs and bioactive compounds, to identify growth inhibitory compounds with increased potency at 15\u00b0C relative to 37\u00b0C. Of 38 structurally diverse active compounds from this screen, lamotrigine induced the most profound cold sensitive growth inhibition. Sedimentation analysis revealed that lamotrigine induced the rapid accumulation of non-native ribosomal particles with apparent sedimentation rates of \u223c25S (pre-30S) and \u223c40S (pre-50S), prompting an in-depth analysis of their composition. Using 5\u2032 primer extension of rRNA and r-protein mass spectrometry, these particles were found to be immature 30S and 50S subunits, respectively. These immature subunits lacked r-proteins associated with the neck of the 30S subunit and the body of the 50S subunit around the L1 arm, central protuberance, and L11 arm (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2C,D</a>). With these regions encompassing the functional centers of each subunit, it is tempting to speculate that lamotrigine may perturb late steps in 30S and 50S subunit assembly. It has recently been suggested that these sites are among the last to mature (<a href=\"#bib22\">Jomaa et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Guo et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Li et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Jomaa et al., 2014</a>) consistent with this hypothesis."

Further, in vitro binding studies indicated that lamotrigine binds to IF2 in a nucleotide-dependent fashion and that suppressor mutations abrogated binding. Interestingly, domain II is conserved solely among IF2 proteins from the Enterobacteriaceae and has yet to be assigned a definitive function. Indeed, only one study suggests a role for this region in binding strongly to 30S, 50S, and 70S ribosomal particles relative to the other Enterobacteriaceae IF2 domains (<a href=\"#bib36\">Moreno et al., 1999</a>). While lamotrigine treatment resulted in the rapid accumulation of immature 30S and 50S subunits, the target IF2 led us to wonder if lamotrigine might be an inhibitor of protein translation. We speculated that the observed ribosome biogenesis phenotype might be an indirect effect of blocking r-protein production, as described previously for antibiotics known to inhibit translation (<a href=\"#bib41\">Siibak et al., 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib42\">2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Sykes et al., 2010</a>). Using multiple orthogonal approaches, both in vitro and in vivo, we were unable to detect any translational inhibition by lamotrigine even when using concentrations far above the MIC. These results were in contrast to assays with known translational inhibitors, including evernimicin, a known inhibitor of IF2-dependent 70S initiation complex formation."

In <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, eIF5B associates with immature 40S subunits in a translation-like checkpoint, wherein immature 40S particles bind to mature 60S subunits prior to final maturation. Given that pre-30S and pre-50S particles accumulate during lamotrigine stress, a bacterial model may include association of two immature particles prior to maturation of the functional centers within the 30S and 50S subunits. Alternatively, it is possible that IF2 is involved in the maturation of 30S and 50S subunits independently. Regardless of the precise events mediated by IF2, our data strongly support a central role for the enigmatic and divergent domain II of <i>E. coli</i> IF2 in the assembly of both subunits. Interestingly, our observations help rationalize the previously unexplained finding that overexpression of IF2 in a <i>\u0394yjeQ</i> background of <i>E. coli</i> partially suppresses the mutant slow growth phenotype and restores ribosome profiles to wild type (<a href=\"#bib9\">Campbell and Brown, 2008</a>). Similarly to lamotrigine-treated cells, the 30S particles of cells lacking YjeQ display significantly depleted occupancy of S21, S1, S2, and S3 (<a href=\"#bib22\">Jomaa et al., 2011</a>), suggesting that IF2 may perform an overlapping role in late 30S maturation during cold stress. Our results also parallel work dating back almost two decades, which showed that truncation of the N-terminus of <i>E. coli</i> IF2, containing domain II led to cold sensitive growth (<a href=\"#bib26\">Laalami et al., 1991a</a>, <a href=\"#bib27\">1991b</a>). With much of the machinery involved in ribosome biogenesis (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bharat et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Schaefer et al., 2006</a>) and translation (<a href=\"#bib1\">Anger et al., 2013</a>) conserved among bacteria and eukaryotes, the maintenance of IF2/eIF5B function in ribosome biogenesis through evolution is surely plausible. Given that domain II of IF2 is highly divergent, this work raises questions of how diverse bacterial species carry out the temperature-dependent functions of IF2 described herein. Domain II may have a purpose that is uniquely important to the Enterobacteriaceae under cold stress or, alternatively, species-specific proteins that mimic the N-terminus of IF2 from Enterobacteriaceae may perform this activity."

Cells were harvested at OD = 0.5 and lysed in buffer A (20 mM Tris\u2013HCl, 100 mM NH4Cl, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM EDTA, 6 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol; pH 7.5) using a mini bead beater. Clarified lysates (5 ml) were layered above a 5 ml sucrose cushion (20 mM Tris\u2013HCl, 500 mM NH4Cl, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM EDTA, 6 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, 37% sucrose; pH 7.5) and were spun for 22 hr at 37.2k rpm in a Ti 70.1 rotor. Pellets bearing 70S ribosomes were solubilized in buffer A at 4\u00b0C and saved at \u221280\u00b0C. Lamotrigine- and DMSO-treated ribosomal particles were separated on a sucrose density gradient and fractions were collected as described above. A mixed reference standard bearing 10 pmol of <sup>14</sup>N-labeled and 30 pmol of <sup>15</sup>N-labeled 70S ribosomal particles was added to 20 pmol of each experimental fraction. The use of this mixed reference ensured that every <sup>15</sup>N-labeled peptide bore a <sup>14</sup>N-labeled peptide pair irrespective of the abundance of that peptide in the experimental sample. Additionally, one sample bearing only the reference standard was mixed with an equal volume of buffer A. These samples were then prepared for LC/MS via precipitation, reduction, alkylation, and tryptic digestion as described previously (<a href=\"#bib23\">Jomaa et al., 2014</a>). Peptides were eluted from a C18 column using a concave acetonitrile gradient and detected using first an Agilent (Santa Clara, CA) G1969A ESI-TOF and second, to improve proteomic coverage and to identify non-ribosomal proteins, using an AB/Sciex (Framingham, MA) 5600 Triple-TOF run in MS<sup>2</sup> mode. In each case, the entire isotope distribution of each extracted MS<sup>1</sup> spectrum was fit using a Least Squares Fourier Transform Convolution algorithm (<a href=\"#bib43\">Sperling et al., 2008</a>) providing accurate quantitation of the <sup>14</sup>N and <sup>15</sup>N species' abundance. To account for the reference standard's contribution to the measured <sup>14</sup>N peptide abundance, each spectrum was normalized using the paired <sup>15</sup>N abundance. Having measured the reference standard alone in triplicate, we then subtracted these normalized spectra, resulting in the corrected peptide abundance for each peptide in each experimental sample. Data sets from the ESI-TOF and Triple-TOF were merged and filtered for interference from co-eluting peptides. As a proof of principle, a series of standards bearing various quantities of <sup>14</sup>N-labeled 70S particles were also analyzed to assess the linearity of our detection technique (<a href=\"#bib17\">Gulati et al., 2014</a>). Non-ribosomal proteins were quantified across the gradient using the aforementioned MS<sup>2</sup> Triple-TOF data sets. These data sets were acquired as IDA experiments with 200 ms MS<sup>1</sup> scans followed by 50 MS<sup>2</sup> scans, each with 50 ms of ion accumulation. Precursor ions were excluded from MS<sup>2</sup> analysis 12 s after one occurrence. In each fraction, spectral counts for each non-ribosomal protein were normalized to the total number of spectral counts in that fraction. These values were then normalized to the maximal spectral counts in any gradient fraction, and the occupancy profile was smoothed using a 3-fraction sliding Gaussian window."

These results are consistent with the conclusion that lamotrigine inhibits a cold sensitive event during ribosome biogenesis. As temperature decreases, the apparent role of IF2 in ribosome biogenesis becomes increasingly essential, thus increasing the growth inhibitory effect of lamotrigine. 15\u00b0C was selected in this study to maximize cold-induced ribosome biogenesis phenotypes while still permitting cell growth amenable to high-throughput screening in micro-well format.

Briefly, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a> illustrates the proportion of processed rRNA in various positions through the gradient. This proportion of processed rRNA is defined as [immature rRNA/total rRNA] for each species analyzed (either 16S or 23S). This is ideal for understanding the rRNA processing efficiency of individual ribosomal particles. However, as was seen in the pre-30S region of the gradient in lamotrigine-treated cells, we were able to purify measurable quantities of both 16S and 23S species that were unprocessed. Thus, to discern whether the dominant species residing within the pre-30S region was 30S or 50S in nature, we needed to determine absolute quantities of 16S rRNA species and 23S rRNA species (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>) originating from this region. Performing this experiment with 5\u2019 primer extension of both 16S and 23S rRNA in parallel from the same sucrose gradient fractions allowed us to conclude that the major species in the pre-30S peak was an immature 30S particle."

However, as evidenced by the significant accumulation of immature 16S rRNA in the pre-30S fractions, the effects on 30S assembly are profound in their own right. In the absence of a detailed mechanism for IF2 function in ribosome biogenesis, we have chosen to give equal weight to the effects observed on the 30S and 50S subunits. We contend that apparent assembly defects may be more pronounced in the large subunit simply as a result of the size and complexity of this subunit relative to the 30S. As a result of this complexity, even mild assembly inhibition may lead to the accumulation of the discrete particle we observe. Indeed, such effects have been observed upon depletion of a variety of assembly factors, some of which are non-essential. For example, deletion of SrmB results in the accumulation of a discrete 40S particle despite relatively mild effects on cellular growth rate (<a href=\"#bib35\">Moore, 2012</a>)."

Two thorough investigations by Laalami et al.
