Using genome-wide nucleosome mapping, we show that CTD S2 phosphorylation controls nucleosome dynamics in the promoter of a subset of 324 genes, including the regulators of cell differentiation <i>ste11</i> and metabolic adaptation <i>inv1</i>. Mechanistic studies on these genes indicate that during gene activation a local increase of phospho-S2 CTD nearby the promoter impairs the phospho-S5 CTD-dependent recruitment of Set1 and the subsequent recruitment of specific HDACs, which leads to nucleosome depletion and efficient transcription. The early increase of phospho-S2 results from the phosphorylation of the CTD S2 kinase Lsk1 by MAP kinase in response to cellular signalling. The artificial tethering of the Lsk1 kinase at the <i>ste11</i> promoter is sufficient to activate transcription. Therefore, signalling through the CTD code regulates promoter nucleosomes dynamics."

Using genome-wide nucleosome mapping, we show that CTD S2 phosphorylation controls nucleosome dynamics in the promoter of a subset of 324 genes, including the regulators of cell differentiation <i>ste11</i> and metabolic adaptation <i>inv1</i>. Mechanistic studies on these genes indicate that during gene activation a local increase of phospho-S2 CTD nearby the promoter impairs the phospho-S5 CTD-dependent recruitment of Set1 and the subsequent recruitment of specific HDACs, which leads to nucleosome depletion and efficient transcription. The early increase of phospho-S2 results from the phosphorylation of the CTD S2 kinase Lsk1 by MAP kinase in response to cellular signalling. The artificial tethering of the Lsk1 kinase at the <i>ste11</i> promoter is sufficient to activate transcription. Therefore, signalling through the CTD code regulates promoter nucleosomes dynamics."

Genes transcribed by the PolII show a stereotypical pattern of CTD phosphorylation with phospho-S5 (S5P) peaking near the transcription start site (TSS) and phospho-S2 (S2P) accumulating towards the 3\u2032-end of the transcribed region (<a href=\"#bib9\">Buratowski, 2009</a>). Despite discrepancies, genome-wide analyses of CTD phosphorylation support that the CTD cycle is uniform across genes (<a href=\"#bib31\">Kim et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Mayer et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Tietjen et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Bataille et al., 2012</a>), and a broad body of evidence supports the seminal role of CTD S5P and S2P in transcriptional regulation and chromatin metabolism (<a href=\"#bib9\">Buratowski, 2009</a>). However, recent works showed that contrary to S5P, S2P is dispensable in both fission yeast and budding yeast (<a href=\"#bib12\">Cassart et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Devos et al., 2015</a>) and only affects the steady-state level of a subset of mRNAs (<a href=\"#bib15\">Coudreuse et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Saberianfar et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Sukegawa et al., 2011</a>).

Set1 is the only H3K4 methyltransferase in yeast, but it produces monomethylation, dimethylation, and trimethylation states.

Here, we show that S2P affects promoter nucleosome occupancy at a subset of genomic loci. Mechanistic studies reveal that upon gene activation, the Sty1 MAP kinase directly phosphorylates the CTD S2 kinase Lsk1, which results in increased S2P nearby the promoter. We also show that the doubly phosphorylated S2P-S5P CTD has lower affinity for Set1 compared to the S5P CTD. Therefore, the peak of S2P at the promoter counteracts H3K4 methylation and the recruitment of histone deacetylases. Our results indicate that cellular signalling mediated by the PolII CTD directly controls promoter nucleosome dynamics and gene transcription of a subset of genes."

                                "text": "Authentic full-length <i>rpb1 CTD S2A</i> (<i>S2A</i>) mutants in fission yeast and budding yeast are viable (<a href=\"#bib15\">Coudreuse et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Schwer and Shuman, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Cassart et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Drogat and Hermand, 2012</a>) and are barely affected for steady-state transcription or termination (<a href=\"#bib37\">Lenstra et al., 2013</a>), suggesting that the function of S2P in the coupling between transcription and maturation is either not essential or ensured by redundant mechanisms. Yet, the transcription of a subset of genes is strongly defective in the fission yeast <i>S2A</i> mutant as typically shown for <i>ste11</i> that encodes the master regulator of sexual differentiation (<a href=\"#bib44\">Otsubo and Yamamoto, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Anandhakumar et al., 2013</a>), which results in sterility. In order to understand the molecular basis of this specific sensitivity of S2P, we performed a genome-wide screen for genetic interactions using synthetic genetic arrays (SGAs) with both the S2 kinase <i>lsk1</i> (<i>cdk12</i> that encodes the S2 kinase) deletion and the <i>S2A</i> mutant. Although both screens highlighted a genetic link between S2P and RNA maturation, about a third of the shared interactions found fell in chromatin remodelling and modifications (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1</a>). This genetic connection between S2P and chromatin biology led us to perform a genome-wide mapping of nucleosome position and occupancy by MNase-Seq. We used the DANPOS bioinformatics pipeline to analyze the data, which defines three categories of nucleosome dynamics: position shift, fuzziness change, and occupancy change. These analyses revealed that 3.8% of the nucleosomes were dynamics in the S2A mutant compared to the wt (based on a false discovery rate &lt;0.005), carrying mostly occupancy changes and position shifts (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 2</a>). Statistical analyses revealed that these dynamic nucleosomes are enriched in the promoter region encompassing \u2212350 bp to +50 bp flanking the TSS (p-value &lt; 2.2e-16, odds ratio = 2.82), and especially the \u22121 nucleosome (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, left panel). A meta-gene analysis of the nucleosome occupancy signal for all protein-coding genes revealed higher occupancy around the TSS in the S2A mutant, and an 11 bp shift of the average \u22121 nucleosome toward the TSS (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, middle panel). When selecting the 10% protein-coding genes whose promoter nucleosome-depleted region (NDR) shrinks the most in the absence of S2P (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>, right panel), the shift of the average \u22121 nucleosome rose to 44 bp (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, left panel). In contrast, the 10% protein genes with the lower decrease in promoter NDR did not show a similar effect. In addition, the genes showing promoter dynamic nucleosomes in the absence of S2P tended to have larger NDRs and 5\u2032-UTR (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 2</a>), two features reminiscent of the genes that we have previously characterized as showing a peak of S2P nearby the promoter during transcriptional activation (<a href=\"#bib15\">Coudreuse et al., 2010</a>), including <i>ste11</i> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). In addition, we found that the 10% genes whose promoter NDR shrinks the most in the S2A mutant are highly enriched in this list of genes showing early S2P (Fisher's exact test p-value = 0.0013, odds ratio = 2.6) and in genes downregulated more than twofold in the S2A mutant (Fisher's exact test p-value = 0.0057, odds ratio = 1.4)."

The deletion of <i>hos2</i> led to a marked derepression of <i>ste11</i>, while other single mutants somehow affected <i>ste11</i> but never to the extend of the loss of <i>hos2</i>. The Hos2 enzyme is part of the conserved SET3C deacetylase complex that is recruited in budding yeast by S5P either directly or through the methylation of H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) by Set1, which itself depends on the S5P (<a href=\"#bib42\">Ng et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Kim and Buratowski, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Govind et al., 2010</a>). ChIP experiments revealed that Hos2 peaks at the <i>ste11</i> promoter and that its recruitment was strongly dependent upon the S5-phosphorylated CTD as its occupancy was decreased in a CTD S5A mutant, which is kept viable by fusing the human capping enzyme Mce1 (<a href=\"#bib54\">Schwer and Shuman, 2011</a>) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Contrary, the absence of <i>lsk1</i> resulted in an increased occupancy of the Hos2 HDAC at the <i>ste11</i> promoter (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>), which likely explains the marked decrease in H3 acetylation observed when Lsk1 is absent.

Preliminary experiments revealed that the wild-type version was phosphorylated on both S2 and S5, while the S2A or S5A versions lacked the corresponding S2P or S5P, respectively (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). When expressed in a Set1-TAP strain, only the S2A version (S5 phosphorylated) could be immunoprecipitated by Set1-TAP. No interaction was observed with the S5A CTD version, confirming the dependency of Set1 to S5P to bind the CTD. Importantly, the doubly S2P-S5P phosphorylated CTD did not bind Set1-TAP, indicating that the presence of S2P interferes with the binding of Set1 to S5P (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>)."

All the phosphorylated residues are located within a long N-terminal extension that is present in all the Cdk12 orthologs but with low sequence conservation compared to the canonical C-terminal CDK domain (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). An N-terminal truncated version of Lsk1 rescues the thermosensitive defect of <i>lsk1</i> deletion and shows in vitro kinase activity similar to the <i>wt</i>, which suggests a regulatory rather than catalytic role for the N-terminal extension (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1C,D</a>). It was previously shown that the Sty1 MAP kinase (<a href=\"#bib52\">Sanso et al., 2011</a>) could phosphorylate Lsk1 in vitro (<a href=\"#bib58\">Sukegawa et al., 2011</a>). We confirmed and expanded these data and showed that 12 sites including loosely consensus sequences needed to be eliminated in order to abrogate the phosphorylation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). The deletion of the N-terminal region of Lsk1 (Lsk1 \u0394N) or the mutation of the 12 sites phosphorylated by Sty1 (Lsk1 12SA) severely impaired the induction of the <i>ste11</i> mRNA in a way reminiscent of the <i>sty1</i> deletion (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Contrary, the mutation of the four canonical MAPK sites to glutamic acid, mimicking constitutive phosphorylation, increased the level of <i>ste11</i> mRNA in both vegetative growth and differentiation suggesting that the Sty1-dependent signal transduction through the Lsk1 CTD kinase is a rate limiting step in <i>ste11</i> transcriptional regulation."

In the subset of genes we have analyzed, we propose that during transcriptional induction, the local increase of S2P nearby the promoter prevents the efficient association of Set1 with the S5P CTD (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). Interestingly, previous work revealed a spread of the Set1-dependent H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 marks 3\u2032 into the bodies of genes in the absence of Ctk1, the CTD S2 kinase in budding yeast (<a href=\"#bib64\">Wood et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Xiao et al., 2007</a>). These data were interpreted to mean that S2P phosphorylation acts as a barrier to prevent the CTD S5P-dependent association of Set1, which explain the restricted pattern of H3K4 dimethylation and trimethylation classically observed. We propose that the temporary, MAP kinase dependent, targeting of S2P at the promoter of target genes acts similarly. In this context, it was also shown that the presence of S2P upstream of S5P within a peptide abolishes the recognition by an anti-S5P antibody (<a href=\"#bib25\">Hintermair et al., 2012</a>), again suggesting that S2P somehow interferes with the recognition of the neighbour S5P, which we observe using an NLS-GST-CTD fusion expressed in vivo (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>)."

Upon induction of gene expression, the Sty1 MAP kinase is activated and phosphorylates the CTD S2 kinase Lsk1, which is required for an increase in S2P nearby the promoter.

A remaining question is why different HDAC complexes are required in the case of <i>ste11</i> and <i>inv1</i>. The Rpd3C(L) has been proposed to regulate transcriptional burst frequency, while the SET3C complex is thought to modulate the burst size (<a href=\"#bib27\">Hnisz et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Weinberger et al., 2012</a>), so the involvement of different HDAC complexes is likely related to gene-specific induction dynamics."

It was also reported that SET3C is directly recruited by the CTD S5P, whereas it is the interaction with methylated H3 that is required for the deacetylation activity (<a href=\"#bib22\">Govind et al., 2010</a>). Whatever the exact mechanism, the promoter occupancy of the HDACs complexes requires S5P. Considering the evolutionary conservation of all the proteins implicated in this model, we envision that the process may be operating at some target genes in other eukaryotes. In support to this view, the budding yeast S2 kinase, Ctk1, is also phosphorylated within the N-terminal region (<a href=\"#bib14\">Chi et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Breitkreutz et al., 2010</a>). The reported defect of the <i>ctk1</i> mutant for gametogenesis (<a href=\"#bib36\">Lee and Greenleaf, 1991</a>) led us to test the requirement of Ctk1 for the increased acetylation of promoter histones during the induction of the master regulator of meiosis, <i>IME</i><i>1,</i> in diploid budding yeast cells. The absence of <i>ctk1</i> abrogated the burst of promoter histones acetylation (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>) and resulted in low expression (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Remarkably, the defect observed in the absence of CTD S2P was suppressed by the deletion of the Set3 subunit of the SET3C HDAC complex (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), in agreement with the data obtained in fission yeast. These data, together with the recent discovery of a gene-specific role of Cdk12 in the control of gene expression in human cells (<a href=\"#bib7\">Blazek et al., 2011</a>), support the conservation of the molecular mechanism we report here, which opens further dissection in higher eukaryotes. Interestingly, in <i>Drosophila</i>, the UpSet protein, an ortholog of yeast Set3, also recruits Rpd3-containing HDACs to developmental genes and its PHD domain was proposed to recognize methylation on H3K4, establishing a dependency to Set1 (<a href=\"#bib48\">Rincon-Arano et al., 2012</a>, <a href=\"#bib49\">2013</a>). The most common phenotype associated with the deletion of UpSet occurs during gametogenesis, similarly to yeast."

Upon activation, the Sty1 MAP kinase phosphorylates the CTD S2 kinase Lsk1 on multiple sites spread over the long N-terminal extension of the kinase. We show that the phosphorylation of Lsk1 is required for the 5\u2032 peak of CTD S2P during the induction of the <i>ste11</i> and <i>inv1</i> genes, while it does not appear to be required for the kinase activity itself. This dependency on MAP kinase phosphorylation likely explains why only a subset of promoters is regulated in this manner. Considering that MAP kinases, including Sty1, are recruited to their target genes, they are likely to confer this specificity. Remarkably, the artificial tethering of the S2 kinase Lsk1 at the <i>ste11</i> promoter is sufficient to induce <i>ste11</i> expression, independently of nitrogen starvation and MAP kinase phosphorylation. Further studies are required to understand how the phosphorylation of the conserved N-terminal extension of the S2 kinase modulates its recruitment. Previous work revealed that MAPK signalling exerts a multilayered control on gene expression (<a href=\"#bib16\">de Nadal et al., 2011</a>). Our data demonstrate that MAP kinase also directly controls CTD phosphorylation, which expands the emerging theme that chromatin-associated proteins are key responders to environmental cues (<a href=\"#bib61\">Weiner et al., 2012</a>)."

Clonal reads (determined by their very high coverage compared to the mean coverage across the genome based on a Poisson p-value cut-off) were removed from the reads previously mapped on the <i>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</i> genome with BWA (<a href=\"http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/\">http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net</a>). Variation in size resulting from MNase treatment was compensated by shifting each read toward the 3\u2032 direction for half of the estimated fragment size. Nucleosome occupancy was then calculated as the quantile-normalized count of adjusted reads covering each base pair in the genome. After this processing, DANPOS calculates the differential signal at single nucleotide position based on a Poisson test. Dynamic nucleosomes are then identified by peak calling on these signals. TSS and TTS-associated NDR length were quantified as the length of the longest DNA segment whose proximal border is located closer than 65 bp from the TSS (or TES) with nucleosome occupancy levels lower than an arbitrary threshold (mean(occupancy<sub>genome</sub>) \u2212 standard_deviation(occupancy<sub>genome</sub>)) at any point."

The authors show that CTD S2 phosphorylation can block the recruitment of HDACs to promoters and thereby contribute to gene activation. Further, phosphorylation of kinase Lsk and its recruitment to promoters is growth regulated and under the control of MAP kinases. Mutation of MAP kinase specific phosphorylation sites in the N-terminal domain of Lsk prevents its recruitment to promoters, phosphorylation of CTD S2, and thereby the dissociation of HDACs from promoters. In line with these observations the authors can activate <i>ste11</i> expression after artificial tethering of LSK 1 at the <i>ste11</i> promoter. While the association of HDACs with promoters is CTD S5-P dependent the authors suggest that the combined phosphorylation of S5 and S2 can abolish this association, leading to hyperacetylation of chromatin and gene activation."

As expected the identified genes display a significant overlap, but it is troublesome that only single subunits of chromatin regulatory complexes were identified. Also, there is little evidence of a systematic enrichment of ATP-dependent chromatin remodellers, which regulate nucleosome dynamics. Surprisingly, the authors did not investigate the identified Rsc1 and Swr1 genetic interactions in any detail. Next, the nucleosome density is determined in the rpb1 <i>CTD-S2A</i>, but not in the <i>lsk1</i> deletion. Compared to wild type yeast the authors observe small differences in global MNase sensitivity and they make conclusions on nucleosome dynamics. This is highly surprising. Nucleosome dynamics is defined as nucleosome turnover or half-lives at specific genomic loci. Therefore, the conclusion that 'these analyses reveal an unexpected role of S2P in regulation nucleosome dynamic' is flawed."

Also, the reason to analyze involvement of the PAF complex (via the LEO1 gene) in CTD-S2 phosphorylation dependent regulation of <i>ste11</i> is not clear. The conclusion that 'defects in initiation or elongation cannot explain the increased level of histone H3 observed at the <i>ste11</i> promoter in the absence of S2P' is not substantiated, as the authors did not analyze RNA polymerase II occupancy at <i>ste11</i> in the CTD-S2A strain."

A synthetic lethal screen found many interactions between the S2A mutant or Lsk1/Cdk12 (S2 kinase) and chromatin-related factors. Nucleosome mapping revealed a subset of genes with altered nucleosome positions near promoters in these mutants. The rest of the paper focuses on one of these genes (<i>ste11</i>), with a few other experiments done on the <i>inv1</i> gene. The story then gets a little confusing. The model proposed is that these promoters are repressed by H3K4 methylation recruiting either SET3C or Rpd3L HDACs. To activate the genes, the MAPK Sty1 phosphorylates Lsk1, which in turn phosphorylates S2 near the <i>ste11</i> promoter to block H3K4 methylation and subsequent HDAC recruitment. It's a complicated model, and the many experiments needed to look at each of these steps makes the paper difficult to follow."

For example, our first conclusion is tested by mutating the phosphorylation sites of Lsk1 to a phosphomimmick or non phosphorylatable residues, which consistently uncouples the regulation of the S2 kinase from the MAP kinase (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). Beside several genetic evidences that CTD S2P is targeted to the promoters of some genes (<i>ste11</i> and <i>inv1</i>), we also engineered a chimeric S2 kinase that we can artificially tether to the <i>ste11</i> promoter, which results in transcriptional activation and bypasses the MAP kinase regulation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>).

We report a list of 324 genes that show dynamic changes at the -1 nucleosome in the <i>rpb1 CTD S2A</i> mutant. This list is highly enriched in genes we have previously identified as having an early CTD S2P profile (Coudreuse et al., Curr. Biol. 2010), and in genes downregulated in the <i>CTD S2A</i> mutant (Coudreuse et al., Curr. Biol. 2010, Schwer et al., PNAS 2012). These data are presented in the subsection headed \u201cCTD S2P regulates promoter nucleosome dynamics at a subset of genes\u201d of the manuscript. They establish that the phenomena we describe occur at a significant number of promoters. We propose that the gene specificity is established by MAP kinase signaling, which is essential to recruit the CTD S2 kinase nearby the promoters of the <i>ste11</i> and <i>inv1</i> genes that we have analysed in more details. In addition, the number of gene affected may be underestimated by the fact that the large-scale analyses were performed in a single growth condition. Regarding the mechanism, we provide a completely new figure (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>) where the association between the CTD and the H3K4 methylase Set1 is shown in vivo to require CTD S5 phosphorylation in the absence of CTD S2 phosphorylation. These new data support our model where a peak of CTD S2P displaces the Set1 methylase, which relieves its repressing effect."
