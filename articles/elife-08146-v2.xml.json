The intergenic region (IGR) IRESs from the <i>Dicistroviridae</i> family of viruses are structured RNAs that bind directly to the ribosome and initiate translation by co-opting the translation elongation cycle. These IRESs require an RNA pseudoknot that mimics a codon-anticodon interaction and contains a conformationally dynamic loop. We explored the role of this loop and found that both the length and sequence are essential for translation in different types of IGR IRESs and from diverse viruses. We found that loop 3 affects two discrete elongation factor-dependent steps in the IRES initiation mechanism. Our results show how the IRES directs multiple steps after 80S ribosome placement and highlights the often underappreciated significance of discrete conformationally dynamic elements within the context of structured RNAs."

The intergenic region (IGR) IRESs from the <i>Dicistroviridae</i> family of viruses are structured RNAs that bind directly to the ribosome and initiate translation by co-opting the translation elongation cycle. These IRESs require an RNA pseudoknot that mimics a codon-anticodon interaction and contains a conformationally dynamic loop. We explored the role of this loop and found that both the length and sequence are essential for translation in different types of IGR IRESs and from diverse viruses. We found that loop 3 affects two discrete elongation factor-dependent steps in the IRES initiation mechanism. Our results show how the IRES directs multiple steps after 80S ribosome placement and highlights the often underappreciated significance of discrete conformationally dynamic elements within the context of structured RNAs."

This loop is flexible, and interacts with the ribosome to enable the IRES to move through the ribosome. Mutations that shorten the loop or alter the sequence of nucleotides in the loop prevent the occurrence of two of the steps that need to occur for the cell to make viral proteins. Both of these steps depend on elongation factors. Determining how the entire IRES might change shape as it moves through the ribosome is an important next step, since the ribosome is exquisitely sensitive to the shape and motions of its binding partners."

                        "text": "A vital step in infection by viruses is translation of the viral RNA. Many RNA viruses initiate translation using internal ribosome entry sites (IRESs), which are <i>cis</i>-acting RNA elements that recruit the host cell\u2019s translation machinery in a cap- and end-independent fashion (<a href=\"#bib25\">Filbin and Kieft, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Doudna and Sarnow, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Plank and Kieft, 2012</a>). Most viral IRESs use a subset of the canonical initiation factor proteins to recruit and position the ribosome, but the intergenic region (IGR) IRESs of the <i>Dicistroviridae</i> family of viruses use a more streamlined mechanism (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Specifically, the ~200 nucleotide long, compactly\u00a0folded IRES RNA interacts directly with both ribosomal subunits to assemble 80S ribosomes (<a href=\"#bib54\">Nishiyama, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Costantino and Kieft, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Pfingsten et al., 2006</a>), eliminating the requirement for initiation factors (<a href=\"#bib67\">Sarnow et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Jan, 2006</a>). The IRES binds between the two subunits and, akin to a tRNA, must translocate through the ribosome (<a href=\"#bib75\">Spahn et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Sch\u00fcler et al., 2006</a>), the only known non-tRNA molecule to do so. In addition, an IGR IRES was recently shown to be able to facilitate translation initiation in live bacteria, although the mechanism in bacteria is very different from the mechanism in eukaryotes (<a href=\"#bib12\">Colussi et al., 2015</a>). Current mechanistic models for how the IGR IRESs operate in eukaryotes suggest that after the IGR IRES assembles an 80S ribosome, eukaryotic elongation factor (eEF) 2 catalyzes an initial pseudotranslocation event (translocation without peptide bond formation) which positions the first codon of the open reading frame in the A site (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib24\">Fern\u00e1ndez et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Koh et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib88\">Zhu et al., 2011</a>). This is followed by eEF1A-catalyzed delivery of the first cognate ac-tRNA to the A site and a second eEF2-driven pseudotranslocation event that vacates the A site, allowing delivery of another ac-tRNA, subsequent peptide bond formation, and assumption of the normal translation elongation cycle (<a href=\"#bib85\">Yamamoto et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Sasaki and Nakashima, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Jan and Sarnow, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Pestova, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Pestova et al., 2004</a>). Thus, initiation by this RNA structure-driven process has evolved to use the catalytic action of two GTPase elongation factors. The IGR IRESs have been studied using ribosomes, tRNA, elongation factors, lysate, and cells from sources as diverse as yeast, human, rabbit, shrimp, and wheat germ, often employed in combinations (representative references: <a href=\"#bib54\">Nishiyama, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Costantino and Kieft, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Spahn et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Koh et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib85\">Yamamoto et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Jan and Sarnow, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Pestova, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Pestova et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Cevallos and Sarnow, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Wilson et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Masoumi et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">Thompson et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Au et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Costantino et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Jan et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Muhs et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Kamoshita et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Landry et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Fukushi et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Hertz and Thompson, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Deniz et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Jang et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Pfingsten et al., 2010</a><a href=\"#bib62\">, 2007</a>). The mechanism that has emerged is consistent across these systems. This reflects the streamlined IGR IRES mechanism that depends on an RNA structure that manipulates conserved features of the eukaryotic translation machinery. In addition, this feature allows the use of diverse convenient reagents to study the IGR IRESs, a characteristic we took advantage of in this study."

                        "text": "Although IRES structural features that drive formation of the IRES\u201380S ribosome complex have been mapped, how the IGR IRES co-opts elongation factor function to drive pseudotranslocation through the ribosome is poorly understood. During the canonical elongation cycle tRNA translocation requires specific tRNA\u2013ribosome interactions and conformational states (<a href=\"#bib27\">Frank et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Joseph, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Schmeing and Ramakrishnan, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Frank and Gonzalez, 2010</a>); it has been proposed that IGR IRESs fulfill these requirements through a strategy that involves both global and local tRNA mimicry (<a href=\"#bib14\">Costantino et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Jang et al., 2009</a>). Globally, the ribosome-bound IGR IRES occupies the spaces normally bound by tRNAs, spans all three tRNA binding sites (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) (<a href=\"#bib75\">Spahn et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Sch\u00fcler et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Fern\u00e1ndez et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Koh et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Muhs et al., 2015</a>), interacts with tRNA-binding surfaces on the ribosome, and potentially mimics or induces a hybrid-like state (<a href=\"#bib27\">Frank et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Frank and Gonzalez, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Moazed and Noller, 1989</a>). Locally, the IRES mimics tRNA using a pseudoknot-containing domain (pseudoknot I [PKI] in domain III) that structurally mimics the mRNA-tRNA codon\u2013anticodon interaction located just upstream of the translation start site (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib88\">Zhu et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Costantino et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Jan et al., 2003</a>). Previous biochemical and structural studies show that domain III is not needed for initial subunit recruitment and 80S ribosome formation but is essential for establishing the reading frame by docking precisely in the ribosome\u2019s decoding groove (<a href=\"#bib54\">Nishiyama, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Costantino and Kieft, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Jan and Sarnow, 2002</a>). However, domain III has features that suggest additional roles. Specifically, x-ray crystal structures of domain III in both the unbound form and bound to ribosomes (<a href=\"#bib88\">Zhu et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Costantino et al., 2008</a>), and chemical probing experiments (<a href=\"#bib38\">Jan and Sarnow, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Pfingsten et al., 2010</a><a href=\"#bib62\">, 2007</a>), revealed that the single-stranded loop of RNA (\u2018loop 3\u2019) that links the anticodon-like hairpin to the mRNA-like sequence is conformationally dynamic (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Mutation or elimination of some bases in loop 3 affects IRES function, purportedly by impairing ribosome positioning, although other effects are possible (<a href=\"#bib5\">Au et al., 2012</a>). Cryo-electron microscopy reconstructions provide structural models for loop 3 but the electron density corresponding to this loop is generally weaker than in other parts of the IRES, not continuous, or of low resolution (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C\u2013E</a>) (<a href=\"#bib71\">Sch\u00fcler et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Fern\u00e1ndez et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Koh et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Muhs et al., 2015</a>), again suggesting conformational dynamics or structural heterogeneity. These observations are surprising, as domain III comprises an H-type pseudoknot in which the analogous loop usually forms a stable structure (<a href=\"#bib76\">Staple and Butcher, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Aalberts, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Westhof and Jaeger, 1992</a>). Comparing the sequences of IGR IRESs from different species reveals conservation in terms of the length range and base composition, in particular a high adenosine content (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplements 1, 2</a>). Adenosine residues in pseudoknot loops often form stable tertiary contacts that are not observed in domain III (<a href=\"#bib76\">Staple and Butcher, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Aalberts, 2005</a>). These features, combined with our previous work showing that conformationally dynamic structural elements in the IGR IRES can play important roles in IRES function (<a href=\"#bib59\">Pfingsten et al., 2010</a>), led us to analyze the mechanistic role of loop 3, focusing on the poorly characterized events following 80S ribosome recruitment."

                        "text": "We discovered that conformationally dynamic loop 3 operates within the context of the highly structured IRES RNA to influence the activity of elongation factors co-opted to drive initiation. We found that both the length and sequence of loop 3 are essential for efficient translation initiation in IGR IRESs from diverse members of the <i>Dicistroviridae</i> family. Using the IGR IRES from Cricket Paralysis Virus (CrPV), we demonstrate that loop 3 affects multiple eEF-directed steps, including both pseudotranslocation events. Our findings provide an example of how RNAs can use dynamic regions within the context of a globally stable structure to facilitate function. Because loop 3 is unlikely to interact directly with elongation factors and translocation is a process that depends on ribosome conformational dynamics, our data also suggest a hypothesis in which loop 3 affects ribosome conformations to assist in non-canonical translocation."

RRL was chosen as it has proven to be a consistent system for examining the activity of most IGR IRESs. First, we measured the relative translation initiation efficiencies of several IGR IRES RNAs in RRL (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Based on this, we chose representative IRESs with differing activities, including Class I and II IGR IRESs (from the <i>Cripa-</i> and <i>Apara-virus</i> subfamilies), to study the role of loop 3. We made several mutants (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>): (1) we shortened loop 3 by three nucleotides, reasoning this would reduce flexibility that may be important for function (\u25b33 mutants); (2) noting the loops\u2019 high adenosine content, we replaced several adenosines with guanosines (G-rich mutants); (3) because sequence alignment from various IRESs suggested the presence of conserved bases in loop 3 (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib5\">Au et al., 2012</a>), we replaced a single conserved adenosine with a guanosine in the highly active Israeli Acute Paralysis Virus (IAPV) IRES. These mutants are similar to those studied by <a href=\"#bib5\">Au et al., (2012</a>), but are more aggressive in the sense that we deleted more nucleotides (three) and substituted more bases (three). Each mutation had a substantial impact on IRES activity (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,C</a>). Thus, loop 3 plays a functional role in IGR IRES activity, and this role is shared by diverse members of both IRES classes."

Several more mutants were designed to assess the importance of loop 3 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D,E</a>). Shortening loop 3 in the CrPV IGR IRES by just one nucleotide (\u25b31) had a small effect on function while deleting two nucleotides (\u25b32) caused a significant loss of activity; this agrees with previous results (<a href=\"#bib5\">Au et al., 2012</a>). The \u25b33 mutant\u2019s activity is even more substantially reduced, matching the activity of the negative control PKI/III knockout mutant (<a href=\"#bib38\">Jan and Sarnow, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Costantino et al., 2008</a>). Likewise, CrPV IRES mutants analogous to the aforementioned G-rich mutants and another mutant in which three conserved bases were mutated (GGC mutant) were substantially decreased in their abilities to initiate translation. Because these differences in measured IRES activity could be due to different amounts of input reporter mRNA or rates of mRNA degradation, we controlled for this in two ways. First, the presence of the upstream Renilla LUC (not under IRES control) provides an internal normalization control for small differences in the amount of RNA in the reaction. Second, we measured the rates of degradation of all reporter mRNAs in the RRL translation reaction, finding that all were equal (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). These data indicate that both loop 3 base composition and length are important for CrPV IGR IRES function, and the mutants now provide a set of tools for querying the specific mechanistic role of loop 3."

This suggests that the effects we observe when loop 3 is mutated are not due to alterations in 80S ribosome binding, but rather in events downstream of initial ribosome recruitment. To test this prediction, we used radiolabeled IRES RNAs in RRL to generate IRES\u2013ribosome complexes and resolved them by ultracentrifugation through a sucrose gradient, using an antibiotic to halt the complexes after initial formation (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). All loop 3 mutants robustly assemble 80S\u2013ribosome complexes in RRL. Although there is some variability in the amount of 80S complexes produced in this assay, the amounts do not correlate with the translation\u00a0activity levels. As a second test for ribosome binding, we measured the approximate on- and off-rates of two mutant IRESs with purified ribosomes from yeast and shrimp sources using filter binding (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). We chose yeast and shrimp ribosomes to complement the RRL and also to test a different source of ribosomes to enable their use in subsequent assays. The measured rates are the same for wild type (WT) and mutant IRES RNAs. Taken together, these data are consistent with the conclusion that the functional effects of mutating loop 3 cannot be accounted for by defects in initial ribosome association with the IRES."

However, in RRL the loop 3 length mutants retain the +14/15 toeprint both with and without CHX to a degree that is roughly inversely correlated with their translation activities, showing that pseudotranslocation is inhibited (lanes 7, 8, 11, 12, 15, 16). A mutation that abrogates codon\u2013anticodon base pairing in PKI does not generate a PRE toeprint at all (<a href=\"#bib38\">Jan and Sarnow, 2002</a>); the fact that each mutant IRES still exhibited a PRE toeprint indicates that the mutations tested here probably do not disrupt pseudoknot formation.

In general, we conservatively use toeprinting as a robust way to assess the position of ribosomes that are bound, and their movements. After normalization of the signal and with analysis of many replicates, we determined the change in toeprint band intensities at the +14/15 and +20/21 positions to get a semi-quantitative measure of the percent of ribosomes that successfully perform two pseudotranslocations (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). In contrast to the measurements of 80S ribosome binding, these data show that shortening loop 3 inhibits the first two steps of pseudotranslocation in a way that correlates very well with the measured translation activity (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B and 2E</a>). Like the length mutants, the G-rich and GGC sequence mutants also form 80S complexes that are properly positioned at the +14/15 location (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a> lanes 22 and 26). However, these sequence mutants match WT\u2019s ability to generate a strong +20/21 band (lanes 23 and 27), suggesting they assemble 80S complexes that can translocate (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). To verify the results with CHX, we performed toeprinting in RRL with the translocation inhibitor hygromycin B, which binds the ribosome in a different location and has a different mechanism of action than CHX (<a href=\"#bib10\">Borovinskaya et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib82\">Wilson, 2014</a>) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>).

Dilute hygromycin B was added to RRL after addition of IRES RNA (in the experiments described above, RRL was pretreated with high concentrations of hygromycin B or CHX). By altering the concentration of hygromycin B and the time when it was added, we were able to empirically capture the positions of ribosomes after they had loaded and started elongation. WT IRES toeprinting shows four\u2013five rounds of translocation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, lane 2). As expected, \u25b31 behaved similarity to WT while the \u25b32 and \u25b33 mutants did not proceed past the initial binding location (lanes 6 and 8). Surprisingly, the sequence mutants displayed toeprinting patterns similar to WT (lanes 10 and 12), although the bands generated from the first few rounds of translocation are less intense, assessed after careful normalization (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, right). Thus, the G-rich and GGC mutants can translocate at least four\u2013five times in RRL, and the source of their reduced translation initiation activity must be more subtle than a complete failure to translocate. Although all of the mutants showed defects in translation initiation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>), the toeprinting data indicate that the reasons differ between the length and sequence mutants. The G-rich and GGC mutants do not completely block translocation while the length mutants do, indicating loop 3 has two independent roles in IGR IRES- driven translation initiation."

Domain III is essential for establishing the proper reading frame, so the mutations could induce the ribosome to initiate out-of-frame. To test this, we measured translation in RRL using dual LUC constructs with one or two additional nucleotides inserted immediately before the AUG of the firefly LUC open reading frame (+1 and +2 frames), which could rescue out-of-frame initiation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Neither alternate frame rescues IRES activity in the G-rich or GGC loop 3 mutants, indicating the G-rich and GGC mutants do not induce out-of-frame initiation."

It is unlikely that loop 3 acts after the IRES no longer interacts with the ribosome, the presumed situation after four translocation events. Alternatively, decreased toeprint band intensity in these mutants (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a> lanes 10 and 12) suggested there could be subtle changes in kinetics of the translocation events. Because toeprinting is not an ideal assay to examine this, we directly explored differences in the rate of peptide synthesis between the WT and the sequence mutants in an in vitro reconstituted translation system by quench-flow (diagrammed in <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). For these experiments, we used ribosomes from yeast or shrimp eggs, reflecting \"one\u00a0of\"\u00a0the <i>Dicistroviridae</i>\u2019s natural arthropod hosts, elongation factors from yeast, and tRNAs of either bacterial or yeast origin. As mentioned above, the use of convenient and high-activity heterologous systems is prevalent in IGR IRES research, and is justified because IGR IRESs appear to function identically in all tested eukaryotic systems.

Compared to WT, both the G-rich and GGC mutants displayed substantially decreased abilities to convert tripeptide to tetrapeptide, at levels that reflected their relative translation activities (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>).

As expected, ac-tRNA delivered by eEF1A and translocated to the P site by eEF2 bound stably enough to survive this purification, whereas A-site associated ac-tRNA did not (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) (<a href=\"#bib85\">Yamamoto et al., 2007</a>). Furthermore, ac-tRNA delivery and binding to the P site depended on a cognate codon\u2013tRNA anticodon interaction (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). This latter control is important as it shows that the delivery and binding event we observe in this experiment depends on the presence of the IRES and the placement of the correct codon directly downstream of the IRES within the A site. Therefore, this assay measures the efficiency of completion of all three eEF-dependent steps (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>).

To discriminate between these possibilities, we employed a fluorescence anisotropy experiment in which proflavin-labeled Phe-tRNA<sup>Phe</sup> [Phe-tRNA<sup>Phe</sup>(prf)] TC was delivered to WT and mutant IGR IRES\u201380S ribosome complexes (shrimp ribosomes) in the absence of eEF2 (diagrammed in <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The measured anisotropy of unbound Phe-tRNA<sup>Phe</sup>(prf) was 0.205 +/- 0.002 (<a href=\"#fig5s4\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). As expected, addition of eEF1A-GTP to the ac-tRNA resulted in an increase in measured anisotropy to 0.210 +/- 0.003, consistent with formation of the eEF1A+GTP+Phe-tRNA<sup>Phe</sup>(prf) TC. Addition of empty 80S ribosomes (lacking an mRNA or IRES, indicated as \u2018no IRES\u2019) resulted in only a slight increase in change in anisotropy relative to the TC alone (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). However, when a complex of CrPV IGR IRES bound to 80S ribosomes was added to the TC, we observed a much larger increase in anisotropy, to 0.272 +/- 0.006. This change in anisotropy between TC alone and in the presence of 80S ribosomes+IRES (0.061 +/- 0.003) is consistent with delivery of ac-tRNA to the A site of the IRES\u201380S ribosome complex by the TC."

This resulted in a smaller increase in anisotropy compared to the IRES with a cognate Phe codon, but larger than the \u2018no IRES\u2019 control. Importantly, the observation that eEF2-independent ac-tRNA binding to the ribosome requires a cognate codon is consistent with the idea that the first codon enters the A site and is queried by the ac-tRNA anticodon. This supports the idea that domain III can spontaneously move to the P site to some degree, perhaps akin to the observed ability of tRNAs to undergo slow spontaneous translocation on bacterial ribosomes (<a href=\"#bib32\">Gavrilova et al., 1976</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Gavrilova and Spirin, 1971</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Pestka, 1969</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Southworth et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Fredrick and Noller, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Moore, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Robertson and Wintermeyer, 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Semenkov et al., 1992</a>). The nature of the ac-tRNA\u2019s association with the ribosome likely differs depending on whether an IRES RNA with a non-cognate or cognate codon is present; the former probably represents transient TC interaction with the tRNA in a A/T state during a decoding step, the latter likely represents full and longer-lived accommodation of the tRNA into the A/A state."

Mutants \u25b31, \u25b32, and \u25b33 showed a progressive decrease in anisotropy (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>), following the trend established by the translation initiation and pseudotranslocation data. These data indicate that these mutants have a defect in initial ac-tRNA binding; in the case of \u25b33, this defect is more severe than the effect of a non-cognate codon. This may be because the movement of the first codon into the A site has been compromised. ac-tRNA delivery to IRES\u201380S ribosome complexes with the \u25b31 and \u25b32 mutants was less than to WT, but equal to or greater than to the IRES with a non-cognate codon. To approximate the percentage of these A-site ac-tRNAs that successfully translocated to the P site, we normalized their P site binding levels to the A site interaction levels (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). For \u25b31, the percentage is ~80% while for \u25b32 it is ~25%. When we consider these data in light of the proposed mechanism of IGR IRES-driven initiation (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), they suggest that these mutants have defects in both pseudotranslocation events and these defects become progressively worse as loop 3 is shortened. In contrast, the G-rich and GGC mutants display ac-tRNA binding similar to the WT IRES (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Thus, the defect in these sequence mutants is restricted to the second pseudotranslocation event which moves ac-tRNA from the A site to the P site, and domain III from the P site to the E site. Taken together, the data from all mutants suggest that loop 3 has two independent functions to facilitate two elongation factor-driven steps, which depend on loop 3 length and base composition."

The decreased ac-tRNA association in mutant IRES\u201380S ribosome complexes observed in the anisotropy experiment could result from a decrease in spontaneous vacating of the A site, or from decreased TC association even if the A site is available. To address this, we used single-molecule total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy to directly visualize the colocalization of Cy5 fluorophore-labeled Phe-tRNA<sup>Phe</sup> with Cy3 fluorophore-labeled IRES\u201380S ribosome complexes (from yeast) that had been tethered (via the IRES RNA) to the surface of a microfluidic observation flowcell (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This colocalization data reports on the ac-tRNA occupancy of the 80S\u2013IRES ribosome complexes. We chose WT and \u25b33 IRESs to study as they exhibited the most differing behaviors in the previous experiments. As expected, addition of just Phe-tRNA<sup>Phe</sup>(Cy5)+GTP (without eEFs) to 80S\u2013IRES ribosome complexes, followed by incubation and subsequent flushing of the flowcell to remove unbound ac-tRNA, revealed very low ac-tRNA occupancies for both WT and \u25b33 IRESs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). When GTP+eEF2 was included with the Phe-tRNA<sup>Phe</sup>(Cy5) (but no eEF1A) the ac-tRNA occupancy of the IRES\u201380S ribosome complexes formed with WT IRES increased to 9.7 \u00b1 2.5%, consistent with a low, but enhanced level of eEF1A-independent ac-tRNA binding. When this experiment was repeated with the \u25b33 IRES, we observed a lower ac-tRNA occupancy (1.5 \u00b1 1.1%) compared to the WT IRES. Higher eEF1A-independent, but eEF2-dependent, ac-tRNA occupancy on WT IRES complexes compared to \u25b33 IRES complexes suggests that the difference between these two IRESs in the anisotropy experiment (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>) is not due to altering eIF1A function. Rather, those data may indicate a decrease in clearing of the A site by the \u25b33 mutant, suggesting the \u25b33 mutant\u2019s main defect is in the first pseudotranslocation and not in the A-site ac-tRNA binding event itself."

However, in the reconstituted assays these mutants fail before two rounds of pseudotranslocation (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). We consider it unlikely that this discrepancy is due to differences in the species of ribosomes used (purified subunits were made from yeast and shrimp sources, versus rabbit subunits in RRL) because IGR IRESs function in diverse systems and contact highly conserved ribosome features. A more likely possibility is that the presence or effective concentrations of various components (ribosomes, ac-tRNAs, GTP, or unidentified factors) is different in the lysate as compared to the reconstituted system, which may alter the kinetics of the translocation reactions. In addition, the presence of antibiotics such as CHX or hygromycin B (which we only used in RRL-based experiments) may suppress the effects of sequence mutation to loop 3 by altering ribosome conformational dynamics (<a href=\"#bib82\">Wilson, 2014</a>).

Overall, toeprint band intensity did not correlate well with translation activity, suggesting that something else regulates the modest defects that were identified in that study. Because we discovered mutants with more pronounced translation defects, and whose toeprint intensities did not correlate with translation activity, we could use this to more deeply dissect the specific mechanistic role of loop 3 in more depth using a battery of quantitative analyses. Our data indicate that domain III\u2019s loop 3 is involved in the two non-canonical pseudotranslocation events following initial IGR IRES recruitment of the 80S ribosome."

In this mechanistic model, initial pseudotranslocation by eEF2 is needed to clear the A site before ac-tRNA can bind the ribosome. Consistent with this, our data and other studies show that stable association of ac-tRNA with the IRES\u2013ribosome complex depends on eEF2 (<a href=\"#bib85\">Yamamoto et al., 2007</a>). Additionally, eukaryotic release factor 1 (eRF1) only binds in the A site of IRES\u201380S ribosome complexes (and induces a change in the toeprint) in the presence of eEF2 (<a href=\"#bib37\">Jan et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Muhs et al., 2015</a>). However, no pseudotranslocation is observed with pure WT IGR IRES\u201380S ribosome complexes treated with eEF2 only (assayed by toeprinting) (<a href=\"#bib58\">Pestova, 2003</a>). A mechanistic model that reconciles this observation posits that eEF2 first moves domain III from the A site to the P site, but this is a transient state and without immediate ac-tRNA delivery domain III spontaneously reverse-translocates to the A site (<a href=\"#bib24\">Fern\u00e1ndez et al., 2014</a>). This is validated by the toeprinting experiment demonstrating one round of translocation in high concentrations of hygromycin B (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), which has been shown to potently inhibit reverse translocation (<a href=\"#bib10\">Borovinskaya et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Szaflarski et al., 2008</a>). If this explanation is true, the transient position of domain III in the P site would preclude detection of this state by traditional biochemical approaches; possibly, the toeprinting assay itself may facilitate reverse-translocation. This mechanistic model is supported by our data and agrees with all previously published data."

                        "text": "Assuming domain III begins in the A site, shortening loop 3 appears to inhibit movement of domain III to the P site before any ac-tRNA is bound. Given that domain III and loop 3 are positioned to interact with components of the 40S subunit head known to be involved in translocation (ribosomal protein uS13 when domain III is in the A site, for example [<a href=\"#bib15\">Cukras et al., 2003</a>]), our data favor a mechanistic model where the loop 3 length mutants fail to efficiently execute the first pseudotranslocation event and this blocks access of ac-tRNA to the A site. This is supported by the anisotropy data with the non-cognate RNA which show an increase above background levels established by the no-IRES control. This likely indicates the transient binding of the ac-tRNA TC to the A site and subsequent rejection. In comparison, the fact that the \u25b33 mutant yields even lower anisotropy levels than the non-cognate RNA suggests that the TC can never bind the \u25b33 IRES\u2013ribosome complex even transiently. This is consistent with the idea that the initial movement of domain III does not occur with this mutant, either spontaneously or with eEF2, and domain III remains in the A site. Given that our sequence mutants (G-rich and GGC) inhibit the second pseudotranslocation, this interpretation makes loop 3, despite being a short and apparently conformationally dynamic element, a key player in non-canonical translocation events that move the IGR IRES through all three tRNA binding sites."

                        "text": "There is no obvious analogous structure to loop 3 in tRNA, raising the question of how this loop exerts its effects. One possibility is that loop 3 interacts directly with the ribosome in ways not yet clearly observed using structural methods. Recent cryoEM reconstructions of CrPV (<a href=\"#bib24\">Fern\u00e1ndez et al., 2014</a>) and Taura Syndrome Virus (TSV) (<a href=\"#bib47\">Koh et al., 2014</a>) IGR IRESs bound to 80S ribosomes in the pretranslocated (PRE) state (domain III in the A site) at resolutions of 3.8 and 6 \u00c5 respectively and of CrPV\u201380S\u2013eRF complexes in the post-translocation (POST) state (domain III in the P site) at 8.7 \u00c5 (<a href=\"#bib53\">Muhs et al., 2015</a>) provide structural models for loop 3. However, the local resolution for loop 3 is low in all structures, consistent with conformational dynamics (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C\u2013E</a>). Interestingly, in the class I (CrPV) versus class II (TSV) IRESs, loop 3 spans somewhat different space when domain III is in the A site. In both structures, the 3\u2019 ends of loop 3 terminate in the decoding center of the A site where they may interact with elements of the decoding groove. In contrast, the 5\u2019 ends of loop 3 differ in these structural models. In CrPV the 5\u2019 nucleotides of loop 3 wrap around the 5\u2019 terminal nucleotides of the PKI stem in the A site. In the TSV structural model, loop 3 interacts with the apical loop of rRNA helix 24, part of a constriction between the P and E sites. In bacterial ribosomes this constriction is essential for maintaining the P-site tRNA in its proper place to prevent slipping of the mRNA (<a href=\"#bib70\">Schuwirth, 2005</a>), and must be remodeled by 30S subunit head swiveling for tRNA to translocate from the P to the E site (<a href=\"#bib87\">Zhou et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Ratje et al., 2010</a>). If loop 3 contacts this constriction, it could affect a known structural regulator of translocation, affecting the conformation of the ribosome in a way that favors eEF2 function. In the POST structure with eRFs, loop 3 is modeled to interact with uS7, a key frame-maintenance and translocation regulator (<a href=\"#bib17\">Devaraj et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Galkin et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Robert and Brakier-Gingras, 2003</a>). Interestingly, the HCV IRES is also thought to communicate with uS7 (<a href=\"#bib30\">Fukushi et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Filbin et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Boehringer et al., 2005</a>), pointing to this ribosomal protein as an important \u2018gatekeeper\u2019 to ribosome function that is exploited by viral IRES RNAs. Precisely what loop 3 interacts with, how and when it makes these interactions, and how these interactions affect the conformation of the IRES\u2013ribosome complex remains to be determined, as does the question of whether loop 3 functions differently in the two classes of IGR IRESs."

Many H-type pseudoknots use adenosines in loop 3 to make minor groove interactions with an adjacent helix. Although no minor groove interactions have been identified in domain III, most IGR IRES loop 3s have adenosine content greater than 40% (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>); this may be an important feature of loop 3. Indeed, the G-rich and GGC mutations (22% and 33% adenosine, respectively) show substantially decreased translation activity. Transient or dynamic interactions between the loop and the rest of domain III may be important for altering the conformation of the pseudoknot as it moves through the ribosome. tRNAs are known to undergo substantial conformational changes as they transit through the ribosome (<a href=\"#bib20\">Dunkle et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Fei et al., 2011</a>); loop 3 could help domain III do the same. Alternatively, it may be important for loop 3 to remain unstructured. Indeed, structural probing of these mutants in the unbound form show decreases in loop 3 accessibility to single-stranded ribonuclease (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The presence and importance of these changes within the ribosome are unknown, although it is tempting to speculate that a decrease in flexibility may drive the defects observed in this study."

Yet, molecular mimicry is not limited to structural similarity; the binding partners of these mimics must also be fooled by conformational dynamics and overall molecular interactions. Our work suggests that the flexible elements of the IGR IRES facilitate these additional aspects of mimicry that remain understudied. This discovery that IRES RNA flexibility rather than defined structure is important for function may be particularly important in the context of ribosome manipulation since the ribosome has been suggested to act as a Brownian machine that fluctuates between conformational states (<a href=\"#bib28\">Frank and Gonzalez, 2010</a>), and thus this and other elements of the translation machinery are highly tuned to respond to and exploit the dynamics of their ligands."

RNAs were heated at 85\u00b0C for 1\u2009min in 30 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.5 and removed from heat. To 10 mM final concentration, MgCl<sub>2</sub> was added and the RNAs were allowed to cool on the benchtop for 5\u2009min. Pure shrimp ribosomes were added to the RNA at room temperature to a final concentration of 30 nM, and then 50 \u03bcL aliquots were removed from the reaction at defined time points out to 12\u2009min and immediately pipetted through a membrane sandwich of nitrocellulose (BioRad) (on the top), Hybond nylon membrane (GE Healthcare) (middle), and Whatman filter paper (VWR,\u00a0Radnor,\u00a0PA) (bottom), on a dot-blot vacuum manifold. Membranes were air-dried then exposed to a phosphorscreen. The screens were imaged on a Typhoon phosphorimager scanner. The data were analyzed by drawing equal sized circles around each dot using ImageQuant software and obtaining a volume/intensity report for each circle. Fraction bound was then calculated from the intensity signals as follows: (Nitrocellulose)/(Nitrocellulose + Nylon)."

RNAs were ethanol precipitated overnight and resuspended to equal counts per microliter in 1X TBE + 9M urea loading buffer. RNase T1 (G) (denaturing)\u00a0ladders for each RNA and a hydrolysis ladder of the WT CrPV11 RNA were generated as previously described (<a href=\"#bib46\">Kieft et al., 1999</a>). Samples were loaded on a 12% polyacrylamide-urea sequencing gel (0.4 mm gel thickness) and run for 2\u2009hr at 65 W. For analysis, data were normalized to total amount of radiation in each lane before subtracting the appropriate non-native T1 cleavage signal (G ladders) from the native T1 cleavage signal."

These IRES elements, whose founding member is the cricket paralysis virus IRES (CrPV IRES), bind directly to ribosomes from a range of organisms, drive subunit assembly and can initiate elongation in the absence of an initiator tRNA. In particular, the authors focus on a key loop within a pseudoknot that mimics the codon-anticodon interaction in the IRES sitting initially in the ribosomal A site in the 80S complex; as such the IRES requires translocation (pseudotranslocation) to move the IRES to the P site to allow elongation. Here the authors use a wide variety of experimental approaches \u2013 toeprinting, dual luciferase assays, co-sedimentation assays, fluorescence anisotropy and single-molecule co-localization assays \u2013 to probe the role of the loop. They argue that certain mutations in the loop affect the initial pseudotranslocation step while others affect the 2nd pseudotranslocation step. In general, the conclusions of the work are supported by the array of experiments, and the mechanistic model is clear and substantiated. Moreover, these studies nicely shed light on how dynamic features of RNA elements are critical is specifying their unusual function on the ribosome."

For example, the authors broadly conclude that there are no defects in complex formation that result from the various loop 3 mutations (based on <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) and yet there are clear differences in the level of toeprint that is observed; differences in these results should be fairly discussed.

Their data show that both the length and the sequence of this loop determine the efficiency of translation from different types of IGR IRESs. Specifically, they found, using the IGR IRES from Cricket Paralysis Virus (CrPV), that the intactness of loop 3 is important for both elongation factor-dependent pseudotranslocation events. Since loop 3 is unlikely to directly interact with elongation factors, they put forward a hypothesis in which this loop assists in pseudotranslocation by affecting ribosome conformation. Interestingly, hygromycin B was found to inhibit the first but not the second translocation event driven by the CrPV IRES. Overall, if sufficiently developed, this study will provide important information about the features of IGR IRESs that contribute to their efficiency in translation at the steps downstream of the initial IRES-80S ribosome interaction. However, there are major issues with the toeprint assays that they carried out to support their main conclusions."

The authors should show that initiation in the various mixed systems used in the current manuscript occurs via similar mechanisms. Perhaps a toeprint in each used system, as the paper already presents a toeprint for yeast ribosomes in RRL. It would be useful if authors would explain why they feel a need to use multiple systems, as it will help to understand how comparable those systems are.

They found that increases in loop 3 length were tolerated functionally up to four additional nucleotides. We did not assess the effect of increasing the length of loop 3, which we did not think would be as mechanistically insightful. The effect of decreasing loop 3 length that the Jan group tested mirrored our results, although they deleted only one or two nucleotides from the loop, not three as we did. In toeprinting assays, these deletion mutations generated a pretranslocation toeprint at the same position as the WT RNA using the antibiotic edeine as an inhibitor in the lysate. Notably, the toeprint intensity varied from 61-126% of WT, thus toeprint intensity did not correlate with translation activity. This is consistent with our data. In addition, Au and Jan present a large number of point mutations in their paper analyzed the same way, with varying levels of activity and toeprint intensities. Au and Jan conclude that their mutations alter 80S binding efficiency and that \u201cribosome positioning\u201d is affected by these mutations, although the position of the toeprint does not change in their experiments. Likewise, they do not include alternate approaches to directly measure ribosome binding."

Our assessment is that while the method is powerful, the results are often over-interpreted or used as an inappropriate proxy for more quantitative methods. To illustrate, in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a> of our manuscript two toeprint experiments are shown with WT IRES RNA, performed on the same day. There is variability in the intensity of the toeprints even though the position of the toeprints is the same. This is likely due to experimental variables such as different extension and cDNA extraction efficiencies as well as differences in how the RT might stop due to conformational dynamics of the ribosome, the dynamic nature of the system, etc. Thus, a quantitative analysis requires normalization and averaging of multiple replicates (as we do in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). However, even with this careful quantitation, we are convinced that the results should not be interpreted as a quantitative measure of ribosome binding without additional complementary approaches (as we do in <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Thus, we assert that toeprint intensity is not a quantitative measure of ribosome binding or complex formation, it is best used to monitor the position of bound ribosomes on the mRNA. This is part of the reason why we regard the toeprinting data as one part of a much more comprehensive examination using a \u201cwide variety of experimental approaches\u2013toeprinting, dual luciferase assays, co-sedimentation assays, fluorescence anisotropy and single-molecule co-localization assays\u201d as pointed out by a reviewer. Furthermore, because we discovered mutants with more pronounced translation defects and applied this set of novel and more quantitative biochemical assays designed to interrogate each step in the initiation pathway, we could dissect the specific mechanistic role of loop 3 to a much greater depth."
