                    "text": "Signals delivered by costimulatory molecules are implicated in driving T cell expansion. The requirements for these signals, however, vary from dispensable to essential in different infections. We examined the underlying mechanisms of this differential T cell costimulation dependence and found that the viral context determined the dependence on CD28/B7-mediated costimulation for expansion of naive and memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, indicating that the requirement for costimulatory signals is not imprinted. Notably, related to the high-level costimulatory molecule expression induced by lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), CD28/B7-mediated costimulation was dispensable for accumulation of LCMV-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells because of redundancy with the costimulatory pathways induced by TNF receptor family members (i.e., CD27, OX40, and 4-1BB). Type I IFN signaling in viral-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells is slightly redundant with costimulatory signals. These results highlight that pathogen-specific conditions differentially and uniquely dictate the utilization of costimulatory pathways allowing shaping of effector and memory antigen-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses."

The requirements for these signals, however, vary from dispensable to essential in different infections. We examined the underlying mechanisms of this differential T cell costimulation dependence and found that the viral context determined the dependence on CD28/B7-mediated costimulation for expansion of naive and memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, indicating that the requirement for costimulatory signals is not imprinted. Notably, related to the high-level costimulatory molecule expression induced by lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), CD28/B7-mediated costimulation was dispensable for accumulation of LCMV-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells because of redundancy with the costimulatory pathways induced by TNF receptor family members (i.e., CD27, OX40, and 4-1BB). Type I IFN signaling in viral-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells is slightly redundant with costimulatory signals. These results highlight that pathogen-specific conditions differentially and uniquely dictate the utilization of costimulatory pathways allowing shaping of effector and memory antigen-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses."

Afterwards, some of the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells become \u2018memory T cells\u2019, which allow the immune system to respond more rapidly if the virus returns.

However, a vaccine may not be as effective in activating the T cells as the live virus, perhaps because it fails to trigger the production of other molecules in the host that promote T cell activation. There are many of these \u2018co-stimulatory molecules\u2019 in the body, but it is not clear exactly how they work."

Mice that were genetically engineered to lack two co-stimulatory molecules called CD80 and CD86 failed to accumulate active CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in response to infection with a herpes-like virus. However, if these mice were infected with a different virus called LCMV\u2014which causes swelling of the brain and spinal cord\u2014they produced many active CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells to fight the infection."

Further experiments showed that LCMV triggers a lot more inflammation in infected cells than the other virus. This leads to the production of many different types of co-stimulatory molecules, which ensures that if one fails to boost the activation of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, another molecule can do so instead. Better understanding of how these co-stimulatory molecules work could help scientists to develop more effective vaccines in future."

CD28 is considered as the most prominent costimulatory receptor for T cells, but signals provided by members of the TNF receptor (TNFR) super family such as CD27, OX40 (CD134) and 4-1BB (CD137) are known to provide crucial signals as well. T cell responses seem to be differentially and contextually dependent on costimulatory interactions but the underlying mechanisms are unknown (<a href=\"#bib22\">DeBenedette et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Welten et al., 2013a</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Wortzman et al., 2013</a>). For example, the pathogen-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell response during vesicular stomatitis virus and vaccinia virus (VV) infection is highly driven by interactions between CD28 and the B7 molecules B7.1 (CD80) and B7.2 (CD86) (<a href=\"#bib59\">Sigal et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Bertram et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Fuse et al., 2008</a>), while in lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection the viral-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells seem to bypass the requirements of the CD28/B7 costimulatory pathway for primary effector T cell expansion (<a href=\"#bib58\">Shahinian et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Kundig et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Andreasen et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Grujic et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Eberlein et al., 2012</a>). Even within a single infection distinct requirements for costimulatory signals can be observed. In mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV), the classical (non-inflationary) CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses are more dependent on the CD28/B7 costimulatory pathway than the so-called inflationary CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, which gradually accumulate at high frequencies in time (<a href=\"#bib7\">Arens et al., 2011b</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">O'Hara et al., 2012</a>)."

We found that the pathogen-induced environment and not the characteristics of the viral epitopes determined the requirements of naive and of memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells for CD28/B7-mediated costimulation. Remarkably, related to the induction of high costimulatory ligand expression, LCMV-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell expansion can operate in a CD28/B7 independent fashion because of redundancy with the costimulatory members of the TNFR superfamily. Furthermore, direct type I IFN signaling in viral-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells is slightly redundant with CD28/B7 and CD27/CD70-mediated costimulation. These findings demonstrate that the inflammatory environment dictates the characteristics of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses by allowing a differential utilization of stimulatory pathways."

Therefore, recombinant MCMVs were generated in which the GP33 epitope was expressed within the immediate early 2 (IE2) protein (MCMV-IE2-GP33) or the M45 protein (MCMV-M45-GP33). The in vitro replication kinetics of MCMV-IE2-GP33 and MCMV-M45-GP33 were similar as WT virus (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Correspondingly, in vivo infection with MCMV-IE2-GP33 induced a GP33-specific response with inflationary characteristics, as specified by a gradual increasing GP33-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell response in time with an effector memory phenotype (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B,C</a>). As determined by intracellular IFN-\u03b3 staining after restimulation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A,B</a>) or direct staining with MHC class I tetramers (data not shown), the GP33-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell response elicited by both MCMV-IE2-GP33 and MCMV-M45-GP33 was dependent on B7-mediated costimulation, albeit to a higher degree when the GP33 epitope was inserted within the M45 protein. Infection with an MCMV containing the model epitope OVA<sub>257-264</sub> (SIINFEKL) inserted in the M45 protein (MCMV-M45-SIINFEKL) resulted also in an antigen-specific T cell response that depended on B7-mediated costimulation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>), indicating that non-viral epitopes elicit similar costimulation dependent responses. Furthermore, LM expressing the LCMV GP33 epitope (LM-GP33) induced GP33-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses that were highly dependent on B7-mediated costimulation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). Also, upon vaccination with a synthetic long peptide (SLP) containing the GP33 epitope, <i>Cd80/86</i><sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> mice mounted a defective GP33-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell response in comparison with WT mice (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). To exclude possible effects related to differences in the TCR repertoire selection, TCR transgenic CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells recognizing the LCMV GP33 epitope (referred hereafter as P14 cells) were used in different pathogenic contexts. Similar as observed for the endogenous LCMV-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell expansion, B7-mediated costimulation was dispensable for P14 cell expansion in LCMV infection. Importantly, for the expansion of P14 cells in MCMV-IE2-GP33 and LM-GP33 infection, B7-mediated signals were highly required (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>), which corroborates that the inflammatory environment is predominantly determining the costimulatory requirements. Together, these data indicate that the context of viral epitope expression, rather than the intrinsic nature of the epitope or the antigen-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell population, influences the dependence on B7-mediated signals for T cell expansion."

Therefore, crisscross adoptive transfer experiments were performed with memory GP33-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells generated in different viral environments. First, memory GP33-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were primed in the context of an LCMV infection and adoptively transferred into WT or <i>Cd80/86</i><sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> hosts that were subsequently infected with either LCMV or MCMV-IE2-GP33. Comparing the GP33-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses upon antigenic re-challenge revealed a dispensable role for B7-mediated signals for secondary T cell expansion in an LCMV environment, but a strong requirement for these signals in an MCMV context even though these cells were primed in an LCMV environment (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Importantly, when memory GP33-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells that depended on B7-mediated signals during priming in MCMV infection were transferred and re-challenged in an LCMV or an MCMV environment, the viral context during secondary expansion again determined the requirement on costimulatory signals (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Together, these data indicate that during secondary T cell responses the viral context is dominant and determines the CD28/B7 costimulation dependency of virus-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells independent of the priming context."

Next, we examined if the B7-dependent MCMV-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell response can be boosted via supplementary triggering of the type I IFN pathway. We used recombinant IFN\u03b12 that was functional both in vitro, as determined by a cytopathic effect inhibition assay (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), and in vivo as evidenced by increased expression of CD69 on lymphocytes at 18 hr upon i.p. administration (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>).

To unequivocally demonstrate the uniqueness of the viral context to induce B7-mediated costimulation dependence, WT mice were co-infected with MCMV and LCMV.

Given the higher costimulatory molecule expression, one could argue that LCMV infection elicits an elevated inflammatory milieu as compared to most other infections. Consistent with this notion is that in LCMV infection very high levels of type I IFNs are induced, which are partly responsible for the high costimulatory ligand expression. An elevated expression of costimulatory molecules in LCMV infection might also be related to a lack of immunomodulatory effects that dampen costimulatory molecule expression. During MCMV infection for example, the B7.1 and B7.2 expression in virus-infected cells is downmodulated by the virus by sophisticated immune evasion mechanism (<a href=\"#bib43\">Loewendorf et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Mintern et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Arens et al., 2011a</a>).

CD28 is also able to signal via the NF-\u03baB route (<a href=\"#bib11\">Boomer and Green, 2010</a>). Another shared signaling pathway of CD28 and TNFR family members might be the c-Jun kinase pathway, which is coupled to proliferation as well (<a href=\"#bib29\">Gravestein et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Skanland et al., 2014</a>). We found redundancy between CD28 and CD27 signaling on CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell expansion in MCMV and LCMV infection, and this has been found in influenza virus infection as well (<a href=\"#bib31\">Hendriks et al., 2003</a>). However, besides redundancy between CD28/B7 and TNFR/TNF families also redundancy among costimulatory TNFR family members likely happened as the response was most compromised in settings where multiple TNFR family members were targeted. The latter is consistent with observations in the influenza virus infection model, where virus-specific T cells that accumulate in the lung but not in the spleen were collectively dependent on signals mediated via a variety of TNFR family members (<a href=\"#bib32\">Hendriks et al., 2005</a>)."

The fact that even upon LCMV and MCMV co-infection the costimulatory requirements for T cell expansion are not altered, suggest that this instruction occurs locally, likely at the level of APC-T cell interaction. The majority of the MCMV-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells is activated via cross-priming (<a href=\"#bib63\">Torti et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Busche et al., 2013</a>), and whether both direct and cross-priming occur during LCMV infection is unclear (<a href=\"#bib27\">Freigang et al., 2007</a>). Nevertheless CD11c<sup>+</sup> APCs are critical for LCMV-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell priming (<a href=\"#bib52\">Probst and van den Broek, 2005</a>). Moreover, because of different tropisms it is unlikely that MCMV and LCMV co-infect the very same cells and that the viral epitopes are presented by the same APC (<a href=\"#bib44\">Matloubian et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Alexandre et al., 2014</a>). Since APCs need to be directly activated for adequate T cell priming rather than by environmental inflammatory signals (<a href=\"#bib39\">Kratky, 2011</a>), our data are consistent with a scenario where the two viruses activate APCs in a different manner resulting in differential provision of costimulatory signals. The enhanced costimulation during LCMV infection may besides due to stronger and distinctive (local) inflammation also be a consequence of longer and/or stronger antigen-presentation as compared to other viral infections. However, LCMV and MCMV are both natural mouse pathogens and infection with these viruses results in virus levels that peak around day 4 post-infection in the spleen and liver (<a href=\"#bib14\">Buchmeier et al., 1980</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Cicin-Sain et al., 2008</a>).

Thus, for example, the finding that LCMV responses are independent of CD28 (and by inference B7.1, B7.2) for which the original reference (Shahinian et al., Science, 1993) also noted that costimulation requirements are viral context-dependent, or the finding that anti-LCMV but not anti-influenza CD8 T cell responses are unimpaired in the absence of both CD28 and 4-1BBL (DeBenedette et al., JI, 1999), or the epitope repertoire-independence of viral infection contextual costimulation requirements (Lin et al., JI, 2009, and Salek-Ardakani 2011). Thus, the manuscript should be a bit more balanced in acknowledging such previous contributions to the field, particularly when the idea of contextual variation in costimulation requirements has been reviewed recently (Wotzman et al., Immunol Rev 2013)."

Thus, at least for the pair of LCMV (Armstrong) and MCMV, an experiment of the kind shown in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>, but with a more complete set of combinations, and comparing LCMV and MCMV, would be very useful. Such experiments will be best done using transferred p14-TCR-transgenic CD8 T cells to \u2018control\u2019 for TCR-repertoire-related differences and to allow the use of IFNIR<sup>+/+</sup> and IFNIR<sup>-/-</sup> p14 CD8 T cells to enable the inclusion of IFN-I-signaling in the analytical matrix."

For example, the blocking studies in <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>, show only one time point for the readout and would be more convincing if more than one time point were examined. The authors administer very large amounts of antibodies without indicating any isotype controls, raising worries about the specificity of the blockade and about possible FcR mediated APC effects. <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a> is a critical experiment, but it\u2019s hard to determine how strong the result is \u2013 it would be useful to see each mouse shown as a single point and all the mice included, rather than just showing a bar graph."

Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Tadatsugu Taniguchi (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor, and one reviewer. The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below: This paper elegantly shows that it is the viral context rather than the TCR repertoire or specific epitope that determines B7/CD28 dependence of CD8 T cell responses to viruses. By using LCMV epitopes or GP33 specific T cells in the context of an LCMV or MCMV infection, the authors show that LCMV induced responses are <i>Cd80/86</i> independent whereas MCMV responses are <i>Cd80/86</i> dependent. This is true of secondary responses to LCMV or MCMV delivered epitopes also, regardless of whether cells were primed by LCMV or MCMV. As LCMV infection induces particularly high levels of type I Interferon, the authors investigated the role of type I interferon in the <i>Cd80/86</i> dependence. However, blocking type I interferon receptor similarly impaired WT or <i>Cd80/86</i> knockout mice, arguing that type I interferon does not explain <i>Cd80/86</i> independence of the LCMV specific response. Neither transfer of serum from LCMV infected mice nor coinfection changed the results. LCMV infection was found to induce higher levels of several costimulatory molecules and blocking and knockout mice were used to show redundancy of costimulatory pathways for LCMV specific CD8 T cell responses."

It would be of interest to determine the level of viral antigen in LCMV versus MCMV delivered GP33, as prolonged antigen presentation might explain how additional costimulatory molecules are induced. Although a direct measure of antigen levels would be difficult, the level of antigen presentation over time could be measured by transfer of CFSE labeled P14 cells at different times post infection into MCMV-GP33 or LCMV infected mice over time to test the prediction that longer or stronger antigen presentation explains increased induction of costimulatory molecules and redundancy. If possible, such data would add very substantially to the value of the manuscript. At the very least, it is essential to discuss this issue and possibility."

This leads to a lower response due to promoter specific reasons. Indeed, a MCMV-mutant expressing the GP33 epitope in the M45-gene, inducing a GP33-specific response following the normal pattern of expansion and contraction, elicits in the acute phase of infection a higher GP33-specific response than MCMV-IE2-GP33 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>).

It would be of interest to determine the level of viral antigen in LCMV versus MCMV delivered GP33, as prolonged antigen presentation might explain how additional costimulatory molecules are induced. Although a direct measure of antigen levels would be difficult, the level of antigen presentation over time could be measured by transfer of CFSE labeled P14 cells at different times post infection into MCMV-GP33 or LCMV infected mice over time to test the prediction that longer or stronger antigen presentation explains increased induction of costimulatory molecules and redundancy. If possible, such data would add very substantially to the value of the manuscript. At the very least, it is essential to discuss this issue and possibility</i>."

                    "text": "We thank the reviewers for addressing this point. It may be indeed interesting to know whether the increased costimulation during LCMV infection is through more inflammation or more antigen. Both MCMV and LCMV are natural mouse pathogens, and both viruses have more extensive replication as compared to vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) for example (Kundig TM et al., 1996, Immunity). However, whereas LCMV Armstrong is eventually cleared from the body, MCMV becomes latent. It is possible that differences exist between MCMV and LCMV infections with respect to the duration of antigen presentation during the acute phase but virus levels peak in the spleen and liver around day 4 post-infection in case of MCMV (Cicin-Sain L, 2008, J. Virol.; Stacey MA et al., 2011, J.Immunol) but also in case of LCMV (Buchmeier MJ et al., 1980, Adv. Immunol)."

Adoptive transfer of P14 cells in LCMV and MCMV infected mice at different time points would tell more about the time points of optimal priming of these cells, but differences in expansion could still be due to differences in the duration of antigen presentation, or due to differences in the local pro-inflammatory environment (or by both in combination). Thus, such adoptive transfers do not discriminate between prolonged antigen presentation and increased inflammation as both can lead to increased costimulatory molecule expression. Also, curtailing the viral replication would change the pro-inflammatory environment."
