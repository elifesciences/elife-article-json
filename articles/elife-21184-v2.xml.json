However, the significance of the multiple parallel transport pathways that the receptors constitute is poorly understood because only limited numbers of cargo proteins have been reported. Here, we identified cargo proteins specific to the 12 species of human import receptors with a high-throughput method that employs stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture, an in vitro reconstituted transport system, and quantitative mass spectrometry. The identified cargoes illuminated the manner of cargo allocation to the receptors. The redundancies of the receptors vary widely depending on the cargo protein. Cargoes of the same receptor are functionally related to one another, and the predominant protein groups in the cargo cohorts differ among the receptors. Thus, the receptors are linked to distinct biological processes by the nature of their cargoes."

From well-characterized proteins that have not been reported as cargoes, (i) proteins ranked high (within the top 15% in the 2nd-Z-rankings or 4% in the 3rd-Z-rankings), around presumptive cutoffs (within about top 15\u201325% in the 2nd-Z-rankings), or lower and (ii) highly ranked proteins that are suspected as indirect cargoes or false positives based on their well-known features, e.g., PMPCA, GALE, UAP1, NQO2, EEF1A2, RAB2A, RAB8A, S100A4, S100A6, S100A13, and S100P, were selected and analyzed. Proteins in (i) verify the cargo identification and cutoff setting, and proteins in (ii) serve for finding indirect cargoes and false positives. The negative rate of these bead halo assays should be higher than the true overall false positive rate of the SILAC-Tp, because proteins in (ii) were selected preferentially. GST or GST-NTR was attached to glutathione-Sepharose beads, mixed with an extract of <i>E. coli</i> expressing GFP or a GFP-fusion protein, and observed by fluorescence microscopy. Q69L-Ran, which inhibits the NTR\u2013cargo functional binding, was added as appropriate. The contrast of the bead fluorescence between the GST and GST-NTR indicates the binding, and the inhibition of this binding by Q69L-Ran certifies the specificity of the binding; ++ or +, positive; \u00b1 or \u2013, negative. <b>Summary of the results</b> (p2\u20135): The results are summarized in both 2nd- and 3rd-Z-rank order. The 2nd-Z-15% and 3rd-Z-4% cargoes are indicated by cyan, and positive binding (++ or +) is indicated by blue. <b>Trn-1</b> (p6\u20138): The GFP-fusion proteins were divided into five groups (A\u2013E) according to the expression levels. Because GFP binds weakly to Trn-1, the concentrations of GFP (control) and GFP-fusion proteins were equalized within each group, and the binding was observed in the same conditions. The images are comparable within a group. <b>Trn-2</b> (p9): GFP weakly binds to Trn-2, and the concentrations of GFP and GFP-fusion proteins were equalized. The images are comparable. Proteins whose ranks differed substantially between the Trn-1 and Trn-2 Z-ranking were assayed. <b>Imp-13</b> (p10\u201313): GFP does not bind to Imp-13, and GFP was added to the control mixture at the highest concentration. Three images (GST, GST-Imp-13, and GST-Imp-13\u00a0+\u00a0Q69L-Ran) for each GFP-fusion protein were acquired under identical conditions, and the background intensities and dynamic ranges were equalized. <b>Trn-SR</b> (p14\u201316): GFP weakly binds to Trn-SR, and the procedures were similar to those used for Trn-1. The GFP-fusion proteins were divided into four groups (A\u2013D), and the images are comparable within a group. <b>Imp-\u03b1/\u03b2</b> (p17\u201320): GFP does not bind to Imp-\u03b1 or -\u03b2, and the procedures were similar to those used for Imp-13. GST-Imp-\u03b1<sub>2</sub> lacks the N-terminal Imp-\u03b2-binding domain. <b>Western blotting</b> (p21\u201322): The GFP-fusion proteins in the <i>E. coli</i> extracts were relatively quantified by Western blotting using an anti-GFP antibody (Roche). The extracts containing the amounts of protein (ng) indicated at the bottoms were loaded. The arrowheads indicate the expected full-length products. The GFP-moieties including those of the partial products were quantified by chemiluminescence. GFP was used as the standard. The Western blots were replicated more than three times. <b>Accessions and sequences</b> (p23\u201327): The cDNAs were cloned from a HeLa cDNA library by PCR. The accession numbers of the proteins are listed. If the sequence of a used protein is different from that in the database, the deleted, substituting, or inserted amino acids are indicated by the colors. The sequences that matched perfectly are not presented."

For example, the L/H ratios of a Trn-1 2nd-Z-15% cargo GLUD1 (P00367, ranked 110th and 342nd by the second and third Z-score, respectively) deviated largely in the three replicates of SILAC-Tp with Trn-1 (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). Panels (A\u2013H) show EICs of the indicated peptide (trypsin targets, K and R, are written in lower cases) in the three (three Ctl and there +Trn) experiments (some peptides were not identified in all the experiments). Magenta letters indicate the quantified peptides and L/H rations. In panel (A), the elution time of the peptide TAMkYNLGLDLr differs largely between the expriment-1 Ctl and experiment-2 +Trn-1, the peak shape of the experiment-2 +Trn-1 is irregular, and the L/H ratio of it is much higher than those of other peptides in +Trn-1 experiments (B and E). Thus, there is concern about misidentification. Because the L/H count of GLUD1 in the experiment-2 +Trn-1 is two (TAMkYNLGLDLr and NLNHVSYGr, A and B) and the L/H ratio of a protein is defined as the median, the L/H ratio of GLUD1 in the expriment-2 +Trn-1 is affected by the L/H ratio of TAMkYNLGLDLr. Exclusion of the L/H ratio of TAMkYNLGLDLr in the experiment-2 +Trn-1 lowers the Z-score rank of GLUD1 significantly. In panel (C), the chromatogram of the peptide HGGTIPIVPTAEFQDr in the experiment-1 Ctl has an irregular peak, and the L/H ratio of it is much higher than those of other peptides in the Ctl experiments (A\u2013H). Thus, overlap with other peptide or other failures may be possible. However, the L/H count of GLUD1 in the experiment-1 Ctl is four (TAMkYNLGLDLr, HGGTIPIVPTAEFQDr, ALASLMTYk, and GASIVEDkLVEDLr) and the value of HGGTIPIVPTAEFQDr does not affect the median. (The L/H ratio of TAMkYNLGLDLr, whose EIC differ between the experiment-1 Ctl and expriment-2 +Trn in (A) as mentioned above, may affect the L/H ratio of GLUD1 in the experiment-1 Ctl, but we assumed that it is reliable.) As above, the L/H ratios of proteins with low L/H counts (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>) may be affected by LC-MS/MS artifacts, and misidentification can be avoided by referring to the EICs. All the EICs and MS spectra in this work can be accessed by downloading the mass spectrometry data and Proteome Discoverer software (see the Materials and methods and <a href=\"#SD13-data\">Supplementary file 12A</a>)."

However, the significance of the multiple parallel transport pathways that the receptors constitute is poorly understood because only limited numbers of cargo proteins have been reported. Here, we identified cargo proteins specific to the 12 species of human import receptors with a high-throughput method that employs stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture, an in vitro reconstituted transport system, and quantitative mass spectrometry. The identified cargoes illuminated the manner of cargo allocation to the receptors. The redundancies of the receptors vary widely depending on the cargo protein. Cargoes of the same receptor are functionally related to one another, and the predominant protein groups in the cargo cohorts differ among the receptors. Thus, the receptors are linked to distinct biological processes by the nature of their cargoes."

From well-characterized proteins that have not been reported as cargoes, (i) proteins ranked high (within the top 15% in the 2nd-Z-rankings or 4% in the 3rd-Z-rankings), around presumptive cutoffs (within about top 15\u201325% in the 2nd-Z-rankings), or lower and (ii) highly ranked proteins that are suspected as indirect cargoes or false positives based on their well-known features, e.g., PMPCA, GALE, UAP1, NQO2, EEF1A2, RAB2A, RAB8A, S100A4, S100A6, S100A13, and S100P, were selected and analyzed. Proteins in (i) verify the cargo identification and cutoff setting, and proteins in (ii) serve for finding indirect cargoes and false positives. The negative rate of these bead halo assays should be higher than the true overall false positive rate of the SILAC-Tp, because proteins in (ii) were selected preferentially. GST or GST-NTR was attached to glutathione-Sepharose beads, mixed with an extract of <i>E. coli</i> expressing GFP or a GFP-fusion protein, and observed by fluorescence microscopy. Q69L-Ran, which inhibits the NTR\u2013cargo functional binding, was added as appropriate. The contrast of the bead fluorescence between the GST and GST-NTR indicates the binding, and the inhibition of this binding by Q69L-Ran certifies the specificity of the binding; ++ or +, positive; \u00b1 or \u2013, negative. <b>Summary of the results</b> (p2\u20135): The results are summarized in both 2nd- and 3rd-Z-rank order. The 2nd-Z-15% and 3rd-Z-4% cargoes are indicated by cyan, and positive binding (++ or +) is indicated by blue. <b>Trn-1</b> (p6\u20138): The GFP-fusion proteins were divided into five groups (A\u2013E) according to the expression levels. Because GFP binds weakly to Trn-1, the concentrations of GFP (control) and GFP-fusion proteins were equalized within each group, and the binding was observed in the same conditions. The images are comparable within a group. <b>Trn-2</b> (p9): GFP weakly binds to Trn-2, and the concentrations of GFP and GFP-fusion proteins were equalized. The images are comparable. Proteins whose ranks differed substantially between the Trn-1 and Trn-2 Z-ranking were assayed. <b>Imp-13</b> (p10\u201313): GFP does not bind to Imp-13, and GFP was added to the control mixture at the highest concentration. Three images (GST, GST-Imp-13, and GST-Imp-13\u00a0+\u00a0Q69L-Ran) for each GFP-fusion protein were acquired under identical conditions, and the background intensities and dynamic ranges were equalized. <b>Trn-SR</b> (p14\u201316): GFP weakly binds to Trn-SR, and the procedures were similar to those used for Trn-1. The GFP-fusion proteins were divided into four groups (A\u2013D), and the images are comparable within a group. <b>Imp-\u03b1/\u03b2</b> (p17\u201320): GFP does not bind to Imp-\u03b1 or -\u03b2, and the procedures were similar to those used for Imp-13. GST-Imp-\u03b1<sub>2</sub> lacks the N-terminal Imp-\u03b2-binding domain. <b>Western blotting</b> (p21\u201322): The GFP-fusion proteins in the <i>E. coli</i> extracts were relatively quantified by Western blotting using an anti-GFP antibody (Roche). The extracts containing the amounts of protein (ng) indicated at the bottoms were loaded. The arrowheads indicate the expected full-length products. The GFP-moieties including those of the partial products were quantified by chemiluminescence. GFP was used as the standard. The Western blots were replicated more than three times. <b>Accessions and sequences</b> (p23\u201327): The cDNAs were cloned from a HeLa cDNA library by PCR. The accession numbers of the proteins are listed. If the sequence of a used protein is different from that in the database, the deleted, substituting, or inserted amino acids are indicated by the colors. The sequences that matched perfectly are not presented."

Panels (A\u2013H) show EICs of the indicated peptide (trypsin targets, K and R, are written in lower cases) in the three (three Ctl and there +Trn) experiments (some peptides were not identified in all the experiments). Magenta letters indicate the quantified peptides and L/H rations. In panel (A), the elution time of the peptide TAMkYNLGLDLr differs largely between the expriment-1 Ctl and experiment-2 +Trn-1, the peak shape of the experiment-2 +Trn-1 is irregular, and the L/H ratio of it is much higher than those of other peptides in +Trn-1 experiments (B and E). Thus, there is concern about misidentification. Because the L/H count of GLUD1 in the experiment-2 +Trn-1 is two (TAMkYNLGLDLr and NLNHVSYGr, A and B) and the L/H ratio of a protein is defined as the median, the L/H ratio of GLUD1 in the expriment-2 +Trn-1 is affected by the L/H ratio of TAMkYNLGLDLr. Exclusion of the L/H ratio of TAMkYNLGLDLr in the experiment-2 +Trn-1 lowers the Z-score rank of GLUD1 significantly. In panel (C), the chromatogram of the peptide HGGTIPIVPTAEFQDr in the experiment-1 Ctl has an irregular peak, and the L/H ratio of it is much higher than those of other peptides in the Ctl experiments (A\u2013H). Thus, overlap with other peptide or other failures may be possible. However, the L/H count of GLUD1 in the experiment-1 Ctl is four (TAMkYNLGLDLr, HGGTIPIVPTAEFQDr, ALASLMTYk, and GASIVEDkLVEDLr) and the value of HGGTIPIVPTAEFQDr does not affect the median. (The L/H ratio of TAMkYNLGLDLr, whose EIC differ between the experiment-1 Ctl and expriment-2 +Trn in (A) as mentioned above, may affect the L/H ratio of GLUD1 in the experiment-1 Ctl, but we assumed that it is reliable.) As above, the L/H ratios of proteins with low L/H counts (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>) may be affected by LC-MS/MS artifacts, and misidentification can be avoided by referring to the EICs. All the EICs and MS spectra in this work can be accessed by downloading the mass spectrometry data and Proteome Discoverer software (see the Materials and methods and <a href=\"#SD13-data\">Supplementary file 12A</a>)."

These nuclear pores are lined with FG-repeat domains that constitute a permeability barrier, and only macromolecules that reversibly interact with the FG-repeats can permeate this barrier (<a href=\"#bib52\">Schmidt and G\u00f6rlich, 2016</a>). One such group of proteins, the importin (Imp)-\u03b2 family proteins, are nucleocytoplasmic transport receptors (NTRs) that primarily carry nuclear proteins and small RNAs as their cargoes through the nuclear pores, although non-importin family NTRs also act depending on the cargo and physiological conditions (<a href=\"#bib30\">Kose et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Lu et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Weberruss et al., 2013</a>). The human genome encodes 20 species of Imp-\u03b2 family NTRs, of which 10 [Imp-\u03b2, transportin (Trn)-1,\u00a0-2, -SR (-3), Imp-4,\u00a0-5 (RanBP5), -7,\u00a0-8, -9, and -11] are nuclear import receptors, 7 [exportin (Exp)-1 (CRM1), -2 (CAS/CSE1L), -5,\u00a0-6, -7, -t, and RanBP17] are export receptors, 2 (Imp-13 and Exp-4) are bi-directional receptors, and the function of RanBP6 is undetermined (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kimura and Imamoto, 2014</a>). These NTRs constitute multiple parallel transport pathways. The basic mechanism of directional transport was elucidated in the early years (<a href=\"#bib12\">G\u00f6rlich and Kutay, 1999</a>), but even today, the number of NTR-specific cargoes that has been reported is surprisingly small, hindering a biological understanding of the nucleocytoplasmic transport system."

The \u03b2-like importin-binding (BIB) domain is another NTR-binding site (<a href=\"#bib17\">J\u00e4kel and G\u00f6rlich, 1998</a>), but its consensus sequence and NTR specificity remain obscure. Among the NTRs, Imp-\u03b2 exclusively uses one of the seven species of the Imp-\u03b1 family of proteins as an adapter for cargo binding, and many Imp-\u03b1/\u03b2 cargoes have been reported, although Imp-\u03b2 also directly binds to cargoes (<a href=\"#bib10\">Goldfarb et al., 2004</a>). Among the import receptors, Trn-1 and its closest homolog Trn-2 have the second-highest number of cargoes reported thus far, and the PY-NLS motif has been defined, although in some cases the motif is difficult to recognize because of sequence diversity and structural disorder is another requisite (<a href=\"#bib55\">Soniat and Chook, 2015</a>, <a href=\"#bib56\">2016</a>). For the cargoes of other NTRs, the consensus structures of NTR-binding sites have hardly been derived because only limited numbers of cargoes have been reported, including Imp-\u03b2-direct cargoes."

                        "text": "There are many reports on the differential spatiotemporal expression of Imp-\u03b2 family NTRs, including tissue specificities in humans (<a href=\"#bib47\">Quan et al., 2008</a>), developmental or spermatogenic stage specificities in mice (<a href=\"#bib38\">Major et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Quan et al., 2008</a>), and tissue or response specificities in plants (<a href=\"#bib13\">Huang et al., 2010</a>). Expression regulation is not only transcriptional but also miRNA-mediated (<a href=\"#bib34\">Li et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Szczyrba et al., 2013</a>) or locally translationally mediated (<a href=\"#bib45\">Perry and Fainzilber, 2009</a>). Additionally, the NTRs are functionally regulated by protein modifications (<a href=\"#bib70\">Wang et al., 2009</a>), inhibitory factors (<a href=\"#bib35\">Lieu et al., 2014</a>), and specific anchorings (<a href=\"#bib39\">Makhnevych et al., 2003</a>). These nucleocytoplasmic transport regulations must significantly influence cellular physiology, and their significance may be elucidated if the affected cargoes can be specified. Indeed, in previous studies, NTR regulations have been linked to cellular responses through the functions of specific cargoes. For example, in prostate cancer cells treated with a cinnamaldehyde derivative, the expression of Imp-7 and the transcription factor Egr1 are induced, and the Egr1 imported by Imp-7 activates apoptotic gene transcription (<a href=\"#bib22\">Kang et al., 2013</a>). In another example, when the nuclear import of some ribosomal proteins (RPs) is inhibited by the repression of Imp-7 expression, other unassembled RPs restrain the negative regulator of p53 Mdm2 and thereby activate p53 to inhibit cell growth (<a href=\"#bib11\">Golomb et al., 2012</a>). Additionally, the inhibition of Trn-2 by the caspase-generated HuR (ELAVL1) fragment is crucial for the cytoplasmic retention of full-length HuR, which induces myogenesis (<a href=\"#bib3\">Beauchamp et al., 2010</a>) or staurosporine-induced apoptosis (<a href=\"#bib67\">von Roretz et al., 2011</a>). In many other studies, mutations of particular NTR genes in model organisms, including yeast, flies, and plants, have resulted in defects in specific biological processes (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kimura and Imamoto, 2014</a>). Thus, each NTR has its own inherent biological significance. However, the details of the molecular processes are largely uncharacterized because the responsible cargoes have not been identified. If we could identify more cargoes, further studies of cellular regulation by nucleocytoplasmic transport would be possible."

The transport system consists of permeabilized HeLa cells labeled with \u2018heavy\u2019 amino acids by SILAC, unlabeled HeLa nuclear extract depleted of Imp-\u03b2 family NTRs and RCC1, unlabeled HeLa cytosolic extract depleted of Imp-\u03b2 family NTRs, one species of recombinant NTR, p10/NTF2, and an ATP regeneration system. Unlabeled \u2018light\u2019 proteins in the nuclear extract are imported into the nuclei of the permeabilized cells. Simultaneously, a control reaction without the NTR is performed. Next, the proteins are extracted from the nuclei and identified and quantified by LC-MS/MS. The recipient nuclei contain both the imported and endogenous proteins, and the ratio of the imported to the endogenous fraction of a protein is calculated as the unlabeled/labeled or light/heavy (L/H) ratio. The quotient of the L/H ratios with the NTR (+NTR) and without it (control), that\u00a0is, (L/H<sub>+NTR</sub>)/(L/H<sub>Ctl</sub>), of a protein is defined as the +NTR/Ctl value and is used as the index for cargo potentiality."

To calculate the +NTR/Ctl value, one protein has to be quantified in both the control and +NTR reactions, and we discarded L/H<sub>+NTR</sub> values that lacked the counterpart L/H<sub>Ctl</sub> values. We performed three replicates of SILAC-Tp for each of the 12 NTRs. In the three replicates, 1235 to 1671 proteins were assigned with +NTR/Ctl values three times, and 364 to 502 proteins were assigned only twice (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). We did not consider proteins with single +NTR/Ctl values, although a protein with only a single but high +NTR/Ctl value may still be a cargo (see below). To normalize the index values of the three replicates, the Z-scores of the log<sub>2</sub>(+NTR/Ctl) were calculated within each replicate (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A and B</a>). Ranking the proteins that have three +NTR/Ctl values by the median of the three Z-scores may reasonably sort the candidate cargoes. However, if the lower Z-score of a protein with only two +NTR/Ctl values is higher than the median Z-scores of those candidate cargoes, the protein may also be a candidate cargo. Thus, we ranked the proteins by the second (the lower of the two or the middle of the three) Z-scores, and termed the result the 2nd-Z-ranking (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>)."

For an unbiased evaluation, we employed the lists of cargoes consolidated by other researchers (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chook and S\u00fcel, 2011</a>). Twenty-seven reported cargoes were included in the 2nd-Z-ranking (totaling 1649 proteins; <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>, Trn-1 \u2018Report and feature\u2019). We calculated the reported cargo rates (to serve as a proxy for precision), recall, and Fisher\u2019s exact test p-values for rank cutoffs in increments of 1%. Computing reported cargo rate requires deciding which candidate cargoes should be considered as false positives. Since a gold standard set of definitely non-cargo proteins is not available, it is not clear which previously unreported cargoes should be counted as false positives, and which, if any, should be discarded as unclear. Therefore, we estimated reported cargo rates in two ways: (i) treating all the 1622 proteins not reported as cargoes as negative examples (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3A</a> and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1A</a>); and (ii) discarding proteins with undetermined or nuclear subcellular localization according to Uniprot annotation, and treating the remaining 259 non-nuclear proteins as negative examples (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3A</a> and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1B</a>). In the former case, the reported cargo rate corresponds to a lower bound on the precision, and even in the latter case, the reported cargo rates are expected to underestimate precision, because almost certainly some of the proteins that we exclude as unclear are in fact true cargoes."

If RanGTP (a Q69L GTP-fixed mutant) (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bischoff and Ponstingl, 1995</a>) inhibits the protein\u2013Trn-1 binding, the functionality of the binding is verified. For all the bead halo assays in this work, we principally selected well-characterized proteins that have not been reported as cargoes from (i) proteins ranked high (within the top 15% in the 2nd-Z-ranking or 4% in the 3rd-Z-ranking, see below), around presumptive cutoffs (within about top 15\u201325% in the 2nd-Z-ranking), or lower and (ii) highly ranked proteins that are suspected as indirect cargoes or false positives based on their well-known features, for\u00a0example, S100A6 or EEF1A2 (see the legend of <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>). The negative rate of the bead halo assays should be higher than the true overall false-positive rate of the SILAC-Tp, because proteins in (ii) are selected preferentially.

Although the assays were not comprehensive, many of the highly ranked proteins are <i>bona fide</i> Trn-1 cargoes. The highly ranked proteins that did not bind to Trn-1 in the assays are still candidate indirect cargoes that may form complexes with other proteins that directly bind to Trn-1 (see the case of POLE3 for Imp-13 below). As an example of a protein with only a single but high Z-score (+NTR/Ctl value), DIMT1 bound to Trn-1 (DHRS4 with Imp-\u03b2 is another example), but we did not consider such proteins."

The percentages of PY-NLS motif-containing proteins within a window width of 50 positions were higher in the range of the top 200, indicating a higher rate of PY-NLS motif-containing proteins within the top 250 (top 15%). The reported Trn-1 cargoes were similarly distributed in the Trn-2 2nd-Z-ranking (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>, Trn-2 \u2018Report or feature\u2019). Because Trn-1 and -2 share nearly the same reported cargoes (<a href=\"#bib64\">Twyffels et al., 2014</a>), this result demonstrates the reproducibility of the SILAC-Tp method.

The Imp-13 2nd-Z-ranking (totaling 2060 proteins) includes eight reported cargoes (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>, Imp-13), and seven of these are ranked in the top 244 (top 12%; p=2.83\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>\u22127</sup>; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>; <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplements 1A</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s2\">2A</a>). In bead halo assays for a subset of the ranked proteins, 24 novel candidate cargoes in the top 326 (top 16%) bound directly to Imp-13, and RanGTP inhibited the binding (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>; <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>, Imp-13; <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>). One component of a reported cargo complex, that\u00a0is, POLE3, did not bind to Imp-13, but its binding partner CHRAC1 (<a href=\"#bib69\">Walker et al., 2009</a>) did. Thus, the binding partners of the direct cargoes are also ranked high. Many reported Trn-SR cargoes are SR-domain proteins (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chook and S\u00fcel, 2011</a>), and they can be grouped into either SR-rich splicing factors (SFs) or other SR-domain proteins. The Trn-SR 2nd-Z-ranking (totaling 2021 proteins) contains three reported cargoes (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>, Trn-SR), and they are ranked in the top 55 (top 3%; p=1.91\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>\u22125</sup>; <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>; <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). The 2nd-Z-ranking contains seven SR-rich SFs other than the reported SFs, and five of these are ranked in the top 90 (top 4%; p=7.61\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>\u221218</sup>). The 2nd-Z-ranking also contains another four proteins that are annotated with \u2018RS-domain\u2019 in UniProt, and three of these are ranked in the top 202 (top 10%; p=3.65\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>\u22123</sup>). Finally, in bead halo assays for a subset, 11 novel candidate cargoes in the top 237 (top 12%) bound directly to Trn-SR, and RanGTP inhibited the binding (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>; <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>, Trn-SR; <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>). Hence, the 2nd-Z-15% cargoes could also be defined for Imp-13 (309 proteins) and Trn-SR (302 proteins), and we applied this cutoff to the other NTRs that have few reported cargoes. The 2nd-Z-15% cargoes of the 12 NTRs are presented in <a href=\"#SD4-data\">Supplementary file 3</a>. Some of the 2nd-Z-15% cargoes with low numbers of L/H counts showed deviation in Z-scores or L/H ratios in the three replicates of SILAC-Tp (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>), and an example of their quantitation qualities is presented in <a href=\"#SD5-data\">Supplementary file 4</a>."

To select proteins that have high Z-scores in all the three replicates, we next ranked the proteins that had three +NTR/Ctl values by the third (lowest) Z-scores (3rd-Z-ranking). The reported cargo rates, recall, and p-values were calculated in 1% rank increments under two assumptions similarly to the case of 2nd-Z-ranking (<a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3A and B</a> and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 1\u2014source data 1C and 1D</a>).

Thus, most of the proteins that ranked in the top 4% (49 proteins) of the 3rd-Z-ranking are highly reliable cargoes, and we termed these proteins the 3rd-Z-4% cargoes. In a comparison between the Trn-1 2nd-Z-15% and 3rd-Z-4% cargoes, most of the 3rd-Z-4% cargoes were also 2nd-Z-15% cargoes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>).

To explore the roles of the NTR cargoes, the 3rd-Z-4% and 2nd-Z-15% cargoes of each NTR were analyzed for enrichment of Gene Ontology (GO) terms (<a href=\"#bib9\">Gene Ontology Consortium, 2015</a>) using g:Profiler (<a href=\"#bib50\">Reimand et al., 2016</a>). For all the combinations of a GO term and an NTR, the number of cargoes annotated with the term and the significance (p-values according to g:SCS) of the term enrichment are listed (<a href=\"#SD7-data\">Supplementary files 6B, 6C</a>, <a href=\"#SD8-data\">7,</a> and <a href=\"#SD9-data\">8</a>). Depending on the hierarchy of the GO terms, the terms are significantly annotated (p&lt;0.05) to the cargo cohorts of none to 12 of the NTRs. Broader terms with smaller term depths are linked to more NTRs, whereas more defined terms with larger term depths are linked to fewer NTRs. Indeed, all 12 of the NTRs are linked to many broad terms, although the cargo numbers and the significances vary widely. Because similar terms were listed redundantly, we selected representative GO terms from those enriched significantly (p&lt;0.05) for the 3rd-Z-4% cargoes of the 12 NTRs and tabulated the correspondences between the cargoes and the annotated terms (<a href=\"#SD10-data\">Supplementary file 9</a>). To compare the GO terms that are specifically linked to each NTR, we listed the terms that are enriched significantly for the cargoes of four or fewer NTRs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figures 5</a> and <a href=\"#fig6\">6</a>). Here, again we extracted the representative terms to decrease the size of the list. The selected terms for the 3rd-Z-4% cargoes plainly exhibit the roles of the cargo cohorts. For example, significant numbers of Imp-4,\u00a0-7 and Exp-4 cargoes are annotated with DNA recombination or DNA conformation (geometric) change (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>; <a href=\"#SD10-data\">Supplementary file 9</a>), which are terms for\u00a0biological\u00a0processes (BPs). These cargoes are also annotated with chromatin, which is a term for cellular component (CC; <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>; <a href=\"#SD10-data\">Supplementary file 9</a>), and DNA binding, which is for molecular function (MF; <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>; <a href=\"#SD10-data\">Supplementary file 9</a>), all related to DNA recombination and DNA conformation change. For another example, the Trn-SR cargoes are significantly annotated with a range of terms for BPs that are related to cell division or nuclear division and terms for CCs that include condensed chromosome, kinetochore, spindle, and centrosome. Similarly, most of the examined NTRs are linked to terms for BPs via the 3rd-Z-4% cargoes (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>) as follows: Imp-\u03b2, -4, -7, and Trn-SR are linked to chromatin or chromosome organization; Imp-\u03b2, -4, and -13 are linked to DNA repair; Imp-\u03b2 is linked to mRNA capping; Trn-SR and Exp-4 are linked to mRNA polyadenylation; Trn-1 and -2 are linked to mRNA stabilization; Trn-2, -SR, Imp-5, -9, and Exp-4 are linked to ribosome biogenesis or rRNA processing; Trn-SR is linked to protein folding, modification, ubiquitination, and catabolic process; and Imp-4 and -7 are linked to apoptosis. The NTRs are also consistently linked to the terms for CCs and MFs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>) as follows: Trn-SR, Imp-5, -9, and Exp-4 are linked to Cajal body; Imp-\u03b2 is linked to cap-binding complex; and Trn-SR is linked to pre-mRNA binding, snoRNA binding, and RNA helicase activity."

The excerpted list of terms enriched significantly for the cargoes of four or fewer NTRs contains terms partially different from those in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figures 5</a> and <a href=\"#fig6\">6</a> (<a href=\"#SD7-data\">Supplementary file 6A</a>), but many of the NTRs are still linked to terms similar to those of the 3rd-Z-4% cargoes. For example, Imp-\u03b2 and Trn-SR are linked to terms related to cell or nuclear division by the 3rd-Z-4% cargoes (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>) and to partially different terms that are still related to cell or nuclear division by the 2nd-Z-15% cargoes (<a href=\"#SD7-data\">Supplementary file 6A</a>). Additionally, Imp-4 is linked to terms related to DNA structure regulation, DNA repair, and apoptosis in both lists. Similarly, most of the examined NTRs are linked in both lists to similar terms that are related to any of the following: chromatin organization, chromosome organization, DNA repair, ribosome biogenesis, protein modification, cell division, nuclear division, and apoptosis. Thus, we regard the 3rd-Z-4% list as a core table of the cargo roles. Naturally, the 2nd-Z-15% cargoes linked the NTRs to additional terms (<a href=\"#SD7-data\">Supplementary file 6A</a>) as follows: Imp-\u03b2, -4, and Trn-SR are linked to DNA-dependent DNA replication; Trn-1 and Imp-7 are linked to gene silencing by RNA; Imp-\u03b2, -7, and -13 are linked to rRNA transcription; Imp-\u03b2 and Trn-SR are linked to protein methylation; Trn-SR is linked to protein peptidyl-prolyl isomerization; Trn-2, Imp-4, and -8 are linked to circadian rhythm; Imp-\u03b2, -4,\u00a0-13, and Trn-SR are linked to terms for CCs and MFs that are related to RNA polymerase (RNAP) II transcription; and subsets of the NTRs are linked to varying terms that are related to differentiation, development, and response. As an important result, we have illustrated the general framework of the division of roles among the NTRs for the first time, in which one NTR is linked to many BPs and conversely each broadly defined BP is supported by many NTRs, but each closely defined BP is supported by a restricted number of NTRs. One typical example is the allocation of mRNA processing factors (see below)."

However, many other terms related to mRNA processing were linked to more NTRs, and conversely, all the NTRs were implicated in mRNA processing. The 2nd-\u00a0and\u00a03rd-Z-rankings for the 12 NTRs included 275 and 242 proteins, respectively, that were annotated with mRNA processing (<a href=\"#SD7-data\">Supplementary file 6B and 6C</a>). To see the allocation of these proteins to the NTRs, the ranks of these proteins are arranged in a table (<a href=\"#SD12-data\">Supplementary file 11A</a>). The 2nd-\u00a0and\u00a03rd-Z-rankings revealed similar results. As summarized for the 2nd-Z-ranking (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>), particular groups of the mRNA-processing factors are allocated to specific NTRs, showing that each NTR is linked to distinct reactions in mRNA processing: the proteins related to mRNA capping are allocated to Imp-\u03b2 almost exclusively; hnRNP A0 is allocated to Trn-1,\u00a0-2, Imp-4,\u00a0-11, and others; hnRNP A1, A2B1, A3, D, F, H1\u20133, and M are allocated to Trn-1 and -2, and additionally Imp-9 and Exp-4; hnRNP U-like 1 are allocated to Imp-7,\u00a0-8, and -9; SR-rich SFs are primarily allocated to Trn-SR and secondarily to Imp-7,\u00a0-8, and -9; SFs 3A and B are allocated to Imp-4, -7, -8, -9, -11, and Exp-4; PQ-rich SF is allocated to Imp-4,\u00a0-7, -8, and Exp-4; snRNP A\u2013C is allocated to Imp-4,\u00a0-7, -8, and Exp-4; exon junction complex (EJC) components are exclusively allocated to Imp-11 and -13; cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) 1 is allocated to Imp-7 and -9; CPSF5 (NUDT21), 6, and 7 are less specifically allocated to other NTRs; general transcription factor IIF is allocated to Imp-\u03b2, -4, and Trn-SR; and RNAP II associating factors are allocated to Trn-SR and separately to other NTRs. Thus, the NTRs import distinctive subsets of mRNA processing factors. In the 2nd-Z-ranking, the SR-rich SFs were not allocated to Imp-5, but they were identified as the Imp-5 3rd-Z-4% cargoes. Thus, subsets of proteins involved in a broadly defined BP, for\u00a0example, mRNA processing, are allocated to different NTRs, in a manner representative of role division among the NTRs."

To see the allocations of all the RPs to the NTRs, the ranks of the RPs in the 2nd-Z-rankings are arranged in a table (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). Because the +NTR/Ctl values were obtained for most of the RPs in the three SILAC-Tp replicates, the second Z-scores are the median Z-scores in most cases, and they should fairly reflect the import efficiencies. Half of the RPs are included in the 2nd-Z-15% cargoes of one to five NTRs, and most of the RPs are ranked in the top 30% in the 2nd-Z-rankings of additional NTRs. Surprisingly, most RPs, especially the 60S subunit proteins, are ranked in the top 50% of most of the 2nd-Z-rankings, and few RPs are ranked lower. These findings imply that most of the RPs are allocated to multiple NTRs, but the import efficiencies vary depending on the NTR. Indeed, several RPs are reported cargoes of multiple NTRs (<a href=\"#bib17\">J\u00e4kel and G\u00f6rlich, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">J\u00e4kel et al., 2002</a>). Imp-7,\u00a0-8, and -9 primarily import RPs, Imp-11 and Exp-4 secondarily import RPs, and all other NTRs also contribute to the import of RPs to some extent. Among the highly homologous NTR pairs, Trn-2 and Imp-8 import RPs more efficiently than Trn-1 and Imp-7, respectively, which indicates that RP import is one of the roles shared unequally by similar NTRs. This differentiation is clearer in the 3rd-Z-rankings (<a href=\"#SD12-data\">Supplementary file 11B</a>)."

Transcription cofactors (annotated with \u2018transcription factor activity, protein binding\u2019), which may engage in gene-specific transcription, are significantly enriched in the 3rd-Z-4% cargoes of only three NTRs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>; <a href=\"#SD7-data\">Supplementary file 6B</a>). Nonetheless, transcription factors (sequence-specific DNA binding) are enriched in the Imp-\u03b2 2nd-Z-15% cargoes, and cofactors (protein binding) are enriched in the 2nd-Z-15% cargoes of 10 NTRs (<a href=\"#SD7-data\">Supplementary file 6C</a>). Additionally, some transcription factors and cofactors are included in the 2nd-Z-15% cargoes, albeit not enriched.

The proteins annotated with histone modification are enriched in the Imp-\u03b2 and -13 cargoes, and the term may reflect their direct functions. The cargoes of several NTRs annotated with varying types of nuclear receptor signaling may act as cofactors in receptor-regulated transcription. In contrast, many of the transcription factors and cofactors identified as cargoes are annotated differently with various terms related to cell proliferation, development, rhythmic processes, or apoptosis and may act on these processes via transcriptional regulation. Thus, the NTRs import transcription factors and cofactors that work in distinct cellular processes."

Nuclear transcription factor Y subunits \u03b2 (NFYB) and \u03b3 (NFYC) have been reported to be Imp-13 specific cargoes, whereas subunit \u03b1 (NFYA), which has a BIB-like sequence, has been reported to bind to multiple NTRs (<a href=\"#bib21\">Kahle et al., 2005</a>). NFYB is ranked first in both the Imp-13 2nd-\u00a0and\u00a03rd-Z-rankings, and NFYC is a 2nd-Z-15% cargo (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>; <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary files 1</a> and <a href=\"#SD4-data\">3</a>). Additionally, we identified NFYA as a cargo of multiple NTRs. Interestingly, a subunit of the general transcription factor TFIIA (GTF2A2) that interacts with NFYA (<a href=\"#bib51\">Rolland et al., 2014</a>) is also a highly ranked Imp-13 3rd-Z-4% cargo. We could not identify the Imp-13 reported cargo glucocorticoid receptor (<a href=\"#bib62\">Tao et al., 2006</a>) in our MS, but proteins that may interact with nuclear receptors, e.g., thyroid hormone receptor-associated protein 3 (THRAP3) (<a href=\"#bib15\">Ito et al., 1999</a>), RNA-binding protein 14 (RBM14) (<a href=\"#bib16\">Iwasaki et al., 2001</a>), and transcription activator BRG1 (SMARCA4) (<a href=\"#bib8\">Dai et al., 2008</a>), were identified as Imp-13 2nd-Z-15% cargoes. THRAP3 interacts with EJC (<a href=\"#bib33\">Lee et al., 2010</a>), whose subunits, RNA-binding protein RBM8A and mago nashi homolog MAGOH, are well-characterized Imp-13 cargoes (<a href=\"#bib40\">Mingot et al., 2001</a>). RBM8A and MAGOH are highly ranked Imp-13 3rd-Z-4% cargoes, which were not identified as cargoes of the other NTRs with the exception of Trn-1. However, another EJC subunit, that\u00a0is, translation initiation factor 4A-III (EIF4A3) (<a href=\"#bib53\">Shibuya et al., 2004</a>), was identified as an Imp-11 3rd-Z-4% cargo. Thus, the EJC subunits are imported through different pathways. A well-characterized Imp-13 cargo, SUMO-conjugating enzyme UBC9 (UBE2I) (<a href=\"#bib40\">Mingot et al., 2001</a>), was identified as a 3rd-Z-4% cargo, and SUMO2 and SUMO3 were also identified as 3rd-Z-4% cargoes. Components of the chromatin accessibility complex CHRAC15 (CHRAC1) and DNA polymerase \u03b5 subunit 3 (POLE3) are also Imp-13 reported cargoes (<a href=\"#bib69\">Walker et al., 2009</a>), and they are highly ranked 3rd-Z-4% cargoes. In the GO analysis, Imp-13 was linked to chromatin modification by the 2nd-Z-15% cargoes (<a href=\"#SD7-data\">Supplementary file 6A</a>). Nucleolar complex protein 2 homolog (NOC2L) is ranked 10th in both the second and third Z-scores, and lysine-specific demethylase 2A (KDM2A) is ranked second in the second Z-score.

Increasing evidence demonstrates that the import of NUPs through NPCs is important for gene expression (<a href=\"#bib5\">Burns and Wente, 2014</a>). Moreover, many mitochondrial proteins are highly ranked. These proteins preferentially localize to the mitochondria due to chaperon-regulated or cotranslational mechanisms in vivo and might interact with NTRs in the in vitro transport system. The transport system contains cytosolic extract and unlabeled (light) mitochondrial proteins in it could be imported if they interact with NTRs. The (L/H<sub>+NTR</sub>)/(L/H<sub>Ctl</sub>) values of them can be calculated, because LC-MS/MS can quantify low levels of labeled (heavy) proteins whether they are endogenous to the recipient nuclei or residual after washing. Thus, mitochondrial proteins with high (L/H<sub>+NTR</sub>)/(L/H<sub>Ctl</sub>) values are imported proteins even if the import is fortuitous. Nuclear localization is annotated to many mitochondrial proteins (<a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>), and actual nuclear localization is possible as in the cases of AIFM1 and ATFS-1 (<a href=\"#bib41\">Nargund et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Susin et al., 1999</a>). As was the case with the high-throughput cargo identification of the export receptor Exp-1 (CRM1) (<a href=\"#bib20\">K\u0131rl\u0131 et al., 2015</a>), our method identified other seemingly cytoplasmic proteins as cargoes. We did not detect direct binding between the NTRs and some of these cytoplasmic proteins, for\u00a0example, Ras-related Rab family proteins and S100 proteins, in the bead halo assays (<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>), but nuclear import by indirect binding is still possible."

Here, we omitted Imp-\u03b2 because its cargoes include many Imp-\u03b1-dependent indirect cargoes. To define a cargo profile for each NTR, we first defined a set of cargoes by merging the 3rd-Z-4% cargoes of the 11 NTRs other than Imp-\u03b2, which yielded a total of 426 cargoes. We then defined length 426 binary vectors for each NTR with a 1 for each cargo in the top 4% list and a 0 otherwise and input these 11 vectors into R to perform the clustering."

The bead halo assays (<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>) were performed as described (<a href=\"#bib44\">Patel and Rexach, 2008</a>). Briefly, GST or GST-NTR was immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose (GE healthcare), and mixed with an extract of <i>E. coli</i> expressing a GFP-fusion protein in EHBN buffer (10 mM EDTA, 0.5% 1,6-hexanediol, 10 mg/mL bovine serum albumin, and 125 mM NaCl), and the binding was observed by fluorescent microscopy. The GTP-fixed mutant of Ran Q69L-Ran, which inhibits specific NTR\u2013cargo interactions, was added to determine the specificity of the binding. The expression and degradation levels of the GFP-fusion proteins were analyzed, and the concentrations of GFP-moieties were quantified by triplicate quantitative Western blotting of the extracts with an anti-GFP antibody. Because the GFP-moiety weakly bound to GST-Trn-1, GST-Trn-2, and GST-Trn-SR in the bead halo assay, the concentrations of the GFP-fusion proteins and GFP (control) were equalized, and images were acquired and processed under identical condition. In contrast, because the GFP-moiety does not bind to GST-Imp-13, GST-Imp-\u03b2, or GST-Imp-\u03b1, the control reaction mixture for these NTRs contained higher concentration of GFP than any other GFP-fusion proteins. Three images (GST, GST-NTR, and GST-NTR\u00a0+\u00a0Q69L-Ran) for each GFP-fusion protein were acquired under identical conditions, and the background intensities and dynamic ranges were equalized."

However, light proteins contained more in the +NTR sample than in the Ctl sample are imported proteins, and other proteins including (i-iii) should be detected at the same level in the Ctl and +NTR samples.

In the experiment presented there, we labeled total proteins in the nuclear extract by biotin and added the biotin-labeled extract to the in vitro transport system. The labeled proteins were visualized with Cy3-streptavidin in microscopy, or after protein extraction and SDS-PAGE, visualized with HRP-avidin in membrane-blotting. Consistent with the present result of SILAC-Tp, the microscopic observation indicated that some proteins migrated into the nuclei and others bound nonspecifically to the nuclear envelopes or cytoplasmic structures in the absence of recombinant NTRs. The membrane-blotting indicated that the labeled proteins detected in the Ctl sample (without a recombinant NTR) did not increase in the +NTR sample, and these are the proteins (i-iii) mentioned above. Concomitantly, in the membrane-blotting, many proteins that were not detected in the Ctl sample were detected in the +NTR sample. Meanwhile, the microscopic observation clearly indicated that more proteins were imported into the nuclei in the presence of a recombinant NTR. Thus, the proteins that increased in the +NTR sample were imported proteins and we use the ratio of +NTR/Ctl=(L/H<sub>+NTR</sub>)/(L/H<sub>Ctl</sub>) for the index."

The nuclear buffer used here is the same buffer as we used for the preparation of the nuclear extract that was added in the transport reaction, and we did not use denaturant or detergent for the protein extraction. Since the cargo source was the nuclear extract, we needed to quantify the same proteins that are soluble in the same buffer. This buffer selection served to increase the preferable proteins to be quantified in the LC-MS samples by discarding proteins insoluble in this buffer. However, the total protein species in the nuclear extract and those in the final samples may be different.

In our experimental system, the absolute quantities of a heavy (H) protein in the Ctl and +NTR samples should ideally be same, and those of the corresponding light (L) protein reflect the transport efficiency. Thus, a protein that has the L/H<sub>+NTR</sub> value but lacks the L/H<sub>Ctl</sub> value is a candidate cargo if the H<sub>Ctl</sub> is quantified and the L/H<sub>Ctl</sub> value is missing owing to the absence or zero quantity of L<sub>Ctl</sub>, as the reviewer pointed. However, we have discarded such proteins. We now recalculated the L/H ratios with the \u201creplace missing quan values with minimum intensity\u201d option by the Proteome Discoverer software (the results were not added in the manuscript as follows). By this option, missing quantitation values of either L or H peptide (not protein) are replaced with the minimum value quantified in the same LC-MS/MS analysis, and the presumably lowest L/H<sub>Ctl</sub> values are given to the peptides lacking the L<sub>Ctl</sub> but having the H<sub>Ctl</sub> values. If a protein that was assigned with no Z-score in the previous calculation gets two or three Z-scores under this option, or if a protein with one Z-score gets one or two additional Z-scores, the protein will be included in the 2nd-Z-ranking. However, such proteins were unexpectedly rare, and the numbers of proteins added by this option to each of the 2nd-Z-rankings (totaling 1639 to 2060 proteins for each NTR, including both proteins selected and not selected as the 2nd-Z-15% cargoes) were \u22647. Among such proteins only seven listed below were ranked in the top 15%. (Many proteins changed their ranks slightly under this option.) Naturally, the L/H counts (the numbers of quantified peptides) of these proteins in one experiment were low (\u22643). Because the quantitation values with this option are less reliable than those obtained without it, we just listed those proteins here and will not add them to the main lists. For the 3rd-Z-rankings, a few proteins that previously had two or less Z-scores got 3rd Z-scores under this option, but none of them were ranked in the top 4%. Some other proteins lack the L/H<sub>Ctl</sub> ratios presumably because they lack the H<sub>Ctl</sub> values, and for such proteins we have no reason to estimate that the missing L/H<sub>Ctl</sub> ratios are lower than the L/H<sub>+NTR</sub> ratios. Another point is that low protein abundance is not the sole reason for missing quantitation values."
