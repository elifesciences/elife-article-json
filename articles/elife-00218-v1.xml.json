Frh accounts for about 1% of the cytoplasmic protein and forms a huge complex consisting of FrhABG heterotrimers with each a [NiFe] center, four Fe-S clusters and an FAD. Here, we report the structure determined by near-atomic resolution cryo-EM of Frh with and without bound substrate F<sub>420</sub>. The polypeptide chains of FrhB, for which there was no homolog, was traced de novo from the EM map. The 1.2-MDa complex contains 12 copies of the heterotrimer, which unexpectedly form a spherical protein shell with a hollow core. The cryo-EM map reveals strong electron density of the chains of metal clusters running parallel to the protein shell, and the F<sub>420</sub>-binding site is located at the end of the chain near the outside of the spherical structure."

Frh accounts for about 1% of the cytoplasmic protein and forms a huge complex consisting of FrhABG heterotrimers with each a [NiFe] center, four Fe-S clusters and an FAD. Here, we report the structure determined by near-atomic resolution cryo-EM of Frh with and without bound substrate F<sub>420</sub>. The polypeptide chains of FrhB, for which there was no homolog, was traced de novo from the EM map. The 1.2-MDa complex contains 12 copies of the heterotrimer, which unexpectedly form a spherical protein shell with a hollow core. The cryo-EM map reveals strong electron density of the chains of metal clusters running parallel to the protein shell, and the F<sub>420</sub>-binding site is located at the end of the chain near the outside of the spherical structure."

These enzymes are involved in many metabolic pathways in microbial ecosystems, notably in methanogenesis. The members of the [NiFe]-hydrogenase family are composed of at least two subunits, large (\u223c60 kDa) and small (\u223c30 kDa), which contain a [NiFe] dinuclear metal center and three iron\u2013sulfur (Fe-S) clusters, respectively. The family is classified into five distantly related groups based on a phylogenetic analysis of their primary structures (<a href=\"#bib48\">Vignais and Billoud, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Constant et al., 2011</a>). The cytoplasmic F<sub>420</sub>-reducing [NiFe]-hydrogenase (Frh) belongs to the group 3 [NiFe]-hydrogenases, which catalyze the reversible reduction of the soluble hydride carrier, NAD(P) or F<sub>420</sub>. F<sub>420</sub> is a deazaflavin derivative that acts as an important hydride acceptor/donor in the central methanogenic pathway. The group 3 hydrogenases contain an additional subunit that interacts with the soluble coenzymes, for example, the iron\u2013sulfur flavoprotein FrhB. To date, the crystal structures of [NiFe]-hydrogenases only from group 1 have been determined: six derived from sulfate-reducing bacteria, including two orthologs harboring a [NiFeSe]-center as active site (<a href=\"#bib50\">Volbeda et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Higuchi et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Montet et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Garcin et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Matias et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Marques et al., 2010</a>), one from a photosynthetic bacterium (<a href=\"#bib36\">Ogata et al., 2010</a>), and three from hydrogen-oxidizing bacteria and <i>Escherichia coli</i>, which in contrast to the other species are oxygen-tolerant and have an usual [4Fe-3S] proximal cluster (<a href=\"#bib16\">Fritsch et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Shomura et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Volbeda et al., 2012</a>)."

The reduction of carbon dioxide to methane is an overall eight-electron reduction process involving the oxidation of four molecules of H<sub>2</sub> by several hydrogenases. Four electrons are provided through the reduced form of the coenzyme F<sub>420</sub>, which is regenerated by Frh. Frh is a heterotrimeric enzyme composed of the large subunit FrhA (45 kDa) with a binuclear [NiFe]-center, the small subunit FrhG (26 kDa) with three [4Fe4S] clusters and the iron\u2013sulfur flavoprotein FrhB (31 kDa) with a [4Fe4S] cluster and FAD, and the F<sub>420</sub>-binding site. Frh accounts for about 1% of the cytoplasmic protein and has been shown by electron microscopy to form a huge complex of similar appearance in all species investigated: <i>Methanococcus voltae</i> (<a href=\"#bib35\">Muth et al., 1987</a>), <i>Methanospirillum hungatei</i> (<a href=\"#bib44\">Sprott et al., 1987</a>), <i>Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum</i> \u0394H (<a href=\"#bib51\">Wackett et al., 1987</a>), and <i>Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum</i> Marburg (<a href=\"#bib3\">Braks et al., 1994</a>).

Its homogeneity was confirmed by electron microscopy with negative staining. We found that all projections of the Frh complex are ring-shaped with a diameter of \u223c16 nm (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Class averages showed twofold and threefold symmetry (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), which is consistent with tetrahedral symmetry. We conclude that the complexes consist of six dimers of FrhABG arranged into a shell around a hollow core, not in a cylindrical arrangement as in previous EM models (<a href=\"#bib51\">Wackett et al., 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Braks et al., 1994</a>). The dodecamer has a total MW of 1.2 MDa. Iterative structural refinement of a 84,000-particle cryo-EM dataset, applying tetrahedral symmetry, resulted in a 3D reconstruction (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>) at a resolution where the pitch of \u03b1-helices and many side chains are recognizable in the map, and \u03b2-strands are clearly separated (<a href=\"#fig2 fig5\">Figure 2E\u2013G, 5B</a>). The globular protein complex showed no preferred orientations in the ice, resulting in a homogeneous coverage of angles (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). The map shows six distinct dimers, all clearly separated from one another (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>), sitting on the faces of a cube. Each monomer contains a series of five high-density features separated by \u223c10 \u00c5, forming an arc in the interior of the protein (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a> and <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). These features are easily assigned to the four Fe-S clusters and the [NiFe] center; the latter is recognized by its smaller size. Although at first glance the position of the FrhABG heterotrimers in the dimer is not obvious, the path of the electron transfer chains provides definitive clues to the location of an FrhABG heterotrimer. FrhABG contains one approximately 35-\u00c5-long helix on the outer surface and a bundle of four up to 40-\u00c5-long helices at the interface of different dimers, running from the outside to the interior of the complex. Other helices are considerably shorter."

                        "text": "The large subunit FrhA has considerable homology to the known large subunit structures (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>), and is characterized by four long \u03b1-helices. Docking the large subunit of the group 1 enzyme into the map provides a good fit for the \u03b1-helix bundle, with the [NiFe] center correctly situated in its identified location and many other structural elements of FrhA matching closely, including two three-stranded antiparallel \u03b2-sheets. FrhA is about 15 kDa smaller than the large subunits of known structure; all missing elements are located on the periphery. A structural model for FrhA (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>) was created based on this fit and a sequence alignment with the protein from <i>Desulfovibrio vulgaris</i> Hildenborough (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). All but the first three amino acids in the sequence could be traced in our maps. Densities for large side chains confirm the structural assignment (<a href=\"#fig2 fig5\">Figures 2, 5</a> and <a href=\"#media2\">Video 2</a>). The [NiFe] center is located near four cysteine residues, Cys 63, 66, 380, and 383, which are fully conserved in all [NiFe]-hydrogenases. The group 1 [NiFe]-hydrogenases contain another ion, typically either Mg<sup>2+</sup> or Fe<sup>2+/3+</sup> (<a href=\"#bib22\">Higuchi et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Garcin et al., 1999</a>). In our map, there is strong density at this position (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>), which is part of the structurally conserved region of FrhA, and its surrounding residues, Glu44, Glu229, and His386, are fully conserved in FrhA (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>), so we interpret this density as an ion. One of the helices of the four-helix bundle has a pronounced kink. This helix was interpreted as residues 166\u2013193, and a proline residue (Pro180) not present in the group I proteins was found exactly at the position of the kink, supporting the assignment. No density is present beyond His386, and there is no room in the structure for the final 19 amino acids of the protein. The C-terminal residues after the equivalent histidine in [NiFe]-hydrogenases are enzymatically removed during maturation of the enzymes (<a href=\"#bib32\">Menon et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Theodoratou et al., 2005</a>). We can conclude that FrhA is posttranslationally modified in the same way, likely by FrhD, a homologous endopeptidase contained in the Frh operon FrhADGB (<a href=\"#bib24\">Liesegang et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Thauer et al., 2010</a>)."

Instead, the sequence indicates a ferredoxin domain, with two CxxCxxCxxxC sequences coordinating two [4Fe4S] clusters (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib1\">Alex et al., 1990</a>). Accordingly, we modeled the C-terminal domain of FrhG on ferredoxin (<a href=\"#fig4 fig5\">Figures 4B, 5A</a> and <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>). In our model, the residues 235\u2013244 form a \u03b2-hairpin with Gly240 at the turn. The two \u03b2-strands were predicted and the hairpin is clearly visible in the density, confirming the assignment. Unlike FrhA, which could be traced over its full length, density of FrhG for a 12-residue stretch (188\u2013199) is missing (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). This region is located at the surface and may be disordered. FrhG as deduced from the <i>M. marburgensis</i> genome sequence is 275 residues long (<a href=\"#bib24\">Liesegang et al., 2010</a>), but no density is present for the 45 N-terminal amino acids. The <i>frhG</i> gene most probably starts with the initiation codon GTG annotated as Val39 in the genome sequence (<a href=\"#bib15\">Fox et al., 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Alex et al., 1990</a>), which means that density is missing in the map for only the first seven amino acids of FrhG."

We conclude that FrhB has a novel fold (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a> and <a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a>). The Fe-S cluster is most probably a 4Fe-4S cluster because it is surrounded by four cysteines (Cys 104, 134, 192, and 195), which are all fully conserved (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). The core of FrhB is a mixed six-stranded \u03b2-sheet. A density located \u223c8 \u00c5 from the Fe-S cluster could be interpreted as the isoalloxazine ring of the FAD cofactor. The pyrophosphate moiety is located at the N-terminal end of an \u03b1-helix, which is a common FAD-binding motif where the dipole of the helix compensates the negative charge (<a href=\"#bib12\">Dym and Eisenberg, 2001</a>) (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>), and nearby density for the adenine moiety is visible. The FAD has a bent conformation, with the adenine and isoalloxazine ring only 4\u20135 \u00c5 apart (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>) near the highly conserved loop Lys75-Tyr76.

This density runs approximately parallel to the FAD isoalloxazine ring, at a distance of \u223c4 \u00c5. We conclude that it represents the isoalloxazine ring of the F<sub>420</sub> substrate. It is seated in a large pocket surrounded by highly conserved residues, with easy access to the surface of the complex. The F<sub>420</sub> density is close to the small residues S209 and V210 in a loop between two \u03b2-strands, which are part of the longest conserved region of FrhB (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). A predicted three-stranded \u03b2-sheet (148\u2013172) flanked by two short helices (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>) fits nicely in density. The only conserved region of this sheet, 163IGKGK, forms a turn close to the position of the isoalloxazine ring of F<sub>420</sub>. The location between this ring and the surface of the complex suggests that one or both of the conserved lysines may interact with the phosphate group of F<sub>420</sub>. The long \u03b1-helix on the surface that was interpreted as the C-terminal helix of FrhB is not very well resolved. The residues in the helix are mostly not conserved in FrhB, except at the N-terminal end (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). In our model, the conserved residues are located near the loop 164GKGK mentioned above. This region also contains several other conserved residues (<a href=\"#media5\">Video 5</a>) and likely constitutes the access channel for the substrate F<sub>420</sub>. The map of Frh in the presence of substrate is similar to the substrate-free map, indicating that F<sub>420</sub> binding does not involve major conformational changes."

                        "text": "Recent advances in instrumentation and image processing procedures have made cryo-electron microscopy of isolated macromolecular complexes a powerful technique in structural biology. After the first virus structure at subnanometer resolution (<a href=\"#bib2\">B\u00f6ttcher et al., 1997</a>) showed the feasibility of the method, icosahedral viruses were reconstructed in recent years to better than 4 \u00c5 resolution (<a href=\"#bib54\">Yu et al., 2008</a>, <a href=\"#bib53\">2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib58\">Zhang et al., 2008</a>, <a href=\"#bib55\">2010a</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Liu et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Wolf et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Chen et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Settembre et al., 2011</a>; ), taking advantage of the 60-fold symmetry and huge size (\u223c20 to 150 MDa), which together contribute to the relatively high signal-to-noise ratio for these particles that makes the determination of the orientation unambiguous. For smaller complexes, the techniques have been pioneered with the 800-kDa GroEL complex with D7 symmetry, reaching subnanometer resolution for the first time in 2004 (<a href=\"#bib28\">Ludtke et al., 2004</a>) and \u223c4 \u00c5 in 2008 (<a href=\"#bib26\">Ludtke et al., 2008</a>). Subsequent reconstructions to this resolution were achieved for archaeal (<a href=\"#bib56\">Zhang et al., 2010b</a>) and mammalian (<a href=\"#bib8\">Cong et al., 2010</a>) chaperonins. The chaperonins have different conformational states, and usually only one of these gave a high-resolution map, whereas for the others the resolution was limited due to conformational flexibility. The appearance of our reconstructions is similar to the chaperonins; in agreement with this, Fourier shell correlation indicates a resolution of 3.9 and 4.0 \u00c5 for the two maps, respectively (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10A</a>). Recently it has been noted that the resolution of such reconstructions are usually overestimated due to correlation of noise at high resolution (<a href=\"#bib39\">Scheres and Chen, 2012</a>). Using a \u2018gold standard' procedure to estimate resolution, where two half-data sets are independently refined to a reference not containing high-resolution information (see \u2018Materials and methods'), yielded 5.5 \u00c5 (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10B</a>). However, an objective indication of (local) resolution is provided by the appearance of secondary structure: the \u03b1-helical pitch of 5.4 \u00c5 is very well defined in many regions (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2F,G</a>), as is the separation of \u03b2-strands (axial distance \u223c4.8 \u00c5) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Comparison of these areas with maps calculated from the model low-pass filtered to different resolutions suggest a resolution \u223c4.5 \u00c5. The overall resolution estimate is an average of these well-resolved protein regions and other regions that are less well resolved, especially those at the periphery of the complex. An FSC curve between the experimental map and a map calculated from the model indicated a resolution of 5.8 \u00c5 (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10C</a>); this figure also constitutes an average over the whole structure, with the model probably best for internal \u03b1-helices and worst for loops at the periphery. Since the model was derived from the map, and not from an independent experiment, this measure does not properly reflect the resolution of the map, but rather describes how well our admittedly incomplete model explains the map densities. It should be noted that we used tight protein structure restraints during modeling, in order to prevent overfitting to noise while creating an unrealistic model that would have yielded a higher model-to-map correlation."

The tetrahedral symmetry means that there are 12 asymmetric units in each particle, less than the 14 and 16 in the D7 and D8 symmetric chaperonins, but the resulting ball-like shape ensures that the complex has no preferential orientation in the ice (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>), unlike the cylinder-shaped chaperonins that tend to be oriented with their symmetry axis parallel or perpendicular to the ice (<a href=\"#bib29\">Ludtke et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Zhang et al., 2011</a>). From the quality of the reconstructions, we conclude that the complex is very rigid. The maps of Frh with and without substrate are of similar resolution and quality, implying that any protein conformational changes due to F<sub>420</sub> binding are too small to detect at the present resolution. The density for F<sub>420</sub> is weak, but its position was inferred at an early stage of the analysis from the fact that maps of Frh without the substrate were consistently empty and maps with F<sub>420</sub> always showed some density here. The later tracing of the amino acid chain of FrhB and the FAD confirmed the assignment: F<sub>420</sub> is in van der Waals distance from its hydride donor, the FAD isoalloxazine ring, and the residues in the vicinity are highly conserved in FrhB and in the FrhB family of F<sub>420</sub>-binding proteins (<a href=\"#fig7 fig9\">Figures 7, 9</a> and <a href=\"#media5\">Video 5</a>)."

The visibility of the FeS cluster density (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a> and <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>) made it possible to use the four Fe-S ligand cysteines together with a secondary structure prediction as an initial guide; large side chain densities helped to establish the correct sequence assignment. The secondary structure prediction was fully confirmed, and weak or discontinuous densities in the map were almost invariably found to represent glycine residues, further indicating a correct assignment. Density for the FAD cofactor only became clear when most of the protein chain was placed; density for the ribose and ribitol are missing (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). The pyrophosphate group is closely associated with the N-terminal \u03b1-helix 26\u201364 of FrhB. The N-terminus of this helix is one of the most conserved regions in the FrhB family (<a href=\"#fig7 fig9\">Figures 7, 9</a>), and its role in compensating the negative charge of the phosphates is a common motif in FAD-binding proteins (<a href=\"#bib12\">Dym and Eisenberg, 2001</a>). Conserved regions of FrhB were found near the FAD and surrounding the F<sub>420</sub>-binding site and its putative entrance channel (<a href=\"#media5\">Video 5</a>). Of the three proteins, only FrhG is missing density for an internal stretch, residues 188\u2013199 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). The flanking residues of this stretch are located less than 10 \u00c5 apart on the surface of the complex and they probably form a flexible loop. FrhA and FrhB were traced over their full length. All three proteins follow the rule that hydrophobic residues form the core of the protein and charged residues face the outside. We found several pockets lined with hydrophobic side chains, not just in FrhA and FrhG, where these features are shared with the bacterial protein used as a template for modeling, but also in FrhB. FrhB also contains a highly hydrophobic helix (27GIVTGLLAYAL), which is buried completely inside the subunit. These features all indicate a correct chain trace."

The cofactors describe a curvilinear path in the protein interior, almost parallel to the surface of the complex, with distances of \u223c10 \u00c5 between neighbors, except FAD and F<sub>420</sub>, which are in van der Waals contact to enable hydride transfer (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>). The predicted F<sub>420</sub>-binding site is located on the outside of the complex, which facilitates access of the cytosolic F<sub>420</sub>. The two electron transfer chains in a dimer are separated by at least 17 \u00c5 and are thus independent of each other, indicating that the functional unit is one FrhABG heterotrimer and there is no cooperativity in the complex. The three proteins in the Frh heterotrimer form a tight complex with extensive subunit interfaces and a large number of subunit interactions, including two salt bridges between loops of the two FrhA molecules in a dimer, from Asp312 of one FrhA and Arg314 of the other (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). The heterotrimer is quite slender compared to the two-subunit [NiFe] hydrogenases of known structure, with a small contact surface especially between FrhB and the other two subunits (<a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12</a>), and complex formation may be necessary for stability of the complex and keeping the metal clusters at optimal distances. The same quaternary structure of Frh has been observed not only in the closely related thermophile <i>M. thermautotrophicus</i> (<a href=\"#bib51\">Wackett et al., 1987</a>) but also in the phylogenetically distant mesophilic <i>M. voltae</i> (<a href=\"#bib35\">Muth et al., 1987</a>) and <i>M. hungatei</i> (<a href=\"#bib44\">Sprott et al., 1987</a>), so it is clear that the formation of a large complex plays an essential role for the function of Frh."

Particle selection was done semiautomatically with the Boxer module from EMAN (<a href=\"#bib27\">Ludtke et al., 1999</a>) and data processing with EMAN2 (<a href=\"#bib45\">Tang et al., 2007</a>). The contrast transfer function (CTF) of the selected particles from each film was determined with EMAN2 and images that showed visible Thon rings in the power spectrum to high resolution and no indication of drift or astigmatism were selected for further processing and their CTF was corrected by phase flipping. A tetrahedral starting model was created by the EMAN2 program <i>e2initialmodel</i> from a number of class averages. This model was iteratively refined using the main EMAN2 program <i>e2refine,</i> which determines the 3D orientation of each particle by comparison to a set of projections of the current 3D reference map. Particles in the same orientation are aligned and averaged, and a new 3D map is constructed from the averages that are then reprojected to create references for the next refinement cycle (<a href=\"#bib27\">Ludtke et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Tang et al., 2007</a>). Tetrahedral (<i>T</i>) symmetry was applied throughout. In the initial refinement steps, the data were binned to a pixel size of 2.28 \u00c5. After the resolution reached \u223c10 \u00c5, the unbinned data were used. At every refinement step, the 30% worst members of each class were discarded. Because of the high symmetry and globular shape of the particle, all class averages had similar quality (see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>) and were used for each reconstruction. The final data set of substrate-free Frh contained 84,000 particles from 101 negatives of the 402 scanned negatives. Between iterations, the projection angle was varied. In the last refinement step an angle of 0.9\u00b0 between consecutive reference reprojections was used, yielding 2134 reference images."

The resolution estimate can be inflated by the overfitting of noise at high resolution (<a href=\"#bib20\">Grigorieff, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Scheres and Chen, 2012</a>). To test for this effect, we used the procedure <i>e2refine-evenodd</i> in EMAN2, where the phase of the starting model are randomized from a cutoff resolution lower than the expected resolution of the map, and then two half-data sets are refined to convergence against this model. High-resolution noise will be uncorrelated between the two maps. Subsequently, the FSC between the two resulting maps is calculated, and the resolution from these two independent half-data sets determined at 0.143 FSC (<a href=\"#bib38\">Rosenthal and Henderson, 2003</a>). This procedure yielded a resolution of 5.5 \u00c5 (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10B</a>).

Models were then mutated to the correct amino acid and manually rebuilt in Coot (<a href=\"#bib13\">Emsley and Cowtan, 2004</a>). Regions for which no homolog was available, including all of FrhB, was built ab initio in Coot, based on secondary structure predictions done using the PSIPRED server (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bryson et al., 2005</a>). The conserved cysteines serving as ligands for the Fe-S clusters and the visibility of the Fe-S clusters in the map gave clear initial hints to the identity of secondary structure elements. Helices were built using the command <i>Place helix</i>. Loops and \u03b2-sheets were built by first placing C<sub>\u03b1</sub> atoms using the <i>Baton build</i> module. Full-atom models were built based on the visibility of side chains, which led in all cases to an unambiguous assignment. The models were refined using the <i>Regularize Zone</i> module. Where possible, side chains were fitted to available density (overall about 55% of side chains were visible, including most aromatic residues and arginines). During refinement, torsion angle, planar peptide, and Ramachandran restraints were used in order not to create a well-fitting but unrealistic model. The final model contains 878 residues out of a possible 903, a [NiFe] cluster, 4 [4Fe4S] clusters, an FAD and part of an F<sub>420</sub> molecule; 88.1% of residues lie in the most favored regions of a Ramachandran plot, 8.0% in generously allowed regions, and 3.8% are outliers.

Two of the trimer subunits have counterparts on the class I hydrogenases, but one subunit, which is unique to the group 3 enzymes, is a novel iron-sulfur flavoprotein. The new mechanistic insights derived from the structure are limited, but the system is important and the technical achievements are impressive.

Since the authors have a density map (or maps) and an atomic model (with C-alphas deposited in PDB) that purports to explain the density, we ask them to present an objective, quantitative comparison (cross-correlation) between the map and the model, to back their presentation of a few local regions of the structure (e.g. Figures 2G, 5C, 5D, 8A, 8B). This should be a Fourier Shell Correlation as a function of resolution, and the authors should be careful not to introduce too many degrees of freedom in the fitting of the model into the map. If their resolution claim of 3.89 \u00c5 is correct, then this FSC between map and model should extend to a higher resolution than the FSC between the two halves of the experimental data shown in Figure 1D. It is now well known that many single particle procedures are susceptible to overfitting of noise, which gives rise to inflated resolution claims. The map/model FSC gives an objective and quantitative evaluation of the success of the entire procedure and does not easily provide misleading indications."

Afterward the FSC between the two resulting maps is calculated. As there are features in our map indicating better than 5-\u00c5 resolution (separation of \u03b2-strands) we chose a cut-off resolution of 6 \u00c5; the FSC between the resulting half-data maps reached 5.5 \u00c5 at 0.143 FSC."

The map-model FSC was determined as 5.8 \u00c5 at 0.5 FSC, with positive correlation to \u223c4 \u00c5. Since this concerns a model derived from our EM map and not an independently determined x-ray model, as was the case in the Zhang and Scheres & Chen papers, this number is not a reliable measure of the quality of the map or the \u201ccorrectness\u201d of the model. The majority of the helices show groves with 5.4 \u00c5 spacing, and \u03b2-strands are clearly resolved in the best parts of the map (see Figure 5) showing that the local resolution in these map regions is evidently better than 4.8 \u00c5. The overall resolution estimate is therefore an average of these well-resolved protein regions and other regions that are less well resolved, especially those at the periphery of the complex. We expect that a resolution test in which only the best map regions are considered would indicate significantly better resolution. However, this would only serve to provide a better number, without improving the map or aiding its interpretation. The correctness of our trace can only be judged by a detailed analysis of the model, as described below."
