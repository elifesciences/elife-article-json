The six domains in the extracellular region of the first half-receptor (orange) are L1, CR, L2, Fn1, Fn2 and Fn3; the domains in the second half-receptor (green) are the same and labeled with an asterisk. The domains outlined in black are in the so-called \u03b1 chain, and the domains outlined in blue are in the \u03b2 chain of each half-receptor; the Fn2 domain consists of both chains. The intracellular region comprises the juxtamembrane region (JM) and the tyrosine kinase domain (KIN). Sites of <i>trans</i>-phosphorylation are shown as circles. (<b>A</b>) When IGF1 is not bound to the receptor, an interaction between L1* of the second half-receptor and Fn2 and Fn3 of the first half-receptor (and vice versa) is thought to maintain a large separation between the transmembrane (TM) helices (dotted arrow). (<b>B</b>) When IGF1 binds to L1* (or to L1), it disrupts the L1*-Fn2 (or L1-Fn2*) interaction. This allows Fn2 and Fn3 of each half-receptor to pivot (grey arrows) towards each other (the previous positions of Fn2 and Fn3 are shown semi-transparently). This in turn facilitates the dimerization of the TM helices in the membrane, which juxtaposes the kinase domains for efficient <i>trans</i>-phosphorylation (black arrows). Binding of a single IGF1 molecule (shown as binding to the left side) is sufficient to activate the receptor, but exactly how this asymmetry affects the conformational changes in the receptor is unclear."

Kavran et al. demonstrated that the two kinase domains in the IGF1 receptor are activated by phosphorylating one another, extending the results of previous studies on the kinase domains alone (<a href=\"#bib2\">Favelyukis et al., 2001</a>). Thus, these domains must be brought into close proximity when insulin or IGF1 binds. How does IGF1 stimulate this <i>trans</i>-phosphorylation? Is the IGF1 receptor constrained in some way that prevents the two kinase domains from associating with each other before IGF1 binds to the receptor? Or does binding of IGF1 stabilize the positioning of the two kinase domains side-by-side? Kavran et al. now provide evidence that IGF1 stimulates <i>trans</i>-phosphorylation by relieving a constraint within the extracellular region that holds the receptor in an inactive state (<a href=\"#bib3\">Kavran et al., 2014</a>)."

However, these two structures suggested to Kavran et al. that a hinge movement between the so-called \u2018cysteine-rich domain\u2019 (CR in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>) and the second \u2018L domain\u2019 (L2) might be involved. Based on this observation, Kavran et al. hypothesized that an interaction between the first L domain of one half-receptor and the second \u2018fibronectin domain\u2019 of the other half-receptor (L1* and Fn2 in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) was needed to maintain the large separation between the transmembrane helices. They then proposed that IGF1 binding to L1* (its known primary binding site), disrupts the L1*-Fn2 interaction, which allows the transmembrane helices to approach one another (see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>)."

However, deleting the entire L1 domain did the trick, and revealed that this truncated IGF1 receptor was always switched on\u2014even when IGF1 was absent. This supports the idea that the L1*-Fn2 interaction inhibits the receptor's activity. Also consistent with this hypothesis, when Kavran et al. included flexible linkers between the Fn3 domain and the transmembrane helix, there was greater phosphorylation of the intracellular kinase domains in the absence of IGF1."

These data supported the notion that the transmembrane helixes get closer when IGF1 binds. But how close together do they get? Further biochemical studies and computer simulations showed that the transmembrane helices probably dimerize, or physically interact, which would help position the kinase domains next to one another for <i>trans</i>-phosphorylation."

Another recent study has proposed that, when the hormone binds, the insulin receptor is activated by the transmembrane helices moving away from each other (<a href=\"#bib4\">Lee et al., 2014</a>). This is essentially the opposite mechanism to that proposed by Kavran et al. Further work is needed to resolve these conflicting models of activation."

In particular, how do IGF1 and insulin bind to their secondary, \u2018crosslinking\u2019 sites on the receptors (Fn1 and Fn2 in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), and how are the kinase domains arranged in the inactivated and activated states? Though the transmembrane helices may be far apart in the inactive insulin receptor (or IGF1 receptor), the juxtamembrane region (JM in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) is rather long. Therefore, if this region were not constrained, the two kinase domains should be capable of reaching one another (for <i>trans</i>-phosphorylation). The nature of this steric constraint is unknown. Finally, Kavran et al. observed that the presence of the juxtamembrane region increased kinase activity fourfold relative to the kinase domains alone. Thus, the juxtamembrane regions of the IGF1 receptor and insulin receptor hold mechanistic secrets yet to be revealed."
