Meiotic drivers were originally defined as genes that could directly cheat when chromosomes are being segregated into the gametes (a process called meiosis).

Now, in <i>eLife</i>, Harmit Malik and colleagues at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center\u2014including Sarah Zanders as first author\u2014report that three meiotic drivers keep two yeast species reproductively isolated (<a href=\"#bib6\">Zanders et al., 2014</a>)."

Even meiotic drivers that cause a drop in fitness (in terms of survival or the number of offspring produced) can thus spread in populations. By eluding fitness-based selection, chromosomes carrying meiotic drivers can accumulate harmful mutations or structural rearrangements and this \u2018baggage\u2019 can be dragged along with the driver to higher frequency (<a href=\"#bib1\">Burt and Trivers, 2006</a>). The negative effects of meiotic drivers select for other genes that suppress these effects, and this can initiate a molecular arms race between drivers and suppressors that is predicted to cause rapid evolutionary divergence of these genes. Because they can both rapidly diverge and compromise fertility, it has been suggested that meiotic drivers could cause related populations of organisms to become reproductively isolated (<a href=\"#bib3\">Hurst and Werren, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">McDermott and Noor, 2010</a>)\u2014something that might drive the generation of new species."

Both of these rearrangements did affect fertility, but these differences were not sufficient to account for the extremely low spore production of hybrids of these two yeast species. After ruling out several alternatives, Zanders et al. discovered something remarkable: each chromosome in <i>S. kambucha</i> contains a spore killer gene. Spore killers are a type of gamete killer, and each encodes what is essentially a molecular poison. The spores that harbour a particular killer gene are immune to the respective poison, but the details of this immunity remain largely mysterious (though see <a href=\"#bib2\">Hammond et al., 2012</a>). As such, a spore from the <i>S. pombe/S. kambucha</i> hybrid must receive all three killer genes by random segregation to be fully sheltered from all three poisons (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>)."

Furthermore, only hybrid spores that inherit versions of these two chromosomes from the same yeast species (either both from <i>S. pombe</i> or both from <i>S. kambucha</i>) are viable. This is because two essential genes have been swapped between chromosomes 2 and 3 in one of the parent species, and thus a spore must inherit these two chromosomes together, or die because it ends up lacking one or the other of these genes."

Whether this is caused by a different version of the same gene, or by a distinct driver that arose independently on <i>S. pombe</i> chromosome 3, will be a very interesting follow-up question."

The finding that multiple independent meiotic drivers can differ between even closely related species, can change the structure of genomes, and can also act together to cause a very strong fertility barrier, is an important insight. This study highlights that meiotic drivers need not be rare, and that they can both directly and indirectly affect multiple chromosomes. The identification of the underlying genes, and any suppressors that may exist, will not only allow us to understand the molecular mechanisms of spore killing, but may also clarify how meiotic drivers can arise repeatedly. This study reminds us that much remains to be learned about the dynamics of drivers and possible piggy-back effects on genome architecture, speciation, and extinction."
