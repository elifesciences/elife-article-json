Here we utilize single-molecule observations of RNA in fixed and living cells to develop a single-cell model of steroid-receptor mediated gene activation. We determine that steroids drive mRNA synthesis by frequency modulation of transcription. This digital behavior in single cells gives rise to the well-known analog dose response across the population. To test this model, we developed a light-activation technology to turn on a single steroid-responsive gene and follow dynamic synthesis of RNA from the activated locus."

Here we utilize single-molecule observations of RNA in fixed and living cells to develop a single-cell model of steroid-receptor mediated gene activation. We determine that steroids drive mRNA synthesis by frequency modulation of transcription. This digital behavior in single cells gives rise to the well-known analog dose response across the population. To test this model, we developed a light-activation technology to turn on a single steroid-responsive gene and follow dynamic synthesis of RNA from the activated locus."

Depending on the particular steroid receptor, a partial list of events required to activate the target gene includes ligand-binding, receptor dimerization, nuclear translocation, eviction of co-repressors (i.e., histone deacetylases), recruitment of chromatin modifying enzymes (histone acetyltransferases, ATP-dependent remodeling enzymes, methyltransferases), and eventually recruitment of the basal transcription machinery. Despite this complexity, the dose-response is deceptively simple: it often takes the form of a simple Hill function with a coefficient of unity, which has traditionally been interpreted to imply that ligand-binding is the only rate-limiting step in the activation pathway (<a href=\"#bib43\">Ong et al., 2010</a>). This description models the dose response as a continuum where each cell transcribes RNA at rates proportional to the dosage level."

First, gene expression is not uniform over a population for a given dose, but shows variation from cell to cell, an observation which was first made for a steroid-responsive MMTV reporter gene (<a href=\"#bib27\">Ko et al., 1990</a>). The authors demonstrated that the observed analog dose response was in fact a digital dose response (on or off) when viewed in single cells. Likewise, previous studies initially demonstrated that enhancers increase the <i>probability</i> of activation of a cell but not the strength of activation in the cell (<a href=\"#bib38\">Moreau et al., 1981</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Weintraub, 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Moon and Ley, 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Walters et al., 1995</a>). Second, expression is only a snapshot of temporally evolving gene activity (<a href=\"#bib49\">Ross et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">White et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Harper et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Suter et al., 2011</a>). Thus, a cell is counted as activated or not activated dependent on the moment it is observed. Thus far, all single-cell measurements on metazoans suggest that genes are transcribed in \u2018bursts\u2019 of transcription, meaning that short periods of RNA synthesis are interspersed by long periods of inactivity. The causes of transcriptional bursting are unknown. Third, since molecules involved in regulating transcription are usually present at low copy number, this leads to stochastic fluctuations (\u2018noise\u2019) and hence gene expression variation across the population (<a href=\"#bib28\">Larson et al., 2009</a>). Finally, dynamic interactions between upstream regulators and chromatin add another level of complexity to the molecular events occurring during transcriptional activation (<a href=\"#bib33\">McNally et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Darzacq et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Ong et al., 2010</a>). Under such conditions, the observed dose response does not result solely from ligand-binding but rather the composite result derived from many coupled reactions. In summary, population models of gene activation are too coarse to explain activation in single cells. Moreover, tools do not exist whereby the activity of single genes in single cells can be directly manipulated and measured."

In contrast to the ensemble approach derived from observations of cell populations, we have developed a single-molecule kinetic approach for interrogation of a single gene. This approach is based on photoactivation of a steroid receptor ligand followed by observation of pre-mRNA synthesis at an active locus. The system consists of an exogenous reporter gene under control of the ecdysone receptor which is activated by the agonist ponasterone A (<a href=\"#bib42\">No et al., 1996</a>). The real-time behavior of the gene is visualized using a bacteriophage capsid protein which binds MS2 RNA stem loops with high affinity to label nascent pre-mRNA in living cells (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bertrand et al., 1998</a>). We demonstrate experimentally how the ensemble steroid dose response arises from the stochastic behavior of individual genes. These results suggest that the response element controls the <i>frequency</i> of gene activity but affects neither the <i>duration</i> of the active period nor the actual <i>rate</i> of transcripts produced during an active period. By using a caged ligand that could be uncaged by a light pulse (<a href=\"#bib67\">Lee et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Lin et al., 2002</a>) we measured the impulse-response of the gene and determined that a single pulse of active ligand resulted in a corresponding burst of polymerase activity several hours later. Further, this photoactivatable ligand has the property of being an <i>antagonist</i> in the caged state and an <i>agonist</i> in the uncaged state, enabling a precise window for kinetic perturbation in single cells. Thus, we were able to propose and validate a stochastic model of steroid-receptor activity for a reporter gene which provides a new framework for studying this ubiquitous mechanism of eukaryotic gene regulation."

Furthermore, we desired a gene that would be unresponsive to endogenous steroid receptor (SR) ligands but also recapitulate the basic mechanism of SR transcriptional regulation. For these reasons, we chose to reconstitute ecdysone receptor-mediated transcription in human U2-OS cells (<a href=\"#bib42\">No et al., 1996</a>). We first introduced a chimeric ecdysone receptor into the cells and subcloned a cell line which showed a strong response of a luciferase reporter. We next introduced an ecdysone-responsive reporter gene. The gene consists of a multimerized E/GRE response element (hybrid ecdysone/glucorticoid response element) in front of an Sp1 activator and a minimal heat shock promoter (mHSP, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib42\">No et al., 1996</a>). The coding region is bi-cistronic with the upstream region coding for CFP with a C-terminal SKL amino acid peroxisome-targeting motif (<a href=\"#bib24\">Janicki et al., 2004</a>), and the downstream region coding for DsRED expressed in the cytosol from an IRES. Located in the 3\u2032 UTR of the upstream cistron are 24 MS2 stem loops. The entire construct is 7.1 kb in length and is stably infected into the target U2-OS cells using lentiviral vectors (<a href=\"#bib39\">Mostoslavsky et al., 2006</a>). Infections were carried out at MOI = 0.1 to obtain cells enriched for single integrations, and multiple clones were isolated and expanded for further analysis. The MS2 RNA stem loops are bound by the high affinity bacteriophage MS2 capsid protein dimer, where each monomer is labeled with YFP (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bertrand et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Chao et al., 2008</a>). Since the MS2-YFP is constitutively expressed and localized to the nucleus with an NLS, as soon as the RNA stem-loops are transcribed at an active locus, the MS2-YFP protein binds, thus making the transcription site (TS) visible in the microscope (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, white arrow). The mature mRNAs carry the bound fluorescent proteins into the cytoplasm and are visible in the microscope as punctuate diffraction-limited fluorescent spots (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, green, inset) (<a href=\"#bib51\">Shav-Tal et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Mor et al., 2010</a>). The translated protein is targeted to peroxisomes which are likewise visible as punctuate diffraction-limited fluorescent spots consisting of many copies of the CFP-SKL (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, blue). Therefore, the reporter gene provides a live cell fluorescence readout that reflects both the history of the gene (total amount of mRNA and protein) and the current state of the gene (presence of the active transcription site)."

                                "text": "First, we directly observed RNA synthesis at an active locus in a clonal cell line using single-molecule live-cell microscopy. Consistent with previous studies which directly observe transcriptional activity of single genes in eukaryotes we observed transcriptional bursting (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chubb et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Stevense et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Yunger et al., 2010</a>). We then measured the bursting dynamics in the microscope for three different concentrations of the steroid Ponasterone A (PA) (3.125 \u03bcM, 12.5 \u03bcM, 50 \u03bcM, control: 0.0 \u03bcM), which is the high affinity ligand for the chimeric ecdysone receptor. An example time series is shown for 50 \u03bcM PA (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A\u2013F</a>, <a href=\"#media1\">Videos 1\u20135</a>). The first transcription sites were visible several hours after induction (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). At steady state (24 hr after induction) for each dose, single gene transcription sites were captured at 15 min intervals for \u223c 15 hr, resulting in representative transcription intensity traces shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E,F</a> (red, green lines, <a href=\"#media4\">Video 4</a>). As is evident from the images and the intensity analysis, individual cells show punctuated periods of transcriptional activity. The intensity traces were fit using a two-state hidden Markov model (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E,F</a>, black lines, 50 \u03bcM; <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>, 12.5 \u03bcM, 3.125 \u03bcM) (<a href=\"#bib30\">Lee, 2009</a>), allowing the distribution of on-times and off times to be determined (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G,H</a>). We observed that the duration of inactivity (off-time) decreased in a dose-dependent manner (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2I</a>, gray bars). However, the duration of transcription activity (the on-time) did not significantly change over the dose response curve (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2I</a>, black bars). Moreover, the average peak brightness did also not change significantly with [PA] (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2J</a>). In the case of treatment with a vehicle ([PonA] = 0.0 \u03bcM), occasional spurious spots are detected by the tracking algorithm (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2I</a>, 0.0 \u03bcM, black bar), and the off-time is statistically indistinguishable from the duration of the entire time-lapse video (<a href=\"#fig2\">Fig. 2I</a>, 0.0 \u03bcM, gray bar, compared to red-dashed line). Since the brightness of the nascent RNA signal reflects the number of individual RNA at the site of transcription (<a href=\"#bib66\">Zenklusen et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Larson et al., 2011</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>), these data indicate the average number of polymerases which fire during an active period is insensitive to [PA]. This live-cell analysis was also repeated for an additional clone with equivalent results (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a> and below). In summary, direct measurements of transcription activity suggest that changing steroid levels affects the frequency of active periods but neither the duration of the active period nor the number of polymerases fired during the active period. Even for this highly-induced artificial reporter gene, the gene is active approximately 50% of the time at saturation (average on time = 38 \u00b1 6 min; average off time = 35 \u00b1 4 min) and shows a total gene cycling time of approximately 80 min."

We used the \u2018Random Telegraph model\u2019, which is a paradigm for stochastic transcription and quantitatively describes the distribution of RNA/cell in a variety of organisms (<a href=\"#bib44\">Peccoud and Ycart, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Larson et al., 2009</a>). The key feature of this model is the hypothesis that the gene toggles between an active state where transcripts can be synthesized and an inactive state where no transcripts are produced. It is important to note that the gene can be \u2018active\u2019 even when no nascent RNA is detected, owing partly to the stochastic initiation events within an active state (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>) and partly to the placement of the MS2 cassette in the middle of the gene (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). The biochemical determinant(s) of this active state is unknown and is likely to vary between genes. Consequently, it is not possible at present to do a direct measurement of the active state. However, the distribution of <i>total</i> cellular reporter mRNA reflects the dynamics of this active-inactive switching, so we measured the steady state distribution of total cellular reporter mRNA over a population using single-molecule FISH in fixed cells."

Transcription sites are infrequent. At medium induction levels (12.5 \u03bcM, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>), most cells contain mRNA, and many are actively transcribing. At high levels of induction (50 \u03bcM, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F</a>), cells contain a high abundance of mRNA in the cytosol, and most cells show an active transcription site in the nucleus.

This correspondence indicates that non-cooperative behavior for the hormone response (<i>h = 1,</i> <a href=\"#equ1\">Equation 1</a>) is mathematically equivalent to frequency modulation. In other words, the rate of switching to the active state (<i>a</i>) is the only variable which changes with ligand concentration. In <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4G\u2013L</a> we show the distribution of mRNA/cell compared to the theoretical fit arising from the telegraph model as a function of dose. Indeed, these data are consistent with a model where the only variable which varies with dose is the rate of activation (<i>a</i>), while the other parameters (<i>b,c</i>) are globally fit for the entire dose response for a particular cell line (<i>b/d</i> = 1.5, <i>c/d</i> =340). When the same analysis is carried out on cell lines with different insertion sites (i.e., <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), the dose-dependent activation rate (<i>a</i>) and the dose-independent inactivation rate (<i>b</i>) remain invariant, but the initiation rate (<i>c</i>) changes with the cell line. Thus, the absolute number of polymerases loaded during an active period does not depend on steroid level but rather some extrinsic factor such as local chromatin environment or abundance of some component of the core transcriptional machinery. This is evident when comparing the episomal genes, which do not show frequency modulation. In summary, both fixed-cell and live-cell single-molecule measurements are consistent with a model where the steroid is a robust frequency modulator."

We therefore examined the dose-dependent induction properties of the reporter gene in the presence and absence of the caged reagent by performing an in vivo competition experiment. First, we confirmed that both forms of the caged PA were inactive by measuring a dose response of the caged ligands (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Second, the cells were incubated with two different forms of the caged PA (DMNB-PonA and CNB-PonA) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). After overnight incubation, the cells were exposed to 25 \u03bcM of the active, unmodified PA for 30 min. The cells were then washed and returned to the incubator for 8 hr to allow the buildup of protein (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). At 100 \u03bcM of DMNB-PA, we observed a fivefold reduction in protein levels, indicating that the caged ligand blocks the activity of the active, uncaged form in vivo (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>, gray, <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). When the DMNB-PonA and uncaged PA are present in equimolar amounts, the competition is alleviated, and the protein output from the reporter gene is close to the levels observed in the absence of the caged ligand. Thus, we show that this ligand has the unique property of being an <i>agonist</i> in the uncaged state and an <i>antagonist</i> in the caged state."

Such a feature is especially important for a reagent that is membrane-permeable and might diffuse to neighboring cells in the tissue. Thus, the caged compound has built-in protection against \u2018leakiness\u2019 and is capable of acting in a highly localized spatial manner when uncaged. The method of activation, therefore, has to be all or none: the balance between agonist/antagonist must be shifted past a threshold in order for gene activation to occur. A typical experimental design is schematized in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>. The nucleus is activated with a UV laser at 349 nm. The above-threshold dose of uncaging light (40 pulses, 100 Hz, 2 J/cm<sup>2</sup> total dose at the sample) is delivered in approximately 400 ms over the area of the nucleus (\u223c80 \u03bcm<sup>2</sup>). Now, all the receptors in the nucleus are active, leading to the initiation of transcription at the single locus. Concurrently, any activating ligand that diffuses away encounters neighboring cells that are in the repressed state due to the presence of the antagonist. Once the activation occurs in the target cell, the diffusion into the cell of unactivated antagonist coupled with the rapid turnover of receptor-bound agonist (<a href=\"#bib55\">Stavreva et al., 2004</a>) results in antagonist-bound receptors that bind to the response element and repress transcription."

By contrast, the two non-photolyzed neighboring cells show no evidence of CFP expression.

By a variety of approaches, we show that the frequency of initiation is the variable that determines RNA levels, but only when the gene is integrated into the chromatin. By measuring the synthesis of pre-mRNA directly, we connected the dynamics of the gene with the availability of an upstream transcription factor, the ligand-bound steroid receptor. We demonstrated how steroid receptors, which are present in all metazoans, can control transcription through frequency modulation. This digital frequency modulation of transcription in single cells manifests as an analog dose response in cellular mRNA and protein in a population. Importantly, the ability to activate the transcription factor (steroid receptor) using light provided a precise temporal start to measure the time needed for the gene to respond, an unexpectedly long time (2 hr). Hence our observations clarify the mechanics behind these observations and extend the understanding to the intrinsic cycling on and off for a gene. One dose of a transcription factor yields one cycle of transcription."

A stochastic model of kinetic rates allowed us to break down the steroid transcriptional response into distinct processes, which could be measured independently in the microscope. Although a number of studies have inferred transcriptional bursting by measuring events which are downstream of transcription, such as cellular RNA or protein production, (<a href=\"#bib7\">Blake et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Raser and O\u2019Shea, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Becskei et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Bar-Even et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Newman et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Raj et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Zenklusen et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Singh et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Batenchuk et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Skupsky et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">So et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Suter et al., 2011</a>), we are able to unambiguously resolve the properties of individual bursts and relate these measured kinetic steps to steroid abundance. For this ecdysteroid-responsive reporter gene in mammalian cells, the time between on-states decreased at higher doses of PA. The duration of the active state and the transcription rate from the active state were invariant. However, the \u2018on\u2019 times and \u2018off\u2019 times were both exponentially distributed (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G,H</a>), which suggested that both processes were determined by a single rate-limiting step. The simplest biochemical model to explain this result is that the state of the gene is determined entirely by the on rate and off rate of the active ligand-receptor complex from the response element. The corollary to this model is that the actual transcription rate (<i>c</i>) from the active state is determined by factors other than the response element. For example the ability of <i>trans</i>-acting factors to access <i>cis</i>-acting sequences in the core promoter may determine the firing rate from the active state. In agreement with this supposition, the dynamic frequency modulation by the steroid was invariant with the insertion site, but the transcription rate varied over fivefold with insertion site. In this way, genetic regulation can be conceptualized as the superposition of individual parts, with distal enhancers and response elements controlling frequency of activation and proximal promoters determining the firing rate. Future experiments will be able to directly test this hypothesis using further development of the single-molecule approaches described here."

                        "text": "This simple model must address the fact that the exchange rate of SRs on chromatin has been observed to be extremely dynamic. Fluorescence photobleaching recovery measurements on tandem gene arrays in single cells record dwell times on the order of seconds to minutes (<a href=\"#bib13\">Darzacq et al., 2009</a>), while the duration of the active transcriptional state in this study is on the order of an hour. One possibility is that SR binding is actually much longer, and FRAP data on arrays is dominated by non-specific interactions and is not capable of detecting the small percentage of receptors which might be stably bound. Another possibility is that SR binding is in fact short-lived but initiates a cascade of events involved in activation of the gene (<a href=\"#bib23\">Herschlag and Johnson, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Hager et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Metivier et al., 2006</a>). In support of this latter view, we observe that there was a delay between photoactivation of the ligand and the appearance of the first transcription sites (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). This delay was comparable in size to the average duration of the off period. In contrast, a non-chromatinized or weakly chromatinized template showed extremely rapid induction (&lt;20 min). It is plausible that chromatin remodeling is inefficient at this reporter gene, possibly because the promoter lacks <i>cis</i>-acting elements which might aid in a more rapid chromatin remodeling response. Taken together, these results support the notion that opening of chromatin interposes a delay between the docking of active ligand-receptor complex on the response element and the eventual synthesis of pre-mRNA (<a href=\"#bib24\">Janicki et al., 2004</a>)."

Moreover, recent evidence points strongly toward chromatin as directly controlling the duration of the on and off states. Histone methylation has been implicated in the transmission of transcriptional frequency between mother and daughter cells (<a href=\"#bib40\">Muramoto et al., 2010</a>). Manipulation of histone acetylation changes transcriptional cycle timing (<a href=\"#bib22\">Harper et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Suter et al., 2011</a>). Histone deacetylases and nucleosome-remodeling complexes are cyclically recruited during transcriptional activation of an estrogen-responsive gene (<a href=\"#bib34\">M\u00e9tivier et al., 2003</a>). Importantly, FRAP studies on histones and genome-wide pulse-chase measurements on histones suggest a timescale of turnover (\u223chour) that is more consistent with the time scales of transcriptional activity observed in this study (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kimura and Cook, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Dion et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Deal et al., 2010</a>). The bimodal \u2018telegraph\u2019 model is likely a simplification of the number of biological steps involved in gene activation, but the quantitative agreement between this model and our data suggests that at steady state, the requirements for re-activating a gene that has cycled off may depend on only a few rate-limiting steps."

The laser is capable of operating from single-shot to 1 kHz at 120 \u03bcJ/pulse. All data was acquired at 37\u00b0C using a Delta T stage incubator and objective heater (Bioptechs, Butler, PA). The UV and visible excitation were focused through a U-Apo 40 \u00d7 1.35 NA oil lens, and the emission was collected through the same objective. Excitation, emission, and dichroic optics were custom designed for simultaneous UV and visible excitation (Chroma).

Next, the diffraction-limited spots are fit using a Gaussian mask algorithm (<a href=\"#bib59\">Thompson et al., 2002</a>) to generate a list of positions. The complete time-dependent trajectories were then constructed using a tracking algorithm (<a href=\"#bib12\">Crocker and Grier, 1996</a>).

The causes of transcriptional bursting are unknown, but this ubiquitous phenomenon has profound consequences for development, differentiation, and disease progression. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms of gene regulation in vivo requires understanding how <i>cis</i>- and <i>trans</i>-acting elements work in concert to modulate properties of the gene burst. With the exception of one other study that observed single gene bursting directly (Yunger, et al. (2010)), all other studies in mammalian cells are based on measuring protein distributions and inferring transcriptional activity. While such studies have been informative, they depend on numerous assumptions about RNA export, translation, RNA decay, proteolysis, etc. Such an approach would not have revealed the phenomena we observed in our work. In this study, we have shown that steroid receptors, which are present in all metazoans and are also the target of a billion dollar pharmaceutical industry, have a mechanism of action in vivo (frequency modulation) that is at odds with the standard pharmacological description of the last 60 years. This advance in basic biological understanding is concomitant with technical advances such as development of a true opto-genetic method for uncaging single genes and the ability to monitor single genes for hours in vivo. We believe this work establishes a template for understanding gene regulation at the cellular and molecular level. In the revised manuscript, we have made a more strenuous effort to emphasize the novelty of the approach and the findings."

Most studies look at the time response to a step increase in ligand concentration, where there is continuous availability of the ligand. With that caveat in mind, we agree with the referees that the long time lag is intriguing, especially since there is essentially no time lag for a transfected reporter. These data suggest that chromatin remodeling is perhaps inefficient at the reporter. It is possible that these exogenous <i>cis</i>-acting elements in the reporter lack features that aid in the rapid chromatin remodeling response for an endogenous steroid responsive gene. We have added several sentences to the Discussion to address this point. Building a reporter from the bottom up that recapitulates the rapid steroid response after uncaging is likely to yield fundamental insight. Such experiments are in progress but are beyond the scope of this study."
