Here, we perform an experimental test of evolutionary reversibility using directed evolution from a phosphotriesterase to an arylesterase, and back, and examine the underlying molecular basis. We find that wild-type phosphotriesterase function could be restored (&gt;10<sup>4</sup>-fold activity increase), but via an alternative set of mutations. The enzyme active site converged towards its original state, indicating evolutionary constraints imposed by catalytic requirements. We reveal that extensive epistasis prevents reversions and necessitates fixation of new mutations, leading to a functionally identical sequence. Many amino acid exchanges between the new and original enzyme are not tolerated, implying sequence incompatibility. Therefore, the evolution was phenotypically reversible but genotypically irreversible. Our study illustrates that the enzyme's adaptive landscape is highly rugged, and different functional sequences may constitute separate fitness peaks."

Here, we perform an experimental test of evolutionary reversibility using directed evolution from a phosphotriesterase to an arylesterase, and back, and examine the underlying molecular basis. We find that wild-type phosphotriesterase function could be restored (&gt;10<sup>4</sup>-fold activity increase), but via an alternative set of mutations. The enzyme active site converged towards its original state, indicating evolutionary constraints imposed by catalytic requirements. We reveal that extensive epistasis prevents reversions and necessitates fixation of new mutations, leading to a functionally identical sequence. Many amino acid exchanges between the new and original enzyme are not tolerated, implying sequence incompatibility. Therefore, the evolution was phenotypically reversible but genotypically irreversible. Our study illustrates that the enzyme's adaptive landscape is highly rugged, and different functional sequences may constitute separate fitness peaks."

The DNA does not revert to its original sequence because the effect of individual mutations on the phenotype depends on what other mutations are present. For example, as the enzyme evolved its new activity, additional mutations accumulated that did not alter enzyme activity. During the reverse evolution experiment, some of these mutations could have started to exert influence on the phenotype so that different mutations were required to restore the phosphotriesterase activity."

Also, through understanding reversibility on the levels of both phenotype and genotype, one could catch a glimpse at the structure of the respective fitness (or adaptive) landscape. The extent of ruggedness of adaptive landscapes\u2014that is, the prevalence of epistasis, and thus historical contingency\u2014have recently received considerable attention (<a href=\"#bib57\">Whitlock et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Poelwijk et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">de Visser et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Breen et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Harms and Thornton, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">McCandlish et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Kaltenbach and Tokuriki, 2014</a>). While the unlikelihood of reversing a historical pathway taken by evolution has been demonstrated (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bridgham et al., 2009</a>), a large number of sequences can encode functionally identical proteins (\u2018genotypic redundancy\u2019) and phenotypic reversion can still occur via alternative pathways (<a href=\"#bib12\">Clarke, 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Lenski, 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Crill et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Teotonio and Rose, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Kitano et al., 2008</a>). Yet, the evolutionary dynamics underlying phenotypic reversion have not been addressed. Does phenotypic reversion lead back to the ancestral peak on the adaptive landscape or to a new peak (<a href=\"#bib9\">Carneiro and Hartl, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Lobkovsky and Koonin, 2012</a>)? In other words, to what extent are the sequences of the ancestral and reverse-evolved proteins accessible via a neutral network\u2014that is, are amino acid exchanges between the two proteins tolerated or result in loss of function? The inability to exchange amino acids between homologous proteins due to epistasis represents \u2018genotypic incompatibility\u2019 and can result in a non-functional enzyme, a phenomenon which can be compared to the \u2018Dobzhansky-Muller effect\u2019 of hybrid incompatibility (<a href=\"#bib42\">Orr, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Kondrashov et al., 2002</a>)."

Restoration of function can either be brought about by the same structure and mechanism as in the ancestor, or by a distinct, alternative state. Structural convergence would indicate that functional requirements exist, which deterministically lead to one particular structural solution. On the other hand, structural divergence would imply the accessibility of various solutions that can bring about efficient catalysis. Thus, understanding the molecular basis for (ir)reversibility and (in)compatibility would provide valuable insights into protein sequence-function-structure relationships. What are the molecular requirements for a specific function? What structural changes are required to switch from one function to another? Identifying such changes, which are often based on subtle effects (e.g., on mutations occurring in remote locations, or mutations which only show a favorable effect in combination), remains a great challenge in protein science. What is the molecular basis underlying mutational epistasis, which leads to alternative evolutionary outcomes?"

High selection pressure can prevent fixation of neutral, functionally irrelevant mutations, resulting in an adaptive trajectory without mutational noise. All evolutionary intermediates (the \u2018molecular fossil record\u2019) are obtained, so the evolutionary dynamics and their molecular basis can be characterized in detail. Performing evolution in both the forward and reverse direction and comparing the changes in each direction provides a unique handle for identifying such effects. Understanding these phenomena would improve our ability to design and engineer novel proteins in the laboratory."

In the course of the trajectory, the original phosphotriesterase activity decreased drastically (10<sup>4</sup>-fold) although no selection pressure was applied against it. In this work, we first completed the functional transition by further decreasing the remaining phosphotriesterase activity (\u223c10-fold) by four additional rounds of directed evolution for maintaining arylesterase but reducing phosphotriesterase activity (<a href=\"#SD5-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). Briefly, libraries were generated by error-prone PCR and transformed into <i>Escherichia coli</i> (BL21 (DE3)). As a pre-screen for arylesterase activity, protein expression was induced in the bacterial colonies on agar plates, and a mixture of the substrate 2NH and a product stain (Fast Red) was added as previously described (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib46\">Roodveldt and Tawfik, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Tokuriki et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Wyganowski et al., 2013</a>). Upon hydrolysis of 2NH, Fast Red forms a red complex with the naphtholate leaving group, meaning colonies that develop a red color contain active arylesterase variants. In each round, 2000\u201310,000 colonies were screened in this fashion, theoretically covering most single point mutations in the 330 amino acid PTE gene. Positive colonies were then re-grown and re-assayed in 96-well plates and initial rates of both 2NH and paraoxon hydrolysis were determined in clarified lysate. In our experience, activity increases &gt;1.3-fold compared to the respective parent yielded reliably improved variants. The variant with the largest improvement in initial rate was then used as the template for the next round of error-prone PCR or several variants were subjected to DNA shuffling. To buffer the destabilizing effects of functional mutations and minimize reductions in soluble protein expression levels, we used GroEL/ES overexpression as previously described (<a href=\"#SD5-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>) (<a href=\"#bib55\">Tokuriki and Tawfik, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Wyganowski et al., 2013</a>). In total, with 22 rounds of \u2018forward evolution\u2019, the accumulation of 26 mutations from <i>wt</i>PTE resulted in a highly efficient and specialized arylesterase (AE) with a \u223c10<sup>5</sup>-fold increase in arylesterase rates (<i>k</i><sub>cat</sub>/<i>K</i><sub>M</sub> for 2NH &gt;10<sup>6</sup> M<sup>\u22121</sup>s<sup>\u22121</sup>) and an overall \u223c10<sup>5</sup>-fold decrease in phosphotriesterase activity (<i>k</i><sub>cat</sub>/<i>K</i><sub>M</sub> for paraoxon \u224810<sup>2</sup> M<sup>\u22121</sup>s<sup>\u22121</sup>, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B,C</a>). Because selection was specific for arylester hydrolysis until round 18, the change in phosphotriesterase activity was stochastic: many mutations decreased phosphotriesterase activity (11 mutations), some were neutral (nine mutations), and others increased phosphotriesterase activity (six mutations). Starting from AE, we then performed the reverse evolution to restore phosphotriesterase activity using an experimental setup equivalent to the forward process (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) with the following modifications: the pre-screen was carried out using a fluorogenic phosphotriester as a surrogate for paraoxon (<a href=\"#SD5-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>) and then validated in 96-well format as described above. The selection criterion was now an increased initial rate of paraoxon hydrolysis. In our evolutionary model system, variant fitness is defined as the level of enzymatic activity in cell lysate. All variants were also purified and the kinetic parameters determined, which correlated well with lysate activity (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, <a href=\"#SD6-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>)."

Moreover, it followed a \u2018diminishing returns\u2019 pattern characteristic for the development of a function under selection\u2014that is, the activity gain per mutation gradually decreased in later stages of the functional transition, where fitness reached a plateau (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib51\">Stebbins, 1944</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">MacLean et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Chou et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Khan et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Tokuriki et al., 2012</a>). Furthermore, trade-offs between the two activities were weak in the early rounds of evolution, resulting in a generalist, bifunctional intermediate (<a href=\"#bib3\">Aharoni et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Khersonsky and Tawfik, 2010</a>). In the forward evolution, trade-offs then became stronger, leading to specialization of the arylesterase. The reverse evolution, however, retained characteristics of a generalist: the large increase in phosphotriesterase activity (&gt;10<sup>4</sup>-fold) was accompanied by only a small (five-fold) reduction in arylesterase activity. A possible reason for this is that the reverse evolution is still at an early phase of the functional transition after 12 rounds (vs. 22 in the forward evolution). Because we were unable to isolate any variant with further improved phosphotriesterase activity, it might be necessary to impose a negative selection pressure to specialize the enzyme. The molecular basis of substrate binding and trade-offs is described further below (see also <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

The loss of phosphotriesterase in AE and its restoration in <i>neo</i>PTE is achieved mainly by changes in shape complementarity between enzyme and substrate, changes in hydrophobicity, and \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking (<b>A</b>\u2013<b>C</b>). It is likely that the movement of the \u03b2-metal also influences catalysis, although the exact effects of the metal displacement on catalysis are as yet unclear (<b>D</b>). (<b>A</b>) Interaction between paraoxon and residues 306 and 308. Substitution of the bulky <i>Phe</i>306 by Ile improves 2NH binding in AE, but results in a loss of interaction with paraoxon. In <i>neo</i>PTE, rather than reversion of <i>f</i>306I, <i>s</i>308 is mutated to the more hydrophobic Cys, improving interaction with the para-nitrophenyl group (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> pink region, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). (<b>B</b>) Steric hindrance between Phe271 and paraoxon. Substitution of <i>Leu</i>271 to the larger Phe improves 2NH binding in AE, but causes steric hindrance with paraoxon.

The inter-metal distance is reduced from 3.8 \u00c5 in <i>wt</i>PTE to 3.3 \u00c5 in AE through a movement of <i>His</i>201 and the \u03b2-metal. In <i>neo</i>PTE, the original spacing seen in <i>wt</i>PTE is restored (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> light blue region, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>), perhaps because the decreased distance in AE destabilized the transition state for paraoxon hydrolysis."

Nine additional \u2018new mutations\u2019 accumulated, two of which occurred in positions that were mutated in the forward evolution (V130M\u2014originally <i>leu</i>, I306M\u2014originally <i>phe</i>), and seven were in positions that were not previously mutated (<i>p</i>135S, <i>y</i>156H, <i>g</i>174D, <i>a</i>203E, <i>m</i>293K, <i>s</i>258N, <i>s</i>308C). Overall, <i>neo</i>PTE is separated further from <i>wt</i>PTE (28 out of 333 amino acids) than AE from <i>wt</i>PTE (26 amino acids). Additional rounds of evolution failed to yield more reversions or activity increases (<a href=\"#SD5-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). In the forward evolution, the loss of phosphotriesterase activity was largely a side product of the property under selection, the increase in arylesterase activity. Therefore, not all mutations decreased phosphotriesterase activity (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), and it is not surprising that phenotypic reversion did not require full genotypic reversion. However, a number of mutations that did contribute to decreasing phosphotriesterase in the forward process were also not reverted. Moreover, the new mutations are located in the same mutational clusters seen in the forward evolution (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>), indicating they may be alternative solutions to the same functional requirement and replace reversions, as detailed further below. Taken together, although the phenotype was reversible, PTE evolution was genotypically irreversible, but an alternative trajectory was readily taken."

We compared the structures and modeled both a paraoxon and a 2NH analogue into each active site (by superposition with structures containing these analogues [<a href=\"#bib23\">Hong and Raushel, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Tokuriki et al., 2012</a>]). The phosphotriester paraoxon is characterized by tetrahedral ground-state geometry and P\u2013O cleavage proceeds via a trigonal bipyramidal transition state. The arylester 2NH is planar and C\u2013O bond hydrolysis proceeds via a tetrahedral transition state. The structural comparison indicates that AE adapted to the planar substrate 2NH in the forward evolution, but that this came at a cost of phosphotriesterase activity, as the bulky paraoxon is no longer efficiently recognized (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). We identify several regions of the active site that may be responsible for the functional transition (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). First, a binding pocket for the naphthyl leaving group of 2NH was excavated through the combined action of <i>h</i>254R and <i>d</i>233E (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>, green region) (<a href=\"#bib23\">Hong and Raushel, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Tokuriki et al., 2012</a>). Leaving group coordination was further improved through a subtle \u223c1.0 \u00c5 shift of <i>Trp</i>131 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>, purple region). Moreover, the pocket was elongated through the <i>f</i>306I mutation (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>, pink region) and narrowed by <i>l</i>271F (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>, orange region), resulting in better accommodation of the long hexanoate chain of 2NH. These changes may lead to the reduction of phosphotriesterase activity through loss of interactions (either shape complementarity, hydrophobicity, or \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking) in several regions and steric hindrance in others, as described in further detail below (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Additionally, the distance between the two active site zinc ions decreased from 3.8 \u00c5 to 3.3 \u00c5 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>, light blue region and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The observed structural changes are subtle, at the sub-angstrom scale, and their contributions to catalysis unquantified. However, the dispersion precision indicator (DPI; <a href=\"#bib16\">Cruickshank, 1999</a>) for each of the structures is less than one-tenth of an angstrom, meaning that the observed distance changes (including the 0.5 \u00c5 shift in the metal position) are significant (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

The regions of suboptimal binding were re-optimized for paraoxon and the metal distance was restored to the 3.8 \u00c5 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Moreover, the pattern of loop flexibility that is characteristic of <i>wt</i>PTE was also restored in <i>neo</i>PTE (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Furthermore, we measured linear free energy relationships for <i>wt</i>PTE, AE, and <i>neo</i>PTE for both arylester and phosphotriester hydrolysis (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4</a>), that is, the dependence of the catalytic parameters <i>k</i><sub><i>cat</i></sub>/<i>K</i><sub><i>M</i></sub> on the pKa of the leaving group. For phosphotriester hydrolysis by <i>wt</i>PTE, a break in pKa dependence around 7 is consistent with the rate-limiting step changing on either side of this break (<a href=\"#bib23\">Hong and Raushel, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Tokuriki et al., 2012</a>). By contrast, AE shows a continuous, linear dependence over the whole pKa range, indicating that the rate-limiting step does not change. In <i>neo</i>PTE, the pattern characteristic for <i>wt</i>PTE was restored. Together with the observed structural convergence, the simplest assumption must be that the very similar active site environment enables similar residue contributions to catalysis in <i>wt</i>- and <i>neo</i>PTE on phosphotriesterase activity. However, active site convergence is not complete, as the naphthyl binding pocket remains intact (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>, green region, Arg254 and Glu233), which likely explains why <i>neo</i>PTE is still bifunctional."

However, in the combined forward and reverse evolution, which involved a change in catalytic activity of &gt;10<sup>4</sup> M<sup>\u22121</sup>s<sup>\u22121</sup> in each direction, only four mutations were located in the active site. Instead, most functional mutations occur in more remote positions. Therefore, it is likely that fine-tuning of the active site by these remote mutations contributes significantly to the activity changes. Taken together, the restoration of all structural elements key for phosphotriesterase activity as well as the catalytic mechanism occurred despite the alternative genotypic trajectory, suggesting that biophysical requirements exist for this particular active site shape, and that phosphotriesterase activity may otherwise be inefficient."

In this experiment, we attempted to restore phosphotriesterase activity by a trajectory containing only new mutations. To this end, we sequenced the improved variants after each round and removed all those containing reversions. This trajectory only resulted in a 70-fold improvement in five rounds (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>), after which the activity plateaued and no further improved variants could be found. This failure to reach wild-type activity levels without reversions, as well as the fact that three out of the five new mutations obtained (<i>p</i>135S, <i>a</i>203E, <i>s</i>308C, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>) were identical to the successful trajectory containing reversions, emphasizes that the number of adaptive trajectories that lead to a wild-type level fitness peak from AE are highly limited. However, trajectories involving neutral mutations, or trajectories which do not pass through the best variant in each round but through less improved intermediates, may exist. It is likely that a wild-type-like paraoxon binding pocket is compulsory to achieve efficient phosphotriesterase activity, and only a small set of mutations (e.g., reversions or the combination of reversions and new mutations that we identified) can provide such a solution."

If they populate the same fitness plateau, amino acid exchanges between them should be neutral. On the other hand, a loss of function upon interconversion between amino acids would indicate genotypic incompatibility (<a href=\"#bib33\">Kondrashov et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Lunzer et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Wellner et al., 2013</a>), meaning that the two enzymes occupy distinct positions on the landscape that are poorly connected through a neutral network. To this end, we characterized the effect of all 28 single point exchanges separating the two enzymes in each background (56 mutants in total, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> and <a href=\"#SD6-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>). Mutations are considered non-neutral if they cause a &gt;1.3-fold change in phosphotriesterase activity in lysate compared to the parent background because, in our screening system, this cut-off enabled us to reliably identify improved variants. Moreover, we have performed a statistical analysis of the mutational effects, which confirms that a &gt;1.3-fold change is significant (p-values &lt;0.05) in almost all cases (statistics are provided in <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a> and <a href=\"#SD6-data\">Supplementary file 2B</a>). According to this analysis, only eight of 28 exchanges were compatible; they were neutral in both backgrounds (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). The remaining 20 positions showed incompatibility, 15 of which were partially incompatible, as the exchange was neutral in one background but deleterious in the other (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,C</a>). Five exchanges were completely incompatible; they severely decreased activity in both backgrounds (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Taken together, despite &gt;90% sequence identity between <i>wt</i>- and <i>neo</i>PTE, the reverse trajectory led to a functional sequence that is poorly connected with the original one. It remains unknown whether the two sequences comprise completely separate peaks on the adaptive landscape or are connected through a neutral network, that is, if the neutral exchanges would permit the subsequent occurrence of initially deleterious exchanges. However, because &gt;70% of the mutated positions cause incompatibility, only one out of the 54 exchanges confers higher fitness, and this exchange (<i>neo</i>PTE + <i>f</i>306M) would require two simultaneous base changes, it is unlikely that an evolutionary transition between the two could easily occur by adaptive or strong purifying selection."

To illustrate, the effect of R254<i>h</i> was measured as follows: AE and <i>neo</i>PTE contain Arg254, and thus the effect of R254<i>h</i> is directly calculated based on the comparison between AE and AE-R254<i>h</i> (Fold change<sub>R254<i>h</i></sub> = Acticity<sub>AE-R254<i>h</i></sub>/Activity<sub>AE</sub>) and between <i>neo</i>PTE and <i>neo</i>PTE-R254<i>h</i> (Fold change<sub>R254<i>h</i></sub> = Acticity<sub><i>neo</i>PTE-R254<i>h</i></sub>/Activity<sub><i>neo</i>PTE</sub>). However, because <i>wt</i>PTE and the forward evolution background already contain <i>His</i>254, the effect of introducing this amino acid has to be calculated \u2018in reverse\u2019 by first assuming to remove this mutation and then adding it back in, that is, based on the comparison between <i>wt</i>PTE-<i>h</i>254R and <i>wt</i>PTE (Fold change<sub>R254<i>h</i></sub> = Acticity<sub><i>wt</i>PTE</sub>/Activity<sub><i>wt</i>PTE-<i>h</i>254R</sub>).

In the forward evolution, the effect of mutations is significantly altered after their fixation due to epistasis caused by mutations subsequently accumulated in the trajectory. For example, some mutations initially increased (<i>t</i>172I in round 6 and <i>l</i>271F in round 14) or were neutral to (<i>l</i>130V in round 14) phosphotriesterase activity when they occurred in the trajectory, and were thus unfavorable to revert as their reversion would not change (V130<i>l</i>) or decrease (I172<i>t</i>, F271<i>l</i>) activity (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). However, reversion of these mutations became possible (i.e., would lead to an increase in activity) in the background of AE (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). On the contrary, <i>h</i>254R decreased phosphotriesterase activity when it occurred in round 1 and therefore its reversion (R254<i>h</i>) would initially be favorable. However, the effect of this reversion switched to unfavorable (R254<i>h</i>) when it was tested in AE (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Moreover, mutations in the forward evolution had a permissive effect on the accumulation of new mutations and, in this way, opened up a path towards the alternative trajectory taken in the reverse process; all new mutations had a neutral or negative effect on phosphotriesterase activity in the genetic background of <i>wt</i>PTE but most of them become positive in AE (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>); for example, AE-s308C (6.4-fold), AE-V130M (5.4-fold) and AE-<i>p</i>135S (2.9-fold). Because these mutations can compete with the most favorable reversions (&gt;1.3\u20138-fold effect, <a href=\"#SD6-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>), they were selected in the early rounds of the reverse evolution, laying the foundation for the alternative trajectory."

                                "text": "In the reverse evolution, the active site architecture necessary for phosphotriesterase activity was restored largely through new mutations, which restricted the reversion of mutations accumulated in the forward evolution. Overall, nine of the 10 reversions that were initially favorable in the background of AE lost their favorable effect in <i>neo</i>PTE because of epistasis during the reverse evolution (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). We were able to trace the molecular basis of this effect in several cases as described in the following. First, <i>f</i>306I enlarged the active site in the forward evolution, resulting in a loss of shape complementarity to paraoxon. In the reverse evolution, the nearby <i>s</i>308C offsets this effect by increasing the hydrophobicity of the pocket (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). The redundancy of the mutations <i>f</i>306I and <i>s</i>308C was also evidenced by combinatorial mutational analysis; incorporation of <i>s</i>308C restricts subsequent reversion of I306<i>f</i> due to sign epistasis (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). While this reversion would have been favorable in isolation, phosphotriesterase activity of the double mutant AE-I306<i>f</i>-<i>s</i>308C is reduced compared to AE-<i>s</i>308C. Second, the active site was narrowed in the forward evolution by <i>l</i>271F and several other mutations in loop7/8 including <i>l</i>272M and <i>i</i>313F (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), causing steric hindrance for paraoxon. The pocket was re-opened initially by the reversion F271<i>l</i>. Subsequently, the new mutation <i>s</i>258N destabilized and altered the conformation of loop 7 and further enlarged the pocket (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). We also observed that incorporation of <i>s</i>308C and F271<i>l</i> restricted the reversion of both <i>l</i>272M and <i>f</i>313I (M272<i>l</i> and I313<i>f</i>, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). Third, the active site was reshaped by a subtle \u223c1.0 \u00c5 shift of <i>Leu</i>106 and <i>Trp</i>131, which was likely triggered by a cluster of remote mutations occurring in the same loops (<i>s</i>102T, <i>l</i>130V, <i>m</i>138I, <i>s</i>137T, and <i>v</i>140M, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>, and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). In the reverse evolution, these residues are shifted back to their original positions through two new remote mutations, <i>p</i>135S and V130M (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). Again, the two mutations are redundant and mutually exclusive; <i>p</i>135S restricts the reversion of <i>m</i>138I (I138<i>m</i>, <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). Fourth, the distance between the two active site zinc ions decreased from 3.8 to 3.3 \u00c5 in the forward evolution through displacement of the metal-chelating <i>His</i>201 and the \u03b2-metal (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>), which was likely triggered by the combined action of several remote mutations in loops 4 and 5 (<i>t</i>172I, <i>q</i>180H, <i>t</i>199I, and <i>a</i>204G, <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). In the reverse evolution, the positions of <i>His</i>201 and the \u03b2-metal, as well as the original inter-metal distance of 3.8 \u00c5, were restored through the reversion I172<i>t</i> and formation of a new hydrogen bonding network with two additional new mutations, <i>a</i>203E and <i>g</i>174D (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>). These examples demonstrate that rewiring the intramolecular interaction network of the protein can result in the same physical solution in key elements in the active site. Rewiring occurs because new mutations act as \u2018epistatic ratchets\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bridgham et al., 2009</a>) for potential reversions, restricting their fixation and thus leading to the incompatible new enzyme <i>neo</i>PTE."

Phenotypic reversal has been observed in previous cases (<a href=\"#bib12\">Clarke, 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Lenski, 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Crill et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Teotonio and Rose, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Kitano et al., 2008</a>), supporting the notion that the phenotype is largely subject to deterministic forces. The likelihood of evolutionary reversibility depends on the complexity of the system and the distance in sequence and function from the ancestor, and it is possible that starting from a more distantly evolved arylesterase would have failed to restore phosphotriesterase function. Moreover, we modulated protein stability throughout the entire trajectory using overexpression of GroEL/ES to avoid evolutionary dead ends caused by stability bottlenecks (<a href=\"#bib50\">Socha and Tokuriki, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Wyganowski et al., 2013</a>). In the absence of chaperones, adaptation may have occurred through a different pathway. Another limitation of our work is that we only examined two evolutionary trajectories (the main trajectory and the trajectory without reversions). One could imagine conducting multiple parallel evolutionary experiments to shed light on the repeatability of the trajectory taken, but unfortunately our screening system is not amenable to such a throughput. Nevertheless, our experiment shows that the genotype is subject to strong constraints: an alternative mutational pathway was taken which prevented retracing of the original pathway. Genotypic irreversibility was caused by several factors. First, because selection in the forward evolution was only for increased arylesterase activity (except in rounds 19\u201322), the effect of the mutations on phosphotriesterase activity was stochastic: most decreased phosphotriesterase activity, some did not affect it, and some increased phosphotriesterase activity. Therefore, even if one were to revert the mutations in the reverse order of their occurrence (from rounds 22 back to 1), the lack of continuous activity increases would prevent a gradual adaptive trajectory. Second, by the end of the forward evolution, several new mutations able to increase paraoxonase activity emerged due to epistasis. The fixation of these mutations then acts as an epistatic ratchet (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bridgham et al., 2009</a>) that prevents reversions. Therefore, as soon as the first new mutation accumulates, the trajectory deviates further from the original path."

                        "text": "Our work suggests that only certain sets of mutations are able to cause phenotypic reversal. Although genotypic redundancy was observed, the presence of at least some reversions was essential for complete restoration of catalytic activity, and several new mutations were shared between the two trajectories examined. Similarly, other experimental evolution studies that examined parallel evolutionary trajectories starting from the same sequence often resulted in accumulation of the same mutations (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bull et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Salverda et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Dickinson et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Khanal et al., 2014</a>). These observations indicate that a number of functional mutations accessible from a particular starting point are highly limited, and that the genotype is also subjected to deterministic forces to some extent. In our case, the limited accessibility to functional mutation can be explained by the requirement to adapt the wild-type active site configuration in order to obtain efficient phosphotriesterase hydrolysis. Recent work by Harms et al. showed that the accessibility of functional and permissive mutations on hormone receptors is also strongly constrained by biophysical requirements imposed on the binding pocket as well as by protein dynamics (<a href=\"#bib22\">Harms and Thornton, 2014</a>). Understanding such biophysical requirements and, in the case of enzymes, imperatives of chemical reactivity, is essential to develop our knowledge of evolutionary dynamics and constraints, although the exact nature of such requirements may be unique to each protein."

All but four of the 33 mutations occur in locations remote from the active site and act by fine-tuning rather than directly changing the active site configuration. Some changes occur at the sub-\u00c5 level (e.g., the shift in <i>Trp</i>131, <i>Leu</i>132, and the \u03b2-metal), and possibly act by influencing the dynamics of the active site loops. It may be that only remote mutations can achieve such subtle optimization. A mutation directly in the active site would result in a larger, more disruptive change (e.g., even a single additional carbon center would fill an additional 4 \u00c5 radius) and therefore be unable to provide the necessary fine-tuning. Other directed evolution studies also observed the accumulation of remote mutations (<a href=\"#bib41\">Morley and Kazlauskas, 2005</a>), suggesting that fine-tuning of the active site may be a common strategy to implement a new function."

                        "text": "Our work reveals that the adaptive landscape of PTE is highly rugged: even single amino acid changes can regulate activities upwards or downwards and also predetermine the potential effect of subsequent mutations. As discussed above, because multiple mutations can directly or indirectly affect the same key component for catalysis, their effects are likely to be epistatic. Therefore, the alternative trajectory is caused by epistasis between mutations: frequently, those mutations that accumulate first have a permissive or restrictive effect on subsequent mutations. Overall, &gt;70% of mutations have highly variable effects on phosphotriesterase activity, depending on the genetic background (26 out of 33 positions, <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>), and \u223c40% showed sign epistasis (7 out of 33). The role of epistasis in natural evolution has recently received much attention, but its extent and prevalence are still under debate (<a href=\"#bib57\">Whitlock et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Poelwijk et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">de Visser et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Breen et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Harms and Thornton, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">McCandlish et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Kaltenbach and Tokuriki, 2014</a>). Our findings suggest a high frequency of strong epistatic interactions during functional adaptation and therefore support the view that epistasis is paramount in shaping evolution. However, while restrictive mutations block many of the possible evolutionary trajectories, as has been previously emphasized, permissive mutations simultaneously open up new pathways, avoiding \u2018evolutionary dead-ends\u2019 and contributing to the diversity of enzyme homologs found in nature."

In nature, the environment never ceases to change and a temporary relaxation in selection pressure (i.e., the level and type of nutrients or toxins) followed by re-adaptation (through both reversions and new compensatory mutations) may be common (<a href=\"#bib4\">Akashi et al., 2012</a>). Higher levels of organization (such as metabolic or regulatory networks) might be subject to similar contingency; restoration of a certain function may be achieved by alternative mutations in other parts of the protein structure, in other domains, or in a different protein altogether. If the mutations are mutually exclusive, sequence incompatibilities may arise rapidly. Therefore, in addition to proposed mechanisms such as genetic drift (<a href=\"#bib4\">Akashi et al., 2012</a>), genotypic irreversibility may contribute to the prevalence of incompatibility between orthologous enzymes (<a href=\"#bib37\">Lunzer et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Kvitek and Sherlock, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Corbett-Detig et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Wellner et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Schumer et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Shafee et al., 2015</a>)."

Colonies were transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane (BioTrace NT Pure Nitrocellulose Transfer Membrane 0.2 \u03bcm, PALL Life Sciences, Port Washington, NY, United States), which was then placed onto a second plate additionally containing 1 mM isopropyl \u03b2-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPGT) 200 \u03bcM ZnCl<sub>2</sub> (to ensure availability of Zn<sup>2+</sup> ions necessary for enzymatic activity), and either 20% (wt/vol) arabinose for chaperone overexpression or 20% (wt/vol) glucose for repression of chaperone expression. After expression overnight at room temperature for plates containing arabinose or for 1 hr at 37\u00b0C for plates containing glucose, the membrane was placed into an empty petri dish. For low activity levels of the parent gene where a maximum signal is desirable, cells were lysed prior to the activity assay by alternating three times between storage at \u221220\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C. For higher activities, the lysis step was omitted, making it easier to differentiate between different colonies. For the activity assay, 20\u201325 ml of 0.5% Agarose in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5 containing 200 \u03bcM 2NH (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, United States) and Fast Red (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, United States) was poured onto the membrane. Red color developed within 30 min.

Wells contained 200 \u03bcl lysogeny broth (LB) supplemented with 100 \u03bcg/ml ampicillin and 34 \u03bcg/ml chloramphenicol. Subsequently, deep well plates containing 500 \u03bcl LB per well supplemented with ampicillin, chloramphenicol, and 20% (wt/vol) arabinose or glucose (depending on whether chaperone overexpression was to be induced or repressed) were inoculated with 25 \u03bcl of pre-culture and grown for 2\u20133 hr at 37\u00b0C until the OD<sub>600</sub> reached \u223c0.6.

Paraoxon hydrolysis was monitored at 405 nm; 2NH hydrolysis was monitored at 500 nm via complex formation with Fast Red. Improvements &gt;1.3-fold relative to the previous round were considered significant. The best clones were picked and re-grown in triplicate. The observed initial rates were normalized to cell density (determined by the OD<sub>600</sub>) and the average values determined. Approximately 10 improved variants were sequenced after each round.

My primary concern with this manuscript is the frequent claim throughout it that evolution is \u201cirreversible\u201d. This isn't really accurate, I don't think. The mutations that accumulated could always be reversed in the exact, reverse order in which they initially occurred. I think what the authors really mean when they say \u201cirreversible\u201d is that (i) the probability of an exact reversion of multiple mutations is improbable and (ii) reversion of only some mutations may not restore the original phenotype if other mutations have also occurred. In other words, let's say evolution of <i>wt</i>PTE into AE required substitutions Z1z and Y2y (i.e. ZY at positions 1/2 = phenotype 1 and zy at positions 1/2 = phenotype 2) but that a third mutation, say X3x occurred at position 3. If that mutation is incompatible with ZY (i.e. ZYX = phenotype 1, while ZYx = dead protein) then the authors are saying evolution is irreversible. But that's not really logical. It is formally reversible, provided one also reverses the mutation at position 3. So, bottom line, I get what the authors are driving at, but their language is imprecise and, as a consequence, misleading. This issue affects much of the manuscript and needs attention."

Because of this redundancy, evolution is unlikely to return to the exact same genotype following selection for a new trait followed by selection for the old trait. Additionally, they have nicely documented the epistasis that occurs during their experimental evolution, showing how mutations can have very different effects on the <i>wt</i>PTE, AE, and <i>neo</i>PTE genetic backgrounds, or what they call genetic incompatibility. I think these ideas should be articulated more clearly rather than selling the idea of irreversibility, which, as noted above, doesn't seem at all logical to me."

It sheds useful light on an important question in molecular evolution: the extent of epistasis during evolutionary trajectories and its potential effects on evolutionary processes, particularly evolutionary reversal to ancestral states. Numerous studies have addressed this problem computationally or at the phenotypic level, but our understanding of molecular irreversibility is limited. A previous molecular study showed that epistasis can prevent functionally important substitutions during historical evolution from being directly reversed, but that study did not show whether or how the ancestral function could be reacquired if the protein were subject to selection pressure to do so. The submitted manuscript is the first to use a directed evolution approach to address this question, and this strategy is quite appropriate for this purpose."

For example, in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> and the claims based on these data, the authors use a 1.3-fold change in activity as a threshold of significance: changes smaller than this are considered neutral, while those that reduce activity by a factor larger than this (or by its reciprocal, to be precise), are considered deleterious. I don't see a justification for this threshold, which seems arbitrary, although it is very important for the conclusions. The authors must justify this choice rationally or change their claims. In this figure, the claim the authors want to make pertains to incompatibility; for such a claim to be made, there should be evidence to show that a state from PTE is deleterious in <i>neo</i>PTE, or vice versa: the evidence of a deleterious effect must be strong enough for us to rule out the possibility that the state is in fact neutral or beneficial. I see error bars, but I don't know what they represent, and I therefore don't know how confident I should be that many of these mutations are authentically deleterious (that is, that I can rule out the possibility that the true effect of the mutation is zero, but error over a small number of measurements has yielded a spurious reduction in activity.) The authors should apply an appropriate statistical procedure to keep the rate of false discoveries of incompatibility to an acceptable level, considering the large number of tests being conducted."

It looks like one has a very small negative effect and the other a very small positive effect, and it is not obvious whether we can rule out zero (and therefore no difference in sign) for either one, based on the error bars. There are many other putative examples of sign epistasis in this figure for which it appears to be difficult to rule out different signs due to stochastic/measurement error around a near-zero effect. Again, we need a proper test or statistical characterization of confidence for all these claims. Similar problems affect many of the paper's figures."

The thinking and language here are imprecise. All proteins are by definition connected via some number of mutations on the adaptive landscape. The question the authors seek to address whether they are accessible from each other via a continuously connected neutral (or functional) network of single-replacement changes (in the sense used by Maynard Smith and A. Wagner). Incompatibility of single mutation-swaps does not mean that proteins cannot be reached through such a connected network. If permissive mutations interact epistatically with the \u201cincompatible\u201d amino acid and if the permissive mutations can be introduced without deleterious effect on the function, then the genotypes with and without the \u201cincompatible\u201d amino acid can in fact be connected. Incompatibility does mean that the cluster of functional genotypes containing the ancestral state at the residue of interest and the functional network of genotypes containing the derived state have fewer connections than they might have if no incompatibility were present. That is all that can be said about connectivity without further analysis. The large number of incompatibilities the authors observe may indicates that the number of connections is reduced in a fairly dramatic way, but how dramatic the reduction is relative to the total number of possible connections a priori is also unknown without further analysis."

This is not clearly thought out. If there were no epistasis and no selective barriers to reacquisition of the ancestral genotype (or any other genotype that confers the ancestral function), and so long as there were numerous genotypes that encode the ancestral function, then selection for the ancestral phenotype is likely to produce different outcomes every time. That is, the simple fact that under selection the genotype that evolved is different from the ancestral genotype does not establish epistasis, incompatibility, or irreversibility. It is the authors' other experiments that show this."

In the Discussion, however, it appears that they use the term literally, as if the evolution of this enzyme could cause reproductive isolation between populations of organisms. There is no evidence to support this causal leap, and the authors should avoid this type of discussion of the issue. If they are making an analogy between reproductive isolation of populations due to epistasis/Dobzhansky-Muller effect and the evolution of incompatible amino acids in their PTE enzymes that is fine, but the analogy should be labeled as such \u2013 as a metaphor. The authors say that evolution of the genotype is \u201cconstrained\u201d to follow certain paths deterministically under selection for the ancestral function, and they say that Harms et al. \u201cshowed that the evolution of hormone receptors is similarly constrained by functional requirements imposed on the binding pocket.\u201d The comparison seems imprecise. The Harms paper argued that evolution of the protein does not proceed deterministically, because function-changing mutations require prior rare mutations that do not change the function; the rarity of these permissive mutations comes from the fact they must fulfill numerous requirements. The authors are comparing this case to their own, in which they say the evolution of certain aspects of the ancestral genotype is deterministic because they represent the only way to achieve the ancestral function. The language should be cleaned up here."

(This is not surprising, because the term is used variously and inconsistently in the literature, too.) Here, the authors say that catalytic requirements impose evolutionary constraints that virtually guarantee that something like the ancestral structure will re-evolve when selection for the ancestral function is imposed. This usage seems inconsistent with the way the term constraint has usually been used. Although the term has numerous meanings, it is almost always used to describe requirements that slow the rate of evolution or limit the capacity of selection to produce an outcome: 1) \u201cfunctional constraints,\u201d which refers to limitations on the process of genetic drift that are imposed by purifying selection and thus limit the rate of evolution; 2) \u201cdevelopmental (and similar) constraints,\u201d which refers to limits on the kinds of variation that mutation can produce and make available selection; or 3) biochemical constraints or trade-offs, which make it nearly impossible for mutation and selection to produce an outcome that is \u201coptimal\u201d for some property looked at in isolation. The authors' point seems to be that there is one easily accessible way of solving the \u201cproblem\u201d of esterase activity imposed by the selection pressure, so evolution is likely to always produce this outcome. This doesn't seem to me to be a constraint but rather a lack of constraint on the capacity of mutation and selection to produce exactly what the experimenters have asked it to do.

An increase in activity of 1.3-fold by a mutation \u201cis considered significant.\u201d The authors say that clones displaying a 1.3-fold improvement are generally verified as authentically displaying an increase in activity upon repeat examination. There are several issues about which I am concerned here. The first is that no data are provided to support this justification for the threshold; in fact, it is never articulated in the paper, although it is found in the letter. Thus the 1.3-fold threshold remains unjustified in the text. Second, the use of this threshold in defining examples of epistasis strikes me as problematic. Mutations that produce an observed increase in activity by &gt;1.3x in one background but not another are judged to be epistatically modified. Thus, an increase of 1.4x in one background but 1.2x in another exhibit epistasis, because they are significantly improved in the first case but not the second. The authors do not present any way to establish whether the differences between these two genotypes are really statistically or biologically significant, so the claim of epistasis remains unjustified. The authors argue that a statistical analysis shows that most cases of 1.3x improvement are statistically significant (also not shown), but this is beside the point; the relevant issue is whether the <i>difference</i> between the effects of a mutation in two genetic backgrounds is statistically and biologically significant, not whether a 1.3-fold effect one mutation is different from no effect. Many, although not all, of the authors' examples of epistasis in the paper are, in fact, rather subtle examples of phenomena like this \u2013 not sign epistasis, or very large effects vs. very small or no effects, but the difference between an effect slightly greater than 1.3 and one slightly less. I therefore believe that the authors need to strengthen this aspect of the analysis. I recommend a test of differences of effect between backgrounds."

They say that the B-factors are low, but this is of limited relevance. This indicates that there is limited thermal motion for these atoms, but the resolution of the structure still does not allow location of the atom with precision greater than the stated resolution, which is necessary to strongly support the claims made. I believe this could be dealt with in the manuscript with more direct cautionary language and softening of the claims."

Do the authors mean that if the alleles were brought together in a heterozygote that recombination within the gene would produce nonfunctional proteins and might be selected against? Are they arguing that this might contribute to speciation? If that's what the authors mean, they should say so, but it seems very far-fetched and marginally relevant to our understanding of protein evolution. I think the effects of epistasis on the evolutionary potential of a protein are a much more solid basis for the authors' interpretation."

So the figure suggests that changing R254 to H increases phosphotriesterase activity by 13-fold. But the <i>wt</i> enzyme has <i>His</i> at 254, not <i>Arg</i>.

My primary concern with this manuscript is the frequent claim throughout it that evolution is \u201cirreversible\u201d. This isn't really accurate, I don't think. The mutations that accumulated could always be reversed in the exact, reverse order in which they initially occurred. I think what the authors really mean when they say \u201cirreversible\u201d is that (i) the probability of an exact reversion of multiple mutations is improbable and (ii) reversion of only some mutations may not restore the original phenotype if other mutations have also occurred. In other words, let's say evolution of</i> wt<i>PTE into AE required substitutions Z1z and Y2y (i.e. ZY at positions 1/2 = phenotype 1 and zy at positions 1/2 = phenotype 2) but that a third mutation, say X3x occurred at position 3. If that mutation is incompatible with ZY (i.e. ZYX = phenotype 1, while ZYx = dead protein) then the authors are saying evolution is irreversible. But that's not really logical. It is formally reversible, provided one also reverses the mutation at position 3. So, bottom line, I get what the authors are driving at, but their language is imprecise and, as a consequence, misleading. This issue affects much of the manuscript and needs attention</i>."

First, if all mutations accumulated in the forward trajectory would be either detrimental or neutral to phosphotriesterase activity, it would certainly be the case that exact reversal of the mutations from rounds 22 back to 1 would lead to a theoretically possible trajectory. However, some of the forward mutations actually increased phosphotriesterase activity, meaning their reversal would not be possible.

If it interacts with the amino acids in positions 1 and 2 and negates the effect of reversions z1Z and y2Y, these transitions will be blocked. Alternatively, X3x could also be a mutation that occurred in the forward trajectory and increased phosphotriesterase activity, in which case it could also not be reverted. Again, if it shows sign-epistasis with the other two positions, they cannot be reverted either. Therefore, we argue that irreversibility and incompatibility are strongly connected.

An increase in activity of 1.3-fold by a mutation \u201cis considered significant.\u201d The authors say that clones displaying a 1.3-fold improvement are generally verified as authentically displaying an increase in activity upon repeat examination. There are several issues about which I am concerned here. The first is that no data are provided to support this justification for the threshold; in fact, it is never articulated in the paper, although it is found in the letter. Thus the 1.3-fold threshold remains unjustified in the text. Second, the use of this threshold in defining examples of epistasis strikes me as problematic. Mutations that produce an observed increase in activity by &gt;1.3x in one background but not another are judged to be epistatically modified. Thus, an increase of 1.4x in one background but 1.2x in another exhibit epistasis, because they are significantly improved in the first case but not the second. The authors do not present any way to establish whether the differences between these two genotypes are really statistically or biologically significant, so the claim of epistasis remains unjustified. The authors argue that a statistical analysis shows that most cases of 1.3x improvement are statistically significant (also not shown), but this is beside the point; the relevant issue is whether the</i> difference <i>between the effects of a mutation in two genetic backgrounds is statistically and biologically significant, not whether a 1.3-fold effect one mutation is different from no effect. Many, although not all, of the authors' examples of epistasis in the paper are, in fact, rather subtle examples of phenomena like this \u2013 not sign epistasis, or very large effects vs. very small or no effects, but the difference between an effect slightly greater than 1.3 and one slightly less.

However, due to the nature of the dataset, i.e., each background has a different amino acid, the exact numbers in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> are certainly not easy to digest, although the color coding already gives a good impression of the prevalence of epistasis \u2013 this is why it is important in this figure to give all mutations in the same direction, even though this means sometimes adding a mutation, sometimes \u201ctaking it out\u201d and calculating the effect of \u201cputting it back in\u201d. To better explain the numbers and directions of the effect, we rewrote the figure legend and sincerely hope will now make it easier to understand how the data was processed."

While you have removed the confusing former term, the latter still appears in several places in the text. This is fine, but it needs, in some instances, a bit of clarification and adjustment of the language. For instance, the Abstract states that the reverse evolution experiment performed led \u201cto a different sequence incompatible with the original one, despite functional identity.\u201d As written, the statement is ambiguous and confusing in the sense that what you really mean is that certain substitutions that occurred during the reverse evolution process are incompatible with some of the residues present in the ancestral/original protein. It's not that the whole sequence is somehow incompatible with the original one, as written.
