Their viral particles contain several hundred copies of a helically arrayed coat protein (CP) protecting a (+)ssRNA. We describe here a structure at 3.9 \u00c5 resolution, from electron cryomicroscopy, of <i>Pepino mosaic virus</i> (PepMV), a representative of the genus <i>Potexvirus</i> (family <i>Alphaflexiviridae</i>). Our results allow modeling of the CP and its interactions with viral RNA. The overall fold of PepMV CP resembles that of nucleoproteins (NPs) from the genus <i>Phlebovirus</i> (family <i>Bunyaviridae</i>), a group of enveloped (-)ssRNA viruses. The main difference between potexvirus CP and phlebovirus NP is in their C-terminal extensions, which appear to determine the characteristics of the distinct multimeric assemblies \u2013 a flexuous, helical rod or a loose ribonucleoprotein. The homology suggests gene transfer between eukaryotic (+) and (-)ssRNA viruses."

Their viral particles contain several hundred copies of a helically arrayed coat protein (CP) protecting a (+)ssRNA. We describe here a structure at 3.9 \u00c5 resolution, from electron cryomicroscopy, of <i>Pepino mosaic virus</i> (PepMV), a representative of the genus <i>Potexvirus</i> (family <i>Alphaflexiviridae</i>). Our results allow modeling of the CP and its interactions with viral RNA. The overall fold of PepMV CP resembles that of nucleoproteins (NPs) from the genus <i>Phlebovirus</i> (family <i>Bunyaviridae</i>), a group of enveloped (-)ssRNA viruses. The main difference between potexvirus CP and phlebovirus NP is in their C-terminal extensions, which appear to determine the characteristics of the distinct multimeric assemblies \u2013 a flexuous, helical rod or a loose ribonucleoprotein. The homology suggests gene transfer between eukaryotic (+) and (-)ssRNA viruses."

Their infective particles are non-enveloped and flexible rod-shaped virions (<a href=\"#bib13\">Kendall et al., 2008</a>) and contain several hundreds of copies of a coat protein (CP) arranged in a helical fashion protecting a ssRNA of positive polarity, or (+)ssRNA (<a href=\"#bib13\">Kendall et al., 2008</a>). They are distributed in families <i>Alphaflexiviridae, Betaflexiviridae, Closteroviridae</i>, and <i>Potyviridae</i>, which have different genomic organizations (particularly different between <i>Potyviridae</i> and the rest of the groups) and belong to different superfamilies, but it is thought that their CPs have strong evolutionary relationships (<a href=\"#bib15\">Koonin et al., 2015</a>). Structural studies of virions by X-ray fiber diffraction and cryoEM have indeed revealed a common architecture for flexible plant viruses. The filaments are 120-130 \u00c5 in diameter, and the CPs are arranged following helical symmetry with slightly less than 9 subunits per turn (<a href=\"#bib13\">Kendall et al., 2008</a>). This overall arrangement is shared by <i>Soybean mosaic virus</i> (SMV) a potyvirus (from the family <i>Potyviridae</i>), and three different potexviruses (family <i>Alphaflexiviridae), Potato virus X</i> (PVX), <i>Papaya mosaic virus</i> (PapMV), and <i>Narcissus mosaic virus (</i>NMV) (<a href=\"#bib14\">Kendall et al., 2013</a>, <a href=\"#bib31\">Yang et al., 2012</a>, <a href=\"#bib13\">Kendall et al., 2008</a>). The flexibility of the virions has limited high-resolution structural studies, and most of the previous data were at moderate resolution. Very recently, the cryoEM structure of <i>Bamboo mosaic virus</i> (BaMV), another potexvirus, was determined at 5.6 \u00c5 (<a href=\"#bib6\">DiMaio et al., 2015</a>), and the CP was modeled based on the atomic structure of a truncated version of the CP from <i>Papaya mosaic virus</i> (PapMV CP) (<a href=\"#bib31\">Yang et al., 2012</a>). The work revealed that N- and C-terminal extensions of the CP mediate viral polymerization and allow for the flexuous nature of the virions."

The NPs from phleboviruses are associated with the viral genome in loose ribonucleoproteins\u00a0(RNPs) (<a href=\"#bib25\">Raymond et al., 2012</a>) protected inside an envelope, in which inserted glycoproteins construct an icosahedral shell (<a href=\"#bib11\">Huiskonen et al., 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib8\">Freiberg et al., 2008</a>).

The 3D map at 3.9 \u00c5 of resolution (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1A,B</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s3\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3</a>) was calculated by single particle-based helical image processing implemented in Spring software (<a href=\"#bib5\">Desfosses et al., 2014</a>). The cryoEM map reveals a left-handed helix with a diameter of 130 \u00c5 and an inner narrow channel of 13 \u00c5, and the structure shows a pitch of 34.6 \u00c5 and 8.7 CP copies per turn. This overall helical arrangement is in agreement with previous works with other potexviruses (<a href=\"#bib14\">Kendall et al., 2013</a>, <a href=\"#bib31\">Yang et al., 2012</a>), but in the current case and in the recent cryoEM structure of BaMV (<a href=\"#bib6\">DiMaio et al., 2015</a>) the attained resolutions allowed a clear assignment of the symmetry. Our cryoEM map reaches near-atomic resolution, to date the highest resolution structural data for a flexible filamentous virion, where bulky protein side chains are discernible (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). This allowed us to generate an atomic model for PepMV CP (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>) by iterative modeling starting with the atomic structure of PapMV CP (see 'Materials and methods'). The PepMV CP structure thus generated has three major regions: the core; an N-terminal flexible arm; and a C-terminal extension. The first 20 amino acids in the N-terminal side are not included in the atomic model because the region projects outwards, and its density vanishes due to high flexibility. The modeled structure for PepMV CP is, as defined for PapMV CP, an all-helix fold, and the low RMSD between the two structures (1.5 \u00c5 in the core region) reflects their clear homology (<a href=\"#fig1s5\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5</a>)."

The ssRNA runs in a helix of 70 \u00c5 in diameter (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Each CP binds five ribonucleotides (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>), so that the entire genome of PepMV would require 1290 copies of PepMV CP spanning 510 nm (3.95 \u00c5 of axial rise/subunit), which agrees with the 509 nm length originally reported for the virus (<a href=\"#bib12\">Jones et al., 1980</a>). The signal clearly separates the individual nucleotides, but we could not identify the bases due to the helical averaging of the variable sequence of the ssRNA. In order to explore the protein\u2013ssRNA interactions, we modeled a polyU and included a set of four PepMV CP monomers in a molecular dynamics flexible fitting (MDFF) simulation (<a href=\"#bib30\">Trabuco et al., 2008</a>) (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s2\">2</a>). The results show that the RNA resides in a continuous groove with a high electropositive potential (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>) constructed by CPs from consecutive turns of the helix. Local resolution measurements in the cryoEM map suggest a high variability in positions 3 and 4 at the segmented density for the ssRNA (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Several amino acids display potential interactions with the phosphate backbone of the ssRNA. S92 and S94 in one face, and Q203 at the opposite side of the ssRNA might interact at positions 1 and 3 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Backbone torsion angles of 85\u00b0 and 130\u00b0 at these positions allow the binding of the base at position 2 into a deep pocket (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). Three polar-charged residues, R124, D163, and K196 might establish H-bonding contacts with this RNA base. D163 is in the most conserved region within the genus <i>Potexvirus</i>, and the consensus sequence FDFFD (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>) constructs the floor of the RNA binding pocket.

A similar type of interaction was observed between subunits in the crystal structure of PapMV CP via amino acid F13 (<a href=\"#bib31\">Yang et al., 2012</a>), and for BaMV, by residue W41 (<a href=\"#bib6\">DiMaio et al., 2015</a>). We tested in\u00a0vivo the relevance of F28 in the assembly of PepMV by assaying a PepMVCP F28A mutant in trans-complementation and viral purification experiments. The F28 mutant allows cell-to-cell movement (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>) but does not produce fully assembled virions (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>), suggesting that the tested mutation allows for the functional separation of the cell-to-cell movement of PepMV from the encapsidation of fully assembled virions, reinforcing the notion of a non-virion RNP structure during the intercellular movement of potexviruses through plasmodesmata (<a href=\"#bib19\">Lough et al., 2000</a>)."

                                "text": "All the high-resolution structures for flexuous filamentous plant viruses correspond to representatives of the genus <i>Potexvirus</i> (family <i>Alphaflexiviridae</i>) and include our current data and previously reported structures of PapMV CP (<a href=\"#bib31\">Yang et al., 2012</a>) and BaMV virions (<a href=\"#bib6\">DiMaio et al., 2015</a>). We cannot confirm whether members of other families of flexuous filamentous viruses (<i>Betaflexiviridae, Closteroviridae</i> and <i>Potyviridae</i>) have a similar fold in their CPs. We have, nevertheless, looked for structural neighbours within the database of Dali server (<a href=\"#bib10\">Holm and Rosenstrom, 2010</a>). The search revealed that the CP structure from potexviruses shares its topology with the NP of several representatives of genus <i>Phlebovirus</i> (family <i>Bunyaviridae</i>), such as <i>Rift Valley fever virus</i> (RVFV), <i>Toscana virus</i>, and <i>Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus</i> (SFTSV). These viruses infect animals, including humans, are transmitted by arthropod vectors, and pose serious public health concerns. Genera <i>Potexvirus</i> and <i>Phlebovirus</i> belong to different superfamilies of RNA viruses when these are classified based on phylogenetic relationships among RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp) and also have different genomic organizations (<a href=\"#bib15\">Koonin et al., 2015</a>). Moreover, the organization of phlebovirus particles is very different. They have segmented (-)ssRNA associated with the NP in loose RNPs (<a href=\"#bib25\">Raymond et al., 2012</a>), and these are protected inside an icosahedral shell of glycoproteins inserted in a membrane, as has been observed for RVFV (<a href=\"#bib11\">Huiskonen et al., 2009</a>, <a href=\"#bib8\">Freiberg et al., 2008</a>). The topology of CP from potexviruses and of the NP from phleboviruses (illustrated for RVFV) are, nonetheless, very similar (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4A and 4C</a>) and show a TM-score of 0.51 when aligned, pointing to a common family fold (<a href=\"#bib33\">Zhang and Skolnick, 2005</a>). The similarities include: the overall topology of the all-alpha helical domain; the N-terminal arm and its binding site from the adjacent protomer, and hence, the side-by-side mechanism for oligomerization; the groove for the ssRNA binding; and the relative positions of all these elements. The crystallographic studies with phlebovirus NPs have shown tetrameric, pentameric, and hexameric oligomers, in which each NP interacts with the core of the adjacent subunit via an N-terminal arm (<a href=\"#bib34\">Zhou et al., 2013</a>) following the same side-by-side polymerization mechanism shown in potexviruses. The divergence between potexvirus CP and phlebovirus NP is in their C-terminal regions. The C-terminus in PepMV CP protrudes from the core domain (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>) and allows longitudinal interactions for helix building. The C-terminus of the phlebovirus NP folds back into the core region and participates in the RNA-binding site that incorporates seven bases/subunit (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). The location of the C-terminal arm in phlebovirus NPs cannot support a longitudinal assembly, and hence, their RNPs remain more loosely associated (<a href=\"#bib25\">Raymond et al., 2012</a>) than in their plant-virus counterparts."

Simulations were run with the CHARMM27 force field with CMAP corrections (<a href=\"#bib20\">Mackerell et al., 2004</a>) in explicit solvent at a gscale of 0.3. Simulation parameters were kept as specified by the MDFF plug-in with the exception of margin (2), cutoff (12), switchdist (10), pairlistdist (16), nonbondedFrequency (1), and fullElectFrequency (1). Simulation used restraints for secondary structure, chirality and cispeptide derived from the initial atomic model. During the first 10 ns of the simulation RNA atoms were first coupled to the density while keeping the protein backbone atoms constrained and vice versa. Following this, RNA and protein heavy atoms were simultaneously fitted into the density for 30\u00a0ns. Finally, 10,000 steps of energy minimization were performed with a grid scaling of 0 in order to increase the stability of the resulting structure. Electrostatic surface potential was calculated in Delphi (<a href=\"#bib17\">Li et al., 2012</a>)."

The overall fold of PepMV CP resembles that of nucleoprotein (NPs) from the genus Phlebovirus (family Bunyaviridae), a group of enveloped (-)ssRNA viruses.
