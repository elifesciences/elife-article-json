Here, we show that P1-HNF4\u03b1 is expressed primarily in the differentiated compartment of the mouse colonic crypt and P2-HNF4\u03b1 in the proliferative compartment. Exon swap mice that express only P1- or only P2-HNF4\u03b1 have different colonic gene expression profiles, interacting proteins, cellular migration, ion transport and epithelial barrier function. The mice also exhibit altered susceptibilities to experimental colitis (DSS) and colitis-associated colon cancer (AOM+DSS). When P2-HNF4\u03b1-only mice (which have elevated levels of the cytokine resistin-like \u03b2, RELM\u03b2, and are extremely sensitive to DSS) are crossed with <i>Retnlb<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice, they are rescued from mortality. Furthermore, P2-HNF4\u03b1 binds and preferentially activates the RELM\u03b2 promoter. In summary, HNF4\u03b1 isoforms perform non-redundant functions in the colon under conditions of stress, underscoring the importance of tracking them both in colitis and colon cancer."
