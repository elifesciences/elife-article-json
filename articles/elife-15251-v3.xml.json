In this study, we describe a novel subset of murine dermal perivascular macrophages that extend protrusions across the endothelial junctions in steady-state and capture blood-borne macromolecules. Unlike other skin-resident macrophages that are reconstituted by bone marrow-derived progenitors after a genotoxic insult, these cells are replenished by an extramedullary radio-resistant and UV-sensitive Bmi1<sup>+</sup> progenitor. Furthermore, they possess a distinctive anti-inflammatory transcriptional profile, which cannot be polarized under inflammatory conditions, and are involved in repair and remodeling functions for which other skin-resident macrophages appear dispensable. Based on all their properties, we define these macrophages as Skin Transendothelial Radio-resistant Anti-inflammatory Macrophages (STREAM) and postulate that their preservation is important for skin homeostasis."

In this study, we describe a novel subset of murine dermal perivascular macrophages that extend protrusions across the endothelial junctions in steady-state and capture blood-borne macromolecules. Unlike other skin-resident macrophages that are reconstituted by bone marrow-derived progenitors after a genotoxic insult, these cells are replenished by an extramedullary radio-resistant and UV-sensitive Bmi1<sup>+</sup> progenitor. Furthermore, they possess a distinctive anti-inflammatory transcriptional profile, which cannot be polarized under inflammatory conditions, and are involved in repair and remodeling functions for which other skin-resident macrophages appear dispensable. Based on all their properties, we define these macrophages as Skin Transendothelial Radio-resistant Anti-inflammatory Macrophages (STREAM) and postulate that their preservation is important for skin homeostasis."

Homeostasis is also maintained in a number of peripheral non-lymphoid tissues by the phagocytic, anti-microbial and tissue remodeling activities of specialized resident macrophages, including alveolar macrophages in lungs, interstitial histiocytes in connective tissue, osteoclasts in bone, microglia in brain, Kupffer cells in liver, peritoneal, intestinal and adipose tissue macrophages (<a href=\"#bib45\">Murray and Wynn, 2011</a>). Likewise, macrophages contribute to the barrier function of the skin. Unlike migratory epidermal Langerhans cells and dermal dendritic cells, which are mobilized after topical antigen uptake to perform their tolerogenic or immunogenic role within the draining lymph nodes (<a href=\"#bib27\">Henri et al., 2010</a>), skin-resident macrophages remain in the dermis, contributing to pathogen clearance, tissue repair and the resolution of inflammation (<a href=\"#bib46\">Pasparakis et al., 2014</a>)."

Herein, we define for the first time a clear dichotomy among the skin-resident macrophages based on their differential sensitivity to \u03b3-irradiation. Radio-resistant and radio-sensitive skin macrophages are distinctively polarized already in steady state as revealed by transcriptional analysis. Consequently, these two macrophage subsets are functionally specialized in a cell-autonomous manner even though both subsets are exposed to mostly shared environmental cues. In particular, the radio-resistant macrophage subset comprises a novel type of perivascular macrophages that gain access to the vascular lumen, are highly phagocytic and possess anti-inflammatory properties even in the presence of pro-inflammatory stimuli. Moreover, they are renewed from a local Bmi1<sup>+</sup> progenitor and become outcompeted over time by bone marrow-derived resident macrophages. Finally, the preferential depletion of these skin transendothelial radio-resistant anti-inflammatory macrophages (STREAMs) using diphtheria toxin-OVA nanoparticles evidences their involvement in tissue repair and remodeling, as well as the inability of their radio-sensitive counterparts to act as functional surrogates."

                                "text": "To visualize the microvascular network of the skin, we performed intravital imaging of the upper dermis of the mouse ear under steady-state conditions using a minimally invasive model based on confocal microscopy (<a href=\"#bib2\">Auffray et al., 2007</a>). The vasculature was highlighted by injecting i.v. a non-permeable vascular tracer, high molecular weight (HMw; 2\u00a0MDa) TRITC-dextran. Remarkably, a population of perivascular cells became readily visible during the first hours after HMw dextran injection, suggesting that these mostly sessile cells were constantly taking up intravascular dextran (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a> and <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). This observation was further confirmed by monitoring the uptake of two differently labeled HMw dextrans injected with a lapse of 24\u00a0hr (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Dextran administration followed by the subsequent injection of a non-phagocytosable tracer (vivotag) revealed the presence of dextran<sup>+</sup> protrusions as non-stained regions in the vivotag channel projecting into the vessel lumen (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). The protrusions were flapping inside the vessels, presumably deflected by the vascular flow, and even contacting circulating cells (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a> and <a href=\"#media2\">Videos 2</a>\u2013<a href=\"#media4\">4</a>). The phenotypic characterization of the TRITC-dextran<sup>+</sup> perivascular cells identified them mostly as macrophages (i.e., they were either CD45<sup>+</sup> F4/80<sup>high</sup> CD11c<sup>-</sup> CD11b<sup>+</sup> or CD45<sup>+</sup> F4/80<sup>high</sup> CD11c<sup>-</sup> CD64<sup>+</sup> cells by FACS [<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a> and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>] and CD68<sup>+</sup> cells by whole-mount immunofluorescence staining [<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>]). Flow cytometry analysis of skin single-cell suspensions from 12-week-old animals showed that the 96.67% \u00b1 1.02% of all TRITC-dextran<sup>+</sup> cells were CD45<sup>+</sup> and the 90.41% \u00b1 2.06% of CD45<sup>+</sup> TRITC-dextran<sup>+</sup> cells corresponded to macrophages (CD64<sup>+</sup>). In addition, TRITC-dextran<sup>+</sup> macrophages represented 41.28% \u00b1 5.66% of total skin macrophages. Next, we performed a mesoscopic analysis of murine ears to characterize the spatial distribution of skin macrophages. This analysis revealed their preferential localization around dermal blood microvessels rather than lymphatics (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a> and <a href=\"#media5\">Video 5</a>). Interestingly, TRITC-dextran<sup>+</sup> macrophages were mostly apposed to capillaries and venules, possibly because the dense smooth muscle layer wrapping arterioles prevented the access of macrophages to the arteriolar lumen (<i>data not shown</i>). Moreover, endothelial cells did not detectably capture dextran under our experimental conditions, ruling out the possibility of the endothelium making accessible the intravascular dextran to the perivascular macrophages by transcytosis (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>)."

We detected dextran<sup>+</sup> macrophages embracing vessels from outside the pericyte sheath (visualized as GFP<sup>+</sup> cells around vessels using a nestin-eGFP reporter mouse), whereas their protrusions extended across the basement membrane (stained with anti-collagen IV) and between pericytes to reach the endothelial wall (whole-mount immunofluorescence stainings in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). We also visualized dextran<sup>+</sup> macrophage protrusions aligned with endothelial junctions in vivo by intravital microscopy by injecting i.v. an anti-CD31 antibody to stain the luminal surface of dermal microvasculature (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1D</a> and <a href=\"#media6\">Video 6</a>). Further analysis using orthogonal sectioning of whole-mount immunofluorescence stainings indicated that the macrophages insert their protrusions in the intravascular space through endothelial intercellular junctions (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Interestingly, TRITC-dextran uptake was minimal in VE-cadherin-\u03b1-catenin knock-in mice (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). In these animals, endothelial adherens junctions are stabilized (<a href=\"#bib52\">Schulte et al., 2011</a>), which prevents paravascular permeability and leukocyte paracellular but not transcellular diapedesis. The ability of dermal macrophages to access the intraluminal space is restricted in these animals, supporting the observation that macrophages can reach the vascular lumen crossing the endothelial junctions and excluding the possibility that their protrusions reach the vessel lumen via a transcellular route through endothelial cells. Finally, since the capture of dextran by skin myeloid cells is mediated by the mannose receptor (CD206) (<a href=\"#bib63\">Wollenberg et al., 2002</a>), we could selectively stain the intraluminal protrusions of these dermal perivascular macrophages in vivo by injecting i.v. anti-CD206 and quantified the amount of endothelial-protruding macrophages by FACS (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). Altogether these data indicate the existence of hitherto unidentified dermal perivascular macrophages able to protrude across endothelial junctions to reach the vascular lumen in homeostatic conditions."

However, dextran<sup>+</sup> macrophages did not express fluorescent reporter protein in <i>Cx3cr1<sup>gfp/+</sup> </i>mice, neither in other myeloid reporter strains such as <i>Lyz2Cre:Rosa26YFP</i> and <i>Langerin-eGFP</i> (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Then, we generated chimeric animals by reconstituting lethally irradiated C57BL/6 mice with \u03b2-actin-GFP<sup>+</sup> hematopoietic progenitors, since it has been previously reported the absence of radio-resistant macrophages in the skin (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bogunovic et al., 2006</a>). Unexpectedly, dextran<sup>+</sup> dermal macrophages did not express GFP in these chimeras (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a> and <a href=\"#media7\">Video 7</a>), indicating that they were not replaced by BM-derived macrophages after irradiation and suggesting that they could be a specialized radio-resistant subset of skin-resident macrophages never characterized before. In fact, we monitored the presence of perivascular macrophages able to phagocytose intravascular HMw dextran 7d after lethal \u03b3-irradiation without BM reconstitution (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). To further assess their radio-resistant nature, we reconstituted lethally irradiated CD45.2 host mice with CD45.1 BM progenitors. Reconstitution of the hematopoietic system in blood and lymphoid organs was complete after 12 weeks, with a negligible residual contribution of host cells to the myeloid compartment. In contrast, the chimerism rate in the skin myeloid subsets exhibited a higher contribution of the host populations, which could not be ascribed to blood reconstitution (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C\u2013D</a>). The host radio-resistant CD45.2<sup>+</sup> macrophages efficiently captured HMw dextran under steady-state conditions and were found mostly positioned around microvessels (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1E</a>). To validate this observation in a homeostatic context devoid of irradiation, the uptake of intravascular dextran was also analyzed in parabiotic mice maintained for 6 months with a shared circulation. The results obtained were similar to those of chimeric animals, inasmuch as only host macrophages captured intraluminal dextran (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>)."

These GFP<sup>+</sup> macrophages provide guidance cues for the recruitment of inflammatory cells such as neutrophils during intradermic bacterial infection (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abtin et al., 2014</a>). To analyze whether the dermal endothelial-protruding macrophages correspond to the GFP<sup>+</sup> macrophages described above, we injected HMw TRITC-dextran in DPE-GFP animals. Remarkably, ~80% of cells that acquired circulating HMw dextran were GFP<sup>\u2013</sup> in the skin of DPE-GFP mice (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Furthermore, chimerism experiments in which we reconstituted lethally irradiated CD45.2 DPE-GFP hosts with CD45.1\u00a0hematopoietic progenitors revealed a dramatic decrease in the number of GFP<sup>+</sup> dermal macrophages one month after the genotoxic insult, indicating their radio-sensitive nature (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>).

We first treated chimeric animals intradermally with clodronate liposomes to deplete skin macrophages. Monitoring at 24\u00a0hr after injection showed depletion of both macrophage subsets, whereas after 7d we observed selective partial recovery of host macrophages, consistent with an in situ renewal of these cells (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Then, we performed Ki-67 staining in the\u00a0skin of\u00a0host and donor macrophages from chimeric animals using LC as control cells endowed with self-renewal potential (<a href=\"#bib14\">Chorro et al., 2009</a>) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). The results point out to host macrophages as the only cell type assayed unable to proliferate by itself in steady-state. We complemented the study analysing the incorporation of BrdU administered ad libitum during 8d in these subsets (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). The results indicate that host radio-resistant macrophages have a slower turnover compared to BM-derived donor macrophages and LC. Altogether these findings suggest that skin radio-resistant macrophages are a long-lived differentiated population that originates from an in situ proliferating progenitor. Interestingly, the relative content of resident macrophages from donor and host changed dynamically over time in favor of the dominant BM-derived pool, which exhibits higher proliferative capacity (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>)."

First, we performed an analysis of the expression of a panel of stemness-related genes demonstrating that skin-resident macrophages possess no pluripotent potential per se in steady-state (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). Then, we employed a reporter mouse (<i>Bmi1</i>-IRES-Cre-ERT2 Rosa26 YFP) driven by the promoter of <i>Bmi1</i>, gene involved in the maintenance of adult stemness (<a href=\"#bib51\">Sangiorgi and Capecchi, 2008</a>), which enabled us to trace adult stem cells and their progeny in skin (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). Macrophages contain very low levels of the <i>Bmi1</i> transcript (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>) and are devoid of <i>Bmi1</i> protein in steady-state (<a href=\"#bib56\">Sienerth et al., 2011</a>).

Generation of YFP<sup>+</sup> macrophages was increased during macrophage replenishment after depletion with s.c. clodronate treatment (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2D</a>). Moreover, microscopy analysis of the dermis of these reporter animals detected perivascular YFP<sup>+</sup> cells protruding into vessels (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>). To exclude the contribution of BM-derived hematopoietic stem cells in this system, we generated chimeric CD45.1 C57BL/6 wt//<i>Bmi1</i>-IRES-Cre-ERT2 Rosa26 YFP CD45.2 (donor/host) mice. YFP<sup>+</sup> dextran<sup>+</sup> macrophages were detected in the skin of tamoxifen-treated HMw dextran-injected chimeric mice by FACS analysis (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G\u2013H</a>).

To further characterize these two populations, we performed a detailed phenotypic characterization of host radio-resistant and donor BM-derived macrophages in chimeric mice after 3 months of reconstitution. Both subsets were F4/80<sup>high</sup>, CD11b<sup>+</sup> and expressed similar levels of other myeloid markers such as Ly6C and CD115, as well as of the prototypic macrophage markers CD68 and CD64-MertK (whose combined expression is associated with mature tissue macrophages [<a href=\"#bib19\">Gautier et al., 2012</a>]) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>).

Nevertheless, the broad range of expression of these differential markers within each macrophage subset precluded their use to dissect accurately the heterogeneity found among the skin-resident macrophages (example provided for MHC-II in <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>)."

Of 17,741 genes compiled, we found significant differences in 744, 135 corresponding to protein coding sequences with similar normalized expression levels across replicates (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B\u2013C</a>, and <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). A comprehensive Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) of all genes expressed in at least one cell type showed 36 Kegg pathways upregulated in host radio-resistant macrophages (14 of them enriched at a nominal p-value &lt; 1%) vs. 149 in donor macrophages (26 pathways enriched at a nominal p-value &lt; 1%). The GSEA analysis confirmed striking differences in metabolism between the two resident macrophage populations in homeostatic skin (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2A</a> and <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>). Host radio-resistant macrophages displayed a metabolic gene profile based on fatty acid oxidation and oxidative phosphorylation, whereas donor BM-derived macrophages showed a glycolytic gene profile. Such metabolic differences found at the gene expression level were confirmed by assessing mitochondrial activity ex vivo.\u00a0Direct staining of the skin with an indicator of mitochondrial membrane potential (MitoTracker Orange CMTMRos) revealed elevated mitochondrial function in host radio-resistant macrophages, although both macrophage subsets contained comparable amounts of mitochondria per cell (as indicated by similar levels of Tomm20, a translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane) (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). Thus, the metabolic profiles of donor and host macrophages in homeostatic skin mirrored the metabolic reprogramming of pro-inflammatory classically activated and anti-inflammatory alternatively activated macrophages (<a href=\"#bib18\">Galvan-Pena and O'Neill, 2014</a>), respectively."

To examine this possibility, we isolated both macrophage subsets treated them ex vivo\u00a0with LPS, a stimulus for which both subsets expressed the prerequisite receptors (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Interestingly, the pro-inflammatory macrophages became activated and produced substantial levels of CCL4, CCL5, CXCL1, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 (among other pro-inflammatory mediators examined) in comparison to control conditions, whereas the anti-inflammatory subset did not produce significant amounts of these cytokines and chemokines in response to LPS (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). However, the anti-inflammatory macrophages produced IL-10 in response to IL-4 stimulation (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>). These results suggest that the anti-inflammatory macrophages have a dearth of functional plasticity, being refractory to pro-inflammatory challenges but responsive to anti-inflammatory stimuli.

For this purpose, we studied the capacity of STREAMs to capture nanoparticles coated with ovalbumin (OVA), another ligand for the mannose receptor (<a href=\"#bib8\">Burgdorf et al., 2006</a>) that is highly expressed on their surface. In this manner, we ensured the active capture of the particulate OVA (OVA-coated fluorescent nanoparticles (FITC fluospheres), \u03a6=0.2\u2009\u03bcm) from the bloodstream, preventing its passive diffusion into the perivascular tissue that could allow for extravascular phagocytosis. We first observed that OVA fluospheres injected i.v. were specifically captured by skin macrophages\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>), and this process was abrogated after the depletion of skin macrophages by s.c. clodronate treatment (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>). Intravital imaging followed by flow cytometry evaluation confirmed that the macrophages able to capture OVA fluospheres were dextran<sup>+</sup> in C57BL/6 wt animals (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1A</a> and <a href=\"#media8\">Videos 8</a>\u2013<a href=\"#media9\">9</a>) as well as radio-resistant in CD45.1/CD45.2 (donor/host) C57BL/6 chimeras (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8D\u2013E</a>). The availability of blood-borne nanoparticles in peripheral circulation is limited by the filtering action of mainly the liver and spleen, and therefore the amount of OVA-coated beads captured by skin STREAMs was low compared with that of splenic macrophages (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>); however, this amount was increased in \u03b3-irradiated and splenectomized animals (<a href=\"#fig8s1\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>)."

OVA-coated nanoparticles (NP) adsorbed with diphtheria toxin (DT). In contrast to the i.v. administration of clodronate liposomes, which failed to eradicate skin STREAMs (<i>data not shown</i>), this tailored experimental strategy depleted preferentially STREAMs preserving most of the other skin macrophages that had no access to the blood-borne toxin-coated NPs (<a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Then, the potential anti-inflammatory function of STREAMs in tissue repair was interrogated using a model of wound healing in combination with DT-OVA-NP treatment. Animals were treated either with OVA-NP or DT-OVA-NP (2.5\u2009\u03bcl/g per dose) 1d before and 2d after wounding and were sacrificed at d5, observing a clear decrease in the macrophage population (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A,D</a>). At this mid-stage of repair, macrophage depletion was associated with a significant delay in the healing process (measured as\u00a0% of area of initial wound) (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>) and the histological analyses revealed a marked reduction in the formation of granulation tissue, concomitant reduced angiogenesis as well as delayed re-epithelialization (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C\u2013D</a>). Next, we administered a sole dose (2.5\u2009\u03bcl/g) of DT-OVA-NP 2d after wounding and monitored wound closure till d9. In this manner, the macrophage depletion was attained after the initial inflammatory phase of wound healing (<a href=\"#bib23\">Gurtner et al., 2008</a>). The Masson trichrome staining demonstrated a clear defect in collagen deposition in the animals treated with DT-OVA-NP (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10A</a>). This defect correlated with the disordered distribution of myofibroblasts in these animals observed with the \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (SMA) staining (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10B</a>). These results contrasted with the abundant collagen deposition and the parallel organization of myofibroblasts in OVA-NP-treated animals (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10A\u2013B</a>). This noticeable phenotype observed in macrophage function-related parameters indicates that STREAMs could exert a prominent role as the macrophages involved in orchestrating tissue remodeling and repair in skin, as anticipated by their anti-inflammatory gene and protein expression profile."

The observation of this phenomenon in chimeric animals allowed us to further characterize STREAMs as a radio-resistant subset of skin macrophages, whose turnover is ensured by an extramedullary source. We could also determine that STREAMs are committed to perform anti-inflammatory functions, lacking the plasticity to be reprogrammed in the presence of a potent pro-inflammatory stimulus. Finally, the selective depletion of STREAMs highlighted their function in tissue repair and remodeling processes to regain skin homeostasis."

CX3CR1<sup>+</sup> myeloid cells in the central nervous system could also gain access to vasculature (<a href=\"#bib4\">Barkauskas et al., 2013</a>) and mast cells were recently reported to capture blood-borne IgE, albeit the underlying mechanism remains unknown (<a href=\"#bib13\">Cheng et al., 2013</a>). Herein, we report that STREAMs are unique macrophages in that they traverse the endothelial junctions of non-fenestrated dermal vasculature to take up circulating macromolecules under homeostatic conditions. STREAM\u2019s protrusions only emerge through the endothelial cell-cell junctions and do not use a transcellular route, as illustrated using a genetic approach (the VE-cad-\u03b1-cat transgenic mouse line, which display impregnable, highly stable adherens junctions). Moreover, unlike subcapsular sinus macrophages in lymph nodes, which act like fly paper retaining lymph-borne viral particles on their surface for subsequent transfer to B cells (<a href=\"#bib33\">Junt et al., 2007</a>), STREAMs internalize particulate antigens, such as OVA-FITC Fluospheres, and might play a role in their cross-presentation to tissue-resident memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells."

This study reveals that STREAMs are a radio-resistant subset that coexists in steady state with other skin macrophages of radio-sensitive nature. In this regard, the radio-resistant macrophages described in (<a href=\"#bib25\">Haniffa et al., 2009</a>) might be the human homolog of this mouse subset, extending the generality and impact of our findings. The chimerism, parabiosis and fate mapping experiments also indicate that STREAMs are maintained locally in the skin throughout adult life independently of circulatory precursors, as opposed to radio-sensitive macrophages that are renewed at a low rate from blood in steady state and replaced by donor BM progenitors after a genotoxic insult. Thus, our data further extent the previous knowledge on the minimal blood exchange experienced by tissue-resident macrophages in other tissues (<a href=\"#bib26\">Hashimoto et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Yona et al., 2013</a>)."

STREAMs are unable to self-renew in steady-state and their turnover from a Bmi1<sup>+</sup> adult progenitor occurs at a low basal rate, becoming outcompeted over time by other skin-resident macrophages with faster turnover. Hence, our results concur with previous studies reporting a dual origin for skin macrophages with a prenatally-derived CCR2-independent subset and a postnatal BM-derived CCR2-dependent subset, being the prenatally-derived subset displaced by the BM-derived subset with age (<a href=\"#bib30\">Jakubzick et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Tamoutounour et al., 2013</a>).

In this regard, the GSEA of our RNASeq data highlight clear differences in the metabolic gene profiles of host radio-resistant and BM-derived macrophages. We found an enrichment in genes involved in glycerolipid, glycerophospholipid and linoleic acid metabolism, as well as in glycosphingolipid biosynthesis in the gene profile of radio-resistant macrophages. These results are compatible with the energetic requirements and the regulation of membrane fluidity needed for phagocytosis and are also crucial for tissue remodeling (<a href=\"#bib5\">Biswas and Mantovani, 2012</a>). Other genes enriched in this subset are related to fibrogenesis and tissue repair such as <i>Tgfb1</i> and genes of the Hedgehog signaling pathway, as well as genes related to taurine and hypotaurine metabolism, being consistent this with an antioxidant protective role. Conversely, the transcriptional profile of the BM-derived macrophages includes an over-representation of genes associated with the carbohydrate and retinol metabolisms such as the pentose phosphate pathway, with the ABC transporters and the JAK-STAT and WNT signaling pathways, in accordance with their pro-inflammatory potential. Moreover, a gene encoding a regulator of the metabolic switch from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis (<i>Trap1</i>) (<a href=\"#bib66\">Yoshida et al., 2013</a>) is specifically expressed in BM-derived macrophages."

Interestingly, the study by Calderon and colleagues (<a href=\"#bib9\">Calderon et al., 2015</a>) highlights the imprinting of distinct features in macrophages by their anatomical localization within the steady-state pancreas. The macrophages in the islets possess a pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype and protrude into the fenestrated vessels, whereas the stromal milieu sets the response of the macrophages in favor of the M2 phenotype. This pattern of regional specialization might not be applicable to the skin where, e.g., perivascular macrophages with pro-inflammatory (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abtin et al., 2014</a>) and anti-inflammatory (STREAMs) phenotypes coexist in the same areas. However, although both subsets mostly share environmental stimuli, STREAMs can get access to the intravascular milieu and might receive selective signals that could contribute to maintain their phenotype. Therefore, the essential role of the environment in controlling tissue-specific macrophage identities cannot be dismissed as highlighted in recent epigenetics studies (<a href=\"#bib21\">Gosselin et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Lavin et al., 2014</a>)."

Conversely, we observed that the rate of wound closure was neither affected in the <i>Ccr2</i><sup>-/-</sup> animals (as previously reported by <a href=\"#bib62\">Willenborg et al., 2012</a>) nor in chimeric <i>Ccr2</i><sup>-/-</sup>/<i>Ccr2</i><sup>+/+</sup> mice, indicating that infiltrating monocytes and radiosensitive tissue-resident macrophages could be mostly dispensable for the reparative phase of the healing process in the skin. Thus, the coexistence of macrophage subsets performing non-redundant roles in homeostatic skin highlights the need of maintaining equilibrium between both pools to preserve the skin fitness. The lack of functional redundancy could be of clinical significance, and may contribute to better understand concomitant skin pathologies arising from radio-induced bone marrow ablation therapies and certain inflammatory skin disorders, particularly those aggravated with age."

Details of the generation and characterization of the gene-targeted mouse expressing VE-cadherin-\u03b1-catenin protein can be found in (<a href=\"#bib52\">Schulte et al., 2011</a>). Inducible <i>Bmi1</i>-IRES-Cre-ERT2 Rosa26 YFP mice were generated by crossing the <i>Bmi1</i><sup>CreER/+</sup> strain (<a href=\"#bib51\">Sangiorgi and Capecchi, 2008</a>) with Rosa26<sup>YFP/+</sup> reporter mice. <i>Bmi1</i>-IRES-Cre-ERT2 Rosa26 YFP double heterozygous mice were injected with tamoxifen 5d prior to analysis. Tamoxifen (Sigma-Aldrich [St Louis, MO]) was dissolved in corn oil (Sigma-Aldrich) to a final concentration of 20 mg/ml, and mice were i.p. injected every 24\u2009hr on three consecutive days with tamoxifen at a concentration of 9 mg per 40\u2009g body weight. The nestin-eGFP reporter strain was a kind gift from Dr. G. Enikolopov (<a href=\"#bib43\">Mignone et al., 2004</a>). DPE-GFP mice were generated as described in (<a href=\"#bib41\">Mempel et al., 2006</a>). <i>Langerin</i>-eGFP, <i>Cx3cr1</i>-GFP, <i>Lyz2</i>-Cre:Rosa26YFP and <i>Ccr2</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice were kindly provided by Dr. B. Malissen, Dr A. Hidalgo, Dr. M. Ricote and Dr. C. Ardavin, respectively. Mice were kept in pathogen-free conditions in the CNIC Animal Unit, Madrid. Animal studies were approved by the local ethics committee and by the Division of Animal Protection of Comunidad de Madrid (approved protocols PROEX 159/15 and 160/15). All animal procedures conformed to EU Directive 2010/63EU and Recommendation 2007/526/EC regarding the protection of animals used for experimental and other scientific purposes, enforced in Spanish law under Real Decreto 1201/2005."

Non-invasive intravital imaging procedures were carried out in a thermostatic chamber at 37\u00baC. For short-term studies (1\u20132\u00a0hr), animals were first anesthetized by i.p. injection of ketamine (50\u00a0mg/kg), xylazine (10\u00a0mg/kg), and acepromazine (1.7 mg/kg), and repeated half-doses were administered when needed over the course of the experiments. For long-term studies (time-lapse imaging &gt; 2\u00a0hr), animals were first anesthetized by i.p. injection of urethane (1.2 gr/kg) dissolved in PBS, followed by s.c. injection of 1/10 of the initial dose dissolved in 200\u2009\u03bcl PBS for rehydration after several hours.

The resulting reads were mapped on the mouse transcriptome (Ensembl gene-build GRCm38.v70) and genome, using RSEM v1.2.3 (<a href=\"#bib37\">Li and Dewey, 2011</a>) and Bowtie2 v2.0.6 (<a href=\"#bib34\">Langmead and Salzberg, 2012</a>), respectively. The observation that a significant fraction of reads could be mapped on the genome, but not on the transcriptome, in close proximity to dA/dT-rich sequences, suggested that traces of contaminant genomic DNA could have been artifactually amplified by poly\u00a0(A) priming. To avoid overestimation of transcript read counts, read clusters mapped on the genome at less than 50 bp downstream of dT-rich or upstream dA-rich regions were discarded. Filtered reads were mapped again on the transcriptome, and quantified, with RSEM. Only genes with at least 2 counts per million in at least 2 samples were considered for statistical analysis. Data were then normalized and differential expression tested using the Bioconductor package EdgeR (<a href=\"#bib49\">Robinson et al., 2010</a>). Hierarchical Clustering was run using Genesis Software (<a href=\"#bib57\">Sturn et al., 2002</a>) on the normalized expression profiles of the subset of genes with a p-value smaller than 0.05 and similar behavior in the two replicates of each cell type.

It would be useful if the manuscript could be revised to reflect the complex functional landscape of macrophages.</i>"

As our study has been made with macrophage subsets isolated under steady-state conditions, we have avoided the use of such M1/M2 nomenclature. The distinction of skin-resident macrophage subsets harboring pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory potential in steady-state was attained by combining not only the RNASeq analysis (metabolic programming), but the immune transcriptional profile and the expression of standard phenotypic markers. In addition, the ex vivostimulation with LPS and IL-4 was performed to evaluate the plasticity of STREAMs. In fact, following the interesting comment raised by the reviewer, we now show that STREAMs produce IL-10 after IL-4 stimulation (new <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>), demonstrating that they are responsive to an anti-inflammatory stimulus but refractory to a pro- inflammatory challenge (LPS). These results further emphasize the lack of plasticity of STREAMs and their anti-inflammatory commitment already in steady-state."

Thus, we have found a binary distinction between radio-resistant anti-inflammatory and radio-sensitive pro-inflammatory macrophages, but we cannot rule out the existence of more heterogeneity and complexity within each subset. All these issues have been clarified throughout the text to better reflect the complex functional landscape of macrophages."

In that manner, STREAMs were the only skin macrophages that could get access and capture circulating DT-OVA-NP, becoming poisoned after ingestion and being selectively depleted (explained in the subsection \u201cSelective depletion of STREAMs impairs skin repair\u201d, second paragraph)."

However, the elucidation of this function deserves much further characterization and should be considered as a complete new piece of work."

For this reason, we have performed and present for the reviewers an immunofluorescence analysis of human skin sections stained for CD31 (red, vasculature) and CD163 (green, macrophage marker widely used in human samples \u2013 CD163: A Specific Marker of Macrophages in Paraffin-Embedded Tissue Samples.

The perivascular CD163<sup>+</sup> macrophages in close contact to endothelial cells, some of them even protruding with cellular projections into the endothelial layer, have been highlighted in white boxes. This is a correlation with our observations made in the mouse model, but due to the inability to perform further functional analyses in human skin we cannot unequivocally conclude that these cells are the human homologues of STREAMs."
