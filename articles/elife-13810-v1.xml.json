Here we show that PCs use a multiplexed spike code. Synchrony/spike time and firing rate encode different information in behaving monkeys during saccadic eye motion tasks. Using the local field potential (LFP) as a probe of local network activity, we found that infrequent pause spikes, which initiated or terminated intermittent pauses in simple spike trains, provide a temporally reliable signal for eye motion onset, with strong phase-coupling to the \u03b2/\u03b3 band LFP. Concurrently, regularly firing, non-pause spikes were weakly correlated with the LFP, but were crucial to linear encoding of eye movement kinematics by firing rate. Therefore, PC spike trains can simultaneously convey information necessary to achieve precision in both timing and continuous control of motion."

Here we show that PCs use a multiplexed spike code. Synchrony/spike time and firing rate encode different information in behaving monkeys during saccadic eye motion tasks. Using the local field potential (LFP) as a probe of local network activity, we found that infrequent pause spikes, which initiated or terminated intermittent pauses in simple spike trains, provide a temporally reliable signal for eye motion onset, with strong phase-coupling to the \u03b2/\u03b3 band LFP. Concurrently, regularly firing, non-pause spikes were weakly correlated with the LFP, but were crucial to linear encoding of eye movement kinematics by firing rate. Therefore, PC spike trains can simultaneously convey information necessary to achieve precision in both timing and continuous control of motion."

The pauses were accompanied by a sharp change in the local field potential, another electrical signal that comes from many neurons in the neighborhood. In the same cells, the rate of regularly firing spikes increased and decreased with the direction and speed of eye movements, following a simple relationship and independently of the local field potential."

The cerebellum is heavily involved in online motor control and should process sensorimotor information with great accuracy. In particular, PCs, which deliver the final output from the cerebellar cortex, should use an appropriate coding strategy for this task, but the nature of their coding mechanism is actively debated (<a href=\"#bib10\">De Zeeuw et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Heck et al., 2013</a>). In one view, transmission of timing-sensitive information is performed by precisely timed PC spikes and their synchronized firing (<a href=\"#bib14\">Ebner and Bloedel, 1981</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Gauck and Jaeger, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Shin and De Schutter, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">de Solages et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">De Zeeuw et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Person and Raman, 2012</a>). In the other, PCs use <i>linear</i> firing-rate coding with weak PC-to-PC correlations to robustly control continuous movement kinematics, where high signal-to-noise ratio is achieved by averaging the rates of many PCs (<a href=\"#bib44\">Shidara et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Thier et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Roitman et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Medina and Lisberger, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Catz et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Herzfeld et al., 2015</a>)."

We classified PC spikes into specific spike categories, and correlated spike categories with the LFP, using the LFP as a proxy signal for local network activity. In particular, we focused on the role of long, infrequent interspike intervals (ISI), called pauses, which abruptly interrupt the rapid and very regular firing of PCs (<a href=\"#bib43\">Schonewille et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Shin and De Schutter, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Shin et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Yartsev et al., 2009</a>). Pauses in the PC spike train are a well-known phenomenon in many contexts, such as saccades (<a href=\"#bib33\">Ohtsuka and Noda, 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Arnstein et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Herzfeld et al., 2015</a>), and classical conditioning (<a href=\"#bib37\">Rasmussen et al., 2008</a>), etc. Spikes that initiate and terminate pauses often synchronize sharply across nearby PCs (<a href=\"#bib45\">Shin and De Schutter, 2006</a>).

To estimate how reliably spikes fired at certain LFP phases, we computed the pairwise phase consistency (PPC), which is an average coincidence between any two spikes in the LFP phase space (see Materials and methods for more details) and provides an unbiased measure of phase locking (<a href=\"#bib52\">Vinck et al., 2010</a>).

The most significant pattern that we observed was that pause-initiating spikes encode saccade onsets with a significant and sharp increase in average firing (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This could be caused either by a firing rate increase of pause spikes during some saccades, or by a sharp spike-time correlation across most saccade trials, i.e. reliable spiking. To ascertain which, we estimated how many spike coincidence events occurred beyond the prediction from the firing rate, from all possible pairings of spike trains and saccades, which we called the spike reliability: Briefly, for each pair of saccade trials, we counted spike coincidences\u00a0(|<i>\u0394t</i>|\u22643 ms)\u00a0between two spike trains within a 50 ms-long moving time window, centered at <i>t</i> (\u2212100 ms \u2264<i>t</i>\u2264150 ms, relative to saccade onset). Then we estimated the probability, <i>jp</i>(<i>t</i>), that two random spike trains with the same firing rates could have the same or more spike coincidences, looking for significant ones (<i>jp</i>(<i>t</i>)&lt;0.05) (<a href=\"#bib39\">Riehle et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Denker et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Ito et al., 2011</a>). The fraction of those significant coincidences from all cells, summed over all trials and time, became the spike reliability. Significantly coincident spikes were indeed found during significant peaks of firing probability (colored regions in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>); therefore, spike reliability was significantly higher for pause spikes (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>), further emphasizing their role in encoding the onset of eye motion. Finally, the LFP phase and spike reliability were much more steeply related to each other for pause-initiating spikes than for regular spikes (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). This demonstrates that the fidelity of temporal coding by pauses in individual PCs crucially reflects the reliability of activity and coding of the local network."

This study presents the first evidence for multiplexed coding in cerebellar Purkinje cells. Specifically, spikes that initiate pauses are strongly coupled to the \u03b2/\u03b3 band of the LFP and are therefore probably synchronized among nearby PCs. These spikes form a temporally reliable signal to initiate saccadic eye motion. Conversely, regular spikes in the same spike trains are desynchronized among nearby PCs and form a rate code that predicts direction selective eye kinematics. Use of a multiplexed code resolves the perceived contradiction between temporal and rate coding that has dominated recent discussions about PC spiking (<a href=\"#bib10\">De Zeeuw et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Heck et al., 2013</a>)."

In striatal cholinergic interneurons, synchronized pauses after bursts encode a salient stimulus (<a href=\"#bib1\">Aosaki et al., 1995</a>). Since pause-initiating and -terminating spikes can synchronize sharply (<a href=\"#bib22\">Jaeger, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Shin and De Schutter, 2006</a>), PCs can potentially operate by a similar coding mechanism. In fact, spike synchronization by PCs is a powerful mechanism to control their postsynaptic targets in the cerebellar nucleus (CN). With exceptionally fast GABAergic synapses (<a href=\"#bib35\">Person and Raman, 2012</a>), CN neurons can reliably generate time-locked rebound spikes in response to synchronized inputs followed by simultaneous disinhibition, even at moderate levels of synchrony (\u226450%) (<a href=\"#bib35\">Person and Raman, 2012</a>) and spike time jitter (\u226420 ms) (<a href=\"#bib15\">Gauck and Jaeger, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Sudhakar et al., 2015</a>). Furthermore, recent optogenetic experiments have shown that synchronous pauses induced either by direct/indirect inhibition or at the offset of direct excitation, can reliably trigger firing in CN neurons, and importantly, at movement onset (<a href=\"#bib19\">Heiney et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Lee et al., 2015</a>). Crucially, excitation-induced pauses were short (~35 ms), but effective, and even shorter pauses from direct inhibition caused similar effects (<a href=\"#bib25\">Lee et al., 2015</a>)."

Previous studies have analyzed PC firing collected over many trials and neurons, and found that a collective representation of time and motion emerges as a form of burst firing alone (<a href=\"#bib49\">Thier et al., 2000</a>) or together with suppressed/paused firing of many PCs (<a href=\"#bib5\">Catz et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Arnstein et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Herzfeld et al., 2015</a>). Our results suggest that pause spikes can enhance temporal fidelity of such population-level representations since their temporal consistency across different PCs (e.g. <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>) can offer a reliable representation, despite large heterogeneity in rate coding schemes of different PCs. For example, <a href=\"#bib20\">Herzfeld et al. (2015)</a> found that population PC coding of saccade direction depends critically on the timing of pause onset, which varies only up to ~10 ms. Here we showed that pause spikes of individual PCs can indeed fire with a reliability of a few milliseconds. This can be particularly important at the single trial/saccade level, but averaging over multiple trials and cells may not be a suitable approach to probe it. Instead, we evaluated the correlation between simultaneously recorded PC spikes and LFP, and also trial-to-trial correlation (reliability) of those signals, for each cell. Our results show that synchronized pause spikes constitute the most significant population signal in PCs despite their sparse appearance in individual spike trains, suggesting that they can be a specific signaling mechanism in the PC-CN part of the motor pathway."

However, there are multiple possible primary sources. One is the dense activation of mossy fibers and granule cells that accompanies the significant LFP in the granular layer (<a href=\"#bib31\">Morissette and Bower, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Roggeri et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Diwakar et al., 2011</a>). Because our electrodes are probably too far from the granular layer to detect the signal directly, it is likely that that localized massive activity propagates via ascending and parallel fibers to activate many interneurons and ultimately PCs. In particular, molecular layer interneurons (MLI) could provide significant feedforward inhibition (<a href=\"#bib30\">Mittmann et al., 2005</a>), causing PCs to pause (<a href=\"#bib29\">Mittmann and H\u00e4usser, 2007</a>). If simultaneous activation of local MLIs (and/or their synaptic inputs to the local population of PCs) contributes to the LFP, this would explain our observed correlation of the fast LFP signal and pauses in PCs. However, the time-encoding signal components we observed seem to be highly localized in the cerebellar cortex. In LFPs recorded ~1\u2009mm horizontally from the spike electrode, STA<sub>LFP</sub> amplitude, particularly of pause spikes was greatly diminished to absent (<a href=\"#fig3s4\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). This suggests that the pause-related \u03b2/\u03b3 LFP signal originates from localized sources and decays quickly with distance, spreading at most a few hundred microns.

Our findings are consistent with their observations since pause spikes, which fire reliably with respect to motion onset, have higher ISI variability, and significant coupling to the LFP implies correlated firing.

[\u2026] then removed 25% of the spikes with the shortest pause ISI.\" Since this process operates on ISI ratios, it is unclear what the ISI durations are that are being analyzed as pauses. Moreover, because this analysis relies on ratios and not overall ISI duration, (which would seem a more natural criterion for long ISIs), it is selecting for essentially bursty sequences of short-then-longish spikes. Interpreting the data through this light seems different than interpreting it through the lens of 'pauses' or longest ISIs. While I acknowledge that there may be no perfect solution to identifying pauses, I am not provided enough information to evaluate their claims because I don't know if the pauses they have chosen are unique in any way, or are alternatively unique in ways they do not highlight. In addition to the distribution of 'pause' ISIs vs. all ISIs, a plot of ISI<sub>n</sub> vs. ISI<sub>n+1</sub> would provide non-ratioed data that may help reveal unique characteristics of the 'pause' population."

I am not confident that any data analysis short of multi single-unit array recordings could resolve whether single spikes are temporally aligned at the onset of a pause to the degree necessary for synchrony coding in the nuclei, but I could be persuaded by experts of LFP interpretation."

Therefore, many complex spikes had smaller AI than the thresholds. Second, durations of complex-spike pauses did not increase as rapidly as those of simple spike pauses with the asymmetry index. In all the cells, the correlation between AI and log<sub>10</sub>(ISI) was significantly larger for simple spikes than complex spikes (complex: 0.24 \u00b1 0.15, simple: 0.66 \u00b1 0.03, p = 2.84 \u00d7 10<sup>-12</sup>, Wilcoxon rank-sum test), which made the complex-spikes pauses poorly predicted by the asymmetry index.

The contribution of other cells, providing inputs to the Purkinje neurons, could also be substantial. Therefore, we instead argue that Purkinje cell pausing reflects this temporary, sharp, circuit-wide activity and that accordingly, synchrony of pause spikes may be a part of it. Previous studies observed similar LFP phenomena in the granular layer (Morisette and Bower, Exp Brain Res, 1996; Roggeri et al., J Neurosci 2008), which seems to arise from dense synchronous activation of granule cells (Diwakar et al., PLOS One 2011). We do not have any means to probe whether our LFP signal was conducted from the granular layer, but even if not, we think it is likely that such a synchronous activation of mossy fibers and granule cells could spread to many cells, including molecular layer interneurons and ultimately Purkinje cells. Strong activation of interneurons will provide feedforward inhibition to Purkinje cells (Mittmann et al., J Physiol, 2004). This inhibition can cause simple-spike pausing (Mittmann and H\u00e4usser, J Neurosci, 2007) while significantly contributing to the LFP signal."

For example, there is no discrete transition between the regular ISI and longer pauses, but they form a unimodal distribution with a long tail (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a> in the manuscript). The reliability of pause spikes in encoding saccade onset is not distinguishably higher than that of regular spikes in some PCs, but it varies with LFP reliability (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). We believe that for efficient multiplexing it may be beneficial if a population of PCs differ in the degree to which each behavior is expressed. This should be more advantageous in encoding eye motion since there is a continuous gradient from short and tiny to long and large saccadic eye motion.

The experimental systems used by the authors (cerebellum and saccadic eye movements) offer some powerful advantages for analyzing this issue. The manuscript builds on the De Schutter group's previous work suggesting that brief, synchronized pauses in Purkinje cell firing may play a key role in cerebellar function. The current manuscript expands significantly on what had been done previously by 1) building a tighter link to behavior by examining pauses in the context of saccadic eye movement behavior and 2) examining the relationship between the LFP and the spikes bounding the pause.</i>"

There are some important missing pieces of information, however, that make evaluating the findings challenging and therefore a strong recommendation for accepting or rejecting the manuscript is premature. Of paramount importance is the selection of spikes beginning long pauses: \"we selected 15% of largest AI values.[\u2026] then removed 25% of the spikes with the shortest pause ISI.\" Since this process operates on ISI ratios, it is unclear what the ISI durations are that are being analyzed as pauses. Moreover, because this analysis relies on ratios and not overall ISI duration, (which would seem a more natural criterion for long ISIs), it is selecting for essentially bursty sequences of short-then-longish spikes. Interpreting the data through this light seems different than interpreting it through the lens of 'pauses' or longest ISIs. While I acknowledge that there may be no perfect solution to identifying pauses, I am not provided enough information to evaluate their claims because I don't know if the pauses they have chosen are unique in any way, or are alternatively unique in ways they do not highlight. In addition to the distribution of 'pause' ISIs vs. all ISIs, a plot of ISI<sub>n</sub> vs. ISI<sub>n+1</sub> would provide non-ratioed data that may help reveal unique characteristics of the 'pause' population.</i>"

Long pauses that follow short ISI are also likely to release cerebellar nucleus neurons from inhibition, which has been shown to encode motion onsets (e.g., Lee et al., Neuron, 2015)."
