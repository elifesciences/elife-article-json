In mammals, most organ-specific N-glycosylation events occur in the brain. Yet, little is known about the nature, function and regulation of N-glycosylation in neurons. Using imaging, quantitative immunoblotting and mass spectrometry, we show that hundreds of neuronal surface membrane proteins are core-glycosylated, resulting in the neuronal membrane displaying surprisingly high levels of glycosylation profiles that are classically associated with immature intracellular proteins. We report that while N-glycosylation is generally required for dendritic development and glutamate receptor surface expression, core-glycosylated proteins are sufficient to sustain these processes, and are thus functional. This atypical glycosylation of surface neuronal proteins can be attributed to a bypass or a hypo-function of the Golgi apparatus. Core-glycosylation is regulated by synaptic activity, modulates synaptic signaling and accelerates the turnover of GluA2-containing glutamate receptors, revealing a novel mechanism that controls the composition and sensing properties of the neuronal membrane."

In mammals, most organ-specific N-glycosylation events occur in the brain. Yet, little is known about the nature, function and regulation of N-glycosylation in neurons. Using imaging, quantitative immunoblotting and mass spectrometry, we show that hundreds of neuronal surface membrane proteins are core-glycosylated, resulting in the neuronal membrane displaying surprisingly high levels of glycosylation profiles that are classically associated with immature intracellular proteins. We report that while N-glycosylation is generally required for dendritic development and glutamate receptor surface expression, core-glycosylated proteins are sufficient to sustain these processes, and are thus functional. This atypical glycosylation of surface neuronal proteins can be attributed to a bypass or a hypo-function of the Golgi apparatus. Core-glycosylation is regulated by synaptic activity, modulates synaptic signaling and accelerates the turnover of GluA2-containing glutamate receptors, revealing a novel mechanism that controls the composition and sensing properties of the neuronal membrane."

The ability of neurons to communicate with each other relies on many proteins that are found on the surfaces of the cells. Like in all animal cells, surface proteins are made inside the cell in a compartment called the endoplasmic reticulum. During this process, one or several complex sugar molecules are usually added to newly made proteins. These sugar molecules are then modified as the proteins leave the endoplasmic reticulum and pass through another compartment called the Golgi apparatus on the way to the cell membrane. The precise number and structure of the sugar molecules attached to the protein define its glycosylation profile."

During this process, as nascent proteins emerge in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), a mannose-rich precursor is first transferred <i>en bloc</i> to specific aspargine residues. These immature 'core-glycans' are then trimmed down and modified by the sequential addition of diverse monosaccharides as proteins exit the ER and progress through the Golgi apparatus before they are sent to their final destination (<a href=\"#bib41\">Moremen et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Aebi et al., 2010</a>). This sequential and combinatorial modification results in a huge potential diversity of N-glycans and regulates virtually every aspect of membrane protein biology, in particular protein folding, trafficking, stability, ligand-binding and interaction with the extracellular matrix (<a href=\"#bib41\">Moremen et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Aebi et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Scott and Panin, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Miller and Aricescu, 2014</a>). Consequently, congenital N-glycosylation defects, especially in the brain, result in severe and often lethal developmental disorders (<a href=\"#bib8\">Cylwik et al., 2013</a>). Although the primary organelles of the secretory pathway were first described in neurons (<a href=\"#bib17\">Golgi, 1989</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Nissl, 1903</a>), little is known about the N-glycosylation of neuronal membrane proteins."

Yet, how dendritic secretory cargo is processed after local synthesis is still debated. In mammals, neuronal dendrites contain ER, ER-exit sites and ER-Golgi intermediate compartments (ERGIC) and occasionally Golgi outposts, but, for the most part lack canonical Golgi membranes (<a href=\"#bib60\">Torre and Steward, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Gardiol et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Krijnse-Locker et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Horton and Ehlers, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Hanus and Ehlers, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Cui-Wang et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Hanus et al., 2014</a>). It is thus conceivable that, depending on their synthesis in the soma or dendrites, nascent cargo visits distinct sets of secretory subcompartments, and hence acquire specific types of N-glycans. For example, it is believed that nascent neurotransmitter receptors may follow multiple and specific secretory itineraries (<a href=\"#bib31\">Jeyifous et al., 2009</a>), but whether this impacts their glycosylation is unknown."

We found that while N-glycosylation is generally required for the proper expression of membrane proteins at the neuronal surface, 'immature' core-glycosylated proteins are sufficient to sustain dendritic development and synaptic transmission, indicating that these proteins are fully functional. Focusing on candidate neurotransmitter receptors and auxiliary subunits, we show that core-glycosylated proteins access the cell-surface in a Golgi-independent manner indicating a bypass or a hypo-function of the Golgi apparatus. This atypical N-glycosylation results in an accelerated turnover of membrane proteins and modulates synaptic signaling, revealing a novel mechanism controlling membrane protein homeostasis and function in morphologically complex cells such as neurons."

To compare the surface levels of these three generic N-glycan types in neurons to non-neuronal cells, we labeled mixed (neuron-glia) hippocampal cultures and 3 commonly used cell-lines (COS7, BHK and CHO) with different lectin biotin-conjugates under non-permeabilizing conditions. As expected, all cell types examined (including neurons and glia) displayed both hybrid and complex N-glycans (labeled by RCA and WGA, respectively) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Surprisingly, however, mature neurons (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) also displayed a high level of core-glycosylated N-glycans (strongly labeled by ConA and GNA) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). This observation was reinforced by the comparison of neurons and several other cell types: only neurons showed a prominent surface labeling by ConA and GNA, confirming high levels of core-glycosylated proteins at the neuronal plasma membrane (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>)."

                                "text": "Where are core-glycosylated proteins localized in the neuronal plasma membrane? To address this, we imunolabeled synapses with the presynaptic marker protein bassoon after surface labeling with ConA. Core N-glycans were distributed throughout the entire neuronal surface but were particularly abundant at synapses, notably in dendritic spines (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). To examine whether synaptic proteins themselves displayed core-glycosylation profiles, we assessed the glycosylation status of a cast of key synaptic proteins using their electrophoretic profiles after digestion by PNGase and EndoH, to identify core-glycosylated (EndoH-sensitive) proteins among the family of N-glycosylated (PNGase-sensitive) surface molecules (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). We found that a substantial fraction of purified surface GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor or AMPA-type and NMDA-type glutamate receptor subunits were core-glycosylated (EndoH-sensitive) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). More specifically, these proteins were either entirely core-glycosylated (e.g. GluN1 and GABA<sub>A</sub>R \u03b23), partially core-glycosylated (i.e. displayed both mature and core-glycosylated glycans on the same polypeptide chain, such as GluA1, and GluN2B) or were expressed as a mixture of proteins with either core-glycosylated or mature N-glycans (e.g. GluA2, GluA4). We note that while there are few reports of core-glycosylated sugars on functional proteins (<a href=\"#bib27\">Hirayama et al., 2016</a>), these are typically associated with a few, select glycosylation sites thought to be inaccessible to Golgi enzymes. In contrast, here we show that all of the glycosylated sites of GluN1 (an obligatory subunit of NMDA receptors with 10 predicted N-glycosylation sites), GluA2 and GluA3 (4 predicted sites) are core-glycosylated. In contrast, TARP \u03b38, an AMPA receptor auxiliary protein that is thought to be co-trafficked with nascent receptors in the secretory pathway (<a href=\"#bib59\">Tomita et al., 2003</a>) was completely insensitive to EndoH (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>) as is expected for a typical mature surface glycoprotein in non-neuronal cells (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Similarly, the synaptic adhesion protein Neuroligin 1 (NLG1, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>) was also completely insensitive to EndoH. These results strongly indicate that synaptic proteins and receptors are processed and trafficked to the cell-surface through distinct mechanisms / secretory routes: a classical pathway that generates glycoproteins with mature N-glycans (e.g. TARP \u03b38 and NLG1), which in some instances are detected together with core-glycosylated sites on the same polypeptide (e.g. GluA1), as well as an unconventional route that generates proteins with only core-glycosylated profiles (e.g. GluN1 and GABA<sub>A</sub>R \u03b23)."

To assess whether ConA and EndoH might interact with the same proteins in neurons, we devised a two-round purification strategy to assess the EndoH-sensitivity of surface proteins interacting with ConA (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). Consistent with their respective electrophoretic profiles after deglycosylation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>), GluN1 and GluA2 were purified based on their interaction with ConA, whereas TARP \u03b38 was not detected (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). As expected, the binding of surface GluN1 and GluA2 to ConA was abolished by competition with free mannose (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Finally we observed that prior digestion with EndoH also blocked GluA2 and GluN1 binding to ConA (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>), thus demonstrating that in hippocampal neurons, the binding of surface membrane proteins to ConA and their sensitivity to EndoH are equivalent. Thus EndoH-sensitive proteins \u2013 proteins that are classically regarded as intracellular and immature - are abundant at the neuronal surface."

To determine whether core-glycosylation is limited to a small set of neuronal surface proteins or represents a more widespread phenomenon, we used high-resolution mass spectrometry to identify neuronal surface proteins that interact with ConA (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A,E and F</a>). To increase the specificity of our detection and obtain a high-confidence dataset, we used a label-free quantification (LFQ) approach to identify proteins that were consistently detected across experiments and whose binding to ConA was impaired by EndoH. In brief, plasma membrane proteins were first isolated after surface biotinylation and affinity purified with ConA, after ('background' control group) or without prior treatment with EndoH (target 'core-glycosylated' group). Purified proteins were fragmented with proteases and the resulting peptides were separated by HPLC, ionized and subjected to LFQ and fingerprinting by mass spectrometry. Surface core-glycosylated proteins were identified by focusing the analysis on peptides that showed the highest reproducibility and enrichment in the target group (see Materials and methods and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

To address whether the presence of core-glycans at the neuronal membrane is specific to a particular developmental stage, we examined the relative surface expression of core and hybrid N-glycans throughout neuronal and synaptic development (over a nine week time-course). We found that while the surface expression of core-glycans remains constant, the surface expression of hybrid glycans progressively increases as neurons mature (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>), documenting a development-dependent regulation of neuron surface N-glycosylation. We next examined the dependence of dendritic development on N-glycans by treatment with tunicamycin (Tm), a drug that completely blocks all N-glycosylation by preventing the transfer of the N-glycan precursor to target proteins in the ER (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Dendritic growth and complexity were assessed by performing a Sholl analysis (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>) or by quantifying the total dendritic length and number of tips (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). As shown in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>, we found that dendritic growth was severely impaired by a global blockade of N-glycosylation. To distinguish the contributions of mature vs. immature glycans to dendritic growth we used swainsonine (Sw), a selective blocker of Golgi type-II mannosidase Man2b1 and Man2b2 (<a href=\"#bib64\">Tulsiani et al., 1982</a>), the enzymes that convert EndoH-sensitive proteins into EndoH-resistant species (a prerequisite for their subsequent maturation), and two other mannosidase inhibitors: kifunensine (Kf) and deoxymannojirimycin (DMJ) which inhibit ER or Golgi mannosidases acting upstream of Man2b1/Man2b2 (<a href=\"#bib26\">Herscovics, 1999</a>) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Surprisingly, we found that the immature N-glycans that remain following treatment with Kf, DMJ or Sw were sufficient to initiate and maintain dendritic growth (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C\u2013D</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). To verify that these drugs had the expected effects on the surface expression of specific N-glycan subtypes, we assessed the surface expression of core, hybrid and complex glycans by far-western blotting (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). As expected, Kf, DMJ and Sw increased the surface levels of core-glycans while decreasing the levels of hybrid and, at least for Kf and DMJ, complex glycans. Thus, while N-glycosylation is necessary for dendritic development and maintenance, 'immature' N-glycans are sufficient to sustain these processes, which indicates that core-glycosylated proteins on the neuronal membrane surface are fully functional."

In contrast in COS cells, BFA had no effect on intracellular proteins but markedly reduced the levels of nascent proteins at the plasma membrane (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>), as also observed for other cell types (<a href=\"#bib9\">Davis and Mecham, 1996</a>). Thus, while BFA strongly reduced secretory trafficking in COS 7 cells, it had no detectable effect on the accumulation of nascent proteins at the neuronal surface under these experimental conditions (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). We cannot rule out that BFA impairs secretory trafficking in neurons but that our method is not sensitive enough to detect this effect. Yet, our results indicate that secretory trafficking in neurons is markedly less dependent on the Golgi apparatus (GA) than in other cell types, providing an explanation for the atypical prominence of core-glycosylated proteins at the neuronal surface."

To address this, we chose GluN1, GluA2 and TARP \u03b38 because of their physiological relevance and their respective complete, mixed (co-existence of EndoH sensitive and insensitive species) or absent core-glycosylation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). We found that exposure to BFA (5\u00a0\u03bcg/mL; 6\u20137\u2009hr) significantly reduced the surface expression of TARP \u03b38 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D,E</a>)\u2013 as expected for a typical mature N-glycan (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). The surface expression of GluA2 was also reduced by BFA, albeit to a lesser extent (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). In contrast, the surface expression of GluN1 - a protein whose full surface complement is core-glycosylated \u2013 was insensitive to Golgi disruption (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). Interestingly, the sensitivity to EndoH of these proteins was inversely correlated with their sensitivity to Golgi-disruption (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). Importantly, as proteins with a faster turnover can be expected to respond more quickly to disruption of their biosynthetic pathway, protein stability must be taken into account in interpreting these results. We note, however, that previous studies have shown that GluA2 has a\u00a0slower turnover (t<sub>1/2</sub> 1.95 days) than GluN1 (t<sub>1/2</sub> 1.61 days)\u00a0(<a href=\"#bib25\">Hanus and Schuman, 2013</a>), which indicates that the differential sensitivity of GluA2 and GluN1 to BFA cannot be accounted for by differences in stability.

Together with the relative paucity of canonical Golgi membranes as compared to other components of the secretory pathway in dendrites (<a href=\"#bib23\">Hanus and Ehlers, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Hanus et al., 2014</a>), the abundance of core-glycosylated proteins at the neuronal surface suggests that Golgi-by pass is surprisingly common for neuronal membrane proteins (<a href=\"#bib60\">Torre and Steward, 1996</a>)."

To determine whether this was indeed the case, we used the glycosylation inhibitors described above to determine which glycosylation step(s) are required for the surface expression of GluA2. We found that whereas blocking N-glycosylation entirely with Tm markedly reduced GluA2 surface expression (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), blocking the maturation of core-glycans with Kf, DMJ or Sw had no detectable effect on GluA2 surface levels, despite clear effects (at least for Kf and Sw) on the glycosylation profile of the protein (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

As a first step towards addressing this, we determined whether Kf, which inhibits processing beyond core-glycans, alters postsynaptic signaling by combining local glutamate uncaging and calcium imaging. We focused on AMPA-dependent signaling by monitoring postsynaptic calcium responses elicited by repetitive glutamate uncaging (~25 stimuli at ~2.5\u2009Hz) in the presence of AP5 (an NMDA receptor blocker)\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C\u2013G</a>). This stimulation induced strong postsynaptic responses, which were completely blocked by the AMPA/kainate receptor blocker CNQX (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D,E</a>). In blind recordings and analyses, we compared the responses of Kf-treated (for 48\u2009hr prior to recording) and control neurons and discovered that, on average, the Kf-treated neurons exhibited responses with a shorter time to peak and a slight trend towards a larger decay (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7F</a>; <a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure\u00a0supplement 2</a>). It will be important for future studies to address how these parameters are mechanistically linked to increased core-glycosylation as multiple proteins including voltage-dependent calcium channels, calcium pumps and binding proteins (<a href=\"#bib48\">Rose and Konnerth, 2001</a>) might be involve in shaping the intracellular calcium responses induced by AMPA receptor activation and postsynaptic depolarization. Nevertheless, our results show that core-glycosylation is sufficient to maintain normal synaptic transmission and may regulate the kinetics and magnitude of postsynaptic signaling."

Its presence or absence in synaptic receptor complexes is highly regulated, notably by protein synthesis (<a href=\"#bib36\">Mameli et al., 2007</a>). We thus took advantage of the co-existence of standard (mature N-glycans) and core-glycosylated GluA2 subunits at the neuronal surface to directly compare the turnover of two distinct glycosylated forms of a well-studied and functionally important synaptic protein. Because the overall lifetime of a protein is a key determinant of how fast and by which mechanisms its levels can be tuned in a compartment specific manner (<a href=\"#bib25\">Hanus and Schuman, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">O'Leary et al., 2013</a>), we compared the stability of core-glycosylated and mature glycosylated GluA2 with a chase assay after surface biotinylation (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A\u2013C</a>). The two forms of the protein were quantified by immunoblotting after separation by treatment with EndoH. Consistent with values measured for GluA1 in spinal cord neurons (<a href=\"#bib37\">Mammen et al., 1997</a>), the overall stability of GluA2 (core + standard glycosylated forms) was on the order of tens of hours (15.8 \u00b1 1.5\u2009hr) (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>). However, the core-glycosylated pool of GluA2 exhibited a substantially shorter half-life than the standard form of the protein (3.4 versus 21.1\u2009hr, respectively) (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>), demonstrating an accelerated turnover of the core-glycosylated form of the surface receptor."

This indicates that these proteins are processed by distinct mechanisms and likely use distinct secretory routes (<a href=\"#bib31\">Jeyifous et al., 2009</a>) to reach the plasma membrane. Intriguingly, the complete and selective loss of 'mature' N-glycosylated GluA2/3 in hippocampal neurons of TARP \u03b38 knockout mice results in a relatively modest decrease (34% ) in AMPA excitatory postsynaptic potential amplitude (<a href=\"#bib49\">Rouach et al., 2005</a>). This suggests that core-glycosylated receptors, which account for 33% of total surface receptors, mediate 66% of synaptic transmission, which represents a relative contribution to synaptic currents (and an enrichment at synapses) that is ~4-fold higher. The present study thus challenges the notion that the core-glycosylated GluA2/3 subunits that remain unaltered in the TARP \u03b38 knockout are retained in the ER, and rather indicate that these receptors are localized at synapses and are functional both in wild type and in TARP \u03b38 knockout mice. Similarly, AMPA, kainate and GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors display abnormally increased or decreased EndoH sensitivities in schizophrenic patients (<a href=\"#bib62\">Tucholski et al., 2013a</a>, <a href=\"#bib63\">2013b</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Mueller et al., 2014</a>).

The lifetime of a protein has a critical impact on its regulation in space and time. For example, a synaptic protein that is stable for multiple days has the time to potentially explore multiple synapses and go through several rounds of internalization and recycling before being degraded (<a href=\"#bib11\">Ehlers, 2000</a>). It is thus hard to imagine how the local dendritic synthesis of such a protein could lead to rapid and localized changes of synaptic composition and properties. On the other hand, a protein that is much less stable will likely be more efficiently regulated by a fine-tuning of its local synthesis and degradation. It is thus conceivable that the unconventional glycosylation of key proteins and the resulting decrease of their lifetime may tune the spatial length-scale over which local protein synthesis may functionalize synapses (<a href=\"#bib18\">Govindarajan et al., 2011</a>)."

In a broader context, it is worth noting that N-glycosylation is dysregulated in numerous human pathologies, and in particular in various cancers. Most notably, an increased branching of complex N-glycans is typically associated with a poor prognosis for breast and colon cancers in humans (<a href=\"#bib13\">Fernandes et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Seelentag et al., 1998</a>). Consistently, studies in mice show that Golgi-associated glycosyltransferases such as N-GlcNac, sialyl- and fucosyl-transferases are instrumental to tumor invasiveness (<a href=\"#bib19\">Granovsky et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Tsui et al., 2008</a>). The prevalence of core-glycosylated surface proteins in neurons may thus provide important insights on how N-glycans terminal branching is regulated and can be opposed. The immunological isolation of the brain likely plays a permissive role in surface proteins acquiring atypical glycosylation patterns in neurons, as those may otherwise trigger an immunological response. Indeed, multiple lines of evidence suggest that altered glycosylation profiles are important drivers of autoimmune diseases (<a href=\"#bib46\">Rabinovich et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Maverakis et al., 2015</a>). The enrichment of proteins involved in such pathologies among the core-glycoproteins that we identified thus indicates that investigating core-glycosylation in neurons may provide important cues on autoimmunity."

The efficiency of EndoH was high but not absolute, resulting in B samples consisting of missing values and low-intensity peptides. Although protein abundance was clearly higher in A than in B, this bias (zero values for B sample peptides) complicated the use of average peptide intensities as in a typical LFQ approach. We thus developed a peptide based-strategy and sorted peptides according to their repeatability across experiments (intraclass correlation (ICC) index between biological replicates x ICC index between technical replicates) and their enrichment in A or B: ([average intensity in A \u2013 average intensity in B] / max intensity in A or B). Peptides were then separated by hierarchical clustering based on Euclidian distance (0.2 threshold in the distance matrix). Peptides with the highest enrichment and repeatability were clearly separated as a 'natural' cluster (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), and were used to define our high-confidence 'core-glycosylated' proteins: resulting in the identification of 227 protein groups and 647 protein IDs (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary files 1A and 1C</a>)."

In this study, we can clearly distinguish between these two types of N-glycans: as exemplified in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1A</a> and <a href=\"#fig5\">5A</a>, hybrid N-glycans are typically recognized by RCA. However, as shown in <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>, RCA-binding proteins are EndoH <i>insensitive</i> in hippocampal neurons, in contrast to ConA binding proteins that are EndoH sensitive. Further, as shown in <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>, RCA-reactive proteins respond completely differently from ConA-reactive species to Kf, DMJ and Sw. We cannot exclude that rare hybrid and yet unrecognized glycans that are Endo-H sensitive and selectively bind ConA but not RCA may be found in neurons. Yet, our data strongly indicate that core-glycans are atypically abundant at the neuronal surface."

Neurons possess vastly greater amounts of plasma membrane vs. cell volume than other cells, and significant amounts of the cellular proteins are synthesized in the dendrites, structures containing extensive ER compartment but little to no Golgi membrane compartments. The Authors suggest that neurons may heavily utilize an unconventional protein secretion pathway in which membrane proteins are synthesized in the ER and then trafficked directly to the plasma membrane.

In the majority of studies examining neurite growth in culture, neurons younger neurons DIV1-7 are used to examine the peak of dendrite growth. Could the authors also include data on neurite growth of 8DIV old neurons prior to drug treatment? The examples given for Tm treated neurons look like 1-2DIV neurons with almost no dendrites, far fewer than what would be expected from 8DIV. This suggests that Tm treatment not only prevented neurite outgrowth but caused considerable retraction of dendrites, perhaps due to severe toxicity of Tm treatment. The fact that Kf, Sw, and DMJ did not greatly impair neurite growth (or cause retraction) supports the conclusions of the authors, however, as mentioned above there are no data to show that Kf, Sw, and DMJ are actually effective at limiting mature N-glycosylation.

Cell surface expression will be determined by a combination of the externalization rate, internalization rate and degradation rate. If two proteins are compared that have different half-lives, the one with the shorter half-life will show the greatest reduction when cell surface expression is blocked by any treatment (BFA, cycloheximide, tunicamycin, etc.).

Brefeldin A (BFA) or Kf treatment reduces the expression of surface TARPg8 but not (or less so) for GluA2. Do these treatments result in greater amount of TARPless AMPARs on the surface/ at synapses? The authors could examine the extent of GluA2/TARP interaction using co-immunoprecipitations, with the expectation that CoIP would be reduced following BFA or Kf treatment. Kf treatment did not show any effect on mEPSC amplitude or frequency. If significantly less TARP is expressed on the surface/synapses, then there may be important changes in AMPAR channel properties. The authors could also examine mEPSC decay kinetics or sensitivity of surface AMPAR to different drugs that modify channel properties in a TARP dependent manner.

The false positives included proteins that are not glycoproteins (cytosol, nucleus mitochondria) as well as potential intracellular glycoproteins (ER, Golgi, vacuole) indicating that non-specific binding of proteins to ConA beads was also an issue.

The methods/legend describes that drug treatment began on 8DIV and cells were imaged on 11DIV, this time frame is on the late side to examine neurite growth. In the majority of studies examining neurite growth in culture neurons younger neurons DIV1-7 are used to examine the peak of dendrite growth. Could the authors also include data on neurite growth of 8DIV old neurons prior to drug treatment? The examples given for Tm treated neurons look like 1-2DIV neurons with almost no dendrites, far fewer than what would be expected from 8DIV. This suggests that Tm treatment not only prevented neurite outgrowth but caused considerable retraction of dendrites, perhaps due to severe toxicity of Tm treatment. The fact that Kf, Sw, and DMJ did not greatly impair neurite growth (or cause retraction) supports the conclusions of the authors, however, as mentioned above there is no data to show that Kf, Sw, and DMJ are actually effective at limiting mature N-glycosylation. Lectin labeling and far-Western could be used to show the effectiveness of these drugs."

However, there is almost no data to support this. The authors may wish to limit their conclusions on the functional consequences of core-glycosylation in favor of further characterization of unconventional secretory processing phenomenon, such as during development or by neuronal activity. Alternatively, since the authors specifically address GluA2 and TARPg8 processing these proteins could be further examined to strengthen the functional conclusions of the work. Brefeldin A (BFA) or Kf treatment reduces the expression of surface TARPg8 but not (or less so) for GluA2. Do these treatments result in greater amount of TARPless AMPARs on the surface/ at synapses? The authors could examine the extent of GluA2/TARP interaction using co-immunoprecipitation, with the expectation that CoIP would be reduced following BFA or Kf treatment. Kf treatment did not show any effect on mEPSC amplitude or frequency. If significantly less TARP is expressed on the surface/synapses there may be important changes in AMPAR channel properties. The authors could also examine mEPSC decay kinetics or sensitivity of surface AMPAR to different drugs that modify channel properties in a TARP dependent manner. Does acute loss of surface glycosylation by glycosidase treatment alter synaptic properties?"

This is very interesting data that strengthens this work. However, this is the only data showing that unconventional secretory processing diversifies neuronal ion channel properties. The authors also show using their far-Western method that blocking excitatory synaptic transmission increases the surface abundance of core-glycosylation. Can this result be reproduced using surface lectin staining? Can the authors show that core-glycosylation of GluA2 is also increased by AP5/CNQX treatment? If this is the case than it would also be anticipated that the half-life of GluA2 would be reduced following AP5/CNQX treatment. However, this seems unlikely given that previous studies show that inactivity reduces AMPAR surface turnover (Ehlers, Neuron 2000) and increases AMPAR half-life (O'Brien et al., Neuron 1998).

This result was obtained by surface biotinylation, pulse-chase labeling, affinity purification and mass spectrometry experiments. Although a complete block of N-glycosylation using tunicamycin impairs dentritic growth, inhibitors of core-glycan maturation have no effect, suggesting that mature N-glycans are not required for dendritic development. The authors provide evidence that core-glycosylated proteins reach the cell surface by Golgi by-pass pathways. Finally, by studying the turn-over of the AMPA receptor subunit GluA2 that exists at the plasma membrane under mature and immature forms, they document that the core-glycosylated pool of GluA2 has a substantially shorter half-time than the pool with mature N-glycans."

Previous studies have identified numbers of mRNAs that are trafficked to dendrites for \"localized\" protein synthesis. Is there any correlation between dendritic mRNA targeting and core-glycosylation? For example, is TARPg8 primarily synthesized in the soma whereas GluN1 or GABAARb3 are targeted to dendrites? This point should be discussed in the revised manuscript.</i>"

Arguably however, delineating where receptors are synthesized, folded, assembled, glycosylated and what exact itinerary they follow to reach the plasma membrane is largely unknown, and that these questions extend far beyond the scope of a single paper. In fact, this question constitutes the major project of another postdoctoral fellow in the lab. We hope, given the scope of what is covered in the revised manuscript, that the reviewers and editors agree that the including findings are of fundamental importance and indeed motivate future studies like those suggested above."

A difficulty here is that as far as we can discern, the commercially available antibodies directed against these proteins do not work in rodent neurons. All the antibodies that we have tried so far did not work, yielding either no signal at all or unspecific signal (e.g. strong nucleus staining etc.). We note however that the exclusion of Golgi-GFP (derived from a human galactosyl-transferase) and endogenous Golgi Mannosidase II (with an antibody that is no longer available) from dendrites have been extensively documented (reviewed in (Hanus and Ehlers, 2008; 2016).
