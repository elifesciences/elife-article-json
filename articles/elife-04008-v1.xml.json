Mechanistic insights have been challenging since variation within this locus is complex and biological roles of the factor H-related proteins, unlike factor H, are incompletely understood. <i>N. meningitidis</i> subverts immune responses by hijacking a host-immune regulator, complement factor H (CFH), to the bacterial surface (<a href=\"#bib25\">Schneider et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Madico et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Schneider et al., 2009</a>). We demonstrate that complement factor-H related 3 (CFHR3) promotes immune activation by acting as an antagonist of CFH. Conserved sequences between CFH and CFHR3 mean that the bacterium cannot sufficiently distinguish between these two serum proteins to allow it to hijack the regulator alone. The level of protection from complement attack achieved by circulating <i>N. meningitidis</i> therefore depends on the relative levels of CFH and CFHR3 in serum. These data may explain the association between genetic variation in both CFH and CFHR3 and susceptibility to meningococcal disease."

Mechanistic insights have been challenging since variation within this locus is complex and biological roles of the factor H-related proteins, unlike factor H, are incompletely understood. <i>N. meningitidis</i> subverts immune responses by hijacking a host-immune regulator, complement factor H (CFH), to the bacterial surface (<a href=\"#bib25\">Schneider et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Madico et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Schneider et al., 2009</a>). We demonstrate that complement factor-H related 3 (CFHR3) promotes immune activation by acting as an antagonist of CFH. Conserved sequences between CFH and CFHR3 mean that the bacterium cannot sufficiently distinguish between these two serum proteins to allow it to hijack the regulator alone. The level of protection from complement attack achieved by circulating <i>N. meningitidis</i> therefore depends on the relative levels of CFH and CFHR3 in serum. These data may explain the association between genetic variation in both CFH and CFHR3 and susceptibility to meningococcal disease."

Caesar et al. explain that susceptibility to meningococcal disease is determined by how much CFH and how much CFHR3 each individual has, and that those with less CFHR3 will be more susceptible to <i>N. meningitidis</i>. An individual's genes will affect how much CFH and CFHR3 they have, while the genes of the bacterium can influence how strongly the CFH binding protein binds to either of these human proteins.

For most individuals, however, this human-specific bacterium is primarily a non-pathogenic commensal of the nasopharynx, and up to 40% of the population are healthy carriers (<a href=\"#bib3\">Caugant and Maiden, 2009</a>). The mechanisms underlying human genetic influences that govern the development of invasive disease or asymptomatic carriage are incompletely understood. It is known, however, that complement activation is critical for protection against disease, evident from the susceptibility of individuals with genetic deficiency of either the alternative complement pathway (AP) or terminal pathway activation, and among those receiving therapy that prevents terminal pathway activation (<a href=\"#bib26\">Schneider et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">McKeage, 2011</a>). Amongst several strategies that promote complement evasion<i>, N. meningitidis</i> recruits the human negative complement regulator, complement factor H (CFH), to its surface by expressing factor H binding protein (fHbp) (<a href=\"#bib25\">Schneider et al., 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib27\">2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Madico et al., 2007</a>). fHbp can be divided into three variant groups (V1, V2, and V3), which have &gt;85% sequence identity within the groups but only 60\u201370% similarity between groups (<a href=\"#bib19\">Masignani et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Brehony et al., 2009</a>). fHbps from all variant groups bind CFH with a <i>K</i><sub><i>D</i></sub> in the low nanomolar range (<a href=\"#bib12\">Johnson et al., 2012</a>). Therefore, it is significant that the only single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with meningococcal disease in a recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) were those among the <i>CFH\u2013CFHR</i> locus. These included SNPs within <i>CFH</i> and the downstream gene, <i>CFHR3</i> (<a href=\"#bib4\">Davila et al., 2010</a>). While CFH has been extensively studied (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib18\">Makou et al. (2013)</a>), the role of the serum protein CFHR3 has not been unambiguously established (reviewed in <a href=\"#bib15\">Jozsi and Meri (2014)</a>)."

Given the association of CFHR3 with meningococcal disease (<a href=\"#bib4\">Davila et al., 2010</a>), we investigated whether this protein and CFHR4 also act as CFH antagonists in this assay.

This demonstrated that V2 and V3 fHbps displayed no selective affinity for CFH over CFHR3 (average selectivity being 1.8 \u00b1 1.4 and 2.4 \u00b1 1.0, respectively). In contrast, V1 fHbps had lower affinities for CFHR3 compared to CFH (average selectivity 8.9 \u00b1 4.6-fold), with 12 of the 14 V1 fHbp variants binding CFH 5- to 20-fold more tightly than CFHR3. Modeling the effect on the occupancy of fHbp with CFH indicates that certain V1 fHbps will be bound by CFH in the physiological situation regardless of CFHR3 levels (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). To examine whether this has any functional consequence, we examined complement AP killing of isogenic strains expressing fHbp sequences with different abilities to discriminate between CFH and CFHR3 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>); AP killing was assessed to exclude any confounding influence of antibodies in sera preferentially recognizing different fHbps. Bacteria expressing V3.28 fHbp, which has identical affinities for CFH and CFHR3, were the most sensitive to AP killing, while the strain expressing the V1.1 fHbp sequence (which has \u223c20-fold tighter binding to CFH than CFHR3) was the least sensitive; bacteria with fHbps with intermediate CFH specificity displayed intermediate levels of protection. This suggests that, even though the most specific fHbps bind CFHR3 with a <i>K</i><sub><i>D</i></sub> significantly below the physiological concentration (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a>), the ability of fHbp to favour CFH binding promotes bacterial survival and offers a potential explanation for the prevalence of strains expressing V1 fHbp causing invasive disease (<a href=\"#bib16\">Lucidarme et al., 2009</a>)."

Natural fHbp sequences are relatively constant in their K<sub>D</sub> for CFH (K<sub>D</sub> \u223c3 nM [<a href=\"#bib12\">Johnson et al., 2012</a>] and this work), therefore we modelled the effect of the K<sub>D</sub> for CFHR3 varying between 3 nM and 300 nM against this constant K<sub>D</sub> for CFH under two conditions.

Our data predict that the risk of developing meningococcal disease will be governed by the relative abundance of CFH and CFHR3 in individuals and the affinity of these molecules for the specific fHbp on the bacterial surface (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). It is notable that the \u0394<i>CFHR3/1</i> allele has a high prevalence in sub-Saharan Africa (<a href=\"#bib11\">Holmes et al., 2013</a>) where there are high rates of epidemic disease. Our mechanism is consistent with this association, since this allele would enhance the interaction between CFH and fHbp and favour pathogen survival. This is particularly true as the <i>\u0394</i><i>CFHR3/1</i> deletion is associated with increased plasma CFH levels, most likely due to the loss of a regulatory locus (<a href=\"#bib1\">Ansari et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Zhu et al., 2014</a>). However, host polymorphisms in CFHR3 might have less impact on strains of bacteria that express fHbp that more selectively bind CFH. Therefore, susceptibility to meningococcal disease will be influenced by polymorphisms and copy number variation affecting two host complement factors and by the relative affinity of fHbp on an infecting strain for CFH and CFHR3. This illustrates why genetic association studies in infectious diseases are likely to be technically challenging since these will be influenced not only by sequence and structural variation within the host but also by genetic variation in pathogen."

Female BALB/c mice were immunised with 100 \u03bcg of recombinant protein emulsified in TitreMax Gold (Sigma, UK) subcutaneously on day 1, then with 100 \u03bcg of CFHR3<sub>45</sub> in PBS intraperitoneally (IP) on days 21 and 42. A booster of 200 \u03bcg of recombinant protein in PBS was given IP 3 days prior to cell fusion on day 63. NS0 myeloma cells were grown in RPMI 1640 (Lonza, UK) supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS, Sigma, UK), 2 mM L-glutamine, penicillin (100 U/ml), and streptomycin (100 \u03bcg/ml) (<a href=\"#bib7\">Galfre and Milstein, 1981</a>). Splenectomy was performed on day 66, and splenocytes fused to NS0 myeloma in polyethylene glycol (PEG 1500, Roche, UK) (<a href=\"#bib20\">Mason et al., 1983</a>). Fused cells were then plated into 24-well plates in RPMI 1640 containing 2 mM L-glutamine, penicillin (100 U/ml), streptomycin (100 \u03bcg/ml), and 1% Ultroser G (Pal France). After 24 hr, 2% hypoxanthine adminopterin thymidine (HAT, Life technologies) was added to the wells. Hybridoma clone supernatants were screened by ELISA against recombinant CFHR3<sub>45</sub>. Positive clones were re-plated and grown for a further 5 days before screening again by ELISA against the CFHR3<sub>45</sub> and all five CFHR proteins. Positive hybridoma cells were sub-cultured into 96-well plates at a concentration of 1 cell per well in RPMI 1640 containing 10% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, penicillin (100 U/ml), streptomycin (100 \u03bcg/ml), Ultroser G (1%), and BM Condimed H1 (1%, Roche, UK). After 5 days, wells containing single colonies were screened as before."

Previously, it is known that fHbp, a surface exposed lipoprotein from <i>N. meningitidis</i>, can bind to complement factor H (CFH), playing an important role of evasion of complement-mediated killing of the bacteria. Because of this, study of fHbp binding to CFH has important implications in vaccine design and improvement. In this work, the authors pursue a result from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) study of <i>N. meningitidis</i> that implicates human variability in CFHR3 as associated with host susceptibility. They demonstrate that CFHR3 could also bind to fHbp with a similar affinity as CFH and went further to show that the binding surface on fHbp by CFH and CFHR3 completely overlaps. They then demonstrate convincingly that CFHR3 promotes complement activation by competing with CFH on the bacterial surface. Finally, they further propose a model that the relative levels of two complement and related proteins (CFH and CFHR3) in the circulation system is a critical factor for determining the host susceptibility to meningococcal disease. In general, the study is very clearly written and provides an exciting and generally interesting observation. The concept proposed is novel and highly interesting given that there are five CFHR proteins that are often involved in binding to surface proteins of various bacterial pathogens. The paper is potentially suitable for <i>eLife</i> after addressing the following points."

This SNP tags the CFHR3\u20131 deletion in many populations. The statistically significant associations in the GWAS study consisted of SNPs within CFH, within CFHR3 and within CFHR1, although the latter failed genotyping in one of the cohorts [Spanish] so was not included in the combined analysis (Davila et al., Nature Genetics 2010, Table 2). On the data presented it was not possible to conclude that the identified SNPs were causal because many of them were in linkage disequilibrium across the CFH\u2013CFHR locus. In fact Davila et al. make the point \u201cthese CFH and CFHR SNPs are statistically indistinguishable from one another, and further work, such as deep resequencing, may be needed to identify the causal variant or variants within the associated region if the currently identified SNPs are not the functional variants\u201d. What we can robustly conclude from the existing data is that variation within the CFH\u2013CFHR locus influences susceptibility to macular degeneration. This includes variation within CFH (not unexpected from observations from complement deficiency states) and within the CFHR protein family (unexpected). Our functional studies support an association with variation within CFHR3. We have modified the text to reflect these comments."
