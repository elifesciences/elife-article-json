Despite its central role in stress resistance, disease and aging, the mechanisms that control Hsf1 activity remain unresolved. Here we show that in budding yeast, Hsf1 basally associates with the chaperone Hsp70 and this association is transiently disrupted by heat shock, providing the first evidence that a chaperone repressor directly regulates Hsf1 activity. We develop and experimentally validate a mathematical model of Hsf1 activation by heat shock in which unfolded proteins compete with Hsf1 for binding to Hsp70. Surprisingly, we find that Hsf1 phosphorylation, previously thought to be required for activation, in fact only positively tunes Hsf1 and does so without affecting Hsp70 binding. Our work reveals two uncoupled forms of regulation - an ON/OFF chaperone switch and a tunable phosphorylation gain - that allow Hsf1 to flexibly integrate signals from the proteostasis network and cell signaling pathways."

Despite its central role in stress resistance, disease and aging, the mechanisms that control Hsf1 activity remain unresolved. Here we show that in budding yeast, Hsf1 basally associates with the chaperone Hsp70 and this association is transiently disrupted by heat shock, providing the first evidence that a chaperone repressor directly regulates Hsf1 activity. We develop and experimentally validate a mathematical model of Hsf1 activation by heat shock in which unfolded proteins compete with Hsf1 for binding to Hsp70. Surprisingly, we find that Hsf1 phosphorylation, previously thought to be required for activation, in fact only positively tunes Hsf1 and does so without affecting Hsp70 binding. Our work reveals two uncoupled forms of regulation - an ON/OFF chaperone switch and a tunable phosphorylation gain - that allow Hsf1 to flexibly integrate signals from the proteostasis network and cell signaling pathways."

When bound to the chaperone, Hsf1 is turned \u2018off\u2019; when the chaperone falls off, Hsf1 turns \u2018on\u2019 and makes more chaperones; when there are enough chaperones, they once again bind to Hsf1 and turn it back \u2018off\u2019. In this way, Hsf1 and the chaperones form a feedback loop that ensures that there are always enough chaperones to keep the cell\u2019s proteins folded."

Specifically, we combine mass spectrometry, biochemistry, mathematical modeling, genetics and synthetic biology to propose and validate that Hsp70 dynamically interacts with Hsf1 to form the basis of a bona fide activation \u2018switch\u2019 and feedback loop that regulates Hsf1 activity during heat shock. Based on this finding, we then investigate the role and quantitative contribution of Hsf1 phosphorylation in regulating the output of the heat shock transcriptional response. We use en masse mutational analysis, combined with transcriptomic and genome-wide ChIP-seq measurements, to systematically define the function of Hsf1 phosphorylation. We find that phosphorylation is fully dispensable for Hsf1 activation during heat shock, but contributes by enhancing transcriptional output levels as a 'positive gain'. Phosphorylation does not control the interaction between Hsf1 and Hsp70, but rather enhances transcription independent of whether Hsp70 is bound or not. Our findings reveal that Hsf1 uses these two modes of regulation \u2013 a chaperone switch and phosphorylation fine-tuning \u2013 in a largely uncoupled fashion to dynamically control the heat shock response. We propose that this allows Hsf1 to integrate diverse signaling information without disrupting its direct readout of the proteostasis network."

We purified recombinant Hsf1-6xHIS and 6xHIS-3xFLAG-Ssa2 from <i>E. coli</i>, mixed the recombinant proteins together at an equimolar ratio and performed an anti-FLAG IP. We precipitated Hsf1 only in the presence of Ssa2, demonstrating that they can specifically and directly bind to each other (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>). We reversed the affinity tags and likewise precipitated Ssa2 in the presence of 3xFLAG-Hsf1 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Addition of ATP neither enhanced nor disrupted the interaction between Hsf1 and Ssa2 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). By contrast, addition of a five-fold molar excess of the aggregation-prone, Alzheimer\u2019s disease-associated A\u03b242 peptide reduced the interaction between Hsf1 and Ssa2 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). This suggests that hydrophobic peptides can titrate Hsp70 away from Hsf1. Taken together, these in vivo and in vitro results confirm that Hsp70 dynamically dissociates and re-associates with Hsf1 during heat shock."

The goal of the model was two-fold: (1) to quantitatively explore if Hsp70 interaction \u2018switching\u2019 could serve as a core, minimal regulatory mechanism that recapitulates the dynamics of heat shock response; (2) to generate quantitative predictions to further test this molecular mechanism. Our model consisted of a system of six coupled ordinary differential equations, describing a feedback loop in which free Hsf1 induces production of Hsp70, and free Hsp70 in turn binds to Hsf1 in a transcriptionally inactive complex (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>, see Materials and methods). In addition to binding to Hsf1, Hsp70 can also bind to an unfolded protein (UP), but cannot bind to both Hsf1 and UP simultaneously. UPs are introduced at a level that is based on the temperature in accordance with biophysical measurements (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>, see Materials and methods) (<a href=\"#bib34\">Lepock et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Scheff et al., 2015</a>). In this manner, temperature upshifts increase the level of UPs, simulating protein folding stress caused by heat shock. UPs titrate Hsp70 away from Hsf1, leaving Hsf1 free to activate expression of more Hsp70, thus generating the feedback loop. This minimal model ignores any potential role for phosphorylation or other post-translational modifications in regulating Hsf1 activity."

As an output of the model, we tracked transcription of a \u2018reporter\u2019 whose levels are dependent on Hsf1 activity. This in silico reporter can be directly compared to experimental measurements of an Hsf1-dependent HSE-YFP reporter that we integrated into the yeast genome (<a href=\"#bib5\">Brandman et al., 2012</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Simulations of the HSE-YFP reporter generated induction curves that reached temperature-dependent plateaus (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Since YFP is a long-lived protein \u2013 in cells and in the model \u2013 the plateaus indicate that no more YFP is being produced in the simulation and Hsf1 has deactivated. We performed the same temperature step time course experiments in cells and measured the HSE-YFP reporter at discrete time points by flow cytometry. As predicted by the model, we observed induction leading to temperature-dependent maximal responses (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). However, following the initial rapid accumulation of YFP that was predicted by the model, the cells continued to accumulate signal slowly through the later time points (this later phase of transcriptional output is addressed further below). These results suggest that a chaperone titration model is sufficient to account for the immediate Hsf1 activation dynamics in response to temperature steps."

For example, in addition to activation by UPs (via increases in temperature), the model predicted that Hsf1 transcriptional activity can be driven by Hsf1 overexpression in the absence of temperature upshifts (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,C</a>). Less intuitively, the model also predicted that overexpression of an Hsf1 \u2018decoy\u2019, which lacks the ability to trimerize or bind DNA, would activate endogenous Hsf1 by titrating Hsp70 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B,C</a>). We next used synthetic biology approaches to experimentally test the model predictions. We constructed a decoy mutant by removing the DNA binding and trimerization domains from Hsf1 and replacing them with the well-folded fluorescent protein mKate2 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). We then placed either a wild type allele of <i>HSF1</i> or the decoy under the synthetic control of a \u03b2-estradiol (estradiol) inducible system (<a href=\"#bib47\">Pincus et al., 2014</a>) (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A,B</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>, see Materials and methods). In agreement with the model, both full length Hsf1 and the decoy activated the HSE-YFP reporter in dose-dependent manners, with full length Hsf1 serving as a more potent activator than the decoy (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). By contrast, expression of mKate2 alone led to only a modest increase in HSE-YFP levels as a function of estradiol (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). Importantly, the decoy does not form aggregates when overexpressed, remaining diffusely localized in the nucleus in both basal and heat shock conditions, but does interact with the Hsp70 chaperones Ssa1/2 and disrupts the interaction between endogenous Hsf1 and Ssa1/2 in co-IP assays (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>, <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data 1</a>). Domain truncation analysis of the decoy revealed that the C-terminal activation domain of Hsf1 is both necessary and sufficient to activate endogenous Hsf1, while the N-terminal activation domain is dispensable (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C,D</a>). Thus, the decoy is not merely a UP, but rather functions as a specific activator of Hsf1, likely by titrating away Hsp70 via its C-terminal activation domain."

To isolate the consequences of inducing the transcriptional program in the absence of stress, we constructed a synthetic fusion of the Hsf1 DNA binding and trimerization domains with a transcriptional activation domain derived from the herpes simplex virus protein 16 (DBD<sub>Hsf1</sub>-VP16) (<a href=\"#bib51\">Sadowski et al., 1988</a>), and placed this fusion under estradiol control.

                                "text": "Since Hsf1 overexpression impairs growth, inhibitors of Hsf1 activity should be genetic suppressors of the growth phenotype. To test if chaperones would behave as Hsf1 inhibitors, we placed Ssa2 (Hsp70), Hsc82 (Hsp90) and Ydj1 (Hsp40) under the control of strong Hsf1-independent promoters (see Materials and methods) (<a href=\"#bib57\">Sol\u00eds et al., 2016</a>) and assayed for their ability to suppress the growth defect of cells overexpressing Hsf1. Interestingly, both Hsp70 and Hsp40 partially suppressed the growth inhibition caused by Hsf1 overexpression, while Hsp90 failed to provide any growth rescue (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). These data are consistent with prior reports in mammalian cells showing that overexpression of Hsp70 and Hsp40 attenuate Hsf1 activity (<a href=\"#bib55\">Shi et al., 1998</a>) and in <i>C. elegans</i> showing that loss of Hsp70 results in\u00a0&gt;10 fold more Hsf1 activation than loss of Hsp90 (<a href=\"#bib16\">Guisbert et al., 2013</a>). Since Hsp40 chaperones deliver substrates and stimulate the ATPase activity of Hsp70 chaperones (<a href=\"#bib26\">Kampinga and Craig, 2010</a>), Hsp40 may be enhancing the activity of endogenous Hsp70 to suppress Hsf1 overexpression. To determine if Hsp40 is required for efficient Hsp70 binding to Hsf1, we deleted <i>YDJ1</i> and performed a co-IP heat shock time course. We observed that Hsp70 was still able to robustly bind to Hsf1 under basal conditions and transiently dissociate during heat shock (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). However, basal Hsf1 activity was increased\u00a0&gt;3 fold as measured by the HSE-YFP reporter in <i>ydj1\u2206</i> cells (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>), indicating that there is likely to be greater total Hsp70 in these cells and complicating direct comparison of <i>ydj1\u2206</i> and wild type cells. Thus, overexpression of Hsp40 may directly increase the ability for Hsp70 to bind to Hsf1 or generally improve global proteostasis such that there is more unoccupied Hsp70 available to repress Hsf1. Co-expression of Hsp70 and Hsp40 afforded more rescue than either chaperone alone, but addition of Hsp90 did not enhance the suppression provided by Hsp70 alone (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). Hsp70 and Hsp40 together diminished the ability of Hsf1 and the decoy to inhibit growth and induce the HSE-YFP reporter across the estradiol dose response (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). By contrast, Hsp90 failed to rescue growth or reduce HSE-YFP induction (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). Taken together, these data support a model in which Hsp70, assisted by Hsp40, represses Hsf1 with little contribution from Hsp90."

Rather than coinciding with the dissociation of Hsp70, which occurs within the first five minutes following temperature upshift (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), Hsf1 phosphorylation peaked after 20 min and was maintained out to at least two hours (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Thus, the timing of Hsf1 phosphorylation matches the second phase of Hsf1 transcriptional activity (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). This result suggests that Hsf1 phosphorylation can drive increased transcription even when Hsf1 is bound to Hsp70. Consistent with phosphorylation driving the second phase of Hsf1 transcriptional activity, Hsf1<sup>\u2206po4</sup> completely lacked sustained activity at the later time points (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Incorporating phosphorylation into the mathematical model as a 'positive gain' according to the experimentally determined kinetics (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>, see Materials and methods) allowed the model to recapitulate the activation dynamics of both wild type Hsf1 and Hsf1<sup>\u2206po4</sup> throughout the heat shock time course (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Taken together, the data presented here support a model in which Hsf1 integrates negative feedback regulation by Hsp70 and positive fine-tuning by phosphorylation to dynamically control the heat shock response (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>)."

However, the elegance of this model has perhaps overshadowed the lack of data to support it. Here we provide multiple lines of evidence for a chaperone titration model in budding yeast. Specifically, we showed that the Hsp70 chaperone binds to Hsf1 in basal conditions, dissociates during the acute phase of heat shock, and subsequently re-associates at later time points, thus providing the first direct evidence of a dynamic Hsf1 \u2018switch\u2019 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Furthermore, we reconstituted the interaction between Hsp70 and Hsf1 in vitro with recombinant proteins and partially disrupted the complex with a hydrophobic peptide (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). We then constructed a minimal mathematical model of the Hsp70 feedback loop, and showed that it recapitulated the dynamics of Hsf1 transcriptional activity during heat shock (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B\u2013D</a>). The model also correctly predicted that synthetic perturbations to the feedback loop, such as adding a \u2018decoy\u2019 of Hsf1, would activate the endogenous Hsf1 response via Hsp70 titration (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). Finally, we provided independent genetic support for the model by showing that increased expression of Hsp70 and Hsp40 (an Hsp70 co-factor) suppresses the growth impairment caused by Hsf1 overexpression (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). Thus, biochemical, genetic and computational approaches converged to support a model in which Hsp70 and Hsf1 form a feedback loop that controls heat shock response activation."

Biochemically, our inability to detect Hsp90 binding to Hsf1 could be due to the serial affinity purification strategy that we employed: if Hsp90 weakly associates with Hsf1, we would likely lose the interaction during the two-step purification. However, the combination of the lack of biochemical evidence with the genetic result that Hsp90 overexpression is unable to suppress Hsf1 overexpression suggests a parsimonious explanation that Hsp90 simply does not repress yeast Hsf1. Using our Hsp70-centric model, we can explain the genetic studies in which loss of Hsp90 function activates Hsf1 (<a href=\"#bib5\">Brandman et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Duina et al., 1998</a>) by supposing that reduced Hsp90 leads to increased levels of unfolded proteins that titrate Hsp70 away from Hsf1."

We identified 73 sites of phosphorylation on Hsf1 across various conditions (<a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 4\u2014source data 1</a>). Remarkably, however, Hsf1 retained its essential basal functionality and heat shock-induced activity in the complete absence of phosphorylation (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>). Consistent with this observation, human Hsf1 also remained heat shock-inducible following mutation of a subset of its phosphorylation sites (<a href=\"#bib6\">Budzynski et al., 2015</a>). Despite its qualitative functionality in the absence of phosphorylation, Hsf1<sup>\u2206po4</sup> was quantitatively impaired in its ability to induce its target genes during heat shock (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). Conversely, mimicking hyper-phosphorylation increased basal expression of the Hsf1 target regulon without disrupting its heat shock inducibility (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4F,G</a>). Moreover, the number of phospho-mimetic residues correlated with transcriptional output (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4I</a>). Thus, in contrast to prevailing models suggesting that phosphorylation is required for activation, we conclude that phosphorylation is not the switch that activates Hsf1; rather, phosphorylation is a positive fine-tuner that amplifies the transcriptional activity of Hsf1. We propose that increased negative charge in the transcriptional activation domains of Hsf1, endowed by phosphorylation or phospho-mimetic mutations, increases the ability of Hsf1 to recruit the Mediator complex and initiate transcription (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>). In this manner, phosphorylation renders the activation domains into the 'acid blobs' that have long been associated with potent transcriptional activators (<a href=\"#bib56\">Sigler, 1988</a>)."

These include identifying the molecular determinants of the Hsf1\u2022Hsp70 interaction, defining the mechanism by which Hsp70 represses Hsf1 under basal conditions and whether this mechanism also applies to Hsf1 deactivation, determining potential roles for other chaperones (such as Hsp40, Hsp90 and chaperonins) in Hsf1 regulation \u2013 particularly in different evolutionary lineages \u2013 and identifying the kinases that phosphorylate Hsf1. On the latter, many kinases have been shown to regulate Hsf1 in various conditions, but the pathways that converge on Hsf1 have yet to be systematically defined. Given the low level of conservation of the Hsf1 activation domains (<a href=\"#bib2\">Anckar and Sistonen, 2011</a>) and the preponderance of S/T residues in putatively unstructured, solvent exposed regions of the protein, many kinases could potentially find a substrate site on Hsf1.

Hsf1 phosphorylation does not interfere with Hsp70 binding (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B,C</a>), and the kinetics of Hsf1 phosphorylation are delayed with respect to Hsp70 dissociation, with phosphorylation peaking after Hsp70 has re-associated with Hsf1 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures\u00a01A</a> and <a href=\"#fig6\">6A</a>). These two distinct regulatory modes correlate with an immediate surge in Hsf1 transcriptional activity followed by a sustained moderate level of activity (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Uncoupled regulation by chaperone binding and phosphorylation allows Hsf1 to function as an integration hub. Hsf1 can directly link to the proteostasis network by sensing the availability of Hsp70 as a proxy for protein folding conditions as well as respond to signals from multiple kinase pathways that convey information about other intracellular and extracellular conditions, such as oxidative stress and nutrient availability (<a href=\"#bib18\">Hahn and Thiele, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Yamamoto et al., 2007</a>).

Nevertheless, this work for the first time defines a regulatory scheme that synthesizes the roles of both canonical Hsf1 regulatory mechanisms, and as such can serve as both a precedent and template for the dissection of Hsf1 regulation in other cellular models. With a quantitative understanding of how Hsf1 is regulated when it is functioning properly, we can begin to unravel how it breaks down in neurodegenerative disorders and is usurped in cancer."

At time t\u00a0=\u00a00, 25 ml of 53\u00b0C media was added to instantly bring the culture to 39\u00b0C and then the culture was incubated with shaking at 39\u00b0C. 5 ml samples were collected at each time point by centrifugation. Pellets were boiled with 2X SDS loading buffer for 10 min. Total protein concentration was measured by NanoDrop and an equal amount of each sample was loaded into 7.5% SDS-PAGE gel and otherwise processed as above."

According to the model, free Hsp70 binds to Hsf1 in a transcriptionally inactive complex, while free Hsf1 induces production of Hsp70 (and the YFP reporter). In addition to binding to Hsf1, Hsp70 can also bind to unfolded protein (UP) and become titrated away from Hsf1. There are a few key assumptions to the model. First, the model assumes Hsp70 cannot bind to both Hsf1 and UP simultaneously. Second, the dilution rate of YFP molecules due to cell division is assumed to be negligible (<i>k<sub>dil</sub></i>\u00a0~0); this is because the time course for our simulations and reporter heat shock assays is short (~1 cell generation) and YFP molecules are relatively long lived (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Third, this initial implementation of the model ignores any potential role for Hsf1 phosphorylation. Fourth, for simplicity, the model assumes the on-rate constants of Hsp70 for both clients (UP and Hsf1) are the same (<a href=\"#bib41\">Mayer and Bukau, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Pierpaoli et al., 1998</a>). Finally, binding of Hsf1 to DNA driving transcription of <i>Hsp70</i> or <i>YFP</i> is modeled by a Hill equation with a Hill coefficient of <i>n</i>\u00a0=\u00a03 as a simple representation of Hsf1 trimerization (<a href=\"#bib60\">Sorger and Nelson, 1989</a>)."

Specifically, we chose a range of values for each parameter (Figure S2C). We then ran simulations for all possible combinations of parameters equally distributed across the ranges (7\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>5</sup> total parameters) to select parameter sets that satisfy three features of our Hsp70 dissociation data. First, Hsf1 must be bound to Hsp70 in basal conditions at 25\u00b0C. Second, the Hsf1\u2022Hsp70 complex must dissociate to\u00a0\u226410% of its basal level within five minutes following a shift from 25\u00b0C to 39\u00b0C. Third, the Hsf1\u2022Hsp70 complex must re-associate to\u00a0\u226590% of its initial level within 60 min following a shift from 25\u00b0C to 39\u00b0C. As an initial condition, we set the ratio of the level of Hsp70:Hsf1 to 500:1, which is in the range of measured values (<a href=\"#bib8\">Chong et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Kulak et al., 2014</a>). We obtained parameter sets that satisfied these constraints (Figure S2C), from which we selected final parameters that quantitatively recapitulated the transient dissociation behavior of Hsp70 (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). Satisfyingly, this analysis revealed that most parameters tolerated a broad range of values (Figure S2C), provided that Hsf1 induces transcription cooperatively (i.e. one of our assumptions), which is consistent with prior work showing that Hsf1 binds DNA as a trimer (<a href=\"#bib60\">Sorger and Nelson, 1989</a>)."

According to calorimetry and other previous work investigating cellular protein unfolding during heat shock, the relationship between UP and temperature can be simply described by an exponential function for low temperatures (25\u00b0C\u201350\u00b0C) (<a href=\"#bib34\">Lepock et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Scheff et al., 2015</a>). Specifically, we used an exponential function that passes through our fixed value of [UP] at 39\u00b0C (the value used for the parameter screen described above, <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>), a small basal value of [UP] at 25\u00b0C ([UP]<sub>o</sub>\u00a0=\u00a00.52), and [UP] values at other temperatures that generally capture steady state YFP reporter outputs. [UP] for other temperatures could then be obtained using this function, and used as initial values for simulating upshifts to other temperatures, such 35\u00b0C and 43\u00b0C (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>)."

We ordered gBlocks from IDT containing regions of Hsf1 with all S/T codons mutated to alanine. The C-terminal portion required codon optimization in order to remove repetitive sequence to allow synthesis. Originally, restriction sites were introduced at the boundaries of the regions to enable cut-and-paste combinatorial cloning. Finally, all restriction sites were removed by assembling the fragments via Gibson assembly. Gibson assembly was performed as directed by the manufacturer (NEB)."

Input was set aside, and a serial IP was performed. First, 25 \u00b5l of anti-FLAG magnetic beads (50% slurry, Sigma) were added the mixture was incubated for 2 hr at 4\u00b0C on a rotator. Beads were separated with a magnet and the supernatant was removed.

Beads were separated with a magnet and eluate was transferred to a fresh tube. Next, 25 \u00b5l of anti-V5 magnetic beads (50% slurry, MBL International) were added and the mixture was incubated for 2 hr at 4\u00b0C on a rotator. Beads were separated with a magnet and the supernatant was removed. Beads were washed three times with ChIP buffer, followed by a high salt wash (ChIP buffer\u00a0+500 mM NaCl) and a final wash in TE. Bound material was eluted with 250 \u00b5l TE\u00a0+1% SDS by incubating at 65\u00b0C for 15 min. Beads were separated with a magnet and eluate was transferred to a fresh tube and incubated overnight at 65\u00b0C to reverse crosslinks. Protein was degraded by adding 250 \u00b5l 40 \u00b5g/ml proteinase K in TE (supplemented with GlycoBlue) and incubating at 37\u00b0C for 2 hr. DNA fragments were separated from protein by adding 500 \u00b5l phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1), and the aqueous layer was added to a fresh tube. 55 \u00b5l of 4M LiCl was added along with 1 ml of 100% EtOH, and DNA was precipitated at \u221280\u00b0C overnight. DNA was pelleted by spinning for 30 min at 4\u00b0C and resuspended in 50 \u00b5l TE. Sequencing libraries were prepared by the WIGTC, and sequenced on the Illumina Hi-Seq 2500."

They also re-assessed the somewhat enigmatic role of Hsf1 phosphorylation in its transcriptional activation. Through the use of mass spectrometry to identity a large number of heat shock-induced Hsf1 phosphorylation sites, the generation of phosphosite mutants, yeast genetic analysis, mathematical modeling, and a synthetic biology approach, the authors provide convincing evidence that Hsf1 is repressed by the Hsp70 chaperone in the non-stressed state and that titration of Hsp70 by unfolded proteins dominates the initial phase of the heat shock response. Phosphorylation of Hsf1 occurs only at later stages of the response and is responsible for sustained induction of target genes by recruitment of the mediator complex to the heat shock promoters, rather than Hsp70 dissociation."

These data are included in <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a> and described in the subsection \u201cHsp70 and Hsp40 suppress Hsf1 overexpression\u201d. We observed that Hsf1 was still able to bind to Hsp70 in the absence of Ydj1 under basal conditions and transiently dissociate during heat shock. In fact, there appears to be more Hsp70 relative to Hsf1 in the <i>ydj1\u2206</i> strain compared to wild type. Also, the degree of Hsp70 dissociation was reduced and the duration of the dissociation was shorter. So at a first pass, it appears that loss of this Hsp40 <i>increases</i> the association between Hsf1 and Hsp70 rather than decreasing the association as would be expected if it enhanced binding. However, the problem with interpreting this experiment is revealed by the HSE-YFP reporter assay: the <i>ydj1\u2206</i> cells have ~3-fold higher HSE-YFP levels than wild type cells under basal conditions. Since all four <i>SSA</i> genes are Hsf1 targets, it is likely that there is more total Hsp70 in the cell under basal conditions in the <i>ydj1\u2206</i> strain. Thus, without a conditional depletion of Ydj1, the altered initial conditions in the <i>ydj1\u2206</i> strain preclude a direct comparison of the role of Hsp40 in the binding of Hsp70 to Hsf1. We look forward to exploring the roles of the Hsp70 co-chaperones in regulating Hsf1 in depth in future work."

As can be seen in Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 4D, the localization patterns are the same. And importantly, as shown in Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 4E, the genome-wide DNA binding profiles of wild type Hsf1 and Hsf1<sup>\u2206po4</sup> are superimposable, indicating that the mutations we introduced in the DNA binding domain do not alter DNA binding site preference. Moreover, the genome-wide mRNA levels in Hsf1<sup>\u2206po4</sup> cells matches the wild type to a striking degree (R<sup>2</sup>=0.98, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). Understanding how these mutants function in response to other challenges to proteostasis, such as over-expression of an unfolded protein and treatment with amino acid analogs such as canavanine or AZC \u2013 as well as other stresses that Hsf1 responds to such as glucose depletion and oxidative stress \u2013 will be an important focus of future studies."
