Gem1, which is already known to regulate other aspects of the interaction between the ER and mitochondria (<a href=\"#bib6\">Kornmann et al., 2011</a>), contains two domains that bind calcium ions and two domains that break down GTP molecules (which are closely related to the ATP molecules used by mitochondria to store chemical energy)."

The ERMES subunits were found to localize to the constriction sites in both wild-type yeast and in mutant yeast lacking Gem1 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). The mitochondria also went on to divide successfully in both types of yeast, but both daughter mitochondria remained stuck to the ER in the mutant yeast cells (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>).

Murley et al. demonstrate that the GTPase activity of this protein, but not its calcium-binding activity, is required for the final release of ER\u2013mitochondria contacts, which is consistent with the results of mitochondrial inheritance studies (<a href=\"#bib8\">Koshiba et al., 2011</a>). It has been suggested that ERMES components link the nucleoids to the cellular cytoskeleton (<a href=\"#bib1\">Boldogh et al., 2003</a>). This notion is compatible with the results of experiments which found that the enzymes Miro1 and 2\u2014which are similar to Gem1 in many ways\u2014mobilize mitochondria in mammalian cells by interacting with components of the cytoskeleton (<a href=\"#bib3\">Glater et al., 2006</a>). Gem1 could thus be involved in the recruitment of protein motility factors that promote the spatial separation of the daughter mitochondria following the division process. Alternatively, Gem1 might act directly on ERMES to regulate the physical link between the ER and mitochondria. Consistent with this idea, Miro1 localizes to ER-mitochondria contact sites in mammalian cells, and Gem1 associates with ERMES subunits and regulates the number and size of ERMES foci in yeast (<a href=\"#bib6\">Kornmann et al., 2011</a>)."

                        "text": "The discovery of a novel role for ERMES and Gem1 proteins by Murley et al. raises new questions about mitochondrial division. First, does the ER facilitate constriction and, if so, how? One possibility is that an exchange of lipids at the ER\u2013mitochondria interface alters the content of the mitochondrial membrane in this specific region, and that this leads to the constriction required for Dnm1 helix formation. Alternatively, ERMES (or its as yet unidentified mammalian equivalent) may facilitate the generation of a constricting force via actin polymerization (<a href=\"#bib7\">Korobova et al., 2013</a>). And how is Dnm1 recruited to the constriction? Possibilities include via the ERMES complex itself or via some component of the ER that we don\u2019t yet know about. Or maybe the curvature of the membrane activates the proteins that help to recruit the Dnm1/Drp1 enzymes that form the helix around the constriction."
