Reaching resolutions higher than 3 \u00c5 is a prerequisite for structure-based drug design and for cryoEM to become widely interesting to pharmaceutical industries. We report here the structure of the 700 kDa <i>Thermoplasma acidophilum</i> 20S proteasome (T20S), determined at 2.8 \u00c5 resolution by single-particle cryoEM. The quality of the reconstruction enables identifying the rotameric conformation adopted by some amino-acid side chains (rotamers) and resolving ordered water molecules, in agreement with the expectations for crystal structures at similar resolutions. The results described in this manuscript demonstrate that single particle cryoEM is capable of competing with X-ray crystallography for determination of protein structures of suitable quality for rational drug design."

Reaching resolutions higher than 3 \u00c5 is a prerequisite for structure-based drug design and for cryoEM to become widely interesting to pharmaceutical industries. We report here the structure of the 700 kDa <i>Thermoplasma acidophilum</i> 20S proteasome (T20S), determined at 2.8 \u00c5 resolution by single-particle cryoEM. The quality of the reconstruction enables identifying the rotameric conformation adopted by some amino-acid side chains (rotamers) and resolving ordered water molecules, in agreement with the expectations for crystal structures at similar resolutions. The results described in this manuscript demonstrate that single particle cryoEM is capable of competing with X-ray crystallography for determination of protein structures of suitable quality for rational drug design."

This traps the protein in the shape it has in solution. High-energy electrons are then transmitted through the protein sample and their interaction with the atoms in the protein is recorded by a direct electron camera. The analysis of a large series of images recorded in this way can be used to determine the approximate positions of the atoms in the protein."

The fast read-out rate of these devices also allows for recording movies composed of multiple frames during typical image exposure times enabling correction of beam-induced sample motion and stage drift to reduce image blurring (<a href=\"#bib8\">Brilot et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Shigematsu and Sigworth, 2013</a>)."

These achievements constitute a tremendous leap forward for single-particle cryoEM. This method can now compete with X-ray crystallography for determination of protein structures at near-atomic resolution while also offering the unique advantage of enabling the characterization of heterogeneous or flexible protein complexes (<a href=\"#bib40\">Scheres et al., 2007</a>). High-resolution cryoEM can thus provide information about protein dynamics, which is key to understanding the functions of many macromolecular complexes."

This enzyme is a key component of the cell metabolism carrying out degradation of ubiquitinylated polypeptides to regulate the concentration of specific proteins as well as eliminating misfolded products. The T20S proteasome forms a 700 kDa complex comprising 14 \u03b1 and 14 \u03b2 subunits organized with D7 symmetry. Our reconstruction enables identification of the conformational preference of some amino-acid side chains (rotamers) and resolves ordered water molecules, in agreement with the expectations for crystal structures at similar resolutions. These outcomes constitute a significant step forward in overcoming the resolution limit achievable by single particle cryoEM, which can now provide protein structures of suitable quality for rational drug design."

Prior to beginning data collection, coma-free alignment was carried out to align the beam to the column optical axis with the assistance of a Zemlin tableau (<a href=\"#bib21\">Glaeser et al., 2011</a>). Automated data collection was carried out using Leginon (<a href=\"#bib43\">Suloway et al., 2005</a>) to control both the FEI Titan Krios microscope and the Gatan K2 Summit camera operated in \u2018super-resolution\u2019 mode. A subset of micrographs was automatically selected using a filter built into the Appion pipeline (<a href=\"#bib24\">Lander et al., 2009</a>) that accepts images based on the resolution limit to which Thon rings can be confidently identified in the image power spectra. This is achieved by computing cross-correlation coefficients (CC) between the 1-D radially averaged power spectrum of each micrograph and the calculated Contrast Transfer Function (CTF). Only those micrographs showing a CC \u2265 80% at a resolution of 4 \u00c5 or better were retained for further processing. One of these micrographs and its corresponding power spectrum are shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>. Using this selection criterion, 196 micrographs were selected, from which a total of 87,066 particles were automatically picked using FindEM (<a href=\"#bib33\">Roseman, 2004</a>).

This projection-matching refinement step provided a reconstruction at 2.98 \u00c5 resolution (estimated angular accuracy 1.3\u00b0) using all 38 movie frames and the full exposure of 53 e<sup>\u2212</sup>/\u00c5<sup>2</sup>. Previous measurements using catalase crystals have suggested that exposures as low as 11 e<sup>\u2212</sup>/\u00c5<sup>2</sup> might be necessary to attain 3 \u00c5 maps (<a href=\"#bib5\">Baker and Rubinstein, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Baker et al., 2010</a>). However, the loss of signal due to radiation must be balanced against the need for sufficient contrast in the images to allow for accurate alignment of the individual particles. Collecting data in movie mode using direct detectors has profoundly changed the way data is acquired and processed: many reported reconstructions have been obtained after eliminating sub-optimal frames (<a href=\"#bib25\">Li et al., 2013</a>) or applying a frequency-dependent weighting scheme to the frames (<a href=\"#bib37\">Scheres, 2014</a>). We emphasize that we were able to obtain a T20S reconstruction at 2.98 \u00c5 resolution using the full exposure of 53 e<sup>\u2212</sup>/\u00c5<sup>2</sup> and prior to weighting individual movie frames. We obtained similar results in determining the structure of an icosahedral virus to 3.7 \u00c5 resolution using an exposure of 38 e<sup>\u2212</sup>/\u00c5<sup>2</sup> with a microscope operated at 200 kV (<a href=\"#bib10\">Campbell et al., 2014</a>). These results contrast with previous measurements and demonstrate that useful high-resolution information may survive much higher exposures than previously thought for single particle cryoEM."

Plots of the relative B factor and C<sub>f</sub> intersect, derived from the Guinier plots for each single frame reconstruction, along with the corresponding frequency-dependent weights are presented in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>. The first frame of each movie featured a large movement in comparison with the following ones, which we and others interpret as the initial settling of beam-induced motion during exposure. This processing scheme improved the resolution of the reconstruction to 2.83 \u00c5 (estimated angular accuracy 1.0\u00b0), and this was supported by a significant enhancement of map quality."

Refinement of this smaller dataset under otherwise identical conditions produced a map with a slightly improved resolution of 2.81 \u00c5 (estimated angular accuracy 0.8\u00b0). This result suggests that analyzing the probability distributions over all orientations is a convenient way of discarding particles that are not contributing positively to the reconstruction (\u223c10,000 particles in this case).

The density is continuous from residues 13 to 233 and residues 1 to 203 for \u03b1 and \u03b2 subunits, respectively, with most side chains being resolved (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). In line with previous studies (<a href=\"#bib1\">Allegretti et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Bartesaghi et al., 2014</a>), many negatively charged residues had lost their carboxylate groups, likely due to radiation sensitivity. Our T20S reconstruction shows many features supporting the resolution claim of 2.8 \u00c5. Differences between the crystal structure and the cryoEM reconstruction are easily discernable at the level of the backbone and can be adjusted accordingly using real-space refinement procedures. The rotameric conformations of many amino-acid side chains are clearly visible in the electron potential map (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>) and reveal differences with a crystal structure of the T20S determined at 3.4 \u00c5 resolution (<a href=\"#bib27\">Lowe et al., 1995</a>). The quality of our reconstruction allows distinguishing between Phe and Tyr amino-acid residues based on the appearance of the density for their side chains (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>), as shown previously (<a href=\"#bib48\">Zhang et al., 2010</a>). The presence of a hydroxyl group para to the phenyl group of Tyr residues unambiguously establishes the presence of the Tyr residue as opposed to the Phe residue in our reconstruction. This level of resolvability is decisive for de novo building of atomic models of proteins of unknown structures."

The higher the resolution the more ordered water molecules are visible. Analysis of our T20S reconstruction at 2.8 \u00c5 resolution revealed that many ordered water molecules are resolved, in agreement with the estimated resolution. They are positioned in appropriate chemical environments and within hydrogen-bonding distance (2.8\u20133.5 \u00c5) of the surrounding atoms with which they interact. All the reconstructions described in this manuscript used the RELION gold standard refinement procedure (<a href=\"#bib39\">Scheres and Chen, 2012</a>). In this protocol, two half datasets are refined completely independently throughout, and after each cycle the new reference volumes are low-pass filtered to the resolution where the Fourier shell correlation (FSC) between the two volumes drops to 0.143 (<a href=\"#bib34\">Rosenthal and Henderson, 2003</a>), thus preventing overfitting of noise. As a result, the noise present in each independent map is not correlated. We were therefore able to cross-validate our assignment of water molecules as they are accounted for by the density in both maps derived from half datasets despite the reduced number of particle images contributing to each map (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) (<a href=\"#bib17\">DiMaio et al., 2013</a>). Finally, the 1.9 \u00c5 crystal structure of the T20S proteasome also unequivocally supports the assignment of the water molecules identified in the cryoEM map as an independent cross-validation metric (<a href=\"#bib20\">Forster et al., 2005</a>)."

Images of each square and each hole were examined by-eye for perceived ice thickness and only those which were judged to have very thin ice were selected for final high magnification exposures.

We used Rosetta tools recently developed for cryoEM (<a href=\"#bib15\">DiMaio et al. 2015</a>) to perform fragment rebuilding, torsion angles and cartesian minimization of atomic positions and B factor refinement. At each iteration, the best model was visually inspected in Coot and a few amino acid side chain rotamers were manually adjusted to best fit the density. Water molecules were also manually added using Coot after the first iteration of Rosetta refinement. Rosetta and Coot refinements were performed using a training map corresponding to one of the 2 maps generated by the gold-standard refinement procedure in Relion. The second map (testing map) was used only for calculation of FSC with the atomic model (<a href=\"#bib17\">DiMaio et al. 2013</a>). The quality of the final model was analyzed with Molprobity (<a href=\"#bib14\">Chen et al. 2010</a>). This elaborated description has been added to the manuscript."
