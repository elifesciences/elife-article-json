We designed selections for recombination between co-resident mitochondrial genomes in various heteroplasmic <i>Drosophila</i> lines. In four experimental settings, recombinant genomes became the sole or dominant genome in the progeny. Thus, selection uncovers occurrence of homologous recombination in <i>Drosophila</i> mtDNA and documents its functional benefit. Double-strand breaks enhanced recombination in the germ line and revealed somatic recombination. When the recombination partner was a diverged <i>D. melanogaster</i> genome or a genome from a different species such as <i>D. yakuba</i>, sequencing revealed long continuous stretches of exchange. In addition, the distribution of sequence polymorphisms in recombinants allowed us to map a selected trait to a particular region in the <i>Drosophila</i> mitochondrial genome. Thus, recombination can be harnessed to dissect function and evolution of mitochondrial genome."
