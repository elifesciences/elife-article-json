While numerous studies have examined genes underlying neoblast pluripotency, molecular pathways driving postmitotic fates remain poorly defined. In this study, we used transcriptional profiling of irradiation-sensitive and irradiation-insensitive cell populations and RNA interference (RNAi) functional screening to uncover markers and regulators of postmitotic progeny. We identified 32 new markers distinguishing two main epithelial progenitor populations and a planarian homolog to the MEX3 RNA-binding protein (<i>Smed-mex3-1</i>) as a key regulator of lineage progression. <i>mex3-1</i> was required for generating differentiated cells of multiple lineages, while restricting the size of the stem cell compartment. We also demonstrated the utility of using <i>mex3-1(RNAi)</i> animals to identify additional progenitor markers. These results identified <i>mex3-1</i> as a cell fate regulator, broadly required for differentiation, and suggest that <i>mex3-1</i> helps to mediate the balance between ASC self-renewal and commitment."

While numerous studies have examined genes underlying neoblast pluripotency, molecular pathways driving postmitotic fates remain poorly defined. In this study, we used transcriptional profiling of irradiation-sensitive and irradiation-insensitive cell populations and RNA interference (RNAi) functional screening to uncover markers and regulators of postmitotic progeny. We identified 32 new markers distinguishing two main epithelial progenitor populations and a planarian homolog to the MEX3 RNA-binding protein (<i>Smed-mex3-1</i>) as a key regulator of lineage progression. <i>mex3-1</i> was required for generating differentiated cells of multiple lineages, while restricting the size of the stem cell compartment. We also demonstrated the utility of using <i>mex3-1(RNAi)</i> animals to identify additional progenitor markers. These results identified <i>mex3-1</i> as a cell fate regulator, broadly required for differentiation, and suggest that <i>mex3-1</i> helps to mediate the balance between ASC self-renewal and commitment."

One way this can be accomplished is if at every stem cell division, only one of the daughter cells remains a stem cell, while the other becomes specialized.

These RNA molecules could also be used as markers that identify which cells have taken on a more specialized form. Using techniques called transcriptional profiling and RNA interference, Zhu et al. identified 32 new markers that indicate that the neoblasts have started to specialize into epithelial cells: cells that line the surfaces of many structures in the body. Further investigation revealed that one gene, called <i>mex3-1</i>, is needed for many specialized cell types\u2014not just epithelial cells\u2014to mature from neoblasts in the flatworms.

This feat is achieved through a delicate balance of proliferation and differentiation, in order to maintain a stable stem cell population while replacing the exact number and type of cells lost to cell turnover or injury. This requires inherent asymmetry in stem cell lineages, with some daughter cells retaining stem cell identity while others become committed to differentiate (<a href=\"#bib50\">Rambhatla et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Sherley, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Simons and Clevers, 2011</a>). Asymmetry in cell fate outcomes in stem cell lineages is known to happen in several ways. Asymmetry can be largely intrinsic, driven by the asymmetric distribution of RNA and proteins that drive different fates (<a href=\"#bib10\">Bossing et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Doe, 1996</a>, <a href=\"#bib17\">2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Doe and Bowerman, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Bayraktar et al., 2010</a>). For example, in <i>Drosophila</i> neuroblasts, the cell fate determinant Prospero is physically segregated into the daughter cell of a neuroblast division, where it drives differentiation and suppresses stem cell identity (<a href=\"#bib19\">Doe et al., 1991</a>). In contrast, the size of the stem cell population can be controlled almost entirely by extrinsic means, such as in the mammalian intestinal crypt where paneth cells use WNT/Lgr5 signaling to maintain stem cell identity (<a href=\"#bib76\">Snippert et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Sato et al., 2011</a>). As the paneth cell niche expands in colon cancer, so too does the stem cell population (<a href=\"#bib15\">de Lau et al., 2007</a>). Other stem cell types can use a combination of mechanisms, such as in the mammalian postnatal cortex of the brain where Hedgehog signaling maintains stem cell identity, and asymmetric segregation of RNA-binding protein complexes and cellular processes determines cell fate choice (<a href=\"#bib36\">Machold et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Miller and Gauthier-Fisher, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Vessey et al., 2012</a>). For both regenerative medicine and cancer biology, elucidating how non-stem cell fates are specified is a fundamental aspect of understanding the mechanisms of stem cell lineage development."

Furthermore, recently neoblasts were divided into three major subclasses (sigma, zeta, gamma) based on transcriptional analyses, one of which generates non-dividing progenitors/progeny for the epithelium (zeta) and another postulated to be an intestinal-restricted subclass (gamma) (<a href=\"#bib79\">van Wolfswinkel et al., 2014</a>). As neoblasts are the only mitotic cell type in planarians, they can be selectively ablated by irradiation, and over time, the immediate progeny of neoblasts eventually disappear as well (<a href=\"#bib53\">Reddien et al., 2005b</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Eisenhoffer et al., 2008</a>). Using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis of irradiated animals stained with Hoechst, two cell populations can be discerned that are lost compared to non-irradiated animals: the \u2018X1\u2019 gate, which represents cells in the cell cycle with &gt;2C DNA; and the \u2018X2\u2019 gate, which registers as a &lt;2C DNA population due to Hoechst efflux. The remaining irradiation-insensitive (Xins) cells are assumed to be postmitotic differentiated cell types possessing 2C DNA (<a href=\"#bib53\">Reddien et al., 2005b</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Hayashi et al., 2006</a>). Studies have shown that the X1 population is &gt;90% <i>piwi-1</i><sup><i>+</i></sup>, and this gate has been used as the stem cell fraction in comparative transcriptomic studies (<a href=\"#bib53\">Reddien et al., 2005b</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Eisenhoffer et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Abril et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Sandmann et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Labbe et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Onal et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Resch et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Solana et al., 2012</a>). The X2 cell population is only 10\u201320% <i>piwi-1</i><sup>+</sup> and is thought to be enriched with immediate postmitotic progeny of neoblasts. This notion is supported by the finding that the five known markers of postmitotic progeny (<i>prog-1</i>, <i>prog-2</i>, and <i>AGAT-1/2/3</i>), predicted to label epithelial progenitors, are most highly expressed in the X2 cell fraction based on RNA-deep sequencing (RNAseq) (<a href=\"#bib21\">Eisenhoffer et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Labbe et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Onal et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">van Wolfswinkel et al., 2014</a>). Additionally, other markers that associate with putative committed progenitor cells of the gut, brain, and eyes are also enriched in this cell fraction (<i>hnf4</i>, <i>chat</i>, and <i>sp6-9</i>, respectively) (<a href=\"#bib83\">Wagner et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Lapan and Reddien, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Cowles et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Scimone et al., 2014</a>).

                        "text": "Here, we hypothesized that regulators that drive stem cells toward postmitotic fates will be highly enriched in the stem cell progeny-associated X2 FACS fraction. Thus, we selected the top 100 transcripts enriched in this FACS gate, as well as 20 that were irradiation-sensitive with no X1 or X2 enrichment, to explore as putative markers or regulators. We found that while X2-enriched genes represented a heterogeneous mixture of cell types, transcripts expressed in epithelial progenitors comprised the predominant gene signature in the X2 fraction. We identified 32 new progeny markers and demonstrated that they are expressed predominantly in either <i>prog-1/2</i><sup>+</sup> or <i>AGAT-1</i><sup>+</sup> epithelial progenitors. In addition, <i>prog-1</i> and <i>prog-2</i> represent members of a larger gene family of unknown function, expressed throughout this epithelial lineage. Through RNA interference (RNAi) screening of the 120 candidate transcripts, we identified a homolog to the RNA-binding protein MEX3 (<i>Smed-mex3-1</i>) as a critical regulator of postmitotic stem cell progeny. Knockdown of <i>mex3-1</i> completely abolishes regenerative ability and halts the production of <i>prog-1/2</i><sup>+</sup> and <i>AGAT-1</i><sup>+</sup> postmitotic progeny populations. <i>piwi-1</i><sup><i>+</i></sup> stem cells concomitantly increase in number, an increase that was observed in all three neoblast subclasses. Finally, <i>mex3-1(RNAi)</i> worms have impaired contribution to tissue turnover, as evidenced by drastically reduced production of lineage-restricted neoblast descendants and diminished cell addition towards multiple tissue types, in addition to the epithelium. These results suggest that <i>mex3-1</i> functions to maintain asymmetry in stem cell lineage progression by promoting postmitotic fates and suppressing self-renewal. Due to the well-known function of MEX3 in mediating asymmetric cell fates during <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> embryogenesis (<a href=\"#bib20\">Draper et al., 1996</a>), we propose that <i>Smed-mex3-1</i> mediates a similar process in planarian stem cell lineages."

This identified 2839 X1 and 1512 X2 transcripts with a p-value \u2264 0.01 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). It is important to note that X1 and X2 cells shared the majority of their transcriptional profiles (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>), and <i>bona fide</i> progeny markers can be highly expressed in the X1 fraction, while <i>bona fide</i> stem cell markers can be highly expressed in the X2 fraction (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>). Therefore, to be considered X2-enriched, we imposed the additional criterion that the expression ratio of X2/X1 was &gt;1, to exclude transcripts jointly expressed in both irradiation-sensitive populations. This eliminated previously known stem cell genes, such as <i>piwi-1</i> and <i>-2</i>, <i>PCNA</i> (proliferating cell nuclear antigen), and <i>cyclinB</i> (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>; 8th, 45th, 57th, and 80th highest enriched X2 genes, respectively), and reduced the total number of enriched X2 genes to 735 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>) (<a href=\"#bib43\">Orii et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Reddien et al., 2005b</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Eisenhoffer et al., 2008</a>). Finally, we observed 66 transcripts that were highly expressed in wild-type animals, yet exhibited low counts in irradiated worms and in both X1 and X2 cell fractions (WT<sup>high</sup>X<sup>low</sup>, <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1</a>). From the remaining 735 X2-specific genes as well as these 66 other irradiation-sensitive transcripts, we hypothesized that these represented multiple types of irradiation-sensitive progenitor cells. We next cloned the top 100 X2-specific and 20 WT<sup>high</sup>X<sup>low</sup> transcripts for expression and functional analyses (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>). Genes were annotated based on the top BLAST hit in mouse, when the Expect value passed the threshold of e<sup>\u22125</sup>."

Combined with evidence from BrdU-labeling studies, the early and late progeny populations have been proposed to reflect a spatiotemporal progression along one lineage of ASC differentiation destined for the epithelium, such that <i>prog-1/2</i> expression represents the transition state between neoblasts (potentially zeta-neoblasts) and <i>AGAT-1</i><sup><i>+</i></sup> cells (<a href=\"#bib21\">Eisenhoffer et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Pearson and S\u00e1nchez Alvarado, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib79\">van Wolfswinkel et al., 2014</a>).

Interestingly, all WT<sup>high</sup>X<sup>low</sup> genes grouped as late progeny, and moreover, were the only genes with detectable expression at 7 days post-irradiation.

However, these results could similarly arise from defective maintenance and survival of progeny, thus, we examined levels of apoptosis with TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling) during phenotypic progression. Quantification of TUNEL showed that <i>mex3-1(RNAi)</i> animals had comparable levels of cell death to control worms up until 9 days after RNAi, but significantly higher levels from 12 days and onward (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). Given that progeny gene expression was mostly ablated by 6 days after RNAi, we concluded that the loss of progeny populations was not attributed to progeny cell death. The cause of the late rise in cell death remains unclear but is coincident with when morphological homeostatic phenotypes begin to manifest and may be a secondary effect of declining animal health. We next investigated whether impaired stem cell proliferation was the underlying cause of reduced progeny production and performed time-course analysis of phosphorylated histone H3 immunolabeling (H3P). We observed significantly increased levels of proliferation in <i>mex3-1(RNAi)</i> worms at every time point examined (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>), which suggested that stem cell division was not impeded by <i>mex3-1</i> knockdown."

Worms pulsed at either 6 or 9 days after RNAi and fixed 24 hr later showed significantly increased numbers of total EdU-labeled cells in <i>mex3-1(RNAi)</i> animals compared to controls (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>), demonstrating that during phenotypic progression, a greater number of cells were entering the cell cycle. FACS profiles of <i>mex3-1(RNAi)</i> animals at day 9 revealed relatively normal proportions of cells in both the X1 and X2 gates (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>), further evidence that stem cells were progressing through the cell cycle and not arrested at 4C DNA in the X1 gate. Worms exposed to sublethal doses of irradiation initially lose the vast majority of their stem cells and immediate postmitotic descendants; over time, the stem cell and progeny populations gradually recover, offering an easily quantifiable approach to assess both self-renewal and differentiation (<a href=\"#bib82\">Wagner et al., 2012</a>).

By 6 days after RNAi, we observed highly significant increases in the number of <i>piwi-1</i><sup>+</sup> stem cells in <i>mex3-1(RNAi)</i> animals compared to controls, which rose to a 50% increase by day 12 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>, <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The expansion of <i>piwi-1</i><sup>+</sup> stem cells after <i>mex3-1</i> knockdown could either reflect a global increase in all stem cell subclasses or reflect an increase in a specific subclass (zeta-, sigma-, and gamma-neoblasts) (<a href=\"#bib79\">van Wolfswinkel et al., 2014</a>). To ascertain whether subclasses were selectively affected, we quantified the number of <i>piwi-1</i><sup>+</sup> stem cells belonging to each subclass using the following probes: <i>zfp-1</i> for the zeta subclass, <i>hnf4</i> for the gamma subclass, and a pooled mix of <i>soxP-1</i> and <i>soxP-2</i> for the sigma subclass. Assessment at 12 days after RNAi revealed that all three subclasses were significantly increased by approximately 50% in <i>mex3-1(RNAi)</i> animals compared to controls (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). Together, these results demonstrated that the failure to specify epithelial progenitors in <i>mex3-1(RNAi)</i> animals was not due to loss of zeta-neoblasts, and suggested that the expansion of the stem cell pools was due to an imbalance in cell fates favoring stem cell self-renewal over differentiation."

Given that <i>mex3-1(RNAi)</i> animals were unable to produce any regenerative blastema, we hypothesized that <i>mex3-1</i> may have a crucial role in the broad specification of multiple lineages. To examine this possibility, we assessed <i>mex3-1(RNAi)</i> worms for changes in the number of lineage-specified neoblast progeny of other tissue types in various body regions (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). As PIWI-1 protein persists in immediate postmitotic stem cell descendants for up to 72 hr (<a href=\"#bib25\">Guo et al., 2006</a>), co-localization of PIWI-1 with tissue-specific markers was used to identify lineage-restricted neoblast descendants, encompassing undifferentiated progenitors and newly differentiating cells. The neural genes, <i>chat</i> and <i>coe</i>, eye-specific transcription factor <i>ovo</i>, pharyngeal marker <i>FoxA</i>, and protonephridial marker <i>six1/2-2</i> were used as markers to indicate differentiation toward their respective tissues (<a href=\"#bib73\">Scimone et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib83\">Wagner et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Lapan and Reddien, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Cowles et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Adler et al., 2014</a>). Quantification of lineage-restricted neoblast progeny in intact <i>mex3-1(RNAi)</i> worms 12 days after RNAi showed significant reductions in all examined cell types (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>). We observed that virtually all <i>chat</i><sup>+</sup>PIWI-1<sup>+</sup> cells expressed <i>mex3-1</i> (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), suggesting a direct role for <i>mex3-1</i> in regulating differentiation outside the epithelial lineage. Concordant with decreased production of lineage-restricted neoblast progeny, we also observed that 5 days following labeling with BrdU, the entry of new cells into brain, intestine, and pharynx was significantly decreased in <i>mex3-1(RNAi)</i> animals (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>).

To determine whether <i>mex3-1</i> knockdown resulted in a global impediment in generating postmitotic cells, we quantified the proportion of <i>piwi-1</i><sup>\u2212</sup>PIWI-1<sup>+</sup> cells, which are thought to represent immediate stem cell progeny that have permanently exited the cell cycle.

By RNAseq, all were irradiation-sensitive but not X2-enriched (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>, <a href=\"#SD4-data\">Supplementary file 4</a>) and thus could be classified as WT<sup>high</sup>X<sup>low</sup>. We found that 20/21 transcripts produced a <i>prog</i>-like pattern in control worms and exhibited severely reduced expression in <i>mex3-1(RNAi)</i> worms, as anticipated from RNAseq (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>, <a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). The remaining transcript, <i>SmedASXL_059179</i>, was highly expressed near the proximal end of the pharynx, throughout the pharynx proper, and was similarly dependent on <i>mex3-1</i> for its expression (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>). Three transcripts were confirmed to be irradiation-sensitive by WISH (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>), and two of these were verified to be additional late progeny markers based on their high degree of co-localization with <i>AGAT-1</i> expression (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). We predicted that <i>SmedASXL_059179</i><sup>+</sup> cells may represent a pharyngeal progenitor cell type, and indeed, we observed PIWI-1<sup>+</sup><i>SmedASXL_059179</i><sup>+</sup> cells near the proximal base of the pharynx (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>).

Overall, these results further support a role for <i>mex3-1</i> as a critical regulator of differentiation toward multiple lineages and also demonstrate the utility of transcriptional analysis of <i>mex3-1(RNAi)</i> in identifying additional markers of tissue-specific progenitor populations, as an alternative to the criteria of irradiation-sensitivity and FACS localization."

Relatively little was known about the X2 FACS cell fraction, with the exception that it expresses a disproportionate number of transcription factors and shares most of its gene signature with the X1 fraction, and the few known stem cell progeny markers are most highly expressed in this fraction (<a href=\"#bib31\">Labbe et al., 2012</a>). We reasoned here that investigating more genes specific to the X2 fraction could yield many markers and regulators for other tissue-specific progeny types. We found that transcripts enriched in the progeny-associated X2 FACS gate were expressed in a variety of cell types and not necessarily in stem cell progeny. Although transcripts with unique tissue-specific and non-stem cell expression patterns were uncovered and appeared to be potential candidates for novel progenitor types, it is now clear that the epithelial lineage has the strongest bias in terms of sequencing numbers. In total, we describe 32 new markers for early and late epithelial progenitors. Combined with the revelation that zeta-neoblasts are the largest known lineage-restricted stem cell subclass in planarians, we conclude that epithelial progenitors are the predominant output of stem cells, most likely reflecting highest turnover needs as well as molecular complexity of this organ."

MEX3 is an RNA-binding translational repressor discovered in <i>C. elegans</i> with embryonic and post-embryonic developmental roles (<a href=\"#bib20\">Draper et al., 1996</a>). MEX3 is a fundamental regulator of asymmetry, mediating one of the earliest steps of cell fate determination in <i>C. elegans</i> by restricting expression of the cell fate determinant <i>pal-1</i> transcription factor to the posterior blastomere of the early embryo (<a href=\"#bib20\">Draper et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Huang et al., 2002</a>). In adult <i>C. elegans</i>, MEX3 participates in the maintenance of germline stem cells (GSCs) by promoting proliferation, and interestingly, is not required for GSCs to differentiate and undergo meiosis (<a href=\"#bib5\">Ariz et al., 2009</a>). Four <i>mex3</i> homologs (<i>MexA-D</i>) are present in vertebrates, which remain poorly characterized (<a href=\"#bib11\">Buchet-Poyau et al., 2007</a>). Recent work on MEX3A in murine intestinal cell culture showed that the master intestinal differentiation factor <i>Cdx2</i>, one of the vertebrate homologs of <i>pal-1</i>, is a target of MEX3A translational inhibition, and furthermore, MEX3A overexpression increased levels of intestinal stem cell markers such as <i>Bmi1</i> and <i>Lgr5</i> (<a href=\"#bib49\">Pereira et al., 2013</a>). Though the role of MEX3A in intestinal stem cell fate in vivo remains to be fully explored, these findings combined with our results in planarians suggest a conserved ancestral function for <i>mex3</i> genes in cell fate choice."

As both <i>C. elegans</i> and vertebrate MEX3 proteins have been shown to be translational repressors, it is likely that this molecular function has been conserved in planarians.

Total RNA was purified and poly-A-selected cDNA libraries were prepped using the TruSeq kits from Illumina. This new X2 sample was multiplexed together with a new X1 and Irradiated control and each was sequenced to a depth of &gt;63 million single-end 50 base pair reads on an Illumina HiSeq2500 with v4 chemistry. Raw sequence data were uploaded to NCBI GEO under accession number GSE68581. Each sample was aligned to the transcriptome under NCBI BioProject PRJNA215411 using Bowtie2 with no sequence trimming. Mapped reads per million reads (CPM) of each transcript was calculated. Note that kilobase-length of each transcript was not taken into account because in any expression ratio, the length scaling factor cancels out and no inter-transcript comparisons were performed.

RNAi experiments were performed using previously described expression constructs and HT115 bacteria (<a href=\"#bib39\">Newmark et al., 2003</a>). Briefly, bacteria were grown to an O.D. 600 of 0.8 and induced with 1 mM isopropyl \u03b2-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for 2 hr. Bacteria were pelleted and mixed with liver paste at a ratio of 500 \u03bcl of liver per 100 ml of original culture volume. Bacterial pellets were thoroughly mixed into the liver paste and frozen as aliquots. The negative control RNAi was the <i>unc22</i> sequence from <i>C. elegans</i> as previously described (<a href=\"#bib52\">Reddien et al., 2005a</a>). For the screening of all genes in this study, RNAi food was fed to 7-day starved experimental worms every third day for five feedings. Subsequent functional analyses for <i>mex3-1</i> were performed with one feed unless noted otherwise. Time points in figures denote the number of feeds for each gene as well as the number of days after the last feed. For example, 1fd12 corresponds to one RNAi feeding and 12 days after that feeding. Amputations were performed 6 days after the final feeding unless noted otherwise. All animals used for immunostaining were 3\u20134 mm in length and size-matched between experimental and control worms."

Analysis of genes enriched in this population identified 32 new markers of postmitotic neoblast progeny differentiating into epidermal fates. Additionally, through RNAi screening of these genes, <i>mex3-1</i> was identified as essential for differentiation into multiple planarian cell lineages (eye, neuronal lineages, and epithelium). <i>Mex3-1</i> inhibition decreased numbers of post-mitotic progenitors cells and concomitantly increased numbers of proliferating neoblasts, including three lineages specified within that population, causing failure of regeneration and tissue homeostasis. RNA-seq from <i>mex3-1(RNAi)</i> animals confirmed that <i>mex3-1</i> is a master regulator of genes expressed in post-mitotic neoblast progeny and also identified novel markers of differentiating cells in planarians. MEX3 proteins can repress translation to influence differentiation and asymmetric cell division. Still few molecules have been identified that control differentiation and cell cycle exit in planarians, and the identification of <i>mex3-1</i> in particular suggests the essentiality of asymmetric cell division in forming progenitor populations."

First, that <i>piwi-1</i> RNA is always transcribed throughout the cell cycle of cycling stem cells, which has never been demonstrated. Second, it has been shown that about 10-20% of sorted X1\u2019s could not be labeled for <i>piwi-1</i> RNA in previous publications (Reddien, 2005, and Eisenhoffer, 2008), which may skew results if those unlabeled dividing cells were still PIWI-1+."

As seen at the day 20 lineage stains, epithelial post-mitotic progeny begin to reappear. As this rebalance of making progeny is restored (perhaps asymmetry restored to the lineage), H3P levels are seen to return close normal. Again, this is not due to a loss of stem cells as it is in <i>p53(RNAi)</i>, where the H3P levels go to zero. We attribute the fact that 100% of the animals still die to the fact that progeny have been absent for too long for the animal to recover.

(2011)</a> study cited by the reviewer that SMEDWI-1+<i>chat+</i> cells (which the paper states are \u201cenriched in brain regions and often adopted a non-neoblast cell morphology that included long axon-like cytoplasmic processes\u201d) are \u201cfully integrated into tissues\u201d as the reviewer suggests. Even the authors of that paper refer to these cells as \u201cdifferentiating\u201d, not \u201cdifferentiated\u201d. Similarly, in Scimone et al<i>.</i> (2011), SMEDWI-1<sup>+</sup> cells which co-express both a transcription factor (such as six1/2-2) and a differentiated marker (such as CA or cubulin) were referred to as \u201ccells in intermediate stages between precursors and differentiated cells\u201d."
