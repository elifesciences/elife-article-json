                    "text": "Mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake, a process crucial for bioenergetics and Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, is catalyzed by the mitochondrial calcium uniporter. The uniporter is a multi-subunit Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel, with the Ca<sup>2+</sup> pore formed by the MCU protein and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent activation mediated by MICU subunits. Recently, a mitochondrial inner membrane protein EMRE was identified as a uniporter subunit absolutely required for Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeation. However, the molecular mechanism and regulatory purpose of EMRE remain largely unexplored. Here, we determine the transmembrane orientation of EMRE, and show that its known MCU-activating function is mediated by the interaction of transmembrane helices from both proteins. We also reveal a second function of EMRE: to maintain tight MICU regulation of the MCU pore, a role that requires EMRE to bind MICU1 using its conserved C-terminal polyaspartate tail. This dual functionality of EMRE ensures that all transport-competent uniporters are tightly regulated, responding appropriately to a dynamic intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> landscape."

The uniporter is a multi-subunit Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel, with the Ca<sup>2+</sup> pore formed by the MCU protein and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent activation mediated by MICU subunits. Recently, a mitochondrial inner membrane protein EMRE was identified as a uniporter subunit absolutely required for Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeation. However, the molecular mechanism and regulatory purpose of EMRE remain largely unexplored. Here, we determine the transmembrane orientation of EMRE, and show that its known MCU-activating function is mediated by the interaction of transmembrane helices from both proteins. We also reveal a second function of EMRE: to maintain tight MICU regulation of the MCU pore, a role that requires EMRE to bind MICU1 using its conserved C-terminal polyaspartate tail. This dual functionality of EMRE ensures that all transport-competent uniporters are tightly regulated, responding appropriately to a dynamic intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> landscape."

Studies in the 1960s and '70s established that mitochondria from most eukaryotes, except for certain yeast species, can take up large quantities of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the cytosol into the matrix through a mechanism that is membrane potential dependent and strongly inhibited by ruthenium compounds such as Ru360 (<a href=\"#bib4\">Carafoli and Lehninger, 1971</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Deluca and Engstrom, 1961</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Ying et al., 1991</a>). A few years ago, the field witnessed a groundbreaking achievement \u2014 identification of the <i>MCU</i> gene (<a href=\"#bib2\">Baughman et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">De Stefani et al., 2011</a>). The 35-kDa MCU protein oliogomerizes with unknown stoichiometry to form a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-selective pore (<a href=\"#bib2\">Baughman et al., 2011</a>). MCU possesses two transmembrane helices (TMHs) connected by a short loop that hosts a signature sequence (DIME) thought to contribute to a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-selective permeation site. The N- and C-terminal regions of MCU are exposed to the mitochondrial matrix, each with a coiled-coil sequence of unknown function."

In humans, MICU1 has two additional homologues, MICU2 and the neuron-specific MICU3 (<a href=\"#bib26\">Plovanich et al., 2013</a>). The MICUs serve as the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensing gate that confers Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependence to opening of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-selective pore (<a href=\"#bib5\">Csordas et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Mallilankaraman et al., 2012</a>). In resting cellular conditions, where cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> is low, MICUs shut the pore to prevent excessive Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx into the matrix, a dangerous process that could diminish inner membrane potential and trigger apoptotic cell death. Transient elevation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> to the low \u03bcM range, detected by EF-hands in MICUs, releases this inhibition to open the channel (<a href=\"#bib5\">Csordas et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Kamer and Mootha, 2014</a>).

EMRE possesses a single TMH and a highly conserved C-terminal polyaspartate tail, typically composed of one glutamate followed by 5\u20137 aspartates.

The question naturally arises: what might be the physiological importance for MCU to become strictly dependent on EMRE for function in humans?

Two alternative strategies \u2013 directed mass-tagging and MCU-EMRE fusion construction - establish that EMRE exposes its N-terminal region to the matrix and C-terminus to the intermembrane space (IMS). Mutagenesis screening and domain-interaction analysis further demonstrate that EMRE supports Ca<sup>2+</sup> transport by using its TMH to bind to MCU through its first TMH (TMH1). Moreover, EMRE also interacts with MICU1 via its C-terminal polyaspartate tail, a molecular contact that turns out to be crucial to retain MICUs in the uniporter complex to gate the MCU pore. These results lead to a molecular model wherein the dual 'MCU-activating' and 'MICU-retaining' functionalities of EMRE together play a crucial role in orchestrating uniporter responses to intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling."

The fusion construct was tested in ME-KO cells, where it was expressed as a full-length protein detectable by both MCU and EMRE antibodies (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). As with WT MCU, PEGM fails to modify any of the five native cysteines in the N-terminus without detergent pretreatment (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>), thus implying that the fusion protein is inserted homogeneously into the inner membrane in a proper N<sub>in</sub>-C<sub>out</sub> orientation.

The results (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) highlight a rather clean segregation of Trp-sensitive vs insensitive positions on a helical-wheel diagram. In particular, Trp substitution at G81 or S85 completely eliminates Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake via the uniporter complex. These two residues belong to a conserved Gxxx[G/A/S] motif (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>), frequently found to mediate packing of TMHs in membrane protein structures (<a href=\"#bib29\">Russ and Engelman, 2000</a>)."

WT EMRE is captured by MCU, but disruption of the GxxxS region by the G81W or S85W mutation prevents this association, while Trp substitution of residues elsewhere on the TMH does not (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>). These results taken together show that EMRE binds to MCU using a Gxxx[G/A/S] motif in the C-terminal half of its TMH, and that this binding is necessary to activate the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-conducting pore in the uniporter complex."

We therefore introduced each of the eight high-impact Trp substitutions (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>) into <i>D. discoideum</i> MCU to test the mutational effect in ME-KO cells. The results (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) show that six of these mutations are functionally disruptive while two are fully active; these two active mutants correspond to L240W and A241W in TMH1 of human MCU, suggesting that these residues in human MCU contact EMRE."

We chose F77 in EMRE to test this idea, as it is on the same helical face as the GxxxS sequence identified above, and since the large Phe residue enables substantial shortening of the side chain. Accordingly, F77A EMRE was coexpressed with each of the 6 functionally defective MCU Trp mutants of TMH1. This EMRE mutant, which forms a functional channel with WT MCU, rescues Ca<sup>2+</sup> transport with A241W but not with any of the other mutants (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Similarly, the impaired uniporter function induced by A241F in MCU is rescued by F77A in EMRE. Co-IP experiments further show that A241F (or A241W) MCU pulls down F77A but not WT EMRE (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). These results demonstrate that the combination of a large and a small side chain (F or W, A) on EMRE position 77 and MCU position 241 leads to proper transport function regardless of which protein the residues occupy. This 'side chain swap' experiment argues strongly that A241 in MCU\u2019s TMH1 is in close proximity to F77 in the TMH of EMRE in the uniporter complex."

These results present an opportunity to test which of ceMCU\u2019s two TMHs is responsible for discriminating against hEMRE. Accordingly, we produced two MCU chimeras, with TMH1 or TMH2 of ceMCU substituted by the corresponding region in hMCU. The chimera containing hMCU TMH1, though well expressed, is transport-inactive in the presence of either hEMRE or ceEMRE. The chimera containing hMCU TMH2, however, is activated by ceEMRE, while remaining unresponsive to hEMRE (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>).

PEGM readily reacts with MICU1 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>), showing that this subunit resides on the outer, IMS side of the inner membrane. Two issues regarding this experiment require comment. First, the PEGM-treated sample appears as a smear instead of a defined band, consistent with heterogeneous modification of the protein's 7 native cysteines. Second, a significant western-blot signal is observed roughly corresponding to MICU1 dimers, stable in SDS-PAGE conditions, as reported previously (<a href=\"#bib25\">Patron et al., 2014</a>). This signal also shifts upward after PEGM treatment, suggesting that MICU1 dimers or higher oligomers are also localized to the IMS.

If so, disrupting the MICU1-EMRE interaction would yield a population of channels free of MICUs, allowing unregulated, constitutive Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeation from the cytosol into the matrix. To examine this idea, we quantify MCU-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake by following accumulation of the <sup>45</sup>Ca<sup>2+</sup> radioisotope into mitochondria in digitonin-permeabilized cells, an approach that allows free extramitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> to be buffered at well-defined submicromolar concentrations without sacrificing sensitivity."

At low Ca<sup>2+</sup>, uptake is suppressed in mitochondria hosting WT or \u0394N-EMRE, but is enhanced over 50-fold by MICU1 knockdown (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>). In contrast, Ca<sup>2+</sup> rapidly enters mitochondria containing \u0394C-EMRE, which cannot bind MICU1, and the rate is only trivially increased after MICU1 KD (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G</a>).

The present work focuses mainly on EMRE, the least understood component of the channel complex. Impressed by the functional dependence on EMRE arising as metazoan uniporters evolved, we have endeavored to enrich our current view of the uniporter subunits and the physiological purposes of the domain interactions mediating their assembly. Results here establish (1) EMRE orientation in the inner membrane, (2) the molecular contacts governing EMRE interactions with MCU and MICU1, (3) the disposition of the MICU1-MICU2 complex on the outer surface of the inner-membrane, and (4) the functional purpose of the EMRE-MICU1 interaction.

Once the wave hits mitochondria, Ca<sup>2+</sup> can rise above ~1\u2009\u03bcM, activating the uniporter to catalyze rapid Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry into the mitochondrial matrix. Mitochondria can therefore serve as a buffer to shape intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals (<a href=\"#bib9\">Demaurex et al., 2009</a>). Moreover, Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry boosts ATP output by accelerating the citric acid cycle, but excessive, sustained Ca<sup>2+</sup> accumulation in the matrix triggers caspase-dependent apoptosis (<a href=\"#bib28\">Rizzuto et al., 2012</a>). Thus, mitochondria can also decode Ca<sup>2+</sup> stimulation as either metabolic or death signals. Failure of the uniporter to appropriately respond to Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals would perturb these crucial physiological processes and could also produce other serious problems. For instance, if the uniporter fails to stay inactive under resting conditions, the large negative inner membrane potential of energized mitochondria would drive continual Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. Removing these Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions requires the action of Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchangers at a cost of 3\u2009H<sup>+</sup> entering into the matrix for each Ca<sup>2+</sup> expelled. Unregulated, \u2018leaky\u2019 uniporters would therefore divert protons away from the F<sub>o</sub>F<sub>1</sub>-ATPase, partially uncoupling electron transport from ATP synthesis."

It is now clear that the mitochondrial response to physiological Ca<sup>2+</sup> is mediated by the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensing gate formed by the MICU subunits that engage the pore-lining MCU proteins at the external face of the inner membrane. This modular design comes with a potential danger: that the gating and ion-conducing subunits might dissociate sporadically, producing unregulated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. How could this problem be prevented? It is likely that MICU1 has a high intrinsic affinity to MCU, since at least part of the MICU1-MCU complex survives lengthy co-IP experiments. Moreover, diffusion of MICUs confined to two dimensions within the inner membrane raises the local density of MICUs near the MCU pore. These factors combined could in principle reduce the population of MICU-free, unregulated uniporters \u2014 a condition that might be particularly helpful to protist and plant mitochondria, where MCU and MICUs are the only components of the uniporter complex."

A crucial finding here is that the presence of EMRE in the uniporter complex ensures that the channel conducts Ca<sup>2+</sup> only when cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> rises above resting levels. This requires EMRE to use its polyaspartate tail to bind MICU1, as if it functions as 'molecular glue' to prevent dissociation of MICU1 from the MCU pore, a circumstance that would produce catastrophic Ca<sup>2+</sup> leakage (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). Alternatively, EMRE might allosterically transmit the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal from MICUs to the pore; in this case, disrupting EMRE-MICU1 interaction would also prevent MICUs from properly gating the Ca<sup>2+</sup> pathway. We consider this allosteric scenario unlikely, as the mechanism by which MICU1 gates MCU probably evolved in early eukaryotic evolution when EMRE was absent."

Under these situations, a population of EMRE-free uniporters could arise. These channels would also lack MICUs, which would no longer be EMRE-linked to the pore.

First, single-channel recordings in planar lipid bilayers have been used to argue that the human MCU protein alone is sufficient to reconstitute a Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel without EMRE (<a href=\"#bib6\">De Stefani et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Patron et al., 2014</a>). These recordings, however, obtained with in vitro-expressed protein of uncharacterized purity, show channel properties vastly different from uniporter currents directly patch-recorded from intact mitoplasts (<a href=\"#bib19\">Kirichok et al., 2004</a>). Second, a recent study (<a href=\"#bib32\">Vais et al., 2016</a>) using protease digestion argues that EMRE adopts a N<sub>out</sub>-C<sub>in</sub> orientation, opposite to that deduced here. Interpretation of the assay, however, is based on an unjustified assumption that the N- and C- termini of EMRE are digested at similar rates. In contrast, our results are supported by two lines of direct and independent evidence \u2013 mass tagging of substituted cysteines and the functional competence of the MCU-EMRE fusion protein (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). This same study also claims that EMRE uses its C-terminal tail to sense matrix Ca<sup>2+</sup>, producing a biphasic response of uniporter activity to matrix Ca<sup>2+</sup>. However, this phenomenon, to our best knowledge, has not been observed in any mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake experiments in the literature or in previous patch recordings (<a href=\"#bib19\">Kirichok et al., 2004</a>). We also note a recent study appearing when our work was under review (<a href=\"#bib34\">Yamamoto et al., 2016</a>) that deduced, using an epitope-tagging method, a N<sub>in</sub>-C<sub>out</sub> EMRE orientation fully consistent with our results. That study also shows that a Pro-to-Ala substitution 3 residues N-terminal to the predicted TMH - a region left unperturbed in our 22-residue deletion \u0394N-EMRE construct - abolishes EMRE-MCU interaction. Thus, a small portion in the N-terminus of EMRE near the TMH might also be involved in binding MCU."

They approach the relevant orientation and functional questions with a large number of experimental methods. First, the authors use gene editing to develop assays in permeabilized HEK cells. MCU homologs from amoeba and plants mediate Ca uptake alone, while worms, flies, and human MCU requires EMRE. Cysteine and tryptophan scanning/substitution mutagenesis then enables them to verify that MCU's N and C termini are inside the mitoplast, while EMRE's N terminus is inside the mitoplast and its C terminus outside. Chimeras and other experiments then suggest that TMH1 of MCU is the interaction region for EMRE. Other subunits, the relatively soluble subunits MICU1 and MICU2, are shown to associate with the outer leaflet of the inner mitochondrial membrane, and that EMRE associates with MICU1 by electrostatic interactions. MICU function is verified as regulating Ca entry, and the authors propose that MICU1 must bind EMRE to engage the MCU pore. Thus, MICUs regulate what would otherwise be an unregulated Ca pore. An important finding is that EMRE polyaspartate tail ensures that the channel conducts Ca only when cytoplasmic Ca rises above its resting levels. In short, EMRE mediates MICU retention and MCU retention. Based on the lack of EMRE in lower species, the authors conclude that EMRE arose as a safety mechanism, allowing MICU1 gating of MCU only if EMRE is present."

The study combines clever biochemical methods (e.g., artificial transmembrane domains, tryptophan mutagenesis, and protein fusions) to shed insight into the complex, with a focus on EMRE and its interactions with MCU and MICU1.

Based on this difference (six versus two), the authors prioritize TM1 as being more important for EMRE binding. They then show that two of these mutations can be introduced into the DdMCU without impairing function \u2013 and since DdMCU operates independently of EMRE, prioritize these two as important for human MCU binding to EMRE.

The novel findings include the topology of EMRE, the MCU-EMRE fusion (which could be a very important tool for the field), EMRE interaction with TM1, and interaction between MICU1 and EMRE.</i>"

However, we disagree with the reviewer that the dual function of EMRE is established. Prior to our work, the only known function of EMRE is keeping MCU open, but the physiological significance of such function is unclear. To be sure, it has been reported that EMRE interacts with MICU1, but the purpose and mechanism of this interaction, and how this molecular contact regulates uniporter function, have remained unknown until this study. We have endeavored in the Abstract, the Introduction, and the Discussion to emphasize and highlight the major contribution of this work: to provide a unifying picture of how the MCU-activation and MICU1-rentention functions of EMRE together prevent Ca<sup>2+</sup> leakage through the uniporter during resting cell conditions."
