How these opposing activities are regulated during assembly of the DNA polymerase holoenzyme remains unknown. By utilizing FRET to monitor protein-DNA interactions, we examined assembly of the human holoenzyme. The results indicate that assembly proceeds in a stepwise manner. The clamp loader (RFC) loads a sliding clamp (PCNA) onto a primer/template junction but remains transiently bound to the DNA. Unable to slide away, PCNA re-engages with RFC and is unloaded. In the presence of polymerase (pol\u03b4), loaded PCNA is captured from DNA-bound RFC which subsequently dissociates, leaving behind the holoenzyme. These studies suggest that the unloading activity of RFC maximizes the utilization of PCNA by inhibiting the build-up of free PCNA on DNA in the absence of polymerase and recycling limited PCNA to keep up with ongoing replication."

To achieve the high processivity required for efficient DNA replication, replicative pols anchor to ring-shaped sliding clamps, forming the holoenzyme. Sliding clamps are dimers or trimers of identical subunits aligned head-to-tail, forming a highly-conserved, toroidal structure with two structurally distinct faces and a central cavity large enough to encircle double-stranded DNA and slide freely along it. The \u2018C-terminal face' contains all C-termini and serves as a platform for interaction with replicative pols (<a href=\"#bib11\">Hedglin et al., in press</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Yao and O'Donnell, 2012</a>). In solution, most sliding clamps are closed, requiring an enzyme-catalyzed mechanism which; (1) disrupts an interface within the sliding clamp ring and holds it open for assembly; (2) targets it to primer/template (P/T) junctions where DNA synthesis is initiated; (3) orients it correctly for interaction with pols; and (4) closes it around DNA (<a href=\"#bib49\">Yao et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Schurtenberger et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Matsumiya et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Zhuang et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Paschall et al., 2011</a>).

Each subunit belongs to the AAA+ superfamily of ATPases that contain characteristic ATP-binding/hydrolysis motifs that convert the energy from ATP binding and hydrolysis to mechanical force. Over the years, information gathered from detailed mechanistic and structural studies has converged on a similar sequential mechanism for clamp loader-mediated assembly of the DNA pol holoenzyme (<a href=\"#bib11\">Hedglin et al., in press</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Yao and O'Donnell, 2012</a>). In the presence of ATP, clamp loaders bind the C-terminal face of their respective clamp and open it for assembly. Once formed, the open clamp\u2022clamp loader complex binds a P/T junction, adopting a \u2018notched screw cap arrangement' that matches the helical geometry of the DNA duplex (<a href=\"#bib39\">Simonetta et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Kelch et al., 2011</a>). In this orientation, ATP hydrolysis is optimized and the clamp loader reverts to a low-affinity DNA-binding state upon hydrolysis of ATP and ejects from the P/T junction, leaving behind the loaded clamp. Concurrent or subsequent to clamp loader ejection, the open sliding clamp ring contracts around the P/T junction and is ready to anchor an incoming pol to the 3\u2032 end of the primer strand, forming the holoenzyme (<a href=\"#bib11\">Hedglin et al., in press</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Yao and O'Donnell, 2012</a>)."

Also, distinguishing subtleties are present within each of these model systems such that a defined model for assembly of the human pol holoenzyme cannot be inferred. For instance, the fate of the clamp loader upon loading the clamp onto DNA is quite distinct for each model system. In T4 bacteriophage, the clamp loader chaperones the incoming pol onto the correct face of loaded clamp prior to dissociating from the clamp\u2022DNA complex (<a href=\"#bib44\">Trakselis et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Perumal et al., 2012</a>). In <i>E. coli</i>, the clamp loader disengages from the P/T junction but remains at the replication fork through association with the replicative helicase and single-stranded DNA binding protein and chaperones one of the three pols bound to its own subunits to the newly loaded clamp (<a href=\"#bib7\">Downey and McHenry, 2010</a>). In <i>S. cerevisiae</i>, a recent report suggests that the clamp loader does not actually eject from the P/T junction but rather remains part of the pol holoenzyme through association with one of the sliding clamp subunits (<a href=\"#bib16\">Kumar et al., 2010</a>). Furthermore, the few studies on assembly of the human pol holoenzyme failed to account for the clamp unloading activity of the clamp loader, replication factor C (RFC). In a replicating cell, the number of P/T junctions are in excess of sliding clamps, necessitating an efficient unloading mechanism for recycling during S-phase (<a href=\"#bib49\">Yao et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Leu et al., 2000</a>). The human sliding clamp, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), is very stable on DNA by itself and is catalytically unloaded by RFC in an ATP-dependent manner. Such an activity is also present in archaea and bacteria while it seems to be missing from <i>S. cerevisiae</i> (<a href=\"#bib49\">Yao et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Cai et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Cann et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Matsumiya et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Kumar et al., 2010</a>).

Such studies addressed only one direction of the pathway at a time. The forward direction (clamp loading) was monitored beginning with only free components (DNA, PCNA, RFC) while the reverse direction (clamp unloading) was monitored by subjecting isolated PCNA\u2022DNA complexes to RFC. Thus, it is assumed that RFC ejects immediately upon loading sliding clamps onto DNA, before the arrival of the polymerase, and then rebinds to unload them only after the polymerase disengages. However, without monitoring clamp loading and unloading simultaneously, the temporal correlation between the opposing activities of RFC and how they are regulated during assembly of the DNA polymerase holoenzyme remains unknown."

By utilizing FRET signals from fluorescently labeled P/T DNA and PCNA to monitor protein-DNA interactions, we were able to observe both activities of RFC in real time and directly monitor assembly of the DNA pol holoenzyme. We obtained data detailing the step-wise manner in which the human pol\u03b4 holoenzyme is assembled; (1) RFC loads a stoichiometric amount of PCNA onto a P/T junction in an ATP-dependent manner; (2) upon hydrolysis of ATP, RFC releases the closed clamp ring onto DNA but remains transiently bound near the P/T junction; (3) unable to \u2018slide away,' PCNA re-engages with bound RFC in the absence of pol\u03b4 and together RFC and all of the loaded PCNA dissociate from the DNA; (4) in the presence of pol\u03b4, DNA-bound PCNA is captured and physically occluded from the unloading activity of RFC and then; (5) RFC dissociates from the P/T junction, leaving behind the functional holoenzyme consisting of PCNA and pol\u03b4. Thus, human RFC does not immediately eject from P/T DNA in between PCNA loading and unloading as has been assumed for so long and the replicative pols play a paramount role by capturing loaded PCNA from DNA-bound RFC to inhibit unloading of PCNA and complete assembly of the holoenzyme. Upon dissociation of pol\u03b4 from PCNA and DNA, RFC may then unload the clamp for recycling. These studies provide the first comprehensive analysis of assembly of the human replicative pol holoenzyme. The outcomes of these studies suggest that the unloading activity of the human clamp loader serves a dual purpose; it increases the efficiency of holoenzyme assembly by inhibiting the build-up of free clamps on DNA in the absence of replication and recycles scarce clamps to keep up with ongoing DNA replication."

The position of PCNA residue 107 within the clamp ring is structurally conserved among eukaryotes (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>) and has been previously utilized for labeling as a FRET acceptor through mutation to cysteine (<a href=\"#bib10\">Gulbis et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Zhuang et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Kumar et al., 2010</a>). A mutant PCNA with the surface-exposed cysteines mutated and asparagine 107 changed to cysteine (N107C) was labeled with Cy5-maleimide (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The labeled mutant PCNA (Cy5-PCNA) stimulated the ATPase activity of RFC equal to that for wild-type PCNA, indicating a fully functional protein (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). A truncated form of RFC (hRFCp140\u0394N555) was used in these studies in which the N-terminal 555 amino acids of the large subunit (RFC1, p140) were deleted to remove the nonspecific DNA-binding affinity of RFC (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This region of the human clamp loader is conserved among eukaryotes and is dispensable for PCNA loading (<a href=\"#bib47\">Uhlmann et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Podust et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Gomes et al., 2000</a>). Herein, the truncated form of the clamp loader (hRFCp140\u0394N555) will be referred to as simply RFC."

In the presence of RFC and ATP (or ATP\u03b3S), a distinct FRET signal was observed at 665 nm, indicating that loading of Cy5-PCNA onto Cy3-P/T DNA is favored at equilibrium (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). Both RFC and ATP (or ATP\u03b3S) are required for PCNA loading, confirming that the ATP-dependent PCNA-loading activity of RFC is responsible for the observed steady-state FRET signal. In order to study the kinetics of PCNA loading in real time, we pre-assembled the RFC\u2022Cy5-PCNA complex in the presence of ATP and mixed it with Cy3-P/T DNA in a stopped-flow instrument (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). In the absence of RFC, the signal remains flat over the entire time course (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, black trace) again demonstrating that RFC is responsible for the observed FRET signal. In the presence of RFC, an extended time course of the FRET trace displayed three distinct phases (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>, blue trace). A very rapid increase in FRET occurred within the \u2018dead time' of the instrument and was not observed in the trace (please see \u2018Materials and methods'). This is most likely binding of the RFC\u2022ATP\u2022Cy5-PCNA complex to DNA. This was followed by a FRET increase with a rate constant of <i>k</i><sub>inc</sub> = 6.4 \u00b1 0.28 s<sup>\u22121</sup> and a FRET decrease with a rate constant of <i>k</i><sub>dec,1</sub> = 1.4 \u00b1 0.038 s<sup>\u22121</sup>.

The bimolecular association of the RFC\u2022ATP\u2022Cy5-PCNA complex with Cy3-P/T DNA is apparently fast as it was not observed at any RFC concentration on the time scale of our experiments. Interestingly, the overall amplitude (A<sub>T</sub>) of the signal (i.e., the sum of the amplitudes of all phases in the FRET trace, please see \u2018Materials and methods') increases linearly throughout the entire range of RFC concentrations and does not saturate at a concentration where the RFC\u2022Cy5-PCNA\u2022Cy3-P/T DNA complex is stoichiometric (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>).

Due to the differing kinetic characteristics of the FRET increases observed in the presence of ATP and ATP\u03b3S, it cannot be concluded that each represents an approach to the same FRET state. Furthermore, the presence of multiple phases within the observed FRET increase with ATP\u03b3S may suggest either multistep loading or the presence of more than one population of the ternary complex. Nonetheless, these studies demonstrate that only ATP binding, not hydrolysis, is required for opening of the clamp ring and assembly of the RFC\u2022PCNA\u2022DNA complex, in agreement with previous reports on the human system (<a href=\"#bib17\">Lee and Hurwitz, 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Mossi et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Shiomi et al., 2000</a>).

However, under these conditions, it cannot be concluded that each step occurs within the initial binding encounter of RFC\u2022ATP\u2022PCNA and P/T DNA. Furthermore, even though PCNA and RFC\u2022ATP form a tight complex (<i>K</i><sub>D</sub> \u223c 0.2 nM), the alternative possibility that multiple reaction species are present cannot be ruled out (<a href=\"#bib4\">Cai et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Shiomi et al., 2000</a>). In order to address this, we carried out pulse-chase experiments as described in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>. A pre-formed RFC\u2022ATP\u2022Cy5-PCNA complex was briefly incubated with Cy3-P/T DNA (\u2018Pulse') and then mixed with a large excess unlabeled PCNA (\u2018Chase') in a stopped-flow instrument. Under these conditions, only Cy5-PCNA bound to RFC prior to the addition of Cy3-P/T DNA and chase should generate a FRET signal, thus eliminating free RFC and free Cy5-PCNA. In the absence of chase, the loading traces appear as in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a> with rate constants of 7.6 \u00b1 0.20 s<sup>\u22121</sup> and 1.50 \u00b1 0.083 s<sup>\u22121</sup> for the fitted FRET increase (<i>k</i><sub>inc</sub>) and decrease (<i>k</i><sub>dec,1</sub>), respectively (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, blue trace). If unlabeled PCNA chase is added prior to Cy5-PCNA, the FRET signal remains flat (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, red trace). This represents the zero FRET state and demonstrates that unlabeled PCNA is an efficient trap. When the experiment was carried out in the presence of chase, a FRET increase was observed with a rate constant of <i>k</i><sub>inc</sub> = 6.1 \u00b1 0.59 s<sup>\u22121</sup>, followed by a unique FRET decrease with three distinct exponential decay phases instead of one; <i>k</i><sub>dec,1</sub> = 1.6 \u00b1 0.33 s<sup>\u22121</sup>, <i>k</i><sub>dec,2</sub> = 0.43 \u00b1 0.070 s<sup>\u22121</sup>, and <i>k</i><sub>dec,3</sub> = 0.058 \u00b1 5.7 \u00d7 10<sup>\u22124</sup> s<sup>\u22121</sup> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, orange trace). The rate constants for the FRET increase (<i>k</i><sub>inc</sub>) and the initial phase of the FRET decrease (<i>k</i><sub>dec,1</sub>) agree very well with that observed in the absence of chase, demonstrating that these two observed phases occur within the initial binding encounter of Cy5-PCNA and Cy3-P/T DNA. Furthermore, these two observed phases exactly align in the presence and absence of chase (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>, inset), suggesting that the FRET signal was generated from a single reaction species and that all of the pre-formed RFC\u2022ATP\u2022Cy5-PCNA complex commits through the loading pathway. Thus, dissociation of the RFC\u2022ATP\u2022Cy5-PCNA complex from the Cy3-P/T DNA is much slower (\u226510-fold) than the first conformational change (<i>k</i><sub>inc</sub>). The two additional phases within the FRET decrease only appeared when rebinding of Cy5-PCNA to Cy3-P/T DNA was inhibited by excess unlabeled PCNA chase and decreased the FRET signal to zero where all Cy3-P/T DNA is devoid of Cy5-PCNA. This suggests that these previously unobserved phases represent dissociation of Cy5-PCNA from Cy3-P/T DNA and that the final amplitude observed in the absence of chase does not reflect a static endpoint but rather the amount of PCNA loaded onto DNA at equilibrium where the rates for PCNA loading and dissociation are equal. Collectively, these studies demonstrate that a single turnover of RFC-catalyzed loading of PCNA actually proceeds through four observed phases, the last two representing dissociation of Cy5-PCNA from Cy3-P/T DNA."

This process, referred to as subunit exchange, sets the maximum timescale for disassembly of sliding clamps from DNA in the absence of an enzymatic unloading activity and free DNA ends. In T4 bacteriophage, this process is the sole mechanism for disassembly of the gp45 clamp from DNA (<a href=\"#bib14\">Kaboord and Benkovic, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Yao et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Soumillion et al., 1998</a>) and also contributes substantially to disassembly of PCNA from DNA within <i>S. cerevisiae</i> (<a href=\"#bib16\">Kumar et al., 2010</a>).

Assuming that the two kinetic phases observed in the dissociation of PCNA from P/T DNA represent defined FRET complexes, these results suggest that one or both populations of loaded PCNA may be actively unloaded by (and, hence, dissociate with) RFC. In order to address this, we sought to establish whether a population of RFC dissociates along with either PCNA species and whether or not any PCNA is left behind on P/T DNA."

                                "text": "We carried out the trapping experiments depicted in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a> for direct comparison to the PCNA dissociation experiments described in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a> above. First, the RFC\u2022ATP\u2022PCNA\u2022Cy3-P/T DNA complex was pre-assembled in the presence of excess Cy3-P/T DNA to ensure all RFC was engaged with PCNA and Cy3-P/T DNA. The PCNA in this complex is unlabeled so a FRET signal is not observed prior to mixing. This complex was then mixed with Cy5-PCNA at a 1:1 ratio of labeled to unlabeled PCNA. Under these conditions, the only source of RFC is from the pre-assembled RFC\u2022ATP\u2022PCNA\u2022Cy3-P/T DNA complex. Thus, if all PCNA is actively unloaded from Cy3-P/T DNA by RFC and rapidly exchanges with Cy5-PCNA, the rate of Cy5-PCNA loading will be entirely rate-limited by dissociation of the RFC\u2022PCNA complex from Cy3-P/T DNA. Hence, the rate of appearance of the FRET signal should be the same as the rates observed for the disappearance of the FRET signal in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>. Furthermore, the overall amplitude of the FRET increase (A<sub>T,Reload</sub>) should be exactly one-half the overall amplitude for the FRET decrease in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a> (A<sub>T,Unload</sub>) if all PCNA is unloaded from Cy3-P/T DNA by RFC, as follows. Upon dissociation of RFC from the pre-assembled complex, the probability that RFC will exchange for and load Cy5-PCNA will be equal to the fraction of Cy5-PCNA in solution. At a 1:1 ratio of PCNA:Cy5-PCNA, the concentrations of unlabeled and labeled PCNA in solution will be equal if RFC unloads all loaded PCNA from the Cy3-P/T DNA and RFC will have an equal probability of loading either onto Cy3-P/T DNA. Thus, the overall amplitude of the FRET increase (A<sub>T,Reload</sub>) will be exactly half the overall amplitude for the FRET decrease (A<sub>T,Unload</sub>) observed in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>. In other words, A<sub>T,Reload</sub>/A<sub>T,Unload</sub> will be equal to 0.5, the fraction of labeled PCNA in the reaction. As presented in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>, the FRET time trace was essentially the mirror image of <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, with two phases with rate constants of 0.45 \u00b1 0.080 s<sup>\u22121</sup> and 0.040 \u00b1 0.0093 s<sup>\u22121</sup> and relative amplitudes of 86 \u00b1 2.1% and 14 \u00b1 2.1% (<a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>) that are within error of those reported for <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a> (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). Thus, dissociation of RFC and PCNA from P/T DNA is intimately coordinated such that all RFC ejects from the P/T junction simultaneously with PCNA through dissociation of both populations of the RFC\u2022PCNA\u2022P/T DNA complex. This is definitive proof that the clamp loading-unloading pathway reaches equilibrium after the initial loading of PCNA onto P/T DNA because subsequent loading events occur with rate constants equal to the rate constants for dissociation of RFC\u2022PCNA from DNA. Furthermore, A<sub>T,reload</sub>/A<sub>T,unload</sub> (0.51 \u00b1 0.055) is equal to the fraction of labeled PCNA (0.5) in the reaction presented in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a> (<a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>). This relationship holds true for other ratios of Cy5-PCNA:PCNA as well and a plot of A<sub>T, Reload</sub>/A<sub>T, Unload</sub> vs the fraction of Cy5-PCNA in the reaction yielded a straight line with a Y-intercept of \u223c0.0 and a slope of \u223c1.0 (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), indicating that no PCNA is left behind on P/T DNA upon ejection of RFC. Rather, all PCNA loaded onto P/T DNA by RFC is unloaded back into solution by RFC."

This demonstrates that all PCNA dissociates from the Cy3-P/T DNA substrate via the same pathway and independently of the single-stranded DNA flap and rules out the possibility that the flap traps RFC on the DNA and favors clamp unloading by keeping RFC in close proximity to the P/T junction upon loading PCNA. Indeed, human RFC is highly specific for P/T junctions and has very low affinity for purely single-stranded DNA (<a href=\"#bib45\">Tsurimoto and Stillman, 1990</a>). Together, this suggests that upon loading PCNA onto a P/T junction RFC remains at or near the P/T junction by anchoring to the adjacent single-stranded DNA of the template strand, not the single-stranded DNA flap. Subsequently, RFC dissociates back into solution taking all loaded PCNA with it. Thus, the opposing activities of RFC, clamp loading and unloading, both occur within the same binding encounter with a given P/T junction."

                                "text": "Like other systems, the human replicative pols \u03b4 and \u03b5 share common binding sites on PCNA with RFC (<a href=\"#bib52\">Zhang et al., 1999</a>). The results presented above imply that incoming pols must capture loaded PCNA rings from DNA-bound RFC to block unloading and complete assembly of the pol holoenzyme. In order to gain insight into how this is achieved, we repeated the trapping experiments depicted in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a> in the presence of pol\u03b4. Under these conditions, the overall amplitude of the FRET increase (A<sub>T,reload</sub>) will report on the amount of both unlabeled PCNA and RFC in solution as before. At a ratio of 1:1:1 PCNA:Cy5-PCNA:pol\u03b4, if pol\u03b4 captures all loaded PCNA from DNA-bound RFC and all RFC ejects into solution, there will be no unlabeled PCNA in solution and RFC can only load Cy5-PCNA onto Cy3-P/T DNA. Thus, the overall amplitude of the FRET increase (A<sub>T,Reload</sub>) should be equal to the overall amplitude of the FRET decrease (A<sub>T,Unload</sub>) in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>. Furthermore, the rate of appearance of the FRET signal should be faster in the presence of pol\u03b4 if pol\u03b4 actively displaces RFC. As presented in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>, only the overall amplitude (A<sub>T,Reload</sub>) increases in the presence of pol\u03b4. Two phases are present within the FRET time trace with rate constants and relative amplitudes that are within error of those reported in the absence of pol\u03b4 (<a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>) as well as those reported for the dissociation of PCNA from DNA (<a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>). Furthermore, these values are independent of pol\u03b4 concentration (<a href=\"#fig4s6\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 6</a>). Thus, pol\u03b4 does not actively displace RFC from the P/T junction. Rather, RFC dissociates from the P/T DNA in a biphasic manner independently of both PCNA and pol\u03b4. Thus, the rate constants for the disappearance of the FRET signal in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a> and re-appearance of the FRET signal in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a> all reflect dissociation of RFC from the P/T DNA and suggest that at least two forms of RFC are present in the ternary complex. A<sub>T,Reload</sub>/A<sub>T,Unload</sub> increased from 0.51 \u00b1 0.055 in the absence of pol\u03b4 to 1.0 \u00b1 0.0063 in the presence of a stoichiometric amount of pol\u03b4 (<a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>), suggesting that pol\u03b4 captured all loaded PCNA from DNA-bound RFC. Importantly, this same behavior was also observed when the single-stranded flap was removed from the Cy3-P/T DNA substrate (<a href=\"#fig4s4\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 4B</a> and <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a>), again suggesting that RFC remains at or near P/T junction upon loading PCNA and does not retreat to the single-stranded DNA flap to allow the holoenzyme to form. When the concentration of pol\u03b4 was varied, A<sub>T,Reload</sub>/A<sub>T,Unload</sub> increased linearly to the level of the unlabeled PCNA and RFC concentrations (100 nM) and plateaued thereafter (<a href=\"#fig4s5\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 5</a>). At the break point where A<sub>T,reload</sub>/A<sub>T,unload</sub> = 1.0, the concentrations of unlabeled PCNA, RFC, and pol\u03b4 were all equivalent indicating that pol\u03b4 stabilized all loaded PCNA on the Cy3-P/T DNA. Furthermore, this indicates that all PCNA loaded onto DNA by RFC is in the same form and competent for holoenzyme formation, that is the PCNA ring is closed around the P/T DNA in the correct orientation. Taken together, this suggests that pol\u03b4 captures loaded PCNA rings from DNA-bound RFC to complete assembly of the pol holoenzyme. This effectively inhibits the unloading activity of DNA-bound RFC by physical occlusion and RFC subsequently dissociates from the single-stranded region of the template strand adjacent to the P/T junction, leaving behind the functional holoenzyme consisting of PCNA and pol\u03b4."

Rather, RFC remains transiently bound near the P/T junction, dissociating slowly in a biphasic manner independently of both PCNA and pol\u03b4 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3, 4</a>, and <a href=\"#fig4s6\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 6</a>). Furthermore, in the absence of pol\u03b4, all PCNA loaded onto DNA by RFC is unloaded by RFC back into solution (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>, <a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>, and <a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). Thus, PCNA and RFC are always present together on a given P/T DNA in the absence of pol\u03b4. However, this does not imply that RFC and PCNA remain engaged at the P/T junction while both are bound to a given DNA. In numerous reports, PCNA\u2022DNA complexes devoid of RFC have been isolated in vitro using recombinant human proteins. Within these studies, the circular DNA substrates did not contain any blocks to PCNA sliding (<a href=\"#bib5\">Cai et al., 1996</a>, <a href=\"#bib4\">1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Yao et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Uhlmann et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Zhang et al., 1999</a>). Thus, upon hydrolysis of ATP by RFC and closure of the PCNA ring, at least some fraction of loaded PCNA must slide away from the P/T junction within these substrates, escaping the unloading activity of RFC. Indeed, RFC's affinity for PCNA decreases \u223c3 orders of magnitude in the presence of ADP alone (<a href=\"#bib52\">Zhang et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Shiomi et al., 2000</a>) and if Neutravidin is omitted from the Cy3-P/T DNA substrate, allowing PCNA to slide off the primer end of the Cy3-P/T DNA substrate, the amount of Cy5-PCNA unloaded by RFC decreases by 2.3 \u00b1 0.27-fold (<a href=\"#fig4s7\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 7</a>). Thus, we propose that upon hydrolysis of ATP(s) and closure of the PCNA clamp ring, RFC releases PCNA onto DNA (step 4). This would also be most consistent with the passive model for the capture of loaded PCNA by pol\u03b4 (discussed later)."

This implies that RFC must re-open the closed PCNA ring prior to unloading. Based on the requirements for PCNA ring opening in solution, it is presumed that only ATP binding, not hydrolysis, is required for opening PCNA on DNA. We are currently testing this hypothesis and thus it cannot be ruled out that RFC requires the energy of ATP hydrolysis to pry open closed PCNA rings on DNA that are reinforced by electrostatic interactions between the positively-charged inner surface of PCNA and the negatively-charged DNA backbone. Regardless, unloading of PCNA from DNA is not limited by re-opening of the PCNA ring. Rather, this process is entirely rate-limited by RFC dissociation from P/T DNA as the rate constants for dissociation of RFC\u2022PCNA and RFC alone are equivalent (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a> and <a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>). Dissociation of RFC from P/T DNA is biphasic, with \u223c80% dissociating fast and the remaining 20% dissociating \u223c10-fold slower. This suggests that at least two forms of RFC are present with only the faster of the two phases being dependent upon ATP hydrolysis. As discussed above, clamp loaders revert to a low-affinity DNA-binding state upon hydrolysis of ATP and eject from the P/T junction. Perhaps as the concentration of ATP is increased, nucleotide exchange begins to compete with ATP hydrolysis and/or ADP binding such that dissociation of most RFC from the P/T junction is inhibited. This suggests that the minor population of RFC represents that which dissociates from the P/T junction independently of its nucleotide-bound state. Once free in solution, RFC releases bound PCNA, exchanges ADP for ATP (step 6), and the cycle repeats."

This implies that ATP hydrolysis occurs \u2018all or none' or sequentially. In the former model, each ATP-hydrolysis dependent event is catalyzed by ATP hydrolysis occurring within all ATPase sites of RFC at once. Thus, in our PCNA loading-unloading model, nucleotide exchange would have to occur while RFC is still bound to P/T DNA, in between closure of the clamp ring and unloading of PCNA into solution. In the latter model, there is a division of labor in which the ATPase sites of certain RFC subunits \u2018fire' at defined moments along the reaction coordinate in order to catalyze distinct steps (i.e., ring closure, ejection of the clamp loader, etc.). Although our studies on human RFC cannot discern between these models, previous reports on clamp loaders from <i>E. coli</i> (<a href=\"#bib40\">Snyder et al., 2004</a>)<b>,</b> the hyperthermophilic euryarchaeon <i>Archaeoglobus fulgidus</i> (<a href=\"#bib36\">Seybert and Wigley, 2004</a>)<i>,</i> and <i>S. cerevisiae</i> (<a href=\"#bib12\">Johnson et al., 2006</a>) have provided experimental evidence for the latter model and recent crystallographic studies on the T4 bacteriophage clamp loader have provided the first structural insights. In brief, after the clamp loader\u2022clamp complex binds to a P/T junction, ATP is hydrolyzed in one of the clamp loader subunits causing the open clamp to close around the DNA. The conformational changes within the hydrolyzing subunit are propagated to the remaining subunits of the clamp loader, presumably inducing sequential ATP hydrolysis (<a href=\"#bib15\">Kelch et al., 2011</a>). Thus, the state of bound nucleotide within the clamp loader progressively changes along the reaction coordinate, temporally defining the catalytic events. Future studies with human proteins will discern whether such a model is conserved."

Incoming pols may either actively displace RFC from an RFC\u2022PCNA complex present at the P/T junction or passively capture a closed PCNA clamp while it is transiently disengaged from the DNA-bound RFC. As presented in <a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>, and <a href=\"#fig4s6\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 6</a>, dissociation of RFC from the P/T DNA is independent of pol\u03b4, consistent with a passive capture of loaded PCNA. This agrees with the data presented here and elsewhere that suggest that PCNA is released onto DNA upon hydrolysis of ATP by RFC (<a href=\"#bib5\">Cai et al., 1996</a>, <a href=\"#bib4\">1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Yao et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Uhlmann et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Zhang et al., 1999</a>).

Indeed, our studies suggest that RFC remains transiently bound near the P/T DNA upon binding of pol\u03b4 to the loaded PCNA clamp (discussed further below) and human RFC has been shown to interact with pol\u03b4 (<a href=\"#bib51\">Yuzhakov et al., 1999</a>)."

The open PCNA clamp expands the protected region on the double-stranded side of the P/T junction out to \u223c25 bp (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This arrangement of the clamp loader\u2022ATP\u2022clamp complex is highly conserved in all domains of life as well as T4 bacteriophage (<a href=\"#bib11\">Hedglin et al., in press</a>) as discussed further below. The closed ring of human PCNA has a width (30 \u00c5) that is equivalent to \u223c10 bp of B-form DNA (<a href=\"#bib10\">Gulbis et al., 1996</a>). Thus, due to the minimal double-stranded region of the P/T junction (30 bp) and the Neutravidin block within the Cy3-P/T DNA substrate, loaded PCNA can slide at most 20 bp away from the P/T junction to allow an incoming polymerase to bind to its C-terminal face (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). We believe this best represents the situation in vivo where PCNA is loaded onto \u223c30 nt RNA-DNA hybrid primers that are blocked on both sides by single-stranded DNA binding protein (replication protein A, RPA, in humans) that restrict the loaded PCNA to the P/T junction (<a href=\"#bib3\">Burgers, 2009</a>). However, the experiments performed on the Cy3-P/T DNA substrate lacking the single-stranded DNA flap (<a href=\"#fig4s4\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 4</a> and <a href=\"#tbl3\">Table 3</a>) demonstrate that human RFC remains at or near the P/T junction upon loading PCNA onto DNA by anchoring to the adjacent single-stranded DNA of the template strand, implying that RFC must also retract towards the P/T junction upon closure and release of PCNA onto DNA to allow for an incoming DNA polymerase. Recent, ground-breaking crystallographic studies from the Kuriyan laboratory suggest this may be the case. In their 2011 publication, Kelch et al. crystallized the clamp loader\u2022clamp\u2022DNA complex from T4 bacteriophage in two forms (<a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). In the ATP bound form, the clamp loader\u2022clamp complex has adopted a right-handed spiral conformation (notched screw cap) that closely mimics the helical geometry of the bound DNA. In another form, the clamp is closed around DNA and the B subunit of the clamp loader has hydrolyzed ATP, moved away from the adjacent C subunit, and partially disengaged from the template strand and the clamp. The new conformation of the B subunit is incompatible with the symmetric spiral of the other clamp loader subunits. This partial collapse of the clamp loader spiral retracts the clamp loader, particularly the N-terminal domain of the A subunit, towards the P/T junction. The authors suggest that as ATP hydrolysis continues around the clamp loader spiral, the matching symmetry between the clamp loader and the DNA\u2022clamp is progressively broken (<a href=\"#bib15\">Kelch et al., 2011</a>). Perhaps as ATP hydrolysis propagates around the human clamp loader after closing of the clamp ring on DNA, RFC retracts towards the 3\u2032 end of the primer strand as the clamp loader spiral collapses, revealing more of the double-stranded region of the P/T junction. In addition to the closed PCNA ring sliding away from the P/T junction, such a conformational change would allow sufficient room for an incoming polymerase to form the holoenzyme. Indeed, limiting the double-stranded region of the P/T junction to the DNA footprint (25 bp) of the human notched screw cap complex (Cy3-P/T DNA-25 bp in <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>) had no effect on the amount of PCNA unloaded in the absence of pol\u03b4 or the amount of pol\u03b4 holoenzyme formed (<a href=\"#fig4s8\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 8</a> and <a href=\"#tbl2\">Tables 2 and 3</a>), suggesting that DNA-bound RFC retracts towards the P/T junction upon closure and release of PCNA onto DNA (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, step 4). Once loaded PCNA is captured by pol\u03b4 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, step 7), RFC subsequently dissociates, leaving behind the functional holoenzyme consisting only of PCNA and pol\u03b4 (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, step 8)."

                                "text": "The amount of PCNA trimers present in the nucleus of human cells during S-phase is estimated to be \u223c2 \u00d7 10<sup>5</sup>/cell (<a href=\"#bib25\">Morris and Mathews, 1989</a>). Based on the size of the human genome and the number of P/T junctions (Okazaki fragments and origins of replication), it is suggested that PCNA trimers are in demand during S-phase and must be re-used hundreds to thousands of times per cell cycle. As discussed above, human PCNA is incredibly stable on DNA in the absence of free DNA ends and an enzymatic unloading activity. Thus, an efficient unloading mechanism is required for recycling during S-phase (<a href=\"#bib49\">Yao et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Leu et al., 2000</a>). The results presented here demonstrate that RFC loads PCNA onto a P/T junction and, in the absence of pol\u03b4, catalytically unloads all loaded PCNA from the P/T DNA without first dissociating into solution. This may serve to maximize the utilization of limited PCNA by inhibiting the build-up of free PCNA on DNA in the absence of polymerase. Presumably, once pol\u03b4 disengages from the P/T junction and PCNA, RFC may unload the PCNA from DNA, recycling limited PCNA to keep up with ongoing replication. However, in replicating eukaryotic cells, PCNA left behind on DNA serves as a cell signal during S-phase by marking replicated DNA for chromatin assembly (<a href=\"#bib37\">Shibahara and Stillman, 1999</a>) and sister chromatid cohesion (<a href=\"#bib24\">Moldovan et al., 2006</a>). Furthermore, replication-blocking lesions encountered during S-phase are also marked by PCNA for replication by alternative DNA polymerases that can accommodate lesions. Such a process, referred to as translesion (TLS) synthesis, is initiated by ubiquitylation of PCNA at the site of the lesion and may occur immediately at the replication fork or at a later time (<a href=\"#bib34\">Sale et al., 2012</a>). Thus, some PCNA rings must remain on DNA after dissociation of replicative pols. This suggests that the PCNA unloading activity of RFC is tightly coordinated with the aforementioned activities, perhaps through post-translational modifications of PCNA, RFC, or both. Indeed, SUMO (small ubiquitin-like modifier) is attached to PCNA during S-phase in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>. This serves to prevent homologous recombination by recruiting the Srs2 helicase but also leads to accumulation of SUMO-PCNA on chromatin in the absence of an alternative clamp loader, ELG1-RFC, suggesting that this modification may also inhibit the PCNA unloading activity of native RFC (<a href=\"#bib29\">Parnas et al., 2010</a>). Attachment of SUMO to PCNA has only recently been established in humans and it remains to be seen what effect, if any, this modification has on the stability of the human PCNA clamp on DNA (<a href=\"#bib8\">Gali et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Moldovan et al., 2012</a>). Furthermore, it was recently shown that human RFC is ubiquitylated in a DNA damage-dependent manner in vivo (<a href=\"#bib43\">Tomida et al., 2008</a>). Although it is currently unknown what effect this modification has on the catalytic activities of RFC, its temporal correlation with ubiquitylation of PCNA and TLS tempts one to speculate that ubiquitin conjugation to RFC may serve to inhibit its PCNA unloading activity during TLS."

The manuscript describes a series of carefully designed and closely argued FRET experiments that seek to dissect the detailed conformational steps in the loading and unloading of human PCNA by human RFC. The advance reported in this paper concerns the role of the RFC complex in unloading PCNA from DNA after it has been loaded."

It is also appreciated, from previous work, that clamp loaders can unload clamps from DNA, in the reverse of the reaction that puts them on to DNA, which helps recycling clamps from Okazaki fragments."

The authors delineate distinct ATP binding and ATP hydrolysis steps in the loading reaction, and show that PCNA transiently released from RFC following ATP hydrolysis can be recaptured by RFC in the first step of an unloading reaction. At one level, this is not surprising, and reflects what would be predicted by micro-reversibility of an overall equilibrium process. Nevertheless, the major conclusion, which is that RFC does not dissociate after loading PCNA and can unload the clamp from DNA, runs counter to the prevailing view and therefore increases interest in the paper. The authors suggest that RFC efficiently loads and unloads clamps at primed DNA within a single binding encounter with the primer-template junction. This has major biological implications as it would lower the efficiency of clamp loading during DNA replication, when the required loading rate is \u223c1 clamp/second. The problem would be acute if there were any lag between clamp loading and polymerase arrival. Thus, the conclusions of this study need to be carefully validated because they have the potential to change our understanding of a fundamental aspect of this important step in DNA replication."

The experiments are well performed, and the reasoning behind the experiments is well explained, but the experiments all rely on a particular DNA construct, shown in Figure 1. This construct is designed to block PCNA sliding off the DNA in two ways. First, streptavidin is bound to a biotin tag on one end. Second, a single-stranded overhang is present at the other end, which also provides a block for PCNA sliding. The two major concerns are as follows:"

In the absence of experiments on variants of the DNA construct used, there would be lingering questions about whether the results are an artifact of RFC and PCNA being trapped by a DNA construct that differs in important ways from the structure of a replication fork. We recognize that certain aspects of the DNA construct, such as the flap, may not easily be changed, but if these concerns cannot be overcome then the findings could be open to alternative interpretations."

Our model does not propose that RFC and PCNA remain engaged at the P/T junction while both are bound to a given DNA. The results presented in Figure 4\u2013figure supplement 7, along with previously published reports, demonstrates that upon hydrolysis of ATP and closure of the clamp ring, RFC releases PCNA onto DNA. Due to the minimal double-stranded region of the P/T junction (30 bp) and the Neutravidin block within the Cy3-P/T DNA substrate, loaded PCNA can slide at most 20 base pairs away from the P/T junction to allow an incoming polymerase to bind to its C-terminal face. We believe this best represents the situation <i>in vivo</i> where PCNA is loaded onto \u223c30 nt RNA-DNA hybrid primers that are blocked on both sides by RPA that restricts loaded PCNA to the P/T junction."

Rather, the results from these studies suggest that RFC remains at or near P/T junction by anchoring to the adjacent single-stranded DNA of the template strand. Please see the main text for more details and further discussion.

Together, this allows sufficient room for an incoming polymerase to bind to the C-terminal face of PCNA and access the 3' end of the primer strand to form the holoenzyme. This is in agreement with recent structural studies from T4 bacteriophage that showed that hydrolysis of ATP within one subunit of the T4 clamp loader gp44/62 causes the open gp45 sliding clamp to close around DNA, and the clamp loader spiral to partially collapse and retract towards the P/T junction."
