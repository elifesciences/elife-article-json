However, very little is known about the extrinsic signals that act on planarian stem cells to modulate rates of neurogenesis. We have identified two planarian homeobox transcription factors, <i>Smed-nkx2.1</i> and <i>Smed-arx</i>, which are required for the maintenance of cholinergic, GABAergic, and octopaminergic neurons in the planarian CNS. These very same neurons also produce the planarian <i>hedgehog</i> ligand (<i>Smed-hh</i>), which appears to communicate with brain-adjacent stem cells to promote normal levels of neurogenesis. Planarian stem cells nearby the brain express core <i>hh</i> signal transduction genes, and consistent <i>hh</i> signaling levels are required to maintain normal production of neural progenitor cells and new mature cholinergic neurons, revealing an important mitogenic role for the planarian <i>hh</i> signaling molecule in the adult CNS."

However, very little is known about the extrinsic signals that act on planarian stem cells to modulate rates of neurogenesis. We have identified two planarian homeobox transcription factors, <i>Smed-nkx2.1</i> and <i>Smed-arx</i>, which are required for the maintenance of cholinergic, GABAergic, and octopaminergic neurons in the planarian CNS. These very same neurons also produce the planarian <i>hedgehog</i> ligand (<i>Smed-hh</i>), which appears to communicate with brain-adjacent stem cells to promote normal levels of neurogenesis. Planarian stem cells nearby the brain express core <i>hh</i> signal transduction genes, and consistent <i>hh</i> signaling levels are required to maintain normal production of neural progenitor cells and new mature cholinergic neurons, revealing an important mitogenic role for the planarian <i>hh</i> signaling molecule in the adult CNS."

However, levels of neuronal turnover are tightly limited in these animals (<a href=\"#bib51\">Obernier et al., 2014</a>). In fact, the highest known site of adult homeostatic neurogenesis in the human central nervous system (CNS) is the hippocampus, where annual neuronal turnover rates are estimated to be only 1.75% (<a href=\"#bib63\">Spalding et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Sanai et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Bergmann et al., 2012</a>). Adult neurogenesis in most animals depends on the action of ectodermally\u00a0derived neural stem cells, which have radial-glial character and are integrated into a stable niche microenvironment. Extrinsic signals such as wingless (Wnt), sonic hedgehog (Shh), and bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) act to finely control neural stem cell proliferation and differentiation (<a href=\"#bib62\">Silva-Vargas et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Lehtinen et al., 2011</a>)."

Not only does <i>S. mediterranea</i> constantly turnover its brain, but also\u00a0it is capable of complete brain regeneration within only two weeks following decapitation (<a href=\"#bib12\">Cebria, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Reddien and S\u00e1nchez Alvarado, 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Newmark and S\u00e1nchez Alvarado, 2002</a>). In addition, the uninjured planarian CNS is known to be a highly dynamic organ, which can adjust its size through the addition or subtraction of mature neurons to maintain consistent proportions with the rest of the body as it grows and shrinks, respectively (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bagu\u00f1\u00e1 and Romero, 1981</a> ; <a href=\"#bib30\">Hill and Petersen, 2015</a>). Amazingly, these regenerative feats and high levels of homeostatic neurogenesis are accomplished in the absence of a recognizable neuroepithelium, and without any definitive neural stem cells (<a href=\"#bib66\">van Wolfswinkel et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Zhu et al., 2015</a>). Recently, brain-derived Wnt signals have been shown to influence the neurogenic output of planarian stem cells (neoblasts) during regeneration (<a href=\"#bib30\">Hill and Petersen, 2015</a>).

Interestingly, these very same VM neural cell types are a major source of the planarian hedgehog ligand (<i>Smed-hh;</i> henceforth referred to as <i>hh</i>) (<a href=\"#bib56\">Rink et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Yazawa et al., 2009</a>). We also describe a novel neoblast population, which are <i>nkx2.1</i><sup>+</sup> or <i>arx</i><sup>+</sup>, express the core machinery for the reception of <i>hh</i> and Wnt signals, and are located adjacent to <i>hh</i><sup>+</sup> VM neurons. Finally, we present evidence that consistent <i>hh</i> signaling within this neoblast microenvironment is required to promote normal homeostatic neurogenesis of the VM neuronal population.

However, it is unknown what specific cells express this signal and what cells respond to it. Transverse sections through the brain highlighted <i>hh</i> expression within the VM regions of each brain lobe, similar to that of <i>arx</i> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). More specifically, <i>hh</i> expression was observed in the same VM neural cell types as described above for <i>nkx2.1</i> and <i>arx</i>. As with <i>arx</i>, <i>hh</i> expression within cholinergic neurons was heavily biased toward the VM region of the brain lobe, where 23.17\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.88% of these neurons expressed the signaling molecule (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). In addition, <i>hh</i> was expressed by nearly all VM GABAergic neurons (98.08\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.85), as well as a considerable proportion of octopaminergic neurons (33.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.23%) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D\u2013E</a>). Although a limited number of DL GABAergic, dopaminergic, and serotonergic neurons exhibited <i>hh</i> expression (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>), VM neurons appear to be the main source of the planarian <i>hh</i> signaling molecule."

Both <i>nkx2.1</i> and <i>arx</i> were found to be expressed within these cells and a total of 31/168 cells expressed at least one factor (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>). Importantly, <i>nkx2.1</i><sup>+</sup> or <i>arx</i><sup>+</sup> stem cells demonstrated high expression levels of established stem cell markers/regulators (<i>piwi-1</i>, <i>piwi-2</i>, <i>piwi-3</i>, <i>Smed-bruli</i>, <i>Smed-tdrd1L2</i>, <i>Smed-chd4</i>), and cell cycle genes (<i>Smed-mcm2</i>, <i>Smed-pcna</i>, <i>Smed-cyclinB-2</i>) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>) (<a href=\"#bib72\">Zhu et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">van Wolfswinkel et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Guo et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Reddien and S\u00e1nchez Alvarado, 2004</a>). In addition, many cells displayed expression of established and putative neuronal transcription factors (<i>Smed-coe</i>, <i>Smed-cas</i>, <i>Smed-hb-2</i>, <i>Smed-mitfl-2</i>, <i>Smed-da</i>, <i>Smed-isl-1</i>) and mature neural markers (<i>Smed-synapsin</i>, <i>Smed-pc-2</i>) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>) (<a href=\"#bib15\">Cowles et al., 2013</a>, <a href=\"#bib16\">2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Hayashi et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Scimone et al., 2014</a>). Several of these <i>nkx2.1</i><sup>+</sup> or <i>arx</i><sup>+</sup> stem cells also exhibited expression of <i>ptc, smo, or gli-1</i> (7/31 cells) and at least one of the nine <i>fz</i> receptors (14/31) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>). Parallel expression analyses were performed on the dataset of 84 single ASCs from the whole body of the worm with similar conclusions (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) (<a href=\"#bib70\">Wurtzel et al., 2015</a>). Finally, <i>ptc</i> expression within <i>nkx2.1</i><sup>+</sup> and <i>arx</i><sup>+</sup> neural progenitors was also observed in vivo based on dFISH combined with immunostaining against the PIWI-1 protein (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

This was performed by RNAi knockdown of the <i>hh</i> ligand, resulting in decreased signaling activity, or by knockdown of the <i>ptc</i> receptor (a negative regulator of pathway activity), resulting in increased <i>hh</i> signaling levels (<a href=\"#bib56\">Rink et al., 2009</a>). Neural progenitor cells were then visualized by taking transverse sections through the brain, and imaging PIWI-1<sup>+</sup> stem and progenitor cells in between the brain lobes for expression of several transcription factors of putative neural stem/progenitors (<i>nkx2.1</i>, <i>arx</i>, <i>lhx1/5\u20131</i>, <i>coe</i>, and <i>pax6a</i>) (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib18\">Currie and Pearson, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Cowles et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Pineda et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Scimone et al., 2014</a>). <i>hh(RNAi)</i> and <i>ptc(RNAi)</i> animals were investigated for changes to the percentage of PIWI-1<sup>+</sup> stem/progenitor cells expressing these neural transcription factors. Silencing of the planarian <i>hh</i> ligand resulted in a significant reduction of expression for all five neural transcription factors within PIWI-1<sup>+</sup> cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). In contrast, levels of neural progenitor cells were largely unchanged in <i>ptc(RNAi)</i> animals, with the exception of <i>coe</i> and <i>pax6a</i> which exhibited a small but significant increase in PIWI-1<sup>+</sup> cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>)."

Therefore, in order to investigate whether <i>hh</i> signaling levels regulate neuronal homeostasis and the production of new cholinergic neurons, a BrdU pulse-time chase experiment was performed. Following gene silencing of <i>hh</i> or <i>ptc</i>, RNAi-treated animals were exposed to a single pulse of BrdU. After 6- and 9-day chase periods, newly generated cholinergic neurons were detected by FISH for <i>chat</i> expression as well as nuclear BrdU staining (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C\u2013E</a>). The level of neurogenesis was then quantified by counting the number of <i>chat</i><sup>+</sup>BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells observed within 30-\u00b5m-thick confocal stacks from within the planarian brain. <i>hh(RNAi)</i> animals consistently displayed significantly lower cholinergic neural homeostasis both after 6-day (~35% reduction) and 9-day chase periods (&gt;40% reduction), while silencing of <i>ptc</i> had little effect (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C\u2013F</a>). To investigate whether this decrease in neuronal homeostasis levels affected the intact nervous system, long-term RNAi experiments were performed (10 feedings), and all five neuronal populations were examined. Of particular interest were the VM cholinergic, GABAergic, and octopaminergic neural populations, which express the <i>hh</i> ligand (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C\u2013E</a>). However, decreased <i>hh</i> signaling did not affect the intact population of any neuronal cell type (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplements 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s2\">2</a>; see Discussion)."

Importantly, these other planarian tissues were largely unaffected by perturbations to <i>hh</i> signaling, except for the eyes, which exhibited reduced progenitor cell numbers in <i>hh(RNAi)</i> animals, and increased BrdU incorporation after <i>ptc</i> knockdown (<a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplements 3</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s4\">4</a>).

This work has demonstrated that two planarian homeodomain transcription factor homologs, <i>nkx2.1</i> and <i>arx</i>, function in the long-term maintenance of cholinergic, GABAergic, and octopaminergic neurons in the VM region of the planarian CNS (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). Surprisingly, these same three VM neural cell types were also found to express the <i>hh</i> signaling molecule (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C\u2013E</a>). Neuronal <i>hh</i> expression was also confirmed by using a scRNAseq dataset that included mature neurons (<a href=\"#bib70\">Wurtzel et al., 2015</a>), and additionally revealed that all four of the sequenced <i>hh</i><sup>+</sup> neurons co-expressed a planarian Wnt ligand, <i>Smed-wnt11-6</i> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3I</a>). Specialized <i>nkx2.1</i><sup>+</sup> or <i>arx</i><sup>+</sup> neoblasts were also identified, which were typically localized adjacent to the VM region of the planarian CNS, and express key members of the <i>hh</i> and Wnt signal transduction machinery (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). Finally, the planarian <i>hh</i> pathway was found to be required to maintain steady levels of neurogenesis in the intact brain, as a reduction in <i>hh</i> signaling activity, led to decreased production of neural stem/progenitor cells and newly generated cholinergic neurons (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G</a>)."

Previous studies have shown that the Wnt ligand <i>Smed-wnt11-6</i> and Wnt antagonist <i>Smed-notum</i> are expressed by cholinergic neurons, and that this Wnt signal acts on planarian stem cells to repress neuron production and prevent posterior expansion of brain tissue during regeneration (<a href=\"#bib30\">Hill and Petersen, 2015</a>). Interestingly, we show that several planarian neurons simultaneously express this repressive Wnt ligand as well as the <i>hh</i> signaling molecule, which promotes the production of neurons (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3I</a> and <a href=\"#fig6\">6G</a>). Conceptually, it makes sense that signals originating from the mature CNS, would act to repress neurogenesis programs. This would help to establish a steady-state system, which modulates neurogenesis levels depending on the size of the existing CNS. However, our observations suggest that contrary to this model, neuronal sources of <i>hh</i> actively promote neurogenesis levels in both the brain and of eye photoreceptors neurons (<a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplements 3</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s4\">4</a>)."

Similar to mechanisms of Hh action in other systems, the regulatory loops are likely to be complex in planarians due to the fact that long-term <i>hh(RNAi)</i>, surprisingly, did not produce robust neural deficits over a span of five weeks (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplements 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig6s2\">2</a>). Perhaps with body-wide changes in proliferation in <i>hh(RNAi)</i>, rates of neural cell death are also decreased, leading to little change in neuronal populations (<a href=\"#bib56\">Rink et al., 2009</a>). Similarly, in the mammalian CNS, expression of Shh from differentiating and mature neurons is required to maintain normal proliferation levels of embryonic neural precursors and adult neural stem cells, respectively (<a href=\"#bib4\">\u00c1lvarez-Buylla and Ihrie, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Ihrie et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Fuccillo et al., 2006</a>)."

Computationally, neural-committed stem cells, termed \u03bdNeoblasts, were recently detected and may be the targets of brain-derived signals (<a href=\"#bib42\">Molinaro and Pearson, 2016</a>). However, while <i>nkx2.1</i><sup>+</sup> and <i>arx</i><sup>+</sup> stem cells exhibit a spatial distribution and transcriptional profile suggestive of neuronal lineage commitment (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5G</a>), without definitive lineage-tracing studies, these neoblasts cannot yet be classified as true neural stem cells."

This is not typical of arthropods (<a href=\"#bib41\">Matise, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Arendt and N\u00fcbler-Jung, 1999</a>). It is interesting to speculate that VM neural fates in planarians are specified using mechanisms more associated with chordates. In support of this idea, the role of <i>nkx2.1</i> and <i>arx</i> in the maintenance of planarian cholinergic and GABAergic neurons was particularly noteworthy (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>), as their mammalian counterparts (Nkx2.1 and Arx) are known to fulfill similar roles and also be under the control of <i>sonic hedgehog</i> (<a href=\"#bib33\">Jessell, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Colasante et al., 2008</a>). In the embryonic rodent ventral telencephalon, Nkx2.1 acts in upstream neural progenitor cells to produce both cortical GABAergic interneurons and striatal cholinergic interneurons (<a href=\"#bib10\">Butt et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Lopes et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Sussel et al., 1999</a>), whereas Arx functions downstream in the terminal differentiation and migration of cortical GABAergic interneurons (<a href=\"#bib67\">Vogt et al., 2014</a>). Notwithstanding this slight deviation in cell fate determinism, it appears that these two transcription factors have retained a remarkable degree of functional conservation across this significant evolutionary gap."

This manuscript addresses the contribution of hedgehog signaling to the regulation of several neuronal cell populations in the planarian brain. The text is well written, the work is elegant and well executed, and the images look clear. Its findings should be of interest to a wide audience interested in neurogenesis."

Searching for signals originating in this ventromedial brain domain that could regulate neurogenesis, they find that hedgehog is expressed within VM neurons. The authors analyze a prior single-cell RNAseq study to identify <i>hedgehog<sup>+</sup></i> cells as being mainly neuronal, with the feedback target patched expressed in several populations of neoblasts including brain progenitors. Furthermore, <i>hh</i> RNAi animals had reduced numbers of brain progenitors within the neoblast population, including <i>nkx2.1</i><sup>+</sup> and <i>arx</i><sup>+</sup> neoblasts, and also these animals had reduced incorporation of new <i>chat</i><sup>+</sup> neurons into the brain, arguing for a direct function for <i>hh</i> signaling in promoting neurogenesis. Finally, this differentiation program has importance for CNS function as <i>nkx2.1</i> and <i>arx</i> inhibited animals present with behavioral abnormalities."

The authors also now convincingly demonstrate that effects of <i>hh</i> RNAi and <i>ptc</i> RNAi on BrdU incorporation and progenitor numbers is specific to the CNS (and eye) and not pharynx, epidermis and gut. Therefore, the influence of <i>hh</i> and <i>ptc</i> on brain progenitors are not likely to be due to a global alteration of neoblast proliferation or differentiation rates. Finally, text changes have improved the flow of the paper, including the change to the discussion/presentation of the Wnt data which has improved the focus of the paper.

However, for the eyes, we do observe a decrease in the production of eye progenitors after <i>hh</i> RNAi, and an increase in BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells in the mature eye after <i>ptc</i> RNAi. It should be noted that the marker used to identify the eyes, <i>Smed-ovo</i>, largely marks the photoreceptor neurons of the visual system (Lapan and Reddien, 2012).

The accompanying text now reflects not needing to describe \u03c3, zeta, or \u03b3 neoblasts (from old <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>), but now must introduce X1/\u03a72 terminology where appropriate. The Wurtzel heatmaps from our previous version are still included but now in <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>."

This also translates to dFISH experiments, where <i>nkx2.1</i> and <i>arx</i> are technically challenging to detect with standard tyramide amplification. The same is true of <i>hh</i> by sequencing and FISH. Therefore, we know that both the sequencing and dFISH are an underestimation of the overlap of these various gene expression patterns due to being near the limits of detection for both methods. We did not, of course, expect much overlap between <i>nkx2.1</i> and <i>hh</i> in <i>chat</i><sup>+</sup> neurons due to only ~36% of VM <i>chat</i>+ cells express <i>nkx2.1</i> and only ~23% express <i>hh</i>, in addition to the lack of phenotype in <i>nkx2.1(RNAi)</i> on <i>hh<sup>+</sup></i> neurons (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3G</a>). We do expect <i>nkx2.1</i> and <i>hh</i> expression to overlap in GABAergic and Octopaminergic neurons (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D-E</a>; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C-E</a>; <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We have now quantified these stains and shown that 63/353 <i>hh<sup>+</sup></i> cells also express <i>nkx2.1</i> (<a href=\"#fig3s3\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). <i>arx</i>, on the other hand, has much more overlap with <i>hh</i> expression (191/269 neurons counted), and this is no surprise given the strong phenotype of <i>arx(RNAi)</i> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>)."
