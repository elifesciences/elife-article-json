While axonal responses to individual guidance cues have been extensively studied, less is known about responses to combination of signals and underlying molecular mechanisms. Here, we studied the convergence of signals directing trajectory selection of spinal motor axons entering the limb. We first demonstrate that Netrin-1 attracts and repels distinct motor axon populations, according to their expression of Netrin receptors. Quantitative in vitro assays demonstrate that motor axons synergistically integrate both attractive or repulsive Netrin-1 signals together with repulsive ephrin signals. Our investigations of the mechanism of ephrin-B2 and Netrin-1 integration demonstrate that the Netrin receptor Unc5c and the ephrin receptor EphB2 can form a complex in a ligand-dependent manner and that Netrin\u2013ephrin synergistic growth cones responses involve the potentiation of Src family kinase signaling, a common effector of both pathways."

While axonal responses to individual guidance cues have been extensively studied, less is known about responses to combination of signals and underlying molecular mechanisms. Here, we studied the convergence of signals directing trajectory selection of spinal motor axons entering the limb. We first demonstrate that Netrin-1 attracts and repels distinct motor axon populations, according to their expression of Netrin receptors. Quantitative in vitro assays demonstrate that motor axons synergistically integrate both attractive or repulsive Netrin-1 signals together with repulsive ephrin signals. Our investigations of the mechanism of ephrin-B2 and Netrin-1 integration demonstrate that the Netrin receptor Unc5c and the ephrin receptor EphB2 can form a complex in a ligand-dependent manner and that Netrin\u2013ephrin synergistic growth cones responses involve the potentiation of Src family kinase signaling, a common effector of both pathways."

Muscles are activated by nerve cells called motor neurons found in the spinal cord. The connections between the motor neurons and muscles are established in the developing embryo. Each motor neuron produces a long projection called an axon whose growth is guided towards the target muscle by signal proteins. The motor neurons are exposed to many such signal proteins at the same time and it is not clear how they integrate all this information so that their axons target the correct muscles."

This information is transduced inside growth cones via dedicated intracellular signaling pathways, eventually modulating cytoskeletal dynamics. How multiple pathways interact and compound the limited molecular diversity of axon guidance cues to produce the rich complexity of nerve trajectories is unclear (<a href=\"#bib17\">Dickson, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Kolodkin and Tessier-Lavigne, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Tessier-Lavigne and Goodman, 1996</a>)."

                        "text": "Multiple modes of axon guidance signaling pathway interaction have been documented. Axon guidance ligand co-incidence can result in emergent growth cone behaviors that are qualitatively different from those induced by either cue alone (<a href=\"#bib5\">Bielle et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Kuwajima et al., 2012</a>). The exposure to one cue can also silence the response to another, as Slit silences Netrin-1 attraction in commissural axons, allowing them to continue their journey past the nervous system midline (<a href=\"#bib65\">Stein, 2001</a>). Contrasting these is signal co-operation, where co-activation of two pathways changes the magnitude of growth cone responses, but not their quality. Co-operative steering of a growth cone in the same direction could entail two co-localized congruent cues, either both repellent or attractants, or two opposing cues, where a repellent reinforces the decision to grow towards an attractant cue (<a href=\"#bib19\">Dudanova et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Schmitt et al., 2006</a>). At the molecular level, co-operating axon guidance signaling pathways can intersect in additive or synergistic manners. Additive integration involves the summation of responses to individual cues implying parallel signaling pathways intersecting at the level of actin stability, as observed in additive phenotypes of mutations affecting motor axon guidance and muscle target selection in <i>Drosophila</i> and in vertebrates (<a href=\"#bib41\">Kramer et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Winberg et al., 1998</a>). Synergistic integration, that is, whose magnitude, when the signals are coincident, is greater than the sum of the effects of separate signals, implies signaling pathways intersecting at an intermediate step. It has been observed for congruent cues, such as bone morphogenetic proteins, whose repulsive signal integration occurs at the level of their receptors (<a href=\"#bib12\">Butler and Dodd, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Yamauchi et al., 2008</a>), and for Sonic Hedgehog and Ntn1 (<a href=\"#bib63\">Sloan et al., 2015</a>). Despite this growing list of signal intersection modalities (<a href=\"#bib20\">Dudanova and Klein, 2013</a>), their precise molecular mechanisms at a simple axon guidance waypoint are still unclear.\u00a0One such point is traversed by spinal lateral motor column (LMC) axons as they enter the vertebrate limb where lateral and medial LMC axons diverge to form, respectively, dorsal and ventral limb nerves (<a href=\"#bib46\">Lance-Jones and Landmesser, 1981</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Tosney and Landmesser, 1985</a>). A molecular model of this event implicates limb mesenchyme ephrin signaling to LMC growth cone tyrosine kinase Eph receptors. Lateral LMC growth cone expression of EphA receptors and medial LMC growth cone expression of EphB receptors results in their repulsion from cognate ephrin-A and ephrin-B ligands present in the ventral and dorsal limb mesenchyme, respectively (<a href=\"#bib21\">Eberhart et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Helmbacher et al., 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Kania and Jessell, 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Luria et al., 2008</a>). Additional mechanisms, such as reverse signaling from Eph receptors or semaphorins and glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) in the limb, co-operate with forward ephrin-A:EphA signaling to contribute to the fidelity of LMC axon trajectory choice (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bonanomi et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Chai et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Dudanova et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Huber et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Kao and Kania, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Kramer et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Marquardt et al., 2005</a>). These observations imply a fragmented molecular logic of spinal motor axon guidance \u2013 ephrin:Eph forward signaling as a common effector of all LMC axon guidance, integrating with molecularly diverse LMC-subpopulation specific cues."

Modulatory signals such as Slit and transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) act at the level of DCC to change Netrin-1 responses (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bai et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Leyva-Diaz et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Stein, 2001</a>) or to set the sensitivity of repulsive Netrin receptors (<a href=\"#bib52\">MacNeil et al., 2009</a>).

                                "text": "To determine whether Netrin-1 receptors are present in developing LMC neurons, we first compared their mRNA expression in mouse spinal cord sections with that of medial and lateral LMC neuron markers, <i>Isl1</i> and <i>Lhx1</i>, respectively, between e10.5 and e11.5 (<a href=\"#bib70\">Tsuchida et al., 1994</a>). <i>Unc5c</i>, a repulsive Netrin-1 receptor gene, was expressed in Isl1<sup>+</sup> medial LMC neurons (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1I,J</a>), while <i>Dcc</i> and Neogenin1 (<i>Neo1</i>), encoding attractive Netrin-1 receptors, were expressed by both LMC divisions at hindlimb and forelimb levels (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1K,L</a>; <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Detection of Unc5c protein using an antibody raised against its C terminus, and Isl1 and Lhx1, confirmed that Unc5c is present in medial LMC neurons, but not in lateral LMC neurons (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>; data not shown). Co-detection of DCC and Isl1 or Lhx1 proteins indicated that DCC is expressed by both LMC divisions (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>; data not shown). Examination of motor and sensory nerves near their spinal cord and dorsal root ganglion exit, before they merge into mixed sensory-motor nerves, revealed that DCC is present exclusively on motor axons, while Unc5c is expressed at high levels in motor axons with some expression in sensory axons (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In the limb, high levels of Unc5c protein were present in ventral limb nerves (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1M\u2013O</a>), consistent with its medial LMC expression, while DCC was detected in both dorsal and ventral nerves (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1N\u2013O</a>), consistent with its pan-LMC expression. Additional analysis revealed that mouse <i>Dscam</i> and <i>Unc5a</i> were expressed in all LMC neurons, while <i>Unc5b</i> and <i>Unc5d</i> were not detected in this population (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Chick <i>Unc5b</i> and <i>Unc5c</i> were expressed in medial LMC neurons while <i>Unc5b</i> and <i>Neo1</i> mRNAs were found in all LMC neurons (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1S\u2013V</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Altogether, these studies suggested that dorsal limb Ntn1 may play a dual role in LMC axon guidance, attracting lateral LMC axons that do not express Unc5c into the dorsal limb, and repelling Unc5c-expressing medial LMC axons into the ventral limb (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1W</a>)."

In all strains examined, the specification of LMC neurons, their axon outgrowth, and Eph and ephrin expression was normal (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>; data not shown). To examine LMC axon trajectory selection, we injected the retrograde tracer horseradish peroxidase (HRP) into the ventral or dorsal limb muscles of <i>Ntn1</i><sup><i>Gt/Gt</i>\u00a0</sup>and Netrin receptor mutant embryos and determined the divisional identity of labeled LMC neurons using the marker Foxp1 (<a href=\"#bib16\">Dasen et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Rousso et al., 2008</a>), and the medial LMC marker Isl1 (<a href=\"#bib51\">Luria et al., 2008</a>). All our retrograde tracing observations were confirmed using an alkaline phosphatase medial LMC reporter transgene or Unc5c and EphA4 axonal staining (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). When HRP was injected into the ventral limb to detect aberrant lateral LMC axons, in <i>Dcc</i> mutants 9.7% of HRP-labeled neurons were medial LMC, compared with 4.4% in controls, 4.7% in <i>Ntn1<sup>Gt/Gt</sup></i> and 5.6% in <i>Unc5c</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A\u2013H</a>; p=0.164, 1, and 0.748 for <i>Dcc<sup>-/-</sup>, Ntn1<sup>Gt/Gt</sup></i>, and <i>Unc5c</i><sup>-/-</sup> vs. controls; all values listed in <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1B</a>).

This repulsive effect was abolished in medial LMC neurons electroporated with the siRNA targeting <i>Unc5c</i>, an effect that was rescued by expression of mouse Unc5c (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H,I</a>; 48% on N, 52% on Fc stripes, p&lt;0.01; 28% on N, 72% on Fc stripes, p=0.281).

We considered the possibility that simultaneous application of Netrin-1 and ephrin-B2 at concentrations that do not elicit a stripe preference on their own could result in their summation exceeding a threshold required for a preference response. Thus, signals at subthreshold concentrations could elicit a growth cone response when presented together, through simple additive means. However, we reasoned that a stripe preference evoked by simultaneous exposure to Netrin-1 and eB2 concentrations that are each <i>half or less</i> of those subthreshold concentrations not eliciting stripe preference when alone, would indicate synergistic co-operation between Netrin and ephrin signaling since simple arithmetic additivity could not account for the crossing of a threshold. Thus, we tested whether a reduction to 50%, 25%, and 10% of our standard ephrin-B2 and Netrin-1 concentrations (C<sub>50</sub>, C<sub>25</sub>, and C<sub>10,\u00a0</sub>respectively) is sufficient to abolish the stripe assay response by LMC growth cones to individual cues, and whether, at these concentrations, their co-incidence rescues stripe preference.

Together, our biochemical experiments indicate that concomitant stimulation with ephrin-B2 and Netrin-1 induces the formation of an EphB2-Unc5c receptor complex and increases EphB2 tyrosine phosphorylation levels, commensurate with elevated biological activity."

Additionally, since some studies and our experiments point to a role for SFKs in Netrin-1:Unc5 signaling (<a href=\"#bib72\">Williams et al., 2006</a>), we considered SFK involvement in the integration of Netrin-ephrin activities. First, we observed that SFKs were not required for the formation of the Unc5c-EphB2 complex (data not shown). Second, we considered whether eB2 and Netrin-1 co-incidence could result in SFK activation being higher than that induced by either ligand alone. We examined the levels of SFK-activating phosphorylation\u00a0(pSFK;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib7\">Boggon and Eck, 2004</a>), in LMC growth cones treated with Fc, eB2, Netrin-1, and both eB2 and Netrin-1. After 15 min, following ligand application\u00a0but before completion of growth cone collapse, increasing doses of eB2 generated increased LMC growth cone pSFK signal that coincided with EphB receptor clusters, while Netrin-1 alone failed to induce pSFK, when compared with Fc treatment (<a href=\"#fig7s1\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 1</a>; data not shown).

Our most direct evidence of this is the contrasting response of cultured medial and lateral LMC axons to Netrin-1 protein, which depends on (1) the selective expression of Unc5c in medial LMC neurons, and (2) the expression of attractive Netrin receptors in LMC neurons. Unc5c loss results in decreased repulsion from Netrin-1 in vitro and entry of medial LMC axons into the dorsal limb in vivo while inhibition of attractive Netrin receptors leads to a loss of lateral LMC axon preference for growth on Netrin-1. In line with previous data (<a href=\"#bib28\">Hong et al., 1999</a>), Unc5c signaling dominates over attraction to Netrin-1, since over-expression of Unc5c in LMC neurons results in more LMC axons entering the ventral limb. Following this logic, the growth of <i>Unc5c</i> mutant medial LMC axons into the dorsal limb of mice might be caused by the loss of the dominant repulsive receptor uncovering Netrin attraction. However, since in vitro loss of Unc5c function in LMC neurons does not uncover an increased preference for Netrin-1 stripes, it is plausible that attractive Netrin-1 receptors in medial LMC axons are not functional in the context of our assays."

However, Netrin-1 can also act as a short range, non-diffusible signal (<a href=\"#bib10\">Brankatschk and Dickson, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Timofeev et al., 2012</a>) and in our in vitro assays, medial and lateral LMC axons exhibit robust and specific responses to immobilized Netrin-1. Additionally, since Netrin-1 protein localization in the limb matches closely that of its mRNA, Netrin-1 likely functions as a contact-dependent axon guidance cue for LMC growth cones at the limb nerve bifurcation abutting the Netrin-1 expression domain. One corollary of this, based on non-vertebrate models of Netrin repulsion (<a href=\"#bib36\">Keleman and Dickson, 2001</a>), would be the lack of requirement for attractive Netrin receptors for short range Unc5c-mediated LMC axon guidance, in agreement with our genetic experiments showing that DCC is dispensable for Unc5c-mediated medial LMC guidance. <i>Unc5c</i> mutation causes more severe medial LMC guidance defects than <i>Ntn1</i> mutation.

How can the in vitro and in vivo data be reconciled? One possibility is that non-Netrin-1 lateral LMC guidance cues such as ephrin-As in the ventral limb are operational even when Netrin-1 attractive receptors are removed, preserving the high fidelity of lateral LMC axon trajectory choice. It is also possible that the 10% of wild-type <i>Neo1</i> protein levels produced from the <i>Neo1</i> hypomorphic allele (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bae et al., 2009</a>) are sufficient to elicit normal attraction to Netrin-1 in lateral LMC axons and synergize with other axon guidance cues in the limb."

Our argument against simple additivity of ephrin and Netrin-1-evoked responses is based on the quantitative analysis of neurite growth preferences. Thus, observable\u00a0effects from the\u00a0combination of ligands,\u00a0each at\u00a0concentrations of less than half of\u00a0a\u00a0sub-threshold concentration (without effect on its own), implies synergy and not additive mechanisms. Our stripe assays exhibited similar overall outgrowth in all conditions, and detected a robust axon guidance response to ephrin and Netrin-1 even at 1/10th of concentrations insufficient for ephrin or Netrin-1 to elicit an effect on their own. Moreover, these responses reflect the bifunctional nature of Netrin-1\u2019s chemotropic activity: Netrin-1 attraction synergizes with ephrin-A repulsion of lateral LMC neurons while Netrin-1 repulsion synergizes with ephrin-B repulsion of medial LMC axons. Thus, contrasting modes of synergistic integration occur in related populations of spinal motor neurons, possibly reflecting the evolutionary advantage of axon guidance synergy. Furthermore, it is likely that the molecular mechanisms that integrate two repulsive cues, and an attractive cue with a repulsive cue are fundamentally different, even if the cues are molecularly related as is the case for ephrin-As and ephrin-Bs."

Our experiments suggest a two-step model of congruent ephrin-Netrin synergy, likely starting at the receptor level (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). As a first step of our model, independent of ligands, a considerable fraction of EphB and Unc5c receptors on the surface of medial LMC growth cones is apparently found in the same membrane compartment, contrasting the non-overlapping distribution of some ephrins and Eph receptors (<a href=\"#bib53\">Marquardt et al., 2005</a>). Such membrane compartment co-existence might facilitate the formation of EphB2-Unc5c complexes following the addition of ephrin-B2, as detected in our biochemical assays. Importantly, this effect is ligand-specific, and signaling through the EphB2 receptor is important since tyrosine kinase point mutation inhibits complex formation. The second step involves the action of Ntn1 alone or in conjunction with ephrin-B2, through EphB2-Unc5c complexes, resulting perhaps in the activation of novel downstream signaling pathways, or increased activation of common intracellular effectors. In support of the second possibility, Netrin-1 presence increased EphB2 tyrosine-phosphorylation, a correlate of Eph receptor activation required for many of its functions (<a href=\"#bib77\">Zisch et al., 1998</a>). We also found that the coincidence of ephrin-B2 and Netrin-1 resulted in prolonged activating phosphorylation of SFKs when compared with that induced by ephrin-B2 alone, and that SFK function is required in LMC neurons for ephrin-B2-Ntn1 synergistic responses. Thus, since <i>Src</i> mutation abolishes the fidelity of medial LMC limb nerve selection (<a href=\"#bib34\">Kao et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Liu et al., 2004</a>), the second step might entail increased EphB2 and Src kinase activity leading to more intense activation of common signaling pathways. The fact that SFK inhibitors could not totally block repulsive growth cone responses upon Netrin-1-ephrin-B2 stimulation raises the interesting possibility that additional, non-SFK mechanisms integrating Netrin-ephrin signaling exist. Furthermore, the genetic observation that in EphB1 and EphB3 mutants many medial LMC axons can be labeled from dorsal limb muscles (<a href=\"#bib51\">Luria et al., 2008</a>), raises the question of whether the EphB2-Unc5c interaction is a general property of B-class Eph receptors."

With additive signals, blocking one completely would have only partial effect on the overall fidelity of LMC trajectory selection. However, in the case of synergistic signals, taking out most of a signal might still leave enough of it to synergize with its partner pathway since this effect can occur at suboptimal signal levels. Completely inactivating a synergizing signal will lead to extreme effects where its partner might not function efficiently enough to maintain LMC axon pathway selection fidelity. In this view limb-expressed GDNF and ephrin-A appear as additive signals, such that deleting one of them results only in a partial loss of LMC trajectory choice fidelity (<a href=\"#bib41\">Kramer et al., 2006</a>). However, genetic perturbation of ephrin and Netrin signaling in medial LMC axons suggest a synergistic interaction: loss of EphB signaling leads to severe medial LMC axon guidance phenotypes (<a href=\"#bib51\">Luria et al., 2008</a>), as does the loss of Unc5c in the present study, arguing against redundancy between the two systems, and together with our in vitro data, for synergy. Synergistic integration of axon guidance cues might endow neurons with a powerful means of preventing potential axon guidance errors caused by fluctuations in expression levels of guidance receptors and their ligands."

Through a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments, they propose that Unc5c-mediated repulsion has a synergistic effect when combined with EphB2 signaling, and that this may in part be due to convergence on Src kinase activation. The analysis of the in vivo phenotypes is clear and compelling, and increases our understanding of the role of Netrin receptors during motor axon guidance. The in vitro stripe assay and growth cone collapse assay are powerful and allow for precisely measuring the effect of combining different cues on axon behavior. How a growth cone integrates its responses to different extracellular cues remains largely unknown. Both in vivo and in vitro data support the hypothesis that synergy occurs between Unc5c and EphB2 signaling in LMC motor neurons, and although a mechanistic understanding of how this synergy is achieved remains incomplete, this work addresses an important question and lays the foundation for future research investigating these mechanisms in more detail."

                    "text": "In mice and chick embryos, Netrin-1 is enriched in the dorsal limb and Unc5c is expressed in ventrally projecting LMC-m neurons at stages when LMC axons select their trajectory. While all LMC neurons express DCC or Neogenin, there are no guidance defects in the dorsally projecting LMC-l axons in the absence of Netrin or its attractive receptors. In contrast, a significant number of LMC-m axons mis-project in the absence of Netrin or Unc5c (though DCC is not required for LMC-m guidance). In vitro, chick LMC-m axons are repelled by Netrin1+ stripes in an Unc5c-dependent manner, whereas LMC-l axons are attracted to Netrin1+ stripes in a Neogenin-dependent manner. Combining low doses of ephrinB2 and Netrin1 (less than half of the sub-threshold concentrations of each) results in a significant avoidance response by LMC-m axons; a similar effect is observed on growth cone collapse. Similarly, LMC-l axons are more strongly attracted to sub-threshold amounts of Netrin-1 when they are alternated with sub-threshold amounts of ephrinA5. Though the mechanism for this synergistic effect is not further explored, the authors undertake several experiments addressing the relationship between Unc5c and EphB2. Unc5c and EphB2 form a complex when over-expressed in vitro, and this interaction is increased upon ephrinB2 treatment and requires EphB2's kinase activity. Netrin treatment does not enhance the interaction between Unc5c and EphB2, but increases the phosphorylation levels of EphB2. Finally, the authors propose that signaling downstream of both receptors may converge on Src kinases, as treatment of LMC-m axons with both ligands for a sustained period of time increases the levels of phospho-Src compared to treatment with either alone. Growth cone collapse in response to ephrinB2 and Netrin1 is partially suppressed by treating with a Src kinase inhibitor, and over-expression of Csk suppresses LMC-m avoidance of Netrin1+ and ephrinB2+ stripes, providing important functional data to support the hypothesis that both pathways act through Srcs."

It is acknowledged that this may not be possible, however, depending upon the viability of the null mutation."

It would be nice if it were possible to analyze these phenotypes in the recently published Netrin null mice described by Kennedy, Kania and colleagues. It is acknowledged that this may not be possible, however, depending upon the viability of the null mutation.</i>"

Complete Loss of NetrinJ1 Results in Embryonic Lethality and Severe Axon Guidance Defects without Increased Neural Cell Death. Cell Rep 12, 1099\u20131106 (2015). Unfortunately, most <i>Netrin1</i> nulls die around e10.5/e11.5 while some escapers make it to e14.5. In order to compare the incidence of LMC projection errors in <i>Netrin1</i> null mice to those reported in the present manuscript, we envisioned doing retrograde labelling from limb muscles. This analysis is normally done at e12.5 (forelimb) or e13.5 (hindlimb) and thus would take more than six months to complete given mutant mice availability and the rare occurrence of <i>Netrin1</i> null embryos of those ages. Crosses of the <i>Netrin1</i> nulls into different genetic backgrounds are ongoing. Alternatively, we could cross the ZJ Crest::alkaline phosphatase medial LMC reporter into the <i>Netrin1</i> null background and study e11.5 embryos, but this analysis would not quantify lateral LMC errors, and would need two mouse generations."

In the few sections that contained dorsal and ventral limb nerves, we quantified the incidence of <i>Unc5c<sup>+</sup></i> axons in the dorsal limb nerve as a proportion of total Unc5c signal in the dorsal and ventral limb nerves. These data are appended to the end of this letter, and indicate that more <i>Unc5c<sup>+</sup></i> axons enter the dorsal limb of <i>Netrin1</i> nulls than those of controls. However, this experiment is difficult to interpret since Netrin1 absence could be locally affecting Unc5c expression levels, as it does for <i>Dcc</i> (Bin et al.), and relatively few limb sections were available for quantification. Also, in contrast to retrograde labelling, this experiment does not allow us to make a quantitative comparison with the <i>Unc5c</i> mutant phenotype. Finally, as we emphasized in the Discussion, the reduced phenotype in <i><i>Ntn1</i><sup>Gt</sup></i> mutants (compared to <i>Unc5c</i> mutants) could be due to the presence of redundant Unc5c ligands in the dorsal limb. To be fairer, we now give equal importance to both possibilities in the Discussion."
