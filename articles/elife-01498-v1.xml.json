While it is known that neuronal MTs are more stable than MTs in non-neuronal cells, the molecular mechanisms underlying this stability are not fully understood. In this study, we used live fluorescence microscopy to show that the <i>C. elegans</i> CAMSAP protein PTRN-1 localizes to puncta along neuronal processes, stabilizes MT foci, and promotes MT polymerization in neurites. Electron microscopy revealed that <i>ptrn-1</i> null mutants have fewer MTs and abnormal MT organization in the PLM neuron. Animals grown with a MT depolymerizing drug caused synthetic defects in neurite branching in the absence of <i>ptrn-1</i> function, indicating that PTRN-1 promotes MT stability. Further, <i>ptrn-1</i> null mutants exhibited aberrant neurite morphology and synaptic vesicle localization that is partially dependent on <i>dlk-1</i>. Our results suggest that PTRN-1 represents an important mechanism for promoting MT stability in neurons."

While it is known that neuronal MTs are more stable than MTs in non-neuronal cells, the molecular mechanisms underlying this stability are not fully understood. In this study, we used live fluorescence microscopy to show that the <i>C. elegans</i> CAMSAP protein PTRN-1 localizes to puncta along neuronal processes, stabilizes MT foci, and promotes MT polymerization in neurites. Electron microscopy revealed that <i>ptrn-1</i> null mutants have fewer MTs and abnormal MT organization in the PLM neuron. Animals grown with a MT depolymerizing drug caused synthetic defects in neurite branching in the absence of <i>ptrn-1</i> function, indicating that PTRN-1 promotes MT stability. Further, <i>ptrn-1</i> null mutants exhibited aberrant neurite morphology and synaptic vesicle localization that is partially dependent on <i>dlk-1</i>. Our results suggest that PTRN-1 represents an important mechanism for promoting MT stability in neurons."

Microtubules have a number of important roles inside cells: they are part of the cytoskeleton that provides structural support for the cell; they help to pull chromosomes apart during cell division; and they guide the trafficking of proteins and molecules around inside the cell. Most microtubules are relatively unstable, undergoing continuous dis-assembly and re-assembly in response to the needs of the cell. The microtubules in the branches of nerve cells are an exception, remaining relatively stable over time. Now Richardson et al. and, independently, Marcette et al., have shown that a protein called PTRN-1 has an important role in stabilizing the microtubules in the nerve cells of nematode worms."

In the PVD neuron, the dendritic arbor consists of processes that branch perpendicularly from each other, getting progressively thinner with each branching event (<a href=\"#bib2\">Albeg et al., 2011</a>). Accordingly, EMTB::GFP fluorescence in the PVD neuron was strong in the primary dendrites but weak and sometimes discontinuous in the tertiary and quaternary dendrites, likely because these narrow neurites contain few MTs (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s4\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4A,B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib2\">Albeg et al., 2011</a>)."

These puncta appeared to be MT ends. Hence, the disorganized MT strands are anchored at the regularly spaced loci on or near the plasma membrane. The angle and spacing of the MT lines at the sarcolemma suggest that they run parallel and perhaps adjacent to the dense bodies (the <i>C. elegans</i> equivalent of Z-discs) and M-lines. This microtubule organization in the body wall muscle cells resembles the pattern observed by fluorescence-labeled ELP-1, the <i>C. elegans</i> EMAP (Echinoderm Microtubule-Associated Protein)-like protein (<a href=\"#bib31\">Hueston et al., 2008</a>). In mammalian muscle fibers, MTs filaments form both a grid-like organization aligned with the Z-discs, which is dependent on dystrophin (<a href=\"#bib49\">Prins et al., 2009</a>), and squiggles in the cytosol with less apparent organization (<a href=\"#bib50\">Ralston et al., 1999</a>)."

Because the <i>C. elegans</i> cuticle is largely impermeable to colchicine, we performed this experiment in the <i>bus-17(e2800)</i> genetic background, which has increased permeability to drugs, including colchicine (<a href=\"#bib35\">Leung et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Gravato-Nobre et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Bounoutas et al., 2009</a>). Acute colchicine treatment dramatically altered the distribution of EMTB::GFP such that fibers were no longer visible. Small EMTB::GFP foci remained at the cell membrane and in the cell interior, along with a haze of fluorescence throughout the cytosol (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A,B</a>). Since EMTB::GFP normally binds to the sidewalls of MTs (<a href=\"#bib22\">Faire et al., 1999</a>), this change in its distribution confirms that the colchicine treatment led to MT depolymerization, as expected. The localization of PTRN-1a::tdTomato appeared to be unaffected by the acute colchicine exposure, and the PTRN-1a::tdTomato puncta co-localized with the EMTB::GFP puncta both at the sarcolemma and in the cell interior (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A\u2013D</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). These data show that, in the body wall muscle cells, the localization of PTRN-1a puncta is not dependent on MTs. They further imply that PTRN-1a localizes to sites where MTs are stabilized, even under conditions that cause complete depolymerization of all other MTs in the cell. Finally, because PTRN-1a::tdTomato and EMTB::GFP puncta exhibit a regular, repeating pattern at the sarcolemma, the fact that these rows are unaffected by the acute colchicine treatment indicates that these puncta represent sites of MT anchorage."

In the DD/VD-type motorneurons, the cell bodies are situated in the ventral nerve cord (VNC), and a single unbranched commissure per cell connects processes in the VNC with those in the dorsal nerve cord.

Our data suggest that PTRN-1 binds to MT minus ends and protects them from depolymerization in neuronal processes. Multiple lines of evidence support this conclusion. First, PTRN-1 localized to puncta throughout the neuronal processes that directly bind and stabilize MTs. Of note, electron microscopy reconstruction of neurites in the VNC showed that MT ends are staggered, with an average distance between minus ends of roughly 1.7 \u03bcm (<a href=\"#bib15\">Chalfie and Thomson, 1979</a>). Second, our electron microscopy data revealed that the <i>ptrn-1(tm5597)</i> mutant strain had fewer total MTs and some MTs with abnormal structure in the PLM neuron. Third, the <i>ptrn-1</i> mutant exhibited a pharmacogenetic enhancement with colchicine in respect to neurite morphology. Fourth, the <i>ptrn-1</i> mutant exhibited a reduction in the number of neurite MT polymerization events as determined by counting EBP-2::GFP movements.

Because <i>D. melanogaster</i> Patronin protects MTs from kinesin-13-mediated depolymerization (<a href=\"#bib25\">Goodwin and Vale, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Wang et al., 2013</a>), these modifications are an attractive candidate for how MTs are stabilized in the absence of <i>ptrn-1.</i> Defective regulation of \u03b1-tubulin acetylation, another prevalent posttranslational tubulin modification in neurites, causes abnormal neurite morphology and function in both mice and <i>C. elegans</i> (<a href=\"#bib19\">Creppe et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Topalidou et al., 2012</a>), though its effect on MT stability is uncertain and may be circumstance-dependent (<a href=\"#bib32\">Janke and Kneussel, 2010</a>)<i>.</i> In <i>C. elegans,</i> electron microscopy studies have shown that the loss of \u03b1-tubulin acetyltransferases causes a decrease in MT abundance, increase in MTs with irregular protofilament number, and appearance of MTs in which the protofilament lattice had opened into semicircular or sheet-like structures (<a href=\"#bib20\">Cueva et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Topalidou et al., 2012</a>). Further, the loss of the \u03b1-tubulin acetyltransferase MEC-17 in the PLM neuron causes an increase in dynamic MTs and, in older adult animals, loss of synaptic material at the synaptic region accompanied by accumulation of synaptic material in the posterior process (<a href=\"#bib44\">Neumann and Hilliard, 2014</a>)."

A higher dose of colchicine caused similar ectopic branching in the PLM neuron of the wild-type strain, indicating that MT destabilization is sufficient to elicit this phenotype. What is the mechanism by which MT destabilization leads to the neurite outgrowth from axons? When collateral branches form along an axon, the budding branch and surrounding axon have fewer, shorter MTs than regions of the axon with no collateral branching (<a href=\"#bib66\">Yu et al., 1994</a>). Further, pharmacological or genetic manipulations that decrease MT stability have been shown to cause neurite outgrowth along the length of mature neurites (<a href=\"#bib8\">Bray et al., 1978</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Yu et al., 2008</a>). Perhaps the combination of <i>ptrn-1</i> mutation with colchicine results in fewer, shorter MTs in these neurites, and this MT status promotes ectopic sprouting. Alternatively, the response to MT destabilization resulting from loss of PTRN-1 function may be more akin to the regeneration response to an axonal lesion, since this also results in ectopic branching and growth cone formation in motor and sensory neurons (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hammarlund et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib63\">Yan et al., 2009</a>)."

In addition, because there are many neurites in the nerve cord, it is impossible to identify them without a complete reconstruction, which is a huge effort that was only achieved a couple of times in the history. Therefore, due to the large variability of MT numbers between neurites and the inability to identify individual neurons, we did not attempt to compare the number of MTs in the VNC between wild-type and the <i>ptrn-1</i> mutant. We did state that MT shape and protofilament number appeared grossly wild-type, but with so few MTs examined, perhaps we should not have attempted to make any statement regarding the VNC MTs from our EM data.

At the sarcolemma, the rows of PTRN-1a::tdTomato and EMTB::GFP puncta can be seen both before and after the acute colchicine exposure, indicating that PTRN-1 localizes to sites of MT anchorage near the muscle membrane. Considering this, along with the fact that the size, spacing, and abundance of PTRN-1 puncta plus EMTB::GFP in the PVD dendrite appears unaffected by acute colchicine exposure, we might have inferred that MTs are likewise anchored at (though not necessarily by) PTRN-1 puncta in the neurites.
