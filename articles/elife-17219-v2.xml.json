However, at these resolutions, accurately positioning individual atoms remains challenging and error-prone. Manually refining thousands of amino acids \u2013 typical in a macromolecular assembly \u2013 is tedious and time-consuming. We present an automated method that can improve the atomic details in models that are manually built in near-atomic-resolution cryo-EM maps. Applying the method to three systems recently solved by cryo-EM, we are able to improve model geometry while maintaining the fit-to-density. Backbone placement errors are automatically detected and corrected, and the refinement shows a large radius of convergence. The results demonstrate that the method is amenable to structures with symmetry, of very large size, and containing RNA as well as covalently bound ligands. The method should streamline the cryo-EM structure determination process, providing accurate and unbiased atomic structure interpretation of such maps."

However, at these resolutions, accurately positioning individual atoms remains challenging and error-prone. Manually refining thousands of amino acids \u2013 typical in a macromolecular assembly \u2013 is tedious and time-consuming. We present an automated method that can improve the atomic details in models that are manually built in near-atomic-resolution cryo-EM maps. Applying the method to three systems recently solved by cryo-EM, we are able to improve model geometry while maintaining the fit-to-density. Backbone placement errors are automatically detected and corrected, and the refinement shows a large radius of convergence. The results demonstrate that the method is amenable to structures with symmetry, of very large size, and containing RNA as well as covalently bound ligands. The method should streamline the cryo-EM structure determination process, providing accurate and unbiased atomic structure interpretation of such maps."

Cryo-EM reconstructions at these resolutions, at which individual \u03b2-strands are resolvable and bulky sidechains are somewhat visible, make it possible to build an all-atom model directly from such maps (<a href=\"#bib21\">Kudryashev et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Wang et al., 2015</a>). Although sequence can be registered, density maps at this range of resolution do not grant enough information to assign coordinates for each atom in the structure precisely, and thus they cannot always capture molecular interactions for a biochemical process. Furthermore, such model building and refinement is challenging and error prone (<a href=\"#bib13\">DeLaBarre and Brunger, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Brunger et al., 2009</a>). Nevertheless, determination of detailed atomic interactions from these sparse sources of data is desirable.\u00a0However, the inherent ambiguity in the data makes accurately identifying molecular interactions extremely difficult, even for experts."

This process requires identification of key amino acid sidechains to register stretches of sequence within the map (possibly aided by information\u00a0on\u00a0the topology of a homologous structure), followed by extension of these short fragments of sequence to form one or more fully connected protein chains. At near-atomic resolution, this manual model-building and refinement can be error prone because: (a) the density may not be of sufficient resolution to identify sidechain rotamers\u00a0uniquely, even for bulky aromatic residues, making it difficult to determine sidechain-sidechain or sidechain-backbone interactions\u00a0accurately; (b) for regions of non-regular secondary structure (turns or loops) or with poor local resolution, it may be difficult to position backbone atoms\u00a0accurately; and (c) in these same regions, precise sequence registration may also be error prone. Getting these atomic interactions correct is crucial for understanding detailed atomic mechanisms of protein\u00a0activities, for\u00a0designing drugs with a very specific shape complementarity, and for understanding subtle conformational changes of a protein. A structure refinement procedure that can automatically improve the atomic details of a model from such density data is thus very much desired."

Our new approach includes a method for automatically detecting and correcting problematic residues in hand-built models without overfitting, a model-selection method for identifying models with good agreement to the density data and with physically realistic geometry, a voxel-size refinement method for correcting errors in calibrating the magnification scaling factor of a microscope, an improved sidechain-optimization method to correct sidechain placement errors in very large systems, and a way to estimate uncertainty in a refined model. These methods, combined, allow the\u00a0tool\u00a0to correct backbone errors that significantly deviate from the starting model, but\u00a0it may still assign a high degree of confidence to these regions in the refined model."

Refinement in this stage is restricted to using one-half of the data, referred to as the training map. (Middle) In stage 2, the best models from the ~5000 independent Monte Carlo trajectories are selected. Models are selected based: on\u00a0agreement to the validation map (independently constructed from the other half of the data), then by model geometry as assessed by MolProbity, and finally, on agreement to the full reconstruction. At this point, the selected models should in general have good fit-to-density and good geometry without overfitting to the data. (Right) In stage 3, using the 10 best models selected, we then optimize against the full reconstruction. Two half maps are used to\u00a0choose\u00a0the optimal density weight to refine structures using full-reconstruction. Finally, these top 10 models are optimized (without large-scale backbone rebuilding) into the full-reconstruction, which alternates with voxel-size refinement iteratively. Finally, these models are subject to B-factor refinement."

Broadly, the approach proceeds in three stages. In the first stage, we identify problematic residues by assessing local model-strain and local agreement to density data. These problematic\u00a0regions are rebuilt against a 'training' half-map using fragment-based Monte Carlo sampling with many independent trajectories followed by all-atom refinement. Second, the best subset of these independent trajectories are selected by identifying a subset of stereochemically correct models with best agreement to an independent 'validation' half-map, to prevent overfitting. Finally, models are further optimized in the full-reconstruction with a weight optimally scaled between experimental data and the forcefield using the 'validation' half map. Our approach adopts and improves upon our previous work on refining cryo-EM structures from distant homology structures (<a href=\"#bib14\">DiMaio et al., 2015</a>), in which a similar fragment-based backbone rebuilding strategy was employed. However, several crucial improvements were necessary in extending our previous work to successfully refine hand-traced models, larger complexes, and a more diverse set of systems."

Unlike remote homology models, hand-traced models typically fit the data very well, but are incorrect geometrically (in terms of strain). Consequently, a key improvement is to make use of model strain as a criterion in selecting regions to refine. Moreover, when this previous approach was applied to the <i>de novo</i> hand-traced models from cryo-EM maps, we observed\u00a0that in incorrect regions, the models still fit the density well, but did so by introducing strain into the nearby bond angles and torsions. This often occurred near the\u00a0C\u03b2 atom of aromatic residues, where strain was introduced to fit the sidechain into the\u00a0density (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We reasoned that\u00a0the backbone was incorrect in these strained residues; by correcting the backbone, we would be able to fit a non-strained sidechain into density. Thus, local strain can serve as an indicator to identify regions that could be refined to improve both the fit-to-density and the\u00a0model geometry. We developed an error predictor by constructing a function (see Materials and methods) that assesses both local model-map agreement and local model-strain. Using a training dataset composed of error-containing models of a cryo-EM map in which the structure has been determined by X-ray crystallography (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), we show that the new error predictor offers better discrimination of incorrectly versus correctly placed backbone, with an AUPRC (area under precision-recall curve) of 0.80 versus 0.76 using density alone (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). In cases where models are hand-built into density, we expect this strain term to play an even larger role, as fit-to-data is expected to have larger influence on the initially constructed model."

Moreover, the\u00a0density of certain bulky sidechains, such as those containing Lys and Arg, tends to be less well-defined than their backbone density. This missing density dramatically affects the convergence of conformational sampling during structure refinement, during\u00a0which sidechains tend to be fit into density corresponding to backbone atoms. To compensate for this, we downweigh the contributions of sidechains which are less resolved in cryo-EM density. Down-weighing factors for each amino acid were determined by comparing the average per-amino-acid real-space B-factor on two cryo-EM reconstructions with known high-resolution crystal structures (20S proteasome [<a href=\"#bib22\">Li et al., 2013</a>] and \u03b2-galactosidase [<a href=\"#bib5\">Bartesaghi et al., 2014</a>]), with the ratio of backbone and sidechain average B-factors being\u00a0used to derive the scaling factors.

Further refinement (with the addition of the Ankyrin repeat domain) was made using the lowest energy disulfide-containing model as a starting point.\u00a0This disulfide has previously been identified and characterized in the literature as playing an important role in the TRPV1 channel's response to oxidative stress (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chuang and Lin, 2009</a>); this, combined with our model's ability to better explain a tube of density that is unaccounted for in the deposited model, let us speculate that this disulfide bond is present in the cryo-EM reconstruction. The discovery of this linkage also illustrates the magnitude of conformational change that may be captured by our protocol; our Monte Carlo backbone sampling strategy allows refinement to overcome energy barriers that other methods using density minimization alone cannot overcome. Despite the magnitude of these changes, the conformational ensemble is well converged in this region (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, right panel), providing further confidence in our refined model."

For this, we chose the 3.4-\u00c5 reconstruction of the F<sub>420</sub>-reducing [NiFe] hydrogenase complex, in which the asymmetric unit contains three protein chains which feature together with a [NiFe] cluster, two metal ions, four [4Fe4S] clusters that are covalently bound to cysteine sidechains, and a flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). The complex is a dodecamer with tetrahedral symmetry, with 12 copies of a 902-residue molecule of three protein chains. We used the <i>-auto_setup_metals</i> option of Rosetta to maintain covalent linkages between protein and ligand during refinement (full input files are included as <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>). The results of refinement are indicated in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> and <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>; the MolProbity score improves from 3.98 to 1.59, and the EMRinger score improves from 1.06 to 2.17, but the iFSC drops from 0.743 to 0.708. We reason that the decrease of fit-to-density at high-resolution (10\u20133.4\u00c5) shells may be a result of overfitting the model to the density map; the deposited model was forced to fit the density by deviating the likely geometry observed in high-resolution crystal structures. This overfitting hypothesis is well supported by a high number of bad clashes and 39% rotamer outliers found in the deposited model (<a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>)."

In all cases, we show that we are able to improve model geometry significantly\u00a0while maintaining good agreement to the density data. We show that model convergence can be used to suggest local model uncertainty in addition to B-factors.

Two features of our refinement approach regarding the use of prior\u00a0information are crucial\u00a0to the success of this large-scale refinement. First, the use a physically realistic forcefield throughout refinement handles the under-constrained nature of refinement at these resolutions, using chemical 'domain knowledge' learned from high-resolution crystal structures to implicitly fill in the missing information in the data. Second, our fragment-based rebuilding ,\u00a0which explicitly samples the most likely backbone conformations given a short stretch of sequence, also uses prior information gathered from high-resolution protein structures, further restricting conformation space and filling in additional information that\u00a0is\u00a0not present in the data."

The observation of the slightly decreased of fit-to-density but significant improvement of model geometry bolsters the importance of using prior\u00a0information (such\u00a0as\u00a0sidechain rotatmers), as well as\u00a0of having a refinement scheme to monitor model overfitting."

Enhancing the predicting power of the Rosetta modeling methods is key to pushing the resolution limit of the current refinement method further. This can be achieved by improving: (1) the energy function (forcefield) used in structure refinement, and (2) conformational sampling methodology, particularly for systems for which secondary structure prediction is poor. Further improvements in the role of B-factor sharpening and its effect on refinement, as well as better predictors of local model error are necessary. Finally, structure refinement in maps that have highly heterogeneous local resolution remains challenging because a single set of refinement parameters cannot readily be applied at all regions. Methodological improvements that allow the adjustment of parameters based on local map quality will be essential to refine structures accurately from such maps. In our effort to enable automated structure refinement for large macromolecular assemblies, we hope that this method will be a valuable tool for determining atomically accurate structures from near-atomic-resolution cryo-EM data."

The approach is based upon the idea of neighbor residues, where residue neighbors are defined as all residues with a C\u03b2-C\u03b2 distance less than 8\u00c5. We first find the residue <i>r<sub>i\u00a0</sub></i>with the most residue neighbors. Then we optimize the neighbors of <i>r<sub>i</sub></i>, and the neighbors-of-neighbors of <i>r<sub>i</sub></i>: the neighbors are allowed to optimize both sidechain and backbone conformation, while the neighbors-of-neighbors may only optimize sidechain conformation. This optimization is performed via Monte Carlo sampling of sidechain rotamers, followed by Cartesian minimization of all movable atoms. Following this, all neighbors of <i>r<sub>i</sub></i> (as well as <i>r<sub>i</sub></i>) are marked as visited, and the process repeats, selecting a new <i>r<sub>i</sub></i> as the unmarked residue with the most neighbors. This process continues until all residues are marked. In total, four cycles of this procedure are carried out, increasing the weight on van der Waals repulsion in each cycle. Finally, following coordinate refinement with <i>LocalRelax</i>, we fit atomic B-factors following the scheme described\u00a0in our previous paper (<a href=\"#bib14\">DiMaio et al., 2015</a>)."

The authors implemented (1) procedures to detect regions where the fit of manually built models produced strain in the local geometry as a consequence of misfitting the map or as a consequence of inaccuracy of the magnification parameter. Other improvements include (2) voxel size refinement, which may resolve the magnification inaccuracy of cryoEM maps; (3) side chain down-weighting during refinement, which may be proper for cryoEM maps since the molecules are not packed and therefore side chains less well defined compared to backbone; (4) refinement against the full map at the final stage."

Maybe there was a slight mismatch in the symmetry operators used to generate the entire assembly. If one fits each subunit rigidly into the density (e.g. in Chimera) then all subunits fit very well (also with the original voxel size of 1.320). <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a> and the \"deposited\" items in panels B and C should therefore be removed.

More importantly, we feel our iterative approach \u2013 cycling between refinement and voxel spacing optimization \u2013 captures some of the agreement between forcefield and voxel spacing. We performed a related experiment, which we feel more accurately captures model errors. Using the same target as above (4ake) we ran short Rosetta MD trajectories followed by minimization; these cycles were repeated until models fell ~3\u00c5 RMS from the native structure. The result was 50 models each 2.9-3.1\u00c5 from native with relatively good energy."

The shift shown in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a> is not a result of voxel size error, but is likely due to the fact that the authors of the F420 structure (PDBID 4ci0) did not carefully generate the biological assembly structure. Maybe there was a slight mismatch in the symmetry operators used to generate the entire assembly. If one fits each subunit rigidly into the density (e.g. in Chimera) then all subunits fit very well (also with the original voxel size of 1.320). <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a> and the \"deposited\" items in panels B and C should therefore be removed.

Therefore, we chose to refine the structure with the deposited voxel size (1.320). We have removed the <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a> and panels as suggested by the reviewers, and highlight instead the geometry improvement of the model following refinement. The Frh statistics in <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a> and <a href=\"#tbl2\">Table 2</a> were updated, in response to the new experiments from the new starting point.
