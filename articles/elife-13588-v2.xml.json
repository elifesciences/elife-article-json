However the probability of receiving a reward changed during testing, and in some cases, reversed, meaning that the highest rewarded object was no longer rewarded when chosen and vice versa. While at first the monkeys did not know which choice was the right one, they quickly learned and changed their choices during the test according to which option resulted in them receiving the most reward."

Instead monkeys with damage to the mediodorsal thalamus could make different choices but they struggled to use information from their most recent choices to best guide their future behavior. Specifically, the pattern of the monkeys\u2019 choices suggests that the mediodorsal thalamus helps to quickly link recent choices that resulted in a reward in order to allow an individual to choose the best option as their next choice."

Converging evidence suggests that the integrity of orbital and medial parts of prefrontal cortex supports the ability to use feedback to allow rapid regulation of choice behavior and to shift from search to persist modes of responding (<a href=\"#bib20\">Hayden et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Khamassi et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Morrison et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Walton et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">2011</a>).

The MD is heavily interconnected with the prefrontal cortex, and also receives inputs from the amygdala and ventral striatum (<a href=\"#bib2\">Aggleton and Mishkin, 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Goldman-Rakic and Porrino, 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">McFarland and Haber, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Ray and Price, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Russchen et al., 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Timbie and Barbas, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Xiao et al., 2009</a>). Causal evidence from animal models indicates that MD provides a critical contribution in many reward-guided learning and decision-making tasks, particularly those requiring rapid adaptive updating of stimulus values (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chudasama et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Corbit et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Mitchell and Dalrymple-Alford, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Mitchell et al., 2007b</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Mitchell and Gaffan, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Ostlund and Balleine, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Parnaudeau et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Wolff et al., 2015</a>).

Moreover, intact communication between MDmc and OFC (as well between MDmc and amygdala) is critical for rapid updating of reward-guided choices (<a href=\"#bib9\">Browning et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Izquierdo and Murray, 2010</a>). Lesions to both MD and OFC have been shown to cause deficits on discriminative reversal learning tasks, a finding frequently accompanied by perserveration of choice to the previously rewarded stimulus (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chudasama et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Clarke et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Floresco et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Hunt and Aggleton, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Ouhaz et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Parnaudeau et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Chudasama and Robbins, 2003</a>). This suggests that the main role for MDmc is to promote flexibility by supporting OFC in inhibiting responding to the previously highest value stimulus and/or learning from negative feedback. However, recent functional imaging, electrophysiology and lesion studies have refined theories of OFC function, suggesting it might play an important role in contingent value assignment or in determining the state space to allow such learning to be appropriately credited (<a href=\"#bib25\">Jocham et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Walton et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Takahashi et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Wilson et al., 2014</a>). Therefore, a second possibility is that the MD plays a key role in adaptive decision making by facilitating the rapid contingent learning performed by OFC-centered networks."

Indeed, in addition to the OFC, the MDmc also has connections to several other parts of rostral, ventral and medial prefrontal cortex (<a href=\"#bib19\">Goldman-Rakic and Porrino, 1985</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">McFarland and Haber, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Ray and Price, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Xiao et al., 2009</a>). These regions are known to be important not just for value learning, but also for aspects of value-guided decision making such as computing the evidence for persisting with a current default option or to switch to an alternative (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chau et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Boorman et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Noonan et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Kolling et al., 2014</a>). Based on this evidence, we predicted that the role of MDmc might go beyond simply enabling OFC-dependent contingent learning and might also directly regulate decisions about when to shift from a search strategy (sampling the alternatives to build up a representation of their long-term value) to a persist strategy (repeating a particular stimulus choice)."

To perform adaptively, the monkeys had to learn about, and track, the values associated with 3 novel stimuli through trial-and-error sampling and use this information to decide whether or not to persist with that option. In some task conditions (referred to as \u2018Stable\u2019 or \u2018Variable\u2019 schedules: see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), the reward probabilities linked to each stimulus would change dynamically and the identity of the highest value would reverse half way through each session; in others, the probabilistic reward assignments remained fixed throughout the session. If the MDmc is critical for inhibiting responses to a previously rewarded stimulus, then the monkeys with MDmc damage will <i>only</i> be impaired post-reversal and will display perseverative patterns of response selection. If, on the other hand, the MDmc supported contingent learning, these lesioned monkeys would show impairments akin to those observed in monkeys with OFC damage (<a href=\"#bib38\">Noonan et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Walton et al., 2010</a>). That is, MDmc-lesioned monkeys would not only be slower to update their choices post-reversal or, in Fixed situations where they had to integrate across multiple trials to determine which option was best, they would also exhibit aberrant patterns of stimulus choices such that a particular reward would be assigned based on the history of all past choices rather than to its causal antecedent choice. Alternatively and finally, if the MDmc is required to regulate adaptive choice behavior, then the lesioned animals would also have a deficit post-reversal or in any Fixed schedules when multiple options are rewarding, but this would be characterized by an impairment in determining when to shift from search to persist modes of responding."

Instead, the monkeys with MDmc damage were strikingly deficient at re-selecting a sampled alternative after a search choice that yielded a reward \u2013 i.e., they were more likely to select a different stimulus to that chosen on the previous trial. Further analyses suggested this was caused by the MDmc-lesioned monkeys exhibiting less influence of associations based on their most recent stimulus choices coupled with an intact representation of longer term choice trends, which impaired their ability to update their stimulus choices rapidly in situations when they had a varied choice history. Together, these findings support a novel, key contribution of MDmc in regulating adaptive responding."

While there were no significant interactions with lesion group x surgery in the pre-reversal period (all <i>F</i><sub>1,8</sub> &lt; 2.5, p&gt;0.15), there was a significant lesion group x surgery x previous outcome post-reversal (<i>F</i><sub>1,8</sub> &lt; 10.9, p=0.011). Further post-hoc tests showed that this effect was mainly driven by a selective increase for the MDmc group to show a tendency to switch to choosing a different stimulus just after having received a reward (increase in switching probability from pre- to post-MD surgery: 0.21 \u00b1 0.07, p=0.056), an effect less evident after no reward (0.06 \u00b1 0.08, p=0.47) or in the control animals after either outcome (reward: \u20130.04 \u00b1 0.06, p=0.56; no reward 0.02 \u00b1 0.05 p=0.74). This change in switching behavior highlights that, in addition to the absence of evidence for a reduction in sensitivity to negative feedback after an MDmc lesion, there was a change in how positive feedback influenced future choices, particularly in the post-reversal period. As can be seen in <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4b</a>, this change meant that in the post-reversal phase, monkeys with MDmc damage became no more likely to stay with a current choice after reward delivery than reward omission. In other words, when the identity of the highest value stimulus changed, the MDmc group, postoperatively, was severely impaired at using the receipt of reward as evidence to continue persisting with that particular previously chosen stimulus."

This meant that, after a long history of choosing one stimulus (e.g., option A), a new choice (e.g., option B) would be <i>less likely</i> to be reselected on the following trial after positive than negative feedback and the previously chosen stimulus A would be <i>more likely</i> to be reselected."

In a first analysis, we looked for the effect described above: whether an outcome \u2013 reward or no reward \u2013 received for choosing any particular option (\u2018B\u2019) might be mis-assigned to proximal choices of another option (\u2018A\u2019) as a function of how often \u2018A\u2019 had been chosen in the recent past ('choice history') (note, there were no changes in the \u2018B\u2019 reward likelihood as a function of lesion group, surgery or choice history: all <i>F</i>\u2019s &lt; 1.54, p\u2019s&gt;0.23). For this analysis, we collapsed across Stable and Variable conditions. As can be observed in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5a</a>, pre-operatively both groups were more likely to re-select the previous \u2018B\u2019 option after a reward than no reward across all choice histories. In contrast, post-operatively, the influence of the positive outcome significantly reduced in the MDmc group only (lesion group x surgery interaction: <i>F</i><sub>1,8</sub> = 6.32, p=0.036). Further, the number of recent \u2018A\u2019 choices made by the MDmc lesion group did <i>not</i> affect the likelihood of re-selecting option \u2018B\u2019; the MDmc group post-operatively were no less likely to re-select that option after a reward whether they had a short or long choice history on option \u2018A\u2019 (see <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5a</a>). Moreover, it was not the case that the influence of the recent outcome was being selectively mis-assigned to option \u2018A\u2019 based on recent choices, as was observed in the lateral OFC animals (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5b</a>). Instead, the MDmc group showed no overall significant change in their likelihood of reversing back to option \u2018A\u2019 again on the next trial, but rather showed a small increase in the likelihood of switching to the 3<sup>rd</sup> alternative, \u2018C\u2019 (A choice: group x surgery interaction: <i>F</i><sub>1,8</sub> = 2.75, p=0.14; C choice: group x surgery interaction: <i>F</i><sub>1,8</sub> = 7.33, p=0.027) (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5c</a>). In other words, after a recent switch, the MDmc lesion group was unable to use the past reward as evidence to reselect either their previous choice or even the option chosen most frequently over recent trials."

To test this difference formally, we directly compared the groups by re-running the ANOVAs now including the lateral OFC group. The analysis of the likelihood of re-selecting \u2018B\u2019 option again revealed a lesion group x surgery interaction (<i>F</i><sub>2,10</sub> = 7.08, p=0.012) but importantly, also now a lesion group x surgery x choice history interaction (<i>F</i><sub>6,30</sub> = 2.51, p=0.044). Post-hoc tests showed that, while both the MDmc and lateral OFC groups were on average significantly different to the controls (both p&lt;0.05), the influence of the choice history on the two groups was distinct: only the lateral OFC group post-surgery, but not the MDmc group or controls, exhibited a significant reduction in repetitions of \u2018B\u2019 choices after increasing numbers of previous \u2018A\u2019 choices (p=0.007). Moreover, while the \u2018B\u2019 repetition likelihood was reduced in the MDmc group compared to controls post-surgery, this only occurred\u00a0when the history of previous \u2018A\u2019 choices was p&lt;0.05 for A<sub>1</sub>B and A<sub>3</sub>B, p=0.08 for A<sub>2</sub>B).

Similarly, analysis of the likelihood of returning to option \u2018A\u2019 now revealed a lesion group x surgery interaction, driven by a significant overall increase in \u2018A\u2019 choices in the lateral OFC group that was not present in either the controls or MDmc lesioned animals. Therefore, unlike the lateral OFC lesion group, which displayed less precise and potentially maladaptive <i>learning</i> based on associating a past outcome with the history of recent choices, the behavior of the MDmc group was instead characterized by a reduced likelihood of repeating a rewarded choice after just having switched to that option."

Before surgery, both groups of monkeys were always more likely to persist with an option after being rewarded for that choice than if not rewarded, and this was not significantly influenced by choice frequency. However, post-operatively, although the MDmc lesioned monkeys again were no more likely to re-select the previous choice after reward than after no reward when that option had a low recent choice frequency, this impairment went away in situations when the monkeys had selected that same option on the majority of recent trials. This behavior resulted in a significant surgery x group x choice history interaction (<i>F</i><sub>2,16</sub> = 3.80, p=0.045). Therefore, the MDmc lesioned monkeys were just as proficient as controls at weighing the influence of positive over negative feedback in situations where they had a long choice history on the just chosen option, but not if they had seldom chosen that option in the recent past."

In the first set of experiments assessing learning and decision-making on the varying reward schedules, we found that the integrity of the MDmc is critical to allow monkeys to update their behavior efficiently following a reversal in the identity of the highest value stimulus. Similar deficits have been previously reported in studies using rats with complete MD lesions (<a href=\"#bib5\">Block et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Chudasama et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Parnaudeau et al., 2013</a>), an impairment often attributed to failure to prevent perseveration to a previously rewarded option or strategy, though see (<a href=\"#bib58\">Wolff et al., 2015</a>). However, such an explanation cannot account for the patterns of choices observed in the current study, as the monkeys with MDmc lesions were no more likely to persevere with the previously highest rewarded option post reversal than controls. In fact, what was most markedly altered in the post-reversal period in the MDmc group was the ability to reselect an option after a rewarded choice of that option. Without this faculty, the lesioned monkeys continued to show maladaptive switching between all three alternatives throughout the post-reversal period and never learned to persist with the new best option (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>)."

The lesioned monkeys were not reliably different from controls in the initial acquisition stage of the varying schedules, despite the use of stochastic reward associations and novel stimuli for each testing session (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). In other studies, similar results of no deficits during acquisition have also been observed. For example, in rodents, complete removal of MD leaves acquisition of serial 2-object visual discrimination learning or 2-choice conditional learning intact (<a href=\"#bib11\">Chudasama et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Cross et al., 2012</a>). Further, in other studies, monkeys with MD or MDmc lesions could acquire concurrent object discriminations when presented across sessions (<a href=\"#bib1\">Aggleton and Mishkin, 1983</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Browning et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Mitchell et al., 2007b</a>) and could implement a learned decision strategy (<a href=\"#bib31\">Mitchell et al., 2007a</a>). Equally, however, it was not that the MDmc is only required to perform appropriately when contingencies reverse. For example, during the Fixed schedules in the current study, the MDmc lesioned monkeys also had a reduced ability to find and persevere with the best option compared to the control monkeys in spite of the fact that the identity of the stimulus associated with the highest reward probability never changed in a session. In the Fixed schedule sessions, the value difference between the options is not substantial and selection of any of the three options could be rewarded, probabilistically."

OFC-lesioned monkeys also showed deficits on certain fixed schedules. Such a finding might be expected given that the MDmc is the part of MD with major reciprocal connections to the OFC. Indeed, recent behavioral evidence in rodents and monkeys has highlighted that the MD thalamus and cortex work as active partners in cognitive functions (<a href=\"#bib9\">Browning et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Cross et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Parnaudeau et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">2015</a>)."

The OFC impairment resulted from the loss of an ability to favor associations based on each choice and its contingent outcome, rather than ones based on non-contingent associations between recent history of all choices and all outcomes. This caused a paradoxical pattern of choice behavior such that the OFC-lesioned monkeys became <i>more</i> likely to reselect an option that had been chosen often in the past even if they had just received a reward for selecting an alternative. By contrast, there was no choice history effect in the MDmc lesioned monkeys. In fact, after a recent switch, these monkeys showed no bias towards either the just rewarded option <i>or</i> the alternative that had been chosen in the recent past, and instead were more likely to sample the 3<sup>rd</sup> option on the subsequent trial (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5a\u2013c</a>)."

Monkeys without an OFC had a selective reduction in the influence of past choice-outcome pairings (<a href=\"#bib53\">Walton et al., 2010</a>). In contrast, the MDmc group had a particular loss in the weight assigned to the <i>most recent past choices</i> (n-1 to n-3) and the last outcome, but no statistically reliable change across the past trials of precise paired associations between each choice and each outcome. This selective impairment meant that once the monkeys with MDmc damage had an extended choice history on one option (for instance, as occurred on certain sessions at the start of the Fixed schedules: <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7c</a>), they were just as able as control monkeys to use the outcomes gained from their choices to guide their future behavior. This ability could be seen when examining the monkeys\u2019 likelihood of reselecting a stimulus as a function of the number of times that option had been chosen in the past 5 trials (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5d</a>). While the controls and MDmc monkeys before surgery exhibited the expected bias to repeat a rewarded choice irrespective of recent history, post surgery the MDmc group only displayed this pattern if they had selected that option on multiple occasions within the recent past. This selective impairment in attributing reward to recent choices, accompanied by the sparing of a faculty to approximate associations based on\u00a0histories of choices and rewards, is consistent with theories that emphasize the importance of MDmc (and OFC) in goal-directed learning, which requires acquisition of specific future reward predictions of a choice, but not habit learning that relies on longer term trends in choices and outcomes (<a href=\"#bib40\">Ostlund and Balleine, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Bradfield et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Parnaudeau et al., 2015</a>)."

Several studies have suggested that MD might be particularly important during rapid task acquisition rather than performance based on previously acquired associations (<a href=\"#bib31\">Mitchell et al., 2007a</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">2007b</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Mitchell and Gaffan, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Mitchell, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Ostlund and Balleine, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Ouhaz et al., 2015</a>). Such a role is also consistent with the electrophysiology finding that some cells in monkey MDmc, as well as in more lateral parvocellular MD, are modulated both when making cue-guided actions and when receiving feedback post-response (<a href=\"#bib56\">Watanabe and Funahashi, 2004</a>). The ability to keep track of recent stimulus choices, and their predicted values, is of particular importance when monkeys are sampling alternatives in order to determine the values associated with different objects. At such times, an online representation, or 'hypothesis', of what alternatives <i>might</i> be worth sampling would allow rapid updating if their selection leads to a beneficial outcome. Therefore, the MDmc might be described as being critical to facilitate an appropriate balance between exploration and exploitation. However, rather than computing when and what to explore in order to gain valuable new information, functions ascribed to areas such as frontopolar and anterior cingulate cortex and their projecting neuromodulators (<a href=\"#bib6\">Boorman et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Donahue et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Frank et al., 2009</a>), the role of the MDmc might instead be to help facilitate re-selection and persistence with a beneficial option once it has been found."

Taken together with the MDmc lesioned monkeys\u2019 increased tendency to sample all three options during exploration, this evidence implies that MDmc is required to exert rapid regulation of stimulus-based choices, particularly when needing to decide when to stop searching and instead persist with a recently sampled optimal\u00a0option."

For each individual regression, the stimulus in question (e.g., \u2018A\u2019) would take the value of 1 whenever chosen and 0 whenever one of the other two stimuli (e.g., \u2018B\u2019 or \u2018C\u2019) was chosen. We then formed explanatory variables (EVs) based on all possible combinations of recent past choices and recent past rewards (trials n-1, n-2, \u2026, n-6). Each EV took the value of 1 when, for the particular choice-outcome interaction, the monkey chosen A and was rewarded, \u20131 when the monkey chose B or C and was rewarded, and the 0 when there was no reward. We then fit a standard logistic regression with these 36 EVs (25 EVs of interest and 11 additional confound regressors describing combinations of choice / outcome n-6).

A 1-in-10 series of sections was collected throughout the cerebrum that was expanded to a 1-in-5 series throughout the thalamus. All sections were mounted on gelatin-coated glass microscope slides and stained with cresyl violet."

The experiment follows up on an earlier line of lesion experiments in the OFC that used the same task set. This makes the results of this experiment particularly interesting, because MD provides major thalamic input into OFC, and the behavioral effects of lesion in both areas can be directly compared. In general, lesions of MD and OFC have somewhat similar effects on performance, in both cases degrading the ability to track the best option after a probability reversal. However, the MD-lesioned monkeys appeared to treat recent choice history differently, leading the authors to conclude that the MD group does \"not have a primary deficit\" in contingency learning but instead has a \"degraded representation\" of recent choices and recent outcomes."

After MDmc surgery, were the fixed schedules run before or after the stable/variable schedules?

However, these analyses raise several questions that should be addressed. For example, a key reported difference was the lack of effect of the MD lesion on contingency learning. However, the MD group appeared to have relatively poor contingency learning even before the lesion (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>), suggesting that these animals might not allow such an effect to be identified. Can the authors rule out this possibility? Moreover, the trial-by-trial analyses presented in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>, which are also interpreted as reflecting a \"pattern of choice history [that] is in marked contrast to monkeys with lateral OFC lesions,\" are not the exact same analyses presented in the OFC studies (Noonan et al., 2010, Walton et al., 2010). In addition, for any of these kinds of trial-by-trial choice analyses, were there any differences in the frequency with which the various patterns of choices (e.g., \"AB\", \"AAB\", etc., or number of \"B\" choices in past 5 trials) were rewarded for the different conditions tested (e.g., in control versus lesioned monkeys, who had different patterns of choices and therefore could have, in principle, had \"A\" and \"B\" choices for these analyses that were associated with different reward probabilities)? Do any of these choice patterns reflect perseveration with respect to spatial location, not just object identity? In general, it would be useful to directly compare OFC and MD groups on the exact same set of analyses."

Moreover, when did the reversal point occur (and was it predictable)? What governed the trial-by-trial fluctuations in reward probability in these conditions?

Given the effects on overall choice behaviour pre- and post-reversal, we therefore performed separate repeated measures ANOVAs on the pre-reversal and post-reversal data, which revealed a significant lesion group x surgery x previous outcome interaction in the post-reversal period. In the revised manuscript, we have outlined our analysis steps more clearly."

We then formed explanatory variables (EVs) based on all possible combinations of recent past choices and recent past rewards (trials n-1, n-2, \u2026, n-6). Each EV took the value of 1 when, for the particular choice-outcome interaction, the monkey chosen A and was rewarded, \u20131 when the monkey chose B or C and was rewarded, and the 0 when there was no reward. We then fit a standard logistic regression with these 36 EVs (25 EVs of interest and 11 additional confound regressors describing combinations of choice / outcome n-6).
