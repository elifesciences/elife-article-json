It exerts its function, at least in part, through repressing genes associated with epigenetic modification and cell differentiation. Here, we show that this repressive function is mediated through an ETO-family co-repressor Mtgr1, which tightly binds to the pre-SET/SET domains of Prdm14 and co-occupies its genomic targets in mouse ESCs. We generated two monobodies, synthetic binding proteins, targeting the Prdm14 SET domain and demonstrate their utility, respectively, in facilitating crystallization and structure determination of the Prdm14-Mtgr1 complex, or as genetically encoded inhibitor of the Prdm14-Mtgr1 interaction. Structure-guided point mutants and the monobody abrogated the Prdm14-Mtgr1 association and disrupted Prdm14's function in mESC gene expression and PGC formation in vitro. Altogether, our work uncovers the molecular mechanism underlying Prdm14-mediated repression and provides renewable reagents for studying and controlling Prdm14 functions."

It exerts its function, at least in part, through repressing genes associated with epigenetic modification and cell differentiation. Here, we show that this repressive function is mediated through an ETO-family co-repressor Mtgr1, which tightly binds to the pre-SET/SET domains of Prdm14 and co-occupies its genomic targets in mouse ESCs. We generated two monobodies, synthetic binding proteins, targeting the Prdm14 SET domain and demonstrate their utility, respectively, in facilitating crystallization and structure determination of the Prdm14-Mtgr1 complex, or as genetically encoded inhibitor of the Prdm14-Mtgr1 interaction. Structure-guided point mutants and the monobody abrogated the Prdm14-Mtgr1 association and disrupted Prdm14's function in mESC gene expression and PGC formation in vitro. Altogether, our work uncovers the molecular mechanism underlying Prdm14-mediated repression and provides renewable reagents for studying and controlling Prdm14 functions."

In mouse embryos, Prdm14 binds to and represses particular genes that promote a process by which the stem cells can change into other cell types. If Prdm14 is missing from pluripotent stem cells, these cells become more sensitive to signals that encourage them to become other types of cells, which can lead to the loss of pluripotency. Prdm14 contains a region called the SET domain. In other proteins, this domain can alter how DNA is packaged to help switch particular genes on or off.

The loss of Mtgr1 also leads to the loss of pluripotency in mouse stem cells and disrupts the formation of reproductive stem cells. Furthermore, Mtgr1 binds to the same genes as Prdm14. Next, Nady, Gupta et al. made synthetic proteins, termed monobodies, that bind to the Prdm14 SET domain. One such monobody enabled the authors to determine the three-dimensional structure of Prdm1 and Mtgr1, which revealed that the SET domain of Prdm14 has many points of contact with Mtgr1. Importantly, interaction between the two partners is crucial for these proteins to maintain pluripotency and promote the production of reproductive stem cells."

During mouse embryogenesis, Prdm14 is expressed in preimplantation embryos, where its asymmetric expression promotes allocation of cells toward the pluripotent inner cell mass (ICM) fate (<a href=\"#bib5\">Burton et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Nakaki and Saitou, 2014</a>). Prdm14 expression ceases in postimplantation epiblast cells and their differentiated progeny. However, during PGC specification from the epiblast, cells reacquire many transcriptional and epigenetic characteristics of the preimplantation state, and Prdm14 is re-expressed along with several other pluripotency-associated factors (reviewed in [<a href=\"#bib40\">Magn\u00fasd\u00f3ttir and Surani, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Saitou et al., 2012</a>]). The loss of Prdm14 in mice results in sterility associated with early germ cell deficiency, as cells fated to become PGCs fail to reacquire expression of key pluripotency factors and undergo epigenetic reprogramming (<a href=\"#bib70\">Yamaji et al., 2008</a>). Furthermore, overexpression of Prdm14 in epiblast-like cells (EpiLCs) is sufficient to induce PGCs in vitro (albeit with low frequency), suggesting a central role of Prdm14 in the mouse PGC regulatory network (<a href=\"#bib41\">Magn\u00fasd\u00f3ttir et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Nakaki et al., 2013</a>). Furthermore, Prdm14 is repressed in normal somatic tissues but is aberrantly reactivated in human malignancies of various tissue origin, including leukemias and lymphomas, breast, testicular, and lung cancers (<a href=\"#bib6\">Carofino et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Dettman et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Nishikawa et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Ruark et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib73\">Zhang et al., 2013</a>)."

These cells represent a so-called 'na\u00efve' pluripotent state, thought to resemble preimplantation embryo ICM and serve as a useful system for understanding early cell fate decisions (<a href=\"#bib46\">Nichols and Smith, 2009</a>). Loss of Prdm14 destabilizes mESCs and sensitizes them to differentiation stimuli, leading to acquisition of alternative embryonic states, such as the postimplantation epiblast state or extraembryonic endoderm state, and eventual depletion of the na\u00efve cell subpopulation (<a href=\"#bib38\">Ma et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Yamaji et al., 2013</a>). The differentiation in Prdm14<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> cells is thought to result from upregulation of signaling pathways such as the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) pathway and by widespread DNA hypermethylation (<a href=\"#bib23\">Grabole et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Hackett et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Leitch et al., 2013</a>). Indeed, genome-wide Prdm14 occupancy studies by chromatin immunoprecipitation with sequencing (ChIP-seq) suggest that these are direct effects of the loss of Prdm14, as Prdm14 occupies and represses the regulatory elements of genes involved in FGFR signaling and de novo DNA methylation (<a href=\"#bib36\">Leitch et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Ma et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Magn\u00fasd\u00f3ttir et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Yamaji et al., 2013</a>).

As a member of the PRDM family, Prdm14 contains both a zinc-finger array, responsible for sequence-dependent DNA binding (<a href=\"#bib38\">Ma et al., 2011</a>), and a PR domain that is related to the SET domain (Su(var)3\u20139, Enhancer-of-zeste and Trithorax) (<a href=\"#bib19\">Fog et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib30\">Hohenauer and Moore, 2012</a>). Many SET domains harbor methyltransferase activity for either histone or non-histone substrates (<a href=\"#bib13\">Del Rizzo and Trievel, 2011</a>). However, to date, no enzymatic activity has been reported for Prdm14, and interestingly multiple members of the PRDM family appear to be catalytically inactive. Instead, candidate-based co-immunoprecipitation studies implicated Polycomb complex PRC2 as a mediator of Prdm14-dependent repression (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chan et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Yamaji et al., 2013</a>).

We identified an ETO-family corepressor, myeloid translocation gene related 1 (Mtgr1, a.k.a. Mtg8r, Cbfa2t2, and Zmynd3), as a direct, stoichiometric partner of Prdm14. We demonstrate that Mtgr1 co-occupies Prdm14 target loci, and its deletion in mESCs results in phenotypes and gene expression defects similar to those observed upon loss of Prdm14. Moreover, Mtgr1 knockout cells show impaired induction of PGC-like cells in vitro. To further facilitate studies of the Prdm14-Mtgr1 complex, we mapped interaction domains and developed multiple synthetic binding proteins, termed monobodies, that specifically recognize the SET domain of Prdm14 in a manner independent of, or alternatively, competitive with Mtgr1. Taking advantage of the stabilizing effect of one such monobody, we obtained a crystal structure of the Prdm14-Mtgr1 complex, revealing an extensive interface and electrostatic interactions mediating the association of the two proteins. Furthermore, structure-guided mutagenesis of the interface and the use of an inhibitory monobody demonstrated the function of the complex in safeguarding pluripotency and PGC-like cell induction. Altogether, we report a multi-disciplinary study that advances our understanding of Prdm14 function, identifying Mtgr1 as the major partner of Prdm14 in its roles in pluripotency and PGC induction, and providing the community with renewable, genetically encoded reagents that can be used both in vitro and in vivo to study and control Prdm14 function in development and malignancy."

To confirm this, we first verified Prdm14 and Mtgr1 association using reciprocal co-immunoprecipitations from mESC nuclear extracts (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). Next, we mapped the minimal regions within Prdm14 and Mtgr1 that were required for the interaction by overexpressing differentially-tagged proteins (V5-Mtgr1 and FH-Prdm14) in HEK293 cells, followed by IP-Western analysis (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C, D</a>). This strategy revealed that the nervy homology region 1 (NHR1) domain of Mtgr1 was necessary and sufficient for the interaction with Prdm14, whereas both Prdm14 SET domain and the region directly preceding it (pre-SET) were important for efficient binding to Mtgr1 (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C, D</a>). To quantify the strength of the Prdm14\u2013Mtgr1 interaction, we next expressed and purified recombinant proteins corresponding to the NHR1 domain of Mtgr1 (residues 98\u2013206) and pre-SET+SET domains of Prdm14 (residues 184\u2013373), and performed a bead-based binding assay in reciprocal orientations (<a href=\"#bib48\">Nishikori et al., 2012</a>). The obtained binding measurements yielded a dissociation constant (<i>K</i><sub>D</sub>) in the low nanomolar range (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E and F</a>), which is consistent with a robust, direct interaction between the two proteins. On the other hand, the binding of the\u00a0Prdm14 SET domain alone (residues 232\u2013373) to the\u00a0Mtgr1 NHR1 domain was barely detectable (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1G</a>), further supporting that both pre-SET and SET domains are required for the high affinity interaction with Mtgr1."

                                "text": "Generally, the genomic occupancies of Mtgr1 and Prdm14 were well correlated (correlation coefficient ~0.9, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), and we have not been able to detect a substantial class of Prdm14-bound sites devoid of Mtgr1 occupancy (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). Not surprisingly, the Prdm14 and Mtgr1 sites shared common functional ontologies, with enrichment for processes involved in embryonic development and cell differentiation (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Furthermore, the most highly enriched DNA sequence motif at Mtgr1-bound sites corresponded to the previously identified Prdm14 motif (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>). Interestingly, we noted that, at many targets, Mtgr1 binding was enhanced by Prdm14 overexpression (see tracks in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, compare wt and <i>FH-Prdm14</i> ESC). This observation prompted us to quantitatively compare Mtgr1 ChIP-seq enrichments in wt ESCs and <i>FH-Prdm14</i> cells that are characterized by ~5-fold overexpression of Prdm14. We observed that Mtgr1 enrichments were higher in <i>FH-Prdm14</i> than in wt ESCs at most target sites, consistent with Prdm14-mediated recruitment of Mtgr1 to chromatin (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). However, we also noticed that a subset of Mtgr1 sites was bound more weakly in <i>FH-Prdm14</i> cells than in wt ESCs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>, examples shown in <a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). The major distinction between these two populations was the\u00a0presence of the Prdm14 sequence motif and Prdm14 occupancy at the sites where Mtgr1 binding was enhanced by Prdm14 overexpression, and lack of the Prdm14 sequence motif with low/no Prdm14 occupancy at the sites where Mtgr1 binding was diminished by Prdm14 overexpression (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>). Of note, at the Prdm14 motif-lacking sites, the most enriched sequence motifs corresponded to helix-loop-helix transcription factor recognition sites, suggesting that a TF from this family may be involved in mediating Mtgr1 binding at these sites (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>). Regardless, our results indicate that Prdm14 is sufficient to augment interaction of Mtgr1 with chromatin at its cognate binding sites and, at high levels, redirect it away from the motif-lacking sites. Thus, Prdm14 might be a limiting factor for Mtgr1 recruitment to chromatin. To test this notion further, we performed Mtgr1 ChIP-seq analysis from Prdm14<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> ESCs and generated average signal profiles at Prdm14 motif-containing and Prdm14 motif-lacking sites across all our Mtgr1 ChIP-seq datasets. We observed that at Prdm14 motif-containing sites, Mtgr1 binding is increased in FH-Prdm14 overexpressing cells and diminished (but not completely abrogated) in Prdm14<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> cells (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>, left panel). On the other hand, at Prdm14 motif-lacking sites, Mtgr1 binding is depleted by FH-Prdm14 overexpression, but it is also moderately affected in Prdm14<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> cells despite low/no Prdm14 binding at these sites, suggesting an indirect effect (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>, right panel). Altogether, these results are consistent with the Mtgr1 genomic occupancy being sensitive to the Prdm14 dosage (either loss or gain) at the Prdm14-motif containing sites. However, these results also demonstrate that even in the absence of Prdm14, some Mtgr1 binding remains at the motif-containing sites, suggesting partial redundancies in the recruitment mechanisms."

Given that: (i) the\u00a0<i>FH-Prdm14</i> cell lines in our study express Prdm14 at levels ~5\u20136-fold higher than wt ESCs, (ii) Prdm14 has an autonomous DNA-binding activity, and (iii) Prdm14 overexpression can augment Mtgr1 recruitment to the target genes (as shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>), we propose that expression changes observed in <i>FH-Prdm14</i> cell lines are associated with more robust repression of differentiation programs by Prdm14-Mtgr1 complex compared with wt cells and consequently, with the stabilization of the na\u00efve pluripotency program. Similar gain-of-function effects are not observed in <i>FH-Mtgr1</i> cells, likely because Mtgr1 lacks the autonomous ability to access its genomic targets and, at least in mESCs, Prdm14 is limiting for its chromatin association. Altogether, our data uncover the function of Mtgr1 in safeguarding mESC pluripotency and demonstrate that loss of Mtgr1 phenocopies gene expression defects associated with Prdm14 deletion."

To address whether Mtgr1 also plays a role in PGC formation, we used a previously established in vitro model in which na\u00efve mESCs are first differentiated to a primed, post-implantation epiblast-like state (mEpiLCs) from which\u00a0mouse primordial germ cell-like cells (mPGC-LCs) are then induced via addition of various cytokines (<a href=\"#bib28\">Hayashi and Saitou, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Hayashi et al., 2011</a>). The mPGC-LCs formation is monitored with the fluorescent reporter, <i>Stella</i>:GFP and quantified by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). In vitro derived mPGC-LCs have been shown to be competent to differentiate to sperm/oocytes upon transplantation and produce viable, fertile offspring and this simple in vitro differentiation system is therefore considered a useful tool to study mechanisms underlying PGC specification (<a href=\"#bib27\">Hayashi et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Nakaki et al., 2013</a>).

In contrast, both <i>Prdm14</i><sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> and <i>Mtgr1</i><sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup>\u00a0mESCs showed significantly decreased efficiency of mPGC-LCs formation (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F and G</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s5\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 5</a>).

Monobodies are small binding proteins (~10\u2009kDa) generated from combinatorial phage-display libraries built on the antibody-like scaffold of the tenth human fibronectin type III domain (FN3; <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib32\">Koide et al., 1998</a>, <a href=\"#bib33\">2012b</a>). Monobodies can recognize their targets with high affinity and specificity and have a strong tendency to recognize functional binding sites in their target molecules including clefts and planar surfaces, and thus they often are potent inhibitors (<a href=\"#bib34\">Koide et al., 2012a</a>; <a href=\"#bib61\">Sha et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib68\">Wojcik et al., 2010</a>). Furthermore, unlike antibodies whose folding depends on disulfide bond formation, monobodies are cysteine-free and thus functional when expressed under reducing environments such as the nucleus and cytoplasm.

Following phage display selection, we performed gene shuffling for affinity maturation and further selection in the yeast display format to isolate clones with high affinity. We identified a total of 12 clones that bound to human PRDM14 (hPRDM14) with <i>K</i><sub>D</sub> &lt;100 nM as measured by yeast surface display (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>; <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Among them, we identified two clones, Mb(hPRDM14_S4) and Mb(hPRDM14_S14), that bound hPRDM14 (residues 238\u2013487) at least five-fold stronger than the closest homologues, hPRDM6 (residues 194\u2013405) and hPRDM12 (residues 60\u2013229) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). We will use shorthand names, Mb(S4) and Mb(S14), for referring to them hereafter for brevity. Additionally, these two monobodies showed\u00a0comparable binding to the mouse homologue of hPRDM14, Prdm14. Of note, hPRDM14 was able to substitute for the mouse Prdm14 in rescue of the Prdm14<sup>-/-</sup> ESC defects, suggesting both biochemical and biological conservation of function between mouse and humans (<a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

We then examined whether these monobodies inhibited the interaction of Prdm14 with Mtgr1. Mb(S14) potently competed against the binding of Mtgr1 to Prdm14 but Mb(S4) did not (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). This result suggests that the two monobodies bind to distinct surfaces of Prdm14 and the epitope for Mb(S14) overlaps with and therefore occludes the Mtgr1-binding surface (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>)."

Mb(S4) captured Prdm14 and co-immunoprecipitated vast majority of Mtgr1 from the <i>FH-Prdm14</i> cell extracts (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). On the other hand, Mb(S14) captured lower levels of Prdm14 , in agreement with its competition for the same binding surface as Mtgr1 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4E</a>). Since PRC2 complex has been previously reported to associate with Prdm14 (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chan et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Payer et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Yamaji et al., 2013</a>), we also looked for the presence of Suz12, a PRC2 component. We did not detect immunoprecipitated Suz12 in the elution fraction for either of the two monobodies. Next, we used monobodies to precipitate endogenous Prdm14 from wt ESCs. Immunoblot analysis with \u03b1-Mtgr1 antibody showed that Mb(S4) monobody, which does not disrupt Prdm14-Mtgr1 interaction, recovered endogenous Mtgr1 (and was able to deplete most of it from the extract, <a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3A and B</a>). In addition, we performed Prdm14 Mb(S4)-precipitation/mass spec analysis from wt ESCs, which readily detected Prdm14- and Mtgr1-originating peptides, but did not recover any other PRDM proteins confirming a high specificity of this monobody (<a href=\"#fig4s3\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3B and C</a>). Common to monobodies generated to recognize native, folded proteins, neither Mb(S4) nor Mb(S14) detected denatured Prdm14 in immunoblotting (not shown).

However, aggregation of both proteins resulted in low yields of the complex suitable for crystallization. To overcome this problem, we designed a fusion construct of Prdm14 and Mtgr1 in which the two proteins were linked with a ten-residue linker (GSSGSSGS), a common strategy for stabilizing heterodimers (<a href=\"#bib18\">Ernst et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Kobe et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Reddy Chichili et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Zhou et al., 2015</a>). To confirm that the linker did not distort the Prdm14\u2013Mtgr1 complex, we performed a series of experiments. The fusion protein had the same retention time on size-exclusion chromatography as the unlinked complex (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), indicating that the linker did not alter the stoichiometry of the complex. We then compared the fusion and the\u00a0unlinked complex using solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Most of the cross peaks in the heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectrum of <sup>15</sup>N-Prdm14 in complex with unlabeled Mtgr1 (where we observe signals only from <sup>15</sup>N-Prdm14) overlapped with those in the HSQC spectrum of <sup>15</sup>N-labeled Prdm14-linker-Mtgr1 (where we observe signals from the entire fusion protein including both Prdm14 and Mtgr1) (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). The large number of overlapping peaks in the two spectra strongly suggests that the Prdm14 protein takes on nearly identical average conformation in the unlinked complex and the fusion protein (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Furthermore, the fusion protein and the unlinked complex had the same affinity to Mb(S4), indicating that the linker did not distort the Prdm14 epitope for the monobody (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). This fusion construct allowed us to overcome the aggregation problem, but it still yielded no crystals in crystallization trials using over 500 conditions."

The addition of Mb(S4) readily led to crystallization of Prdm14-linker-Mtgr1, and we determined its structure to a resolution of 3.06\u2009\u00c5 through single wavelength anomalous diffraction (SAD) phasing using selenomethionine-labeled crystals (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>; <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>; <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). The crystallized complex had two Prdm14-linker-Mtgr1/Mb(S4) complexes in the asymmetric unit.

The crystallization construct includes residues 184\u2013239 that precede the SET domain (pre-SET) and residues 357\u2013373 following the SET domain (post-SET). Unlike many SET domain-containing proteins, Prdm14 does not have cysteine-rich Zn finger domains adjacent to the SET domain, commonly termed pre-SET and post-SET domains. Thus, in the absence of well-defined domains, we refer to these adjacent segments as pre-SET and post-SET regions. The crystal structure of the mouse Prdm14 SET domain is very similar to that of the hPRDM12 SET domain, the closest human homologue of Prdm14 (PDB ID 3EP0; C\u03b1 RMSD=0.99; <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). The Prdm14 SET domain in our structure has a total of nine \u03b2-strands (\u03b21-\u03b29) arranged in three antiparallel \u03b2-sheets with a short 3<sub>10</sub> helix (\u03b71) inserted between \u03b26 and \u03b27. The pre-SET region in our construct has a short helix at the N-terminus followed by a long structurally disordered region a part of which (residues 217\u2013239) has no detectable electron density even at 0.5 \u03c3 contour levels (2Fo-Fc). The residues that constitute the post-SET region at the C-terminus to the SET domain are arranged in an antiparallel beta sheet (\u03b210 and \u03b211). Overall, the structural features of the PR/SET domain in Prdm14 show no major differences with other PR/SET domains in Prdm proteins."

Mutating Mtgr1 Arg105 to Asp resulted in a loss of detectable binding (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>), and replacing Prdm14 Tyr339 of the pocket with Arg substantially reduced binding (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). In addition, Lys109 in Mtgr1 \u03b1A interacts with Glu294, Tyr355 and Pro366 of Prdm14 SET domain. Lys109 in Mtgr1 forms a salt bridge with Glu294 from \u03b25 of the Prdm14 SET domain (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). Mutating either of these residues led to a loss of detectable binding (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>). Remarkably, charge reversal of this ionic interaction, that is, the combination of Mtgr1 K109E and Prdm14 E294K restored binding, in agreement with the salt bridge formation across the binding interface in solution (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a> middle). These mutation experiments together supports the authenticity of the binding interface observed in the crystal structure and identified critical electrostatic interactions."

To this end, we first confirmed that the point mutations designed based on the crystal structure (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D and E</a>) also disrupted the interaction between the full-length proteins in cells, and that the combined charge reversal mutations restored the interaction (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). Then, we reconstituted <i>Stella</i>:GFP Prdm14<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> mESCs with cDNAs encoding either wt or mutant (E294K or Y339R) FH-Prdm14 and confirmed that all three proteins were expressed at similar levels (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>). Next, we used RNA-seq to compare gene expression patterns of these mESCs after transition from 2i+LIF to serum+LIF culture (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). In the Prdm14<sup>\u2212/\u2212</sup> cells reconstituted with mutant Prdm14, we noted elevated expression of genes associated with differentiation to epiblast and extraembryonic endoderm, and diminished expression of na\u00efve pluripotency genes (with an exception of <i>Tet2</i>), similar to attenuated expression patterns (albeit not to the same degree) as we observed upon loss of Prdm14 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>, compare to <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>).

Given that one of the monobodies we developed, Mb(S14), binds to Prdm14 competitively with Mtgr1, we hypothesized that this reagent can be utilized to inhibit Prdm14 function in living cells or organisms in a highly controlled manner. To provide a proof-of-principle for such strategy, we engineered piggyBac doxycycline-inducible constructs encoding mCherry-Mb(S14) fusion or, as a control, mCherry alone, and introduced them into <i>Stella</i>:GFP reporter mESCs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6E</a>). Next, we induced mPGC-LC formation from mESCs in the absence or presence of doxycycline (added during the induction of mPGC-LCs from mEpiLCs) to activate monobody expression. We observed consistent reduction in PGC-LC formation efficiency in cells expressing the mCherry-Mb(S14) fusion protein, as compared with the same cell population without addition of doxycycline or to cells expressing mCherry alone (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6F</a>, <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). A more moderate effect of the monobody (compared with the Prdm14 E294K mutation, <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>) is probably due to the fact that this monobody needs to compete against the high-affinity interaction between Prdm14 and Mtgr1. In addition, we noticed a short half-life of the mCherry-Mb(S14) fusion protein (data not shown), which may contribute to the moderate effect but could also facilitate inhibition with high temporal resolution in the future. Thus, Mb(S14) represents a novel tool that can be utilized to perturb Prdm14 function in living cells during a dynamic biological process such as the PGC induction and can be further modified in the future for addressing particular questions using standard protein-engineering technologies."

Therefore, although no evidence has been previously found for the catalytic activity of the Prdm14 SET domain, our data demonstrate that this domain is nonetheless essential for Prdm14 function by mediating the interaction with its key partner, Mtgr1. Prdm14 and Mtgr1 co-occupy distal regulatory regions of many target genes linked to differentiation, DNA methylation and chromatin modification, consistent with their tight interaction. Loss of either protein results in upregulation of a subset of these target genes and a gradual loss of mESC self-renewal. However, similar to what has been observed previously for Prdm14, Mtgr1 is not required for maintenance of mESC under 2i+LIF. This can be explained by the fact that the Fgf/Erk pathway, a major signaling cascade driving both epiblast and extraembryonic endoderm differentiation (to which loss of Prdm14/Mtgr1 sensitizes cells), is inhibited under these conditions (<a href=\"#bib46\">Nichols and Smith, 2009</a>)."

Notably, we detected HDACs 1\u20133 in our Prdm14 immunoprecipitates, and HDAC3 and other NCoR1 repressive complex components in our purifications with the Mb(S4) monobody, suggesting that the Prdm14\u2013Mtgr1-dependent repression may indeed be facilitated by histone deacetylation and that Mtgr1 is required for recruiting HDACs to Prdm14-binding loci. Furthermore, although a subset of genomic sites occupied by Mtgr1 occurs at Prdm14 motif-lacking sites, the high similarity of transcriptional changes observed upon loss of either protein suggests that the major impact of Mtgr1 on gene expression and cell identity of mESCs is in the context of its association with Prdm14. Moreover, our data suggest that Prdm14 can not only guide, but through change in its levels, quantitatively tune the degree of interaction of ubiquitously expressed Mtgr1 with chromatin."

Three lines of evidence support this notion: (i) Mtgr1 deletion; (ii) single point mutations in Prdm14 disrupting association with Mtgr1; and (iii) expression of a monobody targeting the Prdm14\u2013Mtgr1 interaction surface, all of which hinder PGC-LC induction in vitro. It is therefore surprising that\u00a0a <i>Mtgr1</i> mouse knockout strain has been reported as viable and fertile (<a href=\"#bib2\">Amann et al., 2005</a>). However, it remains unclear whether this strain represents a true loss-of-function, because in the mouse targeting strategy, the first six exons are preserved (encoding amino acids 1\u2013316, which span the Prdm14 interaction region and NHR2 domain involved in dimerization and association with mSin3/HDAC complex) (<a href=\"#bib57\">Rossetti et al., 2004</a>). In light of our findings and aforementioned caveats, we suggest that the in vivo function of Mtgr1 in the germline should be revisited. It is also possible, however, that requirement for Mtgr1 in germ cell development in vivo can be fully or partially compensated by the other ETO proteins. Because residues that form the Prdm14 binding interface in Mtgr1 are conserved among the ETO family members, we expect that the other ETO proteins would bind directly to the Prdm14 pre-SET/SET regions and could therefore compensate for the absence of Mtgr1 function."

While many structures of the catalytic SET domains have been obtained with their substrates (typically, histone tails), to the best of our knowledge, our study represents the first structural analysis of the SET domain acting as a module for a high affinity protein\u2013protein interaction. Interestingly, a comparison of our structure with that of the Prdm9\u2013AdoHcy\u2013histone peptide complex indicates that the surface of the Prdm14 pre-SET and SET regions engaged in interaction with Mtgr1 overlaps with surfaces other Prdm proteins use for binding to their histone peptide substrate (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>; [<a href=\"#bib69\">Wu et al., 2013</a>]). Indeed, Mtgr1 Lys109 is in close proximity to Tyr355 that corresponds to the catalytic Tyr based on the consensus SET domain sequence (<a href=\"#bib63\">Smith and Denu, 2009</a>). In Prdm9, the catalytic tyrosine Tyr356 along with Tyr276 and Tyr341 form the Lys4me2 binding pocket and are critical for catalytic activity (<a href=\"#bib69\">Wu et al., 2013</a>). In Prdm14, the side chain of Tyr355 flips over (with respect to the conformation of Tyr357 in Prdm9) and interacts with K109 of Mtgr1. The location of K109 is distinct from that of Lys4me2 in Prdm9 (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3C</a>). In addition, the high affinity of the Prdm14\u2013Mtgr1 interaction strongly suggests that Mtgr1 would be a poor substrate, given that a substrate needs to be released after catalysis for efficient enzyme reaction. We also note that His211 and Ala212 in the pre-SET region of Prdm14 occupy the S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM)-binding site (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>) and thus, at least in the context of the presented structure, preclude the binding of this cofactor necessary for methylation. Taken together, our results suggest that Mtgr1 Lys109 is unlikely to be an actual substrate for Prdm14-mediated methylation. Consistent with this notion, radioactive in vitro methyltransferase assays with recombinant Prdm14 and Mtgr1 proteins, their respective interaction mutants, as well as histone substrates, all failed to yield methyltransferase activity (not shown). However, we cannot exclude the possibility that under presently unknown conditions, such activity can ultimately be found. Regardless, our comparisons suggest that substrate-binding surfaces can, in some SET domain proteins, be co-opted for mediating high affinity protein\u2013protein interactions, which may provide a molecular explanation as to why such surfaces are typically highly conserved even in SET domain proteins with no apparent catalytic activity."

We speculate that the oncogenic function of Prdm14 may be mediated by the formation of a complex with Mtgr1, which is broadly expressed and thus readily available for association in many different organ systems, or perhaps with other ETO proteins using the same interface. If this proves to be the case, inhibition of the Mtgr1-interaction surface on Prdm14 could be an attractive target for therapy as Prdm14 expression is restricted under non-pathological conditions to the preimplantation embryo and PGCs, reducing the risk of off-target effects on normal somatic tissues. Thus, the monobodies directed to Prdm14 generated in this study will be powerful tools for testing the 'druggability' of the Prdm14\u2013Mtgr1 interaction. Indeed, we have introduced monobodies into CML cells and demonstrated the potential druggability of a domain interface in Bcr-Abl (<a href=\"#bib24\">Grebien et al., 2011</a>). In addition, the crystal structure shows that Mb(S4) binds to a distinct surface of Prdm14. Because monobodies usually bind to functional sites on target proteins, we hypothesize that the Mb(S4) epitope may also be important for Prdm14 function, which will be a subject of future research. We emphasize that the genetically encoded monobodies are portable tools, as they can be readily introduced into different cells via transfection or viral transduction. This attribute should facilitate the investigation of Prdm14 functions in diverse contexts."

Chromatin was sonicated to an average size of 0.5\u20132 kb, using Bioruptor (Diagenode). A total of 5 \u03bcg of antibody was added to the sonicated chromatin and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. Subsequently, 50 \u03bcl of protein G Dynal magnetic beads were added to the ChIP reactions and incubated for ~4 hr at 4\u00b0C. Magnetic beads were washed and chromatin eluted, followed by reversal of crosslinks and DNA purification. ChIP DNA was dissolved in water. ChIP-seq and input libraries were prepared according to Illumina protocol and sequenced using Illumina Genome Analyzer. Following library preparation, samples were pooled and sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq instrument using 76 base-pair single-end reads on a NextSeq high output kit (Illumina)."

Forty-eight hours post-transfection, we did single-cell sorting into 96-well plates on mCherry-positive cells, assuming that these cells got transfected with both mCherry and pX330 plasmids.

The protein complex was then concentrated to a final concentration of 15 mg/ml. Initial crystallization screening of ~ 500 conditions was carried out in 96-well plates using the hanging-drop vapor-diffusion method with a crystallization robot (Mosquito, TTP\u00a0Labtech). Crystals used for data collection were obtained in 17% PEG3350 and 8% Tascimate pH 5.5, and were cryoprotected in 1:1 mix of Paratone and Paraffin oil and flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen prior to data collection. The Prdm14-linker\u2013Mtgr1 protein was labeled with SeMet as described (<a href=\"#bib16\">Doubli\u00e9, 1997</a>), purified as a complex with the monobody and crystallized in a similar manner as the native proteins."

The data were indexed and integrated using HKL3000 (<a href=\"#bib43\">Minor et al., 2006</a>). Molecular replacement using PHASER (<a href=\"#bib42\">McCoy et al., 2007</a>) and MOLREP (<a href=\"#bib66\">Vagin and Teplyakov, 1997</a>) with an hPrdm12 structure (PDB ID 3EP0) and the monobody backbone (PDB 3UYO) did not have sufficient scattering power to <i>generate</i> a solution with a signal-to-noise ratio that is high <i>enough</i> to be identified. Thus, we determined the structure through single-wavelength Se anomalous dispersion experiment. A total of eight Se sites were identified and refined using Autosol (<a href=\"#bib65\">Terwilliger et al., 2009</a>), resulting in an overall figure of merit of 0.45 and Z-score of 43.1. These phases were then used against the SAD data for model building in phenix.autobuild (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adams et al., 2010</a>). Iterative model building and refinement were done using the programs COOT (<a href=\"#bib17\">Emsley and Cowtan, 2004</a>) and PHENIX (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adams et al., 2010</a>).The structure refined from SAD data was later refined against the higher resolution native data at a 3.05\u2009\u00c5 resolution. The final structures were analyzed using Procheck and Molprobity (<a href=\"#bib11\">Davis et al., 2004</a>). Figures were made using Pymol (DeLano, 2002). The structure has 100% residues in the allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot with no outliers. The Molprobity score (2.16) is above average for structures refined at comparable resolutions."

Prdm14 has a critical role in pluripotency in ES cells and in the specification of primordial germ cells (PGCs). They have identified an ETO-family protein Mtgr1 as a co-repressor that binds tightly to the preSET/SET domain as shown by crystal structure of Prdm14-Mtgr1 complex. The authors mapped the domains of both proteins involved in direct interaction, demonstrated (via Chip-seq) that these two proteins tend to recognize the same genomic targets, probably through the DNA binding domain of Prdm14, and indicate that Mtgr1 is required for Prdm14 function in ESCs and PGC formation. Mtgr1 is known for its role in leukemias but had not been previously implied in the regulation of pluripotency and germ line formation. In fact, Mtgr1 null mice appear viable and fertile, suggesting some redundancy in vivo."

While this is a reasonable assumption, it does not discount additional or different targets (repressed and activated) in PGCs. it remains unclear whether Mtgr1 deletion does specifically affect germline differentiation or would lead to a general block in differentiation. Thus, the question remains whether the critical function of Mtgr1 is limited to the germline. The analysis of the self-renewing ESC state in the absence of Mtgr1 is rather limited (only RNA-seq and morphology). Expansion of these analyses to clarify whether Mtgr1 blocks cell differentiation more generally would be welcomed."

Can the same crystal be obtained after adding Mb(S4)? I note that, based on the structure information provided (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>), the construct could also be made in the order of Mtgr1-linker-Prdm14.

We further noted that the first class sites showed robust Prdm14 binding and gain of Mtgr1 ChIP-seq signal in the Prdm14 overexpressing cell line. In contrast, the second class showed low/no Prdm14 binding and diminished occupancy of Mtgr1 upon Prdm14 overexpression. However, we agree with the reviewers that our results did not show directly that Prdm14 is not required for Mtgr1 binding at the second class of sites, and in retrospect, we should have referred to these sites as 'Prdm14 motif-lacking' sites rather than 'Prdm14-independent'.

The results can be summarized as follows: (i) in wt ESCs, the average Mtgr1 enrichment is similar at Prdm14 motif-containing vs. lacking sites (compare black profiles in left and right panels; note that the scale on the Y axis is the same), (ii) at Prdm14 motif-containing sites, Mtgr1 binding is increased in FH- Prdm14 OE cells and diminished (but not entirely abrogated) in Prdm14<sup>-/-</sup> cells, left panel, (iii) at Prdm14 motif-lacking sites, Mtgr1 binding is diminished by FH-Prdm14 overexpression, but it is also moderately affected in Prdm14<sup>-/-</sup> cells (right panel). Altogether, these results are consistent with the Mtgr1 binding to chromatin being sensitive to the Prdm14 dosage (either loss or gain) at the Prdm14-motif containing sites, which are the main focus of our study. However, these results also demonstrate that even in the absence of Prdm14, some Mtgr1 binding remains at the motif-containing sites, suggesting partial redundancies in the recruitment mechanisms. Finally, although quite likely a modest negative effect of Prdm14 deletion on Mtgr1 binding at motive-lacking sites can be attributed to indirect effects (given that these sites show low/no Prdm14 occupancy), we nonetheless concur that it is best to refrain from calling these sites Prdm14-independent."

If a class of sites bound strongly by Prdm14, but not Mtgr1 existed, than it would show up as a population of sites that have high signal at the X axis and low signal at the Y axis.

As a side note with respect to the previous comment: given that this analysis was out of necessity (as we do not have a ChIP-compatible Prdm14 antibody) done in FH-Prdm14 OE cells, in which Mtgr1 binding at Prdm14 motif-lacking sites is highly diminished, the population of sites that have low value on the X axis and high value on the Y axis (e.g. bound by Mtgr1 and not Prdm14) is also relatively small.

Regarding the second part of the comment: a question whether hPRDM14 can complement defects observed upon loss of the mouse protein has, to our knowledge, never been addressed. Therefore, to answer reviewer's point, we cloned hPRDM14 cDNA, and introduced it to mouse Prdm14<sub>-/-</sub> ESCs using a piggyBac system. We subsequently compared tagged Prdm14 levels (by immunoblotting), cell morphology and expression of select Prdm14-bound genes (by RT- qPCR) in Prdm14<sub>-/-</sub> ESCs reconstituted with either mouse or human Prdm14 (shown in <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). These analyses revealed that at least with respect to ESC functions, the hPRDM14 could substitute for the mouse protein (see subsection \u201cGeneration of renewable monobody reagents to study and inhibit Prdm14-Mtgr1 complex\u201d)."
