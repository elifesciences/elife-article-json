However, the neurobiological mechanisms supporting this type of internally-guided learning (without explicit feedback) are still unclear. Here, participants who completed a task in which no external reward/feedback was provided, exhibited enhanced fMRI-signals within the dopaminergic midbrain, hippocampus, and ventral striatum (the SN/VTA-Hippocampal loop) when successfully grasping the meaning of new-words. Importantly, new-words that were better remembered showed increased activation and enhanced functional connectivity between the midbrain, hippocampus, and ventral striatum. Moreover, enhanced emotion-related physiological measures and subjective pleasantness ratings during encoding were associated with remembered new-words after 24\u2009hr. Furthermore, increased subjective pleasantness ratings were also related to new-words remembered after seven days. These results suggest that intrinsic\u2014potentially reward-related\u2014signals, triggered by self-monitoring of correct performance, can promote the storage of new information into long-term memory through the activation of the SN/VTA-Hippocampal loop, possibly via dopaminergic modulation of the midbrain."

However, the neurobiological mechanisms supporting this type of internally-guided learning (without explicit feedback) are still unclear. Here, participants who completed a task in which no external reward/feedback was provided, exhibited enhanced fMRI-signals within the dopaminergic midbrain, hippocampus, and ventral striatum (the SN/VTA-Hippocampal loop) when successfully grasping the meaning of new-words. Importantly, new-words that were better remembered showed increased activation and enhanced functional connectivity between the midbrain, hippocampus, and ventral striatum. Moreover, enhanced emotion-related physiological measures and subjective pleasantness ratings during encoding were associated with remembered new-words after 24\u2009hr. Furthermore, increased subjective pleasantness ratings were also related to new-words remembered after seven days. These results suggest that intrinsic\u2014potentially reward-related\u2014signals, triggered by self-monitoring of correct performance, can promote the storage of new information into long-term memory through the activation of the SN/VTA-Hippocampal loop, possibly via dopaminergic modulation of the midbrain."

As such, the volunteers were reasonably aware when they\u2019d learned the meaning of a new word without any external feedback.

This could be crucial to improving the design of educational programs \u2013 for example, in teaching literacy and foreign languages \u2013 and for improving the recovery of verbal skills lost after stroke."

According to this model, the activation of this reward-memory loop starts when new information that needs to be stored in memory \u2018arrives\u2019 at the HP. A signal is then sent to the SN/VTA through the VS, which is thought to integrate affective, motivational, and goal-directed information into the loop (<a href=\"#bib62\">Lisman and Grace, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib44\">Goto and Grace, 2005</a>). SN/VTA neurons are then disinhibited, facilitating dopaminergic signalling into the HP (<a href=\"#bib63\">Lodge and Grace, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib98\">Shohamy and Adcock, 2010</a>), which in turn enhances memory formation. In accord with this model, recent evidence suggests that both the anticipation of an explicit reward (e.g., the possibility to win money; <a href=\"#bib1\">Adcock et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib108\">Wittmann et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib109\">Wolosin et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Callan et al., 2008</a>) and also intrinsic motivational states (e.g., curiosity about future events; <a href=\"#bib46\">Gruber et al., 2014</a>) can modulate memory formation through the activation of the SN/VTA-HP loop."

If neither extrinsic feedback regarding the learning success nor external reward is given, some internal system must still decide whether the output of the learning experience (i.e., new information) is valid and should thus be stored into long-term memory. One could predict that successful internally-guided learning (i.e., learning without explicit feedback) might trigger intrinsic reward-related processes after positive monitoring (related to a feeling of <i>efficacy</i>; <a href=\"#bib103\">White, 1959</a>), favouring the encoding of the learning episodes into the memory system. Concordantly, psychological theories on self-regulated learning have proposed that internal monitoring and trial-by-trial evaluation of learning success may be crucial determinants of learning in complex environments (<a href=\"#bib13\">Bjork et al., 2013</a>). Considering the importance of the SN/VTA-HP loop in the regulation of extrinsically motivated learning (<a href=\"#bib1\">Adcock et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib108\">Wittmann et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Callan et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib109\">Wolosin et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Gruber et al., 2014</a>), we hypothesized that the recruitment of this reward-memory loop should be instrumental in storing successful learning experiences also in the absence of explicit feedback, especially after positive intrinsic evaluation of the learning outcome."

Indeed, there is an extensive body of evidence showing that children (as young as eight years-old) can learn new words from written contexts (e.g., by reading) on their own, not only when explicitly instructed to do so, but also during incidental learning conditions (<a href=\"#bib53\">Jenkins et al., 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Konopak et al., 1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Kuhn and Stahl, 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib80\">Nagy et al., 1985</a>, <a href=\"#bib81\">1987</a>; <a href=\"#bib102\">Werner and Kaplan, 1950</a>). Moreover, as adult learners, we also constantly face the problem of learning the meaning of new-words in our own native or non-native languages, and in most cases, the repeated presentation of a new-word in different verbal contexts can allow to discover the meaning of the new-word (<a href=\"#bib82\">Nation, 2001</a>). Therefore, our word-learning task is ideally suited to test internally-guided learning as: (i) in our task participants are able to learn the meaning of artificially created new-words by using contextual information, without the need for explicit feedback or reward; and (ii) our paradigm mimics a learning process that occurs in real-world environments. Importantly, we recently showed that, in our paradigm, successful meaning extraction enhanced fMRI-signals within the VS. Moreover, this activity was not related to novelty, attention or exertion of effort (<a href=\"#bib89\">Ripoll\u00e9s et al., 2014</a>). While our previous results suggested that learning the meaning of a new word triggered reward-related signals within the VS, we never assessed the effect that these internally elicited signals had on the formation of longer-lasting memory traces. Thus, an important question arises: can positive monitoring of learning success\u2014in the\u00a0absence of explicit feedback or external reward\u2014mediate the entrance of new information into long-term memory via the modulation of the SN/VTA-HP loop? In order to address this question, we first re-analyzed the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from our previous work (Exp. 1) using a region-of-interest (ROI) analysis that focused on all the areas of the SN/VTA-HP loop (constrained to be reward-related by means of a meta-analysis on reward; NeuroSynth, <a href=\"#bib110\">Yarkoni et al., 2011</a>). In addition, we used a post-scan retrieval test to assess the possible memory benefits induced by the activation of the SN/VTA-HP loop during successful encoding. We hypothesized that increased brain activity and functional connectivity within the areas of the loop, in the\u00a0absence of any external reward, should be associated with enhanced memory formation (i.e., greater activity and connectivity during encoding for later remembered vs. later forgotten items)."

Based on our previous findings suggesting a strong relation between language learning and reward processing (<a href=\"#bib89\">Ripoll\u00e9s et al., 2014</a>) and also on studies showing that uncovering the solution to a problem is closely tied to an increase in subjective pleasantness (<a href=\"#bib54\">Kizilirmak et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Bechara and Damasio, 2005</a>), we recorded subjective self-reported ratings of arousal and pleasantness during the encoding phase of our task, along with objective physiological measures (electrodermal activity). Indeed, evidence suggests that emotion-related signals\u2014assisting cognitive processes such as learning and decision making\u2014can be captured by electrodermal activity (EDA; <a href=\"#bib9\">Bechara and Damasio, 2005</a>). In particular, skin conductance responses (SCRs) have been linked to enhanced memory formation, motivational behavior (<a href=\"#bib23\">Cahill et al., 1998</a>), explicit reward-related processes (<a href=\"#bib64\">Lole et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Mas-Herrero et al., 2014</a>), and also to a modulation of the orbitofrontal cortex, the amygdala, and the striatum (<a href=\"#bib28\">Critchley et al., 2000</a>). Finally, a third experiment (<b>Exp. 3</b>)\u00a0was carried out to replicate the behavioural effects of Exp. 2 over longer retention intervals (one week). We hypothesized that if internal monitoring of learning success would indeed trigger reward-related processes that ultimately enhance memory formation, new-words remembered after longer retention periods should be associated with increased pleasantness ratings and enhanced SCRs during the initial encoding phase."

Only half of the pairs of sentences disambiguated multiple meanings, allowing the encoding of a congruent meaning of the new-word during its second presentation (M+ condition; see Material and methods).

The design of our paradigm allows us to address these alternative explanations by including the incongruent condition (M-, no learning) and the order of presentation (first or second sentence) in our analyses (note that participants were equally prompted to complete the task for both M+ and M- conditions). Regarding the possible effort-related interpretation of the SN/VTA activation (<a href=\"#bib15\">Boehler et al., 2011</a>), previous studies using a similar paradigm have shown that incongruent conditions (M-) can be more difficult and effortful to resolve than congruent ones (M+; e.g. <a href=\"#bib72\">Mestres-Miss\u00e9 et al., 2014</a>). Finally, the inclusion of the M- condition and the order of presentation also account for possible novelty and accuracy or subjective meaning confounds, as: (i) new-words are equally novel to participants for M+ and M- conditions; (ii) novelty effects should be more apparent during the first than during the second presentation of a particular new-word; (iii) generalized effects of accuracy or subjective meaning attribution should be apparent during correct rejection or false alarms of M- trials."

We then tested whether the effects revealed during encoding in the HP, VS, and SN/VTA really reflected signal changes due to successful meaning extraction or rather to unspecific effects of accuracy, second word presentation, or experimental condition. Corroborating our hypothesis, we found a significant interaction of Order \u00d7 Condition \u00d7 Response [<i>F</i>(1,35)\u00a0=\u00a04.254, p&lt;0.047, partial \u03b72\u00a0=\u00a00.108].

Importantly, there was no main effect of condition (p&gt;0.19), further emphasizing that the reported effects were driven by the M+ correct trials. Concordantly, paired t-test comparisons for all correct versus incorrect conditions showed significant differences in all ROIs only for M+ correct versus incorrect trials (see <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>) during the\u00a0second sentence presentation [left VS, <i>t</i>(35)\u00a0=\u00a06.29, p&lt;0.001, d\u00a0=\u00a01.31; left HP, <i>t</i>(35)\u00a0=\u00a03.59, p&lt;0.002, d\u00a0=\u00a00.59; left SN/VTA, <i>t</i>(35)\u00a0=\u00a04.50, p&lt;0.001, d\u00a0=\u00a00.79; right VS, <i>t</i>(35)\u00a0=\u00a04.73, p&lt;0.001, d\u00a0=\u00a00.89; right HP, <i>t</i>(35)\u00a0=\u00a03.28, p&lt;0.003, d\u00a0=\u00a00.56; right SN/VTA, <i>t</i>(35)\u00a0=\u00a04.25, p&lt;0.001, d\u00a0=\u00a00.76; two-tailed, at p&lt;0.05 FDR-corrected].

Nevertheless, one could have expected that this loop should also have been activated during incorrect meaning attribution (false alarms in the M- condition), as participants reported meaning acquisition. However, the results of Exp. 3 (in which subjects also provided confidence ratings, see Figure 7, Material and methods and Appendix 1), revealed that confidence ratings were significantly lower for false alarms in the M- incorrect condition than for correct responses in the M+ (see below for a similar pattern of results for pleasantness ratings and electrodermal activity). Together, these results strongly suggest that the observed effects were not driven by novelty, attention, task-difficulty, exertion of effort or accuracy, but rather by successful meaning extraction: the VS, HP, and SN/VTA were only engaged when participants correctly learned the meaning of the new-word."

Beta coefficients were again submitted to a 2\u00a0\u00d7 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 repeated measures ANOVA with the factors Hemisphere (Left, Right), Order (first sentence, second sentence), ROI (VS, HP, SN/VTA), and Memory (Remembered, Forgotten). We found a significant interaction of Order \u00d7 Memory [<i>F</i>(1,32)\u00a0=\u00a06.398, p&lt;0.017, partial \u03b72\u00a0=\u00a00.167] which was not affected by region or hemisphere (all ps&gt;0.812). This interaction reflects greater activation in remembered versus forgotten trials only during the\u00a0second sentence presentation. Concordantly, subsequent paired t-test comparisons showed significant differences (see <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>) in remembered versus forgotten trials in the left and right VS, HP, and SN/VTA during the\u00a0second sentence presentation [left VS, <i>t</i>(32)\u00a0=\u00a02.78, p&lt;0.009, d\u00a0=\u00a00.61; right VS, <i>t</i>(32)\u00a0=\u00a02.40, p&lt;0.022, d\u00a0=\u00a00.47; left HP, <i>t</i>(32)\u00a0=\u00a02.60, p&lt;0.014, d\u00a0=\u00a00.55; right HP, <i>t</i>(32)\u00a0=\u00a02.58, p&lt;0.015, d\u00a0=\u00a00.56; left SN/VTA, <i>t</i>(32)\u00a0=\u00a02.79, p&lt;0.009, d\u00a0=\u00a00.62; right SN/VTA, <i>t</i>(32)\u00a0=\u00a03.05, p&lt;0.005, d\u00a0=\u00a00.65; two-tailed, FDR-corrected at p&lt;0.05; see also Appendix 2 for further supporting analyses in a subset of participants with balanced number of trials in remembered and forgotten conditions]. Importantly, the analysis of remembered vs. forgotten M- trials (eight subjects with fewer than 3 forgotten trials had to be excluded, see Materials and methods; average number of trials with standard deviation for each condition: 17.14 \u00b1 7.03 remembered trials and 7.32 \u00b1 3.24 forgotten trials) revealed no significant interaction of Order \u00d7 Memory [<i>F</i>(1,27)\u00a0=\u00a00.004, p&gt;0.948, partial \u03b72\u00a0=\u00a00.0001; not affected by region or hemisphere, all ps&gt;0.301] further underlining the specificity of our results to successful meaning extraction (M+ condition). In addition and, as expected, no significant interaction of Order \u00d7 Memory was found for the control ROI located at the primary visual cortex for M+ or M- trials [<i>F</i>(1,32)\u00a0=\u00a00.53, p&gt;0.46, partial \u03b72\u00a0=\u00a00.017 and <i>F</i>(1,27)\u00a0=\u00a00.023, p&gt;0.88, partial \u03b72\u00a0=\u00a00.001, respectively] which further supports the specificity of our results to reward and memory related regions."

Finally, subject-specific word-learning was positively correlated with the change in functional connectivity (see <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>) between the left SN/VTA (source) and the left HP [64 voxels, maximum at x\u00a0=\u00a0\u221230, y\u00a0=\u00a0\u221210, z\u00a0=\u00a0\u221220, <i>t</i>(34)\u00a0=\u00a03.56, p&lt;0.037, d\u00a0=\u00a01.19] and also with the left VS [10 voxels, maximum at x\u00a0=\u00a0\u221224, y\u00a0=\u00a0\u22128, z\u00a0=\u00a0\u221210, <i>t</i>(34)\u00a0=\u00a03.33, p&lt;0.04, d\u00a0=\u00a01.11]. Moreover, there was an overlap at the left VS between the analysis in which the seed was the left HP and that in which the left SN/VTA was used as a\u00a0source. The same happened at the HP when using the left SN/VTA or the left VS as seeds (see <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). In contrast, analyses using seeds in the <b>right</b> SN/VTA, HP, or VS revealed no significant correlations with individual word-learning in any area of interest. In addition, no significant correlations were found at the control ROI located at the primary visual cortex for any of the seeds. Finally, we computed several additional PPI analyses in order to better characterize the nature of the reported effects. First, we repeated the main PPI calculations but focusing on enhanced inter-regional coupling driven by main effects of condition (all M+ versus all M- trials during the\u00a0second sentence presentation). As expected, no significant correlations with the number of remembered words were found. In the same manner, no effects were found if the PPI analyses focused on M- remembered vs. M- incorrect trials, which further supports the specificity of the connectivity results to the M+ remembered condition. Together, the PPI results from left-sided seeds demonstrate that subject-specific longer lasting word-learning success was related to increased coupling among the VS, HP, and SN/VTA in addition to the intraregional changes in activity within each of these areas in isolation."

The fMRI-results demonstrate that successful meaning extraction for a new-word, in the\u00a0absence of any external feedback, enhanced fMRI signals within the entire SN/VTA-VS-HP loop, with the observed activity not being caused by novelty, attention, task-difficulty, or exertion of effort, but rather by reward-related effects (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). Moreover, in a second experiment, objective physiological measures (EDA) and subjective pleasantness ratings were only enhanced during successful meaning extraction (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>), which further demonstrates that learning was associated with increased reward processing. Regarding our main hypothesis\u2014the effect of intrinsic reward on memory\u2014new-words learned and later remembered elicited greater fMRI activity and functional connectivity within the VS, HP, and SN/VTA than those that were forgotten (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3</a> and <a href=\"#fig4\">4</a>). Finally, and most importantly, Exp. 2 also showed that remembered new-words after a 24-hr retention delay (and after seven days in Exp. 3) were closely tied to enhanced SCRs and increased ratings of pleasantness during encoding, suggesting that intrinsic reward\u2014driven by self-monitoring of correct performance\u2014did have an effect on memory formation (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figures 6</a> and <a href=\"#fig7\">7</a>). This study extends our previous results (<a href=\"#bib89\">Ripoll\u00e9s et al., 2014</a>) by showing that successful learning, in the\u00a0absence of external feedback or reward, engages a complex subcortical network\u2014that includes not only reward, but also memory and dopamine related regions\u2014which seems to modulate the entrance of new information into long-term memory. All in all, this is the first study, to the best of our knowledge, to provide a neural mechanism\u2014the SN/VTA-HP loop\u2014which might subserve reward-related memory enhancements when the <i>reward is intrinsic and triggered by an internal evaluation of correct performance.</i> Thus, learning, under certain circumstances, could be fuelling itself through intrinsic reward-related processes. Remarkably, this engagement was only observed for the meaningful condition and not during incorrect meaning attribution in the incongruent condition (M- incorrect). Likewise, neither subjective pleasantness ratings nor EDA measures were affected by M- incorrect trials, suggesting that the incorrect behavioural responses are somehow corrected by the internal monitoring system and thus did not trigger learning (see confidence ratings for Exp. 3 in Appendix 1 and <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>)."

(2015)</a> who showed that, behaviourally, successful generation of a solution to a problem in the\u00a0absence of explicit feedback was related to both positive affect and enhanced memory formation. Importantly, we extend those findings to meaningful learning of new-words and show that objective measures of emotional responses (EDA) are affected as well. In this vein, our results are in accord with accumulating evidence suggesting that emotions can influence decision making and learning (<a href=\"#bib37\">Dunsmoor et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Adcock et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Kizilirmak et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Bechara and Damasio, 2005</a>). In addition, the intrinsic nature of the reward signals triggered by successful learning in the present experiments finds parallels in reinforcement learning models which show that learning systems incorporating intrinsic (in addition to extrinsic) reward signals surpass those based only on extrinsic ones (<a href=\"#bib96\">Schultz, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Barto et al., 2004</a>). Crucially, in our paradigm, internally generated signals were also fundamental: fMRI activity within the SN/VTA, HP and VS was only modulated by successful learning (i.e., when participants realized that they had extracted a correct meaning; also, confidence and pleasantness ratings were only high during correct trials, see <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>)."

Indeed, several studies have used stimuli that trigger the release of dopamine\u2014especially reward\u2014to induce memory enhancements in human adults (i.e., activating the SN/VTA by a rewarding stimulus such as money enhances the memory for events present during, after and even before the reward was delivered; <a href=\"#bib98\">Shohamy and Adcock, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Krebs et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib108\">Wittman et al., 2005</a>, <a href=\"#bib107\">2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Adcock et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib77\">Murty and Adcock, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib109\">Wolosin et al., 2012</a>). Importantly, not only extrinsic signals but also intrinsic motivational states can enhance memory formation. For example: in a recent study, both the VS and HP showed enhanced activity during the anticipation of trivia answers that were later remembered, only when participants were engaged in states of high curiosity (<a href=\"#bib46\">Gruber et al., 2014</a>). Thus, both anticipation of explicit rewards and intrinsic motivational states can promote memory formation, and both engage the SN/VTA, HP and VS. Likewise, a very recent study demonstrated that after neurofeedback training, human adults displayed the ability to sustain the\u00a0VTA activation without the need for an external reward (<a href=\"#bib66\">MacInnes et al., 2016</a>). <a href=\"#bib66\">MacInnes et al. (2016)</a> also showed that connectivity between the VTA and the HP was enhanced during and after neurofeedback training (thus relating their results to the SN/VTA-Hippocampal loop), although they did not study the impact of this volitional sustained VTA activation on learning. Another source of evidence linking dopamine and memory enhancements comes from pharmacological studies that tried to rise the levels of dopamine in the human brain. In this regard, research has shown memory benefits after the intake of dexamphetamine, which blocks dopaminergic and adrenergic re-uptake, and levodopa (a dopamine precursor; <a href=\"#bib19\">Breitenstein et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib104\">Whiting et al., 2007</a>, <a href=\"#bib105\">2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib97\">Shellshear et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Knecht et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Chowdhury et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Bunzeck et al., 2014</a>)."

We suggest that the activity within the SN/VTA-HP loop can also be modulated by an <i>intrinsic reward</i>\u2014inherent to the process of learning itself and triggered by internal self-monitoring of correct performance\u2014which ultimately promotes the storage of new information into long-term memory via dopaminergic modulation of the midbrain (see <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). Our results do support this working hypothesis, as a\u00a0activity within all three areas of interest was larger for remembered than for forgotten learned new-words in the fMRI experiment. In this vein, dopamine release at the HP can mediate both early (minutes) and late (hours) LTP, although stronger effects have been reported for the latter (<a href=\"#bib86\">Otmakhova and Lisman, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Bethus et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib99\">Smith et al., 2005</a>; for a review see <a href=\"#bib61\">Lisman et al., 2011</a>). The results from Exp. 2\u2014in which pleasantness ratings and SCRs were higher for new-words that were remembered after a 24-hr retention delay\u2014are crucial to support this notion, suggesting that the emotional impact associated to successful learning had an effect on long-term memory formation (see also Exp. 3 for a replication of the behavioural effects after a 1-week retention period). Note that the new-words to be learned were all novel and that the meanings associated with them were equally familiar. Therefore, it is unlikely that subjects may have learned some new-words over others based on their specific characteristics. In addition, the SN/VTA-HP loop was not activated by M- new-words, suggesting that in our paradigm this loop was only triggered by meaningful learning. However and, in spite of all this evidence and although fMRI signals within the SN/VTA have been linked to dopaminergic signalling (<a href=\"#bib38\">D\u00fczel et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib94\">Schott et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Knutson et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib93\">Salimpoor et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Ferenczi et al., 2016</a>), enhanced fMRI activity in isolation only provides indirect evidence for dopamine release. Nevertheless, from a comparative neurobiological perspective, our results converge with previous animal findings revealing that midbrain dopaminergic neurons signal not only primary but also cognitive rewards (<a href=\"#bib20\">Bromberg-Martin et al., 2009</a>) and with a recent study showing that midbrain-dopaminergic neurons of songbirds contribute to song learning, which is also mediated by an\u00a0internal evaluation of correct performance (i.e., songbirds learn to sing by comparing their song to their memory trace of an adult's song; <a href=\"#bib69\">Mandelblat-Cerf et al., 2014</a>)."

Neurons at the SN/VTA are disinhibited by the arriving signal from the HP, which facilitates their dopaminergic firing. In the upward arm of the loop, dopamine is released back into the hippocampus, which in turn enhances memory formation and learning through long term potentiation processes. We suggest that\u2014in the same manner as an\u00a0extrinsic reward modulates the HP, VS, and SN/VTA, and promotes memory benefits\u2014the activity within the SN/VTA-HP loop can be induced by an intrinsic reward inherent to the process of learning itself and triggered by an internal monitoring of correct performance; and that this intrinsic reward ultimately promotes the storage of new information into long-term memory via dopaminergic modulation of the midbrain. We hypothesize that the prefrontal cortex is fundamental for self-monitoring of correct performance (see <a href=\"#bib89\">Ripoll\u00e9s et al., 2014</a> for results showing activity within the inferior, middle and superior frontal gyrus while participants were engaged in the same learning task).

These connectivity results are of utmost importance, as they reveal that the coupling among the HP, VS, and SN/VTA predicted subject-specific memory enhancements (see <a href=\"#bib1\">Adcock et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib109\">Wolosin et al., 2012</a> for similar effects of external reward on SN/VTA-HP connectivity). Regarding the connectivity results, an important limitation of the current work is that, given the poor temporal resolution of fMRI, we cannot fully address the temporal sequence of events during successful word learning. In principle, effective connectivity analyses could have been computed in order to assess the directionality of the reported effects. However, we acquired fMRI volumes in an interleaved order, which is suboptimal for Dynamic Causal Modeling and other types of effective connectivity analyses (<a href=\"#bib100\">Stephan et al., 2010</a>). Future research could take advantage of concurrent EEG and fMRI set-ups and a continuous acquisition of fMRI data to further assess the relationships among the different regions of the SN/VTA-HP loop. In addition, future studies could also try to directly measure the release of dopamine at the HP during learning by means of Positron Emission Tomography (PET) or by using pharmacological interventions (e.g., levodopa intake)."

On the one hand, the simple act of choosing (i.e., participants had perceived control over their learning) can induce enhancements in memory, with the latter being associated with enhanced connectivity between the striatum and the HP (<a href=\"#bib78\">Murty et al., 2015</a>). Importantly, Murty and colleagues emphasized that, in their task, participants were active learners that had a perceived sense of agency over their environment. In a similar manner, in our paradigm participants managed to actively guide their own learning and to successfully monitor their performance, and this also had an effect on memory success (see <a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). However, participants were asked to choose in both M+ and M- conditions, making decisions in both circumstances. Therefore, differences in choice-related activity should have less influence in our paradigm. On the other hand, <a href=\"#bib36\">Duncan et\u00a0al. (2014)</a> showed that connectivity between the HP and the SN/VTA during encoding of a classical associative task, in the\u00a0absence of feedback, was predictive of long-term memory success, providing further support for the SN/VTA-HP loop. It is important to emphasize that according to the SN/VTA-HP model (<a href=\"#bib62\">Lisman and Grace, 2005</a>) this network will be activated when the HP detects that novel information has to be encoded (i.e., by a novelty signal). Although the temporal resolution of fMRI data prevents us from fully disentangling the origin of the detected activity within the SN/VTA-HP loop, given that the ROIs were selected using a meta-analysis on reward and taking into account that the M- and NR condition serve as a control for novelty effects, we suggest that the reported effects are related to intrinsic reward-related (rather than to novelty-related) signals that increased activity within the loop and ultimately enhanced learning. In addition, subjective goals can also modulate activity within the striatum (<a href=\"#bib49\">Han et al., 2010</a>) and, therefore, in our paradigm, participants' internal motivation towards correctly completing the task could also have modulated activity within the areas of the loop. Note, however, that the incongruent condition (M-) partially controls for this possibility, as participants were equally prompted to correctly complete the M+ and M- conditions and in both cases a successful solution could be achieved."

In particular, in two recent studies, activity within the VS (<a href=\"#bib31\">Daniel and Pollmann, 2012</a>) and within the VS and SN/VTA (<a href=\"#bib47\">Guggenmos et al., 2016</a>) was related to the generation of a reward/confidence prediction error (i.e., activity was induced if participants thought that they performed better than they had expected in a perceptual task). In <a href=\"#bib31\">Daniel and Pollmann (2012)</a>, <a href=\"#bib47\">Guggenmos et al. (2016)</a> and in the present work, learning occurs without external feedback, is driven by mesolimbic areas and internally generated signals of correct performance play a fundamental role.

Four participants were rejected due to excessive head movements during the MRI session (abrupt head motion exceeding 4 mm). For Exps. 2 and 3, twenty-four different Spanish speakers were recruited from the student population at the\u00a0Universitat de Barcelona (Barcelona, Spain). All participants were right handed, gave written consent, and received compensation for their participation in accord with local ethics. Thus, the final group consisted of thirty-six participants (mean age, SD = 24.75 \u00b1 4.7, 17 women) for Exp. 1 (same group as in <a href=\"#bib89\">Ripoll\u00e9s et al., 2014</a>), 24 subjects (25.16\u00b1 3.73 years, 15 women) for Exp. 2 and 24 for Exp. 3 (21.16 \u00b1 3.27 years, 18 women). For fMRI Exp. 1, the sample size was chosen based on the recommendation that, in order to achieve 80% of power, at least 30 participants should be included in an experiment in which the expected effect size is medium to large (<a href=\"#bib26\">Cohen, 1988</a>). We decided to recruit 40 participants anticipating possible problems (e.g., participant exclusion due to excessive movement). To determine sample sizes for Experiments 2 and 3 we took into account behavioural results from Exp. 1, in which participants still remembered 68% (<i>SD</i> = 15) of learned new-words in the test carried out approximately 30 min after the encoding session ended (chance level was 33%; effect size of Cohen's d\u00a0=\u00a02.13). Since testing occurred after a 24-hr retention delay, we assumed a more conservative (but still large) effect size of 0.8 (<a href=\"#bib26\">Cohen, 1988</a>). A sample size analysis, calculated using the G*Power program, showed that a sample size of 12 was required to ensure 80% of power to detect a significant effect of encoding at the 5% significance level. We decided to double the calculated a priori sample size, as we expected the 24-hr retention delay to lower the recognition success as compared to Exp. 1."

The two sentences for each noun were built with an increasing degree of contextual constraint (<a href=\"#bib72\">Mestres-Miss\u00e9 et al., 2014</a>). The new-words respected the phonotactic rules of German and were built by changing one or two letters of an existing word. In the current experiment, only half of the pairs of sentences disambiguated multiple meanings, thus enabling the extraction of a correct meaning for the new-word (M+ condition; e.g., 1. \u2018\u2018Every Sunday the grandmother went to the <i>jedin</i>\u2019\u2019 2. \u2018\u2018The man was buried in the <i>jedin</i>\u2019\u2019; <i>jedin</i> means graveyard and is congruent with both the first and second sentence; see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>).

In this case, the new-word was not associated with a congruent meaning across the sentences (M- condition; e.g., 1. \u2018\u2018Every night the astronomer watched the <i>heutil</i>\u2019\u2019. Moon is one possible meaning of <i>heutil</i>. 2. \u2018\u2018In the morning break co-workers drink <i>heutil</i>.\u2019\u2019 Coffee is now one of the possible meanings of <i>heutil</i>, which is not congruent with the first sentence; see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). These constituted the M- condition in which congruent meaning extraction was not possible. To ensure that both stimulus types were equally comparable, participants were told that it was just as crucial to learn the words of the M+ condition as it was to correctly reject the new-words from the M- condition. In this manner, participants were able to use contextual information to self-monitor their correct performance. In addition, non-readable sentences (NR; see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) created from the M+ and M- stimuli by converting each letter into a symbol were also presented as a control.

                                        "text": "Given our explicit a-priori hypothesis regarding the VS, HP, and SN/VTA, an ROI analysis was performed. In order to avoid circularity (<a href=\"#bib33\">Kriegeskorte et al., 2009</a>), the ROIs were created using independent data. The VS ROI was created using the results from an independent monetary gambling task from a previous experiment dealing with the same subjects (contrast: gains&gt;losses, thresholded at FWE-corrected p&lt;0.001; <a href=\"#bib89\">Ripoll\u00e9s et al., 2014</a>). The HP ROI was created using the toolbox Wfu-pickatlas (<a href=\"#bib68\">Maldjian et al., 2003</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"#bib67\">2004</a>) and the Automated Anatomical Labelling Atlas (<a href=\"#bib101\">Tzourio-Mazoyer et al., 2002</a>). The SN/VTA ROI was created using the individual proton density images (that we acquired specifically for this purpose) from all 36 participants in the following way: these images were first segmented using the New Segment tool from SPM8 (an improved version of the 'Unified Segmentation' algorithm; <a href=\"#bib3\">Ashburner and Friston, 2005</a>). The GM and WM tissue probability maps obtained during the segmentation were then fed to DARTEL (<a href=\"#bib4\">Ashburner, 2007</a>) to achieve spatial normalization into MNI space. DARTEL normalization alternates between computing an average template of GM segmentation from all subjects and warping all subjects' GM tissue maps into a better alignment with the template created (<a href=\"#bib5\">Ashburner, 2009</a>). An MNI proton density group template was then obtained by calculating the mean of all normalized images. The SN/VTA ROI was delineated using this template. The present study did not attempt to separate the SN from the VTA as, in humans, these two structures build a continuous dorsal tier (<a href=\"#bib15\">Boehler et al., 2011</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib2\">Ahsan et al., 2007</a>). However, it is important to note that, in humans, most of the dopaminergic cells are located within the SN (<a href=\"#bib14\">Bj\u00f6rklund and Dunnett, 2007</a>). In order to maximize sensitivity within our ROIs, we performed a meta-analysis using NeuroSynth (a platform for large-scale, automated meta-analysis of fMRI data; <a href=\"http://www.neurosynth.org\">www.neurosynth.org</a>; <a href=\"#bib110\">Yarkoni et al., 2011</a>). We calculated a term-based search on reward that resulted in 560 studies (search performed on June 30, 2015). Then, a reverse inference mask (which represented the probability that the term reward was associated with a particular activation) was generated. We then refined the three previously created ROIs (VS, HP, and SN/VTA) by masking them with the results of the NeuroSynth meta-analysis. In other words, each final ROI only contained voxels that were part of the original ROIs (created from a functional localizer used in our previous work for the VS; an anatomical atlas for the HP; and proton density images for the SN/VTA) and that were also reward-related according to the meta-analysis. This procedure followed recommendations from <a href=\"#bib46\">Gruber et al. (2014)</a>, in which the SN/VTA-HP loop was also studied by means of ROIs. In the case of the VS, the original functional ROI remained intact after the masking with the NeuroSynth analysis (i.e., all the voxels included in the functional localizer were reward-related according to the NeuroSynth meta-analysis; number of voxels in the final ROIs: 334 for left VS, 289 for right VS). Vast areas of the originally SN/VTA ROI (defined using proton density images from all our subjects) were also included after masking with the reward meta-analysis, except for very inferior portions (number of voxels in the final ROIs: 101 for left SN/VTA, 99 for right SN/VTA). The original HP ROIs that were created from an anatomical atlas were restricted to the head and anterior body of the hippocampi after masking with the NeuroSynth meta-analysis (number of voxels in the final ROIs: 450 for left HP, 434 for right HP). Finally, an extra ROI covering the primary visual cortex (BA17) was created using the toolbox Wfu-pickatlas and the Automated Anatomical Labelling Atlas, as with the HP ROI (<a href=\"#bib68\">Maldjian et al., 2003</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"#bib67\">2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib101\">Tzourio-Mazoyer et al., 2002</a>). This ROI served as control region to further assess the specificity of our findings (number of voxels in the final ROIs: 362 for left BA17, 370 for right BA17). Therefore, all created ROIs were independent of the word-learning paradigm, thus avoiding 'double-dipping'."

For beta extraction, individual beta coefficients (extracted from the subjects\u2019 first level fMRI analysis) were calculated for each participant by averaging the mean signal within the whole left and right VS, HP, and SN/VTA ROIs (created independently without using any result from the word-learning task, see previous section) for each condition of interest (M+ correct first sentence, M+ incorrect first sentence, M- correct first sentence, M- incorrect first sentence, M+ correct second sentence, M+ incorrect second sentence, M- correct second sentence, M- incorrect second sentence). Our hypothesis was that striatal, midbrain, and hippocampal ROIs would show enhanced activation during successful word-learning due to the intrinsic reward produced by learning the meaning of a new-word. Thus, we focused on a triple interaction between Order, Condition, and Response that would reveal that the areas of interest are only activated when participants learn a new-word. For significant interactions related to these factors, two-tailed paired t-tests for all Correct vs. Incorrect conditions and ROIs were planned.

The result of this product was then reconvolved with the canonical HRF to create the final PPI regressor.

The model included the conditions previously defined for the remembered vs. forgotten analysis, the movement parameters, the deconvolved time-series, and the derived PPI as regressors. Individual models were estimated and main contrasts were generated to test the effects of the PPIs regressor. The computed first level PPI contrast images were entered into a second level random effect analysis (one-sample t-test) which included a covariate with the percentage of correctly remembered M+ new-words during the encoding phase that were still correctly recognized during the post-scan test (remembered new-words). These analyses were restricted to the SN, HP, and SN/VTA ROIs and to the extra control ROI covering the primary visual cortex. Thus, we identified areas within our ROIs that showed connectivity correlating positively or negatively with the subject-specific percentage of remembered words.

The structure of the task was virtually identical to that of the main fMRI experiment. Material consisted of 80 pairs of eight word-long Spanish sentences ending in a new-word, built with an increasing degree of contextual constraint (<a href=\"#bib73\">Mestres-Miss\u00e9 et al., 2009</a>). The new-words respected the phonotactic rules of Spanish and always stood for a noun (mean frequency 38.62 per million). Forty M+ and forty M- pairs of sentences were presented during 10 consecutive runs following the same procedure as in Exp. 1 (no NR sentences were used). Three differences exist between the fMRI and this behavioural word-learning experiment. First, the recognition test, which followed the same structure of the test performed after Exp. 1 (chance level was 33%: no consistent meaning, consistent meaning on the left, consistent meaning on the right), was completed approximately 24 hr after the encoding phase. Second, since head movements and on-line voice recording was no longer an issue (the fMRI set-up did not allow for this feature), participants were now instructed to produce a verbal answer 8 s after the new-word of a second sentence appeared. If participants thought that the new-word had a congruent meaning, they had to provide its meaning in Spanish (e.g., <i>graveyard</i>). If the new-word had no consistent meaning, they had to say the word <i>incongruent.</i> If they did not know whether the new-word had a consistent meaning or not, they had to remain silent. Vocal answers were recorded and later corrected (for the M+ condition, incorrect answers included misses, providing the wrong meaning or saying <i>incongruent;</i> for the M- condition, incorrect answers included misses or providing any meaning at all). No recognition tests were performed after each of the encoding runs since there was no longer need for it. And third, participants had to rate their emotions with respect to arousal and pleasantness using the 9-point visual <i>Self-Assessment Manikin</i> scale (SAM). For valence/pleasantness, the SAM ranges from a sad, frowning figure (i.e., very negative) to a happy, smiling figure (i.e., very positive). For arousal, the SAM ranges from a relaxed figure (i.e., very calm) to an excited figure (i.e., very aroused). Thus, after being prompted to provide a verbal answer, subjects were requested to enter, using the keyboard, a value between \u22124 and 4 (9 point scale with 0 as the neutral value). To avoid biasing our results, participants were not told at any point prior to the start of the experiment that the goal of the study was to assess whether the learning of a new-word and its meaning was intrinsically rewarding. Instead, they were told that the objective of the study was to assess how reading load affects mood and that, in order to ensure that there was a real reading load, they had to learn the words of the M+ condition and to detect the incongruence of the new-words from the M-. Finally, participants were instructed that they had to give pleasantness and arousal ratings when the second sentences appeared because that moment signaled that reading load had already occurred (i.e., half of the encoding block had already elapsed). After the experiment, participants were first questioned about the objective of the study. After an answer was provided, we asked them whether successful word-learning had been rewarding in any way."

This index is modulated by the degree of sympathetic activation: increased sweating provokes a reduction in skin resistance which results in an enhancement of EDA (<a href=\"#bib34\">Dawson et al., 2000</a>). Variations in EDA can be decomposed into tonic\u2014reflecting baseline sympathetic activity and known as skin conductance level (SCL)\u2014and phasic changes. The later, also called skin conductance responses (SCR), are related to transient changes in physiological arousal, and have been associated (among other processes) to enhanced memory formation, emotional processing, and motivational behavior (<a href=\"#bib30\">Damasio, 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Cahill et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Mas-Herrero et al., 2014</a>). Moreover, several studies have shown that explicit monetary rewards modulate SCRs, with larger wins generally generating stronger signals than smaller ones (<a href=\"#bib64\">Lole et al., 2014</a>, <a href=\"#bib65\">2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Dixon et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Goudriaan et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib106\">Wilkes et al., 2010</a>). Finally, previous research using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has shown that SCRs are modulated by a wide neural network including several structures central to reward processing, such as the ventromedial prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortex, the amygdala, and the striatum (<a href=\"#bib79\">Nagai et al., 2004</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Critchley et al., 2000</a>). All in all, this evidence suggests that SCRs can be a good marker of reward processing (<a href=\"#bib83\">Neuhaus et al., 2015</a>). Thus, EDA was used as an objective measure of emotional processing during the word-learning task."

Participants were required to wash their hands with a non-abrasive soap prior to having the electrodes attached (<a href=\"#bib34\">Dawson et al., 2000</a>). Skin conductance was recorded at a constant voltage of 0.5 V and sampled at 200 Hz (0.005 s intervals). Since electrodermal activity is comprised of both phasic responses and a slowly drifting tonic component (<a href=\"#bib16\">Boucsein, 2012</a>), raw data for each participant was filtered with a first order Butterworth high-pass filter with a cut off frequency of 0.05 Hz, following current recommendations (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bach et al., 2013</a>).

Previous studies assessing electrodermal activity have shown that SCR during this time-window is modulated by explicit rewards (<a href=\"#bib65\">Lole et al., 2012</a>, <a href=\"#bib64\">2014</a>). Note that, since verbal responses can influence SCRs (<a href=\"#bib92\">Rothen et al., 2014</a>), participants were instructed to provide an answer after the aforementioned time-window (see <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). First and for each participant, trials were normalized within each condition of interest. Trials in which the SCR signal deviated more than 2 SDs during the first 500 ms after stimulus onset were excluded from the analysis as they might represent artifacts (note that SCRs have a typical latency of 1\u20133 s; <a href=\"#bib34\">Dawson et al., 2000</a>).

The main objectives of Exp. 3 were: (i) explore participants' internal and subjective evaluation of correct performance (especially for false alarms in the M- condition) and (ii) replicate behavioral effects for even longer retention intervals (1 week). Thus, two main differences exist between Experiments 2 and 3. First, before rating their emotions with respect to arousal and pleasantness, participants also provided a confidence rating that allowed us to assess the subjective evaluation of their performance. For consistency reasons, the same scale as for pleasantness and arousal ratings (ranging from \u22124 for very unsure to 4 for very sure, with 0 as a neutral value) was used. And second, the recognition test was completed both 24 hr and 1 week after encoding and also included a Not Remembered option. Thus, the chance level was at 25% (no consistent meaning, consistent meaning on the left, consistent meaning on the right, not remembered). Besides that, the structure of the recognition test at both 24 hr and 1 week was the same as in Exp. 2. In this case and, taking into account that participants had to come three times to the behavioral laboratory (encoding phase, recognition after 24 hr, recognition after 1 week), we opted to make subjects aware than on sessions 2 and 3 a recognition test on both M+ and M- new-words would be completed."

Regarding the reviewers' concerns, as a matter of fact, in both our past (Ripoll\u00e9s et al., 2014) and present work, we used a functional ROI to localize the VS. For the current analyses, we decided to also use a NeuroSynth meta-analysis in order to better pinpoint reward-related regions within our ROIs (to test our hypothesis that word learning is intrinsically rewarding). For this, we first created a set of ROIs by using the functional localizer created in our previous work for the VS (Ripoll\u00e9s et al., 2014) and an anatomical atlas for the HP. For the SN/VTA we specifically acquired proton density images from all our subjects in order to properly identify this structure. Then we used the results from the NeuroSynth meta-analysis on reward to further refine our ROIs. In particular, we masked our original ROIs with the aforementioned meta-analysis. We did this following the work of Gruber and colleagues (2014), which used the same approach (i.e., they created anatomical ROIs of the three regions of the loop and refined them with the NeuroSynth results). Importantly, when we masked the VS ROI from our previous work with the NeuroSynth analysis, the whole original ROI was included. This means that all the voxels included by our functional localizer were also included in the reward meta-analysis. Thus, the selection of VS ROIs in the past and present work are in agreement. Although we indicated this in the previous version of the manuscript [Finally, the three previously created ROIs (VS, HP, and SN/VTA) were masked with this reward mask (as in Gruber et al., 2014; see blue areas in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figures 3</a> and <a href=\"#fig4\">4</a>). The VS ROIs previously defined were not affected by the masking, as they overlapped as a whole with the reward mask], we have now included an extended description of ROI selection.

We have now removed the voxel-wise GLM analysis (former <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>) from the manuscript. In the case of PPI connectivity analyses, we think that using voxel-wise statistics makes a stronger case for our results. In particular, by using voxel-wise analyses we can show whether the areas showing enhanced functional connectivity overlap (e.g., does the same area within the HP show enhanced connectivity when using the VS and the SN/VTA as a source?). In this vein, there was an overlap at the left VS between the analysis in which the seed was placed at the left HP and that in which the left SN/VTA was used as source; the same happened at the HP when using the left SN/VTA or the left VS as seeds (see former <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a> or current <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>). In addition, using voxel-wise statistic for connectivity analyses is in line with other studies assessing the SN/VTA-HP loop in which average-activity analyses were used for remembered/forgotten comparisons, but voxel-wise statistics were employed for connectivity analyses (e.g. Adcock et al., 2006)."

This network contained classical language related regions, including the left inferior frontal gyrus, the left inferior parietal gyrus and the left superior medial frontal gyrus. We respectfully believe that including whole brain analyses that cover these regions is beyond the scope of this work, which is clearly focused at the SN/VTA-HP loop. In addition, the cortical language regions that are modulated by successful encoding are also activated (but to a lesser extent) during, for example, first presentation of an M+ or an M- condition. Thus, the detected activity in these language areas is not specific: activity is induced in cortical language-related regions for both M+ and M- conditions, regardless of correctness or order of presentation (it is just that for M+ correct trials, the activity is higher; see for example the first study using a similar type of learning design, Mestres-Miss\u00e9 et al., 2008). However, the SN/VTA-HP loop is only engaged for M+ correct trials at second presentation, when the participants are able to correctly learn the meaning of a new word (i.e., the activity is very specific: no fMRI signals are enhanced within the areas of the loop by first presentation of a new-word, by incorrectly completing the M+ condition or by completing the M- condition regardless of the outcome)."

The scanning set-up did not allow for online recording of spoken responses. That is why we decided to ask participants about their performance immediately after each encoding run. Participants completed 10 short encoding runs each lasting less than 3 minutes. Each encoding run was immediately followed by a test. On average, mean time between the second presentation of a new word during the encoding block and the presentation of that very same word during testing was approximately 45 seconds. The objective of these tests was to assess for which new-words from the M+ condition correct meaning had been extracted and which new words from the M- had been correctly rejected during each encoding block. That is why we use the terms <i>correct</i> and <i>incorrect</i> throughout the manuscript, as this test allows us to assess the performance of our participants during encoding. Although during fMRI Experiment 1 there is an obvious lag (as stated above, 45 seconds on average) between encoding and testing, results from Experiments 2 and 3 were very similar, and these latter Experiments were carried out in an environment in which online responses could be recorded (i.e., participants did not complete a test after each block; instead provided verbal answers 8 seconds after each second presentation of a new word). In particular, for the M+ condition participants learned the meaning of 60%, 62% and 57% of M+ new words in Experiments.1 (fMRI), 2 (EDA) and 3 (behavioral) respectively. The same happens for the control condition in which participants correctly rejected 61%, 59% and 62% of M- new words in Experiments 1, 2 and 3, respectively. The pattern of results from all experiments is remarkably similar. Indeed, as stated in Appendix 1, when submitting the number of learned new-words (M+) and the number of correctly rejected new-words (M-) to a mixed repeated measures ANOVA with Condition (M+,M-) as a within-subjects variable and Group (Experiment1: fMRI participants, Experiment 2: Behavioral-EDA participants, Experiment 3: Behavioral participants) as a between subjects variable, no significant effect of Group [<i>F</i>(2,81)=0.09, p&gt;0.91] or Group \u00d7 Condition interaction was found [<i>F</i>(2,81)=0.654, p&gt;0.52].

Although we agree that reporting bilateral activations might ease the flow of the manuscript, we would like to keep the results as they are. The rationale behind this lies in the well-known fact that language is cortically left-lateralized for more than 90% of right handed individuals (Springer et al., 1999). Therefore, researchers from the language domain might find it interesting that subcortical reward and memory related areas show a bilateral pattern, whereas cortical language-related regions were indeed left lateralized during successful word learning in our task as previously reported (Ripoll\u00e9s et al., 2014). We think that showing separated plots in the Figures and separated t-tests in the results section for each ROI further emphasizes this remarkable result (i.e., the fact that reward-related effects were not left-lateralized, even though the items to be memorized were language-related). Of course, if the reviewers still think that the manuscript will benefit from reporting collapsed results for the hemispheres we are willing to further address this question in subsequent reviews."
