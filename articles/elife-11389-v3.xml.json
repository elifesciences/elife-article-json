                    "text": "Aneuploidy in human eggs is the leading cause of pregnancy loss and Down\u2019s syndrome. Aneuploid eggs result from chromosome segregation errors when an egg develops from a progenitor cell, called an oocyte. The mechanisms that lead to an increase in aneuploidy with advanced maternal age are largely unclear. Here, we show that many sister kinetochores in human oocytes are separated and do not behave as a single functional unit during the first meiotic division. Having separated sister kinetochores allowed bivalents to rotate by 90 degrees on the spindle and increased the risk of merotelic kinetochore-microtubule attachments. Advanced maternal age led to an increase in sister kinetochore separation, rotated bivalents and merotelic attachments. Chromosome arm cohesion was weakened, and the fraction of bivalents that precociously dissociated into univalents was increased. Together, our data reveal multiple age-related changes in chromosome architecture that could explain why oocyte aneuploidy increases with advanced maternal age."

Aneuploid eggs result from chromosome segregation errors when an egg develops from a progenitor cell, called an oocyte. The mechanisms that lead to an increase in aneuploidy with advanced maternal age are largely unclear. Here, we show that many sister kinetochores in human oocytes are separated and do not behave as a single functional unit during the first meiotic division. Having separated sister kinetochores allowed bivalents to rotate by 90 degrees on the spindle and increased the risk of merotelic kinetochore-microtubule attachments. Advanced maternal age led to an increase in sister kinetochore separation, rotated bivalents and merotelic attachments. Chromosome arm cohesion was weakened, and the fraction of bivalents that precociously dissociated into univalents was increased. Together, our data reveal multiple age-related changes in chromosome architecture that could explain why oocyte aneuploidy increases with advanced maternal age."

In an immature egg cell, chromosomes that came from the woman\u2019s father are paired up with the matching chromosomes from the woman\u2019s mother and the handle-like structures on each chromosome (called the kinetochores) are fused. Just before the immature egg cell divides, a molecular machine called \u2018the spindle\u2019 attaches to the chromosome handles. The spindle then separates these pairs of chromosomes such that each new cell receives only one copy of each chromosome. However, while it is known that this process sometimes goes wrong, it is not clear why mistakes happen more often in older women."

This revealed that the chromosome handles that were supposed to be fused had often disconnected in women over 35 years old. Chromosome pairs without correctly fused handles were also prone to rotating during the division process, and sometimes the pairs simply fell apart too soon."

Segregating the chromosomes accurately is vital for the development of healthy human embryos upon fertilization. Surprisingly, oocytes segregate their chromosomes much more inaccurately than do human mitotic cells (<a href=\"#bib24\">Nagaoka et al., 2012</a>, <a href=\"#bib17\">Knouse et al., 2014</a>), human spermatocytes (<a href=\"#bib27\">Pacchierotti et al., 2007</a>, <a href=\"#bib34\">Templado et al., 2011</a>) or mouse oocytes (<a href=\"#bib27\">Pacchierotti et al., 2007</a>, <a href=\"#bib6\">Danylevska et al., 2014</a>, <a href=\"#bib12\">Hassold and Hunt, 2001</a>).

Why chromosomes missegregate so frequently, even in oocytes from young women, is still poorly understood. We showed previously that human oocytes assemble a spindle by an unusually long and error-prone mechanism that is likely to sensitize human oocytes of all ages to abnormal kinetochore-microtubule attachments and chromosome segregation errors (<a href=\"#bib13\">Holubcova et al., 2015</a>).

The architecture of chromosomes differs in meiosis and mitosis. During the first meiotic division, the oocyte segregates entire chromosomes instead of sister chromatids as is the case in mitosis. To facilitate this, the chromosome pairs are linked with each other through meiotic recombination (<a href=\"#bib24\">Nagaoka et al., 2012</a>, <a href=\"#bib18\">Kong et al., 2004</a>, <a href=\"#bib1\">Baudat et al., 2013</a>). The sister kinetochores of each chromosome become unified so that they function as a single kinetochore (<a href=\"#bib36\">Watanabe, 2012</a>). This prevents the undesirable bi-orientation of sister kinetochores during meiosis I (<a href=\"#bib36\">Watanabe, 2012</a>, <a href=\"#bib37\">Yokobayashi and Watanabe, 2005</a>, <a href=\"#bib15\">Kim et al., 2015</a>). The resulting unit of two linked chromosomes with two functional kinetochores is called a bivalent chromosome. The cohesion complex has a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of the bivalents: it holds the homologous chromosomes together and promotes the close association of the sister kinetochores (<a href=\"#bib28\">Petronczki et al., 2003</a>, <a href=\"#bib36\">Watanabe, 2012</a>)."

First, we assessed if having three or four functionally distinct kinetochores per bivalent increased the probability of abnormal kinetochore-microtubule attachments. During meiosis I, the sister kinetochores of each chromosome should be attached to a single spindle pole only (amphitelic attachment). In this way, they can be segregated accurately after anaphase onset. If a pair of sister kinetochores is attached to opposite spindle poles instead (merotelic attachment), the chromosome will be pulled from both sides of the spindle upon anaphase onset. Such pulling will cause a chromosome to lag behind during anaphase (<a href=\"#bib4\">Cimini et al., 2001</a>, <a href=\"#bib20\">Lane et al., 2012</a>). This can lead to aneuploidy when the ingressing cytokinetic furrow partitions chromosomes inaccurately between the egg and the polar body. To assess how the bivalent chromosomes were attached to the spindle, we briefly placed the oocytes on ice before fixation. This selectively preserves the more stable microtubules that interact with kinetochores (<a href=\"#bib39\">Zhai et al., 1995</a>). We then stained the oocytes for microtubules, chromosomes and kinetochores."

This could potentially be due to improved accessibility from the opposite spindle pole, when two tightly joined sister kinetochores are compared with two separated sister kinetochores."

This is consistent with the increased fraction of separated sister kinetochores with advanced maternal age. Separated kinetochores were more likely to be merotelically attached in oocytes from older women than in oocytes from young women (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). This could be explained by the increase in the degree of separation between sister kinetochores as women get older (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>), as well as additional age-related defects that could contribute to aberrant attachments."

Given that the orientation of sister kinetochores in these rotated bivalents is inverted, we called these bivalents \u2018inverted bivalents\u2019. We also often observed half-inverted bivalents, in which only one pair of the sister kinetochores was oriented towards opposite spindle poles (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A\u2013C</a> bottom row, half-inverted; <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1D</a>, right panel), while the other pair was correctly oriented, with both sister kinetochores facing a single spindle pole (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). Bivalent rotation was also evident from the distribution of Shugoshin-1, which marked the pairs of sister kinetochores (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>, <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>; <a href=\"#media6\">Videos 5,6</a>). Interestingly, Shugoshin-1 associated with a wider domain than in meiosis I mouse oocytes (<a href=\"#bib21\">Lee et al., 2008</a>). It will be interesting to investigate how meiotic cohesion is achieved in human oocytes and whether the unexpected kinetochore configurations that we observed could be linked to species-specific differences in this process."

Importantly, kinetochores of inverted bivalents were linked to the spindle through cold-resistant and thus stable microtubules (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2A,C</a>). This indicates that the altered orientation of kinetochores in inverted bivalents does not completely compromise their ability to capture microtubules. Moreover, the incidence of inverted bivalents increased with maternal age, from 12.5% in oocytes from women under 30 to 40% in oocytes from women over 35 years old (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F</a>; <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). This is consistent with the increased separation of sister kinetochores with maternal age, which is expected to promote the rotation (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2B,D</a>)."

In around 20% of bivalents with split sister kinetochores, the chromosomes were twisted, as judged by the observation that their sister kinetochore pairs were oriented perpendicular instead of parallel to each other (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Such twisting is likely to exert additional forces on arm cohesion, which is possibly already weakened in oocytes at the time of meiotic resumption (<a href=\"#bib7\">Duncan et al., 2012</a>, <a href=\"#bib2\">Chiang et al., 2010</a>). Arm cohesion was indeed reduced in a large fraction of chromosome bivalents (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,C,D</a>). In total, 10% of all bivalents were weakly associated as evident from a gap in the bivalents\u2019 center. In some cases, the chromosomes were separated by a gap of a few 100 nm only. In other cases, gaps of up to 3.2 \u00b5m between two chromosomes were visible (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). Despite the gap, the chromosome pairs were under tension, with each pair of sister kinetochores facing the correct spindle pole. This suggests that chromosomes with reduced arm cohesion still behave as functional bivalents."

The fraction of bivalents affected by loss of arm cohesion increased significantly with maternal age. In women under 30, 5% of all chromosome pairs were separated by gaps or completely disintegrated into univalents. This increased to 11% of chromosome pairs in women over 35 years old (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). A recent study also reported the presence of univalents in oocytes from older women (<a href=\"#bib29\">Sakakibara et al., 2015</a>). Our data suggests that the premature dissociation of bivalents into univalents also contributes to aneuploidy in oocytes from young women (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>). It also provides further evidence from a larger number of oocytes that an increase in univalents is a likely contributor to the maternal age effect, because more than 40% of oocytes from women over 35 featured univalents (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5F</a>)."

The period of chromosome congression and alignment coincided in time with spindle instability and reorganization (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>).

Thus, a decisive question in understanding how aneuploidy arises is whether human oocytes have effective control mechanisms that monitor progression into anaphase. In mitosis, the spindle assembly checkpoint delays progression into anaphase until all chromosomes are correctly attached to the spindle (<a href=\"#bib23\">Musacchio and Salmon, 2007</a>). Whether human oocytes have similar mechanisms is unclear. Live imaging revealed that all oocytes without chromosome alignment defects progressed into anaphase. Similarly, all oocytes with mild alignment defects and 92% of oocytes with severe misalignment progressed into anaphase (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>; <a href=\"#media7\">Videos 7</a>, <a href=\"#media8\">8</a>). Thus, the presence of chromosome alignment defects did not preclude progression into anaphase. In addition, the onset of anaphase was not severely delayed when misaligned or lagging chromosomes were present (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C,D</a>). Less prominent delays might however be masked by some variability in anaphase timing between oocytes. Collectively, these results suggest that human oocytes progress into anaphase with normal efficiency and without major delays if chromosomes are misaligned."

Firstly, why is chromosome segregation in human oocytes in general more error-prone than in mitosis, even in oocytes from young women? Our previous work established that the spindles in human oocytes form over a lengthy and error-prone process, during which the spindle undergoes extensive reorganization. Chromosomes frequently remain merotellically attached to the spindle close to anaphase onset. These merotelic attachments could be favoured by the high instability and morphology of the spindle in human oocytes (<a href=\"#bib13\">Holubcova et al., 2015</a>). The data presented in this study suggest that merotelic attachments are also promoted by the split nature of sister kinetochores in human oocytes."

                        "text": "It is conceivable that the specialized architecture of bivalents in human oocytes and spindle reorganization are directly linked: the fact that the four sister kinetochores of a bivalent chromosome can interact with microtubules independently may make it more challenging for the oocyte to correctly attach the bivalents to the spindle. Thus, more extensive spindle reorganization may be required to correct attachment errors that arise during spindle assembly. Conversely, repeated rounds of microtubule attachment and detachment during spindle reorganization may further exacerbate splitting of sister kinetochores and cause strain on chromosome arm cohesion, promoting the twisting of bivalents and the precocious dissociation of bivalents into univalents. In this way, spindle reorganization could contribute to chromosome segregation defects in human oocytes."

                        "text": "Secondly, what causes the maternal age effect? We show that bivalents disintegrate precociously into univalents as women get older. Univalents were observed in more than 40% of oocytes from women over 35, suggesting that they are a major contributor to the maternal age effect, consistent with a recent study (<a href=\"#bib29\">Sakakibara et al., 2015</a>). We also demonstrate that the degree of sister kinetochore separation increases with advanced maternal age. Sister kinetochore separation correlated with merotelic kinetochore-microtubule attachment. In addition, it allowed bivalents to rotate on the spindle with each of their sister-kinetochores facing towards opposite spindle poles. This is unexpected, because it is generally believed that mechanisms exist that prevent the biorientation of sister kinetochores in meiosis I. We observed half- or fully-inverted bivalents in a large fraction of oocytes. It is possible that some of these abnormal attachments are corrected by the time of anaphase onset. However, it is unclear whether mechanisms exist in the oocyte that could detect these inverted bivalents and correct their attachment. Our observation that human oocytes progress into anaphase efficiently even if misaligned chromosomes are present suggests that oocytes could in principle also progress into anaphase with inverted bivalents (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). Such inverted bivalents could lag behind during anaphase if centromeric cohesion is still intact in one or both of the two pairs of sister kinetochores. If centromeric cohesion is compromised in one of the two sister kinetochores, the bivalent could disintegrate into one univalent and two sister chromatids. If centromeric cohesion is compromised in both pairs of sister kinetochores, the bivalent could disintegrate into four individual sister chromatids upon anaphase onset, and two non-sister chromatids of different primary parental origin would remain in the egg (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). Interestingly, a recent genetic study has reported that precisely this segregation outcome, which was called reverse segregation, seems to be a major cause of chromosome segregation errors during meiosis I in human oocytes (<a href=\"#bib26\">Ottolini et al., 2015</a>). The mechanisms behind this reverse segregation pattern have remained unclear. Our study indicates that inverted bivalents are likely to contribute to this segregation pattern."

The donors were aged between 23 and 46 years and underwent ovarian stimulation (<a href=\"#bib8\">Faddy et al., 2011</a>) for intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). Couples were referred for ICSI treatment because of male factor associated infertility (69.4%), absence of a male partner (6.0%), polycystic ovary/anovulatory syndrome (5.2%), tubal damage (2.3%), endometriosis (0.7%), idiopathic infertility (11.9%) or a combination of the above/other factors (3.5%). Only oocytes that were immature at the time of the ICSI procedure and thus could not be used for in vitro fertilization were used in this study. All patients participating in this study gave informed consent for these surplus oocytes to be used in this study and for the results of this study to be published. Oocytes were collected and cultured as previously described (<a href=\"#bib13\">Holubcova et al., 2015</a>). In brief, immature live oocytes were collected within 5 hr after retrieval from ovaries and transported from Bourn Hall Clinic to the MRC. The oocytes were microinjected with 10\u201315 \u00b5l (1\u20132% of human oocyte volume) of 1\u20132 \u00b5g/\u00b5l mRNA encoding fluorescently labelled proteins using mercury-filled needles based on previously published methods (<a href=\"#bib14\">Jaffe and Terasaki, 2004</a>, <a href=\"#bib30\">Schuh and Ellenberg, 2007</a>).

We realise, however, that this type of approach in human oocytes may remain technically very challenging, and therefore this addition should not be considered an absolute requirement for further consideration of the manuscript. In this case, however, the manuscript should be edited accordingly, i.e. it should clearly indicate that the study is correlative in nature."

Importantly, the physical separation of the sister kinetochores also leads to the establishment of separate kinetochore fibers, and in frequent kinetochore-microtubule attachment errors. The analysis required a considerable experimental tour-de-force. The study is descriptive but of great interest in that it provides first-hand insights into a fundamental cell division process in humans.

Furthermore (and more important), it is not clear that sisters separated by a greater distance are more likely to segregate incorrectly. Additional data would be necessary to make this claim convincing, such as live imaging showing that \"split\" kinetochores are more likely to end up as lagging chromosomes in anaphase or to segregate incorrectly."

Previous work has implicated defects in sister chromatid cohesion as accounting for at least some of the age-dependent increases in meiotic chromosome segregation errors. In this paper, Zielinska et al. additionally implicate kinetochore pairing as a source of meiotic errors by showing that many sister kinetochores in meiosis I oocytes of young donors are split into two distinct units rather than unified as in mouse oocytes. The majority of these split sister kinetochores are attached to distinct kinetochore fibers, indicating that the spindle recognizes them as separate kinetochores. Intriguingly, the proportion of separated kinetochores found in oocytes from older donors was higher than those from younger donors. Additionally, separated kinetochores are more likely to form improper merotelic attachments with associated kinetochore fibers. This work also found that bivalents where one or more of the sister kinetochore pairs are separated are able to rotate and twist on the spindle. Many bivalents also had gaps between chromosome pairs or had even separated completely into univalents, indicating a reduction in cohesion along chromosome arms. Univalents were found more often in oocytes from older donors. The authors found that a large fraction of oocytes had misaligned chromosomes at anaphase onset, but the vast majority of these did not undergo a metaphase I arrest, but instead progressed into anaphase without significant delay."

This work also provides possible explanations behind both the error-prone nature of human female meiosis and the maternal age effect. However, although the observations made in this paper are of high quality, the causal relationships between the various data points remain elusive. Ultimately, the data in this paper are primarily observational, although this is intimately related to the nature of the system that they are using (oocytes from human donors). To my knowledge, no one else is doing this type and high quality of work in human oocytes, and the broad importance of this work clearly justifies its publication.

In each case, they visualize these using a limited selection of markers. I feel that the histone and tubulin markers used for the live cell imaging are sufficient to visualize what they want to see in this case, and nicely justify their main points related to meiotic progression. However, as a major focus of this work is the nature of the connections between the two sister kinetochores on a homologue and their attachment to the spindle, I am not sure that CREST staining provides the best marker for kinetochores in the fixed cell case. CREST stains a variety of centromere and kinetochore proteins, and as it is derived from different human autoimmune patients it is never exactly clear what a batch corresponds to. The primary protein that is likely to be detected here is CENP-B, which is not the best marker for kinetochore function. If possible, I would strongly suggest that the authors repeat this analysis for a very small and limited set of oocytes (I appreciate the complexity of these experiments and how precious these oocytes are) to confirm these results using an antibody targeted against a constitutive centromere component, such as CENP-A or CENP-C, and an outer kinetochore component, such as Ndc80. Excellent commercial antibodies exist for these, and it would help increase the impact of their findings. For example, it is technically possible that one of these kinetochores is inactivated, at least in some cases. Such a kinetochore would stain for CENP-B, but not for Ndc80, for example."

Fortunately, there is a beautiful recent Nature Genetics paper by Ottolini et al. (2105), which the authors nicely and appropriately cite, which describes the products of meiosis and reveals a surprisingly common pattern of reverse meiosis (with the sister chromatids segregating first). This is consistent with the results presented here. However, in addition to frequent sister separation in MI, this requires this behavior to be compensated for in MII. In this case, the sister separation would not be a cause of errors, but would lead instead to a different meiotic program. It would be interesting to consider (and visualize if possible, although again I understand the limitations here) what happens in MII for the cells that precociously separate sister chromatids in MI."

As it stands, the Abstract and title, for example, are worded to imply a causal relationship. I would urge caution such that the authors propose these ideas, but use wording that suggests these, instead of demonstrating it. Similarly, although the authors cite prior work suggesting that a reduction in sister chromatid cohesion contributes to the age dependent increase in maternal aneuploidy, they don't specifically address this idea in the text. Based on the potential mechanisms for sister kinetochore pairing in MI, there is the possibility of an intimate linkage between cohesion defects and kinetochore orientation problems."

An additional analysis that breaks down the kinetochores with merotelic attachments by both age and kinetochore configuration would address this. In this case, I would hope that the authors would be able to present this data based on the oocytes that they have already imaged and without conducting additional experiments."

The \"spindle\" paper is already published and makes a strong claim for the importance of spindle defects, so the burden is on this paper to make a convincing case that the kinetochore defects are also important.</i>"

In each case, they visualize these using a limited selection of markers. I feel that the histone and tubulin markers used for the live cell imaging are sufficient to visualize what they want to see in this case, and nicely justify their main points related to meiotic progression. However, as a major focus of this work is the nature of the connections between the two sister kinetochores on a homologue and their attachment to the spindle, I am not sure that CREST staining provides the best marker for kinetochores in the fixed cell case. CREST stains a variety of centromere and kinetochore proteins, and as it is derived from different human autoimmune patients it is never exactly clear what a batch corresponds to. The primary protein that is likely to be detected here is CENP-B, which is not the best marker for kinetochore function. If possible, I would strongly suggest that the authors repeat this analysis for a very small and limited set of oocytes (I appreciate the complexity of these experiments and how precious these oocytes are) to confirm these results using an antibody targeted against a constitutive centromere component, such as CENP-A or CENP-C, and an outer kinetochore component, such as Ndc80. Excellent commercial antibodies exist for these, and it would help increase the impact of their findings. For example, it is technically possible that one of these kinetochores is inactivated, at least in some cases. Such a kinetochore would stain for CENP-B, but not for Ndc80, for example.</i>"

The co-staining of Hec1 together with CREST shows that the separation of kinetochores is also true for the outer kinetochore region, as shown by the localization of this Ndc80 component. We show that the pattern of staining for CREST and Hec1 is very similar. Moreover, we observed all types of kinetochore configurations with Hec1 staining which we have previously observed with CREST labelling (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). Due to the scarce supply of samples and the difficulty in finding antibodies that work in oocytes, we were unfortunately not able to find an inner kinetochore antibody that works reliably in human oocytes. Nonetheless, investigating the distribution of the inner versus outer kinetochore markers in human oocytes is of high importance and is a very interesting point to address in future studies."

Fortunately, there is a beautiful recent Nature Genetics paper by Ottolini et al.

This is consistent with the results presented here. However, in addition to frequent sister separation in MI, this requires this behavior to be compensated for in MII. In this case, the sister separation would not be a cause of errors, but would lead instead to a different meiotic program. It would be interesting to consider (and visualize if possible, although again I understand the limitations here) what happens in MII for the cells that precociously separate sister chromatids in MI.</i>"

I would urge caution such that the authors propose these ideas, but use wording that suggests these, instead of demonstrating it. Similarly, although the authors cite prior work suggesting that a reduction in sister chromatid cohesion contributes to the age dependent increase in maternal aneuploidy, they don't specifically address this idea in the text.

At this stage it is difficult to unequivocally state the degree to which spindle forces contribute to sister kinetochore separation. This question would ideally be addressed by high resolution live imaging of kinetochores and scoring the separation in the same oocyte at different time points. This is however experimentally very challenging and could not yet be achieved in our lab for human oocytes. Moreover, because human oocytes nucleate microtubules from chromosomes (Holubcova et al., 2015), the morphology of human bivalents together with the compactness of chromosomes during the initial stages of spindle remodeling make it practically impossible to reliably measure all the distances at the early stages. Also, because the kinetochores may already be separated at this stage, the high proximity of the bivalents before the bipolar spindle assembles could lead to an incorrect assignment of kinetochores to the bivalents. Because human bivalents vary greatly in size, we also believe that it would not be representative to measure the inter kinetochore distances only in a fraction of bivalents that are on the surface of the remodeling chromatin mass and are hence more accessible to investigations."
