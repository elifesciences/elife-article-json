These collections provide a uniform and stable supply of living organisms and related materials that enhance the reproducibility of research and minimize the need for repetitive calibration. While collections differ in many ways, they all require expertise in maintaining living organisms and good logistical systems for keeping track of stocks and fulfilling requests for specimens. Here, we review some of the contributions made by living stock collections to research across all branches of the tree of life, and outline the challenges they face."

These collections provide a uniform and stable supply of living organisms and related materials that enhance the reproducibility of research and minimize the need for repetitive calibration. While collections differ in many ways, they all require expertise in maintaining living organisms and good logistical systems for keeping track of stocks and fulfilling requests for specimens. Here, we review some of the contributions made by living stock collections to research across all branches of the tree of life, and outline the challenges they face."

By allowing access to identical strains, cultivars and cell lines, the collections allow published research to be directly reproduced.

This meeting was open to collaborators from every domain of life, and included participants from natural history collections, as well as living research and biodiversity collections (<a href=\"http://www.usccn.org/Pages/USCCN_Nagoya_2017.aspx\">http://www.usccn.org/Pages/USCCN_Nagoya_2017.aspx</a>). As exemplified by the engagement at this meeting, staff at living collections are at the forefront of ensuring that ethical practices are followed in obtaining and distributing living resources. Importantly, the participants heard from the USA National Focal Point for the Nagoya Protocol that the USA does not restrict access to germplasm, although certain landowners or managers, such as the US National Park System, may have their own requirements for accessing genetic resources."

The highly divergent perspectives on what constitutes \u201caccess\u201d emphasize that researchers should consult the ABSCH prior to using genetic resources (or information) with an origin outside their own country."

While some medical and agricultural collections receive public funds, many public biodiversity and genetics collections do not. Without this external support, the collections managers have no alternative but to recover the costs of collection maintenance by raising user fees. While this simple approach is appealing, it creates a scenario where only well-funded laboratories can afford to obtain validated materials."

Living collections will benefit substantially if journal editors and granting agencies enact and enforce requirements that materials described in publications be available from public repositories, just as gene and genome sequences are required to be deposited in and distributed by public data repositories. Requiring capacity building beyond simply preserving the materials from the past will allow preservation and documentation of the large numbers of deposits generated by the requirement that living resources be available from public sources. Standing on the shoulders of giants is made easier by access to shared materials. The availability of authentic and diverse materials from published research empowers all investigators, regardless of their career stage or funding status."

One must realize that this QC is crucial and that a correct application of the implemented QC system is key for the operational value of the whole system. Indeed, living stocks are subjected to genetic drifting during their preservation period. If the cultures are used for taxonomic references, the taxonomic markers are usually stable enough for identification above the strain/specimen level. However, when markers are used for identification at or even below the strain level (isolate/specimen level) the reference strains may have undergone genetic changes that make them no longer suited as references for identification, or in those cases where the living stocks are used in certified test in e.g. pharmaceutical context.\""
