Whether adaptation to viruses typically involves only specialized antiviral proteins or affects a broad array of virus-interacting proteins is unknown. Here, we analyze adaptation in ~1300 virus-interacting proteins manually curated from a set of 9900 proteins conserved in all sequenced mammalian genomes. We show that viruses (i) use the more evolutionarily constrained proteins within the cellular functions they interact with and that (ii) despite this high constraint, virus-interacting proteins account for a high proportion of all protein adaptation in humans and other mammals. Adaptation is elevated in virus-interacting proteins across all functional categories, including both immune and non-immune functions. We conservatively estimate that viruses have driven close to 30% of all adaptive amino acid changes in the part of the human proteome conserved within mammals. Our results suggest that viruses are one of the most dominant drivers of evolutionary change across mammalian and human proteomes."

Whether adaptation to viruses typically involves only specialized antiviral proteins or affects a broad array of virus-interacting proteins is unknown. Here, we analyze adaptation in ~1300 virus-interacting proteins manually curated from a set of 9900 proteins conserved in all sequenced mammalian genomes. We show that viruses (i) use the more evolutionarily constrained proteins within the cellular functions they interact with and that (ii) despite this high constraint, virus-interacting proteins account for a high proportion of all protein adaptation in humans and other mammals. Adaptation is elevated in virus-interacting proteins across all functional categories, including both immune and non-immune functions. We conservatively estimate that viruses have driven close to 30% of all adaptive amino acid changes in the part of the human proteome conserved within mammals. Our results suggest that viruses are one of the most dominant drivers of evolutionary change across mammalian and human proteomes."

Many of these VIPs play instead key functions in basic cellular processes, some of which might be essential for viral replication."

There are reasons to believe that such an evolutionary response to viruses might be limited, however. First, most VIPs evolve unusually slowly rather than unusually fast both in animals (<a href=\"#bib11\">Davis et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">J\u00e4ger et al., 2011</a>) and in plants (<a href=\"#bib49\">Mukhtar et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">We\u00dfling et al., 2014</a>). Second, VIPs tend to interact with proteins that are functionally important hubs in the protein-protein interaction network of the host possibly limiting their ability to adapt (<a href=\"#bib16\">Dyer et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Halehalli and Nagarajaram, 2015</a>). Finally, very few cases of adaptation to viruses are known outside of fast evolving, specialized antiviral proteins (<a href=\"#bib15\">Demogines et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Meyerson et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Meyerson and Sawyer, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Meyerson et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Ng et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Ortiz et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib64\">Schaller et al., 2011</a>). Transferrin receptor or TFRC is the most notable exception, and serves as a striking example of a non-immune, housekeeping protein used by viruses (<a href=\"#bib14\">Demogines et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Kaelber et al., 2012</a>). TFRC is responsible for iron uptake in many different cell types and is used as a cell surface receptor by diverse viruses in rodents and carnivores. TFRC has repeatedly evaded binding by viruses through recurrent adaptive amino acid changes. As such, TFRC is the only clear-cut example of a host protein not involved in antiviral response that is known to adapt in response to viruses."

These 1300 VIPs come from a set of ~10000 proteins conserved across 24 well-sequenced mammalian genomes (Materials and methods). As expected, the vast majority of these VIPs (~80%) have no known antiviral or any other more broadly defined immune activity. We confirm that VIPs do tend to evolve slowly and demonstrate that this is because VIPs experience much stronger evolutionary constraint than other proteins within the same functional categories. However, despite this greater evolutionary constraint, VIPs display higher rates of adaptation compared to other proteins. This excess of adaptation is visible in VIPs across biological functions, on multiple time scales, in multiple taxa, and across multiple studied viruses. Finally, we showcase the power of our global scan for adaptation in VIPs by studying the case of aminopeptidase N, a well-known multifunctional enzyme (<a href=\"#bib48\">Mina-Osorio, 2008</a>) used by coronaviruses as a receptor (<a href=\"#bib12\">Delmas et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Yeager et al., 1992</a>). Using our approach we reach an amino-acid level understanding of parallel adaptive evolution in aminopeptidase N in response to coronaviruses in a wide range of mammals."

The Messer-Petrov approach estimates <i>\u03b1</i> for each frequency category separately and then uses the functional dependence of <i>\u03b1</i> on allele frequency to extrapolate <i>\u03b1</i> at fixation. This approach thus requires well-resolved frequency data necessitating the use of the 1000 genomes data and also lacks power to estimate <i>\u03b1</i> for small subsets of genes. We thus use this approach only to better quantify the true <i>\u03b1</i> in the complete sets of VIPs and non-VIPs.

It is also plausible that a substantial proportion of the VIPs we study are also VIPs in multiple mammalian lineages. Indeed, viruses infecting humans (including the ten viruses with the most VIPs) are known to have close viral relatives in many other mammals, with the exception of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) for which only distant relatives are known and primarily in bats (<a href=\"#bib59\">Quan et al., 2013</a>). There is also growing evidence that distantly related viruses tend to interact with overlapping sets of host proteins (<a href=\"#bib27\">J\u00e4ger et al., 2011</a>, <a href=\"#bib11\">Davis et al., 2015</a>). We thus hypothesize that VIPs, while identified primarily in humans, may have also experienced frequent adaptation in mammals in general, with the possible exception of the VIPs interacting with HCV."

For a specific coding sequence, the BS-REL and BUSTED tests estimate the proportion of codons where the rate of non-synonymous substitutions is higher than the rate of synonymous substitutions (dN/dS&gt;1), which is a hallmark of adaptive evolution. The BS-REL test estimates proportions of selected codons specifically for each branch, whereas BUSTED estimates an overall proportion of selected codons across the entire tree. Both tests then compare two competing models of evolution, one with adaptive substitutions and one without adaptive substitutions, and decide whether the model with adaptation is a significantly better fit to the data."

We confirm this in our dataset by observing a strong positive correlation between the pN/pS ratio in great apes and the proportion of selected codons across mammals estimated by the BS-REL test (Spearman\u2019s rank correlation <i>\u03c1</i> =0.34, p&lt;2x10<sup>-16</sup>, n=9861). We therefore use a permutation test with a target average (Materials and methods) that matches VIPs and non-VIPs with similar pN/pS ratios in order to compare VIPs and non-VIPs that experience similar levels of purifying selection and providing us with similar power to detect adaptation (Materials and methods and <a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplements 1</a> and <a href=\"#fig5s2\">2</a>)."

We further use an increasingly strict level of evidence for the presence of adaptation, by including only proteins with increasingly low BUSTED <i>P</i>-values; that is, increasingly high probability that adaptation occurred somewhere on the tree (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a> shows that VIPs with the strongest evidence of adaptation (BUSTED <i>P</i>-values lower than 10<sup>-5</sup>) have a six-fold excess of strong signals of adaptation (permutation test <i>P</i>=0 after 10<sup>9</sup> permutations). In <a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3</a> we further show that this excess of adaptation in VIPs is due to i) more VIPs with signals of adaptation than non-VIPs, ii) more branches of the tree per VIP showing adaptation, and iii) a greater proportion of codons evolving adaptively per branch. In line with the MK test, we find that the excess of adaptation in mammals is robust to the potential confounding factors of expression at the RNA and protein levels, and to the number of host protein-protein interactions (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1H</a>).

Overall these results suggest that the arms race with viruses has strongly increased the rate of adaptation in a wide range of VIPs."

However, all mammalian clades in the tree show a similar excess of adaptation in VIPs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). Primates stand out due to their low overall proportions of positively selected codons compared to the other mammalian clades in the tree (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). This is most likely due to a lower statistical power of the BS-REL test in the short primate branches (<a href=\"#bib35\">Kosakovsky Pond et al., 2011</a>). In line with this, VIPs with strong signals of adaptation show such signals in all the mammalian clades represented (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). This includes well-known antiviral VIPs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>), antiviral VIPs where adaptation was previously unknown across mammals (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>), and non-antiviral VIPs with diverse, well-studied functions in the mammalian hosts (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). This phylogenetically widespread excess of recurrent adaptation suggests that many of the VIPs annotated in humans were also VIPs for a substantial evolutionary time in a wide range of mammals."

Note that adaptation of ANPEP has previously been detected in the context of oxidative stress in Cetaceans (<a href=\"#bib73\">Yim et al., 2014</a>). ANPEP is a cell-surface enzyme well known for its surprisingly wide range and diversity of functions (<a href=\"#bib48\">Mina-Osorio, 2008</a>). In particular, it is used by group I coronaviruses as a receptor, including the Human Coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) (<a href=\"#bib72\">Yeager et al., 1992</a>), Transmissible Gastroenteritis Virus (TGEV) (<a href=\"#bib12\">Delmas et al., 1992</a>), Feline Coronavirus (FCoV) (<a href=\"#bib10\">Tresnan and Holmes, 1998</a>), Canine Coronavirus (CCoV) (<a href=\"#bib68\">Tusell et al., 2007</a>), Porcine Respiratory Coronavirus (PRCV) (<a href=\"#bib13\">Delmas et al., 1993</a>) and Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus (PEDV) (<a href=\"#bib54\">Oh et al., 2003</a>). Reguera <i>et al.</i> (<a href=\"#bib60\">Reguera et al., 2012</a>) solved the structure of porcine ANPEP bound together with TGEV and PRCV. The authors identified in the extracellular domain of ANPEP 22 amino acids that form a surface of contact with TGEV and PRCV (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>) (<a href=\"#bib56\">Pettersen et al., 2004</a>). The most important component of this contact surface for host tropism is a N-glycosylation site at position 736 in porcine ANPEP (orthologous position 739 in human ANPEP) that forms hydrogen bonds with TGEV and PRCV (<a href=\"#bib68\">Tusell et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Reguera et al., 2012</a>). Deleting this site abolishes the ability of TGEV and PRCV to bind porcine ANPEP (<a href=\"#bib60\">Reguera et al., 2012</a>). Adding the glycosylation site in human ANPEP that natively lacks it transforms it into a receptor for TGEV and PRCV (<a href=\"#bib60\">Reguera et al., 2012</a>)."

This enrichment fades very rapidly as one gets further from the surface of contact with TGEV and PRCV, consistent with detected adaptation being related to interaction with coronaviruses, and not to a more diffuse, less specific enrichment within a wider segment of ANPEP (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7C</a>)."

N-glycosylation is governed by a three amino acids consensus, NX[ST], where X can be anything except proline (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bause, 1983</a>). The first and third positions in the consensus evolved adaptively in mammals (MEME <i>P</i>=0.005 for both). The ancestral states of the two positions shows that the mammalian ancestor had a fully functional consensus for N-glycosylation, and that the consensus was lost independently 11 times in mammals, either by modification of the first or third position (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). The consensus was regained only two times after loss (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). This suggests that the signals of adaptation detected at the first and third positions in the consensus mainly reflect parallel, adaptive losses of the N-glycosylation site in multiple mammalian lineages. Given the crucial role of this N-glycosylation site in the binding of TGEV, PRCV, FCoV and CCoV to ANPEP, it is probable that these parallel adaptive losses were due to selective pressure exerted by ancient coronaviruses."

Importantly, we find a substantial enrichment in strong signals of adaptation in VIPs with no known antiviral or other immune functions (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figures 4B</a> and <a href=\"#fig5\">5A</a>).

First, there likely to be many undiscovered VIPs. There is no sign that the pace of discovery of new VIPs is slowing down (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>). This means that a substantial number of proteins classified as non-VIPs in this analysis are in fact VIPs, making non-VIPs a conservative control. Second, adaptation in response to viruses is most likely not restricted to proteins that physically interact with viruses. For example, adaptation to viruses might happen in proteins that act downstream of VIPs in signaling cascades, or in non-coding sequences that regulate the expression of VIPs. Third, not all of the 1256 VIPs we use here have been consistently interacting with viruses during evolution. Most VIPs in the dataset (95%) were discovered in humans, and how frequently these VIPs have also been interacting with viruses in other mammals is currently unknown. Some VIPs like PKR have probably been in very frequent contact with diverse viruses. Conversely, other VIPs may have been in contact with viruses for a very limited evolutionary time in mammals, and only in a limited range of lineages. This would apply to VIPs that interact with viruses with a limited host range and few other phylogenetically closely related viruses, as is the case with HCV (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). In addition, we could only work with VIPs active in current human populations reflecting the set of viruses infecting humans at present. This means that a potentially large number of proteins classified as non-VIPs in our study were actually VIPs during past human evolution or during the evolution of other mammalian lineages. Altogether, the bias of our sample towards present human VIPs thus makes our results conservative."

The first automatic query was performed on the 24<sup>th</sup> of June 2013, and the last update was performed by automatically querying PUBMED again on the 10<sup>th</sup> of December 2014.

Titles of publications directly mentioning an interaction, or of publications reporting insights at the cellular/molecular biology level were retained for further inspection of their abstracts.

Those 24 mammals were those with high sequencing depth genomes as of December 2012. They include the assemblies hg19 for human, chimpanzee panTro4, gorilla gorGor3, orangutan ponAbe2, gibbon nomLeu3, macaque rheMac3, baboon papAnu2, marmoset calJac3, bushbaby otoGar3, mouse mm10, rat rn5, guinea pig cavPor3, squirrel speTri2, rabbit oryCun2, sheep oviAri3, cow bosTau7, pig susScr3, microbat myoLuc2, panda ailMel1, ferret musFur1, dog canFam3, cat felCat5, horse equCab2, and elephant loxAfr3. We first used Blat (<a href=\"#bib31\">Kent, 2002</a>) to find all the homologous matches of 22,074 human coding sequences (CDS) from Ensembl v69 (<a href=\"#bib21\">Flicek et al., 2012</a>) in all the assemblies listed above. These CDS are the longest CDS for their respective human genes. Blat was parameterized for high sensitivity, using translated genomes (options -q=dnax and -t=dnax), translated queries and setting the minimum identity to 50%, in addition to using the -fine option. Best Blat matches with the highest number of matching positions were then blatted back on the human genome to identify best reciprocal hits. This way we could find a total of 9861 human CDS with best reciprocal hits in all the other 23 species, no in-frame stop codon and at least 30% of the length of the human CDS (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1B</a>). Of these, 9338 human CDS were found to have clear conserved synteny in at least 18 of the 23 non-human species, with at least five conserved neighboring protein coding genes within 500 kb upstream their 5\u2019start and 500 kb downstream their 3\u2019 end (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1B</a>). The CDS of these 9338 orthologs were then aligned using PRANK under the codon evolution model (<a href=\"#bib38\">Loytynoja and Goldman, 2008</a>). Any codon present in less than eight species was discarded. The combination of Blat to extract the homologous sequences and PRANK to realign them ensures we work with high quality alignments. Indeed, the first step of local alignment with Blat excludes segments of the CDS that are too diverged between mammals to be properly aligned during the subsequent step of global alignment with PRANK, which has been shown to be the best coding sequence aligner available (<a href=\"#bib20\">Fletcher and Yang, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib28\">Jordan and Goldman, 2012</a>)."

For our study, DN and DS are the number of substitutions in the human lineage since divergence with chimpanzee. Theses substitutions are identified in human-chimpanzee-orangutan alignments of the mammalian orthologous CDS (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1E</a>). These alignments are prepared the same way as the alignments of 24 mammals (see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods, 'Multiple alignments of mammalian orthologs'), except for the fact that we include all isoforms of every ortholog in the analysis. The substitutions are those positions where chimpanzee and orangutan have the same nucleotide but human has a different nucleotide. We further require the substitution to be fixed in human, as shown by the fact that the position is not polymorphic in the 1000 Genomes Project data (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abecasis et al., 2012</a>). The measures of pN and pS are obtained as the numbers of polymorphic positions in African populations from the final phase I 1000 Genomes Project. For the classic MK test, we only use variants with a derived allele frequency between 0.1 and 0.9 in African populations in order to limit the effect of deleterious mutations. Note however that the classic MK test has been shown to underestimate <i>\u03b1</i> even when excluding low frequency variants. The classic MK test is thus well suited to measure the relative difference in adaptation between VIPs and non-VIPs, but it is not well suited to actually measure the true absolute <i>\u03b1</i> in VIPs and non-VIPs."

It is nevertheless limited to using large numbers of genes (&gt;1000). The asymptotic MK test is robust to the presence of deleterious mutations and to demography. The asymptotic MK test works by estimating <i>\u03b1</i> in bins of derived allele frequencies. For example, <i>\u03b1</i> can be calculated in the bin of frequencies from 0.1 to 0.2 by counting only variants with a derived allele frequency between 0.1 and 0.2 to measure pN and pS. An exponential curve is then fitted to the estimates of <i>\u03b1</i> across bins of frequency. The value taken by the fitted curve for a derived allele frequency of 100% provides the estimate for <i>\u03b1</i> (<a href=\"#bib43\">Messer and Petrov, 2013</a>). Using the asymptotic MK test, Messer and Petrov (<a href=\"#bib43\">Messer and Petrov, 2013</a>) estimated that <i>\u03b1</i> is 57% in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, and 13% in human. For both species, these estimates were obtained based on polymorphism and divergence data for most of the proteome (more than 10<sup>4</sup> protein coding sequences in both cases). Here, we need to estimate <i>\u03b1</i> in 1256 VIPs, and in the same number of randomly sampled non-VIPs. This is an order of magnitude less than the number of coding sequences used by Messer and Petrov (<a href=\"#bib43\">Messer and Petrov, 2013</a>), which makes curve fitting challenging. Indeed, the low number of high frequency variants means that estimates of <i>\u03b1</i> in the high frequency bins are very noisy. Using the stable release 1000 Genomes Project final phase I variants from African populations, we count that VIPs only have 143 non-synonymous and 343 synonymous variants with a derived allele frequency above 0.5, respectively. The [0.8,0.9] bin of frequency only has 18 non-synonymous and 51 synonymous variants. In comparison, the [0.1,0.2] bin has 149 non-synonymous and 370 synonymous variants. The [0.4,0.5] bin still has twice more variants (36 non-synonymous, 101 synonymous) than the [0.8,0.9] bin."

A second potential issue when trying to fit a curve to predict <i>\u03b1</i> in the asymptotic McDonald-Kreitman test is the mispolarization of alleles as ancestral or derived. Mispolarization is a common problem that distorts the unfolded Site Frequency Spectrum (SFS) (<a href=\"#bib26\">Hernandez et al., 2007</a>). The most severe distortion is usually within the high frequency part of the SFS (<a href=\"#bib26\">Hernandez et al., 2007</a>). Indeed, abundant low-frequency derived variants are often misidentified as high frequency derived variants. This can result in substantial overestimations of the number of high frequency variants. The number of non-synonymous variants pN might be more severely overestimated than pS, since less high frequency and more low frequency non-synonymous variants are expected in the first place. This could hypothetically result in underestimates of <i>\u03b1</i> within high frequency bins."

Each exon is separated by 4000 bp long introns. One in four coding sites is synonymous and only experiences neutral mutations. Non-synonymous sites experience neutral, advantageous, strongly deleterious and slightly deleterious mutations. The coding sequence evolves for 20,000 generations in a population of 1000 individuals, at a uniform mutation rate of 2.5\u00a0x\u00a010<sup>\u22127</sup> and with a uniform recombination rate of 10 cM/Mb. These parameters are equivalent to 200,000 generations of evolution of a 10,000 individuals population with a mutation rate of 2.5\u00a0x\u00a010<sup>\u22128</sup> and a recombination rate of 1 cM/Mb. This results roughly in the amount of divergence observed in the human lineage since divergence with chimpanzee. The rescaling by a factor of ten greatly speeds up the simulations. Roughly matching the observed DN, DS, pN and pS in VIPs requires simulating 1000 coding sequences. The true <i>\u03b1</i> obtained from simply counting adaptive fixations in the simulations can then be compared with the <i>\u03b1</i> estimated from DN, DS, pN and pS. By repeating the simulation of sets of 1000 coding sequences many times, we can get the variance of the estimation of <i>\u03b1</i> both by the modified asymptotic MK test. By repeating the simulations 100 times, we show that the modified asymptotic MK test gives accurate estimates of <i>\u03b1</i> for all evolutionary scenarios tested (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1G</a>). In practice, the logarithmic fit is easier to use than the exponential fit. Indeed, fitting algorithms such as the ones implemented in the LM() function or the nlsLM() function from the minpack.lm package in R often fail to converge for the exponential fit. We therefore use the logarithmic fit."

Although site tests are well suited for cases where there is a strong <i>a priori</i> expectation about which sites should evolve adaptively, as is for example the case of TFRC, here we have no a priori knowledge about the sites that are expected to evolve adaptively in VIPs in response to viruses.

The two tests are both likelihood ratio tests that compare a model integrating positive selection with a neutral model without positive selection. The PAML branch-site test and the HYPHY BS-REL branch-site test differ mainly in the assumptions of their evolutionary models. The PAML branch-site test defines two kinds of branches in the phylogenetic tree used, the foreground and background branches. The foreground branch is the branch where the presence of positive selection is tested. The evolutionary model of the branch-site test authorizes positive selection in the foreground branch, but not in the background branch. Unlike the PAML branch-site test, the HYPHY BS-REL test uses a model that has no limitation regarding the occurrence of adaptation across the tree. This difference in the models used has very profound consequences for the ability of the two tests to detect and quantify recurrent adaptation (<a href=\"#bib35\">Kosakovsky Pond et al., 2011</a>). Indeed, the HYPHY test has good power to detect recurrent adaptation. Because it does not allow adaptation in the background branches, the PAML tests suffers a severe loss of statistical power when recurrent adaptation does occur in the background branches. As an example, the HYPHY BS-REL test detects significant (BS-REL test p\u22640.05) signals of adaptation in 18 branches of the mammalian tree used in this study for PKR (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>). In comparison, the PAML test detects only nine branches (PAML test p\u22640.05). This is a crucial difference between the two tests in our case given that the arms race with viruses is likely to trigger recurrent bursts of adaptation across mammals. For this reason we use HYPHY BS-REL to quantify adaptation in mammals. More specifically, we use the proportion of selected codons estimated by the BS-REL test to quantify adaptation. To estimate the strength of the evidence in favor of adaptation across the entire mammalian tree, we use the <i>P</i>-value of the BUSTED test in HYPHY that uses the same codon evolution model as the BS-REL test."

We start by computing the average proportion of codons under adaptive evolution for VIPs and the same average proportion for the sets of randomly matched non-VIPs (see the description of the permutation test). For each coding sequence, we retrieve the proportion of positively selected codons on each branch, and compute the average of this proportion across branches. More specifically, we only count branches of the tree with conserved synteny (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1B</a>). That is, if 40 of the 44 branches of the tree have conserved synteny (see above), we compute the average proportion of selected codons only from these 40 branches. In practice we tolerate only up to five branches in the tree with no conserved synteny (at least 39 branches with conserved synteny; <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 3</a>). This reduces the dataset of orthologs that can be used in the analysis only slightly, from 9861 to 9338 total, and among those the number of VIPs from 1256 to 1193. Then adaptation is simply quantified as the average proportions of selected codons in valid branches across VIPs (or the same number of matched non-VIPs). If the threshold for BUSTED <i>P</i>-value is set to 10<sup>\u2212x</sup>, we only include in the quantification the average proportions of selected codons from coding sequences with BUSTED <i>P</i>-value\u226410<sup>\u2212x</sup>. For a low x, we compare how much selection occurred in VIPs and non-VIPs counting both weak and strong signals of adaptation. For a high x, we compare how much strong, highly significant signals of adaptation occurred in VIPs compared to non-VIPs."

The amount of purifying selection in a protein corresponds to the proportion of amino acids that cannot change, or very infrequently during evolution. On average VIPs experience much more purifying selection than non-VIPs. This means that mechanically, a smaller proportion of amino acids can possibly be targeted by adaptive evolution in VIPs. A na\u00efve comparison of VIPs and non-VIPs would therefore tell more about the difference in purifying selection than about the difference in the amount of adaptation. Instead, the idea is to compare adaptation in the 1256 VIPs with adaptation in 1256 non-VIPs with the same overall average and variance in levels of purifying selection. The sampling of non-VIPs with similar purifying selection VIPs is however challenging."

The ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitution rates dN/dS is often used as a measure of purifying selection. How much smaller dN is compared to dS can indeed tell how evolutionarily constrained a protein is. However the problem with dN/dS is that dN not only reflects purifying selection, but also reflects adaptive amino acid substitutions. This means that comparing VIPs with non-VIPs with similar dN/dS ratios would underestimate an excess of adaptation in VIPs. This is because more adaptation would increase dN/dS in VIPs more than it does in non-VIPs (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>; compare VIP with non-VIP I). As a result, VIPs would be matched with either non-VIPs that have the same dN/dS because they have the same levels of both purifying selection and adaptation (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>; compare VIP with non-VIP II), or non-VIPs that have the same dN/dS because they have experienced less purifying selection, and thus have also had more codons available for adaptation to happen (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>; compare VIP with non-VIP III), or non-VIPs that have the same dN/dS because they are under both stronger purifying selection and adaptation (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>; compare VIP with non-VIP IV). In all three cases, non-VIPs selected as controls would experience more adaptation than non-VIPs that would have been matched based on a more accurate measure of purifying selection (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>; compare non-VIP I with non-VIPs II, III and IV).

Indeed, pN is decreased by purifying selection, but is not affected by adaptive mutations that segregate for very short times in populations.

Good estimates of pN/pS require sequencing the genomes of a sufficient number of non-inbred individuals, ideally more than ten, within a given species. The pN/pS ratio is publicly available, based on the genome sequences of a sufficient number of individuals, in human (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abecasis et al., 2012</a>) and the non-human primate species represented in the Great Ape Genome Project, namely chimpanzee, gorilla and orangutan (<a href=\"#bib58\">Prado-Martinez et al., 2013</a>). The limited number of species of the mammalian tree with pN/pS information can still be used as a control of purifying selection in the permutation test for all mammals. It is true that the pN/pS ratio within a species or a subset of species does not represent the absolute, overall level of purifying selection in the entire mammalian tree. It is known for instance that primates experience weaker purifying selection than rodents. What matters however for the permutation test is not the absolute level of purifying selection, but the relative difference in pN/pS between VIPs and non-VIPs. Indeed, VIPs and matched non-VIPs with similar pN/pS experience similar purifying selection, even if pN/pS is from a subset of species in the mammalian tree. Whether pN/pS is overall skewed towards higher or towards lower values in the subset of species used, then the skew is still the same for both VIPs and non-VIPs. This means that the relative difference in pN/pS is still a good measure of the general difference in purifying selection across mammals. A different skew in VIPs and non-VIPs requires invoking unlikely scenarios where VIPs would experience a global relaxation or intensification of constraint specifically in the primate species where pN/pS is available. Given the high number of VIPs and their high functional diversity (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1C</a>), such a global trend towards relaxation or higher constraint in primates is extremely unlikely. The pN/pS ratio from primate species can therefore be used as a control for purifying selection."

These populations are the populations included in the Great Apes Genome Project with the highest effective population sizes. Indeed, the pN/pS ratio is less noisy and available for more proteins in populations with higher population sizes and higher genetic diversity. For each VIP and non-VIP, the value of pN/pS used in the permutation test is simply the sum of pN across all the primate populations divided by the sum of pS across the same populations (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1F</a>).

At any time in a population of primates, only few positions are polymorphic within a typical (~300 codons) coding sequence. As a consequence, a highly constrained coding sequence may by chance have more non-synonymous variants than synonymous variants, and a high pN/pS ratio. Conversely, a weakly constrained coding sequence may by chance have less non-synonymous variants, and a low pN/pS ratio. This is problematic if we want to use pN/pS as a control for purifying selection. One can consider the case of VIPs where pN/pS is substantially lower than in non-VIPs. Matching VIPs with non-VIPs with a similarly lower pN/pS, we would end up selecting non-VIPs with a lower pN/pS not because of purifying selection but merely because of noise. This makes controlling for purifying selection less straightforward than directly matching each individual VIP with non-VIPs with similar pN/pS ratios. Instead we use an indirect matching strategy."

In particular, we use PAML to estimate dN and dS under the M8 evolution model (<a href=\"#bib71\">Yang, 2007</a>). The dN/dS ratio for the whole mammalian tree (<a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplementary file 1B</a>) integrates hundreds of millions of years of evolution. In the absence of adaptation, it would therefore be a much less noisy measure of purifying selection than pN/pS. The issue is however that dN is influenced by both purifying selection and by adaptation. If VIPs experience more adaptation than non-VIPs, then purifying selection being equal, we expect dN/dS to be higher in VIPs than in non-VIPs.

The smaller difference in dN/dS than pN/pS is an indication that adaptation has increased dN more strongly in VIPs than in non-VIPs. Purifying selection being equal, dN/dS is therefore higher in VIPs than in non-VIPs. This means that non-VIPs with the same pN/pS (purifying selection) as VIPs have a lower dN/dS. We can therefore match VIPs and non-VIPs with the same pN/pS by selecting non-VIPs with a dN/dS ratio that is only a fraction of the dN/dS in VIPs. This fraction can be adjusted through trial and error until finding the one that matches VIPs with non-VIPs with the same overall average pN/pS. This indirect matching strategy makes it possible to compare VIPs and non-VIPs with the same level of purifying selection while avoiding the pitfall of noise in pN/pS."

There is no combination of <i>a</i> and X where both the average and variance of pN/pS are identical in VIPs and the sampled non-VIPs. The combination of <i>a</i>=0.7 and X=3 gives the closest matching variances and a slightly higher pN/pS (lower purifying selection, see above for numbers) in non-VIPs than in VIPs. Other combinations give closer averages of pN/pS, but more distant variances. To be conservative, we thus choose to use <i>a</i>=0.7 and X=3. The fact that the sampled non-VIPs experience slightly less purifying selection than VIPs makes the comparison conservative (the less purifying selection in non-VIPs compared to non-VIPs, the more opportunities there were for adaptation to happen at positions of coding sequences that can change).
