Previously, we showed that the temporal dependence of MSI in the optic tectum of <i>Xenopus laevis</i> tadpoles is mediated by the network dynamics of the recruitment of local inhibition by sensory input (Felch et al., 2016). This was one of the first cellular-level mechanisms described for MSI. Here, we expand this cellular level view of MSI by focusing on the principle of inverse effectiveness, another central feature of MSI stating that the amount of multisensory enhancement observed inversely depends on the size of unisensory responses. We show that non-linear summation of crossmodal synaptic responses, mediated by NMDA-type glutamate receptor (NMDARs) activation, form the cellular basis for inverse effectiveness, both at the cellular and behavioral levels."

Previously, we showed that the temporal dependence of MSI in the optic tectum of <i>Xenopus laevis</i> tadpoles is mediated by the network dynamics of the recruitment of local inhibition by sensory input (Felch et al., 2016). This was one of the first cellular-level mechanisms described for MSI. Here, we expand this cellular level view of MSI by focusing on the principle of inverse effectiveness, another central feature of MSI stating that the amount of multisensory enhancement observed inversely depends on the size of unisensory responses. We show that non-linear summation of crossmodal synaptic responses, mediated by NMDA-type glutamate receptor (NMDARs) activation, form the cellular basis for inverse effectiveness, both at the cellular and behavioral levels."

The phenomenological aspects of inverse effectiveness and other properties of MSI are well described in the vertebrate optic tectum or superior colliculus (<a href=\"#bib18\">Stein and Stanford, 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Stein et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Meredith and Stein, 1983</a>, <a href=\"#bib11\">1986</a>), but less is known about the cellular mechanisms underlying these processes or how these responses give rise to behavior (<a href=\"#bib16\">Stein et al., 1988</a>, <a href=\"#bib17\">1989</a>). While several cellular models have been put forth to explain inverse effectiveness (<a href=\"#bib3\">Cuppini et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Ursino et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Stein et al., 2009</a>), one stumbling block toward testing these has been the lack of a robust, experimentally tractable model system that is easily assessable at multiple levels of analysis, from synapses to behavior. The <i>Xenopus laevis</i> tadpole optic tectum has emerged as a preparation in which we can study MSI at the single cell, network and behavioral levels (<a href=\"#bib4\">Deeg et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Felch et al., 2016</a>). The optic tectum receives synaptic input from multiple sensory modalities, particularly visual, auditory and mechanosensory projections and shows strong MSI with properties homologous to those observed in the mammalian superior colliculus (<a href=\"#bib4\">Deeg et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Hiramoto and Cline, 2009</a>)."

Critically, these findings show that inhibition is required for the development of the temporal properties of MSI in single cells. However, this study left several open questions, including whether other properties of MSI, such as inverse effectiveness, are also also present in this system; and whether MSI measured in single tectal neurons also reflects MSI in vivo and in a behaving animal. The present study extends our previous findings by directly addressing these questions. Specifically, we focused on whether inverse effectiveness is also a property of MSI in the tectum as assessed by multiple levels of analysis. We use this integrated preparation to examine the behavioral, network and cellular mechanisms underlying inverse effectiveness."

Here, we first tested whether MSI was also present in tadpole behavioral responses, and whether this behavior was consistent with inverse effectiveness. In <i>Xenopus</i> tadpoles, visually guided behavior and acoustically driven startles are well characterized, and ideal for testing MSI (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib9\">Khakhalin et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">James et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Truszkowski et al., 2016</a>).

Visual stimuli were paired with an acoustic prestimulus that by itself does not evoke a startle response. Pairing the visual stimulus with a subthreshold acoustic prestimulus enhanced the change in speed only when paired with low-contrast visual stimuli and not with high-contrast stimuli (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>, Multisensory: 0%: 3.22\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.27, p&gt;0.9999; 25%: 5.19\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.62 cm/s, p=0.0013; 50%: 3.88\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.51 cm/s, p=0.9948; 100%: 4.03\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.34, p=0.4994, two way ANOVA). We also quantified this difference as a Multisensory Index [MSIn = (paired response \u2013 visual response) / visual response]. At 25% and 50% contrast, the MSIn was significantly different from the unisensory or 0% stimulus, but not for 100% contrast (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>, MSIn: 0%: 0.018\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.05; 25%: 0.92\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.244, p=0.002; 50%: 0.68\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.25, p=0.0345; 100%: 0.28\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.18, p=0.3981; two-way ANOVA).

We used tectum-wide calcium imaging to observe network responses to paired sub-maximal visual and mechanosensory stimuli, in vivo. Tectal cells were bulk-labeled with Oregon Green BAPTA 1 (OGB1-AM) to measure responses from up to 170 tectal cells simultaneously (<a href=\"#bib25\">Xu et al., 2011</a>). Visual stimuli were presented via an optic fiber 400\u2013600 \u03bcM from the eye and skin-based sensory (presumed mechanosensory) stimuli were presented via a bipolar stimulating electrode on the skin in the lip area. Recordings were obtained from the contralateral optic tectum. Each cell was assigned a primary modality (visual, mechanosensory or multisensory) based on its largest average peak response (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>). In the representative example shown, 51% of cells are primarily multisensory, 28% are mechanosensory and 13% are visual. Nine\u00a0percent\u00a0do not respond to any stimulus. Larger circles represent proportionally larger responses. Example responses from individual regions of interest (ROI) representing single cells are shown (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>). Combining data from 11 tadpoles with 35\u2013170 ROIs each (1041 ROI total; 231 with average peak response to at least one stimulus greater than \u0394F\u00a0=\u00a00.1), we calculated the average peak response across each modality and the MSIn. Our data shows that inverse effectiveness is met across the population of tectal cells, with cells having small unisensory responses showing the greatest amount of multisensory enhancement (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). Because inverse effectiveness was observed across a network of cells in response to a single stimulus of a given strength, these data provide direct experimental evidence supporting the definition of inverse effectiveness as a function of an individual cell\u2019s response size to a stimulus, rather than a function of stimulus strength."

To better understand how cellular properties can give rise to the network and behavioral responses observed above, we performed a series of single-cell recordings. Previously, we found that inhibition is crucial for developing the temporal properties of MSI. Inverse effectiveness could also be explained by enhanced recruitment of local inhibition by increasingly large unisensory stimuli. Using an ex vivo preparation (see Materias\u00a0and\u00a0methods [<a href=\"#bib6\">Felch et al., 2016</a>]) to independently stimulate each modality with precise control of stimulus magnitude and timing, we examined the relationship between inverse effectiveness and inhibition. We found that inverse effectiveness is not altered by blocking GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, 100 \u00b5M PTX). Although in the presence of GABA blockers, the response curve is shifted to greater unisensory and multisensory responses, smaller unisensory responses are still associated with larger multisensory enhancement, and thus inverse effectiveness is still present."

We observed that tectal cells exhibiting suprathreshold unisensory responses showed no multisensory enhancement resulting from crossmodal stimulus pairs.

For example, individual small synaptic inputs alone may not be sufficiently strong to recruit NMDAR, but paired inputs will, and thus result in a response greater than the sum of the individual inputs (<a href=\"#bib13\">Polsky et al., 2004</a>). To test whether NMDA receptor activation could explain the supralinear integration of subthreshold crossmodal input pairs in the tectum, we compared the arithmetic linear sum of both unisensory responses to subthreshold stimuli, to the actual combined multisensory response. This was then used to calculate the MSIn (see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). We observed that in NMDAR-blocked cells, multisensory enhancement diminishes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,D</a>: Sub-threshold control MSIn\u00a0=\u00a04.34\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.18, n\u00a0=\u00a06; Sub-threshold NMDAR-block MSIn\u00a0=\u00a01.11\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.43, n\u00a0=\u00a010; p=0.016; Mann Whitney U\u00a0=\u00a08), and the multisensory response is closer to the linear sum of the individual responses (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>). To compare how this effect in whole-cell responses relates to the output of the cell, we used cell-attached recordings to measure spike output with and without NMDARs blocked. As with whole-cell responses, lower intensity unisensory spike outputs in the presence of NMDAR-blockers do not elicit multisensory enhancement as observed in control conditions (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3F,G</a>: Control n\u00a0=\u00a033, NMDAR-Block n\u00a0=\u00a011)."

These non-linear responses are mediated via NMDAR activation by co-incident subthreshold inputs. These data are the first to explicitly show the cellular mechanisms underlying inverse effectiveness in the vertebrate brain and may suggest a broader role for NMDARs in sensory perception."

In the majority of experiments, this cycle consisted of: acoustic stimulus, low-contrast visual stimulus, acoustic stimulus and low-contrast visual stimuli combined, high-contrast visual stimulus, and acoustic stimulus combined with high-contrast visual stimulus. In some experiments, only low-contrast visual and multisensory stimuli were used. The acoustic stimulus consisted of one 10 ms pulse of a 100 Hz sawtooth buzz that was delivered to right and left speakers with inverted phases, to enable efficient sound and vibration transfer. The acoustic volume was calibrated to be just below the threshold for current batch of tadpoles (typically 7\u201310% of maximal volume). The visual stimulus consisted of a checkerboard pattern of light gray squares shown against a dark gray background, with 24 rows, each 6 mm wide, and light to dark gray contrast of either 10% (low), or 30% (high). The checkerboard pattern was not presented at once, but each light gray square within the pattern expanded over the course of 500 ms in such a way that one corner of each square stayed in place, while the opposite corner linearly translated to its final position. The direction of expansion was randomized between the trials. As this visual stimulus is not instantaneous, for multisensory presentations we was always started it 100 ms before the onset of the acoustic stimulus. The tadpoles were recorded from above using an HD USB video camera (C310, Logitech, Newark, CA); 30 s periods between stimuli were then automatically excised (Python script, courtesy of Alexander Hamme, Bard College), and startle responses were identified manually. The total number of stimuli delivered for each tadpole was either 25 (for experiments with five types of stimuli), or 30 (for experiments with three types of stimuli). Tadpoles that did not respond to any of the 25\u201330 stimuli were excluded from analysis."

Standard analysis of variance is appropriate because sample sizes are sufficiently large and raw data (the number of positive responses out of either 5 or 10 presentations) is distributed binomially. There was no randomization of stimuli as the stimuli were provided cyclically (see above). Control and pharmacological condition experiments were run in different months (but otherwise equivalent batches of animals), and so were not randomized. The scoring criteria were formalized as a presence of a C-turn followed by a rapid acceleration. These behaviors are sufficiently robust to allow for unambiguous and internally consistent scoring. Trials were also independently scored by a second observer, cross-validating our scoring criteria. Means and 95% confidence levels are reported."

Dissection was completed in external solution (115 mM NaCl, 4 mM KCl, 5 mM HEPES, 10 \u00b5M glycine, 10 mM glucose). Dissection consisted of opening the skin above the brain, separating the two tecta and laying the contralateral tectum flat. Then, the ventricular membrane was removed from the recording area and 4 mM Oregon Green Bapta 1 (OGB1, Molecular Probes (Waltham, MA) cat # 06807) dye in 4% F-127 detergent was added and incubated in the dark for 1 hr (<a href=\"#bib25\">Xu et al., 2011</a>). External media was changed with three intermediate rinses to remove excess dye, and then recording proceeded for 1\u20133 hr based on the health of the tadpole. Recordings were completed using an ANDOR 860 EM-CCD camera at 60x and NIS-elements software. Images were taken using 2 \u00d7 2 binning for an image size of 500 \u00d7 502 pixels, corresponding to 1130 \u03bcM x 1135 \u03bcM and 22.8 frames per second. Trials were presented in blocks of three presentations of four stimuli conditions (multisensory, visual, electrical stimulation of the skin (mechanosensory) and no stimulus), with each trial being 7 s long, with a 5 s pre-stimulus light stabilization time period and a 30 s start to start interval. Rest periods of at least 2 min were observed between trial blocks. The skin stimulation protocol is treated as functionally equivalent to presentation of acoustic stimuli (ie. non-visual) and so was used for convenience in order to minimize mechanical movement of the preparation induced by the stimulus during Ca++ imaging. Each tadpole generated 5\u201314 blocks of trials from 1\u20133 planes of focus for a total of 15\u2013170 regions of interest per tadpole."

ROIs were hand selected and mean fluorescence of each ROI and its corresponding neuropil in each frame was extracted. The mean fluorescence was processed (custom Matlab code, TLST) to first remove background signal and account for bleaching, then neuropil was subtracted (<a href=\"#bib2\">Chen et al., 2013</a>). The mean of the prestimulus period in each trial was used to calculate the change in fluorescence over time, and peak measurements were taken from these \u0394F/F<sub>0</sub> traces. Peak was calculated as the mean of the three data points around the absolute peak. The mean of the peak for all traces of a given condition for a given ROI were used to calculate primary modality and multisensory index (MSIn = (multisensory \u2013 unisensory) / unisensory). Cells with average ROI \u0394F/F<sub>o</sub> peak values less than 0.1 for all three conditions\u2014visual, mechanosensory and multisensory\u2014were excluded from analysis."

In brief, tadpoles were anesthetized in MS-222 and then transferred to a HEPES-buffered extracellular saline solution (external solution). This solution contains (in mM) 115 NaCl, 2-4KCl, 3 CaCl2, 3 MgCl2, 5 HEPES, 10 glucose, and 0.1 picrotoxin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). The solution was maintained at pH 7.2 and 255 mosM. For NMDAR-block experiments, 50 mM of D-(-)\u22122-Amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (AP5; Sigma) was added. In this external solution, we dissected the tadpole to expose the ventral surface of the optic tectum. This was accomplished by slicing through the dorsal aspect of the tadpole, penetrating first the pigmented skin and afterwards the dorsal brain through the midline. This process involveed cutting the membrane commissures and excising connective nerve fibers. The whole-brain preparation was then pinned to a submerged silicone elastomer (Sylgard, Dow Corning, Midland, MI) block in a custom-made recording rig. Broken micropipettes were used to suction and remove the ventricular membrane overlying tectal cells. These tectal cells were resolved using a Nikon E600 FN light microscope (Tokyo) with a 60x fluorescent water-immersion objective. Synaptic responses were evoked using bipolar stimulating electrodes placed in the optic chiasm (visual) and the contralateral hindbrain (non-visual/mechanosensory). These stimuli represented a reduced version of the skin stimulation and acoustic stimuli presented in the behavior and calcium imaging experiments, but allow specific control of intensity. A 0.02 ms electrical shock was administered to each modality at various stimulus intensities to elicit a tectal response that was collected via either whole-cell patch clamp or cell-attached recording techniques. Multisensory stimuli were presented at a 50 ms offset interval. Stimulus intensity was set so as to evoke a monosynaptic tectal cell response with minimal confounding polysynaptic activity. Whole-cell and loose-cell attached recordings were performed using glass micropipettes (6\u201315 M\u03a9) filled with K<sup>+</sup>-gluconate intracellular saline [in mM: 100 K<sup>+</sup>-gluconate, 8 KCl, 5 NaCl, 1.5 MgCl2, 20 HEPES, 10 EGTA, 2 ATP, and 0.3 GTP, pH 7.2 (osmolarity 255 mOsm)]. Voltage-clamp mode was used to isolate synaptic conductances mediated by optic chiasm projections and hindbrain projections, but recordings were collected in current clamp conditions. Loose-cell attached recordings were used to measure action potentials without breaking through the cell membrane and without electrical access, and were defined as having seal resistances in the 40\u2013200 M\u03a9 range."

Responses were quantified by measuring the area under the voltage traces. Trials in which both modalities elicited areas each less than 12 pA/ms over the 1.5 s interval following the stimulus were labeled as \u2018Sub-threshold,' and trials in which either modality elicited a current area greater than 12 pA/ms over the 1.5 s interval following the stimulus were labeled as \u2018Supra-threshold.\u2019 Due to the limited sample size, non-parametric Mann-Whitney U-tests were performed using GraphPad Prism software to measure statistical significance.

The authors use behavior, electrophysiological recordings and calcium imaging to examine the mechanisms underlying inverse effectiveness. They demonstrate that pairing auditory startle stimulus with weak visual input produces a stronger behavioral output (change in swim speed) that pairing the auditory input with weak stimulus, indicative of multisensory integration. They use calcium imaging to characterize neurons that are multisensory and show inverse effectiveness. They show that inverse effectiveness is not blocked by picrotoxin but is blocked by NMDA R. This study is beautifully conducted, and provides important cellular level resolution of the mechanisms underlying an important aspect of multisensory integration.

The authors use behavior, electrophysiological recordings and calcium imaging to examine the mechanisms underlying inverse effectiveness. They demonstrate that pairing auditory startle stimulus with weak visual input produces a stronger behavioral output (change in swim speed) that pairing the auditory input with weak stimulus, indicative of multisensory integration. They use calcium imaging to characterize neurons that are multisensory and show inverse effectiveness. They show that inverse effectiveness is not blocked by picrotoxin but is blocked by NMDA R. This study is beautifully conducted, and provides important cellular level resolution of the mechanisms underlying an important aspect of multisensory integration.
