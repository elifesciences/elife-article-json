However, the relationship between the perceived value of a reward, the latent value of a reward, and the behavioral response remains unclear. Here we report that, given a choice between two sweet and chemically similar sugars\u2014L- and D-arabinose\u2014<i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> prefers D- over L- arabinose, but forms long-term memories of L-arabinose more reliably. Behavioral assays indicate that L-arabinose-generated memories require sugar receptor Gr43a, and calcium imaging and electrophysiological recordings indicate that L- and D-arabinose differentially activate Gr43a-expressing neurons. We posit that the immediate valence of a reward is not always predictive of the long-term reinforcement value of that reward, and that a subset of sugar-sensing neurons may generate distinct representations of similar sugars, allowing for rapid assessment of the salient features of various sugar rewards and generation of reward-specific behaviors. However, how sensory neurons communicate information about L-arabinose quality and concentration\u2014features relevant for long-term memory\u2014remains unknown."

However, the relationship between the perceived value of a reward, the latent value of a reward, and the behavioral response remains unclear. Here we report that, given a choice between two sweet and chemically similar sugars\u2014L- and D-arabinose\u2014<i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> prefers D- over L- arabinose, but forms long-term memories of L-arabinose more reliably. Behavioral assays indicate that L-arabinose-generated memories require sugar receptor Gr43a, and calcium imaging and electrophysiological recordings indicate that L- and D-arabinose differentially activate Gr43a-expressing neurons. We posit that the immediate valence of a reward is not always predictive of the long-term reinforcement value of that reward, and that a subset of sugar-sensing neurons may generate distinct representations of similar sugars, allowing for rapid assessment of the salient features of various sugar rewards and generation of reward-specific behaviors. However, how sensory neurons communicate information about L-arabinose quality and concentration\u2014features relevant for long-term memory\u2014remains unknown."

These neurons enable flies to associate features of their environment \u2013 such as odors \u2013 with the presence of this one particular sugar. Such memories may help the flies to find a similar food source again in the future. Artificially activating these neurons is also sufficient to trigger the formation of a memory, even in the absence of L-arabinose itself."

Food is also a complex reward. Having evolved in distinct ecological niches, different species of <i>Drosophila</i> display distinct food preferences and discriminate between potential sources of nutrition (<a href=\"#bib18\">Dethier, 1976</a>). For example, while some species of <i>Drosophila</i> prefer rotting fruits, others prefer mushrooms, cacti, or hibiscus flowers (<a href=\"#bib43\">Markow and O'Grady, 2005</a>). Identifying and remembering relevant food, therefore, is essential for survival. Moreover, food is often not a single substance but a mixture of various compounds, and not all are equally rewarding: rotting fruits contain various sugars, alcohols, and acids that produce varying responses (<a href=\"#bib73\">Yarmolinsky et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Charlu et al., 2013</a>). Food in natural contexts is also always part of an environment filled with other features, including predators, and therefore quick evaluation of potential food sources requires simultaneous processing of multiple stimuli. Finally, the attraction to food, and memories of it, are influenced by the internal state of the organism, such as whether the animal is hungry or satiated (<a href=\"#bib16\">Colomb et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Krashes et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Toshima and Tanimura, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Dethier, 1976</a>). It is therefore likely that contingent on their internal state, animals use certain components of food sources to quickly recognize those that are appropriate for feeding and, if worthwhile, to form memories of these sources for future visits. How these different aspects of food very quickly generate appropriate memories that guide future food-seeking behavior, however, remains unclear."

This would predict that the more appealing (or palatable) a sugar is, the better it will be remembered. Another possibility is that certain components of food can reinforce memory relatively independent of the food\u2019s immediate appeal, because they indicate specific attributes of the food (e.g. nutritional content) that are of long-term relevance. In a complex environment, where an animal needs to process multiple stimuli simultaneously, such processing may ensure that regardless of the immediate response, stimuli of long-term relevance will be remembered."

A specific illustration of this phenomenon is seen with the two chemically similar sugars, D- and L-arabinose: flies greatly prefer D-arabinose to L-arabinose, but better remember an odor paired with L-arabinose than with D-arabinose. We have also begun to explore how an animal assesses whether an experience that is rewarding in the moment is also of long-term relevance. Many studies have characterized higher\u00a0order systems, particularly the\u00a0neuromodulatory systems such as dopaminergic (<a href=\"#bib56\">Schwaerzel et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Huetteroth et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Berry et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Liu et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Yamagata et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Musso et al., 2015</a>), octopaminergic (<a href=\"#bib9\">Burke et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Schwaerzel et al., 2003</a>), neuropeptide\u00a0F (<a href=\"#bib38\">Krashes et al., 2009</a>) and mushroom body neurons (<a href=\"#bib3\">Aso et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Kirkhart and Scott, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib66\">Vogt et al., 2014</a>) underlying long-term sugar reward memory in <i>Drosophila.</i> How various sugars differentially engage the higher\u00a0order reward system, however, remains unclear. We find that D- and L-arabinose differentially activate the same peripheral Gr43a-expressing neurons, and that\u00a0activating Gr43a in some but not all manners can substitute for\u00a0the sugar reward, indicating that sensory neurons can at least partially mediate this discrimination process. However, the exact mechanism by which these sensory neurons communicate the relevant features of L-arabinose to higher\u00a0order systems remains unclear at this stage."

In this paradigm, hungry flies are trained for 2\u00a0min\u00a0to associate an odor with a rewarding sweet sugar; trained flies subsequently seek out the sugar-associated odor for several days afterwards, indicating that they have formed an associative memory (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). We have used this paradigm for three reasons: one, it is an ethologically relevant behavior; two, both the internal state (hunger) of the fly and characteristics of the sugar dictate the duration of memory (<a href=\"#bib10\">Burke and Waddell, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Fujita and Tanimura, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Colomb et al., 2009</a>); and three, salient features of the sugar are evaluated rapidly within the 2-min training as reported by others (<a href=\"#bib10\">Burke and Waddell, 2011</a>) and similarly confirmed by us (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A and B</a>)."

But L-arabinose bought from different sources generated similar survival curves and memory scores (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). The L-arabinose memory is also not due to particular wild-type flies used in the experiment (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>), the training conditions or the particular experimenter (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2C</a>). Neither arabinogalactan (a polymer of L-arabinose and galactose) nor the natural L-sugar rhamnose, produce significant memory, indicating that not all L-arabinose-containing components of fruits\u2019 cell wall or natural L-sugars are conducive to memory formation (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2D</a>). Bacteria are known to utilize L-arabinose (<a href=\"#bib67\">Watanabe et al., 2006</a>), but the flies\u2019 resident bacteria had no evident contribution to L-arabinose memory, since giving the flies a cocktail of antibiotics for the 2 days prior to behavioral training had no effect on L-arabinose memory (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2E</a>).

However, the preference for D-arabinose (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>) persisted when the sugars\u2019 concentrations were both reduced 100-fold (10 mM), and began to shift only when the concentration of D-arabinose was reduced to less than a third of L-arabinose (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3A</a>). A similar difference between D- and L-arabinose has also been reported in the blowfly <i>Phormia regina</i>, where the taste threshold for D-arabinose is reported to be five times lower than that of L-arabinose (<a href=\"#bib31\">Hassett et al., 1950</a>). When we measured consumption by Capillary Feeder (CAF\u00c9) assays over a concentration range (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3B</a>) or by mixing radioactive [32]P in the food in fixed concentration (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3C</a>), the flies consumed more D- than L-arabinose. Over time, however, flies consumed less D-and L-arabinose than nutritious sugars (data not shown), consistent with other studies (<a href=\"#bib21\">Dus et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Stafford et al., 2012</a>), and consumption reached a plateau in\u00a0~14 min for D- and\u00a0~30 min for L. We also monitored by video the behavior of single flies as they fed on colorless D- and L-arabinose solutions (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3D</a>) and observed that they spend much more time on D-arabinose than L-arabinose, consistent with higher overall consumption. These differences are not due to differences in mere detection of D- and L- arabinose: detection rates were very similar at high concentrations and began to differ only when concentrations were dropped to\u00a0\u226450 mM (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Likewise, the ability of L-arabinose to generate long-lasting memory persisted even at a 10-fold lower concentration, albeit with much weaker efficacy (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). Moreover, lowering D-arabinose concentration, where the flies still detect D-arabinose but consume less of it, there was no increase in memory (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3E</a>) ruling out the possibility that consuming too much non-nutritious sugar, such as D-arabinose, is somehow a negative reinforcement."

Curiously, PER response was similar between D- and L-arabinose over a concentration range (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4A</a>), consistent with other reports that PER depends more on the intensity than chemical nature of the sugar (<a href=\"#bib44\">Masek and Scott, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Stafford et al., 2012</a>). However, mere detection and acceptance of the sugar is not sufficient for long-term memory: A choice test between water and various concentrations of sucrose (a potent inducer of long-term memory) showed that there was no difference in the likelihood of consumption between 1\u00a0M and 10 mM sucrose; only when sucrose concentration is reduced to 1 mM did detection begin to fall (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4B</a>). However, only sucrose concentrations\u00a0\u2265\u00a0100 mM reliably produced robust long-term memory (<a href=\"#fig2s4\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4C</a>). Therefore, various sugar-associated behavioral responses, such as detection, acceptance, and assessment of immediate and long-term relevance are not a single process and are likely dictated by various attributes of the sugar. Taken together, these results suggest that even two chemically similar sugars can elicit quite distinct short- and long-term behaviors, and that immediate behavioral responses are not always predictive of long-term behavioral consequences: while flies find D-arabinose more immediately appealing, L-arabinose is more salient for long-term memory."

There are two possibilities, not mutually exclusive: the two sugars engage distinct neural pathways, or they activate the same neural pathways in a distinct manner. The intial step in sugar detection and consumption are the gustatory-receptor-expressing (Gr) neurons that respond to sweet substances. To date, Gr5a, Gr43a, Gr61a, and Gr64a, b, c, d, e, and f have been implicated in sweet sugar detection (<a href=\"#bib17\">Dahanukar et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Jiao et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib74\">Yavuz et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Freeman et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Miyamoto et al., 2013</a>).

Since silencing Gr5a- and Gr64f-expressing neurons also impairs L-arabinose consumption, the memory impairments may very well be due to an inability to detect L-arabinose (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>).

To determine which receptor within Gr43a neurons\u2014Gr43a or some other receptor expressed by these neurons\u2014is important for L-arabinose memory we trained receptor mutants with L-arabinose. \u2206gr43a, \u2206gr61a, and \u2206gr43a-61a flies all showed a significant reduction (p&lt;0.01) in long-term memory at 24 hr (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). However, D-arabinose preference is maintained in the absence of any single known sugar receptor (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). To determine whether L-arabinose memory phenotypes were simply due to detection deficits, we tested the mutants\u2019 ability to detect L-arabinose. Deletion of Gr43a had a small effect on L-arabinose detection, and deletion of Gr61a resulted in\u00a0~40% reduction (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). D-arabinose detection was not altered by any single receptor deletion (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). Taken together, these results suggest that Gr43a and Gr43a-expressing neurons are important to form long-term memory of L-arabinose, while Gr61a and Gr61a-expressing neurons are important for L- and D-arabinose detection and discrimination. These results, however, do not rule out the possibility that there may be an unidentified receptor that exclusively mediates D-arabinose preference or that L-arabinose memory uses other receptors in addition to Gr43a and Gr61a."

The wide expression pattern, presence of multiple receptors in the same neurons, and different combinations of receptors in different neurons indicate that gustatory-receptor-expressing neurons in various locations may respond quite differently to different sugars (<a href=\"#bib63\">Thoma et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Miyamoto and Amrein, 2014</a>). We focused particularly on Gr43a-expressing neurons for their specific involvement in L-arabinose memory, and previous studies suggested they act as nutrient sensors (<a href=\"#bib47\">Miyamoto et al., 2012</a>). We\u00a0therefore sought to determine whether all Gr43a-expressing neurons or only a subset of Gr43a neurons are important for L-arabinose memory. As reported by others (<a href=\"#bib47\">Miyamoto et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Park and Kwon, 2011</a>), Gr43a<sup>GAL4</sup> expression is consistently detected in four dorsolateral protocerebrum (DLP) neurons in the central brain, the LSO and VCSO neurons in the proboscis, two f5 neurons in the distal tarsi, and in the proventricular ganglion of the gut (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). We selectively silenced the central brain DLP neurons using a Gr43aGAL4:ChaGAL80 (<a href=\"#bib47\">Miyamoto et al., 2012</a>) combination (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>) or the LSO and VCSO neurons using Gr64aGAL4 and Gr64dGAL4 (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). While silencing all Gr43a neurons impaired L-arabinose memory, silencing of just the DLP (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), or just the LSO and VCSO neurons (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>) had no significant effect, suggesting that some combination of Gr43a-expressing neurons that includes the tarsal and/or gut neurons are the necessary Gr43a-expressing neurons for L-arabinose memory. Because silencing of Gr61a- and Gr5a-expressing neurons each blocked L-arabinose memory (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>) and neither Gr5a nor Gr61a expression can be detected in the gut, it seems that the tarsal Gr43a-expressing neurons are the important ones for L-arabinose memory. Previous studies suggested that in the f5 neurons in the distal tarsi, Gr43a is coexpressed with Gr61a (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>) (<a href=\"#bib22\">Freeman and Dahanukar, 2015</a>). There were uncertainities about the coexpression of Gr43a and Gr5a in distal tarsi. However, split-GAL4 reconstitution assay suggests that Gr5a and Gr43a are likely to be coexpressed in one f5 neuron (likely f5V) in the distal tarsi (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>), in agreement with previous work (<a href=\"#bib47\">Miyamoto et al., 2012</a>). Taken together, these results suggest that f5 neurons in the distal tarsi coexpressing Gr43a and some combination of Gr5a and Gr61a are involved in L-arabinose memory. However, these results do not rule out the possibility that other Gr43a neurons or other Gr-expressing neurons are involved in L-arabinose memory."

D-arabinose consistently generated significantly more spikes over a range of concentrations (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A and B</a>). Differences in electrophysiological response also manifested in calcium levels measured by GCaMP6, a genetically encoded calcium indicator (<a href=\"#bib13\">Chen et al., 2013</a>). In Gr43a-expressing f5 neurons in distal tarsi, the peak calcium level was higher and reached more rapidly for D-arabinose than L-arabinose (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Removal of the Gr43a receptor from these neurons significantly reduced response to L-arabinose but not D-arabinose (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>), consistent with the idea that D-arabinose activates multiple receptors. In the proboscis LSO neurons, there was a quicker rise and fall in response to L-arabinose with a slower but more sustained activation in response to D-arabinose (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). However, such differences between D- and L-arabinose-provoked responses are not universal: the average D- and L- arabinose responses of the central brain DLP neurons were similar in both magnitude and shape (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>).

Activation of Gr43a<sup>GAL4</sup> neurons by dTrpA1, however, failed to substitute for the sugar reward (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6B</a>), although similar activation of a subset of dopaminergic neurons (R58E02-GAL4/+; dTrpA1/+) produced long-term appetitive memory as reported by others (<a href=\"#bib41\">Liu et al., 2012</a>) (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>).

Consistent with the latter possibility, activation of Gr43a neurons with the red-shifted channelrhodopsin variant ReaChR, a light-gated cation channel that depolarizes neurons in response to red light (<a href=\"#bib40\">Lin et al., 2013</a>) produced associative memory: when flies expressing ReaChR in Gr43a<sup>GAL4</sup> neurons were exposed to one odor without the light, and a second odor in the presence of red light, the flies subsequently preferred the light-associated odor (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Intriguingly, activation by the same amount of light evenly distributed was not effective in producing long-term memory, suggesting that these patterns evoked different levels or patterns of activity in Gr43a neurons; the nature of this activation is unknown at this time (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C</a>). Finally, starvation is an important regulator of memory strength in the associative-appetitive paradigm\u2014the hungrier the flies are, the better memories they form (<a href=\"#bib38\">Krashes et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Colomb et al., 2009</a>). Starvation also influenced the memory strength following Gr43a-neuron activation: the same pulsated light activation produced memory in starved but not fed flies (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>)."

According to Berridge and Robinson, \u2018wanting\u2019 (incentive salience) is a component of rewards that transforms mere sensory information about rewards and their cues into \u2018attractive, desired, riveting incentives\u2019 and \u2018emerged early in evolution as an elementary form of stimulus-guided goal direction, to mediate pursuit of a few innate food or sex unconditioned stimuli\u2019 (<a href=\"#bib5\">Berridge and Robinson, 2003</a>). In most cases, rewards that are \u2018liked\u2019 are usually also \u2018wanted\u2019, and in conventional formulations, they are considered effectively identical. But work on addiction and monetary reward on human suggest that \u2018wanting\u2019 and \u2018liking\u2019 are in fact dissociable, and while, in many cases, a behavioral response to an experience can predict the likelihood of memory formation, people can be motivated by cues remaining outside conscious awareness (<a href=\"#bib52\">Pessiglione et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Wise, 2002</a>). Here, we report that a similar distinction in reward perception may also exist in <i>Drosophila</i>, which is suggested by others (<a href=\"#bib51\">Perry and Barron, 2013</a>): D-arabinose appears to preferentially involve the \u2018liking\u2019 component of the reward percept and L-arabinose the \u2018wanting\u2019. For <i>Drosophila</i>, the incentive to remember L-arabinose is perhaps owing to the fact that it can inform a specific attribute of food, such as the ripening status of a fruit. Moreover, work in humans suggests that although \u2018liking\u2019 and \u2018wanting\u2019 both represent a positive reward, they utilize distinct neural processing (<a href=\"#bib70\">Wise, 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib55\">Schultz, 2006</a>). Our observations with D- and L-arabinose now provide an opportunity to explore the neural basis of \u2018liking\u2019 and \u2018wanting\u2019, and how these reward percepts strengthen memory in the accessible nervous system of <i>Drosophila</i>."

We find that sugar with no caloric value can also produce long-term appetitive memories. One obvious possibility is that memories of sweet nutritious sugars are distinct from memories of sweet non-nutritious sugars. However, this seems so far not to be the case: a subset of higher\u00a0order dopaminergic neurons (R58E02GAL4) necessary for long-term memory of nutritious sucrose (<a href=\"#bib41\">Liu et al., 2012</a>) is also required for non-nutritious L-arabinose (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Similarly, addition of sorbitol, a tasteless but nutritious sugar, enhances the memory of non-nutritious sugars like xylose and D-arabinose, but does not enhance the\u00a0memory of nutritious sugars (<a href=\"#bib10\">Burke and Waddell, 2011</a>). Adding sorbitol to L-arabinose had no additive effect on long-term memory (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>).

Nonetheless, these observations suggest that flies can quickly assess salient features of sugars\u2014a sort of leading indicator of nutritional value\u2014without the sugar\u2019s metabolic breakdown.

Indeed we find that, apart from flies\u2019 differential preference for various sugars at equal concentrations, for immediate and short-term behavior this is largely true. However, we did not observe any obvious correlation between immediate behavior and long-term memories: flies immediate preference is L-fucose &gt; D-arabinose &gt; L-arabinose &gt; L-sorbose (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>); for short-term memory, L-sorbose = D-arabinose \u2265 L-arabinose = L-fucose (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>); but in order of long-term memory score, L-arabinose \u2265 L-fucose \u2265 D-arabinose = L-sorbose (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). These results indicate that while short-term responses are guided by palatability, long-term behavioral reponses are guided by additional attributes of the sugars. It is not yet clear why D-arabinose is a less effective stimulus. Since D- and L-arabinose are both sweet, they may generate positive sensations in a different manner, or perhaps D-arabinose carries a negative value that over time reduces the positive association formed initially (or dampens the behavioral output)."

Although exactly which Gr receptors are responsible for detecting which sugar remains somewhat controversial, two features of sweet-sensing gustatory receptors are generally agreed upon: first, different gustatory neurons express a number of Gr receptors in unique combinations; second, more than one receptor is typically involved in detecting a sugar (<a href=\"#bib25\">Fujii et al., 2015</a>). However, the physiological consequences of this combinatorial expression of semi-redundant gustatory receptors remain uncertain. This study raises the possibility that gustatory neurons in different locations, expressing unique combinations of receptors, are responsible for discriminating chemically similar sugars and eliciting different behavioral responses. Consistent with this idea, previous studies suggested that Gr43a neurons in the central brain monitor hemolymph fructose levels and modulate feeding behavior (<a href=\"#bib47\">Miyamoto et al., 2012</a>), while we find that these neurons are dispensable for L-arabinose memory, and that peripheral Gr43a-neurons are likely\u00a0sufficient to signal the presence of a rewarding sugar and generate associative memories. These differences likely arise from the locations of these neurons, differentially expressed receptors, the presence or absence of various co-receptors, and the second-order neurons to which these neurons project.

How a difference in activity at the sensory level is conveyed to higher-order neurons, and how that difference is interpreted by the higher-order neurons, remains unclear. More concretely, why is dTrpA1 activation of a subset of dopamine neurons sufficient to generate memory, but dTrpA1 activation of Gr43a-expressing neurons is not? One possibility is that the activity requirements of neuromodulatory systems are less stringent than those for sensory coding, and that temporal\u00a0selectivity occurs before the signal reaches these dopamine neurons.

A hole large enough to fit a funnel was melted into the lid, and the 50 flies were allowed to feed for 5 min in complete darkness, with tape covering the lid hole. At the end of 5 min, the color in their abdomens was assessed under a dissecting microscope, and flies were counted as eating a sugar if any dye was visible in their abdomens or thorax. Flies eating a mix of the two were scored half for L-arabinose, half for D-arabinose. Preference and detection indices were calculated as (number of flies eating sugar)/(total number of flies). To rule out the color bias in the cases of choice between two sugars, half the experiments had the colors reversed. The feeding assay was carried out for 5 min, instead of a period of hours, because in the context of our particular behavioral paradigm the choices made by flies over a longer time period are not relevant."

Forty-seven microliters of 4-methylcyclohexanol (MCH; Sigma) and 42 \u00b5l of 3-octanol (OCT; Alfa Aesar) were separately diluted into two bubble humidifiers (B and F Medical) each containing 50 ml of mineral oil (Fisher Scientific); bubble humidifiers were connected in parallel by \u00bc-inch clear PVC tubing (VWR). 8 cm x 10 cm rectangles of filter paper (410, VWR) were soaked in water or 1\u00a0M sugar solution, and allowed to dry until the paper was damp, then rolled to fit tightly into the training tubes. Groups of 50\u201370 flies were moved into the t-maze, then into the water tube for 2 min while MCH odor passed through, moved back to the holding chamber in the t-maze for 30 s, then moved to the sugar tube for 2 min while OCT odor was flowing through. The next group of flies was trained reciprocally, where OCT was paired with water and MCH with sugar. Unless otherwise specified, after training flies were fed for 4 hr and restarved until testing 24 hr after training. Flies were tested by being given a choice between OCT and MCH in tubes with no filter paper; test duration was 2 min. Short-term memory was assayed 2 min after training. Memory index = [(number of flies in reward odor \u2013 number of flies in unrewarded odor)/(total number of flies)]. A memory index was calculated for each of the two reciprocal trials and then averaged; this average constituted an <i>n</i> of 1.

ANOVA tests for significance were performed a probability value of 0.05 and more stringent values are listed in each figure where applicable. For all experiments, each <i>n</i> is considered a biological replicate; separate trials used independent samples of genetically identical flies. For two-choice experiments, a single <i>n</i> constitutes a population measure generated from 50 male flies. The preference index indicates the proportion of flies eating the sugar, which was determined by scoring visible color in the abdomen or thorax. For video monitoring, each <i>n</i> constitutes a single fly. For survival curves, each <i>n</i> is a population measure generated by 50 flies placed in a tube with 1M sugar. Percent survival indicates the percentage of flies alive at each timepoint. For olfactory training experiments with sugar, heat, and light: one trial consists of giving a group of approximately 50\u201370 flies water and 3-octanol for 2 min, waiting 30 s, then giving sugar and 4-methylcyclohexanol for 2 min. Another group is trained with water and 4-methylcyclohexanol, then sugar and 3-octanol. Memory indices are calculated for each of these two trials and averaged. This average constitutes a single <i>n</i>, which is approximately 100\u2013140 flies. Based on the\u00a0previous and ongoing experimental effect sizes, 8\u201310 of these double trials were generally judged to be adequate for memory experiments, unless effect sizes were strikingly large or variable. The more dramatic effect sizes and smaller variability of preference assays allowed a smaller number of trials, generally 4. In all long-term memory experiments, experimental manipulations for which a negative result was plausible or expected were always trained alongside a positive control. This is the reason for conspicuously large numbers of trials with sucrose and L-arabinose compared to other sugars or manipulations. Similarly, for experimental groups needing to be compared to two or more controls, the experimental group was first trained alongside one of the control groups, and then again trained alongside the other control group (s). This is the reason for large numbers of trials in, for example, the ChaGAL80 and ReaChR experiments."

Tissues were again washed five times, and mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories) on slides with doubled clear reinforcement labels (Avery); No. 1 \u00bd coverslips were used (VWR). Images were acquired on a Zeiss Pascal confocal microscope with a Plan Apochromat 20 \u00d7 0.8 NA objective. GFP fluorescence was excited at 488 nm and emission was collected through a 505\u2013530 nm bandpass filter."

Two- to 7-day-old flies were used. All tissues were dissected in Ringers solution (5 mM HEPES, 130 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>); legs were removed from the fly, placed on a 50 mm glass-bottomed dish No 1.5 (Mattek), and immobilized with a 1.5 \u00b5l drop of 2-hydroxyethylagarose (Sigma). After the agarose firmed, 20 \u00b5l of Ringers was added to cover the leg. In D- vs L-arabinose comparisons, both front legs of the fly were used as matched controls. Brains adhered to the dish without need for agarose when placed into a 30 \u00b5L bubble of Ringers. Proboscis imaging was performed with the proboscis upside down on the plate, so that the dorsal proboscis was contacting the dish; the proboscis was immobilized with 1.5 \u00b5l of agarose and again covered with 30 \u00b5l of Ringers solution. Only one sugar was tested per tissue sample. Images were collected at least 40 s before sugar was added; sugar was added at 2x concentration, in the same volume as the Ringers covering the tissues. Because the training paradigm uses high concentrations (up to 1\u00a0M) of sugar, we used 500 mM sugar concentrations for the leg and proboscis imaging. However, for the brain, 500 mM appeared to cause osmolarity-induced shrinking, so brain imaging used 100 mM sugars. Leg imaging was performed at approximately one stack per 5\u20137 s; proboscis imaging at approximately one stack per 13 s; brain imaging at approximately one per 14 s. Only tissues that showed a response were used in analysis, although tissues that didn\u2019t respond were checked for viability by adding fructose as a positive control. Images were acquired on a Zeiss Pascal confocal microscope with a Plan Apochromat 20 \u00d7 0.8 NA objective. GFP fluorescence was excited at 488 nm and emission was collected through a 505\u2013530 nm bandpass filter. For calcium imaging of the leg with \u0394Gr43a-GAL4 x UAS-GCaMP3 and \u0394Gr43a-GAL4; UAS-GCaMP6med flies, images were acquired on an Ultraview Vox (PerkinElmer) with a Plan Apochromat 20 \u00d7 0.8 NA objective at approximately one stack per 10 s; GFP fluorescence was excited at 488 nm and collected through a 525\u2013550 nm bandpass filter. Analysis was performed in ImageJ (NIH) using in-house plugins: z-stack images were sum-projected and camera background was subtracted by selecting a region of interest away from the tissue. Where needed, the StackReg registration plugin was used to minimize movement artifacts (<a href=\"#bib64\">Th\u00e9venaz al., 1998</a>). Measurements were always taken by encircling cell bodies. In tissues with more than one neuron visible, the response of each neuron was analyzed separately and then averaged to generate an average response for that single tissue; this average constituted a single <i>n</i> and was used with others to generate average response curves and peak \u0394F/F<sub>o</sub>. Peak \u0394F/F<sub>o</sub> measurements were made by taking the first peak value, and dividing by the average of five timepoints immediately preceding the rise. To generate normalized fluorescence curves, individual tissue averages were aligned by the first timepoint of the rise. Curves for leg and proboscis were linearly resampled at 3 s; brain at 5 s. Curves were then min/max normalized, and average trajectories were calculated. Error bars were calculated as standard error in the mean. Average curves were plotted in GraphPad Prism 5."

Each box had a row of five capillary tubes (5 \u00b5l minicaps, Hirschmann LaborGer\u00e4te, Germany), filled with a dilution of sugar mixed with a red dye (erythrosine 0.374 mg/ml; Sigma France). The concentrations of sugar (L- and D-arabinose, Sigma, France) were: 1 M, 100 mM, 10 mM, 1 mM and 0 mM. Each box was monitored with a webcam (HD Pro C920 or QuickCam Pro 9000, Logitech). The boxes and cameras were housed in a climatic chamber maintaining a temperature of 25\u00b0C and 80% H.R. (DR-36 VL, CLF Plant Climatics GmbH, Germany). For each box, images were acquired at a rate of one image/ min for 2 hr using the software VisionGS, Germany. The stack of images was then transferred to ImageJ (<a href=\"#bib1\">Abramoff et al., 2004</a>) and the liquid level of each capillary was analyzed using a Java plugin, and subsequently transferred to Excel. Results are expressed as the mean of the change of the liquid level in each capillary (D-arabinose: n\u00a0=\u00a012; L-arabinose: n\u00a0=\u00a010 boxes).

Briefly, adult flies (3-\u00a0to\u00a04-day old) were anesthetized on ice and immobilized on a putty platform (UHU stick), using thin stripes of tape. They were then disposed under a stereomicroscope (MZ12, Leica) and specific sensilla from the proboscis or from the legs were stimulated and recorded, using a TasteProbe amplifier (DT-02, Syntech, Germany; <a href=\"#bib42\">Marion-Poll and Pers, 1996</a>) connected to a general purpose amplifier (CyberAmp 320, Data Translation, USA) which further amplified (x100) and filtered the signal (10 Hz-2800 Hz). The stimulus electrode contained tricholine citrate (TCC 30 mM), in order to allow an electric contact to be established with the sensillum and to inhibit firing activity arising from water-sensitive cells (<a href=\"#bib69\">Wieczorek and Wolff, 1989</a>). A reference electrode was connected to the abdomen of the fly, using a drop of electrocardiogram gel. Each stimulation lasted 2 s and was digitized at 10 kHz, 16 bits during 2 s (DT9818, Data Translation, USA). The data acquisition, spike detection and sorting was performed under a program, dbWave. The results were subsequently transferred to Excel, and expressed as the mean (n\u00a0=\u00a08\u201315 measures). Error bars were computed as the s.e.m."

They explore differences in hedonic value (sweetness) and find that L-arabinose, which is less preferred in residence or feeding assays, can form long-term associative memory, whereas D-arabinose cannot. Therefore, the study makes the unexpected observation that the strength of the immediate gustatory response of a fly to a sweet compound does not necessarily predict its strength as a reinforcer for associative memory. Thus, 1M D-Arabinose which is perceived as much sweeter than 1M L-Arabinose by the fly in a simple behavioural test, is remarkably much weaker than the L-isomer as an unconditional reinforcing stimulus in an appetitive conditioning procedure that induces LTM."

This would be a novel conclusion, particularly given the conclusions of Masek and Scott 2010, who postulate that sweet sensory neurons can only encode relative sweetness (or sugar concentrations) and not qualitative differences between sugar compounds. The authors use a panel of Gr-GAL4 drivers to identify neurons that function in L-arabinose memory, use calcium imaging to characterize D-ara and L-ara responses in a pair of Gr43a tarsal neurons, and use optogenetics to show that pulsed activation, but not continuous activation, of these neurons can form long-term memory (LTM) in the absence of sugar reward in hungry flies. Their genetic and behavioural data suggest that the Gr61a receptor expressing neurons contribute to sweetness discrimination and that a combinatorial effect of Gr61 and Gr43a expressing neurons is involved in determining reinforcement strength. Although these initial findings are very interesting and the study encompasses a large number of experiments, in its present form they fail to deliver conclusive results that support the model that variation in D-ara and L-ara evoked activity in Gr43a neurons is the mechanism underlying the differential effects of these sugars in generating LTM."

The statement that \"it appears that the distal tarsi Gr43a-Gr61a- expressing neurons that also express Gr5a are critical for L-arabinose memory\" is weak. Given that GAL4 and LexA drivers are available for both Gr5a and Gr43a, it is possible to manipulate only the overlapping neurons of interest to determine if they are indeed critical for L-arabinose memory. This is particularly important because of variability in GAL4 driver expression, and results that conflict with expectations from previous mapping analyses: for example, previous reports map Gr43a-GAL4 neurons as a subset of Gr61a-GAL4 neurons. Yet, pulsed activation with Gr43a-GAL4 is sufficient for long-term memory but that of Gr61a-GAL4 is not. It would be useful to explain this discrepancy. One of those studies also maps Gr5a-GAL4 and Gr43a-GAL4 to mutually exclusive subsets of tarsal neurons."

It would be more useful to determine threshold concentrations for D-ara and L-ara behavioral responses against water. This has been done to some extent for L-arabinose in <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>, but the analysis with a single concentration may not uncover functional redundancies in L-ara detection between the different Gr-GAL4 neurons that are being tested. This is supported by the observation that Gr43a neurons respond to L-ara (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B and 3C</a>) but are not required for behavioral response to L-ara (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). To really make the following statements: \"Taken together these results suggest that preference for D-arabinose relies on Gr43a and Gr61a-expressing neurons, while L-arabinose memory relies on Gr43a-, Gr61a-, and Gr5a expressing neurons. However, D-arabinose preference can be maintained in the absence of any single receptor (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figures 2B</a>), whereas L-arabinose memory specifically requires Gr43a and Gr61a receptors (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>),\" it is necessary to test various concentrations of D-ara versus water to conclude that D-ara preference is maintained in the absence of any receptor. We suspect that this will change with the mutants tested as they will impact how \"sweet\" D-ara is, and thus, how much flies ingest of it. It is not quite enough to test D-ara preference relative to L-ara. That could simply reflect relative sweetness."

With the GCaMP analysis provided, the differences in activation patterns evoked by D-ara and L-ara in Gr43a neurons are not entirely convincing and have not been investigated to the extent that is necessary. In particular, the authors should examine these patterns across concentrations, and quantify the temporal differences in activation patterns rather than presenting only peak values (which are not different). Ideally, tip-recordings would provide higher resolution and more convincing data to determine if L-ara and D-ara are eliciting distinct neural patterns that could allow flies to discriminate between the 2 molecules. In this scenario, dose responses of the two sugars should be tested with tip recordings of proboscis taste sensilla (or leg taste sensilla)."

From the study of Inagaki et al., it seems that despite the fact that ReaChR triggers more tonic responses, it is still quite phasic. A pulsed stimulus could be more efficient in terms of total number of action potentials generated. In other words, this experiment is not conclusive regarding the frequency of the stimulation, as it can be read also that patterned stimuli are more efficient simply because more spikes are generated. This assumption is wrong (same paragraph): \"For example, certain pulsated patterns of light (20 Hz, 15 msec pulse-width for 2.5 ms, repeated every 20 seconds) generated long-term associative memories, while the same amount of light delivered in a uniform, tonic pattern was markedly less effective (15 msec pulse-width repeated every 327 msec continuously) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>).\" \u2013 it could be less effective because less spikes are generated. The \"amount of light\" is not a trustworthy indication of how much spiking is generated in the neurons."

Given that GAL4 and LexA drivers are available for both Gr5a and Gr43a, it is possible to manipulate only the overlapping neurons of interest to determine if they are indeed critical for L-arabinose memory. This is particularly important because of variability in GAL4 driver expression, and results that conflict with expectations from previous mapping analyses: for example, previous reports map Gr43a-GAL4 neurons as a subset of Gr61a-GAL4 neurons. Yet, pulsed activation with Gr43a-GAL4 is sufficient for long-term memory but that of Gr61a-GAL4 is not. It would be useful to explain this discrepancy.

To address this issue we tried to use LexA/GAL4 flies to turn off GAL4 expression in the dual positive neurons (LexAop-GAL80). Since silencing of all Gr43a positive neurons impairs memory, we intended to test whether just de-silencing of the Gr43a-Gr5a neurons would be sufficient to form L-ara memory; all remaining Gr43a-expressing neurons would remain silenced. Unfortunately, with the stocks we have, flies bearing Gr43aGAL4::UAS-Kir; Gr5aLexA::LexAop-GAL80 transgenes were not very healthy and unsuitable for long-term memory assay.

This has been done to some extent for L-arabinose in <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>, but the analysis with a single concentration may not uncover functional redundancies in L-ara detection between the different Gr-GAL4 neurons that are being tested.

We found at 50mM, L-arabinose detection drops significantly but the flies still detect D-arabinose. However when the concentration drops to 10mM D-arabinose detection is also reduced. Unlike L-and D- arabinose the flies can detect 10mM sucrose at a similar level to that of 1M. Interestingly, however, at 10mM concentrations of L-ara, D-ara, or sucrose, irrespective of whether the flies have problem detecting it (as in the case or D-arabinose or L-arabinose) or no problem (as in the case of sucrose) flies don\u2019t form any long-term memory.

From the study of Inagaki et al., it seems that despite the fact that ReaChR triggers more tonic responses, it is still quite phasic. A pulsed stimulus could be more efficient in terms of total number of action potentials generated. In other words, this experiment is not conclusive regarding the frequency of the stimulation, as it can be read also that patterned stimuli are more efficient simply because more spikes are generated. This assumption is wrong (same paragraph): \"For example, certain pulsated patterns of light (20 Hz, 15 msec pulse-width for 2.5 ms, repeated every 20 seconds) generated long-term associative memories, while the same amount of light delivered in a uniform, tonic pattern was markedly less effective (15 msec pulse-width repeated every 327 msec continuously) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>).\" \u2013 it could be less effective because less spikes are generated.
