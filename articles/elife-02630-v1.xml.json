Here we identify causes underlying hybrid infertility of two recently diverged fission yeast species <i>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</i> and <i>S. kambucha</i>, which mate to form viable hybrid diploids that efficiently complete meiosis, but generate few viable gametes. We find that chromosomal rearrangements and related recombination defects are major but not sole causes of hybrid infertility. At least three distinct meiotic drive alleles, one on each <i>S. kambucha</i> chromosome, independently contribute to hybrid infertility by causing nonrandom spore death. Two of these driving loci are linked by a chromosomal translocation and thus constitute a novel type of paired meiotic drive complex. Our study reveals how quickly multiple barriers to fertility can arise. In addition, it provides further support for models in which genetic conflicts, such as those caused by meiotic drive alleles, can drive speciation."

Here we identify causes underlying hybrid infertility of two recently diverged fission yeast species <i>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</i> and <i>S. kambucha</i>, which mate to form viable hybrid diploids that efficiently complete meiosis, but generate few viable gametes. We find that chromosomal rearrangements and related recombination defects are major but not sole causes of hybrid infertility. At least three distinct meiotic drive alleles, one on each <i>S. kambucha</i> chromosome, independently contribute to hybrid infertility by causing nonrandom spore death. Two of these driving loci are linked by a chromosomal translocation and thus constitute a novel type of paired meiotic drive complex. Our study reveals how quickly multiple barriers to fertility can arise. In addition, it provides further support for models in which genetic conflicts, such as those caused by meiotic drive alleles, can drive speciation."

This model proposes that hybrid sterility results from incompatibilities between genes that evolved in different populations and were therefore never tested together by natural selection (<a href=\"#bib13\">Coyne and Orr, 2004</a>). Indeed, incompatible BDM pairs have been identified in diverse organisms that either cause hybrid sterility or reinforce species isolation (<a href=\"#bib9\">Brideau et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Lee et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bayes and Malik, 2009</a>). Although relatively few loci underlying hybrid incompatibilities have been identified, one theme that has emerged is that the loci are often rapidly evolving and implicated as players in \u2018molecular evolutionary arms races\u2019. These arms races can occur between host genomes and external forces such as parasites (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bomblies et al., 2007</a>). Alternatively, the genetic conflicts can be between different elements <i>within</i> a genome, such as between selfish parasitic genes and other host genes (<a href=\"#bib33\">Johnson, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Presgraves, 2010</a>)."

For instance, changes in ploidy are a rapid means of speciation in plants (<a href=\"#bib47\">Otto and Whitton, 2000</a>). Defects in meiotic recombination contribute to hybrid infertility in both mouse and budding yeast hybrids (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hunter et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bhattacharyya et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Mihola et al., 2009</a>).

In the classic chromosomal speciation model, chromosomal rearrangements between populations lead to infertility when heterozygous. Like DM gene incompatibilities, chromosomal rearrangements can contribute to hybrid infertility and serve as a genetic barrier between populations (<a href=\"#bib63\">White, 1978</a>). For example, the transposition of an essential fertility gene causes male infertility in some <i>Drosophila</i> hybrids and chromosomal rearrangements contribute to hybrid infertility in some budding yeast hybrids (<a href=\"#bib41\">Masly et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Delneri et al., 2003</a>)."

One possibility is that a rearrangement could become fixed in a small population via genetic drift and inbreeding (<a href=\"#bib52\">Rieseberg, 2001</a>). White proposed an alternative solution in which novel chromosomal rearrangements could increase in frequency if they were linked to meiotic drive alleles (<a href=\"#bib63\">White, 1978</a>). These selfish genetic elements \u2018cheat\u2019 to be transmitted to more than 50% of the functional gametes of a heterozygote (<a href=\"#bib11\">Burt and Trivers, 2006</a>). Due to their transmission advantage, meiotic drive alleles and loci linked to them can spread through a population even if they cause fertility decreases (<a href=\"#bib15\">Crow, 1991</a>). In this way, even a chromosomal rearrangement that causes decreased fertility when heterozygous could become fixed in a population if it is linked to a strong meiotic drive allele. Because loci linked to drive alleles also benefit from the transmission advantage, linked variants that enhance drive will also be selected (<a href=\"#bib15\">Crow, 1991</a>). Chromosome inversions that prevent recombination thereby reinforcing the linkage between drive alleles and their enhancers can also spread through a population due to enhanced drive. In this way, meiotic drive alleles can even <i>promote the evolution</i> of chromosomal rearrangements, in spite of their fitness costs. Consistent with this, meiotic drive loci are commonly found within inversions and have been proposed to underlie other types of dramatic karyotype evolution (<a href=\"#bib20\">Dyer et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Larracuente and Presgraves, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Pardo-Manuel de Villena and Sapienza, 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Hammer et al., 1989</a>). However, there is currently little experimental or theoretical support for White's model; genetic conflicts and chromosomal rearrangements are still considered distinct causes of hybrid sterility and speciation."

Although there is evidence of genetic outcrossing in yeasts closely related to <i>Sp</i>, the relative frequencies of outcrossing vs selfing are unknown (<a href=\"#bib10\">Brown et al., 2011</a>). <i>Sk</i> and <i>Sp</i> are 99.5% identical at the DNA sequence level (<a href=\"#bib51\">Rhind et al., 2011</a>).

To assay hybrid fertility, we measured the viable spore yield of <i>Sk/Sp</i> hybrids, <i>Sk/Sk</i>, and <i>Sp/Sp</i> diploids (<a href=\"#bib58\">Smith, 2009</a>). This assay measures the number of viable spores (gametes) produced per viable diploid placed on the starvation medium that induces cells to undergo meiosis. Spores are considered viable if they are able to grow into a visible colony. Because cells can undergo a few mitotic divisions prior to meiosis and not all spores can be recovered from the starvation medium, the assay is a relative, rather than an absolute, measure. <i>Sk/Sk</i> diploids had a slightly lower viable spore yield than <i>Sp/Sp</i> diploids, 3.6 vs 8.4 (unpaired <i>t</i> test p=0.053; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). However, when assayed via micromanipulation of individual spores, spores derived from <i>Sp/Sp</i> and <i>Sk/Sk</i> diploids were equally viable. We therefore conclude that the difference between <i>Sp/Sp</i> and <i>Sk/Sk</i> diploids in the viable spore yield assay is due to an extra mitosis of <i>Sp/Sp</i> diploids before meiotic induction, not higher viability of gametes. In sharp contrast, <i>Sk/Sp</i> hybrids had a viable spore yield at least 24-fold less than that of either of the pure species diploids (<i>t</i> test p&lt;0.01; <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>)."

In many eukaryotes, meiotic recombination is essential for the production of viable gametes. This is because recombination can form crossovers, which help ensure proper disjunction of homologous chromosome pairs during the first meiotic division (<a href=\"#bib35\">Kerr et al., 2012</a>). When a pair of homologous chromosomes fails to form a crossover in meiosis, chromosomes segregate less faithfully and can produce aneuploid gametes. In both budding yeast and mouse hybrids, defects in meiotic recombination are major causes of hybrid infertility (<a href=\"#bib29\">Hunter et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Bhattacharyya et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Mihola et al., 2009</a>).

In many organisms, including <i>Sp</i>, meiotic DSBs are not randomly distributed; rather they are concentrated in regions called hotspots (<a href=\"#bib14\">Cromie et al., 2007</a>). DSB hotspots are thought to evolve rapidly because they can be lost due to biased gene conversion during break repair (<a href=\"#bib8\">Boulton et al., 1997</a>). Perhaps related to this, rapid divergence of a DSB hotspot-determining protein contributes to infertility of certain mouse hybrids and some human males (<a href=\"#bib42\">Mihola et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib43\">Myers et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib56\">Segurel et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib4\">Baudat et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Irie et al., 2009</a>). To test if DSB hotspot divergence contributes to <i>Sk/Sp</i> hybrid infertility, we mapped the locations of <i>Sk</i> DSB hotspots. Rec12 remains covalently linked to the DNA it cuts, so DSB sites can be mapped by identifying the DNA linked to Rec12 (<a href=\"#bib34\">Keeney et al., 1997</a>). To do this in <i>Sk</i>, we first generated a strain containing a FLAG-tagged <i>rec12</i> gene and the <i>rad50S</i> mutation in which DSBs form normally but are not repaired (<a href=\"#bib1\">Alani et al., 1990</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Hyppa et al., 2008</a>). We then used chromatin immunoprecipitation on meiotic extracts to pull down Rec12-FLAG and the covalently attached DNA. We identified the bound DNA by amplification and hybridization to a microarray. Qualitatively, we found that the overall genome-wide pattern of DSB hotspots in <i>Sk</i> was similar to the published <i>Sp</i> hotspot map (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Cromie et al., 2007</a>). We then compared the DSB hotspots between <i>Sk</i> and <i>Sp</i> at 286 previously identified <i>Sp</i> hotspots and found strong correlation between hotspot intensities in the two species (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">Fowler et al., 2013</a>).

To observe DSB formation, we used pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) of whole chromosomes in <i>rad50S</i> hybrid and control diploids. We found that like those of pure species, the <i>Sk/Sp</i> chromosomes were effectively broken in meiosis (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). For a more precise view of DSB formation in hybrids, we assayed break formation in <i>rad50S</i> diploids at known meiotic DSB hotspots contained on the <i>Not</i>I restriction fragments designated \u2018J\u2019 (0.5 Mb) and \u2018D\u2019 (1.1 Mb) of the <i>Sp</i> genome (<a href=\"#bib14\">Cromie et al., 2007</a>). We found that both <i>Sk</i> and hybrid diploids exhibited similar amounts of breakage at the same sites, in accord with the microarray results above (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C,D</a>). To assay DSB repair, we visualized meiotic chromosomes via PFGE in <i>rad50</i><sup><i>+</i></sup> (DSB repair proficient) diploids. As in pure species, chromosomes of <i>Sk/Sp</i> diploids were largely intact throughout meiotic prophase (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). This shows that the breaks that form (e.g., <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>) are efficiently repaired. Together, these results suggest that DSB formation is grossly normal in <i>Sk/Sp</i> hybrids and that the breaks are repaired efficiently."

This is largely because random segregation of three chromosome pairs at the first meiotic division would frequently (\u223c25% of the time) result in a viable chromosome complement: haploid, diploid, or chromosome 3 disome. In addition, <i>Sp</i>, like some other species, has a recombination-independent chromosome segregation system that is partially effective in promoting proper chromosome segregation (<a href=\"#bib16\">Davis and Smith, 2003</a>). As expected, when we eliminated nearly all meiotic recombination by deleting <i>rec12</i> (<i>rec12\u0394</i>), both <i>Sp/Sp</i> and <i>Sk/Sk rec12\u0394</i> mutant diploids had viable spore yields fourfold to fivefold lower than the corresponding <i>rec12</i><sup><i>+</i></sup> diploids (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). Surprisingly, a similar decrease in fertility was not observed in <i>rec12\u0394 Sk/Sp</i> hybrid diploids: their viable spore yield was indistinguishable from that of <i>rec12</i><sup><i>+</i></sup> hybrid diploids (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). This result demonstrates that recombination does not promote <i>Sk/Sp</i> hybrid fertility, unlike in pure species. This could be because <i>Sk/Sp</i> hybrids fail to form crossovers and/or because the recombination events that occur in hybrids hurt fertility just as much as they promote it."

To address this latter possibility, we resequenced the <i>Sk</i> genome (\u2018Materials and methods\u2019) (<a href=\"#bib51\">Rhind et al., 2011</a>), which revealed that a large region of chromosome 1 (between base pairs 2,683,632 and 4,911,515) is inverted in the <i>Sp</i> genome, relative to <i>Sk</i> (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s4\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 4</a>). This inversion has been previously described (<a href=\"#bib10\">Brown et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Teresa Avelar et al., 2013</a>) and it occurred in the <i>Sp</i> lineage (<a href=\"#bib10\">Brown et al., 2011</a>). Odd numbers of crossovers within this inversion would cause lethal chromosomal rearrangements (duplications of one arm and deletion of the other). This would cause spore inviability and likely explains why <i>rec12</i><sup><i>+</i></sup> <i>Sk/Sp</i> hybrids do not have higher fertility than <i>rec12\u0394</i> hybrids, since odd numbers of crossovers within the inversion would likely impair viable spore recovery as much as an absence of recombination (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). The recombination pattern of markers across chromosome 1 is consistent with this interpretation. The <i>lys1-lys7</i> interval, in which we observed the greatest reduction in recombinants, is located within the inversion (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplements 2, 3</a>). The next highest reduction in recombinant frequencies was between markers flanking the inversion boundary (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplements 2, 3</a>).

These non-inversion associated differences are not a hybrid-specific defect and may be due to different recombination frequencies in <i>Sk</i> and <i>Sp</i>, perhaps caused by different DSB frequencies or different DSB repair outcomes (<a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>)."

We speculated that there was a reciprocal translocation between <i>Sk</i> chromosomes 2 and 3, relative to <i>Sp</i>. If such a translocation included essential genes, it would render gametes with non-parental chromosome combinations of the affected arms inviable; this inviability would also create the semblance of genetic linkage between the two chromosomes.

First, <i>rec12\u0394 Sk/Sp</i> hybrid diploids still have greater than six-fold lower viable spore yield than <i>rec12\u0394 Sk/Sk or Sp/Sp</i> (pure species) diploids (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>). The chromosome 2-chromosome 3 reciprocal translocation predicts only a two-fold lower viable spore yield because only half of the gametes would inherit an incompatible chromosome combination. Second, if defects in recombination cause errors in chromosome segregation leading to the production of aneuploid and diploid gametes (e.g., <a href=\"#bib16\">Davis and Smith, 2003</a>), we would expect that the frequency of aneuploid and diploid spores produced by <i>Sk/Sp</i> hybrids in the absence of meiotic recombination (<i>rec12\u0394</i>) should be similar to the frequencies observed in <i>rec12\u0394</i> pure species controls. In contrast to this expectation, we find that the level of heterozygous aneuploids and diploids in <i>rec12\u0394</i> hybrids is still significantly (at least twofold) higher than that observed in both <i>rec12\u0394 Sk/Sk</i> and <i>rec12\u0394 Sp/Sp</i> controls (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>; p&lt;0.01 for both; G-test).

To distinguish between these possibilities, we calculated the frequency of aneuploids and diploids produced <i>per meiosis</i> in hybrids and pure species controls by multiplying the viable spore yield (viable spores produced per cell induced to undergo meiosis) by the fraction of viable spores that were aneuploid or diploid (i.e., aneuploids or diploids per viable spore). Our analyses revealed very small differences in the proportion of aneuploids that were generated in hybrids vs pure species meiosis (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>).

On chromosome 1, the transmission bias of <i>Sk lys1</i> (72%) was stronger than those of both <i>ura1</i> (55%) and <i>arg3</i> (<i>58</i>%), indicating that the driving locus is closer to <i>lys1</i> than to <i>ura1</i> or <i>arg3</i>.

For example, if <i>Sp</i> gene A was incompatible with <i>Sk</i> gene B, but <i>Sk</i> gene A was compatible with both <i>Sp</i> and <i>Sk</i> alleles of gene B, <i>Sk</i> gene A would be over-represented in the surviving gametes. This scenario predicts that we still should expect to recover haploid spores with all three <i>Sk</i> chromosomes at the same frequency as haploids with all three <i>Sp</i> chromosomes, since pure species chromosome combinations are compatible. However, <i>rec12\u0394 Sk/Sp</i> meiosis yielded the pure <i>Sk</i> haploid genotype approximately five times more frequently (6.5% of viable spores) than the pure <i>Sp</i> haploid genotype (1.4%; <a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). In addition, we found that all haploid combinations of <i>Sk</i> and <i>Sp</i> chromosomes (except those with non-parental combinations of chromosomes 2 and 3) are viable and have similar growth rates, suggesting that they do not suffer from a mitotic fitness loss. For example, cells that inherit <i>Sp</i> chromosome 1 (P1) and <i>Sk</i> chromosomes 2 and 3 (K2 and K3) grow very similarly to <i>Sp</i> cells. The reciprocal is also true (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a>). Although we cannot generate K2 P3 or P2 K3 haploids, rare recombinant strains that combine portions of K2 with portions of P3 (and vice versa) also grow well. Despite this, chromosome combinations containing <i>Sp</i> chromosomes are dramatically underrepresented amongst the viable spores of <i>rec12\u0394 Sk/Sp</i> hybrids (<a href=\"#fig6s3\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). The overrepresentation of <i>Sk</i> alleles amongst the viable progeny therefore cannot be explained by (BDM) incompatibilities between nuclear <i>Sk</i> and <i>Sp</i> genes. Instead, our results are consistent with the action of meiotic drive alleles on <i>Sk</i> chromosomes that specifically target <i>Sp</i> chromosomes during or following hybrid meiosis. We have not, however, eliminated the formal possibility that genic incompatibilities exist and contribute to spore death in <i>rec12</i><sup><i>+</i></sup> crosses, which do undergo meiotic recombination potentially exposing intrachromosomal incompatibilities."

Because of this, mitochondrial-nuclear gene incompatibilities could be lethal. We therefore tested the hypothesis that incompatibilities between the <i>Sk</i> mitochondrial genome and <i>Sp</i> nuclear genes could also contribute to the meiotic drive phenotype. We did this by assaying the transmission of alleles through hybrids containing either <i>Sp</i> or <i>Sk</i> mtDNA (obtained after prolonged growth of <i>Sk/Sp</i> hybrid diploids).

For example, if allele(s) on K2 drive, K3 may appear to drive just because spores that inherit K2 and P3 are inviable. The converse could also be true. This line of thinking inspired us to test whether each <i>Sk</i> chromosome can drive independently, in the absence of drive on the other two chromosomes.

                                "text": "Two types of loci can achieve transmission distortion in their own favor during meiosis. The first are 'true drive' alleles in which the drive occurs due to nonrandom segregation of alleles during the meiotic divisions in asymmetric (female) meiosis. For example, 'knobs' on maize chromosomes can drive by preferentially segregating into the nucleus that will become the oocyte, rather than into nuclei that become polar bodies and are lost (<a href=\"#bib17\">Dawe and Cande, 1996</a>). Similarly, centromeres in Mimulus species can drive in female meiosis (<a href=\"#bib23\">Fishman and Saunders, 2008</a>). Alternatively, transmission distortion can be achieved not by nonrandom segregation but instead by \u2018gamete killing\u2019 in symmetric (male) meiosis. Gamete killer alleles segregate into gametes randomly, but the trans-acting killer alleles cause the death or malfunction of the gametes that do not inherit them. Although the mechanisms vary, this type of drive occurs in widely diverged eukaryotes. For example, male mice heterozygous for the t-haplotype produce mostly (&gt;95%) functional sperm containing the t-haplotype. The sperm that do not inherit the t-haplotype are nonfunctional due to immobility (<a href=\"#bib55\">Schimenti, 2000</a>). Similarly, in <i>Drosophila</i>, sperm with chromosomes carrying large amounts of the <i>Responder</i> DNA satellite suffer chromosome condensation delays in the presence of the <i>Segregation Distorter</i> haplotype and do not contribute equally to functional sperm (<a href=\"#bib38\">Larracuente and Presgraves, 2012</a>). In <i>Neurospora</i>, a spore killer allele kills gametes that do not inherit it by interfering with spore development (<a href=\"#bib27\">Hammond et al., 2012</a>)."

We do not yet know the mechanism by which <i>Sk</i> alleles gain their transmission advantage or at what point in gametogenesis it occurs. Drive likely occurs, however, via trans-acting gamete killing, as observed in all other cases of drive in symmetric meiosis, not via nonrandom chromosome segregation. We hypothesize that a \u2018poison\u2019 produced by each driving allele during hybrid sporulation renders spores that inherit the <i>Sp</i> allele at that locus less viable. For instance, such a \u2018poison\u2019 may prevent hybrid spores that inherit the <i>Sp</i> allele from expressing an essential gene for completing sporulation or germination. Precise mapping of the driving alleles will help reveal their mechanisms of action. Genetically separating the action of each driver (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>) allows us to conclude that they would each meet the criteria for meiotic drive. However, simultaneous action of all three drivers exposed in the <i>Sk/Sp</i> cross, together with the chromosomal rearrangements, leads to a dramatic loss of viable spore yield and would curb the fixation of the driver alleles. This is why we hypothesize that each of the three drivers that favor the transmission of <i>Sk</i> alleles likely arose independently or sequentially along the <i>Sk</i> lineage."

In this way, the alleles compete on an equal playing field and spread through a population by promoting fitness. By subverting Mendelian transmission, meiotic drive alleles and linked loci can spread and even drive more fit alleles to extinction. The meiotic drive we observed could therefore also be detrimental to fitness indirectly by biasing allele transmission. In this scenario, natural selection would therefore favor the evolution of drive suppressors that are unlinked to the driving loci (<a href=\"#bib15\">Crow, 1991</a>). Meiotic drive loci that could evade such suppression and re-establish their transmission advantage would then be favored. This genetic conflict between meiotic drive loci and their suppressors would set up an evolutionary arms race where both sides must innovate to try to gain an advantage. We predict that such an arms race is occurring within fission yeasts and we are able to observe drive only in the hybrids because the drive suppressors in <i>Sp</i> are incompatible with the driving alleles in <i>Sk</i>. Under this scenario, it is completely possible that in a cross between <i>Sp</i> and another <i>Sp</i>-like isolate, the <i>Sp</i> drive alleles may emerge victorious."

The reciprocal translocation between <i>Sk</i> chromosomes 2 and 3 genetically links the two chromosomes. For example, <i>leu1</i> and <i>ade6</i> are genetically linked in <i>Sk/Sp</i> hybrids despite being on chromosomes 2 and 3, respectively (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>, <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). <i>leu1</i> and <i>ade6</i> are also both closely linked to the drive alleles on their chromosomes; thus, the translocation also links the drive alleles on separate chromosomes (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). We demonstrated that each of the drive alleles can act in the absence of drive of the other two chromosomes (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>). In an exciting twist for a meiotic drive system, however, the drive of the weaker allele may be bolstered by the drive of the stronger allele. Such a two-chromosome, two-locus drive system could be a formidable selfish evolutionary force. Like an inversion, the translocation expands the region effectively linked to the driving loci, resulting in a larger proportion of the genome favoring drive enhancers and a smaller proportion favoring suppressors. In addition, if a suppressor of one of the drive alleles does arise in the population, the drive of the other allele can compensate and minimal suppression will actually occur. In other words, both drive alleles must be suppressed simultaneously to restore Mendelian allele transmission."

Our crosses (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>, <a href=\"#fig8s2\">Figure 8\u2014figure supplement 2</a>) indicate that the aneuploidy phenotype is caused by <i>Sk/Sp</i> heterozygosity of an allele or alleles on chromosome 3.

Indeed, even the aneuploids produced by <i>Sk/Sp</i> hybrids show a slower growth phenotype (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). One hypothesis that would explain this higher recovery of aneuploid and diploid spores is that the disjunction of chromosomes (especially the <i>Sk</i> and <i>Sp</i> third chromosomes) is compromised during hybrid meiosis. Contrary to this, we calculate that hybrid meioses do not generate aneuploid or diploid gametes more frequently (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A</a>).

In this model, only cells containing both <i>Sk</i> and <i>Sp</i> chromosome 3 are fully resistant to the effects of both drivers. Because aneuploids are genetically unstable and frequently become haploid upon mitotic growth (<a href=\"#bib45\">Niwa et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib37\">Kohli et al., 1977</a>), the enhanced viability of aneuploid (and likely diploid) spores must be manifest during spore formation, spore germination, or the first few mitotic divisions after germination. Testing this model and other alternatives will require identification of the loci responsible for drive. Regardless of their mechanism(s) of action, the meiotic drive alleles we identified contribute significantly to hybrid spore death (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>). <i>Sk</i> alleles are preferentially found in the viable spores, whereas <i>Sp</i> alleles are presumably enriched amongst the dead spores."

In both these scenarios, a chromosomal rearrangement could spread to fixation within a population without ever undergoing meiosis in a heterozygous state.

These are strains SZY147, SZY240 and SZY302, respectively, in <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Supplemental file 1</a>. We inferred the chromosome composition of these strains using <i>lys1</i>, <i>his5,</i> and <i>ade6</i> alleles and their meiotic phenotypes. The PKK strain contains the <i>Sp</i> allele of <i>lys1</i> (on chromosome 1) and the <i>Sk</i> alleles of <i>his5</i> (on chromosome 2) and <i>ade6</i> (on chromosome 3). The KRK strain contains the <i>Sp</i> allele of <i>his5</i> and the <i>Sk</i> alleles of <i>lys1</i> and <i>ade6</i>. The KKR strain inherited the <i>Sk</i> alleles of <i>lys1</i> and <i>his5</i>, but the <i>Sp</i> allele of <i>ade6</i>. However, in these last two strains, we reasoned that chromosome 2, chromosome 3 or both must be recombinant because the strains are viable (<i>Sp</i> and <i>Sk</i> chromosomes 2 and 3 are incompatible due to the translocation of essential genes). For clarity, we denote the third chromosome of KKR (and the second chromosome of KRK) as recombinant because they display the <i>Sp</i> meiotic phenotype (transmission to less than half of the spores) when crossed to <i>Sk</i>, whereas the others display the <i>Sk</i> meiotic phenotype (transmission to half of the spores) when crossed to <i>Sk</i>. We reasoned the KRK and KKR must have the <i>Sk</i> karyotype because all chromosomes were compatible with na\u00efve <i>Sk</i> chromosomes. To test our assumptions about where these stains\u2019 chromosomes were recombinant, we sequenced SZY302 and SZY240.

Genic incompatibilities, chromosomal rearrangements and genome doubling all provide avenues towards interspecific incompatibility. In this manuscript, a veritable tour de force, Zanders and colleagues dissect the genetic incompatibilities between the <i>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</i> (<i>Sp</i>) and <i>S. kambucha</i> (<i>Sk</i>) species, which differ in only 0.5% of their nuclear genome sequence. The authors go to great length, including the experimental analysis of DSB initiation hot spots, to ensure that sequence-based differences in recombination are not major contributors to incompatibility between the species. Instead, they find that despite the close sequence similarity, there are several major chromosome rearrangement that greatly reduce the fraction of viable spores. Similarly, the authors exclude that classic BDM incompatibilities are major contributors to interspecific incompatibility. Instead, they suggest that meiotic drive, with causal loci on each of the three chromosomes, is important. Provided that the latter conclusion holds up (see below), this study will speak to a wide readership, including scientists interested in speciation, unorthodox genetics, and the bizarre world of meiotic drivers."

Since there appears to be one on each chromosome, this makes an extremely potent barrier to gene flow compared to most drive systems, where usually only a single chromosome is affected. Second, the translocation that switches two essential genes functionally spreads the effects of two of the drivers onto a different chromosome. This would likely be the first description among drivers of an effect on viability that necessitates the co-segregation of two distinct chromosomes from the driving genotype."

The hallmark of a driver locus is that is increases its allele frequency faster than would be possible under classic Mendelian segregation combined with drift, but not due to selective forces (1:1 ratio in <i>Sp</i> x <i>Sk</i> crosses). Distorted Mendelian ratios in female meiosis are more easily assessed than in the exclusively male-like meiosis of <i>Schizosaccharomyces</i>. It is therefore difficult to discriminate between hybrid infertility/inviability and meiotic drive in male-like meiosis. For one, it is still unclear at what point during <i>Sp</i> x <i>Sk</i> crossing hybrid incompatibility occurs."

Aneuploid tolerating mutants have been described in yeast (Torres et al 2010; Tange et al 2012). There is also the possibility of incompatibility between essential genes or loss of an essential gene due to the translocation, inversion or mutations (every 200th bp is different between <i>Sp</i> and <i>Sk</i>). Also, it cannot be ignored that dosage compensation could account for aneuploidy in <i>Sp</i> x <i>Sk</i> crosses. Finally, from both classical (B)DM models and Lenski's LTEE, a role for epistasis has emerged as a potential speciation factor. For example, the observed link between alleles on chromosomes 2 and 3 could be attributed to epistasis."

We have increased the discussion of this possibility and clarified the distinction between traditional \u2018meiotic drive\u2019 and \u2018post-meiotic dysfunction\u2019 that is colloquially referred to as meiotic drive. Formally, aneuploidy susceptibility can be a means of imposing meiotic drive, but in additional evidence we present in our revisions, we show that this explanation cannot be the mechanism for the drivers we have uncovered on chromosome 1 and 2. Because chromosome 3 can tolerate aneuploidy, we cannot rule out aneuploidy as a mechanism for chromosome 3 drive. Although these drivers likely arose independently under a more typical scenario for spread of meiotic drivers, their joint action is what leads to the near complete sterility in the <i>Sp/Sk</i> hybrids."

This general concept has, however, been taken to include transmissional anomalies that are not strictly meiotic, but with similar populational consequences [see, for example, Lewontin]; this extended meaning seems justified and thus the more general definition will be used in this review.\u201c"

For instance, in the PKK x KKK cross, we observe an over-representation of the K1 chromosome of 65%, and a spore yield of roughly 80% of a conspecific KKK x KKK cross. Thus, K1 drive would fit the criteria required for a driver on chromosome 1 to increase in frequency by virtue of transmission distortion. We have similarly noted the ability for drivers on both chromosome 2 and 3 to independently drive, and meet the traditionally defined mathematical criteria for drive. We propose that each of these drivers arose independently or sequentially but it is their joint action (a circumstance under which drive did not originate) that leads to the near complete hybrid infertility, which would preclude the evolutionary success of either driver. Although we had a truncated discussion of this point, we have expanded this in our revision."

For this, we re-analyzed the chromosome 1 and 2 allele transmission data from the <i>rec12</i><sup><i>+</i></sup> <i>Sk/Sp</i> hybrid diploids, sorting them into two classes: aneuploid spores, and haploid spores. If the drive phenotypes of these two chromosomes we observed were related to the aneuploidy phenotype, the drive phenotype would be manifest primarily in the aneuploid spores. Instead, we observed strong drive of an allele on each chromosome in both the aneuploid and haploid spores. This experiment has been added to the text and the data are now displayed in <a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2013figure supplement 2</a>. In addition, the experiments presented in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a> (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7</a> in previous version) provide further support that the drive we observe of Sk chromosomes 1 and 2 (and the associated spore death) is independent of the aneuploidy phenotype. In these experiments we show that P1 K2 K3/K1 K2 K3 and K1 R2 K3/K1 K2 K3 diploids exhibit meiotic drive of K1 and K2, respectively. However, the level of aneuploid spores produced in these crosses is not higher than that in the Sk/Sk control. We have added text to the section describing these experiments to add the conclusion that the drive of Sk chromosomes 1 and 2 is not causally related to the aneuploidy phenotype. In contrast to chromosomes 1 and 2, we cannot robustly rule out that the aneuploidy phenotype may be related to drive on chromosome 3, partly because aneuploidy for chromosome 3 is viable in Sp and Sk."
