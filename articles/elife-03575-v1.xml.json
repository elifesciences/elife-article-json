Expressing a gene involves multiple steps: the DNA must be transcribed into a molecule of messenger RNA, which is then translated into a protein. The mechanisms that start the transcription of protein-coding genes in rapidly growing cells are reasonably well understood: two types of proteins\u2014DNA-binding activators and general transcription factors\u2014cooperate to recruit an enzyme called RNA polymerase, which then transcribes the gene (<a href=\"#bib5\">Kadonaga, 2012</a>). These proteins bind to a region of the gene called the promoter, which is upstream from the protein-coding region of the gene."

The core transcriptional machinery is essentially rebuilt at the genes that are expressed in differentiated cells; however, how this occurs is a fascinating and largely unresolved question."

Now, in <i>eLife</i>, Francisco Herrera of UC Berkeley and co-workers\u2014including Teppei Yamaguchi, Henk Roelink and Tjian\u2014have identified a critical role for a TAF called TAF9B in the expression of genes in motor neurons (<a href=\"#bib4\">Herrera et al., 2014</a>). When mouse embryonic stem cells were coaxed, in vitro, into becoming the motor neurons, TAF9B was selectively up-regulated. Herrera et al. also observed high levels of TAF9B in the spinal cord tissue of newborn mice. Deleting the gene for TAF9B in mouse embryonic stem cells revealed that this TAF is not needed for the growth of stem cells, nor is it required for the expression of genes that prevent differentiation: both of these processes are known to be highly-dependent upon the TFIID complex (<a href=\"#bib8\">Pijnappel et al., 2013</a>). However, genes that would normally be expressed specifically in neurons were not up-regulated when cells without the <i>TAF9B</i> gene started to specialise."

Further studies revealed that TAF9B activates neuron-specific genes by binding to sites that reside outside of these genes' core promoters. Further, many of these sites were also bound by a master regulator of motor neuron-specific genes. Herrera et al. found that TAF9B predominantly associates with the SAGA complex, rather than the TFIID complex, in the motor neuron cells. Mice in which the gene for TAF9B had been deleted had less neuronal tissue in the developing spinal cord. Moreover, the genes that are involved in forming the branches of neurons were not properly regulated in these mice."

TAF7L was specifically required to activate genes that control how brown fat develops and functions. Thus TAF7L expression appears to shift the fate of a stem cell towards brown adipose tissue, potentially at the expense of skeletal muscle, as both cell types develop from the same group of stem cells. When stem cells with less TAF7L than normal are differentiated in vitro, they yield more muscle than fat cells. Conversely, cells with an excess of TAF7L express brown fat-specific genes and switch off muscle-specific genes. Further experiments suggested a role for TAF7L in connecting the core promoter of the gene with other DNA elements that regulate gene expression but lie some distance away from the promoter."

However many interesting questions remain: which signals lead to the destruction of core transcription factors? Are core promoter elements at tissue-specific genes designed to recognise variant TAFs? What determines whether variant TAFs are incorporated within TFIID, SAGA, or other complexes? It is known that TAF7 functions within TFIID to prevent transcription starting prematurely (<a href=\"#bib2\">Bhattacharya et al., 2014</a>): does the TAF7L variant carry out a similar function at adipose tissue-specific genes?"

Consequently, TAF6 and TAF9 might be involved in pausing transcription<b>,</b> and if so, the variant TAF9B could play a similar role at motor neuron genes. Exploring the different patterns of gene expression in differentiated cells provides a powerful approach to help us to understand the logic of transcription."
