The anatomical connectivity between rod bipolar and A17 amacrine cells in the mammalian retina, specifically that neighboring A17s often receive input from many of the same rod bipolar cells, provides a rare technical opportunity to measure cross-synaptic synchrony under physiological conditions. This approach reveals that synchronization of rod bipolar cell synapses is near perfect in the dark and decreases with increasing light level. Strong synaptic synchronization in the dark minimizes intrinsic synaptic noise and allows rod bipolar cells to faithfully transmit upstream signal and noise to downstream neurons. Desynchronization in steady light lowers the sensitivity of the rod bipolar output to upstream voltage fluctuations. This work reveals how cross-synaptic synchrony shapes retinal responses to physiological light inputs and, more generally, signaling in complex neural networks."

The anatomical connectivity between rod bipolar and A17 amacrine cells in the mammalian retina, specifically that neighboring A17s often receive input from many of the same rod bipolar cells, provides a rare technical opportunity to measure cross-synaptic synchrony under physiological conditions. This approach reveals that synchronization of rod bipolar cell synapses is near perfect in the dark and decreases with increasing light level. Strong synaptic synchronization in the dark minimizes intrinsic synaptic noise and allows rod bipolar cells to faithfully transmit upstream signal and noise to downstream neurons. Desynchronization in steady light lowers the sensitivity of the rod bipolar output to upstream voltage fluctuations. This work reveals how cross-synaptic synchrony shapes retinal responses to physiological light inputs and, more generally, signaling in complex neural networks."

For example, the strength of network correlations generated by divergent synaptic output from a single presynaptic neuron depends directly on CSS. Similarly, if CSS is high, multiple parallel synapses between a pre- and postsynaptic neuron can enhance transmission of upstream noise and mitigate the impact of intrinsic synaptic noise. Circuits using graded signals or action potentials share these issues because the small number of vesicles associated with transmission of physiological signals cause synaptic release to vary even for nominally fixed presynaptic signals such as action potentials (<a href=\"#bib12\">Del Castillo and Katz, 1954</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Allen and Stevens, 1994</a>)."

Rod bipolar cells (RBCs) provide a key component of this circuit; they receive dendritic input exclusively from rods, and provide output to several types of amacrine cells via anatomically distinct and stereotypic connections (<a href=\"#bib37\">Nelson and Kolb, 1984</a>; <a href=\"#bib57\">Tsukamoto and Omi, 2013</a>). Here, we exploit the distinct anatomical features of these connections to quantitatively characterize the role of cross-synaptic synchrony in retinal signaling at low light levels. We find that RBC output synapses can exhibit near-perfect synchronization for small physiological changes in presynaptic voltage such as those encountered near visual threshold.

Substantial dark correlations were present in pairs with the highest resistance (&gt;15 G\u03a9), suggesting at most a small contribution from electrical coupling. We did not attempt to eliminate electrical coupling using genetic manipulations because the connexins forming gap junctions between A17s have not been identified. However, pharmacological experiments described below (see section \u2018Redundant connections and CSS scale dark noise transmission\u2019) provide additional evidence for little contribution of gap junctions to correlations in A17 signals. Contributions from upstream divergence were also minimal, as revealed by direct recordings from pairs of RBCs with touching somas (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C,D</a>). Spontaneous excitatory synaptic input to neighboring RBCs was at most weakly correlated in darkness (0.03 \u00b1 0.02, n = 6; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E</a>), indicating minimal correlations in the signals of neighboring RBCs due to rod divergence.

First, synaptic failures and other sources of variability at individual synapses must be minimized; a full complement of releasable vesicles and multi-vesicular release likely contribute to minimizing intrinsic synaptic variability at individual RBC synapses (see \u2018Discussion\u2019). Second, different RBC synapses must experience common fluctuations in release probability so that they become coactive. Fluctuations in the dendritic synaptic input to RBCs from rod photoreceptors and consequent fluctuations in RBC voltage could cause release probability to covary. The pharmacological experiments described below support this proposal."

Indeed, antagonist concentrations could be identified that produced postsynaptic holding currents, and hence RBC synaptic release rates, near those in darkness (dashed lines in <a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A,B</a>). Similar agonist/antagonist mixtures maintained the mean RBC voltage while suppressing both light responses and dark noise (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). This manipulation, however, did not restore noise in the inputs to AII and A17 amacrine cells to its dark level; the suppression of noise was particularly clear in the AII inputs (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5C</a>). Thus similar release rates (dark vs appropriate agonist/antagonist mixture) can produce very different levels of synaptic noise. The larger change in variance of the AII inputs compared to the A17 inputs is consistent with the differences in connectivity and a role of CSS in causing small changes in RBC voltage to produce large changes in AII input (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>)."

Correlations in the A17 signals produced by gap junctions should hence be insensitive to decreasing the total noise in the A17 signals by suppressing fluctuations in RBC input as the same fraction of noise should remain correlated. The sensitivity of correlation strength to decreasing RBC voltage fluctuations pharmacologically indicates that gap junctions play at most a modest role in producing correlations, confirming the importance of synchrony across RBC synapses."

Redundant connections between RBCs and AII amacrine cells and high CSS at these connections provide key elements of such amplification. With increasing light level, the rod bipolar pathway ceases to be the sole route for signals to traverse the retina, as rod and cone signals are conveyed to ganglion cells through the cone bipolar circuits (<a href=\"#bib60\">Xin and Bloomfield, 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Deans et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Trexler et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Manookin et al., 2008</a>).

We found that synchrony across different RBC output synapses was very strong in the dark, such that \u223c80% of the vesicle release events occurring at different ribbons within the same RBC axon terminal were synchronous. The high level of cross-synaptic synchrony caused noise in the synaptic inputs to AII amacrine cells to be dominated by noise generated in the rod photoreceptors rather than noise generated at the RBC output synapse itself. As light level increased, conditions under which other retinal circuits become active (<a href=\"#bib31\">Manookin et al., 2008</a>), vesicle release at the RBC\u2192AII synapse transitioned from high CSS to low CSS, thus limiting transmission of upstream signals and noise.

Our work here details how the operation of synapses between RBCs and AII amacrine cells maximizes sensitivity to upstream activity while minimizing added noise in darkness. Specifically, highly synchronized vesicle release across parallel RBC output synapses amplifies RBC voltage fluctuations produced by rod signals and noise while minimizing added synaptic noise. Quite surprisingly, achieving the estimated dark CSS of 0.8 requires that the dark fluctuations in RBC voltage produce near-deterministic changes in vesicle release at individual synapses (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A</a>). Multiple release sites at each ribbon synapse (each RBC ribbon has \u223c10 active zones; <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8B</a>), high vesicle availability and postsynaptic receptor saturation (<a href=\"#bib53\">Tong and Jahr, 1994</a>) (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>) will facilitate low synaptic variability. The low rate of ongoing release in darkness compared to that in the presence of steady light ensures that the readily releasable vesicle pool in the RBC terminal remains full (<a href=\"#bib49\">Singer and Diamond, 2006</a>), an important component of strong synaptic synchronization. These results highlight that the RBC output synapses operate far from a regime in which vesicle release follows Poisson statistics, and this is important for their ability to reliably transmit the small signals forming the basis of night vision."

Over a substantial range of light levels, visual signals elicit simultaneous activity in rod and cone photoreceptors and their associated circuitry (<a href=\"#bib36\">Naarendorp et al., 2010</a>). These parallel signals are combined through several shared circuit elements (e.g., AII amacrine cells) before they are transmitted to targets in the central nervous system. Efficient transmission of noisy rod signals through the rod bipolar pathway could jeopardize cone signals under these conditions. As luminance increases the RBC depolarizes, eventually evoking synaptic depression by way of vesicle depletion and Ca<sub>v</sub> inactivation (<a href=\"#bib49\">Singer and Diamond, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Jarsky et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Oesch and Diamond, 2011</a>), mechanisms that likely underlie the decrease in cross-synaptic synchrony we observe here.

To account for the effects of slicing in our calculations, we divided the number of contacted RBCs within a given ring by two (except for the first ring).

The main experimental design takes advantage of an anatomical observation that each A17 amacrine cell receives only one synaptic input from a particular RBC. This allowed the authors to measure the correlation between two neighboring A17s, and use it as an estimate of the correlation that results from two different synapses located in the same RBC. They then went on and calculated the CSS and evaluated correlation in the next cell order (RGCs). The conclusions are quite striking. In very low light levels different synaptic sites on the same retinal bipolar cell show highly correlated releases, almost deterministic/synchronous. Presumably this arises from voltage fluctuations in the terminals that are shared amongst release sites and have strong effects on release probability. As a result, noise at individual synaptic sites is diminished in favor of a concerted noise generated in the bipolar cell as a result of its responses to rod input. An interesting downstream result of this is that releases of glutamate and of glycine onto ganglion cells also show a shared pattern of noise. As light levels increase, such correlations, i.e., sensitivity to bipolar cells voltage fluctuation, decreases."
