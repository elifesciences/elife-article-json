However, little is known about when and how individual endothelial cell (EC) responds to angiogenic inputs in vivo. Here, we visualized endothelial Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics in zebrafish and found that intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations occurred in ECs exhibiting angiogenic behavior. Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations depended upon VEGF receptor-2 (Vegfr2) and Vegfr3 in ECs budding from the dorsal aorta (DA) and posterior cardinal vein, respectively. Thus, visualizing Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations allowed us to monitor EC responses to angiogenic cues. Vegfr-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations occurred in migrating tip cells as well as stalk cells budding from the DA. We investigated how Dll4/Notch signaling regulates endothelial Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations and found that it was required for the selection of single stalk cell as well as tip cell. Thus, we captured spatio-temporal Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics during sprouting angiogenesis, as a result of cellular responses to angiogenic inputs."

However, little is known about when and how individual endothelial cell (EC) responds to angiogenic inputs in vivo. Here, we visualized endothelial Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics in zebrafish and found that intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations occurred in ECs exhibiting angiogenic behavior. Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations depended upon VEGF receptor-2 (Vegfr2) and Vegfr3 in ECs budding from the dorsal aorta (DA) and posterior cardinal vein, respectively. Thus, visualizing Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations allowed us to monitor EC responses to angiogenic cues. Vegfr-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations occurred in migrating tip cells as well as stalk cells budding from the DA. We investigated how Dll4/Notch signaling regulates endothelial Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations and found that it was required for the selection of single stalk cell as well as tip cell. Thus, we captured spatio-temporal Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics during sprouting angiogenesis, as a result of cellular responses to angiogenic inputs."

Now, Yokota, Nakajima et al. have investigated VEGF activity by genetically engineering zebrafish embryos so that fluorescent proteins inside their endothelial cells emit more light when calcium ion levels inside the cell increase. As zebrafish embryos are transparent, this change in fluorescence can be seen in the living animal. Imaging the embryos revealed that calcium ion oscillations occur in both tip and stalk cells in response to VEGF signaling as they bud from vessels. Notch signaling can also regulate the calcium ion oscillations; this controls whether an individual cell becomes a tip or a stalk cell, and restricts the number of stalk cells in the sprout."

Such branched structures of blood vessels form mainly by sprouting angiogenesis, which involves the emergence of new vessels from the pre-existing vasculature (<a href=\"#bib8\">Eilken and Adams, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Herbert and Stainier, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Phng and Gerhardt, 2009</a>). In the early steps of sprouting angiogenesis, specific motile endothelial cells (ECs) activated by angiogenic cues become leading tip cells and migrate outward from the parental vessels (<a href=\"#bib13\">Gerhardt et al., 2003</a>). As the tip cell migrates from the parental vessel, neighboring ECs migrate by following the tip cell as stalk cells to keep connection between the tip cell and the parental vessel. While tip cells guide the sprouts, stalk cells constitute the base of the sprouts and are, therefore, considered to be less active than tip cells."

During sprouting angiogenesis, Dll4/Notch signaling between ECs determines the selection of single tip cells among ECs of the pre-existing vessel by restricting the angiogenic behavior of neighboring ECs (<a href=\"#bib15\">Hellstr\u00f6m, et al., 2007</a>). In studies using mouse and zebrafish, loss of Dll4/Notch signaling results in an increased number of ECs showing tip cell behavior (<a href=\"#bib15\">Hellstr\u00f6m, et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib26\">Leslie et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Siekmann and Lawson, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Suchting et al., 2007</a>). While VEGF-A/VEGFR2 signaling and Dll4/Notch signaling have opposing roles in regulating blood vessel sprouting, they are tightly linked in a negative feedback loop. VEGFR2 activation in tip cells leads to an up-regulation of the Notch ligand Dll4 and subsequent activation of Notch signaling in the following stalk cells (<a href=\"#bib28\">Lobov et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Suchting et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Zarkada et al., 2015</a>).

We conducted in vivo Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging by expressing a genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator, GCaMP7a (GFP-based Ca<sup>2+</sup> probe) (<a href=\"#bib34\">Muto et al., 2013</a>) in ECs of zebrafish. GCaMP7a is an improved version of GCaMP (<a href=\"#bib35\">Nakai et al., 2001</a>), an engineered GFP that increases fluorescence upon the Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). Firstly, we established a transgenic fish line, <i>Tg(fli1:Gal4FF);(UAS:GCaMP7a)</i>, in which GCaMP7a was driven by the endothelial specific promoter <i>fli1</i> via the Gal4/UAS system (<a href=\"#bib2\">Asakawa et al., 2008</a>). This Tg line showed an increase of fluorescence exclusively in ECs in response to Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). Secondly, to distinguish each EC, we developed a Tg fish line, <i>Tg(fli1:H2B-mC)</i>, in which EC nuclei was labeled by H2B-mCherry, and crossed this line with the <i>Tg(fli1:Gal4FF);(UAS:GCaMP7a)</i> line. We confirmed that almost all ECs expressed GCaMP7a in developing trunk vessels of these triple Tg embryos (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>), although the expression of GCaMP7a varied among ECs. To monitor fast Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics in ECs (see <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B,C</a>), we used a light sheet microscopy, which allows rapid acquisitions in living embryos by illuminating the sample with a focused light sheet perpendicularly to the direction of observation (<a href=\"#bib18\">Huisken et al., 2004</a>)."

We defined these budding ECs as tip cells, because we confirmed that they eventually became tip cells. These tip cells showed sustained and non-periodic Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B</a>, <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B,C</a> and <a href=\"#media1\">Video 1</a>). To avoid missing the fast Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations by taking z-axis images, we performed the time-lapse 2D imaging and confirmed that Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations could be observed at more than every min (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B,C</a>). In every oscillation, a Ca<sup>2+</sup> spike occurs throughout the cytoplasm (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>). The time to reach the peak of individual oscillations was varied 5.6\u201318.7\u2009s (average, 9.0\u2009s) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). Therefore, hereafter we performed 3D\u00a0time-lapse imaging analyses at 5\u2009s\u00a0intervals to capture all Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations. Intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels of individual ECs were quantified at each time point by measuring fluorescence intensity of GCaMP7a, while tracking H2B-mC-labelled cell nuclei over time (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2D</a>; see Materials and methods). We analyzed Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations by the frequency and average increases in relative fluorescence intensity of GCaMP7a from the base line (mean \u0394F/F<sub>0</sub>). Frequency of Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations is elevated by increased levels of agonists in some cases in ECs (<a href=\"#bib6\">Carter et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Jacob et al., 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Moccia et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Mumtaz et al., 2011</a>) and non-ECs (<a href=\"#bib49\">Woods et al., 1986</a>). Meanwhile, the amplitude of Ca<sup>2+</sup> rise and total Ca<sup>2+</sup> increases may possibly reflect the dose of agonists (<a href=\"#bib4\">Brock et al., 1991</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Fewtrell, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Sage et al., 1989</a>). Thus, in this study, we quantified the oscillations to describe the oscillatory activity in individual EC (see \u2018Materials and methods\u2019). Our quantification analyses clearly revealed that budding tip cells exhibited oscillatory activity at 24\u201327 ss (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D,E</a>). Repetitive Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients were not detected in other ECs within the DA (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A,B,D</a>). These results indicate that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging method we used precisely detects the endogenous intracellular increase or decrease of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in vivo."

                                "text": "Intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations are known to occur in response to physiological concentrations of agonists in vitro in many cell types (<a href=\"#bib11\">Fewtrell, 1993</a>; <a href=\"#bib49\">Woods et al., 1986</a>) including ECs (<a href=\"#bib19\">Jacob et al., 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Moccia et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Sage et al., 1989</a>), suggesting that Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations detected here may represent EC response to angiogenic stimuli. To examine which angiogenic stimuli are responsible for Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations during vessel sprouting from the DA, we first tested the involvement of Vegfr2 since VEGF-A/VEGFR2 signaling is essential for sprouting angiogenesis (<a href=\"#bib22\">Koch and Claesson-Welsh, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Lohela et al., 2009</a>) and can increase intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>in vitro (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>) (<a href=\"#bib4\">Brock et al., 1991</a>). Firstly, we examined the effect of inhibiting Vegfr2 on Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations by using an inhibitor of VEGFR2, ki8751 (<a href=\"#bib23\">Kubo et al., 2005</a>). When we treated 22 ss embryos with ki8751 and performed Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging analyses at 24\u201327 ss, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations detected in budding tip cells of control embryos (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>) were completely abolished by the treatment of ki8751 (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A\u2013C</a>). Tip cell migration stopped in ki8751-treated embryos (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>), confirming that ki8751 inhibits Vegfr2 of zebrafish. ki8751 might also inhibit Vegfr3 activity, because, in our previous results, ki8751 treatment blocked Vegfr3-dependent venous sprout from the PCV in zebrafish (<a href=\"#bib24\">Kwon et al., 2013</a>). Therefore, we regarded ki8751 as a zebrafish Vegfr inhibitor in this study. To confirm the specific contribution of Vegfr2 in budding ECs from the DA to Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillation there, we knocked-down <i>vegfr2</i> (also termed <i>kdrl</i>) by injecting antisense oligonucleotides (MO) (<a href=\"#bib48\">Wiley et al., 2011</a>). Although we observed partial sprouts from the DA in the morphants as reported in <i>vegfr2</i> mutants (<a href=\"#bib7\">Covassin et al., 2006</a>), Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations were markedly reduced in these budding cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D\u2013F</a>), suggesting that Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations in ECs budding from the DA are dependent upon Vegfr2 activation."

Since ISV sprouts emerge bilaterally from the DA, we analyzed one side of sprouting ISVs. When ECs within the DA started to sprout dorsally (19\u201322 ss), Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations were detected in two neighboring ECs (45.2%) or single ECs (52.4%) at somite boundaries, either of which sprouted dorsally (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We confirmed that two neighboring ECs were not the result of a recent division (86%, n = 7, data not shown). These results suggest that the initial selection of single tip cells is not completed just after the onset of vessel sprouting. Ca<sup>2+</sup> response became restricted to single tip cells at later stage (24\u201327 ss) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>), suggesting the completion of tip cell selection. Then, to visualize the process of tip cell selection between two neighboring cells exhibiting Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations, we performed Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging for a longer period and found that only one cell maintained the oscillations over time (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B,C</a> and <a href=\"#media3\">Video 3</a>). We also noticed that the ECs losing Ca<sup>2+</sup> response retracted their sprout (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>), implying that these cells lost their ability to respond to angiogenic cues. The ECs showing sustained Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations eventually became tip cells (18/18, <a href=\"#fig4s2\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

We generated a dominant-negative Vegfr2 by deleting the C-terminus of zebrafish Vegfr2 (Vegfr2-\u0394C) (<a href=\"#bib30\">Millauer et al., 1994</a>). Firstly, to validate whether Vegfr2-\u0394C can block Vegfa/Vegfr2 signaling in zebrafish ECs, we established a Tg fish line, <i>Tg(fli1:Gal4ff);(UAS:Vegfr2-\u0394C,NLS-mC),</i> that expresses Vegfr2-\u0394C simultaneously with NLS-mC in ECs. In primary culture cells dissociated from the Tg embryos, Vegfaa-induced Erk phosphorylation was blocked in the Vegfr2-\u0394C-expressing ECs (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>; Vegfr2-\u0394C+NLS-mC). In contrast, in the cells dissociated from the control <i>Tg(fli1:Gal4ff);(UAS:NLS-mC)</i> embryos that expressed NLS-mC alone in ECs, the Erk phosphorylation was not blocked (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A,B</a>; NLS-mC). These results confirmed that Vegfaa/Vegfr2 signaling is blocked by Vegfr2-\u0394C expression. Consistently, ISV sprouting was blocked in the Tg embryos expressing Vegfr2-\u0394C in ECs. We, then, observed the behavior of ECs expressing Vegfr2-\u0394C in a mosaic manner by injecting the plasmids expressing Vegfr2-\u0394C at one-cell stage. While expression of NLS-mC alone neither affect tip, stalk, nor DA cells (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C,D</a>; NLS-mC), the cells expressing both Vegfr2-\u0394C and NLS-mC rarely became tip and stalk cells and remained in the DA (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6C,D</a>; Vegfr2-\u0394C+NLS-mC). These results suggest that the activation of Vegfr2 in tip cells and stalk cells is crucial for their exit from the DA."

To investigate whether Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations were due to either mechanism, we measured how often the oscillations in tip or stalk cells were synchronized with adjacent stalk or tip cells, respectively. We found that 78.9% of Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations in stalk cells occurred independently of tip cells, and 91.6% of oscillations in tip cells occurred independently of stalk cells (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>). These results clearly indicate that most Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations observed in tip and stalk cells occurs independently of each other and not through ICWs. Therefore, our findings suggest that not only tip cells but also stalk cells have potential to respond to angiogenic cues (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7E</a>). Similarly to the earlier stage, Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations were not detected in the ECs within the DA (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A\u2013C</a>), except in ECs that were budding from the DA and following stalk cells (<a href=\"#fig7s2\">Figure 7\u2014figure supplement 2</a>)."

                                "text": "To understand how tip cell behavior is spatio-temporally regulated by Dll4/Notch signaling, we examined the effect of the inhibition of Dll4/Notch signaling on Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics. Previous reports have shown that MO-mediated knockdown of Dll4 leads to an increased number of ECs exhibiting tip cell behavior in zebrafish ISVs, which phenocopies loss of Notch signaling (<a href=\"#bib39\">Siekmann and Lawson, 2007</a>). Therefore, we analyzed Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations before and during vessel sprouting in <i>dll4</i> morphants (<a href=\"#bib39\">Siekmann and Lawson, 2007</a>). Before sprouting of ISVs, the number of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-oscillating ECs and their oscillatory activity were significantly increased in the entire DA in <i>dll4</i> morphants (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8A\u2013C</a>), suggesting that Dll4 suppresses the Vegfr2-dependent angiogenic responses in entire ECs of the DA. When ECs start budding at 19\u201322 ss, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses were restricted to single ECs in 44.5% at somite boundaries in the control morphants, whereas those were, in 20.8% in <i>dll4</i> morphants (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A;</a> 19\u201322 ss). Most <i>dll4</i> morphants had two or more budding ECs exhibiting Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations (79.2%; <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A;</a> 19\u201322 ss). Thus, our findings support the hypothesis that Dll4 restricts the number of ECs showing tip cell behavior when they sprout from the pre-existing vessels. In the later stages (24\u201327 ss), while the Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses became restricted to single tip cells in the control embryos, two or more neighboring ECs exhibited Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations in <i>dll4</i> morphants (74.1%; <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A;</a> 24\u201327 ss). Consistently in the <i>dll4</i> morphants, repetitive Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations were maintained in the two neighboring ECs, both of which were budding from the DA (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B,C</a> and <a href=\"#media6\">Video 6</a>). Similar results were observed in <i>notch1b</i> morphants (<a href=\"#fig9s1\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). These results suggest that Dll4/Notch signaling regulates the selection of single tip cell from two or more ECs showing Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillation. In <i>dll4</i> morphants, Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses were detected exclusively in budding ECs, but not in other ECs within the DA (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9D</a>), suggesting that Dll4 suppresses the tip cell behavior especially in ECs adjacent to budding tip cells, but not in the entire DA after tip cell budding."

Treatment with ki8751 completely abolished the Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations observed in the <i>dll4</i> morphants (<a href=\"#fig9s2\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), suggesting that an increase in the number of oscillating cells in the <i>dll4</i> morphants reflects an increase in the number of ECs showing either Vegfr2 or Vegfr3 activation. In zebrafish, arterial overproliferation and hypersprouting in the absence of Dll4/Notch signaling is, at least partially, attributed to ectopically enhanced Vegfr3 activation (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hogan et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Siekmann and Lawson, 2007</a>). Accordingly, Vegfr3 might be involved in the ectopic Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations during vessel sprouting in <i>dll4</i> morphant. To assess the contribution of Vegfr3 to the ectopic Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations, we examined Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations in <i>vegfr3/dll4</i> double morphants at 24\u201327 ss when the Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses became restricted to single tip cells in wild-type embryos (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). In <i>vegfr3/dll4</i> double morphants, Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations were detected in two or more neighboring cells in 65.8% at somite boundaries (<a href=\"#fig9s3\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 3</a>), although the phenotype in the double morphants was slightly milder than that in the <i>dll4</i> morphants (74.1%; <a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>; 24\u201327 ss). Thus, Vegfr3 is partially involved in increases in oscillating cells in the absence of Dll4/Notch signaling. On the other hand, these results imply that ectopic Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations occur even in the absence of <i>vegfr3</i> after inhibiting Dll4/Notch signaling. Considering that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses in <i>dll4</i> morphants were completely abolished by ki8751 treatment (<a href=\"#fig9s2\">Figure 9\u2014figure supplement 2</a>), our findings suggest that Dll4/Notch signaling might restrict the tip cell number mainly by suppressing Vegfr2 signaling. Since Vegfr3 is responsible for hypersprouting of ISVs in the dorsal part of the <i>dll4</i> morphants (<a href=\"#bib17\">Hogan et al., 2009</a>), Dll4/Notch signaling might not suppress Vegfr3 signaling in the early stage but suppress it in the later stage."

Of note, when stalk cells began to migrate from the DA, Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations were mainly detected only in single stalk cells in the DA, but not in adjacent cells apart from tip cells (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10A</a>). Because Dll4/Notch signaling regulates the selection of single tip cells (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9</a>) (<a href=\"#bib8\">Eilken and Adams, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Lohela et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Phng and Gerhardt, 2009</a>), we hypothesized that it might also regulate the selection of single stalk cell. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effect of knockdown of Dll4 on Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics during stalk cell budding. While Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations were mostly detected in single stalk cell in the control embryos, they were often detected in two or more neighboring ECs following tip cells in <i>dll4</i> morphants (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10A\u2013D</a>). Longer time-lapse imaging confirmed that both Ca<sup>2+</sup>-oscillating stalk cell in the <i>dll4</i> morphants eventually came out from the DA to form the ISVs. These results suggest that Dll4/Notch signaling regulates the selection of single stalk cell by restricting angiogenic behavior in the ECs adjacent to the stalk cells."

Dll4/Notch signaling is required for the selection of single tip cells. During stalk cell budding, tip cells and stalk cells exhibit Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations, although the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-oscillatory activity in stalk cells is weaker than that in tip cells.

Since intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations generally occur through the concerted action between several Ca<sup>2+</sup> transporters (<a href=\"#bib40\">Smedler and Uhlen, 2014</a>), further studies are needed to delineate whether Vegfr2 signaling directly regulates Ca<sup>2+</sup> store or Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels in ECs in vivo. Furthermore, it is also required to detect where intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> increases during sprouting angiogenesis. Although we observed an increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> throughout the cytoplasm, if ECs respond to Vegfa, the initial increase of Ca<sup>2+</sup> might be found in a manner dependent upon the distribution of Vegfr2. In cultured ECs, they exhibit Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations only in the front of the cells but not in the rear during migration (<a href=\"#bib46\">Tsai et al., 2014</a>).

We found that stalk cells have Vegfr-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations when they start budding following tip cells and that Dll4/Notch signaling is required for the selection of single stalk cell similarly to tip cell selection (<a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12</a>). VEGF-A/VEGFR2 signaling is active in stalk cells and is important for cell proliferation in mouse retina angiogenesis (<a href=\"#bib13\">Gerhardt et al., 2003</a>). Here, we propose that Vegfr2 activation in stalk cells is also necessary for the selection of stalk cells and their exit from the parental vessels during ISV formation.

Our results indicate that inhibitory activity of Dll4 toward Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses in stalk cells diminishes after stalk cells come out from the DA. Instead, Dll4/Notch signaling restricts the number of stalk cells. Thus, our results suggest that Dll4/Notch-mediated lateral inhibition leads to suppression of angiogenic responses mainly in ECs within the DA adjacent to budding tip or stalk cells to restrict excess budding from the DA (<a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12</a>).

Time-lapse images were collected every 5\u2009s for 1000\u20132000\u2009s with a z-interval of 4 \u03bcm. Z-stack images were 3D volume-rendered and analyzed with IMARIS 7.7.1 software (Bitplane AG). ISV sprouts emerge bilaterally from the DA. Thus, to focus on sprouting angiogenesis occurring on one side, our analyses were performed at either side (left or right side) of the embryos by cropping. To quantify intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels of individual ECs at each time point, the cell nuclei labeled with H2B-mC were automatically (or manually in some cases) tracked over time using IMARIS software. Then, for each individually tracked EC, we set a spherical region of interest (ROI) of 4\u201311 \u03bcm in diameters that is slightly larger than the nucleus (see <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2D</a>). The diameters of every spherical ROI were carefully set to cover the nucleus and part of the cytoplasm but do not overlap with adjacent ECs. We then defined the highest voxel intensity of the GCaMP7a fluorescence within the ROI as the florescent intensity (F) of GCaMP7a\u00a0in the EC. Because intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves spread rapidly and uniformly throughout the cytoplasm of each EC (see <a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2B</a>), the spherical ROIs including part of the cytoplasmic region are enough to detect intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves. \u0394F/F<sub>0</sub> was calculated as (F\u00a0\u2212 F<sub>0</sub>)/ F<sub>0</sub>, where F<sub>0</sub> is the baseline florescent intensity of GCaMP7a averaged over a 50-s period. Fluorescence changes in GCaMP7a of individual ECs are represented as \u0394F/F<sub>0</sub> traces in the graphs, and mean \u0394F/F<sub>0</sub> was calculated by taking the average of every \u0394F/F<sub>0</sub>. The frequency of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations was counted as the number of Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations per min. \u0394F/F<sub>0</sub> increase of 20% from the baseline was defined as an oscillation, while 100% is the average of the three highest \u0394F/F<sub>0</sub> peaks in oscillating ECs of wild-type embryos. The ECs, which underwent mitosis through the time-lapse images, were removed from our quantification analyses because we found that ECs never exhibit any Ca<sup>2+</sup> rise during M phase."

However, we could not detect significant enhancement of Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations in the ECs expressing exogenous Vegfr2 before or during sprouting angiogenesis from the dorsal aorta (DA). We consider that overexpression of Vegfr2 could not cause a gain of function effect, because ECs might have a surplus amount of endogenous Vegfr2 to respond to endogenous Vegfa. Then, we examined the effect of Vegfr2 over-expression in <i>vegfr2</i> morphants. Whereas Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations were abolished in ECs within the DA in <i>vegfr2</i> morphants, exogenous Vegfr2 recovered Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations in the morphants (new <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C-F</a>).
