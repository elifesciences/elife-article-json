Here, we reveal a network motif in the brain for one of the most fundamental behavioral choices made by bilaterally symmetric animals: whether to respond to a sensory stimulus by moving to the left or to the right. We define network connectivity in the hindbrain important for the lateralized escape behavior of zebrafish and then test the role of neurons by using laser ablations and behavioral studies. Key inhibitory neurons in the circuit lie in a column of morphologically similar cells that is one of a series of such columns that form a developmental and functional ground plan for building hindbrain networks. Repetition within the columns of the network motif we defined may therefore lie at the foundation of other lateralized behavioral choices."

Here, we reveal a network motif in the brain for one of the most fundamental behavioral choices made by bilaterally symmetric animals: whether to respond to a sensory stimulus by moving to the left or to the right. We define network connectivity in the hindbrain important for the lateralized escape behavior of zebrafish and then test the role of neurons by using laser ablations and behavioral studies. Key inhibitory neurons in the circuit lie in a column of morphologically similar cells that is one of a series of such columns that form a developmental and functional ground plan for building hindbrain networks. Repetition within the columns of the network motif we defined may therefore lie at the foundation of other lateralized behavioral choices."

The solution to this problem might be more accessible in an evolutionarily old, conserved region of the brain, the hindbrain, which mediates what are some of the most fundamental behavioral choices made by vertebrate nervous systems: moving adaptively to avoid predators or to capture prey. The hindbrain is not only at the core of many sensory/motor responses, but also has a strikingly conserved ground plan of neuronal classes arranged early in life in columns ordered by structure and function (<a href=\"#bib16\">Gray, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Kinkhabwala et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Koyama et al., 2011</a>).

We studied a relatively simple, primitive, but critical lateralized behavior: the escape response of larval zebrafish, which involves a rapid turn away from a potential threat (<a href=\"#bib9\">Faber et al., 1989</a>). This escape, like that in most aquatic vertebrates, begins with the firing of a single action potential in one of a bilateral pair of hindbrain neurons, called Mauthner cells, whose axons cross in the brain and extend into the spinal cord. Activation of a Mauthner cell on one side initiates a turn away from an attacking predator that is the shortest latency and fastest motor response in vertebrates. Whether an escape is to the left versus the right is determined by which of the two cells fire, leading others to propose that this could be a simple model of decision making (<a href=\"#bib19\">Korn and Faber, 2005</a>). A correct behavioral choice here is vital- one wrong turn in a lifetime can lead to death."

We initially modeled a circuit containing inhibitory neurons driven by sensory inputs, but with connections only to the ipsilateral M-cell. As expected, because the two M-cells are controlled independently, this network led to non-adaptive bilateral M-cell responses even when there were large differences in the input strengths on opposite sides of the body (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B1</a>). Adding commissural inhibitory connections to the contralateral M-cell that were stronger than those to the ipsilateral one, in the proportions revealed by our data, allowed for some unilateral M-cell responses to strongly asymmetric bilateral inputs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B2</a>). The model performance was still flawed, however, because the strong crossed inhibition of the contralateral M-cell led to a broad range of strengths of bilateral sensory input over which neither M-cell fired, in line with our prior intuition that the strong commissural inhibition might not facilitate rapid, adaptive responses away from the side receiving the strongest input when inputs to both sides are substantial (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B2</a>)."

The first, suggested by others before us, is that these neurons may contribute to determining the time at which an M-cell fires, which is when the decision to escape is made (<a href=\"#bib9\">Faber et al., 1989</a>, <a href=\"#bib10\">1978</a>). Sensory inputs directly excite the ipsilateral M- cell, but also inhibit it by exciting the feedforward inhibitory neurons that project to that M-cell. This leads to the expectation that the timing of the escape is set by a balance between direct excitation and feedforward inhibition, which would determine when an M-cell reaches threshold to a unilateral stimulus and thus when a choice to escape is made. The model incorporating known connection strengths also shows this is possible, as lowering the level of inhibition shortens the response latency to a unilateral stimulus because the excitation dominates and drives the cell to threshold sooner (All Ablated, Half Ablated, <a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>)."

This contribution of the inhibitory neurons to laterality would be mediated both by their stronger inhibition of the contralateral M-cell and by the inhibition of their contralateral inhibitory counterparts. The model leads to the prediction that removing inhibitory neurons on one side will lead on average to more escapes initiated by the Mauthner cell on the opposite side when the balance of sensory inputs on the two sides is varied (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Thus, the experimentally derived network structure and the modeling suggest roles for the inhibitory neurons both in determining <b>when</b> a choice is made and <b>what</b> choice is made.

To test this, we used a high-energy, long wavelength femtosecond laser to ablate inhibitory neurons on one side in a transgenic line in which glycinergic neurons were GFP labeled and the M-cell was labeled by single cell electroporation with Texas red dextran. As a control for the specificity of the lesioning and possible damage to the M-cell, we targeted the laser to other glycinergic neurons near the Mauthner cell, but medial to the ones in the escape network. We also directly targeted the M-cell\u2019s lateral dendrite to either sever the dendrite from the cell body, or kill the M-cell."

The high energy pulsed laser we used ablates by production of a plasma rather than thermal damage.

We do not have a firm way of establishing the overall size of the feedforward inhibitory population, but we estimated it based on backfills from the Mauthner cell on one side. We found most filled cells on the contralateral side were located in the ventral half of the lateral glycinergic stripe (<a href=\"#bib20\">Koyama et al., 2011</a>). Because backfilling is very likely to miss some cells, to estimate the overall size of the inhibitory population we counted the number of glycinergic cells in the lateral stripe in rhombomere 4 located ventral to the most dorsal backfilled neurons, whether the cells in that region were backfilled or not. This led to an average of 31.3 cells (se=0.7, n=8 fish). We suspect this is an overestimate (possibly a large one) of the number that actually connect to the M-cell because the assumption here is that all the glycinergic cells in that region connect to the M-cell. If we take this value as an upper limit of the size of the population, we estimate that we will have removed minimally 13\u201325% of the population. The neurons we targeted with the laser were reliably identifiable based on their position relative to the lateral dendrite, and we were confident based on our many pairwise recordings that neurons in this location were members of the feedforward population."

We infer, and our modeling supports, the possibility that the inhibition might act to directly suppress the contralateral M-cell and also indirectly promote activation of the ipsilateral one by blocking the inhibition coming from the other side. The circuit configuration, synaptic strengths, and modeling lead to the prediction that if escapes were elicited by stimuli over a range of directions and strengths, then the\u00a0removal of FF\u00a0inhibitory cells on one side would result in more escapes initiated by the opposite, intact side."

Killing the M-cell on one side led to the strongest effect with a median of zero percent of short latency escapes produced by the lesioned side (mean=3.5, s.e.=1.9, n=9), consistent with short latency turns being driven largely by the intact M-cell when the other M-cell is eliminated. Cutting off the lateral dendrite of the M-cell also led to a clear bias in the laterality of responses, with more short latency escape bends initiated by the side opposite to the lesion. The median percentage of responses initiated by the lesioned side was only 12.9 percent (mean=18.5, s.e.=6.6\u2009n=6).

The firing of one of the two cells thus represents a choice of laterality, potentially offering insight into simple networks for behavioral choice \u2013 here considered in the broadest sense as collecting sensory evidence and using it to select an adaptive motor response from possible alternatives (<a href=\"#bib19\">Korn and Faber, 2005</a>)."

The connectivity motif of the excitatory, and inhibitory interneurons defined here (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11A</a>) contributes to solving both of these problems through its influence on both the laterality of an escape bend and its timing. The key aspects of the motif are excitatory inputs conveying sensory evidence (here, auditory inputs) for the alternatives to the neurons driving the output of the choice (here, the right or left M-cell). The choice depends on a competition between the two alternatives, as sensory evidence for one choice inhibits the other through inhibitory neurons that suppress the alternative outcome (the contralateral M-cell). Reciprocal connections between those inhibitory neurons likely assure that the response is fast and lateralized even for strong bilateral inputs by providing inhibition to choice neurons (M-cells) that scales with the difference in the level of sensory input on the two sides rather than the magnitude of the sensory drive. Finally, the timing of the response is determined by a balance between excitation and inhibition at the choice point (the M-cell), including a feedforward inhibition that likely prevents escape responses to weak inputs. The circuit motif we describe has a pattern of connections similar to network structures that theoretical work shows can allow for optimal choices between two alternative responses based on sensory evidence, also supporting its likely importance for behavioral choice (<a href=\"#bib3\">Bogacz et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">Mysore and Knudsen, 2012</a>)."

Our simple model incorporating the known connections and strengths could produce adaptive responses away from the side of the strongest input over a very broad range of bilateral sensory strengths, showing the possibility that such a network, even with a small number of cell types, could account for the behavior \u2013 a proof of principle at least.

Early in life, hindbrain neurons are ordered by age and function, which roughly map onto their dorsoventral position in larval zebrafish. In the hindbrain columns prior to neuronal migration (much of which occurs after larvae have hatched and already have the ability to swim, escape and feed to survive), older, more ventral neurons like the M-cell, the ventral feedforward inhibitory neurons, and ventral descending excitatory neurons in a more medial column (positive for the Chx10/Alx transcription factor) control powerful movements such as escape and fast swimming (<a href=\"#bib17\">Kinkhabwala et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Koyama et al., 2011</a>). Increasingly younger, more dorsal neurons are recruited for successively slower, weaker swimming responses. Lateralized motor responses can also vary widely in strength as well as latency to respond; for example, escape turns produced by old neurons are at the most powerful end of a range of turning movements that also include much slower and longer latency turns (<a href=\"#bib4\">Budick and O'Malley, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib24\">McElligott and O'malley, 2005</a>; <a href=\"#bib6\">Burgess and Granato, 2007</a>). We therefore predict that younger inhibitory neurons located more dorsally in the column containing the escape feedforward cells might share patterns of connectivity defined here, but will collect sensory information over increasingly longer time scales to drive appropriately lateralized behaviors that occur at longer latencies and reduced strengths than the escape. Longer latency responses might be produced by neurons with longer integration times (there is already evidence for a gradient of integration times in zebrafish oculomotor circuits that maps onto location in the hindbrain [<a href=\"#bib28\">Miri et al., 2011</a>]) or by the accumulation of evidence via a gradual recruitment within a larger population of neurons than is engaged in the very fast escape behavior. If so, then repeated network motifs in the hindbrain may contain sensory motor circuits that accumulate sensory information over different time scales to drive behavioral choices to turn left or right over a range of different latencies, speeds and magnitudes."

Feedforward glycinergic cells and Mauthner cells were targeted based on previous anatomical and physiological characterization (<a href=\"#bib20\">Koyama et al., 2011</a>). Whole-cell current clamp recordings were made with a Multiclamp 700A and 700B (Molecular Devices,\u00a0Sunnyvale\u00a0CA) at a gain of 50 with a 500 MOhm feedback resistor (50 MOhm for the Mauthner cell) filtered at 10 kHz and digitized at 50 kHz with a Digidata 1440A (Molecular Devices) using Clampex 10.2 (Molecular Devices). The reversal potential of IPSPs was checked by injecting a series of depolarizing and hyperpolarizing currents in the postsynaptic cell, with 5 traces for each current amplitude. A glycinergic blocker, strychnine (1 \u00b5M; Sigma-Aldrich), was applied to the bath to confirm the neurotransmitter responsible for the IPSP in some experiments. Data were analyzed with MATLAB (MathWorks). The peak of each IPSP was detected and the mean was calculated for each postsynaptic cell. The morphology of the recorded cells was visualized under a confocal microscope (LSM510 META, Zeiss) after filling them with dye (0.02%, Alexa Fluor 568 or 647 hydroazide, Invitrogen) dissolved in intracellular solution. Z stacks were volume rendered using the program Imaris (Bitplane)."

Because the damage was mediated by an electron-ion plasma formed by nonlinear optical absorption and there was very little thermal energy deposited, the damage was largely confined to the focal volume (<a href=\"#bib31\">Nishimura et al., 2006</a>). In order to ablate feedforward glycinergic neurons, we used 50 to 55 nJ pulses to target four to eight GFP positive glycinergic neurons on one side of the hindbrain located at the ventral-most part of the lateral glycinergic stripe, close to the lateral dendrite of the Mauthner cell. These were previously shown to be feedforward glycinergic neurons by retrograde labeling and paired recordings (<a href=\"#bib20\">Koyama et al., 2011</a>), as confirmed by many additional recordings in this paper. In control experiments, we targeted a similar number of glycinergic neurons not implicated in escapes that were near the M-cell, but medial to the feedforward cells. In other experiments, we targeted the lateral dendrite of the Mauthner cell on one side of the hindbrain at a site next to the feedforward glycinergic neurons to examine the effects of direct damage to the M-cell. We used energy ranging from 70\u201390 nJ, which either successfully cut off the lateral dendrite or killed the cell, probably because the membrane failed to reseal in some cases. In each round of the experiments, we used approximately half of the fish for the ablation and the other half for controls, in which we deposited smaller energy pulses that would not damage the target (0\u201320 nJ for glycinergic neuron ablation and 30 \u2013 50 nJ for lateral dendrite ablation). A z stack was acquired immediately after the ablations to examine the lesions. Fish with successful lesions were then transferred from agar into a small petri dish containing 10% Hank\u2019s buffer and allowed to recover overnight before the subsequent behavioral assay."

Stimuli were delivered to the right and left sides of the tail alternately with a minimum inter-trial interval of 2\u2009min. At least 10 trials were collected per fish (5 trials for each side).

To represent the spike-like waveform from gap junctional inputs from the VIIIth nerve, we modeled VIII ganglion neurons using a Hodgkin-Huxley model with adjustments in the reversal potentials to set the resting membrane potentials identical to that of the Mauthner cell. The membrane area of the VIII ganglion neurons was varied so that the number of recruited neurons increased in response to stronger stimulation. We connected one VIII ganglion neuron to only one feedforward neuron and treated them as one functional unit that recruited systematically as stimulus strength increased (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A1\u20133</a>). The connection between them was specified as a purely electrical connection based on previous literature (<a href=\"#bib46\">Zottoli and Faber, 1980</a>) and its strength was set just enough to initiate a spike in feedforward neurons in the absence of inhibitory inputs to account for the presence of feedforward inhibition even at a low stimulus strength (<a href=\"#bib34\">Oda et al., 1995</a>). The relative conductance of chemical and electrical connections between the VIIIth nerve and Mauthner cell was set heuristically based on the experimentally-derived VIII nerve response in the Mauthner cell in 5 dpf zebrafish (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A2</a>). We used the membrane time constant of 0.4 ms to model the eighth nerve response in the lateral dendrite based on previous literature (<a href=\"#bib36\">Pereda et al., 2011</a>). The inhibitory connection from a feedforward neuron to the ipsilateral Mauthner cell was tuned based on the dataset from this study (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A3</a>). The relative balance of the excitatory and ipsilateral inhibitory connections was determined so that the latency range of the Mauthner spike in response to various strengths of unilateral activation of VIII ganglion neurons matched that of the Mauthner-mediated escape to unilateral stimuli (<a href=\"#bib23\">Liu and Fetcho, 1999</a>). The relative strength of contralateral and ipsilateral inhibitory inputs from feedforward neurons was determined based on the experimentally derived ratio (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). The strength of the putative mutual inhibition between feedforward neurons was set to recover the Mauthner spikes in response to equally strong left and right stimuli. The ablation of feedforward neurons was modeled by removing feedforward neurons on one side and their associated connections."

They perform impressive circuit analysis using paired and triple whole-cell recordings coupled with dye fills. They quantify synaptic interactions and use the connectivity and strength data to construct a simple model that points out the salient functional features of the feedforward (FF) inhibitory network they reveal. They then test and confirm specific predictions of the model with elegant laser ablation studies at the cellular level using simple but powerful behavioral assays. They show clearly that particular cells are involved in the Mauthner cell FF inhibitory network. These key inhibitory neurons in the circuit lie in a column of morphologically similar cells that is one of a series of such columns that form a developmental and functional ground plan for building hindbrain networks. They then argue that such FF inhibitory microcircuits may be repeated within a column for multiple left-right behavioral choices."

This is important, as we tried to be very careful to separate conclusions based on our data from their potential broader implications. We used the wording in the Discussion: \u201cmight expect\u201d, \u201craises the possibility\u201d, \u201cwe therefore predict\u201d. We do not disagree that the M-cell circuit is specialized for a rapid choice. But, the use of repetitive arrays of a cell type that operate over a range of time scales, as exists in hindbrain based on our earlier work, makes it hard for us not to raise the possibility that \u201cslower\u201d choices will be made using different (younger and slower circuits) with the same overall cell types and circuit topology. Many responses in larval fish are fast (less than 100 millisecond time frame), so they may include pathways as direct as those in the M-cell circuit that have neurons with different cellular properties, and/or populations of cells that are recruited more slowly by sensory stimuli to make choices over longer time frames. We have now included a more explicit statement of this in the last paragraph of the Discussion."

We too often focus on what makes each circuit special, but developmental and functional topographies in hindbrain and spinal cord suggest that many circuits arise from the same neuronal ground plan, so we think it is just as important to ask what different circuits (even ones operating over different time scales) share if we are to arrive at broader principles of circuit construction."

We also modeled removal of just half of the inhibitory neurons, rather than all of them as in the original version. This is more akin to our actual perturbation and still leads to the prediction of the shorter latency we observed. We modeled ablation in a case without the mutual inhibition, as the reviewer suggested, but it was minimally informative because it retained a large area of no responses like the models without ablation, so we do not include it here. We have, however, incorporated most of the new modeling into the paper."
