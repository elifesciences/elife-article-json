Genetic studies of dormancy are challenging, because the trait is highly plastic and strongly influenced by the maternal environment. Using a combination of statistical and experimental approaches, we show that multiple alleles at the previously identified dormancy locus <i>DELAY OF GERMINATION1</i> jointly explain as much as 57% of the variation observed in Swedish <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, but give rise to spurious associations that seriously mislead genome-wide association studies unless modeled correctly. Field experiments confirm that the major alleles affect germination as well as survival under natural conditions, and demonstrate that locally adaptive traits can sometimes be dissected genetically."

Genetic studies of dormancy are challenging, because the trait is highly plastic and strongly influenced by the maternal environment. Using a combination of statistical and experimental approaches, we show that multiple alleles at the previously identified dormancy locus <i>DELAY OF GERMINATION1</i> jointly explain as much as 57% of the variation observed in Swedish <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, but give rise to spurious associations that seriously mislead genome-wide association studies unless modeled correctly. Field experiments confirm that the major alleles affect germination as well as survival under natural conditions, and demonstrate that locally adaptive traits can sometimes be dissected genetically."

There are long-standing debates over whether alleles are common or rare, loci few or many, effects small or large, interactions additive or epistatic, and so on\u2014questions of practical importance for agriculture and human health, and of fundamental importance for evolutionary biology. Lately, the discourse has been heavily influenced by the mass of human genome-wide association studies (GWAS), which have generally revealed a highly polygenic basis for complex traits, with numerous causative polymorphisms of small effect distributed across the genome (<a href=\"#bib58\">Visscher et al., 2012</a>). However, the relevance of these studies for understanding adaptive variation is not clear, as they have almost exclusively involved traits likely to have been under stabilizing or purifying selection. Indeed, among the few GWAS of adaptive variation that have been carried out, some have identified common alleles of major effect (including for human traits such as pigmentation) (<a href=\"#bib4\">Atwell et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Beleza et al., 2013</a>)."

For a weedy annual like <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, the subject of our study, germinating at the right time is crucial for early survival, and also influences other life\u00a0history traits, such as flowering (<a href=\"#bib45\">Postma and \u00c5gren, 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Huang et al., 2010a</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Chiang et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Donohue et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Springthorpe and Penfield, 2015</a>). Seed dormancy varies geographically, with high dormancy being associated with long, dry summers, and low dormancy being more prevalent where summers are short and wet (<a href=\"#bib10\">Chiang et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Debieu et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Kronholm et al., 2012</a>). Analysis of a diallel cross between a highly dormant line from the Cape Verde Islands and a non-dormant line from Poland revealed several quantitative trait loci (QTL), one of which, <i>DELAY OF GERMINATION1</i> (<i>DOG1</i>), has been cloned and molecularly characterized (<a href=\"#bib1\">Alonso-Blanco et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Bentsink et al., 2006</a>), although its function is poorly understood. It appears to be tightly regulated by a complex array of mechanisms that include alternative splicing, alternative polyadenylation, and a cis-acting antisense non-coding transcript (<i>asDOG1</i>) (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bentsink et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Nakabayashi et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Cyrek et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Fedak et al., 2016</a>), but, although <i>DOG1</i> mRNA and protein abundance generally correlate with seed dormancy, this relationship is not observed in all accessions (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bentsink et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Chiang et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Nakabayashi et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Fedak et al., 2016</a>). In these cases, epistatic interactions with the genetic background, or other mechanisms, such as the critical self-dimerization of the DOG1 protein, might come into play (<a href=\"#bib39\">Nakabayashi et al., 2015</a>). The <i>DOG1</i> locus harbors a series of functionally distinct alleles segregating in wild populations, and exhibits a pattern of genetic differentiation suggestive of local adaptation (<a href=\"#bib32\">Kronholm et al., 2012</a>). Moreover, field experiments using a diallel cross between accessions from Sweden and Italy identified a major QTL associated with total fitness that spanned the <i>DOG1</i> region, and also demonstrated that genetic differences in seedling establishment\u2014and most particularly in seed dormancy\u2014are one of the main components of local adaptation (<a href=\"#bib45\">Postma and \u00c5gren, 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Postma et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Huang et al., 2010a</a>). Finally, extensive natural variation for seed dormancy is not unique to the <i>DOG1</i> locus and many other QTLs have been mapped in various populations (<a href=\"#bib1\">Alonso-Blanco et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Bentsink et al., 2006</a>, <a href=\"#bib6\">2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Amiguet-Vercher et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Xiang et al., 2016</a>). The recent cloning of the <i>DELAY OF GERMINATION18</i> (<i>DOG18</i>)/<i>IBO</i> QTLs in two independent diallel crosses revealed the existence of numerous loss-of-function alleles\u2014mainly caused by nonsense mutations and structural variants\u2014at the <i>REDUCED DORMANCY5</i> (<i>RDO5</i>) locus in wild <i>A. thaliana</i> populations (<a href=\"#bib60\">Xiang et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Amiguet-Vercher et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib59\">Xiang et al., 2014</a>)."

We focused on the germination rate of seeds after-ripened for 21 days (GR21), which showed dramatic variation with 46% of lines being dormant (GR21\u00a0&lt;\u00a020%) and 35% being effectively non-dormant (GR21\u00a0&gt;\u00a080%) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). We observed a strong correlation between GR21 and latitude (Pearson\u2019s <i>r</i>\u00a0=\u00a00.62) (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>), largely due to the fact that northern Swedish lines were mostly non-dormant whereas the majority of southern Swedish lines was dormant (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a> and online:\u00a0<a href=\"https://goo.gl/3HeqX5\">https://goo.gl/3HeqX5</a>).

As is typical in <i>A. thaliana</i> (<a href=\"#bib31\">Kim et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Long et al., 2013</a>), LD decayed within 10 kb of SNP1, however, we identified one marker, SNP2, in moderate LD (<i>r</i><sup>2</sup>\u00a0=\u00a00.61) with SNP1 despite a separation of almost 21 kb (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). SNP2 was strongly, albeit non-significantly, associated with GR21 (\u2212log<sub>10</sub><i>p</i>\u00a0=\u00a05.80) and is located in the promoter region of <i>DOG1</i>. As <i>DOG1</i> expression is often correlated with seed dormancy (<a href=\"#bib7\">Bentsink et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Chiang et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Nakabayashi et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Fedak et al., 2016</a>), we hypothesized that SNP2 could contribute to GR21 variation, and used it as starting point for a multi-locus GWAS based on stepwise inclusion of markers (<a href=\"#bib51\">Segura et al., 2012</a>). The optimal model resulting from starting with SNP2 explained 57% of the variation and consisted of two markers in addition to SNP2: SNP3, also in the <i>DOG1</i> promoter; and SNP4, a rare allele [minor allele frequency (MAF)\u00a0=\u00a00.018] in the first exon of <i>DOG1</i> (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C\u2013D</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3B and E</a>). In contrast, the optimal model resulting from starting with SNP1 explained only 46% of the variation, and identified only one additional marker: SNP4 (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3A and D</a>). Starting from SNP3, on the other hand, yielded the same model as starting from SNP2, and it is clear that the combined effect of SNP2 and SNP3 effectively eliminates the signal at SNP1 (<a href=\"#fig2s3\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3B\u2013C and E\u2013F</a>), suggesting that it (and the small peak around it) is a synthetic association that serves as a proxy for SNP2 and SNP3 (or closely linked variants: SNP3 is in perfect LD with two other nearby SNPs that can explain the variation just as well; see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods). The rare SNP4, on the other hand, appears to be independent of the other SNPs. In line with these stepwise results, we found that SNP2 and SNP3 were the best pairwise predictors of the dormancy variation (see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods and <a href=\"#SD10-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>). Taken together, these GWAS results strongly suggest that variants in the <i>DOG1</i> promoter region underlie dormancy variation in the Swedish population (but say nothing about the molecular mechanism, a fact to which we will return below)."

Linkage analysis in six different F2 populations confirmed the importance of the <i>DOG1</i> region (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a> and <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 1</a>). Two of the crosses (TF\u00c4 07 x Stenk-3 and Eden-2 x \u00d6M\u00f61-7) demonstrated that the dormant SNP2 allele does not require SNP1, as expected if the association observed at the latter is synthetic. However, due to the strong linkage disequilibrium between SNP3 and SNP1, no cross let us similarly demonstrate that the dormant SNP3 has an effect independently of SNP1. To overcome these limitations, we complemented the non-dormant <i>dog1-2</i> mutant with genomic fragments\u2014promoter and gene\u2014corresponding to different <i>DOG1</i> alleles. Lines transformed with predicted dormant alleles carrying either SNP2 or SNP3 (but not SNP1, which is not part of the transformed fragment) were significantly more dormant than those transformed with a predicted non-dormant allele (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a> and <a href=\"#SD3-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 2</a>). It is thus clear that <i>DOG1</i> alleles tagged by SNP2 and SNP3 are capable of producing a dormant phenotype independently of SNP1 (and other closely linked genes, like <i>CIPK20</i>). Finally, two additional F2 populations (TEDEN 03 x T\u00c5L 07 and TAA 14 x TEDEN 03) supported the association between dormancy and SNP4, thus bringing the number of distinct dormant <i>DOG1</i> alleles to three (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>)."

These SNPs may be causative, but we emphasize that SNP3 is in perfect LD with two other SNPs a few bp away that can explain the variation just as well (see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods and <a href=\"#SD10-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>), and that there may also be structural variants not present in the data we used to carry out GWAS (<a href=\"#bib35\">Long et al., 2013</a>). Furthermore, it is difficult to completely rule out that these SNPs are themselves tagging rare alleles, just like SNP1 is tagging them (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>). Fully establishing causality would require extensive experiments using lines engineered to test all polymorphisms independently of each other, and would be almost impossible without techniques for <i>in situ</i> gene replacement given the variation in gene expression that results from transgene insertion (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>). It is also crucial to distinguish between causality in the genetic sense (the focus of this paper) and molecular mechanism: we emphasize that we do not know whether these SNPs affect dormancy by regulating <i>DOG1</i>, <i>asDOG1</i> or even <i>CIPK20</i>. Given the apparent complexity of <i>DOG1</i> regulation, elucidating the causative mechanism will be a non-trivial task. It should also be noted that further alleles that we do not have the power to detect, either because they are rare or have small effect, may exist. However, while it is impossible to exclude the possibility that there are alleles we did not detect, a variance-components analysis (<a href=\"#bib50\">Sasaki et al., 2015</a>) estimated that 51% of the dormancy variation is due to genetic variation in the 4.8 kb surrounding <i>DOG1</i>, which suggests that most of the variation at <i>DOG1</i> has been accounted for by the identified haplotypes (see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods). The variation in dormancy between lines carrying the same <i>DOG1</i> haplotype (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>) is probably due to variation at other loci (the existence of which is evident from GWAS and the F2 crosses, see <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a> and online:\u00a0<a href=\"https://goo.gl/30EPt3\">https://goo.gl/30EPt3</a>). <i>DOG18</i>/<i>RDO5</i>/<i>IBO</i>, because of its recently characterized multiple natural alleles, was a good candidate to explain part of the remaining dormancy variation. However, no association was observed at this gene, presumably because the four distinct loss-of-function alleles (carried by V\u00e5r2-6, L\u00f6v-1, \u00d6M\u00f62-1 and Hov3-2) segregating in our population appear to be singletons and thus cannot be detected using GWAS (and they do not segregate in our six F2 populations)."

Our goal was to track changes in <i>DOG1</i> haplotype frequency across time, from seed release to the end of the germination window. Because timing of germination partly depends on the interaction between genes and seed maturation environment (<a href=\"#bib44\">Postma and \u00c5gren, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Chiang et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Donohue et al., 2005</a>), we first grew a set of F2 individuals for each population in a common garden experiment, from germination to ripening. The progeny of these plants (F3 seeds) was then mixed and dispersed in experimental plots in early summer, using a two-block design for replication. We sampled all visible seedlings (destructive sampling) in September and November and also sampled soil shortly before winter in order to gain access to the live seeds present in newly-formed seed bank (see Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods and <a href=\"#SD11-data\">Supplementary file 3A</a>)."

In the D2 x ND population, the frequency of D2 increased moderately between seed dispersal and September, and appeared to continue increasing throughout fall (it was slightly lower in the seed bank) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). This is consistent with D2 delaying germination, and delayed germination increasing seedling survival. In contrast, the frequency of D3 in the ND x D3 population decreased dramatically between seed dispersal and September, but recovered rapidly by November, indicating a dramatic delay in germination (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Furthermore, the D3 frequency in the seed bank was very high, demonstrating that this haplotype not only caused a delay in seed germination but also prevented seeds from germinating at all (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>)."

The implied selection strengths are enormous: the viability of homozygous non-dormant <i>DOG1</i> genotypes relative to homozygous dormant ones until winter was 50\u201360% depending on population (<a href=\"#SD11-data\">Supplementary file 3D</a>). Of course there will be further mortality in the seed bank and not all established seedlings will survive and reproduce, but the results serve to illustrate that selection on <i>DOG1</i> could be very strong indeed, and lend credence to the notion that the observed distribution of dormancy and <i>DOG1</i> alleles (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figures 1C</a> and <a href=\"#fig3\">3D</a>) reflects local adaptation. Although our experiments have limitations and do not allow us to decompose total fitness, our results agree with those from previous studies, and it becomes very clear that germination timing is one of the main (if not the main) fitness components (<a href=\"#bib45\">Postma and \u00c5gren, 2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Huang et al., 2010a</a>). To fully understand how selection acts will require multi-generational field experiments as selection pressures are likely to vary from year to year (and are unlikely to be at equilibrium, because of large-scale climate variations). Under the conditions of our experiment, D2 (the most common dormant haplotype) appears to have had a clear advantage over ND, whereas D3 may have been too dormant (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4</a>)."

Generally speaking, deep dormancy may allow plants from the south to avoid periodic drought and high temperatures in summer, whereas northern populations may benefit from a shallower dormancy to cope with a short vegetative growth window. However, the fact that southern Sweden harbors large numbers of both dormant and non-dormant <i>DOG1</i> haplotypes demonstrates that variation for seed dormancy can be found at a very local scale, presumably due to microenvironmental variation, and the distribution of SNP4, which segregates in northern Sweden only, suggests that moderate levels of dormancy could also be beneficial at this latitude."

That a single locus should explain most of the variation for a major life history trait is certainly surprising and arguably unprecedented. Of course we do not know how much of dormancy variation <i>DOG1</i> would explain under field conditions (and we certainly do not know how much of the variation for total fitness it would explain), but our data suggest that it is a major contributor. Although other loci also appeared to be under selection in our field experiments\u2014as expected given that the F2 results show that other loci also contribute strongly to variation for dormancy\u2014allele frequency changes at <i>DOG1</i> were among the strongest in both populations (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a> and <a href=\"#fig4s1\">Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Interestingly, GWAS in a global population also identifies <i>DOG1</i> as strongly associated with flowering time variation (<a href=\"#bib4\">Atwell et al., 2010</a>;\u00a0<a href=\"#bib55\">1001 Genomes Consortium\u00a02016</a>), although it is not yet clear whether this association is real or spurious. If the latter, a likely explanation is that correlated selection pressures on two related life history traits\u2014germination and flowering\u2014has generated cross-trait genotype-phenotype correlations. If the former, <i>DOG1</i> emerges as an evolutionary \u2018master switch\u2019 for life history variation, perhaps similar in importance to the central flowering regulator <i>FLC</i> (<a href=\"#bib34\">Li et al., 2014</a>). Indeed a recent study has demonstrated that <i>DOG1</i> may affect both dormancy and flowering (<a href=\"#bib29\">Huo et al., 2016</a>), and it is interesting to note that both genes appear to be regulated through similar mechanisms, with chromatin remodelling and antisense transcripts switching off sense transcription (<a href=\"#bib54\">Swiezewski et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Footitt et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib18\">Fedak et al., 2016</a>).

In the south, natural populations experience a wider range of conditions than in the north, but, in general, summer is longer, warmer and dryer, while winter is shorter. The micro-environment is also very diverse is Sweden. For example, populations from the north are mainly located on eroded, south-facing rocky slopes, while the ones from the south occur in various types of habitats, such as meadows, agricultural fields, beaches and urban areas. Because of this environmental variation, the seasonal timing of key life history traits can differ between populations, although Swedish <i>A. thaliana</i> generally exhibit a winter annual life cycle.

Our goal was to identify SNPs that, when combined, explained a substantial proportion of the GR21 variation. Because the GR21 phenotype has a bimodal distribution (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>), we assumed that variants potentially causing synthetic associations were mutually exclusive and would not cosegregate among the Swedish lines. From the SNP matrix used for GWAS (<a href=\"#bib35\">Long et al., 2013</a>), we extracted 1805 SNPs that were located within the 50 kb associated region encompassing <i>DOG1</i>. To minimize the number of pairs to test, SNPs with a minor allele frequency lower than 5% were discarded. The remaining 1145 SNPs were paired (0 or 0\u00a0=\u00a00, 1 or 0\u00a0=\u00a01, 0 or 1\u00a0=\u00a01, 1 or 1\u00a0=\u00a01) to create pseudo SNPs (pSNPs) and the association between all 654,940 possible pSNPs and GR21 was tested with the GWA model used for the marginal analysis. We found that pSNP285192 (SNP1 + SNP2) and pSNP580642 (SNP2 + SNP3) shared the lowest <i>p-</i>value (\u2212log<sub>10</sub><i>p</i>\u00a0=\u00a011.88) (<a href=\"#SD10-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>). As previously mentioned, SNP3 is in strong linkage disequilibrium with two other markers (<i>r</i><sup>2</sup>\u00a0=\u00a01): c5p18591361 and c5p18591703. For this reason, pSNP579096 (c5p18591361 + SNP2) and pSNP581026 (c5p18591703 + SNP2) are also among the top combinations (<a href=\"#SD10-data\">Supplementary file 2</a>)."

Finally, trays were watered one last time to ensure a smooth transition between the greenhouse and the field. These plants grew under natural conditions during most of their life cycle and their progeny was therefore highly suitable to study seed dormancy. F3 seeds were harvested on 30th\u00a0May 2014, which coincided with ripening in surrounding <i>A. thaliana</i> wild populations.

Consequently, the already existing seed bank prevented us from dispersing seeds directly on natural soil. To circumvent this issue, we used a mixture of potting soil (\u2018Lantliv Plantjord\u2019, <a href=\"http://www.rolunda.se\">www.rolunda.se</a>) and fine sand (\u2018Sandl\u00e5dsand\u2019, <a href=\"http://www.weibulls.com\">www.weibulls.com</a>) to disperse the seeds on (ratio was 1\u00a0L of sand/10\u00a0L of soil).

To avoid competition and contamination caused by other weeds growing in the vicinity of the experiment, we added a layer of landscape fabric at the bottom and on the sides of each block. This way, only gas and humidity exchanges were permitted between the ground and the artificial soil layer, excluding undesirable plant material from the experiment.

At this point, watering was stopped and we let the trays dry out for about four weeks. After re-watering the trays, we noticed a new flush of germination that lasted for a few days. We then repeated the drought treatment two more times, until no more germination was observed.

The proportion of viable seeds was determined for each F3 family by measuring the germination rate of 50\u2013100 stratified seeds (five days, 4\u00b0C, dark, 99% humidity) as described previously (See Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods, GR21 estimation in Swedish accessions). Petri dishes used to determine viabilities were kept and seven-day-old seedlings as well as imbibed ungerminated seeds were pooled together to isolate DNA. These pools were genotyped by sequencing as described previously (See Materials\u00a0and\u00a0methods, Functional validation of <i>DOG1</i> alleles). This allowed us to reconstruct the genotype of the parental F2s and to determine the genome-wide genotype frequencies for both populations. We were then able to estimate the genotype and allele frequencies in the pools of dispersed F3 seeds, taking into account seed viability and assuming Mendelian inheritance between generations. These frequencies were used as a proxy for starting allele frequencies at dispersal (sampling point 0)."

Both groups face the difficulty of identifying a gene (or several genes?) responsible to confer high dormancy in a genomic interval. It is worth therefore quickly reviewing the case of <i>DOG1</i>. Bentsink used the NILDOG17-1 line, which contains a Cvi introgression in Ler conferring a strong dormancy QTL. This Cvi introgression encompasses the same genomic interval identified by Kerdaffrec et al. Bentsink et al. mutagenized the NILDOG17-1 line with EMS to find mutants that are no longer dormant. The intrinsic assumption is that the NILDOG17-1 introgression confers high dormancy by virtue of the higher activity of a gene product. This is by no means guaranteed. It could be that one or several genes products in the NILDOG17-1 introgression have lower activity and this in turn is responsible for the higher NILDOG17-1 line dormancy. How will the EMS approach identify such gene(s)?"

These genes were discarded because the ABA biosynthetic genes were not in the NILDOG17-1 interval. Suppose anyway that these genes were located in the NILDOG17-1 interval. Would it necessarily mean that they are responsible for the higher dormancy conferred by the NILDOG17-1 introgression? Not necessarily."

Instead Bentsink et al. transformed Ler with pBIB-<i>DOG1</i>-Cvi. The resulting transgenic plants were more dormant but strictly speaking this experiment does not qualify as a complementation analysis. Furthermore, to my best knowledge mutations in <i>DOG1</i> were only reported in NILDOG17-1 (the original <i>dog1</i> mutation) and the Col ecotype. The Col ecotype is notoriously non-dormant so evaluating the function of a dormancy gene in a non-dormant ecotype is not ideal."

Whether this dormancy truly illustrates <i>DOG1</i>'s function in planta or whether it is a gain-of-function, neomorphic effect of <i>DOG1</i> expression remains to be determined. It would be highly informative to know for example whether mutating <i>DOG1</i> in a pure Cvi background (e.g. by CRISPR/CAS) does significantly lower dormancy. But even if this were the case it would still not show, as discussed above, that <i>DOG1</i> is the causative agent of the higher dormancy observed in NILDOG17-1."

The reported GWA mapping results identify <i>DOG1</i> as a strong candidate locus accounting for 57% of the variation. This confirms the previous results that identify <i>DOG1</i> as the causal gene underlying a seed dormancy QTL in a diallelic synthetic population, correctly cited in this manuscript. Using 8 different diallelic synthetic F2 populations, and transgenic complementation, the authors go on to identify 4 <i>DOG1</i> haplotypes in this Swedish population (3 dormancy and 1 non-dormancy alleles). Interestingly, the distribution of these alleles on the landscape matches the distribution of the dormancy phenotype. The non-dormancy allele is mainly found in the northern plants where non-dormancy is prevalent. The 2 most prevalent dormancy alleles being found in the southern plants where dormancy is more common. This suggests that variation at <i>DOG1</i> is adaptive, and this supported previously published work, correctly cited in this manuscript. To obtain evidence that these various <i>DOG1</i> alleles are adaptive the authors performed a 1-year, single site common garden experiment in the field in Southern Sweden. At this site the authors evaluate the allele frequency of the non-dormant allele and the 2 most common dormancy alleles that are segregating in 2 diallelic synthetic F2 populations. By assessing the allele frequency at sowing in early spring and again in September, November and in the seed bank the authors reveal that the frequency of both <i>DOG1</i> dormancy alleles increases from sowing to seed back and that the frequency of the non-dormancy <i>DOG1</i> allele decreases. The authors conclude that this evidence 'lends credence to the notion that the observed distribution of dormancy and <i>DOG1</i> alleles reflects local adaptation'. I think this is a very reasonable statement. It is of cause a shame that the authors did not repeat this experiment over multiple years and also included a northern site where they could have tested the adaptive potential of the non-dormancy allele (early germination to avoid early killing frosts in the fall perhaps)."

These field experiments have limitations (only performed in 1 year and at one site) but I think these experiments still differentiate this work from the growing body of published GWAS, and as such raise the potential impact of this work."

Seeds were sown, they germinated, and were sampled in September and November and later. Reading details in Materials and methods shows that the allele frequencies are of seedlings available at the sampling date, and if I assume correctly, the seedlings were discarded after sampling. In this case, the allele frequencies are not for population data, but for germinating seeds. Any differences e.g. in post-germination survival are not included? So seeds that inherited for parents a late germinating haplotype also germinate later in the wild, and other fitness components were not studied. Now the non-dormant populations are all from the north \u2013 the poor success of the non-dormant seeds/seedlings could presumably be related to other linked loci in the F2 progenies. The delay of germination of the D2 and D3 haplotypes seemed pretty similar earlier (in the transformants). At least in some parts of southern Sweden nearly a third of the plants seem to be very early germinating, and the frequencies non-dormant haplotypes are very high. So, one could assume that in southern Sweden there are other important fitness components. If there is something I misunderstood, the writing could be clearer, if not, then it would be good to point out that only a part of the life cycle was studied and that there may be other fitness effects later. This part of the work could be much clarified. (Further, to demonstrate local adaptation, it would of course have been good to have another experiment in the north.)"

The reported GWA mapping results identify DOG1 as a strong candidate locus accounting for 57% of the variation. This confirms the previous results that identify DOG1 as the causal gene underlying a seed dormancy QTL in a diallelic synthetic population, correctly cited in this manuscript. Using 8 different diallelic synthetic F2 populations, and transgenic complementation, the authors go on to identify 4 DOG1 haplotypes in this Swedish population (3 dormancy and 1 non-dormancy alleles). Interestingly, the distribution of these alleles on the landscape matches the distribution of the dormancy phenotype. The non-dormancy allele is mainly found in the northern plants where non-dormancy is prevalent. The 2 most prevalent dormancy alleles being found in the southern plants where dormancy is more common. This suggests that variation at DOG1 is adaptive, and this supported previously published work, correctly cited in this manuscript. To obtain evidence that these various DOG1 alleles are adaptive the authors performed a 1-year, single site common garden experiment in the field in Southern Sweden. At this site the authors evaluate the allele frequency of the non-dormant allele and the 2 most common dormancy alleles that are segregating in 2 diallelic synthetic F2 populations. By assessing the allele frequency at sowing in early spring and again in September, November and in the seed bank the authors reveal that the frequency of both DOG1 dormancy alleles increases from sowing to seed back and that the frequency of the non-dormancy DOG1 allele decreases. The authors conclude that this evidence 'lends credence to the notion that the observed distribution of dormancy and DOG1 alleles reflects local adaptation'. I think this is a very reasonable statement. It is of cause a shame that the authors did not repeat this experiment over multiple years and also included a northern site where they could have tested the adaptive potential of the non-dormancy allele (early germination to avoid early killing frosts in the fall perhaps).</i> "

The fact that we observe such an extensive dormancy variation in southern Sweden probably indicates that microenvironmental variation (soil properties, human or animal disturbance etc.) could play an important role.
