These organelles later came to be known as cilia, and they have been studied by countless biologists ever since (<a href=\"#bib2\">Beales and Jackson, 2012</a>). These investigations have revealed that cilia can have a range of different structures and perform many different functions. We now know how a cell builds an individual cilium, but we still do not fully understand the range of cilia structures and functions observed in nature. Since the disruption of cilia can cause kidney disease, male infertility, neuropsychiatric disorders and various other \u2018ciliopathies\u2019, there are strong motivations to understand how this diversity of structures and functions arises."

In particular, the \u2018wiring diagram\u2019 for the 302 neurons in <i>C. elegans</i> was elucidated (<a href=\"#bib9\">White et al., 1986</a>), and the details of the sensory systems in the head and tail were worked out (<a href=\"#bib7\">Perkins et al., 1986</a>)."

Not surprisingly, this unprecedented level of detail revealed some features that had not been seen before (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). For example, <i>C. elegans</i> cilia were shown to lack the so-called \u2018transition fibers\u2019 that connect the cilium and the cilia base; this means that structures that were previously interpreted as transition fibers were in fact imaging artifacts. Doroquez, Berciu et al. also observed vesicles\u2014small membrane-bound packages that move molecules around within cells\u2014within the ciliary base or transition zone. In the past it had been assumed that cilia did not contain vesicles, so their presence suggests that an alternative means of transporting molecules might operate within a cilium."

These tree-like branches contain molecular filaments (called microtubules) that are arranged in a variety of different ways that had not previously been recognized. It is thought that these branches increase the surface area of the cilium, allowing the animal to better sample its chemical environment. The base of the cilium is called the transition zone (purple)."

Previous studies revealed the presence of \u2018electron-dense material\u2019, largely proteins, inside the microtubules of the long cilia\u2014sometimes called flagella\u2014that are found in single-celled microorganisms and sea urchin sperm (<a href=\"#bib4\">Heuser et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Pigino et al., 2012</a>). Some cilia from <i>C. elegans</i> also had electron-dense material inside certain microtubules that are linked together via thin fibers. These <i>C. elegans</i> cilia are important for worm foraging and for avoiding danger, and they resemble touch-sensitive receptors called campaniform mechanoreceptors that are found in insects. This observation suggests a correlation between these specific adaptations in the shape of cilia and the cilia being particularly sensitive to touch."

Cilia and the branches of neurons, called dendritic spines, have been proposed to be comparable in their ability to convey environmental signals and nerve impulses, respectively (<a href=\"#bib6\">Nechipurenko et al., 2013</a>). This raises an interesting question: Do cilia-associated glia function in a similar way to those at the junctions between neurons, and do they modulate a cilium\u2019s ability to receive and/or transmit a signal?"

What is the biological or functional relevance of the physical connection between neuronal cilia and glial support cells? A challenge going forward is to link this reconstruction with advances in imaging. This could include tracking changes in the concentration of ions, such as calcium, that are involved in nerve impulses in living animals. Alternatively, super-resolution microscopy could be used to visualize structures of biomolecules in order to understand how sensory information is received and processed by the nervous system. This work sets the stage to address these questions, and to apply what has been learned in the <i>C. elegans</i> paradigm to more complex sensory systems and to ciliated cells hidden deep in the mammalian body, such as in the brain."
