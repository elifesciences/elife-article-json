Here, based on a re-analysis of these data for the 102,740 funded grants with percentile scores of 20 or better, we report that these percentile scores are a poor discriminator of productivity. This underscores the limitations of peer review as a means of assessing grant applications in an era when typical success rates are often as low as about 10%."

However, several studies have suggested significant problems with the current system of grant peer review. One problem is that the number of reviewers is typically inadequate to provide statistical precision (<a href=\"#bib13\">Kaplan et al., 2008</a>). Researchers have also found considerable variation among scores and disagreement regarding review criteria (<a href=\"#bib18\">Mayo et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib10\">Graves et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Abdoul et al., 2012</a>), and a Bayesian hierarchical statistical model of 18,959 applications to the NIH found evidence of reviewer bias that influenced as much as a quarter of funding decisions (<a href=\"#bib12\">Johnson, 2008</a>)."

An analysis of over 400 competing renewal grant applications at one NIH institute (the National Institute of General Medical Sciences) found no correlation between percentile score and publication productivity of funded grants (<a href=\"#bib3\">Berg, 2013</a>). A subsequent study of 1492 grants at another NIH institute (the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute) similarly found no correlation between the percentile score and publication or citation productivity, even after correction for numerous variables (<a href=\"#bib5\">Danthi et al., 2014</a>). These observations suggest that once grant applications have been determined to be meritorious, expert reviewers cannot accurately predict their productivity."

Although the limitations of using retrospective publication/citation productivity to validate peer review are acknowledged (<a href=\"#bib17\">Lindner et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Lauer and Nakamura, 2015</a>), this large study has been interpreted as vindicating grant peer review (<a href=\"#bib19\">Mervis, 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Williams, 2015</a>). However, the relevance of those findings for the current situation is questionable since the analysis included many funded grants with poor percentile scores (&gt;40th percentile) that would not be considered competitive today. Moreover, this study did not examine the important question of whether percentile scores can accurately stratify meritorious applications to identify those most likely to be productive."

Applications with percentile scores of 2 or better generated significantly more citations than applications receiving poorer scores; however, this was not true for applications receiving scores of 3 or higher. Although it was not possible to adjust citation numbers according to the year of award, a previous analysis of the dataset found that cohort effects relating to fiscal year did not influence the relationship between percentile score and productivity (<a href=\"#bib15\">Li and Agha, 2015</a>). While our re-analysis confirms that there is a correlation between percentile score and publication or citation productivity for applications with scores in the top 20 percentiles, the correlation is quite modest (slope = \u22120.132 \u00b1 0.005 publications and \u22129.6 \u00b1 0.337 citations for each percentile score increment, r<sup>2</sup> = 0.0078), suggesting that the overall ability of review groups to predict application success is weak at best.

Perhaps most importantly, these findings contradict the notion that peer review can determine which applications are most likely to be productive. The excellent productivity exhibited by many projects with relatively poor scores and the poor productivity exhibited by some projects with outstanding scores demonstrate the inherent unpredictability of scientific research. The data also suggest that current paylines are inadequate to fund the most productive applications and that considerable potential productivity is being left on the table at current funding levels (<a href=\"#bib2\">Berg, 2011</a>)."

Citation practices have evolved over time, and citations per paper approximately doubled between 1980 and 2004 (<a href=\"#bib22\">Wallace et al., 2009</a>). This may have contributed to greater citation productivity for more recent grants, which would tend to have more favorable percentile scores than older ones, as paylines have declined over time, resulting in a correlation between percentile score and citation productivity that is unrelated to the discriminatory ability of the peer review process. In addition, applications that are funded despite scoring worse than the payline tend to be funded later in the fiscal year and are often subject to budgetary reductions that could adversely impact their future productivity. According to a report from the US Government Accountability Office (GAO), 13% of R01 applications funded in fiscal years 2003\u20132007 were exceptions with scores worse than the payline (<a href=\"#bib8\">GAO, 2009</a>).

The data included the number of publications acknowledging grant support within 5 years of grant approval (from PubMed), the number of citations of those publications through 2013 (Web of Science) and the percentile score of the application (rounded to the nearest whole number). Parametric statistical analyses were performed in Prism (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and random forest analyses were performed using R (Vienna, Austria) and the pROC (<a href=\"#bib21\">Robin et al., 2011</a>) and randomForest (<a href=\"#bib16\">Liaw and Wiener, 2002</a>) packages."
