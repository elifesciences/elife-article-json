However, it is unknown whether histones themselves have evolved to regulate chromatin compaction.  Analysis of histone sequences from 160 eukaryotes revealed that the H2A N-terminus has systematically acquired arginines as genomes expanded.  Insertion of arginines into their evolutionary conserved position in H2A of a small-genome organism increased linear compaction by as much as 40%, while their absence markedly diminished compaction in cells with large genomes.  This effect was recapitulated in vitro with nucleosomal arrays using unmodified histones, indicating that H2A N-terminus directly modulates the chromatin fiber likely through intra- and inter-nucleosomal arginine-DNA contacts to enable tighter nucleosomal packing.  Our findings reveal a novel evolutionary mechanism for regulation of chromatin compaction and may explain the frequent mutations of the H2A N-terminus in cancer."
