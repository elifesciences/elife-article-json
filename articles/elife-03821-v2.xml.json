With the aim of identifying individuals in whom ART might induce a period of viraemic control on stopping therapy, we hypothesised that quantification of the pool of latently infected cells in primary HIV-1 infection (PHI) would predict clinical progression and viral replication following ART. We measured HIV-1 DNA in a highly characterised randomised population of individuals with PHI. We explored associations between HIV-1 DNA and immunological and virological markers of clinical progression, including viral rebound in those interrupting therapy. In multivariable analyses, HIV-1 DNA was more predictive of disease progression than plasma viral load and, at treatment interruption, predicted time to plasma virus rebound. HIV-1 DNA may help identify individuals who could safely interrupt ART in future HIV-1 eradication trials."

With the aim of identifying individuals in whom ART might induce a period of viraemic control on stopping therapy, we hypothesised that quantification of the pool of latently infected cells in primary HIV-1 infection (PHI) would predict clinical progression and viral replication following ART. We measured HIV-1 DNA in a highly characterised randomised population of individuals with PHI. We explored associations between HIV-1 DNA and immunological and virological markers of clinical progression, including viral rebound in those interrupting therapy. In multivariable analyses, HIV-1 DNA was more predictive of disease progression than plasma viral load and, at treatment interruption, predicted time to plasma virus rebound. HIV-1 DNA may help identify individuals who could safely interrupt ART in future HIV-1 eradication trials."

Once HIV-1 has infected a cell and integrated its genome into the cellular DNA, that cell may revert to a resting state, only producing replication competent virions when activated at a later date. These cells have been labeled the \u2018HIV reservoir\u2019. There is, however, a lack of clarity relating to the cell types that might harbour the \u2018reservoir\u2019, as well as the tissues in which these cells might be located. For clarity, we will use the term \u2018reservoir\u2019 to describe the population of HIV-1-infected cells that persist during ART and which are the source of rebound viraemia on stopping therapy. Current understanding is that the majority of cells comprising this reservoir are CD4 T memory cells of a resting phenotype (<a href=\"#bib3\">Avettand-Fenoel et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Liszewski et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Eriksson et al., 2013</a>)."

As cell-associated HIV-1 DNA precedes plasma viraemia in the viral life cycle, it is tantalizing to speculate whether measuring HIV-1 DNA (as a surrogate for reservoir size) might have significant clinical relevance."

Much of this detectable HIV-1 DNA has been found to be mutated and replication-incompetent calling into question its biological relevance (<a href=\"#bib22\">Ho et al., 2013</a>). However, as a simple surrogate measure of the reservoir it may still have a role to play. As new interventions to cure HIV-1 infection are developed and taken into clinical trials, a means to measure their efficacy is needed. Stopping ART to await the return of viraemia would be the \u2018gold standard\u2019 approach, but has been associated with risk in certain (<a href=\"#bib11\">Strategies for Management of Antiretroviral Therapy (SMART) Study Group et al., 2006</a>), although not all studies (<a href=\"#bib14\">SPARTAC Trial Investigators et al., 2013</a>). Ideally, the clinician would have access to an algorithm of biomarker assays to help identify those patients who might (or, alternatively, should not) be candidates for a safe treatment interruption (TI). The best way to assess the patient successfully managed on ART is unclear but, with the viral load rendered undetectable, it is plausible that HIV-1 DNA might be an alternative biomarker for disease progression. For example, compared with individuals with uncontrolled viraemia, HIV-1 DNA levels are much lower in cohorts such as VISCONTI in which apparently persistent aviraemia has been reported following TI (<a href=\"#bib35\">Saez-Cirion et al., 2013</a>), and in the case of the Mississippi baby extremely low DNA levels were associated with a prolonged period of virological remission. However, this contrasts with cases in which undetectable DNA on ART was associated with prompt rebound viraemia on stopping (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chun et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Henrich et al., 2014</a>). We therefore wished to gain a broader picture of the utility of measuring HIV-1 DNA levels by studying participants in a large, randomized trial of primary HIV-1 infection."

Studying individuals recruited at PHI, randomized to no treatment or ART, and who subsequently underwent treatment interruption, allowed us to ask two questions. Was HIV-1 DNA independently predictive of clinical progression, and did HIV-1 DNA predict the time taken for viraemic rebound on stopping therapy, advocating its role in future treatment interruption protocols?"

The simplest measure of the reservoir is a qPCR assay that detects all intracellular HIV-1 DNA regardless of whether it is integrated into host chromosomes or is in unintegrated linear or circular forms. A modification of this assay incorporates an initial step to prime host <i>Alu</i> repeats in order to quantify only viral DNA that has been integrated into host DNA. These assays are open to criticism as the vast majority of intracellular HIV-1 DNA is thought to be replication incompetent, and qPCR is not able to discriminate between replication competent and incompetent viral DNA genomes. This has led to the development of alternative approaches such as viral outgrowth assays (which are considered the gold standard, but are expensive and time-consuming, even with recent improvements to their protocols [<a href=\"#bib26\">Laird et al., 2013</a>]) and assays to measure intracellular HIV-1 RNA, which may more accurately reflect an infected cell's ability to produce new virions, especially under conditions where viral transcription is stimulated (<a href=\"#bib4\">Bullen et al., 2014</a>)."

In a smaller study at PHI, Lafeuillade et al also associated HIV-1 DNA with time to rebound, however this study is complicated by other interventions such as IL-2 and hydroxyurea in addition to ART (<a href=\"#bib25\">Lafeuillade et al., 2003</a>)."

One possible criticism\u2014and explanation for why plasma VL was less predictive in this study\u2014is that other studies have associated progression with the \u2018set-point\u2019 viral load, the value at which the VL stabilizes following the dynamic PHI stage. However, in our untreated participants we found that the \u2018baseline\u2019 and \u2018set-point\u2019 VL values were highly correlated, although the former was higher, as would be expected (data not shown). From a clinical perspective, it is worth noting that if individuals with PHI are commenced on ART immediately, then their \u2018set-point\u2019 VL will not be known, potentially placing greater impact on the less dynamic HIV-1 DNA measure."

Nevertheless, the potential for there to be a short window period during which plasma viraemia has rebounded but HIV-1 DNA levels have not risen significantly is encouraging, if future closely-monitored TI studies are to be undertaken. Concerns around \u2018re-seeding\u2019 the reservoir are very real, and it is important that any possible harm associated with a TI is limited. It is therefore also re-assuring that in our admittedly small sub-study, re-initiation of ART subsequently restored HIV-1 DNA to pre-TI levels."

Of interest, the baseline VL and CD4 prior to therapy were also not predictive of time to rebound. In contrast to other studies exploring TI, we have a larger and randomly allocated patient group who have received similar durations of ART at PHI and hence can be directly compared. Although viral rebound was observed in all individuals after TI ultimately, this is the first report of a randomised cohort that has shown that time to viral rebound and primary study end point could be predicted by HIV-1 DNA measurement at TI."

Why was Total DNA predictive for rebound to 400 copies/ml but not 50 copies/ml? Much larger studies will be needed to answer most of these questions, however our sub-analysis of rebounding patients suggested that a high Total DNA at TI was more indicative of a higher VL rebound (i.e. &gt;400 copies), whereas a low DNA level was not associated with a lower rebound. These data might indicate that a Total DNA level at TI is better at predicting the patients who will be quick to rebound rather than those who will maintain suppression. A question for larger studies to answer will be to define what the viral load cut-off should be for considering rebound, rather than just assuming the assay with the lowest limit of detection is best. Data from at least one other study (<a href=\"#bib34\">Riabaudo et al., 2009</a>) indicate that a level greater than 50 copies/ml may be more relevant. The difference between the Integrated and Total DNA is also interesting. Integrated DNA should be the most biologically relevant marker, based on the assumption that unintegrated HIV-1 DNA forms are thought not to contribute to rebound viraemia. However, the assay for Total HIV-1 DNA is much simpler and with tighter coefficients of variation, possibly due to the lack of a pre-amplification PCR stage. Another important factor impacting our data is that the median estimated time from seroconversion was 73.8 days, and so most of our patients would be starting therapy at Fiebig stage IV or later. It is possible that earlier identification of PHI and initiation of ART would have a greater impact on the reservoir and post-treatment control, and it is important that large studies are undertaken to determine this."

These do not, however, have an encouraging history with previous studies set in the context of therapeutic vaccination or CD4 T cell restoration, resulting in rapid viraemic rebound and even harm (<a href=\"#bib11\">Strategies for Management of Antiretroviral Therapy (SMART) Study Group et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Angel et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Garcia et al., 2013</a>). Additionally, the recent report of viral rebound in the case of the Mississippi baby, means that greater understanding of mechanisms behind post-treatment control is needed. The potential, therefore, to develop an algorithm to combine various biomarkers to help predict individuals suitable for such studies is appealing. These data are evidence that such an algorithm may be possible, and that a marker as simple as HIV-1 DNA could be an important component."

In brief, SPARTAC was an international open Randomised Controlled Trial enrolling adults with PHI within 6 months of a last negative, equivocal or incident HIV-1 test. All participants gave written informed consent. Research ethics committees in each country approved the trial. Time of seroconversion was estimated as the midpoint of last negative/equivocal and first positive tests, or date of incident test. Participants were randomised to receive ART for 48 weeks (ART-48), 12 weeks (ART-12) or no therapy (standard of care, SOC). The primary endpoint was a composite of two events: if participants either reached a CD4 count of &lt;350 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> (&gt;3 months after randomization and confirmed within 4 weeks) or initiated long-term ART. This provided an immunological surrogate of clinical progression, but also allowed inclusion of those participants who commenced ART at CD4 cell counts greater than 350 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>. Time to virological failure of participants randomized to ART-48 (two analyses using both 50 and 400 HIV-1 RNA copies/ml as the cut-off [two consecutive readings]) was a secondary endpoint."

There is also agreement that while overall this manuscript is well written it is too long and too detailed and is distracting from the key and novel scientific advance. Careful editing of established and already published aspects and referencing with existing literature is needed. The Discussion also can be shortened and authors should stay focused on the novel and important findings. The novel finding is the predictive value of HIV DNA and time to viral rebound and keeping the focus on this will strengthen the manuscript. The finding is important as it can be used as a predictive marker in advancing the HIV cure research agenda. This finding and its significance is lost in the detailed presentation and discussion of novel and not so novel data. Reviewer comments build around this novel finding for a more nuanced picture to emerge in terms of request for more details on measurement of DNA, for example an explanation on the somewhat paradoxical situation as to why free DNA is more important than integrated DNA and to the analysis of the DNA as a continuous variable rather than as a dichotomy."

In purist terms the integrated DNA should reflect the true \u2018reservoir\u2019 of replication competent viral DNA, however the presence of unintegrated genomes (as reflected in the greater absolute quantity of Total DNA) may be indicative of slower dynamics of ART suppression, compartmentalization of replication or even on-going replication in the face of ART, depending on one\u2019s reading of the literature. To fully understand these issues will require larger studies, as currently planned by the ACTG in the US, and ourselves in the UK. We have explored these questions in the discussion, but we feel that a detailed analysis of these variables would be better undertaken through these larger cohorts designed to look at these questions, and we hope the reviewers will be accepting of this approach."
