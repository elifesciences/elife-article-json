We developed a physiological assay to monitor lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> store refilling using specific activators of lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels to repeatedly induce lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> release. In contrast to the prevailing view that lysosomal acidification drives Ca<sup>2+</sup> into the lysosome, inhibiting the V-ATPase H+ pump did not prevent Ca<sup>2+</sup> refilling. Instead, pharmacological depletion or chelation of Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) Ca<sup>2+</sup> prevented lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores from refilling. More specifically, antagonists of ER IP3 receptors (IP3Rs) rapidly and completely blocked Ca<sup>2+</sup> refilling to lysosomes, but not in cells lacking IP3Rs. Furthermore, reducing ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> or blocking IP3Rs caused a dramatic LSD-like lysosome storage phenotype. By closely apposing each other, the ER may serve as a direct and primary source of Ca<sup>2+</sup> to the lysosome."
