Here we describe a rational-design approach that enables rapid development of efficient <i>cis</i>-acting aptazyme riboswitches. We identified communication-module characteristics associated with aptazyme functionality through analysis of a 32-aptazyme test panel. We then developed a scoring system that predicts an aptazymes\u2019s activity by integrating three characteristics of communication-module bases: hydrogen bonding, base stacking, and distance to the enzymatic core. We validated the power and generality of this approach by designing aptazymes responsive to three distinct ligands, each with markedly wider dynamic ranges than any previously reported. These aptayzmes efficiently regulated adeno-associated virus (AAV)-vectored transgene expression in cultured mammalian cells and mice, highlighting one application of these broadly usable regulatory switches. Our approach enables efficient, protein-independent control of gene expression by a range of small molecules."

Here we describe a rational-design approach that enables rapid development of efficient <i>cis</i>-acting aptazyme riboswitches. We identified communication-module characteristics associated with aptazyme functionality through analysis of a 32-aptazyme test panel. We then developed a scoring system that predicts an aptazymes\u2019s activity by integrating three characteristics of communication-module bases: hydrogen bonding, base stacking, and distance to the enzymatic core. We validated the power and generality of this approach by designing aptazymes responsive to three distinct ligands, each with markedly wider dynamic ranges than any previously reported. These aptayzmes efficiently regulated adeno-associated virus (AAV)-vectored transgene expression in cultured mammalian cells and mice, highlighting one application of these broadly usable regulatory switches. Our approach enables efficient, protein-independent control of gene expression by a range of small molecules."

They therefore have a number of potential scientific and medical applications. Aptazymes are a class of engineered riboswitches that control gene expression by small molecule-induced self-cleavage of a ribozyme (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1A</a>). The first aptazyme was developed by the Breaker group (<a href=\"#bib30\">Tang and Breaker, 1997</a>) by fusing an ATP binding aptamer with a minimal hammerhead ribozyme (<a href=\"#bib27\">Scott et al., 2013</a>). This aptazyme was functional only in cell-free systems. The discovery of tertiary interaction between stems I and II of the full-length hammerhead ribozyme (<a href=\"#bib8\">De la Pe\u00f1a et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Khvorova et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Martick and Scott, 2006</a>) and the development of optimized hammerhead ribozymes efficient in mammalian cell culture and in vivo (<a href=\"#bib39\">Yen et al., 2004</a>) led to the development of hammerhead ribozyme-based aptazymes functional in yeast (<a href=\"#bib34\">Win and Smolke, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Wittmann and Suess, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Klauser et al., 2015</a>; <a href=\"#bib31\">Townshend et al., 2015</a>), or mammalian cells (<a href=\"#bib19\">Kumar et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib2\">Auslander et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Nomura et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib32\">Wei et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Beilstein et al., 2015</a>). These aptazymes have been tested for a range of applications, including construction of synthetic gene networks in yeast (<a href=\"#bib35\">Win and Smolke, 2008</a>), and regulation of transgene expression (<a href=\"#bib14\">Ketzer et al., 2012</a>) or virus replication (<a href=\"#bib15\">Ketzer et al., 2014</a>) in mammalian cell culture. Using IL-2-based positive-feedback signal amplification, a theophylline-regulated aptazyme with a narrow dynamic range has been shown to control proliferation of transduced T cell lines in mice (<a href=\"#bib7\">Chen et al., 2010</a>). To date, no aptazyme has been described to control gene expression in primary animal cells in vivo."

These aptazymes share a common architecture, composed of an optimized <i>Schistosoma mansoni</i> hammerhead ribozyme N107 (<a href=\"#bib39\">Yen et al., 2004</a>), a communication module, and a Tc-binding aptamer (<a href=\"#bib37\">Xiao et al., 2008</a>) (<a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A</a>). They differ only in their communication module, a region that signals the binding state of the aptamer to the ribozyme. We started by directly fusing four base pairs of the P1 stem of the aptamer to the base of ribozyme stem III (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1B</a>). The resulting aptazyme (Tc01) was placed downstream of a gene encoding <i>Gaussia</i> luciferase (GLuc). As expected, Tc01-regulated GLuc expression in the absence of Tc was markedly lower than that from control constructs without any regulatory elements (CNTL) or with an inactive form of the N107 ribozyme (in-N107), likely due to high level of ribozyme auto-activation triggered by its stable communication module. In addition, the aptazyme had a narrow (2.1-fold) dynamic range (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1C</a>). We then generated 31 variants of Tc01 by altering Tc01 communication-module bases by trial and error (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1D</a>\u00a0and <a href=\"#fig1s1\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B</a>). These variants were again placed downstream of the GLuc gene and tested for their ability to control GLuc expression in HeLa cells using varying concentrations of Tc (<a href=\"#fig1s2\">Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). A comparison of GLuc expression at 0 \u00b5M Tc (basal expression, BE) and GLuc expression at 100 \u00b5M Tc (ligand-inhibited expression, LE) is plotted in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1E</a>. As shown, this test panel exhibited widely varying BE and the Tc-induced fold change in expression. To correct for the non-specific inhibitory effects of Tc on gene expression, we report here the corrected dynamic range (CDR), namely the Tc-induced fold change in aptazyme-regulated gene expression divided by the fold change observed in the expression of a control construct (CNTL) lacking any regulatory elements."

We then focused on BE because it reflects the efficiency of ribozyme-mediated mRNA cleavage in the absence of ligand and is primarily determined by the communication module (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>). We hypothesized that an energy-like function of the communication-module sequence which predicts BE would identify values of the function where a small change would have the largest impact on target gene expression. Thus, for communication modules with these values, additional energy provided by aptamer binding would yield the largest differences between BE and LE, and thus the largest CDR. We therefore sought to construct a simple function that correlates with the rank order of BE among our 32 aptazymes."

In particular, when base pairs with few hydrogen bonds (G-U or U-U) were placed close to the ribozyme, as in Tc14 and Tc08, higher BE levels were observed. Accordingly, we assigned every base a weight reflecting its proximity to the enzymatic core, and multiplied that weight by the number of hydrogen bonds to get a Weighted Hydrogen Bond Score (WHBS). We found that WHBS better correlates with the rank order of BE than does \u0394G<sub>CM</sub> or the unweighted sum of hydrogen bonds in the communication module (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>\u00a0and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1B\u2013E</a>)."

The resulting Weighted Hydrogen-bond and Stacking Score (WHSS) better correlates with rank order of aptazyme BE values than does WHBS or \u0394G<sub>CM\u00a0</sub>(<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>\u00a0and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C\u2013F</a>).

Indeed, when CDR is plotted against WHSS (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a>), the highest CDRs were observed at WHSS values 6.75 (Tc15) and 6.92 (Tc12).

This effect is due to a high LE rather than a lower-than-expected BE. Comparison of Tc31 and Tc32 with Tc11 indicates that the aptamer-proximal base pair accounts for their low CDR values (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2I</a>). Consistent with this, aptamers with WHSS values similar to Tc31 and Tc32, but with an aptamer-proximal A-U base pair, had higher CDR values (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2J and K</a>). Because a communication module with WHSS value around 6.7 tends to have lower annealing energy than the P1 stem of the original Tc aptamer, we speculated that an aptamer-proximal base pair with few hydrogen bonds lowers the affinity of the aptamer for its ligand. In addition, proximity of this base pair to the aptamer may subtly impair aptamer folding. We therefore used the base pair present in the original aptamer, or one with higher stability, in our subsequent efforts. When this final <i>ad hoc</i> principle was incorporated, aptazymes with WHSS values 6.7 \u00b1 0.3 had consistently higher CDRs than aptazymes outside of this range (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2L</a>)."

                                "text": "We then sought to determine if this basic heuristic was general to a wider range of aptazymes. We evaluated three more validation panels: (1) aptazymes using the same tetracycline aptamer, but fused at a different aptamer stem (Tc-P2 aptazymes), (2) aptazymes constructed using a theophylline aptamer (Theo aptazymes), and (3) aptazymes constructed with a guanine aptamer (Gua aptazymes). To date, all reported Tc aptazymes are fused at the aptamer P1 stem (<a href=\"#bib34\">Win and Smolke, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Wittmann and Suess, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Beilstein et al., 2015</a>), but the structure of the Tc aptamer suggests that Tc-binding might have a larger effect on the P2 stem than the P1 stem (<a href=\"#bib37\">Xiao et al., 2008</a>). We therefore explored variants of our Tc aptazymes in which the ribozyme was fused to the P2 stem of the Tc aptamer (Tc-P2 aptazymes; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3C</a>) rather than the P1 stem (Tc-P1 aptazymes; <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a>). All aptazymes except Tc39 and Tc44 exhibited high CDR (CDR \u2265 10 \u00b1 0.5, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Tc39 had a relatively low WHSS of 6.0, and Tc44 was intentionally designed with an aptamer-proximal A-U replacing the original G-C pair. Thus the basic principles developed with Tc-P1 aptazymes extend to a novel Tc-P2 aptazyme architecture. One of the Tc aptazymes with this alternative architecture, Tc40, outperformed all Tc-P1 aptazymes, and was used in subsequent studies. We then generated aptazymes constructed from entirely different aptamers, specifically those binding theophylline (<a href=\"#bib12\">Jenison et al., 1994</a>) and guanine (Gua) (<a href=\"#bib21\">Mandal et al., 2003</a>) (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3E\u2013H</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1A,D, and E</a>). In both cases, we could readily generate aptazymes of high CDR, establishing the modularity of our approach."

Despite the diversity of these aptazymes, WHSS well predicted BE, consistent with our use of a common ribozyme, and the generality of our approach. Similarly, all aptazymes with high CDR had WHSS values near the region (WHSS 6.7 \u00b1 0.3; grey) found to be optimal in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H</a> (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3J</a>). Finally, we directly compared our best Tc, Theo, and Gua aptazymes with previously described aptazyme off-switches with the highest reported dynamic ranges. Consistent with the original reports, Tc aptazyme 9.19 (<a href=\"#bib36\">Wittmann and Suess, 2011</a>) showed no functionality in mammalian cells (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3K</a>), while both P1-F5 (<a href=\"#bib2\">Auslander et al., 2010</a>) and RzGuaM5 (<a href=\"#bib25\">Nomura et al., 2012</a>) showed a maximal dynamic range of approximately 5-fold (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3L and M</a>). In each case, our rationally designed aptazymes substantially outperformed these previously described aptazymes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3K\u2013M</a>, and <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2A\u2013C</a>). We also directly compared our Tc40 off-switch with a previously described Tc aptazyme on-switch, 3\u2019K19 (<a href=\"#bib3\">Beilstein et al., 2015</a>). Again Tc40 showed significantly higher CDR (19.6-fold at 100 \u00b5M Tc) than the CDR (6.6-fold at 100 \u00b5M Tc) of this previously described aptazyme (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3N</a>, and <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2D</a>)."

We generated a Tc40 variant, Tc45, in which ribozyme N107 is replaced by the closely related hammerhead ribozyme N117 (<a href=\"#bib39\">Yen et al., 2004</a>). Tc40 or Tc45 were then inserted either upstream (5\u2032) or downstream (3\u2032) of the GLuc gene, as a single copy (Tc40-5\u2032, Tc40-3\u2032, Tc45-3\u2032), in tandem repeats (Tc40-5\u20325\u2032, Tc45-3\u20323\u2032), or across the GLuc gene (Tc40\u00d745) (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4A</a>). We observed in transiently transfected cells that Tc45-3\u2032 has a lower CDR than Tc40-3\u2032, but a higher BE, advantageous when aptazymes are used in tandem (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). When these aptazymes were combined, with Tc40 placed 5\u2032 of the GLuc reporter and Tc45 placed 3\u2032, the resulting construct (Tc40\u00d745) provided a 44-fold CDR with a 41% BE. We then measured regulation of GLuc in cells generated by retroviral transduction. Again, Tc40\u00d745 exhibited a wider dynamic range than either Tc40-3\u2032 or Tc45-3\u2032 (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>) and the regulation observed was completely reversed when Tc was withdrawn (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4D</a>).

In this context, Tc40-3\u2032 worked nearly as effectively as Tc40\u00d745. We therefore assayed the ability of Tc40-3\u2032 to regulate AAV-mediated expression of human coagulation factor IX and etanercept (Enbrel), a fusion of a TNF-receptor ectodomain and the human IgG1 Fc domain (<a href=\"#bib23\">Mohler et al., 1993</a>).

In both cases, their expression was dramatically reduced by 30 \u00b5M Tc (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B and C</a>), a concentration that is well tolerated clinically and readily achievable with oral administration (<a href=\"#bib1\">Agwuh and MacGowan, 2006</a>)."

We prepared high-titer recombinant AAV1 viruses carrying the GLuc gene regulated or not by Tc40\u00d745. These two vectors were then injected into the gastrocnemius muscle of BALB/c mice. Two in vivo\u00a0studies were performed. In the first, ten male mice were injected with a Tc40\u00d745-regulated or control vector, and imaged for luciferase expression on day 10 post injection. Mice were then treated four days later with tetracycline (250 mg/kg) or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for four days, and again imaged. All mice injected with control or Tc40\u00d745-regulated vectors exhibited robust luciferase expression in the gastrocnemius muscle, and Tc treatment significantly reduced luciferase expression in the Tc40\u00d745 mice but not the control mice (<a href=\"#fig5s1\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). In a second experiment, fourteen female mice were again injected with a Tc40\u00d745-regulated or control vector. Two weeks after injection, the mice were treated for three days with tetracycline or PBS, and imaged (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5D</a>). Combining both studies, we obtained an average dynamic range of 6.9-fold in vivo\u00a0(<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5E</a>), lower than that observed in tissue culture cell lines. We speculate that this difference is due to the high metabolism of tetracycline in mice (<a href=\"#bib28\">Sizemore et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib1\">Agwuh and MacGowan, 2006</a>), and inefficient access of tetracycline to AAV1-transduced muscle cells (<a href=\"#bib6\">Bocker et al., 1984</a>). Ribozyme based control of AAV-transgene expression in mice has been reported (<a href=\"#bib39\">Yen et al., 2004</a>), however this switch control is possibly mediated by direct incorporation of the regulatory drug toyocamycin into the ribozyme RNA (<a href=\"#bib38\">Yen et al., 2006</a>). Therefore, our data present the first example of aptazyme-mediated regulation in primary animal tissues in vivo."

For example, they afford simple and immediate regulation of gene expression in cell biology studies. In addition, aptazymes can be introduced by CRISPR/Cas9 into an untranslated region of an exon to exogenously control endogenous genes in their native contexts. They also have the potential to transform gene therapy, allowing controlled dosing of a biologic with a well tolerated drug (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5A\u2013C</a>). In these applications, aptazymes have several key strengths. First, they are smaller than most other gene-regulation systems, typically less than 200 base pairs. They therefore can be easily included in gene therapy vectors such as AAV with limited space for additional genes. Second, in contrast to transcription factor-dependent systems like Tet-Off (<a href=\"#bib11\">Gossen and Bujard, 1992</a>), aptazyme-mediated regulation does not require an immunogenic non-self protein. Third, aptazymes cleave in <i>cis</i>, and only the message bearing an aptazyme is affected. They are therefore highly specific, with few off-target effects. Finally, as we show here, they can be tailored to different aptamers regulated by different ligands, including those shown to be safe in humans."

                        "text": "Here we describe a straightforward method for converting aptamers into aptazymes with wide dynamic ranges in mammalian cells. We began with several straightforward and intuitive principles. For example, a communication module that anneals with too high overall energy will induce premature auto-activation of the ribozyme, even when the aptamer is unbound. In contrast, a communication module that is unstable will not convey the state of the aptamer to the ribozyme. However, between these limiting cases, we found that the communication-module annealing energy correlated poorly with an aptazyme\u2019s dynamic range (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A and C</a>). As shown here, the reason for this poor correlation is that base pairs proximal to the ribozyme have a disproportionate impact on the ribozyme\u2019s enzymatic activity. Any energy-like function describing the impact of the communication module on the ribozyme should therefore take into account the distance of communication-module bases to ribozyme. Accordingly, we developed a scoring function, WHSS, based on the weighted sum of hydrogen bonds and inter-strand base-stacking interactions. This function accurately predicted the rank order of the BE of a test panel of 32 aptazymes (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a> and <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1F</a>), and was validated with 21 newly designed aptazymes (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3I</a>). Critically, when BE was plotted against WHSS, an inflection point was observed in the vicinity of a WHSS value of 6.7. As the WHSS values increased after this point, the BE of aptazymes rapidly decreased (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2G</a>). At this inflection point, then, additional energy provide by the ligand-bound aptamer has a greater impact on aptazyme activity and therefore its dynamic range (<a href=\"#fig2s2\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2C and D</a>). Thus, in most cases, aptazymes with WHSS values near 6.7 exhibited relatively high CDRs (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2H and L</a>). We also observed that communication-module bases immediately adjacent to the aptamer affected CDR independently of WHSS (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2I\u2013K</a>), likely due to their effect on ligand affinity."

                        "text": "Importantly, we show that this approach is general. For example, it has allowed us to develop tetracycline-regulated aptazymes with two different architectures. These aptazymes exhibited high levels of basal expression and dynamic ranges wider than any previously described aptazymes (<a href=\"#bib36\">Wittmann and Suess, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Beilstein et al., 2015</a>). To underscore the modularity of this approach, we also developed aptazymes regulated by two additional ligands, theophylline and guanine. In both cases, the newly developed aptazymes again significantly outperformed all previously described aptazymes (<a href=\"#bib2\">Auslander et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Nomura et al., 2012</a>). These data suggest that any aptamer which anneals an accessible stem region upon ligand binding would likely be convertible to an efficient aptazyme off-switch. Ligand-aptamer binding-induced stem formation or stabilization could also be used to develop aptazyme on-switches. For example, an on-switch could use ligand-induced stem formation or stabilization to hide the hammerhead-ribozyme loop II or bulge I sequences important to ribozyme activity (<a href=\"#bib8\">De la Pe\u00f1a et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib16\">Khvorova et al., 2003</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Martick and Scott, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Win and Smolke, 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib3\">Beilstein et al., 2015</a>). Our empirical approach may therefore be used to establish WHSS-like scoring functions for generating aptazyme on-switches. Thus this study provides a general rational-design method for rapidly converting diverse aptamers into aptazymes with wide regulatory ranges in mammalian cells."

Specifically, Spearman\u2019s rank correlation coefficient (\u03c1) (<a href=\"#bib40\">Zar, 1998</a>) was \u22120.64 for \u0394G<sub>CM</sub> and \u22120.80 for HBN (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). We observed that hydrogen bond interactions from every communication-module base pair contributed to basal expression (BE), but that the location of these hydrogen bonds relative to the ribozyme determined the scale of this contribution (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B and C</a>). Accordingly, we assigned every communication-module base pair an empirically determined weight reflecting its proximity to the ribozyme, and multiplied this weight by the number of hydrogen bonds to assign a Weighted Hydrogen Bond Score (WHBS). Specifically, we observed a Spearman\u2019s rank correlation coefficient of \u22120.91 when the ribozyme-proximal starting base pair (A-U) was assigned a weight of 1.0, and the subsequent base pairs were sequentially assigned weights of 5/6, 4/6, 3/6, and 2/6 (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). When longer communication modules were considered, bases 6, 7, 8, and 9 were assigned weights of 1/6, 5/36, 4/36, and 3/36, respectively. We also observed that inter-strand purine base stacking in the communication module also affected BE in a position-dependent manner (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E and F</a>). We thus added a weighted sum of base-stacking interactions to the WHBS to calculate a Weighted Hydrogen-bond and Stacking Score (WHSS) for each aptazyme. The relative energy of a hydrogen bond and an RNA base-stacking interaction remains undefined (<a href=\"#bib9\">Egli, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Johnson et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib29\">\u0160poner et al., 2012</a>). However, when potential inter-strand purine base-stacking interactions were assigned one half (G-G) or one quarter (A-A, A-G) of a hydrogen bond, we observed an optimal rank-order correlation (\u03c1=\u22120.94) between WHSS and BE (<a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). Calculated \u0394G<sub>CM</sub>, HBN, WHBS, and WHSS values for all aptayzmes are presented in <a href=\"#SD1-data\">Figure 2\u2014source data\u00a01</a> and <a href=\"#SD2-data\">Figure 3\u2014source data 1</a>."

The authors use a novel intellectual framework to guide the engineering of unique linker sequences or communication modules between ligand-binding aptamer domains and self-cleaving ribozymes. By synthesizing and testing a series of RNA constructs, the authors generate a set of empirical data that reveals the importance of hydrogen bond number, base stacking, and distance between key RNA structures to functional switch outcomes. For successful switches, the binding of a corresponding ligand to the aptamer domain alters ribozyme function at a level sufficient to substantially affect expression from mRNAs carrying the engineered RNAs. The engineering approach is demonstrated to apply to multiple different aptamer domains, suggesting that the design principles be applicable to a large diversity of additional RNA domains. The concepts and methods presented in this work should permit others to create novel types of engineered riboswitches for practical applications."

The ability to control gene expression in a precise manner has been a long-sought goal by a number of laboratories, as various applications can be envisioned. As examples, the capability to create new switches quickly would allow researchers to more easily artificially regulate, and thereby study, numerous biological systems, and synthetic biologists would have a versatile set of gene control tools with which to create new regulatory networks. Moreover, there will be opportunities to use engineered RNA switches for future gene therapy applications."

Perhaps future researchers will add additional biophysical rigor to understand precisely how this approach works at atomic resolution. However, it seems very likely that the authors have made an excellent technical advance for this field, and I do not think this work should suffer publication delays until all this is better understood. The success of their WHSS system plus the ad hoc retention of the aptamer-proximal base-pair is remarkable. Simply put, it seems likely that other researchers can easily adopt the strategy described by the authors to create novel RNA switches that work well in cells. I have only two very minor comments:"

Moreover, they demonstrate that the approach can be extended to theophylline- and guanine-dependent systems and that in these cases also improved performances are obtained. In addition, they demonstrate the application of tetracycline-dependent switches in AAV-mediated transgene expression in mice.

This switch has been engineered to function in yeast, however for comparison it is utilized in mammalian cells. It is reported that the switch is not working under these conditions; this is also why Suess and coworkers engineered Tc switches in mammalian cells which function very nicely as ON-switches. Hence the comparison is not valid and without further comment very unjustified sheds doubt on the work of Suess and co-workers. Why not compare the ON-switches with the present Tc switches? It is the dynamic range that defines the performance, even if the switching mode is opposite."

This work builds off seminal papers describing riboswitches and aptazymes (Breaker lab) and earlier engineering of hammerhead ribozymes in mammalian cells (Mulligan lab) to establish important design principles across the different RNA modules (i.e., communication module, aptamer, ribozyme) to quantitatively characterize the key determinants that govern basal expression, ligand inhibition and dynamic range of their engineered aptazymes. Specifically, the authors elucidate the impact of the number of hydrogen bonds (as opposed to \u03b4-G) and the distance of communication-module bases to ribozyme have on basal expression and dynamic range of the aptazyme switches. This allowed the authors to develop a scoring function (WHSS) to predict the basal expression of 32 aptazymes that was subsequently validated with 21 newly designed aptazymes. Notably, the authors applied their findings to develop aptazymes of different architectures and for two additional ligands (theophylline and guanine). The systematic and exhaustive suite of aptazyme variants coupled by their detailed characterization is an important strength of this manuscript and a necessary and welcome step in this field. Finally, the authors describe an impressive demonstration of aptazyme-mediated gene regulation in a mouse model. Overall, I think the paper is clear and describes a rigorous set of experiments to support the key results and conclusions of the manuscript.

We cloned both into 3'-UTR of a <i>Gaussia</i> luciferase (GLuc) gene in pcDNA3.1(+) plasmid. Both were flanked with same spacer sequences (Win and Smolke, 2007) to avoid interference of aptazyme folding by the surrounding sequences, and inserted between <i>Bam</i>HI and <i>Eco</i>RI restriction sites immediately downstream of the GLuc stop codon. They were then transfected into HeLa cells for measurement of corrected dynamic range (CDR) in response to different concentrations of Tc. The CDR data and relative GLuc expression data were presented in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3N</a> and <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2D</a>. Consistent with our previous data with Tc40 in different plasmid context, as well as that reported by Beilstein et al., Tc40 (19.6-fold at 100 \u00b5M Tc) showed significantly better CDR than that of 3'K19 (6.6-fold at 100 \u00b5M Tc)."

The ability to control gene expression in a precise manner has been a long-sought goal by a number of laboratories, as various applications can be envisioned. As examples, the capability to create new switches quickly would allow researchers to more easily artificially regulate, and thereby study, numerous biological systems, and synthetic biologists would have a versatile set of gene control tools with which to create new regulatory networks. Moreover, there will be opportunities to use engineered RNA switches for future gene therapy applications.</i>"

Using their \"Weighted Hydrogen-bond and Stacking Score\" or WHSS, they demonstrate that each communication module made exhibits a predictable value for basal gene expression, ligand-inhibited expression, and corrected dynamic range. Perhaps future researchers will add additional biophysical rigor to understand precisely how this approach works at atomic resolution. However, it seems very likely that the authors have made an excellent technical advance for this field, and I do not think this work should suffer publication delays until all this is better understood. The success of their WHSS system plus the ad hoc retention of the aptamer-proximal base-pair is remarkable. Simply put, it seems likely that other researchers can easily adopt the strategy described by the authors to create novel RNA switches that work well in cells.</i>"

Also, we did not include a comparison with a very useful on switch that functions nicely in mammalian cells. We have now addressed this by including such a comparison (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3N</a>). We would also note that our quantitative results conform nicely to descriptions of both on- and off-switches published by the Suess lab. To address a question of this reviewer, <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3K-M</a> were experiments done in the lab, not taken from the literature. We have included GLuc relative expression data supporting <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3K-M</a> in <a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2</a>.
