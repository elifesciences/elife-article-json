                    "text": "Phospholipid scrambling (PLS) is a ubiquitous cellular mechanism involving the regulated bidirectional transport of phospholipids down their concentration gradient between membrane leaflets. ANO6/TMEM16F has been shown to be essential for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent PLS, but controversy surrounds whether ANO6 is a phospholipid scramblase or an ion channel like other ANO/TMEM16 family members. Combining patch clamp recording with measurement of PLS, we show that ANO6 elicits robust Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent PLS coinciding with ionic currents that are explained by ionic leak during phospholipid translocation. By analyzing ANO1-ANO6 chimeric proteins, we identify a domain in ANO6 necessary for PLS and sufficient to confer this function on ANO1, which normally does not scramble. Homology modeling shows that the scramblase domain forms an unusual hydrophilic cleft that faces the lipid bilayer and may function to facilitate translocation of phospholipid between membrane leaflets. These findings provide a mechanistic framework for understanding PLS and how ANO6 functions in this process."

ANO6/TMEM16F has been shown to be essential for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent PLS, but controversy surrounds whether ANO6 is a phospholipid scramblase or an ion channel like other ANO/TMEM16 family members. Combining patch clamp recording with measurement of PLS, we show that ANO6 elicits robust Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent PLS coinciding with ionic currents that are explained by ionic leak during phospholipid translocation. By analyzing ANO1-ANO6 chimeric proteins, we identify a domain in ANO6 necessary for PLS and sufficient to confer this function on ANO1, which normally does not scramble. Homology modeling shows that the scramblase domain forms an unusual hydrophilic cleft that faces the lipid bilayer and may function to facilitate translocation of phospholipid between membrane leaflets. These findings provide a mechanistic framework for understanding PLS and how ANO6 functions in this process."

Next, the scrambling of phospholipids in these cells was measured while the flow of ions through ANO6 was also recorded. These experiments revealed that these two processes happened almost simultaneously.

Furthermore, computer models of this \u2018scrambling domain\u2019 suggest that it forms an unusual groove that faces into the cell membrane, and that could help phospholipids to shuttle between the inner and outer layers of the membrane. Alternatively, this groove could interact with other proteins to regulate phospholipid scrambling; and if so, further work will be needed to identify these unknown proteins."

In eukaryotic plasma membranes, the outer leaflet is enriched in phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin and the inner cytoplasmic-facing leaflet is rich in phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn) (<a href=\"#bib13\">Bretscher, 1972</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Fadeel and Xue, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Lhermusier et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib91\">van Meer, 2011</a>). This asymmetry is established by ATP-dependent lipid flippases, most notably members of the P4 ATPase family (<a href=\"#bib64\">Panatala et al., 2015</a>) and ABC transporters (<a href=\"#bib11\">Borst et al., 2000</a>), that actively transport phospholipids to one leaflet of the membrane and are important in membrane biogenesis. Phospholipid asymmetry plays critical roles in membrane function in two ways. (1) Charges on the phospholipid head groups bind and regulate protein function. The best known examples may be the effects of phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate on ion channel proteins (<a href=\"#bib82\">Suh and Hille, 2008</a>), but PtdSer and PtdEtn play equally important roles (<a href=\"#bib25\">Fairn et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib41\">Jeong and Conboy, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Kay and Grinstein, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib38\">Hosseini et al., 2014</a>). (2) The different molecular shapes (e.g., cylindrical or conical) of various lipids determine membrane curvature which is key to membrane trafficking and fusion (<a href=\"#bib28\">Graham and Kozlov, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib9\">Bigay and Antonny, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib96\">Xu et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib81\">Suetsugu et al., 2014</a>)."

PLSases play essential roles in the synthesis of glycoconjugates, such as N-glycosylated proteins and GPI-anchored proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (<a href=\"#bib67\">Pomorski and Menon, 2006</a>). Moreover, at the plasma membrane dissipation of phospholipid asymmetry by phospholipid scrambling (PLS) is a common cell signaling mechanism (<a href=\"#bib22\">Fadeel and Xue, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Bevers and Williamson, 2010</a>). For example, exposure of PtdSer on the external leaflet of the plasma membrane marks apoptotic cells for phagocytosis by macrophages and plays a key role in blood clotting (<a href=\"#bib24\">Fadok et al., 1992</a>; <a href=\"#bib92\">Verhoven et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Emoto et al., 1997</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Fadok et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"#bib86\">Suzuki et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Lhermusier et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib46\">Kay and Grinstein, 2013</a>). PtdSer exposure that occurs when platelets sense tissue damage serves as a catalytic surface for assembly of plasma-borne coagulation factors and a &gt;10<sup>6</sup>-fold increase in the rate of thrombin formation (<a href=\"#bib102\">Zwaal et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib72\">Sahu et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib47\">Kay et al., 2012</a>). PtdSer exposure also plays important roles in developmental processes that involve fusion of mononucleated progenitor cells to form multinucleated cells such as skeletal muscle (<a href=\"#bib41\">Jeong and Conboy, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib36\">Hochreiter-Hufford et al., 2013</a>), osteoclasts (<a href=\"#bib63\">Pajcini et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Helming and Gordon, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Harre et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib78\">Shin et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib93\">Verma et al., 2014</a>) and placental syncytiotrophoblasts (<a href=\"#bib40\">Huppertz et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib70\">Riddell et al., 2013</a>)."

However, the molecular mechanisms of PLS have remained elusive partly because PLS can be catalyzed by a variety of unrelated proteins. PLS is stimulated by two pathways, a rapid one triggered by increases in intracellular [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] and a slow caspase-dependent pathway associated with apoptosis (<a href=\"#bib74\">Schoenwaelder et al., 2009</a>). At least four different families of proteins have been implicated in PLS (<a href=\"#bib72\">Sahu et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Bevers and Williamson, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib51\">Lhermusier et al., 2011</a>). The first putative PLSases (PLSCR1\u2013PLSCR4) were identified by their ability to stimulate Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent PtdSer scrambling when incorporated into liposomes (<a href=\"#bib7\">Basse et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib17\">Comfurius et al., 1996</a>), but the role of PLSCRs in PLS is controversial because these proteins are small calmodulin-like molecules whose disruption in mice, flies, and worms has little effect on PLS (<a href=\"#bib1\">Acharya et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Fadeel and Xue, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib8\">Bevers and Williamson, 2010</a>; <a href=\"#bib62\">Ory et al., 2013</a>). More recently, the Xk-family protein Xkr8 has been shown to be necessary for caspase-dependent PtdSer scrambling that can be rescued by multiple Xkr8 paralogs (<a href=\"#bib83\">Suzuki et al., 2013a</a>, <a href=\"#bib85\">2014</a>). Unexpectedly, several G-protein coupled receptors including rhodopsin and the \u03b2-adrenergic receptor have also been shown to elicit PLS (<a href=\"#bib27\">Goren et al., 2014</a>). Although lipid-translocating ABC transporters and phospholipid synthesis may also play roles in PLS, these processes cannot fully explain PLS (<a href=\"#bib22\">Fadeel and Xue, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib27\">Goren et al., 2014</a>)."

However, the suggestion that ANO6 is a PLSase is confounded by the fact that other members of the anoctamin family, ANO1 and ANO2, encode the pore-forming subunits of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>\u2212</sup> channels (CaCCs) (<a href=\"#bib16\">Caputo et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib75\">Schroeder et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib99\">Yang et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib34\">Hartzell et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib19\">Duran and Hartzell, 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib65\">Pedemonte and Galietta, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib71\">Ruppersburg and Hartzell, 2014</a>).

We find that ANO6 expression in HEK cells induces robust Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated scramblase activity. (2) Is the ion channel activity of ANO6 related to PLS? We find that ANO6 currents are non-selective among ions and are activated simultaneously with PLS. This suggests that ionic currents are a consequence of phospholipid translocation. Chimeric constructs that exhibit PLS also exhibit simultaneous non-selective currents. Furthermore, we find that drugs that block ANO1 currents do not block ANO6 currents or PLS. This is consistent with the idea that the ion conduction pathway associated with ANO6 is unlike the ANO1 pore. (3) What are the domains of ANO6 that are required for PLS? We find that mutating several amino acids in ANO6 between TMD4 and TMD5 eliminates both PLS and ion channel activity. Furthermore, replacing as few as 15 amino acids in ANO1 in the TMD4-TMD5 region with ANO6 sequence confers robust PLS activity on ANO1, which normally does not elicit PLS activity."

Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent PtdSer exposure on the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane was measured by confocal imaging of two PtdSer probes, either LactoglobulinC2 fused to Clover fluorescent protein (\u2018LactC2\u2019) or Annexin-V conjugated to AlexaFluor-568 (\u2018Annexin-V\u2019) (<a href=\"#bib76\">Shi et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib39\">Hou et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Kay and Grinstein, 2011</a>).

The difference in PLS observed with ANO1 and ANO6 expressing cells was not explained by differences in expression as shown by western blot (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1F</a>). These data show clearly that ANO6 expression facilitates PLS. However, the finding that a small fraction (8%) of ANO6-FLAG<sub>3X</sub> expressing cells do not exhibit PLS raises the possibility that ANO6 may not be sufficient for PLS and may require additional components."

We patch-clamped HEK cells transiently expressing ANO6-EGFP and recorded ANO6 currents while simultaneously imaging Annexin-V binding. A typical experiment is shown in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3A</a> with average results in <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,C</a>. After establishing whole-cell recording, the time course of activation of membrane currents in ANO6-expressing cells was very slow even when the patch pipet solution contained high (200 \u03bcM) Ca<sup>2+</sup>. The currents typically began to increase 8 min after initiating whole cell recording, which is similar to that reported by others (<a href=\"#bib29\">Grubb et al., 2013</a>). Annexin-V binding usually became detectable 2\u20133 min later (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B,C</a>). The time courses of ANO6 current activation and Annexin-V binding were fit to the equation y = A2 + (A1 \u2212 A2)/1 + exp[(t \u2212 t<sub>0</sub>)/\u03c4]. Although the time constants of the increases in Annexin-V binding (\u03c4 = 2.24 \u00b1 0.15 min) and ANO6 current (\u03c4 = 2.31 \u00b1 0.34 min) were the same, the time (t<sub>0</sub>) at which Annexin-V fluorescence reached half of its maximal value [(A1 + A2)/2] was delayed 3 min relative to the current. In contrast to ANO6, ANO1 currents activated quickly after initiating whole-cell recording and then ran down with time (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3B</a>), as previously reported (<a href=\"#bib101\">Yu et al., 2014</a>) and no Annexin-V binding was observed."

However, we believe that the lag is partly explained by inherent differences in way the two events are measured. Patch clamp recording measures membrane conductance instantaneously, while detection of Annexin-V fluorescence requires the accumulation of Annexin-V on the membrane that is limited by its binding kinetics and the sensitivity of the fluorescence detection. Because Annexin binding to model bilayers is known to be slow and requires a threshold PtdSer concentration (<a href=\"#bib44\">Kastl et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"#bib76\">Shi et al., 2006</a>) and the numerical aperture of the microscope objective was 0.6, we believe that currents and PLS occur contemporaneously. This correlation suggested the possibility that currents reflect transmembrane ion leakage associated with the process of phospholipid transport. The alternative hypothesis that ionic current through ANO6 somehow activates PLS is excluded by the finding that PLS occurs normally in ANO6-expressing cells under conditions where there is no ionic current (e.g., cells voltage-clamped at 0 mV with identical intracellular and extracellular solutions where E<sub>rev</sub> for every ion is 0 mV)."

If ANO6 currents are a consequence of PLS, we would predict that their ionic selectivity would be very low. To explore the idea that ANO6 currents are essentially leak currents, we examined the ionic selectivity of the currents appearing after PLS was activated. In comparison to ANO1 currents, which exhibit robust anion:cation selectivity (P<sub>Na</sub>/P<sub>Cl</sub> = 0.03), the ANO6 current is highly non-selective (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5</a>). The ionic selectivity sequence was Na<sup>+</sup> &gt; Cl<sup>\u2212</sup> &gt; Cs<sup>+</sup> &gt; NMDG<sup>+</sup> (P<sub>Na</sub>/P<sub>Cl</sub> = 1.38, P<sub>Cs</sub>/P<sub>Cl</sub> = 0.6, P<sub>NMDG</sub>/P<sub>Cl</sub> = 0.48). These data are consistent with the permeation pathway of ANO6 being relatively large and capable of passing NMDG<sup>+</sup> which has a mean diameter of \u223c7.3 \u00c5. The finding that ANO6 currents have very low ionic selectivity and are activated contemporaneously with PLS over the same Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration range suggested that PLS and currents have the same underlying mechanism."

We employed computational approaches to gain insights into sequence differences that could define this functional difference. We analyzed Type-I and Type-II divergence between mammalian ANO1 and ANO6 as an indication of the functional relevance of different amino acids (<a href=\"#bib30\">Gu, 2006</a>). Sequences used for the analysis are shown in <a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a> and an alignment of ANO6 and ANO1 is shown in <a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>. Type I divergence occurs shortly after gene duplication and is characterized by amino acids that are highly conserved in one paralogous group of proteins and highly divergent in the other. Type II divergence occurs later when specific functions undergo positive selection within a paralogous group, resulting in conserved changes in amino acid properties. Type II divergence is exemplified by alignment positions that are identical within paralogous groups but have amino acids with radically different properties between paralogous groups. There are three major regions of Type-II divergence between ANO1 and ANO 6 (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6A</a>). These regions are located in (a) intracellular loop 1, (b) TMD4 and TMD5 and the short intracellular loop between them, and (c) the C-terminus adjacent to the last transmembrane domain. To test the functional significance of these divergent amino acids, we made chimeric constructs of ANO1 and ANO6, named X-Y-X_<i>i-j</i>, where ANO paralog X has its amino acids <i>i-j</i> replaced with aligned amino acids from ANO paralog Y. The 1-6-1 chimeras, made by replacing short segments of ANO1 sequence with ANO6 sequence, were first screened by confocal microscopy of cultures."

Therefore, we used the chimera 1-6-1_S532-G558 which activates PLS more slowly. About 5 min after establishing whole-cell recording before PLS was detectable, the current exhibited Cl<sup>\u2212</sup>-selectivity as indicated by a 35 mV shift in E<sub>rev</sub> upon switching from 150 mM CsCl to 15 CsCl (P<sub>Cs</sub>:P<sub>Cl</sub> = 0.15) (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8E</a>).

The idea that this cleft may be the phospholipid \u2018channel\u2019 is supported by our ANO6 homology model that predicts that the SCRD forms one side of this cleft.

                                "text": "Our data add to the already growing awareness that the ANO family is functionally split with some of its members being anion-selective ion channels (ANO1 and ANO2) and other members having the ability to transport lipids between membrane leaflets. This functional duplicity is reminiscent of two other anion channels, CFTR and CLCs, which apparently evolved from transporters. CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) is a Cl<sup>\u2212</sup> channel that evolved from ABC transporters (<a href=\"#bib26\">Gadsby et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib42\">Jordan et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"#bib60\">Miller, 2010</a>), and the CLC chloride channels CLC-1 and CLC-2 are members of a 9-gene family most of which are H<sup>+</sup>-Cl<sup>\u2212</sup> exchangers (<a href=\"#bib59\">Miller, 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib52\">Lisal and Maduke, 2008</a>). Additionally, the P4 ATPases that function as lipid flippases evolved from a family of ion transporters (<a href=\"#bib5\">Baldridge and Graham, 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib54\">Lopez-Marques et al., 2014</a>). One might speculate that the primordial ANO was a lipid transporter. During evolution, functional divergence likely occurred after gene duplication where the selective pressure for the major function (lipid transport) decreased, thus enabling the enhancement of the minor sub-function (ion transport). The finding that fungi have only one ANO gene, but that some fungal ANO homologs have PLS activity (<a href=\"#bib55\">Malvezzi et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib15\">Brunner et al., 2014</a>), supports the idea that PLS is an ancient function of ANOs. Our data suggest that the ionic currents carried by ANO6 are essentially flowing along with the scrambling lipids. Thus, the non-selective ion transport that occurs concomitantly with PLSase activity may have been a sub-function in the ancestral ANO. After gene duplication occurred, this sub-function may have evolved Cl<sup>\u2212</sup> ion specificity."

                                "text": "ANOs that have evolved into anion channels may be more Cl<sup>\u2212</sup> selective than the scrambling ANOs simply because the energy contour of the conduction pathway is altered by the absence of lipid substrate. Because Cl<sup>\u2212</sup> is more hydrophobic than its cationic cousins, it may be more suited to traverse the evolutionary remnants of the phospholipid pathway. Consistent with this idea is the fact that, compared to many voltage-gated cation channels, Cl<sup>\u2212</sup> channels are sadly non-selective: virtually all anions permeate and cations are often significantly permeable (<a href=\"#bib20\">Duran et al., 2010</a>). The pores of Cl<sup>\u2212</sup> channels are often modeled as large viaducts that provide selectivity based largely on ionic hydration energies (<a href=\"#bib18\">Dawson et al., 1999</a>; <a href=\"#bib69\">Qu and Hartzell, 2000</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Liu et al., 2003</a>). This low selectivity is precisely what one might expect to evolve from a transporter that previously transported phospholipids. The finding that we can convert ANO1 into a protein capable of catalyzing PLS provides further support for this hypothesis for ANO1 evolution. Like the ClC family, where a single glutamic acid residue can determine whether a protein is a H<sup>+</sup>-Cl<sup>\u2212</sup> transporter or a Cl<sup>\u2212</sup> channel, here we show that a few amino acids can convert ANO1 into a protein that supports PLS activity. However, we have not yet been able to convert ANO6 into a Cl<sup>\u2212</sup> selective ion channel. It is likely that additional changes outside the SCRD are required to confer Cl<sup>\u2212</sup> selectivity. This may be also be explained by epistasis, where evolutionary trajectories are blocked by the accumulation of neutral mutations that have no impact on the initial function (non-selective ion transport) but prevent acquisition of the new function (Cl<sup>\u2212</sup> selectivity) (<a href=\"#bib14\">Bridgham et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib12\">Breen et al., 2012</a>). <a href=\"#bib97\">Yang et al. (2011)</a> have reported that mutations of the last amino acid in the SCRD (Q559 in ANO6, K588 in ANO1) alters the ionic selectivity, but the changes are only 2\u20133-fold and do not shift selectivity from cation to anion."

However, our finding that the function of ANO1 can be converted by replacing a domain as small as 15 amino acids raises questions whether ANO1 might be a PLSase under appropriate conditions. Perhaps a missing subunit or regulatory enzyme could activate its PLSase activity. Alternatively, the SCRD may hold a vital interaction site for another component essential for this process or possess a key site of posttranscriptional modification required for activating this activity. In any case, it is clear that ANO1 function is intimately dependent on phospholipids (<a href=\"#bib88\">Terashima et al., 2013</a>) and understanding the relationships of the ANOs to membrane lipids is certain to be a major research goal for many laboratories in the coming years."

These two sequences share 23% identity and 37.4% similarly (calculated by the BLSM62 algorithm). A total of 12 gaps were introduced, primarily at the N- and C-termini and in loops between secondary structural elements. Secondary structure prediction was incorporated into the alignment for Phyre2 (and all of the other modeling servers used for comparison including Swiss-Model and Tasser). There are no gaps in or near the SCRD, with the nearest gaps located in extracellular loops between helices 3 and 4 (2 residue gap 24 residues away) and between helices 4 and 5 (1 residue gap 22 residues away). While overall alignment and homology model generation would benefit from a template with greater sequence identity, all modeling servers reported high confidence in the generated models with no variation in the placement of the SCRD between models. Model geometry was minimized and the model subjected to 500 steps of geometry idealization and energy minimization using Phenix (<a href=\"#bib2\">Adams et al., 2010</a>). The overall RMSD of C\u03b1 atoms in the final alignment was 1.485 \u00c5 with a Q-score of 0.667 (calculated by UCSF Chimera)."

By transplanting a small section of the 4th and 5th transmembrane segments of ANO6 into ANO1, they conferred upon ANO1 the ability to induce Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent phospholipid scrambling in transfected cells. Within a homology model, this region maps to a hydrophilic cleft in the membrane domain that appears to be the ion permeation route in ANO1, but can be molded into a phospholipid transporter by exchange of a few amino acids. These observations provide the first mechanistic insight into how substrate specificity of the ANO/TMEM16 family of proteins is determined."

Nothing meaningful was gained by this approach and the description seemed to detract from the presentation. One doesn't need this result to speculate on the translocation pathway in the Discussion section.

However, there is a great uncertainty about the identity of the phospholipid scramblases involved in such processes. This manuscript focuses on the lipid scrambling activity of ANO6/TMEM16F (hereafter ANO6), which has been proposed to be a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated scramblase. Yet, it has also been suggested that ANO6 is required for lipid scrambling by forming an ion channel but not by performing the scrambling activity itself. This manuscript convincingly shows that ANO6 is a \u2018true\u2019 scramblase and also indicates that the recorded ion channel activity of ANO6 is a consequence (a leak current) of phospholipid scrambling. In an elegant and very detailed manner the authors identify a minimal region in ANO6 required for PS scrambling. This is an excellent study."

The authors find that ANO6 current is non-selective and allows passage of large ions such as NMDG+. The model concludes that ANO6 non-selective ion current coincides with phospholipid scrambling. Annexin-V has been widely used as a probe for exposed PtdSer, but Annexin-V response to PtdSer is not linear and requires a certain threshold of PtdSer to bind. Therefore, this probe is not well adapted for correlative real-time assays such as presented in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>. Notably, Annexin-V signal appears 3 min after the increase in current amplitude. This lag is commented in the text and the hypothesis raised by the authors is reasonable. However, is it possible to do the same experiment using a more robust PtdSer probe such as Lactadherin? Advantages of Lactadherin over Annexin-V have been listed in Shi J et al. 2006, a paper also cited by the authors."

Mutations in SCRD prevented ANO6 from performing PtdSer scrambling. The manuscript presents a homology model of ANO6 based on the X-ray structure of nhTMEM16 to position SCRD. However, to assess the reliability of the model it is important to know the identity percentage between the two sequences and whether or not sequence gaps were introduced for sequence alignment. It is stated in the text that 1-palmitoyl-2-stearoyl-sn-glycero-3-(phospho-L-serine) has been used for docking prediction, but apparently only the polar heads of PtdSer are represented in <a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8</a>.

The question being addressed is whether TMEM16F/ANO6 is a scramblase. This is important, as ANO6 is the \u2018Scott syndrome\u2019 protein whose functional deficiency prevents PS exposure on activated blood platelets resulting in a bleeding disorder. The ensuing studies of ANO6, and chimeric constructs comprising ANO6 sequences inserted into the non-scrambling ANO1, are very informative and this is what the authors should focus on."

Molecular modeling shows that this region falls within a membrane-facing hydrophilic groove defined by a recent crystal structure of a fungal TMEM16 homolog. This groove was suggested to be the lipid transport pathway, and the present data support this suggestion. The idea that ions ride along with phospholipids, or leak through the phospholipid pathway, is plausible but not completely firm. However, it seems to be the best that the authors can do with their experimental system."

ER-plasma membrane junctions are known to be involved in non-vesicular sterol transport from ER to plasma membrane.\u201d"
