To better understand this process, we have performed a structure-function analysis of Dachs, and used this to identify a novel and important mediator of Fat and Dachs activities, a Dachs-binding SH3 protein we have named Dlish. We found that Dlish is regulated by Fat and Dachs, that Dlish also binds Fat and the Dachs regulator Approximated, and that Dlish is required for Dachs localization, levels and activity in both wild type and <i>fat</i> mutant tissue. Our evidence supports dual roles for Dlish. Dlish tethers Dachs to the subapical cell cortex, an effect partly mediated by the palmitoyltransferase Approximated under the control of Fat. Conversely, Dlish promotes the Fat-mediated degradation of Dachs."

To better understand this process, we have performed a structure-function analysis of Dachs, and used this to identify a novel and important mediator of Fat and Dachs activities, a Dachs-binding SH3 protein we have named Dlish. We found that Dlish is regulated by Fat and Dachs, that Dlish also binds Fat and the Dachs regulator Approximated, and that Dlish is required for Dachs localization, levels and activity in both wild type and <i>fat</i> mutant tissue. Our evidence supports dual roles for Dlish. Dlish tethers Dachs to the subapical cell cortex, an effect partly mediated by the palmitoyltransferase Approximated under the control of Fat. Conversely, Dlish promotes the Fat-mediated degradation of Dachs."

Dachs is critical first because it provides the only known marker specifically sensitive to changes in the Fat/Ds branches of both the Hippo and PCP pathways. Dachs is normally concentrated in the subapical cell cortex, overlapping subapically-concentrated Fat and Ds. Loss of Fat greatly increases subapical Dachs levels, and polarization of Fat and Ds to opposite cell faces can in turn polarize Dachs to the face with less Fat (<a href=\"#bib3\">Ambegaonkar AA, 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib11\">Bosveld et al., 2012</a>, <a href=\"#bib12\">2016</a>; <a href=\"#bib14\">Brittle et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib33\">Mao et al., 2006</a>).

Dlish promotes the destabilization of Dachs, either indirectly by tethering it near Fat-bound ubiquitin ligases, or directly by helping Dachs complex with those ligases.

Fbxl7 binds Fat\u2019s ICD, and Fbxl7 localization and function are regulated by Fat; moreover, subapical Dachs increases in Fbxl7 mutants, causing moderate overgrowth (<a href=\"#bib9\">Bosch et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Rodrigues-Campos and Thompson, 2014</a>). Like other F-box proteins (<a href=\"#bib49\">Skaar et al., 2013</a>), Fbxl7 could function in a Skp-Cullin1-F-box (SCF) ubiquitin E3 ligase complex, thereby targeting Dachs for proteasome-mediated degradation or trafficking away from the membrane (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). However, Fbxl7 has not been shown to bind Dachs or change its total levels in cells, and the two studies differ about its ability to stimulate Dachs ubiquitination. Nor does loss of Fbxl7 completely reproduce the strong overgrowth caused by loss of Fat or Dco. Nonetheless, the idea that Fat regulates a complex for the ubiquitination of Dachs is an attractive one (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>), given Fat\u2019s ability to locally reduce the accumulation of Dachs. In fact, loss of Fat greatly increases the total levels of Dachs in imaginal disc cells (Matakatsu et al., Unpublished), a result we will confirm."

Our structure-function analysis of Dachs found regions required for its normal subapical localization, and we used this information as the basis for a screen for novel Dachs binding partners. We found a direct binding partner for the Dachs C-terminus, the previously uncharacterized SH3 domain protein CG10933, which we have renamed <span class=\"underline\">D</span>achs <span class=\"underline\">li</span>gand with <span class=\"underline\">SH</span>3s, or Dlish. We show that the activity and subapical concentration of Dlish are regulated by Fat, Dco and Dachs, and that Dlish in turn is required for the subapical concentration and full activity of Dachs in both wild type and <i>fat</i> mutant cells. Dlish localization also depends on App; furthermore Dlish binds to and is palmitoylated by App, and that palmitoylation can be suppressed by Fat. Loss of Dlish also increases the total levels of Dachs, likely by blocking Fat-mediated destabilization of Dachs. We propose that Dlish targets Dachs to subapical protein complexes in part via Fat-regulated, App-mediated palmitoylation. Dlish thereby concentrates Dachs where it can efficiently inhibit subapical Warts, and conversely links Dachs to the machinery for Fat-dependent destabilization."

D-\u0394N does not, however, retain full Dachs activity, as expressing it\u00a0in wild type flies slightly reduced growth and induced PCP defects, in contrast to the overgrowth caused by overexpressing full-length Dachs (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2C\u2013F</a>). Antiserum specific to the Dachs N-terminus does not bind D-\u0394N and so we used this to examine the effects of D-\u0394N on endogenous Dachs. D-\u0394N expression slightly decreased subapical and increased basolateral, cytoplasmic levels of endogenous Dachs (<a href=\"#fig3s2\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2A</a>).

As summarized in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2J</a>, different domains of Fat\u2019s ICD have different binding and signaling activities, so we next examined Dlish binding to these domains. Fbxl7 and Dco bind to domains C-terminal to the Hippo domain (<a href=\"#bib9\">Bosch et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib21\">Feng and Irvine, 2009</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Rodrigues-Campos and Thompson, 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib50\">Sopko et al., 2009</a>). We have found that Dlish can co-IP with the Fat\u0394ECD\u0394N-6 construct containing this region (<a href=\"#fig5\">Figure 5B</a>). Dlish can also co-IP with Fat\u0394ECD-PH+Hippo, which includes the PH and Hippo domains most active in the regulation of growth and Dachs levels, but which had no previously known binding partners. Dlish does not co-IP with Fat\u0394ECD\u03944-C, which includes the PH but not the Hippo domains and which cannot regulate growth. We did not observe co-IP with the smaller Fat\u0394ECD-Hippo construct that lacks the PH domain. Although in vivo the PH region is not required for activity of the adjacent Hippo domains (e.g. <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1</a>; <a href=\"#bib7\">Matakatsu and Blair 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib40\">Pan et al. 2013</a>), it does strengthen that activity (<a href=\"#bib7\">Matakatsu and Blair 2012</a>), and in the different environment found in S2 cells may be more critical for proper folding or the formation of protein complexes."

Alternatively, Dlish could be directly mediating the regulation of Warts by Dachs, independent of its effects on Dachs localization. We favor the first alternative, as we have not found binding between Dlish and Warts or other Warts-binding proteins (see above). In addition, we found that tethering Dachs to the cell cortex by adding a CAAX prenylation site at its C-terminus can override the requirement for Dlish. Both <i>UAS-dachs</i> and <i>UAS-dachs-CAAX</i> induced similar overgrowth when expressed in the posterior of the wing with <i>hh-gal4</i> (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A,B</a>). In a <i>dlish<sup>4506</sup></i> homozygous background, however, the overgrowth induced by Dachs overexpression was greatly reduced, while the overgrowth induced by Dachs-CAAX was undiminished; there was a similar difference in their effects on the Hippo pathway marker <i>ban3-GFP</i> (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C,D,G,H</a>). These different activities correlated with different protein localizations. In <i>dlish<sup>4506</sup></i> wing discs, overexpressed Dachs-CAAX was largely cortical (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9F</a>), while overexpressed Dachs was largely cytoplasmic (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9E</a>), contrasting with its cortical localization in wild type discs (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3H</a>)."

To explain this, we hypothesize that as Dlish targets or stabilizes Dachs in the subapical cell cortex, it places Dachs in or near complexes where it can also be destabilized by Fat (<a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>). When Fat is lost destabilization no longer occurs, so the total and subapical levels of Dachs increase. When <i>dlish</i> is reduced, the Fat-dependent destabilization of Dachs cannot occur but subapical targeting is also lost, and so Dachs accumulates in the cytoplasm."

In trials using the hypomorphic <i>dlish<sup>04\u00a0</sup></i>background, simultaneous loss of <i>fat</i> caused no or only a weak additional increase in total Dachs levels compared those caused by <i>dlish<sup>04</sup></i> alone; the Dachs increase in <i>dlish<sup>04</sup> fat<sup>fd</sup></i> double homozygotes was similar to that seen in <i>fat<sup>fd</sup></i> mutants, and significantly weaker than the increase expected if the <i>fat</i> and <i>dlish</i> effects were additive (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10A</a>).

Loss of Fbxl7 increases the levels of subapical Dachs in imaginal discs (<a href=\"#bib9\">Bosch et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"#bib45\">Rodrigues-Campos and Thompson, 2014</a>), and we found a similar effect on subapical Dlish (<a href=\"#fig10\">Figure 10C</a>).

This raised the possibility that App acted through Dlish and thus the Dlish-Dachs complex. In support of this hypothesis, we found that clonal loss of <i>app</i> in <i>fat</i> mutant wing discs decreased subapical and increased cytoplasmic Dlish; loss of <i>app</i> in wild type discs also increased cytoplasmic Dlish (<a href=\"#fig11\">Figure 11C\u2013E</a>).

Dachs is not detectably palmitoylated in vitro or in vivo (<a href=\"#bib35\">Matakatsu and Blair, 2008</a>; Matakatsu, Blair and Fehon, Unpublished). We therefore directly examined the palmitoylation of Dlish using the Acyl Biotinyl Exchange (ABE) method, which uses N-ethylmaleimide to block free cysteines, hydroxylamine (HAM) to break palmitoyl-thioester bonds, and sulfhydryl-reactive biotin to label those bonds (<a href=\"#bib19\">Drisdel et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"#bib20\">Drisdel and Green, 2004</a>). We detected HAM-dependent biotinylation of Dlish in S2 cells and, as a positive control, App itself (Matakatsu, Blair and Fehon, Unpublished), but not of the negative control GFP (<a href=\"#fig12\">Figure 12A</a>).

This suggests that the Dachs-Dlish branch of the Fat-Ds pathway, with its powerful effect on Warts activity, is also lacking. Nonetheless, it has been suggested that Drosophila Fat and Ds can affect Hippo pathway activity in a Dachs-independent manner (<a href=\"#bib18\">Degoutin et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"#bib23\">Gaspar et al., 2015</a>). It is also clear that Drosophila Fat has Dachs-independent effects on PCP; indeed the N-terminal \u2018PCP\u2019 domain of the Fat ICD that did not affect Dachs in this study is sufficient to improve the PCP defects of <i>fat</i> mutants (<a href=\"#bib36\">Matakatsu and Blair, 2012</a>). These or alternative pathways may still be present in mammals."

Adding to the confusion, the C-terminus (as tested by \u2206N-6) is independently able to interact with Dlish/App. I cannot see how these experiments help the story; I assume that the idea was to link the \"Hippo\" domain of Fat to Dlish/App and to link back to the regulation of Dachs as shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>; but based on the results shown I cannot agree with this logic.

However, an experiment could be designed to test if the effect on Yki target genes (such as bantam reporter as shown in <a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6</a>) of Dlish knockdown/<i>dlish<sup>04</sup></i> clones can be repressed/rescued by expression of Dachs-CAAX (e.g. using MARCM). This would argue that the main role of Dlish is indeed to tether Dachs at the membrane. It seems that the authors are trying to implicate something similar in the text (at the end of the subsection \u201c<i>dlish</i> is required for normal Dachs localization and fat mutant overgrowth\u201d), however I don't think this conclusion can be easily drawn from overexpression data (levels of dachs-CAAX overexpression would need to be controlled; maybe Dachs-CAAX is less efficient in regulating growth, but the difference in signaling strength is compensated for by increased levels (panel N indicates increased Dachs-CAAX overexpression compared to M)."

It is my understanding that S2 cells don't express Fat, which explains why the fat RNAi treatment doesn't have any effect on Dachs, but makes me wonder why this experiment was performed in the first place. Fat\u2206ECD in S2 cells localizes abnormally, which might explain the opposite effect on Dachs levels than in vivo.

Our co-IP between Dlish, Approximated and the Fat ICD suggested such a connection, and we now have new data that greatly strengthens this. As we showed previously, adding Approximated to our in vitro palmitoylation assay increased the palmitoylation of Dachs. We now show that this App-stimulated palmitoylation is reliably decreased by the addition of Fat\u25b3ECD (6 of 6 trials). This supports our model that the Fat ICD inhibits the activity of Approximated, decreasing the palmitoylation of Dlish and therefore the tethering of the Dlish-Dachs complex to the cell membrane. This new data is included at the end of the Results, as part of a new figure that combines the new and old palmitoylation data. This also provides a strong rationale for retaining the co-IP data upon which the model is based."

As the reviewers pointed out, we have not worked out the basis for our in vitro ubiquitination result, and moreover Dlish could be a target of Fbxl7 and Slimb. The mutual co-dependence of subapical Dlish and Dachs makes this difficult to determine with any in vivo genetic test, as the absence of one will prevent subapical localization of the other, leaving none for subapical Fbxl7 or Slimb to work on. Our first in vitro tests of Dlish ubiquitination have been slowed by difficulties getting a strong enough Dlish signal, and this has prevented us from completing them in the time frame of the revision. We have nonetheless retained some speculation about ubiquitination in the Discussion."

Adding to the confusion, the C-terminus (as tested by \u2206N-6) is independently able to interact with Dlish/App. I cannot see how these experiments help the story; I assume that the idea was to link the \"Hippo\" domain of Fat to Dlish/App and to link back to the regulation of Dachs as shown in <a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2</a>; but based on the results shown I cannot agree with this logic.

That Dlish can complex with this region is therefore not so surprising. What is important is that App and Dlish can co-IP with the PHHippo domains. This is the first report of any protein complexing with this critical region, and in our studies co-IP this to this region has been rare. We feel strongly that this needs to be reported."

However, as the manuscript was out for review we obtained a new CRISPR allele of <i>dlish</i> that gives phenotypes very similar to <i>dlish<sup>04</sup></i> (now shown in the revised manuscript).
