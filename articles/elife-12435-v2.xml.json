Ras signaling is mediated by a system of interacting molecules: upstream enzymes (GEF/GAP) regulate Ras\u2019s ability to recruit multiple competing downstream effectors. We developed a multiplexed, multi-turnover assay for measuring the dynamic signaling behavior of in vitro reconstituted H-Ras signaling systems. By including both upstream regulators and downstream effectors, we can systematically map how different network configurations shape the dynamic system response. The concentration and identity of both upstream and downstream signaling components strongly impacted the timing, duration, shape, and amplitude of effector outputs. The distorted output of oncogenic alleles of Ras was highly dependent on the balance of positive (GAP) and negative (GEF) regulators in the system. We found that different effectors interpreted the same inputs with distinct output dynamics, enabling a Ras system to encode multiple unique temporal outputs in response to a single input. We also found that different Ras-to-GEF positive feedback mechanisms could reshape output dynamics in distinct ways, such as signal amplification or overshoot minimization. Mapping of the space of output behaviors accessible to Ras provides a design manual for programming Ras circuits, and reveals how these systems are readily adapted to produce an array of dynamic signaling behaviors. Nonetheless, this versatility comes with a trade-off of fragility, as there exist numerous paths to altered signaling behaviors that could cause disease."

Ras signaling is mediated by a system of interacting molecules: upstream enzymes (GEF/GAP) regulate Ras\u2019s ability to recruit multiple competing downstream effectors. We developed a multiplexed, multi-turnover assay for measuring the dynamic signaling behavior of in vitro reconstituted H-Ras signaling systems. By including both upstream regulators and downstream effectors, we can systematically map how different network configurations shape the dynamic system response. The concentration and identity of both upstream and downstream signaling components strongly impacted the timing, duration, shape, and amplitude of effector outputs. The distorted output of oncogenic alleles of Ras was highly dependent on the balance of positive (GAP) and negative (GEF) regulators in the system. We found that different effectors interpreted the same inputs with distinct output dynamics, enabling a Ras system to encode multiple unique temporal outputs in response to a single input. We also found that different Ras-to-GEF positive feedback mechanisms could reshape output dynamics in distinct ways, such as signal amplification or overshoot minimization. Mapping of the space of output behaviors accessible to Ras provides a design manual for programming Ras circuits, and reveals how these systems are readily adapted to produce an array of dynamic signaling behaviors. Nonetheless, this versatility comes with a trade-off of fragility, as there exist numerous paths to altered signaling behaviors that could cause disease."

These studies have provided many of the most fundamental insights into the mechanisms of Ras activation and inactivation as well as clarified our understanding of the nature of oncogenic mutations. To study the regulators, however, these reconstitutions are almost always performed under conditions in which Ras cannot productively cycle: GEF assays monitor a single exchange of fluorescent nucleotide for non-fluorescent nucleotide; GAP assays monitor a single turnover of GTP without the possibility of the nucleotide reloading (<a href=\"#bib14\">Eberth and Ahmadian, 2001</a>). Likewise, studies of effector interactions with activated GTPase are typically done under non-cycling conditions using non-hydrolyzable nucleotide analogs to measure equilibrium binding constants (<a href=\"#bib20\">Geyer, 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib25\">Herrmann et al., 1996</a>; <a href=\"#bib58\">Sydor et al., 1998</a>).

Understanding how these systems-level parameters shape behavior is critical, given that different cell types can harbor different configurations of network components (both in identity and expression levels) and also because distinct receptors may differentially activate key network components. In addition, the fact that many diseases are associated with perturbations to Ras and its associated regulators suggests that a systems level reconstitution of Ras signaling systems could be highly informative as to types of outputs and behaviors that these systems are capable of, as well as how these systems respond to perturbations such as mutation."

We reasoned that a microsphere surface charged with Ras could serve as a platform for the assembly and disassembly of fluorescent effector molecules from solution in response to inputs, much like the native Ras system (bound to the plasma membrane) functions in cells (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2A</a>). Signaling networks of defined composition could then be prepared from recombinant proteins and robust measurements of the dynamic output behavior could be determined by tracking the amount of effector on the surface over time for many individual beads and averaging their responses. Although such a system would not fully capture all biophysical features of cellular Ras signaling, such as GTPase diffusion in a fluid plasma membrane, partitioning between membrane microdomains, or GTPase exchange from the membrane, it serves as an excellent starting point to understand how these systems behave with fixed Ras molecules in a highly controlled setting (<a href=\"#bib59\">Tian et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib53\">Silvius et al., 2006</a>).

For our initial studies, we chose to use the catalytic domain from the RasGRF GEF, which is constitutively active and, unlike other GEFs, contains no allosteric feedback sites (<a href=\"#bib18\">Freedman, 2006</a>). Ni-NTA microspheres were charged with a 16x-histidine tagged H-Ras\u2022GDP (OFF state) that could not dissociate from the bead and incubated in the presence of 50 nM (~<i>K<sub>D</sub></i>) of a model effector: a fluorescently tagged Ras-binding domain (RBD) from the C-Raf kinase (<a href=\"#bib2\">Block et al., 1996</a>). Under these basal conditions, the amount of fluorescence on the bead was comparable to the background levels of fluorescence from the effector in solution. We then added as input 2 \u03bcM of the catalytic domain of the RasGRF GEF and 5 mM of either GDP or GTP and monitored the output of effector fluorescence on the bead (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2B</a>). This amount of nucleotide in solution is in vast excess of the small amount of bead-bound Ras present in the reactions, providing essentially an infinite supply of nucleotide for these reactions on the timescale we examine (detailed in 'Materials and methods'). Upon GEF and nucleotide addition, there was noticeable accumulation of fluorescent effector on the bead surface of the GTP containing reactions within seconds, and considerable fluorescent signal was observed by 10\u00a0min. In contrast, no fluorescent effector accumulated on the surface of reactions containing GDP, indicating that GEF-catalyzed translocation of the effector was dependent on Ras becoming GTP loaded. Having seen GTP-dependent GEF-catalyzed translocation of an effector to a Ras-charged bead surface, we were now in position to prepare signaling networks of arbitrary configuration and assay their output dynamics in multiplex using our microscopy-based assay (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2C</a>)."

When identically loaded beads were stimulated with increasing amounts of RasGRF, we observed both faster rates of effector translocation and higher steady state amplitudes of effector output (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2D</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013B</a>). Initial rates of effector translocation appeared to show a hyperbolic response to increasing GEF, while steady states effector levels showed a linear response. Together, these data demonstrate that our reconstituted Ras signal processing system produced outputs that responded quantitatively to the amount of GEF present in the system."

To test the reversibility and turn-off of our system, we prepared beads loaded with H-Ras\u2022GTP (ON state), incubated them with a saturating excess amount of C-Raf RBD effector (2.5 \u03bcM total, 50 nM fluorescently labeled), and monitored the loss of effector signal from the bead over time (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>). In the absence of any GAP, effector fluorescence decayed with a rate constant of 0.01\u2009min<sup>-1</sup>, which is similar to the expected rate of intrinsic hydrolysis by H-Ras under our assay conditions (<a href=\"#bib45\">Neal et al., 1988</a>; <a href=\"#bib22\">Gibbs et al., 1984</a>). This result is consistent with previous observations that intrinsic hydrolysis by the GTPase continues to occur even in the presence of saturating amounts of effector (<a href=\"#bib24\">Herrmann et al., 1995</a>). When increasing amounts of the catalytic domain from purified Neurofibromin-1 GAP (NF1-GAP [<a href=\"#bib51\">Scheffzek et al., 1998</a>; <a href=\"#bib67\">Xu et al., 1990</a>]) were included in the reactions, effector signal disappeared from the bead at an increased rate in a dose-dependent manner with a hyperbolic dependence on the GAP concentration (<a href=\"#fig2\">Figure 2E</a>, <a href=\"#fig2s1\">Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1C</a>). Thus, as with the turn-on of the system, these data indicate that our reconstituted Ras signal processing system displays turn-off that responds quantitatively to the amount of GAP present in the system."

As before, addition of GEF stimulated assembly of effector on the bead as the levels of Ras\u2022GTP increased. When NF1-GAP was added to the reactions, the system responded with a rapid decrease in effector levels before stabilizing at a non-zero plateau corresponding to the non-equilibrium steady state maintained by the balance of effector, GEF and GAP activities present in the reaction."

Similar results were also observed for G12C and Q61L alleles (<a href=\"#fig3s1\">Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). To determine which particular configurations are most distorted by the G12V allele, we measured the effector output response across four different input strengths ([GEF] activity) and four different NF1-GAP levels. We then calculated a distortion score as the fold-change integrated output from Ras-G12V relative to wild-type Ras and interpolated the responses from these 16 configurations to produce a phase diagram of signal distortion by G12V under different network conditions (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3D</a>). This revealed that G12V alleles were most perturbative with low-GEF inputs and a high-GAP network context, conditions in which the GAP activity would, for wild-type Ras, completely dominate over the small amount of activating GEF input. These observations are consistent with models of oncogenic Ras signaling in which low-level inputs or noise from the environment that would normally be filtered out by basal GAP-activity are misinterpreted by the cell as <i>bona fide</i> activating signals."

We considered two distinct GAPs domains with different biochemical properties and expression patterns: the NF1-GAP and the p120-GAP. NF1-GAP, which is expressed somewhat ubiquitously but highest in neuronal cells and leukocytes, has a tight <i>K<sub>M</sub></i> for Ras (0.3 \u03bcM) and modest <i>k<sub>cat</sub></i> (1.4\u00a0s<sup>-1</sup>) (<a href=\"#bib64\">Wiesm\u00fcller and Wittinghofer, 1992</a>). In contrast, p120GAP has a higher <i>K<sub>M</sub></i> (9.7 \u03bcM) for Ras, but also a higher <i>k<sub>cat</sub></i> (19\u2009s<sup>-1</sup>), and shows a much more ubiquitous expression profile (<a href=\"#bib64\">Wiesm\u00fcller and Wittinghofer, 1992</a>)."

First, increasing levels of NF1-GAP resulted in substantially lower end point steady state levels of bound effector. Moreover, the amount of NF1-GAP changed the <i>dynamics of approach</i> to steady state significantly: while GAP-free networks approached steady state from below, networks containing NF1-GAP showed transient overshoot that decayed back down to the steady state from above, creating an initial pulse of strong output followed by weaker levels of output in the long term. The pulse-width and peak-time of effector outputs were inversely correlated with the concentration of the NF1-GAP (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4B</a>). Thus, NF1-GAP shapes not only the final steady-state levels of output in the system, but also the shape, timing and duration of Ras signal processing."

This is analogous to the way in which enzyme intermediates can transiently accumulate in the pre-steady state depending on the rate-constants for the microscopic steps, for example if product release is rate-limiting (<a href=\"#bib16\">Fersht, 1999</a>). Our observation of these phenomena in Ras circuits is only possible because our system uses bona\u00a0fide GTP that allows for Ras cycling to actively occur. Consistent with this, the G12V, G12C, and Q61L mutants we analyzed previously \u2013 which cannot efficiently cycle \u2013 did not show such overshoot behavior even under the highest GAP conditions examined."

Compared to the NF1-GAP, the impact of the p120GAP on the end-point effector output of the system was much less substantial (<a href=\"#fig4\">Figure 4C</a>). This may in part be owing to the much higher <i>K<sub>M</sub></i> of p120GAP compared to NF1-GAP, leading to much lower effective GAP activity in the concentration regimes we could readily explore. Nonetheless, increasing amounts of p120GAP levels did lead to a marked change in the output dynamics of Ras signal processing in a manner similar to that of NF1-GAP and is consistent with the consequences of altering the <i>K<sub>M</sub></i> and <i>k<sub>cat</sub></i> of the GAP in our kinetic model (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3</a>). As with NF1-GAP, transient behaviors emerged when p120GAP was present, and the pulse-width and peak-time of effector outputs were inversely correlated with the concentration of p120GAP. Thus, like NF1-GAP, p120GAP shapes the dynamics and steady-state behavior of signal processing by Ras, but with a different dose-dependent behavior owing to its unique biochemical characteristics."

At 250 nM effector concentration, output increased to a level <i>20 times</i> that of the 50 nM effector system (measured at 120\u2009min) at that time, before decaying down to its final steady state level. At even higher effector concentrations (500 nM, 1000 nM), system output peaked quickly within 20 min and then decayed monotonically over several hours to the final steady state level. These data demonstrate that higher effector concentrations not only increase output amplitudes but also enable the output to capture more transient features of the upstream Ras\u2022GTP signal. This idea is supported by our kinetic model (<a href=\"#fig5s3\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3</a>) and makes sense intuitively because higher effector concentrations decrease the time needed to equilibrate against a fixed concentration of Ras\u2022GTP; if this process is too slow, transient aspects of the GTPase activation/deactivation dynamics that occur on a faster timescale will be missed in the effector output. This implies that effectors are not merely passive conduits for transmitting upstream Ras dynamics, but instead play an active role in interpreting and perceiving what features of those dynamics to pass downstream during signaling. A corollary of this observation is that erroneous overexpression of effector molecules not only can\u00a0lead to higher amplitude outputs, but also can\u00a0drastically alter the overall dynamics of the system behavior as well."

First, as we previously saw with one-effector systems, the time it takes for a binding process to equilibrate impacts the extent to which it can track the transient dynamics of its target. Distinct effector molecules have different binding affinities that are determined by different on and off rates from the target, and thus will interpret Ras dynamics differently. Second, these effector molecules are in competition with one another for access to the supply of time-varying activated Ras. Because we are observing the nonequilibrium binding dynamics of effectors to Ras, an effector may be competitive in the short-term (kinetically\u00a0determined phase) but less so in the long-term (equilibrium-determined phase) (<a href=\"#bib41\">Motulsky and Mahan, 1984</a>).

In GAP-free networks, the step-responses for A-Raf and C-Raf differed most significantly in terms of their amplitudes, with A-Raf output 20 times lower than C-Raf output (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>). The normalized traces of each effector output show only minor differences in the dynamics of these outputs. In high NF1-GAP networks, we could only detect an output response from the C-Raf effector; the ability of A-Raf to assemble on the bead was either filtered out by the low affinity combined with high levels of GAP activity, or was simply too weak to detect above the background A-Raf in solution (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6D</a>)."

Given that A-Raf, B-Raf, and C-Raf have different affinities for the GTPase, we wondered whether mutations in C-Raf that changed its affinity would be sufficient to drive new dynamic behaviors. To this end, we characterized the step-response of two-effector network containing equivalent amounts (50 nM) of the C-Raf RBD and the C-Raf<sup>N64A</sup> point mutant that has decreased affinity for Ras\u2022GTP (<a href=\"#bib2\">Block et al., 1996</a>). Different dynamic output behaviors for each effector were observed for both GAP-free (<a href=\"#fig6s1\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1</a>) and high NF1-gap (<a href=\"#fig6\">Figure 6G</a>) networks. In both contexts, the lower affinity C-Raf N64A mutant peaked earlier and had lower overall amplitude than the wild-type C-Raf RBD, and like before, high GAP-networks accentuated these temporal differences. Consistent with this, we found that parameter changes as small as 2-fold could produce subtle shifts in the timing of effector reponses of our kinetic model (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>).

Consequently, a single-step input can be in principle be used encode multiple classes of temporally distinct outputs that peak and decline out of phase with one another, allowing for a sequence of different activities to be organized during signal processing. For example, we were able to produce a three-wave activation response of three distinct effectors in our kinetic model by simply modifying concentrations and off-rates (<a href=\"#fig6s2\">Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Furthermore, the context of other regulators (e.g. extent of GAP activity in the network) can influence how these different dynamic responses unfold, magnifying temporal distinctions in some cases while restricting the ability of certain effectors to assemble productively at all in other cases. Finally, because even simple point mutations to an effector can dramatically alter its output dynamics, new dynamic patterns are not difficult to produce and can be easily accessed during evolution."

Similar positive feedback GEF recruitment could occur in Ras signaling networks. To explore the effects of recruitment-based positive feedback, we made a synthetic GEF in which we fused the C-Raf RBD effector domain to the RasGRF GEF to produce 'RasGRF-RBD'. In this case, the catalytic activity of RasGRF-RBD is always constitutive, but activated Ras will assemble the synthetic GEF on the bead surface to provide a higher effective concentration of GEF and potentially increase the apparent GEF activity (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7A</a>). Thus, this feedback mechanism takes an ON GEF molecule and makes it MORE ON as Ras\u2022GTP levels increase. We experimentally measured output responses for this feedback-containing system in 96 system configurations corresponding to four different input strengths, four different GAP concentrations, and six different Ras densities (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7B</a>)."

In contrast, the behaviors of the wild\u00a0type and feedback systems were most similar under high GEF, low GAP network configurations. In this regime, the GEF activity from the catalytic domain is sufficient to provide strong activation, and any additional boost in activity for localizing the GEF provides only marginal gains (<a href=\"#fig7\">Figure 7D</a>).

Unlike with recruitment-based feedback, allosteric-feedback did not provide large gains in output amplitudes in any of the regimes we looked like. However, we did observe that transient overshoot behavior was almost completely absent in the output responses of the SOScat system, even in the highest p120GAP condition we inspected. Indeed, the output dynamics from allosteric-feedback networks appeared much more stable and monotonic than those from RasGRF networks that contained no feedback. These effects were most dramatic in high GAP network contexts in which RasGRF produced a large transient overshoot phase, whereas SOScat produced a monotonic approach to the steady state (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>). However, this increased stability was still noticeable even for low GAP high GEF networks in which RasGRF produces a sustained response (<a href=\"#fig8\">Figure 8C</a>)."

Thus, this type of feedback mechanism appears to play less of a role in amplifying weak signals and more of a role in dampening dynamic and transient features that would arise naturally in the step-response without this feedback. For SOScat, which mediates Ras activation in response to growth signals, this overshoot minimization might be a desirable feature that reduces the risk of inappropriate proliferation. This use of biochemical feedback is somewhat analogous to the use of feedback control used in some <i>electronic</i> systems to avoid overshoot of the steady-state in response to step-inputs."

This regulation can be <i>direct</i> by acting at the level of gene expression. For example, a simple survey of published p120GAP, Ras, and c-Raf mRNA expression levels across a variety of tissue types reveals a staggering amount of diversity in what types of network configurations are present in different cell types and tissues (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9A</a>, <a href=\"#tbl1\">Table 1</a>). The true diversity in these configurations is likely even greater given the plethora of additional GEFs, GAPs, Ras variants and effectors that cells can deploy. Regulating the concentration of these activities can also be achieved <i>indirectly</i> by the differential recruitment of these molecules by the receptors that initiate Ras signaling, which changes their <i>effective concentration</i> at the plasma membrane. Indeed, many of the catalytic domains that we looked at in this study show regulated interaction dynamics with the plasma membrane in response to extracellular signals (<a href=\"#bib23\">Gureasko et al., 2010</a>).\u00a0Thus, different cells can position their signaling systems at different points in the space of available Ras network configurations and modulate these configurations in response to extracellular cues to provide versatile top-level control of the amplitude and duration of proximal signal processing events (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9B</a>)."

In particular, we observed many different paths in network-space from one signaling processing behavior to another with much higher or sustained amplitude (<a href=\"#fig9\">Figure 9C</a>). These paths include classic oncogenic substitutions like G12V in Ras, but can also be realized by increased GEF activity, decreased GAP activity, or inclusion of high-affinity effectors that increase, extend and sustain signaling responses. While some of these perturbations have not been definitively recognized as drivers of cancer, many are associated with other RASopathies in humans, like Noonan syndrome or type 1 Neurofibromatosis (<a href=\"#bib52\">Schubbert et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"#bib5\">Bollag et al., 1996</a>).

This was most obvious from comparing the effect of Ras G12V perturbation on GAP-free and high-GAP networks (see <a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>) but is also readily apparent from inspection of the structure of our experimental maps between network configuration and signaling outputs (see <a href=\"#fig5s2\">Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2</a>). Even networks configurations that produced highly similar output behaviors could nonetheless respond divergently to perturbations. These are network configurations along a contour in the phase diagrams and represent neutral paths along which a cell or species can move without immediate consequence to the system. For example, a low signaling output that is maintained by a weak GEF activity alone might also be produced by a higher GEF activity balanced by a high GAP activity. However, these two configurations would respond very differently to substitution with oncogenic alleles of Ras like G12V. This observation demonstrates the limited predictive power of static steady-state measurements of cellular states and highlights the need to obtain <i>dynamic</i> data about the pre-steady state and impulse-response behavior of cellular systems using fine-grained time courses or new methods such as optogenetic pathway activation (<a href=\"#bib60\">Toettcher et al., 2013</a>)."

Thus, access to certain regions of this space is not feasible without first acquiring permissive modifications to the feedback architecture of the system. Acquisition of this permissive architecture though, can occur in regions in which there is minimal consequence to the system output. Once this feedback mechanism is present, the space of behaviors available to the system changes and previously non-functional regions of the space can now be accessed."

This is, in fact, a critical aspect of how these particular signaling systems work as activated Ras itself has no <i>enzymatic</i> activity toward other molecules, but instead serves only as a platform for the recruitment of many possible competing effector molecules within the cell. Moreover, activated Ras cannot engage more than one effector simultaneously and thus competition between effectors as well as upstream regulators like GAPs contributes to the system\u2019s output dynamics."

This is because higher effector concentrations equilibrate against their target faster than lower effector concentrations, resulting in different abilities to capture transient features of the target dynamics. Effector concentration is thus more than a passive 'volume' knob that reports on Ras\u2022GTP levels and instead is an active system component that interprets Ras activity to sculpt effector-specific output dynamics owing to its own assembly and disassembly kinetics."

These systems showed a variety of interesting multi-effector programs, such as one effector exhibiting a transient response while another was sustained, one effector responding while another did not at all, or two transient responses that peaked and declined with different timing and duration. Moreover, we found that different dynamic behaviors could readily be produced by introducing point mutations in an effector that altered affinity for activated Ras. These observations stress the important roles that both kinetic and thermodynamic aspects of effector assembly and competition play in shaping how an individual effector interprets dynamic Ras\u2022GTP levels in the context of the rest of the network."

This can allow some effector outputs to be restricted to early phases of signaling, only to decline and be displaced by other more dominant effectors at later stages. These observations extend recent observations of hierarchies of binding by different effectors to Ras under equilibrium conditions with non-hydrolyzable analogs (<a href=\"#bib55\">Smith and Ikura, 2014</a>). Thus, the differential perception of Ras\u2022GTP signals by distinct effectors may not be a flaw in the method by which cells make measurements, but a useful feature by which cells can use a single upstream signaling molecule like Ras to dictate a complex temporal program of multiple downstream outputs."

For example, binding of Raf kinases we used in this study to Ras primarily serves to deliver the kinase to the plasma membrane where its interaction with lipids (<a href=\"#bib21\">Ghosh and Bell, 1997</a>), other Raf kinases (<a href=\"#bib19\">Freeman et al., 2013</a>), scaffolds (<a href=\"#bib10\">Brennan et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"#bib48\">Ritt et al., 2006</a>) and other macromolecules alters its kinase activity and thus how it sends out signals downstream (REF). In fact, Raf can even activate downstream signaling in the absence of Ras by artificial membrane recruitment (<a href=\"#bib57\">Stokoe et al., 1994</a>; <a href=\"#bib35\">Leevers et al., 1994</a>). However, this only further emphasizes the importance of effector binding <i>dynamics</i> in the context of cellular signal processing, as binding to Ras is a physiological prerequisite for these other mechanisms to take place. Moreover, different Ras effectors such as PI3 Kinase or Ral-GDS will have their own molecule-specific layers of regulation that take place upon interaction with Ras at the plasma membrane. These processes will be influenced by the underlying effector-binding dynamics in different ways depending on the kinetics of these downstream steps. Our work demonstrates that cells have simple systems for modulating and controlling these fundamental binding dynamics and further indicates that known control mechanisms should be analyzed in this complex dynamic context."

Indeed, our present study has only investigated effector interaction with H-Ras, but there exist many additional Ras isoforms such as K-Ras and N-Ras, K4A-Ras, and K4B-Ras that may engage these effectors in different ways to produce different dynamics. Additionally, there exist related GTPases such as Rap which can serve as platform for Ras effectors but that do not necessarily promote signal propagation (<a href=\"#bib66\">Wynne et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"#bib13\">Cook et al., 1993</a>). Understanding how the underlying distribution of GTPase isoforms dictates signal processing behavior is another critical component of cellular signaling and we hope to extend our in vitro system to explore these fundamental questions in the future."

This difference in the <i>lifetime</i> of a Ras\u2022GTP molecule compared to RasG12V\u2022GTP could potentially serve as an additional <i>dynamic</i> selectivity handle for small molecules in which we want to only target the oncogenic form of Ras.

Some aspects of the H-Ras system may be shared with these systems, while other aspects may be different owing to idiosyncratic features of a particular system of molecules. These systems could also be extended in other ways as well to explore how other biophysical constraints impact these signaling processes. Our reconstitutions could, for example, be extended to lipid-coated beads to explore how membrane fluidity or lipid identity shape effector outputs. Multi-currency networks that include multiple Ras isoforms or contain more than one type of GTPase could also be examined to look at higher-order networks and cascades. Only by building these systems, turning them on and watching them run can we begin to understand how they actually perform and operate in different signaling regimes."

To load the\u00a0beads, 7.5 \u03bcL of this bead slurry was mixed with 7.5 \u03bcL of GTPase in a PCR tube and incubated on ice for 1\u2009hr with occasional flicking. The amount of GTPase used to load the beads depending on the desired density for the specific experiments being performed downstream, but a typical bead-loading used 7.5 \u03bcL of 30 \u03bcM GTPase and typically resulted in Ras densities crudely estimated at 2500 molecules \u00d7 \u03bcm<sup>-2</sup> (see calculation below). Following incubation, the beads were spun in a table-top minifuge, the supernatant removed, and washed thrice with GAB. The washed beads were resuspended in ~100 \u03bcL GAB, transferred to an Eppendorf tube, shielded from light, and stored on ice. The exact amount of final GAB the beads were in was adjusted for any particular experiment such that 2 \u03bcL of bead slurry contained roughly 25\u2013100 total beads when placed in a 384-well microscopy plate."

First, a 'bead-mix' was prepared that contained fluorescent effector at the desired concentration (typically 50 nM) and beads in GAB. It should be noted that the inclusion of 20 mM Imidazole was critical for eliminating non-specific background effector staining on the bead surface and improved reproducibility dramatically. A\u00a020 \u03bcL volume\u00a0of this bead mix was dispensed into the wells of a 384-well Costar microscopy plate. Second, an 'initiation-mix' was prepared that contained fluorescent effector at the desired concentration, 5 mM GTP (or other nucleotide if used) and GEFs and GAPs at the desired concentration, all in GAB. 10 \u03bcl of this reaction mix was gently added to the 20 \u03bcL bead mix in the 384-well plate to initiate reaction. The large volume of the initiation mix was critical for getting sufficient mixing without the need to pipette up and down and disrupt the beads and improved reproducibility. Once signal processing reactions were initiated, they wells were sealed with PCR plate sealant to prevent evaporation."

These investigators develop an exceedingly simple yet powerful system: measure the recruitment in vitro to Ras-coated microbeads of fluorescently tagged Ras binding domains (RBDs) of various effectors to quantify the amplitude and kinetics of Ras signaling. By manipulating the density, mutational or GTP-binding state of the bound Ras along with the concentrations of single or multiple GEFs, GAPs and effectors, the investigators are able to observe a wide variety of signal outputs. Among the most compelling results is the dependence on GAP concentrations of the difference in signal output between wt and activated Ras (<a href=\"#fig3\">Figure 3</a>). This type of in vitro systems approach to Ras signaling provides much fodder for discussion and future investigation and contributes to our understanding of how a single pathway with a small number of nodes can generate a wide-variety of outputs. In addition, the manuscript is clearly written and the graphically didactic and uniform figures help make an inherently dense set of data digestible. Accordingly, the manuscript is suitable for publication in <i>eLife</i>. However, it is recommended that several issues be addressed."

Ras proteins are peripheral membrane proteins that, although they appear to stably associate with membranes at steady state, are, in fact, in a dynamic equilibrium both in terms of association with the membrane per se (see PMID 16236799) and within membrane microdomains (see PMID: 17618274). The behavior of the stationary Ras proteins affixed to the inert microbeads is likely quite different from their membrane-asociated counterparts in an in vivo system. The lack of membrane also confounds other aspects of interpreting the results. For example, in their analysis the authors equate recruitment of the RBD of an effector to the microbead as a readout of signaling. But this is simplistic. Raf-1 is a kinase that is the first node in a cascade of kinases. The sine qua non of Raf-1 signaling involves stimulation of the kinase activity of Raf-1. Yet the interaction of Raf-1 with GTP-loaded Ras does not stimulate kinase activity in the absence of a cellular membrane (PMID: 8622647, 7811320). Indeed, the membrane acts upon the Raf-1 kinase in a manner that involves the cysteine-rich domain and initiates a poorly understood activation sequence, which may include dimerization. Importantly, Raf-1 sent to the membrane via a CAAX sequence does not require GTP\u2022Ras at all for full activation (PMID: 8196769, 7811320) demonstrating that it is membrane not Ras that activates the kinase. Likewise GEFs for Ras and other small GTPases require biological membranes for activation. Indeed, the way GEFs like SOS and RasGRPs are regulated is by modulation of their affinity for membranes utilizing domains like SH2 (on Grb2), PH and C1 for membrane binding. Although the catalytic domain of SOS will have exchange activity toward Ras in solution, in vivo the histone, PH and DH domains are required for productive associate with membranes (PMID: 20133692)."

An important result from this modeling was the observation that the simplest model (as was suggested by the reviewers above) was unable to produce the types of transient overshoot behaviors that we observed in our data. Indeed, the fact that we could not produce overshoot from the simplest model is consistent with theoretical work on n-state Markov systems, which argue that this type of behavior is only possible for systems with at least three states. We found that overshoot could be introduced in the system by either (i) including competition between GAP and effector for the GTPase and/or (ii) including a post-hydrolysis intermediate GTPase state that is refractory to nucleotide reloading. While (i) could formally produce overshoot behavior, it could only do so in non-physiologic parameter regimes for GAP and was unable to explain the lack of overshoot in G12V compared to WT (the model predicted overshoot in both scenarios). In contrast, including both competition <i>and</i> a refractory intermediate GTPase state produced a model that captured the main observations as to how system output was affected by GAP, Ras density, effector concentrations, mutational state and multiple effectors. The exact molecular nature of this intermediate GTPase state will be the subject of additional work but at present is outside the scope of this systems-oriented manuscript. We have included an extensive discussion of this modeling in the main text, and have included 3 new associated supplemental figures that contain this modeling data and articulate how it connects to our empirical observations."

Instead, we were primarily focused in how effector binding to GTPases (the most fundamental aspect of all Ras-mediated signal transmission) <i>in general</i> is affected by network configurations and effector properties. The complex effector binding dynamics that we observe are now discussed as the background and context in which other molecule-specific signaling mechanisms like dimerization or lipid interactions take place.
